THe holy and blessed doctor saint Ierom says this auctoryte / do alweye
sum good work / to the end that the devil find the not idle / And the holy
doctor saint austyn says in the book of the labor of monks / that no man
strong or mighty to labor ought to be idle for which cause when I had
parfourmed and accomplisshed diverse werkys and hystoryes translated out of
frensshe in to english at the request of certain lords / ladies and
gentylmen / as thystorye of the recuyel of Troy / the book of the chesse / the
hystorye of Jason / The hystorye of the myrrour of the world / the xv books of
Metamorpheseos in which been contained the fables of ouyde / and the hystorye
of (...)froy of boloyn in the conqueste of Iherusalem / with other diverse
werkys and books / I nyste what work to begin and put forth after the said
werkys tofore made / and for as much as ydelnesse is so much blamed / as
says saint bernard the myllyfluous doctor that she is mother of lies / and
stepdame of virtues / and it is she that overthrows strong men in to sin /
quenchyth virtue / nouryssheth pride / and makes the way ready to goo to hell
/ and Johan cassyodore says that the thout of him that is idle thinks on
none other thing but on lychorous metys and vyandes for his belly / and the
holy saint bernard aforesaid says in an epistle / when the time shall come /
that it shall behoue us to render and give acomptes of our idle time / what
reason may we render / or what answer shall we give / when in ydlenes is none
excuse / and prosper says that who someuer lives in idleness / lives in
manner of a dombe be / and by cause I have seen the auctorytees / that blame
and despise so much ydlenes / and also know well that it is one of the capytal
and dedely sins much hateful unto god Therefore I have concluded and fermelye
purposed in my self no more to be idle but will apply my self to labor and
such ocupacion as I have be acustomed to do / and for as much as saint austyn
aforesaid says upon a psalm / that good work ought not be done for fere of
pain / but for the love of rightwysnesse / and that it be of very and
souerayn fraunchyse / and by cause me seems to be a souerayn well to Incyte
and exhort men and wymmen to keep them from slouthe and idleness / and to
let to be vnderstonden to such people as been not letterd / the natyuytees /
the lives / the passions / the miracles / and the death of the holy saints /
and also so^me other notorye deeds and acts of times passed / I have submysed
my self to translate in to englyssle the legende of saints / which is called
legenda aurea in latin / that is to say the golden legende for in like wise as
gold is most noble above al other metalles / in like wise is this legende
holden most noble above al other werkys / against me here might sum persons
say that this legende has be translated tofore and truth it is / but for as
much as I had by me a legende in frensshe / another in latin / and the third
in english which varyed in many and diverse places / and also many hystoryes
were comprysed in the two other books / which were not in the english book
and therefore I have written one out of the said three books / which I have
ordryd otherwise than the said english legende is / which was so tofore made
/ besechyng all them that shall see or here it read to pardone me where I
have erryd / or made fawte / which if any be / is of ygnoraunce and ageyn my
will / and submytte it holy of such as can and may to correct it / humbly
bysechyng them so to do / and in so doing / they shall deserve a synguler lawde
and merit / and I shall pray for them unto almighty god that he of his benygne
grace reward them etc^ And that it prouffyte to all them that shall read or
here it read / and may encreace in them virtue / and expelle vice and sin /
that by the ensaumple of the holy saints amend their living here in this
short life / that by their merytes / they and I may come to everlasting life and
bliss in heaven amen /

My Trust Is


ANd for as much as this said work was great and over chargeable to me
taccomplisshe I feryd me in the beginning of the translacyon to have continued
it / by cause of the long time of the translacion / and also in thenpryntyng
of ye same and in manner half desperate to have accomplissd it / was in purpose
to have left it / after that I had begone to translate it / and to have laid
it aparte ne had it be at thynstaunce and request of the puyssant noble and
virtuous earl my lord wyllyam earl of arondel / which desired me to proceed
and continue the said work / and promised me to take a reasonable qua^tyte of
them when they were achyeued and accomplisshed / and sent to me a worshypful
gentylman a servant of his named Ioh^n Stanney which solycyted me in my
Lords name that I should in no wise leave it but accomplisshe it promysyng that
my said lord should during my life give and grant to me a yearly fee / that is
to wete a bucke in summer / and a do in winter / with which fee I hold me
well content / Then at centemplacion and reverence of my said lord / I have
endeuoyred me to make an end and fynysshe this said translacion / and also
have enprynted it in the most best wise that I have could or might / and
present this said boook to his good and noble lordshyp / as chyef causer of
the achyeuyng of hit / prayeng him to take it in gree of me Wyllyam caxton his
pour servant / and that it like him to remember my fee / and I shall pray
unto almighty god for his long life and welfare / and after this short and
transytorye life to come in to everlasting joy in heaven / the which he send
to him and me / and unto al them that shall read and here this said book / that
for the love and feythe of whom al these holy saints has suffered death and
passion amen /

And to the end each hystoryy life and passion may be shortly fou^den I have
ordained this table following / where and in what leef he shall find such as
shall be desired / and have set the nombre of every leef in the margyne /

Explicit
THe time of thadue^t or coming of our lord in to this world is hallowed in holy
church the time of iiij wekes in betokenyng of iiij diverse comynges / The j
was when he ca^ and apierid in humayn nature and flessh The ij is in the heart
and conscience / The iij is at the death / The iiij is at last Judgment / The
last weke may uneath be acco^plissed / For the glory of the saints which
shall be yeuen at the last coming shall never end ne fynysshe / And to this
signyfyau^ce ye first responce of the first weke of aduent has iiij verse to
rekene Gloria patri and filio for one / to the report of the iiij wekis / and
how be it that there be iiij comynges of our lord / yet ye church makes
mencio^ in especial but of tweyne / yt is to wete of that he ca^ in humayne
nature to the world / and of yt he comes to the Judgment and dome / as it
apperith in thoffyce of the church of this time / And therefore the fastings
that been in this time ben of gladness and of Joy in one party / and that other
party is in bitterness of heart / By cause of the coming of our lord in our
nature humayne / they ben of Joy and gladness / And by cause of the coming at
ye day of Judgment / they be of bitterness and heaviness As towchyng the coming of
our lord in our bodyly flessh we may considre three things of this coming That
is to wete thoportunyte / the necessyte / and the vty / lyte / The oportunyte
of coming is taken by the reason of the man that first was vaynquysshyd in the
law of nature of the defaulte of the knowledge of god / by which he fill in to
evil errors / and therefore he was constrained to cry to god Illui^a oculos
meos / yt is to say lord give light to mine eyes After came the la / we of god
which has given commandment in which he has been overcome of Impuissance /
as first he has cried / there is non yt fulfilleth but that coma^deth for there
he is only taught / but not delyuerd fro sin ne helped by grace / and
therefore he was constrained to cry / there laketh non to comande but there is
none that acco^plisheth the commandment / Then came the sone of god in time
wha^ man was vaynquysshid of ygnorance and Impuissau^ce / to ye if he had so
come^ to fore / perauenture man might say yt by his own merits he might have
be saved / and thus he had not be bound to yield thanks to god / The ij thing
yt is showed us of this coming is the necessyte by reason of the time / of which
thappostle poul speaks / ad galatas the iiij chapitre / At vbi venet plenitudo
temperis / when the plenitude or full time of the grace of god was ordained /
then he sent his sone yt was god and sone of the virgyne and wife / which
was made subget to the law / To that yt they be subget to ye law he bought
hem again and were received sons of god by grace of adopcion / Now says saint
austyn yt many demand why he came not rather / he answerth that it was by cause
that the plenytude of time was not come / which should come by him that all
things were ordained and made / and after when this plenitude of time came / he
ca^ that of time passed has delyueryd us To that we shall be delyueryd of time
we shall come to him / where as no time passes / but is perpetuite / The iij
thing that is shewde to us of this coming is the vtylyte and proufit that
comes for the cause of the hurt and sekenes general / For sith the maladye
was general / the medecyne must be general / whereof says saint Austyn / that
then came the great medecyn / when the great maladye was through all the world
whereof the holy church remembers in vij Antemmis yt ben songen to fore the
natyuyte of our lord where the maladye is showed in diverse manners / And for
each dema^deth remedy of his maladye of the phisicyen For to fore the coming
of our lord we were ygnorant / and blind bounden to pain perdurable / bond
to the devil / Alyed to him by evil custom of sin / ywrapped in derkenes /
and driven out of our country and therefore we have great need of a doctor or
techer / of ayenbyar of a delyuerer / of a conduyter / of a lighter or
Illuminer and of a Savior / Therefore then that we were ignorant / we had
need that we were of him taught and learned / And therefore we cry in the first
Antheme O sapiencia que ex ore altissimi prodisti et cetera O sapience
sovereign / which art descended fro the mowthe of the most hye / Come to us /
and teache us the way of prudence / And for as much as it is over lytyl to us
for to be taught / we dema^de in the second Antheme to be again bought and
say / O adonay and dux domus israhel etc^ / veni ad redimendum nos in brachio
extenso / O thou souerayn sire and prince of the house of ysrahel come and
ayenbye us by thy puyssan^ce with arms stratched but lityl should it prouffyt
us for to be taught and ayenbought / if yet we were holden in prison fast
shette / And therefore we demand to be delyuerd saying / O radix iesse veni ad
liberandum ia^ noli tardare / O Rote of Iesse come and delyure us and tarry not
And what auaylleth unto prisoners to be bought again and delyueryd if they were
not vnbo^den / and fre to goo where they would / lytyl should it prouffyte / and
there fore we demand that we may be vnbou^d and losed fro all bond of sin
when we cry in the fourth Antheme / O clauis david etc^ O keye of david that
closes that noman may opene / and openest that noman may shytte / Come to us /
and cast the prisoner out of the prison that sytteth in derkenes and shadow of
death / For they that have been long in prison and derk places may not se clerly
but have theyer eyes dym / Terfor after we be delyueryd fro prison it behooves
that our eyes be made clear and our sight illumyned for to see whyder we should
goo / and therefore we cry in the fyfth antheme / O oriens splendour lucis
eterne veni and illumina sedentes in tenebris et vmbra mortis / O Oryent that
art the resplendour of theternal light come and Illumyne them that sytte in
derkenes and shadow of death / and if we were taught / lighted / unbound and
bought / what should it auaylle to us / but if we should be sauyd / And therefore
we require to be sauyd / and therefore we say in the two last Anthemes / the vj
and the vij we demand to be saved / when we cry / O rex ge^cium veni et salua
homine^ / quem de limo formasti / O thou king of peoples / come and save the
man / that thou have fourmed of the slyme of therthe / and in the seventh / O
emanuel rex et legifer noster / ueni ad saluandum nos domine deus noster / o
emanuel that art our king and berar of our law / our lord our god / come and
save us / The proufyte of his coming is assigned of many sayntis / in many
manners / For luke says in the fourth chapter / that our lord was sent and
came to us for vij prouffytes where he says the speryte of our lord on me
which he reherseth by order / he was sent for the comfort of the pour / to
hele them that were seek in sin / to delyuere them that were in prison / to
teache them that were vncunnyng / to foryeue sins / to bye again al mankind
And fore to give reward to them that deserve it / And saint Austyn puts
here iij prouffytes of his coming and seyth / In this wretchid world what
haboundeth / but to be born / to labor / and to deye / These ben the
marcha^dyses of our region / and to this marcha^dyses / the noble merchant
Ihu^s descended And by cause / all marchans give and take they give that they
have / and take yt they have not / Ihesu Christ in this marchandyse gaf and took
/ he took that / which in this world habou^deth that is to wete to be born /
to labor / and to deye / he gaf again to us to be born spirituelly / to arise
/ and to regne pardurably / And / he him self came to us to take vylo^nyes / and
to give to us honor / to suffer death / and to give us life / to take pouerte /
and to give us glory / Saint Gregore puts iiij. causes of the prouffyte of
his coming saying / Studebant omnes superbi de eade^ stirpe progeniti* prospera
vite presentis appetere: Aduersa deuitare: ob probria fugere: gloria^ sequi:
They of the world in their pride descended of the same lignage / studied to
desire the prosperity of this present life / teschue thaduersites / to fle the
reproefs and shames and tensiewe the glory of the world / and our lord came
encarnate among them askyng and sechyng the aduersitees / despytyng the
prosperitees / embrachyng vylo^nyes / fleyng all vain glory / And he him self
which descended from glory / ca^ and he come^ taught new things / And in
showing merueylles / suffrid many evil / saint bernard puts other causes /
and says yt we trauayll in this world for iij manner of maladyes or sekenes /
For we be^ lightly deceived Feeble to do well / and frayll to resist ayens
evil / if we entende to do well / we faylle / if we do pain to resist the
evil / we ben sourmounted and overcome / and for this / the coming of Ihesu
Christ was to us necessary / To that he enhabiteth in us by faith / he
enlumyneth our eyes of the heart / And in abydyng with us / he helps us in
our maladye / and in being with us he deffendeth our fraylte against our enemies
/ Of the second coming which shall be at last Judgment / Two things ben to
be seyne / that is to wit / that which comes to fore the Judgment / And that
which shall be at Judgment / As fore the first / three things shall be to fore
the Judgment / First the terrible confusion of signs and tokenes / Secondly
the malice and the deceyte of Antecryst / and the third of the ueheme^t and
merueyllous operacio^ of the fy^e / As touching the signs saint luke says in
the xxv chapitre / Eru^t signa in sole luna and stellis etc^ / There shall be
great signs in the son / in the moon / and in the sterres and in therthe
oppression of people anguysshous for the confusion of the sown of the sea and
of the wawes / The in first signs be^ determined in the book of thapocalips
in the vj chapitre / Sol factus e^ niger tanqua^ saccus cilicinus / and luna
facta e^ sicut sanguis / and stelle cecideru^t super terram / Then shall be
the time / that the son shall be black / as a sack groos and rude / and the moon shall be as blood / and the sterres shall fall on therthe / The son is
said derke for as much as he is deprived of his light / as though he wept for
the deyeng of men For saint Austyn says / yt the vengeance of god shall be so
cruel at the day of dome / that the son shall not dar behold it Or as for to
speak of the propre signyficacion spirytuelly to be vndersto^den / is that the
son of Justice Ihu^ Christ shall be then so derke / yt noman shall dar know
him / The heaven is here taken for thayer And the sterres be called of this
heaven which have symylytude and semblau^ce like sterres / And after the comyne
langage / men say that they fall fro heaven / wha^ they descend under the
heaven / and in that / the scripture co^fermeth to the manner comyne of spekyng
And then shall be made such oppression / For the qualyte of the fire shall
halou^de strongly / and this shall our lord do for the terror and f^re of the
sinners / Or the sterres shall be said to fall / for by cause they cast out
Rays of fire / Or by cause there be many that seem clear as sterres / and
then shall fall fro the faith / Or that they witthdrawe their light / that they
ne may be seen lytil or naught / Of the fourth sign / the which shall be the
pressure and tha^guysshe that shall be upon therthe says saint Matthew in the
iiij chapitre / yt then shall be such tribulacio^ / that never was none so
great seen upon therthe / sith the world began / ne never shall be / The v sign
shall be / the confusion that shall be on the sea / and hereof say so^me and
ymagyne / that the sea shall perysshe / by a great brekyng of his first qualite
/ that is to say of his puis / sau^ce and virtue / according to that saint
John^ says in / thapecalips in the xxj chapitre / Et mare Ia^ no^ est / And as
touching to his qualites of his wawes / of rysyng and other accidens / And
after this that some other say / the fown shall be much great / For it shall
give out a merueyllous great noise and bruyt / For the sea shall be lift up xl
cubits above the montaygnes And after shall aswage and goo down / Or to speak
after the lettre / plainly after the sentence of saint gregore / Then / shall
the sea be made new / And troublyng of the wawes that never were herd like /
Now we have that saint Iherome shows to us / in ye yerly historyes of
thebrews xv signs and tokenes / the which shall come before the Judgment / but
he declares not if they shall show contynuelly / or if there shall be space
between them / The first sign is that the sea shall arise fyfte^ cubytes above
ye heyght of ye mo^taynes / in being in his place as a wall / The ij day the sea shall desce^de so low that uneath it shall be seen / The third sign / the
great fysshes as whales and other shall appiere a boue the water / and shall cry
unto the heaven / And god only shall understand their cry / The fourth sign
shall be that the sea and water shall brenne / The fyfte sign that the trees and
herbs shall give dew of blood and in the v day diverse clerkys afferme / yt
all the birds of thayer shall assemble in a field / euerych kind by them self
and shall not ete ne drink / but shall abide the coming of the Judge in great
feer / The vj sign the edefices and byldyngig shall fall down / and in this vj
day thondres and tempestis full of fire shall grow in the west where the son
goth down / against the firmament in rennyng to the eest / The vij sign the
stones shall smite and hurtle to gydre / and shall cleue in four parties / and
each party shall smite other ne none shall understand ne here the sown / but
god only / The eight sign shall be the moeuyng and general tremblyng of therthe
/ which shall be so great as it is said that noman ne best shall not mow sto^de
thereon / but fall to the ground / The ix. sign / All the earth shall be eue^
and plain And all the montaygnes and valeyes shall be brought in to pouldre and
be all like / The tenth day the me^ shall issue out of the caves / and shall goo
by the ways and feldes / as men alyened and out of their wit / And shall not
conne speak one to another / Te xj day the bones of deed men shall issue out of
their beryels and places and shall hold them upon their sepulcres / and fro the
son rysyng unto it goo down the sepulcres shall be open to the end that the
deed bodies may all issue / The xij^ sign all the sterres shall fall fro the
heaven and shall sprede out Rays of fire / and then great quantyte shall grow
/ In this xij. day it is said that all the beestes shall come to the field
howlyng / and shall not ete ne drink / The xiij. sign all living shall deye /
to the^de that they should arise with the deed bodies The xiiij. day / the heaven
and therthe shall bre^ne The xv. day shall be a new heaven / and new earth / and
all thing and all deed me^ shall arise / The ij thing / yt shall be a fore
Judgment shall be ye folly and malice of a^tecryst / he shall pain him to
deceive all men by iiij. manners / The j manner shall be by suasion and false
exposicion of scripture / For as much as he may he shall give them to
understand that he is Messyas / which was promised in the law that he sold
come / whom we say Ihu^ Christ / and he shall destroy the law of Ihu^ Christ /
and shall ordeyne his law / in allegyng david the prophet that says /
Co^stitue dn^e legislatore^ super eos / Thus shall he say / that it was said
for him as he that was ordained of god for to set law upon his place / After
this that is seid in the scripture of danyel / danielis xj dabu^t
abhominacione^ and desolacione^ te^pli etc^ / Antecryst and his co^plices shall
give abhominacion and desolacion to the temple of god in this time as says the
gloss / Antecrist shall be in the temple of god as god / for that he shall
destroy the law of god / The second manner shall be by merueyllous operacion
of miracles / whereof says thappostle saint poule in his second epistle ad
thesalonice^ses in the second chapitre / where he says Cuius aduentus erit
secundu^ operatio / nem sathane i^ oi^bus verbis et prodigijs mendacibus / Of
Antecryst it is said that the coming shall be after the operacio^ of satan / in
all his signs in all his merueylles / and false lyeng deeds / whereof saint
Iehan makes mencio^ in thapocalips the xiij: chapitre / Fecit signa vt etiam
ignem faceret de celo in terram descendere Antecryst shall make such signs
that is to seye / he shall make such tokenes / that he shall make the fire
descend fro heaven / The gloss says / yt like as the holy ghost descended in
likeness of fire / In like wise shall Antecryst give the evil spirit in lykenes
of fire / Te third manner that he shall do for to deceive / shall be in gyuyng
of yeftis / of which is wreton in the book of daniel the prophet / in his xj
chapitre / dabit eis potestatem in ml^tis / and terra^ diuidet gratuito /
Antecryst shall give puissance to his seruauntis in many things / And shall
depart therthe to them after his will / The gloss says / that Antecryst shall
give many yeftes to them that he shall deceive / And to his disciples he shall
deuyde therthe / and them that he may not subdue by terror and fere / he shall
subdue and overcome them by avarice and make them thereby tobeye him / The iiij
manner for to deceive them shall be by tourments that he shall give to them /
whereof daniel says in his viij chapitre / Supra quoth credi potest / vniuersa
vastabit / Noman shall bileue how he shall destroy and tormente the^ that will
not bileue in him / For to draw the^ to him by force / And saint gre / gore
says of him Robustos quippe iterficiet and cetera he shall slay the great and
strong mien / when he may not win ne overcome the^ by heart ne will he shall
overcome them by torment The third thing that shall goo to fore the Judgment /
shall be the right vehement fire fire / the which shall goo to fore the face of
the Judge / And god shall se^de this fire for four causes / First for the
renewyng of the world / for he shall purge and renew the eleme^tes / And like
to the form of the deluuye / It shall be xl. cubits hyer tha^ all the
mo^taynes / like as it is wreton in thystorye scolastyque For the works of the
people may mou^te so hye / Secondly for the purgatio^ of the people / For then
that fire shall be instead of the fire of purgatory to them that then shall
be on live / Thirdely for to to give more gretter tormente to the^ that be
dampened / Fourthly for to give more clerenes and light unto the seyntes / For
after the saying of saint basylle / our lord god wha^ he shall make the
purgacio^ of the world / he shall depart the hete of the fire fro the
resplendour and bryghtnes And all the hete he shall send to the place of
dampened people by cause they should be the more turmented / And all the
resplendour brightness he shall send to the place of seyntes / to the^de that
they be the more conforted / Of thies that shall ensiewe and follow the Judgment
there ben many the first shall by the descencio^ of the Judge The Judge shall
desce^de in to the vale of Iosaphat / and shall set the good on his right
hand / and the evil on the lift hand in an hye place in thayer / by cause
other should see them / And it ought not to be byleued that within that lyte
v^leye / all might be enclosed / after that / which saint Jerome says / but
many shall be there / and the other there about / Nevertheless in a lytil space
of lord / may be men with out nombre by dyuyne puissau^ce and ordinance / and
if it be of necessite / the chosen people shall be in thayer for the agilite and
lightness of their bodies and also in soul / And then the Judge shall despute
and repreue the wicked men of the works of mercy / which he ordained to us /
And they shall not mow replye / but shall the^ ne weep upon the^ self and upon
their deeds like as saint John^ Grisosto^ says upon the gospel of saint
Matthew / in saying that the Jews shall weep their life / wha^ they shall see
their Judge / and him / that gives life to all men / who^ they esteemed and
trowed a deed man / and shall blame the^ self for his body hurt and wounded by
the^ And they may not deny their cruelte but shall weep in great distress /
The paynems which by the vain disputacio^s of the philosophres were deceived
/ and supposed to have been folly to worshipe god crucyfyed / The Cryste^ me^
synnars shall weep / that have more louyd the world than god / The heretyques
shall weep by cause they holden falls opynyons ayens the faith of Ihu^ Christ /
whom then they shall see the souerayn Judge / whom the Jews crucyfyed / and so
shall all the lynages of the world weep / for they shall have no force ne power
ne strength to resist against him / ne they may not flee to fore his face / ne
they shall have no time of space to do penance for their sins ne to make
satisfaction of the great anguissh that they shall have of al things there shall
nothing abide to the^ but weeping / The second thing that shall follow at
Judgment is the difference of the ordres / For thus as saint gregory says / at
the day of Judgment shall be iiij things / two on the party reproved / and two
on the party chose^ / The first shall be dampened and perrisshyd to whom he shall
say / Esu^^ui and no^ dedistis michi ma^du / care / I had hongre / and ye have
given to me no mete The other shall not be Iuged and perysshe / of whom it is
wreton. Qui no^ credit ia^ iudicatus e^ / he that believes not is now Iuged /
for they shall not perceive the words of the Judge / which would not keep the
words of god / The other of the party of the good shall be Iuged / and shall
reygne as they to whom shall be said / I have had hungre / and ye / have give
me mete / The other shall not be Iuged / and yet shall regne / That is to wit
the parfyght men that shall Judge other / not that they shall give the sentence of
the Judgment / For the souerayn Judge shall only give the sentence but they be
said Iuges / by cause they be present approuyng the Judgment / And this
assistence shall be first to the honor of saints / For it shall be great honor
to them to have their seetes and sytte with the Judge / like as Ihu^ Christ
promised to them / that they should be syttyng upon xij. seetes Iugyng the xij
lignages of Israhel Secondly to the co^firmacio^ of the sentence / For the
syhal aproue the sentence yeue^ of the Judge / as don the assiste^tis in
Judgment wiche approve the sentence of the Judge that is good and Just / And
with their hands they set to their names in witness / like as david says /
Vt facia^t i^ eis Iudiciu^ conscriptu^ etc^ / To the end that they make upon the
dampened / Judgment wreton with the Judge / Thirdly that shall be to conde^pnacion
of the evil people / whom they shall condemn by the works of their good life /
The third thing that follows the Judgment that shall be thenseygnes and
tokenes of the passion of Ihesu Crist / That is to wit / the cross / the
naylles / and the wounds / The which signs shall be first for to show his
glorious victory / And by that they shall appear in thexcelle^ce of his glory
/ Whereof says saint John^ Grysostome that the Cross and the wounds shall be
more shynyng than any Rays of the son / now then says he / co^sydere ye
what the virtue is of the cross / The son then shall be derke / and the moon shall give no light here by then may ye understand / how much the
cross is more shynyng than the moon / and more clear than the son / Secondly
for to show his mercy / by which he shall save the good / Thirdly for to
show his Justice / how Justly he has dampened the^ that be evil / by cause
they have despised so noble pryse as his blood / and set not thereby / And
therefore as says saint John^ Grisostome / he shall say to the^ hard words by
manner of repreef / For your sake I made my self a man / for you I have been
beten / bounden scorgyd and crucified / where is now the fruit that I have
suffered so many Injuries fore / lo see the prys of my blood that I have given
to redeem you / where is the seruyse / that ye have don to me for the prys of
my blood that I have give for you / And where I was god in my glory I came down
and was made man for you / And ye have made me more vile than any thing / For
all manner things of fylthe ye have more loved than my Justice and my faith /
The fourth thing that follows the dome or Iugememt / is the straytenesse and
the Rygour of the Judge / For it may not bow ne le ne for nothing / For he is
all mighty / ne noman may do any thing against him ne by yeftes ne otherwise /
For all richesses be in him and all tresour / And hereof says saint bernard /
The day shall come / that clean and holy hertes shall be more worth than words
aourned / and good conscience better than a sack full of money For this is he
that shall not be deceived by words / ne shall bow for yeftes / and hereof says
saint Austyn / we awayte upon the day of Judgment / and that day shall be right
full of equity / The Judge the^ shall give no favor to none be he never so
p^yssant / ne do against Justice / ne no bishop / none Abbot / ne no prnyce
may corrupt him for gold ne silver / ne for hate / For all goodness is in him /
Therefore none hate may be in him / whereof Solomon the wise says capl^o xj /
Odisti eorum que fecisti / God hated never thing that he made and created /
For he is right Just / and so Just / that they / that he calls his brethern
/ they be false christian men / whom he shall not delyure after this that david
says / fratrem non redimet / Also he shall not be deceived by error / For he
is right wise / Of him says saint leon the pope of this Judgment which is the
sentence of the souuerayn Judge / that is that his regard and lookyng makyth
all thing to tremble / to whom all ferme and stable thing in comparison / is
mouable / And all secret thing / opene / to whom all derkenes is clear / all
thing without voys answers / Silence co^fes: seth and witnesses / And
without voys thought speaks / And for as much as his wysdom is so great /
Against his wysedom aduayle none allegacio^s of advocates / ne sophym of
philosophres / ne the fair words aourned of thyntercessours ne moyens / ne the
malices of them that be cautelous / And of thise fooure here says saint
Iherome / Qua^ti illic eli^gues and muti / feliciores loquacibus eru^t. quo ad
primum / Quanti pastores / philosophis quo ad secundum / Quanti eustuci /
oratoribus / quo ad tercium / Quanti hebetes / argucijs preferendi sunt
ciceronis / quo ad quartum / how many shall there be at this Judgment / that shall
have no tongue / by which they shall not speak / which shall be more eurous and
blessed than the fair and great spekars And the herdemen and shepherders more
happy / than the philosophers / And how many rude and simple men / more than
the wise men / And how many foles and Innocens more than the shewers of the
doctrynes of Ciceron / than of other full of vain science / They shall be set
to fore and received at that day / like as he would say / the first shall be
taken / and the other shall be put away / The fyfthe thing that shall be at
day of dome / shall be thorrible accusacion / For then shall be there accuseurs
against the sinner / The first accuser shall be the devil / Of whom saint
Austyn says / that thenemy then shall be ready which shall recite the words
of our profession / And shall show to fore us / all that ever we have don /
and in what place / and what time we have sinned / And what good then we
should have don / and he shall say to the Judge / right true Judge / deem and
Judge this synnar to be mine / for his trespaas which would be thine by grace /
he is thine by nature / he is mine by his myserye / he is thine by thy passion
/ he is mine by monycion / To the he has be in obedyent / To me he has be
obedyent / he has received of the the vesture of Inmortalite: Of me he has
taken this penyble cote / with which he is clad / he has left thy vesture /
and is comen to mine Right Just demer / Judge him to be mine for to be dampened
with me / Alas / Alas / how may the mouth of them open that shall thus be
fou^den / wha^ they shall be Justly dampened to be with the devil / ^ The second
accusement is our own trespaas / For our own propre sins shall accuse us /
As the wise salomo^ says / sapie^tie quarto / venient in cogitato^em pcco^rum
suorum timidi / and traduce^t illos ex aduerso i^iqitates eorum To the Judgment
they shall come in the thought of their sins in great dread / And their
wyckednesses shall cast them out afterward: Then their works shall say to
gydre / Thou have made us: we ben engendered of the / we shall not leave the / But
alleway we shall be with the / And ^ith the we shall goo to the dome / Thus in
many things and crimes they shall accuse the sinners / The third accuse^ shall
be all the world / whereof says saint gregorye / if thou demand who shall
accuse the I say the world which is offended And saint John^ grisestome seyth
that at that day there we shall answer nothing / but the heaven / the earth /
the water / the son / the days / and the nyghtes / shall be in wytnes of our
sins / And if we speak not / our works and our thoughts shall be moeued /
and all the world shall be against us to fore god / And shall accuse us strongly /
The sixth thing that ensieweth the dome / shall be witness true without fayllyng
/ The synnar shall have iij wytnessis against him That one that is above him that
is to wete / that shall be Judge and wytnes / like as he says by the mouth of
Ieremye the prophet / I am Judge and witness says our lord / That other witness
is within him / that is to wete his conscience / therefore says saint Austyn if
thou dredest the Judge coming / correct thy conscience / For the word of thy
mouth is the wytnes of thy conscience: That other wytnes is by him / that is
his propre angele deputed to his keeping. the which by cause that he knows
his conscience / shall bear witness against him / whereof it is said in Job / The
heuenes that is to say the angeles then shall show thynyquytees of the
sinners / The seventh thing that shall be at Judgment is the constraynt of the
sinners: whereof says saint gregoire / O how strayte shall be the ways to
sinners / all above shall the Judge sytte full of wrath / And underneath thorrible
and co^fused region of pain / on their right side their sins / which shall
accuse them / On their lift side their enemies deuylles without no^bre drawyng
them to torment / within them their conscience shall be brennyng / And with out
forth the world brennyng / The caytyf and miserable synnar thus taken: whyther
shall he flee / or whyter shall he goo / he shall not mow hyde him / For it is
Impossible / And to show it is Intolerable / so much that he shall not conne
bear it / The eyghte that he shall have the sentence inreuocable / This sentence
shall never be repelled / ne it may be appeled / For thappellacion shall not be
received for three causes: as it should be in Judgment the first cause is for
thexcelle^ce of the Judge / As of a king. if he give a sentence / it may not be
appelled in his royaume / For there is none therein above him souerayn and in
like wise of the emperor / and of the pope / Secondly for theuydence of the
crime / wiche is notoryly known / Thirdly when the thing of which the
Judgment is yeuen may not be differred / And that it have not dilacion / And
for thise three causes / there may none appele be fro the dyuyne sentence /
First for thexcellence of the Judge For god has none above him / but he is
above all other in eternyte / in dignyte / and in auctorite / And sum wise /
may be appelled fro the Emperor to god / But fro god may noma^ appelle / for
he has none above him / Secondly for the crime / For all trespaas and sins
shall be there openly showed / whereof says saint Jerome / that in this day all
our deeds shall be showed / like as they were written in a table and noted /
Thirdly for the thing which may not suffer dilacion / For all things that
shall be don at Judgment shall be don in a twynkelyng of an eye / Then late
us pray that we may in this holy time so to receive him that at the day of
Judgment we may be received in to his everlasting bliss

Amen
Thus ends thystorye of thaduente
Here follows the Natiuite of our lord ihesu Crist
When the world had endured five thousand and nine hundred year after eusebe
the holy saint Octouian the emperor commanded that all the world should be
descriued / so that he might know / how many cytees / how many towns / and
how many persons he had in all the universal world / Then was so great
peace in therthe that all the world was obeyssaunt to him And therefore our
lord would be born in that time / that it should be known that he brought peace
fro heaven / And this emperor commanded that eueri man should goo in to the
tounes / cytees or villages frowhens they were of / and should bring with hem a
penny in knowlechyng that he was subgette to thempyre of rome / And by so many
pens as should be founden received / should be known the nombre of the persons
/ Joseph which then was of the lignage of david / And dwelled in Nazareth /
went in to the cite of Bethlem And ladde with him the virgyne marie his wife /
And when they were comen theder / by cause the hostryes were all taken up /
they were constrained to be with out in a common place where all people went /
And there was a stable for an ass that he brought with him and for an ox / In
that night our blessid lady and mother of god was delyuerd of our blessed
savior upon the heye that lay in the rack / At which Natiuite our lord
showed many meruaylles / Fo by cause that the world was in so great peace / the
Romans had don mad a temple / which was named the temple of peace / On which
they co^seylled with Appollo / to know how long it should stond and endure /
Appollo answered to them that it shall sto^d as long / till a maid had brought
forth and born a child / And therefore they did do write on the portal of ye
temple / loo this is the temple of peace that ever shall endure / For they
supposed well / that a maid might never bear ne bring forth a child / This
temple / that same time that our lady was delyuerd and our lord born /
ouerthrewe and fylle all down / Of which Christian men afterward mad in the
same place a church of our lady which is called sca^ maria rotunda / that is
to say the church of saint marie the Round / Also the same night as records
Innocent the third which was pope / that there sprange and sourded in rome
the same night a well or a fountain / and ran largely all that night and all
that day unto the river of Rome called Tybre / Also after that records saint
John^ Grisosto^me / the three kings were this night in their orysons and
prayers upon a montayne / when a sterre appeared by them which had the form of
a right fair child / which had a cross in his forhed / which said to these
three kings / that they should goo to Iherusalem / And there they should find the
sone of the virgyne god and man which then was born / Also there appeared in
thorient three sons / which lytil and lytil assembled to gydre / and were all
on one / As it is sygnyfyed to us / that thies three things / is the godhed /
the soul / and the body / which ben in three natures assembled in one person
/ Also Octauian the emperor / like as Innocent records / That he was much
desired of his counseyll and of his people / that he should do men worship
him as god / For never had there be to fore him so great a maistre and lord of
the World as he was / Then the emperor sent for a prophetess named Sebyle /
for to demand of her / if there were any so great and like him in therthe / Or
if any should come after him / Thus at hour of mydday she beheld the heaven /
and saw a cercle of gold about the son / And in the myddle of the cercle a
maid holdyng a child in her arms Then she called the emperor amd showed it
him / when Octauien saw that / he merveylled over much / whereof Sebyle said
to him / hic puer mayor te est / ipsum adora / This Child is gretter lord than
thou art / worship him / Then wha^ the emperor understood that this child was
gretter lord tha^ he was he would not be worshipped as god / but worshipped this
child that should be born / wherefore the Christian men made a church of the same
chamber of the emperor / and named it Ara celi / After this it happed on a night
/ as a great maistre which is of great auctorite in scripture which is named
bartilmew records that the Rod of eugaddi which is by Iherusalem which
berith bame flowred this night and bare fruit and gaf liquour of bame / After
this came the angelle and apperid to the shepherdes that kept their sheep / and
said to them / I anounce and show to you a great Joy / For the savyour of
the world is in this night born / in the cite of Bethlee^ / there may ye find
him wrapped in clowtes / And anon as the Angel had said this / a great
multitud of angelis appeared with him / and began to sing / honor glory and
health be to god on hye / And in therthe peace to men of good will / Then said
the shepherdes late us goo to bethleem and see this thing / And when they came
they fond like as the angele had said And it happed this night / that all the
sodomytes that did sin against nature were deed and extynct / For god hated
so much this sin / that he might not suffer / that nature humayne which he
had taken / were delyuerd to so great shame / whereof saint Austi^ says / that
it lackyd but lytil / that god would not become man for that sin / In this
time Octouian made to cut and enlarge the ways / and quyted the Romans of
all the dettes that they ought to him / This ffeste of Natyuyte of our lord is
one of the grettest feestes of all the year / and for to tell all the
miracles that our lord has shewde it should conteyne an hole book / but at
this time I shall leave and pass over / sauf one thing that I have herd ones
prec^yd of a worshipeful doctor / that what person being in clean life /
desire on this day a bone of god / as fer as it is rightful / and good for him
/ our lord at reverence of this blessed and hie feste of his natyuyte will
grant it to him then let us always make us in clean life at this feste that
we may so plese him / that after this short life we may come unto his bliss Ame^

Here ends the natyuyte of our lord
Ande here follows his circumsicion
The day of the circu^sicion of our lord there ben four things that make and
show it to be holy and solemn / The first is the vtas of the Natyuyte / The
second thymposico^n of a new name beryng health / The third theffusion of his
precious blood / The fourth the signs of the circumcision / As for the first
it apperith / For the vtas of saints ben solemn / by much more Reason ought
it to be of him that is the sayncte of all saynctes / Now it seems that the
Natyuyte of our lord ought not to have none vtas / For the natyuyte tends to
the death / And the decees of saints have their vtas / by cause they be born of
the natyuyte that stratcheth to life perdurable for to be after gloryfyed in
body / And by the same way it seems that the Natyuyte of the glorious virgyne
Marie And of saint John^ baptiste / and of the resurrexio^ of our lord ouhgt
not to have vtas / For the resurrexio^ was the^ don / herto we ought to
consydre like as says a doctor that in this vtas we should fulfylle such
things / as we acco^plisshyd not in the pri^cypal day that our lord was born
in / of which of au^cyent time men were wont to sing at mass / Vultum
tuum domine / etc^ / to the honor of our lady saint marie / The other octaues
or vtases / as of pa^ke whitso^tyde / the Natyuytees of our lady and saint
John^ baptist ben of deuocio^ as of other saints / that men will honor for
singular cause or affection / And they may be said the octaues of figuracion /
For they signyfye and figure the octaue of the last resurrection perpetuell /
which is the eight eage / And as to the second / this day was his name
Imposed to him / and was named with the new name that the mouth of god named
/ This is the name / of which there is n^ne other under heaven by which we may
be saved / that is Ihesus / After saint bernard this is the name / which in
the mouth is honey / In the eere melodye / and in the heart Joy / This is the
name / after that he says it lyghteth and shyneth like oil / when it is
preached it fedeth the soul / when it is in the mind of the heart / it is
sweet and it enoynteth when it is called / And as the evangelist says / he had
three names / that is to wete / the sone of god / Ihu^s / and Cristus / He is
called the sone of god / in somoche as he is god of god the fader / Cristus in
so much as he is a man taken of a person dyuyne unto nature humayne / and
Ihesus in as much as he is god united to our humanyte / And of this three manner
of names says saint bernard / ye that lie in duste and pouldre arise out of
your sleep and awake ye / and give preysyng to god / loo here that our lord
shall come unto your health / he comes with oygnement / he comes with glory
/ Ihu^s comes not without health ne Crist comes not without unction / ne the
sone of god without glory / For he is our health / our unction / and our Joy
/ and as touching this treble name / to fore his passion he was not parfyghtly
known / as touching the first / he was somewhat known by coniectyng / as of
his enemies which said Ihu^ Crist to be the sone of god / And as to the
second of less or fewer he was known for Ihesu Crist / And as to the third
vocally / for as much as by the voys he was called Ihu^s / But as to the reason
of the name / he was not known / For Ihesus is asmoche to say as savyour /
And this understood not they / After the resurrection / this name treble was
clarefyed and declared / The first to the certaynte / The second to the
publycacion / The third to the reason of the name / The first name is sone of
god / And that / these names ben appropred to him / saint hillarye in his book
that he made of the trynyte says thus / Vere filium dei vnigenitu^ / In
diverse manners / this name sone of god is known / as it is witnessid of god /
God the fader witnessith it / that he is his sone / Thappostles preche it / The
religyons bileue it / The fendes our enemies confess it / And Therefore we
know our lord Ihesu Crist in his manners / by name / by nature / by natyuyte /
by puyssaunce / and by his passion The second name is cristus which is
interpreted unction / For he was enoynted with the oylle of gladness / to fore
all them that to him were party / And by that he is said enoynted / it is
showed / that he was a prophet / A champyon / a priest / and a king These
four persons sometime were wont to be enoynted / Ihesu Crist was a prophet
techyng the doctrine dyuyne / A champio^n in the battle again the devil whom
he ouercam / a priest in reco^cylyng thumayne lynage to god the fadre / And a
king in dystrybutyng and rewardyng every man Of this second name we ben all
named For of this name Criste / we be called Christian men / Of which name saint
austyn says thus / Every Christian man ougth to be Christian of right and Justice
/ of bounte / of entyerte / of pacyence / of Chastete / of clennesse / of
humylite / of Innocence / And pity / And thies names here / ben of Christian men
/ and thou how defendest thou this name / and reteynest for thy self so many
things of which thou have habundance / and none appetyte / know thou that he
is not christian only that berith the name / but he that does the works of
Christ / The third name is Ihesus / And this name after that saint bernard
says is mete / fontayne / medecyn / and light / And it is mete to many virtues
/ For it is confortatyf / it nourisshith / it is enforsyng and strengthyng /
and it augmenteth and encreaceth / Of these he says him self / This name
Ihesus is mete / For as often as thou remembrest it / thou art comforted / what
is that which assailleth so much the heart of him that is thouthful / who is
that which exerciteth the wit thus repaired in virtue / The virtues
comforten / encreace good manners and honestees / who is that nourissith thus
the chaste affections / nothing of the world so much as this name Ihesus /
Secondly he is said a fontayne / whereof saint bernard says Ihesus is the
fontayne of life sealed / the which spredeth in to four stremes / For it
gives to us / wysedom / Ryghtwisnes / sanctificacion / and redemption /
wysedom in predicacion / in gyuyng to us of our sins / absolucion by
ryghtwisnes / sanctificacion in our conversation / And by his passion / our
redemption / And in an other place he says / three stremes run of this name
Ihu^s / that is to wete / word of sorrow / by which is understand confession
/ Spryngyng of precious blood / by which is sygnyfyed affliction / water of
clensyng which sygnefyeth compunction / which of god is smeton to the heart /
Thirdely it is medecyne / whereof says saint ber / nard / This name Ihesus is
such a medecyne / that refrayneth the strength of wrath / it appeaseth the
swellyng of pride / it heleth the wounds of envy / it restrayneth the fire of
lecherye / it destrayneth the flamme of Couetyse / it at tempreth the thurst of
Avarice / And it dries al rotyn wretchidnes / Fourthly it is light / whereof
says saint bernarde / wenest thou that so great a light / And so sodeyn
clerenes may be preched and shewde through out the world / but by this name
Ihesus / This is the name that saint poul bare to fore the people and to fore
kings / as a light set upon a candelstyl or chaundeler for to light to all
/ Also this name ihesus is of great swetenes / whereof says saint bernard / if
thou be Christ / it has no savoure in me but if y read this name Ihesus / if I
dispute or argue / I am not assured but if this name Ihesus be herd Also
Rychard of saint victor says thus Ihesus is a sweet name / A name delectable /
a name confortyng the synnar / and a name of holy hope / Then Ihesus is to me
sweet Ihesus / that is to say my savyour / Secondly that Ihesus is of great
virtue / whereof says peter rananensis uocabis nomen eius Ihesum / Thou shall
call this name Ihesus / this is the name that has given to blind their sight
/ to deef men heeryng / To crooked going / to dombe speech / to deed men life /
And all the stre^gthe of the devil is chaced away and taken out of the body
that he possessyd / Thirdly this name Ihesus is of great excellence / And of
great hyenes / whereof says saint bernard / The name of my savyour / of my
brother of my flessh and of my blood / this is the name that is hyd fro the
beginning of the world but in the end it is reveled and showed / this is the name
that can not be expressid / and of so much as it may not be expressyd of so
much it is more merueyllous / and of somoche as it may not be esteemed / so
much is it of more great grace / And this name was Imposed to him first by
thangel / And of the fader putatyf Joseph / Ihesus is said savyour / And it is
said savyour in three manners or by puissaunce to save / or of habituacion / or
of deed and of work / the first / puissau^ce or might is to him perdurable /
The second of might of habituacion is to him sith the beginning of his
conception / like as the aungelle shewde / and after that he has puissaunce of
deed and work after that the name was Imposed to him of Joseph by cause of his
passion that was to come / whereof the gloss says upon this word / vocabis
nomen eius ihesum / And here thou shall Impose to him this name / which was
give to him by thangele to fore beginning of this world / when then he said
thou shall Impose to him this name / he shows the denominacion made by Joseph
And when he said that of the angelle or of the souerayn it was made / he
towched the ij other domynacio^s / And therefore was this Circumsicion
establyssyd in the heed and beginning of the year at Rome / which is chief of
the world / and ennobled with the first lettre of the chief of the A.b.c. set
in the first place thus fourmed / Ihesu Crist the head of the church is this
day circu^cided / the name is give to him and Imposed / And the vtas of the
natyuyte is hallowed / The third thing that is considered of this holy day /
is theffusion or shedyng of the blood of Ihesu Christ / For on this day first he
began to shede his blood / the which after diverse times he shed / Five
times he shed his blood for us / First at his circumsicion / And this time
was the beginning of our rede^pcion / Secondly in oryson / And in this time he
shewde the desire that he had of our redemption / Thirdly wan he was bound to
the pyler and beten / and this was the merit of our redemption for by his
wou^des we were saved / Fourthly wha^ he was crucyfyed / And this time was the
prys of our redemption / And then he paid that which he had not taken /
Fyfthly when his side was opened And this time was of our redemption the
sacrement / For then out of his side issued blood and water which signefyeth
that we ought to be puryfyed by the water of baptesme / the which water ought
to have virtue and effect of the precious blood of Ihesu Christ / The sixthe
thing of this holy day / is the signacle of the Circumsicion / the which Ihu^
Christ on this day of his benygnyte daygned to take / And ye ought to know that
for many resons he would be circuncised / First for the cause of him self / that
he would show that he had taken our uery flessh humayne / For he knew well /
that there should sum come after that should say / that he had not taken body
real of the virgyne Marie / And therefore would he be circumcised really in
flessh humayne / for to destroy their error / And to shede his naturel blood
/ For a body fantastyque shall shede no blood / Secondly for the cause of us /
for to show to us / how we should be circuncised spirituelly / After that saint
bernard says / There be two manner of circumsicions that we ought to do / that
is to wete without forth our flessh / and within our heart / The circumsicio^
of our body / is in three things / in habyte that it be not noyeful / In
operacion that it be not repreuable / in word that it by not despytous / The
circumsicion of the heart within forth is also in three things / in thought
that it be holy / in affection that it be pure / in encencion that it be
rightful / Item for the rightful cause of us / to that he would save us in this
manner that he was cut in one member for to save all the body / In like wise
would Ihu^ Christ suffer the cuttyng of his circumcision for to save all the
spyrituel body of the church / They ben the me^bres of the church that believe
in him / which by the faith of the church shall be saved / Of which
circumsicion says saint poul ad Colocenses secundo / ye have taken the
circumcison not made with the hand to despoylle and cut the flesh / but
the spirituel circumsicion of Ihesu Christ is that all vices be cut of and
take away / Thirdly he would be circumcised by cause of the Jews / that they
should have none excusacion / but for to believe in him / For if he had not be
circumsised / they might say / they ought not to receive him by cause he
followed not the fadres of the law / Fourthly by cause the devil should have no
knowleche of the mystery of thyncarnacion / As the circumsicion was given
against orygynal sin / the devil wend that he that received it were a synnar
/ and had need of the remedy of circumsicion / And for this cause Ihesu Christ
would that his mother being all way a virgyne should be married / by cause that by
the sacrament of matrymonye / his Incarnacion should be hyd from the feende /
Fyfthly for to fulfylle parfyght Justice and parfyght humylyte / the which is
to submytte him to one lower than him self / therefore would he thus be
circumcised / for to show to us this humylite / as he that is lord and
maistre of the law / submysed him self to the law / Sixthly for tapproue and
fulfill the law of Moses / the which was good and holy For he was not comen
for to destroy the law / but for to fulfylle and keep the law / Thus says
saint poul the xv chapter / I say to you that Ihesu Christ was mynystre of the
circumsicion for the troth of god / to conferme the promesses that he had mad
unto the fadres of tholde law / And the cause why the circumsicion was made
the viij / day / there ben assigned many reasons / The first is for to
understand the sense of the lettre as it lies / For like as Raby moses
which was a right great philosophre in theologye how well that he was a Jew /
when a child in the state of vij days after he is born / is also te^dre / as
he were yet in the womb of his mother / And at vij day he is fortefyed and
affermed / Therefore as he says / our lord would that the lytil children at
viij day should be circumcised / by cause they should not be hurt by the great
tendrenes yt they have yet / And he would not that they should abyd above the
viij day for iij causes that he assigns / The first is fore to eschew the
peril of death / that he should not deye within the viij days / The second is
for teschewe the pain of the children For in the doing of the circumsicion is
a great pain / And therefore would our lord god / that they were circumcised
whylis they had lytyl ymagynacion / For when they have lytil understanding /
they feel not so much pain / The third cause / for teschewe the heaviness of
the parents / For by the circumsicion many children deyed / And if they had
abyden til they had be gretter / And then deyed / the fader and mother should
have been more soroufull / than they should be at age of viij days The second
cause is understand in spirituel deed / that is to wit / that the viij day is
taken for the resurrexion / which is the vtas of our life / For then shall we
be circumcised fro all pain and fro all myserye / And thus / thies viij days
shall be understood by the viij ages / The first is fro Adam to Noe / The second
fro Noe to abraham / The third fro abraham to Moses / The fourth fro moses
unto David / The fyfte fro David to Ihesu Christ / The vj fro Ihesu Christ unto
the^de of the world / The vij of the deyeng on therthe / And the viij of the
general resurrection to heaven / Or by these viij ben understand viij things
the which we have in the life perdurable / the which saint Austyn reherceth /
in recityng that our lord says / what other thing is it that he says / I
shall be their god / that is that I shall be to them all that / whereof they shall
be full / And all that which by reason they may demand / that is to wete / life
/ health / mete habondance of all glory / honor / and peace / and all goodness /
Or otherwise we may take by the vij days a man in body and in soul / of
which the iiij days ben understand by the iiij elements of which the body
is composed / And iij days / they ben iij virtues naturell that been in the
soul / for to desire or coueyte For to be angry or moeued / For to understand
reason and to conceive it / The man then that now has vij days / when he
shall be joined to god / fro whom the Ioynyng shall never be deffeted / then
shall he have the viij day / And in this viij day he shall be circumcised fro all
sin and from all pain / The third reason is taken after the sens moral /
And after this / the viij days may be taken in diverse purpos / The first may
be said knowledge of his sin / like as david says Quoniam iniquitatem meam
ego cognosco / I have knowlechyng of my sin / The second pourpos / is for to
leave sin / and take the good / the which is showed us by the sone that
dispended his good folyly / And when he had perceived that he had don evil and
folisshly / he advertised him self / and said I shall depart and return to
my fader / And shall pray that I may serve him / and that he receive me to
mercy / and make me as one of his seruau^tis The third is shame of sin /
whereof says saint poul to the^ that for their sins be in pain and in
torment / what fruit have ye founden in tho sins in your life / of which now
ye be ashamed The fourth is dread of the coming Judgment and dome / whereof Job
says / I have fered and doubted god / as men dread the wawes of the sea in
their great rage and tempest / And saint Iherome says thus / Sieve comedam sieve
bibam etc^ As often as I ete or drink / or that I do any other thing / always
me seems that I here the soun and the voys cryeng / Arise ye deed me^ / and
come to the dome and Judgment / The v is concricion / whereof saint Iherome
says / give thy weeping and bytternesse / of that which you have angryd thy god
by thy sin / The vj is confession / whereof david says / dixi confitebor
etc^. I have said and purposed in my heart / that I shall confess me to god and
make knowleche of my sin / The seventh is hope of pardon / For if Judas had
had very repentance and hope / and had confessid his sin / he had had
foryeuenes and pardon / The viij is satisfaction and sacrefyse / And then is
the man verily circumcised / not only fro the sin / but also fro pain /
where the ij first days ben for the sorrow of sin that has be don / and the
will for tamende it the third day we should confess the evil that we have don
/ and the good deeds that we have left / The other iiij days ben oryson /
effusion of teres / Affliction of body / And alms given / Or other wise by
these viij days may be understand viij things / of which the consideracion
cutteth of and takes awey all evil will of sin / And who that shall
co^sidere it / shall have made a great Journey / Of which saint bernard names
vij of them / saying that vij things ben in thessence of a man / that if a man
well considere them / he shall never sin / And they be thies / the unite of our
nature / the vilte and fylthe of our works / The sorrow of our yssuyng / The
mutabylite of our estate / Thangnyssh of the death / The miserable and vnsurete
of our nature of body and of soul / The dampnacion detestable and horrible /
and the consideracion of the glory of heuene / which may not be recounted /
the fourth reason is taken to the understanding espirytuell / And after this /
the five days shall be the five books of moses / in which the law is
contained / And the two other / ben the prophets and the the psalms of david
/ And / the viij shall be the doctrine of the gospellis / but in the first vij
days / the circumcision parfyght was not made / but on the viij day was
parfyght / circumcision of sin and of pain now it is made in hope / After it
shall be don in deed / And of the flessh of the circumcision of Ihesu Christ / it
is said that the a^gel^ brought it to Charlemayn and he bare it to Amcon And
set it there honorably in the church of our lady And after as it is said
that he bare it to Chartres / And now it is said / to be at Rome in the church
that is called sca^ sanctorum / And there it is wreton / yt the precious flessh
of Ihu^ Christ is there right clear / and the nauyll also / Also it is said that
it is in the church of our lady at a^dwarp in braband / And there I know Well
yt on trynyte sunday they show it with great reverence / And is there born
abowte with a great and a solemn procession and that though I be unworthy
have seen diverse times And have read and herd there of many miracles that god
has showed there for it / And as towchyng I have herd say there / that there
was a Cardynal sent fro Rome for to see it / And as he was at his mass
solempnly / it was leyd ^n the corporas at which time it bled three dropes of
blood on the said corporas / There they worship it as fore the flessh of our
lord which was cut of at his circunsicion and named it there prepucium dn^i
/ if it be true / to sum it seems merueyll by cause it is so that the
flessh that was cut of / was of the very flessh that was cut of his body
humayne / Sum hold that when Ihesu Christ aroos fro death to life / that he
returned with the body gloryfyed to his place / Of the vtas of the natyuyte of
Ihesu Christ / that is callid the day of circumsicion / we find that / Ihesu
Christ said by the mouth of his saints / Non v^ni lege^ soluere / sed
adimplere / I came not said Ihu^ Christ to break the law / but to fulfylle it /
And he was that day circcumcised and named Ihesus / which is as much to say
as savior / And at the circumcision / must be cut a litil of the skin at
the end of the membre or yerde / And that is sygnysyrd and shewde that we ought
to be circumcised / and cut and takeen away fro us the sins and evil vices
/ that is to wit Pride / wrath / envy / couetyse / slougth gloute nigh / and
lecherye / and all sins / and purge us by confession / by contrycion / by
satisfaction by almesdedes and by prayers / and to give for gods sake of the
goods that he has lent us / For we have nothing propre / but Ihesu Christ
has lent to us all that we have / then it is well reason / that we do give
for him to the pour of such goods as be his / For we ben but servants /
And we ought to gy / ue to the hungry mete / to the dursty drink / to the
naked clotyng / vysyte the seek And to fore al things to love god / and after
our neyghebours as our sylf / And despoylle our self fro sin / And clothe us
with good works and virtues / And follow the co / mandement of Ihesu Christ /
And in this manner we shall fulfill the will of our fader Ihesu Christ / if we
ben so purged and thus circumcised / Then late us pray unto the lord of
heuene / that says that he came not to break the law / but to fulfill it /
that he give us grace / In such manner to fulfill the law and his will in this
world / that we may come in to his holy bliss in heaven

Amen
Thus ends the fest of the circumcision of our lord
Here follows the fest of the Epiphanie (...) the three kings
THe fest of thepiphanye of our lord is aourned of four miracles / and after
them it has four names / On this day the kings worshipped Ihesu Christ / /
And saint John^ baptyst baptized him / And Ihesu Christ changed this day water
in to win / And he fed five thousand men with five loves of bread / When
Ihesu christ was in the age of xiij days the three kings came to him / the way
like as the sterre led them / And therefore this day is called Epiphanye / or
the tiephanye in common langage / And is said of this term ephi / which is as
much to say as above / And of this term phanes / which is as much to say
as apparicion / For then the sterre appierede aloue them in thayer / where
the same Ihesus by the sterre that was seen above them shewde him to the kings
/ And that day xxix year passed / that whas at thentre of xxx year / For he had
xxix year and xiij days / and began the xxx year as says saint luc / Or after
this that Bid says / he had xxx. year complete as the church of Rome holds
/ And then he was baptized in the flood or river of Jordan / and therefore it
is called thiephanie / said of theos / which is as much to say as god and
phanes / Apparicion / For then god / that is the trynyte appierede / god the
fader in voys god the sone in flessh humayne god the holy ghost in lykenes of a
douue / After this that same day a year when he was xxxj year old and xiij.
days / he turned water in to win / and therefore it is called bethania / said
of beth / that is to say an hows / and phanes / that is apparicion / And this
miracle was done of the wine in an hows by which he shewde him very god / and
this same day ^ year after yt was xxxij year he fed five thousand men with
five loves / like as bede says / And is also songen in an hympne wiche
begins Illuminans altissimus / And therefore it is called phagiphania of phage
/ that is to say mete / And of this fourth miracle some doubt if it were don
on this day / For it is not wreton of bid expressly / And by cause that in
the gospel of saint John^ is red that it was don nyghe unto paske / Therefore
the four apparicions were set on this day / The first by the sterre unto the
crebbe or rack / The second by the voys of the fader on flo^ Jordan / The
third of the water in to wine at the hows of archedeclyn The fourth by the
multiplicacion of five loves in deserte / Of the first apparicion we make
solempnyte on this day pryncipally And therefore poursiewe / we thistorye such
as it is / when our lord was ^orn / the three kings came in to Iherusalem of
whom the names ben wreton in ebrewe / That is to wete Appelyus / Ameryus / and
D^mascus / And in greek / Galagalath / Magalath / and Tharath / And in latin /
Iaspar / Melchior and Baltasar / And it is to wete that this name Magus has
three significacions / It is said illuseur or deceyuour / Enchaunteur / and wise
/ They ben said illuseurs and deceyuours by cause they deceived herodes / For
they returned not by him when they departed fro the place where they had
honored and offered to Ihesus / but returned by another way in to their co^tre
/ Magus also is said enchaunteur / And hereof ben said thenchauntours of pharao
Magi / which by their malefice made their merueylles by the^ chauntyng of the
craft of the devil / And saint Ioh^n Grisostom calls this kings magos / as
wicked and euyldoers /

For first they were full of malefices / but after they were converted / to who^
god would show his natyuyte / and bring them to him / to the end that to sinners
he would do pardon Item Magus is said wise / For Magus in hebrewe is said
doctor in greek philosopher / and in latin wise / whereof they be said magi /
that is to say great in wisdom /

And thies three came in to Iherusalem with a great company and great estate /
But wherefore came they to Iherusalem when the child was not born there / Saint
remyge assygneth four reeasons /

The first reason is that the kings had knouleghe of the natyuyte of the child
that was born of the virgyne marye / ^ But not of the place / And by cause that
Iherusalem was the most cite Ryall /

And there was the Sea of the souerayn priest / they thought that so noble a
child so nobly showed ^ ought to be born in the most noble cite that was ryalle
/ The second cause was / For in Iherusalem were the doctors and the wise men
by whom they might know where the said child was born / The third cause was
to the end that the Jews should have none excusacion / For they might have said
that they had knowleche of the place / where he should be born / but the time
knew they not and therefore they might say w^ ^eleue it not / ^ And the kings
shewde to them the time / and the Jews shewde the place / The fourth to the
doubt of the Jews and their curiosite / for thise kings byleued one only
prophet / And the Jews byleued not many / They sought a strange king / And
the Jews sought not their own king / Thise kings came fro far contrees /
And the Jews were neghbour^ fast by / These kings were successors of balaam
/ ^ And came at the visyon and sight of the sterre / by the prophecy of their
fader which said / that a sterre shall be (...) or spring out of Jacob / and a
man shall arise of the lignage of Israhel ^ That other cause that meueth them
to come to Iherusalem puts saint John^ Crisostome which says That there
were sum that affermeden for truth / that there were great clerks that
curiously studied to know the secrets of heaven / And after they chosen xij of
them / to take heed / And if any of thyem deyede / his sone or next kynnesman
should be set in his place / And thise xij every year / ascended upon a
montayne which was called victoryal / and three days they abode there / and
weesshe them clean / and prayed our lord that he would show to them the sterre
that balaam had said and prophesyed be forn / Now it hapened on a time / that
they were there the day of the natyuyte of Ihesu Christ / and asterre came over
them upon this mo^tayne / which had ye form / of aright fair child and
under his ^ede was a shynyng cross / which spack to thise iij kings saying
Goo ye hastily in to the land of Iudee / And there ye shall find ye king yt
ye s^che which is born of a virgyne / Another cause puts saint Austyn / For
it might well be that the angele of heuene appiered to them which said the
sterre yt ye see / is Ihesu Christ / Goo ye anon and worship him / Another
cause puts saint lion / that by the sterre which appiered to them / which
was more resplendis / shyng and shynyng than the other / that it shewde the
souerayn king to be born on therthe / Then anon departed they for to come to
that place / Now may it be demanded / how in so lytil space of xiij days /
they might come from so far as fro the eest unto Iherusalem / which is in
the myddle of the world / which is a great space and long way / Thereto
answerith saint remyge the doctor and says that the child tho whom they went
/ might well make them to goo somoche way in that while / Or after this that
saint Iherome says / that they came opo^dromedaries / which ben beestis yt may
goo as much in one day as an horse in three days / And when they came in to
Iherusalem / they demanded in what place the king of Jews was born / And
they demanded not if he was born For they byleuyd it fermly / that he was born
/ And if any had demanded of them / where by know ye / that he is born they
would have answered / we have see^ his sterre in thoryent / And therefore we come
to worsshippe him / This is to understand / we being in the oryent saw his
sterre / that shewde that he was born in Iudee / And we be come to worship- him
/ And therefore says this doctor Remyge that they confessid this child very
man / very king / and very god very man when they said / where is he that
is born / very king / when they said king of Jews / very god / when we be
comen to worship him / For there was a commandment / that none should be
worshipped but god / And thus as says saint Johan Crisostome they confessyd
the chlyd / very god / by word / by deed / And by yeftes of their tresours
that they offered to him / and when herod hade herd this / he was much
troubled / And all / Iherusalem with him herod was troubled for three causes /
First by cause he dredde that the Jews would resseyue the child born for their
king / And reffuse him as a stranger whereof says saint John^ crisosto^e in
such wise as the bows of a tree that been hye be soon moeuyd* with the wind
/ so they that been in hye estate of the world a light renomee troubthle them /
Secondly lest he should be blamed of the Rom^ynes / if any were king but if he
were ordained by the emperor / For so had the Romans ordained / that none should
be called lord ne king / but if it were by the commandment of the emperor /
Thirdly he was angry / as saint gregory says / when the king of henen was
born / the king of therthe was troubled and not without cause / For the
erthely lordshyp is counfounded when the hyenes of heuene is declared and
perceived / And all the contree of Jerusalem was troubled with him for three
causes / First by cause that the evil enjoy them not / of the presence ne the
coming of the ryghtfull and just / Secondly for adulacion and flateryng / that
they were sorry of his anger Thirdly for like as the wyndes that been contrary
in the sea as long as the wawes be moeued / In like wise the contraryte of
princes and wrath falls on the people / And therefore they doubted and feered
lest they should be tormented Then herod called all the prestes of the law
/ and doctors / and demanded of them / where Ihesu Christ should be born / And
when he had understand of them that he should be born in bethleem the Cite of
Judah / he called the three kings a part / and demanded of them dylygently
the time that the sterre appiered to them / For to know / what he should do
if the kings returned not again to him / And he said to them / as soon as ye
shall have founden the child / and have worshipped him / that they should return
and show it to him /

In faynyng that he would worship also him / And thought that he would goo sle
him / And it is to wit that as soon as they were entered in to Ihrl^m / the
sight of ye sterre was taken from the^ / and for three causes / First that they
should be co^streyned to seche yt place of his natyuyte like as they were
certefyed by ye appieryng of the sterre / And bye the prophesye of the place of
his birth / and so it was don / Secondly / that they that sought the help and
the world / had deserved to lose the aid dyuyne / The iij. by cause that the
signs by given to mescreauntes / And prophesyes to them that believe well like
as thappostle says And therefore the sign which was given to the three kings
/ which yet were paynems / ought not tappere to them as long as they were
with the Jews / and when they were issued of Iherusalem the sterre appeared to
them wiche went to fore them / and brought them / til it came above the place
were the child was / and ye ought to know yt there ben three opynyons of this
sterre which Remyge ye doc doctor puts saying / that some say that it was
the holy ghost which appiered to the three kings in the form of a sterre
which after appiered upon the hedeof Ihesu Christ in the lykenes of a douue /
Other say / like to saint John^ Crysostom / that it was an angele yt apperyd
to the shepherdes / and after appeared to the kings / but to the shepherdes
Jews / as to them that use reason / in form of a reasonable creature / And to
the paynems as to unreasonable / in lyknesse of nature unreasonable / that is to
say of a sterre / Other say more reasonable and more veritable / that it was a
ster new created and made of god yt which wha^ he had don his office / was
brought again in to ye matter whereof it was first fourmed / And this sterre was
this yt fulgencius says / it differenced fro the other sterres in three things
/ First in situacion / for it was not fyxed in the firmament / but it henge in
thayer nygh to therthe / Secondly in clerenes / for it was shynyng more than
the other / it appiered so that the clerenes of the son myghy not hurt ne
appale her light but at plain mydday it had right great light and clerenes /
Thirdly in moeuyng / for it went allway to fore ye kings in manner of one going
in the way / ne it had none tornyng as a cercle tourneth but in such manner as
a person gooth in the way / And when the kings were issued out of Iherusalem
/ and set in their way / they saw the sterre / whereof they had lost the
sight / And were greatly enjoyed / And we ought to note / that there ben v manners
of sterres that thise kings saw / The first is material / The second
spirituel / The third Intellectuel / The fourth resonnable / The fyfthe
substancyall / The first that is material they saw in theest / The second
that is spirituell / They saw in heart / and that is in the faith / For if this
faith had not be in their hertes that had lighted them they had never seen the
sterre material / they had faith of thumanyte / when they said where is he
that is born and of his Ryall dignyte / when they called him / king of Jews /
And of his deite when they said / they went to worship him / The third /
Intellectuell / wiche is that the aungele that they saw in vysion / when it
was by thangele shewde to them / that they should not return by herod / how
be it / that after one gloss / it was our lord that warned them / The fourth
/ that was reasonable that was the vyrgyne marye whom they saw in the stable
holdyng her child / The fyft that is substancyal / that is to say that he had
substance above all other singular / And that was Ihu^ Christ who^ they saw in
the crybbe / And hereof is it said in the gospel / that they entered in to the
house / and fond the child with marie his mother / And then they worshippid
him And when they were re entered in to the hows secretly / And had founden the
child they kneled and offered to him thies three yeftes / that is to wete / Gold
/ Encence / And myrre And this says saint Austyn O infancia cui astra
subduntur et cetera O infancy or chyldhode to whom the sterres ben subgette /
to whose clothes Angellis bow / the sterres given virtue / the kings Ioyen /
And the folowers of wysedom bowen their knees / O blessed tygurye or lytyl hows
/ O holy sete of god / And saint Iherome says / this is an heuene / wh^re is
no light but the sterre / O palace celestyall in which thou dwell / not as
a king ^ourned with precious stones / but encorporat / to whom for a soft
bed was duresse and hard cribb. For curteyns of gold and sylke / the fume and
stenche of donge / but the sterre of heuene was clearly embelysshed / I am
abashed when I behold thise clothes and see the heuene / the heart brenneth
me for hete / when I see him in the cryb be a pour mendiuau^t / and over him
the sterres / I see him right clear / right noble and right rich / O ye kings
what do ye / ye worship the child in a lytyl foul house wrapped in foul
clowtes / is he then not god / ye offer to him gold / and whereof is he king
/ and where is his ryall halle / where is his trone / where is his court ryall
frequented and used with nobles The stable / is that not his hall / And his
trone yt rack or crybbe / They that frequente this court / is it not Joseph
and marye / they ben as vnwetyng / to the end that they become wise / of whom
says hillarye in his second book that he made of the trynyte / the virgyne
has born a child / but this that she has chylded is of god the child is
lyeng in the rack / and thangeles ben herd singing and preysyng him / the
clothes be foul and god is worshipped / The dygnyte of his puissaunce is not
take awey / though thumy lite of his flesh is declared / lo how in this child
Ihesus were not only the humble and small things / but also ye rich and /
the noble and the hye things and hereof says saint Iherome upon the epistle ad
hebreos / Thou beholdest the ^ake of Ihesu Christ / See also the heaven / Thou
see also the child lyeng in the crybbe / but take heed also how the aungelles
sing and preyse god / herod is persecuted / And the kings worsshippe the
child / The pharysees knew him not / but the sterre shewde him / he is
baptized of his seruau^te / but the voys of the fader is herd above thondryng /
he is plonged in the water / but the holy ghost descended upon him in lyknes of
a douue / and the cause wherefore thise kings offered thise yeftes / many
reasons be assygned / One of the cause is as says Remyge the doctor / that
thau^cyent ordenaunce was / that noma^ should come to god ne to the king with a
void hand / but that he brought him some yefte / And they of caldee were
acoustomed to offer such yeftes / They as scolastica historia says came from
thend of perse fro the caldeyens where as is the flood of saba / of which
flood the regyon of saba is named / The second reason is of saint bernarde /
For they offered to marye the mother of the child gold for to releue her pouerte
/ Encence against the stenche of the stable and evil air / Mirre for to
comfort the tender members of the child and to put away vermin / The third
reason was that they offered gold for to pay the trybute Thencence for to make
sacrefice the myrre for the sepulture of deed men / The fourth for the gold
sygnefyeth dilection or love / Thencence oroyson or prayer / The myrre of the
flesh mortyfycacyon / And thies three things ought we offer to god / Te
fyfthe by cause by these three / ben sygnefyed three things that been in Ihesu
christ / The precious deyte / The soul full of holiness / And thentier flessh
all pure and without corrupcion / And thise iij things be signefyed / that
were in tharke of moses / The Rod which florisshid / that was the flessh of
Ihesu christ that Roos fro death to life / The tables wherein the comandementis
were wreton that is the soul / wherein ben all the tresours of sapience and
science of god hid / The manna signefyeth the godhede which has all
swetenes of suauite By the gold which is most precious of all metallis is
understand the deyte / by thencence the soul right devout / For thencence
signifies devotion and oroyson / by the myrre wiche preserves fro corrupcion
/ is understand the flesh which was without corrupcion / And the kings
when they were admonested and warned by reuelacion in their sleep / that they
should not return by herod / and by an other way they should return in to
their contre / lo here then how they came and went in their Iourneye / For
they came to adoure and worship the king of kings in their propre persons
/ by the sterre that led them / and the prophet that enseygned and taught them
/ And by the warnyng of thangele returned / And rested at their death in Ihesu
Christ / of whom the bodies were brought to melane / where as now is the
conuente of the freres precho^^s / And now ben at coloyne in saint peter's
church which is the cathedral / and see of tharchebisshop / Then ne late us
pray unto almighty god yt this day showed him to thise kings / And at his
baptesme / where the voys of the fader was herd and the holy ghoost seen / And
at the feast turned water in to win / and fed five thousand men beside wymen
and children with v. loves and two fysshes that at the reverence of this hye
and great feste / he forgive us our trespaces and sins that after this short
life we may come tohis everlasting bliss in heaven /

Amen
Thus ends the fest of Epyphanye and of the three kings
Here begins Septuagesme
AT Septuagesme begins the time of deuiacio^ or going out of the way of the
world / which began at Adam and dured unto moses / And in this time is read
the book of genesis / The time of septuagesme represents the time of
deuyacio^ that is of transgression / The sexagesme sygnefyeth the time of
reuocacion / The quinquagesme signefieth the time of remyssion / The
quadragesme signefieth of penance and satisfaction / The septuagesme begins
when the church syngeth in thoffyce of the mass circu^dederunt me / and
endures unto the saturday after ester day / The septuagesme was institued for
three reasons / like as mastre Ioh^n beleth puts in thoffyce of the church /
The first reason was for the redemption / For the holy fadres sometime ordained
that for thonour of thascencion of Ih^u christ In the which our nature ascended
in to heaven / And was enhaunsed above thangeles / yt this day should be hallowed
solempnly / And should be kept fro fasting / And at the beginning of the
church also solemn as the sunday / And procession was made / in representyng
the procession of thappostles / which they made on that day / or of tha^gellis
that came to mete him and therefore comenly the proverb was / that the thursday
and the sunday were cosyns / For then that one was as solemn as that other
/ but by cause yt the festes of saints came and ben multeplyed which were
grievous to halowe so many festes / therefore the feste of the thursday cessed /
And for to recompense that / there is a weke of abstynence ordained like to
lent / and is called septuagesme / That other reeason is for the sygnyficacion
of the time / For by this time is signefyed to us the time of deuiacion / of
going out of the way of eyxle / and of tribulacion of thumayne lignage / fro
sith Adam unto the end of the world / Which exile is hallowed upon the
reuolucion of vij days / and of vij.M. year / vndersto^de^ by lxx days or
lxxC. yeris / For fro the beginning of the world unto thascencion / we acounte
vj thousand year / and of the rest that we rekene it for the seventh thousand /
of which god knows only the term / Now it is so that Ihesu christ bought us
out of this exile in the vj age / in hope of perpetuel life / of all them that
be reuested with the vesture of Innocence / by bapteme we ben regenerate / And
when we shall have passed the time of this exyle he shall clothe us of double
vesture / that is to wete of body and soul in glory / and in the time of
deuyacion and of exyle we leave the song of gladness / that is alleluya / but
the saturday of ester we sing one alleluya / In enioyeng us and thankyng god
of the vesture perpetuel which by hope we abide for to recouure in the sixth
age / And in the mass we set a tracte / In fyguryng the labor that yet we
ought to do and in fulfyllyng the comandemens of god / And the double Alleluya
that we sing after ester / sygnefyeth the double vesture tht we shaal have in
body and in soul The third Reason is for representacion / For the septuagesme
represents lxx* year / in which the children of Israhel were in babilone in
seruytude / And in such manner that they cast away / and left their usage of
song of gladness saying / Quomodo cantabimus canticum domini etc^ Thus leave
we the song of preysyng and of gladness / After license was given to them to
return / in the time of Sexagesme / and begone then to Joy and so we do
the satirday of ester / as in the year of Sexagesme we sing Alleluya / in
representyng their Joy and gladness how well in the retornyng / they had pain
and sorrow to take their things and bear with them / therefore we sing anon
after the tracte which follows the alleluya / And in the saturday after ester
in which Sptuagesme is complete we sing double Alleluya / in fyguryng the
plain gladness that they had / when they were returned in to their contree /
And this time thus of the seruytude of the children of Israhel represents the
time of our pylgremage of the life of this world / For thus as they were
delyuerd in the syxtyth / so were we in the syxte age / And as they had pain
in gadryng and assemblyng their things for to bear with them / So have we in
fulfyllyng the comandements of god / And like as they were in rest when they
came in to their contre / and in gladness and in Joy / in like wise we sing
double alleluya / yt betokens double Joy / that we shall have / as well in
body as in soul / In this time then of exile of the church full of many
tribulacions / and as thrown out in to the depenesse of desperacion almost and
despayr sigheth for sorrow in saying thoffyce of the mass Circundederunt me
gemitus mortis / etc^ And shows many demonstracions that she suffers / as
well for the myserye yt she had deserved by sin As for the double pain that
she is run in / and as for the trespass to her neighbor / but all way for as
much as she fall not in despayr / is purposed to her in the gospel and
epistle three manner of Remedies / The first is / that if she will issue of these
t^ybulacions / that she labor in the vygneyerde of her soul in cuttyng and
pullyng out the vices and the sins / And after in the way of this present
life she seche the werkys of penance / And after that in doing spyrytuel
bataylle / she defend her strongly against the temptacions of thenemye / And if
she do these iij. things / she shall have threfold reward For in labouryng god
shall give her ye penny / and in well rennyng the prys / And in well fyghtyng the
crown / And by cause that septuagesme sygnefyeth the time of our captyuyte /
the remedy is purposed to us / By the which we may be delyuerd / in fleyng
the myserye by rennyng / by vyctorye in fyghtyng / and by the penny in us again
being /

Here ends the mysterye of Septuagesme
Of Sexagesme
THe Sexagesme begins when is song in the church at office of the mass
Exurge domine / And this ends the wednesday after ester day / And was
instytued for redemption / for sygnefycacion / and for representacion / For
redempcio^ it was instytued For Melchisedech the (...) and syluestre Institued
that men should ete twyes on the saturday / to the end that they yt that had
fasted the friday / which should all way be fasted / were not grieved / And in
rechaet them of the saterdayes of this time / they adiousted and Joined a weke
of the lent thereto / And called it sexagesme / That other reason for
signeficacion / For that time sygnefyeth the time of wedowhed of the church /
and the wayllyng of the same for thabsence of here spouse / Wiche was rauishid
in to heaven There be ij wings given to ye church The j is thexercitacio^ of vj
werkis of mercy and ye fulfyllyng of ye x co^mademe^ts of ye law / for sixti
make six sithes ten. And by six be understand the vj works of mercy / and by
ten / the n comandementis of the law / The third reason is for representacion
/ For the sexagesme represents also the mysterye of redemption / For by ten.
is understand the man / which is the tenth penny / which is made and formed to
that / that he be the reparacion of ix ordres of angellis / or for that he is
fourmed of four qualytees / to the body / And to the soul / he has iij
powers that is to wete / memory / understanding / and will / which ben made
that he serve the blessed trynyte / to the end that we believe fermly in him /
and love him ardantly and dylygently we have and hold him in our mind / By
six / ben understand vj mysteryes / by the which the man is redemyd by Ihesu
christ / the which ben / the Incarnacion / the Natyuyte / the passion / his
discencion in to hell / his resurrexion / And his ascencion in to heuene / And
by cause that the sexagesme stratcheth unto the wednesday after ester / that
day is songen venite benedicti etc^. For they that fulfylle the works of merci
shall here in the end / venite / as Ihesu christ witnesses / And then shall the
door be opened to the spouse / And embrace god her spouse / And it is warned in
a pystle / that she should beer patiently tribulacion as saint poul did / in
thabsence of her espouse / and in the gospel / that she be always ententif to
sow good works / And that she that had songen as despayred / Circundederunt
me gemitus mortis / Now return for to demand that she be helped in her
trybulacions / and require to be delyuerd in saying / Exurge domine adiuua etc^
which is the beginning of thoffice of the mass And this does holy church in
three manners / For sum ben in holy church that been oppressed of aduersite /
but they ben not cast out / And some that been not oppressed / ne cast out /
And sum that been oppressyd and cast out / And by cause that they may not
bear aduersitees it is to dread / and great peril lest the prosperitees all to
break them / wherefore holy church cries that he arise / as to the first in
confortyng them / for it seems that he slepeth / when he delyuereth them not /
She cries also as to the second / yt he arise in conuertyng them / fro whom
it seems / that he tourneth his face fro them in puttyng them fro him / She
cries also as to the third / that he arise in helpyng them in prosperity /
And in delyueryng them /

Here ends the mysterye of: sexagesme
Of quinquagesme
tHe quinquagesme dureth fro the sunday / in which is songe^ in the church in
thoffyce of the mass / Esto mihi etc^: And that ends on ester day / and is
Iustitued for supplecion and fulfyllyng for signeficacion / and for
representacion for fulfyllyng and accomplysshyng / by cause that we should fast
four^y days after the form of Ihesu christ / And there be but xxxvj days to
fast but me^ fast not the sondayes / for the gladness and the reverence of
the resurrexion / and also for thensaunple of Ihu^ christ which ete two times
with his disciples on the day of his resurrexion / when he entered in where his
discples were / and the doors or yates shytte / And they brought him part of a
roasted fyssh and of an honey comb / And after that with his ij disciples which
went to Emaus / He ete also as some say / And therefore ben four days put to
for aco^plysshyng of the sondayes which be not fasted / And after by cause the
clergy goon by fore the common people so should they goo in devotion and
holiness / therfo they begynye to fast two days before / and absteyne them
fro etyng flessh / And thus is one weke putto / which is called the
qunquagesme after this that saint ambrose says / that other reason is for the
signeficacion for ye quynquagesme signefyeth the time of remyssion / And of
penance / in which the sins ben pardonned and foryeue^ The fyftythe year
was the year of remyssyon / For then the dettes were quyted / The bond men
were fraunchised and let goo free / And eueryche came again to his heritages /
by which is understand / that by penance our sins be foryeuen / And fro
the servitude and bondage of our enemy we be delyuerd / And so we ben
returned to the mansion of our heritage of heaven / The third reason is for
representacion / For the quynquagesme represents not to us only the time of
remyssyon / But also thestate of the beatitude of heuene which is to us
represented / For in the fyftyth year servants were made free / And in the
fyftyth day that the la^be was sacrefyed the law of moses was given / And the
fyftyth day after the holy ghost was given / And therefore this name fyfty
represents the beatitude of heaven / where as was taken the possession of
liberte the knowleche of verite / and perfection of charity / Now it is to wete
/ that three things ben necessary which be contained and set in thepystle /
and in the gospel / that is that penance / that is to say the works of
penance ben perfyght / That is to wete / charity / which is purposed in the
epistle / And the memory of the passion of Ihesu christ / and faith which is
understand / by the sight given to the blind man / which ben contained in
the gospel / For faith / makes the works acceptable to god / For without
faith noman may plese god / and the mind of the passion of god makes tho
works light / whereof says saint gregory / if the passion of Ihesu christ be
well had in mind / there is nothing but it may be born and suffered easily For
the love of god may not be idle / this says saint gregorye / if it work it is
great / And if it refuse / it is no love / And thus as the church at the
beginning / as despayrede had cried / Circundederunt me gemitus mortis / and
after retornyng to him demanded to be helped / Thus now when she has take
affyaunce and hope of pardon / for hope of penance she prays and says /
esto mihi in deum protectorem / Or she demands iiij things / that is to
wete protection / confirmacion / refuge and conduyte / All the children of the
church / or they ben in grace / or they ben in sin / or in aduersyte / or in
prosperity / They that been in grace demand for to be confermed / They that been
in sin demand refuge / They in aduersyte demand protection / that they
fro their tribulations may be defended / and they in prosperity demand
conduyte / that they ^ay be of god led and conduyte And thus as it is said
quynquagesme termineth And ends at ester by cause that penance makes them
to rise to new life / And in signeficacion hereof / the psalm of miserere mei
deus / which is the fyftyth psalm / And the psalm of penance is in the time
of lent often used and said

Thus ends the mysterye of quanquagesme
Of quadragesme
THe quadragesme which we call now in englyssh / lent / bygynneth the sunday
in which is songen in thoffyce of the mass / Inuocauit me etc^ / And the
church which was much troubled to fore by so many trybulacions and had cried
/ Circundederunt me / And after in respyryng and syghyng had axyd help in
saying / Exurge domine / Now she shows that she is herd / when she says he
has called me / and I have herd / Now it is to understand / that the
quadragesme conteyneth xlij days / For to acounte the sondayes / And if they
be not rekened / there ben but xxxvj days for to fast / which ben the thenthe
part of the days of the year / But the four days to fore ben put to / by
cause the nombred sacred by the quadragesme be accomplysshyd / the which our
saueour Ihesu Christ hallowed by his holy fasting And by cause we fast in this
nombre of forty / there may be assygned three reasons / The first reason puts
saint Austyn which says / that saint matthew sets xl generacions / to
the end the^ that our lord by his holy quadragesme desse^ded to us / we should
assende to him by our quadragesme / That other assigns the same saying / To
that we may have the quynquagesme / We must put to xl ten / For unto that /
that we may com to the blessed glory and rest in heaven / it behooves us to
labor all the time of this present life / And therefore our lord alode xl
days with his dissiples after his resurection / and after the tenth day he
sent to them the holy ghost / The third reason assigns master prepositiuus in
ye so^me of thoffice of the church which seyeth / The world is divided in to
iiij parties / And the year in to iiij times / and the man of iiij elementis
and iiij complexions is composed / And we have the new law which is ordained
of four evangelists / And the x co^maundementis that we have broken It
behooves the^n that the nombre of ten by the nombre of iiij be multiplied /
that thus we make the quadragesme / that we fulfiyll the co^mandementis of the
old law and new Our body as said is / is composed of iiij elementis / like
as they had iiij setes in our body / That is to wete the fire which is in the
eyes / thayer in the tongue and eeres / the water in the natural members named
genitoires / And the earth has dominacion in the hondes and other members /
Then in the eyes is curiosite / in the tongue and eeris is scurilite / In the
naturel members that is to say genitoires / voluptuosite / And in the hands
and other members / cruelte / and thise iiij things confessid the publicane
when he prayed god / he held him a far in confessyng his luxurye / which is
stynkyng / like thus as he said / Sire I dare not approach to the / For I might
stynke in thy nose / and by cause he durst not lift up his eyes / he confessed
curiocite / And in that he smote him self on the breast / he confessed cruelte /
And wha^ he said deus propicius esto michi peccatori he confessed the crime and
glotonie which we ought to repress / Saint gregorye in his omelyes puts
also three reasons / wherefore in abstinence is holden the nombre of xl / For the
virtue of the x comaundementis in the law / And for thaccomplysshement of the
iiij books of theuangelistes / And also in this world we that been in mortal
body be compo^^d of the iiij elementis / And by the will of the mortal body /
we gaynsay the commandments of god therefore then we yt have disobeyed the
co^nau^deme^tis of god by ye desire of ye flessh / it is cordyng yt ye same
flessh by iiij times x We put to penance and affliccyon / fro this present day
unto ester vj wekes coming that been xlij days / If the sondayes be taken away
/ There abide in thabstynence but xxxvj days / And the year is demened by iij
hundred sixty and v days / we given the tithe of them to god when we fast /
And this says saint gregorye / wherefore keep we not this fasting / in the time
that Ihu^ christ fasted which was anon after his baptesme / But we begin so
that we continue until ester / hereof ben assigned iiij reasons in the so^me of
thoffice of master Ioh^n bethel / in thoffice of the church Tle first is that
we will arise with Ihu^ Christ / For he suffrid for us / And we ought to suffer
for him / The second is To that we should follow the children of Israel which
first issued out of egipte / And in this time issued also out of babylone / the
which thing appiereth / For as well that one as that other / anon as they were
returned / hallowed the solempnyte of ester / Andthus we for to ensue them in
this time we fast to the end that fro egipte and fro babilone that is to
understand from this mortal world in to the contraye of our heritage of heaven
we may enter / The third reason is / by cause that in the prym temps the hete
of the flessh meueth and boyleth / to thend that we may refrain us / there in
this time we fast / The fourth is / for asmoche as anon after our fasting / we
ought receive the body of Ihesu crist / For in like wise as the children of
Israhel to fore they had eten the lomb / they put them in afflicion by penance
/ in etyng wild letuse and bitter / right so we ought to withdraw and put us
in affliction by penance / to the end that the more worthily we may take and
receive the lombe of life Amen

Thus ends the misterye of the quadragesme
The ymbre days
THe fasting of the quatee temps called in englyssh ymbre days / the pope
Calixte ordained them / And this fast is kept iiij times in the year / and
for diverse reasons / For the first time which is in march / is hot and
moist The second in somer / is hot and dry The third in heruest / is cold /
and dry The fourth in winter / is cold and moist / Then late us fast in
march / which is prymtemps / for to repress the hete of the flessh boylyng /
and to aque^che luxurye or tattempre it / In somer we ought to fast / to
the end that we chastyse the brennyng and ardour of avarice In harvest for to
repress the drought of pride / and in winter for to chastyse the coldness of
untruth and of malice The second reason why we fast iiij times for these
fastings here begin in march in the first weke of the lent / to the end
that vices wexe dry in us / For they may not all be quenchid / Or by cause
that we cast them away / And the bows and herbs of virtues may grow in us /
And in somer also in the whitson weke / For then comes the holy ghost / And
therefore we ought to be fervent and esprysed in the love of the holy ghost /
They be fasted also in Septembre to fore mychelmas / And thise be the third
fastings / by cause that in this time / the fruytes ben gadred / and we should
render to god the fruytes of good works / In decembre they ben also And they
ben the fourth fastings and in this time the herbs deyen / And we ought to be
mortefyed to the world / The third reason is fore tensiewe the Jews / For the
Jews fasted four times in the year / that is to wete to fore ester / to fore
whitsontyde / to fore the set tyng of the tabernacle in the temple / in
septembre / And to fore the dedicacion of the temple in decembre / The fourth
reason is by cause the man is composed of iiij elementis touching the body /
and of three virtues or powers in his soul that is to wete the understanding /
the will / and the mind / To this then that this fasting may attempre in us
iiij times in the year / at each time we fast three days / to the end that the
nombre of four may be reported to the body / and the nombre of three to the
soul / Thise ben the reasons of master beleth / The v reason as says John^
damascenus / in march and in prymtemps the blood grows and augmenteth and in
somer colere / In septembre melancolye / And in winter flewme / then we fast
in march for tattempre and depresse the blood of concupiscence / disordynate /
for sanguyne of his nature is full of flesshly concupiscence / In somer we fast
/ by cause that colere / should be lessed and refreyned / of which comes wrath
/ And then is he full naturelly of ire / In heruest we fast for to refrain
melancolye / the melancolyous man naturelly is cold covetous and heavy / In
winter we fast for to daunte and to make feeble the flewme of lyghtnes and
forgetyng / For such is he that is fleumatyke / The sixte reason is for the
prymtemps is lykened to the air the somer to fire the heruest to therthe / and
the winter to water / Then we fast in march to the end that the air of
pride be attemperat to us / In somer / the fire of concupiscence and of auaryce
/ In septembre the earth of coldenesse and of the derknes of Ignorance / In
winter the water of lightness and Inconstaunce / The vij reason is by cause /
that march is reported to Infancye / Somer to yongthe / Septembre to steadfast
age and virtuous / And winter to auncyente or old age / We fast then in
march that we may be in thynfancye of Innocencye / In somer for to be young by
virtue and consta^ce / In heruest that we may be ripe by at te^peraunce in
winter yt we may be ancient and old by prudence and honest life / or at
lest that we satysfye to god of that which in thise iiij seasons we have
offended him / The viij reason is of maystre guylliam dancerre / We fast says
he in thise iiij times of the year / to the end that we make amends for all
that we have faylled in all thise iiij times / and they be don in three days
each time / to the end that we satisfye in one day / that / which we have
faylled in a month and yt which is the fourth day that is wednesday / is the
day in which our lord was betrayed of Judas / and the friday by cause our lord
was crucified and ye saturday / by cause he lay in ye sepulcre / and
thappostles were for of heart and great sorrow /

Thus ends the ymbre days


THe Passion of our lord was bitter for the sorrow that he suffered in derysions
despituous / And of many fylthes fructuous / The sorrow was cause of five
things The first by cause it was shamefulle / for the place of the mount of
caluarye where as malefactors and crymynel persons were put to execucion /
And he was there put to death right foull / the cross was the tormente of
thieves / And if the cross was then of shame and of vylonye / she is now of
glory and of honor / whereof says saint Austyn / Crux latronum qui erat
supplicium etc^ / The cross which was the Justice of theuys / is now become
the sign of glory in the forhedes or frontes of emperors / And if he had
such honor at his tormente / what did he to his servant / for the shameful
felawshp that he did to him / for he was set with malefactors / but the one
of them was converted / which was called dysmas / like as it is said in the
gospel of Nychodemus And he was on the right side of our lord / And that other
on the lift s^de was dampened which was callid gesmas / To that one then he
gaf the royame of heuene / and to that other hell / whereof says saint Ambrose
/ Auctor pietatis in cruce etc^ / he says / the auctour of pity hangyng on the
cross divided offices of p^te in scculyer erandes / that is to say / The
persecucion to thapostles / peace to his disciples / his body to the Jews his
spyryte to the fader / to the vyrgyne the messages of the weddyng of the
souerayn espouse / To the thief peradys / To sinners hell / And to the Christian
penytent he commanded the cross / Loo this is the testament that Ihesu christ
made hangyng in the cross / Secondly the sorrow was caused Iniustly / For none
iniquite was found in him / And pryncypally Iniustly they accused him of three
things / The first was / they said / that he deffended to pay the trewage /
and for he said that he was a king / and he said him to be the sone of god /
And against these three accusacions we say on the good friday three excusacions
in the person of Ihesu crist / When we sing popule meus / Where Ihesu crist
repreued them of three benefetes that he did and gaf to them / that is to wete
the delyueraunce of them fro Egypt the sustentacion and the governance in
deserte / And the plantacion of the vigne in a land propyce / like as Jesus
christ would say / thhou accusest me / by cause that I deffende to pay thy
trewage / And thou ought more to thank me of that I have delyuerd the fro
the trewage and fro the scruytude of pharao / and of Egypt / Thou accusest me
/ that I call my self king and thou ought better to yield me thankynges /
of that which I governed the in deserte with mete royalle / Thou accusest me
of this that I say me to be the sone of god / And thou ought more to thank
me that I have chosen the to be in my vygne yerde / and in a right good place /
I have planted them / The third cause is / by cause he was despyted and
forsaken of his friends / which seemed a thing more tolerable to be suffered of
his enemies / than of them whom he held to be his fre^des / And alleway he
suffered death for his friends / and his neighbors / that is of the^ of whose
lignage he was born This said he by the mouth of david / Amici mei and proximi
etc^. My friends and my neighbors have approcheed against me and so have
continued / whereof said Job capitl^o xxx. Noti mei quasi aliem recesserunt a me
/ My neighbors that knew me as strangers have left me / Item he suffered of
the^ to whom he had don much good like as saint Ioh^n records Ioha^nis viij
/ I have wrought many good things to you / and herto says saint bernard O
good Ihesu how swetely have thou conuersyd with men And how great things in
the most haboundau^t wise have thou granted to them / how hard and sharp /
things have thou suffered for the^ / hard words / harder strokes and betynges
/ and most hard torments of the cross / nevertheless they render and yield to
the the contrary The fourth cause is for the tendrenes of his body / whereof
david says in figure of him in the second book of kings / he is like as ye
most te^dre worm of the wode / whereof said saint bernard / O ye Jews ye be
stones / but ye smite a better stone / whereof resowneth the sown of pity / and
boylleth the oil of charity / and saint Iherome says / he is delyuerd to
knights for to ^e beten / and their betyngis have cruelly wounded and torn
the most precious body in whose breast ye godhed was hydd / The fyfth cause was
by cause she was general for it was ouerall / that is to say oueral his body
/ and in all the naturell wits of his body / And first the sorrow was in his
eyes / For he wept tendrely as saint poul says in his epistle ad hebros /
twyes he ascended on heyght that he might be far herd / he cried strongly /
by cause none should be excused / he added thereto weeping that we should have
compassion / and to te^dre our hertis / and he had wept to for ij times also
one time wha^ he raised lazare / and that other time wha^ he approchyd Ihrl^m
he wept / the first teres were of love / whereof is said in ye gospel / behold
how he loved him / The second were of compassion / upon Ihrl^m / But this
third weeping teres were of sorrow / Secondly the sorrow was in heeryng with his
eeris yt repreues and vylonyes that was said to him and blasphemyd / Ih^u crist
in especial had iiij things in which he herd blasphemies and repreues / for
he had right excellent noblesse / as to ye nature dyuyne / he was sone of the
king perpetuell souerayn / and as to the nature humayne he was born of the
lygnage ryall / and as to this he was also king of kings / and lord of lords
/ he was also sovereign truth / For he is the way / the life / and the
truth / whereof he said him self Thy word is truth / The sone of god / that
is the word of god the fader / he has also souerayn power above all other /
For none may surmounte him / For all things ben made by him / and naught is
made without him / he has also synguler bounte / For there is none good of him
self / but god only / And in these four things here / Ih^u christ had
opprobryes and blasphemies First as to his noblesse whereof is said in saint
matthew capl^o xiij / Is not this the sone of the smyth said they And we know
well his mother called marye / Secondly as to his power / whereof is said also in
saint matthew / This same casts out the fendes of the bodies in the power of
the prince of deuellis / And in an other place of matthew the xxvij chapitre he
has saved other / and he may not save him self / And nevertheless with his only
voys he made his persecutours fall down to the earth / when he demanded them
in the gardyne whom seche ye / They answered / Ihesu of nazareth / and when he
said / I am / they fill down to therthe / whereof says saint austyn / One only
voys without any darte smote a cruel company full of hate / dreadful by arms
down to the ground and put them aback / by the virtue of the godhede hyd in him
/ what shall he do when he shall Judge / him that has don so that he ought to be
Iuged what shall he mow dooo when he shall regne / that has don this / when he
should deye / Thirdly he suffrid obprobryes as to the veryte / whefro is said in
saint John^ / Thou bereft wytnes of thy self / and thy witness is not true /
lo how they said him to be a liar / when it is so that he is way truth / and
life / This verite and truth pilate deserved not to know ne to understand /
For after truth he Iuged him not / he began his Judgment with truth but he
perseuered not / For he made his questyon saying / what is truth / but he
abode not the solucyon / ne he was not worthy to here it / saint austyn says
that he abode not the solucion / by cause that so sone as he had made the
question / It came in his tought that the custom was of the Jews / that one
should be delyuerd to them at paske / And therefore he went out anon and abode
not the solucion The third cause is after saint John^ crysostome For the
question was so great and of so great difficulte / that he had need of long
time to advise and to discuss it / And he labored for the delyueraunce of
Ihu^ Christ / And therefore he issued out anon / Nevertheless it is read in the
gospel of nicodemus that Ihesu crist answered / veritas de celo est / And pilate
said in earth is no truth / and Ihu^s said to him how may be truth in
earth which in earth is Iuged of the^ that have power in earth / Fourthly he
suffered blasphemye as to his bounte and goodness / For they said that he was a
man synnar and deceyuor in his words luce xij / he has moeuyd the common people
with his doctrine in beginning from galyle hither / And has broken the
co^mandemens of the law / for he keeps not the sabat day / Iohannis nono /
Thirdly the sorrow was in smellyng of thordure and fylthe / For he might smell
great stenche on the mount of caluarye / where as were the bodies of deed men
stynkyng whereof is said in scolastica historia / that Caluarye is the bone of
the head all bare / And by cause that many were there byheded / and many
skulles of heedes were there sparteled all openly they said that it was the
place of caluarye / Fourtly the sorrow in tastynge / whereof he cried Scicio / I
am a thirst / There was given to him vynaygre meddled with myrre and galle / to
the end that he should the sonner deye and the kepars might the sonner depart /
and goothens / For it is said by vynaygre men deye much soon / And with this
also they gaf to him myrre / For to have the more pain for the byternesse of
the myrre and of the galle / whereof says saint Austyn / his purete was
fulfilled with vynaygre instead of wyn / his swetenes with galle / thynnocent
is set for gylty / and the life deyeth for death / Fyftly the sorrow was in
towchyng / for in all the parties of his body / he was towched and wounded /
fro the plant of his foot / unto the top of his heed was none hole place /
And how he suffered sorrow in all his naturel wits / saint bernard tells /
that says / The head that made angelis to tremble is perced and prycked with
the qualite of sharp thorns / the visage which was most fair of all other
members / is fowled byspette and hurt with the thorns of ye Jews The eyes
more shynyng than the son ben extynct in the death / The eeris here not the
song of thangellis / but thassaultes of the sinners / The mouth that techeth
and enseygneth thangelis is made drink vynaygre and galle / The feet of whom
the stappes ben worshipped / ben atached with nails to the cross / The hands
that fourmed the heuenes ben stratched on the cross and naylled with nails
The body is beten The side is perced with a spear / And what may more be said /
there abode nothing sauf the tongue for to pray for the sinners / And for to
recomende his mother to his disciple / Secondly his passion was despited of
mocqueries and derysions of the Jews / Fore four times he was mocqued First
at house of anne / where he received spyttynges / buffetes and blyndfellyng of
the Jews / werof saint bernard says Right sweet and good Ihesu / thy desirous
vysage / which angellis desire to see the Jews / with their spyttynges have
defoylled / with their hands have smeton with a veyl for torn they have couerd
/ ne they have not spared to hurt it with byttyr wounds / Secondly he was
mocqued in the house of herod / which reputed him for a fool and alyend fro
his wit / by cause he might have of him none answer / And by derysyon he was
clad with a white vesture whereof says saint bernard / Tues homo etc^ / he
says thus Thou art a man and have a chapelet of flowers / And I am god / and
have a chapelet of thorns / Thou have gloves on thyn hondes / And I have the
naylles fyxed in mine hondes / Thou daunsest in white vestures And I god am
mocqued And vilipended / and in the hows of herod had received a white vesture
/ Thou daunsest and playest with thy feet And I with my feet have labored in
great pain / Thou lyftest up thyn arms in Joy / And I have stratched them in
great repreef / Thou stratchest out thyn arms a cross in carollyng and
gladness / And I stretche mine in the cross in great obprobrye and vylonye /
Thou have thy side and thy breast open in sign of vayn glory And I have mine
opened with a spear / Nevertheless return to me / and I shall receive the / But
why and wherefore Ihesus in the time of his passion to fore herod / pilate / and
the Jews was thus stylle and spack not / there ben three reasons and Causes /
The first was by cause they were not worthy to hiere his answer / The second
was by cause eve sinned by spekyng / and Ihesus would make satisfaction by being
stylle and not spekyng / The third is by cause / that all that ever he answered
/ they perverted it / Thirdly Ihesus was moqued in the house of pylate / For
they clad him with a read mantel / And in his hand they took him a reed / And
set upon his heed a crown of thorns / And kneled on their knees to fore him
saying / hayll king of Jews / This crown was of Ionkes of the sea / And we
hold and say that the blood sprang out of his head / whereof says saint
bernard / Caput illud diuinum etc^ / The heed precious and dyuyne was percyd
with thorns unto the brain / of the soul / There ben three opynyons in what
place pryncipally the soul has her place / or in the heart / for the
scripture says / Cut of the heart come^ the evil thougthes / Or in the blood /
by cause the scripture says / the soul of euerych is in the blood / or in the
head / by cause theuangeliste says / when he enclyneth his head / he rendered
his spyryte / and this treble opinion it seems that the Jews had known / For
when they would make the soul issue out of the body / they sought it in the
head when they thrested the thorns to ye brain / They sought in the blood /
when they opened his veins in the feet and hands / And they sought it in the
heart / when they perced his side / Against thise three Illusions / on good
friday to fore the cross is showed / we make three adoracions in saying / Agyos
/ Otheos / yskyros etc^ in honoring him three times / like as he was for us
moqcued and scorned on the cross Fourthly he was scorned on the cross The
princes of ye priests with thold men and maistres of the law clerks and
doctors said to him / if he be king of Israhel late him desce^de fro ye
cross now to the end that we believe in him / whereof says saint bernard / In
that Ihesu shewde the more great virtue of patience / he commanded humylyte / he
accomplissyd obedyence / he performed charity / And in sign of thise iiij
virtues / the iiij corners of the cross ben a^urned with precious gemmys / and
stones / And In the most apara^te place is charity / And on the right side is
obedyence / And on ye lift side is patience / And bynethe is humylyte the Rote
of all virtues / And all thise things that Ihu^ Christ suffered saint bernard
gadryth to gydre saying / I shall said he as long as I shall live remember the
labors / that he had in prechyng / of the trauaylles that he had in gooyng fro
one place to a another by land / and fro Cite to cite / Of his wakynges in
prayeng / of his te^ptacions in fasting of his wepinges and teres in having
compassion / of the awaytynges on him in spekyng / in assayeng him and temptyng
And at last / of the vylonyes / of the spyttynges of the mocqueryes / of the
obprobryes / And of the naylles / Thirdly his passion was proufytable and
fructuous the which may be proufytable in three manners / That is to wete in
remission of sin / In yeftes of grace / And in demonstracion of glory / And
thies three things ben showed in the title of the cross / The first is Ihesus /
The second nazarenus / And The third rex in deorum / For there shall we all be
kings / of the prouffyt spekyth saint Austyn saying / Our lord Ihesu christ
has put away the sins passed / present and to come / the sins passed in
pardonyng them / the present / in withdrawyng men from them / them to come / in
yeuyng grace to esschewe the sins / yet the same doctor says thus / we
ought to preyse / to thank / to love / and to honor him / For by the death of
our savyour and redemer we ben brought to life / fro corrupcion / to
incorrupcion / from exyle unto our contree / fro weeping to Joy we ben called
again / And how well the manner of our redemption was prouffytable / it appiereth
by v reasons / that is to wete / by cause it was right acceptable tappese god /
right helpyng to save us / right effectuel / to draw to him thumayne lignage /
Right wise to fight against thenemy of humayne lynage / And to reconcyle us to
god / for After this that saint Ancelme says / There is nothing more sharp ne
more strong that a man may suffer by his propre will / without it be of god /
than to suffer death with his own propre will for thonour of god / ne noman may
better give to god to his honor / tha^ give him self to death for him / And
this is that thappostle says ad ephesi^e^ iij / Our lord has gyuem him self
in to oblacion and sacrefice for us in to the odor of sweetness to god the
fader / And how he was sacrefyed / that was in us appeasyng god / Saint Austyn
in the book of the Trynyte says thus / what thing may be more gr^ciously and
playsantly received / than the flesh of our sacrefyse / which was maad the
precious body of our priest / Therefore iiij things ought to be considered in
all sacrefise / First him to whom is offered / that which is offered / him that
offreth And him for whom the offrynge is offered he him self is / the moyen of
both two / that is to say god and man / he was him self that did offer / And
he was him self / that was offered / And the same doctor says yet of this
sacr^fyse / how we be to god reconcyled / Ihu^ Christ is the priest / And the
sacrefyse / he is god and also he is the temple / he is the priest by whom we
be^ reconcyled God to whom we ben reconcyled / And ye temple in whom We be
reco^cyled / The sacrefyse of whom we ben reconcyled / and saint Austyn says /
considering them yt despise this reconciliacion / And set naught thereby / he
says in the person of Ihu^ Christ in repreuyng the^ / when thou were enemy to
my fader I have reconcylyd the / when thou were far / I brought the again /
when thou were taken / I came for to redeem the / when emonge ye montaynes and
the forestes thou were out of the way I sought / the / to the end that of the
vulues ne of the evil bestes thou were not eten ne all to torn^ / I gadred the
/ And bare the in mine arms and delyuerd the to my fader / I labored / I
swette / I put mine head against the thorns / stratched mine hondes unto the
naylles / opened my side to the spear / have shed my blood / And have give
over my soul and life for to Join the to me / And thou have departed thy self
fro me / Secondly Ihesu crist was right couenable and necessary for to save us
and to hele and cure us of our maladye and sickness / for by cause of the time
and of the place / And of the manner of the time as it apperith For Adam was
made and sinned in ye month of march / and on the friday which is the vj day
of the weke / and therefore god in the month of march and on the friday would
suffer death / and at at mydday which is the vj hour / Secondly For the place
of his passion / ye which might be considerid in three manners / for one place /
either it is common or especyal / or singular / The place common where he suffered
/ was the land of promyssyon / The place especyall the mount of caluarye / The
place singular the cross / In the place common the first man was there fourmed
/ that was in a feld about or nygh damas / where it is said in a place
special he was there beryed For right in the place where Ihesu christ suffered
death / it is said that adam was buried / how well that this is not aute^tyque /
For saint Iherome says yt adam was buried in ebron / And also in the book of
Iosue is wreton the xiiij chapitre / In a place singular he was deceived yt is
to wete in ye tree not in this on which Ih^s suffered death / but in an other /
tree Thyrdly he was right couenable by cause of the curyng / the which by
manner was semblable to the preuaricacion / by lyk and contrary / For thus as
says saint Austyn in the book de doctrina cristiana / By a woman he was
deceived And by a woman he was born a man / And the man delyuerd the men / one
mortal / delyuerd the mortal / and the death by his death / And saint ambrose
says / Adam was of therthe a virgin / Ihesu christ was born of the virgin
Adam was made to thymage of god / Ihesus was thymage of god / by a woman folly
was shewde / by a woman wysedom was born / Adam was naked Ihesu christ naked /
The death came by the tree / the life by the cross / Adam in deserte / And Ihesus
in deserte / but by the contrary / For after saint gregorye Adam sinned by
pride / by mobedience and by gloutonye / For he coueyted the hyenes of god /
for the serpent said to them / ye shall be semblable to god / he brake the
commandment of god / and / desired and coueyted the swetenes of the fruit by
gloutonnye / And by cause the manner of the savor ought to be by the contrary
/ therefore this manner was right couenable by the humyliacion / by the
fulfyllyng and affliction / or of the dyuyne volente / And hereof says
thappostle ad philipenses / humiliauit sepisum Thirdely Ihesus was right
proufitably to draw to him thumayn lynage / For one of ye world his frewil
saved myhgt never have drawn mankind to his love And how he draws us to his
love / saint bernard says / Above all thing o good Ihesu give me grace to
love the And by this thing he drew us most to his love / That is the chalys
good lord that thou have dronke^ / which was the work of our redemption This
ch^lys is thy passyo^ which lightly may appropre our lord to the / this is
that draws most playsantly our devotion and Justly reyseth it / and sonnest
streyneth and most vehemently takes our affection / And where thou lamentest
and there as thou despoyllest the of thy rays naturell / there shyneth most
thy pity / there is most clear thy charity / And there habundeth most thy grace
/ and how also we ought to return to the affyaunce of him / saint poul says
ad romanos viij / he spares not his owen sone / but for us all / he delyuerd
him / whereof saint bernard says / who is he that is not rauysshid to hope of
affyau^ce / which takes none head to the disposicion of his body / he / has
his head enclyned to be kyssed / the arms stratched tembrace us / his hondes
perced to give to us / The syd open to love us / The feeet fixed with nails
for to abide with us / And the body stratched all for to give to us / Fourthly
he was right wise and right well aduysed for to fight against thenemy of thumayne
lygnage / Job xxv / His wysedom has smeton the proud man / And after / may ye
not take the fend with an hoke / Jesus Christ has hydd the hoke of his dyuynyte
under the mete of our humanyte / and the fend would take the mete of the flesh
/ and was taken with the hook of the godhede / Of this wise taking says saint
Austyn Our redemptour is comen / and the deceyuer is vaynquysshed / And what
did our redemptour / he leyd out his bayte to our deceyuour and aduersayre /
he has set forth his cross / And within he has set his mete / that is
his blood / For he would shede his blood / not as a dettour And therefore he
departed fro ye dettours And this debt here thappostle calls Cirographe / or
oblygacion / the which Ihesu Christ bare and attouchyd it to the cross / Of
which saint Austyn says / Eve took of the fe^de sin by borowyng by usure /
and wrote an obligacion / she leyde it for pledge / And the usure is augmented
and grew unto all the remenaunt of the lignage / Then took Eve of the fend
sin / wha^ against the commandment she consented to him / She wrote
thobligacion / when she put her hand to the tree against the deffe^ce of god /
She delyuerd pledge / when she made Adam to consent to the sin / And thus
thusure grew / and augmentid unto the remain of all the lignage Against them
that retche nothing of this redempcio^ / Saint bernard says in the person of
Ih^u christ / My people says Ih^u what might I have don for the yt I have not
do^ to the / what cause is there that ye serve sonner the devil our adversary /
than me For he has not created ne has nourisshid you / but this seems a
lytyl thing to them that be full of Ingratitude / I have redeemed you / and not
he / and for what prys / not with gold ne silver / ne of the son / ne of the moon / ne with any of the angellis / but with my propre blood / And after /
Considere if of right for so many benefices ye ought to chese to have my
company / And if ye will all leave me / at lest come with me for to win a
penny a day And by cause they delyuerd Ihesu christ to death / that is to wete
Judas for avarice / the Jews for envy / And pylate for dread / And therefore
it is to see what pain was delyuerd to them of god for this sin / But of the
pain and of the birthe of Judas / thou shall find in the legende of saint
mathye / Of the pain and ruin of the Jews in the legende of saint James the
less / And of the pain of pylate and his birth thou shall find in one
apocryfum where as it is said in this manner / There was a king called tyrus
which knew carnelly a maid called pilam / which was daughter of a myllar
named atus / And of this daughter he engendrid a sone / she took her name / and
the name of her fader which was callid Atus / and composed thus of their names
one name to her sone / and named him pilatus / And when he was three year old
she sent him to the king And the king had a sone of the queen which seemed
to be of the age of pylate / And thise two sons when they were of age of
discrescion / often they fought to gydre and with the slynge they pleyed often /
And the kings sone also which was legytyme / was more noble / And in all
feats he knew more / and more was set by by cause of his birthe And pylat^
seeing this / was moeued of envy and wrath / and pryuely slew his brother /
the which thing the king herd say / and was much angry / And demanded of
his counseyll what he might do and make of this trespaas and homycyde / The
which all with one voys / said that he was worthy to suffer death / And the
king would not double the pain and pugnycion / but by cause he ought to the
romans yerly a trybute / he sent him in hostage to the Romans / as well for
to be quyte of the death of his sone / and that he should not be constrained to
put him to death / as well as for to be quyte of the trybute that he ought to
Rome /

In this time was at Rome one of the sons of the king of france / which
also was sent for trewage / And when pylate saw him / he anon accompanied
with him / And saw that he was preysed to fore him for the wit and for the
manners that were in him / pylate slew him also /

And when the Romans demanded what should be done in this matere / They answered
that he which had slain his brother And estraunglyd him that was in hostage /
if he mygt live should be yet much prouffytable to the common well / And should
daunte the necks of the^ that were cruel and wood / And then said the
Romans / that sith he was worthy to dye / he should be sent in to an isle of
the sea named ponthus / to them that will suffer no Judge over them / to the end
that his wyckednes may overcome and Judge them / or else that he suffer of hem
like as he has deseruyd /

Then was pylate sent to this cruelle people and wild / which tofore had
slain their Judge / And it was told to him to what people he was sent / And that
he should considere how his life was hongyng / And in great Ieopardye / he went
consyderyng his life / and thought to keep it / did so much what by menaces
and promesses of torment as by yeftes / that he subdued them all and put them
in subjection / And by cause he had victory of this cruel pep^e he was named
of this isle of pontos / pounce pilate / And when herod herd his Inyquytees
and his frauds / he had great Joy thereof / And by cause he was wicked him
self / he woe ld have wicked with him / And sent for him by messagers and by
promise of yeftes yt he came to him / And gaf him the power upon the Royame of
Iudee and Iherusalem / and when he had assembled and gadred to gydre much
money / he went to rome with out knowing of herod / and offered right great
sommes of money to the emperor / for to get to him self / that which herod
so held / And so he gate it / And for this cause herod and pilate were
enemies unto the time of the passion of Ihesu christ whom pilate sent to herod
/ Another cause of enemyte is assigned in scolastica historia / There was one
that said him self to be god / and had deceived many of galylee / and brought
the people in to garizain / where he had said / that he would goo up to heaven /
And pilate came upon them / And when he has knowleche of the deed / he slew
him and all his people by cause he doubted that he would have deceived them of
Iudee / And therefore were they enemies to gydre / For herod reigned in galylee
/ And when pilate had delyuerd Ihesu Christ to the Jews for to be crucyfyed /
he doubted the emperor / that he should be reproved of that which he had Iuged
an Innocent / And sent a friend of his for texcuse him / and in this while
Tyberius the emperor fyl in to a grievous maladye / And it was told to him that
there was one in Iherusalem that cured al manner maladyes / And he knew not
that pilate and the Jews had slain him / he said to volusien which was
secret with him / Goo in to the parties over see / And say to pylate that he
send to me the leche or maistre in medecyne / for to hele me of my maladye /
And when he was come to pylate / And had said his message / pylate was much
abashed / and demanded xiiij days of dylacion / with in which time volusien
fond an old woman named veronica / which had be famylyer and devout with
Ihesu Christ he demanded of her / where he might find him that he sought / She
then escryed and said Alas lord god / my lord / my god was he / that ye axe
fore / whom pylate dampened to death / and whom the Jews delyuerd to pylate for
envy / and commanded that he should be crucyfyed / Then he complained him
soroufully / and said I am sorry by cause he may not acco^plyssh that / which
my lord the emperor has charged me / To who^ veronyce said my lord and my
maistre when he went prechyng / I absente me often from him I did do paynte
his image / For to have always with me his presence / by cause that the figure
of his image should give me sum solace / And thus as I bare a lynnen
keuerchief in my bosom our lord met me / and demanded whyther I went /
and when I had told him whyther I went and the cause / he demanded my
keuerchief / And anon he enprynted his face and fygured it therein / And if thy
lord had beholden the figure of Ihesu Christ devoutly / he should be anon
guarisshed and heled / And volusien axid is there nether gold ne silver that
this figure may be bought with / She answered nay / but stroonge of courage /
devout / and of great affeccion / I shall goo with the / and shall bear it to
the emperor for to see it / and after I shall return hither again / Then went
volusien with veronike to Rome / and said to the emperor / Ihesus of nazareth
whom thou have long desired / Pylate and the Jews by envy and with wrong
have put to death / and have hanged him on the cross / and a matrone a wydowe
is come with me / which brings thymage of Ihesu / the which if thou with
good heart and devoutly wylt behold and have therein contemplacion / thou shall
anon be hole / And when the emperor had herd this / he did anon make ready the
way With clothes of sylke / and made thymage of Ih^u to be brought to fore him
/ And anon as he had seen it and worshipped it / he was all guarisshed and
hoole / Then he comau^ded that pylate should be taken and brought to Rome /
And when the emperor herd that pylate was come to Rome / he was much wroth and
enflammed against him And bad that he should be brought to fore him / Pylate ware
always the garment of our lord which was without seem / where with he was clad
wha^ he came to fore the emperor / And as soon as the emperor saw him / all his
wrath was goon ^ and the ire out of his heart / he could not say an evil word
to him and in his absence he was sore cruel toward him / and in his presence
he was always sweet and debonair to him / and gaf him license and departed / And
/ anon as he was departed / he was as angry and as sore moeued as he was to
fore / and more by cause he had not showed to him his fureur / Then he made
him to be called again / and swear he should be ded / And anon as he saw him
his cruelte was all goo^ / whereof was great meruaylle / now was there one by
thynspyracion of god or at the persuasion of some christian man / caused
the emperor to despoylle him of that cote / and anon as he had put it of / The
emperor had in his heart as great ire and fureur as he had to fore / whereof
the emperor meruaylled of this cote / And it was told to him that it was the
cote of Ih^u Then the emperor made pylate to be set in prison / till he had
counseylled what he should do with him / And sentence was given that he should
dye a vylayns death / And when pylate herd the sentence / he took a knyf and
slew him self / And when the emperor herd how he was deed / he said certainly
he is deed of a right vylaynous death and fowl / For his own propre hand has
not spared him / Then his body was taken and bounden to a mylle stone and was
cast in the river of tyber for to be sonken in to the bottom^ / And the ill
spyrytes in thayer began to move great te^pestes and merueyllous wawes in the
water and horrible thondre and lyghtnyng / whereof the people was sore aferd and
in great doubt / And therefore the Romans drew out the body / and in derysion
sent it to vyane / and cast it in to the river named Rosne / viane is as
much to say as hell which is said Iehenna For then it was acursid place
and so there is his body in the place of malediction / And the evil spyrites ben
as well there as in other places / And made such tempests as they did before /
in so much yt they of that place might not suffer it / And therefore they took
the vessel / wherein the body was and sent it for to berye it in the terroir of
the cite of losane / The which also were tempested / as the other / And it was
taken thens and thrown in to a deep pytte all enuyronned with montaynes / In
which place / after the relacion of sum / ben seen illusions / and
machynacions of fendes ben seen grow and boylle / And hither to is thistorye
called ypocryfu^ read / They that have read this let them say and believe as
it shall plese them / Nevertheless in scolastica hystoria / is read that pylate
was accused before the emperor Tyberius / by cause he did put to death by
vyolence the^ that were Innocent by his might And that maulgre the Jews he
set images of paynems in the temple / And that the money put in corbanam he
took and did with all his prouffyt and was preuyd in his vysage that he made
in his hows / alleyes and conduytes for water to run in / And for these
things he was sent to lion in exyle for to deye among the people of whom he
was born / And this may be well supposed that this Istorye be true / For to
fore was the edicte given that he should be put in exyle to lions / And that he
was exyled er volusien returned to the emperor / But when the emperor herd how he
made our lord Ihesu to deye / he made him fro his exyle to come to Rome /
Eusebe and Bid in their chronicles say not that he was enprysoned and put in
exyle / But by cause that he fill in many myseryes / by despayr he slew him
self with his own hand /

Thus ends the Passion
Here begins the (...)
HEre to fore we have made mention of deuyacion of thumayne lygnage which
dureth fro Septuagesme unto Ester / here after we shall make mention of the time
of reconsiliacion / which dureth fro Ester unto the vtas of whitsontyde / like
as holy church has ordained /

THe Resurrection of our lord Ihesu christ was the third day after his death /
And of this blessed resurrectcon / seven things ben to be consyderid / First
of the time that he was in the sepulcre / that be three days and three nyghtes
he was in the sepulcre / And the third day he aroos Secondly wherefore he aroos
not anon when he was deed / but abode unto the third day / Thirdely / how he
aroos / Fourthly / wherefore his resurrection tarried not until the general
resurrection / Fyftly wherefore he aroos / Sixthly how oftymes he appyered in his
resurrection / And the seventh / how the holy faders which were enclosed in a
party of hell / he delyuerd / and what he did etc^ / As to the first point /
it ought to be known that Ih^us was in the sepulcre iij days and iij nyghtes
/ But after saint austyn the first day is taken by synodoche / that is that the
last part of the day is taken The second day is taken all hool / the third is
taken after the first part of the day / thus there be^ iij days / and every day
has his night going before / and after bid the order of ye days was changed
and ye course ordained / for before / ye days went before / and the nyghtes
followed / after the time of the passyo^ / that order was changed / for the
nyghtes goo^ before and this is by mystery / For man first ouerthrewe in the
day / and fill in to the night of sin / And by the passion and resurrection
of Ih^u christ he ca^ again fro the night of sin unto ye day of grace As
touching the second co^sideracion / it ought to be known / yt it is according
to reason that ano^ after his death he ouht not to arise / but ought to abide
unto ye third day / and that for.v^ reasons / the first for the signyfycacion /
to that / that the light of his death should cure our double death / and
therefore.j. day hool and ij nyghtes he lay in ye sepulcre / that by the day we
understand the light of his death / and by the ij nyghtes our double death / and
this reason assigns the gloss upon saint luc luce vicesimo / upon this text /
Oportebat xpristum pati etcetera /

The second for certain probacion / For right so as in the mouth of tweyne or
of three is the wytnes establysshyd / right so in three days is proved all deed
and fayt veritable / And to the end to preue that his death was veritable he would
lie therein three days / The third / for to show his puissaunce / For if he
had arysen anon / it should seem that he had not such might / for to give his
life as he had to reyse him / And this reason touches thappostle ad Corintheos
xv^ Therefore is there first made mencio^ of his death / like as his death was
verily showed / so his very resurrection is showed and declared / Fourthly for
to figure the restauracion / And this reason assigns Petrus rauenensis / Jesus
christ would be three days in his sepulcre / in figure in benefete doing / that
is to wete to restore them that been fall / to repair them that been in therthe
/ And to redeem them that were in hell / The fyfthe for the representyng of
treble estate of ryghtful men / And this reason assigns saint gregorye upon
ezechiel saying / The sixth day of the weke Ihesus suffered death / The saturday
he lay in the sepulcre / The sunday he aroos / The present life is yet to us
the sixth day For in anguisshes and sorrows we ben tormented / The saturday
also is that we rest us in our sepulcre / For after the death we shall find the
rest for our soul / The sunday is the eight day / that day we shall be free of
the death and of all sorrow in body and in soul in glory / Then the sixth
day is to us sorrow / the seventh rest / and the eyghte glory / As to the
third co^sideracio^ how he aroos it appiereth verily that he aroos myghtyly /
For by his propre might he aroos Iohannis nono / Potestatem habeo etc^ / I have
said I have power to deliver my soul / and I have power to resume it again /
that is to say / to deye when I will / ^ And to rise again when I will /
Secondly he aroos Ioyously / For he took away all myserye all infirmyte and
all seruitud / whereof he says in the goospell of Ioh^n / Iohannis xxvj he said
when I shall arise again I shall auaunce me and goo to fore you in to galylee /
where ye shall see me free and delyuerd / Galylee is as much to say as
transmygracion / that is to say deyyng / Ihesu christ then when he aroos
went to for us / For he went fro myserye to glory / and fro corrupcion to
incorrupcion / whereof saint lion the pope says / After the passion of Ihesu
Christ the bonds of death broken / he was transported from Infirmyte to virtue /
fro mortalite to perpetuite / and fro vylonnye to glory / ^ Thirdly he roos
prouffytably / for he carried with him his proye whereof says Ieremye the iiij
chapter / Ascendit leo de cubili etc^ / The lion is resen out of his bed /
Ihesus ascended on hye upon the cross / And the robbour of the people enhaunsed
him self Ihesu Christ robbed hell wherein was thumayne lygnage / As he had said
/ Cum exaltatus fuero etc^ / When I shall ascend on hye I shall draw to me
all mine / of whom hell has holden and kept the souls / which were
enclosed in derknes and the bodies in sepulture / Fourthly he aroos
merueylously / For he aroos without openyng of the sepulcre which abode fast
closed / For like as he issued out of his moders belly / And to his disciples
the doors closed and shytte so he issued out of his sepulcre / whereof is red in
scolastica historia / of a monk of saint laurence without the walls / in the
year of thyncarnacion of our lord M.jCxj / which meruaylled of a gyrdle / with
which he was gyrt / that with out undoing or openyng / it was cast to for him
/ whereof when he saw it he m erueylled / and he herd a voys in thayer saying /
Thus may Ihesu christ issue out of his sepulcre / and the sepulcre all cloos
Fyftly he aroos trewly / For he aroos in his propre body / And by six manners
he showed that he was verily risen First by the Angele which lied not /
Secondly by many and oftymes appyeryng / Thirdly by etyng openly / and by no
art fantastyke / Fourthly by palpacio^ of his very body / Fyftly by oste^cion
of his wou^des / by which he shewde that it was the propre body / in which he
had verily suffered death /

Syxthly by his presence in coming in to the hows the gates shytte / when he
ent^ed sodanly / and Invisibly / by which he shewde that his body was
gloryfyed / Seventhly he aroos Inmortally / For he shall never after deye /
Ioh^is vj / xpu^s resurgens etc^ / And saint denis in an epistle that he made
to demophilum says that Ihu^ christ after his assenco^n said to an holy man
named Carpo / I am all ready yet to suffer for to save man / by which it seems
that if it were need that yet he were ready to suffer death as it is contained in
the same epistle / This holy man Carpo told to saint denis / that a paynem
perverted a Christian man and brought him out of the faith / And this Carpo took
such anger therefore in his heart / that he was seek / and this Carpo was of so
great holiness that as often as he song mass / an heavenly vision appeared to him
/ But when he should pray for the conversion of them both daily he prayed god /
that both tweyn might be brent in a fire / And on a time abought mydnyght he
made this prayer unto god / And sodanly the house in which he was in / was
divided in two parties / And a right great fornaysse appiered there / And he
looked up and beheld the heaven and saw it open and Ihu^ Christ which was
enuyronned with a great multitude of angellis / and beside the fournays thise
two men were tremblyng for great dread that they had / the which men were
byten of serpents that issued out of the fournays / which drew them by force
in to the fournays / and also of other men they were repreued and vylonnyed /
And this holy man Carpo in beholding them had great delight and took pleysaunce
in their pugnycion in such wise / that he left the vision of heaven and set
not there by / but was angry that they fill not suddenly in to thefournays / and
then as he looked up in to heaven / he saw the vision that he had to fore seen
/ And Ihu^s Christ which had pity of thise two men / a roos up out of his trone
/ and came unto them with a great multitude of angellis / And put forth his hond
and delyuerd them / And Ih^s said to Carpo / smite me from hens forth I am ready
to suffer for to save man / This ensample recyteth saint denis / As to the
fourth article / wherefore he abode not until the general resurrection / Three
reasons ben assygned / The first for the dignyte of his body / For he was
deyfyed and came fro the deyte / And therefore it was no reason that his body
should so long lie in therthe / whereof david says / Non dabis sanctum tuum
videre corruptionem / Thou shall not suffer thyn holy body see corruption / The
second reason is for the stedfastnes of the faith / For if he had not then
arysen / the faith had perisshyd / men would not have byleued that he had be
very god And that appiereth well For in his passion sauf our lady / all lost
faith / But when they had knowleche of his resurrection / they recouerd it
again as says saint poul Si xpristus non surrexerit / vana est fides nostra /
if Ihesu Christ had not risen / our faith had be vayn or none / The third cause
/ For thexemplar of our resurrection / There should be but few / that should
believe the resurrection to come / if Ihesus Christ had not risen / And this is
our example and our hope / And therefore sayen thappostles / Ihesu Christ is
arysen / And we shall arise / For his resurrection is cause of ours / whereof
says saint gregorye / Our lord by example has showed that he promised in
reward / as that we should know him to have risen / Thus in our self we should
have hope of the reward of his resurrection / And we ought to know that Ihesu
Christ would not prolonge his resurrection / above three days to the end that
desperacio^ should not be in the world As to the fyfthe Article it is wherefore
he aroos / he aroos for four things much proufytable to us / For his
resurrection made the Iustyficacion of our sins / she enseyneth new life of
manners she engendrith the hope of reward / and ordeyneth the resurrection of
all / Of the first says saint poul ad Romanos / Ihesu Christ deyed for our
sins / and aroos for to Iustefye us / Of the sec^nde / like as Ihesu Christ
aroos by the glory of the fader / which is a new glorious life / So ought we
in spyrituell life take new manners / Of the third By his great mercy god has
raised us in hope of life by the resurrection of Ihesu Christ / Of the fourth
it is said to us in scripture / Ihesu Christ aroose fro death / For by man / is
death come to men / And by man / that is Ihesu Christ / the life is come to men /
Thus ben they ye first of deed me^ / Adam of the^ that deyde / and Ih^u christ
of the^ that been a live by his resurrection / And thus it appiereth that Ihesu
christ had iiij propretees in his resurrection / The first is that our
resurrection is differed unto the last resurrection / And Ihesu christ aroos the
third day / As says the gloss upon this psalm Ad vesperum demorabitur fletus
etc^ At euensongetyme shall be weeping / And on the morn gladness and Joy / The
gloss says that the resurrection of Ihesu Christ is cause sufficient of ye
resurrection of sowles in this present time / And of the bodies in time to come
/

The second proprete is that we rise by him / And he aroos by him self /
whereof says saint ambrose / how might he seek help to reyse his body / which
raised other The third proprete is that we become duste or ashes / And his
body might not be turned in to ashes / The iiij proprete is that his
resurrection is cause sacramental of our resurrection / As touching the sixte
article / hou often he appiered the day of his resurrection / he appiered five
times / First to marie Magdalene / marci vltimo / After his resurrection he
appiered first to marie magdalene / which is figure of penitentes And for five
reasons he appiered to her First for she loved him most ardantly / by cause she
loved so much / god foryafe and pardonned her many sins / Secondly for to
show that he deyde for sinners / Mathei ix / Non veni vocare etc^ I came not
for to call rightful men but sinners to penance / Thirdly for to veryfye his
word / Mathei xxi Ame^ dico quia meretrices etc^ / To the ypocrites and
phariseys he said / that common wymen and the publica^ should goo to fore them to
the kingdom of heaven / Fourtly for by cause / that like as a woman was
messager of death / so a woman should he messager of life / after the gloss / ^
Fyftely like as sin habounded / so should grace more habounde like as
thappostle says ad romanos v. The second time he appeared to the three mary's
which returned fro the monument when he said to them auete / god great you /
And then they approached him And held his feet / And that is the figure of
humble prayers / to whom our lord appeared / as well for the reason of the nature
/ as for the reason of thaffectio^ For they held his Feet / which sygnefyeth
thaffection of the heart / Thirdly he appeared to saint pieter / but when ne in
what place / it is not known / but if it were by adventure / when he returned
fro the monument with saint John^ / For it might well be / that saint peter in
sum place turned fro saint John^ / where god appiered to him / or by adventure
when he was allone in the monument like as it is said in scolastica historia or
parauenture in a Cave or a fosse / For it is read in thistoryes / when he
renyed and forsook our lord / that he fled in to a Cave / where as the
montayn is / which is called the montayne of the cocque / or ellis after that
it is said that he wept three days contynuelly after that he had renyed god /
And there Ihesus appeared to him / and comforted him saying / ^ Peter bear the
virtue of obedyence / to whom our lord shows him / Fourtly he appiered to his
disciples / which went to Emaus wiche is as much to say / as desire of
counsel / and signefyeth / to vysyte the pour members of Ihesu christ and to
help them as it is said in the gospel / Goo and selle all that thou have /
And give it to pour people / Fyftly he appiered to his disciples / which were
to gydre in a place closed / and this signefieth relygyous men that been in the
world / with the yates of their v wits closed / Thyes five apparicions weren
the day of his resurrection / And thyes five represents the priest in his
mass when he tourneth him five times to the people / but the third tornyng is
in silence / which signifies tapparicion made to saint peter which is not
known when it was made ne in what place / Sixthly he appyered the eight day to
his disciples / when saint thomas was there / which had said / that he would
not believe it / til that he had seen the wounds / the naylles / and that he
had put his hand in his side / The seventh time he appiered to his disciples
fysshyng / Ioh^is vlti^o / And that signyfieth prechers / which ben fysshers
of men / The viij time he appeared to his disciple in the mount Thabor / Mathei
vltimo / And that signifies them that been contemplatyf / For in the said hylle
was our lord transfygured / The ix time he appeared to xj disciples where they
satte at table / where as he repreued their incredulite and hardness of heart
/ By which we understand the synnars in the xj nombre of transgressyon set
/ whom our lord by his mercy sometime vysiteth / The tenth time he appiered to
to his disciples in the mount of olyuete by which is sygnefyed the^ that been
full of mercy / and that love compassion / to whom our lord appierith / which
is fader of mercy and of pity / fro this place he ascended up in to heaven /
There ben three other manner of apparicio^s of which is made mention / which
were made the day of the resurrection / but they be not had in the text of the
gospel / The first was that he appeared to saint James the less / which is
named James alphei of which thou shall find in his lege^de The second that
he appeared / was to Joseph / as it is red in the gosppell of Nychodeme / For
when the Jews had herd that Joseph had demanded the body of Ihesus of pylate
/ And that he had put it in his monument / They were angry and had indignacion
on him / And took him and put him in a secret place / where diligently they
closed him and kept him / and would have slain him after their sabbat day / And
Ihesus the night of his resurrection entered in to the hows where he was in /
and over lift up the iiij corners of the hows / and wyped and clensid his
visage and kyssed him / And without brekyng of any lock or seall he brought
him in to his house in Arimathye / The third is / after that it is byleued / he
appeared unto his mother marye / the gloryouse virgyne / and how be it / that the
holy euangelystes speak nothing hereof / the church of Rome appproueth it / For
the same day is made stacion at our lady the maiour And if we should not believe
by cause theuua^gelistes make no mencio^ thereof / it should follow that after
his resurrection he appiered not to her / but that ought not to be byleued /
that such a sone should not leave his mother without vysytyng / and do to her so
lytyl honor / And peraue^ture the euangelystes speak no word of her / by
cause it apperteyneth not to them but to set wytnes of the resurrection / And
the virgyne marye ought not to be set in for no wytnes /

For if the words of strange wymen were reputed for lesynges / much more
should the mother be / by cause of the love that she had to him that was her sone
/ And thaugh the evangelists have not wreton it / yet they knew well for
certain / that it is right / that first he should enhaunce and comfort her that
had most pain and sorrow for his death And that witnesses saint ambrose in the
third book of virgynes / Vidit maria etc^ / / Marye saw the resurrection /
and she byleued it parfyghtly / Marye magdalene saw it / and yet she doubted
it / Of the seventh / how Ihesus crist drew the holy fadres out of hell / and
what he made there / The evangelist tells not clerly / Nevertheless saint
Austyn in a sermon / and Nichodemus in his gospel show it somewhat / and saint
Austyn says / Anon as Ihesu Crist had rendered ye spyrite the soul yt was
united to his godhed / was quyk and living in the depnes of hell descended /
And when he was at deppest of the derkenes like as a Robber shynyng and
terrible to the tirantis of hell / They beheld him and began to demand and
inquire / who is he that is so strong / so terryble so clear and so shynyng /
The world which is to us subget / sent to us never such one deed / ne he
sent to us ne / uer such yeftes in to hell / who is he then that is so
constant / that is entered in to the ferthest end of our parties and he
doubts not only our torments but yet he has unbound them / of their bonds
/ whom we held and kept / And they that were wont to waylle and weep under
our torments assayllle us now by their health / And now not only they fere us
but now threten and manace us And they said to their prince what prince art
thou / all thy gladness is perisshed / and all thy Joys ben converted in to
wepynges / when thou hengest him in the cross / thou knew not what damage
thou sholdest suffer in hell / After thise cruel words of them of hell /
At commandment of our lord / all the locks / all the bars / and
shyttynges ben broken and to frusshed / And loo the people of saints that come
knelyng to fore him in cryeng with pytous voys saying / Our redemptor thou art
comen for to redeem the world / we have abyden the every day / thou art
descended in to hell for us / And leave us not / but that we be with ye / when
thou shall return to thy brethern / lord sweet god / show that thou have
despoylled hell / And bind the auctour of death with his bonds / render to
the world now gladness / And quench the pains / And for thy pity unbind the
caytyfs fro servitude / whiles thou art here / and assoylle the synnars when
thou desce^dest in to hell them of thy party / this says saint Austyn / And
it is read in the gospel of nychodemus / that Carinus and lencius sons of
old symeon aroos with Ihesu Crist / And they were adjured and sworn of anne /
of Cayphas / of Nichodeus of Joseph and of gamaliel that they should tell and
say what Ihesus did in hell And they rehearsed and said / when we were with
our faders in the place of obscurte and derknes / suddenly it was also light and
clear as the color of the son like purple gold and light ryall which
enlumined all thabitacion upon us / And anon Adam the fader of thumayne
lygnage began to enjoy Saying This light is the light of the creator of the
light sempyternel / which promysid to send to us his light perpetuell / And
ysaye cried / This is the light of god the fader / like as I seide living in
therthe / the people that were in derknes saw a great light / Then came our
fader Symeon / And in Ioyeng said / gloryfye ye our lord / For I received
Christ a child born in the world in to mine hondes in the temple / And I was
constrained by the holy ghost to say / Nunc viderunt oculi mei saluta / re
tuu^ / I have now seen with mine eyes thyn health which brings and has made
it ready to fore the face of all thy people After come one which seemed to be an
heremyte / And when we demanded him what he was / he answered that he was Ioh^n
that baptized Christ / and he that am goon to fore him / for to ma^^ ready his
way / And shewde him with my fyngre / when I said / Ecce agnus dei / and am
descended for to show to you that he comes sone to visyte you / Then said
seth / when I came to the gate of paradis for to pray our lord to send me his
angelle / And that he would give to me of the oylle of mercy for tenoynte ye
body of adam my fader which was seek / The angel mychel appeared to me and said
/ labor not in prayeng by weeping for the oylle of the tree of mercy / For by
no way thou may get it / till that v thousand and v.C. years ben
accomplisshed / And when the patriarchs and the prophets herd this they
enjoyed and demened great feste / Then Satan prince and demener of death said
to hell / make you ready to receive Ihesu which gloryfyeth him self to say /
I am the sone of god / and he is man that dred the death for he said my soul is
sorouful unto the death / And many that I have made lame and crooked he thath
heled / and made them goo right / Then answered hell and said / if thou art
mighty and so great as thou say / who is this man Ihesus that thou dredest
not / and is aduersarye to thy puissaunce / if he says that he dredde the death
/ he will take the / And woo shall be to the / perpetuelly as long as ye world
shall dure / and Satan answered I have tempted and have moeued the people against
him / I have made ready the spear / I have meddled the vynaygre and the galle to
gydre / and have made ready the tree of the cross / and anon he shall dye / to
the end that I may bring him hither / Then hell answered / is not this he
that raised lazare / whom I retained / And Satan said / that same is he trewly
/ And hell said to Satan / I conjure the by my virtue and by thine / that
thou bring him not hither when I herd the might of his word and his
commandment I trembled for fere / I might not keep lazare / but he escaped fro
me / And like an angele he sprange on hye and departed fro us / And thus as
they spaken / there came a voys like a thondre / which said / Attollite etc^
Take away your gates ye princes And lift ye up the yates perdurable / and the
king of glory shall enter in At this voys the deuyllis ran thither and shytte
fast the gates with bars of iron / And then said david have not I prophesied
this that I see / when I said / Confiteantur domino quia contriuit portas ereas
etc^ / is not this he that has broken the yates of hell of strong matter / and
has broken the bars / and then after came a great voys which said again
Attollite etc^ / And when hell saw that he had cried twyes thus / and knew
him not / then he said / who is this king of glory / to whom david answered
/ this is our lord strong and mighty in bataylle / which is king of glory /
Then came in the king of glory / And enlumyned the derknes and put forth his
right hand and took the right hand of Adam and said / peace to the / And to all
thy sons that been Just / and then our lord departed fro hell / and all
the saints follows him / And our lord holdyng the ho^de of Adam delyuerd him
to Mychel tharchangele / and he brought them in to paradis Then came two
honorable men and ancient and they demanded them and said / who be ye that
with us have not be yet deed / and in body and in soul ye be set in paradys
/ One of them spack and answered I am Enoch which am hither translated / And
this is helye which by the will of god is comen hither in a chariot enflamed
of fire / yet have we not tasted the death / But we be kept unto the coming of
Antecryst for to fight with him / and of him we shall be slain / And after three
days and an half we shall be received in the clouds in thayer / And thus as
they spak / there was another yt bare upon his sholdres the tree of the cross /
the which when he was demanded what he was he said / I am a thief and was
crucyfied with Ihesu and I believed on him that he was ye creator of the world
/ And I prayed him saying / lord have mind on me / when thou shall come in to
thy Royame And he said to me / this day thou shall be with me in paradys / and
gaf to me this sign of the cross / and said to me bear this / and goo forth
to paradys / And if the angele that is kepar of paradys / will not suffer the
to enter / show to him this sign of the cross / and say / that Ihesu christ
which is crucyfyed sent the thither / And anon as I had said yt he bad me say
/ The angele opened the gate to me / and set me in the right sid of paradys /
And when Carinus and lencius had recounted thies things here Anon they were
transfygured / and were no more seen / And heerof speaks gregory Niceus And
saint Austyn / like as is founden in sum books / Anon as Ihesu christ
descended in to hell / ye night began to wexe clear / And anon the por / ter
black and horrible / among them in silence began to murmr saying / who is he
/ that is so terrible / and of clerenes so shynyng / Our maistre received never
none such in to hell / ne ye world cast never none such in to our cauerne /
This is an assayller / and not dettour / a brekar and destroyer / And no sinner
but a despoyller / we se him a Judge / but no bysecher / he come for to fight /
and not to be ouercomen / A caster out and not here dwellar / /

Thus ends the Resurrection
Here begin the letanyes the more and the less /
THe letanyes ben don twyes in the year / The first be don on saint marks day
and that is called the more letanye / And the second be don on the three days
before thascencion day / and is called the less letanye / and letanye is as
much to say as supplicacio^ or prayer / The first letanye is named in three
manners / First it is called the more letanye / Secondly the procession of vij
ordres / Thirdly the black cross / Then this letanye is said the more / for
three reasons / The first reason is for him that Institued it / that was saint
gregorye the pope / and that was at Rome / which is lady and heed of the world
/ by cause that the body of the prince of thappostles is there and the holy see
/ And also for the reason of the cause where fore it was Institued / and that was
for a right great and grievous maladye For as the Romans had in the lenton
lived sobrely and in contynence / and after at ester had received their savior
/ After they disordred them in etyng in drynkyng / in plays and in lecherye A
nd therefore our lord was meuyd against them / and sent to them a great
pestelence / which was called the botche of impedymye / and that was cruel
and sudden / and caused people to dye in going by the way / in playeng / in
being at table / and in spekyng one with another suddenly they deyed / In
this manner sometime fnesyng they deyed / so that wha^ any person was herd
fnesyng anon they that were by said to him / god help you / Or Christ help /
and yet endures the custo^me And also when he fneseth or gapeth he makes to
fore his face the sign of the cross and blessith him / And yet endures this
custom / And how that pestelence began it is found in the life of saint
gregorye / Secondly this letanye is said procession of seven ordres / by cause
that when they were made / saint gregorye ordained them by vij ordynances / For
in the first order was all the clergy / in the second were the monks and
relygyous men / In the third were all the nonnes / In the fourth all the
children / In the fyfthe all the lay people / In the sixthe all the wydowes
And in the vij all they yt were married / But by cause that now we may not
fulfylle in nombre of persons / we ought to fulfylle it in no^bre of letanyes
For it ought to be said vij times / or the procession be left / Thirdly this
letanye is said the black cross / For then in sign of pestylence / of
weeping and of penance / they cladde them with black clothes / And parauenture
for that same cause / they couerd the cross and the aulters with blessed
hayres / And thus we should take on us clothyng of penance There is an other
letanye / which is called the less letanye / the which is made the three
days tofore thasce^cion / And this Instituted saint Mamertyn bishop of vyane
/ in the time of the emperor lion which reigned the year of our lord iijClviij /
to fore the Institucion of the first / And is said the letanye the less / the
rogacions and processions / For it is The less letanye to the difference of
the first / by cause that this less letanye was Institued of a less which
was a simple bishop / in a less place / and for less maladye / And the cause
of the institucion was this / For then at vyane were great earth quaues / of
which fyl down many chirches and many houses / and there was herd great sownes
and great clamours by night / And then happed a terrible thing on ester day /
For fire descended fro heaven that burnt the kings palace / yet happed more
merueyllous thing / For like as the fendes had entered in to the hogs / right
so by the suffraunce of god for the sins of the people / the fendes entered in
to wulues and other wild bestes / which euerych doubted / and they went not
only by the ways ne by the feldes / but also by the cytees ronnen openly / And
devour den the children and old men and wymen And when the bishop saw that
every day happed such sorouful adventures / he commanded and ordained / that
the people should fast three days / And he instituted the letanyes / and then
the tribulacio^ ceased / And fro than forth on the church has ordained and
confermed that this letanye should be kept and observed over all / It is said
also Rogacions / For then we pray and demand the suffrages of all the
saints / and we thus have good cause for to keep this ordenau^ce / and fast
in thise days / And for many reasons it is institued / First by cause it
appeaseth the bataylles / that comynly begin in prymtemps / Secondly by cause
that the fruytes which be then tender / that god will multeplye / Thirdly by
cause that every man should mortefye in him self the moeuynges of his flessh /
which in that time boylle / Fourtly by cause yt euerich dispose him self to
receive the holy ghost / For by fastings / by orysons / and by devotion / is
one more able and more worthy / But two other reasons assigns maistre will^m
dancerre / by cause than when Ih^u christ would ascend unto heaven / he said /
Ask ye duly and ye shall have / And we may the more faithfully demand / when
we have the promise of god / Secondly by cause ye holy church fasteth and
prays / that she have but lytil flessh / that is to make the body lene by
abstynence / and to get wings by prayer / For prayer is the wynge of the
soul / by which she flees to heaven / to the end that she may follow Ih^u
christ asce^dyng up to fore us to show us the way / And know ye that the
foul that haboundeth in plente of flessh / and has but few pens or feathers
/ he may not well flee / Thus this letanye is called procession / For then the
church makes general procession / And in this procession the cross is born
/ the clockes and belles ben sowned and rongen / the ba / ners ben born / And
in sum church a dragon with a great taylle is born / And aid and help is
demanded of all seyntes / And the cause why the cross is born and the belles
rongen / is for to make the fe^des and evil spyrites aferd and to flee / For
like as the kings have in bataylles tokenes and signs royal / as her trompes
and baners right so the king of heaven perdurable has his signs mylytaunt in
the church he has belles for busynes and for tro^pes he has the cross for
baners / And like as a tyrant and a malefactor should much doubt / when he
shall here the busynes and trompes of a mighty king in his land and shall see
his baners / In like wise the enemies the evil spyrites that been in the regio^
of thayer / doubt much when they here the trompes of god which ben the
belles rongen / And when they see the baners born on hye / And this is the
cause why the belles be ronge^ when it thondreth / and when great tempests and
oultrages of wether happen / to the end that the fendes and wicked spyrites
should be abashed and flee / and cease of the moeuyng of tempest / how be it
also / that there is another cause there with / that is for to warn the christian
people / that they put them in devotion and in prayer for to pray god that the
tempest may cease / There is also the baner of the king / that is the cross /
which the enemies dred much and doubt / For they dread the staf / with
which they have been hurt / And this is the reason wherefore in sum church /
in the time of tempest and of thondre / they set out the cross against the
tempest / to the end that the wicked spyrites see the baner of the souerayn
king / and for dread thereof that they flee / And therefore in procession the
cross is born / And the belles ronge^ for to chase and hunde away the fendes
being in thayer / and to the end that they leave to tempest us / The cross is
born for to represente the victory of the resurrection and of thascencion of
ihesu christ / For he ascended in to heaven with all a great pray And thus this
baner that flees in the air signefyeth Ihesu christ assendyng unto heuene /
And as the people follow the cross / the baners and the procession Right so
when Ihesu Christ styed up in to heaven / a great multitude of seyntis followed
him / And the song that is songen in the procession / signefyeth the song of
angellis and the preysynges / that came against Ihesu christ / and conduyted and
conveyed him to heuene where is great Joy and melodye In some chirches and in
especial in them of france is accustomed to bear a dragon with a long taylle
filled full of chaff or other thing The two first days it is born to fore the
cross / And on the third day / they bear it after the cross with the taylle
all void / by which is vnderstonden / that the first day to fore the law /
or the second under the law / the devil reigned in the world / And on the
third day of grace by the passion of Ihesu christ he was put out of his Royame
/ After in this procession singulerly we call the suffrages of all the
saints / And why we call to ye saints / diverse reasons ben assigned here to
fore / But yet there be of the general wherefore we pray the saints / First
for our pouerte / and for the glory of saints / and for the reverence of god
/ For the saints may well know the vows and the prayers of the supplyauntes
/ For in the myrrour perpetuel that is Ihesu christ / they understand how
much it apperteyneth to their Joy and to our prouffyt / Then the first
reason is for our pouerte / and for our myserye / or for our defaute / we have
sum merit to the end that where our merits be not suffycient / the suffrages
of saints may auaylle us / or for deffaute that we have in contemplacion of
god / And that we may see parfyghtly the light souerayn that we see and behold
in his saints / or for the deffaulte that we have in loving god / For we see
that some show more gretter affection to a saint / than they do to god / And
such people be in perfyght / The second reason is for the glory of saints /
For god will that we call ye saints / by cause that by their suffrages that we
require / we gloryfye them / and the more greatly we preyse them The third
reason is for the reverence of god / to the end that the sinners that have
offended god / the which dar not approach to god in their persons / they
approach him by the friends of god in demandyng their suffrages / And in thyes
letanyes / we ought to repete this song of angellis / Sce^ deus / Sce^ fortis
/ Sce^ et inmortalis miserere nobis / Item Ioh^n damascene records in his
fourth book / that in Constantynoble for a trybylacion that happed there /
there were letanyes made / it happed that a child amydde the people was
rauysshed to heaven and this cantycle he learned there / And after then he
returned to the people / And in the mydde of the people he song it / And anon
that tribulacion ceased / and after at the Ceene of Calcidone / this cantycle
was approuued / and the cause concluded / we know that it is so that the
fendes ben put out by this cantycle / Sancte deus / Of this cantycle and
praysyng the auctorite is approved by iiij reasons / First by cause that an
angele taught it first / Secondly by cause at the prolacion and repeticion of
this cantycle / that tribulacion ceased / Thyrdly by cause that the seen of
Calcydone approuued it / And fourtly by cause that the fendes and enemies so
much dread and doubt it /

Thus enden the Letanyes the more and the less
Here begins next the Asce^cion of our lord
THascencion of our lord Ihesu christ was the forty day after his resurrection
/ for which to declare / vij things ben to be considered First then he
ascended / Secondly / why he ascended anon after his resurrection / Thyrdly how
he ascended / Fourthly what company ascended with him / Fyftly by what merit
he ascended / Syxtly where he ascended / and seue^thly werfore he ascended As
to the first / he ascended fro the mount of olyuete by bethanye / the which
mo^tayne / after another relaco^n / is said the mo^tayne of three lyghtes / For
by night on the side of the west it is lyghted of the fire that bre^neth in the
temple / which never is put out ne quenchyd / On the morning it is light of
thoryent / for she has first the rays of the son / before it shyneth in the
cite / and also it has great habou^dau^ce of oylle yt nourissheth the light /
and therefore it is said the hylle of iij lyghtes / unto this hylle Ih^u crist
commanded his disciples that they should goo / For on the day of his asce^cion
he appeared ij times / one time / to xj disciples that ete in the hall where
they had souped with him / All the appostles and the disciples / and also the
wyme^ abode in ye party of Ihrl^m / which is said Mellos / in the mo^tayne of
Syon / where david had made his palais / and there was the great hall arrayed
and ordained for to souppe / where as Ih^u crist commanded yt they should make
ready to for ete the paske la^be / and in this place the xj apostles abode / and
the other disciples and the wyme^ abode in diverse mansyons there about and
when they had eten in this halle our lord appiered to them and repreued them of
their Incredulite / And when he had eten with them / and had coma^ded them that
they should goo to the mount of Olyuete / on the side by betanye / he appeared
again to them / and answered to them of the demau^des that they made to him
indiscretly / and with his hands lift he blessed them / and ano^ to fore them
he ascended unto heaven / Of the place of this ascencion says supplicius
bishop of Ih^rm / and it is in the gloss / For there was edyfyed a church in
the place where were made ye signs of his ascencio^ / never sith might be
set there any pame^t / it could not be leyde ne set / but anon it issued
out / And the stones of the marble sprange in to the vysages of them that set
it / And that is a sign that they be stones on which christ passed upon which
lie in the pouldre and duste and abide for a tokene and sign certain / As to
the second point werfor he ascended not anon after his resurrection / but abode
xl days / that was for iij reesons / First for the certificacion of his
resurrection / And more strong it was to prove his resurrection than his
passion / for fro the first day unto the third / the passion might be well
preued / but to preue the very resurrection / it required moo days / and
therefore a gretter time was required between the resurrection and thascencion /
than between the passion and resurrection And hereof says lion the pope in a
sermon of thasce^cion / This day the no^bre of xl days is complete / and
dispensed by right holy ordenaunce / and to the prouffyt of our ensegneme^t and
techyng / to the end that in the space of his presence corporell / the faith of
techyng was necessary / and we ought to give thankynges to the dyuyne
dyspensacion / for the tardyue creau^ce of holy fadres to us necessary / for
they doubted of that / which we doubt not / Secondly he abode for the
co^solacion of thappostles / For the co^solacion dyuyne surmounte the
tribulacions temperall / And the time of the passion was the time of
trybulacyon to thappostles / And therefore there ought to be moo days unto
thascencion / than to the resurrection / Thyrdly for the mysterye of the
comparacion / for to give to understand / that the consolations dyuyne ben
compared to trybulacions as the day unto an hour / and the year unto a day /
And that this be true it appears by the writing / of the prophet ysaye / I
shall preche a year playsaunt to our lord / and a day of vengeance to god / Loo
for one day of trybulacion / he rendrith a year of consolacion / And that is by
comparison as the day to an hour it appiereth by that / that our lord was deed
and lay in the sepulcre xl hours / which was the time of trybulacion / And
by xl days after his resurrection he appiered to his disciples / Which was
the time of consolacion / And this says the gloss / by cause that he was
forty hours deed / After he was xl days living er he ascended in to heaven /
As to the third point / how he ascended it appierith how that he ascends
myghtyly / For by his puyssaunce and virtue says Ysaye / he ascended in to
heaven / Ysaye lxvij / And also Saint Johan says / Noman ascended in to heaven
by his oune puissaunce and might / but the sone of man that is in heuene / And
how be it that he ascended in a cloud / he had no ne ned / but by cause that
he would show that every creature is ready to serve his creator / he ascended
in his propre virtue / and in this is the difference / After that scolastica
historia says / of Ihesu crist / of Enoch and helye / For Enoch was translated
/ helye was born but Ihesu christ by his owen might is ascended in to heaven
after saint gregorye / The first that is to wit Enoch was engendered of a man /
And he was engendryng / The second that is to say Helye was engendered / and
not engendryng The third that is to wit Ihesu Christ he was born / not
engendryd of a man ne engendryng / Secondly he ascended openly / For seeing his
disciples he ascended whereof is said Ioh^is xvj / Vado ad eum qui me misit etc^
/ I goo to my fader / and none of you demands / whyther ghost thou / the
gloss says I goo so openly / that noman demanded of that they saw at eye /
And therefore he would ascend in their presence / by cause they might bear
witness / And that they should enjoy of that they saw nature humayne ascend
to heuene / and that they should desire to follow him / Thyrdly he ascended
Ioyously / For the au^gellis syngyng and enioyeng he ascended in to heuene in
gladness / whereof says saint Austyn / Ascendente xpristo pauet etc^ / Ihesu
christ asce^dyng / the heuene abashed the sterres merueylled / the companyes of
heuene enjoyed / the trompe sowned And all the syeges of the playsaunt place
made melodyes / Fourthly he ascended lightly whereof david says / he styed up
as a gyaunt with a great paas and much hastily and lighly he ascended when he
passed so great a space in a momente / Raby moses which was a great
philosopher reherceth that every cercle or every heaven of each planete has the
thyknes and the way of vC year / that is to say as one may goo in a plain
way in vC year / And that is the distaunce by twene heaven and heaven / and
between cercle and cercle / after / that which is said so great / and as there
be^ seven heeuenes after his saying fro the center of therthe unto the
concauite of the heaven of saturn / which is the vij way of vijM year / And
unto the concauite of the eight heaven vijM and vijC year / that is as much
space as one should goo in plain way in vijM and vijC year / if a man might
live so long / And that every year be of iijClxv days / And the way of every
day be of x^ mile and every mile be of two thousand paas or cubytes / And this
says Raby moses which was a great philosopher / if it be truth or no / god
knows / For he that all has made and created in certain nombre / in certain
poys and weight / and in certain mesure / he knows all Then this leep or
spryngyng was great that Ihesus christ made fro therthe to heuene / Of this leep
and diverse other leepes of Ihesu christ / saint ambrose says Ihesu christ came
in to this world to make a leep / he was with god the fader / he came in to the
virgyne marye / And fro the virgyne marye in to the crybbe or rack / he
descended in to flom Iordane / he ascended upon the cross / he descended in to
his tomb / Fro the tomb he aroos / and after ascended up in to heaven and
sytteth on the right hand of the fader / As to the fourth point / is with whom
he ascended / he ascended with a great pray of men and great multitude of
au^gellis / And that he ascended up with the pray of me^ it appears by this
that david says Ascendisti in altum cepisti captiuitatem etc^ / Lord thou have
ascended on hye / And have taken them that were captives enprisonned / and the
seruytude thou have affranchysed / And also that he ascended with a great
multitude of angellis / it appears by the Interrogacions that thangelis made
of the desputacions to them bynethe / when Ihesu christ ascended in to heaven as
ysaie records ysaie lxiij / Quis est iste qui venit de edom etc^ / Who is he
that come fro edo^ with his clothes dyed where as says the gloss / that sum
of thangellis that knew not plainly the mysterye of thyncarnacion / of his
passion and of his resurrection / that saw our lord ascend with all a great
multide of angellis and of saints by his owen virtue / merueylled and said to
thangellis that accompanied him / who is this that comes fro edom / And yet
they said who is this king of glory etc^ Saint denis in the book of
gerarchye of holy angellis in the vij chapter says Thus seems it that he
said / that three questions were made to thangellis when yt Ihesus ascended /
The first were the first to them self / The second were the pryncipalis to
Ihesu Christ / that ascended / The third were the less to the grettest / Of
which they demanded among them who is this that comes fro Edom / his clothis
dyed of bosra / This word Edom is as much to say as full of blood / and this
word bosra is to say anguisshe and tribulacion / Thus as they would have said /
who is this that comes fro the world full of blood / by the sin of the world
/ and of malice against god / And our lord answered I am he that speaks in
Justice / And saint denis says thus / that he said / I am he that disputes
Justice and rightwisnes of health in the redemption of humayne lignage / he was
Justice in as much as he that was creator brought again his creatures / fro
the strange Jurisdiction / And he was rightwisnes in as much as the enemy
which had assaylled us / he put and cast out of the domynacion that he had in
thumayne lignage / And after this / makes saint denis a question / Sith the
pryncypal angellis ben nyghe to god / and ben without moyen enlu / mined of god
/ wherefore demanded they the one of the other / like as that they would have
learned each of other / but he says that gives this solucion / that in that
they dema^unde each of other / it shows that they desire to know / And in
that first emonge them they had collacion / it shows that they durst not
auaunce them to fore the dyuyne progression / And for this first they ought to
axe echeone other / by cause that paraduenture their interrogacio^ were not
over hasty upon the illuminacio^ that they had received of god without moyen /
The second question is / And that was the first and souerayn aungele saying to
Ihesu Christ / Why is thy clothyng read and thy vestymentis as trodden or fulled
in a press / Our lord has his clothyng and his body read all couerd with
blood by cause that yet when he ascended / he had his woundee in his body /
after this that bid says / he must keep his wounds in his body / for v
reasons / and he said thus Our lord keeps his wounds / And to the day of
Judgment he shall keep them / to the end that it conferme his resurrection / And
for to pray the fader for us / he presents them / to the end that the good
see the great merci / by which he has redeemed them / And that the wicked
people may know / that rightwisly they be dampened / And that eternelly / he
bear with him the signs of his gloriouse victory perpetuell / And to this
question answers our lord / Torcular calcaui etc^ / The press I have turned
and fowled all allone / And of all men there was not one that would help me /
the press is the cross / in the which he was pressid in such wise that the
blood sprange out / Thus Ihesu christ called the enemy the pressour / which
that thus had wrapped thumayne lygnage with cords of sin / and quenchid him
so clean / that he had nothing spirituel / but that it was without expressyd /
And only he showed it in the vyrgyne marye / but our champion fought so strongly
/ And defowled the pressour so foul / that he brake the bounds of sin / And
ascended into heaven / And after this h^ opened the tavern of heaven and poured
out the wine of the holy ghost / The third question / is the which the less
angellis made to the gretter and more in saying / who is this king of glory /
They answered and said / The lord of virtues he is king of glory / And of
this question of thangellis and of thanswere of the other / says saint Austyn
/ All the air is hallowed in the company dyuyne / And all the tourbe of
deuellis fleyng in thayer fled bacward when Ihesu christ ascended / to whom
thaungellis that were in the company of god ran / And demanded / who is this
king of glory / And they answered / this is he that was white and colored as a
rose / the which was seen without color / and without beauty / Seek in the
tree / strong in his despoylle Fowll reputed in his body / well armed in the
battle / styngyng in his death / Fair in his resurrection / white born^ of the
virgyne / Read in the cross / pale in repreuys / / And clear in heuene / As to
the fyfte / it is for what merit he ascended / And we ought to understand
that he ascended in treble merit / whereof says saint Iherome / Ihesu christ
ascended in merit of troth / For that which had be promised by prophets / he
fulfyllyd in merit of humylyte and debonayrte / For like as he was sacrefyed
like a lombe / for the life of the people in merit of Justice / But by Justice /
and not only by puyssaunce / but by Justice and by right thou have delyured man
/ and I have withholden of thy puyssaunce / And thy virtue shall bring the to
heaven / this said god the fader to the sone / As to the sixthe that is whither
he ascended / it ought to be known / that he ascended above all the heuenes /
as thappostle says ad ephesios quarto / He that descended fro heaven that is he
that ascended above all the heuenes / by cause he fufylled all things / he
said above all the h^uenes / by cause there be many heuenes above which he
ascended / There is an heuene materiel / an heuene racionel / an heaven
Intellectuel / and an heuene substa^cyall / There ben many heuenes materyel The
heaven of thayer / which is called aereu^ / one other called ethereu^ / Another
ol^imperiu^ / another igneu^ / another sidereu^ / another crystallinum / and
another empireu^ / The heaven reasonable is the man Just / which is said Just
by cause of the dyuyne habytacion / For like as heuene is the sete of god as
the prophet ysaye says Clu^ uiichi seeds est / our lord says that the heuene
is his sete / reght so is the soul of a rightwis man like as solomon says /
The soul of a rightwis man is the sete of sapye^ce / by reason of the holy
co^uersacion / For the saints by holy co^uersacion and desire dwell in heaven
as says saint poul our co^uersacion is in heaven / by cause of co^tynuell
operacion in virtue / For like as the heuenes move contynuelly without restyng
/ in such manner the seyntes moeue always by good works / The heaven
intellectuell / be^ thau^gellis / and thau^gellis be^ called heaven / by ye
reason of dygnyte and of their understanding / whereof says saint denis in the
book of dyuyne names in the iiij chapitre The dyuyne spirits and the aungelles
be^ above the creatares which be^ and live above all things that live and
understand / and know above all other wits / and reasons / and more than
all other things yt been in being / they desire well and good / of which they
be perticipau^t / that is god Secondly they ben right fair by cause of their
nature / and of their glory / of which beauty says saint denis in the book
tofore alleged / Thangel is the manyfestacion of deeds and will of god by whom
they be showed / and he is the clerenes of derke light / he is a myrour pure and
right clear / without receyunyg of any fylth or spotte in him / if it be
leeffull to say he is the beauty and the comformyte of the bounte of god /
Thirdly they be right strong / by cause of their virtue and might / of which
strenght / says Ioh^n damascene in his second book the viij chapter / where
he says / Fortes sunt et parati etc^ / The angellis of god ben strong and
always ready to fulfill the will of god / And they be found alleway anon where god
will have them / The heaven has iij co^dicions It is right hye / right fair /
and right strong / Of ij the first says salomo^ / ecclesiastici xliij / The
firmam^t is the beauty of the height / and the beauty of heaven is in ye sigght
of glory / The heuene is substa^ciall / that is the qualite of the dyuyne
exellence of Ih^u crist ca^ / and after this he ascended / whereof david says /
A summo celo egressio eius etc^ / Fro the hye and souerayn heaven the sone of
god descended / and ascended again unto the souerayn heyght / the qualite of
the dyuyne excellence / and that he ascended above all ye heuenes materiell /
david said it clearly which said / Eleuata est magnyficencia tua super celos /
lord god thy magnyfice^ce is left up and eleuate above all the heuenes /
materiell / he ascended unto the heaven where god the fader sits / not like
unto helye / which ascends in a chare of fire unto a hye regio^ / Fro whens
he was translated in to paradis terrestre / he went no ferther / but Ih^u
Christ ascended in the highest heaven / that is callid celum empireum / which is
the propre habitacio^ of god of thangellis / and of the saints / And this
habitacion properly apperteyneth to dwellars / for this heuene above all other
heuenes has excellence in dyuinyte / in priorite / in situacion / and
circumference / And thefore it is conuement / of Ihesu Christ / which all the
heuenes of intelligence and rasonable surmounteth in dyuynyte / in eternite /
in situacion / of inmobylyte / and in circu^ference / of puissance / semblably
it is thabitacion of saints / of good congruite / For that heaven is without
difformyte / vnmeuable of parfyght light / and of capacite without mesure / And
ryghtfully it apperteyneth unto angelis and unto saints / which were all one
in operacion / vnmeuable in dilection shynyng in the faith and in knoweleche of
great capacite in receyuyng the holy ghoost / / It appiereth by this scripture
that says in the cantycles / Loo this is he that comyth lepyng in the
montaynes and ouerpassyng the hills / And who that ascended above all the
heuenes of intelligence / that is to say above thangellis appyereth by david
that says he ascended above the cherubyn-whiche is as much to say as the
plenytude of science / and flewe upon the pens of the wyndes / And who
ascended above unto the heaven substancyall / that is to thequalyte of god the
fader / it appiereth by the gospel of mark / Marci vltimo / Dominus qui them
Ihesus xpristus etc^ / Sith that our lord had spoken to his disciples he was
set in heuene on the right side of god / whereof says saint bernard / to my
lord Ihesu christ it is said syngulerly / and given of my lord god the fader /
that he sytte on the right side of his glory / In glory in essence
consubstanciall by generation / semblable of mageste / and nothing unlike and
of eternyte semblable / Now may we say that Ihesus in his ascencion was right
hye of iiij manners of heyght / that is to wit of place / of remuneracion of
reward / of knowleche / and of vertualyte or strength / Of the first says
thappostle ad ephesios / He that descended / hither down / that is he that
ascended above all the heuenes / Of the second ad ephesios secundo He was
made obedient unto the death / Where saint Austyn says / The humylyte of
clerenes is the merit / and the clerenes of mekenes is the mede or reward /
mekenes is the merit of clerenes And clerenes is the reward of mekenes / Of
the third says david / Ascendit super cherubin / he ascended above cherubyn /
that is above the plenytude of science and of knowleche / / Of the fourth it
appiereth / for as it is wreton / he ascended above Seraphin / which is
interpreted the strength of god / And we ought to know / that of his
Ascencion / we have nine fruytes prouffytable / Tle first is thabytacion of the
love of god / whereof is said in the gospel / Iohannis xvj / Nisi enim abiero
etc^ / But if I shall goo / the holy ghoost shall not come to you / where says
saint Austyn / if ye seche me by flesshly love ye may not co^prehende the holy
ghoost which is spyrituelle love / The second is the more gretter knowleche of
god / whereof says saint Ioh^n in the gospel / if ye love me well / ye shall have
great Joy / For I goo to my fader / For he is gretter than I am / where says
saint austyn / I shall withdraw this form of humanyte / in which my fader is
more gretter than I / as to that ye may see god / The third fruit is the
merit of the faith of whom says saint lion the pope in a sermon of
thascencion / Then began the faith more certain tapproche / which techeth us
the sone to be egall to the fader and semblable / and as to the body
substancyall of Ihesu christ / of which he is less than the fader / and whereof
he had no need / And this vigor is of great courage and ferme without doubt
for to believe that / which is not seen at eye / and to affyxe the desires that
may not be beholden / And saint austyn says He ascended as a giant to run in
his way and tarried not / but he ran cryeng by voys / by words / by deeds /
by death / by life / by descendyng / and by ascendyng in cryeng that we should
return to him by good he^te / that we may find him / The fourth is our
surete therefore ascended Ihesu christ in to heaven for to be our advocate to god
the fader And we ought to hold us well assured when we have such advocate to
god the fader / and this witnesses to us saint Ioh^n that says in his canonne
/ we have advocate the fader / Ih^u^ Christ which is mercyful to us for our
sins / and of this surete says saint bernard / O man says he we have a sure
going or a coming to god the fader / where the mother is to fore the sone / to
whom she shows her breast and her pappes / And the sone shows to the fader
his side and his wounds Then we may not be put away / where we have so many
signs of love and of charity / The fyfte is our dygnyte / a great dygnyte have
we gotten / when our nature is lift up unto the right side of the fader /
whereof thangellis of heaven considering that / deffended for to be worshyped of
man / Apocalipsis xix / Saint Johan would have worshippid thangele that spack to
him / and thangele deffended him in saying / Beware the that thou do not so /
For I am thy brother and thy servant / where as the gloss says / that in the
old law / he defended not to be worshipped of man but after thascencion when
he saw man lift up above him / And of this saint lion says in a sermon of
thascencion / This day the nature of our humanyte has be born above the heyght
of all puyssaunces unto where as god the fader sits / as that it should seem
more merueyllous / when it is seen that it is much far fro men / so much
more show they the reverence and thonour that they have /

And hereof the faith mystrust not / ne hope slaketh not ne charity amynysshith
not / The syxthe is the stedfastnes and fermete of our faith / whereof says
saint poul ad hebreos sexto / To Ihesu christ we run for refuge / for to keep
the hope that has be delyuerd to us / as an ancre / which is ferme to the
soul and sure / which ledeth to within heaven / where Ihesu christ before us
entered / And saint lion says thus / the Ascencion of Ihesu christ / is our
mountyng and lyftyng up / And where the Joy of our head is / there abides the
hope of our body / ^ The seventh is the showing of the way of heaven / whereof
says Mychee the prophet he ascended to show us the way / And saint Austyn
says / Thy savior has made the way to the / Arise thou / and goo thither /
For thou have that thou entendeste be not now slothful / The viij is the
openyng of the yate of heaven / for like as adam opened ye yate of hell / in
likewise Ih^u crist opened the yate of heuene as the chirch syngeth Lord god
Ihesu christ / thou art he that have overcome the pry^k of death / that is the
devil / and have opened the royame of heaven to them that believe in the / The
ix is the preparacio^ of the new place / whereof Ihesus says in the gospel of
Ioh^n / I goo for to make ready your place in heuene / And saint Austyn says /
Lord array that thou have made ready / Thou arayest us lord to the / and thou
arayest the to us / when thou make ready the place / to the end / that to the
in us / and in the to us may be the preperacion of the place / and the mansion
of the ever lastyng health /

Amen
Thus ends thystorye of Thascencion
Here begins of the blessed holy feste of pentecost or of the holy ghost
THe holy ghoost / as wytnessheth saint luke in thystorye of thactes of
thappostles / on this day was sent to thappostles in the form and lyknes of
tongues of fire / And of this sendyng and coming / viij things ben to be
considered / First fro who^ he was sent Secondly in hou many manners he was
se^te / Thirdly in what time he was se^te Fourtly how often he was se^te to
thappostlis / Fyftly in what wise he was sent / Syxtly in to who^ he was sent
/ Seuently wherefore he was sent / And eyghtly by whom he was sent / As to the
first / it is to wete / that he was sent fro the fader / and fro the sone he
was sent and he also him self the holy ghost gaf and sent him self / Of the
first says saint Ioh^n Ioh^is xiiij / The holy ghoost which is said paraclitus
/ who^ god the fader shall send in my name / This is he that shall teache us all
/ Of the second says saint Ioh^n / if I goo says Ih^us / I shall send him to
you / Now it is to wit / that the sendyng is compared in three manners to the
sendar / First as he that gives being in his substance / and in this manner
the son gives his rays or bemes / Secondly as in gyuyng virtue or strength
/ and so is the darte given by the virtue and str^engthe of him that casts it
/ Thirdly to him that gives his jurisdiction to another / and thus the
messager is sent from him / of whoo^ he has ye comandem^t / and after these
iij manners the holy ghoost may be said to be sent / For it is said sent of the
fader and of the sone / as having virtue and auctorite in his operacio^ / not
withstondyng him self gives and sends him / The which thing seems to be
verytable after this that the gospel of Ioh^n says / Iohannis decimosexto /
Cum venerit ille spiritus veritatis etc^ / When the spyrite of troth shall come
/ which proceeds fro the fader / he shall bear wytnes of me that he comes fro
me / Now says saint lion in a sermon of the pentecoste / The Incomutable deyte
of the blessed trynyte / is without any chaungyng one in substance / not
dyuyded in operacion all one in will / like / in omnypotencye / egalle in
glory and in his mercy / he has taken to him self the work of our redemption
that the fader be to us mercyful / the sone to us proufytable / and god the
holy ghoost enflawme us / And by cause that the holy ghoost is god / therefore
he gives him self / And that this is true / Saint Ambrose in the book of
tholy ghoost says thus / The glory of the diuynyte is approwued by iiij
reasons / or for he is without sin / or for that he leueth the sins / or
for that he is creator / and not creature or for that he worshipped none / but
he is worshippid / and in that is showed to us / that the blessid trynyte was
all given to us For the fader has offered all that he had / as says saint
austyn / he has sent to us his sone in prys of our rede^pcion / and the holy
ghoost in sign of our adopcio^ / Semblably the sone of god / has given him
self unto us For thus says saint bernard / he is our pastor / he is our
pasture / and he is our rede^pcion For he gaf his soul in pris of our
rede^pcion / his blood in to drynk / his flesh in to mete / and his dyuynyte in
to fynal reward / Se^blably the holy ghoost gaf him self all to us / like as
thapostle says / by ye holy ghost is given the word of sapie^ce to one / to
another of science / and thus of all graces particular is given by the same
holy ghoost / and hereof says saint lion the (...) / The holy ghoost is
thynspyrer of the faith / gyuer of science techer of chastete / and cause of
all health / As to the second / he is sent in iiij manners / that is to wete /
that the holy ghoost in ij manners / Inuysebly and vysebly As touching in to the
hert^s pure and chaste he descended vysybyly / when by sum sign vysyble he is
showed / Of the sendyng Inuysyble says saint Ioh^n / Iohannis iij. Spiritus
vbi wlt spirat / The holy ghoost where he will he Inspyreth the hertes / but
thou know not whens he comes / ne whither he will goo / And it is no
merueylle / For as saint bernard says of this word niuysyble / he is not
entered by the eyes for he is not colored / ne by the eeres for he sowneth not
/ ne by the nosethrelles / For he is not meddled with the air / ne he enters
not by the conduyte of the mouth / For he may not be swolowed ne by the felyng
or attouchyng / For he is not manyable ne may not be handlyd Thou demaundest
then if he has sought any place naturelle or humayne by which thou mygktest
know that he be comen in to the / Know thou says saint benrard / that of the
^ moeuyng of the heart / I have understand by his presence / And by the fleyng
of vices / I have felt the virtue of his puyssaunce And by the discuscion and
repreuyng of my sins hid I am ameruaylled of the depnesse of sapyence And
of thamendement of my manners how lytyl and small that they be / I have
experience of the bounte of his mansnetude and of the reformacion and
renouacion of the spirit of my heart / I have perced the thyknes and the
noblenes of his beauty / And of the regard and consideracio^ of all thise
things / I am abasshid of the multitude of his gretnes / The sendyng vysible /
when it is in any sign visible it shows / And it is to wete that in five
signs visible / the holy ghoost is sent and showed / First in sign of a
douue upon Ih^u christ wha^ he was baptized / luce iij ye holy ghoost descended
in bodyly lykne^ of a douue upon him Secondly in lyknes of a fair cloud and
clear upon Ihesu crist at his tra^sfiguracio^ mathei xvij / (...) he ye
tspekyng a bright cloud shadowed them / this was upon ye mount thabor / where
Ihesu christ spack with saint Petir James and Johan And thus as he spack there
descended a clear cloud that couerd hem all / where as the gloss saiththus /
When Ihesu christ was baptized / and also when he was clarefyed the mysterye of
the trynyte was shewde / The holy ghoost was showed at baptesme in lyknes of
a douue / and in the hylle in lyknes of a clear montaygne and cloud Thyrdly he
was sheewde in lyknes of a blowyng or a blaste / as says saint Johan /
Iohannis vicesimo / He brethed and blewe on them and said Take ye the holy
ghoost in you / of whom ye foryeue the sins / they shall be foryeuen / And of
whom ye reteyne the sins / they shall be retained / Fourthly in lyknes of fire
Fyftly in lyknes of tongues / And in these two manners he appiered to us to give
us to understand / that the propretees of the tongue and of fire he puts in
the hertes / where he descends / The douue has wayllyng for his ^^nge / she
has no galle / she makes her hows in an hole / or in a wall of stone / And
thus the holy ghoost / them that he replenessheth / he makes them to waylle
for their sins / Whereof says Ysaye the prophet / Ysaye lix / we all shall
rore like beres / and waylle like dowues in thynkyng humbly and bytterly how we
have erred against the scripture / And for this comfort us thappostle saint
poul / ad Romanos viij / The holy ghoost ceasseth not to pray for us / in
moeuyng us to wayllynges without nombre / for our sins which ben without
nombre / Secondly the douues ben without galle / And the holy ghoost makes
them such / where he descends / For that is his nature / Whereof says the
wise man / Sapiencie xij / O quam bonus et suauis etc^ / O lord god how much
good and sweet is this spyrite in us Item in the same place / he is called
sweet / benygne / and humayne / of that he makes us benygne and humayn that is
to wete sweet in word / benygne in heart and humayne in work / Thyrdly the
douues dwell within the holes of walls of stone / that is to say / in the
wounds of Ihesu christ / he makes them dwell / that he fulfylleth / whereof it
is said in the cantykes / Canticorum ij / Arise thou my spouse / my love / and
my douue my spouse and love / that is a devout soul / and come my douue / for
to nourysshe small pygeons in the holes of the wall that is in the wounds of
our lord / whereof saint Iherome says / Spiritus oris nostri etc^ thus as he
would say / the spirit that is of our mouth / that is Ihesu christ / For he is
our mouth / and our flesh makes us say to christ / In thyn vmbre / that is
in thy passion in which Ihesu christ was obscure. derke: and despyted / we shall
live by contynuel memory / Secondly he was showed in lyknes of a cloud / The
cloud is lift up fro therthe / by virtue of the son / And nourysshith and
engendryth rayn And refresshyth and coleth thayer and therthe / Thus the holy
ghoost / them that he replenesshith he lyfteth fro therthe for to despise
therthely things / as says the prophet / Ezechiel / The holy ghoost has
lift me in to the air between heuene and earth / and has brought me in to
Iherusalem in the vysio^ of god Secondly he refressheth therthe that is the
hertes / against the dryenesse of brennyng of vices / And of this was said to
the virgyne marye / Spiritus sanctus superuemet in te: etc^ The holy ghoost
shall come in the / And the virtue of him that is highest shall shadow the / and
fro all ardour of vices shall cole the / And the holy ghoost is called water /
by cause that water has the virtue and nature to refresshe and cole / whereof
says saint Ioh^n theuangelyst / Fro the holy ghoost the flodes of living water
shall run / And that same says he of the holy ghost / which thappostles
received and of them that receyuyd him / For the ryuers ran through all the
world upon them that byleuyd in god / Thyrdly he engendryth rain / the which
descends by dropes / And this is that david says / The holy ghoost shall
blow / and make waters to flow / that is to say by the teeris coming fro the
heart droppyng fro the eyes / Fourthly he is showed in lyknes of breath / which
is a spyrite of the heart / which is cast out by the mouth / which is light /
hot / Sweet / and necessary to brethe with Thus the holy ghoost is light to
be shed / in to a man / he is most swyfte of any thing that is moeuable / as
the gloss says upon this word / factus est repent de celo sonus et cetera /
At the coming of the holy ghoost / he made moeuyng as of thondre / and of wind
/ vehement and sodayn and fulfyllyd all the hows / where thappostlis saten /
which abode him in great devotion / For the grace of the holy ghoost / wrought
not in his operacio^ of space / ne of time / but he had sodeyn mocyon /
Secondly he is hoote for to enflamme the hertes / whereof Ihesu christ says / I
am comen to ^ast fire in therthe / but this is that brenneth and enflammeth the
hertes / And is compared to wind which is hot / whereof is said in the
canticles / Vem auster et perfla ortum meum / Come wind of the south and blow
in my gardyn / that is my soul / Thyrdly he is sweet / for to make sweet the
hertes and therefore he is named by the name of vnxyo^ ye sweet vnxion of him
techeth us which apperteyneth to our health / And it is named by name of dew
/ whereof syngeth holy church / Et sui roris as percione fecundet / where she
prays that the aspercio^ and spryngyng of the dew make our hertes to grow
in virtues and also by space of time stylle and calm / After the stroke of the
fire descended a sweet sown of air soft and small / And there was our lord /
Fourthly it is necessary to brethe in such manner / that if it might not
issue out of the mouth / that he might not brethe / anon^ the man should deye /
And thus should we understand of the holy ghoost / after this that david says
Auferes spiritum eorum et deficient / et in puluerem etc^ / lord god as soon as
thou shall take away their spyryte / they shall faylle / And therefore says he
/ Emitte spiritum tuum etc^ / Lord god send thy spirit in to the^ and they
shall be created by spyrituel life and be renewed / For the holy ghoost is he
that gives life / Fourthly he was showed in the lyknes of fire /

Fyftly in lyknes of tongues / And the cause for which he appiered in thyes
two manners / I shall here after say / As to the third pryncypal in which time
he was sent / he was on the fyfty day sent after ester for to give to us
knowleche that the holy ghoost came / And it is the perfection of the law / the
remuneracio^ perdurable / and the remyssion of sins it appiereth of the
perfection of the law For fro the day that the la^be was sacrefied in that
old law / the law was delyuerd the fyfty day after yt / as the church says
in fire And also in the new testament / fyfty days after ester descended the
holy ghoost on the mount of syon in lyknes of fire / like as the law was give
in the highest of the mount of Synay / so the holy ghoost in the solier where ye
soupper of Ihesu christ and of his appostles was made / In this appiereth that
the holy ghoost is the perfection of all the law / For in that is the
plenytude of dilection / Secondly the perdurable remuneracion is in the holy
ghoost / whereof the gloss says thus / that the forty days in which our lord
conuersed with his disciples / signfeye the holy church / also the fyfty day /
on which the holy ghoost was given expressheth the penny of the last
retrybucion / and reward perdurable / Thirdly of the holy ghoost is the
remyssyon of sins / as says the gloss / Therefore it was given in the fyfty
day / by cause in the fyfty year was the Iubylee / and all thing pardonned And
by the holy ghoost the sins ben pardonned / And it follows in the gloss / In
the Iubylee spyrytuel / the prysonners ben delyuerd / the debtes ben quyted /
the exyled ben repelled and called home / therytages ben rendryd / And the
bond men ben rendered from their seruytud and made free / And the gylty of death
ben made quyte and delyuerd / whereof says scynt poul The law of the spyryte
of life in Ihesu Christ has delyuerd me fro the law of sin and of death /
After the dettes of sin be left / for charity couerith and quenchith great
multitude of sins / The exiled men ben called home / And the prophet says /
Spiritus tuus bonus etc^ / Lord thy / good spirit has brought me in to the
right land of my contree / that is in to heaven /

The heritage lost is rendrid / whereof says saint poul / The holy ghoost had
given wytnes to our spyryte that we ben the sons of god / And if we be sons
we be heirs / which were servants to sin we be made free to god / For
where the holy ghoost is / there is fraunchyse and lyberte / As touching the
fourth / how often he was sent to thappostles / after that the gloss says /
he was given to them by three times / that is to wete to fore the passion of
Ihesu christ / after the resurrection / and after thascencion / First ^o do
miracles Secondly to relece the sins / And thyrdly to conferme the hertres /

First when he sent them to preche / and to cast fendes out of bodies / and
to hele the seek malades / he gaf to them the puissaunce / And thise meruaylles
did they by the holy ghoost / Nevertheless it is not consequent that who some
ever have the holy ghoost do miracles / For / saint gregory says the miracles
makes not a man holy / but show him holy / ne also every man that does
miracles has not the holy ghoost /

For evil people auaunte them to have don miracles saying / lord lord say they
have not well prophesyed in thy name / thou have given to us the spyryte of
prophesye / God does miracles by his angellys by matter amyable that they have /
And the fendes by virtues natural / which ben in things created naturelly /
And thenchaunter by help of fendes / The good christian man by Justice publyque
/ The evil christian man by signs of Justice / Secondly they had the holy ghoost
/ when he brethed on the^ saying / take ye the holy ghost in to you to whom ye
loose their sins they shall be loosed / and of whom ye reteyne / they shall be
retained / Nevertheless none sauf god may foryeue sins / as to the sin that
is in the soul / and which is thobligaciion to pain pardurable or as to
thoffence of god / the which is only foryeuen by the Infusion of the grace of
god / and by the force and virtue of c^ntricion / nevertheless we say that the
priest assoylleth of sins / as for that he is Insynued or shows that the
sinner is assoylled of god / as to that / that the pain that should be
perpetuel / he chau^geth in to temporal of purgatory / and also for that the
pain temporal is dew he releceth party / Thyrdly the holy ghoost was given
to them on this day / when he confermed so their hertes / that they dredde no
tormente / by the virtue of the holy ghost which all ouercometh / whereof
says saint Austyn / Such is the grace of the holy ghoost / that if he find
heaviness in the heart / he breketh it if he find desire of evil / he
destroys it / if he find vain dread / he cast it out / And Saint lion the
pope says / the holy ghoost was hoped of thappostles / not for the^ first he
had enhabited in them / but by cause that the hertes to him sacred and dedyed
more should vysite them / and more habundantly by grace should abide in
encreacyng his yeftes not then bygon of which he was not newly showing his
operacion / For his largess passed all habondaunce / As to the fyfthe / that
is to wite how he was sent / it is to be known / that he was sent / with
great sown in tongues of fire / the which tongues appiered syttyng / And the
sown was sodeyn fro heaven vehement / and shynyng / It was sodeyn / For he had
no need of space temporell / It was fro heaven / For he made them celestyall
that he re^lenesshyd / vehement / For he gaf dread of love / or for that / that
he took away the sorrow perdurable / which is malediction / or for that / that
he bare the heart out of carnal love / also he was replenesshyng / For he
fulfyled all thappostles as says saint luc / Repleti sunt omnes spiritu sancto
/ And it is to wete that there ben iij signs of replenyssyng that were in
thappostles / The first is that the place where he is yeueth no sown / like a
tonne of wyn that is full / to this purpoos spekyth Job / Shall not the ox cry
and rore / when the rack is full / The ox shall not bow ne cry when the
crybbe shall be full / like as he would say / Wha^ the heart is full of grace /
him ought not grudche by impacience / This sign had thappostles / For in the
tribulacion that they had / they resowned not ne grudched by Impacience / but
Ioyously went to the presence of the tyrauntes to prison and to torments /
The second sign is that he may receive no more / ellis he were not full / In
this manner he that is all filled demands no more / In like wise the saints
that have plenytude of grace / may receive none other licour of erthely
delectacion / And by cause they have tasted the swetnes of heaven they have none
appetyte to the erthely delectacions / whereof says saint Austyn / who so
drynketh one drope of delyces of paradys / the which one drope is gretter /
than all the sea occean / which ought to be understood / that all the thurst
of this world is in him extyncte / And this sign had thappostles / which would
have none of the goods of this world in propre / but put it all in common The
third sign / is for to run over out / as it appierith by a River which
aryseth and renneth over his banks / As salamon says / which fyllyth as
phison wysedom / This flode or river phison / of his nature arises and
spryngeth over / and watreth and arrouseth the bond about him / In like wise
thappostles began to sprede abroad / For after they had received the holy
ghoost they began to speak diverse langages / where the gloss says / that /
that was the sign of plenytude / For the vessel full shedeth over / as it
appiereth of saint Peter / For anon as he began to preche he ^^nuerted three
thousand / Secondly he was sent in tongues of fire / And here be three things
to be considered / First for whom he was sent conioynctly in the tongues of
fire / Secondly wherefore he was sent in tongues of fire more than in another
element / Thirdly wherefore he was sent in tongues more / tha^ in another membre
/ As to the first / for three reasons he was sent and appiered in tongues of
fire / to the end that their words should enflamme the hertes / Secondly that
they should preche the fyry law of god / Thirdly that they should know that the
holy ghoost which is fire spack in them / And that they should doubt nothing /
And by cause all men should here the words of god / And they should attrybue ne
take to them self that they converted by their predicacion / but by the words
of god / Of the second we ought to know that he was sent in lyknes of fire for
many reasons / The first is taken after the seven virtues of grace / The holy
ghoost came in the manner of fire for to make meke high things by the yefte of
dread / he amolyfyeth and softeth hard things by the yefte of pity he
illumyneth hard things by ye yefte of science / he restrayneth the flodes of
vices by the yefte of counseyl / he affermeth and consolideth soft things by
the yefte of str^ngthe / he clereth the ruste of sin by the yefte of
understanding / he draws up the creatures by the yeft of sapience / The
second reason is taken after his dignyte and excellence / the fire surmounteth
and excedeth all other elements in beauty / in order / and in virtue / In
beauty by cause of the fayrnes of light / In order by cause of his situacion /
In virtue / by cause of vigor in operacion / In like wise the holy ghoost in
these iij things excedeth all For the first he is said the holy ghoost pure
without fylthe / For the second / holy ghoost which compriseth all other
spyrites of understanding / by his incomprehensibilite / For the third he is
said holy ghost having all virtue for he is Invyncyble For he has all
strength seeing all things fro far / The third reason is taken as to his
manyfold effect And this reason assigns Rabanus saying that the fire has
iiij virtues or natures / It brenneth / it purges / it chauffeth / and it
lights / In like wise the holy ghoost brenneth the sins / he purges the
hertes / he casts away all coldness and dread of the hertes / And he
enlumyneth them that been ignorant Of the first says zacharye the prophet /
He broyleth and brenneth the h^rtes / as the fire brenneth the silver / Also
david said / Lord I pray the brenne my reins and my heart / and dry them fro
all sin / he purges also the hertes / after that as says ysaye / When our
lord had wasshe away the fylthes of the daughters of syon / and has purged the
blood of Iherusalem fro the myddle of him / in the spirit of Judgment / and in
the spyryte of brennyng / then shall they be in sauete and surete / and kept
against all tempeste / And the prophet speaks of the purgacion that shall be
made at last / when all shall be purged pure and clean that shall goo in to
heaven / he casts out also all coldenes and pusyllanymyte of the hertes /
whereof thappostle says / Be ye fervent in spyryte / that is of heart / the
which thing the holy ghoost makes / when he espriseth him of his love And
hereof says saint gregory / The holy ghost appyered in fire for all the hertes
which he replenessid / and voyded the coldness of fere / and enflamed them with
desire of the glory perdurable / He enlumyned also the ygnorauntes / whereof
says the wise man / Lord god who shall know thy science / if thou give not thy
sapience and send to us thyn holy spyryte from above / that is he that all
enseyneth and techeth / The fourth reason is taken after the nature of his
love / Love is sygnefied by the fire for iij causes / The first cause is / for
the fire is always moeuyng / So is it of the holy ghost / For them that he
replenesshith / he makes them to be in contynuel moeuyng of good operacion /
whereof says saint gregory / The love of god is never idle / as long as it is
in the heart of a devout person / it fructyfyeth / And it fructyfyeth not /
it is a sign that it is not there The second is / For the fire emonge all the
other elementis has but little matere / but strong virtue in operacion it has
in his qualite / Thus the holy ghoost whom he replenesseth makes them to have
but little ne lot^ erthely things / and greatly to spyrituel things in so
mochethey love not worldly things more wordly / but spyrytuelly / Saint
bernard puts iiij manners of love / yt is to wete to love ye world flesshly /
the spyrite flesshly / the flessh spyrituelly / and the spyryte spyrytuelly /
The third cause is for that the fire abassheth and meketh the things hye / he
has tendede on hye things despercled to vnye them / and them despercled to
being to gydre / And by thyes three things ben vnderstonden three ver / tues of
love / For as says saint denis in the book of the names dyuyne / the fire has
iij virtues For he enclyneth the hye things down / he lyfteth the things low
in heyght / he ordeyneth the things egall to their ordenaunce / And these three
things makes the holy ghoost in them that he replenesshyth / For he enclyneth
them by humylyte / he lift them up in desire of hye things / And ordeyneth
them to gydre by unity of manners Thyrdly he apyered in lyknes of a tongue more
than in an another membre / And for iij reasons / The tongue is the membre that
is enflamed of the fire of hell / and is of great dyffyculte to govern / And
proufytable when it is well governed / And by cause that the tongue was enflamed
of the fire of hell / she had need that the holy ghoost should come tenflame
it / as says saint James / It is the fire of the holy ghoost / and by cause it
is evil and lightly governed / she has the more need / For after that / that
saint James says in his cronycle / All nature of bestes of birds and of
serpens ben maystryed and ruled by man / but the tongue may not be maystryed /
And by cause it is a membre proufytable when it is well governed Therefore he had
need of the holy ghoost that should govern it / he appiered also in a tongue
which is much necessary / To prechours he is necessary For he makes them
to speak fervently without dread / and therefore he was in that lyknes / as
says saint bernard / The holy ghoost descended upon the disciples in tongues
of fire / to the end that they should preche and speak the law of the tongues of
fire / The holy glooost also makes them to speak and preche hardyly and
constan^ly / as saint luc says in thactes of thappostles / They were all
replenesshyd with the holy ghoost / and begone to speak with hardynesse the
word of god / he makes them also to speak in many manners / for the great and
diverse multitude of hierers / And therefore it is said / they began to speak
with diverse tongues / in such wise as the holy ghoost admynystred to them /
he made them also to preche prouffytably to the edyfycacyon of the people /
whereof says ysaye / The holy ghoost is descended upon me and has enoynted me
with his grace / whereof he had made my words playsaunt and prouffytable to
thelthe of creatures / Thyrdly the tongues appiered syttyng / in signefyeng
that he was necessary to prefidentes and Iuges / For he gives auctoryte for
to pardone and to foryeue sins / as says saint Ioh^n / take ye the holy ghost / by whom ye shall take away the sins of them that will repent them /
he yeueth also wysedom for to deem and Judge / whereof says ysaye / I shall put
says god my spyrite upon them that shall Judge and deem truly / he gives also
debonnayrte and swetnes for to supporte and molyfye the Judgment as it is said
Numeri x. I shall give to my people of my spyryte that is in the / for to
supporte the burden of my people / The spyryte of moses was the spyryte of
benygnyte and of swetnes that was in him / for to Judge the people / Moses was
most meke and most debonayr / and therefore god delyuerd to him his people for to
govern / The holy ghoost gives also aournement of holiness for tenforme / as
says the scripture / The holy ghoost has aourned the heuenes / that been the
hertes wherein he descends / And as to the sixth in to whom he was sent in to
thappostles / that were vessellis clean and pure and disposed to receive the
holy ghoost / And that for vij causes that were in them / first they were
quyete and paysyble in heart / And this segnefieth that is songen / Dum
complerentur dies pentecostes etc^ / The day of the pentecost they were all to
gydre in one place still be assembled / The day of the pentecost is the day of
rest / after that ysaye says / upon whom shall my spyryte descend / but upon
an humble heart and being stylle / Secondly he was herd by dylection / And
this is that the scripture says / Erant omnes parit^r / They were all to
gydre for they were all of one heart and of one will / And thus the spyrite of
man gives not life to the members / but that they be to gydre / in like wise
the holy ghoost gives not spyrituel life but to the me^bres unied spyrituelly /
And as the fire quenchith and goth out when the brondes ben taken away so the
holy ghost goth away when the members by dyscorde ben divided / and therefore
it is songen of thappostles / that the holy ghoost fond them all of one
accord by love and by charity / and enlumined them with clernes shynyng in
them of the dyuyne deyte / thyrdly they were in a secret place / For they were
in the place / where Ihesu christ made with them his maundey / or soupper /
whereof is said Ozee ij / I shall led man's soul in to a solytarye place / and
shall speak to it in secret / Fourthly they were in oryson and prayer /
contynuell whereof is songen / Orantibus appostolis deum venisse etc^ / when
they were in prayer then came the holy ghoost upon them which prayer is
necessary / to receive the holy ghoost / like as the wise man says / I have
prayed god / and the holy ghoost is comen in me / whereof says Ihesu christ /
Ioh^is xiij / I shall pray god my fader / And I shall send to you in my stead
the holy ghoost that shall comfort you / Fyftly they were garnysshyd with
humylite and mekenes / And that is / that they were syttyng when the holy
ghoost came / And hereof says david / lord god thou art he that sendest the
fontaynes / in to the valeyes / that is the holy ghoost which is the fontayne
of grace / which he sends in to the humble hertes / Syxtly they were in peace
to gydre / in that is to be understand / that they were in Iherusalem / which
is as much to say / as the vysion of pees / And that pees is necessary to
receive the holy ghoost / our lord shewde when he came to them after his
resurrection saying / Pax vobis / Peace be with you / and after said / take ye
the holy ghost / Seuently they were lift up in contemplacion / And this is to
understand that they received the holy ghoost in an hye place / whereof says ye
gloss / who that now desires the holy ghoost in his heart / late him put the
house of his flessh under his feet / by lyftyng up his heart by conte^placion /
And as to the seuenthe wherefore he was sent / it is to be noted For vij causes
he was sent / that been vnderstonden in this auctorite / Paraclitus autem
spu^ssanctus: quem mittet pater in noi^e meo. ille vos docebit omnia / The
first cause is for to conforte the soroufull / wha^ is said paraclitus / which
is as much to say as comfortour / as god says by ysaye / The spirit of god
upon me and it follows / to the end that I should comfort the wepars of Syon /
that been the daughters that saw god / whereof says saint gregore / The holy
ghoost is said comfortour / to them that he fyndeth wayllyng for their sins
that they have co^mysed / he makes ready hope of pardon in lyftyng their hertes
fro affliction of sorrow / The second is for to quykene the deed when he says
spiritus / for the spyrite is he that quykeneth / as it is said in ezechiel /
Ye bones that be dry and without life I shall send in you my spyryte / and ye
shall live / The third cause is for sanctefye and make clean the sinners / in
this that he said Sanctus as it is said spirit by cause he gives life / Also
he says Holy by cause he sanctefyeth and makes clean / and it is said pure
and clean / therefore says david / The grace of the holy ghoost which is
aflood pure and clensyng / he gladeth the cite of god / that is holy church /
and by this flood our lord has sanctefyed his tabernacle / The fourth cause
is / he is sent for to conferme love among them that been in discord and hate
/ which is noted in this word Pater / he is said fader / by cause that
naturelly he loves us as says saint Ioh^n in the gospel / Iohannis xiij /
Ihesu christ says my fader loves you as his sons / And if ye be his sons
then be ye brethern each to other / And between brethern ought alleway to
persevere love and friendship / The fyfte cause is for to save the Just and
true men / in this that he says In nomine meo / that is Ihesus / that is to
say savior / In whose name the fader to the holy ghoost to show that he came
to save the people / The syxte cause is for form the ignorau^tes / in this that
he says / Ille vos docebit oi^a / The holy ghoost wha^ he shall come he shall
teache you all things As to the seventh / that he is given or sent first in the
begynnyg of the church by prayer / as thus wha^ he came thappostlis praid god
and were in prayer / whereof is songen / Ora^tibus applis deu^ venisse /
thappostlis praie^g the holy ghoost ca^ / and luce.iij. Ih^u prayeng ye holy
ghoost descended / Secondly he came by heeryng attentyfly and devoutly the word
of god actuu^ x / As saint peter was prechyng the holy ghoost descended upon
them / Thirdly he came by holy and besy operacion / that is by this that is said
/ Imponeba^t manus super eos and accipiebant spm^ scm^ / Thappostlis put their
ho^des on them that byleued / and anon they received the holy ghoost / and this
Imposicion of thandes sygnefyeth thabsolucion of the priest / which absolucion
give us the holy ghoost / Amen /



THe great largess and benefayttes that god has distributed to criste^ people
give to the said people great dygnyte for there is no people ne never was so great
a nation / yt their gods had approached so nyghe them / ae our lord god is
unto us / The blessid sone of god would make us partyners unto his dyuynyte and
godhede / and therefore took our nature / to the end yt making him self man / he
would make men as gods / And all that he took of us / he gaf all again to us
for our sauacion / he gaf his propre body in offryng unto god the fader in the
altar of the cross for our reco^ciliacion / and shed his blood in pris and
wasshyng our sins to the^de yt we might be redemyd fro the miserable
seruytude wherein we were and that we should be also clean and cle^sid of our
sins / and also to the^de / yt this excellent benefice abide to us in
perpetuell memory / he has unto devout hertes and faithful given his owen
body in mete / and his precious blod in drynk in lyknes of bread and wyn / O
precious feste and conuyne / and verayly full of great wo^dre / ye feste
helthful and replenesshid of all swetnes / what thing may be more precious /
than ye noble co^uynye or feste / in which / not only ye flesh of calves ne
of oxen lyk as was given in thold law for to taste / but the propre body of
Ih^u which is very god is presented for receive and assauoure devoutly / what
thing might be more full of great admiracio^ / than is this holy sacram^t in
which the bread and wyn ben co^myxted substa^cyelly in to the propre body of
Ih^u And therefore Ih^u crist there is contained under the spece and lyknes of
bread and wyn / he is eten and received of ye good and true christian men / but
for that / he is not departed in pyeces ne asondred in his me^bres / but
abides all hoole and entier in euerich of his parties / For if this holy
sacram^t were divided or deperteed in a M. parties / in euerich party / should
remain (...) propre body of our lord hool and entier / None other sacreme^t is
not of somoche merit / ne so full of health as this sacram^t is / for by this
be purged the sins / the virtues ben encreaced / and the thoughts be
engrassed and fulfilled with thabundaunce of all good virtues / he is in holy
chirch offrid for the living and them that been deed / to the end that he may
prouffite to all that which is for their salvation / of all them that been
ordained and institued to consacre it / ye swetnesse of this holy sacram^t may
none express / by the which sweetness is spirituelly tasted and remembered
thexcelle^t charity that god shewde in his glorious passion / and to the end
that it might be the more ferue^tly impressed in ye hertes of devout and
faithful people / of the great largess of his charity wha^ he should deperte out
of this world and goo to god his fader / and would ete his paske lamb with his
disciples / then he institued this holy sacram^t like a memoire perdurable of
his passion / as thaccomplyssem^t of au^cyent fygures / and of the miracles
that were don by him / And also to the end that they that were sorouful and heavy
for his absence / should thereby have some solace synguler / This is a thing
then rihgt conuenyent and conuenable unto the devotion of devout hertes to
remember sole^ply thynstitucion of so helthful and meruayllous sacram^^t / to
the^de that the ineffable manner of thornau^ce and thought dyuyne / vysyble be
honored and worshipped / and that the might and puyssau^ce of god be loved and
thanked which in this sacram^t werketh so merueyllously / and also of so
helthful and of so sweet and gracious benefyce be given and rendered to god due
thankynges and graces / And how well that the day of the Cene or souper / in
which this noble sacrament was institued is special memoire made of this
sacram^t / how be it the surplus of the service of the same day apparteyneth to
the passion of our lord / In the which passion our mother holy chirch is
occupied all that day devoutly / and by cause this intusticion of so noble
sacram^t may be hallowed more solempnly / the pope urban ye fourth by great
affection that he had to this holy sacram^t moeued of great devotion / he
ordained the feste and remembrance of this holy sacram^t the first thursday
after the octaues of pentec^ste / for to be hallowed of all good christian people
to the end that use through out all the year this holy sacrem^t to our salvation
/ may do our deuoyr to this holy Institucion specially in the time / when the
holy ghoost enseyned and teched the hertes of the disciples to know the
mysterye of this holy sacram^t / For in that time there / the true faithful
disciples began to freque^te it It is read in thactes of thappostles that they
were perseuerau^t in the doctrine of thappostles / and in comynycacion / of ye
brekyng of the bread in devout oryso^s after the sendyng of the holy ghoost /
and to the^de that the holy institucio^ of this amerous sacram^t should be the
more honorably hallowed on the said day and by the vtas or octaues following /
instead distribucion material that been distributed in cathedral chirches / the
forsaid pope vr^an has given of his power and largess apostolyque / wages
spirituell and perdon special unto all the^ / that shall be personelly in clean
life at hours dyurnelle and nocturnel Of this holy solempnyte / to the^de
that every good chatholyque person should have ye more desire to come to one /
so great a solempnyte / ouerall where it shall be hallowed / / That is to wit at
matynes an C. days of perdon / at mass as much at first euensong as
much / and at second euensong on the day / also an.C. days / at hours of
pryme / of tierce / of sixth / of none / and of co^plyne at euerich of thies
hours xl. days / On the other days during ye octaues / for every day to the^
that shall be at matynes at mass / at tierce / at sixthe / none eue^ song /
and co^plyn / an C^ days of pardon / and all thise pardons of ye tresour of
the chirch by the myserycorde dyuyne he has given the^ and institued tendure
perpetuelly / This sacram^t fygured our lord When he sent Ma^na fro heaven /
unto ye old fadres in deserte / where they were fed with mete celestial /
and it is said that the me^ had eten bread of angellis / but alleway all they
that had eten thereof they deyden in deserte / But this mete that ye now receive
is the living bread which descended fro heuene / that admynystred the
substance of the life eternell / and therefore who someuer receive this bread
here worthyly / he shall never deye eternelly / for this is the propre body of
Ih^u crist / now co^sidere here then / which is most excellent and most
proufytable / the bread of thangellis / or the propre body of Ihesu crist /
which is life perdurable The manna aforsaid ca^ fro heaven / This precious flessh
is above ye heuene / This ma^na is celestyalle / This flessh here is god the
creator of heuenes / the ma^na was kept unto the morn / and was corrupt this
bread may feel no corrupcio^ / To them in deserte abouesaid spra^ge water out
of a stone / to us is sprongen the blood of thamerous Ih^u crist / The water
refresshith them for an hour / but the precious blood of Ih^u crist wessheth
us perpetuelly / The Jews drank / and always were a thurst / but thou christian
man wha^ thou have dro^ken of this beuurage here you may never after have
thurst / That other was given to the^ in a shadow and vmbre / but this was
given in truth now ye shall understood this that was in ye shadow / they
drank of the water yt issued out of the stone / this stone was Ih^u christ /
and yet they plesed not always in their works to god / and therefore deyed they
in deserte / All tho things there were don in figure / for to give knowleche of
things more great and more notable / It is much gretter thing of the light /
than of the shadow / semblably of verite / than it is of figure / And also
much gretter of ye body of our cratour and maker / than it is of the manna
that came fro heaven / Thou shall demand peradventure how thou affermest and
assurest me that I receive the body of Ih^u crist whah I see another thing / we
have many examples / by the which we may well preue / that it which thou
receyuest is not that thing that nature has fourmed / but it is well that yt
the benediction has consecrated / the benedictio^ has gretter might than
nature / for by benenedictio^ oftymes nature has been changed / Moses that
held a rod in his hand / wha^ he cast it to the earth / it beca^ a
serpente / Anon he took it up / and it turned in to the nature of a rod /
Thou see then how by the grace of the prophet / the nature has be
changed twies of the serpent / and of the rod / the ryuers of egypt ran
sometime their course naturell / but suddenly by ye veins of the fo^taynes blood
began to issue / and run so long that the people wist not for to drink /
after at the prayer of the prophet / the river of blood cessed / and came again
to his nature of water / as it was before / the people of the ebrews was on a
time all enuyro^ned and enclosed of thegipciens between the sea and them /
Moses lift up his rod / and then the water departed / and assambled unto
the lyknes of a wall / and there appiered to them a way for to goo on foot /
And the flood of Jordan in his propre place against his nature / returned against
the hill / The old faders that were in deserte also on a time had great thurst
/ moses took his rod and smote a stone out of ye which issued great
habu^dance of water Is not ye grace of benedictio^ which has we ought above
nature / when the stone gives water / which he may not by nature / Marach
which was a River right bitter in such^ ^yse that the people that had great
thurst / might not drink it / Moses put a staf in the water and suddenly by
the grace of benediction which there wrought / it lost his bitterness and becam
sweet / Semblably in the time of elysee the propheete / one of the sons of the
prophets let fall the yro^ of his axe in the water / the which yro^ after
his nature sa^ck dou^ to the bottom of the water / Then he ca^ to helysee
prayeng him for his axe / helysee put his bourdon in the water / and anon the
iron began to swymme above ye water / which is a thing above nature / for the
weiht of the iron is heuyer than the lycour of the watre / by all thise things
and by the blessings of prophets we see clerrely how grace or benediction
has thus wrouht above nature / and then since that benedictio^ humayne
diverse times has thus co^uertid things against nature / what shall we say of
the consecracion dyuyne / where the words of god work / For this holy
sacrement here that thou receyuest / is consecrate of the word of Ih^u^ christ
/ Then if ye word of helye was of so great effect that it made fire to
descend from heaven / of moch^ more valewe and effect is ye word of Ihesu
christ for to torn the lyknes of elements / ye have read of the works of the
world / as god said and commanded so was it made / he commanded and it was made
/ And the word that made all thing of naught / may not the same change the
things / that have been made in to other spece and lyknes / It is not less to
him to create things than to change things / we show also the mysterye of
thyncarnacion of our maker Ihesu christ / was not that above nature that Ihesu
christ was born of the vyrgyne marye / if thou demand of thordenaunce of nature
/ thou know that the woman has acusto^me to conceive by the seed of man /
But the vyrgyne marie engendryd and conceived above thordenau^ce of nature and
alleway remained a vyrgyne / And this holy sacrement / that we now consecrate
/ is the propre body of Ihesu christ / that was born of the vyrgyne / Wherefore
then sechest thou of thordenaunce of the precious nature / of Ihesu christ /
when he is above all nature / He that was born of the vyrgyne is the propre
flessh of Ihesu christ / the which was crucyfyed and buried / And verily this
propre flessh is in this sacrament Our savor Ihesu christ says Lo this is my
propre body / to fore the benedictio^ of the celestial words it is another
especie / but after the consecracion it is the propre body of our lord / For
as soon as the consecracion is preferred and said the substance of the bread is
converted in to the blessid body of Ihesu christ / and in like wise of the wine
and water in the chalys / after the words of consecratyon said is the very
body of our lord also hool in flessh and blood / All the remenaunt that is said
in the mass ben praysynges and lonynges / to our lord and also prayers for the
church / for the kings and for the people But when this holy sacrament is
consecrate the pres^e uses not his owen worrdes / but he speaks the propre
words of Ihesu christ and so consacreth the sacrement / the which word of
Ihesu christ is it / by which all thing was made / the heaven / the earth and
the sea / then may thou see what a werker is the word of Ihesu christ / And
sith that so much might and power is in the word of Ihesu christ / that it
which never had been / began to be / Then by much more reason may he make
that is / to be converted in to other substance / And thus that which was
bread to fore the consecracion / is the propre body of Ihesu crist after the
consecracion / And thus has our blessed lord left to us his blessed body for
to be honored and worshyppyd here in earth / And by reason me thinks he
might do no less / consyderyng our Instablenes / and how prone the people
have been to worshipe falls gods / and ydolles / And how often his owen chosen
people the Jews / departed fro his laws and took to them falls gods /
notwithstondyng the great miracles and merueyllous that he did and showed for
them / than to leave his own propre body here emonge us daily to be remembryd
in eschewyng of all ydolatrye for the salvation of our souls / Whom we byseche
that we may receive unto our perpetual / salvation Amen /

The Dedicacion of the Temple or of the church
THe Dedicacion of the church is solempnly hallowed emonge the other feestes of
the chirch And by cause that it is double church or Temple that is to wete
material and spyrytuell / And therefore it is to be seen shorthly of the
dedicacion of this double temple / As to the dedicacion of the temple materyall
/ iij things ben to be considered / first wherefore it is hallowed or dedicate /
Secondly how it is hallowed / Thirdly by whom it is hallowed / And by cause that
ij things ben in the church that been hallowed / that is the altar and the
temple / therefore it is first to be seen how the altar is hallowed / The altar
is first hallowed for three things / First to make sacrefise to god as it is
said genesis viij. Noe edyfyed first an altar to our lord / and took of all
the birds and of all the beestes of the world and offered them upon the altar
/ and the sacrefise that we make upon ye altar is the body and blood of Ih^u
crist that we sacrefye in memoire of the passion of our lord after yt he
comanded us and said Do ye this in my memory / we have iij memoryes of the
passion of our lord yt one is the mind of the passion him of that we have in
writing / and that other ymagyned in figure / and yt is to the sight for
thymage of Ih^u crist / and of the other images that be^ in the church for the
remembrance of Ih^u crist and of his saints is for to moeue ye deuocio^ of
the people Thise ben also as ye books of the lay people / and thise ij
memoryees ben but one / The second memory is in word / that is the passion of
our lord prechid / and this mind is as to the heeryng / The third mind is
the passion of our lord tra^sfigured in to this sacrem^t / which is verily the
soul / body / and blood of Ih^u crist / and this mind is as to ye tastyng /
and if the passion of Ih^u crist which is wreton enbraceth ye tale^te / and
that which is prechid e^braceth it yet more / Much more ouht this sacrem^t
enfla^me in which it enprynted so signyficatly / Secondly as for to call ye
name of our lord / whereof is said genesis xij / abraham edefyed an altar to
our lord / and this inuocacion or-callyng ought to be made / after yt
thappostle says to thymothee / or by prayers made by admyracio^ for to take
away ye euyllis fro us / Or by orysons made to get the goods / or by
requests made te^creace the goods and to keep them / The first that is made
upon the altar is said proprely a mess by cause that Ih^u crist is sent fro
heaven / And this word mess proprely is said of sendyng / and to the mess
Ih^u crist is sent from his fader / and sacreth the same h^ste / For first we
have him fro his fader sent to us by his incarnacion / And after sent of us to
his fader by his passion / And first he began to be with us by sacrefyeng And
we with him by this oblacion that he pray for us / And it is to wete that the
mess is songen in three langages / that is in greek / in hebrew / and in latin
/ And is for to represente the title which was set on the cross in his
glorious passion / which was in greek / hebrew / and latyne / And also for to
signefye that all manner langage ought to preyse god / The tongue latin is
thoffyce gospel and pystell / And the song in greek is the kyryes which ben
said ix times that we may come to the ix ordres of Angellis / The hebrew is
Alleluya / Sabbath / and Osanna / Thirdly it is hallowed for to sing on / And
hereof says the book of ecclesiaste the xlvij chapitre / he ordained them power
against their enemies / and made them to be put away fro about the altar / and
made the syngers to sing and to give sweet melodyes in their sown / and said
melodyes in plurel nombre / after that hugo de sancto victore says there ben
three sownes that make three melodyes / For there is a sown by smytyng / by wind
and by song / the touching or smytyng apparteyneth to the harp / And the
wind to thorganes / And the voys to the song And this concordaunce of song /
and touching of tharpe may be ass^gned to the concordaunce of good manners / For
as to the touching of tharpe / it may be reported to the work of the hands /
and blowyng of thorganes / to the devotion of the thought / And the song of
the voys to the prechyng of the word of god but in this what proufyteth the
swetnes of the voys without the swetnes of the heart / She breketh the voys /
but the will keeps the concordaunce of the voys and of good manners / so that
by ensample he accord him to his neghbour / and by his good will he accord
him to god / and by obedyence to his maistre / and this is the treble manner of
musyke / which is reported to the treble difference of thoffyce of the church
/ For thoffyce of the church is made in psalms in lessons and in song The
first manner of musyke is made by touching of fyngres / as in the sawtrye and
semblable instrumentis / The second is the song as of the voys / and that
aparteyneth to the lessons / And thereof says / Sing ye to him in deportyng
your voys / The third that is by blowyng / apparteyneth to the song of a
trompe / And hereof says david / Praise ye him in the sown of the trompe / The
temple or the church is hallowed for five reasons / The first is by cause that
the devil and all his power be put out / Whereof saint gregorye recounteth in
his dialogue / that as a church of theretyques Arryens was yelden to good
christian men And they hallowed it / and had brought in relics of saint fabyen
and sebastyen / and of saint agathe all the people were there assembled and
they herd suddenly an hog cry and run hither and thither emonge their feet
sechyng the doors of the church / And he might not be seen of noman / whereof
the people had great meruaylle / But our lord showed to them / that it was the
foul spirit that dwelled to fore in that place / And that night was a great
noise upon the coueryng of the church / like as they had run upon it / And
the second night was yet a gretter noise / And the third night was so ferdful
and so horrible agrete noise as that the church should have be thorwen down
unto the fou^deme^t / And then the wicked spirytes departed and came no more
there / The hydows sown signefyed that for certain the f^nde issued by
constraynt / the which he had long holden / Secondly it is hallowed by cause
that they that flee to the church should be sauf / whereof sum chirches after
the dedicacion be preuyleged of princes / that they that been culpable and fle
to the church that they may be sauf / whereof the Canone says / The church
defends the culpables fro blood / that they ne lose life ne member / And
therefore Ioab fled to the tabernacle / and took the altar Thirdly it is
hallowed by cause that the orysons be enhaunsed there / And it is signefyed in
the book of kings the viij chapitre / when the temple was dedicate / Solomon
said / who someuer shall pray in this place / thou shall here him lord in
heuene / And when thou have herd him thou shall be to him debonayr / And we
worship god in the chirches toward the cest / for three reasons / after that
danyel says in the fourth book the first chapitre First by cause that we show
/ that we require our peace / Secondly that we behold Ihesu crist crucyfyed /
Thirdly that we show that we abide him a Judge to come And danyel says / God
planted paradys in the house of the eest / Fro the which he exyled man / by
cause he brake his commandment / and made him to dwell to fore paradys toward
thoccydent / er he went any other part / and therefore we look now in the
church toward thoryent / And our lord crucyfyed beheld toward thoccyde^t And
thus look we worshyppyng him toward thoryent / he was born an hye / and so
worship him thappostles / And so shall he come as they saw him gooyng to
heuene / And so worship we him toward thoryent in abydyng till he come /
Fourthly the church is hallowed by cause that there lou ynges and preysynges be
rendered and given to god / And this is done at vij times or hours
canonycalls / at matyns at pryme / at tierce and so at other / And how be it
that god is to be preysed in all the hours of the day / but by cause our
infirmyte suffyseth not thereto / it is ordained that at thise hours we praise
god specially / by cause that thies hours in some thing ben more preuyleged
than the other / for at mydnyght when matyns ben songen Ih^u christ was born /
and also was taken and despised of the Jews / And at same hour he despoylled
hell / taking mydnyght largely that is to say before day he aroos fro death to
lif And he appiered at hour of pryme / and it is said that he shall come to
the dome at mydnyght / whereof saint Iherome says / I wene that tho things
that thappostles have said shall be by fore day /

For the day of the vygylle of ester before mydnyght it hehoueth not to leave
matynes / For the people abide the coming of Ih^u christ And when this time shall
come men ought to have surete that all men make feste that day / And we sing
at that hour praysynges / by cause that we give him thankynges for his natyuyte
/ for his taking / and of the delyuerau^ce of ye holy apostlis / so that we may
besyly abide his coming / and the lawdes ben adiousted to the matynes / by
cause that in the morrow tide he drowned thegypciens in the sea and created the
world and aroos / and at this hour late us give tha^kynges to god that we be
not drowned in the sea of this world with the egipciens / And that We render
louynges to god for our ^racion / and for his resurrection / At our of pryme
Ihesu crist came in to the temple / and the people assembled there to him as
lucas says the xxj chapitre / he was at that hour psented to pylate / And at
this hour after he was risen he appiered first to the wyme^ / and this is the
first hour of the day / And therefore late us re^dre our tha^kynges to god and
praysyng / by cause that we may follow Ih^u christ that we may yield to him the
first fruit of all our werkis / At the hour of tierce Ihesu christ was
crucified in the tongues of the Jews / and was bound to a stake and beten to
fore pilate / And as it is said the stake or pyler that he was bound to
shewyth yet his blood / And this same hour was the holy ghoost sent to
thappostles / In the syxte hour he was naylled to the cross and derknesses
were through out all the world / so that the son bywept the death of his lord /
and couerid him with black / in such wise that he gaf no light to them that
crucyfyed his lord / And at this hour was he at dinner ye day of his ascencion
with his disciples / At hour of none Ih^u christ gaf up his spyrite / and the
knight percyd his side / And the company of thappostles had a custom for
tassemble then for to pray / And Ihesu christ ascended that hour in to heuene
/ And for thise honors praise we our lord at all ours / At euensonge time
Ih^u christ made the sacrement of his body and of his blood to gydre / he
weesshe the feet of his appostles / and disciples / he was taken down of the
cross and born to the sepulcre / he manyfested and showed him self unto his
disciples in habyte of a pilgrim / And for thyes things the church gives
thankynges to god at this hour / At complyn Ih^u Crist swette water and blood
/ his monument was delyuerd to be kept / and there he rested / And wha^ he was
risen / he showed him self peace to his appostle^ / And of these things give we
louynges and thanks to god / And hereof says saint bernard / hoew w owe to
render and give thankynges to god / My brethern says he / wha^ ye sacrefise to
god with praysynges and thankynges / Join your mind to your words and thy
talente to thy wit / and gladness to thy talente / and demeurte to thy gladness
/ And humylyte to thy demeurte And to humylyte fre will / Fyfthly the church
is hallowed / for tadmynystre there the sacraments of the church / like as on
the table of god in which the sacraments ben comunyed and admynystred and
sum sacramentis ben admynystred and given to them that enter / as baptesme /
And sum be given to them that issue out / as is the last unction or enelyng /
And sum be given to thabyders and dwellars / as is order / And sum fight
and fall / to them is given penance / Sum other contraryen / and to them is
given hardynesse of courage for tenforce them / and that is by confirmacion /
And to other is gy / uen mete for to sustain them / And this is for to receive
the sacred body of Ihesu christ / And sometime is taken away the lettyng that
they fall not in to sin / and that is b^ conionction of marriage Secondly it
is to wit how she is hallowed / and it ought first be known of thaulter and
after of the church / And many things apparteyne to the halowyng of the
altar / And first ben made on the four corners of the altar / four crosses
of holy water / and enuyroned about vij times / and vij time aroused and
besprenct with tholy water styck or spryncle / After thencence is brent on the
altar / And after it is enoynted with crysme / And then it is couerd with
black cloth / and this represents them that goon to the aultre For they ought
first to have charity in iiij manners / that is that they love god and them self
/ their friends / and their enemies / And this signefyeth the iiij crosces on
the iiij corners of the altar / and of thise iiij corners is said in genesis
the xxviij chapitre / Thou shall stratche to thoryent / to thoccident / to the
north / and to ^he south / Or the iiij crosses ben made in the iiij corners ben
signefyed that Ih^u christ saved by the cross the iiij parties of the world /
Or for this that they signefye that we ought to bear the cross of Ihesu christ
in iiij manners / that is in the heart by thought in the mouth by confession in
the body by mortifycacion / And in the vysage by contynuel impression /
Secondly to have cure and owe to wake / and this signefyeth by thenuyronnyng or
going about the aultre / For they sing then / the waytes of the cite have
found me / For they ought have cure and watch upon them that been to them
commysed / And for this cause puts gylbert the necglygence of prelates
emonge the thyngys dysordynate / this foul thing and much perilous that is
to wit a blind archyer / and haltyng messager / a prelate neclygent / a
doctor not connyng / and a dombe crier / thise ben a peryllous felausship / Or
by the seu^n goynges about / of the altar / ben signefyed seven
consideracions that we ought to have unto the seven virtues of the humylyte of
Ihesu christ / And to goo often about them The first virtue is / that he that
was rich be made pour / The second that he was put in the rack or the in
crybbe The third that he was subgette to his parents / The fourth that he
enclyned his heed under the power of his servant / The fyfthe that he
sustained the disciple thief and traytre / The sixthe / that tofore a fellonous
Iug^ he held his pees and spack not / The seventh that he prayed pytously for
them that crucyfyed him /

Thyrdly they ought to have mind of the passion of Ihesu christ / and that is
signefyeed by the spryngyng and castyng of the water / which signefyed seven
effusions of the blood of Ihesu crist The first was in the circomsicion / The
second was in the oryson / The third when he was beten at pyler / The
fourth when he was crowned with thorns / The fyfth in percyng his hondes The
sixthe in naylyng his feet / And the seventh in openyng of his side / And these
arousemens or spryngyng of blood / were made with the spryncle of humylyte and
of charity without estimacion / And the altar is enuyronned vij times for to
signyfye that the vij yeftes of the holy ghoost ben give in the baptesme / Or
by the vij goynges about ben signefied the vij comynges of Ih^u christ The j
was fro heaven in to the belly of his mother / The ij fro the belly unto the crybbe
/ The third fro the crybbe in to the world / The fourth fro the world unto the
galous of the cross / The fyfte fro the cross unto the sepulcre / The sixth
fro the sepulcre to hell / The seventh fro hell / when he aroos and ascended
unto heaven / Fourthly they should have ardant prayer amorous and devoute / And
this is signefyed by the encence which is brent upon the altar / And then
it has virtue / tascende by the lightness of the fume / and to comfort by his
qualite / and to conioyne by the gum / and to conferme by that it is
aromatous or well smellyng / And all in like wise i^ the orison or prayer /
which ascends to the mind of god / It conforteth the soul as to the sin
passed in axyng medecyne / It estrayneth as to that which is to come for to be
ware thereof / It confermeth / as to that is present in getyng defense and
keeping / or it may be said that devout orison is signefyed by thencence / that
it apparteyneth that it ascend to god And hereof says ecclesiastes Oryson of
humylite gives to god sweet savor when it yssueth out of an heart enflammed /
And thappostle says much encence is given to him / Fyftly they ought to have
resple^dour or bryghtnes of conscience / and the odor of good renommee / And
this is signefyed by the crysme or cream / they ought to have a pure
conscience / so that they might say with thappostle / Our glory is the wytnes
of our conscience / and also is good renommee / whereof thappostle to timothee /
it behooves that he have good wytnes / of them that been out / And crysostome
says that the clerks ought not to have no fyl^he / ne in word / ne in deed /
ne in thought / ne in opinion / For they ben the virtue and beauty of the
church / And if they be evil / they make foul all the church / Syxthly /
they ought to have clennes of good work / which / is signefyed by the white
clothes and clean of which the altar is couerd / Thusage of couerture and of
vestements were found for to couere / For to chauffe and keep warm / and for
to array ordynatly / And the good werkis coueren the nakydnes of the soul /
whereof thappostle says / clothe the with white vesture / that the conffusio^
of thy nakedness appear not they array the soul with honest / whereof
thappostle says to the Romans / Clothe you with vestymentes of light they
enchauffe and enflamme us in charity / wlerof it is said / Be not thy
vestementes hoote / For it avails lytil to him that gooth to the altar / if
he have souerayn dygnyte / and a life defamed / it should be an horrible thing
to see him in an hye sete / and a low life / souerayn degree and low estate / A
sad visage and light in werkis full of words / and nothing of deed / Noble of
auctoryte and fleyng courage / Secondly it ought to be seen how the church is
sacred and hallowed / And to that apparteynen many thingis / For the bishop
gooth all about three times / And at every time that he comes to the gate / or
door / he knocks with his croys saying / Princes opene your yates / And the
church is wasshen within and without / with holy water And a cross of asshen
is made on the pauement / and of sonde a trauers / the Angle fro thorient unto
that Which is against thoccydent / And the A. B. C. is wreton within of lettres
of greek and of latin / Crosses ben made on the wallis of the church / and
they be enoynted with creme / And it is to wete / that the three first goynges
about signefye three goynges about / that Ihesu christ made for the halowyng of
this church / The first was when he came fro heaven in to the world / the
second was when he descended fro the world in to hell The third was when he
came again fro hell and ascended in to heaven / Or the three gooyng^s about /
show that the church / is hallowed in thonoure of the trynyte / or for to
signefye the three estates of them that been to be saved of the church / That been virgynes continentis / and married folk / which be signefyeed in the
disposicio^ of the church materyall / like as hugo de sancto victore shows /
For he says that the sanctuarye signefieth the order of virgyns / the chore or
quyer signefieth the continentes / And the body sygnefyeth thordre of them that been married For the sayntuarye is strayter than the chore or quyer / and the
quyer strayter than the body For thordre of vrgyns is more worthy than the
contyne^tes / and thordre of the contyne^tys is more worthy than they that be
maryeed / The second knockyng at door signefieth the treble right that Ihesu
christ has in the church / wherefore it ought to be opened to him / For it is
his by creacion and sweet by redemption / and by promise of gloryfyeng / And
of this three fold right says Anselme / Certainly lord for somoche as thou
have made me I owe my self al to the / by cause thou redemyst me / I owe my
self al to the / by cause thou have promised to me so great thyngis I owe my
self un to thy love / and by cause thou art gretter than I / for who^ thou
gave thy self / and to whom thou promysest thy self / I owe to the more tha^
my self / And this that the bishop cries thryes / opene your yates etc^
sygnefyeth the treble power that he has in heaven / in the world / and in hell
/ And this that the church is thryes wasshen within and without / sygnefyeth
three causes The first is for to put out the devil / And therefore is said in
the blessyng of the water / that it be blessed to chase away all the power of
thenemye the fend with his angellis cursed and shrewd And thou ought to
know that this holy water is made of four things / that is of water / of salt
/ of wine / and of ashes / which things put out the devil / and chacheth
him away / By the water is signefyed theffusion of teeres / by the wyn is
signefyed spyrituel gladness / and by the salt is showed mewre distrecion / And
by thasshes is parfonde humylyte / Secondly it is dedicate for to make her self
clean from all erthly things / which were corrupt by sin / And therefore by
cause it should be clean from all ordure / it is wasshen with holy water / so
that it be clean and pure And this was signefyed in tholde law that all should
be cleansed by water / Thirdly it is hallowed for to take away all malediction /
For therthe at beginning was cursyd with his fruit / by cause man Was
deceived by fruit / and and the water was not cursed / And therefore it is said
that our lord ete fysshe / but it is not fonden that ever he ete any flesh by
name / sauf the p^ske lamb / And that was in ensample for taccomplysshe the
commandment of the law / And by cause that all malediction and cursings
should be take away / is the church wasshen with holy water / Fourthly the
A.B.C. is wreton in the pauement in latin and in greek / and this signefyeth
the comunion of that one and of that other / people / Or it sygnefyeth that one
and that other testament / or thartycles of our faith / For thescripture of the
lettres greeks and latin / that were made on the table of the cross /
represents thassemble of the faith made by Ih^u crist on the cross / and
therefore is this cross leyde and made trauers fro tha^gle of thoryent unto
thangle of thoccident for to signefye that it that was first on the right side
/ was made the lift side / and that which was at heed was made at end /
and thus to the contrary / And it represents the scripture of that one and
that other testament / which was accomplisshid by Ih^u crist / on the cross /
For he said wha^ he deyde / all is accomplisshid And the cross is made
trauerse / by cause that ye one was changed in to that other For all the law
is in a roll / Thirdly the crosses ben painted in the church / and that is
for three causes / The first is to fere the devil / For when they see the sign
of the cross there / by which they have been put out / they ben aferde / and
dar not enter / For they doubt and dread much the sign of the cross / And
hereof says Crysostome / In what place they shall see the sign of the cross /
they shall flee / For they dread the staf of which they have be^ hurt /
Thirdly it represents the artycles o^ the faith / For the pauement of the
church is the fondement of our faith the lettres that been within wreton ben
tharticles / of our faith / by the which the rude people and new ben
introduced And they of the one and other people which ought repute them for
ashes and for pouldre / after this that abraham says in genesis / I shall
speak to my lord / as that I were asshees / and pouldre / Secondly for to show
the sign of the victory of Ih^u crist / For thise crosses ben signs and
baners of Ih^u crist and of his victory / and therefore ben there painted the
crosses for to show that the place is dyuyne subgette to god / And also it is
of custom to emperors / and to other princes that When a town or cite is
taken or yolde^ / for to set up within the baners and thensignemens of the
lords / to signefye that it is subgette to them / Thyrdly for to represente
thappostles it is used for to set up xij lyghtes tofore the cross / for to
represente the xij Apostles / which by the faith of god crucefyed / they
enlumyned all the world / And enoynted with creme / in baptesme / For oylle
signefieth clennesse of conscience / and bame signefyeth thodour of good life /
And it is to know that the church or the temple was as it is said assallyed
by three persons / By Ieroboas / by nabuzarde and by Anthiocus / For as it is
read in the book of kings / Ieroboas did do make two calves gylte / And did
do set that one in Iudee / and that other in beleth / which is said the hows
of god / And this did he by couetyse / And therefore it is signefyed that the
couetyse of clerks makes much foul the house of god / the which auaryce
regneth much in them / whereof saint Iherome says / that fro the least unto
the grettest they follow all auaryce / And saint bernard says the same / whom
will thou give me of thise preuostes that entende not more to empte the purse
of his subgettis / than to take away from them their sins / The calves ben
their neuewis and their sons / which they set in bethel the house of god /
And the church is assaylled by Ieroboas after this that is said / The church
is assaylled when it is edefyed and bylded of thauaryce of thusurers / and of
theuys / whereof is red that an vsurier had founded a church / And then he
prayed the bishop for to dedye and halowe it / And as the bishop and his
clerks made thoffyce of the dedicacio^ he saw the devil which was in a
chayer by the altar in thabyte of a bishop / And said to the bishop / Why
halowest thou my church / cesse ye / For the right thereof aparteyneth to me /
by cause it is made of usure / and of ravayne / And then the bishop and his
clerks were sore aferd and fled And anon the devil destroyed the church
with great storm and great noise Nabuzardan as is red in the xxv chapitre of
the book of kings / that he burnt the house of god for he was prince of the
cokes / and signefyeth them that serve to glotonnye and to luxurye / and make
of their belly their god / And after this that thappostle says / that their
belly is their god / And hughe of saint vyctor shows how their belly is their
god and says / Men were wont to make temples to the gods / and dress
aultres / ordeyne mynystres / for to serve them / to sacrefyse beestes / and to
brenne encence / But now the belly and the kechyne is the temple / the table is
the altar / the cokes ben mynystres / the beestes sacrefyed ben the flessh
soden and roasted / thencence is thodour of the savor /

The king Anthiocus was the most proud man and the most covetous / and
assaylled the church of god as it is red in the makabews / And by him ben
signefyed pride and couetyse / which coueyte not to prouffyte / but to serve /
And they defowle much the church of god / Of which couetyse and pride /
saint bernard says / They goon worshipfully of the goods of our lord / And
yet they give him no worship / they goon every day as goliardes in habyte
shynyng and ryall apparayll / they bear gold on their brydles / on their sadles
/ and on their spores / their harnoys shine more than the aulters / And thus as
the hows of god was dishonored by thies three / right so was it dedycate by
other three / And moses made the first dedicacion / And solomon the second /
and the third Judas machabeus By the which is signefyed that we ought to have
in the dedicacion of the church / the humilite that was in moses / the
wysedom and discrecion that was in solomon / and the very confession of faith
that was in Judas machabeus / And after it apperteyneth to see of the
dedicacion of the temple spirituel / which temple we be / that is to wit
thassemble of good christian men / And this temple is made of living stones / as
saint peter says late us edeffye whiles the stones ben quyck / it is said of
stones polysshed / whereof is songen / the Ioyntures ben made of polysshyd
stones / it is made of square stones four cornerd / yt is to say of spu^tuel
stones that have iiij squares / that is to wit faith / hope charity and good
work which be^ all egall / as saint gregory says / as long as thou byleuest
/ thou have hope / and love as much as thou bileuest / and hopest / and
love to work in them / In this temple the altar is the heart / And upon
this altar three things ought to be offered to god / the first thing is the
fire of love perdurable / like as thappostle says / the fire of dilection shall
be perdurable / and shall never faylle at thaulter of the heart / The second
thing is thencence / of oryson and prayer well smellyng / as it is said in
paralipomenon / Aaron and phynees burnt encence upon thaulter of sacrefyses /
that is to seye where were burnt the things precious and well smellyng / The
third thing is sacrefise of ryghtwysnesse / and this is thoffryng of penance
/ in sac^^fyse of parfyght love / and in calves of ^ortefyeng of the flesh /
and hereof sait david Thou shall accept the sacrefyse of rightwysnesse
thoblacions and holoca^stes / This temple spyrituell that we ben / is of god in
the manner as the temple materyel / For first the souerayn bishop / wha^ he
fyndeth the door of the heart shytte / he gooth about three times / when he
brings to our mind / the sin of the mouth / of the heart / and of the
work / And of this treble going about says he / as to the first / I have
goon about the cite / that is to wete of the heart / And to the second says
ysaye / take thy harp / And as to the third / the comy^ woman is forgoten /
Secondly he smyteth three times the door of the heart which is closed to the end
that it should be opened to him / And he smyteth by the stroke of benefyce / of
counseyl / and of playeng / Of this ^^^ble stroke / it is said in the prouerbis
/ I have strratched out mine hand etc^ / as to the evil / and as to the
benefices given / he says / thou despysest all my counseyll / And as to
counseyll espyred / thou despysest my cou^seyllis / And to the blamyng / that
is for the plays to the given / or this treble going about / is done when he
meued us to reasonable knowleche of sin / and to sorrow for them / and tauenge
and blame our self for sin / Thirdly he arouseth or watreth the temple
spyrituel iij times with water / and so often it ought to be watered or
bespreynct / And this wateryng signefyeth three manners of shedyng of teres / For
as saint gregoore says / the thought of an holy man should be confused in
sorrow / in co^sideryng / where he was / where he shall be And were he is / or
he was said in sin / or he shall be in Judgment / or he is in maleurte / And
there as where is no Joy / when he shedeth then his teres of the heart
consyderyng that he was in sin / and shall be in Judgment for to give a
rekenyng for sin / Then is this temple watered ones of water And when he is
contryte to weep for his unhappiness / and maleurte Where he is / the temple is
watered the second time / And when he wepeth for the Joy where he is not / he
arouseth or watreth the temple / the third time / And thou ought to know /
that wine / salt / and ashes ben meddled with this water / For with the other
sacramentis we ought to have wyn of spyritue^ gladness / Salt of ripe wysedom /
or wyn with water is understand the humylyte of Ihesu christ / that he had in
taking flessh humayne / the w^ne With water is the word humayne And by the salt
is vnderstonden the holiness of his life / which is savior to all of his
religyon By thasshis is vnderstoden his passion / And of these three things we
ought to water our heart / the which ben the blessyngis of his incarnacion by
which we ben called to humylite / thensample of his conversation by the which
we ben informed to holiness / and the mysterye of his passion / by the which we
ben moeued to charity / Fourthly in this temple of the heart spyrituel is
wreton the A.B. C. Or the scripture spyrituel and this scripture is treble /
That is to wit the euyllis of thyngis / the wytnessis of dyuyne benefetes /
and thaccusac^on of his propre trespaces / And of these three things says
thappostle to the Romans / The people that have law do naturelly the things
that been of the law / They that have no law / make law to them self They
that show the work of the law wreto^ in their heart / that is the first /
The wytnes of their conscience is the second / and he that thinks taccuse
him self is the third / Fyftly the cross ought to be painted in this church /
that is to understand that it ought to have the sharpnesses of penance / And
these sharpenesses ought to be enoynted / and have light of the fire For they
be not only to be suffered in patience / but with good will and by charity And
hereof says saint bernard / he that is thretened and menaced with the dread of
Ihesu Christ / he bears the cross in patience / he that prouffyteth in hope /
berith it gladly and with good will / but he that is parfyght in charity /
enbraceth it ardantly / and much people see our crosses / that see not our
enoyntyngis / And he that shall have all thise thyngis in him shall be the
temple of god / to his honor and shall be plainly worthy / that god enhabite
and dwell in him by grace / so that he may dwell in god by glory / the
which he give us that lives and regneth god in heaven world without end / Amen

Thus ends the feste of dedicacion of the church / Here folowen the stories
of the bible /
The sunday of Septuagesme be gynneth the storye of the bible / In which is
read the legende and storye of Adam which follows /
IN the beginning god made and created heaven and earth / The earth was idle and
void and couerd with derknes And the spyrite of god was born on the watres /
And god said / Be made light / And anon light was made / And god saw that
light was good / And dyuyded the light fro derknes / and called the light day /
and derknes night And thus was made light with heaven and earth first / and even
and morning was made one day / The second day he made the firmamente / and
dyuyded the watres that were under the firmament fro them that were above / And
called the firmament heaven / The third day were made on the earth herbs and
fruytes in their kind / The fourth day god made the son and moan / and
sterres etc^ / The fyfth day he made the fisshes in the water / and birds in
thayer The sixthe day god made the beestis on the earth eueryche in his kind
and gendre / And god saw that all these works were good and said / Faciamus
hominem etc^ / Make we man unto our similitude and image / here spack the fader
to the sone and holy ghooste / or ellis as it were the comune voys of three
persons / when it was said make we / and to our / in plurel nombre / Man was
made to the image of god in his soul here is to be noted that he made not only
the soul without the body / but he made both body and soul / as to the body /
he made Male and female / God gaf to man the lordship and power upon all
living beestis / when god had made man it is not wreton Et vidit quod ess bonu^
quia in proximo sciebat eum lapsurum / For yet he was not parfyght til the
woman was made / And therefore it is red it is not good / the man to be allone /
Thus in six days was heaven and earth made and all the ornacion of them / And
then he made the vij day in which he rested / not for that he was weary / but
cessyd of his operacion / and showed the vij day which he blessed / Thus ben
shortly showed the generacions of heaven and earth / For here ben determynat the
werkis of the vj days / And the seventh day he sanctefyed and made holy / God
had planted in the beginning paradyse a place of desire and delyces / And man
was made in yt field of damask / he was made of the slyme of the earth /
Paradyse was made the third day of creacion and was bysette With herbs
plants / and trees / And is a place of most myrthe And Joy / In the mids
whereof ben set two trees / that is the tree of life / And that other the tree
of knowing good and evil / And there is a well which casts out water for to
watre the treeis and herbs of paradys / This well is the mother of all watres
/ which well is divided in to iiij parties / One part is called phison /
This goes about ynde / The second is called gyon otherwise called Nilus / and
that renneth about Ethiope / The other two ben called tigris and Eufrates /
-Tigris renneth toward assiryens / And eufrates is called fruytful which
renneth in Chaldee Thise iiij flodes comen and spryngen out of the same well /
and depart / and yet in sum place / sum of them mete again Then god took
man from the place of his creacion and brought him in to paradys for to work
there / not to labor nedely / but in delytyng and recreacyng him / and that
he should keep paradys / For like as paradys should refresshe him / so should he
labor to serve god / And there god gaf him a commandment / Every commandment
stands in two thyngis in doing or forbedyng / In doing he commanded him to ete
of all the trees of paradys / In forbedyng / he commanded that he should not ete
of the tree of the knowleche of good and evil This commandment was given to
the man And by the man it went to the woman For when the woman was made it was
commanded to them both / And herto he setted a pain / Saying what someuer day
thou etest thereof / thou shall dye by death / God said / it is not good a man to
be allone / Make we to him an helper like to him self for to bring forth
children / Adam supposed that sum helpar to him had been among the beestis
which had been like to him / Therefore god brought to Adam all living beestis
of the earth and air / In whicle ben understand the^ of the water also /
which with one commandment all came to fore him / they were brought for two
causes / One was by cause man should give to each of them a name / by which
they should know that he should domyne over them / And the second cause was by
cause ada^ should know that there was none of the^ like to him / And he named
hem in he brews tongue / which was only the langage and none other at
beginning / And so none being found like unto him / god sent in Adam a lust
to sleep / which was no dreme / but as is supposed in a extasi or in a traunse
in which was showed to him the celestial court / wherefore when he awoke he
prophesied of the conjunction of crist to his church / And of the flode that
was to come / And of the dome and destruction of the world / by fire he knew /
which afterward he told to his children Whiles that adam slepte god took (...)
of his Ribs / both flesh and bone / and made that a woman And set her to
fore Adam / which then said / this is is now a bone of my bones and flessh
of my flessh / And Adam gaf here a name like as her lord / and said she shall be
called virago / which is as much to say / as made of a man / And is a name
taken of aman / And anon the name gyuyng he prophesied saying by cause she is
taken of the side of aman / therefore a man shall forsake and leave fader and
mother and abide and be adherent unto his wif / and they shall be two in one
flesh / And thaugh they be two person yet in matrymony and wedlok they be
but one flesh / and in other thyngis tweyne / for why neither of them has
power of his own flessle / They were both naked and were not asshamed / they
felt nothing of meuyng of their flessh / ne to refrain them as we now do /
For they stood both in the state of Innocensye / Then the serpente which
was hotter than any best of therthe / and naturelly deceyuable for he was full
of the devil / lucifer which was deiecte and cast out of heaven / had great
envy to man that was bodyly in paradys / and knew well if he might make him to
trespace and break gods commandment / that he should be cast out also / yet he
was aferd to be taken or espied of the man / he went to the woman not so
prudent / and and more prone to slide and bow / and in the form of the
serpente / for then the serpente was erecte as a man / Bid says that he
chase a serpente having a maidens chere / For like often aplye to like / and
spoke by the tongue of the serpente to Eve and said / why commanded you god that
ye should not ete of all the trees of paradys / this he said to find occasyon
to say that he was come fore / Then the woman answerde and said / Ne forte
moriamur / lest happily we dye which she said doubtyng / For lightly she was
flexible to every part / where unto anon he answered / Nay in no wise ye shall
dye / but god would not that ye should be like him in science / and knowing /
that when ye ete of this tree / ye shall be as gods / knowing good and evil /
he as enuyous forbade you / And anon the woman elate in pride willing be like
to god accorded thereto / And byleuyd him / The woman saw that the tree was
fair to look on and clean and sweet of savor / took and ete thereof / And gaf
unto Adam of the same happyly desiryng him by fair words / but Adam anon
agreed / for when he saw the woman not deed / he supposed that god has said
that they should dye to fere hem with / And then ete of the fruit forboden /
And anon their sight was opened that they saw their nakydnes / And then anon
they understood that they had trespaced / For anon their flesh began to meue
and stire to concupiscence / for to fore that they had eten of the forboden
fruit / tho meuynges were repressed and closed as in young children And then
after they had sinned they were opend like spryngys of water and began to meue
/ and then they were expert and knew them / And like as they were inobedyent
to their superyor right so their members began to meue against their superior /
which is reason / and they felt their first meuyng in their preuy members /
and thereof they were asshamed / And thus they knew then that they were naked /
And they took fig leuis and sewed them to gyder for to couere their members
in manner of brechis / And anon after they herd the voys of our lord god
walkyng / and anon they hyd them / Our lord called the man and said / Adam
where art thou / calling him in blamyng him and not / as not knowing where he
was / but as who said Adam see in what myserye thou art / which answered / I
have hid me lord for I am naked / our lord said who told the that thou were
naked / but that thou have eten of the tree forboden / he then not mekely
confessyng his trespass / but leyde the fawte in his wife and in him as gyuer of
the woman to him and said The woman whom thou gauyst to me / as a felawe gaf
to me of the tree / and I ete thereof / And then our lord soid to the woman /
why dydyst thou so / Neither she accused her self / but leyd the sin on the
serpente / and pryuely she leyd the fault in the maker of him / The serpente
was not demanded For he did it not of him self but the devil by him / And our
lord cursyng the^ began at the serpente keeping an order and congrue nombre of
curses The serpente was the first and sinned most / for he sinned in iij
thyngis / The woman next and sinned less than he / but more than the man / for
she sinned in two thyngis The man sinned last / and leest / for he sinned but
in one / The serpente had envy / he lied / and deceived / For these three he
had three curses / by cause he had envy at thexcellence of man / it was said to
him / thou shall goo and crepe on thy breast / by cause he lied / he is
punysshid in his mouth / when it was said thou shall ete earth all the days
of thy life / Also he took away his voys and put venym in his mouth / And by
cause he deceived it was said / I shall put enemyte bytweyne the and woman / and
thy seed and her seed / She shall break thy heed etc^ / In two thyngis the
woman sinned / In pride / and etyng the fruit / by cause she synnyd in pride /
he meked her seyeng / Thou shall be under the power of man / And I shall have
lordship over the and I shall put the to affliction / Now is she subject to a
man by condition and dread / which to fore was but subject by love / And by
cause she sinned in the fruit / she is punysshed in her fruit when it was said
to her / thou shall bring forth children in sorrow / In the pain of sorrow
stands the curs but in bryngyng forth of children is a blessyng / And so in
punysshyng god forgate not to have mercy / which is to be noted etc^ / And by
cause adam sinned but only in etyng of the fruit / therefore he was punysshed in
sechyng his mete / as it is said to him / Acursed be the earth in thy work /
that is to say for thy work of thy sin / for which is made / that the
earth that brought forth good and holsom fruytes plentyuously / fro hens forth
shall bring forth but seld / and also none without man's labor / and also
sometime wedes breres and thorns shall grow / And he added thereto / thou shalst
ete herbs of the earth / as woe says thou / shall be like a beeste or Iumente
/ he cursyd the earth / by cause the trespaas was of the fruit of the earth and
not of the water / he added thereto to him of labor / In the sweet of thy chere
thou shall ete thy bread unto the time thou return again in to therthe that ie
to say til thou dye / for thou art earth / And in to earth thou shall goo again
/ Then Adam wayllyng and sorowyng the myserye that was to come of his
posteryte / named his wife Eve / which is to say mother of all living folk /
Then god made to adam and eve two letheren cotes / of the skynnes of deed
bestes / to therde that they bear with them the sign of mortalite / And said
loo Adam is made as one of us knowing good and evil / Now lest he put his
hand and take of the tree of life and live ever / As who says beware and cast
him out lest he take and ete of the tree of life / And so he was cast out of
paradys and set in the field of damask where as he was made and taken fro /
for to work and labor there / And our lord set Cherubin to keep paradys of
delight with a brennyng sword and plyaunt / to the end that none should enter
there ne come to the tree of life / After then that Adam was cast out of
paradys and set in the world he knew his wife and engendryd Cayn / the xv
year after he was made and his suster Calmana / They came out of-paradys
virgynes / as Methodius says / And when adam was made / he was made a parfyght
man as a man of xxx year of age / when he was but one day old / and he might
well have gotten many children to fore Cayn / but After other xv year was abel
born And his sister delbora / when Adam was an Cxxx year of age Cayn slew abel
his brother / Truth it is after many days Cayn and Abel offrid sacrefyse and
yeftes / unto god / it is to be byleuyd that Adam taught his sons to offer to
god their tithes and first fruytes / Cayn offrid fruytes / for he was a
ploughman and teliar of earth / And Abel offrid milk and the first of the
lambs / Moses says of the fattest of the flock / And god beheld the
yeeftes / of Abel For he and his sacrefyses were acceptable to our lord / And
as to Cayn and his sacrefyses god beheld hem not / for they were not to him
acceptable / he offryd wethes and thorns / And as sum doctors say fire came
from heaven and lyghted the sacrefyse of Abel / and the yeftes of Cayn plesed
not our lord For the sacrefyse would not belight ne brenne clear in the light of
god / Whereof Cayn had great envye un to his brother Abel / Wiche roose against
him and slew him / And our lord said to him / where is Abel thy brother / he
answered and said / I wot never / Am I kepar of my brother / Then our lord
said / what have thou do the voys of the blood of thy brother cries to me fro
therthe / wherefore thou art cursyd / and acursyd be therthe that received the
blood of thy brother / by his mouth / of thyn hondes / when thou shall work and
labor therthe it shall bring forth no fruit / but thou shall be fugytyf
vacabunde and void / on therthe / This Cayn deseruyd well to be cursyd /
knowing the pain of the first trespaas of Adam / Yet he added thereto murdre
and slaughter of his brother / Then Cayn dredyng that beestis should devour
him / or if he went forth he should be slain of the men / or if he dwelled with
hem / they would sle him for his sin / dampened him self and in despayer said /
My wickedness is more / than I can deserve to have foryefnes / who so find me
/ shall sle me / this he said of dread or ellis wesshyng as who said / would god
he would slay me / Then our lord said / Nay not so / thou shall dye but not
fone / For who someuer sleeth Cayn shall be punysshed vij sythes more / For he
should delyure him fro dread / fro labor / and myserye / and added that he
should be punysshed / personaly / vij fold more / This punicion shall endure to
him in pain unto the seventh lameth / Who someuer shall sle Cayn shall loose vij
vengeancis / Some hold that his pain endured unto the vij generation / For he
comysed vij sins he departed not truly / he had envye to his brother / he
wrought gylefully / he slew his brother fasely he denied it / he despayred And
dampened he did no penance / And after he went in to the eest fugytyf and
vacabunde / Cayn knew his wife which bare Enoch / and he made a cite / and
named it Enoch after the name of his sone / Enoch / here it shows well that
this time were Many men / thaugh their generation be not said / whom Cayn
called to his cite by whose help he made it / whom he enduced to theft / and
roroberye / he was the first that walled or made cytees / dredyng them that he
hurted for seurete / brought his people in to the towns / Then Enoch gate
Irath And Irath Manahel / and he gate Matusale / and Matusale / Lameth / which
was the seventh fro Adam and werst / For he brought in first bygamye / And by
him Was comysid first aduoultrye against the law of god and of nature / and
again the decree of god / This lameth took two wives ada and sella / of Ada he
gate Iabel which fond first the craft to make foldes for shepherdes / and to
change their pasture / and ordained floekes of sheep and departed the sheep
fro the gheet after the qualite the lambs by them self / and the older by them
self / And understood the fedyng of hem after the sceason of the year / the
name of his brother was Iubal / fader of syngers in the harp and organes / not
of thynstrumentis / for they were found long after / but he was the fyndar of
musyke / that is to say of co^sonantes of acorde such as shepherdes use in
their delyces / and sportes / And for as much as he herd Adam prophecye of
two Iugementis by the fire and water that all thing should be destroyed thereby /
and that his craft new found should not perisshe / he did do write it in
two pilers or colompnes / one of Marble and another of claye / of therthe to
the end that one should endure against the water / and that other against the fire
/ Josephus says that the piler of marble is yet in the land of siriac / Of
Sella he begat Tubalcam / which fond first the craft of smytherye and
werkyng of iron and made things for war and sculptures and grauynges in
metal to the playsir of the eyes / which he so werkyng / In bal to fore said
had delight in the sown of his hamers / of which he made the consonantes / and
tunes of acorde in his song / Noema suster of tubalcam fond first the craft
of diverse texture / Lameth was a shoter / and used to shote at wild beestis /
For none use of the mete of them but only for to have the skynnes for their
clothyng / And lyuyd so long that he was blind / and had a child to lead him
and on a time by adventure / he slew Cayn / For Cayn was always aferde and hid
him among busshes / and breres / and the child that lad lameth had supposed it
had been some wild be and directed lameth to shote there at / and so wenyng to
shote at a be / slew Cayn / And when he knew that he had slain Cayn he
with his bow slew the child / and thus he slew them both / to his
dampnacion / therefore as the sin of Cayn was punysshyd vij sythes / so was the
sin of lameth seventy sythes and vij / that is to say lxxvij sowles that came
of lameth were perysshyd in the deluuye and noes flode also his wif did him
much sorrow / and evil entreted him / And he being wroth said that he suffered
that for his double homycide and manslaughter / yet never theles he fered him
by pain saye^g / why will ye sle me / he shall be more and sorer punysshed that
sleeth me / than he that slew Cayn / After that abel was slain strabus says
that Ada^ auowed no more to have to do with his wif / but by an angel he brake
the vow / by cause a sone should be born to god / yet nevertheless Josephus said
that wha^ abel was slain And Cayn fled away Adam thought of procreacion of
children / And so wha^ he was Cxxx year old he engendrid seth like to his
simylitude / and he to the image of god / This seth was a good man / and he
gate Enos and Enos Caynam / And Cynam begat Malael / and Malael Iareth / And
Iareth Enoch / and Enoch Matussale / And matussale Lamech / And Lamech Noe /
And like as in the generation of Cayn the seventh was the werst / so in the
generation of Seth the seventh was the best / yt was Enoch whom god took and
brought him in to paradys unto the time that he shall come with hely for to
convert the hertes of the faders in to the sons / And adam lyuyd after that
he had begoten Seth viijC year and engendrid sons and doughtres Sum hold
opinyon xxx sons and xxx douhgtres and some.l. of that one / and.l. of that
other / we find no certenyte of the^ in the bible / But all thdayes of ada^
living here in earth amou^ete to the sum of ixCxxx year / And in the end of
his life when he should dye / it is said but of none auctoryte / that he sent
Seth his sone in to paradys for to fetch the oil of mercy / where he receyuyd
certain graynes of the fruit of thtree of mercy by an angel / And when he come
again / he fond his fader adam yet alive and told him what he had don And
then Adam lawhed first / and then deyed / and then he leyd the greynes or
kernellis under his faders tongue and buried him / in the vale of ebron / and
out of his mouth grew three trees of the three graynes / of which the cross
that our lord suffered his passion on / was made by virtue of which he gate
very mercy and was brought out of derknes in to very light of heaven / to the
which he bring us that lyue^h and regneth god world with out end /

Here ends the life of Adam /
Hre begins the hystorye of Noe the first sunday in Sexagesme /
AFter that Adam was deed deyd Eve / and was buried by him At the begynnyg in
the first age the people lyuyd long / Adam lyuyd ixCxxx year / And Matussale
lived ixClxix year / Saint Iherom said that he deyde the same year the flood
was / ^ Then Noe was the tenthe fro adam in the generation of seth / in who^
the first age was ended / The lxx Interpreters say that this first age dured
ijMijCxliiij year / Saint Iherom says not fully ijM and Methodius full ijM
etc^ / Noe then was a man perfight and rightwys and kept gods commandment /
And when he was vC year old he gate Sem Cham and Iafeth This time men began to
multeplye on therthe / and the children of god / that is to say of Seth / as
religious saw the doghters of men that is to say of Cayn / And were overcome
by concupisce^ce / and took them to their wives / This time was somoche sin
on therthe in the sin of lecherye / which was mysused again nature wherefore
god was displesid / and determined in his prescience to destroy man that he
had made and said I shall put man away that I have made And my spirit shall not
abide in man for ever / For he is flessh / as who said I shall not punyssh man
perpetuelly as I do the devil / For man is frayll / And yet er I shall
destroy him / I shall give him space and time of repentance and tamende him if
he will / the time of repentance shall be / Cxx year / Then noe rightwys and
perfyght walked with god / that is in his laws / and the earth was corrupt by
sin and fyllyd / when god saw therthe to be corrupt / and that every man
was corrupt by sin upon therthe / he said to noe / the end of all people is
come to fore me exepte them that shall be sauyd / And the earth is replenesshyd
with their wickedness / I shall destroy them with therthe id e^ with the
fertilite of therthe / Make to the an arcke of tree hewn / polysshyd and
squared / And make there diverse places And by me it with cleye and pitche
within and with out / that is to wete with glewe which is so ferue^te that the
tymbre may not be losed / And thou shall make it iijC Cubytes of length / Fyfty
in bread / and xxx of heyghte / And make therein dyuerce distynctions of places
and chambres / and of warderops / And the Arcke has a door for to enter in and
come out / And a wyndow was made thereon which yt the hebrews say was of
crystal / This Arcke was on making fro the beginning that god commanded first
to make it Cxx year / In which time Noe often desired the people to leave their
sin / And how he had spoken with god and that he was commanded to make the
ship / For god should destroy hem for their sin but if they left it / And
they mocked him and said that he raued and was a fool and gaf no faith to his
saying / and continued in their synnne and wickedness / Then when the Arcke
was parfyghtly maad god bad him to take in to it of all the beestis of therthe
/ and also of the fowls of thayer of each two male and female / that they may
live and also of all the metes of therthe that been comestible / that they may
serve and feed the and them / And Noe did all that our lord commanded him /
Then said our lord to Noe enter thou and all thy household in to the Arc /
that is to say thou and thy wife and thy three sons and their three wiuys I have
seen that thou art rightful in this generation / Of all beestis that been clean
thou shall take seven / and of unclean beestis but only two And of the birds
seven and seven male and female / that they may be saved on the face of therthe
Yet after vij days / I shall rain upon therthe / xl days and xl nyghtis and
shall destroy all the substance that I made on the earth / And Noe did all
thing that our lord coma^ded him / he was vjC year old when the flod began on
the earth / And then Noe entryd in and his sons / his wife and the wives of
his sons / all in to the arc teschewe the watres of the flood / Of all the
beestis and the fowls and of all that meuyd and had life on earth male and
female Noe took in to him as our lord had boden / And seven days after they
were entered the water began tencrete / The wells of the abysmes were broken /
And the cataractes of heaven were opened / that is to say the clouds / and it
rayned on therthe xl days and xl nyghtes / And the arc was eleuate and born
upon the watres on height above the mo^taynes and hills / For the water was
grown hyer xv cubits above all the mo^taynes / that it should purge and wasshe
the fylthe of thayer / Then was consumed all that was on therthe living man
woman and be / and birds / And all that ever bare life / so that nothing
abode upon therthe for the water was xv cubytes oboue the highest montayne of
therthe / And when Noe was entrid / he shitte the door fast without forth and
lymed it with glewe / And so the watres abode eleuate in highte an Cl days fro
the day that Noe entered in / And our lord then remembered Noe and all the^
that were in the arc with him and also on the beestis and fowls / and cessed
the watres / And the wells and catharactes were closid / And the raynes were
prohybyted and forboden to rain no more The vij month the xxvij day of the
month the arc rested on the hills of Armenye The x month the first day of
the month the tops of the hills appiered first / After thise xl days after
the lassyng of the watres / Noe opened the wyndowe / And desired sore to have
tidings of cessyng of the flood And sent out a Raven / for to have tidings /
And when she was goon / returned no more again / For parauentushe fond sum
deed carayne of a be swimming on the water / and lighted thereon to feed her
and was left there / After this he sent out a douue which flewhe out / And
when she could find no place to rest ne set her foot on / she returned unto
Noe And he took her in / yet then were not the tops of the hillis bare /
And vij days after he sent here out again / which at eue^ returned beryng a
branch of an olyue tree burgyng in her mouth / And after other vij days he
sent her again / which came no more again Then in the year of Noe vjC^j the
first day of the month Noe opened the coueryng of the arc and saw that the
earth was dry / but he durst not goo out but abode the commandment of our
lord / The second month the xxvij day of the month / our lord said to Noe /
Goo out of the arc thou and thy wife thy sons and the wives of thy sons / he
commanded them to goo coniunctly out / which disiunctly entered / And late goo
out with the all the beestis and fowls living and all the reptyle euerich
after his kind and gendre / to whom our lord said grow ye and multiplye upon
therthe / Then Noe issued out and his wife and his sons with their wives and
all the beestis the same day a year after they entryd in / euerich after his
gendre / Noe then edefyeed an awter to our lord and took of all the beestis
that were clean and offrid sacrefise unto our lord / And our lord smellyd the
swetenes of the sacrefise / and said to Noe / from hens forth I shall not curse
the earth for man / for he is prone and ready to fall fro the beginning of his
yougthe / I shall no more destroy man by such vengeance And then our lord
blessid hem and said grow ye and multeplye the earth And be ye lords of all
the beestis of therthe of the fowls of thayer and of the fisshes / I have
given all things to you but ete not flessh with the blood / I command you to
slay noman ne to shede nomans blood / I have made man after mine image / who some
ever shedeth his broders blood / his blood shall be shed / Go ye forth and
grow and multeplye and fylle the earth / this said our lord to Noe and his
sons / Lo I have made a covenant with you and with them that shall come after
you / that I shall no more bring such a flood to slay all people / And in token
thereof I have set my rain bow in the clouds of heaven / For who that
trespaceth I shall do Justice otherwise on him / Noe lyuyd after the flood
iijCl year / Fro the time of Adam unto after Noes flood the time And season was
all way grene and tempryd / And all that time men et^ no flesh / For
therbes and fruytes were then of great strength and effect they were pure
and norisshyng / But after the flood the earth was weyker and brought not forth
so good fruit wherefore fflesshe ^as ordained to be eten / And then (...)
began te labor for his lyfelode with his sons / and began to tyllye therthe
destroy breris and thornys / And to plant vignes / And so on a time noe had
drunk so much of the wine that he was drunk / and lay and slepte / And his
prevy me^bree lay bare and open / Cham his myddelest sone espied it / and
lowhe and stornyd his fader and called his brethern to see / which came
hackward for to couure her fader and would not ^^ke on hit / and rebuked cham of
his folly and sin / and when Noe was couured with the mantel / anon he awoke
and when he understood how cham his sone had scorned him / he cursid him / And
also his sone Canaan / And blessed Sem and Iaphet by cause they couerd him /
All the days of Noe were ixC.l. year And then deyed / And after his death
his sons deled all the world between hem Sem had all asye / Cham affryke /
And Iaphet all Europe / Thus was it departed / Asye is the best part / and is
as much as the other two and that is in the eest / Affryke is the south part
and therein is cartage and many rich contre / there in ben blew and black men /
Cham had that to his part Africa / The third part is Europe which is in
the north and weste / therein is greece / Rome and Germanye / In Europe regneth
now most the christian law and faith wherein is many rich Royame And so was the
world departed to the iij sons of Noe /

Thus ends the life of Noe
Here follows the life of abraham /
THe sunday called quiquagesme is read in the church thystorye of the holy
patriarch Abraham which was sone of Their / This Their was the tenthe fro Noe
in the generation of sem / Iaphet had vij sons / and cham four sons / Out of
the generacio^ of cham Nembroth came which was a wicked man and cursid in his
werkis And began to make the tour of babylone which was great and hye / And at
the making of this tour god changed the langages / in such wise that noman
understood other / For tofore the byldyng of that tour was but one manner speech
in all the world / And there were made lxxij speches / The tour was great / it
was x mile about and vMlxxxiiij / steps of height / This Nembroth was the
first man that found mawmetryee and ydolatrye / which endured long and yet
does / Then I torn again to Their which had three sons / which was abram
/ Nacor and Aram / Of nacor came us / bus / and batuel / Of us came Job of bus
came balam / And of batuel rebecca and laban / Of aram came loath and ij doughtres
melcha and sara / Now I shall speak of abram of whom our blessid lady come / he
weddyd Sara daughter of his brother aram / Abram was ever faithful and true /
he was lxv year old when his fader deyde / For whom he morned till our lord
comforted him / which said to abram / Abram make the ready and goo out of thy
land and kynrede and also fro the hows of thy fader / and come in to the land
that I shall show to the / I shall make the grow in to much people / I shall
bless the and shall magnefye thy name and thou shall be blessed and I shall
bless them that bless the and curse them that curse the / And in the shall be
blessed All the kynredes of the earth / Abram was lxx year old when he
departed from the land of Aram / And he took with him Sara his wife and loath the
sone of his brother and their meyne and his catell and substance and Came in to
the land of Canaan and came in to the vale of Sichem / in which were ylle
people which were the people of Canaan / And our lord said to Abram I shall give
to the this land and to thyn eyres / Then Abram did reyse an altar on
which he did sacrefise / And blessid and thankyd our lord / Abram beheld all
the land toward the south / And saw the beawte thereof and fond hit like as
our lord told him / But he had not be long in the land but that there fylle
great hungre therein / wherefore he left that contre and went in to egypt And
took with him Sara his wife / And as they went by the way Abram said to his wif
/ I fere and dread sore that when we come to this people which ben lawles / that
they shall take the for thy beauty / and sle me / by cause they would use the
wherefore say that thou art my suster and I thy brother / And she agreed thereto
/ And when they were comen in to that co^tre / the people saw that she was so
fair anon they told the king / which anon commanded that she should be brought
unto his presence / And when she was come / god of his good grace so pourueyed
for her that noman had power to use any lecherye with her ne to do her vylanye
/ Wherefore the king was ferd that god would have taken vengeance on him for
her / And send for abram / And said to him that he should take his wife / and
that he had evil don to say that she was his suster / And so delyuerd her
again and gaf him gold and silver and bad that men should worship him in all his
land / And he should freely at his playsyr depart with all his goods / Then
after this Abram took his wife Sara and went home again / And came in to Bethel
and set there an altar of stone / And there he adoured and worshipped the
name of god / his store and beestis began to multeplye / And Loath with his
meyne was also there / And their beestis began so sore to encrece and multeplye
that uneath the contre might suffyse to their pasture / in so much that
Rumor and grutchyng began to sourde and rise between the herd men of Abram /
And the herdmen of loath / Then Abram said to Loath / Lo this contee is great
and wide / I pray the to chese on which hand thou will goo and take it for
thy meyne and thy beestis / And late no strif be between me and the / ne
between my herdmen ne thy herdmen / Lo behold all the country is to fore the
take which thou will if thou goo on the right side I shall goo on the lift side
/ And if thou take the lift / I will goo on the right side / Then loath
byhelde the country and saw a fair plain toward flom Jordan / which was
playsau^t and the flode ran toward Sodom and Gomor / which was like a paradys
/ and took that part for him / And Abram took toward the weste / which was
beside the people of Canaan at the foot of Mount mambre / And Loath dwellid in
Sodomys / the people of Sodom were worst of all people / Our lord said to Abram
lift up thyn eyes and see directly fro the place that thou art now in / fro
the north to the south and fro the eest to the weste All this land that thou
see I shall give the and to thy seed for evermore / I shall make thy seed as
pouldre or dust of therthe / who that may nombre the dust of the earth / shall
nombre thy seed / Arise therefore and walk the land in length and in bread
for I shall give it to the / Abram meuyd thnne his tabernacle and dwelled in the
valey of mambre which is in Ebron / and set there his tabernacle / It happed
sone after that there was a werre in that land that four kings warred again
other five kings which were of Sodom Gomor and other / And the iiij kings
ouerthrewe the five and slew them / and spoylled and took all the substance
of the contre / And took also with hem loath and all his good / and a man gate
a way fro them and came to Abram and told him how that loath was taken and lad
away / And then anon Abra^ did do gadre his people to gydre the nombre of
iijCxviij / And folowyd after / and departed his people in to two parties / by
cause they should not escape / And Abram smote in emonge them and slew the
kings and Rescowed Loath and all his goodis and delyuerd the men of Sodom that
were taken and the women / And they of Sodom came again him / and Melchisedech
came and met with him and offrid to him bread and wyn / this melchisedech was
king and priest of Ihrl^m and all the contree / And blessid abram / and there
abram gaf to him the tithes of all that he had / and the king of sodo^ would yt
abra^ should have had such pray as he took / but he would not have as much as
ye lachet of a shoo / and thus gate abra^ much love of all ye people / After
this our lord apperid to abra^ in a vision and said Abra^ dread the nothing I
am thy protector And thy reward and mede shall be great / Abram answered / lord
god what wylt thou give me / thou wotest well / I have no children / and since
I have non I will well that eleazar the sone of my baily be mine heyr / Nay said
our lord he shall not be thyn heir / but he that shall issue and come of thy seed
shall be thyn heyr / our lord led him out and bad him behold the heaven and
nombre the sterres if thou may and said to him / so shall thy ofspryngyng and
seed be / And abram byleuyd it and gaf faith to our lords words and it was
reputed to him to Justice / And our lord said to him I am the lord that ladde
yt out of the land of hur of the chaldeeis for to give to the this land in to
thy possession / and abram said lord how shall I know that I shall possede it A
voys said to abra^ thy seed after the shall be exiled in to egipte by the space
of iiijC year / and shall be there in servitude / and after I shall bring the^
he^her again in the fourth generacio^ thou shall abide here un to thy good age
and shall be buried here and goo with thy faders in pees / sara was yet with out
child she had an handmayd named Agar an egypcian and she on a day said to
abram her housbond / thou seyst I may bear no child / wherefore I would thou took
Agar my maid and lie by her that thou might get a child which I might keep
and hold as for mine / and x year after that Abraham had dwellid in that land
/ he took agar and gate her with child / and anon as she felt her self with
child / she despised her maistresse / then sara said to abra^ thou do evil
I gaf the license to lie with my servant and now sith she is conceived by the
she has me in despyte / god Judge this between the and me / to whom abra^
answered thyn ha^dmaid is in thyn hands chastise her as it pleseth ye / after
this sara chastised agar and put her to so great affliction that she went away
/ and as she went an au^gel met with her in the wilderness by a well / and
said / agar whens come and why there ghost you / She answered I flee away fro
the face of my lady sara / to whom the angele said / Return again and
submytte the by humblenes unto thy lady / and I shall multeplye thy seed / and
so much people shall come of it that it can not by no^bred for multitude / and
he said forthermore / thou haste conceived and shall bear a child and shall
call him ysmael / he shall be a fires man / he shall be again all men / and
all men again him / Then agar returned home and served her lady / and sone
after she was delyueryd of ysmael / Abram was lxxxvj year old when Ismael was
born / when abram was lxxxxix year our lord apperid to him and said / Abram
loo I am the lord almighty walk thou before me and be parfyght / and I shall
keep covenant bitwene me and the / And shall multeplye thy seed greatly / And
abram fill down lowtyng low to therthe and thanked him / Then our lord said
I am and my covenant I shall keep to the / thou shall be fader of much people /
Thou shall no more be called abram / but abraham / For I have ordained the /
fader of much people / I shall make the tencrece most habondantly kings and
princes shall come of the / and shall stablisshe my covenant between me and the
/ and thy seed in thy generacio^s / I shall give to the and to thy seed after
the / the land of thy pylgremage / all the land of canaan in to their
possession / and I shall be their god / yet said god to abraham And thou shall
keep thy covenant to me and thyn heirs after the in their generacions / and
this shall be the covenant that ye shall keep / and thyn heirs after the /
Every man child and male shall le circu^siced in his preuy membre that it be a
toke^ between me and you / Every child masculyn that shall be born / shall be
circu^cysed when he is viij dayee old / And I Will that this sign shall be in
your flesh / And see that the men in your generation be circumcised begin
at thy self and thy children and all that dwell in thy kynred / who of you
that shall not be circumcised in his flesh shall be cast and put out for ever
fro my people by cause he obeys not my statute and ordenau^ce / And thy wife
Saray shall be callid no more Saray / but she shall be called Sa^a / and I shall
bless her / and shall give to ye a sone of her / whom I shall bless also / I
shall him encrece in to nations And kings of peples shall come of him / Abraham
fyl down his face toward therthe and lawhed in his heart saying / may it be
that a woman of lxxxx year may co^ceyue and bear a child / beseech the lord
that Ismael may live to fore the / Our lord said to abraham sara shall bring
forth a sone who^ you shall name ysaa^ and I shall keep my covenant to him for
evermore and to his heirs after him / And I have herd thy request for ysmael
also I shall bless him and encrece and shall multeplye his seed in to much
people / xij dukes shall come of him / I shall keep my covenant to ysaac / whom
Sara shall bring forth the next year / when thise words were fynysshed abraham
took Ismael his sone / and all the men small and great strangers and other
that were in his hows and circumcised the / Ismael was xiij year old when he
was circumcised / and abraham was.99. year wha^ he him self was circumcised /
And thus that same day he and his sone Ismael and all the men in his hows as
well strangers of what degree they were receyuyd this new law of circumcision
whereby they were known from other people / After this on a time as abraham
satte beside his house in ye vale of mambre in the hete of the day / and as he
lift up his eyes / he saw iij yongmen coming to him and anon as he saw thise
iij standing by him / he ran to them and worrshipped one allone / he saw three
/ and worshippid but one / That bytokeneth the tryuyte / and prayed the^ to be
herberowed with him / and took water and wesshe their feet / and prayed hem to
tarry under the tree / and he would bring bread to them for to comfort hem /
And they bad him do as he had said / he went and bad sara to make iij asshy
cakes and sent his child for a te^dre fat calf / which was soden and boylled /
and he seruid hem with butter and mylk / and the calf and set it tofore them
/ he stood by the^ / when they had eten / they demanded him / where is sara thy
wife and he said yonder in ye tabernacle And he said I shall goo and come again
and sara thy wife shall have a child / and she stood byhnde the door and herd it
/ and loughe / And seyde softly to her self how may it be that my lord is so
old and I also that I should bear a child / She thought it imppssible / Then
said our lord to abraham why lawheth sara thy wife / Saying in scorn Shall I
bear a chlid / but as I said to the to fore / I shall return and come again and
she shall have a child in that time / And he axid sara why she smylyd in scorn
/ and she said she smylid ne lawhed not / And our lord said / it is not so /
for thou lawhedest / wha^ they had restid abraham conveyed hem on the way / And
our lord said to abraham / I shall not hyde fro the that I purpose to do The
cry of Sodom and gomor is multeplied and their sin is much grievous / I
shall desce^de and see if the sin be so great the stenche thereof comes to
heaven I shall take vegea^ce and destroy them / Then abraham said / I hope
lord thou will not destroy the Just and rightwis man with the wicked synnar I
beseech the lord to spare the^ / Our lord said if there be fyfty good and
rightwis men among them / I shall spare them / And abraham said good lord if
there be found xl I pray the to spare the^ our lord said if there be xl / I shall
spare them / and so fro xl to xxx / and fro xxx to xx and fro xx to x and our
lord said if there be found x good men among the^ I shall not destroy them / And
then our lord went fro abraham / and he returned home again / That same
euentyde came ij Angels in to sodom / and both sat at his gate / and wha^ he
saw hem he went and worshippid them and prayed the^ to come and rest in his
house and abide there and wesshe your feet / And they said nay we shall abide
here in the street / and loath constrained them and brought hem in to his house
and made a feast to them / But er they should goo to bed ye synful and cursid
people of the town young and old bisette and enuyroned loths house / and called
loath and said where hen the me^ that thou tokest in to thy house this night /
bring them forth that we may know and use the^ / and loath anon shette the
door and stood byhynde and said to them / O ye my brethern I beseech you yt ye
will not do ne co^myse thise wicked sin on them / I have ij doughtres
virgyns which yet never knew man / I shall bring them out to you / and use ye
the^ / but thise men I pray you to spare / they ben entrid under the shadow of
my protection / They said again to him goo forth and fetch them / Thou art
entered among us as a stranger / shall thou rewle and Judge us / we shall put the
to more affliction than them / Loath withstode them myghtily they had al most
broken up the doors but the men set hand to and did help loath and brought
him in and did shette fast the door And smote the^ that were with out with
blyndenes yt they might not see / ne find the door / Then said the angels to
loath / if you have here of thy kynred sons or douchtres all the^ that long to
ye led out of this cite / we shall destroy this place / For the cry thereof is
comen to our lord which has sent us for to destroy them / loath went unto
his kynnesmen and said arise and take your children and goo out of this cite /
For our lord shall destroy it / And they supposed that they had raued or Iaped
/ And as soon as it was day the angels said to loath arise and take thy wif and
thy ij doughtres and goo out of this town lest that ye perisshe With the^ /
yet he dyssimylyng they took him by the hand and his wif and ij doughtres by
cause that god should spare hem / and ladde the^ out of the cite / And there
they said to him / Save thy soul / and look not behind the / lest thou
perysshe also / but save the in ye montayn / loath said to hem / I beseech the
my lord for as much as thy servant has found grace before the / and that
thou have shewde thy mercy to me / and that peraue^ture I might take harm on
the hille that I may goo in to the lytyl cite here by and may be sauyd there /
he said to loath / I have herd thy prayers / and for thy sake I sal not subuerte
this town for which thou have prayed / hye the and save thy self there / For I
may do nothing till thou be theryn / Therefore that town is called Segor so loath
went in to Segor / And the son aroos / And our lord rayned fro heaven upon
Sodom and Gomor sulphur and fire / and subverted the cytees and all the
dwellers of the towns about that regio^ / And all that was there growyng and
burgenyng / lothis wif turned her and looked toward the cytees and ano^ she was
turned in to a statue or image of salt / which abides so in to this day /
Abraham arose in the morning erly / and looked toward the cytees and saw the
smoke ascendyng fro the places / like as it had be the layte of a fornays /
what time our lord subverted thise cytees he remembered abraham / and delyueryd
loath from the ve^geaunce of the cytees in whichhe duellid Then loath ascended
from segor and dwellid in the mo^tayne / and his ij doughtres with him / he
dredde to abide any longer in the town / but dwellid in a cave he and his ij
doughtres with him / Then the elder daughter said to ye younger / Our fader is
old / And there is noma^ left on the earth living that may do have a do with
us after the manner of the world / come and late us make him drunk and late us
sleep with him that we may have some seed of him / They gaf their fader wine to
drink that night and made him dronke And the elder daughter went to him and
conceived of him he not knowing of it And the second night in like wise
conceyuyd the younger daughter / and loath was not knowing thereof / they
co^ceyuyd both of their fader / The more had a sone and called him Moab / he
is fader of the moabites unto this day / The younger brought forth a another sone
and callid him amon / he is fader of the amonytes unto this day Abraham
departed fro thens and went south ward / and dwellid between cades and Sur and
went a pilgremage to geraris / he said that his wif was his suster / Abymelech
the king of geraris sent for her and took her / God came to abymelech iij his
sleep and said Thou shall be deed for the woman that thou have taken / she has
an husbonde / Abymelech towched her not / and said lord will thou sle a man
ygnorau^t and rightful She said that she was his suster / In the symplen^s of
my heart and clennes of my handee I did this / And god said to him I know^ well
that with a simple heart thou dydest it / And therefore I have kept the fro
having to do with her / Now yield the woman to her husbond / And he shall pray
for the / he is a prophet / and thou shall live / and if thou deliver her not
/ thou shall dye and all they that been in thy hows / Abymelech aroos up the
same night and called all his servants and told them all thise words / all
they dredde sore / also abymelech called abraham and said to him / what have
thou don to us / that we have trespaced to the / Thou have caused me and my
Royam to sin greatly / thou have don that thou sholdest not have don / what
saw thou for to ^o so / Abraham said / I thought that ye dread of god was
not in this place / and that ye would sle me for my wife / and certainly
o^herwyse she is also my suster / the daughter of my fader / but not of my
mother and I have wedded her / and after that I went fro the hows of my fader I
said to her / where someuer we goo / Say thou art my suster / Then
abymelech took sheep and ox^n / and servants and maidens and gaf to abraham
and delivered to him sara his wif and said / lo the land is here to fore the
whersomeuer you wilt dwell and abide / and he said to sara / lo I have given to
thy brother a.M. pieces of silver / this shall be to the a veylle of thyn eyes /
and whersomeuer thou goo remember that thou were taken / Abraham prayde for
abymelech and his meyne / and god heled him his wife and all his servants and
conceyuyd / Our lord had closed the place of engendrng of all the hows of
abymelech for Sara the wife of abraham / Our lord then vysyted Sara and she
co^ceyuyd and brought forth a sone in her old age / that same time that god had
promised / Abraham called his sone that she had born ysaac / and when he was
viij days old he circumcised him as god had conma^ded and abraham was then
an honderd year old / Then said Sara / who would have supposed that I should
give souke to my child being so old I lawhed wha^ I herd our lord say so /
And all they that shall here of it may well lawhe / The child grew and was wened
fro the pappe / And abraham made a great feste at the day of his wenyng / After
this on a day when Sara saw the sone of agar her handmayde play with her sone
ysaac she said to abraham / Cast out this hand maid and her sone / The sone
of the hand maid shall not be her with my sone ysaac Abraham took this word
hard and grievously for his sone / then god said to him late it not be hard
to the for thy sone and handmayde / what someuer Sara say to the here her voys
/ For in Isaac shall thy seed be called / yet shall I make the sone of the
handmayd grow in to great people for he is of thy seed / Abraham arose erly in
the morning and took bread and a botell of water and leyd hit on her sholdre
and gaf to her the child and let her goo / which when she was departed erryd
in the wyldrenes of bersabee / And when the water was consumed that was in the
botel / she left the child under a tree that was there and went thens as far
as a bow shote and set her down / and said I shall not see my sone dye and
there she wept / Our lord herd the voys of the child / And an angele called
Agar saying / what do thou Agar / be not aferd / our lord has herd the
voys of the child fro the place which he is now Inn / Arise and take the
child and hold him by the hand / for I shall make him tencrece in to much
paple / God opened her eyes / And she saw a pytte of water and anon she went
and filled the botell and gaf the child to drink / and abode with him which
grew and dwellid in the wilderness / and becam there a young man and an archer /
and dwellid also in the deserte of pharam / And his mother took to him a wife of
the land of egypt / That same time said Abymelech and phicol the prince of his
oost unto abraham / Our lord is with the in all things that thou do / Swear
thou by the lord that thou grieve not me ne them that shall come after me ne my
kynrede / but after the mercy that I have showed to the / so do to me and my
land in which thou have dwlled as a stranger / And Abraham said I shall swear
/ And he blamed abymelech for the pytte of water which his seruau^tis had
taken away by strength / Abymelech answered / I know not who has don this
thing / And thou toldest me not thereof / and I never herd thereof till this day
And then after this they made covenant to gydre / and promised each to other
to be friends t^^gydre / After all these things god temptyd Abraham and said
to him / Abraham / abraham / he answered and said I am here / and he said to him
Take thou thyn only sone that thou love ysaac and goo in to the land of
vysyon and offer him in sacrefyse to me upon one of the hills that I shall
show to the Then Abraham arose in the night and made ready his ass and took
with him two young men and ysaac his sone / And when they had hewn and gadred
the wood to gydre to make sacrefyse / they went to the place that god
commanded him / The third day after he lift up his eyes and saw from far
the place / and he said to his children / Abide ye here with the ass I and my
sone shall goo to yonder place and when we have worshipped there / we shall
return to you / then he took the wode of the sacrefise and leyd it on his
sone ysaac / and he bare in his hondes fire and the swerd / And as they went
both to gydre / ysaac said to his fader / fader mine what will thou my sone
said abraham / and he said loo here is fire and wode where is the sacrefise yt
shall be offered / abraham answered my sone god shall provide for him a sacrefise
well enough / They went forth and came to the place yt god had ordained / and
there made an awter / and leyd the wode thero^ / And took ysaac and set him
on the wode on the awter / and took his sword and would have offered him up to
god / And lo the angele of god cried to him fro heaven saying / Abraham /
Abraham / which answered I am here / and he said to him / Extend not thy hand
upon thy child / and do nothing to him / Now I know that thou dredest god And
have not spared thyn only sone for me / Abraham looked behind him and saw
emonge the breres a Ra^me fast by the horns / which he took and offrid him
in sacrefyse for his sone / He called that place / the lord sees / The a^gele
called Abraham the second time saying / I have sworn by my self says the lord
/ By cause thou have don this thing / and have not spared thyn only sone for me
/ I shall bless the and shall multeplye thy seed as the sterres of heaven and
like the granel yt is on the sea side / Thy seed shall possede the yates of
their enemies / And in thy seed shall be blessed all the people of therthe for
thou obeydest to me / Abraham then returned to his servants and went unto
bersabee and dwelled there / Sara lyuyd an Cxxvij year and deyed in the cite of
Arbee which is hebron in the land of Canaan / For whom abraham made sorrow and
wept / And bought of the children of heth a field and buried her worshipfully
in a dobble spelunke / Abraham was an old man and god blessed him in all his
thingis / he said to the eldest and vpperist servant of all his hows / I
charge and conjure the by the name of god of heaven and of earth / that thou
suffer not my sone ysaac to take no wife of ye doughtres of Canaan emonge whom I
dwell but goo in to the contre where my kynrede is / and take of them a wife to
my sone / And the servant answered / if no woman there will come with me in to
this contre / shall I bring thy sone in to that co^tre fro whens thou came /
Abraham said / beware that thou led not my sone theder / The lord of heaven and
of earth that took me fro the hows of my fader and fro the place of my natyuyte
has said and sworn to me saying / to thy seed I shall give this land / he shall
send his angele to fore the / and thou shall take there a wife for my sone / if
no woman will come with the / thou shall not be bounden by thyn oath / but in no
wise led my sone thither / his servant then swore and promised to him that
the would so do / he took x cameles of the flock of his lord / and of all his
goods bare with him and went in to mesopotany unto the town of Nachor / And
he made the cameles to tarry without the town by a pytte side at such time as
the women ben wont to come out for to draw water / And there he prayed our
lord saying / lord god of my lord abraham / I beseech the to help me this day
/ and do mercy unto my lord Abraham / Lo I stand here nyhe by the well of
water and the daughters of the dwellers of this town come hither for to draw
water / Therefore the maid to who^ I say set down thy pot that I may
drink / and then she set down her pot and say I will give to the drink
and to the camelis that I may understand thereby that she be the maid that
thou have ordained to thy servant ysaac / and thou show thy mercy to my
lord abraham / he had not fully fynysshid these words with in him self / but
that Rebecca daughter of batuel sone of melche wife of Nachor brother of Abraham
came out of the town having a pot on her sholder which was a right fair
maid and much beautevous and unknown to the man She went down to the well
and filled her pot with water and returned / The servant of abraham ran to
her and said / I pray the to give me a lytil of the water in thy pot for to
drink / which said drink my lord / and lightly took the pot fro her
sholdre and held it and gaf him drink / and when he had drunk she said yet /
I shall give to thy camels drink and draw water for them till all have dronken
/ And she poured out the water in to a vessel that was there for beestis to
drink and ran to the pytte and drew water that eueriche drank his draughte /
he then thought in him self secretly that god had made him to have a
prosperous Journey / After they had drunk he gaf her ij rings to hang on her
eeris weyeng ij sycles and as many armyllis weyeng x sycles and asked her whose
daughter she was / and if there were any Rome in her faders house to be lodged
and she answered I am daughter to bathuel nachors sone / and in my faders hows
is place enough to lodge the and thy camels and plente of Chaf and heye for
them / And the man enclyned down to the ground / And worshipped god saying /
blessid be the lord god of my lord abraham which has not take away his mercy
ne his truth fro my lord / and has brought me in my Journey right in to the
house of my lords brother / The maid Rebecca ran and told at home all that
she had herd / Rebecca had a brother named ^aba^ which hastily went out to
the man where as he was / when he had seen the ryngis in his susters eeris and
her poynettis or armylles on her hands and had herd her say all that the man
said / he came to the man that stood by the well yet and said to him / Come in
thou blessed of god / why stand thou without / I have made ready the hows
for the and have ordained place for thy camels / And brought him in and strowed
his cameles and gaf them chaf and heye / and water to wasshe the camels feet /
and the men's feet that came with him / And they set forth bread to fore him /
which said / I shall not ete till I have don mine erande and said wherefore I am
comen / and it was answered to him / say on / and he said / I am servant of
Abraham / And god has blessed and magnefyed him greatly / and has given to him
Oxen and sheep / silver and gold servants men and wymen Cameles and asses /
And Sara his wife has brought him forth a sone in her old age / and he has
given to him all that he had / And my lord has charged and adjured me saying
/ In no wise late my sone ysaac have no wife of the daughters of canaan in whose
land he dwells but goo unto the hows of my fader and of my kynrede and of
them thou shall take a wife to my sone / wherefore I am comen hither and told
all how be prayed god of some token and how rebecca did to him / And in
conclusion desired to have Rebecca for his lord ysaac / and if he would not that
he might depart and goo in to some other place on the right side or the lift
to seek a wife for his lords sone / Then bathuel and laban said to him / This
word is comen of god / again his will we may nothing do / Lo Rebecca stands
to fore the take her and goo forth that she may be wife unto the sone of thy
lord as our lord has said / which words wha^ Abraham's servant had herd
fylle down to the ground and thanked our lord / And anon took forth silver
vessel and of gold and good clothis and gaf them to Rebecca for a yefte / And
to her brethern and mother he gaf also yeftes / And anon made a feste and ete
and were Ioyeful to gyder On the morn betymes the servant of abraham aroos /
And desired to depart and take Rebecca with him and goo to his lord / Then
the mother and her brethern said / late the maid abide with us but only x days
and then take her and goo thy way I pray you said he Reteyne ne let me not
/ our lord has adressyd my way / and achyeuyd my erand wherefore late me goo to
my lord / and they said / we shall call the maid and know her will / and
when she was demanded if she would goo with that man / She said / ye I shall goo
with him / Then they let her goo and her noryce with her / And so she
departed and they said to her thou art our suster we pray god that thou may
encrece in to a thousand thousand / And that thy seed may possede the yates of
their enemies / Then Rebecca and her maidens ascended upon the cameles and
followed the servant of Abraham which hastily returned unto his lord / That
same time wha^ they come / Ysaac walked by the way without forth and looked up
and saw the cameles coming fro far / Rebecca espied him and demanded of the
servant who that he was that came in the field against them / he answered and
said / that is my lord ysaac / And anon she took her palle or ma^tel and
couerd her / The servant anon told unto his lord ysaac all that he had done
/ which resceyuyd her and lad her in to the tabernacle of sara his mother and
wedded her and took her in to his wife / and somoche louyd her that the love
atte^pered the sorrow that he had for his mother / Abraham after this wedded
another wife / by who^ he had diverse children / Abraham gaf to ysaac all his
possessions / And to his other children he gaf meuable goods / and departed
the sons of his co^cubynes fro his sone ysaac whiles he yet lived And all the
days of the life of abraham were Clxxv year / And then deyed in good mind
and age / And ysaac and Ismael buried him by his wife Sara in a double spelunke

Here begins the life of ysaac with thistorye of Esau and of Jacob which is
read in the church the second sunday of lent
YSaac was xl year old when he wedded rebecca / and she bare him no children /
wherefore he besought our lord that she might co^ceyue and bring forth fruit
Our lord herd his praeyr that she conceived of him And had tweyne sons attones
/ which two er they were born fought often in their moders belly / For which
cause she prayed god to cou^seylle her and to give her comfort / which apperid
and said to her / two manner people ben in thy belly / and two manner folk shall be
divided fro thy womb / people shall overcome people / And the more shall serve the
less / Thus said our lord to her / After this wha^ time came that she should be
delyuerd / there were tweyne to be born The first that issued was rough fro the
heed to the foot and he was named Esau And forthwith followed that other holdyng
the plant of his broders foot in his hond / And he was named Jacob Ysaac the
fader was lx yer old when thise children were born / And after this when they
were grown to reasonable age Esau becam a plowhman and a telyar of therthe /
And an hunter / And Jacob was simple and dwelled at home with his mother / Ysaac
the fader loved well Esau / by cause he ete often of the venyson that Esau took /
And rebecca the mother loved Jacob / Jacob on a time had made good potage / And
Esau his brother had been an huntyng al day and came home sore an hungrid and
fond Jacob having good potage / and prayed him to give him some For he was weary
and much hungry / to whom Jacob said if thou wyllt selle to me thy patrimony
and heritage I shall give the sum potage / ^ And Esau answered / Lo I dye for
hungre / what shall auaylle me mine enheritaunce if I dye / and what shall
proufyte me my patrymonye / I am conte^te that thou take it for this potage
Jacob then said / Swear that to me that thou shall never claim hit / and
that thou art content that I shall enjoy it / And Esau swear it / and so sold
away his patrimony / And took the potage and ete it and went his way /
setting nothing thereby that he had sold his patremony / This aforsaid is for to
bring in my matter of thystorye that is read / For now follows the legende as
it is redd in the church /

Ysaac began to wexe old and his eyes faylled and dymmed that he might not
clerly see / and on a time he called Esau his oldest sone and said to him /
Sone n^yne / which answerde / Fader I am here ready / to whom the fader said /
behold that I wexe old / and know not the day that I shall dye and depart
out of this world / wherefore take thyn harneys / thy bow and quyuer with
takles and goo forth an huntyng / And wha^ thou have taken any venyson / make
to me thereof such manner mete as thou know that I am woned to ete / And
bring it to me that I may ete it / and that my soul may bless the or I dye /
which all thise wordis Rebecca herd / and Esau went forth for taccomplyssh
the coma^dement of his fader / and she said then to Jacob / I have herd thy
fader say to Esau thy brother / bring to me of thy venyson and make thereof
mete that I may ete and that I may bless the to fore our lord er I dye / Now
my sone take heed to my conceyll / and goo forth to the flock and bring to me
two the best kyddes that thou can find / And I shall make of them mete such
as thy fader shall gladly ete / which when thou have brought to him and has
eten he may bless the er he dye / to whom Jacob answered know thou not that
my brother is rowhe and heery / and I smothe / if my fader take me to him and
taste me and feel / I dread me that he shall think that I mock him / and shall
give me his curse for the blessyng / The mother then seid to him / In me said
she be this curse my sone / Nevertheless here me go to the flock and do that I
have said to the he went / and fette the kyddes and delyuerd them to his mother
/ And she went and ordained them in to such mete as she knew well that his
fader louyd / And took the best clothes that Esau had and did hem on Jacob /
And the skynnes of the kyddes she did about his neck and hands there as he
was bare / And delyueryd to him bread and the pulmente that she had boiled /
And he went to his fader and said / fader mine / And he answered I here / who
art thou my sone / Jacob said / I am Esau thy first be gotten sone / I have don
as thou comaundest me / Arise / sit and ete of the venyson of mine huntyng /
that thy soul may bless me / Then said ysaac again to his sone how myghtest
thou said he so soon find and take it my sone / To whom he answered / it was
the will of god / that such thing as I desired came sone to my hand / Ysaac
said to him / Come hither to me my sone that I may touch and handle the / that
I may preue whether thou be my sone Esau or not he came to his fader / And when
he had felt him / ysaac said / the voys truly is the voys of Jacob / but the
hands ben the hands of Esau / And he knew him not / For his hands expressyd
the lyknes and symylitude of the more brother / Therefore blessyng him he said
to him / thou art then my sone Esau he answered and said / I am he / Then
said Ysaac bring to me the mete of thyn hu^tyng my sone / that my soul may
bless the / which he offrid and gaf to his fader / and also wyn / And when he
had eten and dronken a good draught of the wyn he said to Jacob / Come hither
to me my sone and kiss me / and he went to him and kyssed him / Anon as he
felt the sweet savor and smelle of his clothes / blessyng him he said / Lo
the sweet odor of my sone / is as the odor of a field full of flowers / whom
our lord bless / God give to the of the dew of heaven and of the fattenes of
therthe habu^daunce of whete / wine / and oil / And the people serve the / and
the trybus worshipe the / Be thou lord of thy brethern / And the sons of thy
mother shall bow and knele to the / who someuer curse the be he accursed / and
who that blessyth the with blessings be he fulfilled / uneath ysaac had
fulflled these words / and Jacob gone out / when that Esau came with his mete
that he had gotten with huntyng entered in and offered to his fader saying / Arise
fader mine and ete of the venyson that thy sone has ordained for the / that thy
soul may bless me / Ysaac said to him / who art thou to whom he answered / I
am thy first begoten sone Esau / Ysaac then was greatly abasshid and astoned /
And meruaylled more than can be thought credyble / And then he was in a
trance as the master of historyes says in which he had knowleche / that god
would that Jacob should have the blessyng / And said to Esau / who then was he
that right now a lityl to fore thy coming brought to my venyson / and I have
eten of all that he brought to me er thou came / I have blessed him / and he
shall be blessed when Esau herd thise words of his fader / he cried with a
great cry and was sore astonyed and said / fader I pray the bless me also /
to whom he said Thy brother germayn is comen fraudelently / and has receyuyd
thy blessyng Then said Esau certainly and Justly may his name be called well
Jacob / For on another time to fore this / he supplanted me of my patrymonye /
and now secondly he / has / vndernome fro me my blessyng / And yet then he
said to his fader / have thou not reseruyd to me one blessyng / Ysaac answered /
I have ordained him to be thy lord / I have subdued all his brethern to his
seruytude / I have stablysshed him in whete / wine and oil / And after this /
what shall I do to the my sone / To whom Esau said have thou not fader yet one
blessyng / I beseech the to bless me / Then with a great syghyng and weeping
ysaac moved said to him / In the fattenes of therthe and in the dew of heaven
shall be thy blessyng / thou shall live in thy swerd / and shall serve thy
brother / Then was Esau woo begoon / And hated Jacob for supplantyg of his
blessyng that his fader had blessed him with / And seid in his heart / the
days of sorrow shall come to my fader / For I shall slay my brother Jacob / This
was told to Rebecca which anon sent for Jacob her sone and said to him / lo
Esau thy brother threteneth to slay the / Therefore now my sone here my voys and
do as I shall counseyl Make the ready and goo to my brother in Aran / And dwell
there with him unto the time that his anger and furye ben over passed and his
indignacion cessed and that he forgete such things that thou have don to him
/ and then after that I shall send for the and bring the hither again / and
rebecca went to ysaac her husbond and said / I am weary of my life by cause of
the daughters of heth / if Jacob take to him a wife of that kynrede I will no
longer live / Ysaac then callid Jacob and blessed him and commanded to him
saying / I charge the in no wise to take a wife of the kynred of Canaan / but
goo and walk in to mesopotamye of Syrye unto the hows of Bathuel fader of thy
mother / And take to the there a wife of the doughtres of laban thyn uncle / God
almighty bless the and make the grow and multeplye that thou may be encreced
in to tourbes of people / And give to the / the blessings of abraham and to thy
seed after the that thou may possess and owe the land of thy pylgremage /
which he granted to thy grauntsyre / when ysaac had thus said and given him
leave to goo / he departed anon and went in to mesopotamye of Sirye to laban
sone of bathuel brother of Rebekke his mother / Esau seeing that his fader had
blessid Jacob / And sent him in mesopotamye of syrie / for to wedde a wife
there / Ans that after his blessyng commanded to him saying / Take thou no wif
of the doughtres of Canaan / And he obeyeng his fader went in to Syrye /
prouyng thereby that his fader saw not gladly the doughtres of canaan / he
went to Ismael and took him a wife beside them that he had taken to fore / that
was melech daughter of Ismael sone of abraham / Then Jacob departed fro
bersabee / went forth on his Journey toward Aran / when he came to a certain
place after going down of the son / and would rest there all night / took
of the stones that were there and leyed under his heed and slepte in the same
place / And there he saw in his sleep a ladder standing on therthe / And the
upper end thereof touched heaven / And angeles of god ascendyng and descendyng
upon it / and our lord in the myddys of the ladder saying to him I am the lord
god of abraham thy fader and of ysaac / The land on which thou slepest I shall
give to the and to thy seed / And thy seed shall be as duste of therthe / thou
shall sprede a brood unto the eest and to the weste / and north and south / And
all the trybus of therthe shall be blessid in the and in thy seed / And I
shall be thy keeper whersomeuer thou shall goo / And shall bring the again in to
this land / And I shall not leave till I have accomplysshyd all that I have said
/ when Jacob was awaked fro his sleep and dremyng he said / verily god is in
this place / and I wist not of it / And he said dredyngly / how terryble is
this place / None other thing is here but the hows of god and the yate of
heaven / then Jacob arose erly / and took the stone that lay under his heed /
and raised it for wytnes / pouryng oil thereon And callid the name of the place
betel / which tofore was callid luza / And there he made a vow to our lord
saying if god be with me and keep me in the way that I walk and give me bread
to ete / and clothes to cover me / and may return prosperously in to the hows
of my fader / the lord shall be my god and this stone that I have raised in
wytnes this shall be called the hows of god / And good of all things that thou
gyuest to me / I shall offer to the the tithes and teenth part / Then Jacob
went forth in to the eest / and saw a pytte in a field and three flocks of
sheep lyeng by it / For of that pytte were the beestis watered / And the mouth
thereof was she^te and closed with a great stone / For the custom was when all
the sheep were gadred they rolled away the stone / and when they had dronken
they leyde the stone again at the pit mouth / and then he said to the
shepherdes / Brethern whens ar ye / which answerde of Aran Then he askyng
them said / know ye not Laban sone of Nachor / they said / we know him well
how farith he said he is he al hool / he farith well said they / And loo Rachel
his daughter comes there with her flock / Then said Jacob it is yet fer to
eue^ / it is yet time that the flocks be led to drink / and after be driven
to pasture / which answered / we may not so do til all the beestis be gadred
/ and then we remeue the stone fro the mouth of the pit and watre our
beestis / And as they talked Rachel came with the flock of her fader / For she
kept that time the beestes / And when Jacob saw her and knew that she was
his emes daughter and that they were his emes sheep / he remeuyd the stone fro
the pittes mouth / and when her sheep had dronke^ he kissed her and weeping he
told her that he was brother to her fader and sone of Rebecca / Then she
hyed her and told it to her fader / which when he understood that Jacob his
suster sone was come / he Ran against him and enbracyng kissed him / and lad him
in to his hows / And when he had herd the cause of his Journey he said / thou
art my mouth and my flessh And when he had been there the space of a month / he
demanded Jacob if he would gladly serve him by cause he was his cosyn / and
what hyre and Reward he would have / he had two daughters / the more was named
lya / and the less was called Rachel / but lya was blereyed / and Rachel was
fair of visage and well favored / whom Jacob loved and said / I shall serve the
for Rachel thy younger daughter vij year Laban answered / it is better that I
give her to the than to a strange man / dwell and abide with me / and thou
shall have her / And so Jacob served him for Rachel vij year / and him thought
it but a lytil while / by cause of the great love that he had to her / And at
the end of vij year Jacob said to laban give to me my wife for the time is come
that I should have her / Then laban callid all his friends and made a feste
for the weddyng / and at night he brought in lya the more daughter / and
delivered to her an hand maid named zelpha / Then wenyng Jacob that it had been Rachel went to her as the manner is / and when the mornyg came and saw that
it was lya / he said to laban her fader what haste thou don have I not seruid
the for Rachel why have thou brought lya to me / laban answered / hit is not the
usage ne custom of our co^tre to give the younger first to be wedded / but
fulfylle and make an end of this coplement and marriage this weke / and then
shall I give to the Rachel my doughther / for other vij yer that thou shall yet
serve to me / Jacob agreed gladly / and when that weke was passed / he wed /
ded Rachel to his wife / To whom laban her fader gaf an handmayde named Bala /
Nevertheless when the weddyng of the younger was fynysshyd by cause of the great
love that he had to her / him thought that the other vij year were but short /
Our lord saw that he despised lya / he let lya conceive / and Rachel her
suster abode bareyne which then lya bare a sone and named him Ruben saying
Our lord god has beholden mine humylite and mekenes / Now shall mine husbonde
love me / She conceived yet and bare a another sone and said / by cause our
lord saw me despised he has given to me this sone / And she called him Symeon
/ She conceyuyd the third and brought forth another sone and said / Now shall my
husbonde be conpled to me by cause I have born to him three sons / And she
called his name leuy / She conceyuyd the fourth sone and was delyueryd of him
and said / Now I shall knowleche me to our lord / And therefore she named him
Judas / And then she cessed of beryng of children / Rachel ^^yng her self
bareyn had / envy to her suster / and said to Jacob her husbond / Make me with
child or else I shall deye / To whom Jacob was wroth and answerde what wenest
thou that I were god / and has pryued fro the the fruit of thy belly / Then
she said I have my servant bala Goo unto her and late her conceive of the on
my knees that I may have of her sum sons / She gaf bala unto her husbond to
know her / which when Jacob had known she conceived and bare a sone / Then
said Rachel / Our lord has herd my peticion gyvyng to me a son and she
named him dan / After that bala conceived again and bare another sone For whom
Rachel said / Our lord has compared me to my suster / and have a vayled / and
she named him Neptalim / Then de lya felyng that she conceived no more she gaf
zelpha her handmaide to her husbonde which conceived and bare a sone whom lya
named Gad / After Zelpha conceyved another sone / For whom lya said / This is
for my blessidnes / and certainly all generations shall say that I am blessed
Therefore she called him aser Hit happed that ruben went out in harvest time in
to the field / And took there a mandrake which he brought and gaf to his mother
/ Then Rachel said to her suster lya / Give me sum part of the mandrake of
thy sone / lya answered is it not enough ta take fro me my husbonde / but that
also thou will have part of the mandrake of my sone / Then said Rachel he
shall sleep with the this night for the mandrake of thy sone / At even when
Jacob came home fro the field lya went against him and said to him / Thou shall
this night sleep with me / for I have bought the for the mede of the ma^drake
of my sone / he slepte with her that night / And our lord herd her prayers /
She conceyuyd and brought forth the fyfthe sone / and she said / God has
rewarded me / by cause I gaf my handmayde to my husbond / she called his name
ysachar / yet lya conceyuyd and bare the sixthe sone and said / God has
endowed my with a good dower / yet shall my husbond abide with me by cause I
have born to him vj sons / And she called his name zabulon / After this she
co^ceyuyd and bare a daughter named dyna / Then our lord remembryd Rachel and
herd her / and opende the place of concepcion which conceyuyd and bare a sone
saying / Our lord has taken away mine obrobrye and shame And named his name
Joseph saying I pray god to send me another / When Joseph was born Jacob
said to laban his wyuys fader / Give me leave to depart that I may goo in to
my contre and my land / give to me my wyuys and children for whom I have
served the that I may goo hens / Then know what seruyse I have served the /
Laban said to him I have fou^den grace in thy sight / I know it by experience
that god has blessed me for the I have ordained the reward that I shall give to
the / then Jacob answered / Thou know how I have served the / and how much
thy possession was in my hands / Thou had but lytyl when I came to the /
And now thou art rich god has blessed the at mine enter / hit it now right
that I provide somewhat toward mine hows / Laba^ said what shall I give to the /
Jacob answered / I will nothing but that thou do that I demand I shall yet
feed and keep thy beestes / and depart a sondre all the sheep of diverse
color / And all that ever that shall be of diverse colors and spotty as well
in sheep as in gheet / late me have them for my Reward and mede / And Laban
granted thereto / Then Jacob took Rods grene / and took part of the Rynde
away and made tho Rods to be of ij colors and set them to fore the sheep
and beestis when they should engendre and the bestes conceyuyd seeing the Rods
of varyable color In like wise all the lambs that ca^ forth that year were
white and black and of diverse color / Then Laban saw that Jacob has the
most part / and changed the covenant the next year and would have all them of
variable color / and Jacob should have all them that were of one color / And
Jacob then set Rods / of one color before them when the sheep and beestis
conceyuyd / Then at time of departing Laban took them of two colors / and
Jacob the^ that were of one color / Thus was Jacob made much rich ouf of
mesure / and had many flocks / servants both men and wymen Camels and asses
/ After that Jacob had herd laban sons say / Jacob has taken all that was
our faders from him and of his faculte is made rich / he was abashed / And
understood well by Labans lokyng / that he was not so friendly to him ward as he
had been to fore / and also our lord said to him that he should return in to the
land of his faders and to his generation and that he would with him / he then
called Rachel and lya in to the field where as he fed his flocks and said to
them I see well by your faders visage yt he is not toward me as he was
yesterday or ye otherday Forsothe the god of my fader was with me / and ye
know well how I have served your fader with all my might and strength / But he
has deceived me and has changed mine hyre and mede.x. times / And yet our
lord has not suffered him to grieve me / wha^ he said the beestis of party
color should be mine / then all the ewes brought forth lambs of variable
colors / And when he said the contrary / they brought forth all white / God
has taken the substance of your fader and has given it to me / And now god
has commanded me to depart / wherefore make you ready and late us depart hens
/ Then answered Rachel and lya / Shall we have nothing ellis of our faders
faculte and of theritage of his hows / Shall he repute us as strangers / and he
has eten and sold our good / Since god has taken the goods of our fader and
has given it to us and to our children / wherefore all that god comandeth to the
do it / Jacob aroose and set his children and his wives upon his camels and
went his way and took all his substance and flocks and all that he had
gotten in mesopotamye / and went toward his Fader ysaac in to the land of
Canaan / That time was laban goon to shere his sheep / And Rachel stale away
the ydollis of her fader / Jacob would not let laban know of his departing /
when he was departed with all that longed to him of right he came to the mount
of galaad / it was told to laban the third day after that Jacob was fled and
goon / who anon took his brethern and poursiewed him by the space of vij days
/ and ouertoke him in the mount of galaad / he saw our lord in his sleep
saying to him / Beware that thou speak not a^gerly ne hard words to Jacob /
that time Jacob had set his tabernacle in the hylle / and when he came theder
with his brothern he said to Jacob why have thou don thus to me to take away my
daughters as prisoners taken by swerd / why fleddest fro me and would not
let me have knowleche thereof / thou have not suffered me to kiss my sons and
doughtres thou have don folyly / Now may I do the harm and evil / but the god
of thy fader said to me yesterday / Beware that thou speak no hard words
against Jacob / Thou desire to goo to the hows of thy fader / why have thou
stolen my gods / Jacob answered that I departed the not knowing / I dredde
that vyolently thou would have taken fro me thy daughters / and where thou
repreuest me of theft / who someuer have stolen thy gods late him be slain
tofore our brethern Seche and what thou fyndest that is thyn / take with the /
he saying this knew not that Rachel had stolen her faders gods Then laban
entered the tabernacle of Jacob and lya and sought and fond nothing / And when
he came in to the tabernacle of Rachel / she hyed her and hid the Idollis
under the lytter of the the camel and satte upon it / And he sought and fond
naught / then said Rachel late not my lord he wroth / for I may not arise to
the / For now such sekenes as wymen ben wont to have is fallen to me / and so
she deceyuyd her fader / Then Jacob being angry and grutchyng said to laban /
what is my trespaas and what have I sinned to the that thou thus have pursiewed
me / and have serched eueri thing / what have thou now fou^den of all the
substance of thy house leye it forth to for my brethern and thy brethern that
they Judge bitwene me and the / I have served the xx year and have been with the
/ thy sheep and thy gheet were never barreyn / I have eten no wethers of thy
flock / ner best has destroyed no ne / I shall make all good / what was
stolen / I prayed therefore / day and night I labored both in hete and in Cold
/ Sleep fled from mine eyes / Thus I served the in thy hows xx year xiiij for
thy daughters / and six for thy flocks / Thou have changed mine hyre and
reward x times / but if god of my fader Abraham and the dread of ysaac had been
with me / happily thou would now have left me naked / Our lord god has
beholden mine affliction and the labor of mine hands / and repreuyd the
yesterday / Laban answered to him my daughters and sons / and thy flocks and
all that thou beholdest at thyn / what may I do to my sons and neuews / late
us now be friends and make we a fast leghe and confedersy to gydre / Then
Jacob raised a stone and raised it in token of friendship and pees and so they
ete to gydre in friendship / and swear each to other to abide in love ever after
/ And after this laban rose in the night and kyssyd his doughtres and sons and
blessed them and returned in to his contre / Jacob went forth in his Journey
that he had taken / Angels of god met him / which when he saw / he said
these ben the castellis of god / and called that place manayin / he sent
messagers tofore him to Esau his brother in the land of Seir in the land of
Edom / and bad them say thus to Esau / This said thy brother Jacob / I have
dwellid with laban unto this day / I have oxen ande asses servants both men
and wymen I send now a legacion unto my lord that I may find grace in his
sight / Thise messagers returned to Jacob / and said / we came to Esau thy
brother / And lo he comes for to mete with the with iiijC men Jacob was sore
aferde then / and divided his company in to tweyne turmes saying / if Esau
come to that one and destroy that / that other shall yet be saved / Then said
Jacob O god of my fader abraham and god of my fader ysaac / O lord that saydest
to me return in to thy land and place of thy natyuyte and saidest I shall do
well to the / I am the least in all thy mercyes and in thy troth that have
granted to thy servant / with my staf I have goon this river of Jordan / And
now I return with ij turmes / I beseech the lord keep me fro the hondes of my
brother Esau / For I fere him greatly lest he come and smite down the mother
with the sons / Thou have said that thou sholdest do well to me / And sholdest
sprede my seed like unto the grauel of the sea and that it may not be nombred
for multitude / Then when he had slept that night he ordained yeftes for to
send to his brother / goods ijC kyddes xx / sheep ijC and Ra^mes xx / xl kyen
/ and xx bulls / xx asses and x fools of them And he sent by his servants
all thise beestis / And bad them say that Jacob his servant sent to him this
present and that he follows after / And Jacob thought to plese him with
yeftes / The night following him thought a man wrastlyd with him all that night
till the morning And when he saw he might not overcome him / he hurted the
synewe of his thye / that he halted thereof / and said to him / late me goo and
leave me for it is in the mornyg Then Jacob answered I shall not leave the but if
thou bless me / he said to him / what is thy name / he answered Jacob / Then
he said / Nay said he / thy name shall no more be called Jacob / but Israhel /
For if thou have ben strong against god how much more shall thou preuaylle
against men / Then Jacob said to him what is thy name tell me / he answered /
why demandest thou my name which is meruayllous / And he blessed him in the
same place / Jacob called the name of that same place phanuel saying / I have
seen our lord face to face / and my soul is made sauf / And anon as he was
passed phanuel the son aroos / he halted on his foot / therefore the children
of Israhel ete no synews by cause it dried in the thye of Jacob / Then Jacob
lyftyng up his eyes / saw Esau coming and iiijC men with him / and divided the
sons of lya and of Rachel and of both her handmaydens / and set each
handmaid and their children to fore in the first place / lya and her sons in
the second and Rachel and Joseph al behind / And he gooyng to fore knelid
down to ground and worshippyng his brother approached him / Esau Ran for to
mete with his brother / and enbraced him straynyng his neck and weeping kyssyd
him / and he looked forth and saw the wymen and their children and said / what
ben these and to whom longen they / Jacob answered They ben children which god
has given to me thy servant / and his handmaydens and their children
approached and kneled down / and lya with her children also worshippid him / And
last of all Joseph and rachel worshippid him / Then said Esau / whose ben
thise turmes that I have met / Jacob answered / I have sent them to the my
lord unto the end that I may stand in thy grace / Esau said I have many my self
/ keep these and let them be thyn / Nay said Jacob I pray the to take this
yefte which god has sent me / that I may find grace in thy sight / For me
seems I see thy vysage like the vysage of god / and therefore be thou to me
mercyful and take this blessyng of me / uneath by co^pellyng he taking it said
/ late us goon to gyder I shall accompanye the and be felawe of thy Journey /
Then said Jacob / thou know well my lord that I have young children and
tender and sheep and oxe^ which if I over labored should deye all in a day /
wherefore plese it you my lord to goo to fore and I shall follow as I may with my
children and beestis / Esau answered / I pray the then late my felaws abide
and accompanye the what someuer need thou have / Jacob said it is no need / I
need nomoo but one that I may stand in thy favor my lord / And Esau returned
then the same way and Journey that he ca^ in to seir And Jacob came in to
Sochot and bylde there an house And fro thens he went in to Salem the town of
Sychymys which is in the land of Canaan / and bought there a part of a field
in which he fixed his tabernacles of the sons of Emor fader of Sychem for an
hundred lambs / And there he raised an awter / and worshipped upon it the
strengest god of Israhel / Hit happed that dyna daughter of lya went out for
to see the wymen of that regyon / which when Syche^ sone of Emor prince of
that land / saw / anon louyd and rauysshed and slepte with her / oppressyng
her / by strength / And was assotted on her in such wise as he went to his
fader Emor and said / give me this damoyselle in marriage that she may be my wife
/ which when Jacob knew and herd how his daughter was rauyssed / his sons
then being absente in occupacion of fedyng of their beestis in the field / he
held it secret til they returned / then Emor went for to speak of this
matter to Jacob and that time his sons came fro the field and herd what was
happend and don and were passing wroth and angry by cause he had so defowled
their suster / Then said Emor to them / Sychem my sone louyth your daughter /
give her to him in marriage / and late us alye each with other / late our
daughters be given to you and youris to us and duelle ye with us All the
contre is in your power / exercise and occupye it / bye and selle and take ye
it / Then said Sichem to his fader and brethern / what someuer ye ordeyne I
will do / and what ye demand / yeftes or dower I shall gladly give it so I may
have this damoyselle unto my wif / Then answered the sons of Jacob to sichem
and his fader in gyle / dissymilyng as they had not known the rauysshement of
their suster / we may not do that ye desire / ne give our suster to a man
incircumsiced / it is a thing unlawful and great sin to us / if ye will be
circumsiced in every man among you and man child and be like as we be / we shall
take your doughtres and ye ouris and shall dwell to gydre and ben one people /
if ye will not be circu^siced we shall take our suster and goo hens / This offer
plesed to Emor and Sychem his sone / and there was no young man but anon was
agreed to that they asked / he loved somoche the damoyselle / that anon he
went in to the cite and told all this to the people / and that these men were
pesible people and will dwell among us / and that there was no let but that
we be not circu^siced as they be / to which they assented and forth with were
circumsiced / And the third day after wha^ the most pain of the wou^des
grieved them / Then tweyne of Jacobs sons Symeon and Leui brethern of Dyna
drew out their swerdis and entered in to the cite hardely and slew all the
men / both Emor and Sychem / and took Dyna their suster with them fro Sychems
hows / and this don the other sons of Jacob fylle on the remenau^t and slew
all that they fond in auengyng the shame and Rauysshement of their suster /
wastyng oxen and sheep / asses and other beestis / And took their wives and
children in to captyuyte / which thyngis thus don Jacob said to Symeon and
Leui / ye have troubled me / and have made me hateful to the cananees and
phereseis dwellars in this contre / we ben but a few / they shall gadre them to
gydre and destroy me and my hows / They answered / should we suffer our suster
to be holden as a common woman / After this our lord apperid to Jacob and said /
Arise and goo up to Bethel and dwell there / and make there an awter to the
lord that apperid to the in the way / when you fleddest fro thy brother Esau /
Jacob then called all them of his hows and said / Cast away fro you all
your strange gods that been emonge you / and make you clean and change your
clothes / Arise and late us go in to bethel / and make we there an awter to our
lord that herd me in the day of my tribulacion / and was felaw of my Journey /
Theenne they gaf to him all their strange gods and the gold that henge on
their eeris / And he dalfe a pit behind the cite of Sichem and threw hem
therein / And when they departed / all the contrees thrr about were aferd /
and durst not pursiewe them Then Jacob came to a place called luza which is
in the land of Canaan and all the people with him which otherwise is called
bethel / he edefyed there an awter to our lord and named that place the hows of
god / Our lord apperid to him in that place when he fled fro his brother Esau
/ that same time deyde delbora the noryce of Rebecca and was buried at the Rote
of Bethel under an Oak / Our lord apperid again to Jacob after that he was
returned fro mesopotamye of Syrye / and was come in to Bethel / and blessed him
saying / Thou shall no more be called Jacob / but Israhel shall be thy name / and
called him Israhel and said to him / I am god almighty / grow and multeplye /
Folks and peples of nation shall come of the / Kings shall come of thy lendes /
the land that I gaf to abraham and Isaac / I shall give to the and thy seed /
And vanysshed away fro him / he then raised a stone for a remembrance in the
place where god spack to him and enoynted it with oil / Calling the name of
the place Bethel / He went thens and came in veer time unto the land that goth
to effratam / in which place Rachel trauaylled and began for cause of chyldyng
to deye / the mydwyf said to her be not aferd for thou shall have a son / And
the death drawyng nere she named him bennom which is as much to say / as the
sone of my sorrow / The fader called him Bemamin / that is say / the sone of
the right hand / There Rachel deyde and was buried in the way toward Effratam /
that is Bethleem / Jacob reysid a title upon her tomb / this is the title of
the monume^te of Rachel unto this present day / Jacob went thens And came to
ysaac his fader in to Mambre cite of arbee / that is ebron In which dwelled
Abraham and ysaac / and all the days of ysaac were complete which were an
honderd and four score year / And he consumed / deyd in good mind / and Esau
and Jacob his sons beryed him /

Thus ends thystorye of ysaac and his two sons Esau and Jacob
Hyer begins thystorye of Joseph and his brethern which is red the third
sunday in Lent /
Joseph when he was xvj year old began to keep and feed the flock with his
brethern / he being yet a child / And was accompanied with the sons of bala
and zelpha wives of his fader / Joseph co^playned on his brethern and accused
them to their fader of the most euylle sin / Israhel louyd Joseph above all
his sons for as much as he had gotten him in his old age / And made for him a
motley cote / his brethern then seeing that he was byloued of his fader more
tha^ they were / hated him and might not speak to him a pesyble word / It
happed on a time that Joseph dremed and saw a sweuene and told it to his
brethern / which caused hem to hate him ye more / Joseph said to his brethern
/ here ye my dreme that I had / Me thought that we bond sheuys in the field /
And my sheef stood up / and youres sto^dyng round about and worshipe my
sheef / his brethern answerde / Shall thou be our king / And shall we be
subgette and obey thy commandment / Therefore this cause of dremes and of these
words mynystred the more fume of hate and envy / Joseph saw another sweuene
and told to his fader and brethern / Me thought I saw in my sleep the son
the moon and xj sterres worshipe me / which when his fader and his brothern
had herd / the fader blamed him and said what may betokene this dreme that thou
saw / Trowest thou that I. thy mother. and thy brethern shall worshipe the
upon therthe / his brethern had great envy here at / The fader thought and
considered a thing secretly in him self / On a time when his brethern kept
their flocks of sheep in Sichem / Israhel said to Joseph / Thy brethern feed
their sheep in Sichem Come and I shall send the to them / Which answered I am
ready / and he said / goo and see if all thing be well and prosperous at thy
brethern and beestis and come again and tell me what they do / He went fro
the vale of Ebron and came unto Sichem there was a man fond him erryng in the
field / and axed him what he sought And he answered / I seche my brthern tell
me were they feed their flocks / The man said to him / They ben departed fro
this place I herd them say / late us goo in to Dothaim / which then when
his brethern saw him come fro far to fore he approached to them they thought
to slay him / and spack to gydre saying / Loo see the dremer comes / Come and
let us slay him and put him in to this old cisterne / And we shall say that
some wild evil be has devoured him / And then shall appear what his dremes
shall proufyte him / Ruben heeryng this thought for to deliver him fro their
hands and said / Late us not sle him ne sh^de his / blood / but keep your
hondes vndefowled / This he said willing to keep him fro their hands / and
render him again to his fader / Anon then as he came they took of his motley
cote / and set him in to an old cisterne that had no water / As they satte
for to ete bread / they saw ysmaelites come fro Galaad and their camels
bryngyng spyces and Reysyus in to egypt / Then said Judas to his brethern /
What should it pr^^ffyte us / if we (...) our brother and shed his blood (...)
better that he be sold to (...) / and our hands be not (...) / he is our
brother and our flessh (...) brethern agreed to his words / And drew him out
of the cysterne sold him to the Madyanytes marchantes passing forth by to
Ismalytes for xxx pecis of silver / which ^ad him in to egypt / At this time
when he was sold Ruben was not there but was in another field with his beestis
/ And when he returned and came unto the cysterne and fond not Joseph / he ta^e
his clothes for sorrow and came to his brethern and said the child is not yonder
whyther shall I goo to seche him / he had supposed his brethern had slain him in
his absence / they told him what they had don / and took his cote and
besprenklid it with the blood of a kyd which they slow / and sent it to their
fader saying / See whether this be the cote of thy sone or not / this we have
fou^den / which anon as the fader saw it said / This is my sons cote / an
evil wild beeste have deuouryd him So^me best has eten him / and re^te his
clothis and did on him a sack cloth bewayllyng and sorowyng his sone a long
time / All his sons gadred them to gyder for to comfort their fader and
aswage his sorrow / but he would take no comfort but said / I shall descend to
my sone in to ^elle for to bewaylle him there / And thus he abydyng in sorrow
the madianytes carried Joseph in to egypt / and sold him to putiphar eunuche
of pharao master of his knights / thus was Joseph led in to egypt / and
putiphar prince of the oost of pharao an egypcian bought him of the hands of
Ismaelites / Our lord god was always with Joseph / and he was wise ready and
prosperous in all manner things / he dwelled in his bordes house / and plesed
so well his lord that he stood in his grace yt he made him vpperist and above
all other / and betoke him ye rule and governance of all his hows / which well
and wisely governed ye household and all that he had charge of / Our lord
blessed the hows of egypt for Joseph's sake and multeplyed as well in beestis as
in feldes all his substance / Joseph was fair of vysage and well favored /
after many days ye lady his masters wife beheld and cast her eyes on Joseph
and said to Joseph / come and sleep with me / which anon refused that / and
would not attend ne liste^ unto her words / ne would not consent to so synful
awerke / and said to her / Lo has not my lord delyueryd to me all that he has
in his house and he knows not what he has / and there is nothing therein but
that it is in my power and at my co^mandem^t / exepte the which art his wife /
how may I do this evil and sin to my lord / such manner or se^blable words
he said daily to her / and the woman was the more desirous and grievous to the
young man / and he always forsook and refused the sin / hit happed on a day
that Joseph e^tred in to the chamber about certain needs that he had to do /
and she caught him by his mantel / and held it fast and said to him / come
and lie with me / who anon would not agree to her but fled forth out of the
doors / and left his ma^tel behind him in her hand / and when the lady saw
yt she was refused and his mantel in her hand / She cried and called the me^
of the house and said to he^ / Loo this ebrewe is comen to my chamber and would
have enforced and have leyn by me / and when I cried he fled out of the
chamber and left for have his mantel that I held behind him / and in to
witness of truth she shewde to her husbond the mantel when he came home and
said / Thy servant hebrew whom thou have brought in to this house is entered in
to my chamber for to have leyn by me And when I cryde he left his ma^tel that
I held and fled away / when the lord herd this anon he gaf faith and byleuyd
his wife / And being sore wroth / set Joseph in prison / where as the
prisoners of ye king were kept / and he was there fast set in / Our lord god
was with Joseph and had mercy on him and made him in the favor and grace of
the chief kepar of the prison in so much yt he delyueryd to Joseph the keeping
of all the prisoners / and what he did was done and ye chyef gayler was plesid
with all / Our lord was with him and directed all his werkis / After this it
fylle so that ij officers of the kings trespaced unto their lord / wherefore he
was wroth with hem and commanded the^ to the prison where as Joseph was / That
one of the^ was the boteler / and that other the baker / and the kepar betoke
them to Joseph to keep / and he served them / After a while that they had been
in prison they both saw on one night a dreme / of which they were astonyed
and abashed / and when Joseph was comen in to serve them and saw the^ heavy /
he demanded the^ / why they were heuyer than they were woned to be / which
answered / we have dremed and there is none to Interpret it to us / Joseph said
to them / suppose ye yt god may not give me grace to interpret it / Tell to me
what ye saw in your sleep / Then the boteler told first / and said / me
thought I saw a vine had iij branches and after they had flowred ye grapes
were ripe / and then I took the cup of pharao in my hand and took the
grapes and wrange out of the^ wyn in to the cup that I held and presented it
to pharao to drink / Joseph answered / The iij branches ben yet iij days
after which pharao shall remember thy seruyse / and shall resre the in to thy
formest office and gree / for to serve him as thou were woned to do / Then I
pray the to remember me when thou art at thyn above and be to me so mercyful to
sue unto pharao that he take me out of this prison / For I was stolen out of ye
lord of hebrews / and am innoce^tly set here in prison / then the master
baker saw that he had wisely Interpreted the botelers dreme / he said / Me
thought that I had iij baskettes of mele upon my heed and in that one baskette
that was hiest me thought I bare all the mete of the bachows / and birds came
and ete of hit / Joseph answered / This is thynterpretacio^ of the dreme / ye
iij baskettis ben iij days yet to come after which pharao shall smite of thy
heed and shall ha^ge the on the cross / and the birds shall tere thy flessh /
and the third day after this / pharao made a great feeste unto his children /
and remembrid him him among the meles on the master boteler and the master
baker / he restored his boteler unto his office / and to serve him of the cup
/ And that other was hanged that the troth of the interpretour was byleuyd and
proved / Notwithstondyng the master boteler in his wealth forgate Joseph his
interpretour / Two year after pharao saw in his sleep a dreme / him thought he
stood upon the river fro which he saw vij oxen asce^de to the land which were
fair and right fat and were fed in a fat pasture / he saw other vij come
out of the river pour and lene and were fed in places plenteuous and
bourgenyng Thise devoured the other that were so fat and fair / here with he
sterte out of his sleep / and after slepte again and saw another dreme / he
saw seven eeris of corn standing on one stalk full and fair of corns / and as
many other eeris void and smeton with drought which devoured the beauty of the
first vij / in ye morning pharao awoke and was greatly aferde of these dremes /
and sent for all coniectours and dyuynours of Egypt and wise men and when they
were gadred he told to the^ his dreme / and there was none that could interpret
it / Then at last the master boteler reme^bryng Joseph said / I knowleche
my sin / on a time the king being wroth with his seruau^tis sent me and the
master of the bakers in to prison / where we in one night dremed both
prodyges of things coming / And there was a child of thebrewes servant to the
gayler to whom we told our dremes / and he expowned the^ to us and said what
should happene / I am restored to mine office and that other was hanged on the
cross / Anon by the kings co^mandem^t Joseph was taken out of prison and
shaue^ bayned / and changed his clothes and brought to fore pharao / to whom
he said I saw a dreme which I have showed unto wise men / and there is none yt
can tell me thinterpretaco^n thereof / to whom Joseph a^swerd god shall answer
by me things prosperous to pharao / Then pharao told to him his dremes like
as is to fore wret^^ of the vij fat oxen and vij been and how the lene
devoured ye fat and in like wise of the eeris / Joseph answerde / the kyngis
dreme one thing with god has shewde to pharao / The vij fat oxen and ye vij
eris fulle / betokene vij year to come of great plente and comodyous / and the
vij lene oxen and the vij void eeris smeton with drought / betokene vij year
after the^ of great hungre / and scarcete / Loo there shall come first vij year
of great fertilite and ple^te / in all the land of egypt / after whom shall
follow other vij year of so great sterilite / bareyne and scarcete / that
thabundau^ce of the first shall be al forgote^ the great hu^gre of these latter
years shall consume all the ple^te of the first yeris / the latter dreme
perteyneth to the same by cause god would that yt should be fulfyllid / Now
therefore late ye king provide for a man that is wise and wytty / that may
coma^de and ordeyne prouostis and officers in all places of the Royame that
they gadre in to garners and barnes the fyfthe part of all the corn and
fruytes yt shall grow these first vij plenteuous years that been to come / and
that all this whete may be kept in barnes and garners in towns and villages
that it may be made ready against the coming of the vij scarce yeris that shall
oppress by hu^gre all egypt / to the^de yt the people be not e^famyned / This
cou^seil pleysid much to pharao and to all his mynystris Then pharao said to
his servants / where should we find such a man as this is which is fulfyllyd
with the spirit of god / and then he said to Joseph For as much as god has
showed to the all that thou have spoken / trowest thou that we might find any
wyser than thou or like to the / Thou shall be vpperist of my hows / and to the
co^mandem^t (...) thy mouth all people shall obey / I on^^ shall goo to fore the
and sytte but ^sete above the / ye said pharao to Joseph Lo I have ordained the
above and master upon all the land of egypt / he took a ring fro his hand
and gaf it in to his hand / and cladde him with a double stole furryd with
byse / and a golden coler he put about his neck / and made him to asce^de
upon his chare / the second trompet cryeng that all me^ should knele to fore him
/ and that they should know him vpperyst prouoste of all the land of egypt /
Then said ye king of egypt to Joseph / I am pharao / without thy
comandeme^t shall noma^ meue hand ne foot in all the land of egypt / he
changed his name / and called him in the tongue of egypt the savior of the
world / he gaf to him a wife named Assenech daughter of putiphar priest of
Eliopoleos / Joseph went forth then in to the lord of egypt / Joseph
was.xxx. year old when he stood in the favor and grace of pharao / And he
went round about all ye regyone of egypt / The ple^teuosnes and fertylyte of
the vij year ca^ / And sheues and shockes of corn were brought in to the barnes
/ All the habu^daunce of fruytes was leyde in every town / There was so great
ple^te of whete that it might be compared to the grauel of the sea / and the
ple^te thereof excedeth mesure / Joseph had ij sons by his wife er ye famyne and
hu^gre came which assenech the prestes daughter brought forth / of whom he
callid the name of ye first Manasses saying / god has made me to forgete all
my labors / and the house of my fader has forgote^ me / he callid the name of
the second sone Effraim saying / god has made me to grow in the land of my
pouerte / Then passyd the vij yeris of ple^te and fertylyte that were in
egypt And the vij yeris of scarcete and hungre began to come which Joseph had
spoken of tofore / and hu^gre began to wexe and grow in the universal world /
also in all the land of Egypt was hungre and scarcete and when the people
hungered they cried to pharao axyng mete to whom he answered goo ye to Joseph /
and what so^euer he say to you / do ye / daily grew and encresyd the hu^gre
in all the land / then Joseph opened the barnes and garners and sold corn to
thegipcie^s / For the hu^gre oppressid the^ sore / all prouynces ca^ in to
egypt for to bye mete to the^ / and teschewe the hungre / Jacob fader unto
Joseph herd tell that corn and vytayllis were sold in egypt / and said to
his sons / why be ye necglyge^t / I have herd say that corn is sold in egypt
/ Goo ye theder ^ and bye for us that is necessary and behoefful / yt we may
live and consume not for need / Then the x brethern of Joseph descended in to
egypt for to bye whete / and beniamyn was left at home with the fader / by
cause what someuer happed to the brethern in her Journey / then they entrid
in to the land of egypt with other for to bye corn / There was great famyne in
the lord of Canaan / and Joseph was prince in ye lord of egypt / also by his
comandem^t whete was sold unto ye people / Then when his brethern were come^
and had adoured and worshipped him he anon knew the^ / and spack to them as to
strangers hard words / dema^dyng them saying / whens be ye which answered /
of the lord of Canaan and come hither to bye that is necessary for us / and
though he knew his brethern / yet was he unknown of the^ / he reme^bryd the
dremes that he sometime had seen and told them / and said ye be spies and be
come^ hither for tespye the weykest places of this lord / which said to him /
it is not so lord / but we thy servants ben comen for to bye vytaylles / we
ben all sons to one man / we come pesybly ne we thy servants think ne
ymagyne none evil / to who^ he answered / it is all other wise / ye be come^
for to espy and considere the secretest places of this Royame / Then they
said / we were xij brethern thy servants sons of one man in the land of
Canaan the youngest is at home with our fader / and that other is deed / That is
said he that I said / ye be spies / Now I have of you thexperyence I swear to
you by thelthe of pharao ye shall not depart till that your youngest brother come
/ Send ye one of you for him for to bring him hither / ye shall abide in
feathers in prison till the truth be prouyd wether tho thyngis that ye have
said be true or false / Else by thelthe of pharao ye be spies / And delyueryd
them to be kept three days / The third day they were brought out of prison to
whom he said / I dread god if ye be pesible as ye say / do as ye have said /
and ye shall live late one brother be bounden in prison / and goo ye your way
and led home the whete that ye have bought in to your houses / and bring to
me with you your youngest brother / than I may preue your words yt ye deye not /
They did as he said and spacken to gydre / we ben worthy and have well
descruyd to suffer this / For we have sinned in our brother / Seeing his
anguyssh when he prayed us and we herd him not / Therefore this trybulation is
fallen on us / Of whom Ruben said / Said not I to you / In no wise sin not
ye in the child and ye would not here me / Now his blood is wroken / They knew
not that Joseph understood them for as much as he spack always to the^ by an
interpretour / Then Joseph turned him a lytyl and wept / After he returned
to he^ / and took symeo^ in their presence and bond him and sent him to
prison And commanded to his mynystris to fill their sackis with whete / and to
put each man's money in their sackis / and above that to give the^ mete to
spend in their which did so / And they took their whete and leyde it on
their asses and departed on their way / After one of them on the way opened his
sack for to give his be mete and fond his money in the mouth of his sack
and said to his brethern / me money is given to my again lo I have found it
in my sack / and all they were astonyed / what is this that god has don to us
/ Then they came hom to their fader in to the land of Canaan and told to him
all things that was fallen to the^ saying / The lord of the contre has spoken
hard to us / and had supposed that we had been spies of that prouynce / To who^
we answered that we were pesible people ne were no such espyes / and that we
were xij sons gote^ of one fader / One is deed / and the youngest is with our
fader in ye land of canaan / which then said to us / Now shall I preue
whether ye be pesible or no / ye shall leave here one brother with me / and led
home that is necessary for you / and goo your way / and see that ye bring
with you / your youngest brother that I may know that ye be none espyes / and
that ye may Rsseyue this brother that I hold in prison / and then forthon
what that ye will bye ye shall have license / And this said / each of them poured
out the whete / and every man fond his money bounden in the mouth of every
sack / Then said Jacob their fader / ye have made me without children /
Joseph is goon and lost / Symeo^ is bounden in prison / and Beniamyn ye will
take away fro me / In me comen all these euillis / To whom Ruben answered S^ee
my two sons if I bring him not again to the / deliver him to me in my hand
and I shall restore him again to the / the fader said / my sone shall not goo
with you / his brother is deed / and he is left now allone / if any aduersyte
should hap to him in the way that ye goo unto / ye shall led my old here is
with sorrow to hell / In the mean while famyne and hungre oppressid all the
land greatly / And when the corn that they brought fro egypt was consumed
Jacob said to his sons / Return ye in to egypt and bye for us some mete that
we may live / Judas answerde / That man said to us under sweryng of great oaths
/ That ye shall not see my face ne come to my presence but if ye bring your
youngest brother with you / Therefore if thou will send him with us / we shall goo
to gyder and shall bye for us that shall be necessary / and if thou will not we
shall not goo / The man said as we often have said to the / that if we bring
him not we shall not see his visage / Israhel said to them / This have ye don in
to my myserye / that ye told to him that ye had another brother / And they
answerde / The man demanded of us by order our progenye if our fader lived and
if we had any brother / And we answerde him consequently after that he demanded
/ we wiste not what he would say ne yt he said bring your brother With you /
Send the child with us that we may goo forth / and live / and that we ne our
children deye not for hungre / I shall resseyue thy sone And require him of my
hand / if I led him not thedre and bring him again I shall be gylty to the of
the sin ever after / if there had been no delay of this we had been there and
comen again by this time / Then Israhel their fader said to the^ / if it be
so necessary as ye say / do ye as ye will / take with you of the best
fruytes of this land in your vessellis / and give ye and present to that man
yeftes a lytyl Reysyns and honey / Storax scacten / therebinthe and dates and
bear with you double money / and also the same money that ye fond in your
sackes lest there by any error therefore / and take with you benjamin your
brother My god that is almighty make him plaisan^t unto you / And that ye may
return in saefte with this your brother and him also that he holds in prison
I shall be as a man barayen there whiles without children / Then the brethern
took the yeftes and double money and beniamyn / And went forth in to egypt
and came and stood to fore Joseph / whom when he had seen and beniamyn / he
commanded to ye steward of his hows / that he should do slay sheep and calves
and make a feste / For these brethern shall dyne with me this day / he did as
he was commanded and brought the me^ in to his lords house Then were they all
aferd and said softly to gydre / by cause of the money that we had in our
sackis we be brought in that he take us with the defaulte / and shall by
violence bring us and our asses in to seruytude / wherefore they said to the
steward of the house in the yate of the hows er they entrid saying / we pray
the to here us / the last time that we ca^ to bye vitaille / which when we
had bought and departed and were on our way for to give our beestis mete we
opened our sackes and we fond in the mouth of our sackis our money that we had
paid / which we now bring again of the same weight / and we have more other
for to bye to us that shall be necessary it is not in our conscience to have
it / we wete never who put it in our sackis he a^swerd to him / pees be emo^ge
you Fere ye nothing / the god of your fader has give to you ye tresour yt ye
fo^de in your sackes / for the money yt ye paid to me I have it ready / and
then he brought in symeon to them / and brought them in to the house and
wesshe their feet / and gaf mete to their asses / they made ready and ordained
their yeftes and presents again the coming of Joseph / Tey herd say that they
should dyne and ete there / Then Joseph e^trid in to the hows / and they
offered to him the yeftes holdyng the^ in their hands and worshipped him falling
down to the ground / And he debonairly salewed them / and demanded the^ saying
/ Is your fader in good health of whom ye told me / lives he yet / They answered
/ thy servant our fader is in good health and lives yet / and kneled dou^ and
worshipid him / Then he castyng his eyes on his brother beniamyn that was of
one mother and said / Is this your young brother of whom ye told me / and also
said god be mercyful to the my sone / he hyed him fro them ward / for he was
meuyd in all his spirits and wept on his brother and went in to his bed
chamber / After this he wesshe his vysage and ca^ out making good contynau^ce
and coma^ded to set bread on ye board / and after yt he set his brothern in
order each after their age and ete to gydre / and Joseph sat and ete with
thegipciens For it was not lauful to thegipciens to ete with thebrewis / and
each of the^ were well served / but beniamyn had the best part / and they ete
and drank so much that they were dronken / Then Joseph coma^ded the styward
of his house to fille their sackes with whete as much as they might receive /
and the money of the whete put it in to every man's sack / and take my cup
of silver and the money of the youngest and put that in his sack / and all this
was done / and on the morn by times they were suffered to depart with their
asses / And when they were goon out of the town and a lytyl on their way then
Joseph said to his steward / make the ready and ride after and say to the^ why
have ye don evil for good / the cup that my lord is acustmed to drink in ye
have stolen / ye might not do a werse thing / he did as Joseph had coma^ded
and ouertoke the^ and said to them all by order like as he had charge / which
answerde / why says your lord so / and does to us his seruau^ts such lettyng
/ the money that we fond in our sackes we brought again to ye fro the land of
Canaan And how may it follow yt we should stele any gold or silver fro ye house
of thy lord / look at whom it be found of us all thy servants / late him
deye / which said to them / be it after your sentence / At whom that it ever
be founden he shall be my servant / and the other shall goo free and be not
gylty / Then he hyed and set down all their sackes beginning at tholdest
unto the youngest / and at last fond the cup in the mouth of the sack of
Benjamin / Then they all for sorrow cut and rented their clothes and laded
their asses again and returned all in to the town again / Then Judas entrid
first with his brethern unto Joseph / And all they to gydre fille down platte
to the ground / To whom Joseph said / why have ye do thus / know not ye
that there is noman like to me in the science of knowleche / To whom Judas
answered / what shall we answer to the my lord / or what shall we speak or
rightfully desire / God has founden and remembrid thiniquite of us thy
servants For we all be thy servants / ye we and he at whom the cup was
founden / Joseph answered god forbede that I should so do / who someuer stale
the cup shall be my servant / And go ye your way for ye shall be free and goo
to your fader / Then Judas approchyd ner him and spack with a hardy chere to
him and said / I beseech the my lord to here me thy servant that I may say
to thyn audyence a word / and and that thou will not be wroth to thy servant
/ Thou art next to pharao my lord / Thou demandest first of us thy servants
/ have ye a fader or brother / And we answered to the my lord / Our fader is an
old man / and we have a brother a young child which was born to him in his
old age / whose brother of the same mother is deed / and he is an only sone /
whom the fader loves tenderly / Thou saidest to us thy servants / bring hem
hither to me / that I may see / we told to the my lord for truth / Our fader
may not forgoo the child / if he forgoo him certainly he shall deye / And thou
saidest to us thy servants / but if ye bring him with you ye shall no more see
my vysage Then when we came to our fader and told him all these things and
our fader bad us to return and bye more corn / To whom we said / we may not
go theder but if our youngest brother goo with us / For if he be absente we dar
not approach ne come to the presence of ye man / And he answered to us ye know
well that my wife brought to me forth but ij sons / That one went out and ye
said that wild beestis had devoured him / and yet I herd never of him ne he
apperid not / if now ye should take this my sone / and any thing happend to him
in the way ye should bring mine hoar here with sorrow to hell / therefore if I
should come home to my fader / and bring not the child with me since the soul
and health of my fader depends of this child / and see yt he is not come with
us / he shall deye / and we thy servants should led his old age with wayllyng
and sorrow to hell / I my self shall be thy propre seruan^t / which have
receyuyd him upon my faith and have promised for him saying to my fader / if I
bring him not again / I shall be gylty of the sin to my fader ever after / I
shall abide and continue thy servant for ye child in the mynystery and seruyse
of the my lord I may not depart the child being absente / lest I be witness of
the sorrow that my fader shall take / wherefore I beseech the to suffer this
child to goo to his fader / and receive me in to thy seruyse Thus said Judas
with much more as Josephus a^tiquitatu^ reherceth more pytously / and says
more over that the cause why he did do hyde the cup in beniamyns sack was
to know whether they louyd be^iamin or hated him as they did him what time
they sold him to thismaelites / Then this request made Joseph myhgt no
le^ger forbere / but coma^ded the^ that stood by to withdraw them and when all
men were goon out / sauf he and his brethern / he began to say to them weeping
/ I am Joseph your brother / lives yet my fader / The brethern were so aferd
yt they could not speak ne answer to him / Then he debonairly said to them
come hither to me / And when they came nere him he said / I am Joseph your
brother that ye sold in to egypt / Be ye not aferde / ne think not hard unto
you that ye sold me in to thise regions / God has sent me to fore you in to
egypt for your health / It is ij year since the famyne began and yet ben v year
to come in which men may not ere sow ne repe /

God has sent me to fore you / you / that ye should be reseruyd on therthe /
and that ye may have mete to live by / It is not by your cou^seyl that I was
sent hither / but by the will of god / which has ordained me fader of pharao
/ And lord of all his hows / and prince in all the land of egypt / Hye you
and goo to my fader and say ye to him / This word sends to the thy sone
Joseph / God has made me lord of the universal land of egypt / Come to me
lest thou deye / and thou shall dwell in the land of Iessen Thou shall be
next me / you and thy sons and the sons of thy sons / and I shall feed thy
sheep thy beestis and all that thou have in possession Yet resten five year to
come of famyne / therefore come lest thou perysshe thy hows and all that you
owe Lo your eyes and the eyes of my brother Beniamyn see / that my mouth
speaks these words to you / Show ye to my fader all my glory and all that
ye have seen in egypt / Hye ye and bring him to me / This said he enbraced
his brother Beniamyn about his neck and wept / And he also wept on him /
Joseph then kyssed all his brethern and wept upon each of them / After this
they durst better speak to him / Anon it was told and known all about in
the kings halle / that Joseph's brethern were comen / And pharao was Ioyeful
and glad thereof and all his household / and pharao said to Joseph that he
should say to his brethern / lade ye our beestis and goo in to the land of
Canaan / and bring fro thens your fader and kynred / and come to me / And I
shall give you all the goods of egypt that ye may ete the mary of therthe /
Comande also that they take carriage of this land of egypt for the carriage of
their children and wives / and say to them / Take your fader and come as soon
as ye may and leave nothing behynd you / For all the best things shall be
youris / The sons of Israhel did as they were commanded / To whom Joseph gaf
caryage after the commandment of pharao and mete to ete by the way / he
commanded to give to euerich two garmentis / To Beniamyn he gaf iijC pieces of
silver with five garmentis of the best / and also he sent clothyng to his
fader / addyng to them ten asses which were laden all with Richesses of egypt
/ And as many asses laden and beryng bread and vytayll to spend by the way /
And thus he let his brethern depart fro him saying / Be ye not wroth in the
way / Then they thus departing ca^ in to the land of Canaan to their fader
/ and shewde all this to their fader and said / Joseph thy sone lives and he
lordeth in all the land of Egypt / wha^ Jacob herd this / he awoke as a man
had been awaked suddenly out of his sleep / yet nevertheless he byleuyd them not /
And they told to him all the order of the matter / When he saw the caryage and
all that he had sent / his spyrite reuyued and said / It suffyseth to me if
Joseph my sone yet live / I shall goo and see him er I dye / Then Israhel
went forth with all that he had and came to the pytte where to fore he had
sworn to god / and slew there beestis to make sacrefises to ye god of ysaac
his fader / he herd god by a vysion that same night saying to him / Jacob.
Jacob. To whom he answered / I am here al ready / God said to him / I am
strengest god of thy fader ysaac / dread the not / but descend down in to
egypt / I shall make the to grow there in to great people / I shall descend
with the theder / and I shall bring the again when thou retornest / Joseph
sothly shall put his hands upon thyn eyes / Jacob then aroos on the morn
erly And his sons took him with their children and wives and set them on the
caryages that pharao had sent to bring him and all that he had in in the
land of Canaan / And so came in to egypt with all his progenye sons and
children etc^ These ben the names of the sons of Israhel that entrid with him
in to egypt / The first begoten Ruben with his children four / Symeon with his
vij sons / Leuy with his iij sons / Judas and his sons iij / Ysachar and his
iiij sons / Zabulon and his sons iij. These were sons of lya that Jacob gate

sowles of the hows of Jacob that entrid in to egypt were in all lxx Jacob
sent then to fore him Judas unto Joseph to show to him his coming / And he
came to Joseph in Iessen / And anon Joseph ascended his chare went for to mete
his fader and when he saw him he enbraced him mekely and wept / And his fader
receyuyd him Ioyously and enbraced also him / Then said the fader to Joseph /
Now shall I dye Ioyously by cause I have seen thy vysage / Then said Joseph to
his brethern and to all the hows of his fader / I shall goo and ascend to
pharao and shall say to him / that my brethern and the hows of my fader that
were in the land of Canaan be come to me and ben men keeping sheep and can the
manner well for to keep the flocks of sheep / and that they have brought with

servants from our chyldhode unto now / and our faders also / This shall ye
say that ye may dwell in the land of Iessen / For thegipciens have spyte unto
herdmen of sheep / Then Joseph entered to fore pharao and said to him / my
fader / my brethern their sheep and beestis ben comen fro the land of Canaan /
and be in the land of Iessen / And he brouht five of his brethern to fore the
king / whom he demanded / of what occupacion they were of / they answered / we
ben kepers of sheep thy servants / we and our faders we be come to duelle in
thy land / For there is no grass for the flocks of sheep of us thy seruantis
/ the famyne is so great in the land of Canaan / we beseech the that thou
comande us thy servants to dwell in the land of Iessen Then said the king
of Joseph / Thy fader and thy brethern ben comen to the The land of egypt is
at thy commandment / make thou them to duelle in the best place and deliver
to them the land of Iessen / And if thou know them for connyng / ordeyne them
to be maistres of my beestis / After this Joseph brought his fader in / And
made him stand to fore the king / which blessid him / and was demanded of
the king how old he was / he answered / The days of the pylgremage of my lif
ben an C.xxx year small and evil / And yet I am not comen unto the days of my
faders that they have lyuyd / and he blessed the king and went out / Then
Joseph gaf to his fader and brethern possession in egipte in the best soil of
Ramesses like as pharao had commanded / and there fed them gyuyng to each of
them vytaylle / In (...) the world was scarcete of bread / And hu^gre and
famyne oppressyd specially and most the land of egypt and the land of Canaan
/ Of which lands Joseph gate all the money for sellyng of whete and brought

for horses / sheep / oxen and asses / and sustained them one year for chaungyng
of their beestis / Then came they again the second year and said / we hyde not

And there is nothing left but our bodies and our land / why then shall we
deye in thy sight / And we our self and also our land shall be thine / Bye us
in to bondship and seruytude of the king / and give us seed to sow lest the
earth torn in to wilderness / Then Joseph bought all the land of egypt /
every man sellyng his possessions for the vehement hungre that they had / he
subdued all unto pharao / and all his people fro the last terms of egipte unto
the vtterist ends of the same / exepte the land la^gyng to the priests which
was given to them by the king / to whom were given vitaillis openly out of
all the barnes and garners / And therefore they were not compellid to selle
their possessions / Then said Joseph to all the peples / Lo now ye se and
know that pharao owes and is in possession of you and of your land / take to
you seed and sow ye the feldes that ye may have fruit / the fyfte part thereof
ye shall give to the king / and four parts I promise to you to sow and for
mete to your servants / and to your children / which answered / Our health is
in thyn ho^de / late our lord only behold us and we shall gladly serve ye king
/ fro that time unto this present day / In all the land of egipte the fifte
part is paid to the king / and it is holden for a law / exept the land
longyng to the prestes which is fre fro this condition / Then / Israhel
dwellid in egipte / in the land of Iessen / and was in possession thereof / he
encreced and multiplied greatly and lyuyd therein xvij year / and all the years
of his life were an honderd and seven and forty year / when he understood that
the day of his death approached he callid to him his sone Joseph and said to him
/ If I may find so much grace in thy sight do to me so much mercy as thou
promise and swear that thou berye me not in egipte / but that I may rest with
my faders / and take and carye me fro this land / And leye me in the sepulcher
of my forn faders / To whom Joseph answered / I shall do that thou have
commanded / then said he / Swear that to me / And so he swore / And then
Israhel adoured and worshipped our lord and turned him toward his beds heed /
Then this don anon after it was told to Joseph that his fader was seek and
feeble / who anon took his sons Manasses and effraim and came to his fader /
anon it was told to the fader / Lo thy sone Joseph comes to the / which
then was conforted satte up in his bed / And Joseph entrid in and Jacob
said / Almighty god apperid to me in luza which is in the land of canaan /
and he blessid me and said I shall encrece the and multeplye in to tourbes of
peples / I shall give to the this land and to thy seed after the in sempyternal
possession / therefore thy two sons that been born to the in this land of
egypt to fore I came hither to the / shall ben my sons Effraim and manasses /
they shall be reputed to me as symeon and Ruben / The other that thou shall get
after them shall be thyn / and shall be called in the name of their brethern in
their possessions / Then he seeing Joseph's sons said to him who ben these
children Joseph answered / they be My sons which god have given to me in this
place / bring them hither said he to me that I may bless them / Isreal's eyes
were dymmed and might not see clerly for great age he took them to him and
kyssed them / and said to Joseph I am not defrauded fro the sight of the / and
furthermor god has showed to me thy seed / Then when Joseph took them fro his
faders lap / he worshippid him knelyng low to therthe / And set Effraym on
his right side and on the lift side of Israhel / and manasses on the right side
of his fader Israhel / which took his right hand and leyde it on the heed of
effraim the younger brother / and his lift hand on the heed of manasses which
was first born Then Jacob blessed the sons of Joseph and said / God in whose
sight walked my faders Abraham and ysaac / God that had fed me fro my yongthe
unto this present day / The angele that has kept me from all euyllis bless
these children / and my name be called on them and the names of my fadres
Abraham and ysaac / and grow they in to multitude upon therthe / Then Joseph
seeing that his fader set his right hand upon the heed of effraim the younger
brother took it heuyly / and took his faders hand and would have leyd it on the
heed of Manasses / and said to his fader / Nay fader it is not conuenyent that
ye do this is the first begoten sone / set thy right hand on his heed /
Which renyed that / and would not do so / but said / I wot my sone / I wot
what I do / and this sone shall encrece in to peples and multeplye / but his
younger brother shall be gretter than he / and his seed shall grow in to gentyles
/ And blessed them saye^g that same time In the shall be blessed Israhel and
shall be said / Make god the like to Effraim and manasses And said to Joseph his
sone / lo now I dye / and god shall be with you / and shall reduce and bring you
again unto the land of your faders / And I give to the one part above thy
brethern which I gate and wan fro the hand of Amorrey with my swerd and
mybowe / Then Jacob called his sons to fore him and said to hem / gadre ye
all to gydre to for me that I may show to you / things that been to come / And
here your fader Israhel / And there he told to each of them his condion
singulerly / And when he had blessid his xij sons he commanded them to berye
him with his faders in a double spelu^ke which is in the field of ephron ethey
/ against mambre in the land of canaan which Abraham bought / And this said
he gadred to him his feet and deyde / which anon as Joseph saw / fylle on his
visage and kissed him / he commanded / to his maistres of phisik and medicines
which were his servants / that they should enbame the body of his fader with
sweet spices aromatykes / which was all don / and then went they sorowyng
him.xl. days / the egypcyens waylled him lxx. days and when the wayllyng was
passyd Joseph did say to pharao how he had sworn and promysid to berye him in
the land of Canaan / To whom pharao said Goo and berye thy fader like as thou
have sworn / which then took his faders body and went / and with him were
accompanied all the aged men of pharaos house And the noblest men of burthe of
all the land of egypt / the hows of Joseph with his brethern / without the
young children. flocks and beestis / which they left in the land of Iessen /
he had in his felawship chares carts and horsemen / And was a great tourbe and
company / and came over Jordan where as they hallowed thexequyes by great
wayllyng vij days long / And when they of the contre saw this plancte and
sorowyng / they said / This is a great sorrow to thegypcyens / And that same
place is named yet / the bewayllyng of egypt / The children of Israhel did as
they were commanded and bare him in to the land of Caanan / and buried him in
the double spelu^ke which abraham had bought / Then when Jacob their fader
was buried / Joseph with all his fellowship returned in to egypt / Then his
brethern after the death of their fader spaken to gydre pryuely and dredyng that
Joseph would avenge the wrong and evil that they had don to him / camen to him
and said Thy fader coma^ded us er he deyde / that we should say thus to the /
we pray the that thou will forgete and not remember the sin and trespaas of
thy brethern / ne the malice that they executed in the / we beseech the that
thou will forgive to thy fader servant of of god this wickedness / which when
Joseph herd wept bitterly / and his brethern ca^ to him knelyng low to the
ground and worshippid him and said / we ben thy servants / To whom he
answered / be ye nothing aferd ne dread you not / wene ye that we may resist
gods will / ye thought to have don to me evil / but god has Turned it in to
good / and has exalted me as ye see and know / that he should save much people
/ Be ye nothing aferde / I shall feed you and your children And conforted them
with fair words and spack frendely and Ioyously to them / And he abode and
duellyd stylle in egypt with all the house of his fader / And lyuyd an hundred
and ten year / And saw the sons of Effraym in to the third generation /
After these things he said to his brethern / After my death god shall vysyte you
/ and shall do you depart fro this land / unto the land that he promised to
Abraham. Ysaac. and Jacob when that time shall come take my bones and led them
with you fro this place / and then deyde / whose body was enbamed with sweet
spyces and aromatikes / And leyde in a chest in egypt /

Thus ends thystorye of Joseph and his brethern
Hyer next follows thystorye of moses which is read in the church on
mydle^te sunday:
These ben the names of the children of Israhel that entryd in to egypt with
Jacob / And each entrid with their household and meyne / Ruben / Symeon / Leuy /
Judas / Ysachar / Zabulon / Beniamyn / Dan / Neptalyn / Gad and Aser / they
were all in nombre that entered lxx. Joseph was to fore in egypt / And when he
was deed and all his brethern / and kynred the children of Israhel grew and
multeplyed greatly and filled the earth / Then was there a new king upon
egypt / which knew nothing Joseph / and said to his people / Loo and see /
the people of the children of Israhel is great and strenger than we be / Come
and late us wisely oppress them lest they multeplye and give us bataylle and
fight with us / and drive us out of our land / Then he ordained prouostes
and maystres over them to set them awerke and put them to affliction of
burdens / They bylded to pharao two tones / phiton and Ramesses / how much
more they oppressid them so much more they encreced and multeplyed / The
egypcyens hated the children of israhel / and put them to affliction scornyng
and having envy at them / and oppressyd bytterly their life with hard and sore
labors of tyle and claye / and greuyd all them in such werkis / The king of
egypt said to the mydwyues of the hebrews of whom that one was called Sephora
/ and that other phua and commanded / when so is that the time of burth is and
that ye shall do your office in helpyng in the burthe of children / if it be a
man child slay him if it be a maid child keep it and late it live / The
mydwyues dredde god / and did not as the king commanded them / but reseruyd and
kept the men children For whom the king sent and said / what is the cause
that ye reserve and kept the men children / they answered / There ben of
thebrewys wymen that can the craft of mydwyuys as well as we / and er we come
the children be born / God did well herfore unto the mydwyues / And the people
grew and were greatly comforted / And by cause the mydwyues dredde god / they
edefyed to them howses / Then Pharao commanded to his people saying /
whatsomeuer is born of males / Cast ye in to the River / and what of wymen /
keep ye them and late ye the^ live / After this was a man of the hows of leui
went out and took a wife of his kynrede / which conceyuyd and brought forth a
sone / and he saw him elegaunt and fair / hid him three months / And when
he might no longer hyde him / took a lytyl krybbe of rysshes and wykers / and
pitchid it with glewe and pitche / and put therein the child / and set it on
the River And let it drive donn in the streme / and the suster of the child
stondyng aferre consyderyng what should fall thereof / and it happed that same
time the daughter of king pharao descended down to the River / for to wasshe
her in the water and her maidens went by the brynke / which then when she
saw the lytyl crybbe or fiscelle / she sent one of her maidens to fetch and
take it up / which so fette and brought to her she saw therm lyeng a fair
child and she having pity on it said / This is one of the children of the
ebrewis / To whom anon spack the suster of the child / will thou said she that
I goo and call the a woman of thebrews / that shall and may norysshe this
child / She answered / Go thy way / The maid went and called his mother / To
whom pharaos daughter said / Take this child and norysshe him to me / and I
shall give to the thy mede and reward / The mother took her child / and
norysshid it / And when it was wened and could goo she delyured it to the
daughter of king pharao / Whom se receyuyd and adopted instead of a sone and
named him Moses / saying that I took him out of the water / And he there grew
and wexe a praty child / And as Josephus antyquitatu^ says this douhgter of
pharao which was named termuthe louyd well moses and reputed him as her sone
by adopcion / and on a day brought him to her fader who for his beauty took him
in his arms and made much of him / And set his dyademe on his heed wherein
was his ydole / And moses anon took it and cast it under his feet and trade
on it / wherefore the king was wroth and demanded of the great doctors and
magyciens what should fall of this child / And they kalked on his natyuyte and
said / this is he that shall destroy thy Regne and put it under foot / and
shall Rewle and govern thebrews / wherefore the king anon decreed that he should
be put to death / but other said that moses did it of chyldhood and ought not
to dye therefore / and conceyled to make thereof a preef / and so they did / they
set to fore him a plater full of coals brennyng and a plater full of cheryes
and bad him ete and he took and put the hoote coals in his mouth / and brenned
his tongue which let his speech ever after / and thus he escaped the death /
Josephus said that when pharao would have slain him / Thermuthe his daughter
plucked him away and sauyd him / Then on a time as moses was full grown he
went to his brethern / and saw the affliction of them / and a man of egypt
smytyng one of the hebrews his brethern / And he looked hither and theder and
saw nomam he smote thegypcien and slew him / and hyd him in the sonde / And
another day he went out and fond two of the hebrews braulyng and syghtyng to
gydre / then he said to him that did wrong / why smytest thou thy neyhbour
/ which answered / who has ordained the prince and Judge upon us / will thou
slay me as thou slewest that other day an egypcyen / Moses was aferde and said
to him self / how is this deed known and made open / Pharao herd hereof and
sought moses for to slay him / which then fled fro his sight and dwelled
in the land of mady^n and satte there by a pyt side / The priest of Madyan had
vij daughters / which came theder for to draw water / and to fylle the vessels
for to give drink to the flocks of the sheep of their fader / Then came on
them the herdme^ and put them from it / Then roose moses and defended the
maidens and let them watre their sheep / which then returned to their fader
Ietro / and he said to them why come ye now erlyer than ye were wont to do /
They said / that a man of Egypt has delyueryd us fro the hand of the
herdme^ / and also he drew water for us and gaf to the sheep drink / where is
he said he / why left ye the man after you / goo call / him that he may ete
sum bread with us / Then Moses swear / that he would dwell with him / And
he took Sephora one of his daughters and wedded her to his wife which conceyuyd
and bare him a sone whom he called Gersam saying / I was a stranger in a
strange land She brought to him forth another sone / whom he named Eleazar
saying The god of my fader is my helper / and has kept me fro the hand of
pharao / long time after this / deyed the king of egypt / And the children of
Israhel wayllyng made great sorrow for thoppressyon of their labor and cryde
unto god for help / Their cry came unto god of their werkis and god herd
their wayllyng / and remembryd the promise that he made with Abraham ysaac and
Jacob / And our lord beheld the children of Israhel and knew them moses fed
the sheep of Ietro his wives fader / when he had brought the sheep in to the
innerest part of deserte / he came unto the mount of god Oreb Our lord apperid
to him in fla^me of fire in the myddys of a busshe / And saw the fire in the
busshe / and the busshe brenned not Then said Moses / I shall goo and see
this great vysyon why the busshe brenneth not / Our lord then beholding that
he went for to see it / Called him being in the busshe and said Moses.
moses. which answered / I am here / Then said our lord / Approach no ner
hytherward / Take of thy shone fro thy feet / the place that thou stondest on
is holy ground / and said also / I am god of thy fader / god of Abraham and god
of ysaac and god of Jacob moses then hid his face and durst not look
toward god To whom god said / I have seen thaffliction of my people in / egypt
/ and I have herd their cry of the hardness yt they suffer in their werkis /
And I knowing the sorrow of them am descended to deliver them fro the hand of
thegypcyens / and shall led them fro this land in to a good land and spacyous
/ in to a land that flows milk and honey / unto the places of Cananeis.
Ethei. Amorrey. Pheresey. Eney and Iebusey / The cry of the children of
Israhel is comen to me / I have seen their affliction how they ben oppressyd of
thegypcyens but come to me and I shall send the unto pharao / that thou shall
led the children of Israhel out of egypt / Then moses said to him / who am
I that shall goo to pharao and led the children out of egypt / To whom god
said I shall be with the / And this shall be the sign that I send the / when
thou shall have bed out my people of egypt / thou shall offer to god upon
this hylle / Moses said unto god / Loo if I goo to the children of Israhel and
say to them God of your faders has sent me to you / if they say what is his
name / what shall I say / Our lord said to Moses / Ego sum qui sum / I am that
I am / he said / thus shall thou say to the children of Israhel / He that is
sent me to you / and yet shall thou say to them / The lord god of your fadres
/ god of Abraham. god of ysaac and god of Jacob has apperid to me saying /
This is my name for ever more / And this is my memoryall fro generation to
generation / Go and gadre to gydre / the senyors and aged men of Israhel and
say to them / the lord god of your faders has apperyd to me god of Abraham /
and god of ysaac / and god of Jacob saying / vysytyng I have vysited you / and
have seen all that is fallen in egypt / and I shall led you out of
thaffliction of egypt in to the land of Canane / Ethei etc^ unto the land
flowyng mylk and honey / And they shall here thy voys / Thou shall goo and take
with the senyors of Israhel to the king of egypt and shall say to him / The
lord god of thebrewes has called us / we shall goo the Ionrey of iij days in
wyldernes that we may offer to our lord god but I know well that the king of
egypt shall not suffer you to goo but by strong hand / I shall stratche out my
hand and shall smite egypt in all my meruaylles that I shall do amyd among them
/ After that he shall let you goo / I shall then give my grace to this people
to fore thegypciens / And when ye shall goon out ye shall not depart void ne
with naught / but every woman shall borowe of her neyhbour and of her hostess
vessel of silver and of gold and clothes / and them shall ye leye on your sons
and on your doughtres and ye shall Rob Egypt / Then Moses answered and
said / They shall not believe me ne here my voys / but shall say / god has not
apperyd to the / God says then to him / what is that thou hold in thyn
hand / he answered a rod / our lord said / cast it on the ground he threw
it down / And it turned unto a serpent whereof moses was aferde and would have
fled / Our lord said to him / put forth thy hand and hold him by the taylle
/ he stratched forth his hand and held him / And it turned again in to a
Rod / To this that they believe the that I have apperid to the / and yet our
lord said to him / Put thy hand in to thy bosom / which when he has put in /
and drawn out again / it was like a lepres hand / our lord bad him to
withdraw it in to his bosom again and drew it out and it was then like that
other flesh / if they here not the and believe by the first sign and tokene /
They shall believe the by the second / if they believe none of the two ne here
thy voys / Then take water of the River / and pour it on the dry ground /
And what someuer thou take and drawest shall torn in to blood / Then Moses
said / I pray the lord send some other / for I am not eloquente but have a
lettyng in my speech / Our lord said to him / who made the mouth of a man / or
who has made a man dombe or deef. seeing or blind not I Go therefore I shall be
in thy mouth and shall teache the what thou shall say Then said Moses / I
beseech the lord said he / send sum other whom thou will / Our lord was
wroth on Moses and said / Aaron thy brother deke^ I know that he is eloquent
/ Lo he shall come and mete with the / and seeing the / he shall be glad in his
heart / Speak thou to him and put my words in his mouth And I shall be in thy
mouth and in his mouth / and I shall show to you what ye ought to do / And he
shall speak for the to the people / And shall be thy mouth / and thou shall be in
such things as parteyne to god / Take with the this Rod in thyn hand / by
which thou shallt do signs and meruaylles / Then Moses went to Ietro his
wyuys fader and said to him / I shall goo and return to my brethern in to
egypt / and see if they yet live / To whom Ietro said / Goo in gods name and
pees / Then said our lord to moses / Goo and return in to egypt / All
they ben now deed that sought for to slay the / Then Moses took his wife and
his sons and set them upon an ass and returned in to egypt beryng the
Rod of god in his hand / Then our lord said to Aaron / Goo against Moses
and mete with him in deserte / which went for to mete with him unto the mount
of god / and there kyssed him / And Moses told unto Aaron all that our lord
had said to him for which he sent him and all the tokenes and signs that he
bad him do / They came both to gydre and gadred and assamblyd all the senyors
and aged men of the children of Israhel / And Aaron told to them all that god
had said to Moses / and made the signs and tokenes to fore the people / and
the people byleuyd it / they herd well that our lord had vysyted the children of
Israhel and that he had beholden thaffliction of them / wherefore they fill down
low to the ground and worshipped our lord / After this Moses and Aaron went
unto pharao and said / This said the lord god of Israhel Suffer my people to
depart that they may sacrefyse to me in deserte / Then said pharao who is
that lord yt I may (...) his voys and leave Israhel / I kno^^ not that lord ne
I will not leave Israhel / They said to him / God of the ^ebrewis has callid
ve that we goo (...) Journey of three days in the (...) and sacrefyse unto our
lord god (...) parauenture pestelence ^or war (...) to us / The king of
egypt said to them / Why sollycyte ye Moses and Aaron the people fro their
werkis and labor / Goo ye unto your work / Pharao also said / The people is
much See how they grow and multeplye and yet much more should do if they
rested fro their labor / Therefore he coma^ded the same day / to the prefectes
and maistres of their werkis saying / In no wise give no more chaf to the people
for to make lome and claye but late them goo and gadre stopple / and make the^
to do as much labor as they did to fore / And less it nothing / They do
now but cry / late us goo and make sacrefyse to our god / late them be
oppressid by labor and excercisid that they attend not to lesynges / Then
the prefectes and maistres of their work said to them / that pharao had
commanded to give them no chaf / but they should goo and gadre such as they
might find / And that their work should not therefore be mynusshed / Then the
children were dysperplyd for to gadre chaf / And their maistres awayted on them
/ and bad them make an end of your work / as ye were wont to do when that
chaf was delyured to you / And thus they were put to more affliction / and would
make them to make as many tyles as they did to fore / Then the vpperist of
the children of Israhel came to pharao and complained saying why put thou
thy servants to such affliction / he said to them ye be so idle that ye say
ye will goo and sacrefyse to your god / ye shall have no chaf given to you / yet
ye shall work your custumable work / and gadre your chaf also / Then the
eldest and vpperist emonge thebrews went to Moses and Aaron / and said what
have ye don / ye have so don that ye have made our odor to stynke in ye sight
of pharao / and have encoraged him to sle us / god see and Judge this between
you and us / Then Moses counseylled with our lord how he should do and said
lord why have thou sent me hither / For since I have spoken to pharao in thy
name / he has put thy people to more affliction than they had to fore / and
thou have not deliueryd them / Our lord said to Moses / Now thou shall see what
I shall do to pharao By strong hand he shall late you goo and in a boystous he
shall cast you fro his land / yet said our lord to Moses I am the lord god
that apperid to Abraham Ysaac and Jacob in my might / And my name is Adonay / I
showed to them not that / I promised and made covenant with them that I should
give to them the land of Canaan in which they duellyd / I now have herd the
wayllyng and the tribulacions that thegypciens oppress them with / For which
I shall delyure and bring them from the seruytude of thegypcie^s / Moses told
all these things to the children of Israhel / And they byleuyd him not for the
anguyssh of their spiretes that they were Inn / and hard labor / Then said
our lord to Moses / Goo and enter in to pharao and bydde him delyure my people
of Israhel out of his land / Moses a^swerd how should pharao here me wha^ the
children of Israhel believe me not / Then our lord said to Moses and Aaron
that they both should goo to pharao / and give him in comandem^t to late the
children of Israhel to depart / And he said to moses / Lo I heue ordained the
to be god of pharao / And Aaron thy brother shall be thy prophet / Thou shall
say to him all that I say to the / And he shall say to pharao that he suffer
the children of Israhel to depart fro his land / but I shall enharde his heart
/ and shall multeplye my signs and tokenes in the land of egypt And he shall not
here ne believe you / And I shall led the children of Israhel my people / And
shall show mine hand and such wonders on egypt / that Egypciens shall know
that I am the lord / Moses and Aaron did as our lord commanded them / Moses
was lxxx. yer old when he came and stood to fore pharao / and Aroan lxxxiij.
year when they spack to pharao / Then when they were to fore pharao / Aaron
cast the rod down to fore pharao / and anon the rod turned into a serpent
/ Then pharao callid his magyciens and Iogelers and badde them do the same /
and they made their witchecraft and inuocacions / And cast down their rods /
which turned in like wise in to serpents / But the Rod of Aaron devoured
their Rods / yet was the heart of pharao hard and so endurat that he would not
do as god bad / Then said our lord to Moses / The heart of pharao is greuyd
and will not deliver my people / Goo to him to morn in the morning / And he shall
come out / And thou shall stand when he comes on the bank of the River / and
take in thy hand the Rod that was turned in to the serpent and say to him /
The lord god of thebrews sends me to the saying / Delyure my people that they
may offer and make sacrefise to me in deserte / yet thou have no will to here
me / Therefore our lord said / In this shall thou know that I am the lord Loo I
shall smite with the rod that is in my hand the water of the flood / and it
shall torn in to blood / the fysshes that been in the water shall deye / and
thegipcie^s shall be put to affliction drynkyng of it Then said our lord to
moses / say thou to Aaron / take this rod and stratche thyn hand upon all
the waters of egypt upon the floodes / Ryuers / pondes and upon all the lakes
where any water is in that they torn in to blood / that it may be a vengeance
in all the land of egypt as well in treen vessels as in vessels of earth and
stone / Moses and aaron did as god had coma^ded them and smote the flood with
the rod to fore pharao and his seruau^ts which turned in to blood and the
fisshes that were in the River deyde / and the water was corrupt / And
thegypcie^s might not drink the water / and all the water of egipte was turned
in to blood / And in like wise did thenchantours with their witchecraft / and
the heart of pharao was so indurat that he would not let the people depart as
our lord had commanded / but he returned home for this time Thegypciens went
and doluen pittes for water all about by the river / and they fond no water
to drink / but all was blood / And this plaghe endured vij days / and what
someuer water the children of Israhel took in this while was fair and good
water / This was the first plaghe and vengeance / The second was that god
sent frosshes so many that all the land was full / the Ryuers / the howses /
chambres beds that they were woo begoon / And these frosshes entrid in to
their mete so many that they couerd all the land of egypt / Then pharao
prayed moses and aaron that god would take away these frosshes / and that he
would goo suffer the people to do sacrefise / and then moses axid wha^ he
would delyure them if ye frosshes were voided / and pharao said on the morn And
then moses prayde and they uoyded all / and when pharao saw that he was
quyt of the^ / he kept not his promise and would not let them depart / The
third vengea^ge that god sent to them was a great multitude of hongry
horseflyes / as many as thuste of therthe / which were on men and bote the^ and
beestis and the^chantours said then to pharao this is the fyngre of god / yet
would not pharao let the^ depart / The fourth vengeance was that god sent
all manner kind of flies and lyse in such wise the universal land of egypt
was full of all manner flies and lyse / but in the land of Iessen were none /
yet was he so indurate that he would not let them goo / but would that they
should make their sacrefyse to god in that land / But moses would not so but
good iij days / Journey in deserte / and sacrefyse to god there / Pharao said
I will well that ye goo in to deserte / but goo not fer / and come sone again /
and pray ye for me / and moses prayed for him to our lord / and the flies
voyded / that there was not one left and wha^ they were goon / Pharao would not
keep his promise / Then the fyfthe plaghe was that god showed his hand upon
the feldes and upon the horses / asses Camels / sheep / and oxen and was a
great pestelence on all the beestis / And god showed a wonder miracle / between
the possessions of the egypcyens and the possessions of his people of Israhel /
for of the beestis of the children of Israhel there was not one that perisshid /
yet was pharao so hard herted that he would not suffer the people to depart /
The sixth plaghe was that Moses took ashes out of the chymney / and casted on
the land / And anon all the people of egypt as well men as beestis were full of
botchis beelis and blaynes / and wounds and swellyng in their bladders in
such wise that the^chantours could ne might not sto^de for pain to for pharao
/ yet would not pharao here the^ ne do as god had coma^ded The seventh plaghe
was an haylle so great that there was never none like to fore / and tho^dre and
fire that it destroyed all the gras and herbs of egipte And smote down all
that was in the feld men and beestis / but in the land of Iessen was none herd
ne harm done / yet would not Pharao delyure them / The eight our lord sent to
them locustes which is a manner great fly called in som^e place an adder bolte
/ which bote them and ete up all the corn and herbs that was left in such
wise that the people ca^ to pharao and desired him to delyure saying that the
land perysshyd / Then pharao gaf to the men license to goo and make their
sacrefyse and leave their wives and children there stylle till they come again /
but moses and Aaron said that they must goo all / wherefore he would not let
them depart / The ix plage and vengeance was that god sent so great derknes
upon all the land of egypt / that the derknesse was so great and horrible
that they were palpable / and it endured iij days and iij nyghtes /
whersomeuer the children of Israhel went it was light / Then pharao callid
Moses and Aaron and said to them / Goo ye and make your sacrefyse unto your
lord god / and late your sheep and beestis only abide / To whom moses said /
we shall take with us such hostyes and sacrefyses as we shall offer to our lord
god All our flocks and beestis shall goo with us / there shall not remain as
much as an naylle that shall be necessary in the honor of our lord god / For
we know not what we shall offer till we come to the place / pharao was so
indurate and hard herted that he would not let them goo / And bad moses / that
he should no more come in his sight / For when thou come / thou shall deye /
Moses answered / be it as thou have said / I shall no more come to thy presence /
And then our lord said to moses there rests now but one plage and
vengeange / And after that he shall let you goo / But first say to all the
people that every man borowe of his friend and woman of her neighbor vessel of
gold of silver and clothes / our lord shall give to his people grace and favor
to borowe of thegypciens / and then gaf to them a commandment how they should
depart / and our lord said to moses at mydnyght I shall enter in to Egypt /
And the first begoten child and heyr of all egypt shall deye / fro the first
begoten sone of pharao that sytteth in his trone unto the first begoten sone of
the handmayd that sytteth at mylle / and all the first begoten of the beestis
/ There shall be a great cry and clamor in all the land of egypt / in such
wise that there was never none like / ne never shall be after and among all the
children there shall not an hound be hurt ne noman ne be / whereby ye shall
know by what miracle god deuydeth thegypcyens and Israhel / Moses and Aaron
showed all these signs and plaghes to fore pharao / and his heart was so
indurate that he would not late the^ depart / Then when moses had said to
the children how they should dooer they departed and ete their pask lamb and
all other cerymonyes as ben expressyd in the bible / for a law tendure ever
among the^ / which the children of Israhel obeyed and acco^plysshyd / it was
so that at mydnyght our lord smote and slew every first begoten sone through out
all the land of egypt / beginning at the first sone and heyr of pharao unto
the sone of the caytyf that lay in prison / and also the first begoten of the
beestis / Pharao ar^os in the night and all his servants and all egypt / and
there was a great clamor and sorouful noise and cry / For there was not an hows
in all / egyptebut there lay therein one that was deed / Then pharao did do
call Moses and Aaron in the night / and said / Arise ye and goo your way fro
my people ye and the children of Israhel as ye say ye will / Take your sheep
and beestis with you like as ye desired / and at your departing bless ye me
Thegypcyens constrained the children to depart and goo their way hastily
saying / we all shall deye / The children of Israhel took then mele and put
it on their sholdres as they were commanded and borrowed vessels of silver and of
gold and much clothyng / our lord gaf to them such favor to fore thegypcyens
that thegipcye^s lent to the^ all yt they desired / and spoylled and Robbed
egypt / Aed so the children of Israhel departed nyhe the no^bre of vj honderd
thousand foot men beside wymen and children which were Innumerable / And an
huge great multitude of beestis of diverse kind / The time that the children
of Israhel had dwelled in Egypt was four honderd year /

And so they departed out of Egypt and went not the right way by the
philisteis but our lord lad them by the way of deserte which is by the reed
see And the children descended out of egypt armed Moses took with him the
bones of Joseph / for he charged the^ so to do wha^ he deyde / They went in
thextreme ends of the wyldernes / and our lord wento to fore the^ by day in a
columpne of a cloud / and by night in a colu^pne of fire / and was their leder
and ducthe pyler of the cloud faylled never by day / ne the pyler of fire by
night to fore the people / Our lord said to moses I shall make his heart so hard
that he shall follow and pursyewe you / and I shall be gloryfyed in pharao and in
all his host / Thegipcie^s shall know that I am lord / and anon it was told to
pharao that the children of Israhel fled / and ano^ his heart was changed
and also the hertes of his servants and said what shall we do shall we suffer
the children to deperrte and no more to serve us / forthwith he took his chare
and all his people with him / he took with him vjC chosen chares / and all the
chares and waynes of egipte and the dukes of all his hoostes and he poursyewyd
the children of Israhel and followed them in great pride / and when he approached
that the children of Israhel saw him come / they were sore aferd and cried to
our lord god and said to moses was there not sepulture enough for us in egypt
but that we must now deye in wilderness / Said not we to the / Goo fro us and
late us serve thegypcyens / it had been much better for us to have served
thegypciens / than to dye here in wyldernes / And moses said to the people Be
ye not aferd / stand and see ye the great wondres that our lord shall do for
you / this day / Thegypcie^s that ye now see / ye shall never see the^ after
this day / God shall fight for you / and be ye stylle / Our lord said then to
moses / what cryest thou to me / say to ye children of Israhel that they goo
forth / take thou and reyse the rod and stratche thy hand upon the sea and
depart it / that the children of Israhel may goo dry through the myddle of it
/ I shall so indurate the heart of pharao / that he shall follow you and all
thegypciens / and I shall be gloryfyed in pharao and in all his host his
carts and horsemen And thegypciens shall know that I am lord when I shall so be
gloryfyed / The Angel of god went to fore the castellis of Israhel / and
another came after in the cloud / which stood between them of egypt and the
children of Israhel / And the cloud was derke that ye host of pharao might
not come to them of all the night / Then Moses stratched his hond upon the sea and there came a wind blowyng in such wise that it wax dry / And the
children of Israhel went in through the mids of the reed see all dry foot /
For the waters stood up as a wall on the right side and on the lift side /
Thegypciens then poursyewyng the^ followed and entryd after them and all the
carts chares and horsemen through the myddle of the sea / And then our lord
beheld that the children of Israhel were passyd over and were on the land on
that other side / Anon turned the water on them / And the wheles on their
carts turned up so down / And drouned all the host of pharao and sancke down
in to the deep of the sea / Then said thegypciens late us flee Israhel / the
lord fightith for them against us / And our lord said to moses stratche out
thyn hand upon the sea and let the water return upon thegypcyens upon their
carres and horsemen / And so Moses stratched out his hand and the sea returned
in to his first place / And then thegypcyens would have fled / but the water
came and ouerflowed them in the myddys of the flood / And it couerid the chares
and horsemen and all thoost of pharao / and there was not one sauyd of them / And
the children of Israhel had passyd through the myddel of the dry see and came a
land /

Thus delyueryd our lord the children of Israhel fro the hond of thegypcyens
and they saw thegypcyens lyeng d^ed upon the brynkes of the sea / All the
people then dred our lord and byleuyd in him / and to Moses his servant /
Then moses and ye children of Israhel song this so^ge to our lord /
Ca^temus dn^o magnificatus est / Late us sing to our lord he is magnefied he
has overthrown the horsemen and carre men in the sea / and marie the suster of
aaron a prophetess took a tympane in her hand de and all the wymen followed
her with tympanes and cords and she went to fore syngyng / Cantemus domino
Then moses brought the children of Israhel fro the sea in to the deserte of
Sur And walked with them iij days and iij nyghtes / and fond no water and came
in to marath and the waters there were so bitter / that they might not drink
thereof / Then the people grutched against Moses saying / what shall we drink /
And he cryde unto our lord / which showed to him a tree which he took and put
in to the water and anon they were turned in to swetnes / There our lord
ordained comandementis and Iugements / And there he tempted him saying / If thou
herest the voys of thy lord god / and that thou do that is rightful to fore
him / and obeyest his comandements / and keep his preceptis / I shall not bring
none of the langours no sorrows upon the / that I did in egypt / I am lord
thy savior / Then the children of Israhel came in to helym / where as were
xij fontaynes of waters / and lxx palm trees / And they abode by tho watres /
Then fro thens went all the multitude of the children of Israhel in to the
deserte of syn which is between helym and Synay / and grutched against Moses
and Aaron in that wilderness and said would god we had duellyd stylle in egypt /
where as we satte and has plente of bread and flesh / why have ye brought us
in to the deserte for to slay all this multitude by hungre / Our lord said
then to moses / I shall Rain bread to you fro heaven / late the people goo out
and gadre every day that I may prove the^ whether they walk in my law or none
/ The sixte day late them gadre doble as much as they gadred in one day of the
other / Then said Moses and Aaron to all the children of Israhel At even ye
shall know that god has brought you fro the land of egypt / and to morn ye
shall see ye glory of our lord / I have well herd your murmour against our lord /
what have ye mused against us / what be we / and yet said moses / Our lord shall
give you at even flesh for to ete / and to morn bread unto your fylle / for
as much as ye have murmured against him / what be we / your murmour is not
against us but against our lord / As Aaron spack to all the company of the
children of Israhel they beheld toward the wyldernes / and our lord spack to
moses in a cloud / and said I have herd the grutchynges of the children of
Israhel / say to them / at eue^ ye shall ete flessh and to morn ye shall be
fyllyd with bread and ye shall know that I am your lord god / And when the even
was come there came so many curlews that it couerid all their lodgyngis / And on
the morn there lay like dew all about in their circuyte / which when they
saw and came for to gadre it was small and white like to Colyandre / And they
wondered on it and said Mauhu / that is as much to say what is this / To whom
moses said / this is the bread that god has sent you to ete / and god
comandeth that every man should gadre as much for every heed as is the mesur of
gomor / And late notyng be left till on the morn / And the syxthe day gadre ye
doble so much that is two mesures of gomor / And keep that one mesure for the
sabate / which god has sanctefyed and comandeth you to halowe it / yet som^e
of them brake gods commandment and gadred more than they ete and kept it till
on the morn / And then it began to putrefye and be full of worms / And that
they kept for the sabate day was good and putrefyed not / / And thus our lord
fed the children of Israhel xl year in deserte / And it was called manna /
moses took one gomor thereof and put it in the tabernacle for to be kept for a
perpetuel memory and remembrance / Then went they forth all the multitude
of the children of Israhel in the deserte of syn in her ma^syons and came in to
Raphydym where as they had no water / then all grutchyng they said to moses
give us water for to drink / To who^ moses answered / what grutche ye against
me why te^pte ye our lord / the people thirsted sore for lack and penurye of
water saying / why have thou brought us out of egipte for to sle us and our
children and beestis / Then moses cryde unto our lord saying /

what shall I do to this people / I trow within a while they shall stone me to
death / Then our lord said to Moses / Goo to fore the people and take with the
the oldreme^ and senyors of Israhel / and take the rod that thou smotest with
the flood in thy hand / and I shall stand to fore upon the stone of Oreb / And
smite thou the stone with the Rod / And the waters shall come out thereof /
that the people may drink / Moses did so to fore the senyors of Israhel / and
called that place / Temptacion / by cause of the grutche of the children of
Israhel and said is god with us or not / Then ca^ Amalech and fought against
the children of Israhel in Raphidim / Moses said then to Iosue / Chese to
the men and goo out and fight against Amalech to morrow I shall stand on the
top of the hylle having the rod of god in my hand / Iosue did as moses
commanded him / and faught against Amalech / Moses Aaron and hur ascended in to
the hylle / when moses held up his hands / Israhel wan and ouercam their
enemies / and when he leyd the^ down then Amalech had the better / The hands
of moses were heavy / Aaron and hur took then a stone and put it under hem /
And they sustained his hands on either side / and so his hands were not weary
unto the going dou^ of the son / and so Iosue made Amalech to flee and his
people by strength of his swerd / Our lord said to moses write this for a
remembrance in a book / and delyure it to the ceris of Iosue / I shall destroy
and put away the memory of Amalech under heaven / Moses then edefied an
altar unto our lord / and called there on the name of our lord / the lord is
mine exultacion saying / for this is the hand only of god / And the battle of
god shall be against Amalech fro generation to generacio^ / when Ietro the pressed
of madyan which was cosyn of Moses herd say what our lord had don to moses
and to the children of Israhel his people / Took sephora the wife of moses and
his ij sons gersam and elyazar / and came with them to him in to deserte / whom
Moses receyuyd with worship and kyssyd him / and when they were to gydre
Moses told him all what our lord had do^ to pharao and to thegypcye^s for
Israhel / and all the labor that they endured and how our lord had delivered
the^ / Ietro was glad for all thise things that god had so sauyd the^ fro the
hands of thegypcie^s / and said / Blessid by the lord that has delivered you
fro the hand of thegypcyens and of pharao / and has sauyd his people / now I
know that he is a great lord above all gods / by cause they did so proudly
against the^ / And Ietro offered sacrefyces and offryngis to our lord / Aaron and
all the senyors of Israhel came and ete with him so fore our lord / the next
day moses satte and Iuged and demed the people fro morning unto euenyng /
which when his cosyn saw / he said to him / what do thou / why sit
thou allone / and all the people ^arye fro the morn til even / to who^ moses
answered / The people come to me demau^dyng sentence and the dome of god / wha^
there is any debate or dyfference emonge the^ they come to me to Judge hem and to
show to them the precepts and ^^wes of god / Then said Ietro thou ^ost not
well ne wisely / For by folly thou consumest thy self and the people with the /
you do above thy might Thou may not allone sustain it / but here me and
do there after / and our lord shall be with the / Be thou unto the people in tho
things that apparteyne to god / yt thou tell to the^ what they should do and
the cerymonyes and ryte to worship god and the way by which they should goo /
and what werk they shall do / Poruyde of all the people wise men and dredyng god
in whom is troth / and them that hate auaryce and couetyse / and ordeyne of
them trybunes and centuriones and denes that may in all times Judge the people /
And if there be of a great charge and weight / late it be referrid to the / And
late them Judge the small things / it shall be the esyer to the to bear the
charge when it is so parted / if thou do so thou shall fulfylle the
commandment of god and sustain his preceptis / And the people shall goo hom to
their places in pe^s which things wha^ Moses had herd and vnderstonden / he
did all that he had cou^ceyllyd him / And chase out ye stre^gest and wysest
people of all Israhel / and ordained the^ princes of the people tribunes
Ce^turiones / quinquagenaries and denes / which at all times should Judge and
deem the people / And all the great and weyghty matters they referryd to him /
demyng and Iugyng the small causes / And then his cosyn departed and went in
to his contre / The third month after the children departed out of egypt
that same day they ca^ in to the wilderness of Synay and there a boute the
regyon of the mount they fyxed their tents / Moses ascended in to the hylle
unto god / God callid him on the hylle and said this shall thou say to the
hows of Jacob and to the children of Israhel / ye your self have seen what I
have don to the egypciens / And how I have born you on the whynges of Egles and
have taken you to me / if ye therefore here my voys and keep my covenant / ye
shall be to me in the regne of preesthod and holy people / these ben the words
that thou shall say to the children of Israhel / Moses came down and gadred
all the most of birth / and expowned in them all the words that our lord had
commanded him / All the people answered / All that ever our lord has said / we
shall do / When Moses had showed to the people the words of our lord / our lord
said to him / Now I shall come to the in a cloud / that the people may here me
spekyng to the / that they believe the ever after / Moses went and told this
to the people / and our lord bade them to sanctefye the people this day and to
morrow / and late them wesshe their clo^hes and be ready the third day / The
third day our lord shall desce^de to fore all the people on the mount of Synay /
And ordeyne to the people the marks and terms in the circuyte and said to them
/ Beware that ye ascend not on the hylle ne towche the ends of it / who
someuer towcheth the hylle shall dye by death / there shall no hand towche him /
but with stones he shall be oppressid and with castyng of them on him he shall be
tolben / whether it be man or be he shall not live / when thou herest the
trompe blown then ascend to the hylle / Moses went down to the people and
sanctefyed and hallowed the^ and when they had wasshen herr clothis he said to
them / Be ye ready at the third day and approach not your wives / when the
third day came and the morning wexed clear they herd thondre and lyghtnyng
and saw a great cloud coure the mou^te / and the cry of the trompe was so
shrylle that the people was sore aferd / when moses had brouht them forth unto
the Rote of the hylle they stood there all the mount of synay smoked for
somoche as our lord descended on it in fire / And the smoke ascended fro the
hylle / as it had be fro a fornays / The mount was terryble and dredeful / and
the soun of the tro^pe grew a lytyl more and continued longer / Moses spack /
And our lord answered him / Our lord descended upon the top of the mount of
synay even on the top of hit / And called Moses to him / which when he come
said to him / Goo down and charge the people yt they come not to the terms of
the hylle for to see the lord / for if they do / much multitude shall perisshe
of them / the preestis that shall come / late them be sanctefyed / lest they be
smeton down / And thou and Aaron shall ascend the hylle / All the people and
priests late them not pass their bounds lest god smite them / Then moses
descended and told to the people all that our lord has said / After this our
lord called Moses / And said I am the lord god that brought you out of egypt
and of thraldom / And gaf him the comandeme^tis first by spekyng and many
cerymonyes as ben rehearsed in the bible / which is not requysyte to be wreton
here / but the ten comandementes every man is bounden to know / And er Moses
received them wreton / he went up in to the mount of Synay and fasted there xl
days and xl nyghtes er he receyuyd them / In which time he commanded him to
make many things / and to ordeyne the laws and cerymonyes which now ben not
had in the new law / and also as doctors say moses learned that time all
thystoryes to fore wreton of the making of heaven and earth of adam / noe /
abraham / ysaac / Jacob / and of Joseph with his brethern / And at last
delyueryd to him two tables of stone both wreton with the hand of god /
which folowen /

Here folowen the ten comandemens of our law /
THe first commandment that god commanded is this Thou shall not worshipe no
strange ne diverse gods that is to seye thou shall worshipe no god but me /
And thou shall not reteyne thyn hope but in me / For who that sets
pryncypally his hope on any creature or faith or believe in any thing more than
in me synneth dedly / And such ben they that worship ydoles / and make their
god of a creature / who someuer so does synneth against this commandment / And
so do they yt ouermoche love their tresours gold or silver or any other
erthely thing that been passing and transytorye or set their heart or hope on
any thing by which they forgete and leave god their creator and maker /
which has lent to them all that they live by / And therefore ought they to
serve him with all their goods / And above all thing to love him and worshipe
him with all their heart with all their soul / and with all their strength /
like as the first commandment enseigneth and techeth us /

The second commandment is this / that thou shall not take the name of god in
vayn / that is to say thou shall notswere by him for nothing / In this
commandment our lord comandeth in the gospel / that thou shall not swear by the
heaven / ne by earth / ne by other crature / But for good cause and rightful a
man may swear without sin / as In Judgment / or in requyryng of truth / or
without Judgment in good and nedful causes / And in none other manner without
reason by the name of our lord and for naught / if he swear false wetyngly / he
is forsworn / And that is against the commandment and synneth dedely / for he
swerith against his conscience / and and that is when he swerith by auys and by
delyberacion / but aman should swear truly and yet not for naught or for any
vayn or ylle thing / ne malycyously / but to swear lightly without hurt or
blame / is venyal sin / But the custom thereof is perylous / and may well
torn to dedly sin / But if he take heed / But he then that swereth horrily
by our lord or by any of his membris or by his saints in despyte / and
blasphemeth in things that been not true / or other wise / he synneth dedely /
he may have no reason whereby he may excuse him And they that most accustom them
in this sin / they sin most etc^ /

The third commandment is / that thou shall have mind and remember that thou
halowe and keep holy thy sabate day or sunday / That is to say / that thou
shall do no work ne operacion on the sunday or holy day / but you shall rest
fro all worldly labor / and entende to prayer and to serve god thy maker /
which restid the.vij^ day of the works that he / made in the vj. days to
fore / In which he made and ordained the world / This comandem^t
acco^plyssheth he yt keeps to his power ye pees of his conscience / for to
serve god more holyly / Then this day that the Jews called sabate / is as
much to say as rest / This comandem^t may noman keep spirituelly / that is
acco^bred in his conscience with dedely sin / Such a conscience can not be
in rest ne in pees as long as he is in such astate / In the stead of the
sabate day which was straightly kept in the old law holy church has
stablysshid the sunday in the new law For our lord aroos fro death to life on
ye sunday / And therefore we ought to keep it holyly and be in rest fro the
works of ye weke to fore / and to cesse of the work of sin / and te^tende
to do ghoostly works / and to follow our lord besechyng him of mercy / and to
tha^cke him for his benefaites / for they that break the sunday and the other
sole^pne festes / that been stablysshed to be hallowed in holy chirhe they sin
dedly / For they do dyrectly against the comandem^t of god aforsaid and holy
church / but if it be for som^e necessite that holy church amytteth and
grau^teth / But they sin much more then ye e^ploye the sondayes and the
festes in sins / in lecherye / in going to tauernes in the seruyse time / in
gloutonye and drynkyng drunk / and in other sins oultrages against god / For
alas for sorrow I trow there is more sin co^mysed on the sunday and holy
days and festes / than in the other work days / For then ben they dronke /
Fight / and slay / and ben not ocupyed virtuously / in gods service as they
ought to do / and as god comandeth us to remember and have in mind to keep
and halowe the holy day / they that so do / sin dedely and observe and keep
not this third commandment / These three comandementes ben wreton in the first
table and apparteynen only to god /

The fourth commandment is / that thou shall honor and worship thy fader
and mother / For thou shall live the longer on therthe / This comandem^t
admonesteth us / that we be well ware to anger fader and mother in any wise / Or
who that curses them / or set hand on them in evil will synneth dedely /
In this commandment is understood thonour that we should do to our goostly
and spirytuel faders / that is to the^ that have the cure of us / to teache and
chastyse us / as ben the prelates of the church / and they that have the
charge and cure of our sowles / and to keep our bodies / And he that will not
obey to him that has the cure over him wha^ he enseigneth and techeth him
good that he is bound to do / he synneth grievously / and is inobedyent which
is dedely sin /

The fyfthe coma^dement is / that thou shall slay noman / This commandment will
that noman shall slay other / for vngeance / ne for his goods / or for any
other evil cause / it is dedely sin / but for to slay malefactors in
executyng of Justice for other good cause / if it be lawful / it may well be
done / In this commandment is defended the sin of wrath and hate / of
Rauncour and of ire / For as the scripture says / who hates his brother is an
homycide / wha^ it is by his will and he sins dedely / And he that bears
anger in his heart long / For such Ire long holden in the heart is Rauncour
and hate which is dedly sin and is against this commandment / And yet synneth
he more that does or pourchaceth shame vylonye or hurt to another wrongfully /
or counseylleth or helps to grieve another for tauenge him But wrath or anger
lightly passed without will to noye or grieve any other / is not dedly sin /

The sixthe comandeme^t is thou shall not do aduoultrye / that is to say thou
shall not have flesshly company with another man's wife In this coma^demne^t
it is forboden and defended all manner sin of the flesh which is called
generally lecherye / which is a right foul sin / and vylaynous / how be it
that there is sum branch of it / that is not dedly sin / As often meuynges
of the flesh that may not be eschewed which men ought to restrain and
refrain as much as they may / And this comes often times by outrageous
drynkyng and etynge / or by evil thought or foul touching / For in such
things may be great peril / And in this commandment is defended all sin
against nature in what manner it be don in his person or other /

The seventh commandment is / that thou shall do no theft / This commandment
forbedeth to take away other me^nes things what someuer they be without reason
against the will of them that owe or make them / in this coma^dement is defended
Rauayne / usure / Robberye and deceyte and begylyng other for to have their
hauoyr or good And he that does against this commandment is bounden to make
restitucion and yield again that he has so gotten or taken / if he know to whom
he ought to render it / And if he know not / he is bounden to give it for
gods sake or do by the counseyl of holy chirch For who reteyneth wrongfully
and without Reason other men's good again their will / synneth dedely / if he
pay not where as he owes if he know where and be in his power and has
whereof / And if he know not / late him do by the counseyl of holy church /
And who so does not so / synneth against this commandment dedely / The viij
commandment is / that thou shall not bear false witness / against thy neighbor
/ in this commandment is forboden / that noman shall lie wetyngly / For who so
lies does against this commandment / And also that he forswere not him in
Judgment ne make no lesynges to noye ne grieve another / ner he ought not to
myssaye ne speak evil of other in entencion tenpayre his good name and fame /
For it is dedly sin / Against this commandment do they that say evil of good
men behind them and bacbyte them / And do this wetyngly by malice which is
called detraction / And also they that accuse sum of their folly / or herkene
by manner of adulacion or flateryng / when they that men speak of / be not
present / they that do thus and say such words / do against this
commandment / for they be all false witnessis /

The nine commandment is / that thou shall not desire the wife of thy neighbor
/ ne shall not coueyte her in thyn heart / that is to say thou shall not
consent to sin with her with thy body / This commandment defends to desire
to have company with all manner wymen out of marriage / And the evil signs that been without forth make men for to draw them to sin / as the evil words of
such matere / or the foul and evil attouchyng / kyssyng / handlynge and such
other / And the dyfference between this commandment and the syxthe aforsaid /
is that the syxthe commandment forbedeth the deed without forth / And this
forbedeth the consentyng within forth / For the consentyng withinforth to have
company with a woman that is not his by marriage / is dedely sin / after the
sentence of the gospel that says / Who that sees a woman and coueyteth her in
his heart / he has now synneth in his heart and dedly / This is to understand
of the consentyng eypresse in his thought /

The tenth comandem^t is / that thou shall not coueyte nothing that is or
longs to thy neighbor / This commandment defends will to have things
that long to other men by evil rayson or wrongfully / In this comandedeme^t
is defended e^uye of other me^nes well of other men's grace or welfare For
such envy comes of evil couetytyse to have such good or such grace or
fortune / as he sees in other / And this couetyse is when the consentyng and
thought be certainly one / then is it dedly sin / And if there be any ylle
mouynges without will and consentyng of damage or hurt of other this is not
dedly sin / if he sin herin it is but venyel sin / these ben ye ten
comdement of our lord or which the iij first belong to god / And the vij
other ben ordained for our neighbors /

Every person that has wit and understanding in him self and age is bound
to know them and tobeye and keep thise ten comandemens aforsaid / or ellis he
synneth dedly /

Thus moses abode in the hill xl days and xl nyghtes And received of Almighty
god the tables with the comandements wreton with the hond of god and also
received and learned many cerymonyes and statutes that god ordained by which
the children of Israhel should be reuled and Iuged by / and whiles that Moses
was thus with our lord on the mount / The children of Israhel saw that he
tarried and descended not and sum of them said that hewas deed or goon away
and would not return again / And som^e said nay but in conclusion they gadred
them to gydre against Aaron and said to him / Make to us sum gods that may
goo to fore us / we know not what is befallen to Moses / Then Aaron said
take the gold that hangs in the eeris of your wives and your children and
bring it to me / The people did as he bad and brought the gold to Aaron /
which he took and molte it / And made thereof a Calf / Then they said these
ben thy gods Israhel that brought the out of the land of Eypte / And the
people made an altar to fore it and made great Joy and myrthe and ete and
drunk and daunced and pleyed to fore the Calf and offrid and made sacrefises
thereto Our lord spack to Moses saying Goo hens and descend down thy people have
sinned whom thou have brought fro the land of egypt / They have sone forsake
and left the way / which thou have showed to them / They have made to them a
Calf blown and have worshyped it and offered sacrefyses thereto saying ^ Thise
be thy gods Israhel that have brought the out of the land of egypt yet said
our lord to Moses I see well that this people is of evil disposicion / Suffer me
that I may wreke my wrath on them and I shall destroy them / I shall make the
governor of great people / Moses then prayed our lord god saying / why art
thou wroth lord against thy people that thou have brought out of the land of
egypt in a great strength and a boystous hand / I beseech the lord late not
thegypcyens say / that their god has locked them out for to slay them in the
montayns I pray the lord that thy wrath may aswage / and be thou pleysid and
benygne upon the wickedness of thy people / Remember Abraham. Ysaac and Jacob thy
servants / to whom thou promysyst and swarest by thy self saying / I shall
multeplye your seed as the sterres of heaven / And the universal land of which
I have spoken I shall give to your seed / And ye shall possede and have it ever /
And with thise words our lord was pleased / that he would do no harm as he had
said unto his people / And moses returned fro the mount beryng two tables of
stone wreton both with the hand of god And the scripture that was in the
tables / were the ten comandementis as fore be wreton / Iosue heering the great
noise of the children of Israhel said to Moses I trow they fight benethe /
which answered and said / it is no cry of exortyng men to fight / ne noise to
compelle men to flee / but I here the voys of syngyng / when he approch^d to
them / he saw the Calf / and the instrumentis of myrthe / and he was so wroth
that he threw down the tables and brake them at foot of the hylle / and ran
and raught down the Calf that they had made and burnt and smote it al to
pouldre / which he cast in to water and gaf it to drink to the children of
Israhel / Then said Moses to Aaron What has this people don to ye that thou
have made to sin grievously / to whom he answered / late not my lord take none
indignacion at me / Thou know well that this people is prone and ready to sin
/ They said to me / Make to us gods that may goo tofore us We know not what
is fallen to this Moses that lad us out of egypt To whom I said / who of you
that has gold give it me / they took and gaf it to me / And I Cast it in to
the fire and thereof came out this Calf / And then said moises / All they that been of goddis part and have not sinned in this Calf late hem Join to me / And
the children of leui Joined to him / and bade each man take a swerd on his side
/ and take vengeance and slay euerych his brother his friend and neygbour /
that have trespaced / And so the children of leui went and slew xxxiijM. of
the children of Israhel / And then said Moses ye have hallowed this day your
hands unto our lord / And ye shall be therefore blessed / The second day moses
spack to the people and said / ye have commysed and don the grettest sin that
may be / I shall ascend unto our lord again / and shall pray him for your sin
/ Then Moses ascended again and receyuyd afterward two tables again / which
our lord had him make / And therein our lord wrote the comandements / And after
our lord commanded him to make an arc and a tabernacle / In which arc was
kept three things

First the Rod with which he did meruaillis / A pot full of manna / and
the.ij. tables with the comandementis / And then after Moses taught hem the
law / how each man should behave him against other / and what he should do / and
what he should not do / And departed them in xij tribus / And commanded that
every man should bring a Rod in to the tabernacle / And Moses wrote each
name on the Rod And Moses shytte fast the tabernacle / And on the morn there
was found one of the rods that burgeyned / bare leuys and fruit / And was of
on almonde tree / that Rod fyl to Aaron / And after this long time the
children desireden to ete flesh and remembrid of the flesh that they ete in
egypt / And grudchyd again Moses / And would have ordained to them a duc for
to have returned in to egypt / Wherefore Moses was so woo that he / desired of
our lord to delyure him fro this life / by cause he saw them so unkind against
god / then god sent to them so great plente of curlews / that two days and
one night they flewe so thycke by the ground that they took get nombre / For
they flewhe but the heyhgt of two cubytes / and they had so many that they
dreyde hem hangyng on their tabernacles and tents / yet were they not content
but ever grutchyng / Wherefore god smote them and took vengeance on hem by a
great plaghe / And many deyde and were buried there / And then fro thens they
went in to Aseroth and dwelled / After this Maria and Aaron brother and suster
of moses began to speak again moses by cause of his wif which was of ethyope
/ and said god has not spoken only by Moses / has he not also spoken to us /
wherefore our lord was wroth / Moses was the humblest and mekest man that was
in all the world / Anon then our lord said to him and to Aaron and to marye
/ Goo ye three only unto the tabernacle / And there our lord said that there was
none like to Moses / to whom he had spoken mouth to mouth and repreuyd aaron
and maria by cause they spack so to Moses / And being wroth departed fro them
/ And anon maria was smeton and made lepre and white like snow / And when
Aaron beheld her and saw her smeton with lepre / he said to moses I beseech
the lord / that thou set not this sin on us which we have commysed folyly
/ And late not this our suster be as a deed woman or as born out of time and
cast away from her mother / behold and see half her flesh is devoured of the
lepre / Then Moses cried unto our lord saying / I beseech the lord that thou
hele her to whom our lord said / if her fader had spytte in her face / should
she not be put to shame and Rebuke vij days / late her depart out of ye
castellis vij days / and after she shall be called in again / So maria was
shytte out of the castellis vij days / and the people remeuyd not fro the place
/ till she was called again / After this our lord commanded Moses to send men
in to the land of canaan / that he should give the^ charge for see and
considere the goodness thereof And that of every trybe / he should send som^e /
Moses did so as our lord had commanded / which went in and brought of the
fruytee with hem and they brought a branch with one clustre of grapes as
much as two me^ might bear between them upon a colestaf / when they had seen
the contre and considered by the space of xl days they returned / and told
the commodytees of the land / but som^e said that the people were strong and
many kings and gyauntes / in such wise that they said it was imprenable / and
that the people were much strenger than they were / wherefore the people anon
were aferde and murmured again moses and would return again in to egypt /
Then Iosue and Chaleph which were two of them that had considered the lord
/ said to the people why grutche ye / and whereof be ye aferd / we have well seen
the country / and it is good to win / the country flows full of milk and
honey / be not rebelle against god he shall give it us / be ye not aferd / Then
all the people cried against hem and when they would have taken stones and stoned
hem our lord in his glory apperyd in a cloud upon the coueryng of the
tabernacle / and said to Moses this people byleueth not the signs and wondres
that I have showed and don to hem / I shall destroy them all by pestylence /
And I shall make the a prince upon people gretter and strenger than this is /
Then prayed Moses to our lord for the people / that he would have pity on them
and not destroy them / but to have mercy on them after the magnytude of his
mercy And our lord at his request forgaf them / Nevertheless our lord said that
all tho men that had seen his mageste and the signs and meruaylles that he
did in Egypt and in deserte and have tempted him ten times and not obeyed
unto his voys shall not see ne come in to the country and land that I have
promised to their faders But Iosue and caleph my servants shall enter in to the
land / And their seed shall possess it / Moses told all this unto the
children And they waylled and sorowed greatly therefore / After this the people
remeuyd fro thens and came in to the deserte of Syn / And there Maria suster of
moses and Aaron deyde and was buried in the same place / Then the people
lacked water and came and grutched against Moses and yet wesshed they had abyden
in Egypt / Then Moses and Aaron entryd in to the tabernacle / and fylle
down to the ground low and prayed unto our lord seyeng / lord god here the
clamor of thy people / And opene to the^ thy tresour a fontayn of living water
/ that they may drink and the murmuracion of them may cesse / Our lord said to
him then / Take the Rod in thy hand / and thou and Aaron thy brother
assemble and gadre the people / And speak ye to the stone And it shall give out
water and when the water comes late all the multitude drink and their
beestis / Moses then took the Rod as our lord badde and gadred all the
people to fore the stone and said to them / here ye rebels and out of believe /
Trow ye not that we may give you watre out of this stone And he left up his
hand and smote twyes the stone / and water came and flowed out in the most
largest wise in such wise that the people and beestis drunk their fylle /
Then said god to Moses and Aaron / by cause ye have not byleuyd me and
sanctefyed my name to fore the children of Israhel and given to me the laud /
but have don this in your name / ye shall not bring this people in to the land
that I shall give to them / And therefore this water was called the water of
contradiction where the children grutched again god / Anon after this by gods
comandem^t Moses took Aaron upon the hylle and despoylled of his vesture and
clothid therewith his sone Eleazar and made him vpperist bishop for his fader
Aaron / And there Aaron deyde in the top of the hylle / And moses descended
with Eleazar / And when all the multitude of people saw that Aaron was deed /
they wept and waylled on him xxx days in every trybe and famylye after this
the people went about the land of Edom and began to wexe weary and grutchyd
against our lord and Moses / and said yet / why have thou led us out of the
land of Egypt for to slay us in this deserte and wilderness / Breed failleth us
/ there is no water And our sowles abhor and loathe this light mete / For
which cause god sent emonge them fyry serpents / which bote and wounded
many of them and slew also / Then they that were hurt came to Moses and
said we have sinned for we have spoken against our lord and the / pray for us
unto god that he deliver fro us thise serpents / Then Moses prayed our lord
for the people / And our lord said to him / Make a serpente of brass and set
it up for a sign / And who someuer be hurt / and looks thereon / and
beholds it / shall live and be hole / Then Moses made a serpente of brass
and set it up for a sign / And when they that were hurt beheld it / were
made hole / After this when Moses had shewid to them all the laws of our lord
and cerymonyes / and had governed them xl year / And that he was an Cxx. year
old / he ascended fro the feldes of Moab upon the montayn of Nebo in to the
top of phasga against Ierico / and there our lord showed to him all the land
of Galaad unto dan / And all the land of promyssyo^ fro that one end to that
other / And then our lord said to him / This is the land that I promised to
Abraham Ysaac and Jacob saying I shall give it to thy seed / Now thou have seen
it with thyn eyes / And shall not enter ne come therein / And there in that
place deyede Moses servant of our lord as god commanded / and was buried in
the vale of the land of Moab against Phogor / And yet never man knew his
sepulcre unto this day / Moses was an honderd and twenty year old when he
deyde / his eyes never di^med ne his teeth were never meuyd / The children of
Irahel wept and morned for him xxx days in the feldes of Moab / Iosue the
sone of Number was replenessyd with the spyrite of wisdom for moses set on him
his hands / And the children obeyed him as our lord had commanded to Moses /
And there was never after a prophet in Israhel like unto Moses / which knew
and spack to god face to face / in all signs and tokenes that god did and
showed by him in the land of egypt to pharao and all his servants /

Here ends the life and thystorye of Moses
After Moses Iosue was duc and ledar of the children of Israhel and brought
them in to the land of beheste / And did many great batayllis for whom god
showed many great meruayllys / and in especyal one that was that the son stood
stylle at his request till he had overcome his enemies by the space of a day /
And our lord when he faught sent down such hayl stones that slew moo of his
enemies with tho stones than with man's hond / Iosue was a noble man and
governed well Israhel / and divided the land unto the xij trybus by lotte / And
when he was Cx. year old he deyde / And diverse dukes after him Iuged and demed
Israhel / of whom ben noble hystoryes as of Iepte / Gedeon / and Sampson /
which I pass over unto thystoryes of the kings / which is read in holy
church fro the first sunday after trynyte sunday unto the first sunday of
August / And in the month of August is read the book of sapience / And in the
month of Septe^bre ben read thystoryes of Job* of Thobye. and of Iudich / And
in Octobre the hystorye of the Machabeis / And in Nouembre the book of Ezechiel
and his visions / And in Decembre the hystorye of Aduent and the book of ysaye
unto crystemasse and after the fest of Epyphanye unto Septuagesme ben red
thepistles of paul / And this is the Rewle of the temporal through the year
etc^ /

The first sunday after Trynyte sunday unto the first sunday of the month of
August^s read the book of kings
THis hystorye makes mention that there was a man named helcana which had two
wives / that one was named Anna / and the name of the second Fenenna / Fenenne
had children / And Anna had none but was bareyn / The good man at such days
as he was bounden went to his cite for to make his sacrefyse and worshipe god
In this time Ophny and Phynees sons of holy the great priest were priests of
our lord / This Helcana gaf to Fenenna at such time as he offered to her sons
and daughters certain parts / and unto Anna he gaf but one part / Fenenne
did much sorrow and repreef to Anna by cause she had no children / and thus
did every year / and provoked her to wrath / but she wept for sorrow and ete
no mete / To whom helcana her husbond said / Anna why wepest thou / and wherefore
etest thou not / why is thyn heart put to afflyction / Am I not better to the
than ten sons / Then anna aroose after she had eten and dronken in Sylo /
and went to pray unto our lord Hely that time satte to fore the posts of the
hows of our lord / And anna besought and prayed our lord making to him a vow if
that she might have a sone / she should offer him to our lord And it was so that
she prayed so hertely in her thought and mind / that her lyppes meuyd not /
wherefore hely bare her an hand that she was drunk / And she said nay / my lord
/ I am a synful woman / I have dronken no wyn ne drink that may cause me to be
dro^ken / but I have made my prayers and cast my soul in the sight of almighty
god / Repute me not as one of the daughters of Belial / For the prayer that I
have made and spoken yet is of the multitude of the heaviness and sorrow of my
heart / Then hely the priest said to her / Goo in pees the god of Israhel
give to the / the peticion of thy heart / For that thou have prayed him and she
said would god that thy hand-seruaunt might find that grace in thy sight / And
so she departed / And on the morn they went home again in to Ramatha / After
this our lord remembryd her And Hlcana knew her / And she conceyuyd and at
time acustomed brought forth and bare a fair sone and named him Samuel for
somoche as she axed him of our lord / wherefore helcana her husbond went and
offered a solompne sacrefyce / and his vow acomplysshyd but Anna ascended not
with him / She said to her husbond that she would not goo / till her child were
wened and taken fro the pappe / And after when samuel was wened and was an
Infaunt / The mother took him and iij caluys and iij mesures of mele and a botel
of wyn and brought him unto the hows of our lord in Syl^ / and sacrefyed that
calf / and offered the child to hely and told to hely that she was the woman
that prayed our lord for that child / And there Anna worshyppid our lord and
thankyd him / And there made this psalm which is one of the canticles /
Exultauit cor meum in domino of exaltatum est cornu meum in deo meo / and so
forth all the remenau^t of that psalm / And then helcana with his wif
returned home to his hows / After this our lord vysyted Anna and she conceyuyd
iij sons and two daughters which she brought forth / And Samuel abode in the
hows of our lord and was mynyster in the sight of hely / But the two sons of
hely Ophny and Phynees / were children of belyal not knowing our lord but did
great sins against the comandementis of god / and our lord sent a prophet to
hely because he corrected not his sons and said he would take thoffice from him
and from his hows / and that there should not be an old man in his hows and
kynrede but should dye er they came to man's estate And that god should reyse a
priest that should be faithful and after his heart / Samuel served and mynystred
our lord in a surplys to fore hely / And on a time as hely lay in his bed /
his eyes were so dymmed that he might not see the lantern of god til it was
quenchyd and put out / Samuel slepte in the temple of our lord where as ye Ark of god was / And our lord called Samuel / which answered / I am ready / and ran
to hely and said I am here ready / thou caldest me / which said / I called the
not my sone / return and sleep / and he returned and slept / And our lord
callid him the second time / and he aroos and went to hely and said lo I am
here / thou calledest me / which answered I callid the not / Go thy way and
sleep / Samuel knew not the calling of our lord yet / ne there was never
reuelacion showed to him to fore / And our lord callid Samuel the third time /
which aroos and ca^ to hely / and said I am here / For thou calledest me /
Then hely understood that our lord had called him and said to Samuel Goo and
sleep / And if thou be callid again / thou shall say / Speak lord for thy
servant / hereth the / Samuel returned and slepte in his place / And our lord
came and callid him Samuel. Samuel. And Samuel said Say lord what it pleseth /
For thy servant hereth / And then our lord said to Samuel / Loo I make my
word to be known in Israhel / that who so hereth his eeris shall ring and
sown thereof In that day I shall reyse again hely all that I have said opon his
hows / I shall begin and accomplyssh hit / I have give him in knowleche that I
shall Judge his house for wyckednes for as much as he knows his sons to do
wickedly and has not corrected them / Therefore I have sworn to the hows of hely
that the wickedness of his hows shall not be made clean with sacrefyses ne yeftes
never / Samuel slepte till on the morn / And then he roos and opend the doors
of the house of our lord in his surplis / And Samuel was aferd to show this
vysyon unto hely / Hely called him and axid what our lord has said to him /
and chargyd him to tell him all / And Samuel told to him all that our lord
has said and hyd nothing from him / And he said / he is our lord / what it
plesith him late him do / Samuel grew and our lord was with him in all his
werkis / And it was known to all Israhel fro dan to bersabee that samuel was
the true prophet of our lord / After this it was so that the philisteis
warryd against the children of Israhel again whom there was a battle and the
children of Israhel overthrown and put to flight wherefore they asse^blyd again
And took with them the Ark of god which Ophny and Phynees sons of hely bare
/ And when they came with a great multitude with the Arc / the philisteis were
aferd / Notwythsto^dyng they faught against them manly and slew xxxM. fotemen of
the children of Israhel and token the ark of god and the two sons of hely
were slain Ophny and phynees / And a man of the tribe of beniamyn Ran for to
tell this unto hely which satte abydyng some tidings of the battle / This
man as soon as he entrid in to the town told how the feld was lost / the people
slain and how the arc was taken / And there was a great sorrow and cry / And
when hely herd this cry and wayllyng / he demanded what this noise was and
mened and wherefore they so sorowed / Then the man hyed and came and told to
hely / Hely was at that tide lxxx xviij year old and his eyes were woxen blind
and might not see / and he said I am he that came fro the battle / And fled
this day fro thoost / To who^ hely said what is there don my sone / he answered
/ The host of Irahel is over thrown and fled to fore the phylisteis / And a
great ruin is made among the people / Thy two sons ben slain / and the ark of god is taken / And when hely herd him name the Ark of god / he fylle down
backward by the door / and brake his neck / and there deyde / he was an old
man and had Iuged Israhel xl year / then the philisteis took ye ark of god
and set it in their temple of dagon / by their god dagon in azote / On the
morn the next day erly when they of azote came in to their temple / they saw
their god dagon lay on the ground to fore the ark of god upon his face / And
the heed and the two hands of dagon were cut of / And there abode no more but
the ^tronke only in the place / And god showed many vengeances to them of the
contre as long as the arc was with hem / For god smote the^ with sekenesses
in their secret parties / And wellis boylled in towns and feldes of that
regyon / and there grew among them so many myes that they suffered great
persecucion and confusyon in that cite / The people seeing this vengeance and
plaghe said late not the arc of the god of Israhel abide longer with us / Fro
his hond is hard on us and on dagon our god / And sent for the great maistres
and governors of the philisteis / and when they were gadred / They said what
shall we do with the arc of the god of Israhel / And they answered late it be
ladde all about the cytees / And so it was / and a great vengeance and death
was had upon all the cytees / And smote every man with plaghe fro the most to
the least in such wise that the nether partee of them putrefyed and roted of
them / And that they made to them setes of furs and skynnes to sytte soft /
and then they sent the ark of god in to Acharon / And when they of Acharon
saw the Arc They cried saying / they have brought the arc of the god of
Israhel to us / for to slay us and our people / They cried that the arc should
be se^te home again For much people were deed by the vengeance that was taken
on them in their secret parties / And a great howlyng and wayllyng was among
them / The Arc was in the regyon of the phylysteis seven months / After this
they cou^ceyllid with their preestis what they should do with the arc / and it
was concluded it should be sent home again but the prestes said if ye send it
home send it not uoyde / but what ye owe / pay for your trespaas and sin /
And then ye shall be heled and cured of your seknessis / And so they ordained
after the nombre of the five prouyncis of the philisteis / Five pieces of gold
/ and five myes of gold / and lad to a wayne and put in it two wild kyen /
which never bear yoke / and leave their calves at home / and take the arc and
set it on the wayn / and also the vessels and pieces of gold that ye have paid
for your trespaas set them at the side of the arc / and late them goo where
they will And thus they sent the ark of god unto the children of Israhel
Samuel then gouernyd Israhel long / and when he was old he set his sons
Iuges on Israhel whose names were Iohel and abya And these two his sons walked
not in his ways / but declyned after couetyse and took yeftes and perverted
Iustyse and dome / Then assemblyd and gadred to gydre all the grettest of
birth of the children of Israhel and came to samuel and said / Loo thou art old
and thy sons walk not in thy weyes / wherefore ordeyne to us a king that may
Judge and reule us / like as all other nations have / This displesid much to
Samuel / when they said Ordeyne on us a king / Then Samuel counseylled on
this matter with our lord / To whom god said / here the voys of the people that
speak to the / They have not cast only the away / but me / that I should not
regne on them / For they do now like as they ever have don since I brought them
out of Egypt unto this day / that is that they have served false gods and
strange / and so do they to the / Notwithstondyng here them and tell to them
to fore / the right of the king / and how he shall oppress them Samuel told
all this to the people that demanded to have a king and said this shall be the
right of a king that shall regne on you / he shall take your sons and make them
his men of war and set them in his carris / and shall make the^ his carters
and ryders of his horse in his chares and carts / And shall ordeyne of them
Trybunes and Ce^turyons / erers and tylyers of his feldes and mowars and repers
of his corn / and he shall make them smythes and Armorers of harnoys and carres
And he shall also take your daughters / and make them his vngue^taryes / and
ready at his will and playsir / he shall also take fro you your feldes and
vyneyerdes / And the best olyues and give them to his servants And he shall
task and dyme your co^n and sheues and the rentes of your vynyerdes he shall
value for to give to his officers and seruauntis / and shall take fro you your
servants both men and wymen / And set them to his werkis / and your asses
and beestis / he also shall take to his labor / your flocks of sheep he shall
task and take the tenthe or what shall plese him / And ye shall be to him thral
and seruau^tis / and ye shall cry then wesshyng to flee fro the face of your
king / and our lord shall not here you ne delyure you / because ye have asked
for you a king / yet for all this the people would not here samuel / but said
give to us a king / For a king shall regne on us / and we shall be / as all
other people been / And our king shall Judge us / and goo before us and he shall
fight our batailles for us / And Samuel herd all this / and counseillid with
our lord / To who^ god commanded to ordeyne to them a king / and so he did /
for he took a man of the trybe of beniamyn whose name was Saul a good man and
chosen / and there was not a better among all the children of Israhel and he
was heyer of stature fro the sholdre upward than any other of all the people /
and samuel enoynted him king upon Israhel / and said to him / Our lord god
has enoynted the upon his heritage and ordained yt a prince / and thou shall
deliver his people fro the hands of his enemies that been in the circuyte and
contrees about / And so departed from him / And samuel after this gadred the
people to gydre and said / our lord says that he has brought you fro the land
of egipte and sauyd you fro the hands of all the kings that were your enemies
and pursyewed you and ye have forsaken our lord god that has only delyuryd you
from all your evil and trybulacions / and have said / Ordeyne upon us a king
/ wherefore now stand euerich in his tribe and we shall lote who shall be our king
and the lotte fylle on the tribe of beniamyn / and in that trybe the lotte
fylle upon saul the sone of Cys / And they souht him and could not find him /
and it was told hem that he was hyd in his house at home / and the people ran
thither and fette him and set him amyddes all the people / And he was heyer
than any of all the people fro the sholdre upward / Then samuel said to the
people / now ye see and behold who^ our lord has chosen / For there is none
like him of all the people / And then all the people cried viuat Rex / live the
king / Samuel wrote the law of the Royame to the people in a book / and put it
to fore our lord / Thus was saul made the first king in Israhel / And anon had
much war / For an all sides m^n warrid on the children of Israhel / and he
defended them / And saul had diverse bataylles and had victory / samuel came on
a time to saul and said god commanded him to fight against Amalech / and that he
should slay and destroy man woman and child Ox cow camel and ass and sheep
and spare nothing Then Saul assemblyd his people and had ijCM footmen and xxM
me^ of the tribe of Judah / and went forth and fought against Amalech and slew
them / sauf he sauyd Agag the king of Amalech alive / and all other he slew
/ but he spared the best flocks of sheep and of other beestis and also good
clothis and wethers and all yt was good he spared / and what someuer was foul
he destroyed / And this was showed to Samuel / by our lord saying / Me
forthynketh that I have ordained saul king upon Israhel / For he has forsaken
me and not fulfilled my comandements / Samuel was sorry here fore / and waylled
all the night / On the morn he roos and came to Saul / and Saul offrid sacrefise
unto our lord of the pyllage that he had taken / And samuel demanded of saul
what noise that was that he herd of sheep and beestis / And he said that they
were of the beestis that the people had brouht fro Amalech to offer unto our
lord / And the residue were slain / They have spared the best and fattest for
to do sacrefyse with unto thy lord god / Then said samuel to saul /
Remembrest thou not that where thou were lest among the trybus of Israhel /
thou were made vpperist / and our lord enoynted the and made the king / And he
said to the goo and slay the sinners of Amalech / and leave none alive man ne
be / why have thou not obeyed the commandment of our lord / And have ron^e
to Roberye / And don evil in the sight of god / And then said Saul to Samuel
I have taken Agag king of Amalech and brought him with me / but I have slain
Amalech / the people have taken of the sheep and beestis of the best for to
offer unto our lord god / And then said Samuel / ^rowest thou that our lord
would Rather have sacrefise and offrynges / then not toleye his comandements /
Better is obedyence than sacrefise / and better it is to take ^^de to do after
thy lord than to offer the fat kedeneys of the weders / For it is a sin to
withstand and to repugne against his lord like the sin of ydolatrye / And by
cause thou have not obeyed our lord / and cast away his word / Our lord has
cast the away / that thou shall not be king Then said saul to samuel I have
sinned for I have not obeyed the word of god and thy words / but have dredde
the people / and obeyed to their request but I pray the to bear my sin and
trespaas / and return with me yt I may worshipe our lord / and samuel answered
I shall not return with the / And so sammuel departed / and yet er he departed
he did do sle Agag the king / And Samuel saw never Saul after unto his death /
Then our lord bad Samuel to goo and enoynte one of ye sons of ysay /
otherwise called Iesse to be king of Israhel / And so he came in to bethleem /
unto Iesse and bad him bring his sons to fore him / This Iesse had viij sons
/ he brought to fore Samuel vij of them / And Samuel said there was not he that
he would have / Then he said that there was no moo sauf one which was youngest
/ and yet a child / and kept sheep in the field / And Samuel said send for him
/ For I shall ete no bread till he come / And so he was sent for and brought /
he was rough and fair of vysage and well favored / And samuel aroos and took an
horn with oil and enoynted him in the myddle of his brethern / And forthwyth
the spyryte of our lord ca^ directly in him that same day and ever after /
Then Samuel departed and came in to Ramatha / and the spyryte of our lord
went away fro saul and an evil spirit often vexid him Then his servants said
to him / Thou aft orte vexid with an evil spirit / it were good to have one
that could harp to be with the wha^ the spirit vexes the / thou shall bear
it the lyghter / And he said to his servants / provide ye to me such one /
and then one said I saw one of ysayes sons pleye on a harp a fair child and
strong wise in his talkyng and our lord is with him / Then Saul sent
messagers to ysaye for david / and ysaye sent david his sone with a present
of bread: wyn and a kydde to saul / and always when the evil spyryte vexid saul
david harped to fore him / and anon he was easyd and the evil spyryte went his
way / After this the philisteis gadred the^ in to great hoostes to make war
against Saul and the children of Israhel And Saul gadred the children of
Israhel to gidre and ca^ again the^ in the vale of therebinthi / The philisteis
stood upon the hille on ye one part and Israhel stood upon the hille on ye
other part / and the valeye was between them And there ca^ out of the host of
the philisteis a great geau^t named golye of Geth / he was vj cubytes hye and a
palm and a helm of brass on his heed / and was cladde in a habergeon / The
weight of of his habergeon was of vM sicles of weight of metal / he had botes
of brass in his carts and his sholdre were couerid with plates of brass /
his glayue was as a great colestaf and there was the ro^ vj sicles of yro^ / and
his squire went to for him and cryde against the^ of Israhel and said that they
should chief a man to fight a synguler batail against golyas / and if he were
ouercome^ / the philisteis should be servants to Israhel / and if he prevail
and overcome his enemy / they of Israhel should serve the phylisteis / and thus
he did cry xl days long saul and the children of Israhel were sore aferd /
david was at this time in bethleem with his fader and kept sheep / and iij of
his brethern were in the host with saul / To whom ysay said / david take this
potage x loves of breed and x cheses / and goo run unto the host to thy
brethern and see how they do and learn how they ben arrayed / david delyueryd
his sheep to one to keep them / and bare thise things unto the host / and
wha^ he came thither he herd a great cry And he demanded after his brethern
And that same time came forth that geaunt Golyas and said as he had done to fore
/ And david herd him speak / All they of Israhel fled for fere of him / And
david demanded what he was / And it was told him that he was comen to destroy
Israhel / and also that what man that might slay him the king should enriche him
with great Rychessis / And shall give to him his daughter / And shall make the
house of his fader without trybute / And david said what is this incircumcised
that has despised the host of the god of Israhel / And what reward shall he
have that shall slay him / and the people said as before is said / And when his
oldest brother herd him speak to the people / he was wroth with him and said /
wherefore art thou comen hither and have left the few sheep in deserte / I
know well thy pride / thou art come^ for to see the bataille / and david said
what have I do / is it not as ye people have said / I dar fight well with this
geaunt / And declyned fro his brother to other of the people / And all this was
showed to saul / and david was brouht to him and said to saul / I thy servant
shall fight against this geau^t if thou wylt / And saul said to him / Thou may
not withstonde this phyliste ne fight against him for thou art but a child /
This geau^t has been a fightar fro his chyldehod / David said to saul / I thy
servant kept my faders sheep / and there came a lion / and a bear / and token
away a weder fro the myddle of my flock / and I pursiewed after and took it
again fro their mouths and they aroose and would have deuouryd me And I caught
them by the Jaws and slew them / I thy servant slew the lion and the bear
Therefore this phyliste incircumcised shall be as one of them I shall now goo and
delyure Israhel fro this oprobrye and shame / how is this phyliste
incircumcised so hardy to curse the host of the living god / And yet said
david / The lord that kept me fro the might of the lion and fro the strength
of the bear / he shall well delyure me fro the power of this pilistee Saul said
then to david / Goo and our lord be with the / saul did do arm him with his
armor and gyrd his swerd about him / And wha^ he was armed / david said I may
not ne can not fight thus / for I am not acustomed ne vsid / and unarmed him /
and took his staff that he had in his hond and chase to him v good round stones
fro the brook and put the^ in his bag / and took a slyng in his hand / and
went forth against the geau^t / and when Golye saw him come he despised him
and said / wenest you thut I am a hou^de that come with thy staf to me / and
he cursid david by his gods / and said to david / Come hither and I shall give
thy flessh to the fowls of heaven and to the beestis of therthe / David said
unto golye / Thou come to me with thy swerd and glayue / and I come to the in
the name of ye lord god of thoost of Israhel which thou have this day despised
/ And that lord shall give the in my h^^de and I shall slay the and smite of thy
heed / And I shall give this day the bodies of the men of war of the
philisteis to the fowls of heaven and to the beestis of therthe / Then Golye
roos and hyed toward david and david on that other side hyed and took a stone
and leyde it in his s^ynge / and threw it at the geaunt / and smote him in the
forhede in such wise that the stone was fyxed there in that he fyl down on his
vysage / thus preuaylled david against the phylistee with his slynge and stone /
and smote him and slew him / And he had no swerd but he went and took golyes
owen swerd and therewith smote of his heed / and then ye phylisteis seeing
this geau^t thus slain fled / and thysrahelytes after followed and slew many
of them / and returned again and came in to the tents pauillo^s and lodgings
of the phylistees and took all the pyllage / david took the heed of Golye and
brought it in to Iherusale^ And his arms he brought in to his tabernacle / And
Abner brought david having the heed of golye in his hand to fore Saul / And
Saul demanded of him of what kynred that he was / and he said that he was sone
of ysay of bethleem / And forthwith that same time Ionathas the sone of Saul
louyd david as his owen soul / Saul then would not give him license to
return to his fader / And Ionathas and he were confederid and swore each of
the^ to be true to other / For Ionathas gaf his cote that he was cladd with all
and all his other garmentis unto his swerd and spear unto david / And david
did all that ever Saul bad him do wisely and prudently / And when he
returned fro the bataylle and Golye was slain / The wymen camen out fro every
town syngyng with choris and tympanes against the coming of Saul with great Joy
and gladness saying / Saul has slain a thousand / And david has slain ten
thousand And this saying dysplesyd much to Saul which said / They have given
to david ten thousand and to me one thousand / What may he more have sauf the
Royame and to be king / For this cause Saul never louyd david after that day /
ne never lokyd on him friendly / but ever sought menes afterward to destroy
david / For he dredde that david should be lord with him / and put him from him
/ And david was wise and kente him well (...) him / And after this he wedded
(...) daughter of saul / and Ionathas made ^^^tymes peace between saul and david
/ yet saul kept no promise / but ever lay in awayte to slay david / and
Ionathas warned david thereof / and david gate him a company of men of war to
the nombre of iiijC / and kept him in the montaynes / And on a time david was
at home with his wif mychol / and Saul sent theder me^ of war to slay him in
his house in the morning / and when mychol herd hereof / she said to david / but
if thou save thy self this night / to mo^ne thou shall dye / and she let him
out by a wyndowe / by which he escaped and saved him self / Mychol took an
image and leyd in his bed / and a Rowhe skin of a ghoot on the heed of the
image and couerd it with clothis / And on the morn Saul sent spies for david /
And it was answered to them that he lay seek in his bed / then after this
sent saul messagers for to see david / and said to them / bring him to me in
his bed that he may be slain / and wha^ the messagers came they fond a
symylacre or an image in his bed / and ghotes skynnes on the heed / Then
said Saul to mychol his daughter / Why have thou mocked me so / and have
suffrid mine enemy to flee / And mychol answered to Saul / and said / He said to
me late me goo or I shall slay the / David went to samuel in Ramatha and told
him all that Saul had don to him / And it was told to saul that David was with
Samuel / and he sent theder messagers to take him / And when they came they
fond hem with the company of prophets / and they satte and prophesied with
them / and he sent moo / And they did also so / And the third time he sent
mo messagers and they also prophesied / And then Saul being wroth asked where
Samuel and david were and went to them and he prophesied when he came also and
took of his clothis / and was naked all that day and night before Samuel /
David then fled from thens and came to Ionathas / and complained to him
saying what have I offended that thy fader secheth to slay me / Ionathas was
sorry therefore / For he louyd well David / After this Saul ever sought for to
slay david And on a time Saul went in to a Cave for to ease him / And david
was within the cave / to whom his sauyer said / Now has god brought thyn
enemy in to thyn hand / now go and slay him / And david said god forbede that
I should leye any hand on him he is enoynted / I shall never hurt ne grieve him
late god do his playsyr / And he went to Saul and cut of a gobet of his
mantel / and kept it / And when Saul was goon out / Sone after issued david
out / and cried to Saul / saying loo Saul god has brought the in my hands / I
might have slain the if I had would / but god forbede that I should leye hand
on the my lord enoynted of god / And what have I offended that thou sechest to
slay me / who art thou said Saul / Art not thou David my sone / Yes said david
/ I am thy servant / And kneled down and worshipped him / Then said Saul / I
have sinned / and wept / and also said / Thou art rightfuller than I am /
Thou have don to me good / And I have don to the euylle / And thou have well
shewde me this day / that god had brought me in to thyn hand and have not
slain me / God reward the for this that thou have don to me Now I know well
that thou shall regne in Israhel / I pray the to be friendly to my seed and
destroy not my hows / and swear and promise me that thou take not away my name
fro the hows of my fader / And David swear and promised to Saul And then Saul
departed and went home / And David and his people went in to surer places /
Anon after this Samuel deyde and was buried in his hows in Ramatha / And all
Israhel bewaylled him greatly / Then there was a rich man in the mount of
Carmel that on a time he share and clypped his sheep to whom david sent
certain me^ / and bad them say that david grette him well / and where as
afortymes his shepherdes kept his sheep in deserte / he never was grievous to
the^ ne they lost not as much as a sheep as long as they were with us / and
that he might ask his servants / for they could tell / and that I would now
in their need send them what it pleased him / Nabal answered to the children of
David / Who is that David /

Trow ye that I shall send the mete that I have made ready for the^ that shere
my sheep / and send it to men that I know not / The men returned and told to
david all that he had said / Then said david to his men late every man take
his swerd and gyrde him with all / And David took his swerd and gyrde him /
And David went and iiijC men followed him / and he ^^fte ijC behind him / One
of the servants of Nabal told to abygayl Nabals wife / how that david had
sent messagers fro the deserte unto his lord / and how wroth and weyward he
was / and also he said that tho men were good enough to hem when they were in
deserte / ne never perisshed be of our as long as they were there / They
were a wall and a shield for us both day and nyht all the time that we kept our
flocks there / wherefore co^sydere what is to be don they purpose to do harm to
him and to his house / For he is the sone of belial in such wise that noman may
speak with him / Then abygail hyed her and took ijC loves of breed / ij
botellee of wyn / v weders sothen / and v mesures of potage / and C bonds of
grapes dreyde / and ijC masses of cariacares / and leyde all this upon asses /
and said to her servants goo ye to fore / and I shall follow after / She told
hereof nothing to her husbond nabal / then she took an ass and rode after /
and wha^ she came to the foot of ye hille / david and his me^ descended to who^
she ran and david said / I have for naught sauyd all the beestis of this nabal
in deserte / and there perisshed nothing of his / that perteyned to him / and
has yielded evil for good / by the living god I shall not leave as much of his
alive as shall piss against a wall / as soon as abigail saw david she
descended fro her ass / and fill down to fore david upon her visage / and
worshipped him on therthe / and fylle dou^ to his feet and said / In me said
she my lord be this wickedness / I beseech that I thyn handmayde may speak to
thyn eeris and that thou will here the words of me thy servant / I pray and
require the my lord late not thy heart be set against this wicked man nabal /
For acordyng to his name he is a fool / And folly is with him / I thyn
handmayde saw not thy children that thou sendest / Now therefore my lord for the
love of god and of thy soul / suffer not thy hond to shede no blood / and I
beseech god that thyn enemies may be like nabal and they that would the harm /
and I beseech the to resseyue this blessyng and present which I thyn
handmayde have brought to the my lord / and give it to thy men that follow the
my lord / Take away the wyckednes fro me thy servant / And I beseech god to
make to the my lord a house of truth / For thou my lord shall fight the
bataillis of our lord god / And late no malice be found in the / never in all
the days of thy life / if ever any man arise against the or would pursiewe or
would hurt the / I beseech god to keep ye / And when our lord god has
acco^plisshid to the my lord all that he has spoken good of the and has
constytued the duke upon Israhel / late this not be in thy thought ne scropule
in thy heart / yt thou sholdest shede blood not gylty / ne be thou not now
auengid / And when our lord god has don well to the my lord have thou
ramembrau^ce on me thy handmayde / and do well to me / And david said to
abygayl / Blessid be god of Israhel that sent the this day to mete me / And
blessed be thy speech / And blessid be thou that have withdrawe^ me fro blood
shedyng and that I auengyd me not on mine enemy with my hand Else by the
living lord god of Israhel if thou had not comen unto me there should not
have blyuen unto nabal to morn in the morning one pyssyng against a wall /
Then david receyuyd all that she brouht and said to her / Goo pesibly in to
thy house / Loo I have herd thy voys / and I have honored thy visage / and so
abygail came unto nabal and david returned in to the place he ca^ fro Nabal made
a great feste in his hows / like the feste of a king / And the heart of Nabal
was Iocunde / he was dronken / And Abygail his wife told to him no word till on
the morn lytyl ne much / On the morn when Nabal had dygestid the wyn / his wife
told him all these words / And his heart was mortefyed within him / and he
was deed like a stone For the tenthe day after our lord smote him / and he
deyde / And when David herd that he was deed he said Blessed be the good lord
that has Iuged the cause of mine obprobrye fro the hand of Nabal / and has
kept me his servant from harm / And our lord has yolden the malice of Nabal
on his owen heed / Then David sent to Abygayl for to have her to his wife /
And she humbled her self and said she his handmayde was ready to wasshe the feet
of his servants / And she aroos and took with her five maidens which went a
foot by her / and she rood upon an ass and followed the messagers and was made
wife to david / and David also took another wife called Achynoem of Iesrahel /
And both two were his wives / After this Saul always sought David for to slay
him / And the people called Zyphei told to Saul that David was hyd in the hille
of Achylle which was on the after part of the wyldernes / And Saul took with
him three thousand chosen men and followed and sought David / David when he herd
of the coming of Saul / went in to the place where as Saul was / And when he
was a sleep / he took one with him and went in to the tente where Saul slepte
and Abner with him and all his people / Then said Abysay to David / God has
put thyn enemy this day in thy hands / Now I shall goo and smite him through
with my spear / and then after that we shall have no need to dread him / And
David said to Abysay / Slay him not who may extend his hand in to the
enoynted king of god and be Innocent / and david said yet more / by ye living
god / but if god smite him / or the days come that he shall deye / or perisshe
in batayl god be mercyful to me as I shall not leye my hond on him that is
enoynted of our lord / Now take the spear that stondeth at his heed and the
cup of watir and late us goo / David took the spear and the cup and
departed thens / and there was not one that saw them ne awaked / For they
slepte all / Then when David was on the hylle fer from hem David cried to
the people and to abner saying / Abner shall not thou answer And abner answered /
who art thou that cryest and wakest the king / And David said to abner / Art
not thou a man / and there is none like the in Israhel / why have not thou
therefore kept thy lord the king / There is one of the people goon in to slay the
king thy lord / by the living lord it is not good that ye do / but ye be
worthy to dye by cause ye have not kept your lord enoynted of our lord / Now
look and see where the kings spear is and the cup of water that stod^ at his
heed / Saul knew the voys of David and said / Is not this thy voys my sone
David / and David said / it is my voys my lord king / For what cause do
thou my lord pursyewe me thy servant / what thing have I don / and what evil
have I co^mysed with my hand / Thou see well I might have slain the if I would
god Judge between the and me / And Saul said / I have sinned / Return my sone
/ I shall never herafter do the harm ne evil / For thy soul is precious in
my sight this day / hit ap^perith Now that I have don folily and am Ignourau^t
in many things / then said david / lo here is the spear of the king / late
a child come fetch it Our lord shall reward to every man after his Justice and
faith / Our lord has this day brought the in to my hands / And yet I would not
leye mine hand on him that is enoynted of our lord / And like as thy soul is
magnyfyed this day in my sight / So be my soul magnefyed in the sight of god /
and deliver me from all anguysse / Saul said then to david Blessed be thou my
sone david / and david went then his way / and Saul returned home again /
and david said in his heart / Sometime it might hap me to fall and come in to
the hands of saul / it is better I flee fro him and save me in the land of
the phylysteis / And went thens with vjC men and came to Achis king of geth
and dwelled there / And when Saul understood that he was with Achis / he cessed
to seche him / And Achis delyueryd to david a town to dwell in named Sychelech
/ After this the philisteis gadred and assembled much people against Israhel /
And Saul assemblid all Israhel and came unto gelboe And when Saul saw all
thoost of the phylysteis / his heart dredde and faynted sore / he cried for to
have cou^seylle of our lord / And our lord answered him not / ne by sweuenes ne
by preestis ne by prophets / Then said Saul to his servants / Fetch to me
a woman having a phiton other wise called a phytonesse or witch / And they
said that there was such a woman in end or / Saul then changed his habyte and
clothyng and did on other clothyng and went and two men with hem and came to
the woman by night / and made her by her craft to reyse Samuel / And Samuel
said to Saul / why have thou put me fro my rest / for to arise / And Saul said
I am coarted thereto / For the phylysteis fight against me / and god is goon fro
me and will not here me neither by prophets ne by sweuenes / And Samuel said
what axest thou of me when god is gone fro the / and goon unto david / God shall
do to the as he has said to the by me / and shall cut thy regne fro thyn
hand / and shall give it to thy neighbor david / For thou have not obeyed his
voys / ne have not don his coma^dement in Amalech / Therefore thou shall lose the
battle and Israhel shall be overthrown / To morrow thou and thy children shall
be with me And our lord shall suffer the chyldreen of Israhel fall in the
hands of the phylysteis / Anon then Saul fylle down to the earth / the worcester /
des of Samuel made him aferde and there was no strenght in him for he had eten
no bread of all that day / he was greatly trobled / Then the phytonesse
desired him to ete / and she slew a paske lamb that she had and dighted and
set it to fore him and breed / and when he had eten he walked with his
servants all that night / And on the morn the philisteis assailled Saul and
them of Israhel and fought a great bataylle / and the men of Israhel fled fro
the face of the philisteis / And many of them were slain in the mou^te of
Gelboe / The philysteis smote in against Saul and his sons / and slew
Ionathas and amynadab and melechesue sons of Saul / And all the burden of
the bataylle was turned on Saul / And the Archers followed him and wounded him
sore / Then said Saul to his squire pluck out thy swerd and slay me / that
these men incircumcised come not and scornyng slay me / And his squire would not
for he was greatly aferd / Then Saul took his swerd and slew him self /
which thing when his squire saw / that is that Saul was deed / he took his
swerd and fylle on hit and was deed with him / Thus was Saul deed and his three
sons and his squire / and all his men that day to gydre /

Then the children of Israhel that were there aboutes and on that other side
of Jordan seeing that the men of Israhel fled / And that Saul and his three
sons were deed left their cytees and fled / The philisteis came and duellyd
there / And the next day the philisteis went for to ryfle and pylle them that
were deed / and they fond Saul and his three sons lyeng in the hylle of Gelboe
/ And they cut of the heed of Saul / And Robbed him of his armours and sent it
in to the land of phylistym all about that it might be showed in the temple of
their ydollis and unto the people / And set up his arms in the temple of
Astaroth and henge his body on the wall of bethsan / And when the men that
dwelled in Iabes saw what the phylisteis had done unto Saul / all the
strongest men of them aroos and went all that night / and took down the
bodies of Saul and of his sons fro the wall of bethsan / and burnt them and
took the bones and buried them in the wood of Iabes / And fasted seven days /

Thus ends the life of Saul which was first king upon Israhel / and for
disobedyence of gods commandment was slain and his heirs never reigned long
after
Here follows how David reigned after Saul / and governed Israhel / shortly
taken out of the bible the most historyal matters and but litil towched
AFter the death of Saul David returned fro the Journey that he had against
Amalech / For whiles David had been out with Achis the king / they of Amalech
had been in Sychelech and taken all that was therein prisoners and robbed and
carried away with hem the two wives of David / and had set fire and burnt the
town / And when David ca^ again home and saw the town burnt he put syewed
after and by the conueyeng of one of them of amalech that was left by the way
seek / for to have his life he brought David upon the host of Amalech where as
they satte and ete and drunk / and David smote on them with his meyne and
slew down all that he fond / and rescowed his wives and all the good that
they had taken and took much more of them / And when he was come to Secelech /
ye third day after there came one from the host of Saul and told to david / how
that Israhel had lost the battle and how they were fled / and how Saul the
king and Ionathas his sone were slain / David said to the young man that brought
these tidings / how know thou that Saul and Ionathas ben deed / and he
answered / it was so by adventure that I came upon the mou^te of Gelboe / And
saul rested upon his spear And the horsemen and chares of the phylisteis
approached to him ward / And he looked byhynde him and saw me / and called me
and said to me who art thou / And I said I am Amalechytes / and than he said
stand upon me and slay me / For I am full of anguysshes / and yet my soul is
in me And I then stondyng on him slew him / knowing well that he might not
live after the ruin / And I took the dyademe from his heed and the armylle fro
his arm / which I have brought hither to the my lord / David took and rent
his vestement / and all the men that were with him and waylled and sorowed
much the death of Saul and Ionathas / and of all the men of Israhel and fasted
that day till even / And David said to the yongma^ Of whens art thou / And he
said / I am the sone of amalechites / And David said to him / why dreddest not
thou to put thy hand forth to slay him that is enoynted of god / David called
one of his men and bad him / to sle him and he smote him and slew him / (...)
said thy blood be on thy heed / Thyn owen mouth has spoken against the saying
I have slain Saul which was king enoynted of our lord / David sorowed and
bewaylled much the death of Saul and of Ionathas / After this David counceylled
with our lord and demanded if he should goo in to one of the cytees of Judah /
And our lord bad him goo / And he asked whyder / And our lord said / in to
ebron / Then david took his two wives / and all the men that were with him
euerich with his household and dwelled in the towns of hebron / and theder came
the men of Judah and enoynted David king to regne upon the trybe of Judah / And
Abner prince of thoost of Saul and other servants of Saul took hisboseth the
sone of Saul / and ladde him about / and made him king over Israhel / exept
the tribe of judah / hisboseth was xl year when he began to regne / And he
reigned two year / The hows of Judah only followed david / After this it happed
that Abner prince of ye host of hisboseth / with certain men went out of the
castellis And Ioab with certain men of David went also out and ran by the
piscene of gabaon / One party was on that one side / And that other on that
other And abner said to Ioab / late our young men pleye and scarmusshe to gydre
/ and Ioab agreed / and there roose xij of beniamyn of the party of hysboseth /
and xij of the children of david / and when they met to gydre each took other
by the heed and roof their swerdes in to each other sides and were all there
slain And there aroose a great battle / And Abner and his felawship were put to
flight by the men of david / And emo^ge all other there was Asahel one of the
brothern of Ioab / and was the swiftest rennar that might be / and pursiewed
abner / and abner looked behind him / And bad him declyne on the right side or
on the lift side / and take one of the young men and his harnoys / and come not
at me Asahel would not leave him / yet abner said to him / Goo fro me and follow
not me lest I be co^pellyd to slay the / and then I may not make my pees with
Ioab thy brother / which would not here Abner / but despised him And Abner
then turned and slew him in the same place / And anon the son went down /
and they withdrewe / there were slain of the children of David xix men / and of
the^ of beniamyn iijClx were slain / And thus there was long stryf and
contencio^ between the hows of david and the house of Isboseth / After this
Abner took a concubyne of Saul and held her wherefore hisboseth repreuyd him of
it / And abner was wroth greatly thereof and ca^ to david and made friendship with
him Ioab was not there when abner made his pees with david / but when he knew
it he came to abner with a fair semblaunt and spack fair to him by dissimylacion
/ and slew him for to avenge the death of asahel his brother / and when david
herd how Ioab had slain abner / he cursed him / and bewaylled greatly the death
of abner and did do burye him honorably and david folowid the bear him self /
And when hisboseth the sone of Saul herd that abner was deed / he was all
abashed and all Israhel sore trobled / there were two pryncee of thieves with
hisboseth named Banaa and Rechab which came on a day in to hisboseth where he
lay and slepte / and there they slew him / and took pryuely his heed and
brought it to david in to hebron / and said lo here is the heed of thyn enemy
Isboseth that sought to sle the / this day god has given to the my lord
vengeance of Saul and of his seed / david answered to them / By the living god
that has delyuerd me fro all anguysshe / him that told me that he had slain
Saul and had thought to have had a reward of me / I did do slay / how much
more ye that be so wicked to slay him that is not gylty in his hows and upon
his bed / shall I not ask his blood of your hondes / and throw you out of
this world / yes certainly / and David commanded to his servants to slay them
/ and so they were slain / and cut of their hands and feet and henge them on
the pyscene in ebron / and took the heed of hysboseth and buried it in the
sepulcre of abner / and then came all the tribus of Israhel to david in ebron
saying / we ben thy mouth and thy flesh / when Saul lived and was king on us
and reigned / thou were coming and going / and by cause god has said thou
shall regne upon my people / and be their governor / therefore we shall obey the
/ And all the senyors of Israhel came and did homage to david in hebron and
enoytend him king over them / David was xxx year old when he began to regne
And he reigned xl year / He reigned in hebron upon Judah vij yer and vj monethis /
And in Iherusalem he reigned xxxiij year upon all Israhel and Judah / David
then made him a dwelling place in the hylle of syon in Iherusalem / And after
this the philisteis made war again him / but he often ouerthrewe hem and slew
many of them / and made them trybutarye to him / And after brought the ark of god in Iherusalem and set it in his hows / After this yet the phylisteis made
war again unto him / and other kings were aydyng and helpyng them against
David whom david overcome and slew and put under / and on a time when Ioab was
out with his men of war lyeng at a syege to fore a cite / david was at home
and walkid in his chamber and as he looked out at a wyndow / he saw a fair
woman wasshe her and bayne her in her chamber which stood against his hows /
and demanded of his servants / who she was / and they said she was vries wife /
he sent for her / and lay by her and gate her with child / and when David
understood that she was with child / he sent lettres to Ioab / and bad him to
send home to him vrye / and Ioab sent vrye to David and david demanded how
the host was rewlid / and after bad him goo home to his hows and wasshe his
feet / and vrye went thens / and the king sent to him his disshe with mete /
vrye would not goo home / but lay to fore the yate of the kings house with
other servants of the kings / and hit was told to the king that vryas went
not home / and then david said to vrye / thou come fro a far way why
ghost not home / and vrye said to david the ark of god / and Israhel and Judah
ben in the pauylions / and my lord Ioab / and the servants of the my lord lie
on the ground and would ye that I should goo to my house and ete and drink and
sleep with my wife / By thy health and by the health of my soul / I shall not
do so / then David said to vrye abide here then this night and to morrow I
shall delyure the vrye abode there that day and the next and david made him ete
to fore him and made him drunk / yet for all that he would not goo home but
lay with the servants of david / Then on the morn david wrote a lettre to
Ioab that he should set vrye in the weykest place of the batayl and where most
Ieopardye was / and that he should be left there that he might be slain / and
vrye bare this lettre to Ioab / and it was so don as David had wreton and vrye
was so slain in the battle / And Ioab sent word to david how they had
foughten / and how vrye was slain and deed when vryes wife herd that her husbond
was deed she morned and waylled him / and after the morning David sent for her
and wedded her / And she bare him a sone / and this that David had commysed in
vrye displeysyd greatly our lord / Then our lord sent Nathan the prophet
unto David / which when he came said to him / There were two men dwelling in a
cite that one Rich and ye other pour / The Rich man had sheep and oxen
right many and ye pour man had but one lytyl sheep which he bought and
nourisshid and grew with his children etyng of hye bread and drynkyng of his
cup and slepte in his bosom / She was to him as a daughter / and on a time
when a certain pilgrim came to the rich man / he sparyng his owen sheep and
oxen to make a feste to the pilgrim that was comen to him / took the only sheep
of the pour man and made mete thereof to his gheest / david was wroth and said
to nathan / by the l^uyng god the man that has so do / is ye child of death
the man that has so do shall yield therefore iiij double / Then said Natha^
to David / thou art the same man that has don this thing This said the lord
god of Israhel / I have enoynted the king upon Israhel / and I have kept the
fro the hand of Saul / and I have given to the an hows to keep in thy household
and wives in thy bosom I have given to the the house of Israhel and the house of
Judah / And if these be small things I shall add and give to the much more and
gretter / why have thou therefore despised the word of god / and have don evil in
the sight of our lord / Thou have slain vrye with a swerd / And his wife have
thou taken unto thy wif / And thou have slain him with the swerd of the sons
of Ammon / Therefore the swerd shall not goo fro thy hows world without end /
For as much as thou have despised and have taken vryes wife unto thy wife / This
said our lord / I shall reyse evil against the / And shall take thy wives in thy
sight and give them to thy neighbor / and shall lie with thy wyuys to fore thyn
eyes / Thou have don it pryuely / but I shall make this to be don and open in
the sight of all Israhel / And then said david to Nathan / peccaui / I have
sinned against our lord / Nathan said / Our lord has taken away thy sin /
thou shall not dye / but for as much as thou have made the enemies to
blaspheme the name of god / Therefore the sone that is born to the shall dye by
death / And nathan returned home to his house / And for this sin david made
this psalm Miserere mei deus / which is a psalm of mercy / For David did
great penance for these sins of aduoultrye and also of homycyde / For as I
ones was by yonde the sea Rydyng in the company of a noble knight named Sir
Ioh^n Capons and was also doctor in both laws / and was born in malyorke and
had been viceroye and governor of Aragon and Catelone / and that time
Cou^ceyllour unto the duc of bourgonye Charloys / It happend we comened of the
hystorye of David / and this said noble man told me that he had read that
david did this penance following for these said sins / that he dalf him in
the ground standing nakyd unto the heed so long that the worms began to crepe
in his flesh / and made a verse of this psalm Miserere / and then came out
/ and when he was hole thereof / he went in again / and stood so again as long
as before is said and made the second verse / and so as many times he was doluen
in the earth as ben verse in the said psalm of Miserere mei deus / and every
time was abydyng therein till he felt the worms crepe in his flesh / This was
a great penance and a token of great repentance / For there ben in the psalm
xx. verses / And xx times he was dolue^ Thus this noble man told me rydyng
between the town of Gaunt in Flaundres and the town of Bruxellis in Braband /
Therefore god took away this sin and forgave it him / but the sone that she
brought forth deyed / and after this bersabee that had been vryes wife conceyuyd
and brought forth another sone named Salomo^ / which was welbyloued of god /
and after David Solomon was king / After this David had much war and
trouble / and anger / in so much that on a time Ammon oldest sone of David
louyd thamar his suster / This thamar was Absalons suster by the mother side /
and Ammon forced and lay by her / and when he had don his pleasir / he hated
her and threw her out of his chamber and she complained her unto Absalon David
knew hereof / and was right sorry for it / but he would not rebuke his sone Ammon
for it / For he louyd him by cause he was his first begoten sone / Absalon
hated Ammon ever after / And when Absalon on a time did do shere his sheep /
he prayed all his brethern to come ete with him / And made hem a feste like a
kings feste / At which feste he did do slay his brother Ammon / And anon it
was told to the king david that Absalon had slain all the kings sons /
wherefore the king was in great heaviness and sorrow / But anon after it was told
him that there was nomo slain but Ammon / And the other sons came home / And
Absalon fledd in to gessur and was there three year / and durst not come home /
And after by the moyen of Ioab he was sent for and came in to Iherusalem / but
yet he might not come in his fader the kings presence / and dwelled there two
year and might not see the king his fader / This Absalon was the fairest man
that ever was / For fro the sole of his foot unto his heed there was not a
spotte / he had so much here on his heed that it greuyd him to bear /
wherefore hit was shorn of ones a year / it weyed two hundred cycles of good
weight / Then when he abode so long that he might not come to his faders
presence / he sent for Ioab to come speak with him / and he would not come / he
sent again for him / and he came not / Then Absalon said to his servants /
know ye Ioabs field that lies by my field / They said ye / Goo ye said he /
And set fire in the barle that is there in and brenne it / And Ioabs
servants came and told to Ioab that Absalo^ had set fire on his corn /
Then Ioab came to Absalon and said why have thou set fire on my corn / And
he said I have sent tweys to the prayeng the to come to me / that I might
sent the to the king / and that thou sholdest say to him / why I came fro
gessur / It had be better to me for to have abyden there / I pray the that I
may come to his presence and see his vysage / And if he remember my wickedness /
late him slay me / Ioab went in to the king and told to him all these words
/ Then was Absalon called and entered in to the king / and he fylle down and
worshipped the king / And the king kyssyd him / Aftir this absalon did do
make for him self Chares and horsemen / and fyfty men to goo before him / And
walked among the tribus of Israhel and grette and salued them / taking them by
the hond and kyssed hem / by which he gate to him the hertes of the people /
and said to his fader that he had auowed to make sacrefise to god in hebron and
his fader gaf him leave / And when he was there he gadred people to him and made
him self king / And did do cry that all men should obey and wait on him as
king of Israhel / when David herd this he was sore abashed and was fayn to
flee out of Iherusalem / And Absalon came with his people and entrid in to
Iherusalem in to his faders hows and lay by his fadres concubynes And after
pursyewid his fader to depose him / and david ordained his people and battle
against him and sent Ioab prince of his host against Absalon / and divided his
host in to three parties and would have goo^ with them / but Ioab counceyllid
that he should not goo to the battle what someuer happid / And then david
badde them to save his sone Absalon / And they went forth and fought / And
Absalo^ with his host was over thrown and put to flight / And as Absalon
fled upon his mule he came under an Ooke and his here flewe about a bowhe of
the tree and held so fast that absalon henge by his here / and the mule ran
forth / there came one to Ioab and told him how that Absalon henge by his here on
a bowhe of an oak And Ioab said why have thou not slain him / The man said god
forbede that I should set ho^de on the kings sone / I herd the king say /
keep my sone Absalon a live and slay him not Then Ioab went and took three
speres and fyxed them in the heart of absalon as he he^ge on the tree / by his
here And yet after this x young men squyes of Ioab ran and slew him then
Ioab tromped and blewe the retrayt / And retained the people that they should not
pursyewe the people fleyng / And they took the body of absalon and cast it in a
great pytte / And leyde on him a great stone / And when david knew that his
sone was slain he made great sorrow and said / O my sone absalon / my sone
Absalon / who shall grant to me that I may dye for the my sone absalon /
Absalon my sone / It was told to Ioab that the king wept and sorowed the death
of his sone Absalon and all their vyctorye was turned in to sorrow and wayllyng
in so much that the people eschewed to enter in to the cite / then Ioab
entrid to the king and said thou have this day discoraged the chere of all
thy servants / by cause they have sauyd thy life and the lives of thy sons
and doughtres of thy wives and of thy cancubynes / thou love them that hate
the / And hate them that love the / And shewyst well this day that thou
settyst lityl by thy dukes and servants / and truly I know now well that if
Absalon had lyu^d and all we thy servants had been slain thou had ben
plesyd / Therefore arise now and come forth and satisfye the people / or ellis I
swear to the by the good lord that there shall not one of thy servants abide
with the till to morrow And that shall be worse to the than all the harms and
euylles that ever yet fylle to the / Then david the king aroos and satte in
the yate / And ano^ it was showed to all the people that the king satte in the
yate / And then all the people came in to fore the king / And they of Israhel
that had been with Absalon fled in to their tabernacles / And after came again
unto david wha^ they knew that Absalon was deed / And after one Siba a cursid
man rebellyd and gadred people against david Against whom Ioab with the host of
David pursyewed and drof him unto a cite / which he byseged / and by the mean
of a woman of the same cite / Sibas heed was smeton of and delyured to Ioab /
over the wall / And so the cite was saved and Ioab plesid / After this david
callid Ioab and bad him nombre the people of Israhel / And so Ioab walked through
all the tribus of Israhel fro dan to bersabee / And over Jordan and all the
contre / And there were founden in Israhel viijCM. strong men that were able to
fight and to draw swerd / And of the tribe of Judah fyfty thousand fyghtyng men
/ And after that the people was nombred / the heart of david was smeton by our
lord and was heavy and said / I have sinned greatly in this deed / but I pray
the lord to take away the wickedness of thy servant for I have don folyly /
David was on the morn erly and the word of our lord came to Gad the prophet
saying that he should goo to David / and bid him (...) one of three thyngis
that he should (...) to him / When god came to david / ^e said that he should c^se
whether he would have vij year hungre / in his land / or three months he should
flee his adversaries and enemies / or to have three days pestylence / Of this
three god bids the chese which thou wylt / Now auyse the and conclude what I
shall answer to our lord / David said to Gad / I am constrained to a great
thing / but it is better for me to put me in ye hands of our lord / for his
mercy is much more than in men / And so he chees pestylence / Then our lord
sent pestylence the time constytute / And there deyed of the people fro dan to
bersabee lxxM. men / And when the angele extended his hond upon Iherusalem for
to destroy it / Our lord was mercyful upon thaffliction and said to the Angele
so smytyng It suffiseth now withdraw thyn hand / David said to our lord when
he saw thangele smytyng the people / I am he that have sinned and don wickedly
/ what have these sheep don / I beseech the that thy hand torn upon me / and
upon the hows of my fader / Then came god to david and bad him make an awter
in the same place where he saw thaungel and bought the place and made the
altar / And offered sacrefises unto our lord / And our lord was mercyful / and
the plaghe cessed in Israhel David was old and feeble / and saw that his death
approached and ordained that his sone Solomon should regne and be king after him
/ how be it that Adonyas his sone took on him to be king during david's life /
For which cause bersabee and Nathan came to david / and to fore them he said
that Solomon should be king / and ordained that he should be set on his mule
by his prophets Nathan / Sadoch the priest and Banayas and brought in to Syon
/ And there sadoch the priest and Nathan the prophet enoynted him in king upon
Israhel / and blewe in a trompe / and said live the king Solomon / And fro
thens they brought him in to Iherusalem and set him upon his faders sete in
his fadres trone / And david worshipped him in his bed / and said / Blessid
be the lord god of Israhel / that has suffered me to see my sone in my trone
and sete / And then Adonyas and all they that were with him were aferd and
dredyng Solomon ran away / and so cessed Adonyas / The days of david approached
fast that he should deye / and did do call Solomon to fore him / and there he
commanded him to keep the coma^dementis of our lord and walk in his ways / and
to observe his cerymonyes his precepts and his Iugementis as it is wreton in
the law of Moses / And said our lord conferme the in thy Regne / And send to
the wysedom to Rewle it well / And when david had thus counceyllyd and commanded
him to do Iustise and keep gods law / he blessid him / and deyde and was
buried with his fadres / This david was an holy man and made the holy psawter /
which is an holy book and is contained therein the old law and new law /
he was a great prophet for he prophesied the coming of christ his Natyuyte his
Passion and resurrection and also his ascencion / and was great with god yet
god would not suffer him to bylde a temple for him / For he had shed man's
blood / but god said to him his sone that should regne after him should be a man
pesyble and he should bylde the temple to god / And when David had reigned xl
year king of Iherusalem over Judah and Israhel he deyed in good mind and was
buried with his faders in the cite of david /

Thus ends the life of David second king of Israhel


After David reigned Solomon his sone / which was in the beginning a good man
and walked in the ways and laws of god / And all ye kings about him made
pees with him / And was king confermed obeyed and pesible in his possession /
And acordyng to his faders comandeme^t did Justice / First on Ioab that had been prince of his faders host by cause he slew two good men by trayson and
gyle / that was Abner the sone of Ner / and Amasa the sone of gether / And Ioab
was aferd and dredde Solomon and fled in to the tabernacle of our lord and
held the end of the altar / And Solomon sent Banayas and s^ewe him there /
and after buried him in his hows in deserte / And after this on a night as he
lay in his bed after that he had sacrefyed to our lord in gabaon our lord
apperid to him in his sleep saying to him / Ask and demand what thou will
that I may give to the / And Solomon said / lord thou have don to my fader
great mercy / by cause he walked in thy ways in truth Justice / and in a
rightful heart / thou have always kept for him thy great mercy / And have
given to him a sone syttyng upon his trone as it is this day / And now lord
thou have made me thy servant to regne for my fader david / I am a lytyl
chyilde and know not my going out and entryng in / And I thy servant am set
in the myddle of the people that thou have chosen / which ben Infynyte and may
not be nombred for multitude / Therefore lord give to me thy servant a heart
docyle and taught in wysdom that may Judge thy people and dyscerne between good
and evil / who may Judge this people / thy people that been here so many / This
requ^^t / and demand plesyd much unto god that Solomon had asked such a
thing / And god said to Solomon / By cause thou have required and axed this /
and have not axed long life / ne Rychesses / ne the sowles of thy enemies / but
have asked sapyence and wys^oom to discern dome and Judgment / I have given to
the after thy desire and request / An^ I have given to the a ^yse her^ (...)
understanding in so much that (...) was never none such to ^ore / ne never
after shall be / And also tho things that thou have not asked I have given also
to the that is to say richesse and glory / that noman shall be like to the
among all the kings that shall be after thy days / if thou walk in my ways
/ and keep my precepts and observe my coma^deme^ts as thy fader walked I shall
make thy days long / After this Solomon awoke / And came to Iherusalem / And
stood to fore the Arc of our lord / and offered sacryfises and victymes unto
our lord and made a great feste unto all his servants and household / Then
came to fore him two common wymen / of which that one said / I beseech the my
lord here me / this woman and I dwelled to gydre in one hows / and I was
delyueryd of a child in my cubycle / and the third day after she bare a child
and was also delyueryd / and we were to gydre and none other in the hows but we
tweyne / it was so that this woman's sone was deed in the night / For she
slepyng ouerlaye and oppressid him / And she aroos in the derkest of the night
pryuyly and took my sone for the side of me thy servant / and laid him by her /
and her sone that was deed she leyde by me / when I aroos in the morning for to
give milk to my sone / it apperid deed / whom I took beholding him dylyge^tly
in the clear light understood well anon that it was not my sone that I had born
/ The other woman answered and said / it was not so as thou say but my sone
lives / and thyn is deed And contrary that other said thou lie my sone
lives and thyn is deed / Thus in this wise they stroof to fore the king
Then the king said / This woman says my sone lives and thyn is deed / And
this answerth nay / but thy sone is deed and mine lives / then the king said
/ Bring to me here a swerd / wha^ they had brouht forth a swerd the king said
/ dyuyde ye said he the living child in two parties / and give that one half to
that one and that other half to that other / Then said the woman that was
mother of the living child to the king For all her membris and bowellis were
meuyd upon her sone / I beseech and pray the my lord king give to her the
child a live and slay him not / and contrary said that other woman / late it
not be given to me ne to the / but late it be divided / The king then
answered and said give the living child to this woman and late it not be slain
/ this is verily the mother / All Israhel herd how wisely ye king had given
this sentence / and dredde him seeing that the wysedom of god was in him in
demyng of rightful domes / After this Solomon sent his messagers to diverse
kings for cedre trees and for werkmen for to make and bylde a temple unto our
lord / salamon was Rich and glorious And all the Royames fro the River of the
ends of the phylisteis unto the end of egypt were acorded with him and offryd
to him yeftes and to serve him all the days of his life / Solomon had daily for
the mete of his houshod xxx mesures named chores of corn and lx of mele / x
fat oxen / and xx oxen of pasture / and hundred wethers without veneson that
was taken as hertes ghotes bubals / and other fleyng fowls and birds / he
obtained all the regyon that was fro tapsa unto gazam / and had pees with all
the kings of all the Royames that were in every part round about him / In
that time Israhel and Judah dwelled without fere and dread euerich under his
vine and fygge tree fro dan unto bersabee / And Salamon had xlM Rackes for the
horses of his carts chares and curres / and xijM for horse to ride on by
which prefectes brought necessary thyngis for the table of king Solomon with
great dylygence in their time / God gaf to Salamom much wysedom and prudence
in his heart like to the grauel that is in the sea side / And the sapyence and
wysedom of Salamon passed and went to fore the sapyence of all them of
thoryent and of egypt And he was wysest of all men and so he was named he
spack three thousand parablis / and five thuosand songs / And dysputed upon
all manner trees and virtue of them fro the cedre that is in libano unto the
ysope that grows on the wall / And discerned the propretees of beestis /
fowls / reptyles / and fysshes / And there came people from all regyons of the
world for to here the wysedom of Salamon / And Salamon sent lettres to hyram
king of Tire for to have his men to cut cedre trees with his seruauntis /
and he would yield to them their hyre and mede / And let him wete how that he
would bylde and edefye a temple to our lord / And hyram sent to him that he
should have all that he desired / And sent to him cedre trees and other wood /
And Salamo^ sent to him corn in great nombre / / And Solomon and hyram
confederyd them to gydre in love and friendship / Salamon chaas out werkmen of
all Israhel the nombre of xxxM men / Of whom he sent to libane xM every
month / and when xM went the other came home / and so two monethis were they
at home / And Adonyras was ouerseer and comandour on them / Salamon had lxxM
men that did nothing but bare stone and mortar and other things to the
edefyeng of the temple and were berars of burdens only / And he had lxxxM of
hewers of stone and masons in the montayn with out the prefectes and masters
which were iijM and iijC that did nothing but comande and ouersee the^ that
wrought Salamon commanded the werkmen to make square stones great and precyouse
for to lay in the foundement / which the masons of Israhel and masons of
hyram hewed / and the carpenters made ready the tymbre / Then began Solomon
the temple to our lord in the fourth year of his regne h^e began to bylde the
temple The house that he bylded had lx cubytes in length and xx cubytes in
bread and xxx in heyght / And the porche to fore the temple was xx cubytes
long after the mesure of the bread of the temple / and had x cubytes of bread
to fore the face of the temple / and for to write the curiosyte and work of
the temple and the necessaryes the tables and cost that was don in gold silver
and laton it passes my conning to express and english them / ye that been
clerkys may see it in the second bo^k of kings and the second book of
paralipomenon / it is wondre to here the costs and expencis that was made in
that temple / but I pass over / it was on making vij year / and his palace was
xiij year er it was fynysshed / he made in the temple an altar of pure gold /
and a table to set on the loves of proposicion / of gold / five candelstiks
of gold on the right side and five on the lift side / and many other things
And took all the vessels of gold and silver that his fader david had sanctefyed
and hallowed and brought hem in the tresory of the hows of our lord / After this
he assemblyd all the noblest and grettest of lurthe of them of Israhel with
the princes of the trybus and dukes of the famylyes for to bring the ark of god fro the cite of david Syon / in to the temple / And the prestes and leuytes
took the Arc and bare it and all the vessels of the sanctuarye that were in
the tabernacle / King Salamon with all the multitude of ye children that were
there went to fore the arc and offered sheep and oxen without extimacion and
nombre / And the priests set the Arc in the hows of our lord in the oracle
of the temple in sancta sanctorum under the wings of cherubyn / In the Arc
was nothing but the two tablys of Moses of stone which Moses had put in /

And then Salamon blessed our lord to fore all the people and thanked him that
he had suffered him to make an house unto his name / and besought our lord that
who someuer prayed our lord for any petycion in that temple / that he of his
mercy would here him and be mercyful to him /

And our lord appeared to him when the edefyce was accomplysshed perfightly and
said to Salamon / I have herd thy prayer and thyn oracion that thou have prayed
to fore me / I have sanctefyed and hallowed this hows that thou have edefyed for
to put my name therein for evermore / and mine eyes and heart shall be thereon all
way / And if thou walk byfor me like as thy fader walked in the symplycyte of
heart and in equity / and wylt do all that I have commanded the and keep my
Iugements and laws / I shall set the trone of thy regne upon Israhel evermore
/ like as I have said to thy fader David saying There shall not bytaken away a
man of thy generation fro the regne and sete of Israhel / if ye auerte and
torn fro me ye and your sons not following ne keeping my comandements and
cerymonyes that I have showed to fore you / but goo and worship strange gods
and honor them / I shall cast away Israhel fro the face of the earth that I
have given to them / And the temple that I have hallowed to my name / I shall
cast it away fro my sight / And it shall be a fable and proverb / and this hows
an example shall be to all people / Every man that shall goo there by shall be
abashed and astonyed and shall say why has god don thus to this land and to
this hows / And they shall answer / For they have forsaken their lord god that
brought their fadres fro the land of egypt / and have followed strange gods
and them adoured and worshipped / and therefore god has brought on them all this
evil / here may every man take ensample how peryllous and dredeful it is to
break the comandements of god / xx year after that Salamon had edefyed the
temple of god and his hows / and fynysshyd it perfyghtly / hyram the king of
tire went for to see towns that Salamon had give to him and they plesyd him
not / hyram had sent to king salamon an hundred and twenty besaunts of gold /
which he had spente on the temple and his hows and on the wall of Iherusalem
and other towns and places that he had made / Salamon was rich and glorious
that the same ran of his sapyence and wysedom / and of his byldyng and
dyspense in his hows through the world in so much that the queen of Saba came
fro fer contreys to see him and to tempte him in demaundes and questyons / And
she came in to Iherusalem with much people and Richessis with camelles charged
with Aromatykes and gold Infynyte / And she came and spack to king Salamon all
that ever she had in her heart / And Salamon taught her in all that ever she
purposed to fore him / She could say nothing but that the king answered to her
/ there was nothing hyd fro him / The queen of Saba then seeing all the
wysedom of Salamon / the hows that he had bylded / and the mete and seruyse of
his table / the habytacles of his servants / the order of the mynystres /
their clothyng and array / his botellers and officers / And the sacrefyses that
he offered in the hows of our lord when she saw all these things she had no
spyrite to answer but she said to king Salamon / The word is true that I
herd in my land of thy words and thy wysedom / And I believed not them that
told it to me / unto the time that I my self come and have seen it with mine
eyes / And I have now well seen and prouyd that the half was not told to me /
Thy sapyence is more and thy werkis also / than the tidings that I herd /
Blessed be thy servants / and blessed ben these that stand always to fore the
and here thy sapyence / and wysedom / And thy lord god be blessed whom thou
have plesid and has set the upon the trone of Israhel / for so much as god
of Israhel loves the and has ordained the a king for to do rightwysnes and
Iustyse / She gaf then to the king an C and xx besau^tes of gold / many
Aromatykes and ge^mes precious / There were never seen to fore so many
aromatykis ne so sweet odours smellyng / as the queen of saba gaf to king
Salamon /

King Salamon gaf to the queen of Saba all that ever she desired and
demanded of him / And after rotorned in to her contre and land / The weight
of pure gold that was offered every year to Salamon / was vj honderd lxvj
talentes of gold / exept that that the marchantes offered and all they that
sold / and all the kings of Arabye and dukes of that land / Salamon made
two C sheldes of the purest gold and set the^ in ye hows of lybane / he made
him also a trone of yuorye which was great and was clad with gold which had vj
grees or stappes which was rychely wrought with two lions of gold holdyng the
sete above / and xij small lions standing upon ye stappes / on euerich tweyne
here and there There was never such a work in no Royame / And all the
vessellis that king Solomon drunk of were of gold / and the Seelyng of the
hows of lybane in which his sheldes of gold were in was of the most pure gold /
Silver was of no prys in the days of king Salamon / For the nauye of the king
/ with the nauye of hyram went in three year ones in to tharse and brouht thens
gold and silver / teeth of Olyphauntes and great rychesses / The king Salamon
was magnefyed above all the kings of the world in Rychessis and wysedom / And
all the world desired to see the chyere and vysage of Salamon and to here his
wysedom that god had given to him / Every man brought to him yeftes / vessellis
of gold and silver / clothes and Armours for war / Aromatikes horse and mules
every year / Salamon gadred to gydre charis and horsemen he had a thousand (...)
four hundred charis and carris / and xij thousand horsemen / And were lodged in
small cytees and towns abowte Iherusalem by the king / There was as great
habu^dance and plente of gold and silver in tho days in Iherusalem as stones /
or sichomours that grow in the field / and horses were brought to him fro
egypt and chao / what shall I aldaye write of the Rychesses glory and
magnyfycence of king Salamon it was so great that it can not be expressyd /
For there was never none like to fore him ne never shall none come after him like
vnt^ him / he made the book of the parables conteynyng xxxj chapytres / the
book of the canticles / the book of ecclesiastes conteynyng xij / chapytres
and the book of sapience co^teynyng xix chapytres / This king Salamon louyd
ouermoche wymen / and specially strange wymen of other sects / as king
pharaos daughter and many other / of the gentyles / of whom god had commanded to
the children of Israhel that they should not have to do with them / ne they
with their doughtres / For god said certainly they should torn your hertes to
serve their gods To such wymen Salamon was coupled with most brennyng love /
he had vijC wives / which were as queen's and iijC concubynes / and these wymen
turned his heart / For when he was old he so doobted and loved hem that they
made him honor their strange gods and worshyppid Astaroth / Chamos and
Moboch / ydollys of Sydone of moabytes and Amonytes / And made to them
tabernacles for to plese his wives and concubynes / wherefore god was wroth with
him / And said to him / By cause thou have not observed my precepts and my
comandementis that I commanded the / I shall cut thy kingdom and deuyde it and
give it to thy servant / but not in thy days I shall not do it for love that I
had to David thy fader / but fro the hand of thy sone I shall cut it but not
all / I shall reserve to him one trybe / for David's love and Iherusalem that I
have chosen / And after this diverse kings becam adversaries to Salamon / and
was never in pees after / It is said but I find it not in the bible / that
Salamon repentyd him much of this sin of ydolatrye / and did much penance
the^for / For he let him be draw through Iherusalem and beat him self with
Rods and scorgys that the blood followed in the sight of all the people / He
reigned upon all Israhel in Iherusalem xl^ year / and deyde and was buried with
his fadres in the cite of David / and Roboas his seen reigned after him /

Thus ends the life of Salamon
Thystorye of Roboas
AFter Solomon reigned his sone Roboas / He came to Sychem and theder came all
the people for to ordeyne him king / Iheroboas and all the multitude of Israhel
spack to Roboas and said / Thy fader set on us an hard yoke and great
Imposicions / Now thou have not so much need / wherefore less it and mynuysshe
it / and ease us of the great and hard burden and we shall serve the / Roboas
answered and said goo ye and come again the third day and ye shall have an
answer / when the people was departed Roboas made a counseyl of the senyors and
old men that had assysted his fader Solomon whylis he (...) and said to them
what say ye / and counseylle me / that I may answer to the people / which
said to Roboas / If thou wylt obey and agree to this people / and agree to
their petycion and speak fair and friendly to them / they shall serve the alleway
/ but Roboas forsook the counseyl of the old men and called the yongmen that
were of his age / and axid of them counseyll / And the young men that had been
norisshyd with him bad him say to the people in this wise / Is not my fyngre
gretter than the back of my fader / If my fader has leyed on you an heavy
burden / I shall add and put more to your burden / my fader beat you with
scorgis / and I shall beat you with scorpions / The third day after Iheroboam
and all the people came to Roboas / to have their answer / And Roboas left the
counseyl of the old men / and said to them like as the young men had
counseylled him / And anon the people of Israhel forsook Roboas / And of xij
trybus / there abode with him no moo but the trybe of Judah and of beniamyn / And
the other ten trybus departed and made Iheroboam their king / and never
returned unto the hows of david after unto this day / And thus for sin of
solomon / And by cause Roboas would not do after the counseyl of the old men /
but was counseylled by young men / the ten tribus of Israhel forsook him / and
departed fro Iherusalem and served Iheroboam and ordained him king upon
Israhel / Anon after this Iheroboas fylle to ydolatrye / and great deuysyon was
ever after between the kings of Judah and the kings of Israhel / And so reigned
diverse kings each after other in Iherusalem / after Roboas / And in Israhel
after Iheroboam / And here I leave all thystorye and make an end of book of
kings for this time etc^ / For ye that list to know how every king reigned
aft^^ other ye may find it in the first chapter of saint Matthew / which is
read on Crystemas day in the morning to fore Te deum / which is the genelagye
of our lady /

Here follows Thystorye of Job red on the first sunday of Septembre
There was a man in the land of hus named Job / And this man was simple:
rightful: and dredyng god / and going from all evil / he had vij sons and
three doughtres / And his possessyon was vij / M / sheep / iijM / camellis / vC
/ yok of oxen / vC / asses and his famylye and household passing much and great
/ he was a great man and rich among all the men of the oryent / And his sons
went daily each to other hows making great festes / euerich as his day came /
and they sent for their three susters for to ete and drink with hem / when
they had thus fested each other often / Job sent to them and blessed and
sanctefyed the^ / and rysynge every day erly / he offered sacrefyses for the^
all / saying / lest my children sin and bless not god in their hertes / And
thus did Job every day / On a day when the sons of god were to fore our
lord / Satan came and was emonge them / to whom our lord said / whens come
thou / which answered / I have goon round about the earth and through walked it
/ Our lord said to him / have thou not consyderyd my servant Job / that there
is none like unto him in the earth / A man simple / rightful / dredyng god and
gooyng from evil / To whom Satan answered / does not Job dread god ydelly / if
so were that thou ouerthrewest him his hows and all his substance round
about / he should sone forsake the / Thou have blessed the works of his hands
/ and his possessyon is encrecyd much in therthe / but stratche out thy hond a
lytyl / and towche all that he has in possessyon / and he shall soon grutche
and not bless the Then said our lord to Satan / loo all that / which he
owes and has in possession I will it be in thy hand and power / but on his
person ne body set not thy hand / Satan departed and went fro the face of
our lord / On a day as his sons and doughtres ete and drunk wyn in the hows
of the oldest brother / there came a messager to Job which said / The oxen erid
in the ploughe / and the ass pastured in the pasture by them / And the men of
Sab^y ran on them and smeten thy servants and slew them with swerd / and I
only escaped for to come and to show it to the / And whiles he spack / there
came an other and said / The fire of god fylle down from heaven / and has
burnt thy sheep and servants and consumed them / and I only escaped for to
come and show it to the / And yet whylys he spack / came another and said the
chaldeys made three hoostes / and have enuayhed thy camels and taken them / and
has slain thy servants with swerd / and I only escaped for to bring the word
/ And yet he spekyng / another entryd in and said Thy sons and doughtres
drynkyng wyn in the hows of thy first begoten sone / suddenly came a vehemente
wind fro the regyon of deserte and smote the iiij corners of the hows / which
falling oppressyd thy children and ben all deed / and I only fled for to
tell to the / Then Job aroos and cut his kote / and did do shave his heed
and falling down to the ground worshipped and adowred god saying / I am come^
out naked fro the womb of my mother And naked shall return again thereto Our
lord has given / and our lord has taken away / as it has plesid our lord so
is it don / The name of our lord be blessed / In all these things Job sinned
not with his lips / ne spack nothing folyly against our lord / but took it all
pacye^tly / After this it was so that on a certain day when the children of
god stood to fore our lord / satan came and stood among them and god said to
him / whens come thou to whom Satan answered / I have gone round the earth
and walked through it / And god said to Satan / have thou not considered my
servant Job / that there is noman like him in therthe / a man simple / ryghtful
dredyng god / and going fro evil / And yet reteynyng his Innocencye / Thou have
meuyd me against him / that I should put him to afflyction without cause / To
whom Satan said / Skin for skin / and all that ever a man has / he shall
give for his soul / Nevertheless stratche thyn hand and towche his mouth and
his flesh / and thou shall see yt he shall not bless the / Then said god to
satan / I will well that his body be in thyn hand / but save his soul and his
life / Then satan departed fro the face of our lord / and smote Job with the
worst botchys and blaynes fro ye plant of his foot unto the top of his heed
/ which was made like a lazar / and was cast out and satte on the dongehyll /
Then came his wif to him and said / yet thou abydest in thy symplenes /
Forsake thy god and bless him no more / And goo deye / Then Job said to her /
Thou have spoken like a folissh woman / if we have receyuyd and taken good
thyngis of the hand of our lord why shall we not sustain and suffer evil
things / In all these things Job sinned not with his lips / Then three men
that were friends of Job heeryng what harm was happed and comen to Job / camen
euerich fro his place / to him / that one was named Eliphas themanytes /
Another Baldad scintes / And the third Sophar naamathites / And when they saw
him fro fer they knew him not / And cryeng they wept they came for to conforte
him and when they considered his myserye they tare their clothis and cast
duste on their heedys / and satte by him seven days and seven nyghtes / and
noman spoke to him a word seeing his sorrow / Then after that Job and they
talked and spoken to gydre of his sorrow and myserye of which saint Gregory
has made a great book called the Morallys of saint Gregory / which is a noble
book and a great werk / but I pass over all tho matters and return unto the
end how god restored Job again to prosperyte / It was so that when these three
friends of Job had been long with Job and had said many things each of them to
Job / and Job again to hem / our lord was wroth with these three men and said to
them ye have not spoken ryghtfully as my servant Job has spoken / Take ye
therefore seven bulls and seven weders / And goo to my servant Job and offer
ye sacrefise for you / Job my servant shall pray for you / I shall receive his
prayer and shall take his vysage / They went forth and did as our lord
commanded them / And our lord beheld the vysage of Job / and saw his penance /
when he prayed for his friends / And our lord added to Job double of all that
Job had possessyd / All his brethern came to him and all his susters and all
they that to fore had known him And ete with him in his hows / and meuyd their
heedys upon him / and conforted him upon all the evil that god had sent to him
/ And each of the^ gaf him a sheep / and a gold ryng for his eere / Our lord
blessed more Job in his last days than he did in the beginning / And he had
then after xiiij thousand sheep / vj thousand camellys / a thousand yok of Ox
ij a thousand asses /

And he had vij sons and three doughtres / And the first daughters name was
diem / the second Cassiam and the third Cornustibu / There were nowher founden
in the world so fair wyme^ as were the daughters of Job / Their fader Job gaf
to them heritage among their brethern / and thus Job by his patience gate so
much love of god that he was restored double of all his lossis / And Job lyuyd
after one hundred and xl year / And saw his sons and the sons of his sons
unto the fourth generation / and deyed an old man and full of days /

Thus ends the storye of Job
Here follows thystorye of tobye which is red the third sunday of Septembre
THobye of the tribe and of ye cite of Neptalym which is in the ouerpartyes of
galylee upon Nas^n after after the way yt ledeth men westward / having on his
lift side the cite of S^pheth / was taken in the days of Salmanasar king of
thassyryens and put in captyuyte / yet he forsook not the way of truth / but
all that he had or could get he departed daily with his brethern of his
kynred which were prisoners with him / And how be it that he was youngest in
all the trybe of Neptalym / yet did he nothing chyldesly / Also when all
other went unto the golden Calves that Iheroboas king of Israhel had made
this thobye only fled the felowships of them all and went to Iherusalem in
to the temple of our lord / And there he adowred and worshypped the lord god of
Israhel / offryng truly his first fruyte^ and tithes / in so much that in the
thy^de year he mynystred unto proselytys / and strangers all the tithe /
such things and other like to these he obseruyd whylis he was a child / And
when he came to age and was a man / he took a wife named Anne of his trybe / and
gate on her a sone namyng after his own name thobye / whom fro his chyldehode
he taught to dread god and absteyne him fro all sin / Then after wha^ he
was brouht by captyuyte with his wife and his sone in to the cite of nynyue with
all his trybe / And when all ete of the metes of the gentyles and paynems /
This thobye kept his soul clean / and was never defowled in the metes of them
/ And by cause he remembryd our lord in all his heart / god gaf him grace to be
in the favor of Salmanasar the king / which yaf to him power to goo where he
would / having lyberte to do what he would / he went then to all them in
captyuyte and gaf to them warnynges of health / wha^ (...) came on a time in
Rages cite of the Jews / he had such yeftys as he had be honored with / of
the king ten besauntes of silver / And when he saw one gabele beyeng nedy
which was of his trybe / he lent him the said weight of silver upon his
oblygacion / long time after this when Salmanasar the king was deed /
Sennacheryb his sone reigned for him / And hated and loved not the children of
Israhel / And Thobye went unto all his kynred and conforted them / and
divided to euerich of them as he might of his facultees and goods / he fed
the hungry / and gaf to the naked clothes / And dylygently he buried the deed
men / and them that were slain / After this when sennacheryb returned fleyng
the plaghe fro the Iewery / that god has sent him for his blasphemye / And he
being wroth slew many of the children of Israhel And thobye always beryed the
bodies of them / which was told to the king / which commanded to slay him /
And took away all his substance / Thobye then with his wife and his sone hyd
him and fled away all naked / For many louyd him well / / After this xlv days
the sons of the king slew the king / And then returned thobye unto his
house and all his facultees and goods were restored to him again /

After this on an hye festful day of our lord / when that thobye had a good
dyne^ in his hows / he said to his sone / Goo and fetch to us so^me of our
trybe dredyng god that they may come and ete with us / And he went forth and
anon he returned tellyng to his fader that one of the children of Israhel was
slain and lay deed in the street / And anon he lepe out of his hows leuyng his
mete and fasting came to the body / took it and bare it in to his hows pryuely /
that he myht secretly berye it when the son went dou^ / And when he had hyd
the corpse he ete his mete with waillyng and dread remembryng that word that
our lord said by amos the prophet / The day of your f^ste shall be turned in
to lamentacion and wayllyng / And wha^ the son was gone down he went and
buried him / All his neighbors repreuyd and chydde him saying / for this
cause thou were commanded to be slain / and uneath thou escapedest the
commandment of death / and yet thou beryest deed men / But thobye more dredyng
god than the king took up the bodies of deed men and hyd them in his hows /
and at mydnyht he buried them / hit happed on a day after this that he was weary
of beryeng deed men came home and leyde him down by a wall / and slepte / And
fro a swalows neste above there fylle down hot donge of them on his eyes / and
he was thereof blind /

This temptacion suffered god to fall to him that it should be example to the^
that shall come after him of his patience / like as it was of holy Job / For fro
his Infancye he dredde ever god and kept his preceptis and was not grutchyng
against god for his blyndnes / but he alode vnmeuable in the dread of god gyuyng
and Rendryng thankyngis to god a^^e the days of his life / For like as Job was
assaylled So was thobye assaylled of his kynnesmen sko^nyng him and saying to
him / where is now thy hope and reward for which thou gave thy almesses and
made sepultures / Thobye blamed them for such words saying to them / In no
wise say ye not so / For we be the sons of holy men / andwe abide that life
that god shall give to them that never shall change their faith fro him anna his
wife went daily to the work of wenyng / and gate by the labor of her hands
their lyuelode as much as she might / whereof on a day she gate a kydde / and
brought it home / when thobye herd the voys of the kyd bletyng he said / See
that it be not stolen yield it again to the ownar / For it is not leeful to us
to ete ne touch any thing that is stolen / To that his wife all angry answered /
Now manyfestely and openly is thyn hope made vain / And thy almesses lost /
And thus with such and like words she chydde him / Then thobye began to
syghe / and began to pray our lord with theris saying / O lord thou art
rightful / And all thy domes ben true / and all thy ways ben mercy truth
and Ryghtwisnes / And now lord remember me / and take thou no vengeance of my
sins ne remember not my trespaces ne the sins of my fadres / For we have
not obeyed thy comandementis / therefore we ben betaken in to dyrepcyon*
captyuyte. death. fables / and in to repreef and shame to all nations in which
thou have dysper^lyd us / And now lord great be thy Iugem^ts For we have not
don according to thy precepts / ne have not walked well to fore the / And now
lord do to me after thy will / and comande my speryte to be receyuyd in pees
/ It is more expedye^t to me to dye / than to live

The same day it happed that Sara daughter of Raguel in the cite of medes / yt
she was rebuked and herd repe^^ of one of the handmaidens of her fader For she
had be yeuen to vij men / And a devil named Asmodeus slew them as soon as they
would have gone to her / therefore the maid repreuyd her saying we shall never see
sone ne daughter of the on the earth / thou slear of thy husbondes / will thou
slay me as thou have slain vij men / with this voys and Rebuke she went up in
the vpperist cubicle of the hows / And three days and three nyghtes she ete not
ne drank not / but was contynuelly in prayers besechyng god for to deliver her
fro this repreef and shame / And on the third day when she had accomplysshed
her prayer / blessyng our lord she said Blessed be thy name god of our fadres /
For when thou art wroth thou shall do mercy / And in a time of trybulacion thou
forgyuest sins to the^ that call to the / unto the lord I convert my vysage
/ And unto the I address mine eyes / I ask and require the that thou assoylle
me fro the bond of the repreef and shame / or certainly upon the earth keep me
/ Thou know well lord that I never desired man / but I have kept clean my
soul from all comcupyscence / I never medlyd me with players / ne never had
part of them that walk in lightness / I consented for to take an husbond with
thy dread / but I never gaf consent to take one with my lust / Or I was
unworthy to them / or happily they were unworthy to me / or happily thou have
co^seruyd and kept me for some other man Thy counseyl is not in man's power
this knows every man that worshippeth the / For the life of him if it be in
probacion shall be crowned / and if it be in trybulacion / it shall be delyuerd /
and if it be in correction / it shall be l^efull to come to mercy / Thou have
none delectacion in our perdicion / For after tempeste thou make
tranquyllyte / And after weeping and shedyng of teeris / thou bryngest in
exultacion and Joy / Thy name god of Israhel be blessed world without end /
In that same time were the prayers of them both herd in the sight of the
glory of the hye god / And the holy angele of god Raphael was sent to hele
them both of whom in one time were the prayers recyted in the sight of our
lord god

Then when Tobie supposed his prayer to be herd that he might deye / he
called to him his sone thobye and said to him / here my sone the words of my
mouth and set them in thy heart as a fundame^te / when god shall take away my
soul / burye my body and thou shall worship thy mother all the days of her
life / Thou owe to remember / what and how many peryllis she has suffered for
the in her womb / when she shall have accomplisshid the time of her life burye
her by me / All the days of thy life have god in thy mind / And beware that
thou never consent to sin / ne to disobeye ne break the comandements of god
/ Of thy substance do alms and torn never thy face fro any pour man / So
do that god torn not his face fro the / as much as thou may / be mercyful
/ if thou have much good give habundantly / if thou have but lytyl / yet
study to give and to depte thereof gladly / Thou makeste to the thereof good
tresour and mede in the day of necessyte / For alms delyuerith a man fro
all sin and fro death and suffers not his soul to goo in to derknesse /
Alms is a great sykernesse to fore the hye god unto all them that do it /
beware my sone keep the fro all fornycacion / And suffer not thy self sauf
with thy wife / to know that sin / And suffer never pride to have domynacio^
in thy wit ne in thy word / that sin was the begynnyg of all perdicion /
who someuer work to the any thing / anon yield to him his mede and hyre /
late never the hyre of thy servant ne mede of thy mercenarye remain in no
wise with the / That you hate to be don to the of other / s^e that thou never
do to an other / ete thy bread with the hungry and nedy / And cover the naked
with thy clothis / Ordeyne thy bread and wyn upon the sepulture of a
rightwysman / but ete it not ne drink it not with sinners / Ask and demand
counseyl of a wyseman / Alleway and in every time bless god / and desire of
him that he adresse thy ways / and late all thy counseilles abide in him / I
tell to the my sone / that when thou were a lytyl child I lent to gabele x
besauntes of silver duellyng in Rages the cite of medes upon an oblygacion
which I have by me / And therefore spyre and ask how thou may goo to him /
and thou shall receive of him the said weight of silver / and restore to him
his oblygacion / dread thou not my sone / though we led a pour life we shall
have much good if we dread god and goo fro sin and do well / Then young
thobye answered to his fader / All that thou have commanded to me / I shall do
fader / but how I shall get this money I wot never / he knows not me ne I
know not him / what token shall I give him / and also I know not the way
thither /

Then his fader answered to him and said / I have his oblygacion by me /
which when thou show him anon he shall pay the / But goo now first and
seche for the som^e true man that for his hyre shall goo with the whilis I live
that thou may receive it / Then thobye went forth and fo^de a fair young
man gyrt up and ready for to walk / And not knowing that it was the aungele of
god salewed him and said / Fro whens have we the good young man / and he answered
/ of the children of Israhel / And thobyas said to him / know thou the way
that ledeth one in to the regyon of medes / to whom he answered / I know it well
/ and all the Iorneyes I have often walked and have dwelled with gabele our
brother which dwellyth in Rages the cite of medes which stondeth in the hylle
of Egbathanis / To whom thobye said / I pray the tarry here a while / till I
have told this to my fader / Then thobye went in to his fader and told to
him all these things / whereon his fader meruaylled / and prayde him that he
should bring him in / Then the angel came in and salewed the old thobye and
said / Joy be to the alewaye / And thobye said / what Joy shall be to me that
sytte in derknesses and see not the light of heaven / To whom the yonglyng said
/ be of strong believe / it shall not be long but of god thou shall be cured
and heled / Then said thobye to him / may thou led my sone unto gabele in
Rages cite of medes / and when thou come again I shalrestore to the thy mede
/ And the Angele said I shall led him thither and bring him again to the / To
whom tobye said / I pray the to tell me / of what hows or of what kynred art
thou / To whom Raphael the aungele said / Thou nedest not to ask the kynred of
him that shall goo with thy sone but lest happily I should not delyure him to the
again I am Azarias sone of great ananye / Thobye answered / thou art of a great
kynred / but I pray the be not wroth thaugh I would know thy kynrede / The
aungele said to him / I shall sauely led thy sone theder and saufly bring him
and render him to the again / Thobye then answeryng said well mote ye walk /
and our lord be in your Iourneye / And his aungele felawshype with you / Then
when all was ready yt they should have with hem by the way / young thobye took
leave of his fader and mother / and bad them fare well / when they should depart /
the mother bagan to weep and say thou haste taken away and sent fro us the
staf of our old age / would god that thilke money had never ben for which thou
have sent him / our pouerte suffyseth enough to us / that we might have seen
our sone / Thobye said to her / weep not / our sone shall come saufly again /
And thyn eyes shall see him / I believe that the good aungele of god felawshipeth
with him / and shall dyspose all thing that shall be nedeful to him / and that
he shall return again to us with Joy / with this the mother cessed of her
weeping and was stylle / Then young thobye went forth and an hounde followed
him / And the first mansion that they made was by the River of tygre / And
thobye went out for to wasshe his feet / and there ca^ a great fissh for to
devour him whom thobye feryng cryde out with a great voys / lord he comes on
me and the aungele said to him / Take him by the vynne and draw him to the /
and so he did and drew him out of the water to the dry land / Then said
the angele to him open the fysshe / / and and take to the / the heart the galle
and the mylte / and keep them by the / They be profitable and necessary for
medycynes / And when he had don so he roasted of the fysshe and took it with hem
for to ete by the way / and the remenaunt they salted that it might suffyse
them till they came in to the cite of Rages / Then thobye demanded of the
angele and said / I pray the Azaria brother to tell me whereto these be good
that thou have boden me keep / and the aungele answered and said if thou take a
lytyl of his heart and put it on the coals / the smoke and fume thereof dryueth
away all manner kind of deuylles be it fro man or fro woman in such wise that
he shall no more come to them / And thobye said / where will thou that we shall
abide / and he answered and said / herby is a man named Raguel a man nyghe to
thy kynrede and trybe / And he has a a daughter named Sara / And he has
neither sone ne daughter more than her Thou shall owe all his substance / for
the behooves to take her to thy wife / therefore ask thou her of her fader / And
he shall give her to the for to be thy wife / Then thobye answered and said / I
have herd say that she has be given to vij men / and they ben deed / and I
have herd that a devil sleeth the^ I dread therefore that it might hap so to me
/ And I that am an only sone to my fader and mother / I should depose their old
age with heaviness and sorrow to hell / Then Raphael thaungele said to him /
here me and I shall show to the wherewith thou may prevail against that devil
/ These that took their wedlok in such wise that they exclude god fro them and
their mind / and wait but to their lust as an horse and mule in whom is none
understanding / the devil has power upon them / Thou therefore when thou shall
take a wife / And entrest in to her cubycle / be thou contynent by the space of
three days fro her and thou shall do nothing but be in prayers with her / And
that same night put the heart of the fysshe on the fire / and that shall put
away the devil / The second night thou shall be admytted in copulacion of holy
patryarkes / The iij night ye shall follow the blessyng that sons may be
begoten of you both / and after the third night thou shall take the vyrgyne
with dread of god more for love of procreacion of children than for lust of
thy body that thou may follow the blessyng of Abraham in his seed / Then
they went and entryd in to Raguels hows / And Raguel receyuyd them Ioyously /
And Raguel beholding well thobye said to anna his wife / how like is this young
man unto my cosyn /

And when he had so said he asked them / whens be ye young men my brethern / And
they said of the trybe of neptalym of the captyuyte of nynyue / Raguel said to
them / know ye thobye my brother / which said we know him well / when Raguel
had spoken much good of him / Thaungele said to Raguel / Thobye of whom thou
demaundest is fader of this young man And then went Raguel and with weeping
eyes kyssed him / and weeping upon his neck said / the blessyng of god be to
the my sone for thou art sone of a blessed and good man / And Anna his wife and
Sara his daughter wept also / After they had spoken / Raguel commanded to slay
a weder and make ready a feste / when he then should bydde them sytte down to
dinner / Thobye said / I shall not ete here this day ne drink / but if thou
first grant to me my petycion / and promise to me to give me Sara thy
daughter / which when Raguel herd he was astonyed and abusshid / knowing what
had fallen to vij men that to fore had wedded her / And dredde lest it might
happen to this young man in like wise / And when he held his pees and would give
him none answer / the Angele said to him / Be not aferde to give thy daughter
to this man dredyng god / for to him thy daughter is ordained to be his wife /
Therefore none other may have her / Then said Raguel I doubt not god has
admytted my prayers and teres in his syghte / And I believe that therefore he has
made you to come to me that these may be Joined in one kynrede after the law
of moses / And now have no doubt / but I shall give her to the And he taking
the right hand of his daughter / delyueryd it to Thobye seyeng / God of
Abraham / god of ysaac / and god of Jacob be with you / and he conioyne you to
gydre / and fulfill his blessyng in you / And took a chartre and wrote the
conscryption of the wedlok / And after this they ete blessyng our lord god /
Raguel called to him anne his wife / and bad her to make ready another cubycle /
And she brought Sara her daughter therein / and she wept / to whom her mother
said / Be thou strong of h^rte my daughter / our lord of heaven give to the
Joy for the h^uynes that thou have suffered / After they had souped they lad
the young man to her / Thobye remembryd the words of thaungele and took out of
his bag part of the heart of the fysshe and leyde on brennyng ^oles / Then
Raphael thangel took the devil and bond him in the vpperyst deserte of egypt
/ Then thobye exhorted the vyrgyne and said to her Arise Sara and late us
pray to god this day / and to morrow and aftee to morrow / For these three
nyghtis we be Joined to god / And after the third night we shall be in our
wedlok / we ben sothly the children of saynctes / and we may not so Join to
gydre as people do that know not god / Then they both arysynge prayde to
gydre Insta^tly that health might be given to them / Thobye said / lord god of
our fadres heaven and earth See / wells / and floodes and all creatures / that been in them bless the / Thou made adam of the slyme of therthe / and gauyst
to him for an help Eve / And now lord thou know that for the cause of
lecherye I take not my suster to wife / but only for the love of posteryte and
procreacion of children / in which thy name be blessed world without end /
Then said Sara / Have mercy on us lord have mercy / And late us wexe old
both to gydre in health / and after this the cokkes began to crow at which
time Raguel commanded his servants to come to him / And they to gydre went
for to make and delue a sepulcre / he said / lest happily it happen to him at
it has happed to the vij men / that wedded her / when they had made ready the
fosse and pytte / Raguel returned to his wife / and said to her / Send one of
thyn handmaydens and late her see if he (...) deed / that he may be beryed er
it be light day / And she sent forth one of her servants / which entryd in
to the cubycle / and fond the^ both sauf and hole / And sle^yng to gydre /
And she returned and brought good tidings / And Raguel and Anna blessed our
lord god and said we bless the lord god of Israhel / that it has not happed
to us / as we supposid / Thou have don to us thy mercy / and thou have excluded
fro us our enemy poursyewyng us / Thou have don mercy on two only children /
Make them lord to bless the to fulle and to offer do the / sacrefyse of
praysyng and of their health that the university of peples may know that thou
art god only in the universal earth / Anon then Raguel coma^ded his
servants to fylle ag^yn the pytte that they had made / er it wexid light /
And bad his wife to ordeyne a feste / and make all ready that we^e necessary to
mete / he did do s^^e ij fat kyen and four weders / and to ordeyne mete
for all his neighbors and frendys / And Raguel d^sired and adjured thobie /
that he should abide with him two wekys / Of all that ever Raguel had in
possessyon of goodys he gaf half part to thobye / And made to him a writing /
that ye (...) half p^rte he should have after the death of him / and his wife
Then thobye called thangele to him / which he trowed had been a man / And
said to him / Azaria brother I pray the to take heed to my words / if I make
my self servant to the / I shall not be worthy to satysfye thy prouydence /
Nevertheless / I pray the to take to the the bestes and servants and goo to
gabele in Rages the cite of medes / and render to him his oblygacio^ and
receive of them the money and pray him to come to my wedding / thou know
thy self that my fader nombreth the days of my being out / And if I tarry
more / his soul shall be heavy and certainly thou see how Raguel has adjured
me / whose desire I may not despise / Then Raphael taking four of the
seruauntis of Raguel and two camels and went to Rages the cite of medes / And
there fyndyng gabele gaf to him his oblygacion / and receyuyd all the money
And told to him of thobye sone of thobye all that was don / and made him come
with him to the weddyng / when then he entered the hows of raguel / he fond
thobye syttyng at mete and came to him and kyssed him / And gabele wept / and
blessed god saying / God of Israhel bless the for thou art sone of the best
man and Just dredyng god and doing alms / and the blessyng be said upon thy
wife and your parentis / and that ye may see the sons of your sons unto the
third and fourth generation / and your seed be blessed of god of Israhel
which regneth in secula seculorum / And when all had said Amen / they went
to the feste / And with the dread of god they excersised the feste of their
weddynges whiles that thobye tarried by cause of his marriage / his fader thobye
began to be heavy saying / Trowest wherefore my sone tarieth / and why he is
holden there Trowest thou that gabele be deed / and noman is there that shall
give him his money / he began to be sorry and heavy greatly both he and Anna his
wife with him and began both to weep by cause at the day set he came not home
/ his mother therefore wept with unmeasurable teeris and said Alas my sone
wherefore sent we the to goo this pylgremage / the light of our eyes / the staf
of our age / the solace of our life / the hope of our posteryte / all these only
having in the / we ought not to have laten the goo fro us / To whom thobye said
/ Be stylle / and troble the not / our sone is sauf enough / the man is true
and faithful enough with whom we sent him / She might in no wise be conforted
/ but every day she went and looked and espied the way that he should come if
she might see him come fro far / Then Raguel said to thobye his sone in
law / Abide here with me / and I shall send messagers of thy health and
welfare to thobye thy fader / To whom thobias said / I know well that my fader
and my mother acompte the days / and the spyrite is in great pain within them
/ Raguel prayed him with many words / but thobye would in no wise grant him /
then he delyueryd to him Sara his daughter / and half part of all his
substance in seruau^tis men and wymen in beestis camellis in kyen and much
money / And sauf and Ioyeful he let him depart fro him saying / Thangel of
god that is holy be in your Journey / and bring you home hool and sound and
that ye may find all thing weel and ryghtful about your fader and mother /
And yt mine eyes may see your sons er I deye And the fader and mother taking
their daughter kyssyd her and let her depart warnyng her to worshipe her
husbondes fader and mother / love her husbond to rewle well the meyne / to
govern the hows and to keep her self irreprehensyble / that is to say without
repreef / when they thus returned and departed they came to charram which is
the half way to nynyue the thertenst day / Then said the Angele to thobye /
Thobye brother / thou know how thou have left thy fader / if it plese the
we will go to fore / And late thy famylye come softly after with thy wif / and
with thy bestes / This plesed well to thobye / and then said Raphael to thobye
/ Take with the of ye galle of the fysshe / it shall be necessary / Thobye took
of the galle and went forth to fore / anna his mother satte every day by the
way in the top of the hylle / fro whens she might see him come fro far /
and whylis she satte there and looked after his coming she saw a far / and
knew her sone coming / And rennyng home she told to her husbonde saying / loo
thy sone comes / Raphael then said to young thobye / Anon as thou entrest in
to the hows adowre thy lord god / and gyuyng to him tha^kyngis goo to thy fader
and kiss him / And anon then enoynte his eyes with the galle of the fysshe
/ that you berest with the / thou shall well know that his eyes shall be opened /
and thy fader shall see the light of heaven / and shall Joy in thy sight / Then
ran the dog that followed him and had been with him in the way and came home
as a messager fawnyng and making Joy with his tayll / And the blind fader
aroos and began offendyng his feet to run to mete his sone gyuyng to him his
hand / And so taking kyssed him with his wife and began to weep for Joy when
than they had worshyped god and thanked him they satte down to gydre / Then
thobye taking the galle of ye fysshe enoynted his faders eyes / and abode as it
had be half an hour / And the slyme of his eyes began to fall away like as it
had be the white of an egg which thobye took and drew fro his fadres eyes /
and anon he receyuyd sight / And they gloryfyed god / that is to wete he and
his wife and all they that knew him / Then said thobye the fader / I bless
the lord god of Israhel For thou have chastysed me / and thou have saved me /
And loo I see thobye my sone / After this vij days Sara the wife of his sone
came and entryd in with all the famylye / and the beestis hole and sound
camellys and much money of his wyuys / And also the money that he had receyuyd
of gabele / And he told to his fader and mother all the benefetes of god that
was don to him by the man that ladde him then came achior and nabath cosyns of
thobye Ioyeng and thankyng god of all the goods that god had shewde to him /
And vij days they ete to gydre making feste and were glad with great Joy /
Then old thobye called his sone thobye to him and said / what may we give
to this holy man that comes with the / Then thobye answeryng said to his
fader / Fader what mede may we give to him / or what may be worthy to him for
his benefetes / he ladde me out and has brouht me hole again / he receyuyd the
money of gabele / he did me have my wife / and he put away the devil fro her /
he has made Joy to my parentis and saved my self fro deuoryng of the fysshe
and has made the sea the light of heaven And by him we be replenesshyd with all
goods / what may we then worthyly give to him / wherefore I pray the fader
that thou pray him if he vuochesauf to take the half of all that I have /
Then the fader and the sone calling him took him a part / and begone to
pray him that he would vouchesauf to take half the part of all the goods that
they had brought / Then said he to them pryuely / Bless ye god of heaven /
And before all living people knowleche ye him / for he has don to you his
mercy / Forsothe to hyde the sacrament of the king / it is good but for to
show the werkys of god and to knowleche them it is worshypful / Oracion and
prayer is good with fasting and alms / and more than to set up tresours of
gold / For alms delyueryth fro death / and it is she that purges sins /
and makes a man to find everlasting life / who that do sin and wyckednes /
they ben enemies of his soul / I show to you therefore the truth / And I shall
not hyde fro you the secret word / when thou praidest with teres / and dydest
berye the deed men / And leftest thy dinner / and hyddest deed men by day in
thy hows and in the night thou beryedest them / I offered thy prayer unto god /
And for ^s much as thou were accepted to fore god / it was necessary thou
being tempted that he should prove the / And now has our lord sent me for to
cure the / and Sara the wife of thy sone I have delyuerd fro the devil / I am
sothly Raphael the angele / one of the seven which stand to fore our lord god
/ when they herd this / they were (...) / and tremblyng fyl down (...) on their
faces upon the ground / (...) Aungele said to them / pees be to you / dread you
not / Forsothe when I was with you by the will of god him alleway bless ye
and sing ye to him / I was seen to you / to ete and drink / but I use mete
and drink Inuysyble which of men may not be seen / It is now therefore time
that I return to him which has sent me / ye always bless god and tell ye
all his meruaylles / And when he had said this / he was taken away fro the
sight of them / and after that they might no more see him Then they fyl down
flat on their faces by the space of iij hours / and blessed god / And
arisyng up they told all the meruaylles of him / Then tholder thobye openyng
his mouth blessed our lord and said / Great art thou lord evermore / and thy
regne is in to all worlds / For you scorgest and sauyst / thou ledyst to hell
and bryngest again / And there is none that may flee thy hand / knowleche and
confess you to the lord ye children of Israhel / And in the sight of gentylis
preyse ye him / therefore he has desperpled you among gentyles / that know him
not / that ye tell his meruaylles / and make them to be known For there is
none other god almighty but he / he has chastysed us for our wyckednesses /
and he shall save us for his mercy / Take heed and see therefore what he has don
to us / And with fere and dread knowleche ye to him / / and exalte him king of
all worldys in your werkys / I sothly in the land of my captyuyte shall

Confess you therefore sinners / and do ye Justice to for our lord byleuyng that
he shall do to you his mercy / I sothly and my soul shall be glad in him / All
ye chosen of god bless ye him / and make ye days of gladness and knowleche ye
to him Iherusalem cite of god / our lord has chastysed the in the werkys of
his hondys / Confess thou to our lord in his good thyngys / and bless thou
god of worlds / that he may reedyfye in the his tabernacle / and that he may
call again to the all prisoners / and them that been in captyuyte and that

And all the ends of the earth shall worshipe the / Nations shall come to the fro
far / and bryngyng yeftes shall worshype in the our lord / and shall have thy
land in to sanctificacion / They shall call in the a great name / They shall be
cursed that shall despise the / And they all shall be condemned that blaspheme
the / Blessed be they that edefye the / thou shall be Ioyeful in thy sons /
For all shall be blessed and shall be gadred to gydre / unto our lord / Blessed
be they that love the and that Joy upon thy pees / my soul bless thou our
lord / for he has delyueryd Iherusalem his cite / I shall be blessed if there be
left of my seed for to see the clerenesse of Iherusalem / The yates of
Iherusalem shall be edefyed of Saphir and emerawde / And all the circuyte of his
walls of precious stone / all the streets thereof shall be paued with white
stone and clean / And Alleluya shall be song by the ways thereof / Blessed be
the lord that has exalted it / that it may be his kingdom in secula seculorum
Amen / And thus thobye fynysshed these words / And thobye lyuyd after he had
receyuyd his sight xlij xere / and saw the sons of his neuewis / that is the
sons of the sons of his sone young thobye / And when he had lyuyd Cij year he
deyde and was honorably buried in the cite of nynyue / he was lvj year old when
he lost his sight and when he was lx year old he receyuyd his sight again / The
resydue of his life was in Joy / and with good profyght of the dread of god he
departed in pees / In the hour of his death he called to him thobye his sone /
and vij of his young sons his neuewes / and said to hem / the destruction of
Nynyue is nygh / The word of god shall not pass / And our brethern that been
desperpled fro the land of Israhel / shall return theder again / All the land
thereof shall be fulfyllid with deserte / and the hows that is burnt therein shall
be reedefyed / and theder shall return all people dredyng god / And gentylis
shall leave their ydolles / and shall come in Iherusalem / and shall dwell therein
/ And all the kings of the earth shall Joy in her worshypyng the king of
Israhel / here ye therefore my sons me your fader / Serve ye god in truth /
and seche ye that ye do that may be plesyng to him / And comande ye to your
sons that they do rightwisnessis and almesses / that they may remember god
and bless him in all time in truth and in all their virtue / Now therefore my
sons here me and dwell ye no lengre here / but wha^ someuer your mother shall
deye berye her by me / And fro than forthon dress ye your stappes that ye goo
hens / I see well that wickedness shall make an end of it / hit was so then
after the death of his mother Thobye went fro Nynyue with his wife and his sons
and the sons of his sons / and returned unto his wives fader and mother whom
they fond in good health and good age / And took the cure and charge of them /
And were with them unto their death and closyd their ey^n / And thobye receyuyd
all therytage of the hows of Raguel and saw the sons of his sons unto the
fyf^he generation And when he had complesshyd lxxxxix year he deyde in the
dread of god / and with Joy they beryed him All his cognacion and all his
generation abode in good life and in holy conversation / in such wise as they
were acceptable as well to god as to men and to all dwelling on the earth /

Thus ends the hystorye of Thobye tholder and of his sone Thobye the younger
Here begins thystorye of Judith which is read the last sunday of Octobre
ARphaxat king of the medes subdued unto his e^pire many peoples / And edefyed
a mighty cite which he named Egbathams and made hit with stones squared and
polysshed them the walls thereof were of heyght lxx cubitis and of bread xxx
cubitis / and the towers thereof were an honderd cubytis hye / And gloryfyed him
self as he that was mighty in puyssance and in the glory of his host and of
his chares / Nabugodonosor then^e in the xij year of his Regne / which was
king of thassyryens and reigned in the cite of Nynyue fought again Arphaxat and
took him in the field / whereof Nabugodonosor was exalted and enhau^sed him self
/ And sent unto all Regyons about / And unto Iherusalem till the mountes of
ethyope for to^eye and hold of him which all gaynsaid him with one will and
without worshype sent home his messagers void and setted naught by him /
Then Nabugodono^or having her at great Indygnacion swore by his regne and by
his trone / that he would aue^ge him on them all / And thereupon called all his
dukes princes and men of war / and held a cou^seyl In which was decreed that
he should subdue all the world unto his empire / And thereupon he ordained
Olyfernes prince of his knyghthode and bad him goo forth and in especial again
them that had despised his empire / And bad him spare no Royame ne town but
subdue all to him / Then Olifernes assemblyd dukes and maistres of the
strength of Nabugodonosor / and no^bred CxxM footmen / And horsemen shoters
xijM And to fore them he commanded to goo a multitude of Innumerable Camellis
laden with such thyngis as were nedeful to the host as vytayll / gold and
silver much that was taken out of the tresorye of the kings / And so went to
many royames / which he subdued and ocupyed a great part of thoryent / till he
came approchyng the land of Israhel / And when the children of Israhel herd
hereof they dread sore lest he should come among them in to Iherusalem / and
destroy the temple / For Nabugodonosor had commanded that he should extyncte
all the gods of the earth / and that no god should be named ne worshipped but
he him self of all the nations that Olifernes should subdue / Eliachym then
priest in I^rahel wrote unto all them in the montayns that they should keep the
strayte ways of the montayns / and so the children of Israhel did as the
priest had ordained / Then Eliachym the priest went about all Israhel and
said to them know ye that god has herd your prayers / if ye abide and
continue in your prayers and fastyngis in the sight of god / Remember ye of
moses the servant of god which ouerthrewe Amalech trustyng in his strength
and in his power / in his host in his helmes in his chares and in his horsemen
/ not fyghtyng with iron / but with prayeng of holy prayers / In like wise shall
be all the enemies of Israhel / if ye persevere in this work that ye have
begone / with this exortacion they continued prayeng god they perseuered in
the sight of god / and also they yt offered to our lord were clad with sack
cloth and had ashes on their heedes / and with all their heart they prayed god
to visit his people / Israhel / It was told to holofernes prince of the
knyghthode of thassyryens that the children of Israhel made them ready to
resyste him / and had closed ye ways of the mo^tayns / and he was bre^ned in
ouermoche futour in great Ire / he callid all the princes of moab and dukes of
amon and said to them Say ye to me what people is this that bisege the
montaynes / or what or how many cytes have they / also what is their virtue and
what multitude is of them / or who is king of their knyghthode / Then achior
duke of all them of amo^ ansueryng said / if thou daignest to here me / I shall
tell the truth of this people that dwells in ye mo^tayns And there shall not
issue out of my mouth one false word / this people dwelled first in mesopotamye
/ and was of the progenye of the caldees / but would not dwell there for they
would not follow the gods of their faders that were in the land of caldees /
and going and leuyng the cerymonyes of their fadres which was in the multitude
of many gods / they honored one god of heaven / which commanded them to goo
thens and that they should dwell in carra^ Then after was there much hongre
/ that they descended in to Egypt / and there abode iiijC year and multeplied
that they myht not be nombred / when the king of egypt greuyd them in his
bildyngis beryng claye tyles and subdued the^ they cried to our lord / and he
smote the land of egypt with diverse plaghes / when they of egypt had cast
them out fro the^ the plaghe cessed fro them / And then they would have taken
hem again and would have called the^ to their se^uyse / and they fleyng their
god opend the sea to the^ that they went through dry foot / in which the
innumerable host of thegipciens poursyewyng them were drowned / that there was
not one of them sauyd for to tell to them that came after them / They passed
thus the ^^ed see ^ them with manna xl year / and made bitter waters sweet /
and gaf them water out of a stone / And where som^euer this people entered
without bow or arowe / sheld or swerd their god fought for them And there is
noman may prevail against this people but when they depart fro the culture and
honor of their god / And as often as they have departed fro their god and
worshypped other strange gods so often have they ben ouercome^ with their
enemies And when they repent and come to the knowledge of their sin and cry
their god mercy / they ben restored again and their god gives to them virtue
to resist their enemies / They have ouertrowen Cananeu^ the king / Iebusee
pheresee / eneu^ / etheu^ / and amorreu^ / and all the mighty men in Es^^on /
And have taken their land and cytees and possess them / and shall as long as
they plese their god / Their god hated wickedness / For to fore this time when
they went fro the laws that their god gaf to them / he suffered them to be
taken of many nations in to captiuyte / and were disperplid / And now late
they be comen again and possede Ihrl^m where in is sancta sco^rum / and ben
comen over thise mo^taynes where as som^e of hem dwell / now therefore my lord
see and search if there be any wickedness of them in the sight of their god /
and then late us goo to the^ for their god shall give the^ in to thy hondes /
and they shall be subdued under ye yock of thy power / and wha^ Achior had said
thus / all the great men about holyferne were a^gry / and had thought for to
have slain him saying each to other / who is this that may make the children of
Israhel resist the king nabugodonosor and his Armee and host / men cowardis
and without might and without any wysedo^ of war / Therefore that achior may
know / that he says not true / late us ascend the mo^tayns / And when the
mighty men of them be taken / late him be slain with them / that all me^ may
know that nabugodonosor is god of the earth / and that there is none other but
he / Then when they cessed to speak holofernes having Indignacio^ said to
achior / by cause thou have prophesied to us of the children of Israhel saying
that their god defended them / I shall show to the that there is no god but
Nabugodonosor / For when we have ouercomen them all and slain them as one man /
then shall thou dye with them by the swerd of assyryens / And all Israhel
shall be put in to ruin and perdicion / and then shall be known that
nabugodonosor is lord of all the earth / And the swerd of my knyghthode shall
pass through thy sides / And thou shall depart hens and goo to them / And shall
not dye unto the time that I have them and the / And when I have slain them
with my swerd / thou shall in like wise be slain with like vengeance / After
this holofernes commanded his seruauntis to take Achior and led him to bethulye
and to put him in the hands of them of Israhel / And so they took Achior and
ascended the montayns / Again whom came out men of war / Then the servants
of holofernes turned aside and bond Achior to a tree hondes and feet with
cords and left him and so returned to their lord / Then the sons of
Israhel coming down fro bethulye loosed and vnbonde him and brought him to
betulye / And he being set amydde the people was demanded what (...) was and
why he was so sore there bounden / And he told to them all the matter like as
it is aforsaid / and how holofernes had commanded him to be delyuerd unto them
of Israhel / Then all the people fylle down in to their facess worshypyng god
/ And with great lamentacion and weeping with one will made their prayers unto
our lord god of heaven / And that he would behold the pride of them / and to the
mekenes of them of Israhel and take heed to the faces o^ his halowes and show
to them his grace and not forsake the^ / And praid god to have mercy on them
and defend the^ fro their enemies And on that other side holofernes coma^ded
his hoostis to goo up and ^assaille bethulye / and so went up of foot men an C
and xxM / and xij thousand horsemen / and byseged the tou^ and took their water
fro the^ in so much that they yt were in ye tou^ were in great penurye of
water For in all the town was not water ynowgh for one day / And such as they
had was given to the people / by mesure Then all the people young and old came to
Osias which was their prince with Carmy and gothomel / all with one voys
cryeng / God the lord deem between us and the / For thou have don to us evil /
what you spakest not pesybly with thassyryens / For now we shall be delyueryd in
to the hondes of the^ / It is better for us to live in captyuyte under
holofernes and live / than to dye here for thurst / and see our wives and
children dye before our eyes / And when they had made this pyetous cryeng and
yollyng / they went all to their church / and there a long while prayden and
cryeden unto god / knowlechyng their sins and wyckednes / mekely besechyng to
show his grace and pity on the^ / Then at last Ozias aroos up and said to
the people / late us abide yet five days / and if god send us no rescowe ne
help us not in that time / that we may give glory to his name / ellis we shall
do as ye have said / And when that Judith herd hereof which was a wydowe and
a blessed woman / And was left wydowe iij year and vj monethis after that
Manasses her husbond deyde / Anon she went in to ouerest part of her hows in
which she made a pryue bed which she and her servants closed / and having
on her body an heyr / had fasted all the days of her life sauf sabottis and
new mones / and the festis of the hows of Israhel / She was a fair woman and
her husbond had left her much ric^^s / with plentyfull meyne / and possessions
of droues of oxen and flocks / of sheep / and she was a famous woman and
dredde god greatly / And wha^ she had herd that ozias had said that the fyfthe
day the cite should be given over if god helped hem not / she sent for the
prestis of cambre and of Carmy and said to he^ / what is this word in which
Ozias has consented that the cite should be delyuerd to thassyryens / if with
in five days there come no help to us / And who be ye that te^pte the lord god
/ This word is not so styre god to mercy / but rather to areyse wrath / and
wodenes / ye have se^te a time of mercy doing by god / And in your dome ye have
ordained a day to him / O god lord how pacyent is be late us ask him
foryefnes with weeping teeeris he shall not threten as a man / ne enflawme in
wrath as a sone of a man / Therefore meke we our sowles to him / And in a
contryte spyryte and mekyd serve we to him / And say we weeping to god that
after his will he show to us his mercy / And as our heart is troubled in the
pride of them / So also of our humblenes and meknes late us be Joyful / For we
have not followed the sin of our fadres that forsoken their god and worshipped
strange gods / wherefore they were given and bytaken in to hydous and great
vengeance / in to sword ravayne and in to confusyon to their enemies / we
forsothe known none other god but him / Abide we mekely the comfort of him /
And shall keep us fro our enemies / And he shall meke all gentiles that arise
against him And shall make them without worship the lord our god / And now ye
b^ethern ye that been prestes on whom hongeth the life of the people of god /
pray ye unto allmyghty that he make me steadfast in the purpose that I have
purposed / ye shall stand at gate and I shall goo out with my handmayde / And
pray ye the lord that he steadfast make my soul / And do ye nothing till I come
again / And then Judith went in to her oratorye and arrayed her with her
precious clothyng and Ao^^nements / and took unto her handm^yde certain
vytayllys such as she myggt lawfully ete / And when she had made her prayers
unto god / She departed in her most noble array toward the gate / where as
Osias and the prestes abode her / And when they saw her / they meruaylled of
her beauty / Notwithstanding they let her goo seyeng god of our fadres give
the grace and strength all the counseyl of thyn heart with his virtue / and
glory to Iherusalem / And be thy name in the nombre of seynt^s and of
ryghtwysmen And they all they that were there said Amen / and fiat fiat /
Then she praysyng god passed through the yate and her handmayde with her / And
when she came down the hylle about the spryngyng of the day / ano^ the espyes
of thassiryens took her saying whens come you or whyther ghost you / the which
answered I am a daughter of thebrews / and flee fro the^ / knowing that they
shall be taken by you / and come to holofernes for to tell him their pryuetees
/ and I shall show him by what enter he may win them in such wise as one man
of his host shall not perisshe / And the me^ that herd their words beheld her
vysage and wondered of her beauty / saying to her / Thou have sauyd thy life by
cause thou have fou^den such cou^seyl / come therefore to our lord / For when
thou shall stand in his sight / he shall accept yt And they ladde her to the
tabernacle of holofernes / And wha^ she ca^ byfor him / anon holofernes was
caught by his eyes / And his tirau^t knyghtis said to him who despised ye people
of Jews that have so fair wymen / that not for hem of right we ought to fight
against he^ / and so Judith seeing holofernes syttyng in his canape that was of
purpure / of gold / smaragdes and precious stones within wouen / and when she
had seen his face / she honowrid him falling down her self unto therthe / And
the servants of holofernes took her up / he so coma^dyng / Then holofernes
said to her / Be thou not aferd / ne dread the not / I never greuyd ne noyed
man that would serve Nabugodonosor / Thy people sothly if they had not despised
me I had not raised my people ne streng^he against the^ / now tell to me the
cause w^y thou wentist fro the^ / And that it has plesith the to come to us /
And Judith said / Take the words of thy handmayde and if thou follow the^ a
perfight thing god shall do with the / Forsothe Nabugodosor is the living king
/ of therthe / and thou have his power for to chastyse all people / For me^
only serve not him / but also the beestis of the field obeyen to him his might
is known over all / and the chyldryn of Israhel shall be yolden to the For
their god is a^gry with the^ for their wickedness / they ben enfamyned and lack
bread / and watre / They ben constrained to ete their horse and beestis / and
to take such holy things as ben forboden by their law / as whete wyn and
oil / All these things god has showed to me / And they purpose to wast such
thyngis as they ought not touch / and herfor and for their sins they shall be
put in the hands of their enemies / and our lord has shewde me these th^nges
to tell the / And I thyn handmayde shall worshipe god and shall goon out and
pray him and come in and tell the what he shall seye to me / in such wise
that I shall bring the through the myddle of Iherusalem / and thou shall have
all the people of Israhel under the / as the sheep ben under the shepherde / in
so much yt there shall not an hound bark against the / And by cause these
things ben said to me by the prouyde^ce of god / and that god is wroth with
them I am sent to tell the these things

Forsothe all these words plesed much to holofernes and to his people / And
they meruaylleden of ye wysedo^ of her / and one said to another / There is not
such a woman upon earth in sight / in fairness / and in wit of words / And
holofernes said to her god has do well that he has sent ye hither / for to
let me have knowleche / and if thy god do to me thise things / he shall be my
god / and thou and thy name shall be great in the hows of Nabugodonosor / Then
commanded holofernes her to goo in where his tresor lay and to abide there / and
to give to her mete fro his feste / to whom she said that she myht not ete of
his mete but that she has brouht mete with her for to ete / Then holofernes
said whan^ that mete faylleth what shall we give to the to ete / And Judith
said that she should not spend all / till god shall do in my hondes tho things
yt I have thought And the servants lad her in to his tabernacle / And she
desired that she might goo out in the night and before day to pray and come
in again / And the lord commanded his cubyculyers that she should goo and come at
her play^yr three days during / And she went out in to the valeye of bethulye
and baptized her in the water / of the well / And she stratched her hondes up
to the god of Israhel / prayeng the good lord that he should govern her way
for to deliver his people / And thus she did unto the fourth day / Then
holofernes made a great feste / And sent a man of his which was ghelded named
vago / for to e^trete Judith for to lie with his lord and to come ete and
drink wyn with him / And Iudyth said what (...) I that should gaynsaye my
lords desire I am at his comandem^t / what som^euer he will that I do / I shall
do and plese him all the days of my life / And she roos and aourned her self
with her rich and precious clothes / and went in and stood before holofernes
/ And holofernes heart was percyd with her beauty and bre^ned in the lust and
desire of her / and said to her sit dou^ and drynk in Joy for thou have
fou^den grace before me / Judith said I shall drynk my lord / for my life is
magnefyeed this day before all the days of my life / and she ete and drunk
such as her handmayde had ordained for her / And holofernes was merry and
drank so much wyn yt he never dra^ke so much in one day in all his life / and
was dronken and at eue^ wha^ it was night olofernes went unto his bed / and
vago brought Judith in to his chamber / and closid the door and when Judith was
allone / in the chamber / and holofernes lay and slepte in ouermoche
dro^kenesse / Judith said to her handmayde that she should stand / withoutforth
before the door of the preuy chamber and wait about / and Judith stood before
the bed praye^g with teeris and with meuyng of her lips secretly saying / O
lord god of Israhel co^ferme me in this hour to the works of my hondes / that
thou reyse up the cite of Iherusalem as thou have promised / And that I may
perform this that I have thought to do / And when she had thus said she went
to the pyler that was at his beds heed / And took his swerd and losed it /
and when she had drawn it out / she took his here in her hand and said /
Conferme me god of Israhel in this hour and smote twyes in the neck and cut
of his heed / and left the body lie stylle and took the heed and wrapped it in
the canape / and delyueryd it to her maid / and bad her to put it in her
scryppe / And they two went out after their usage to pray / And they passed
the tents and going about the valeye camen to the yate of the cytee / And
Iudyth said to the kepers of the walls / Opene the yates / for god is with us
that has don great virtue in Israhel / And anon when they herd her call /
they called the preestis of the cite / And they come^ rennyng for they had
supposed no more to have see^ her / And lyghtyng lights all went about her /
She then entrid in / stood up in ^an hye place / and coma^ded scylence / and
said praise ye the lord god that forsakes not me^ hopyng in him / And in me
his hand woman has fulfyllyd his mercy / that he promised to the house of
Israhel / And has slain in my hand thenemye of his people this night / And
then she brought forth the heed of holofernes / and shewde it to them saying
/ loo here the heed of holofernes prince of the chyualrye of assyriens And lo
the canope of him in which he lay in his dronkenhed / where our lord has
smeton him by the hand of a woman Forsooth god lives for his au^gel kept me
hens going / there abidyng / and fro thens hither retornyng / And the lord has
not suffer me his handwoman to ben defowled / But without pollucio^ of sin
has called me again to you Ioyeng in his vyctorye in my escapyng / and in your
delyuerau^ce / Knoweleche ye him all for good For his mercy is everlasting
world w^thouten end / And all they honoring our lord sayden to her the lord
bless the in his virtue / For by the he has brought our enemies to naught /
Then Ozias the prince of the people said to her / Blessed be thou of the hye
god before all wymen upon earth / And blessed be the lord that made heaven and
earth that has addressid the in the wou^^es of the heed of the prince of our
enemies / After this Judith bad that the heed should be hanged up on the walls
/ And at the son risyng every man in his arms issue out upon your enemies /
and when their espies shall see you / they shall re^ne unto the tente of their
prince / to reyse him and to make him ready to fight / and when his lords shall
see him deed / they shall be smeton with so great dread and feer that they shall
flee / whom ye then shall pursyewe / And god shall bring the^ and trede them
under your feet Then achior sceyng the virtue of ye god of Israhel / left
his old hethens custo^ and byleuyd in god and was circu^sised in his preuy
member and put him self to the people of Isrl^ / and all the succession of his
kynred unto this day / Then at the spryngyng of the day they henge the heed
of holofernes on the walls / And every man took his arms and went out with
great noise / which thing seeing thespyes ronnen to gydre to the tabernacle of
holofernes / and came making noise for to make him taryse and that he should
awake but noma^ was so hardy to knock or enter in to his preuy chamber / but
wha^ the dukes and leders of thousands came^ and other they said to the preuy
cha^berlayns / goo and awake your lord / For myes ben gone out of their caves
and ben hardy to call us to bataylle / Then vago his bawd went in to his
preuy chamber / and stood before the curtyne / and clapped his hands to gydre
wenyng he had slepte with Judith / And when he perceuyd no meuyng of him / he
drew the curteyn / and seeing the deed body of holofernes with out heed lyeng
in his blood / cried with a great voys weeping and rendyng his clothes / and
went in to the tabernacle of Judith and fond her not / And sterte out to the
people and said / A woman of thebrewes has made confusion in the house of
nabugodonosor / she has slain holofernes and is deed / and she has his heed
with her / And wha^ ye princes and capytayns of thassyryens herd this / Anon
they rent their clothes and intolerable dread fylle on them / and were sore
troblyd in their wits and made an horrible cry in their tentis / And when
all thoost had herd how olofernes was byheded / cou^seyl and mind flewh fro
the^ / and with great tre^blyng for socoure bygonne to flee / in such wise
that none would speak with other / but with their heedes bowed down fled for
tescape fro thebrews / whom they saw armed coming upon the^ / and departed
fleyng by feldes and weyes of hills and valeyes / And the sons of Israhel
seeing them fleyng / followed them cryeng with tru^pes and showtyng after the^ /
And slew and smote down al them yt they ouertoke / And Osias sent forthwith
unto all the cytees and regyons of Israhel / And they sent after all the young
me^ and valiau^t to pursiewe the^ by swerd / and so they did unto the
vttermest coostis of Israhel / The other me^ sothly yt weren in bethulye went
in to the tentis of thassyrens / and took all the pray that thassyryens had
left / And when the me^ yt had pursiewed the^ / were returned / they took all
their beestis and all the meuable goods and things yt they had left so much
/ that every man fro ye most to the least were made rich by the pray that
they took Then Ioachim the high bishop of Ihrl^m ca^ unto bethulye with all
the preestis for to see Judith / and when she ca^ to fore the^ / all they
blessid her with one vois saying / Thou glory of Ihrl^m / thou gladness of
Israhel / thou the worship doing of our people / you did ma^ly / and thyn heart
is comforted / by cause you louedyst chastyte / and knew no man after the
death of thy husbond / and therefore the hand of god has comforted the / And
therefore you shall be blessed world without end / and all the people said fiat /
fiat / be it don / be it don / certainly the spoylles of thassyrie^s were
uneath gadred and assembled to gydre in xxx days of the people of Isrl / But
all the propre Rychesses yt were apperteynyng to holofernes and could be
fou^den yt had been his / they were given to Judith as well gold / silver ge^mes
clothis as a^l other appertena^cis to household / and all was delyuerd to her of
the people / and the folks with wime^ and mayde^s Ioyede^ in organs and harpes
/ Then Judith song this song unto god saying / Begin ye in tymbres / Sing
ye to the lord in cymbalis / Manerly sing to him a new psalm Fully Joy ye
and Inwardly call ye his name / and so forth / And for this great miracle and
victory all the people came to Ihrl^m for to give laud honor and worship unto
our lord god / and after they were purified they offered sacrefices vows / and
behestis unto god / and the Joy of this victory was sole^pnysed during iij
monethis / and after yt each went home again in to his owen cite and house /
and Judith returned in to bethulye and was made more great and clear to all
men of the land of Israheel / She was Joined to the virtue of chastyte / so
that she knew noman all the days of her life / after ye death of man^sses her
husbond / And duellyd in the house of her husbond an hundred and five year And
she left her damoyselle free / And after this she deyde and is buried in
bethulye / and all the people bewailed her seven days / during her life after
this Journey was no troble among the Jews / and the day of this victory of
ye hebrews was accepted for a festful day and hallowed of the Jews and nombred
among their feestis unto this day /

After the festes of our lord Ihesu crist to fore set in order folowen the
lege^des of Saynctes and first of saint Andrewe
ANdrew is expowned and is as much to say as fair or answeryng unto strength
and it is said of andor / that is as much to say as strength / Or andrewe is
said thus as antipos / Of ana which is to say hye / and of tropos / which is
conversion / so that andrewe is to say A man hyely converted / and in heaven
adressyd unto his maker / he was fair in his life / answeryng in wysedom / and
in doctrine / strong in pain / and converted hie in glory / The prestes and
diacones of achaye wrote his passyo^ like as they had seen it with their eyes /

ANdrewe and som^e other dyscyples were called iij times of our lord he called
them first in the knoulechyng of him / as when saint andrewe was with Ioh^n the
baptyst his maysstre / and another dyscyple / he herd that Ioh^n said / lo
here the lombe of god / and then he went anon with another dysciple and came
to Ihesu christ and abode with him all that day / And then saint Andrew fond
simon his brother / and brought him to Ihesu christ / and the next day following
they went to their craft of fysshyng / And after this he called them the
second time / by the stagne of genazareth / which is named the sea of galylee
/ he entered in to the ship of Simon and of andrew / and there was taken great
multitude of fissh / And he called James and Ioh^n / which were in another
ship and they followed him / And after went in to their propre places / After
this he called hem fro their fysshyng / and said / come follow me / I shall
make you fysshers of men / Then they left their ships and nettis and
followed him / And after this they abode with him / and went no more to their
own howses / And how be it he callid / Andrewe and sum other to be apostles
/ of which calling matthew says in the third chapter / he called to him them
that he would / And after thascencion of our lord the apostles were departed /
and andrew prechid in Sichye / And Matthew in murgo^dye And the me^ of this
country refused utterly the prechyng of saint Mathewe and drew out his eyes /
And cast him in pryso^ fast bounden / In the mean while an angele sent from
our lord appired to saint andrew / and coma^ded him to go to saint matthew in to
murgondye / and he answered that he knew not ye way / and then tha^gele
coma^ded him yt he should goo unto the sea side / and that he should enter in to
the first ship yt he should find and so he did gladly in acco^plisshyng the
coma^dem^t / and went in to ye cite by the ledyng of the a^gele and had wind
propyce / and when he was come / he fond the prison opene / where saint
Mathewe was Inn / and when he saw him he wept sore and worshypyd him / and
then our lord rendryd and gaf again to saint Mathewe his two eyes and his
sight / And then saint Matthew departed fro thens and came in to Anthioche /
And saint Andrewe abode in murgondye / And they of the country were wroth that
saint Matthew was so eskaped / Then took they saint Andrewe and drew him
through the places / his hondes bounden in such wise that the blood ran out /
he prayed for them to Ihesu christ / And converted them by his prayer / And fro
thens he came to anthioche / This that is said of the blyndyng of saint Matthew I
suppose that it is not true / ne that theua^gelyste was not so vnferme but
that he might get for his syhgt / that saint andrewe gate for him so lightly /
Hit was so that a young man came and followed saint Andrewe / again the will of
all his parentis / And on a time his parents set fire on the hows / where he
was with thappostle / And when the flamme surmounted right hye / the child
took a brusshe full of water / and sprengte with all the fire / And anon the
fire quenchyd / And then his friends and parents said our sone is made an
enchantour / And as they would have goon up by the laddres / they were suddenly
made blind / that they saw not the laddres And then one of them escryed and
said / wherefore enforce ye you again the^ god fyghteth for them and ye see it
not / Cesse ye and leave of / lest the ire of our lord fall on you / Then
many / of them that saw this byleuyd in our lord / And the parentys deyde
within xl days after / and were put in one sepulture /

There was a woman with child great upon her delyuerance / And at the time of
chyldyng / she mygt not be delyueryd / She bad her suster to goo to dyane / and
pray to her that she help me She went and prayde / And dyane said to her /
which was the devil in an ydole / wherefore prayest thou to me / I may not
help ne prouffyte the / but goo unto Andrewe thappostle / which may help the
and thy suster / And she went to him / and brought him to her suster which
traueylled in great pain and began to perysshe / And thappostle said to her by
good right suffrest thou this pain / Thou conceyuedyst in trych^rye (...)
sin / And thou counseyl^ledes^ with the devil / Repent the and believe in
Ihesu christ / and thou shall be anon delyueryd of thy child / And when she
byleuyd and was repentaunt / she was delyueryd of her child and the pain and
sorrow passed and cessed /

An old man called nycholas by name / went unto thappostle and said to him /
Sire I have lived fyfty year and alleway in lechery / And I took on a time a
gospelle in prayeng god that he would give me fro than forthon contynence / But
I am acustomed in this sin and full of evil delectacion in such wise that I
shall return to this sin acustomed / On a time that I was enflamed by luxurye
I went to the bourdel / and forgate the gospel upon me / And anon the foul
woman said goo hens thou old man for thou art an angele of god / touch me not
/ ne come no ner me / for I see meruaylle upon the / and I was abassheed of the
word of the woman and I remembryd that I had the gospelle upon me wherefore I
beseech the / to pray god for me and for my health / And when saint Andrewe
herd this / he began to weep and prayed fro tyerce unto non^ / And when he
aroos he would not ete / And said I shall ete no mete till I know wether our lord
shall have pity of this old man / And when he had fast five days / a voys came
to saint Andrew / and said to him / Andrewe thy request is granted for the
old man for like as thou have fasted and made thy self leave / so shall he fast
and make him self leave / by fastings for to be saved / And so he did / for he
fasted vj monethis to bread and water / and after that he reested in pees and
good works / Then came a voys that said / I have gotten Nicholas by thy
prayers whom I had lost / A young christian man said to saint Andrewe / ^ My
mother saw that ^ was fair / and required me / for to have to do and sin
with her / And when I would not consent to to her in no manner / she went to
the Judge / and would return and leye to me the sin of so great a felonye /
pray for me that I deye not so untruly / For when I shall be accused / I shall
hold my peace and speak not one word / and have lever to deye / than to
dyffame and sklaundre my mother so fowly / Thus came he to Judgment / and his
mother accused him saying that he would have defowled her / And it was axed of
him often if it was so as she said / And he answered nothing / Then said saint
andrew to her / Thou art most cruel of all wymen / which for
thaccomplysshement of thy lecherye / wilt make thy sone to deye / Then said
this woman to the provost / Sire sith that my sone came and acompanyed with this
man / he would have don his will with me / but I withstode him that he might
not / And anon the provost and Judge commanded / that the sone should be put in a
sack enoynted with glewe and thrown in to the River / And saint Andrewe to be
put in prison / till he had aduysed him how he might tourmente him / But saint
andrew made his prayer to god And anon came an horrible thondre / which fered
them all / and made the earth to tremble strongly / And the woman was smeton
with the thondre unto the death / And the other prayed the apostle that they
might not perysshe And he prayed for them / And the tempest cessed / Thus then
the prouoste believed in god and all his main / After this as thappostle was
in the cite of Nypce / the cytezeins said to him that there were seven deuylles
without ye cite by the hye way / which slew all them that passed forthby / and
thappostle commanded them to come to him / which came in the lykenes of dogs /
And sith he commanded them that they should goo / where as they should not grieve
ne do harm to any man / And anon they vanysshed away / And when the people
saw this / they receyuyd the faith of Ihesu Christ / And when thappostle came
to the yate of an other cite / there was brought a young man deed / Thapostle
demanded what was byfallen him / and it was told him that vij dogs came and
strangled him / Then thappostle wept and said / O lord god / I knew well yt
these were the deuylles / that I put out of Nypce / And after said to the fader
of him that was deed / what will thou give to me if I reyse him / And he said I
have nothing so dear as him / I shall give him to the / And anon thappostle made
his prayers unto almighty god / and reysyd him from death to life / And he went
and followed him /

On a time there were xl me^ by nombre which were coming by the sea sayllyng
unto thappostle for to receive of him the doctrine of the faith / and the devil
raised and meuyd a great storm and so horrible a tourment / that all they were
d^owned to gydre / And when their bodies were brought to fore thappostle / he
raised them fro death to life anon / And there they said all that was befallen to
them / And therefore it is read in an hympne / that he rendryd the life to young
men drowned in the sea / And the blessed saint andrewe whylys he was in achaye
/ he replenesshyd all the country with chirches and converted the people to the
faith of Ihesu christ / And informed the wif of Egeas which was provost and
Judge of the town / in the faith / and baptized her / and when Egeas herd this
he came in to the cite of patras and constrained the christian to sacrefye / And
saint Andrew came unto him and said hit behooves the which have deseruyd to be
a Judge / to know thy Judge which is in heaven / and he so known / that thou
worshype him / And so worshypyng withdraw thy courage fro the false gods /
And Egeas said thou art Andrewe that prechest a false law / which the princes
of Rome have commanded to be destroyed / to whom Andrewe said / The princes of
Rome knew never how the sone of god came And taught and informed hem that the
ydolles ben deuylles / And he that techeth such things angreth god / and he
so angered / departs fro them that he hereth hem not / And therefore ben they
caytyuys of the devil / and ben so illused and deceyuyd / that they issue out
of the body all naked / and bear nothing with them but sins / And Egeas said
to him / These ben the vanytees that your Ihesu preached / which was nailed on
the galowes of the cross / To whom Andrewe said / he receyuyd with his
agreement the gybet of the cross / not for his culpe and trespaas / but for our
redemption / And Egeas said when he was delyueryd of his dyscyple / taken and
holden with the Jews and crucefyed by the knights / how say thou that it
was by his agreement Then saint Andrewe began to show by five raysons that
Ihesu christ received death by his own agreement and will For as much as he came
to fore his passion / and said to his dyscyples that it should be / when he said
we shall gone up to Iherusalem and the sone of the maid shall be bytrayed / And
also for that / that petre would wythdrawe him he repreuyd him / and said goo
after me sathanas / And also for that / that he shewde that he had power to
suffer death / and to rise again / when he said I have power to put away my
soul / and to take it again / And also for that he knew to fore him that
betrayed him / when he gaf him his souper / and showed him not / And also for
that he chese the place where he should be taken For he knew well that the
traytre should come / ^ And saint Andrewe said that he had been at all these
things / And yet he said more / that the mysterye of ye cross was great / to
who^ Egeas said it may not be said mysterye / but turment / and if thou will
not grant to my sayengys / truly I shall make the preue this mysterye / And
Andrew said to him / if I doubted the gybet of the cross / I would not preche
the glory thereof / I will that you here the mysterye and if thou knew and
byleuydyst on it / thou sholdest be saved Then he shewde to him the mystery
of the cross / And assygned five resons / The first is this / For as much as
the first man that deseruyd death was by cause of the tree / in brekynge the
commandment of god / Then is it thing couenable that the second man should
put away that death / in suffryng the same on the tree / The second was that he
which was made of earth not corrupted / and was breker of the commandment /
then was it thing couenable that he that should repelle this defaulte should be
born of a vyrgyne / The third / for so much as Adam had stratched his hand
dysordynatly to the fruit forboden / it was thing couenable / that the new
Adam should stratche his ha^dys in the cross / The fourth for so much as adam
had tasted swetly the fruit forboden / it is therefore rayson / that it be put
away by thing contrary / so that Ihesu christ was fed with bitter galle /
The fyfthe for as much as Ihesu christ gaf to us his ni mortalyte / it is
thing Rasonnable you he take our mortalyte / For if Ihesu christ had not be deed
/ Man had never be made mmortal / And then said Egeas / Tell to thy
dyscyples such vanytees / And obey thou to me / and make sacrefise unto the
gods almighty / And then said saint Andrewe I offer every day unto god
almighty a lamb without spotte / And after that he is receyuyd of all the
people so lives he / and is all hole / Then demands Egeas / how that might
be / And Andrewe said / take the form for to be a dyscyple / and thou shall
know it well / I shall demand the said Egeas by turmentis / Then he being
all angry commanded that he should be enclosed in prison / And on the morn he
came to Judgment / And the blessed saint Andrewe unto the sacrefyse of ye
ydolles / And Egeas commanded to be said to him / if thou obey not to me I shall
do hang the on the cross / For so much as thou have praised it / And thus
as he menaced him of many turmentis / saint Andrewe said to him / Think what
turment that is most grievous that thou may do to me / and the more I suffer
the more I shall be agreeable to my king / by cause I shall be most ferme in the
turmentis and pain Then commanded Egeas that he should be beten of xxj men /
And that he should be so beten bounden by the feet and hands unto the cross /
to the end that his pain should endure the longer / And when he was led unto
the cross / there ran much people theder saying / The blood of thynnocent is
dampened without cause / And thappostle prayed them / that they should not
empesshe ne let his turment ne martirdom / And when he saw the cross fro
far / he salewed it and said / All hayl cross which art dedycate in the
body of Ihesu christ / and were aourned with the me^bres of him as of precious
stones / To fore that our lord Ascended on the / thou were the power erthly /
Now thou art the love of heaven / Thou shall receive me by my desire / I come to
the surely and gladly so that thou receive me gladly as dyscyple of him that
henge in the / For I have always worshyppid the and have desire the tembrace / O
thou cross which have received beauty and noblesse of the members of our lord
/ who^ I have so long desired / and curiously loved and whom my courage has so
much desired and coueyted / take me fro hens and yield me to my master / to
the end that he receive me by the / that redemyd me by the / And in this saying
he dyspoylled and vnclad him and gaf his clothys unto the bochyers And then
they henge him in the cross / like as to them was commanded / And there he
lyuyd two days and preached to twenty thousand men that there were / Then all
the company swore the death of egeas / and said / The holy man and debounayre
ought not to suffer this / Then came theder egeas for to take him down of the
cross / And when andrewe saw him he said / wherefore art thou come to me
Egeas / if it be for penance thou shall have it / And if it be for to take me
down know thou for certain / thou shall not take me hereof alive / For I see
now my lord and king that abides for me / therewith they would have vnbounden
him / And they might in no wise touch him / For their arms were bynomen and
of no power / And the holy saint Andrew saw / that the world would have taken
him down of the cross / he made this oryson hangyng on the cross as saint
Austyn says in the book of penance / Sire suffer me not desce^de fro this
cross a live / For it is time that thou comande my body to the earth / For I
have born long the charge / And have so much watched upon that / which was
commanded to me / and have so long traueyllyd / that I would now be delyuerd of
this obedyence / and be taken away fro this agreeable charge / I remember that
it is much grievous / in proud beryng / in doubtyng / unsteadfast / in
nouryssyng / And have gladly labored in the refraynyng of them / Sire thou
know how often the world has entented to withdraw me fro the purete of
contemplacion / how often he has intended to awake me fro the sleep of my sweet
rest / how much and how often times he has made me to sorrow / And as much
as I have had might / I have resysted it right debonayrly / in fyghtyng against
it / And have by thy work and aid surmounted it / And I require of the /
Just and debonayr gwerdon and reward / And that thou coma^de that I not goo
again thereto / but I yield to the that / which thou have delyuerd me / Comande
it to another / and empesshe me no more / but keep me in the resurrection / so
that I may receive the merit of my labor / Comande my body unto the earth /
so that it behooves no more to wake / but late it be stratched freely to the /
which art fontayne of Joy never fayllyng / And when he had said this / there
came fro heaven a right great shynyng light / which enuyroned him by the space
of half an our / in such wise that noman might see him / And when this light
departed he yielded and rendryd therewith his spyryte / And maximilla the wife of
Egeas took away the body of thappostle and buried it honnourably / And or that
Egeas was comen again to his hows / he was rauysshyd with a devil by the way /
and deyed to fore them all / and it is said that out of his sepulcre comes
manna like unto mele / And oylle which has a right sweet savor and odor /
And by that is showed to the people of the country / when there shall be plente of
goods / For when there comes but lytyl of manna / Therthe shall bring forth
but lytyl fruit / And when it comes habundantly / The earth brings forth
fruit plentyuously / And this might well happen of old time / For the body of
him was transported in to Constantynoble /

There was a bishop that led an holy and relygyous life / And louyd saint
Andrewe by great devotion and worshypyd him above all other saints / so that
in all his werkys he remembryd him every day / and said certain prayers in
thonour of god and saint Andrewe / in such wise that thenemye had envy on him
and set him for to deceive him with all his malice / And transfourmed him in
to the form of a right fair woman / And came to the palace of the bishop /
and said that she would be confessyd to him / And the bishop bad her to goo
confess her to his penytau^cer which had plain power of him And she sent him
word again / that she would not releue ne show the secrets of her confessyo^
to none but to him And so the bishop commanded her to come / And she said to
him / Sire I pray the that thou have mercy on me I am so as ye see in the
years of my yongthe and a maid / and was delycyously nourisshed fro my
Infancye / and born of ryal lygnage / but I am come allone in strange habyte /
For my fader which is a right mighty king would give me to a prince by marriage
/ whereto I answer that I have horror of all beds of marriage / and I have
given my vyrgynyte to Ihesu christ for ever / And therefore I may not consent to
carnal copulacion / And in the end he constrained me so much that I must
co^sente to his will or suffer diverse torments / so that I am fled secretly
away / and had lever be in exyle than to break and corrupt my faith to my
spouse / And by cause I here the preysyng of your right holy life / I am fled
unto you and to your guard / in hope that I may find with you place of rest /
where as I may be secret in contemplacion / and eschew the evil peryllys of
this present life / and flee the diverse trybulacions of the world / Of which
thing the bishop meruayllyd him greatly / as well for the great noblesse of her
lignage / as for the beaulte of her body / for the brennyng of the great love
of god / And of the honest fair spekyng of this woman / so that the bishop
answered to her with a meke and playsaunt voys / daughter be sure and doubt
nothing / For he for whose love / thou have despised thy self / and these
things / shall give to the great thing / In this time present is lityl glory
or Joy but it shall be in time to come / And I which am sergeant of the same /
off^e me to the and my goods / And ch^se the an hows where it shall plese the /
And I will that thou dyne with me this day / And she answered and said fader
require me of no such thing / For by adventure som^e evil suspectyon might
come thereof / And also the resplendour of your good renomee might be thereby
empayred / to whom the bishop answered / we shall be many to gydre / and I shall
not be with you allone / And therefore there may be no suspection of evil /
Then they came to the table / and were set that one against that other / And
the other folk here and there / and the bishop entendeth much to her / / and
beheld her alleway in the vysage / and he merualled of her great beauty / And
thus as he fyxed his eyes on her / his courage was hurt / And thauncyent enemy
/ when he saw the heart of him hurt with a grievous dart / And this devil
apperceyuyd it / and began tencrece her beauty more and more / in so much that
the bishop was then ready for to require her to sin wha^ he might / Then
a pilgrim came and began to smite strongly at the yate oc door / and they would
not opene it / then he cryde and knocked more strongly / And the bishop axed
of the woman if she would that the pilgrim should enter / And she said / men
should axe first of him a question grievous ynowh and if he could answer thereto
/ he should be receyuyd / and if he could not / he should abide without and not
come in / as he that were not worthy but vnwetyng / And all agreed to her
sentence / and inquired which of them were suffysaunt for to put the questyon
/ And when none was found suffysau^t / the bishop said none of us is so
suffyssaunt as ye dame For ye pass us all in fair spekyng / and shine in
wysdom more than we all / propose ye the question / Then she said / demand
ye of him / which is the grettest meruaylle that ever god made in lityl space
/ And then one went and demanded the pilgrim / The pilgrim answered to the
messager that it was the dyuersyte and thexcellence of the faces of men / For
emonge also many men as have been since the beginning of the world unto the end /
ij men might not be founden of whom their faces were like and semblable in all
things / And when thanswer was herd / all they meruaylled and said that this
was a very and right good answer of the question / Then the woman said
late the second question be proposed to him / which shall be more grievous to
answer to / for to preue the better the wysedo^ of him / which was this /
Whether the earth is hyer than all the heaven / And when it was demanded of him
/ the pilgrim answered / In the heaven Imperyal where the body of Ihesu christ is
which is the form of our flesh / he is more hye than all the heaven / Of
this answer they meruaylled all wha^ the messager reported it / and praised
meruayllously his wysedom / Consequently she said the third questyon / which
was more derke and grievous tassoylle / for to preue the third time his wysedom
and that then he be worthy to be receyuyd at bishops table / demand and axe
of him / how much space is fro the abysme / unto the same heaven / Then the
messager demanded of the pilgrim / And he answered him / goo to him that sent
the to me / and axe of him this thing / For he knows better than I / and can
better answer to it / For he has mesured this espace when he fyl fro heuene
in to the abysme / And I never mesured it / This is nothing a woman / but it is
a devil / which has taken the form of a woman / And when the messager herd
this / he was sore aferd / and told to fore them all / this that he had herd /
And when the bishop herd this and all other they were sore aferd / And anon
forthwith the devil vanysshyd away to fore her eyes / And after the bishop came
again to him self and repreuyd him self bytterly weeping repentyng and requyryng
pardon of his sin / And sent a messager for to fetch and bring in the
pilgrim / but he fond him never after / Then the bishop assemblyd the
people and told to them the manner of this thing / And prayed them that they all
would be in orysons and prayers / in such wise that our lord would show to
sum person / who this pilgrim was / which had delyueryd him fro so great
peril / And then it was shewde that night to the bishop / that it was saint
Andrewe / which had put him in thabyte of a pilgrim for the delyuerance of him
/ Then began the bishop more and more to have devotion and remembrance to
saint Andrewe than he had to for The prouoste of a Cite had taken away a field
fro the church of saint Andrewe / And by the prayer of the bishop he was
fallen in to a strong fever / And then he prayed the bishop that he would
pray for him / And he would yield again the field / And when the bishop had
prayed for him and had his health / he took the field again / Then the bishop
put him self to prayer and orysons / and brake all the lamps of the church
and said / There shall none of them be lighted / till that our lord has vengyd
him on his enemy / and that the church have recouerd that which she has
lost / And then the prouoste was strongly turmentid with feures / and sent
to the bishop by messagers that he should pray for him / And he would yield
again his field and another semblable / Then the bishop answered I have here
to fore prayed for him / and god herd and granted my prayer / and when he was
hole / he took fro me again the field / And then the prouoste made him to be
born to ye bishop and constrained him to enter in to the church for to pray
/ And the bishop entryd in to the chirch / And anon the prouoste deyed / And
the field was reestablysshyd unto ye church / and sic e^ finis

Here ends the lif of saint Andrewe thappostle
And here begins the life of saint Nicholas the bishop
NYcholas is said of nychos / which is to say victory / and of laos / people
/ so nycholas is as much to say / as vyctorye of people / that is victory of
sins / which ben foulepeple /

Or ellis he is said victory of people / by cause he enseygned and taught much
people / by his doctrine to overcome vices and sins / Or Nycholas is said of
Nichor / that is the resplendour or shynyng of the people / For he had in him
things that make shynyng and clennesse / After this that saint Ambrose says /
The word of god / very confession / and holy thought make a man clean / And
the doctors of greece write his legende / And som^e other say / that Methodius
the patriarch wrote it in greek / And Ioh^n the deken translated it in to latin
/ and adiousted thereto many things /

NIcholas citezeyn of the cite of Pancraes was born of Rich and holy kyn^e /
And his fader was Epyphanus / And his mother Iohane he was bygoten in the first
flour of their age / And fro that time for ^on / they lived in contynence / and
led an heavenly life / Then the first day that he was wassh^n and bayned / he
adressid him right up in the basyn / And he would not take the breast ne the
pappe but ones on the wednesday / and ones on the friday / And in his young age
he eschewed the plays and Iapes of other young children / he used and haunted
gladly holy church / And all that he might understand of holy scripture / he
executed it in deed and work after his power / And when his fader and mother
were departed out of this life / he began to think / how he might distrybute
his Richesses / and not to the preysyng of the world / but to the honor and
glory of god / and it was so / that one his neyhbour had then three daughters
virgyns / and he was a noble man / but for the pouerte of them to gydre / they
were constrained and in very purpose / to aba^donne them to the sin of
lecherye / so that by the gain and wynnyng of their Infamye he might be
sustained / And when the holy man Nycholas knew h^rof / he had great orrour of
this vylonye / And threw by night secretly in to the hows of the man a mass
of gold / wrapped in a cloth / And when the man aroos in the moenyng / he
fond this mass of gold / And rendered to god therefore great tha^kynges / And
therewith he married his oldest daughter / And a lityl while after / this holy
servant of god / drew in an other mass of gold / which the man fond / and
thanked god / and purposed to wake for to know him that so had aided him in
his pouerte / And a few days Nicholas doubled the mass of gold and cast it
in to the hows of this man / he awoke by the sown of the gold / and followed
Nicholas / which fled fro him / and he said to him / Sire flee not away so /
but that I may see and know the / Then he ran after him more hastily / and
knew that it was Nicholas / And anon he kneled down and would have kyssed his
feet / but the holy man would not / but required him not to tell ne descouer
this thing as long as he lived / After this the bishop of the cite if Myrre
deyde / and other bysshopp is assembled for to pourueye to this church a
bishop / And there was among the other / a bishop of great auctoryte / And
all thelectyon was in him / And when he had warned all for to be in fastings
and in prayers / This bishop herd that night a voys / which said to him /
that at hour of matyns / he should take heed to the doors of the church / And
him that should come first to the church and have the name of Nicholas / they
should sacre him bishop / And he shewid this to the other bishops / and
admonested them for to be all in prayers / And he kept the doors / And this
was a merueyllous thing / For at hour of matyns / like as he had be sent fro
god / Nicholas aroos to fore all other / And the bishop took him when he was
comen / And demanded of him his name / And he which was simple as a done /
enclyned his heed / and said I have to name Nicholas / Then the bishop said
to him / Nicholas servant and friend of god / for your holiness ye shall be
bishop of this place^ / And sith they brought him to the church / how be it
that he refused it strongly / yet they set him in the chayer / And he followed
as he did to fore in all things of humylyte and honest of manners / he woke
in prayers / and made his body lene / he eschiewed company of wymen / he was
humble in receyuyng all things / prouffytable / in spekyng / Joyous in
admonestyng and cruel in correctyng /

Hit is red in a cronycle / that the blessed Nicholas was at the counseil of
Nicene / And on a day as a ship with maronners were in perisshyng on the sea
/ they prayed and required devoutly Nicholas servant of god / saying / if tho
things that we have herd of the said ben true / preue them now / And anon a
man appeared in lyknes and said / loo see ye me not / ye called me / And then
he began to help them in their exployte of the sea / And anon the tempest
cessed / And when they were come to his church / they knew him / without any
man to show him to them / And yet they had never seen him / And then they
thanked god and him of their delyueraunce / And he bad them to attrybue it to
the mercy of god and to their believe / and nothing to his merytes /

It was so on a time that all the prouynce of saint Nicholas suffered great
famyne / in such wise that vytaylle faylled / And then this holy man herd
say that certain ships laden with whete were arrived in the haven And anon
he went theder / and prayde the maro^ners / that they would socoure the
perisshid / at lest with an C muyes of whete of every ship / And they said
fader we dar not / For it is moten / and mesured / And we must give rekennyng
thereof in the garners of the emperor / in Alexandrye / And the holy man said to
them / do this that I have said to you / and I promise in the truth of god
/ that it shall not be lassed ne mynuysshed / when ye shall come to the garners /
And when they had delyueryd so much out of every ship / they came in to
alexandrye / and delyuerd the mesure that they had received / And then they
recounted the miracle to the mynystres of the emperor / and worshipid and
preysed strongly god and his servant Nicholas / Then this holy man
distrybuted the whete / to every man after that he had need / in such wise
that it suffyced for ij year / not only for to selle / but also for to sow /
And in this contre the people served ydollis / and worshippid the false image of
the cursed deane / And to the time of this holy man / many of them had som^e
customs of the paynems for to sacrefyse to dyane under a sacred tree / But
this this good man made them of all the contre to cesse then these custommes
/ And commanded to cut of the tree / Then the devil was angry and wrote
against him / and made an oylle that brenned against nature in water and brenned
stones also / And then he transformed him in the guyse of ^ relygyouse woman
/ and put him in a lityl lote / and encou^tred pylgryms that saylled in the sea
toward this holy saint / and aresonued them thus and said / I would fayn goo to
this / holy man / but I may not / wherefore I pray you to bear this oylle in to
his church and for the remembrance of me / that ye enoynte the walls of the
halle / and anon he vanysshed away / Then they saw anon after another ship
with honest persons among whom there was one like to saint Nicholas which
spack to them softly / what has this woman said to you / And what she has
brought / And they told to him all by order / And he said to them / this is
the evil and fowl dyane / And to the^de that ye know that I say truth cast
that oylle in to the Sea / And when they had cast it / A great fire caught it
in the sea / And they saw it long brenne against nature / Then they came to
this holy man and said to him / verily thou art he that appeared to to us in the sea / and delyuerdest us fro the sea and awaytes of the devil /

And in this time certain men rebelled against thmperour / And the emperor sent
against them three princes / Nepocien / Versyn / and Appollyn / And they came to
the port Andrieu / for the wind which was contrary to them / And the blessid
Nicholas coma^ded them to dyne with him / For he would keep his people / fro
the Rauayne that they made / And whylis they were at dinner / The consul
corrupt by money had commanded three Innocent knights to ben byheded / And when
the blessed Nicholas knew this / he prayed thise iij princes that they would
much hastily goo with him / And when they came there / where they should be
byheded he fond them on their knees and blyndfeld And the righttar brandysshid
his swerd over their heedes / Then saint Nicholas enbraced with the love of
god set him hardyly against the righter / and took the swerd out of his hond /
and threw it fro him / and vnbonden the Innocentis / and ladde them with him
all sauf / And anon he went to the Judgment / to the Consul and fond the the
yates closed / which / anon he opened by force / And the Consul came ano^ and
salewed him / And this holy man having this salutacio^ in despyte said to him /
Those enemy of god corumper of the law / wherefore have thou consented to so
great evil and felonye / how dare thou look on us / And when he had sore
chyden / and repreuyd him / he repentid and at prayer of the iij princes he
receyue^ him to penance / After when the messagers of the emperor had received
his benediction / they made their geer ready and departed / and subdued their
enemies to thempyre / without shedyng of blood / And sith returned to
the emperor / and were worshypfully receyuyd / And after this it happed that
som^e other in the^perours house had envy on the weel of these three princes /
And accused them to the emperor of hye trayson / And did so much by prayer and
by yeftes / that they caused the emperor to be so full of ire / that he commanded
them to prison / And without other demand he commanded that they should be
slain that same night / And when they knew it by there kepar / they rent their
clothes and wept bytterly / And then Nepocyen remembryd him / how saint
nycholas had delyuerd the three Inncentes And admonested the other that they
should re^^yre his aid and help / and thus as they prayed saint nycholas
appiered to them / And after appiered to constantyn the emperor / and said to
him / wherefore have thou taken thise three princes with so great wrong / and have
Iuged them to death without trespaas Arise up hastily and command that they be
not executed / Or I shall pray to god that he moeue bataile against the in
which thou shall be over thrown / and shall be made mete to bestes / and
the emperor demanded what art thou that art entered by night in to my paleys /
and dare say to me such words And he said to him I am nycholas bishop of
myrre / and in like wise he appiered to the preuost and fered his / saying with
a ferdful voys / Thou that have lost mind and wit / wherefore have thou
consented to the death of Innocentis / Goo forth anon and do thy part to
deliver them / Or ellis thy body shall rote and be eten with worms / And thy
meyne shall be destroyed / And he asked him / how art you that so menace^t me /
And he answered know thou that I am Nicholas / the bishop of the cite of Mirre
/ Then that one awoke that other / and each told to other their dremes / and
anon sent for them that were in prison / To whom the emperor said / what art
magyke o^ sorcerye can ye / that ye have this night by Illusion caused us to
have such dremes / And they said / that they were none enchaunters ne knew no
witchecraft / and also that they had not deseruyd the sentence of death / Then
the emperor said to them / know ye well a man named Nicholas / And when they
herd speak of the name of the holy saint / they held up their hands toward
heuene / and prayed our lord that by the merytes of saint Nicholas they might be
delyuerd of this present peril / And when the emperor had herd of them the life
and myraclis of saint Nicholas / he said to them / Go ye forth and yield ye
thankynges to god / which has delyuereth you by the prayer of this holy man /
and worshipe ye him / and bear ye to him of your Iewellis / and pray ye him
that he thretene me nomoore / but that he pray for me and for my Royame unto
our lord / And a while after the said princes went unto the holy man / And
fylle down on their knees humbly at his feet / saying uerayly / Thou art the
sergeant of god / and the very worshypper and lover of Ihesu christ and when
they had all told this said thing by order he lift up his hondes to heaven and
gaf thankynges and praysynges to god / And sent again the princes well informed
in to their contrees / And when it pleased our lord to have him depart out of
this world / he prayed our lord that he would send him his angellis / And
enclynyng his heed he saw thaungellis come to him / whereby he knew well that
he should depart / and began this holy psalm / In te domine speraui unto In
manus tuas / And so saying lord In to thyn hondes I comende my spyrite / he
rendrid up his soul and deyde the year of our lord three honderd and xliij with
great melodye songen of the celestial company / And when he was buried in a
tomb of marble / a fontayne of oylle sprange out fro the heed unto his feet /
And unto this day holy oylle yssueth out of his body / which is much
vayllable to thelthe of sykenesses of many men / And after him in his see
succeeded a man of good and holy life / which by e^uye was put of his
bysshopriche / And when he was out of his see the oylle cessed to run / And
when he was restored again thereto / the oylle ran again /

Long after this the turks destroyed the cite of myrre / And then ca^
theder iiij knights of Bar / and iiij Monks showed to them the sepulcre of
saint Nicholas / And they opened it / And fond the bones swymyng in the oylle
/ And they bare them away honorably in to the cite of bar / in the year of our
lord Mlxxxvij /

There was a man that had borrowed of a Jew a som^e of money / And swear upon
the altar of saint Nicholas that he would render and pay it again as soon as
he might / and gaf none other pledge / And this man held this monye so long /
that the Jew demanded and axed his money / And he said that he had paid him
/ Then the Jew made him to come to fore the law in Judgment / And throth
was given to the debttour / And he brought with him an holow staff / in which
he had put the money in gold And he lent upon the staf / And wha^ he should
make his oath and swear / he delyuerd his staf to the Jew to keep and hold
whilys he should swear / And then swear that he had delyuerd to him more than
he ought to him / and when he had made the oath he demanded his staf again of
the Jew / And he nothing knowing of his malice / delyueryd it to him / Then
this deceynour went his way / and anon after him list sore to sleep / and
leyde him in the way / And a carte with iiij whelis came with great force / and
slew him / and brake the staf with gold / that it spredde a brood / And when
the Jew herd this / he came theder sore moeued / and saw the frawd And many
said to him that he should take to him the gold / And he refused it saying / but
if he that was deed / were not raised again to life by the merytes of saint
Nicholas / he would not receive it / And if he came again to life he would receive
baptesme / and become christian / Then he that was deed aroos / And the Jew
was crystened Another Jew saw the virtuous miracles of saint Nicholas / and
did do make an image of the saint / and set it in his hows / and commanded
him that he should keep well his hows when he went out And that he should keep
well all his goods saying to him Nicholas lo here be all my goods / I charge
the to keep them / And if thou keep them not well I shall avenge me on the in
betyng and tormentyng the / And on a time when the Jew was out / theuys came
and Robbed all his goods / and left unborn away only thymage / And when the
Jew came home / he fond him robbed of all his goods / he aresonned thymage
saying thyes words / Sire Nycholas I had set you in my hows for to keep my
goods fro thieves / wherefore have ye not kept them / ye shall receive sorrow
and turmentes / and shall have pain for the thieves / I shall avenge my loss and
refrain my wodnes in betyng the / And then took the Jew the image / and
beat it and turmented it cruelly / Then happed a great meruaylle / For when
the theuys departed the goods / The holy saint like as he had be in his array
apyeryd to the theuys / and said to them / wherefore have I be beten so cruelly
for you / and have so many turmentis / See how my body is hewn and broken /
See how that the read blood renneth down by my body / goo ye fast and restore
it again or ellis the ire of god almighty shall make you as to be one out of his
wit / and that all men shall know your felonnye / and that each of you shall
be honged / and they said who art thou that say to us such things / and he
said to them / I am Nicholas the servant of Ihesu Christ / whom the Jew has
so cruelly beten for his goods that ye bare away / Then they were aferde /
and came to the Jew / and herd what he had don to thymage / and they told him
the miracle / and delyuerd to him again all his goodis / And thus came the
theuys to the way of truth / and the Jew to the way of Ihesu christ /

A man for the love of his sone that went to scole for to learn / hallowed
every year the feste of saint Nicholas much solempnly / On a time hit happed
that the fader had do make ready the dinner / and called many clerkys to this
dinner / And the devil came to the yate in thabyte of a pilgrim for to demand
alms / And the fader anon commanded his sone / that he should give alms to
the pylgrym^e / he followed him as he went / for to give to him alms And
when he came to the quarf^xr / the devil caught the child and strangled him /
And when the fader herd this / he sorowed much strongly / and wept / and
bare the body in to his chamber / and began to cry for sorrow and say / right
suete sone how is it with the / saint Nicholas is this the guerdon that ye have
don to me / by cause I have so long served you / And as he said these words
and other semblable / The child opened his eyes and awoke like as he had been
aslepe / and aroos up to fore all and was raised fro death to life / Another
noble man prayed to saint Nicholas / that he would by his merits get of our
lord that he might have a sone / And promised that he would br^nge his sone to
the church / and would offer up to him a cup of gold / Then ye sone was
born and ca^ to age / and the fader coma^ded to make a cup / and the cup
plesid him much / and retained it for him self / and did do make another of
ye same value / and as they went saylyng in a ship toward the church of
saint Nicholas

And when the child would have filled the cup / he fille in to the water with
the cup / And anon was lost and ca^ no more up / yet nevertheless the fader
performed h^s auowe in weeping much tendrely for his sone / and when he ca^ to
the altar of saint Nicholas he offered the second cup / And wha^ he had
offrid it / If fyl down like as one had cast it under the altar / And he took
it up and set it again upon the altar / and then yet was cast ferther
than tofore And yet he took it up and remysed it the third time upon the
altar / And it was throwe^ again ferther than to fore of which thing all they
that were there merueylled / and men ca^ for to see this thing / And anon the
child that had fallen in the water in the sea came again prestly to fore them
all and brought in his hondes the first cup / and recounted to the people /
that anon as he was fallen in the sea / the blessed saint Nicholas came and kept
him that he had none harm / And thus his fader was glad and offrid to saint
Nicholas both the two cups / There was another rich man that by the merits
of saint Nicholas had a sone / and callid him deus dedit / god gaf / And this
rich man did do make a chapel of saint Nicholas in his dwelling place / and
did do halowe every year the feste of saint Nicholas / And this manoyr was
set by the land of Agariens / this child was taken prisoner and deputed to
serve the king / The year following and the day that his fader held devoutly
the fest of saint Nicholas / the child held a precious cup to fore the
king / And remembrid his pryse / the sorrow of his friends / and the joy that
/ that day was made in the house of his fader / And began for to sighe sore hye
/ And the king demanded him what him eyled and the cause of his sighyng / And
he told to him every word hoolly / And when the king knew it he said to him
/ what someuer thy Nicholas do or do not thou shall abide here with us / And
suddenly there blewe a much strong wind that made all the hows to tremble /
And the child was rauysshyd with the cup / and was set to fore the yate /
where his fader held the solempnyte of saint Nycholas in such wise that all
they demened great Joy / And som^e say that this child was of Normandye / and
went over see / and was taken by the sowdan / which made him often to be beten
to fore him / And as he was beten on a saint Nicholas day / and was after set
in prison / he prayed to saint Nicholas as well for his betyng that he suffered /
as for the great Joy that he was wont to have on that day of saint Nicholas /
And when he had long prayed and syghed / he fyl a sleep / And when he awoke /
he fond him self in the chapel of his fader / where as was much Joy made
for him / Late us then pray to this blessed saint / that he will pray for us
to our lord Ihesu christ / which is blessed in secula seculorum /

Amen /
Here ends the life of saint Nicholas
Here follows the Concepcion of our blessid lady
Of the Fest of the Concepcion of our blessed lady
MAria inuemsci graciam apud dominum / Luce primo capitulo / When the Aungel
gabriel had great our lady for to show to her the blessed concepcion of our
lord / For to take from her all doubts and dredes / he comforted her in
saying the words aforsaid / Marie thou have founden grace at the lord / There
ben four manner of people of which the ij ben good / And the two ben evil /
For som^e there ben that seche not god ne his grace / as people out of the believe
/ Of whom may be said as it is wreten / who that byleueth not on his lord god
shall deye perpetuelly / And other there ben that seche god and his grace / but
they find it not / For they seche it not as they ought to do / as Coueytous
men that set all their love in hauoyr / and in solace of the world / Such
people ben lykened to them that seche flowers in winter / well seche they flowers
in winter that seche god and his grace in the couetise of the world / which is
so cold of all virtues / that it quenchyth all the devotion of the love of
god / And well is called the world winter in holy scripture / For his euyllis
and vices make sinners and cold to serve god And therefore says the holy
ghoost to the soul that is amerouse / Canticorum primo capitulo / Arise up
thou my fair soul / the winter is passed / Iam enim hyemps transiit / For thou
have vaynquysshyd the temptacions of the world which kele my love / and
therefore come in to my Royame / where thou shall find deduyte / of all
flowers of the somer / there as the sinners may not come by cause they seche
not god as they ought / to do by uery repentance of heart / And therefore says
our lord Iohannis vij capitulo / Queritis et non inuenietis / Item Iohannis
octauo capitulo / (...) vo^ queritis me et in peccato moriemmj / Ye seche me
and find me not / Item Lo ye seche me / and in sin ye shall deye / The third
manner of people that seche not god / And yet nevertheless they find him / They
ben children that deye in their Innocence / and ben purged by lap^esme / Of
whom god said by his prophet / Ysaye lxiiij capitulo / Inuenerunt qui non
quesierunt me / I am founden of them that sought me not / And that is for
defaulte of Age / The fourth manner of people that seche god and find him / ben
they that set all their desire to serve god and love him / like as the
blessed vyrgyne marye that since she was in her enfancye she put her ever in the
service of god and love of him / and vowed to him chastete before all other
wymen / And therefore with right might the Aungel well say to her / Maria
inuenisti graciam apud dominum / Marye thou have founden grace at god our lord /

We find in the scripture that this gloriouse virgyne marye has founden grace
in three manners / For her coming was long before prophesied / And her birth
anunciat and showed by thaungel / And in the womb of her mother er she was born
sanctefyed and hallowed / First her coming was showed and prophesied in many
manners and by many fygures / For Balaam prophesyed Numeri vicesimoquarto
Capitulo / Orietur stella ex Jacob / et consurget virga de Israhel / That is to
say / that the virgyne marye shall be born of the lignage of Jacob patriarch it
is a custom wha^ folk will preyse a person / they will compare him to a
valyant man / like as it said comunely of an hardy man This is a right
alisaundre / And of a simple man / This is a right Job Thus Balaam the prophet
compared our lady to a sterre for three causes / First for she is aourned / and
gives beauty to all humayne creature / like as the sterre does on the
firmament / For she has opened to us the yate of perradis / like as it is
song in holy church / paradisi porta pro ^ua^ cu^ctis cla^sa ^ et per beatam
virginem mariam iterum patefacta est / The yate of paradys which by eve was
closed fro all men / is now opened by the blessed vyrgyne marye / Secondly like
as the sterre enlumyneth the night by his clerenes / In like wise the glorious
lady enlumyneth by her life all holy church / whereof holy church syngeth /
Cuius vita gloriosa lucem dedit seculo / The noble life of our lady geuyth light
to all chyrches / For as says hugo de sancto victore / O gloriouse lady For as
much as thou have engendryd a grace and glory to all manner of people unto the
deed life / to synnars grace and to captyfs pardon may be said as is said
Judith.xv capitulo / Tu gloria Iherusalem / tu leticia Israhel / tu
honorificencia etc^ / Thou art the glory of Iherusalem Thou art Joy of
Israhel thou art all the honor of our people / Thou have kept Chastete / and
therefore thou shall be blessed permanably / Capitulo eodem / Confortatum est
cortuum eo per castitatem amaueras et post virum tuum adulterium nescieris /
ideo et manus dominj confortauit te / et io^ eris benedicta in eternum / Judith
viij Ora pro nobis quoniam mulier sancta es / Item capitulo xiiij Benedicta es
etc^ / Hit was said to Judith the wedowe this that we may say to our lady
Pray for us / for ye be an holy woman ye be a daughter that is blessed of the
souerayn god above all the wymen that been on the earth / Thyrdly She is
compared to the sterre / For she has dwelled all her life steadfastly in all
works of virtue without doing any sin / like as the sterre holds him on
the firmament without descendyng to therthe / For as saint bernard says if it
were demanded to all the saints that ever have been / have ye ben without
sin / exept the gloriose virgin marye / they might answer this that is
wreton Ioh^is j capitulo / Si dix erimus quia peccatum non habemus etc^ / If we
say that we have do no sin / we deceive our self / and the truth is not
in us / This gloriouse virgyne was in the womb of her mother sanctefyed more
plainly and more specially than ever was any other / For as says saint Thomas
dalquino in compendio / there ben three manners of sanctificacions / The first is
comune and given by the sacramentis of the holy church / like as by baptesme
and other sacramentis / And these give grace / but to take away the Inclynacion
to sin dedely and venyally / nay / And this was don in the virgyne marye /
For she was hallowed and comfermed in all goodness more than ever was any
creature / like as says saint Austyn / She did never sin mortal ne venyal /
For she was so much enlumyned by the holy ghoost which descended in her /
that through the concepcion of her blessid sone Ihesu Christ / which restyd in
her ix monthis / she was so confermed in all virtues / that there abode in her
no Inclynacion of sin / And therefore the holy church does more Reverence and
honor in ordonnyng to halowe the feste of her concepcio^ / by cause this feste
is comen to the knowleche of holy church by sum miracles like as we find
redyng in this manner / Ancelme Archebysshop of Caunterburye and pastor of
England send gretyng and benediction / in our lord perpetuel / unto the
bishops that been under me / And to all them that have remembrance of the
blessed vyrgyne marye mother of god / Right dear brethern how the concepcion of
the gloryouse virgyne marye has be shewde sometime in England in france and in
other contreyes by miracles / I shall reherce to you / In the time that it
plesed to god for to correct the people of england of their euyllys and ^ynnys
and to constrayne them by his seruyse^ he gaf victory in bataylle to wylliam
the glorious duc of Normandye to win and conquer the Royame of England / And
after that he was king of the land / Anon by the help of god and of his
prudence / reformed thestates and dygnytees of holy church in to better
reformacion tha^ it had been / To which ye devil enemy unto all good works had
envy and payned tempesshe and let ye good works as well by falsenes of his
seruan^tes as by enco^bryng of his strangers / For when the danes herd say
that england was thus subgette unto the normans / Anon they made them ready to
withstonde it / when king wylliam understood this / Anon he sent thabbot of
Ramesey which was named helisius in to denmark for to know the truth / This
abbotte after that he had don well and dyligently the charge of his co^myssion /
And that he was returned a great part of the sea homward / anon aroos a great
tempeste on the sea in such wise that the cords and other habyllemens of the
ship bracke / And the maystres and governors of the ship and all they that
were therein / lost the hope and trust tescape the peril of this tempest / And
all cried deuoutely to the gloryouse vyrgyne Marye which is confoorte to
dysconforted and hope to dispayred and Recomanded them self in the keeping of
god / And anon they saw coming to fore the ship upon the water an honorable
person in habyte of a bishop / which called the said Abbot in the ship and
said to him / Wylt thou escape these peryls of the sea and goo home hole and
sauf in to thy contre / And the Abbote answered weeping / that he desired that
above all other thing / Then said thaungele to him / know thou that I am
sent hither by our lady for to say to the / that if thou wylt here me and do
there after thou shall escape this peril of the sea / The abbote promised that
gladly he would obey to that he should say / Then said the Angele Make
covenant to god and to me / that thou shall do halowe the feste of the
concepcion of our lady and of her creacion well and solempnly and that thou
shall goo and preche it / And the Abbote demanded in what time this feste should
be kept / The aungele answered to him the viij day of decembre / And the abbot
demanded him what office and seruyse he should take for the seruyse in holy
church / And the Angel answered all the office of the Natyuyte of our lady
sauf where thou say Natyuyte thou shall say Concepcion / And anon after the
Angel vanysshed away / And the tempest cessed / And the Abbote came home saufly
in to his country with his company / And notefyeed to all them that he might
/ that he had herd and seen / And right dear sirs if ye will arryue at the port
of health late us halowe devoutly the Creacion and the concepcion of the mother
of our lord / by whom we may resseyue the reward of her sone in the glory of
paradys celestial /

Hit is also otherwise declared / In the time of Charlemayne king of France
there was a clerk which was brother germayn to the king of Hongrye / which
louyd hertely the blessed vyrgyne marye / And was wont to say every day
matyns of her / and the hours / It happed that by counseyl of his friends he
took in marriage a much fair damoyseylle / And when he had wedded her / and the
pres^e had given the benediction on hem after the mass / Anon he remembryd
that that day he had not said his ours of our lady / wherefore he sent home
the bryde his wife and the people to his house / And he abode in the church
beside an altar for to say his hours / And when he came to this Antheme /
Pulcra es et decora filia Iherusalem / that is to say / thou art fair and
gracious daughter of Iherusalem / Anon appeared to fore him the gloryouse
vyrgyne marye with ij angelis on either side / and said to him / I am fair and
graciouse wherefore leuest thou me and take thou Another wife / or where have
thou seen one more fair than I am / And the clerk answered madame thy beauty
surmounteth all the beauty of the world Thou art lift up above the heuenes
and above the Angelis / what wylt thou that I do / And she answered and said if
thou wylt leave thy wife flesshely / Thou shall have me thyn espowse / in the
Royaume of heaven / And if thou wylt halowe the feste of my concepcion the eight
day of decembre / And preche it about that it may be hallowed thou shall be
crowned in the Royame of heaven / And anon therwyth our blessed lady lady
vanysshid away / Late us then pray to that glorious virgyne our lady saint
marye / that we after this short and transitorye life may be crowned in heaven in
glory celestial / to which god bring us Amen /

He ends the Concepcion of our blessid lady
The lives of the seyntes gencien fulcien and victorice
Saint Fulcien and saint vyctorice of whom yt solempnyte is hallowed / came^ fro
the cite of rome for to preche the faith of Ih^u crith in to thise parties /
and were in the cite of terwane / and preched there the faith / And they
repaired by amyens / and passed by a lytyl vylage named Sayns / and found
there a good man that byleued in god / but he was not yet baptized / and was
named ge^cien / And he salewed the^ / and said sires ye be welcome / And they
said god save you / And after he demanded the^ / what seche ye / and they
answered we seche one of our felawes called quyntyne / and he said / ha fair
sires he was but late byheedyd not long since / and sentence was given that
where such manner people might be fou^den that prechid of god / / that they
should be slain / but come ye ner and ete ye a morsel of breed / And as they
were there / a tyrant that was callid Rixionayre came with sergeants / and said
to gencien / deliver to us them that been here in / and he said / I shall not
do it / Then he he drew out his sword al naked Gencien said / they take
non head of you The tyrant Rixionaire had great anger and sorrow / and made to
take gencien and smote of his heed / And after he made to be taken saint
fulcyen and saint victoryece / and brought the^ to amyens / And said to the^
that they should forsake their god / whom they had made dye an evil death / and
they said they would not / Then he did do take broches of iron / and pute
them through their eeres / through their nosethrelles and after did do smite of
their heedes / and by ye will and power of our lord they aroos up and took their
heedes in their hondes / and bare them two mile far fro the place / where
they had been beheded / And all three were buried to gydre in that town / which
is called saint fulcien / a great rage and madness took the tirau^t Rixionaire /
and he cried through the cite of amyens all araged / Alas / Alas / Alas / Now
ben well the saints avenged on me / And since deyed foul in his wodenes / And
thus were the friends of our lord avenged on the tyrant / And by such
martirdom the glorious saints departed out of this life unto the Royame of
heaven / Theenne pray we unto the glorious martirs saint fulcien / saint
victorrice / And saint Gencien that they will pray god for us / that by their
merytes / we may have pardon and foryeuenes of our sins / Amen /

Thus enden the lives of the holy seynttes Gencien Fulcien and victorice
Here follows the lif of the blessid virgyne lucye
Lucie is said of light / And light is beauty in beholding / after that saint
Ambrose says / the nature of light is such She is gracious in beholding / She
spredeth over all without lyeng down / She passes in going right without
crokyng by right long lygne / And it is without dilacion of taryeng / And
therefore it is shewde / the blessed lucye has beauty of virgynyte without any
corrupcion / Essence of charity without disordynate love / Rightful going and
devotion to god / with out squaryng out of the way / Rightlonge line by

way of light /

Saint lucye the holy vyrgyne was born in Cecylle / and extrayt and engendered
of a noble lygnage in the cite of Syracuse / when she herd of ye good fame and
renomee of saint Agathe or Agaas which was publysshid and sprad al about /
Anon she went to her sepulcre with her mother / which was named eutice /
which had a maladye named the blody flux ^ by the space of iiij year / the
which no maistre in phisike ne in Cyrurgerye could hele / And when they were
there at a mass / One read a gospel which made menycion / of a woman which
was heled of the blody flux / by touching of the hemme of the cote of Ihesu
christ / when saint lucye herd this anon she said to her mother / Mother if ye
believe that this which is read be true / and also that saint Agathe has now
presently with her Ihesu christ / and also that for his name she suffered
martirdom / And if ye with this bileue touch her sepulcre / without doubt ye
shall be anon guarysshyd and heelid upon this they after the mess when the
people were deparded / they tweyne fyl down on their knees on the sepulcre of
saint Agatha in prayers / and weeping began to pray for her help and aid /
Saint lucye in making her prayers for her mother fylle a sleep / and she saw in
her sleep / saint agathe among thaungeles nobly aourned and arrayed with
precious stones which said thus to her / Lucye my sweet suster / devout
virgyne to god / where for prayest thou to me for thy mother / for such thing as
thou may thy self right soon give to her / For I tell ye for truth / that
for thy faith / and thy good life / thy mother is sauf and hooll / with these
words saint lucye awook all aferde and said to her mother / Mother ye be
guarisshed and all hool I / pray you for her sake / by whoos prayers ye ben
heled / That ye never make mention to me for to take an husbond ne spouse / But
all that good that ye would give me with a man / I pray you that ye will give
it to me for to do alms with all that I may come to my Savior Ih^u christ
/ Her mother answered to her / Fair daughter / thy patrymonye which I have
received this ix year sith thy fader deide / I have nothing amynyssyd / but I
have multeplyed and encresed it / but abide til I am departed out of this world
/ And then forthon do as it shall please the / Saint lucye said sweet mother
here my counseyl / he is not byloued of god that for his love gives that /
which he may not use him self / but if you wylt find god debonayr to the / give
for him that / which thou may despende for after thy death thou may in no
wise use thy goods / that which thou gyuest when thou shall dye / thou yeuest
it / by cause thou may not bear it with the / give then for gods sake
whiles thou lyuest / and as to such good as thou ought to give to me with
an husbond or spouse / begin to give all yt to pour people for the love of Ih^u
christ hereof spoke always saint lucye to her mother / and every day they gaf
alms of their goods / and when they had almost sold their patrimony and
their Jewels / tidings came to the knowleche of her spouse that should have
wedded her / and that she was promised to / the which he demanded hereof the
troth of the norice of saint lucie / and wherefore they sold thus their
patrimony / she answered cautelously / and said that they did it by cause that
saint lucye which should have been his wife / had fou^den one which had a more
fayrer and noble heritage than his was the which they would bye tofore or they
should assemble by marriage / ye fool bileued it / for he u^derstode carnally
this that ye norice had said to him spirytuelly / and help the^ to selle their
heritage / but wha^ he understood yt she gaf al for gods love / and that he
felt him self deceived / anon he complained on lucye / and made her to come to
fore a Judge named Paschasyus which was a mescreaunt and hethen man / and it
was by cause she was christian / And that she did against the law of themperours
/ Pascasius blamed her / and admonested her to worship and do sacrefise to
the ydolles / She said sacrefise which pleised god is to vysite the wydowes
and orphannes / and to help them in their need / I have not cessed these three
years passed to make to god such sacrefise / And for as mache as I have no more
of which I may make yet such sacrefice I offer to him my self / let him do /
with his offryng as it pleases him / Pascasius said / Thou myghtest say these
words unto Cryste^ people semblable to the / but to me which keep the
comandemens of themperours thou say them in vayn / Saint Luchye said / if
thou will keep the law of thy lords / I shall keep the law of god / Thou
doubtest to anger them And I shall keep me that I anger not my god / Thou will
playse them / And I coueyte only to playse our lord Ihesu christ / Pascasius
said / Thou have despended thy patrymonye with the Rybauldes / And therefore
thou spekest thus as a rybaulde / She said I have set my patrymonye in a /
sure place / unto the corrupcion of my heart ne body I never agreed ne suffered
it / Pascasius said who ben they that corrupt the heart and the body / She
said / ye be that corrupt the hertes / of whom thappostle said / The evil
words corrupt the good manners / ye counseylle the sowles to forsake their
creator / and tensyewe the devil / in making sacrefise to the ydolles / The
corrupteurs of the body ben they / that / love the short delectacions corporal
/ and despyte delytes spyrytuell / that endure ever / Pascasius said these
words that thou say shall fynysshe / when thou shall come to thy pains / She
said / the words of god may not end ne fynysshe / Pascasius said / how then
art thou god / She said I am the handmayde of god / and for so much I say
they be the words of god / For he says ye be not they that speak to fore the
princes and Iuges / but the holy ghoost speaks in you / Pascasius said and
therefore / the holy ghoost is in the / She said / Thappostle says that they ben
the temple of god that live chastely and the holy ghoost dwells in them
Pascasius said / I shall do bring the to the bourdel / where thou shall lose thy
chastyte / And then the holy ghoost shall depart fro the / She said / the
body may take no corrupcion / but if the heart and will give thereto assentyng /
For if thou made me to do sacrefyce by my hands by force / to the ydollis
against my will / god shall take it only but a derision For he Iugeth only of the
will and consentyng / And therefore / if thou make my body to be defowled
without mine assente / and against my will / my chastete / shall encreace double
to the merit of the crown of glory / Thing that thou do to the body
which is in thy power / that bears no prejudice to the handmayde of Ihesu
christ / Then commanded pascasius that the ribauldes of the town should come /
to whom he deliuerd saint lucye saying / Call other to you for to defoule her
/ and labor her so much till that she be deed / Anon the rybauldes would have
drawn her from thens where she was / and have brought her to the bourdell /
But the holy ghoost / made her so peysaunt and heavy / that in no wise they
might move her fro the place / wherefore many of the servants of Judge put
hand to for to draw with the other / And she abode stylle / Then they bond
cords to her hands and feet / and all drew / but she abode alleway stylle as
a mo^tayne without moeuyng Whereof pascasius was al anguysshous and angry / And
did do call his enchaunters / which might never moeue her for all
enchaunterye / Then pascasius / did do yoke for her oxen many for to draw
her / And yet they might not move her / fro the place / Then Pascasius
demanded her / For what reason might it be / that a fraylle maid might not
bedrawen ne moeuyd by a thousand men / She said it is the work of god / And if
thou set thereto yet ten thousand they should not moeue me / Of these words
the Judge was sore tormented / And saint lucye said to him / wherefore tormentest
thou thy self thus / if thou have preued and assayed that I am the temple of
god believe it if you have not assayed / learn to assaye / And hereof was the Judge
more tormented / For he saw that she made but her mocquery with him / Wherefore
he did do make about saint lucye / a right great fire / and made to be cast
on her pytche Rosyn and boyllyng oylle / and she abode all stylle to fore the
fire / and said / I have prayed to Ihesu Christ that this fire have no domynacion
in me to the end that the christian men that believe in god / make of the their
derysion / And have prayed for respyte of my martirdom / for to take away fro
the christian men the feer and dread to dye for the feith of Ihesu christ / And to
take away fro the mescreaunts the auauntyng of my martirdom / The friends of
the Judge saw that he was confused by the words of saint lucye / and of the
drawyng much greatly tormented / and therefore they roof a swerd through her
throat / And yet for all that she deyde not anon / but spack to the people
saying / I adnounce and show to you that holy church shall have peace / For
dyoclesyen the Emperor which was enemy to holy church / is this day put out
of his seignourye / And maximie^ his felawe is this day deed / And in like wise
as saint Agathe is patroness and kepar of cathanence / In the same wise shall I
be commysed to be patroness of siracusane this cite / And as she spack thus to
the people / The sergeantes and mynystres of Rome came for to take pascasius and
bring him to rome / by cause that he was accused to fore the senators of Rome
/ of that he had Robbed the prouynce / wherefore he resseyued his sentence of
the senate / And had his heed smyten of / Saint lucye never remeuid fro the
place where she was hurt with the swerd / ne deyde not till the priest came / and
brought the blessed body of our lord Ihesu christ And as soon as she had received
the blessed sacrament / she rendered and gaf up her soul to god / thankyng and
preysyng him of all his goodness / In that same place is a church edefyed in
the name of her / where as many benefetes ben given to thonour of our lord Ih^u
crist / which is blessed world wythouten end / Amen

Here follows the life of saint Nychase /
IN that time that the wandles wasted and destroyed many cytes and lands /
they came to the cite of reins in france in which cite saint nychase was
arche bishop / he preached the faith of Ihesu christ and conforted the people /
and admonested them to receive in patience the persecucion of the wandles
which then had destroyde the contraye and land all about the cite / and
as this people called wandles approached the cite / The folk came to
tharchebisshop and demanded counseyl if they should yield them / or go and
fight for the cite / Saint nychase to whom god has showed to fore that the
wandles came / that all the cite should be destroyde / Impetred and had grant of
our lord that this tribulacion and this death should be to the health of the
souls of them / that to their power should be repentau^t / of their sins /
and sithe said to them / late us goo surely to the peril of death / And let us
abide the mercy of god / I am ready to set my soul for my people / late us
preye for our enemies / and late us desire of their souls like as of our own
/ Thus as he spoke to the people / saint eutroppe his suster exorted / as much
as she might the people to receive martordom which was ready / after thorysons
and thensygnementes that they had made to the people they issued out against the
wandles / Ande saint nychase said to them if ye will slay my people / slay me
first tofore / And after he preached to them the faith of Ih^u christ and taught
them how they might be saved / but they would not understand it / then the
holy man set him to prayer / And whiles he prayde / his enemies smote of his
head / and after that the head was smeton offe / he made an end of his prayer
and said in his tongue this verse of the sauter / adhesit panimento etc^ when
saint eutrope saw her brother martred / And saw that noman made him ready to be
martred / but stroof / for her beauty / she ran to him / that had slain her
brother / And would have cratched his eyes out of his heed / And anon she was
martrid and many other with her / Then the wandles saw a great company of
cheualrye of heaven come for tauenge the great felonye that they had don / and
herd a great soun in the church / And they had so great fere and dread / that
they left all their Armures / and fled / And there appiered a great light and
clernes upon the bodies / that it was seen far by night then came again
som^e burgeyses of them that had fled and saw the clerenes / and felt a great
odor about the martirs / and buried the^ about the cite / And thanked our
lord / and served him more perfyghtly than they had don before / late us pray
then to the holy saint Nichase / and to saint Eutroppe that they will get us
grace of our lord / that they bring us in to their company / Amen /

Thus ends the life of saint Nychase
And here begins the life of saint Thomas thappostle
THomas is as much to say as abysme / or double / which in greece is said
didimus / or ellis / Thomas is said of Thomos / which is said dyuysion / and
departing / he was abysme or swolowe by cause he deserved to perse the depnes
of dyuynyte / when at his Interrogacion Ihesu christ answered to him / Ego sum
via veritas and vita / I am the way / truth and life / he is said double / by
cause he knew christ in his resurrection in double these more than other knew
/ For they knew him but only in seeing / but Thomas knew him both seeing and
feelyng / he is said dyuysyon or departing / for he departed his love fro the
love of the world / And was departed fro the other appostles at Resurrection
/ Or Thomas is said / as appeared again / that is in the love of god by
contemplacion / he had three things in him / of which prosper says in the
book of the soul / contemplatyf / and demands what it is for to love /
nothing but for to conceive the brennyng of him in his thought / and the
talente of god / and hate of sin / and to forsake the world / Or Thomas is as
much to say / as always going in the love and contemplacion of god / Or thomas
is as much as my god by cause he said / when he touched the side of our lord /
my god and my lord



Saint Thomas wha^ he was in Cezaree / our lord appiered to him and said / The
king of ynde gondeforus has sent his provost Abanes for to seche men that
can well the craft of masons / And I shall send the to him / and saint Thomas
said / Sire send me oueral / sauf to them of ynde / And our lord said to him
/ goo thy way theder surely for I shall be thy kepar / and when thou have
converted them of ynde thou shall come to me by the crown of martirdom And
Thomas said to him / thou art my lord / And I thy servant / thy will be
fulfyllid / And as the provost went through the market / our lord said to him /
young man what will thou bye / And he said my lord has sent me / for to bring
to him som^e that be learned in the science of masonrye / that they might make
for him a palace after the work of Rome / And then our lord delivered to him
saint Thomas thappostle / and told to him that he was much expert in that
work / and they departed and saylled til they came in a cite / where the king
made a weddyng of his daughter / And had do cry / that all the people should
come to this feste of this marriage / or ellis he would be angry / And it so
happed that the provost and thomas went thither / And an hebrewe maid had a
pype in her hand / And preysed euerich with som^e lawde or preysyng / And when
she saw the apposthe / she knew that he was an hebrewe / by cause he ete not
/ but had always his eyes ferme to ward heaven / And as the maid song to fore
him in hebrewe she said / The god of heaven is one only god / the which created
all things and founded the sees / And thappostle made her to say these words
again / And the botyller beheld him and saw that Thomas ete not / ne drank
not / but always looked upward to heaven / and he came to thappostle / and smote
him on the cheke / And thappostle said to him / that in time to come it be
pardonned to the / and and that now a wound transitorye be given to the / and
said / I shall not arise fro this place / till the hand that has smeton me be
eten with dogs / And anon after the boteler went for to fetch water at
awelle / and there a lion came and slew him and drank his blood / and the
hounds drew his body unto pieces / in such wise that a black dog brought
the right arm in to the halle in the myddle of the dinner / And when they saw
this / all ye company was abashed / And the maid remembered the words / and
threw down her pype or floyte / and fylle down at feet of thappostle / And
this vengeance blames saint austyn in his book of faustyn / and says that
this was set in of sum falls prophets For this thing might be suspecyonnous
unto many things / Whether it be true or no / it apperteyneth not to me / but
I wot ^ well that they should be like as our lord techeth / which says / if
any man smyteth the on that one cheke / show and offer to him that other / And
certainly thappostle held within his / courage the will of god / and of
dilection / And without forth he / required example of correction / This says
saint Austyn / and then at the request of the king thappostle blessed them
that were new married and said / lord god give to thise children the blessyng of
thy right hand / and set in their minds the seed of life / / And when
thappostle was goon / there was found in the hond of of the young man that was
married a branch of palm full of dates / And when he and his wife had eten of
the fruit / they fill a sleep / and they had one semblable dreme / For them
seemed that a king aourned with precious stones enbraced them and said / mine
appostle has blessid you / in such wise that ye shall be partioners of the
glory perdurable / Then they awoke and told to each other their dreme / And
then thappostle came to them and said / my king has apperid right now to
you / and has brought me hither the doors being shette / so that my blessyng
may be fruytful upon you / And that ye may have the surenesse of your flesh /
the which is queen of all virtues / and fruit of perpetuel health / And above
thanngeles possessions of all good / victory of lecherye lord of the faith /
disco^fiture of deuyllis And surete of Joys perdurable / lecherye is engendered
of corrupcion / And of corrupcion comes pollucion / and of pollucio^ comes
sin / And of sin is confusion engendered / And he thus saying / ij angeles
appiered to them and said / we ben the two angeles deputed for to keep you /
And if ye keep well all thadmonestemens of thappostle / we shall offer to god all
your desires / And then thappostle baptized them / and informed them
diligently in the faith / And long time after / the wife named pelagene was
sacred with a veyl and suffered martirdom / And the husbond named denis was
sacred bishop of that cite / And after this thapostle and albane came unto the
king of ynde / And the king devised to thappostle a merueyllous pallais / and
delyured to him great tresour / And the king went in to another prouynce /
And thappostle gaf all the tresour to pour people / And thappostle was aleway
in predicacio^s / two year or there about er the king came / and converted much
people without no^bre to the faith / And when the king came / and knew what he
had don / he put him and abanes in the most depest of his prison / And purposed
fully to flee them and brenne / And in the mean while Gaath brother of the
king deyde / And there was made for him a Rich sepulcre / And the fourth day he
that had been deed aroos fro death to life and all men were abashed and fled
And he said to his brother / this man that thou entendest to flee and brenne is
the friend of god / And thau^gelles of god serve him / and they brought me in
to paradis / and have showed me a palace of gold and silver and of precious
stones / and is merueyllously ordained / And when I merueylled of the great
beauty thereof / they said to me / this is the palace that thomas has made for
thy brother / And when I said that I would be thereof portyer / They said to me /
thy brother is made unworthy to have it / if thou will dwell therein / we shall
pray god to reyse the so that thou may goo bye it of thy brother / in gyuyng
to him the money / that he had supposed he had lost And when he had said this
/ he ran to the prison / and required of thapostle that he would pardonne his
brother that he had done to him / And then delyuerd him out of prison / and
prayed thappostle that he would take and do on him a precious vesture / And
thappostle said to him / know thou not that they which wene to have power
in things celestial / set naught in no thing flesshely ne erthly / And when
thappostle issued out of prison the king came against him / and fylle down at his
feet / and required of him pardon / Then thappostle said to him god has
given to you much great grace / when he has showed to you his secrets / now
believe in Ihesu christ / and be ye baptized / to the end that thou be prince in
the Royame perdurable / And then the brother of the king said / I have seen
the palace that thou have do made to my brother / And I am comen for to bye it
/ And thappostle said to him / if it be the will of thy brother it shall be don
/ And the king said sith it playseth god this shall be mine And thappostle shall
make to the another / And if perauenture he may not this same shall be common to
the and to me / And thappostle answered and said many palayses ben there in heaven
which ben made ready since the beginning of ye world / that been bought by prys of
the faith / and by almesses of your rychesses / which may well goo to fore you
/ to these palayses / but they may not follow you / And after this at end of
a month / thappostle made tassemble all them of the prouynce / And when they
were assembled / he commanded that the fell and seek should be set a part by
them self / then he prayed for them / And they that were well enseigned and
taught saiden ame^ And forthwith came a clear light fro heaven / which descended
upon them / and smote down all the people and thappostle to therthe / and
supposed they had been smeton with thondre / and so lay by the space of half an
hour / After thapposthe aroos and said / Arise ye up / for my lord is come as
thondre and has heled us / And anon they aroos all hole / and gloryfyed god
and thapostle / Then began thappostle to teache them / and to show to them
the degrees of virtue / The first is that they should believe in god which is
one essence / and treble or three in persons / And showed to them examples
sensible / how three persons ben in one essence / The first example in a man is
wisdom / And thereof comes understanding / memory and connyng / Connyng is
of that thou have learned the memory or mind / And reteynest that thou
sholdest forgete / And the understanding is that thou vndersto^dest this that
is taught to the and showed / ^ The second example is that in a vigne ben three
things / the stock the leef and the fruit / the third example is that three
things ben in the heed of a man / heeryng / seeing / and tastyng or smellyng /
The second degree / that they receive baptesme / The third that they keep them
fro fornicacion / The fourth that they keep them fro avarice / The fyfthe that
they restrain them fro glotonye / The sixth that they keep their penance /
The seventh that they parseuere and abide in these things / The eight that
they love hospytalyte / The nynthe that in things to be don they require the
will of god / and that they require such things by works / The tenthe yt
they eschew tho things that been not for to be don / The enleuenth that they
do charity to their enemies and to their frendys / The twelft that they keep
charity / and to work by dyligence to keep these things / And after his
predicacion forty thousand men were baptized without wymen and small children
/ And in continent he went in to the great ynde / where he shone by miracles
Innumerable / For he enlumyned and made to see Syntice the friend of Migdone
which was wife of Carisyen cosyn of the king of ynde / And Mygdone said to
Syntice / wenest thou / that I may see him Then Mygdone changed her habyte
by the counseyll of Syntice / and put her self among the pour wymen / and came
where as thappostle preached / And he began to preche of the maleurte and
unhappiness of this life / And said that this life is unhappy / wretchyd / and
subgette to auentures / And is so sleper / and fleeyng that when one weneth to
hold it / it flees away / and after (...) began to show to them by iiij
Raysons / that they should gladly here the word of god / And lykeneth it to
four manner of things / First unto a color / which lights the eye of our
understanding / Secondly to a Syrope or a purgation / For the word of god
purges our affection fro all flesshely love / Thirdly unto an emplastre by
cause it heleth the wounds of our sins / And fourthly unto mete by cause the
word of god nourisshith us and delyteth in heavenly love / And in like manner
like as all these things auaylle not to the seek man but if he take and
receive them / In like wise the word of god prouffyfiteth nothing to
languysshyng seek man / if he hiere it not devoutly / And as thappostle thus
preched Migdone byleued in god and refused the bed of her husbond / Then
Carisien did so much that he made the appostle to be set in prison / And
mygdone went to him and axid him foryeuenes / by cause he was set in prison
for her sake / And he comforted her swetely / and said he would suffer it
debonayrly / And then Carisien prayed the king / that he would send the queen
his wives suster unto her For to assaye if she might torn her / and call her
again fro the christian faith / And the queen was sent theder / and when she
saw and knew of so many miracles as thappostle did / She said they be
accursed of god that believe not in his works / Then thappostle taught them
shortly that were there four things / First that they should love the church
/ honor and worship the preestis / Assemble them often in prayers / And
often to here the word of god / And when the king saw the queen he said to her
/ why have thou abyden there so long / And she then answerde / I had
supposed that Mygdone had been a fool / but she is right wise / For she has
brought me to thappostle / which has made me to know the way of truth /
And they be ouermoche fools that believe not the way of truth / That is to
say that they believe in Ihesu christ / And never after would the queen lie with
the king / And then the king was abashed and said to his cosyn / wha^ I
would have recouerd thy wife / I have lost mine / And my wife is werse to me /
than thine is to the / Then the king commanded that thapostle should be
brought to fore him his hondes and feet bounden / And was commanded that he
should / reconcile the wives to their husbondes / And then thappostle said to
ye king / in showing to him by three examples that as long as he should be in
the error of the faith they ought not obey them / That is to wit by example
of the king / by example of the tour / And by example of the fontayne / And
said to him / thou that art king / wylt have no seruyces soylled ne fowll /
but thou have clenly servants / and net chambryeres / and what wenest you /
god loves chastyte / and clean seruyces / Am I then to blame / if I preche
to the to love god and his servants whom he loves / I have made them clean
servants to him / I have founded a towr / and thou say to me that I should
destroy it / Also I have doluen in the deep earth and have brought forth a
fontayn out of thabysme / And thou say I should stop it / Then the king
was angry / and commanded to bring forth pieces of iron brennyng / And made to
set thappostle on them all naked his feet bounden / And anon by the will of
our lord / a fontayne of water sourded and sprange up / and quenchid it all /
And then the king by the counseyl of his cosyn made him to be set in a
fornays bre^nyng / which was so made cold / that the next day he issued out
all sauf without harm And then said Carisien to the king / Make him to
offer sacrefyse to one of the gods only in such wise / that he fall in the
ire of his god that thus delyuerith him / and as they constrained him thereto /
he said / king / thou art nothing more noble / ne more mighty than ben thy
payntours / And how despysest thou very god / and worshipest a payntyng / whom
thou wenest to be thy god / like as Carisien has said to the / that my god
should be angry / when I had worshipped thy god And if he be angrid / it should
be more to thy god than to me / For when thou sholdest wene / that I worshipped
thy god / I should worshipe mine / And the king said why spekest thou to me
such words / And then thappostle commanded in hebrewe the deuylle that was
within the ydole / that as soon as he knelyd to fore thydolle / he should anon
break it in pieces / And the appostle kneled and said / loo see ye that I
worship / but not thydolle I adoure / but not the metal / I worship / but
not the false image / But I honor and worship my lord god Ihesu christ / In
the name of whom / I comande the devil / which art hid within this image
that thou break this false ydolle And anon he malte it as wax / And then the
prestes came as bestes / And the bishop of the temple lift up a glayue / And
run thappostle through and said I shall avenge thyniurye of my god / And the
king and Carisien sledde away / For they saw that the people would avenge
thappostle / and brenne the bishop all ^uyk / And the christian men bare away
the body of thappostle / and buried it worshypfully / Long time after about
the year of our lord CC and xxx / the body of thappostle was born in to Edisse
the cite / which some time was said Rages Cite of mede / And Alysandre
the emperor bare it theder / at the request of the Syryens / And in this cite
noma^ might herberowe Jew ne payneme / ne tyrant that should live / After this
Abagar king of this cite deserved to have a pystle wreton with the hand of
our lord / For if any men moeued war against this cite / they took a christian
child and set him on the yate / and he should read there the epistle / And the
same day what for the virtue of the writing of our savior / as for the merytes
of thappostle / The enemies fled / or ellis made peace / Ysydore in the book
of the life of saints / says thus of this appostle / Thomas appostle and
dyscyple of our lord Ihesu christ and like unto our savior preached the gospel
unto in escreantes / to them of perce and of mede / to the hyrcyens / and to
the brachyens / And he entryng in to the parties of thoryent / percyd through
thentreylles of the people / There demened his predicacion unto the title of
his passion / And there was he percid through with a glayue / and so deyde And
Crysostomus says that when thomas came in to the parties of the three kings /
which came to worship our lord / he baptized them / and they were made
helpers and ayders of our lord and of christian feith / Pray we then to this
holy Apostle saint Thomas / that he will be moyen unto our lord that we may
have grace of him to amend us in this present life / that we may come in to his
everlasting bliss Amen

Here follows the lif of saint Anastaise
Saint anastaise was daughter to a gentyl man of the Romans / but he was a
paynem / her mother which was christian was taught and informed in the faith by
saint grysogone / the foresaid saint anastayse was married unto a paynem named
Papillon but she feigned her alleway to be seek / in such wise that she came not
in his co^pan^^ ^ She went vysytyng the christian prysonners / that were in
diverse prysons in pouerte and foul clothyng And she admynystred to them such
thing as they neded of her good / And therefore her husbonde made her to be
straytly kept in such wise that she had nothing to ete / And so would slay her
/ and all by cause he would with her good make his pride and Iolytees / Then
the lady that well supposed to have deyed / sent often lettres to saint
Grysogone / And the holy saint recomforted her by his lettres as well as he
might / Now it happed in the mean while her husbonde deyde / Then she was
delyuerd fro prison / She had three damoyselles which were susters that served
her / whom she had informed and taught that they should not renye their faith ne
their good life / for any menaces ne thretenynges that the provost should do /
The provost on a day came to them for to draw them to him / And saint Anaistase
did do hide them in her kychene / The prouoste went after for taccomplysshe
his Rybawdrye / And they kneled down and prayde their prayers / in such wise
that the prouoste lost his wit / And when he supposed to have taken enbraced
and holden them / he embraced pottes pannes and the cawdrons and kyssed the^ in
such wise that he was so foul horrible and black / that when he issued out /
his meyne that awayted his coming supposed that he had been out of his wit /
And they beat him well and after fled fro him for feer / and left him there
allone / And he went for to complain him unto the emperor And when he came to
the yate / the sergeants that saw him so black and smotted / beat him well with
rods / and cratchyd him in the vysage / and held him for wood / And the
caytyf knew not that he was so foull and blak And therefore he meruaylled much
more / why they did to him somoche shame where to fore they did to him
somoche honor / And he had supposed that he had be clad in a white robe / when
they told him how he was arrayed / then he supposed the maidens had enchaunted
him / And sent for them and would have despoylled them all naked to fore him
/ by cause he might see and behold them and ease him of his lecherye / but
their clothes were anon so fast glewed to their bodies / that in no wise they
might be take of ne despoylled / And then he fylle a sleep and rowted so fast
that noman might awake him / At the last these three vyrgyns were martred and
suffered death / And saint Anastayse was given unto another man a provost / upon
this condition / that if he might make her sacrefye unto the ydolles / he should
have her to his wife / And when she was brought in to his chamber / and would
have embraced her / be becam blind / And sith made his pylgremage to his
gods / for to know if he might be heled thereof / and they said to him / by
cause that thou haste angered saint Anastayse / thou art given to torments /
and shall be alleway with us / And when he returned and was comen home unto his
hows / he deyed suddenly among the hands of the sergeans / Then the emperor
delyuerd saint Anastaise to another prouoste / he came to the saint and said to
her / I wot well / that thou art christian / And if thou wylt do as thy god
says / I shall late the goo / and do what thou will / For thy god says but if
one renounce all that he has may not be my dysciple / Then renounce / and
give to me all that thou have and goo thy way / Saint Anastaise a^wersde Ihesu
Christ says that we should give unto the pour / and not to the Rich / Then
if I gave to the I should do against the commandment of god / Then the provost
did do set her in prison / And deffended that any man should give to her any
mete / Then god sent to her substance of mete fro heaven ij months during
/ After that she was sent in exyle with two hundred vyrgyns in to an isle /
where as many crystenys were exyled / After that / it was not long time / but
the prouoste remaunded and sent again for saint anastaise / And did do brenne
her the year of thyncarnacion of our lord two hundred and iiij score / / And
made the other to deye / by diverse torments Emo^ge whom there was one / fro
who^ was taken much good And alleway she said / at leest ye may not take fro
me Ihesu christ / Appolyne which was a crystyn woman / took the body of saint
Anastaise / and buried it in her gardyn / And there did do make a fair chrche /
Late us pray then unto all mighty god that by the prayer and merytes of
saint Anastayse we may come unto his everlasting bliss ame^

Thus ends the life of saint Anastaise
Here follows of saint Eugene
EUgenia the noble virgyne / which was daughter to phelippe duc of Alysaundre
/ which for the emperor of Rome governed all the land of egypt / Eugenye
issued pryuely out of her faders palace / with two servants / And she went
in to an abbaye in thabyte and array of a man / in wihche abbaye she led so
holy a lif that at last she was made abotte of the same / It happed so that
noman knew that she was a woman / yet there was a lady acused her of aduoultrye
to fore the Judge which was her owen fader Eugene was put in prison for to be
Iuged to death / At last to her fader much thing / for to draw him to the
faith of Ihesu christ / She rent her cote / and showed to him that she was a
woman / and daughter of him that held her in prison / And so she converted her
fader unto the christian faith / And was after an holy bishop / And at the hour
that he sange his mass he was byheded for the faith of Ihesu christ / And the
lady that had falsely accused Eugene / was breute with fire of hell with all
her pa rtye / And after that / Claudia and her children came to Rome / And much
people were by them converted / And many vyrgyns by eugene / which eugene was
much turmented in diverse manners / And at last by the sword accomplysshyd
her martirdom^ / And thus made she offryng of her propre body / to our lord
Ihesu Christ qui est benedictus in secula seculorum Amen /

Thus ends of saint Eugene
Here follows the life of saint Stepphen rothomartir
Stephen is as much to say in greek / as crowned / and in hebrewe / example
to other for to suffer / Or stephen is as much to say as nobly and trewly
spekyng / techyng and gouernyng / or as a friend and hole come^ / And he was
deputed of thappostles to keep the wydowes / Then he was crowned / For began
first to be a martyr / Example / for thensample of his patience and good lif /
nobly spekyng / for right noble predicacio^ / and well gouernyng for the good
enseignem^as and techyng of wydowes /

Saint stephen was one of the vij dekenes in the mysterye of thappostles / For
when the nombre grew of people co^uertyd / som^e began to murmr against the
Jews yt were co^uertyd by cause yt the wydowes and wives of the^ were refused
to serve / or by cause they were more grieved every day than the other in
seruyse / For thappostles did this by cause they should be more ready to preche
the word of god / when thappostles saw their great murmr / they assembled
the^ all to gydre and said / It is not right yt we leave the word of god for
tadmynystre and serve at the tables / and the tables / and the gloss says /
that the fedyng of the soul / is better that the mete of the body / And
consydere ye fair brethern men of good renomee among you that been re^lenesshid
with the holy ghoost and of wisdom / what we shall establysshe upon this work /
so that they admynystre and serve / And we shall be in prayer and prechyng / And
this word plesed to them all / And they chaas vij men / of whom the blessed
stephen was the first and the maistre / And since he brought them to
thappostlis / And they set their hands upon them / and ordained the^ / And
stephen full of grace and of strength made great demonstrances and great signs
to the people / Then the Jews took him / and would surmounte him in desputyng
/ and assaylled for to overcome him in three manners / that was by bryngyng
wytnessis / by disputacions / and by torments / And in euerich of them / was
aid and help given to him fro heaven / in the first the holy ghoost
admynystred his words / in the second the flight of Angellis fered the false
witnessys / In the third he saw Ilesu christ ready to help him / which
conforted him to his martirdom / in every bataylle he had three things /
thassault in bataylle / the aid given / and the victory / And in aduysyng and
beholding shortly thystorye / we may well see all these things / As the
blessed Stephen did many things and preched often to the people / the Jews
made the first bataylle to him / For to overcome him by dysputacions / And
som^e aroos of the synagoge called libertyns of a region so named / or of them
that were the sons of them that had been in bondage / and were made free / And
thus they that first repugned against the faith were of a bond and thral
lygnage / And also they of cyrenence / and alexandrynes and of them that were
of cilyce and asye / all thyes desputed with Stephen / This was the first
bataylle / and then (...) puts the victory after / and they might not
resist his wysdom / For the holy ghoost spack in him / and then they saw
that by this manner they might not overcome him / they returned malyciously /
And at second time / by cause they might overcome by false witnessis they
brought two false wytnessis for thaccuse him of iiij blames / And brought him
to the Judgment / And then the false men Accused him of iiij things / that
was of blasphemyng of god / in the law of moses / in the tabernacle / and in
the temple / and this was the second bataylle / And then all they that were
in Judgment saw the face of saint stephen like the face of an aungele / and
this was by the help of god and this was the victory of the second bataylle /
For when the false witnesses had all said / the prince of the prestes said to
him / what say thou / Then saint stephen excused by order of all that /
which the false witnessys had said And first of the blasphemyng of god saying
/ God that spack to our faders and prophets / that is god of glory / and
preysed him in three things after this word glory / which is expowned right
swetly / The god of glory is gyuer of glory / as it is said in the book of
kings / who someuer shall see my name / I shall gloryfye him / The god of glory
may be said conteynyng glory / as is said in the prouerbys / the viij chapter
/ Rychesses and glory ben with me the god of glory that is to whom glory is
due / And thus preysed he god in three manners / in that he is glorious /
gloryfyeng / and to be gloryfyed / And after he excused him of the blame in
moses / in praysyng him much and especyally in three things / that is to wit
of fervor of love / For he slew thegypcien that smote thebriew / And of the
miracles that he did in egypt or deserte / And of the famyliaryte of god /
when he spack to him many times amyably / And after this he excused him of the
third blame that was in the law / in preysyng the law in three manners / First
by cause of the gyuer / that was god the second of the mynystre which was
moses that was a great prophet / And the third by cause of the end / For it
gives life perdurable / And after he purged him of the blame of the tabernacle
and of the temple / In preisyng the tabernacle in iiij manners / one was by
cause he was commanded of god to make it / And was showed in vision it was
accomplysshed by moses / and that the arc of wytnes was therein / and he said
that the temple succeeded tabernacle / And the blessed Stephen purgyd him of
that which was ^yde to him / of which the Jews saw yt they might not
overcome him in that manner / And then they took the third bataylle against
him / that they should surmounte him by tormentis / And when the blessed saint
stephen saw this / he would keep the commandment of our lord / and enforced him
to refrain them in three manners / that was by shame / by dread / and by love /
First by shame in blamyng the hardness of their hertes / And said to them ye
contrary alleway the holy ghost by your hard heedes / and hertes not pyteous
like as your fadres that persecuted the prophets and slew them that shewde
the coming of god / And the gloss says that in three manners they were malycyous
/ The first that they contrary den to the holy ghoost / The second that they
persecuted the prophets / The third that by their evil malyco / they slew
Jesus christ but by cause they were like the common woman / they could have no
shame to leave their malice / but when they had herd these things / they
wythsayde it in their hertes and grennyd their teeth against him / After this he
corrected them by dread / by cause that he said / that he saw Ih^u christ on
the right side of god / like as ready to help him / and condemn his
adversaries / For saint stephen which was full of the holy ghoost looked up and
byheld the heaven / and saw the glory of god / And said loo I see the heuenes
opene / and the sone of ye maid stondyng on ye right side of the virtue of god
/ and how be it yt he corrected the^ by shame and by dread / yet they left not
their malice but were more werse tha^ to fore and stopped their eeris / to
the^de yt they would not here him / whereof he blamed them / And they cried with
an hye voys / and made a great assault against him / and cast him out of the
cite all to gydre / and stoned him / And they supposed to have done after their
law as a blasphemour / in comandyng that he should be stoned out of the
castellis / And thyes ij false witnessis / which after their law ought to cast
the first stone / took of their clothes / by cause that they should not be
touched of god and to the end that they might better and lyghtlyer bywelde them
to stone him / and they left them at feet of a child that then was callid
saulus / and after he was called paul / And thus he kept the clothes of them
that stoned him / And he was stoned of them all And when he might not
withdraw them fro their malice / ne by shame ne by dread / he took the third
manner / so that he would withdraw them by love and the love that he showed them
was not lytyl / when he prayed for him and for them that his passion might not
be dyffered / And that the sin should not be Imputed do them that stoned him /
and saying lord Ihesu christ receive my spyrite / And when he was on his knees
he cried with an hye voys and said / lord establysshe not to them this sin /
And this was a meruayllous love / when he prayed on his knees for them that
stoned him / like as if he had prayed more for them than for him sylf / For he
desired to be more empesshed for the^ than for him self / And as the gloss
says / he knelyd / for by cause he ought the more humbly to pray for them /
of whom thynyquyte was great / And in this he did / as did Ihesu christ / For
in his passion he prayed for him self / And said / Fader I comande my spyryte in
to thyn hondes / and he said for them that stoned him / Fader foryeuene it
them / And when saint stephen had so said he slepte in our lord and was not
deed / For he suffered sacrefyse of dylection / And after slepte in hope of
resurrection /

And the stonyng of saint stephen was made in the same year / that our lord
ascended up in to heaven in the next month of august / the third day entryn^
And saint Gamalyel and Nycodemus which were among the connseyllys of the Jews
for the christian men buried him in the field of gamalyel / and made great weeping
for him / and then was great persecucio^ of christian me^ that were in Ihrl^m /
For when the blessed saint stephen / which was one of the princes was slain /
they began to persecute all the christian me^ / in so much that thappostles
which were strenger than other in the faith departed out of all the prouynce
of the Jews / after that / which our lord had commanded to the^ / if they
persecute you in one cite / flee you in to another / And the blessed doctor
saint austyn reherceth / that the blessed saint stephen was noblysshid by many
miracles / For he raised by his merytes six deed bodies and heled many that
were seek of diverse maladyes and languors And without this recounteth he
other miracles / worthy and dygne to be remembrid / For as he says in the
xxiiij book of the cite of god the flowers that were put on the aultre of saint
stephen / were put on the seek men / and anon they were cured and heled / And
the clothes taken fro the altar and leyde on the^ that were seek / were a
medecyne to many For as it is said in the xxiiij chapter of the chronicles of
god / these flowers taken upon the altar of saint stephen were leyd on the
eyes of a woman that was blind / and anon she had again her sight / And also
said he in the same book / that a man that was maistre of a cite and was named
marcial / and was a paynem and would not be converted / and it happed that he
was strongly seek / and his sone in law that was a right good man / and came in
to the church of saint stephen / and took of the flowers / and leyd under the
heed of his lord / and anon wha^ he had slepte thereupon on the mornyg he cried
that ye bishop should be brought to him / and the bishop was not in the town /
but the priest came to him and bad him to believe in god and baptized him / and
euyr as long as he lived after he had alleway in his mouth / Ihesu christ
receive my spyrite / and yet he wist not ye tho words were the words that
saint stephn last spack And also he reherceth another miracle in the same place
that a lady called patron had been seek much grievously and had souht many
remedies for to be hel^d of her maladye / but she felt none hele / but in
the end she had counseyl of a Jew / which gaaf to her a ring with a stone /
And that she should bind this ring with alaas to her baar flesh / and by the
virtue of ye stone she should be hool / And when she saw that this helped her
not / she went to the church of the prothomartir / And praid the blessed
saint steven for her health / and anon without brekyng of the laas or of the
ring the ring fyl down to the ground / And she felt her self anon all hool /
Item the same recounteth another miracle not less merueyllous / that in
Cesaree of Capadoce was a lady much noble of whom the husbond was deed / but
she had x children / vij sons and iij doughtres / And on a time when they had
angered their mother / she cursed them / And the dyuyne vengeance ensyewed
suddenly the malediction of the mother / so that all the children were smeton of
one semblable and horrible sekenes on all her members / For which thing they
might not dwell in the contre for shame and for the sorrow that they had / and
began to goo folyly through the world / And in what someuer contre they went /
euerich man beheld them / And it happed that two of them / that is to wit a
brother and a suster came to ypotence / And the brother was named poul / and the
suster pauladye / And there they fond Austyn the bishop and told to him and
recounted what was happed / Then they hau^ted the church of saint stephen by
the space of xv days / and it was to fore ester / and they prayed strongly the
saint for their health / and on ester day when the people was present / poul
entered suddenly within the chauncell / and put him to prayer by great
deuouocion and with great reverence to fore the altar / and as they that were
there abode upon the end of the thing / he aroos up appertly all hole of his
tremblyng / Then saint Austyn took him and showed him to the people / and said
that on the morn he would tell them the caas / And as he spack to the people the
suster was there tremblyng on all her members / and she aroos up and entered in
to the chauncell of saint stephen / and anon she slepte / And after aroos
suddenly all hole / and was showed to the people / as was don to fore of her
brother / And then graces and thankynges were given to saint stephen for the
health of them both / when Orosius came fro Iherusalem he brought to saint
austyn of the relyques of saint steph^n / of whom many miracles were showed and
done / It is to wit that the blessed saint stephen suffered not death on the
day of his feste / but it was on the day that his Inuencion is on in the
month of august / And if it be demanded why the fest is changed it shall be
said when his Inuencion shall be said / And this may suffyse you for this
present / For the church will also ordeyne the festes which folowen the
natyuyte of Ihesu christ for two causes / The first is to Ihesu christ which is
heed and spowse / to the end that thaccompanyes be Joined to him / For Ihesu
christ spowse of the church in this world adioyneth to him three companyes / of
which companyes is said in the cantycles / my white soul and rody chosen of
thousands The white is as to saint Johan theua^gelyste a precious confessor /
And the rody or reed is as to saint stephen the first martyr / And chosen of
thousands / is to the vyrgynal company of thynnocentes / The second reason is
that the church assembleth also to gydre the manners of the martirs / the som^e
by will and by work / the second by will and not by deed / the third by deed
and not by will / The first was the blessed stephen The second was in saint
Ioh^n theuangelyst / The third was in saints and glorious Innocentis / which
for god suffered passion /

Thus ends the life of saint Stephen
And next follows of saint Johan theuangeliste
Johan is expowned the grace of god / or he in whom grace is / or to whom it
is given of our lord / And therefore ben vnderstonen iiij preuyleges that been in
the blessid saint Ioh^n The first was the noble love of Ihesu christ / For he
loved him more than the other / and shewde to him of gretter love and thereof he
is said the grace of god also as gracious god / and to him he was more gracious
than to pieter / for he louyd him much / but he is love of courage and of sign
/ and this that is of signs is double / that one is for to show famylyarite /
and that other is in geuyng benefices / As to the first he loved that one and
the other egally / as to the second he loved more Ioh^n / and as to the third
he loved more peter / The second was virgynyte / wha^ he was chosen virgyne of
god / and therefore it is said in what is that grace / For grace of vyrgynyte is
in a virgyne / And when he would marye he was called of god /

The third is the reuelacion of the secrets of our lord / therefore it is said
to whom grace is given / For to him was given to know many secrets and
profound / as of the dyuynyte of the sone of god and of the^de of the world The
fourth is the recomendacion of the mother of god / which gift of grace was
given of our lord / For this gift was given to him / when the mother was given
to him in to keeping / And Mylete bishop of lyege wrote his life / the which
yso^ore abredgyd and set it in to the book / of the natyuyt^es / of the life /
and the death of holy faders /

Saint Johan thappostle and evangelist was sone of Zebedee / which had married
the third suster of our lady to wife / and that was brother to saint James of
galice / This said Ioh^n signefyeth as much as the grace of god And well might
he have such a name / For he had of our lord iiij graces above the other
appostles / The first is that he was biloued of our lord / The second was that
our lord kept to him his vyrgynyte / like as saint Jerome says / For he was
at his weddyng / and he abode a clean virgyne / The third is that our lord
made him to have much great reuelacion and knowleche of his dyuynyte / and of
the fynysshyng of the world / like as it appireth in the begynnyg of his
eua^gelyes / and in thapocalypse / The fourth grace is that our lord commysed
to him in especial the keeping of his sweet mother / He was after thasce^cion of
our lord in Iherusalem with thappostles and other / And after that / that they
were by thordenau^ce of ye holy ghoost confermed in the christian faith by the
universal world / Saint Ioh^n ca^ in to greece where he conuersid / and
conuertid much people and founded many chyrches in the christian faith / as well
by miracles as by doctrine / In this time domycien was Emperor of rome which
made right great persecucions unto christian men / And did do take saint Johan /
and to be brought to Rome / And made him to be cast in to a fat or a tonne
full of hot oylle in the presence of ye senators / of which he issued out by
the help of god / more pure / and more fair / without felyng of any hete or
chauffyng / than he entered in / After this that the emperor saw / that he
cessed not to preche the christian faith / he sent him in exile / unto an isle
called pathmos / There was saint Johan allone / and was visited of angellis and
governed / there wrote he by the reuelacion of our lord thapocalypse / which
contained the secrets of holy church / and of the world to come / In this
same year was domycien the emperor / for his euyllis put to death / And all that
he had don was reuoqued by the senators and deffeated / And thus was saint
Ioh^n brouht again from his exyle with great honor in to Ephesym / And all the
people of ephesym came against him syngyng and saying / blessed be he / that
comes in the name of our lord / In that way he raised a woman which was
named drusiane / which had much loved saint Ioh^n and well kept his
comandementis / And her friends brought her tofore saint Ioh^n all weeping and
saying to him / Loo here is drusyane which much loved the and did thy
comandementis / and is deed ande desired nothing so much as thy return / and
that she might see the to fore her death / now thou art comen hither / and she
may not see the / Saint Ioh^n had great pity on her that was deed / and of the
people that wept for her / and commanded that they should set down the byere
and unbind and take away the clothes fro her / And when they had so done / he
said hyeryng all / with a loud voys / Drusiane my lord god Ihesu criste
areyseth the / drusiane / arise and goo in to thy hows / and make ready for me
som^e refection / Anon she aroos and went in to her hows for to do the
commandment of saint Ioh^n / And the people made three hours long a great noise
and cry saying there is but one god / and that is he whom saint Ioh^n prechyth
/ It happed on an other day that craton the phylosophre made a great assemblee
of people in the mids of the cite / For to show to them how they ought to
despise the world / and he had ordained two young men brethern / which were
much rich / and had made the^ to selle their patrymonye and therewith to b^ye
precious stones / the which these two young men brake in the presence of the
people / for to show how these precious and great Rychesses of the world ben
soon destroyed / That same time saint Ioh^n passed by / And said to craton the
philosopher / This manner for to despise the world that thou show is vain
and folyssh demonstraunce / For it secheth to have the preysyng of the world
and god reproves it / my good maystre Ihesu christ said to a man that demanded
of him how he might come to everlasting life / that he should goo and selle all
his goods / And give that he received of it to the pour people And he should
find tresour in heaven / Craton said then to him / the pryse and valewe of
these precious stones is destroyed in the presence of all men here / but if
thy maystre be veraye god and he will that the goods of the world be given to
pour men / take then the pieces of these precious stones broken And make
them hole stones as they were to fore by cause if I have showed this by vain
glory / make thou them to the honor of thy maystre / Anon saint Ioh^n took
the pyeces of the precious stones / And after that he had made his prayer to
god / he showed to the^ the stones as hoole as ever they were or had been / when
craton the philosopher saw this / anon he with his ij men and his disciples /
fill down to the feet of saint Ioh^n and received the faith and baptesme of
Ihesu criste / And sold the precious stones and gave the money thereof for the
love of god / And begone to preche the faith of our lord Ihesu christ / Than
the two brethern much rich and honored in the cite of Ephesim / anon they
sold al their patrimony / and gaf it for the love of god / But after when they
came in to the cite of pergania / and saw them that had been their servants
clothed in silk / and in great honor of the world / and them self having but
a pour mantel / or perauenture a pour cote / Anon they repented them that
they had given away their goods in alms to pour people / This apperceyued
saint Ioh^n and said to them / I see that ye ben heavy and sorouful / of this
that after the doctrine of Ihesu christ ye have given your good for gods sake
/ wherefore if ye will have again the valewe of your goods / bring to me rods
of the trees and stones of the Ryuage of the sea /

And so they did / And when saint Johan had them anon by his prayer / he
changed the rods in to fyn gold / And the common stones in to precious stones
/ And saint Johan had them to take them and show to the maistres that had
knowleche in such Iewellis / if the Rods were gold and the common stones
precious stones After they came again and said to saint Ioh^n / Sire the
maistres say that they saw never so fine gold / ne so precious stones / Saint
Ioh^n then said to them / goo ye and bye ye again your lands that ye have
sold / For ye have lost the reward of heaven / Be ye rich temporelly for to be
beggars perpetuelly Then began he to preche in despytyng the Rychesses / and
to show vj causes why we ought to restrain us for to love Rychesses / First
thescripture lerneth us to hate Richesses / And recites in the gospel / how
the Rich man that was clad in purpure / and ete every day delycious metes
glotonously was lost and dampened / but the pour man at his gate that deyde full
of soores and hongry was saved /

Secondly / Nature techeth us to hate Rychesses / For we ben born pour and
naked / and pourly must we depart and deye / Thyrdly the creature techith us
/ For the son the moon and the sterres the Rain and the air ben comyne /
and depart their Influences and their benefices largely / Fourthly the man it
not often in one estate / For when he weneth to be Rich / plentiuous / and free
/ he fyndeth him self bond and caytyf / For the Rich man adverse / is bond
and servant to the penny and to the devil / Amator pecunie seruus est mammone
/ Fyftly / sorrow and care / For by day and night he has great labor in
getyng and in keeping of hit / and great dread to lose that / which he has so
dear and with great pain gotten /

Syxtly anauntyng and praysyng For the Rychesses given occasion to be vayn
glorious and to praise and gloryfye him self / And by this it appyereth / that
presently is lost the well of humylyte / without which the grace of god may
not be had / And thus is gotten for the world come to pain and tormente / by
over great pride / Escripture then / nature creature / fortune / besynes and
care / aaduauntyng and praysyng ought to make us withdraw for to love
richesses / Saint Johan approuued to thies two men his doctrine with his
miracles to be true / and ye in the name of him did miracles / to fore that
ye were sorry and repented you of that / that ye had given your Rychesses to
pour people / Now is that grace from you departed / And ye ben bycome
meschaunt and wretches / which were in the faith strong and mighty / And to
fore the evil spyrites had fere and dread of you / And by your commandment they
issued out of bodies humayne / Now have ye fere and dread of them / and ben
bycome their servants / For who so loves the Rychessys of this world / he is
servant unto a devil named Mammona / And is bond and serf in keeping the
Richesse / in which he sets his affyaunce / And hereof faith the holy ghoost
by the prophet David / In imaginem pertransit homo etc^ / vaynly is the man
distroblyd which assembleth tresour in this world / and knows not for whom
it is / For wha^ he shall deye / he shall here nothing with him / And he wot not
who shall despende it / For naked we came upon therthe / and all naked shall we
reentre in to it And to a meschau^t man it suffiseth not wha^ he has ynowh /
but he is besy day and night to get more without rest / For the Rychesses
make him ferdful to lose that he has gotten / and brings to him many
besynesses and evil rest / in making worldly delytes / And he despourueyd death
comes which takes all fro him and bears nothing with him sauf his propre
sins / when saint Ioh^n had said all this / there was brought to fore him a
young man deed / which only had be in marriage xxx days / And his mother and
friends wept sore / which to fore saint Ioh^n kneled down on their knees
prayeng him that he would reyse him to life / Saint Ioh^n had great pity / And
when he had long wept / he bad to lose and unbind the body / and said / O
satheus which were blinded with flesshly love / soon thou lost thy soul /
And by cause thou knew not thy maker Ihesu christ / thou art fallen
Ignorau^tly in to the laas of the right evil fendes wherefore I weep / and pray
that thou may be releuyd fro death to life / and show thou to thyes tweyne
Actio and eugenio / what great glory they have lost / and what pain they have
deserved / Anon Satheus releued him in yeldyng thankynges to saint Ioh^n / and
blamed much the two disciples in saying / I saw your two angellis weep / and
the deuylles demene Joy of your perdicion / Also I saw the Royame of heaven
made ready for you and full of all delyces / And ye have fol^ly gotten for you
the places of hell derke and tenebrous full of dragons and of all pains / And
therefore it behooves you to pray to / thappostle of god / that he remyse and
bring you again to your sauacion / like as he has raised me goodly / And
among all other pains / This Satheus recyteth thise that been contained in two
verses following / Vermis et vmbre / flagellum / frigus / et ignis / Demonis
aspectus / celerum confusio / luctus / that is to say / Worm / derknes /
scorges / cold / hete / sight of devil / confusion of sins / and wayllyng /
Anon then these two men by right great repentance prayed saint Ioh^n that he
would pray for them / To whom saint Ioh^n answered / that they should do penance
xxx days long / / and pray to god that the Reddes of gold and the precious
stones might return to their first propre natures / After these xxx days they
came to saint Ioh^n and said to him fair fader / ye have always preached
mysericorde and mercy / and commanded that one should pardone another his
trespaas / we ben co^tryte and repentaunt / of our sins / and weep / with our
eyes for this evil worldly couetyse / the which we have by them received / And
therefore we pray you that ye have mercy on us / And saint Johan answered / our
lord god / when he made mention of ye synnar / he said I will not the death of
the synnar / but that he be converted and live / For great Joy is in heaven of
a synnar repentaunt / And therefore know ye that he has received your
repentance / Goo ye forth / and bear the rods and stones thither / where ye
took them / For they be returned to their first nature / Thus received they
the grace that they had lost / so that after they did great miracles in the
name of our lord Ihesu christ / And then after this when the blessed Appostle
saint Ioh^n had preached thorugh all Asye / and sown the word of christ / They
that worshipped ydolles / moeued the people against saint Ioh^n / And came and
drowe him unto the temple of dyane for to constrayne him to do sacrefice unto
that ydolle / To whom saint Ioh^n said / sith ye believe that your goddess
dyane have so great power call ye upon her and require her by her power she
subuerte and overthrow / the church of christ / and if she so do I shall do
sacrefyce to her / and if she do it not / then late me pray unto my god
Ihesu christ / that he overthrow her temple / and if he so do / then believe
ye in him / To this sentence the most part of the people consented / and so
they prayed / and nothing they could not do ne prevail again the church of
christ / but saint Ioh^n made his prayers / And anon the temple of dyane / fill
down / and was overthrown / so that the foundement turned up so down / And
thymage of dyane all to dasshed and destroyed / And that same day were
converted to crystes faith xij M men of the gentiles beside wymen and children
/ Then Aristodemus bishop of the ydollis styred and meuyd sedicion emonge
the people in such wise that / that one party made them ready to bataylle
against that other party / Then said thappostle to him / what wylt thou that
I do / that thou may be pleasid / to whom the bishop said if thou will that
I believe in thy god / Ishal give to the venym to drink / And if it hurt not
the / then thy lord is very god / then said saint Ioh^n / do as thou have
said then said the bishop / I will first that thou see other deye thereof to
fore / by cause thou sholdest the more dread it Then went Aristodemus to the
proconsul of the cite / and demanded of him ij men Iuged to death for to have been beheded / And to fore them all he gaf to the^ to drink the venym / which
men as soon as they had dronken it / incontinent deyed / Then saint Ioh^n took
the cup with the venym / And blessed it with the sign of the cross / and
drank it of euerydele / And had ne felt none hurt ne harm wherefore all the
people gaf laud and preysyng to god / Aristodemus said yet have I a doubt /
but and if thou reyse to life again the deed men that drank the venym / without
doubt then shall I believe / Then thappostle delyueryd him his cote / to
who^ he said why gyuest thou to me thy cote / and saint Ioh^n said / by cause
that you asshamed and confused shall goo fro and forsake thyn Infydelite / To
whom he seid / Trowest thou that thy cote shall make me believe / and thappostle
said goo and leye it upon the bodies of the deed men saying / Thappostle of
Crist has sent me to you / that ye arise in the name of crist / which when he
had done / anon they aroos fro death to life / Then thappostle baptized the
bishop and the proconsul byleuyng in christ with all their kynne and friends /
which anon brake all their symylacres / And in the same place edefyed a church
in the worship of god and of saint Johan / The holy saint clement reherceth in
the fourth book of historia ecclesiastica / that one a time saint Ioh^n
theuangelist converted to the faith a goodly young man well favored and strong
/ And commanded him unto the keeping rule and governance of a bishop / And
within a lytyl while after this young man forsook the bishop / and fylle in to
evil company among theuys / And by came and was made master and prince of them
Anon after thappostle came to the bishop / and demanded for this young man / And
the bishop was sore abashed / when saint Johan saw his contenaunce he
demanded more besilier after him / And where he had left him / For I ask him
of the / whom I delivered to the and gaf the so great charge with him / Then
said the bishop to him / Fader truly he is deed in his soul / And is in
yonder montayn with theuys / and is their master / and prince / And when he
herd that for sorrow he rent his clothis / and said to the bishop / thou art
a feeble kepar for to suffer thy brother to lose his soul / Anon he made an
horse to be made ready for him / and rode fast to the montayn / And when the
young man espied and knew him / he was so sore ashamed that he fled from him /
Then thappostle forgate his age / and prykyd after / and cried after him that
fled / My most sweet sone why fleest thou fro thy fader feeble and old / Be
thou not aferd sone / For I shall yield acountes for the to Ihesu christ / And
truly I shall gladly deye for the / like as Ihesu christ deyed for us / Torn
again my sone torn again / Ihesu christ has sent me to the And he herd him
thus speak / he abode with an heavy chyer and wept repentyng him bytterly / and
fylle down to the feet of thappostle / and for penance kyst his hand / And
thappostle fasted and prayed to god for him and gate for him remyssyon of his
sins and foryeuenes / And lived so virtuously after that saint Ioh^n ordained
him to be a bishop / Also it is read in the same hystorye / that saint Ioh^n
on a time entered in to a bath for to wasshe him / and there he fond cheryntu^
an heretyke / whom as soon as he saw he eschewed and went out of it saying /
Late us flee and goo hens / leeft the bayne fall upon us / in which cheryntus
thenemye of truth wassheth him And as soon as he was out / the bayne fylle
down / Cassiodor says that a man had given to saint Ioh^n a partrych living /
And he held it in his hand strokyng and playeng with it other while for his
recreacion / And on a time a young man passyd by with his felawshyp and saw him
play with his bird / which said to his felaws lawhyng / See how the yonder
old man plays with a byrd like a child / which saint Ioh^n knew anon by
tholy ghoost what he had said / and called the young man to him / and demanded
him what he held in his hond and he said a bow / what do thou with all said
saint Ioh^n / And the young man said we shote birds and bestes therewith / to
whom thappostle demanded how and in what manner / Then the young man bente his
bow / and held it in his hand bente / And when thappostle said no more to
him he vnbente his bow again / Then said thappostle to him / why have thou
vnbente thy bow / and he said / by cause if it should be long / bente it should
be the weyker for to shete with it / Then said thappostle / So sone it
fares by mankind and by freylte in contemplacion / if it should be always be
bente it should be to weyke / And therefore otherwhyle it is expedient to have
recreacion / The eygle is the bird that flees highest / and most clerly
beholds the son / And yet by necessyte of nature / him behooves to descend
low / Right so when mankind withdraws him a lytil fro contemplacion / he
after puts him self heyer by a renewed strength / and he brenneth then
more fervently in heavenly things / Saint Ioh^n wrote his gospellis after the
other evangelists / the year after thascencion of our lord lxvj / after this
that the venerable bede says / And wha^ he was required and prayed of the
bishops of the contre of ephese / to write them saint Ioh^n prayed also to them
that they should fast and pray in their dyosices iij days for him to the end
that he might truly write them / Saint Iherome says of this glorious appostle
saint Ioh^n / that when he was so old / so feeble / and so vnmyghty / that his
dysciples sustained and bare him in going to church / and as of times as he
restid he said to his dysciples / Fair children love ye to gydre / and each of
you love other / And then his disciples demanded why and wherefore he said to
them so often such werdes / he answered to them and said our lord had so
commanded / And who someuer accomplisshed well this comandeme^t / it should
suffyse him for to be saved / And fynably after that he had founded many
chyrches / and had ordained bishops and prestes in them / and confermed them
by his predycacion / in the christian faith the year lxviij after the
resurrection of Jesus christ / For he was xxxj year old when our lord was
crucyfyed And lived after lxviij year and thus was all his age lxxxxix year /
Then came our lord with his dyscyples to him and said / Come my friend to me /
For it is time that thou come / ete and be fed at my table with thy bret^ern
Then saint Ioh^n aroos up and said to our lord Ih^u christ / that he had
desired it long time / And began to goo Then said our lord to him / On
sunday next coming thou shall come to me / That sunday the people came all to
ye chyrehe / which was founded in his name and consecrate on that one side of
Ephesee / And fro mydnyght forth he ceased not to preche / to the people /
that they should establysshe them and be steadfast in the christian faith / and
obeyssaunt to the comandemens of god / And after this he said the mass / and
howselyd and comuned the people / and after that the mess was fynysshed / he
bad and did do make a pytte or a sepulture / to fore the altar / And after
that he had taken his leave / and commanded the people to god / he descended down
in to the pytte or sepulture / And held up his hands to heaven and said /
Sweet lord Ihesu christ I yield me unto thy desire / and thank the that thou
have vouchedsauf to call me to the / if it plaise the / receive me for to be
with my brethern / with whom thou have somoned me / Opene to me the yate of the
life permanable / And led me to the feast of thy well and best dressed metes /
thou art Christ the sone of the living god / which by the comandem^t yt of
fader have saved the world To the I render and yield grace and thankynges world
wythouten end / thou know well that I have desired the with all my heart /
After that he had made his prayer much amerously and pyteously / anon came upon
him great clerenes and light / And so great brightness that none might see him /
And when this light and bryghtnes was goon and departed / there was nothing
found in the pytte or grave but manna / which came spryngyng from under upward
/ like as fond in a fontayn or spryngynge well where much people have been
delyuerd of many diseases and sekenesses / by ye merytes and prayers of this
glorious saint / Som^e say and afferme that he deyed without pain of death /
And that he was in that clerenes born in to heaven body and soul / whereof god
knows the certaynte / And we that been yet here bynethe in this myserye /
ought to pray devoutly to him that he would impetre and get to us the grace of
our lord which is blessed in secula seculorum Amen /

There was a king an holy Confessor and virgyne named saint Edward / which had
a specyal devotion unto saint Ioh^n evangelist / and it happed that this holy
king was at halowyng of a church dedycate in thonour of god and of this holy
appostle / and it was that saint Ioh^n in lyknes of a pilgrim came to this
king and demanded his alms in the name of saint Ioh^n / And the king not
having his amoner by him ne his chamberlayn of whom he might have somewhat to
give him / but took his ring which he bare on his fyngre and gaf it to the
pilgrim / After this many days / it happened ij pylgryms of england for to be
in the holy land / And saint Ioh^n appiered to them / And bad them to bear
this Ring to their king / and to great him well in his name / And to tell him
that he gaf it to saint Ioh^n in lykenes of a pilgrim / and that he should make
him ready to depart out of this world / For he should not long abide here / but
come in to everlasting bliss / And so vanysshed fro them / And anon as he was
goon / they had great lust to sleep / and leyd them down and slepte / and this
was in the holy land / and when they awoke they looked about them / and knew
not where they were / And they saw flocks of sheep and shepherdes keeping them
/ to whom they went to know the way and to demand where that they were /
and when they axed them they spack englyssh / and said that they were in
england in kente on beram down / And then they thanked god and and saint
Joh^n for their good speed and came to this holy king saint Edward on Cristemas
day / and delivered to him the ring / and did their erand / whereof the king
was abashed / and thanked god and the holy saint / that he had warnyng for to
depart / and on the vygyle of thepyphanye next after he deyde and departed
holyly out of this world / And is buried in thabbiye of westmestre by london /
where as is yet in to this day the same ring / Ysidore in the book of the life
and death of holy saints and fadres says this / Saint Joh^n theua^gelist
transformed and turned rods of trees in to fyn gold / the stones and grauel
of the sea in to precious ge^mes and owches / the small broken pyeces of gemmes
he reformed unto their first nature / he raised a wydowe fro death / And brought
again the soul of a young man in to his body / he drank venym / without hurt
or peril / And them that had been deed by the same / he recouerid in to the
state of life /

Here ends the life of saint Johan theuangelist
Here follows Thystorye of Thynnocentes
THe Innocentis called Innocentis for iij reasons First by cause and reason of
life / and by reason of pain / and by reason of Innocence / By reason of life
they be said Innocentis / by cause they had an Innocent life / They grieved no
body / neither god by inobedyence / ne their neighbors by untruth / ne by
conceyuyng of any sin / And therefore it is said in the psaulter / Thynnocentes
and rightwys have Joined them to me /

Thynno^^ntis by their life and rightwys in the faith by raison of pain / For
they suffered death Innocently and wrongly / whereof David says they have shed
the blood of Innocents / by reason of Innocencye that they had / by cause that
In this martirdom they were haptysed and made clean of thorigynal sin / of
which Innocence / is said in the psaulter / keep thou Innocencye of baptesme /
And see equity of good works /

HOly church makes feste of the Innocentis / which were put to death by cause
of our lord Ihesu christ / For herod Ascalomer for to find and pute to death
our lord which was born in bethleem / he did do slay all the children in
bethleem and there about / fro the age of two year and under unto one day /
unto the som^e of an CxliiijM children / For to understand which herod it
was that so cruelly did do put so many children to death / It is to wit that
there were three herodes / and all three were cruel tyrau^tes And were in their
time of great fame and much reno^med for their great malice / The first was
herod Ascolamer / he reigned in Iherusalem when our lord was born / The second
was herodes Antipas / to whom pylate sent Ih^u christ in the time of his
p^ssi^n / And he did do smite of saint Joh^n baptystes heed / The third was
herodes agrippa which did do smite of saint James heed said in galyce / and
set saint peter in prison / But now late us come to this first herod that
did do slay the Innocente children / his fader was named Antipater as hystorye
scol^styke says / and was king of (...) and paynem / he took a wif which was
Niece to the king of arabe / on whom he had iij sons and a daughter / of
whom that one was named herod Ascalomer This herod served so well to Iulyen
the emperor of Rome / that he gaf to him the Royame of Iherusalem / Then lost
the Jews king of their lygnage / And then was showed the prophecye of the
birth of our lord / This herod Ascolomer had vj sons / Antipater / Alexander
/ Aristobolus / A^ch^lous / herod Antipas and phelippe / Of thies children
herod sent al^xandre and Aristobolus to s^^le to Rome / And alixander becam a
wise and a subtyl advocate / And when they were comen fro scole again they
began to enter in to words against herod their fader / to whom he would leave
his royame after him / wherefore their fader was angry with them / and put to
fore them Antipater their brother for to come to the Royame / upon that /
incontinent they treated of the death of their fader / wherefore their fader
enchaced them away / And they went again to Rome and complained of their fader
to the emperor / Anon after this came the three kings in to Iherusalem / and
demanded where the king of Jews was that was new born / herod when he herd
this / he had great dread / leest any were born of the true lynage of the
kings of Jews / and that he were the very true heyer / and of whom he myggt
be chaced out of the Royame And when he had demanded of the three kings / how
they had had knowleche of the new king / they answered by a sterre being in
thayer / which was not naturelly / fyxed in the heuene as the other were /
Then he prayed the^ that they would return to him after yt they had worshypped
and seen this new king / that he might goo and after worship the child /
This said he fraudelently / For he thought to slay him / After that the three
kings were goon / without bryngyng him any tidings / he thought that anon
he would do slay all the children newly born in bethleem and there aboutes /
among whom he thought to slay Ihesu christ / but his thought was enpesshed and
let / For the emperor sent to him a cytacion / that he should come to Rome for
tanswere to the accusacion that Aristobolus and alixander his two sons had
made against him / And therefore he durst not put then the children to death /
to the end that he should not be accused of so cruel a deed with his other
trespaces / So he was in going to Rome and abydyng there and in coming more
than half a year / And in that while Jesus was born in to egypt / when herodes
came to rome / the emperor ordained that his sons should do him honor and
obey him / And he should leave his Royame after his death where it best plesed
him / Upon this when he was comen again and felt him self confermed of the
Royame / he was more hardy to slay the children than he had to fore thought /
Then he sent in to bethleem / and did do slay all the children that were
of the age of two year / by cause it was passed more than a year / that the
three kings had told him tidings of ye king of Jews new born / But wherefore
then did do slay the children he that were but one night old Herto saint
Austyn says that herod doubted that Ihesus to whom the sterres served / myht
make him self some younger than he was / After this came upon herod a right
vengeance / For like as he desseuered many moders fro their children / in like
wise was he desseuered fro his children / It happed that he had suspection upon
his ij sons Alixandre and Aristobolus / for one of his servant said to him
that alisaundre had promised to him great yeftes / if he would give to his fader
to drink poison or venym / And the harbor said to the king that he had
promised him a great thing / if when he made the kings berde / would cut his
throat / And for this cause herod did do slay them both / and ordained in
his testament that Antipater his sone should be king after him Upon this
Antipater his sone had hrete desire to come to the Royame and was accused that
he had made ready venyme for tenpoysonne his fader / For a maid a servant
afterward showed the same venyme to the king / wherefore he did do put his sone
Antypater in prison / when Augustus the emperor of Rome herd say that herod
ruled thus his children / he then said I had lever be the swyne or hog of
herodes than his sone / For he which is strange in his living spares his
swyne / and he put to death his sons / Herod when he was lxx year old / he
fill in a grievous maladye / by right vengeance of god / For a strong fever
^oke him within / and without he had his flessh hot and dry chauffed / his
feet swelled and becam of a pale color / The plants of his feet under began
to rote / in such wise that vermyne issued out / And a stenche issued so great
out of his breeth and of his members without forth that none person might
suffer it / On that other side he had great greef and annoye of the anger that
he had for his sons / when the maistres and physicie^s saw that he might not
be helped by no medecyne / then they said that this maladye was a vengeance
of god / and for as much as he herd say that the Jews were glad of his
maladye and sekenes / Therefore he did do assemble the most noble of the Jews
out of the good towns / and did do put them in prison / And said to Salome
his suster / and to Alyxandre her hustbond / I know well that the Jews shall be
glad of my death / but if ye will do my counseyl and obey to me I shall mow
have great playnte and wayllyng of many that shall bywepe my death in this wise
that I shall show you / Anon as I shall be deed / do ye to be slain all the
noble Jews that been in prison / And thus shall be no hows of the Jews / but
that they shall against their will bywepe my death And he had a custom to ete an
apple last after mete / On a time he demanded a knyf for to pare thappelle /
and one delyueryd him a knyf / And shortly he took it as all dyspayred and would
have slain him self / but anon Aciabus his neighbor caught his hand / and
cryde loud / that it was supposed that the king had deyed / Antipater his
sone which was in prison had herd the cry / and wend his fader had been deed
he was glad and promised to the kepars of the prison great yeftes for to let
him out / when herod knew this by his servant / he traueylled the more gre /
uously / by cause his sone was more glad of his death / than of his sekenes /
And anon did do slay him / and ordained in his testament Archelaus to be king
after him / And he lived but v days after / And deyed in great myserye of
Annoye / Salome his suster did not his commandment of the Jews that were in
prison / but let them goo out / And Archelaus becam king after herod his
fader / which as to strangers in the bataylle he was fortunate and happy /
but as to his own people / he was right unhappy / Then I return again after
that Joseph was goon with our lord in to egypt / And was there vij year unto
the death of herod / And after the prophecye of ysaye at entryng of our lord
in to egypt / the ydollis fyllen down / For like as at departing of the
children out of egypt / in every hows tholdest sone of thegypciens lay one
deed / in like wise at coming of our lord / lay down the ydollis in the
temples / Cassiodore says in thystorye trypartyte / in hermopolyn of Thebaide
there was a tree called perfidis / which is medycinal for all sekenesses / For
if the leef or rynde of that tree ben bound to the neck of the seek person /
it he lith him anon / And as the blessed virgyne marye fled with / her sone /
that tree bowed down and worshypped Ihesu christ / Also macrobius says in a
cronycle / that a young sone of herod was nourisshed at that time / and he was
slain / emon ge the other children And then was fulfyled the prophecye saying
/ The voys is herd in rama of great weeping and wayllyng that the sorouful
moders wept for the death of their children / and might not be comforted by
cause their were not alive

Thus ends the feste of the Innocentis
Here follows the life of saint Thomas marter of Caunterburye and first

Saint Thomas the martyr was sone to gylbert bequet a burgeys of the cite of
london / And was born in the place where as now sto^deth the church called
saint Thomas of akirs And this Gilbert was a good devout man and took the
cross upon him / and went on pilgremage in to the holy land / and had a
servant with him / And when he had accomplysshed his pylgremage / he was taken
homeward by the hethen men / and brouht in to the prison of a prince named
Amerant / where long time he and his felawshyp suffered much pain and sorrow
/ And the prince had great affection toward this gylberd / and had often
comynycacion with him of the christian faith / and of the Royame of england by
which conversation it fortuned that the daughter of this prince had especial
love unto this gylberd / and was famylyer with him / and on a time she
disclosed her love to him saying / if he would promise to wedde her / she should
forsake friends / heritage and country for his love / and bycome Christian / and
after long comynycacio^ between them / he promised to wedde her / if she would
become Christian / And told to her the place of his dwelling in england / And
after by the purueaunce of god the said gylbert escaped / and come home / And
after this / it fortuned so that this princes daughter / stale pryuely away and
passed many a wyld place and great aue^ture and by gods purueance at last
ca^ in to london / demandyng and crye^g beket / beket / For more englyssh could
she not / wherefore the people drew about her / what for the strange array of
her as for that they understood her not and many a shrewd boy / so long she
went till she came to fore gylbertis door / And as she there stood / the
servant that had been with gylbert in prison which was named rychart saw her
and knew that it was she / and went in to his master / and told him how this
maid stood at his door / and anon he went out to see her / And as soon as she
saw him she fyl in a Swowne for Joy / And gylberd took her up / and comforted
her / and brought her in to his hows / And since went to the bysshoppis which
then were vj at powlis and reherched all the matter and after they crystened
her / and forthwith weddid unto gylberd beket / And within time reasonable and
acustomed was brought forth between them a fair sone named Thomas / And after
this yet the said gylberd went again to the holy land / and was three year or
he come again / And this child grew forth til he was set to scole / and
learned well and becam virtuous / And when he was xxiiij year old his mother
passed out of this world / And after this he served a merchant of london a
while / in keeping his charge and acomptes / And fro him he went to Stygand
Archebysshop of Caunterbury / And he was in so great favor with him that he
made him Archedeken and chyef of his counseyll / And well executed he his office
/ in punysshyng the culpable / and cherysshyng the good people / And diverse
times went to Rome / for to supporte and help holy church / And after this
henry the second that was themperesse sone / was made king of england and he
ordained this Thomas his chaunceler / and had great rule / and the land stood
in prosperity / And saint Thomas stood so greatly in the kings favor / that
the king was content with all that he did / And when the king went in to
normandye he betoke the gouuernance of his sone and the Royame in to the Rule
of saint Thomas / which he wisely governed til his return again / And anon
after deyde Thybauld tharchebysshop of Caunterbury / And then the king gaf
his nomynacion to saint Thomas / And by the chapter was elect in the year of
his age xliiij / and was full both to take that great charge on him / And so
at last his bullys had / he was sacred and stalled and becam an holy man
suddenly changed in to a new man doing great penance as in weryng hayer with
knottes and a breche of the same down to the knees / And on a tryuyte sunday
received he his dygnyte / And there was at that time the king with many a great
lord and xvj bisshoppis / And fro thens was sent thabbot of euesham to the pope
with other clerkis for ye palle which he gate and brought to him / and he full
mekely received it / And under his habyte he ware thabyte of a monk / and so
was he under withinforth a monk / and outward a clerk / and did great
abstynence making his body lene and his soul fat / and he used to be well
served at his table / and took but litil refectio^ thereof / and lyuyd holily in
gyuyng good ensample / After this many times the king went over in to
normandye / And in in his absence alleway saint Thomas had the rule of his
sone and of the Royame / which was governed so well that the king could him
great thank / and then abode long in this Royame / and when so was that the
king did any thing against the fraunchyses and lybertees of holy church /
Saint Thomas would ever wythstonde it to his power And on a time when the sees
of london and of wyncestre were vaca^t and void the king kept the^ both
long in his ho^de for to have ye pruffytes of the^ / wherefore saint Thomas was
heavy and came to the king / and desired him to give the ij bysshopriches to
som^e virtuous men / And anon the king granted to him his desire / and
ordained one maistre Roger bishop of wyncestre / and therle of glouceters sone
/ bishop of london named sire Robert / And anon after saint thomas hallowed
thabbey of Redyng / which the first henry fon^ded / And that same year he
translated saint edward king and confessor at westmestre where he was leyd in
a rich shryne / And in short time after by thentycement of ye devil / fill
great debate / variaunce and stryf between the king and saint Thomas / and the
king sent for all the bysshopes to appear to fore him at westmestre at a
certain day / at which day they assemblyd to fore him / whom he welcomed and
after said to them / how that tharchebysshop would destroy his law / and not
suffer him tenioye such things as his predecessors had used to fore him /
whereto saint Thomas answered that he never intended to do thing that should
displese the king / / als far as it touched not the fraunchyse and lyberte^
of holy church / Then the king reherced how he would not suffer (...) that
were theuys have thexecucion of the law^ / to which saint thomas said that he
ought not execute the^ / but they longs to the correction of holy church ^
other diverse points / to which saint Thomas would not agree / To the which the
king said / now I see well you ^holdest fordo^ the laws of this lon^ which have been used in the days of my predecessors / but it shall not lie in thy power /
And so ye king being wroth departed / Then the bysshoppis all cou^ceylled
saint thomas to follow the kings entente / or ellis the land should be in great
trouble / And in like wise the lords te^porell that were his friends
cou^seylled him the same And saint Thomas said I take god to record it was
never mine entente to displese the king / or to taake any thing yt longs to
his right or honor / And then the lords were glad / and brought him to the
king to Oxenford / and the king dayned not to speak to him / And then the
king callid all the lords spu^el and temporelle to fore him / and said he
would have all the laws of his fornfaders there new co^fermed / and there they
were confermed by all ye lords spu^el and temporell / And after this the king
charged them for to come to him to Claryndon to his parlame^t / at a certain
day assigned on pain to run in his Indignacio^ / and at that time so
departed / And this parlam^t was holden at claryndon the xj year of the kings
regne / and the year of our lord xjClxiiij / at this parlem^t were many lords
/ which all were against saint Thomas / And then the king sittyng in his
parlem^t in the presence of all his lords / demanded them if they would abide
and keep the laws that had been used in his forfaders days / Then saint
Thomas spacke for the perte of holy church / and said / All old laws that
be good and rightful / and not against our mother holy church I grant with
good will to keep the^ / And then the king said / that he would not leave
one point of his law / and waxid wroth with saint Thomas / And then certain
bysshoppis required saint thomas to obey to ye kings desire and will / And
saint Thomas desired respyte to know the laws / and then to give him an
answer / And when he vnrd^stode the^ all to som^e he consented / but many he
denied and would never be agreeable to them wherefore the king was wroth / and said
he would hold and keep them like as his predecessors had done before him / and
would not mynusshe one point of them / Then saint thomas said to the king with
full great sorrow and heavy chyere / Now my most dear lord and gracious king /
have pity on us of holy church your bid men / and give to us respyte for a
certain time / And thus departed each man / and saint Thomas went to
wynchestre / And there prayed our lord devoutly for holy church / and to give
him aid and strength for to defend it / For utterly he determined to abide by
the lybertees and fraunchyse / And fyl down on his knees and said full sore
weeping / O good lord I knowleche that I have offended / and for mine offense and
trespaas this trouble comes to holy church / I purpose good lord to goo to
Rome for to be assoylled of mine offensis / And departed toward Caunterburye And
anon the king sent his officers to his manoyrs and despoylled them / by cause
he would not obey the kings statutes / And the king commanded to seas^ all
his lands and goods in to his hondes / And then his servants departed
from him / And he went to the sea side for to have goon over see / but the
wind was against him / and so thryes he took his ship / and might not pass /
And then he knew that it was not our lords will that he should yet depart /
and returned secretly to Caunterbury / of whose coming his meyne made great
Joy / And on the morn came the kings officers for to have seized all his
goods / For the noise was that saint Thomas had fled ye land wherefore they
had dispoylled all his manoyrs and seasid the^ in to ye kings ho^de / And when
they came they fond him at Caunterbury / whereof they were sore abashed / and
returned to the king enformyng him that he was yet at canterbury / and anon
after saint thomas came to the king to wodestoke for ^o pray him to be better
disposed toward ^oly church /

And then said the king to him in skorne / May not we two dwell both in
this land / art thou of so sturdy and hard of heart / to whom saint Thomas
answered / sire yt was never my thought / but I (...) feign plese you / and do
all that / (...) desire so that ye hurt not ye libertees of holy church / For
them will I mayntene while I live / ever to my power / with which words the
king was sore meuyd / and swore that he would have the^ kept and in especial if
a clerk were a thief / he should be Iuged and executed by the kings law / and
by no spirituel law / and said he would never suffer a clerk to be his master
in his own land / And chargid saint thomas tappere to fore him at Norhampton
/ and to bring all the bisshops of this land with him / and so departid /
Saint thomas besought god of help and socoure / For the bysshoppis which
ought to be with him / were most against him / And after this saint Thomas went
to norhampton / where the king held then his great counseylle in the castle
with all his lords / And wha^ he came to fore the king he said / I am comen to
obey your comandem^t / but by fore this time was never bishop of Canuterbury
thus entreted / For I am heed of the church of england / And am to you / sir
king / your ghoostly fader / and it was never gods law / that the sone should
destroy his fader / which has charge of his soul / And by your styryng have
made all the bishops that should abide by the right / of the church / to be
against holy church and me / and ye know well that I may not fight but am ready
to suffer death / rather than I should consent to lose the right of holy church
/ Then said the king thou spekest as a proud clerk / but I shall abate thy
pride or I leave the / For I must rekene with the / thou vnderstondest well that
thou were my chau^cheler many years / and ones I lent to the vC pound / which
you never yet have repayd / which I will that thou pay me again or ellis
incontinent thou shall goo to prison / And then saint thomas answered ye gaf
me that vC pound / and it is not sittyng to demand that which ye have given
/ Not withstondyrig he fondesurete for the said vC pound / and departed for
that day / And after this the next day / the king demanded xxxMli that he had
surmysed on him to have stolen he being chauncheler / where upon he desired day
tanswer / at which time se said / that when he was archebysshop he set him
free therein without any claim or debt by fore good record / wherefore he
ought not tanswere unto that demand / And the bysshoppis desired saint Thomas
tobeye the king / but in no wise he would not gree to such thyngis as should
touch against the lybertees of the church / And then they came to the king
and forsook saint Thomas and agreed to all the kings desire / And the propre
servants of saint Thomas fled fro him and forsook him / and then pour
people came and accompanied him And on the night came to him two lords / and told
to him that the kings meyne had enprysed to slay him And the next night after
he departed in thabyte of a brother of Symprynham and so cheuyssyd that he went
over see / And in the meaue while certain bishops went to Rome for to
conplayne on him to the (...) / And the king sent lettres to the king of
france not to receive him / And the king lowys said that though a man were
banyssyd / and had commysyd there trespaces / yet should he be free in france /
And so after when this holy saint Thomas came / he received him well and gaf him
license to abide there and do what he would /

In this mean while the king of England sent certain lords unto the (...)
complaynyng on tharchebysshop Thomas / which made grievous complayntes / which
when the (...) had herd / said he would give none answer till that he had herd
tharchebysshop Thomas speak / which would hastily come theder / but they would
not abide his coming / but departed without spedyng of their ententis / and came
in to England again /

And anon after saint Thomas came to rome on saint marks day at after none /
and when his Catour should have bought fyssh for his dinner / by cause it was
fasting day / he could get none for no money / and came and told to his lord
saint Thomas so / And he bad him bye such as he could get / and then he
bought flesh and made it ready for their dinner / and saint Thomas was served
thith a capon rostid / and his meyne with boylled mete / And so it was that the
pope herd that he was come and send a Cardynall to welcome him / and he fond
him at his dinner etyng flesh / which anon returned and told to the pope how
he was not so parsight a man as he had supposed / for contrary to the Rule of
the church he eteth this day flessh The pope would not believe him but sent
another cardynal which for more euyde^ce took the leg of the capon in his
keuerchyef / and affermed the same / And opened his keuerchyef to fore the pope
/ and he fond the leg turned in to a fyssh callid a carpe / And when the
pope saw it / he said they were not true men to say such thyngis of this
good bishop / They said faithfully yt it was flessh that he ete / And after
this saint Thomas came to tho pope and did his reverence and obedience whom the
pope welcomed / and after certain co^mynycacion / he demanded him what mete
that he had eten / and he said fhessh as ye have herd to fore / by cause he
could find no fysshe / and very need compellid him thereto / then the pope
understood of the miracle / that the capo^s leg was turned in to a carpe / Of
his goodness granted to him and to all them of the dyocyse of Canterbury
license to ete flessh ever after on saint marks day when it falls on a
flessh day / and pardon with all which is kept and acustomed unto this day /
And then saint Thomas informed the pope how the king of england would have him
consent to diverse articles against ye libertees of holy church / and what
wro^ges he did to the same / and that for to deye he would never consent to
them / and wha^ the pope had herd him he wept for pity / And thanked god yt he
had such a bishop under him that had so well defended the libertees of holy
church / And ano^ wrote out lettres and bulls coma^dyng all the bysshoppis
of crystendom to keep and observe the same / And then saint Thomas offered to
the pope his bisshopriche / up in to the popes hond and his mytre with the
cross and ryng / And the pope commanded him to keep it stille / and said he
knew noma^ more able than he was / And after saint Thomas said mass to fore
the pope in a white chesible / And after mass he said to the pope that he
knew by reuelacion that he should suffer death for the right of holy church /
And when it should fall that chesible should be turned fro white in to read /
And after he departed fro the pope / and came down in to france / unto
thabbaye of pounteney / And there he had knowleche that wha^ the lords
spirituel and te^perel which had been at Rome / were come^ home and had told
the king / that they in nowyse might have their entente / that the king was
greatly wroth / And anon banyssed all the kynnesme^ that were longyng to saint
Thomas / that they should incontinent void his land / and made the^ swear that
they should goo to him / and tell to him that for his sake they were exiled /
And so they went over see to him to pou^tney / and he being there was full sorry
for them / And after there was a great chapter in england of the monks of
cysteaus / And there the king desired them to write to pounteney that they
should no longer keep ne sustain Thomas tharchebysshop / For if they did he
would destroy them of that order being in england / And for fere thereof they
wrote so over to pou^teney that he must depart then^ with his kynnesmen / And
so he did / And was then full heavy / And remytted his cause to god And anon
after the king of france sent to him that he should abide where it plesid him
and duelle in his royame / And would pay for the costs of him and his
kynnesmen / And he departed and went to seynes And thabbot brought him on the
way / And saint Thomas told him / how he knew by a vysion / that he should
suffer death and martirdom for the right of the church / and prayed him to keep
it secret during his lif / After this the king of england came in to france /
and there told the king how saint Thomas would destroy his roya^e And then
there told how he would for do such laws as his oldres had used to fore him /
Wherefore saint Thomas was sent fore / and they were brouht to gidres and ye king
of france labored sore to set the^ at accord / but it would not be / For
that one would not mynusshe his laws and accustomes and saint Thomas would not
grant that he should not do contrary the libertees of holy church / And
then the king of france held with the king of england against saint thomas
/ and was wroth with him and comau^ded him to void his Royame with all his
kynnesmen / And then saint thomas wiste not whither to goo / but co^fortid
his kynnysmen as well as he might / and purposed to have goon in to prouynce /
for to have begged his bread / And as he was going the king of france sent
for him again And when he came he cried him mercy and said he had offended god
and him / And bad him abide in his Royame / where he would / and he would pay
for the dyspensis of him and his kynne / And in the mean while the king of
england ordained his sone king / And made him to be crowned by tharchebysshop
of york and other bysshoppis which was against the statutes of the land / For
tharchebysshop of Caunterbury should have consented / and also have crowned him
wherefore saint Thomas gate a lulle for do accurse them that so did against him /
and also on them that occupied the goods longyng to him / And yet after this
the king labourid so much that he accorded the king of england and saint
Thomas / which accord endured not long / For the king varied from it
afterward / but saint Thomas upon this accord came home to Caunterbury / where
he was received worshypfully / and sent for the^ that had trespaced against him
and by thauctoryte of the popes bulle openly denou^ced the^ accursed unto ye
time they come to ame^dement / And when they knew this / they came to him and
would have made him to assoylle them by force / and sent word over to the
king / how he had done / whereof the king was much wroth / and said if he had
men in his land / that louyd him they would not suffer such a trayttre in his
land alive / And forthwith iiij knights took their counsel to gydre / and
thought they would do to the king a playsir / and emprysed to slay saint
Thomas / and suddenly departed and took their shippyng toward England / And wha^
the king knew of their departing he was sorry and sent after them / but they
were on ye see and departed er the messagers came / wherefore the king was heavy
and sorry / These ben the names of the iiij knyghtis / Sir Reygnold bereson /
Sir hugh moruyle / Sir william Tracy / and Sir Rychard bryto / On Cristemas day
saint Thomas made a sermon at caunterbury in his owen church / and weeping
praid the people to pray for him / For he knew well his time was nyghe / and
there executed the sentence on the^ that were against the right of holy church
/ and ye same day as the king sat at mete all the bread that he handled
waxed anon mowly and hoor that noma^ might ete of it / And the bread that they
towched not was fair and good for to ete / and these iiij knights aforsaid came
to canterbury on the tewesday in crystemasse weke about euensong time / and
came to saint Thomas / and said that the king coma^ded him to make amends for
the wrongs that he had done / and also that he should assoylle all the^ that
he had acursed anon / or ellis they would slay him / Then said Thomas all
that I ought to do by right that will I with a good will do / but as the
sentence that is executed I may not undo / but that they will submytte them
to the correction of holy church / For it was done by our holy fader the pope
and not by me / Then said Sir Reynold but if thou assoylle the king and all
other stondyng in the curse it shall cost the thy life / And saint Thomas said
thou know well enough that the king and I were accorded on Marye Magdaleyn
day / and that this curse should goo forth on them that had offended the church
/ Then one of the knights smote him as he kneled before the altar on the
heed /

And one sire edward gryme that was his croiser put forth his arm with the
cross to bear of the strocke and the stroke smote ye cross on sondre and his
arm almost of / wherefore he fled for fere / And so did all the monks
that were that time at Complyn / And then smote each at him that they smote
of a great piece of the skulle of his heed that his brain fyl on the pauement /
And so they slew and martryd him / and were cruelle that one of them brake
the point of his swerd / against the pauement / And thus this holy and blyssed
Archebisshop saint Thomas suffered death in his owen church / for the right of
all holy church / And when he was deed they styred his brain / And after
went in to his chamber and took away his goods / and his horse out of his
stable / And took away his bullys and wrytynges / and delyueryd them to sire
Robert broke to bear in to france to the king / And as they serchid his
chamber / they fond in a cheste ij shertes of heir made full of great knottes
/ And then they said certainly he was a good man / and coming down in to the
church ward they began to dread and fere that the ground would not have born
them and were merueyllously agaste / but they supposed that therthe would have
swolowed them all quyck / And then they knew that they had don amys / And
anon it was known all about how that he was martryd / And anon after took
this holy body / And vnclothid him and fond bishops clothyng above and
thabyte of a monk under / And next his flesh he weryd and hard heir / full
of knottes which was his sherte / and his breche was of the same / and the
knottes styked fast within the skin / and all his body full of wormys / he
suffered great pain / And he was thus martred the year of our lord xjClxxj /
And was liij year old And sone after tidings came to the king how he was slain
wherefore the king took great sorrow / and sent to Rome for his absolucion /
Now after that saint Thomas departed fro the pope / the pope would daily look
upon the white chesyble that saint Thomas had said mass in / And the same day
that he was martrid he saw it turned in to Reed / whereby he knew well that /
that same day he suffered martirdom / For the right of holy church / And
commanded a mass of requiem solempnly to be songen for his soul / And when the
quer began to sing Requiem / An angele on hye above began thoffyce of a martyr
/ Letabitur Iustus And then all the quyre followed syngyng forth the mass of
thoffyce of a martyr / And the pope thanked god that it plesed him to show
such miracles / for his holy martyr / At whose tomb by the merytes and
prayers of this holy martyr / our blessed lord has shewde many miracles / the
blind have recouerd there their sight / the dombe their speech / the deef their
heeryng / the lame their lymes / And the deed their life / if I should here
express all the miracles / that it has plesyd god to show for this holy
saint / It should conteyne an hole volume / therefore at this time I pass over
unto the feste / of his translacion where I purpose with the grace of god to
recyte som^e of them / Then late us pray to this glorious martyr to be our
advocate that by his peticion we may come to everlasting bliss amen /

Here ends the life and passion of saint Thomas of Caunterbury /
Here follows the lif of saint Siluester
The interpretacion of his name
SIluester is said of silue or sole / which is light / and of terterra the
earth / as who says the light of therthe that is of the church / Or siluester
is said of siluas / and of trahens / yt is to say he was drawyng wyld men and
hard unto the faith / Or as it is said in glosario / siluester is to say
grene / that is to wit great in contemplacion of heavenly things / and a
tylyar in labouryng him self / he he was vmbrouse or shadewous / that is to
say he was cold and refrigerat fro all concupyscence of the flesh / full of
bows emonge the trees of heaven / Eusebe of Cezarce compyled his legende /
which the blessed Gelagius in the counseyl of lxx bishops records / like as
it is had in the decrete /

Of the lyt of saint Siluestre
SIluester was sone of one Iusta / And was learned and taught of a priest named
Ciryne / which did merueyllously great almesses and made hospytalytees / hit
hepped that he received a christian man in to his hows named Thymothee / whom
noman would receive for the persecucion of tyrauntes / wherefore the said
Thymothee suffered death and passion after that year whylis he preched Justly the
faith of Ihesu christ / it was so that the prefecte tarquynus supposed that
Thymothee had / had great plente of Rychesses / which he demanded of siluestre
/ thretenyng him to the death / but if he delyueryd them to him / And when he
fond certainly that Thymothee had no great Rychesses / he commanded to saint
siluestre to make sacrefyse to the ydollys / and if he did not he would make
him suffer diverse torme^tis / Saint siluester answered / Falls evil man thou
shall deye this night and shall have tourmentes that ever shall endure / And
thou shall know whether you wilt or none that he whom we worshype is very god
/ Then saint syluester was put in prison / and the prouoste went to dinner /
Now it happed that as he ete a bone of a fysshe turned in his throat and stacke
fast / so that he could neither have it down ne up / And after at mydnyht
deyed / like as saint siluester had said / and then saint siluester was
delyuerd out of prison he was so gracious that all christian men and paynems
loved him / For he was fair like an aungele to look on / a fair speker / hool
of body / holy in work / good in counseylle / pacyent and charytable / and
fermly establysshed in the faith / he had in writing the names of all the
wydowes and orphans that were pour / and to them he admynystred their
necessyte / he had a custom to fast all frydayes and saterdayes / And it was
so that melchiades the bishop of Rome deyed / And all the people chese saint
siluester for to be the hye bishop of Rome / which sore against his will was
made pope / he Instytued for to be fasted wednesday / friday / and saturday /
And the thursday for to be hallowed as sunday / Now it happed that the emperor
Constantyn did do slay all the christian men oueral where he could find them /
And for this cause saint siluester fled out of the town with his clerks /
and hid him in a montayne / And for the cruelte of Constantyn god sent him
such a sekenes that he becam lazare and mesell / And by the counceyll of his
phisicye^s he gate three thousand children young for to have cut their throtes
for to have their blood in abaygne all hoot / and thereby he might be heelyd of
his meselrye / And when he should ascend in to his chare for to goo to the
place where he should be baygned / the moders of the children camen cryeng and
brayeng for sorrow of their children / And when he understood that they were
moders of the children / he had great pity on them and said to his knights and
them that were about him / The dygnyte of thempyre of Rome is brought forth of
the fontayne of pity / the which has stablysshed by decree / that who that
sleeth a child in bataylle / shall have his heed smeton of / Then should it be
great cruelte to us for to do to ours / such thing as we deffende to
strange nations / for so should cruelte surmounte us / It is better that we
leave cruelte / and that pity surmounte us / And therefore me seems better to
save the lives of these Innocentis / than by their death I should have again my
health / of the which we be not yet or^^ayn / Ne we may recouuer nothing for
to slay them / For if so were that I should be thereby have health / that should
be a cruel health that should be bought with the death of so many Innocentis /
Then he coma^ded to render and delyure again to the maders their children /
and gaf to euerich of them a good yefte / And thus made them return to their
howses with great Joy / For whens they departed with great sorrow / And he him
self returned again in his chare unto his palace / Now it happed that the next
night after / saint peter and saint poul appiered to this emperor Consta^tyn
saying to him / By cause that you have had orrour to shede and spylle the blood
of Innocentis / our lord Ihesu christ has had pity on the / And coma^deth the
to send unto such a montayne where siluestre is hyd with his clerks And say
to him that thou come for to be baptized of him / and thou shall he heled of
thy maladye / And when he was awaked / he did do call his knights / And
commanded them to goo to that montaygne / And bring the p^pe siluestre to him
courtoisly and fair for to speak with him / when saint siluestre saw from
far the knights come to him / he supposed that they sought him for to be
martyred / And began to say to his clerks that they should be ferme and stable
in the faith for to suffer martirdom / when the knights came to him / they said
to him much courtoysly / that Constantyn sent for him / and prayed him yt he
would come and speak with him / And forthwith he came / and when they had
entresalewed each other / Constantyn told to him his vision / And when
Siluestre dem^unded of him what men they were that so appiered to him /
The Emperor wist not ne could not name them / Saint siluestre opened a book /
wherein the images of saint Peter and saint Poul were pourtrayed / and demanded
of him if they were like unto them / Then constantyn anon knew them / and
said that he had seen them in his sleep / Then saint Siluestre prechid to him
the faith of Ihesu christ / and baptized him / And when he was baptized a great
light descended upon him so that he said that he had seen Ihesu christ and was
heled forthwith of his meselerye / And then he ordained vij laws unto holy
church / The first was that all the cite should worship Ihesu christ as very
god /

The second thing / was / that who someuer should say o^y vylonnye of Ihesu
Christ / he should be punysshyd /

The third / who someuer should do vylonye to Christian men / he should lose half
his goods / The fourth that the bishop of Rome / should be chyef of all holy
church / like as the emperor is chyef of all the world / The syfthe that who
that had done or should do trespaas and fledd to the church / that he should be
kept there free fro all Iniuryes / The sixthe that noman should edeffye any
chyrches without license of holy church / and consent of the bishop / The
seuen^h that the dysine and tenthe part of the possessyon^ should be given to
the church / After this the emperor came to saint peter's church and confessyd
mekely all his sins to fore all people / And what wrong he had don to
crysen m^n / And made to dygge and cast out to make the the foundemen is for
the chirches / and bare on his sholdres xij hottis or ^^sk^ltis fulle of earth
/ when helayne the mother of constantin dwelling in be^^anye / herd say that
the emperor was become christian / she sent to him a lettre / In which she
preysed much her sone / of this that he had renou^^^d the false ydolles / But
she blamed him much / that he had renounced the law of the Jews / and
worshipped a man crucyfyed / Then Constantyn remau^ded to his mother that she
should assemble the grettest maistres of the Jews / And he should assemble the
grettest maistres of the christian men / to the^de that they might dyspute and
know which was the trewest law / Then helayne assembled twelve maistres
which she brought with her / which were the wysest that they might find in
that law And saint syluestre and his clerkis were of that other party /
Then the emperor ordained two paynemes gentyles to be their Iuges / of whom
that one was named Craton and that other Zenofilus which were proved wise and
expert / And they to give the sentence / And be Judge of the dysputacion /
Then began one of the maistres of the Jews for to maynteyne and dyspute his
law / And saint siluestre and his clerks answered to his dysputacion and to
them all alleway concludyng them by scripture / The Iuges which were true and
Just held more of the party of saint syluestre than of the Jews / Then
said one of the maistres of the Jews named Zambry / I merueylle said he / that
ye be so wise and enclyne you to their words / late us leave all thies words
and goo we to theffecte of the deeds / Then he did do come a cruel bulle /
and said a word in his eer and ano^ the bulle deyed / then the people were
all against siluester Then said siluester / believe not thou / that he has
named in the eere the name of Ihesu c^yst / but the name of som^e devil /
know ye verily / it is no great strength to slay a bulle For a man / or as a
lion or a serpent may well slay him / but it is great virtue to reyse him again
to life / then if he may not reyse him it is by the devil / And if he may
reyse him again to life / I shall believe that he is deed by the power of god /
And when the Judge herd this / they said to Zambry that had slain the bulle /
that he should reyse him again / Then he answered that if syluestre might reyse
him in the name of Ihesu of galylee / his maistre / then he would believe in
him / And thereto bond them all the Jews that were there / And saint
syluestre first made his orysons and prayers to our lord / and since came to the
bulle and said to him in his eere / Thou cursed creature that art entered in to
this bulle and have slain him / goo out in the name of Ihesu christ / In whose
name I comande the bulle / arise thou up / and goo you with the other bestes
debonayrly / And anon the bulle aroos / and went forth softly / Then the
queen and the Iuges which were paynems were converted to the faith / In this
time it happed that there was at Rome a dragon in a pytte / which every day
slew with his breath more than three C men / Then came the byssoppis of
thydolles unto the emperor and said to him / O thou most holy emperor / sith
the time that thou have received christian faith / the dragon which is in yonder
fosse or pytte sleeth every day with his breeth moo than three hundred men /
Then sent the emperor for saint Syluestre / and asked counseyl of him of this
matter / Saint siluestre answered that by the might of god he promised to make
him cease of this hurt and blechure / of this people / Then saint s^luestre
/ put him self to prayer / and saint Peter appiered to him and said Goo surely
to the dragon / and the ij prestes that been with the / take in thycompany / And
when thou shall come to him / thou shall say to him in this manner / Our lord
Ihesu christ which was born of the virgyne marye / crucyfyed / buried and aroos
/ and now sits on the right side of the fader / this is he that shall come to
deem and Judge the living and the deed / I comande the sathanas / that thou
abide him in this place till that be come / Then thou shall bind his mouth
with a threde / and sealled with thy seal wherein is thenprynte of the cross /
Then thou and the ij prestes shall come to me hoole and sauf and such ^rede
as I shall make ready for you ye shall ete / Thus as saint Peter has said saint
siluestre did / And when he ca^ to the pytte / he descended down an C and
fyfty stappes beryng with him ij ^anternes / and fond the dragon / and said
the words / that saint Peter had said to him / and bond his mouth with the
threde / and sealed it / and after returned / and as he ca^ upward again / he
met with two enchaunteurs / which followed him for to see if he descended /
which were almost deed of the stenche of the dragon / whom he brought with him
hoole and sound / which ano^ were baptized with a great multitude of people
with them / Thus was the cite of Rome delyuyrd fro double death / that was fro
the culture and worshypyng of false ydolles / and fro the vemyin of the dragon
/ At last when saint siluestre approached toward his death / he called to him
the clergy / and admonested them to have charity / And that they should
dylygently govern their chirches / And keep their flock fro the wulues / And
after the year of thyncarnacion of our lord three hundred and twenty he departed
out of this world and slept in our lord etc^ /

Thus ends the life of saint Siluester
Here follows the life of saint Poul the first heremyte
Saint Poul which was the first heremyte / as saint Iherome writes was in the
time of decius and valeryanus emperors the year of thyncarnacion of our lord
ijClvj / This holy man saint poul saw men for Christian faith cruelly tormented
/ wherefore he fled in to the deserte / Emonge whom he saw two cruelly
tourmented / The first / for that he abode fermly in his faith / The Judge did
do enoynte all his body with honey And did do bind his hondes by hynde him on
his back / And so did him be set in the hete of the son for to by byten
and stongen of flies and waspes / That other that was young he made him to lie
in a right soft bed / between ij shetes / emonge flowers and delectable
Roses and herbs sweet smellyng / And there in he was bounden so that he might
not meue him / After made an harlote a Rybaulde come to him allone for to
touch his members and his body to moeue to lecherye / Fynably when the
voluptuosyte of his flesh surmounted him / and might not deffende him self ne
his me^bres / he bote of a py^ce of his tongue and spitte it in her vysage /
which alleway enticed him to lecherye by touching and by kyssynges / And so he
voyded the temptacion flesshely / and the Rybaulde also / and deserved to have
lawde and victory / In this time saint poul to fore said was young about xvj
year of age / and dwelled in thebayde / which is a party of Egypt with his
suster mauryce / And when he saw the persecucions of christian men / he departed
and becam an heremyte so long and so many years / that he was old an honderd
and xiij year / In this time saint Anthonye was an heremyte in an other deserte
/ and was then lxxxx year of age / And on a time he thought in him self that
in the world was none so good ne so great an heremyte as he was him self /
Herupon came to him a reuelacio^ as he slepte / that bynethe all allow down in
that deserte was an heremyte better than he / And that he ought to goo and see
this holy man / Anon after the next day he took his staf / by which he
sustained him / and began in goo through that deserte / And it happed that he
met a person / which was half above an horse / and bynethe a man / whom the
fables of the poets call centaure / And anon made to fore him the sign of
the cross / And demanded of him where this holy man theremyte dwelled / And
he showed to him the way on the right side and anon vanysshyd away from him /
It is not certainly known if this best was a best of the deserte or the
devil in figure of a best / After this saint Anthonye met with a monstre in
a valeye beryng the fruit of a pal myer crooked and had in his forhede horns
and his legs and feet like a ghoot of the woods / And anon he made to fore
him the sign of the cross / This bestial man gaf to saint Anthonye the fruit
of the palmyer / And saint Anthonye demanded what he was / And he answered I
can mortal and dwell in deserte / And the sarasyns call us sacraros / I am
the messager of our company / we pray the that thou pray the lord for us /
we know well that the savior of the world is comen / And his renomee is spread
through the world / And by cause hereof noman should have doubtau^ce All men
know that in the time of Constantyn the emperor such ama^ was brought in to
the cite of Alexandre to fore the people / and when he was deed his body was
filled with salt / against the hete of the son / And was sent to the emperor
to Anthioche for a meruaylle / But return we to our matter / Saint Anthonye had
great labor in going by the deserte / where as was no way / Fynably he fond
a she wulf / which brought him by ye will of god unto thermytage of saint
poul But as soon as he knew that saint Anthonye came / hastily he shytte his
door / And saint Anthonye prayed him for charity / that he would opene it to him
/ and said thou wotest well who and wherefore I am come / I know well I am not
worthy / to render and give to the any thing for thy labor / Nevertheless I
shall not depart fro hens unto the time that I have seen the / At last he
opened his door / and s^^h entrebraced each other / And each of them did
reverence each to other / And saint poul demanded of thestate of the world and
of the governance / And if Christian faith were spredde and used ouerall / And
whiles they were thus talkyng A crow came fleyng / and brought to them two
loves if breed / And when the crow was goon / Saint Poul said be thou glad and
Ioyeful / For our lord is debonayre and mercyful / he has sent us bread for
to ete / It is xl year passed that every day he has sent me half a loof / But
now at thy coming he has sent ij hole loves / and double prouende / And they
had question to gydre until euensong time which of them both should entame or
bygynne to take of the breed / At last the bred departed even between their
hands / and then they ete / and drank of the well / or fontayne / After
graces said / they had all that night collacion to gydre / On the morn said
saint poul / Brother it is long since that I knew / that thou dwelledeth in
this region and in this contree / And god had promised to me thy company / I
shall now shortly deye / and shall goo to Ihesu christ / for to receive the crown
to me promised / Thou art comen hither for to burye my body / when saint
Anthonye herd that / anon he began tendrely to weep / and waylled prayeng that
he might deye with him and goo in his company / Saint Poul said / hit is need
yet that thou live for thy brethren / to the end that they by the ensample of
the / be made form and taught / wherefore I pray the return to thyn abaye /
And bring to me the mantel / which Athanases the bishop gaf to the / for to
wrappe in my body / Then saint Anthonye merueylled / of this that he knew of
this bishop / and of this mantel / and after durst nothing say / ^ut did to
him reverence / like as god had spoken to him / And weeping kyssed his feet and
his hondes / and came a^ayn to his abbaye with great trauayl and labor / for he
had fro that one part to that other many Iourneyes and foul way through hayes
and hedges / woods / stones / hills and valeyes / and saint Anthonye of great
age and feeble of fasting and not strong ne mighty / when he was comen to his
abbaye two of his disciples to him most secret / demanded of him saying /
Fair fader / where have ye ben so long / and he answered / Alas I wretchyd
sinner which bear falsely the name to be a monk / I have seen hely the
prop^^te I have seen Ioh^n the baptyst in deserte / and certes I have seen
saint poul in paradys / Thus spekyng and betyng his breast / he brought the
mantel out of his celle / And all stylly without mo words / he went again
the long way all allone / through the deserte unto saint poul thermyte having
great desire to see him / For he was aferde / lest he should deye er he might
come again to him / It happed in the second Journey where saint Anthony went
through the deserte the third hour of ye day / he saw the soul of saint poule
shynyng ascend in to heaven emonge a great company of Angellis / of prophets /
and also of appostlis / And ano^ he fylle down to therthe weeping and wayllyng /
and cryeng with an hye voys / Alas poul / wherefore leuest you me so soon /
which have so lytil seen the / Then he had so great desire to see the corpse
or body / that he passed all the remenaunt of his way as soon as a bird
fleyng / like as he was woond to tell and reherce / And when he ca^ to the
celle of saint poul he fond that the body was right up on his knees / and the
vysage and hondes adressyd toward heaven / and supposed he had been alive and had
made his prayers but when he had aduysed it / he knew well that he was passed
out of this world what wepynges and what wayllynges he made upon the body / it
were a pytouse thing to here / among all other he said / O holy soul / thy
body shows to be deed this / that thou dydist in thy life / After this he was
much abashed how he should burye the body / For he had none Instrument to make
his sepulture / Then came two lions / which much debonairly made a pytte
after the quantyte of his body And saint Anthony buried his body therein / And
he took with him the cote of saint poul which was made and fastened to gydre
with the leaves of a palmyer / in manner of a matte / And afterward for great
reverence saint Anthonye ware this cote and clad him with all / in great and
solemn festes / Thus this holy man saint poul deyed in the year of
thyncarnacion of our lord ijClxxx and viij / Late us then pray to him / that
he Impetre and get us remyssyon of our sins / that after this life / we may
come to everlasting Joy and bliss in heaven / Amen

Thus ends the life of saint Poul the first hermyte
Here follows of saint Remyge / and first the interpretacion of his name
REmigius is said of remi / that is to say fedyng and geos that is earth / as
who says fedyng therthely people with doctrine / Or of geon / that is a
wrasteler / for he was a pastor and a wrasteler / he fed his flock with the
word of prechyng / with suffragies of prayeng / and with example of
conversation / There is three manner of armor / that is for the deffence / the
shield / for to fight / the swerd for his sauacion and health the habergeon and
helm / he wrastled against the devil with the sheld of faith / with the swerd
of the word of god and with the helm of hope / Ignacius Archebysshop of Raynes
wrote his life /

Of the life of saint Remige
REmigius an holy doctor and confessor glorious of our lord was to for his
birth provided of our lord / and forsee^ of an holy heremyte / When the
persecucion of the wandles had almost wasted and destroyed neygh all france /
there was a man recluse holy and virtuous which had lost his sight / which
often prayed to our lord for pees / and welfare of the church of france / he
had on a time a vysion / and him seemed an angel came to him and said / know
thou that the woman that thou know named Alyne shall bring forth a sone that
shall be named Remyge / which shall delyure all the contre fro this persecucion
/ And wha^ he awoke / he came to the hows of this Alyne / And told to her his
vysion And she would not believe it by cause of her age / the recluse said / it
shall he so as I have said / And when thou have given thy child souke / thou
shall give to me of thy milk to put upon mine eyes / and therewith I shall be
hool and recouure my sight again / And like as he said / all these things
happened / And this woman had a child named Remyge which when he came to the
age of discrecion / he fled the world and entered in to a reclusage / And since
after for the great Renomee of his holy life / when he had been xxij year therein
/ he was elect and chosen to be Arch^bysshop of Raynes / he was so debonayr
that lityl birds ca^ and ete on his table / and took mete at his hand / It
happed on a day that he was lodged in an hows of a good woman which had but a
lytyl wyn in her tonnel or vassel / And saint Remyge went in to the celer and
made the sign of the cross upon the tonne / And prayed a while / Anon the
tonne was so full that it leeep over by the merytes of the good saint / Now it
happed that clodomus the king of france which was a paynem might not be
converted for any prechyng that his wife might do / which was a a christian
woman unto the time that a great host of Alema^s came in to france / Then by
thadmonestement of his wife made a vow / that if the god yt his wife worshipped
would give him victory he would be baptized at his retornyng fro the bataylle /
thus as he demanded / he vaynquysshid the battle and after came to Raynes to
saint Remyge and prayed him that he would christian him / And when saint Remyge
baptized him / he had no cresme ready / then a douue descended fro heaven
which brought the crysme in an Ampull / of which the king was enoynted / And
this Ampull is kept in the church of saint Remyge at Raynes / of which the
kings of france ben enoynted wha^ they ben crowned Saint Remyge had a nyece
which was married to a clerk named genebaldus which by devotion left his wife
for to enter in to religion / Then saint Remyge saw that the sea of Raynes
was over great / And ordained a see of a bysshopryche at laon / and made
genebald first bishop of that place / when genebald was bishop / his wife came
theder to see him / and remembered of the pryuete that they were wont to have
to gydre / and lay on a night with her / and engendered on her a child / when
his wife knew that she was great / and let him have knowleche thereof / and
when he wist that it was a sone / he commanded that it should be named thief / by
cause he had enge^dryd it by theft / After for to quench the suspection and
the words of the people / he suffered that his wif should come to him as she did
to fore And ano^ after she conceived a daughter / whom he commanded to name a
foxes whelpe / And after came to saint Remyge / and confessed him of his sin /
and took the stole of his neck and would leave his bysshoprich / ^ut saint
Remyge after he had confessyd him comforted him / and gaf him penance / and
shytte him in a lytil celle vij year long and gaf to him bread and water / and
in the mean while he governed the church / him self / At end of vij year
an angel came to the prison / and said to him that he had down well his penance
/ and bad him goo out of the prison / to whom he said I may not goo out / For
my lord saint remyge has closed the door and sealed it / And the angele said
to him / know thou that the door of heaven is opened to the / I shall opene this
door without brekyng of the seal / which saint Remyge has scalled / And anon
the door was opened / Then genebald fylle down in the mids of the door in
manner of a cross / and said / if our lord Ihesu christ came hither / I shall not
goo out / but if saint Remyge which shytte and closed me herin / come and
bring me out And then than gel went anon and fette saint remyge / and
brought him to laon / And he delyuerd him out of prison / And remysed him and
set him again in his see there / where he lived after all the days of his
life holyly / After his death / thief his sone was made bishop after him /
which is also a saint in heaven / And at last / saint Remyge after that god
had showed many miracles for him / he departed out of this life unto everlasting
Joy the year of the Incarnacion of our lord vC /

Here ends the lif of saint Remige
Here follows the life of saint hylare
Thynterpretacion of his name
Hylaire is said of Ioyouste / For he was Joyous in the service of god / Or
hylaire is said virtuous and hye / For he was hye and strong in science / and
virtuous in his life / Or hylaire is said of isle / which is to say derke matter
/ For he had in his dictes great obscurete and profoundnes /

Of the lif of saint Hilaire
Saint hilaire which was bishop of poytiers was born in the contre of Guyan /
he had a wif wedded / and a daughter / And where he was in habyte seculer / he
lived after the life of a monk / he prouffyted so much in holy life and
sciences / that he was chosen Archebisshop of poytiers / A manner of an heresye
reigned in his contre and through all france / which was the sect of the
Arryans / the which he destroyed to his power / Nevertheless by the comandem^t
of the emperor which was of the party of the heretics by the suggestion of
two byssoppis of that sect / he was exiled / with which ij bisshoppis he
disputed and ouercam the^ afterward / For they might not gaynsaye the truth
of the matter / ne could not bear ne answer to his eloquence / so that he was
constrained to come again to poytiers / And as he passed by an I Will of the sea /
wicke was full of serpents / he chaced them away by the virtue of his
comandem^t and by his sight only / And pyght a staf in the myddle of the isle /
and gaf to the serpents liberte to come to that staf / and not to pass
ferther / And the serpents obeyed him / which part is no land now but see /
When saint hylaire came to poytiers / he met a child deed born for to be
buried / and the child was not baptized / which child by the virtue of his
prayer he raised to life / For he lay long in the duste in prayer / And when
he aroos out of his prayer the child aroos fro death to life / Saint hylayre had
a daughter named Apra / And would have be married / but saint hylaire preached to
her so much of thestate of virgynyte / that she changed her purpoos / And
when she was confermed in this will and purpoos / saint hylaire doubted that
she should change / And prayed our lord for to take her whiles she was in good
porpoos / And anon she deyde / And saint hylaire buried her / And when her
mother the wife of saint hylaire saw that her daughter was deed she prayde to
her husbonde that he should Impetre and get for her / like as he had don for
his daughter / And anon as saint hylayre had made his oryson She deyed / And by
this manner he sent to fore him / his wife and his daughter / In this time the
pope lion which favored heresye called a cou^seyl of bysshoppis / but he
sent not for saint hylaire / that he should come thereto / not wythstondyng
saint hylaire came theder / when the pope saw him comen / he commanded that
noman should arise against him / ne give him no place / Then said the pope to
him / thou art hylaire the cock / and not the sone of an hen / And saint
hylaire answered I am hylaire and no cock / but a bishop in gallia / that is in
france / then said the pope / thou art hylaire gallus And I am leo of the
papal see Judge / to whom hylaire said / if thou be leo / yet art thou not of
the trybe of Judah / Then the pope had great indignacion and said to him /
Abide you a lytyl / and I shall pay to the thyn hyer / And saint hylayre answered
^ if thou come not again who shall pay me for yt / and the pope answered / I
shall come again and shall beat down thy pride / Then the pope went down in to
the low chamber for to ease him / And by the conduyte of his neither part
voyded out all the entraylles of his body / and so deyde suddenly / thus then
as he abode the pope / saint hylaire fond no place / to sytte on / ne none
would remeue to make him place / And when he saw that / he said / Domini est
terra / therthe longs to our lord / and satte down upon therthe / And therthe
aroos up by miracle by the will of our lord / in such wise that he satte as
hye as the other / And anon after / word came that the pope was deed / Then
saint hylaire confermed all the other bishops that were there in the faith /
and so confermed each went in to his country / In the end when saint hylaire
had Impetred of god many miracles / to be shewde by his prayer / he becam seek
/ and saw his death approach / Then he called to him one his chapelayn whom
he much loved and said to him / Goo thou out / And bring to me word what thou
hyerest / when he had been long without he came in / and told to saint hylaire
that he had herd a great noise in the cite / And when it was mydnyght he sent
his chapelayn again / to herkene / as he had don to fore / And when he came
again in to the chamber for to tell that he had herd nothing / A great clear
light entered in that the priest might not behold it / And when the light
departed / saint hylaire deyde / that was the year of grace three honderd xl /
Late us pray to him that he pray for us Amen /

Here ends the life of saint hylaire
And next follows thynuencion of saint fremyn
IN the time of thynuecion of saint fremyn the martyr / was saint sauue bishop
of Amyans / And saw that to fore him in the time of saint honor / our lord
had don take up the bodies of saint fulcien / saint victorice / and saint
gencyen / And thought all an hole night upon the body of saint fremyn the
martyr / And when it was day this holy man saint sauue / somoned the clergy
and the people to fast and make prayers through the cite of amyens / to the end
that our lord would show them the place where the body of saint Fremyn the
martyr lay / And on the third day our lord sent such a miracle / that he
sent a Raye of the son / which persed the wall of the monastery on the same
place where the body lay / then they began to dygge and delue there / And
when they came nyghe the body / there issued out so great a swetenes / out of the
pytte that all they that were there / weende they had been in paradis And it
seemed that if all the espyces of the world had been stamped to gydre / it should
not have smellyd so well ne so sweet and this sweet odor spredde through the
cite of amyens / and diverse cytees about / that is to wete / terwaus /
Cambray / and noyon / And the people of these cytees meued them each from his
place with candellis and offrynges without sayer or coma^der / but for the
odor that so spredde And came unto this glorious saint / And as the body was
born in the cite of amyens / there were showed such miracles that never none
were like found ne seen to fore of any saint / For the elymentes meuyd them by
the miracle of this saint / The snow that was that time great on therthe was
turned in to pouldre and duste / by the hete that was then / And the yse that
henge on the trees / becam flowers and leaves / And the meadows about Amyens
flowred and becam grene / And the son which by his nature / should goo low /
that day ascended as hye as she is on saint Ioh^ns day at none in the somer /
And as men bare the body of this saint / the trees enclyned and worshipped the
body / And all manner seek men of what maladye they had / they received health
/ in the Inuencion of the blessed body of saint Fremyn / And the burgeyses that
were in their gowns and mantellis / had so great hete / that they called their
feruantes and bond men of whom there were many that day in Amyens / and
affranchysed them for to bear their clothes in to the cite of Amyens / Our lord
did do show such miracles / and so far sent the odor / that the lord of
baugensy / which was at a wyndowe and was seek of lazarye / and he smellyd the
odor / and was anon guarysshyd and hool / And he took his gold and came and
did homage unto the body of saint fremyn in the cite of Amyens / Our lord has
showed many miracles for this glorious saint And much he ought to be honored
in this world / And then pray we unto this blessid saint / Saint Fremyn that
he pray for us to our lord that he will pardonne us our sins / and ot troy
and grant to us the glory of heuene / Amen

Thus ends thynuencion of saint Fremyn
Here follows the lif of saint Machaire / And first the interpretacion of his
name /
MAchaire is said of Maca / which is as much to say as engyn / and of Achis /
which is to say virtue / Or machaire is said of Amatham yt is to say smytyng
/ and of Rys that is to say maystre / For he was Ingenyous against the fallace
of the devil / virtuous of life / Smytyng in chastysyng his body / and maistre
in the governance of prelacye /

Saint machaire was in a deserte / and entered in to a pytte or sepulture where
as had been buried many bodies of paynems for to sleep / And he drew out of
these bodies and leyde it under his head instead of a pylowe / Then came
theder deuylles for to make him a ghaste and aferde / And said one to another
/ Come with me to bayne the / And the body that lay under his head said / I
may not come For I have a pilgrim upon me lyeng that I may not meue / For all
this saint machayre was not aferd / but he beat the body with his fyste / and
said / arise and goo if thou may / when the deuylles saw that they might not
make him aferde / they cried with a great voys / Machaire thou have
veynquysshed and overcome us twyes /

On a time as machaire was nygh his hows / the devil came with a great sithe in
his neck / And would have smeton therewith saint machaire / And the devil said
to him / Thou do to me great vyolence and force / for I may not preuaylle
against the / loo what thou do I do / thou fastest / and I ete not / thou
wakest / and I never sleep / but there is one thing in which thou ouercomest me
/ And Machaire said / what is that / to whom the devil said / that is humylyte
and thy meekness / by which I may not preuaylle against the / It happed on a
time that a great temptacion came upon saint Machayre / and much tempted him /
and anon he filled a sack full of stones and leyd it on his neck / and ^^re it
many Iourneyes to gydre / through the deserte / Then an other hermyte met
him / and demanded him why he bare so great aburthen / and he answered I
traueylle my body / by cause it suffers not me in peace / And thus I vex him
that vexid me / This holy abbot saint machaire saw passing to fore him a devil
in thabyte of a man which was ye clothyng of an herawde all lynnen full of
hooles / and in every hool henge a fyolle / And he demanded him whyther he
went / The deuylle answered him / I goo for to give drynk unto thies hermytes /
then demanded him saint machayre wherefore he bare so many fyolles / And he
answered / I shall offer to hem one and if he may not drink of that one / I shall
proferre him another and so the third / and of all the other / each after
other / until they may find some thing playsant to them for to fall in to
temptacion / and wha^ he came again / saint machaire called him and demanded him
what he had founden / And he answered that he had evil spedde / For they were
all so holy and blessed that they retched not of his drink / sauf one only
which is named theodistus / Then saint machaire aroos and came to thies
hermytes and fond them all in good point sauf him whom the devil had tempted /
Then saint machaire did so much by his exortacion / that he brought him
again in to the right way / Another time saint machaire met the devil / and
demanded him whens he came / and the devil answered / I come fro vysytyng thy
brethern / then said saint machaire / how done they / the devil answered evil
/ and he asked wherefore And the devil said for they ben all holy / And that
werst is there was one that was mine / And I have lost him / For he is now made
holyer than the other / when saint machaire herd this / he gaf l^uynges and
thankynges to god / It happed on a time saint machaire fond in his way the
head of a deed man / And he demanded of it whose head it was / and the head
answered of a paynem / And machaire said to him / where is thy soul / he
answered in hell / And he demanded if it were deep in hell / and he said deper
than is fro heaven to earth / And after he demanded if there were any bynethe
him / And he said the Jews ben lower than he was / he asked if there were any
lower or bynethe the Jews / to whom he said that the false christian men ben yet
lower / and depper in hell than the Jews / For as much as they have dyspyted
and vy^onyed the blood of Ihesu christ of which they were redeemed / so much
the more be they tormented / On a time saint machaire went in a deserte and
at end of every mile he set a reed in therthe for to have knowleche thereby
to torn again / And went forth ix day Journey / and after he slepte / And the
devil took all these reeds and bond them and leyd them at his head /
wherefore he had great labor / for to come again / in to his hows / An heremyte
which was in deserte / was much tempted for to goo again / to the world / And
he thought in his heart / that he should do more good to be among the people /
than he should do in his hermytage / Then he told all this to saint machayre
/ And saint machayre said to him / thus shall you say to thy thoughts that for
the love of Ihesu christ I keep the walls of this celle / It happed on a time
that saint machaire kylde a flee that bote him / And when he saw the blood of
this flee / he repented him And so repentaunt of that would revenge it and anon
unclothed him and went nakyd in the deserte vj monethis and suffered him self
to be byten of the flies / After this saint machaire wha^ he had long lived /
and god had showed many miracles for him / and had flowrid in many virtues / he
deyed and rendered his soul unto our lord Ihesu christ qui est benedictus in
secula seculorum Amen /

Thus ends the life of saint Machaire /
Hyer begins the lif of saint Felix said enpices
FElix was surnamed enpices / and is said of the place where he rests / or of
the poyntellis of greffes / a greffe is proprely callid a poyntel to write in
tablis of wax / by which he suffered death / And som^e say that he was a
scolemaistre / and taught children / And was to them much Rygorous / After he
was known of the paynems / And by cause he confessed plainly that he was
christian and byleued in Ihesu christ / he was delyuerd to be tormented in to the
hands of the children / his escoliers whom he had taught and learned / which
scoliers show him / with their poyntellis / pryckis and greffes / and yet the
church holds him for no martyr / but for a confessor / And the paynems said
to him / that he should do sacrefyse to thydollis / but he blewe on them / and
anon they fylle to therthe / It is read in a lege^de that when mychene bishop
and valerian fled the persecucion of the paynems / the bishop was tormented
with hungre and thurst so much that he fylle down to the ground / wherefore
Felix was sent of an aungele to him / And he bare nothing with him for to give
to him and he saw by him a clustre of reysens hongyng ^n a tree which he leyd
on his sholdres / hastily and bare it with him / And when the bishop was deed
Felix was elect and chosen to be bishop / And as he preched on a time / the
persecutours sought him / And he hid him in the clyftes of a broken wall /
and incontynente by the will of god / came spyncoppes and made their work and
nets before him / that they might not find him / And when the tyrauntes could
not find him they went their way / And he went thens / and ca^ to the hows
of a wydowe / And took there his refection of her three months And yet he saw
her never in the vysage / And at last when the peace was made / he went him
in to his church / And there deyed and rested in our lord / and was buried by
the cite in a place that was called pynces / And this Felix had a brother /
which was in like wise named felix / And when this felix was constrained to
adoure thydolles / he said / ye be enemies unto your gods / For if ye bring
me to them I shall blow on them like as my brother did / and they shall fall
to therthe / and break / On a time this Felix did do labor his gardyn /
where he had set cooles and wortes for his use / And som^e of his neighbors
would have stolen away these cooles and wortes / and houed in the gardyn all
the night and dygged / And on the morning saint felix salewed them / And anon
they confessed their sin / And he pardonned them And then they went their
way / And a litil while after / the paynems came for to take saint Felix / And
ano^ so great dolor and pain took them / that they began to howl as dogs /
And he said to them / believe ye in god and say ye that Ihesu Christ is very
god / And do you to be baptized and ye shall be hool and your pain shall seasse
/ And so they did / and anon they were all hool / And after the bishop of
thydolles came to him and said / Sire as soon as our god saw the / he fled /
And when I said why fleest thou / He said I may not suffer the virtue of Felix /
And when my god doubts the / much more I ought to doubt the / And when
Felix had confermed him in the faith / he baptized him / And Felix said to them
that adoured Appolyn / if appolyn be very god / late him say to me what I hold
in my hand / And he had in his hand a cedule / wherein was wreton the oryson
of our lord / that is the Pater noster / And he might not answer / wherefore
the paynems were converted to our lord / And at last when he had song his
mass and the peace given to the people / he fylle down in prayer upon the
pauement of the church / and passed out of this world unto our lord /

Thus ends the life of saint Felix
Here follows the life of saint marcell / and thynterpretacion of his name
Marcel is as much to say as denyeng to do evil / or i. is said as smytyng
the sees / that is to say / the aduersytees of the world For the world
assambleth the sea / For like as Crysostome says upon matthew / contynuel dread
is his confuse / And alleway in the sea is contynuel dread / thymage of death
and perpetuel dysordynance without ceassyng /

Of saint Marcell
Saint Marcell was chyef bishop and (...) of Rome / he went to chastyse and
repreue maxymyen the emperor of this / that he was over cruel to Christian people
/ And the emperor had of him so great despyte / that he made of the hows of a
good woman of which saint marcel had made a church / the said emperor made
it a stable for horses / And in the place where saint marcel had song mass
the emperor made him to keep his horse in which seruyse saint marcell was all
his live after / and in that seruyse saint marcell deyed holily the year of
thyncarnacion of our lord two hundred and four score /

Here ends the life of saint Marcell pope /
Here follows of saint Anthonye / and first thynterpretacion of his name
ANthonye is said of Ana / which is as much to say as hye and tenens that is
holdyng / which is as much to say as holdyng hye things / and despysyng the
world / he despised the world and said it is deceyuyng / transitorye / and
bitter / And Athanase wrote his life /

Of the life of saint Anthonye
Saint Anthonye was born in egypt of good and relogious fader and mother / And
when he was but xx year old / he herd on a time in the church read in the
gospel / that said / if you wilt be perfight / goo and selle all that thou
have / and give it to pour men / And then according thereto / he sold all yt
he had and gaf it to the pour people and becam an heremyte / he had over many
te^ptacions of the devil / Then on a time when he had ouercomen the spirit
of fornycacio^ which tempted him therein / by the virtue of his faith / ye devil
came to him in the form of a lityl child all black / and fille dou^ at his feet
/ and confessed that he was the devil of fornycacion / which saint Anthonye
had desired and prayed to see him / for to know him / that so tempted young
people / Then said saint Anthonye since I have perceived that thou art so ^oul
a thing / I shall never doubt the After he went in to an hole or cave to hyde
him / And anon he fond there a a great multitude of deuylles that so much
beat him / that his servant bare him upon his sholdres in to his house as he had been deed / when the other heremytes were assembled and wept his death and would
have don his seruyse / suddenly saint Anthonye reuyued and made his servant to
bear him in to the pytte again / where the deuyllis had so evil beten him / And
began to somone the deuyllis again which had beten him to bataylles / And anon
they came in form of diverse bestes wild and savage / of whom that one howled
/ another syfled / and another cried / and another brayed / and assaylled saint
Anthonye / that one wi^h the horns / the other with their teeth and the other
with their paws / and vngles / and dystourned and all to rent his body /
that he supposed well to deye / Then came a clear bryghtnes And all the bestes
fled away / and saint Anthonye understood that in this great light our lord
came / and he said tweyes / who art thou / the good Ihesu answered / I am here
Anthony / then said saint Anthony / O good Ihesu where have thou ben so long
/ why were thou not here with me at beginning / to help me and to hele my
wounds / then our lord said / I was here / but I would see and abide to see
thy bataylle / And by cause thou have manly foughten and well mayntened thy
battle / I shall make thy name to be sprad through all the world / Saint
Anthony was of so great fervor and brennyng love to god / that when maximus
the emperor slew and martred christian men / he followed the martres that he might
be a martyr with them / and deserve it / And was sorry that martirdom was not
given to him After this as saint Anthony went in deserte he fond a plater of
silver in his way / then he thought whens this plater should come / seeing it
was no way for any man to pass / And also if it had fallen fro any man he
should have herd it sown / in the falling / Then said he well / that the
devil ^ad leyde it there for to tempte him / and said / Ha devil thou wenys^ to
tempte me / and deceive me / but it shall not be in thy power / then the
plater vanysshed away / as a lytyl smoke / And in like wise it happed him of a
mass of gold yt he fond in his way^ / which the devil had cast for to
deceive him / which he took and cast it in to the fire and anon it vanysshed
away / After it happed that saint Anthony on a time was in prayer / and saw in
a vysion all the world full of snares and grynnes / Then cried saint Anthony
and said / O good lord who may escape fro these snares / And a vo^s said to him
very humylyte shall escape them without mo^e / when saint Anthonye on a time
was left in the air / the deuylles c^m against him / and laid to him all the
euylles that he had do fro his chyldhode tofore the angellis / Then said
thangellis / thou ought not to tell the ^uy^les that hen deffeted / but
say if thou know any evil since he was made a monk / then the deuyllys
contryued many euyllys / And when they might not preue them / the Angellis bare
him hyer than to fore / and after set him again in his place / Saint Anthonye
re^^^^eth of him self that he had seen a man so great and s^ hye / that he
vaunted him self to (...) the virtue and the prouydence of ^od / and said to me
(...) of me what thou wylt / and I shall give it to the And I spytte in the
mids of his vysage / And anon I armed me with the sign of the cross / and
^anne upon him / and anon he vanysshid away / And after this the devil
appyere^^ to him in so great a stature that he towched the heaven / And when
saint Anthony had demanded him what he was / He answered I am the devil / and
demand the why these monks and thyes cursed christian men do m^ thus much
shame /

Saint Anthonye said they do it by good right For thou do to them the werst
you can / And the devil answered I do to the^ none harm / but they trouble
each other / I am destroyed and come^ to naught by cause that Ihesu christ
regneth ouerall / A young man passed by saint Anthonye and his bow in his
hand and beheld how saint Anthonye played with his felawes / and was evil a
paid / Then saint Anthony said to him / that he should bend his bow / and so
he did and shot ij or iij shottes to fore him / and anon he vnbente his bow
/ Then demanded him saint Anthony why he held not his bow bente And he
answered that it should be then over weak and feeble / Then said to him saint
Anthonye / in like wise play the monks / for to be after more strong to
serve god / A man demanded of saint Anthony what he might do to plese god /
and he answered over all where thou shall be / or shall goo / have god to fore
thyn eyes / and the holy scripture / And hold the in one place all stylle /
And walk not ne roylle not about in the contree / do these three things /
And thou shall be sauf / An abbote came to saint Anthonye for to be cou^seylled
of him what he myht do for to be saved / Saint Anthonye answered to him / have
none affyance in the good that thou have don / ne that thou have kept thy belly
and thy tongue well sobrely / And repent the not of penance that thou have
done / I say For like as fysshes that have been long in the water / when they
come in to dry land they must dye / In like wise the monks that go on out
ot their cloystre or selles / if they converse long with secul^ers they must
needs lose their holiness / and leave their good life It behooves the monks
that they be solytarye and that they have three bataylles that is of heeryng /
of spekyng / and of seeing / And if he have but one of these bataylles / that
is of the heart / yet he has ouermoche / Som^e heremytes ca^ to saint Anthonye
for to vysite him / and their abbot was with them / Then said saint Anthony
to the heremytes / ye have a good wise man with you / And after he said to the
abbot / thou have founden good brethern / Then answered thabbot / Truly I have
good brethern / but there is none door on their hows / each body may enter that
will and goo in to the stable and unbind the ass of within / And this said
he by cause that the brethern had over much their mowthes open to speak / For
anon as they have thought / on a thing / it come to the mowthe / Then saint
Anthony said / ye ought to know that there be three bodily menynges / that one
is of nature / another of ouermoche plente of metes / and the third of the
devil / There was an hermyte that had renou^ced the world / and not perfighly /
For he had somewhat propre to him self whom saint Anthonye sent to the market
to bye flesh / And as he was coming and brought the flesh / the dogs
assaylled him and all to ta^^ him / and took the flesh from him / And when
he came to saint Anthonye / he told him what was happed to him And then said
saint Anthonye to him / thus as the hounds have do to the / so done ye
deuyllis to monks that keep money / and have som^e propre to them self / On a
time as saint anthony was in wyldernes in his prayer and was weary / he said to
our lord / lord I have great desire to be saved / but my thoughts let me /
Then appiered an angele to him and said do as I do / and thou shall be sauf
/ And he went out and saw him one while labor / and another while pray /
do thus and thou shall be saved / On a time when the brethern hermytes were
assembled to fore saint Anthonye they demanded of him of the state of sowles /
when they be departed fro the body / And the next night after / a voys called
saint Anthonye / And said arise and goo out and see up on hye / when saint
Anthonye byheld upward on hye he saw one long and terryble / whose heed
touched the clouds / which kept people having wings that would have ^ledde to
heaven / And this great man retained and caught som^e / and other he might not
reteyne ne let for they flewhe forth up /

Then he herd a noise fulle of Joy and another full of sorrow / And he
understood that this was the devil / that retained som^e sowles that went not
to heaven / And the other he might not hold ne reteyne / wherefore he made
sorrow / and for the other he made Joy / And so he herd the sorrow and Joy
meddled to gydre / It happed on a time that saint anthony labored with his
brethern the hermytes / And he saw a vision much sorrowful / And therefore he
kneled down on his knees / and prayed our lord that he would empesshe the great
sorrow that was to come / Then the other hermytes demanded what thing it was
/ And he said that it was a great sorrow / For I have seen great plente of
bestes / which enuyronned me / which fered all the contre / And I wot well
that this is to say that there shall come a great trouble of men like unto
beestes that shall defoule the sacraments of holy church Then came a voys
from heaven to saint Anthony that said / that great abhomynacion shall come to
mine altar / And anon after the heresy of Arryens began And much troubled
holy church and did many euyllis / They beat monks and other all naked to
fore the people / and slew christian men like sheep / upon the aultres / and in
especial one balachyn / did great persecucion / to whom saint Anthony wrote a
lettre which said / I see the ire and male talente of our lord coming upon the
/ if thou suffer not the christian live in peace / Then I comande the that thou
do to them no more vylonnye / or thou shall have a meschaunce hastily / The
unhappy man received thyes lettres / and began to mocque saint Anthonye / and
spytte on hit / and beat well him that brought the lettre / And sent again to
saint Anthonye these words / if thou have so great charge of thy monckes come
to me and I shall give to the my disciplyne / But it happed that the xv day
after / he mounted upon an horse over debonayr / And nevertheless when the horse
felt him upon him he bote him on the legs and thyes / that he deyde on the
third day / It happed an other time that the hermytes were comen to saint
Anthonye and demanded of him a collacion / Then said saint Anthonye / do ye
this that is wreton in the gospel / if one give to the a stroke on that one
cheke / show him that other / And they answer we may not do so / Then said
he / suffer ye it ones debonayrly / they answered we may not / Then said saint
Anthony to his servant / give them to drink good wyn / For these monckes ben
over delycious / Fair brethern put your self to prayer / For ye have much
great need / At last saint Anthonye assembled the heremytes / And gaf to
them the peace / and deyde and departred out of this world holyly when he was of
the age of an honderd and v year / pray we to him / that he pray for us

Here ends the life of saint Anthonye
Of saint Fabian and thynterpretacion of his name first
FAbian is as much to say as making soueuerayn beatitude or blessidnes / that
is to wit in getyng in three manner wises or manners / First by right and reason
of adopcion / of byeng in achate and by vyctorye /

Of saint Fabian the martyr
Saint Fabian was a cytezeyn and bourgeys of Rome / And it happed when the pope
was deed / that the people assembled for to chese another pope / And saint
fabian came to the election for to know who should be elect and chosen to that
dygnyte / And anon a white douue descended from heaven / and rested upon his
head / And when the people saw yt they merueylled much And all they by common
accord chees him for to be pope / This holy man fabian after when he was pope
/ he ordained through out all the contrees vij dekens and to them vij subdekens
/ for to write the lives of martirs / There was an Emperor in his time named
phylyppe / which was much synful and came boldly in the vygyle of ester / in
to the church for to be houselyd and co^myned / whom the pope droof away / and
denied to him the comunyon / until he had goon and shryuen him of his sins /
and let him stand among the seculiers / This holy pope also / ordained the

Of saint Sebastian and first thynterpretacion of his name
SEbastian is said of sequens and beatitudo / and astin and ana / that is to
say following the blessydnes / of the heavenly cite / and this he gace v manner
wyses after saint Austyn / that is to say he gate by pouerte the regne / with
sorrow Joy / with labor rest / with trowble glory / and with death life / Or
sebastianus is said of basto / For by the help of christ he flourid in the
church / And hada custom^e to comfort the marters in their torm^tis

Of saint Sebastian
Saint Sebastian was a man of great faith a good christian man / And was born in
Herbo^ne / and after taught and endoctryned in the cite of melan and was so well
byloued of dyoclesian and maximian emperors of Rome / that they made him
maistre and duc of their main and power / and alleway would have him in their
presence / And he was alleway with them in habyte of a knight / and was gyrde
with a gyrdle of gold above / like as was used / And all this did he not for
Iolyte / ne for cause that he dredde death or to deye for the love of Jesus christ
/ but he did it for to comfort the cryste^ men in their bileue / when they
were in destresse for to renye the faith for dread of torme^tis of their body /
It happed that ij brethern germayns very christian men and noble of lignage named
marcus and marcellianus were taken and constrained by the^perours for to
worshipe and do sacrefyse unto thydolles / And there was given to the^ respite
of xxx days to be in prison without to receive death for their cryste^ faith /
within which time they might counsel and advise them self whether they would
do sacrefise to thydolles / or to leave / and their friends were suffered in this
time of respite to come to the^ in prison / for tentrete and revoke them fro
their faith for to save their lives / Then came their parentis and friends to
them and bygan to say / whens comes this hardness of heart / that ye despise
the old age of your fader and mother which ben now old / ye get unto the^ new
sorrows / the great pain that they had in your birth / was not so great as
the sorrow that they have now / and the sorrow that your mother suffers is not to
rehearse / wherefore right dear friends we pray you that ye will to these
sorrows put sum remedy / And depart you and leave the error of the christian
men / And anon after these words their mother came and entered in / in cryeng and
teryng the heeres of her head / in showing her pappes and said all weeping /
Alas I am meschaunt and unhappy that lose my two sons / that I have given
souke and nourisshyd so swetely / Thou fair sone thou were sweet and debonaire
to me / And to that other she said / thou were like and semblest well thy fader
/ Alas to what meschief and sorrow am I delyuerd / for you my fair sons / I
lose my sons which by their owen will goon for to deye / My most dear children
have ye mercy on your sorouful mother / that am in so great mesease / and in so
great / Wepyngis for you / O pour caytyf that I am what shall I do that lose my
two sons and to the death I see them goo / by their fre will / Alas this is a
new manner of death / for to desire the death / to fore it come / The mother had
uneath said her complaynt / but that their fader was brought between ij
servants which at thentre shewde to his sons dust upon the pouerte of his
hoore head And cried Alas I sorrowful caytyf come to the death of my two sons /
which by their owen agreement will deye / O my ouerderest sons that were the
sustenance and staf of mine old age / swetely nourysshed and taught and learned
in science / what is this open folisshnes and rage that is comen on you and
causes you to love and desire so the death / there was never such a folly ne
rage seen in the world / O ye my friends come forth and help me to bywepe my
children / ye that have hertes of pity / And ye old and young weep ye / And I
will weep so much / that I see not the death of my sons / In the while that the
fader thus wept and said / came the two wives of these ij sons / which bare
in their arms their chyldreen / which weeping and cryeng said / Say ye now
that been our dear husbondes / In what ward leave ye us and your children / Alas
what shall bycome of us / our children and our goods / that for your sake shall
be lost Alas caytyues that we be / what thing is to us / happened / how have ye
heart of iron / in what manner may ye so be harded so out of nature / and so
cruel that also despise your fader and mother / and refuse all your friends /
chase aaway your wives / and renye and forsake your children / and with your
will deliver your self for to deye shamefully / Of thise lamentable words to
fore wreto^ / the ij said sons marcus and marcellianus were so abashed and
their hertes mollified / that almost were returned fro the christian faith / and
would for the favor of their pare^tis and friends have don sacrefyse / to
thydolles / but at thise words was saint sebastian / as a knight / when he
saw the^ thus traveled and so amolisshid / anon came to the^ and said / O ye
right noble knights of Ih^u christ wise and hardy which ben come^ to the
victory / and now goo abacke and for a few blaundissyng words vain and
miserable ye will lose the victory permanable / lose ye not the euerlayng lif
/ for the blau^dysshyng words of wymen / be ye example to other christian me^
for to be strong in the faith / Address ye your hertes above ye world / and
lose ye not your crown for the wepynges of your wives and children / They that
now weep certes should this day be glad and Joyous / if that they knew / yt ye
know / They we ne that there be none other lif / but this / which they see to
fore their eyes / which after this shall come to naught / if they knew what is
that other life / without death and thithoute heaviness / in which is Joy
permanable and everlasting without doubt / they would haste the^ for to goo
with you unto that life / and should repute this life as vain / For it is full of
myserye and also falls / and since the beginning of the world has deceived all
his friends / and conquered all them yt have affiance in him / For she has lied
in her promise / yet does she daily in this life more harm / For she makes
gloutons / And other she makes lecherons / she makes thieves for to slay /
And the angry cruel / and the liars falls and deceyuable / She puts discord
among wedded and married people / and debate among the peasible / By the world
comes all malice / and all felonnye /

This euylle do they / that in this life put their desires / And wene long
to live therein / And when they yt thus serve the world / have used their life in
dooyng thise evil aforsaid Then gives she to them her daughter that is the
death perpetuelle / that is the reward that the life of this world gives to her
servants / that depart from this world despourueyed / And bear nothing with
them but their sins / After this / saint sebastien turned him to their
parentis and friends and said to them in this manner / O ye my friends lo here
the life of this world which deceyueth you in such wise / that ye discounseylle
your friends fro the everlasting life / ye destrouble your children that they
should not come to the company of heuene / and to the honor permanable / and
to thamytye of the emperor celestyall / by your folyssh words / and your false
wepynges / if they should assente to your repeell / they should but a while
dwell with you / And after should depart fro your company / where ye should
see them in torments that should never end / where as cruel flam^e deuoureth
the souls of mescreants / and worshippers of ydollis / And the dragons eten
the lips of cursid men / And the serpents destroy them that been evil /
there where is herd nothing but wayllyngis / wepyngis / and horrible cries of
sowles which brenne contynuelly in the fire of hell / and ever shall brenne
without deyeng / Suffer ye / that your sons escape these torments / And
think how ye may escape / And late the^ suffer death for the love of Ihesu
christ / thenke not / but they when they shall be thus departed fro you / goon
for to make ready your place and your mansion / in heaven / where ye and your
children may be in Joy perpetuel / In this hour and time that saint sebastyan
yt was in habit of a knight clad with a mantel / and gyrd with a gyrdle of
gold and had said these words anon came a great light in the which appiered a
yonglyng clad with a white mantel among vij angellis / And gaf to saint
sebastyan the peace saying / thou shall be alleway with me / This saw the wife
of nychostratus named Zoe / in whose hows marcus and marcellianus were in prison
which had been muet and dombe vj year by a sekenes that she had / But she had
understood that / which saint sebastian had said / and had seen the light
about him / And she fill down to his feet / And by signs of her hands made
prayers to him / And after when saint Sebastyan knew that she had lost her
speech / Anon he said to her / if I be the servant of Ihesu christ and if all
that / that I have said be true / then I pray him that he will render to the
thy speech again / that opened the mouth of Zacharye the prophet / And anon
escryed this woman much hye and said / The word that thou have said is very
true / And blessed be thou / And the word of thy mouth and blessed ben all
they that by the believe in Ihesu christ the sone of god / For I have seen
certainly vij angellis to fore the holdyng a book / in which was wreton all
that / which thou have said / Blessid be all they that believe that / which
thou have said / And cursid be they that believe the not / And Nichostratus
husbonde of this woman and the fader and mother and all the friends of
marcellianus and marcus / receyueden the christian faith / And were all baptized
by policarpus the priest / unto the nombre of lxxviij persons men wymen and
children / And ten days during they abode to gydre in orysons and in prayers /
and thankyd god of his benefettes / Among them was tarquyllynus fader unto the
holy martirs aforsaid which had xj year during the gowte in his feet and
hands / And as soon as policarpus had baptized him / he bicam as hool and sound
in his feet and hondes as a child After the ten days agrestyn / and Comatyn
prouostes of Rome made Tarquillinus their fader to come to for him / And
demanded of him / how his sons were aduysed and counseylled / And he answered
much well did ye when ye gaf to them respyte / For in the mean time they that
should have deyde have found life and Joy / And the provost supposed that his
sons had been turned / And said to mo^n I shall see / how thy sons shall make
sacrefyse to thydolles / by whom thou and they may dwell in peace / And
tarquillinus said / gentyl man if thou wylt Justly adoure and work about me
and my sons / thou shall find that the name of christian men is of great virtue
/ And the prouoste said tarquillinus art thou wood / And he answered / I have been out of my wit / but as soon as I bileued in Ihesu christ / I resseyued
health of body and of soul / The prouoste said I see well / that the respyte of
thy sons have brought the in error / Tarquillinus said / know of what
werkis come error / The provost bad him say And he said / The first error is
to leave the way of life / and goo by the way of death / for to dyspute that men
which ben deed for to be gods / and to adoure their images / made of wood or
of stone / The prouoste said / then be they no gods that we adoure /
Tarquillinus said It is read in our books / what men they were that ye adoure
for gods / how evil they lived and how meschauntly they deyed / Saturnus whom
ye worship for god was lord of Crete / and ete the flessh of his children /
how is not he one of your gods / And Jupiter / his sone whom ye adoure /
which slew his fader / and took his suster to his wif what evil was this /
how art thou in great error / that adourest this cursid men / And say to the
image of stone thou art my god / And to the stock of tree / help me / The
provost said if there be none but one god invisible / that ye adoure / wherefore
then adoure ye Ihesu christ / whom the Jews crucyfyed Tarquillinus answered /
If thou know a ryng of gold / in which were a precious stone lyeng in the
mire of a valeye / thou would sent thy servants for to take up this ryng /
And if they might not left it up / thou would unclothe thy self / of thy
clothes of silk and do one a course cote and would help to take up this
ring and make great feste / The provost said wherefore have thou put forth this
proposicio^ now Tarquillinus answerde / For to show to the / that we adoure
one only god / The provost said what vnderstondest you by this ryng /
Tarquillinus said / the gold of the ring is the body humayne / And the
precious stone signefieth the soul which is enclosed in the body / The body
and the soul make a man / like as the gold and the precious stone make a ring
/ And much more precioous is the man to Ihesu christ / than the ring is to the
/ Thou sendest thy servants for to take up this ryng out of the dyrte or mire /
And they may not / Thus sent god in to this world the prophets for to draw
the humayne lygnage out of thordure of sins / and they might not do it And
like as thou sholdest leave thy rich clothis and clothe the with a course cote
/ and would descend in to the pryue and put thy hands in to foul ordure to
take up the ring / Right so the mageste of god hid the light of his dyuynyte
by a carnal vestement which he took of our nature humayne And clad him
therewith / and descends fro heaven / and came here bynethe in to the pryue of
this world / and put his hondes / in thordure of our myseryes in suffryng
hungre and thurst / And took us up out of the fylthe / and weessh us fro our
sins by the water of baptesme / And thus he which dispyseth the by cause
thou should descend in a foul habyte to take up the ryng thou myghtest well put
him to death / Thus all they that renye or despise Ih^u christ / by cause he
humbled him self for to save man / may in no wise escape for the death of hell
/ The provost said I see well that these ben but fables / Thou have take respyte
for thy sons / know thou not well that the emperor our lord is cruel against
christian men Tarquillinus said it is folly to doubt more humayne puyssaunce /
than the puyssaunce dyuyne They that been cruel against us / may well tormente
our bodies / but they may not take fro our heart Ihesu christ / Then the
provost put put tarquillinus in the hands of the sergeantis saying show to me
the medycine by which thou art helyd of thy gowte / And I shall give to the
gold without nombre / know thou that much evil shall come to them that selle
and bye the grace of god / but if thou will be hole of the maladye of the gowte
/ believe in Ihesu christ / and thou shall be as hole as I am / The prouoste said
bring him to me that has heled the / Tarquillinus went to polycarpus / and
said to him all this / And brought him with saint sebastian unto the provost
and informed him in the faith And he praid hem that he might have his health /
And saint sebastian said that he should first renye his ydollis / and give him
license to break them / and then he should have his health / Then Comasyn
the provost said that his servants should break them / saint sebastian said /
they ben aferd and dar not break them / And if the fendis hurt any of them by
any occasion the mysbyleuers would say / that they were hurt by cause they
brake their gods / And then policarpe and saint sebastian destroyed moo
than CC ydollis / Then said they to the provost / why have not thou received
the health whyl^s we brake thydollis / thou kepest yet thy mysbyleue / or ellis
kepest yet som^e ydollis / Then he showed them a chamber which was light as
had been of sterris / whereupon his fader had dyspendyd CC poys of gold / by
which he knew thyngis for to come / Then said saint sebastian / as long as
thou kepest this hole / thou may never have health / And then he agrered it
should be broken / Tyburcien his sone which was a noble young man said plainly /
that so noble a work should not be destroyed / how well I will not be again my
fadres health / this will I well that there be ordained ij furneyses of fire
brennyng / and then I will that ye destroy this work / and if my fader have
his health / I shall be content / And if he receive not his health then I will
that ye ij shall be brent in these ij furneyses of fire all quyck / And saint
sebastian said / be it / as thou have said / And forthwyth they went and
break the chamber / and in the mean while / the angele of our lord appyered to
the provost and said his health was given to him / And anon he was all hool /
and ran after him for to have kyssed his fete / but he denied him For he had
not received baptesme / And then he and Tyburcien his sone with a MCCCC of
their famylye were baptized / Then Zoe was taken of the mescreants and was
tormented so long that she gaf up the spirit And when tarquillinus herd that
/ he came forth and said / Alas why live we so long / wymen goon to fore us to
the crown of martirdom / And with in a few days after / he was stoned to
death / And Tyburcien was commanded that he should goo barefoot upon brennyng
coals / or ellis do sacrefise to thydollis / And then he made the sign of
the cross upon the coals / and went on them bare foot / And he said me
thinks I goo upon Roose flowers in the name of our lord Ihesu christ / To whom
fabien the prouoste said / It is not unknown to us that your Ihesu christ is a
techar of Sorcerye / To who^ Tyburcien said / hold thy peace thou cursid
wretch / For thou art not worthy to nempne so worthy / so holy / ne so sweet a
name / Then the provost was wroth / and commanded to smite of his heed / and
so he was martred / And then marcellianus and marcus were sore tormentid and
bound to a pyler / and as they were so bounden they seyden / loo how good and
Ioyeful it is / brethern to dwell to gydre To whom the provost said / ye
wretchis do away your madness / and delyure your self / And they said / we
were never so well fed / we would that thou would late us stand here / till
that the spirits should depart out of our bodies / And then the provost
coma^ded that they should be percid through the body with speris / And so they
fulfilled their martirdom / after this saint sebastian was accused to
the emperor that he was christian / Wherefore dyoclesian the emperor of Rome made
him come to fore him / And said to him I have alleway loved the well / and have
made the maistre / of my palace / how then have thou be christian pryuely
against my health and in despyte of our gods / Saint sebastian said / allewaye
I have worshyppid Ihesu christ for thy health / and for thestate of Rome / And I
think for to pray and demand help of thydollis of stone / is a great folly
with these words dyoclesian was much angry and wroth / and commanded him to be
ladde to the field / and there to be bounden to a stake / for to be shot at /
And the archers shot at him till he was as full of arowes as an hirchon is full
of prickis / And thus left him there for deed The night after came a christian
woman for to take his body and to burye it / but she fond him a live / and
brought him to her hows / and took charge of him till he was all hool / Many
christian men came to him which counseylled him to void the place / but he was
comforted / and stood upon a stappe where the emperor should pass by / and said
to him / the bysshoppis of thydolles deceive you evil / which accuse the
christian men to be contrayre to the common prouffyt / of the cite / that pray
for your estate / and for the health of Rome / dyoclesyan said art not thou
sebastyen / whom we commanded to be shoten to death / And saint Sebastian said /
therefore our lord has rendered to me life / to the end that I should tell you /
that euylle and cruelly ye do persecucions unto christian men / Then made
dyoclesyan him to be brought in to prison in to his palace / And to beat him so
sore with stones till that he deyde / And the tyrauntis threw his body in to a
great pryuee / by cause the christian men / should make no feste to burye his body
/ ne of his martredom / but saint sebastian appyerid after to saint lucyne a
glorious wydowe / And said to her in such a pryue shall thou find my body
hangyng at an hoke / which is not defouled with none ordure / when thou have
washed it / thou shall burye it at Cathacombes by the appostlis / And the same
night she and her servants accomplysshyd all that sebastian had commanded her
/ he was martred the year of our lord CClxxxvij / And saint gregory tells in
the first book of h^s dyaloges / that a woman of tuskane which was new wedded
was prayed for to goo with other wymen to the dedicacion of the church of
sebastian / and the night to fore she was so moeued in her flessh / that she
might not absteyne her from her husbond / And on the morn she having gretter
shame of men than of god went theder / and anon as she was entryd in to the
oratorye where the relyques of saint sebatian were / the fend took her and
tormentid here before all the people / And then the priest took the couerture
of the altar and couerd her / And then the devil assaylled the priest / her
friends lad her to thenchauntours / that that they should enchaunte the fend /
but as soon as they began thenchaunte by the Judgment of god a legion of
deuylles entryd in to her / that is vjMvjClxvj / and vexid her more sharply
than to fore / And an holy man named formatus by his prayers heled her / It is
read in the gestes of ye lo^bardis that in the time of king gylberte all
ytalye was smeton with so greet a pestilence / that uneath they that were
alive might burye the deed / And this pestylence was most at Rome and pauye /
Then the good Angele was seen vysybly of many and an evil Angele following
beryng a staf whom le bad smite and slay / And as many strokes as he smote an
hows / so many deed persons were born out of it / Then at last it was
showed to one by gods grace / that this pestylence should not cesse / till that
they had made an altar to saint sebastian at pauye / which then was made in
the church of saint peter / and anon the pestylence seassed / And thither fro
rome relyques of saint sebastian were brought / And saint Ambrose in his
preface says thus / O lord the blood of thy blessed martyr saint sebastian was
shedd for the confession of thy name / he has showed thy meruaylles / that
they prouffyte in infirmyte virtue and gives to our studyes prouffyt / and to
them not steadfast to the it gives aid and help / Then late us pray to
this holy martyr saint sebastian / that he pray unto our lord that we may be
delyuerd from all pestylence and sodeyn death / and so depart aduysedly hens
that we may come to ever lastyng Joy and glory in heaven /

Thus ends the life of saint Sebastian
And next follows of saint Agnes / and first thynterpretacion of her name
AGnes is said of agna a lamb / For she was humble and debonayr as a lamb /
or of agno in greek / which is to say debonayr / and pyteous / For she was
debonayr and mercyful / Or agnes of agnoscendo / for she knew the way of
truth / and after this saint Austyn says / truth is opposed against vanyte
/ falsenes / and doublenes / For these three thyngis were taken from her / for
the truth that she had /

Of saint Agnes
THe blessed virgyne saint Agnes was much wise and well taught as saint Ambrose
witnesses / and wrote her passion she was fair of vysage / but much fayrer in
the christian faith / she was young of age / and aged in wit / For in the xiij
year of her age / she lost the death that the world gives / And fond life in
Ihesu christ / which when she came fro scole / the sone of the perfect of Rome
for the emperor louyd her / And when his fader and mother knew it / they offered
to give much Richesse with him / if he might have her in marriage / And offryd
to saint Agnes precious ge^mes and Iewellis / which she refused to take /
whereof it happed that the young man was ardauntly esprysed in the love of saint
Agnes / and came again and took with him more precious and Rycher adournementes
/ made with all manner of precious stones / And as well by his parents as by him
self offered to saint agnes Rich yeftes / and possessions / and all the delytes
and deduytes of the world / and all to the end to have her in marriage / but
saint agnes answered to him in this matter / Goo fro me thou fardel of sin /
norysshyng of euyllys / and morsel of death / and depart / And know thou that
I am prevented / and am loved of another lover / which has given to me many
better Iewellis / which has fyanced me by his faith / And is much more noble
of lygnage than thou art / and of estate / he has clad me with precious stones
/ and with Iewellis of gold / he has set in my vysage a sign / that I
receive none other espowse but him / And has shewde me over great tresours /
which he must give me / if I abide with him / I will have none other spowse but
him / I will seche none other / In no manner may I leave him / with him am I ferme
and fastened in love / which is more noble more puyssant / and fayrer than any
other whose love is much sweet and gracious of whom the chamber is now ready for
to receive me / where the virgynes syngyn meryly / I am now embraced of him /
of whom the mother is a vyrgyne / And his fader knew never woman / to whom the
angels serve / the son and the moon merueylle them of his beauty / whose
works never faylle whose Rychesses never mynusshe / by whose odor deed men
reyse again to lif by whose touching the seek men be conforted / whose love is
chastyte / To him I have given my faith / To him I have commanded my heart /
when I love him then am I chaste / and when I touch him then am I pure and
clean / And when I take him then am I a virgyne / This is the love of my god
when the young man had herd all this he was despayred / as he that was taken in
blind love / and was over fore tormented in so much that he lay down seek in
his bed for the great sorrow that he had / Then came the fysiciens and anon
knew his maladye / and said to his fadre that he languysshid of carnal love /
that he had to som^e woman Then the fader inquired and knew that it was this
woman / And did do speak to saint agnes for his sone and said to her how his
sone languysshid for her love / saint agnes answered that in no wise she would
break the faith of her first husbond / upon that / the provost demanded who was
her first husbond of whom she so much auaunted / and in his power so much
trusted / Then one of her servants said that she was christian / and that she
was so enchaunted / that she said Ihesu christ was her espowse / And when the
prouoste herd that she was christian / the provost was much glad by cause to
have power on her / For then the christian people were in the will of the lord
/ if they would not renye their god and their believe / all their goods should be
forfayted / wherefore then the prouoste made saint agnes to come in Justice /
And he examyned her swetely / and after cruelly by menaces / Saint agnes well
comforted said to him / do what thou wylt / For my purpoos shall thou never
change / and when she saw him now flateryng and now terrybly angry / she
scorned him / And the provost said to her being all Angry / One of two thyngis
thou shall chese / either do sacrefyse to our gods with the vyrgyns of the
gods vesta / or goo to the bordell to be abandonned to all that thither come
to the great shame and blame of all thy lygnage / Saint Agnes answered / if
thou knew who is my god / thou would not say to me such words / but for
as much as I know ye virtue of my god / I set nothing by thy menaces / For I
have his angele which is kepar of my body / Then the Judge all araged made to
take of her clothys and all nakyd to be led to the bordell And thus saint
agnes that refused to do sacrefyse to thydollys / was delyueryd nakyd to goo
to the bordell / but anon as she was unclothed god gaf to her such grace that
the heeris of her heed bycam so long / that they couerd all her body to her
feet / so that her body was not seen / And when saint agnes entered in to the
bordell / anon she fond thangele of god ready for to defend her / and
enuyronned saint agnes with a bright clernes in such wise that noman myht see
her ne come to her / There made she of the bordel her oratorye And in making
her prayers to god / she saw to fore her a white vesture / And anon therewith
she clad her / and said / I thank the Ihesu christ which accomptest me with
thy virgyns and have sent me this vesture / All they that entered made honor
and reverence to the great clerenes that they saw a boute saint Agnes / And
came out more devout and more clean than they entered / At last came the sone
of the prouoste with a great company / for taccomplysshe his foul desires and
lusts And when he saw his felaws come out and issue all abashed / he mocqued
them and called them cowardis And then he all araged entryd for taccomplyssh
his evil will / and wha^ he came to the clerenes / he auaunced him for to take
the virgyne / And anon the devil took him by the throat and strangled him that
he fyl down deed / And when the prouoste herd these tidings / of his sone /
he ran weeping to the bordel / and began cryeng to say to saint agnes / O
thou cruel woman why have thou shewde thyn enchantem^t on my sone / and
demanded of her how his sone was deed and by what cause / To whom saint agnes
answered he took him in to his power / to whom he had abaundonned his will /
why ben not all they deed said he / that entered here to fore him / For his
felawes saw the miracle of the great clernes and were aferd and went their
way unhurt / For they did honor to my god which has clad me with these
vestement / and has kept my body / but your vylaynous sone / as soon as he
entered in to this hows began to braye and cry / and when he would have leyde
hand upon me / anon the devil slew him as thou see / if thou may reyse him
said he / It may well appear that thou have not put him to death / And saint
agnes answered how well that thy creance is not worthy to impetre ne get that of
our lord / nevertheless by cause it is time that the virtue of god be showed Goo
ye all out that I may make my prayer to god / And when she was in her prayers
/ thangele came and raised him to life / And anon he went out / and bygan to
cry with an hye voys / that the god of christian men was very god in heaven and
in earth / and in the Sea / And that thydolles were vain that they worshypped
/ which might not help them self ne none other / Then the bishops of
thydolles made a great discord emonge the people / so that all they cried /
Take away this sorceresse and witch that turned men's minds / and alyeneth
their wits / wha^ the prouoste saw these merueylles he would gladly have
delyuerd saint agnes / by cause she had raised his sone but he doubted to be
banysshyd / And set in his place a lyeutenau^t named aspasius / for to
satisfye the people / and by cause he could not delyuere her / he departed
soroufully / This asp^sius did do make a great fire among all the people / and
did do cast saint Agnes therein / Anon as this was done the flamme departed in
to two parties / and burnt them that made the discordes / and she abode all
hole without felyng the fire / The people went that she had don all by
enchauntement / Then made saint agnes her oryson to god thankyng him that she
was escaped fro the paryll to lose her virgynyte / and also fro the brennyng of
the flamme / And when she had made her oryson / the fire lost all his hete /
and quenchyd it aspasius for the doubtance of the people commanded to put a swerd
in her body / And so she was martred / Anon came the christian men and the
parentis of saint Agnes and buried her body / but the hethen defended it / and
cast so stones at them / that uneath they escaped / She suffered martirdom in
the time of constantyn the great / which began to regne the year of our lord
CCCix / Among them that buried her body there was one Emerenciana which had be
felaw to saint Agnes / how be it she was not yet cristened / but an holy
virgyne / she came also to the sepulces of saint agnes / which consta^tly
repreued the gentyles / and of the^ she was stoned to death / and slain / Anon
then came a earth quaue / lightnyng / and thondre / that many of the paynems
perisshed / so that for^hon the christian people might surely come to the sepulcre
unhurt / And the body of Emerencian was buried by the body of saint Agnes / It
happed that wha^ the friends of saint Agnes watched at her sepulcre on a night
/ they saw come a great multitude of virgynes clad in vestymentes of gold and
silver / and a great light shone to fore them / And on the right side / was a
lamb more white than snow / and saw also saint Agnes among the virgynes /
which said to her parents / Take heed / and see that ye bewaylle me no more as
deed / but be ye Ioyeful with me / For with all thise virgynes Ihesu christ have
give me most ^^yghtyst habytacion and dwelling / And am with him Joined in
heaven / who^ in earth I loved with my thouht / And this was the viij day after
her passyo^ And by cause of this vysion / holy church makes memoyre of her /
the viij day of the feste after / which is called Agnetis secundo / Of her we
read an example / that in the church of saint agnes was a priest which was
named paulus / and allewaye served in that church / and had right great
temptacion of his flesh / but by cauhe doubted to anger our lord / he kept
him fro sin / And prayed to the pope that he would give him leave for to marye /
The pope considered his symplenesse and for his bou^te he gaf him a ring in
which was an emerawde / and c^manded that he should goo to thymage of saint
Agnes / which was in his church / and pray her that she would be his wife /
This simple man did so / And thymage put forth her fyngre / And he set the
ring thereon / And then she drew her fyngre again and kept the ryng fast /
And then anon all his tempptacion carnal was quenchyd and take away from him
/ And yet as it is said the ring is on the fyngre of thymage /

Constaunce the daughter of Constantyn was smeton with a sore and foul lepre /
when she had herd of the vysion of saint agnes at her tomb showed to her
friends / she came to the sepulcre of saint agnes / And when she was in her
prayers she fill a sleep / And she saw in her sleep saint agnes saying to her
Constaunce work constantly / And if thou wylt believe in christ / you shall anon
be delyuerd of thy sekenes / wherwyth she awoke / and fond her self perfyghtly
hool / and anon she receyuyd baptesme and founded a church upon the body of
the virgyne / And there abode in her virgynyte / and assembled there many
virgynes by cause of her good ensample / In an other place it is read that
when the church of saint agnes was void / the pope said to a priest / that he
would give to him a wife for to norysshe and keep / and he mente to co^myse the
church of saint agnes to his cure / And he delyueryd to him a ring and bad
him to wedde thymage / And thymage put forth her fyngre / and he set on it
the ryng / and anon she closid the finger to her hand and kept the ring / and
so espoused her / Of this vyrgyne says saint Ambrose in the book of vyrgynes /
This vyrgyne / young men / old men / and children preyse / There is none more to
be praised / than that may be praised of all / Saint Ambrose says in his
preface that this blessed saint Agnes despised the delytes of noblesse / and
deserved heavenly dygnyte / she left the desires of man's felawshyp / and she
fond the felawshyp of the everlasting king / And she receyuyng a precious
death for the confession of Ihesu christ / is made conformable to him /
euerlastyngly to regne in Joy in heaven / to the which he bring us / for whose
glorious name and faith / this glorious vyrgyne saint Agnes suffered martirdom
of death /

Thus ends the life of saint Agnes
Here begins thynterpretacion of the name of saint vyncent
Vyncent is as much to say as brennyng vices or ouercomyng brennynges / and
keeping victory / For he burnt and destroyed vices by mortificacion of his
flessh / he vaynquysshid the brennyngis of tormentis by steadfast suffraunce /
he held the victory of the world by despysyng of the same / he vaynquysshyd
three things in the world / that is to wete false errors / foul loves and
wordly dredes / which things he ouercam / by wysedom / by clennesse / and by
constaunce / Of whom saint Austyn says that the martirdoms of saints have
enseygned / that the world is overcome with all errors / loves / and dredes /
And som^e afferme that saint Austyn wrote and compyled his passion / which
prudencien set right clerly in versis /

Of the life of saint vyncent
Vyncente was noble of lygnage / but he was more noble by faith and relygion /
And was deken to saint valeryen bishop / he was in his chyldhode set to
study / where by dyuyne prouydence he floured in double science / most
parfoundly / that is to say in dyuynyte and humanyte / To whom saint valerien
by cause he was empesshyd in his tongue comysed to him the fayttes and works
of charge And him self intended to prayer and contemplacion / And by the
commandment of dacian the provost vyncent and valeryen were drawn to valence /
and there cast in prison / And when the provost had supposed they had been
almost perysshyd for hungre and pain / he commanded them to come to fore him /
And when he saw them hool and Ioyeful / he being wroth began to cry much /
strongly and said / what say thou valeryen which under the name of thy
relygyon do against the decrees of princes / And as the blessed valeryen
answered lightly / Saint vyncente said to him / worshypful fader answer not him
so with a tymerous heart / but put out thy voys and escrye him freely / And
fader if thou wylt comande me / I shall goo answer to the Judge / To whom
valerian said right dear sone it is long since I have co^mysed to the / the
charge of spekyng And now it byhoueth the to answer for the faith / for which
we ben here / Then saint vyncent turned to the Judge and said to dacyan / Thou
have holden unto now / words to renye our faith / but know thou that it is
great felonnye to the wisdom of christian men to blame and renye our christian
faith / Then dacyan being wroth coma^ded that the bishop should be put in
exile / And vyncente as a man presumptuous and despytons should be put to be
tormented in the place named eculeo / And it was made like a cross twhart of
which the two ends were fyxed in therthe / And that his members should thereon
be broken for to fere the other / And when he was all thus to broken / dacian
said to him / say vyncente now see thou thy body unhappy / And vyncent
smylyng said to him / This is that I all way have desired / Then the prouoste
being wroth began to say and menace him with many turm^tis / And vyncent said
to him / O unhappy man how wenest thou to anger me / the more grievously that
thou tormentest me / so much more pity shall god have on me / Arise up thou
unhappy / man and cursid / and by thy wicked spyrite you shall be vaynquysshyd /
For thou shall me find more strenger by the virtue of god to suffer thy
tormentis / than thou have power to tormente me / Then the prouoste was angry
/ and began to cry / And the bochers took scorgis and rods and began to
smite and beat him with rods of iron / And saint vyncent said / what say
thou dacyen / thou thy self auengest me of my torments / Then the provost
was wood and said to the bochers / ye wretches what do ye why faylle and wexe
faint your hondes / ye have ouercomen murdrers and aduoultrers / so that they
could hyde nothing among your torments / and this vyncent only shall mow
surmou^t your torments / Then the bochyers took combs of iron / and began
to kembe him on the sides within the flesh / that the blood ran down over all
his body / And that thentrayllis and guts appiered by the Ioyntures of his
sides / And dacyen said to him / vyncent have pity on thy self / in such wise
that you may recover thy fair yongthe and win to spare the torments / that been yet to come / And vyncente said to him / O venymous tongue of the devil /
I doubt nothing thy torments / but I fere sore only / that thou wylt feign to
have mercy on me / For so much more as I see the angry / so much more am I
reioysed / I will tha^ thou in no wise / mynusshe ne less thy torments / so
that thou know that thou be vaynquysshed in all things / Then was he take
out of the tormente / and was brought unto a torment of fire / and he blamed
and repreued the bochyers of their long taryeng / Then with his good will /
he mounted upon the gredyron and there was roasted broylled and burnt in all his
members / and was styked with smal^ nails of iron / and pryckyd with brennyng
poyntels of iron / And when the blood ran in to the fire / and made wounds
upon wounds / then they cast salt in to the fire / that it should sparkle
and spryng in the wou^des of his body / on all parts of the wounds / that it
should more cruelle brenne and do him more pain on his body / by the flammes /
in such wise that the pryckys of yren might not hold on his members / but on
his entraylles which henge out of his body / so that he might not meue him /
And for all this he was vnm^uable / but he prayed our lord Ihesu christ with
Joined hondes up to heaven / And wha^ the mynystres had said this to dacien he
said / Alas we ben all vaynquysshyd / and he lives yet / And by cause he may
yet live longer / shet ye him in a much derke prison / And gadre to gydre all
the sharp shellis / and prycke them in his feet / And late him be stratched on
the^ without any humayn comfort / And when he shall be deed come and tell me /
And thyes right cruel mynystres obeyed him as to their lord right cruel / but
the king for who^ he suffered the pain so inhumayne / changed to him all this
in to ^oye / For the derknesses were all chaced away out of the prison / by
great light And the sharpnes of the shelles were turned in to softnes and
swetenes of all manner flowers / his feet were unbound / and he used the
conforte of thonour of Angellis / And like as he had goon on the flowers
syngyng with angellis / The sweet soun of the song and the swetnes and odor
of the flowers which was merueyllous was smelled out of the prison / And when
the kepers had seen through the creuaces of the prison / this that they saw
within / they were converted / and turned to the faith / And when dacyan herd
this / he was wood and said / what shall we do to him more / we ben ouercomen /
Now then late him be born in to a right soft bed with soft clothes / so
that he be not made more glorious / and to the end that he dye not yet / but
that he be made strong again / and be kembid again / in new tormentis And when
he was brought in a soft bed / and had therein rested a while he rendered and
gaf up his speryte unto god in the year of our lord CC lxxxviij / under
dyoclesian and maximyen Emperors / And when dacian herd say that he was deed
/ he was much sorouful / And said that in that wise he was also vaynquysshyd /
but since I might not overcome him living / I shall punysshe him deed / And if I
may not have victory / I shall be fowled of the pain / Then the body of
saint vyncent was cast in a field for to be devoured of the bestes and fowls
/ by the commandment of dacian / but it was kept with angellis / fro towchyng
of any beeste / And after came a raven which droof away all other birds and
fowls / gretter than he was / and chaced away also a wulf with his bylle and
beck / and then turned his heed toward the body / as he that meruaylled of
the keeping of thaungellis / And when dacyen herd this thing / I trow said he
that I may not surmounte him when he is deed / Then commanded he that he should
be cast in to the sea with a myllne stone bounden to his neck / to the end
that he that might not be destroyed upon therthe of bestes / should be devoured
in the sea of belues and great fysshes / Then the maronners that ladde the
body in to the sea / cast it therein / but the body was sonner arrived a land
/ than the maronners were / And was founden of a lady and of som^e other by the
reuelacion of Ihesu christ / And was honorably buried of them / And saint
Austyn says of this holy blessed martyr saint vyncent that he vaynquysshid so
in words / he vaynquysshed in pains / he vaynquysshed in confession / he
vaynquysshyd in tribulacion / he ouercam the fire / he ouercam the water / he
vaynquysshyd death / and vaynquysshyd life / This vyncent was tormented for to
dwell with god / he was scorgyd for to be introduced / he was beten for to be
enstrengthed / he burnt to be purged / he was gladder of the dredde of god
than of the world he had lever plese god than the world And had lever deye to
the world tha^ to god / Also saint Austyn says in another place that a
merueyllous thing is set to fore our eyes / that is a wicked Judge a cruel
tormentor / and a martyr not ouercomen / And prudencien wrote of cruelte and
pity / saying that vyncent said to dacien / the torm^tes of the prison / the
naylles / the vngles / the streynynge combs of iron with the fla^mes of fire /
and death which is last end of the pains / all thise ben plays and Iapes to
christian men / Then dacian said as ouercomen / bind him and draw his arms
out of their Joints / And break ye all the bones in such wise that all the
members be departed / to the end that the breath of him spring out by the holis
of his members so torn / And the knight of god lawhed at these thyngis / and
blamed the blody hands / by cause they put not the hokes and naylles depper in
his members / And when he was in the prison / the Angele of god said to him /
Arise up noble martyr surely / arise up / For thou shall be our felawe / and be
acco^panyed with saints O knight inuyncible / strengest of all strong / now
thise aspre torm^tes and cruel doubt ye now a vaynquer / and prudencien says
/ you art only noble of the world / you berest only the victory of double
battle thou have deserved ij crowns to gydre / Pray we then to him that he
Impetre grace of our lord Ihesu Christ / that we may deserve to come unto his
bliss and Joy in heaven where he regneth /

Amen
Here ends the life and passion of saint vyncent
Here follows the life of saint Basylle bishop / and first of the
interpretacion of his name
BAsille is said of basis in greek / which is as much to say as a fou^dement
/ and leos / that is people / For he was fou^dement of them that would go to
their maker / or ellis it is said of basilisco a serpente / For he ouercam the
serpent^ enemy of mankind /

Of the life of saint Basille
Saint Basille was a venerable bishop / and a solemn doctor of whom
Amphilonus bishop of ycome wrote the life / And it was shewde in a vision to an
hermyte named effraym how much holy he was / On a time as the said eff^aim was
in a traunse / he saw a pyler of fire / whose head areched heuens / and a voys
there upon saying / Such is basille / like unto this pyber that thou see /
And after this / the hermyte ca^ to the cite for to see at the day of
epiphanye so noble a man / and when he saw him he was / clad with a white
vesture going honorably with the clergy / then thermyte said to him self /
I see well / that I have labored in vayn and for naught / he that is set in
such honor / may not be such as I have seen / we that have born the burden
and labor of ye hete of the day in great pain / we had never such thing /
and he here which is set in such honor / and also thus aco^panyed is a
colompne of fire / Now I have great merueylle what this may be / And saint
basylle that saw this in spirit / made him to be brought to him And when he
was comen / he saw a tongue of fire / spekyng in his mouth Then said effraim
/ Truly basille is great / truly basille is the pyler of fire / And verily the
holy ghoost speaks in his mouth / And Effraim said to saint basille / Sire I
pray the / that thou Impetre of god that I may speak greek / to whom saint
basille said / thou have demanded an hard thing / Nevertheless he prayed for
him / and he spack greek Another hermyte saw saint basille / how he went in
thabyte of a bishop / and demed evil in his thought / how he delyted in this
estate in vayn glory / And anon there came a voys that said to him / thou
delytest the more in playng and handlyng thy catte / than basille does in all
his array / and ^^urnementis / Malens the emperor which sustained tharryens
heretics took away a church fro the christian men / and gaf it to the Arryens /
to whom saint basylle said / O thou Emperor it is wreton / honor regis
Iudicium diligit / Thonour of the king requires true Judgment / And the dome
of a king is Iustyse / And wherefore then have thou commanded that the
catholyque christian men ben put out of holy church / And the emperor said to him
/ yet retornest thou to say vylonye to me / It apperteyneth not to the / To
whom saint basille said / It apperteyneth well to me / and also do deye for
Justice / Then demostenes provost of the metes of the emperor vpholder of
tharryens spack for them and made an answer corru^ped in langage / for to make
satisfaction / And saint basille said to him / it apperteyneth to the to
ordeyne for the metes of the emperor / and not to inquire of the techynges
dyuyne / the which as confused held him stylle and said not / And the emperor
said to saint basille / Now goo thou forth / and Judge thou between them / and
not for favor ne over great love that thou have to that one party / ne for
hate that thou have to that other /

Then saint basille went to them / and said to fore tharryens and to the
catholyques / yt the doors of the church should be shette fast / and sealid
with the sealis of either party / And that every should pray to god for his
right / and that the church should be delyueryd to the^ / at whose prayer it
should opene / And thus they accorded / The arryens put them to prayer iij days
and three nyghtes / And when they ca^ to the doors / they opened not / Then
saint basille ordained a procession / and came to the church / and knocked a
stroke / with his croche / saying / Attollite portas principes vestras and
cetera / and anon as he had said the verse / the doors opened / and they
entryd in / and gaf lawde and preysynd to god / and so was their church
rendryd to them again / And after the emperor did promise to saint basylle
much good and honor if he would consent to him / And saint basille said that
was a demand to make to children / For they that be fulfilled with dyuyne
words will not suffer / that one only syllable of the dyuyne science / be
corrupt / Then the emperor had great Indygnacion of him / and took a pen
for to write the sentence on him / that he should be exyled / And the first
pen brake / and ye second / and also the third / And his hand began to
tremble for fere / then in great Indygnacion / he all to rent the cedule /
There was an honest worshypful man named heradius / which had but one daughter
/ whom he dysposed to consacre to god / but the fend enemy to mankind /
enflamed and made one of the servants of ye same to bre^ne in the love of
this maid / And when he remembered that he was but a servant / him thought not
possible that ever he should atteyne to come to his desire / of so noble a
virgyne / he went to an enchaaunteur / to whom he promised great quantyte of
money / if he would help him / to whom the^chantour answered that he could not
do it / but I shall send the to the devil which is my master and lord / And
if thou do that he shall say to the / thou shall have thy desire / And the
young man said he would so do / And this enchanteur sent a lettre by him to the
devil / thus conteynyng My lord and master / by cause that I must hastly and
besily draw all them yt I may fro the religion of crystendom / and bring
them to thy will / to the end that thy party alleway grow and multeplye / I
send to the this young man esprysed in the love of the maid / And demands
that his desires may be accomplysshyd / that herin I have glory and honor /
And that fro now forthon I may gadre to the and draw moo / Then he gaf him
his lettre / and had him goo / and at mydnynght stand upon the to^be of a
paynem / and call the devil / And hold up this lettre in thayer / And anon he
shall come to the / And he anon went forth and did as he was boden and held
the lettre in thayer / And forth with came the prince of derknes felawshipped
with a great multitude of fendes / and when he had read the cedule / he said
to the young man / wylt thou believe in me / if I accomplyssh thy desire / And he
answered that he would so do / Then the devil said to him renye then Ihesu
christ / which said / I renye him / And the devil said to him ye christian men
ye be all falls and untrue / For when ye have to do / ye come to me / And
when ye have that ye demand / anon after ye renye me / and return to your
Ihesu christ / And he receives you / by cause he is right debo^nayr / but if
thou wylt that I do thy will / Make a land of thyn own hand writing and
delyuere it to me / and let it conteyne / that thou have forsaken Ihesu christ
/ thy baptesme / and the profession of christian relygion / and that thou be my
servant / and with me at Judgment to be dampened / and anon all this he wrote
/ and took it to ye devil / and put him in his seruytude / and anon ye devil
took with him fe^des that served for fornycacion / and coma^ded them that they
should goo and enfla^me the heart of that maid in the love of that young man /
The which came to her / and so enfla^med her in the love of ye man / that she
fill down to the ground to fore her fader cryeng piteously / and saying /
Fader have pity on me / For cruelly I am tormented for the love of your
servant / have mercy on me /

And show to me your faderly love that ye owe to me / that ye give to me in
marriage the young man that I desire And if ye do not / ye shall see anon that I
shall deye / And thereof shall ye answer at day of dome / and the fader weeping
said / Alas wretchyd that I am / what is to me befallen / God have mercy on my
daughter / yt thus takes away my tresour / and quenchyth the light of mine eyes
/ I would have given the to the spowse of heuene / and wend to have saved the /
And thou art desmesured in worldly love and flesshly / Abide daughter and tarry
/ that I may marye the to him that I had purposed / and bring not me my last
days in sorrow / And she cried and said / fader do as I have said / or anon
thou shall see me deed / and so as she wept bytterly as out of her wit / the
fader in great desolacion / of heart / meuyd by the cou^seyl of his friends /
and deceived / did her playsir / and married her to the young man / and gaf to
her all his substance saying / Goo forth my daughter very kaytyf that thou art
/ and forth she went and took him to her husbond / and they dwellid to gydre /
The husbond went not to church / ne be blessid him not / ne recomended him
not to god whereof many of the neighbors noted it and said to the wife / This
young man that thou have taken is not cristend / ne he goth not to the church /
And wha^ she herd that she was much abashed / and for sorrow fill down to the
ground / and with her naylles began to cratche her face and beat her breast and
said / Alas most miserable wretch that I am / whereto was I born / I would I had
perisshyd in my birth / And then she told her husbond what she had herd of
him / And he answered that it was nothing so / then said she / if thou wylt
that I believe the / thou and I shall to morn goo to church / and then shall I
know if it be true that thou say / Then he yielded him confused / and saw
well yt he might not deny / but it was so / And told to her all that he had don
And when she had herd all the caas how he had done / she began to waylle and
to weep strongly / And forthwyth went to saint basylle / and reherced to him
all that she had herd of her husbond / And saint basylle sent for the husbond
and said to him / my sone wylt thou reborne again to god / Sire said he / ye
but I may not For I have bound my self to the devil and renyed Ihesu christ /
and thereof I have made a writing of my hand and delyuerd it to him / And saint
basylle said to him / thereof no force / Our lord is debonayr and mercyful / and
shall receive the if thou repentest the / And ano^ took the young man and made
the sign of the cross on his forhede / And shytte him in a chamber three days
/ After he went to see him / and demanded saying my sone how is it with the /
and he answered / Sire I am in great pain and in great anguyssh in such wise
that I may not bear the clamours / the terrors / and the lapydementis that the
fendes don to me / For they hold in their hand my writing / in accusyng me
and saying / I came to them / and not they to me / Then said basylle / my sone
be not aferd / but put fermely thy believe in Ihesu christ / and saint basylle
gaf to him a lytyl mete / for to comfort him / and marked him with the sign
of the cross / And closyd him again / and he went and prayed for him / After
certain days passed he went and vysited him again / and asked how it was with
him / And he answered much better than to fore / I here their clamours / and
their menaces / but I see them not / Saint basylle gaf him mete / and closyd
the door and blessed him / and went and prayed god for him / and xl days after
he returned and said to him / my sone how is it with the / he answered holy
fader it is well with me this day / for I have seen the fight for me and
ouercomen the devil / Then he took him out / and called all the clergy /
the relygyouses / and the people / and warned them that they should pray all
fore him / and and led the young man by the hand to the church / And anon
the devil with a great multitude of fendes without sceyng of any man took the
young man and payned them to take him out of the hand of saint basylle / And
the young man bygan to cry / holy saint of god help me And the fendes enforced
them so greatly that they made saint basylle to meue in holdyng the young man /
saint basylle said / thou cursed and cruel fend / suffyseth not to the enough
thy perdicion propre / but thou must te^pte the creatures of my god for to have
them lost / The devil then said heryng many / O basyll thou greuest and
ennoyest me much / then all the people cried kyryeleyson / And saint basylle
said to ye devil / Our lord god blame and repreue the cursyd fend / And the
devil said to him / basylle thou greuest and anoyest me much / I went not to
him / but he came to me / he has renyed his god / and has confessid me to be
his lord / lo here in my hond the writing that he gaf to me / and saint basylle
said to him we shall not cesse to pr^ye for him unto the time that thou shall
deliver his writing / And thus as saint basylle prayed holdyng the hand of the
young man / the cedule which he had made was brought in thayer in the sight of
all / and was leyde in the hand of saint basylle / the which received it /
and said to the child / brother know thou ^hyse lettres / and he answered
them I know the^ well / For they were wreton with my hand / Then saint
basylle brake them / and ladde the child to the church / and so or deyned and
disposed him yt he was worthy to receive the holy sacrament / and after he
being enseygned and taught delyuerd to him a Rewle how he should keep him / and
delyuerd him to his wife / Also there was a woman that had co^mysed many sins /
the which she all wrote / And at end there was one more grievous than the
other / which in the writing delyuerd to saint basylle / prayeng him to pray
for her / And that by his prayers her sins might be foryeuen / and then he
prayde for her and the woman opend the bylle / wherein she found all the sins
deffaced and put out exept the grievous sin / And she came to saint basylle and
said / thou holy saint of god have mercy on me / and get me foryefnes for this
like as you have don for the other / And saint basylle said to the woman / leave
and goo fro me woman / For I am a man synnar as thou art which have need of
pardon as much as thou / And as she that was besy and grievous to him he said
to her goo unto the holy man that is named effraym / and demand of him that
he may get pardon for the / And when she came to the holy man Effraym / and had
told to him wherefore she was sent to him fro saint basylle / he said to her /
goo fro me for I am a synful man / but goo again to saint basylle / And it is
he that may get the foryefnes for this sin / like as he did for the other
And haste the to the^de / that thou may find him alive / And when she came in
to the cite / saint basylle was born to the church for to be buried / And she
bygan to cry saying / god ^e Judge between me and the / For thou may well
appease god for me / And thou have sent me to an other / and anon she threw
the bylle upon the coueryng of the byere / And anon after she took it again and
opend it and found hit all plain and out clean of the bylle / And then with
other she gaf thankynges to god To fore or saint basylle deyde / he being in
the maladye that he deyde / he did do come a Jew to him which was much
expert in physyke / And he louyd him by cause he saw that he should be
converted to the faith / And when he was come he felt his pulls / and saw that
he was nyghe his end / and said to his meyney / Make ye ready such thing as
byhoueth for his sepulture / For he shall deye anon / which word saint basylle
herd / and said to him / thou woste not what thou say / And the Jew named
Joseph said to him / this day shall thou dye when the son shall goo down in
the weste / To whom saint basylle said / what shall thou say if I deye not t^ys
day to whom Joseph said / Sire it is not other wise possible / then said
saint basylle if I live unto the morrow none what shall thou do / And Joseph
said if thou live until the morrow that hour / I shall deye / And saint basylle
said thou say truth / thou shall dye / that is sin shall dye in the to
the^de that you live in Ih^u criste / and Joseph said / I wot well what you say
and if thou live unto that time I shall do that thou say / Then saint
basille said how well that by nature he should have deyde anon forthwith / yet he
gate and Impetred of god space that he should not then deye / and lived unto
the morn at none / which thing seeing Joseph merueylled much and byleued in
Ihesu crist / Saint basille then took heart and ouercam the feebleness of the
body / and aroos out of his bed / and went to ye church / and with his
propre hands baptized the Jew / And after returned to his bed / and anon
gaf up his spirit and rendryd his soul unto god / about the year of our lord
iijClxx / Then lat^ us pray to him that he get us grace of our lord Ihesu
christ / that he will foryeue us all our sins /

Thus ends the life of saint Basille
Here follows the life of saint Johan the Almosner
Saint Johan the Almosner was patriack of Ih^rlm / he saw on a time in a
vision a much fair maid which had on her head a crown of olyue / and wha^ he
saw her he was greatly abasshid and demanded her what she was this maid
answer to him / I am mercy which brought fro heaven the sone of god if thou will wedde me you shall fare the better / Then he understanding yt tholyue
bit^keneth mercy / he began that same day to be mercyful in such wise that he
was called almosner / or amener / and he called alleway the pour people his
lords Then he called his servants and said to the^ goo through the cite and
write ye all ye names of my lords / and when he saw that they understood not
his words / he said to them / they ben they that ye call pour and
me^diau^tes / I call the^ my lords / and I say they be my helpers / and
trust it well yt they mow help and get me the kingdom of heuene / And by
cause he would styre the people to do alms he said that when the pour men
were ones to gydre wermyng the^ against the son / they began to tell who were
good almesmen / and the^ would they ^reyse / and blame them that werr evil /
among all other he told this narracion /

There was sometime a tollar named peter / in a cite / and was a much rich man
but he was not pyteous / but cruel to pour people / For he would hunte and chase
away pour people and beggars from his house with indignacion and anger / Thus
would no pour man come to him for alms / Then was there j pour man said
to his felaws what will ye give me if I get of him an alms this day / And
they made a wager with him that he should not / which don he went to this
tollars house / and stood at the yate and demanded alms / And when this rich
man came / and saw this pour man at his yate / he was much angry / and would
have cast somewhat at his heed but he could find nothing / till at last came
one of his servants beryng a basket full of bread of Rye / and in a great anger
he took a rye loof and threw it at his head / as he that might not here the
cry of the pour man / and he took up the loof and ran to his felaws / and
said truly that he had received / that loof of petres own hand / And then
within ij days after this rich man was seek and like for to deye / And as he
lay he was rauysshed in spirit / in which he saw that he was set in
Judgment / and black men bryngyng forth his wicked deeds / and leyde them in a
balau^ce on that one side / And on that other side / he saw som^e clothed in
white morning and sorouful / but they had nothing to leye against them in that
other balance / And one of them said / truly we have nothing ^ut a Rye loof
which he gaf to god against his will but two days goon / And then they put
that loof in to that balaunce And him seemed the balances were like even /
Then they said to him / Encrece and multiplye this Rye loof / or ellis thou
must be deueryd to these blac moors or fendes / And when he awoke / he said
alas / if a Rey loof have so much auaylled me / which / yaf in despite / how
much should it have auaylled me / if I had given all my goods to pour men
with a good will / As this rich man went on a day clothed with his best
clothis / a pour shipma^ came to him all naked and demanded of him som^e
clothyng / for ye love of god to couere him with all / and he anon dispoylled
him self and gaf to him his rich clothyng that he ware / and anon the pour
man sold it / and when he knew that the pour man had sold it / he was so
sorry / that he would ete no mete / but he said Alas I am not worthy that the
pour man thynk upon me / and the night following wha^ he slepte / he saw one
brighter than ye son having a cross on his head weryng the same cloth that
he had given to the pour man / and he said to him why wepest you tol^nar / And
wha^ he had told him the cause of his sorrow / he said to him / know thou
this cloth / And he said / ye sire / and then our lord said / I have been
clothed therewith / since thou gauyst it to me / And I thank the of thy good will
that you had pite of my nakidnesse / For wha^ I was a cold / thou couerdest
me / And when he awoke he blessid the pour people and said / by the living god
if I live / I will be one of his pour me^ / And when he had given all his good
to pour men / he called one of his secret men who^ he trusted well / and said
to him I have a secret cou^seyl to tell the / and if you keep it not secret /
and do as I bydde the I shall selle the to the hethen men / And he took him x
pound in gold and had him goo in to the holy cite and bye som^e mercerye ware /
And wha^ thou have so don / take me and selle me to som^e christian man and take
that money that thou shall resscyue for me / and give it to pour people And the
servant refused it / and he said truly if thou selle me not / I shall selle ye
to the barbaris / And then he took this peter the tollenar as he had commanded
him / which was his master clad in vile clothyng and led him to ye market
and sold him to an Argenter for xxx besau^tes / which he took and delte it
among pour men / This peter then thus sold was bound / and put in to a
kychen for to do all foul works in such wise that he was despised of every
man of the servants / And som^e often smote him and knocked him about the head
/ and called him fool / Criste appiered often to him / and showed him his
clothyng and the besauntes and comforted him / And the emperor and other people
were sorry for the loss of peter the tollenar / And it happed that noble me^ of
Constantynoble came unto the place where as peter was for to visit holy places
whom the master of peter had to dinner / And as they satte and ete at their
dinner / peter served and passed by the^ and they beholding him said to each
other in their erres how like is this yongman to peter the tollenar / and as
they well saw and aduysed him / they said verily / it is my lord peter / I shall
arise and hold him / And when pieres understood that / he fled away pryuely
/ There was a porter / which was both deef and dombe / And by signs he opened
the yates / And peter bad him by words to opene the yate / And he anon herd
him and receyuyng speech answered him / And peter went his way / And the
porter returned in to the hows spekyng and heeryng / whereof all they
meruaylled to whom he said he that was in the kychen is goon out and flees
away / but know ye for certain that he is the servant of god / For as he spack
and bad me opene the yate / there issued out of his mouth a flamme of fire
which touchid my tongue and mine eeres / and anon I received heeryng and
spekyng / And anon they all went out and ran after him / but they might
not find him / Then all they of the hows repented them and did pen^unce /
by cause they had so foul entreated him / There was a monk named vytale which
would assaye if he might reyse any sklaundre against saint Ioh^n / And saint
Ioh^n came in to a cite and went unto all the bordelles of common wymen / And
said to each of them by order give me this night / and do no fornycacion /
Then he entered in to the house of one / and was in a corner all the night on
his knees in prayer and prayed for her / And on the morn he went and commanded
to each of the^ that they should tell it to noma^ / yet one of them manyfested
his life And anon as saint Ioh^n had prayed she began to be tormented with a
devil And anon the other wymen said to her / god has given to the / that /
that thou have deserved / by cause she entered for to do fornycacion / and not
for none other cause / And when it was even the forsaid monk vytale said to
fore them all / I will goo theder / For that woman abides me / then many
blamed him / And he answered and said / am I not a man as another is I have a
body as other men have / Is god only wroth with monkis / they be men as other
be / Then som^e of them said to him / Take to the a wife and change thyn
habit / so that thou sklau^dre not other / he faynyng him self wroth said /
verily I shall not here you who that will be sklaundrd / late him be sklau^dred
and late him smite his forhede against the wall / be ye ordained to be my Iuges
of god / Goo ye and take heed of your self / For ye shall give none acomptes for
me / And this he said with a loud voys / And then ne they complained to saint
Ioh^n of his governance / Our lord harded so the heart that he gaf no credence
to his words / but prayed god that he would show his works to som^e creature
after his death / And that it should not torn him to sin that defamed him /
by this mean he brought many for to be converted / And set of them many for
to be closed in religyon / In a morenyng as he went fro them / one of thyes
common wymen met with a man that entered in for to do fornycacion / whom he gaf
a buffette and said thou wicked man why amendest thou not thy wicked living /
and he said to him / believe me right well that thou shall have such a buffet /
that all alysau^dre shall assemble to wondre on the / And after that the fend
came in lyknes of a man / and yaf him a buffete and said to him / this is the
buffet that thabbot vytale promised the / and anon he was rauysshyd with the
fend and tormented / so that all the people drew to him and wondered on him /
but at last he was repentaunt / And was heled by the prayers of saint vytale
/ And when the servant of god was nygh his end / he left in writing to his
dyscyples / Judge ye never before the time / And when he was deeed the wymen
confessyd what he had don / And all they gloryfyed god / And namely saint Ioh^n
saying / would god that thy^ke buffet that he took / I had taken / There was a
pour man in thabyte of a pilgrim came to saint Ioh^n and demanded alms /
And he called his dyspenser and bad him to give to that pour man vj pens /
which he received and went his way / and changed his clothyng / and came
again to the patriarch and asked alms / And he called his dyspenser / and
bad him to give him vj pens of gold / And when he had given to him and was
departed / the dyspenser said to his lord Fader at your request / this man has
received twyes alms this day / and has changed his habyte twies / saint
Ioh^n feigned as he had not herd it / And the pour man changed his clothyng
the third time / and came again to saint Ioh^n and asked yet the third time
alms / And then the dyspenser told his lord pryuely that he was the same
beggar / to whom saint Ioh^n said / give to him xij besau^tes / lest it be my
lord Ihesu christ that will preue me whether he myht more take / or I give / On
a time it happed that one patricius had certain money of the church which he
would put in marchaundyse / but the patriarch would in no wise consent thereto /
but would it should be given to pour people / And they could not acorde / but
departed all wroth / And after euensong time the patryarke sent to
tharchepreste patricius saying Sir the son is nygh goo^ down / And he heryng
that / anon he wept and came to him and asked for yeuenes / On a time the neuew
of the patryarke suffered wrong of a tauerner / And complained lamentably to
the patriarch and could not be comforted / And the patriarch said to him / who
is so hardy that dar say against the / or opene his mouth against the / Believe
me sone that I shall this day do for the such a thing that all Alisaundre shall
wondre on it / And And when he herd that / he was well conforted wenyng that
the tauerner should have been sore beten / And saint Ioh^n seeing tha^ he was
comforted / kyssed his breast and said / Sone if thou be verily the neuew of
mine humylyte / make the ready to be scorgid and to suffer of every man betyngis
/ chydyngis and wrongs / For very affynyte is not only of flesh and blood
but it is know by the strength of virtue / And anon he sent for that man
and made him free of all pension and tribute / And all they that herd this
wondered greatly / And then understood they that he had said before / that he
would so do that all alysau^dre should wondre thereof / The patriarch herynge of
the custom that is when the emperor is crowned / there shall come to him the
makers of sepultures and bring stones of marble of diverse colors / and
demand the emperor of what stones he will have his grave made or of what metalle
/ Saint Ioh^n remembryng this commanded to make his sepulture but yet he did
not do make it all / but left it vnparfyght unto his end / And he ordained
that at every feste when he was with the clergy / som^e should come to him and
say / Sire thy monument or sepulture is not all made but Imperfyght / comande
that it may be made / For thou wotest not what hour thou shall dye / ne when
the thief comes / There was a rich man which saw saint Ioh^n having in his
^edde but vile clothes and not rich / For he had given all his good to pour
men / he bought for him a much rich couertour for his bed / and yaue it to
saint Ioh^n / And in a night as it lay upon him he could not sleep / For he
thought iijC of his lords might well have be couerd with all / and made all
that night much lamentacion seyeng / A lord how many ben there of my lords
now in the mire / how many in the rayn / how many so cold that their teeth
beten to gydre / And how many that slepen in the market place / and said to him
self / and thou wretch deuourest the great fysshes and restest in thy chamber
with thy wickedness under a couertour of xxvj pound to warm thy carayn / And
after he would never be couerd therwyth / but on the morn he did do selle it /
and gaf the money thereof to pour people / And when the rich man saw it / he
bought it again / and took it to the blessed saint Ioh^n and desired him no
more to selle it / but keep it for him self / And anon after saint Ioh^n sold
it again / and gaf the money of hit to pour people / And when the rich man
wist it / yet he bought it again and brought it to saint Ioh^n full goodly and
said to him / we shall see who shall fayll of us / or thou in the sellyng or I in
the byeng / and thus it was often bought and sold / The rich man seeing well
that he might well mynusshe his richesse in this manner without sin to
thentente to give it to pour people / And they both should win in this manner
/ that one in saving of their souls / And that other in getyng reward / and
saint Ioh^n would draw men to do alms / in this manner / he was acustomed to
tell of saint serapion / when he had give his mantel to a pour man / And
after met with another that had cold / he gaf him his cote / And him self
satte al naked / And one demanded of him / Fader who has despoylled the / And
he had in his hand the book of theuangelies / and said this has dyspoylled me
/ And anon he saw another pour man / and then he sold the book of
gospellis and gaf the prys thereof to pour men / And when he was demanded where
his book of the gospellis was / he answered and said that the gospel coma^deth
and says Goo and selle all that thou have / and give it to the pour / I had
this gospel and I have sold it / like as he comandeth / On a time he gaf to a
pour man v besauntes / And the pour man had desdayn thereof and began to chyde
/ and despise him in his visage / by cause he had no more alms / And when his
struantes saw that / they would have beten him / And then the blessed Johan
deffended them saying / suffer ye him brethern and late him curse me / loo I
have this lx year blasphemed by my werkys Christ / and may not I not bear one
blame or vice of this man / And he commanded that a sack of money full / should
be brought / to fore this pour man that he should take as much as he world /
On a time after that the gospel was read in the church the people went out
and talked idle tales / And this holy patriarch apperceyued them / and followed
after and satte down among them / and said to them / Sons there as the sheep
been / there must the sheepherde be also / And therefore either ye must enter
with me in to the church / or else I must abide with you here / And thus he
did tweyes / And thereby he taught the people to abide and stand in the church
/ Another time there was a yongman had rauysshed anonne / And the clerkys
repreued the young man thereof to fore saint Ioh^n / And said he ought to be
cursid therefore by cause he had lost ij sowles / his own and the nonnes /
Then saint Johan withstode their sentence saying / not so my sons not so / I
shall show to you that ye co^myse two sins / First ye do against the
commandment of god which says Judge ye not / and ye shall not be Iuged /
Secondly ye wit not for certain whether they have sinned in to this day / and
have not be penytent / and have repented them It fill many times that saint
Ioh^n was rauysshyd in his prayers and was in a trance / And he was herd
dyspute with our lord / in these words / So good lord Ihesu christ so / I in
partyng and thou in mynystryng / late us see who shall overcome / On a time when
he was seek and vexid with the feures and saw that he approached his end / he
said / I yield to the thankynges / For thou have herd my wretchidnes prayeng
thy goodness that at my death should be found with me but one besaunt / or one
piece of money / and that yet I comande to be given to the pour / And then he
yielded his soul unto all mighty god / And his venerable body was put in a
sepulcre where the bodies of ij bysshoppis were buried / And the two bodies by
miracle gaf rome and place to the body of saint Ioh^n / For they remeued each
fro other / and left the mydle void for his body / A lityl time to fore his
death there was a woman had co^mysed a great and horrible sin / And durst not
be shryuen thereof ne ^hewe it to noman saint Ioh^n bad here write hit and seal
it / and bring it to him / And he would pray for her / she assented thereto /
she wrote her sin / and dylygently closed and sealed it / And delyuerd it to
saint Ioh^n / And anon after saint Ioh^n wax seek and deyde And when she herd
that he was deed she supposed her self confused and shamed / For she wend that
he has delyuerd it to som^e other man / and she came to his tomb / and there
wept and cried much lamentably saying / Alas Alas I supposed to have eschewid
my confusion / and now I am made confusion unto all other / and wept bytterly
prayeng saint Ioh^n that he would show to here where he had left her writing /
and And suddenly saint Ioh^n came and appiered to her in thabyte of a bishop /
on either side of him a bishop / and said to the woman / why troblest thou me
so much and thies saints wi^h me and suffrest not us to have rest / loo here
our clothes ben all weet of thy teeris / And then delyuerd to her her scrowe
again sealed as it was to fore saying to her / Se here thy seall / opene thy
writing and read it / which ano^ she opened / and all her sin was disfaced
and clean out / and she fond therein wreton / All thy sin is foryeuen / and
put away by the prayer of Ioh^n my servant / And then she rendered tha^kynges
to our lord god and to saint Ioh^n / And then saint Ioh^n with the two
bysshoppis returned in to their sepulture / This holy man saint Ioh^n flowrid
in the year of our lord vjCv in the time of foke the emperor /

Thus ends the life of saint Johan the Almosner
Of the conversion of saint paul and of the name of conversion
Conversion is said of conuertor / I am turned / or is as much as to gydre
turned from sins and euyllis / he is not converted that shryueth him to ye
priest of one sin and hydeth an other / It is said conversion / For saint
paul this day was converted to the faith leuyng his vices / why he is said
paul / it shall be said afterward /

Of the conversion of saint Paul
THe conversion of saint Paul was made the same year that christ suffered his
passion / and saint stephen was stoned also / not in the year naturell but
appieryng / For our lord suffered death the viij kalendes of apryll And saint
stephen suffered death the same year the third day of august / And was stoned
and saint paul was converted / the viij kalendis of feuerer / And three reasons
ben assigned wherefore the conversion of saint paul is hallowed more than of
other saynctes / First for thensample / by cause that no synnar what someuer he
be should despair of pardon / when he sees him that was in so great sin / to
be in so great Joy / Secondly for the Joy / For like as the church had great
so^owe in his persecucion / So had she great Joy in his conversion / Thyrdly
for the miracle that our lord shewde / when of j so cruel a persecutour was
made so true a prechour / The conversion of him was merueyllous by reason of
him that made him / and of him that ordained him / and of the pacient that
suffered it / by reason of him that made him to be converted / that was Ihesu
christ / which shewde there his merueillous puyssaunce / in that he said / it
is hard to the to strive against the all or prycke / and in that / he changed
him so suddenly / For anon as he was changed he said / lord what wylt you that
I do / upon this word says saint Austyn / the lamb slain of the wulues /
has made of a wulf a lamb / For he was ready for to obey / that to fore was
wood for to persecute / Secondly he showed his merueyllous wysedom / his
merueyllous wysedom was in that / that he took fro him the swellyng of pride /
in offryng to him the inward things of humylyte / and not the heyghte of
mageste / For he said I am Ihesus of nazareth / And he called not him self /
god ne the sone of god / but he said to him / take thynfirmytees of humanyte /
and cast away the squames of pride / Thyrdly he shewde his pyteous debonayrte
and mercy / which is signefied in that / that he that was in deed and in will
to persecute / he converted / how be it he had evil will / as he that desired
all the menaces and thretenynges / and had evil purpoos / as he that went to
the prince of preestis / as he that had a Joy in his evil werkis / that he
ladde the christian men bounden to Iherusalem / And therefore his Iourneye and
vyage was right evil / And yet nevertheless the mercy of god converted /
Secondly the conversion was merueyllous of him that ordained it that is of the
light that he ordained in his conversion / And it is said that this light was
dispositif / sudden / and celestyall / And this light of heaven aduyronned him
suddenly / Poule had in him three vices / the first was hardynesse / which is
noted wha^ it is said / that he went to the prince of the prestes / And as the
gloss says not called / but by his owen will and envy that enticed him / The
second was pride / and that is signefyed by that he desired and sighed the
menaces and thretenyngis / The third was thentente carnal and the
understanding that he had in the law / whereof the gloss says upon that word
/ I am Ih^u^s and cetera / I god of heuene speak / the which thou supposest to
be deed / by the consent of the Jews / And this light dyuyne was sodeyne / It
was great and out mesure for to throw done him that was hye and proud in to
the dyche or pytte of humanyte / It was celestyal / by cause it turned and
changed his flesshely understanding in to celestyall / Or it may be said that
this ordenaunce or dysposicion was in three things / that is to wete in the
voys cryeng / in the light shynyng / and in the virtue of puyssaunce / Thyrdly
it was merueyllous by the virtue of the souffryng of the pacyent that is of
poule in whom the conversion was made / For thyes three things were made in him
without forth merueyllously / that is to wit that he was beten to therthe / he
was blind / and fasted iij days and was smeton down to the ground for to be
raised / and saint austyn says he was smeton down for to be blind for to be
changed and for to be sent / he was sent to suffer death for truth / And
yet says saint Austyn / he that was out of the faith was hurt for to be made
bileue / the persecutor was hurt to be made a prechour / the sone of perdicion
was hurt / for to be made the vessel of election / And was made blind for to
be enlumyned / And this was as touching his derke understanding Then in the
iij days that he abode thus blind / he was learned and informed in the gospel
/ For he learned it never of man ne by man / as he him self witnesses but by
the reuelacion of I^^su christ / And saint Austyn says thus / I say that saint
poule was the very champion of Ihesu christ taught of him redressed of him /
crucyfyed with him / and glorious in him / he was made lene in his flessh /
that his flessh should be dysposid to theffecte of good operacion / And fro
then forthon his body was establyssed and desposed to all good / he could well
suffer hungre / and habondaunce / and was informed and instruct in all things
/ And all aduersitees he gladly suffered / crisostom^ says he ouercam
tormentours / tyrau^tes and people full of woodnesse / like as flies / And the
death / the torments / and all the pains that might be don to him / he counted
the^ but as the p^aye of children All them he embraced with a good will / And
he was ennobled in him self to be bound in a strong chain more than to be
crowned with a crown / And received more gladly strokes / and wounds than
other yeftes / And it is red that in him were three thyngis / aynest the three
that were in our formest fader adam / for adam erected and adressid him against
god our lord / And in saint poule was contrary / For he was throwe^ down to
the earth / In adam was thopenyng of his eyes / and poule was in the contrary
/ made blind / and adam ete of the fruit deffended / And saint poule contrary
was abstynent of cou^nable mete /

Thus ends the conversion of saint poule
Here follows of saint pawlyne the wydowe
Saint pawlyne was a much noble wydowe of rome / of whom saint Iherome wrote
the life / and says first thus / if all my members were turned in to tongues /
And all my Arteryes should resowne in humayne voys / yet I might not worthyly
write the virtues of saint paulyne / I take witness of god and of his holy
angellis / and also of thaungel that wa^ kepar of this woman that I shall say
nothing for preysyng / but tha^ some that I shall say shall be less than
apperteyneth to her virtues / She was born among the nobles of the senators of
Rome and of the lignage of the noble grygoys Rich of good and puyssaunt of
seygnorye at Rome / She was the most humble of all other / For like as the
son surmounteth the clerenes of the sterres / so surmounted she the bounte of
other by her great humylyte / when her husbond was passed out of this world she
abode lady of all the goods and Richesse / It happed that at mandement of
the emperor many bysshoppis came to Rome / emonge whom were there the holy man
paulynus the patryarke of Anthyoche / And Epiphanus bishop of cypre / of whom
she was esprysed in good virtues so yt she gaf largely of her goods for gods
sake / her parents / ne her friends / ne her own children / could not torn
her ne to make her to change her purpose / but that she would become the
pilgryme of Ihesu christ / For thamerous desire that she had to Ihesu christ
surmou^ted the love that she had to her children / Only among all her children
she had put her affection in eustochiu^ her daughter / whom she lad with her
in this pylgremage / She took the sea / and saylled so far that she came in to
the holy land of Iherusalem / O how great devotion she had to vysyte the holy
sepulcre / of Ihesu christ / and the other holy places / and how all weeping she
kyssed them / there can noman reherce all / All the cite of Iherusalem could
speak of it / And yet best of all knew the lord / for whose love she had
forsaken all thing / She had be at rome so puyssaunt and so noble / that every
man coueyted to do to her honor / for her great reno^mee / but she that was
founded upon humylyte sought the humble places and relygions / and came at
last to bethleem / And when she had devoutly vysyted the place / in which the
vyrgyne marye enfaunted and childed Ihesu christ she fill in a vysion / And as
she swear to me / that she saw in that vision the child wrapped in pour
clowtes lyeng in the cribbe or in the rack / and how the three kings
worshipped him / how the sterre came upon the hows / and how the shepherdes came
to see him / and how herodes made persecucion upon the Innocentis / and how
Joseph bare the child in to egypt / And this vysion she said all in weeping
and in lawhyng / and said I salewe the bethleem wherein he is born that
descended fro heaven / Of the prophesyed mychee the xv chapter / That of the
should be born the god that should govern the people of Israhel / And the lygnage
of david should endure in the / unto the time that the glorious virgyne should
enfaunte Jesus christ / and I wretched as unworthy to repute me to kiss the
crybbe / in which our lord wept as a child / and the vyrgyne chylded / here I
shall take my rest and my dwelling / For my savior chaas this place in
bethleem / She made there her habytacion with many vyrgynes that served god /
And how well that she was lady of all / nevertheless she was the most humble and
meke in spekyng in habyte / and in going / in such wise that she seemed servant
of all the other / She never ete after the death of her husbond with noman / how
good that he was / she vysited as it is said to fore all the holy places and
the monks of Egypt / among whom were many of the ancient fadres and many
holy men / And her seemed that she saw Isesu christ among them / And after she
founded in bethleem an abbaye in which she assembled virgynes / as well of
noble estate as of myddle and low lygnage / And departed them in three
congregacions / so that they were departed in work / in mete and drynk but in
saying their psaultier and adouryng were they to gydre at hours as it
apperteyned / And she enduced and informed all the other in prayer and in work
by ensample gyuyng / She was never idle / And all ^hey were of one habyte /
And they had no shetes / ne lynnen cloth but to dry their hands / And they
might have no license to speak to men / And them that came late to the hours /
she blamed debonayrly or sharply after that they were and suffered not that any
of them should have any thing save the living and clothyng / for to put away
auaryce / fro them / She appeased them swetely that stroof / And also she brake
and mortyfyed among the young maidens / their flesshly desires / by contynuel
fastings / For she had leuyr have them good suffryng sorrow and sekenes / than
their heart should be hurt by flesshly will And she chastysed them that were
nyce and queynte / saying that such nycete was fylthe of the soul / and said
also / that a word sownyng to any ordure or fylthe should never issue out of ye
mouth of a virgyne / For by the words outward is showed the countenance of ye
heart within / and she that so spack and was rebuked therefore / if she amended
it not at the first warnyng / ne at second / ne at the third / she should be
dysseueryd fro the other in etyng and in drynkyng / by which she should be
asshamed / And thus should be amended by debonayr correction / and if she would
not / she should be punysshyd by right great moderacio^ / She was merueyllous
debonayr and pyteous / to them that were seek / and comforted them and served
them right besily / And gaf to the^ largely to ete such as they asked / but to
her self she was hard in her sekenes and skarce / For she refused to ete flessh
/ how well she gaf it to other / and also to drink wyn / She was often by them
that were seek / and leyde the pylowes a right and in point / And froted their
feet / and chauffed water to wasshe them / And her seemed that the less she
did to the seek in seruyse / so much less seruyse did she to god and
deserved less merit / And therefore she was to them pyetous / and nothing to
her self / In her right great sekenesses she would have no soft bid / but lay
upon the str^we or upon the ground / and took but lityl rest / For the most
part she was in prayers both by day and by night / and she wept so moc^ that
it seemed of her eyes a fontayne / so (...) tre^^s ran fro them / And when we
said to her oftymes that she should keep her eyes fro weeping so much / she said
the vysage ought to be like to be fowl / by cause it has so much be made fair
and gay against the commandment of god / And the body ought to be chastised /
that has had so much solas in this world / and the lawhyngis ought to be
recompensed by wepyngis / And the soft bed and the shetis ought to be
chau^gyd in to the sharpnes of hayer / I that was acustomed to pleyse man and
the world / I desire now to pleyse Ihesu christ / And what shall I say of
chastete / in which she was example / unto all ladies of time passed / when she
was yet seculyer For she conuersed in such wise / that they that were enuyous
durst not auyse on her any evil fame / she was debonayr and curtoys / unto all
/ For she comforted the pour / and warned the rich / to do well / but in
largess she passed so / that n^ pour man complained of her / And this did
she not by the great habundance that she had of goods but by her wise
governance / and when I said to her that she should have mesure in doing
alms / after that the appostle says / that thalmesse that is done to
another / be not grievous to him that does it / But she said that for the love
of our lord she did all / And that she desired to deye beggyng / in such wise
that she should not leave one penny to her daughter after her / And that she might
be wrapped in a strange shete when she should deye / And at last she said / if
I should demand ought / I should find enough that would give to me / And thyes
beggars if I gaf to them naught / and they so departed and deyde for pouerte /
Of whom should god demand this / Often said she se^ / They be happy that been
mercyful / And alms quenchyth sy^ne / as the water quenches the fire / but
for to do alms it comes not always to perfection For many do almesses /
that abide in their carnalytees / they seem to be good without forth / but
within they be mortal paulyne was not such one she affebled her body right
sore / in fasting and in labor uneath she set her eyes to her (...) without
etyng fysshe / ne milk / eggs or white mete / in which many wene to do
great abstynence / without etyng flessh / For our lord gaf to her an aduersarye
/ the stymulacion flesshly / by which she held her in humylyte without
sauouryng any thing of pride for the foyson of her virtues / And also that she
thought not to be heyer than other wymen / She had alleway in her mind the
holy scriptures against the deceyuaunces of the friend / And specially this that
moys says / god assayeth you / if he love you / And this that ysaye says the
prophet / ye that have be at solas and Joys of the world / and now be
withdrawn fro them and left them / look after none other thing / but to
suffer tribulacion upon trybulacion / And know ye by tribulacion is had
patience / And by patience is had pouerte / It is said Job primo capl^o / when
it was showed to him the loss of his patrymonye / he answered I issued nakyd fro
the belly of my mother / And I shall reentre nakyd again in to therthe / like as
god may be plesyd / so be it done / his name be preysed and blessed / he learned
us that we should not love the world / For the world shall fynysshe in her
couetyse / when one told her that her children were right seek / she said / who
loves his sone or his daughter more tha^ god is not worthy to be with god / A
man that seemed to be her friend / sent her word on a time / that she had great
need to keep well her brain / For by cause of thardeur that she had in virtues
she seemed to be out of her wit And she answered / In this world we be reputed
as fools for the love of Ihesu christ / And our lord said to his appostles /
the world hates you / For ye be not of the world / if ye were of the world
that is to say of the conversion of the world / the world should love you /
Fair lord god we mortyfye our self allewaye / and we be reputed as sheep that
be brought to death / by cau^^ that without playnyng we mortefye our bodies / In
such patience was she unto the death / and suffered humbly thenuye of them that
were evil / She had in her mind the holy scriptures / And she held her more
to the spyrituel understanding than to thystoryes of the scripture / She could
parfyghtly hebrewe / greek latin and frensshe / and read coursably the
scriptures in these four langages / who may recounte without weeping the deeth
of this woman / She fylle in a maladye mortal / and saw well that she should
deye / For all her body bycam cold / And she felt that her spirit held her
in her breast / Then said she without playnyng / and with out having any
charge sauf to god / Fair sweet lord I have coueyted the beauty of thy house for
to be in thyn habytacion / that is so fair / My soul has desired to be in thy
Royame / And wha^ I demanded her wherefore she spack no more / And she would not
answer me and I asked if she suffered great pain / she said to me in grekis
tongue that she was well and in good peace / And anon she left spekyng te me
and closed her eyes in saying / to god / Lord like as the heart desires to
come to the fontayne / so desires my soul to come to the / Alas when shall I
come to the / fair lord god / And in saying these words she made a cross upon
her mouth There were bysshoppis / prestes / clerks chanones / and monks
without nombre / And at last when she herd her spowse Ihesu christ which
callid her saying / Arise and come to me my sweet love and fair espowse / For
the winter is passed / she answered gladly / the flowers ben shewde in our
country / And I believe that I shall see the goods in the Royame of heuene of my
lord Ihesu christ / And thus she rendered her soul and passed out of this world
/ And anon all the congregation of vyrgynes made no cry in weeping as don ye
people of the world / but read devoutly their psaltier / not only unto the time
that she was buried / but all ye day and all the night / and with great pain
could not Eustochiu^ her venerable daughter the virgyne be withdrawe^ fro her /
but she kyssed her and embraced her pyteously in weeping the death of her mother /
And Ihesus witnesses that saint paulyne left not one penny to her daughter /
she had so given alms of all her great Richesse / many give largely for
gods sake / but they give not somoche / but som^e abides / when she was
passed as said is / her lyppes ne her face were not pale / but was as reverent
to look on / as she had been yet alive / She was buried in a sepulture in
bethleem with right great honor / b^y the bysshoppis / preestis / clerks /
monks / vyrgyns / and all the pour people of the country / which playned that
they had lost their good mother / that had nourisshed them / She lived in Rome
holyly xxxiij year And in bethleem xx year / And all her age was liij year /
vij months and xx days / fro the time of honor Emperor of Rome / Then
late us pray to this holy woman that she pray for us /

Thus ends the life of saint Pawlyne
Here follows of saint Iulien the bishop / And first the interpretacion of
his name
IUlien is as much to say as Iubilus / Syngyng / and ana / that is an hye /
And thereof Iulyen as going to hye things in syngyng Or it is said Julius that
is as much to say / as not wise / and anus that is old / For he was old in
the service of god / and not wise in reputacion of him self /

Saint Iulyen was bishop of cenomanence / It is said that it was he that was
said Symo^ the lepre wham our lord heled of his mesel^rye / and bad Ihesu christ
to dinner / And after thascencion of our lord he was ordained of thappostles
bishop of Emaus / full of great virtues / he appyered to the world he raised
three deed me^ and after he ended his days in great preysyng of god / Of this
saint Iulyen som^e say / that this is he that pylgryms and weyfaryng men call
and require for good herberowe / by cause our lord was lodged in his hows / but
it seems better that it is he that slew his fader and mother ignorau^tly / of
whom thystorye is here after / There was another Iulyen born in almayne / which
was of noble lygnage / and yet more noble in faith and in virtue / which for
the great desire that he had to be martyr / he offrid him self to the tyrauntis
where he had not forfayted / Now it happed that crispmus which was one of the
governors of rome sent to him one of his mynystres for to put him to death /
anon as the mynystre came to him / he issued out of his place / And came to fore
him / And offered to him to suffer death And his heed was smeten of / And they
took the head and shewde it to saint Feryel that was his fellow / And said they
would so do of him / if he sacrefyed not / And by cause he would not obey to
them / they slew him / And took the heed of saint Iulyen and the body of saint
Feryoll / and buried them both in one pytte / And a great while after saint
mamertyne bishop of vyane / fond the heed of saint Iulyen between the hands
of saint feryol also hoole as it had be buried that same day / among the other
miracles of saint Iulyen it is said that a deken took all the white sheep that
were of the church of saint Iulyen / And the shepherdes defended them / but he
said to them that saint Iulyen ete never no moto^ / And anon after a fever took
him so great and hooot / that he knowleched that he was of the martyr so burnt
/ And he did water to be cast on him / for to cole him /

And anon issued out of his body such a fume and smoke / and therewith so great
a stenche / that all they that were present were constrained to flee / and anon
after he deyde / Another miracle happed of a man of a vyllage / that on a
s^nday would ere his lands / and when he took the share to make clean his
cultre / hit cleuyd to his hond / and two year after / at prayer of saint
Iulien in the church he was hel^d /

There was another Iulyen which was brother to one named Iulie / These two
brethern went to the emperor Theodose / which was a very christian man / And
they prayed him that they might destroy all thydolles that they might find /
And that they might edefye chyrches / eth which thing the emperor granted them
/ And wrote that all men should obey them and help them upon pain to lose
their hedes / Now it happed that they edefyed a church / and all men by the
commandment of the emperor obeyed and heelp them It happed that there were som^e
men that ladde a carte which should pass by / and thought how they might do
and pass without arestyng for to help them / they thought that one of the^
should lie on the carte / as he were deed And thereby they would excuse them / And
so they did / and bad him that lay in the carte to hold his eyes cloos till
they were passed the paas / And when they came in the place where they edefyed
the church / Iulien and Iulie his brother said to them / my sons tarry a while
and come help us to work / they answered that they might not For they carried a
deed man / Saint Iulien said to them / why lie ye so / they answered / Sire we
lie not / it is so as we say to you / And saint Iulyen said to them / so mote
fall to you as ye say / And anon they droof forth their oxen and passed forth
And when they were passed a lytyl / they called their felawe / that he should
arise and drive forth the oxen / for to goo the faster / And he answered not one
word And they called him again on hye and said / art thou out of thy wit /
arise up and drive forth the beestys / and he meued ne spack not one word /
They went up and dyscoueryd him and fond him deed / as saint Iulyen had said
to them / Then took they such dread and fere that after that / they ne none
otheer that herd of the miracle durst ly no more to fore the holy servant of
god /

Another Iulyen there was that slew his fader and mother by ygnourau^ce / And
this man was noble and young and gladly went for to hunte / And one time emonge
all other he fond an heart which returned to ward him / and said to him /
thou huntest me that shall slay thy fader and mother / hereof was he much
abashed and aferd / And for dread that it should not happen to him / that the
heart had said to him / he went pryuely away that noman knew thereof And fond
a prince noble and great / to whom he put him in seruyse / And he preued so
well in bataylle / and in services in his palace / that he was so much in the
princes grace that he made him knight /

And gaf to him a rich wydowe of a Castle / and for her doware he received
the castle / And when his fader and mother knew / that he was thus goon / they
put hem in the way for to seek him in many places / And so long they went /
till they came to the castle where he dwelled / but then he was goon out / and
they fond his wife / And when she saw them she inquired dylygently who they
were / And when they had said and recounted what was happend of their sone /
she knew verily that they were the fader and mother of their husbonde / And
receyuyd them much charitably / And gaf to them her own bed / And made
another for her self / And on the morn the wife of Iulyen went to the church
And her husbond come home whiles she was at church /

And entered in to his chamber for to awake his wife / And he saw tweyne in his
bed / And had wend that it had been a man that had leyen with his wif / And
slew them both with his swerd / And after went out and saw his wife coming
fro church Then he was much abashed / and demanded of his wife who they
were that lay in his bed / then she said that they were his fader and his
mother / which had long sought him / And she had leyed them in his bed /
Then he swowned and was almost deed / And began to weep bytterly and cry /
Alas caytyf that I am / what shall I do that have slain my fader and mother /
Now it is happened that I supposed to have eschewed / And said to his wife /
Adieu / And fare well my right dear love / I shall never rest / till that I shall
have knwleche / if god will pardone and foryeue me this that I have don and
that I shall have worthy penance therefore / And she answered Right dear love god
forbede that ye should goo without me / like as I have had Joy with you / so
will I have pain and heaviness / Then departed they / and went till they came
to a great river / over which much folk passed / where they edeffyed an
hospytall much great for to herberowe pour people / And there do their
penance / in beryng men over that would pass / After long time saint Iulyen
slepte about mydnyght sore traueylled and it was frozn / and much cold / And
he herd a voys lamentyng and cryeng that said / Iulien come / and help us over
/ And anon he aroos and went over and fond one almost deed for cold / and
anon he took him and bare him to the fire / and did great labor to chauffe
and warm him / And when he saw that he could not be chaufed ne warm / he
bare him in to his bed / and couerd him the best wise he might / And anon
after he that was so seek and appiered as he had be meselle he saw all shynyng
assendyng in to heaven / and said to saint Iulien his host / Iulien our lord
has sent me to the / and sends the word / that he has accepted thy
penance / And a while after saint Iulien and his wife rendrid unto god their
souls and departed out of this world /

Another Iulien there was but he was no saynct / but a cursed man and was called
Iulianus apostata / This Iulyen was first a monk / and showing out ward signs
of great religion and of great holiness / after that that master Johan beleth
recites / There was a woman that had three pottes full of gold And by cause the
gold should not be seyn / she had put in the mouth of the pot abouen ashes /
And delyuerd them to this Iulien to fore other monks for to keep / whom she
reputed an holy man / but she said not to him that they were full of gold / when
he had these pottes he looked what was therein and he fond that it was gold / and
took it out all / And fylle them full of ashes / And fled with all to Rome /
And did so much that he was of the counceyllours and governors of Rome / But
the woman when she would have a gayn her pottes / she could not preue that she
had delyueryd to him / in keeping gold / For she made no mention thereof to fore
the monks / And therefore he retained it / and procured with all thoffyce of a
consul of the governance of Rome / And after that he procured somoche that he
was instytued emperor / whylis he was young he was taught in the art of
enchauntement and of thynuocacions of feendes / And gladly he studied and it
plesed him much / and had with him diverse maystres of that science / Now it
happed on a day that as his maistre was out / he began allone to read
thynuocacions / And a great multitude of feendis came about him and made him
aferd / and he made the sign of the cross and anon they vanysshed away / And
wha^ his maistre was returned he told him what was happend to him / but his
maistre said to him / yt alleway he had hated and fered that sign / when
then he was emperor / he reme^brid the rof / and by cause he would use the
craft of devil / ouerall where he fond ye signs of the cross / he destroyed
the^ / and persecuted christian men / by cause that he knew well / that
otherwise the feendes would not do for him /

Now it happed that he descended in to a regyon that is called perside / And
fro thens he sent in to thoccident / a devil for to have answer of that he
said to him / And this devil went / and abode x days in one place without
meuyng by cause there was a monk contynuelly in prayer night and day / And when
he might not do / he returned / Then Iulien demanded him / where he had been
so long he answered / I have been in a place where I fond a monk night and
day prayeng / And I supposed to have troubled him that he should no more pray
And all this while I could never torn him fro his prayer / And thus I am
returned without doing any thing / Then Iulien thapostata had great
Indignacion / and said when he came thider / he would avenge him of the monk /
And when he went in to perse / the deuylles promised him yt he should have
victory of a cite / The master of enchantemens which deuyned by the devil
for him said to a christian man / what does the smythis sone / he said yt he
made a sepulture for Iulyen his maistre / and as it is read in thistorye of
saint basille / he came in cesar^e of capadoce / And saint basille came against
him / and presented three louys to him / which he sent to him / And Iulien had
great Indygnacion of this yefte / And for the breed he sent to saint basille
heye saying Thou have sent to me mete for dombe beestis / therefore take this
that I send to the / Saint basille said we have sent to the such as we ete /
and thou sendest to us of that thou nourisshest thy beestis with Of which
answer Iulien was wroth and said / when I shall have don in perse / I shall
destroy this cite in such wise / that it shall be better ordained for to ere
and sow / than people to dwell in / and ye night syewyng saint basille saw in
a vision in the church of our lady that a great multitude of angellis / and in
the myddle of them a woman / being in a trone which said to them / Call to me
mercurye whom Iulien thappostata has slain / which blasplemeth me and my sone
/ Mercurye was a knight that for the faith of god / had be slain of Iulyen /
and was buried in the same church / Then anon Mercurye with all his Arms
that were kept was present / And at the commandment of the lady he went to
bataylle / Saint basylle awoke all affrayed / And went to ye tomb where the
knight was buried in / And opened the sepulcre / but he fond neither body ne
Arms / Then he commanded of the kepar / who had take away the body And he
swear that in the even to fore it was there / Saint basylle after on the morn
returned and fond the body and the armures and the spear all blody / And anon
came one fro the bataylle / which said that Iulyen thapostata and Emperor was
in the bataylle / And thither came a knight unknown all armed with his spear /
which hardyly smote his horse with his spores / and came to Iulyen the emperor and
brandysshyd his swerd and smote him through the body and suddenly he departed /
and was never after seen to gydres / And yel when he should dye / he took his
hand full of blood and cast it in to the air saying / Thou have vaynquysshed
man of Galile / thou have ouercomen / And in cryeng thus / myserably he espyred
/ and deyed in great pain and was left without sepulture of all his men / And
he was flayn of the perses / And of his skin was made to the king of perses a
vndercoueryng / And thus he deyed cursedly /

Thus enden the lives of four holy saints euerich named Iulien / And of one
that was a falls Apostata
Here follows the life of saint Ignacien bishop / And first thynterpretacion
of his name
IGnacien is said as one suffryng fire and brennyg / For he was embraced / and
all esprysed of the deuyne and brennyng love of god /

Of saint Ignacien
Saint Ignacie^ was disciple of saint Johan Evangelist / And was bishop of
Anthioche / And after that as som^e say he sent a lettre unto our lady or an
epistle in this wise / unto marye the virgyne / that bare Ih^u christ in her
body / I humble Ignacien her servant send gretyng / I that am yet a nouyse In
the faith and dysciple to Ihesu christ and to Ioh^n thy dear friend / desire to
have of the som^e comfort / and consolacion of some good enseygnem^t and
techyng / For of Ihesus thy sone I have herd say many merueylles / of which
I am enjoyed to here only of the / which have ben alleway in his company /
thou know well the secret desires of him thou have be plainly informed / And
they that be yet young in the faith with me trust much to be endoctryned of
the and informed in their creaunce and believe / lady god salewe the / And to
this lettre answered the glorious virgyne marye in this manner / Ignace good
disciple of Jesus and his especyal friend / the humble handmayd of Ih^u christ
sends to the gretyng / I do the to wete / that all that Ioh^n has said to
the of Ihesu christ / And all that thou have learned of him / is true doctrine
and thing certain Goo alleway in good crea^ce and believe / and keep fermly the
promise of thy crystyn faith / and do thy works acordyng to the same / I
shall come with Ioh^n for to visit the and other christian me^ with the / hold
the alleway well in the faith and in good works / And late no persecucio^ ne
aduersite that you shall suffer moeue the fro thy faith ne fro thy creaunce / but
have solaas and affyaunce in Ih^u crist thy savior / This was thanswere of his
lettre / Saint Ignacien was a man right well learned / And the third bishop
after saint peter thappostle of the church of Anthyoche / And much desired to
be a martyr for ye faith of Ihesu crist / It happed that Traian which was
emperor of Rome passyd by Anthioche / To whom Ignace showed to him and blamed
of this that he persecuted christian men / wherefore the emperor did him to be
taken and put in yrons / And in that wise by x knights to be ladde to Rome /
There he was presented to fore the emperor / and all the senators of Rome /
And was constrained by promesses / by menaces / And by tormentis many great /
and horrible / for to adoure thydolles / Saint Ignace showed to them clearly yt
their gods had been theuys / Rybauldes / and men of abhomynable and evil life /
And that they were dampened in hell / And that they had been in great error in
this / that of so cursid men they made their gods / and worshypped deuyllys /
and had forsake god which had made and created all the world / And his blessed
sone which in humayne nature had redemyd and sauyd the world / Fynably after
this that he had be tormented by fire and by betyng / and prison / The Emperor
did send for the romans in a place and there did do set saint Ignace /
And did do bring theder two lions for to devour him / but he had never
dread for death ne for other torments / of which he had suffered many / but was
alleway comforted for to deye for the love of Ih^u crist / and he said at
last / I am wheete of Ihesu christ which ought to be grou^den between the
teeth of these bestes / by which I may be pure bread / for to be presented to
my lord / And anon the lions ca^ and strangled him / without treryng of his
flessh or any thing hurtyng it / wherefore traian had great merueylle and
departed fro the place / It is read that saint Ignace in all his torments /
and all the pains of martirdom that he suffered / that his tongue never
ceased to name the name of Ih^us / And when they that tormented him demanded
him wherefore he named this name so often / he answered know ye for certain that I
have in my heart this name wreton^ And therefore I may not leave to name this name
often And by cause hereof when he was deed / they that herd these words opened
his body and drew out his heart and cut it open / And they fond with in the
name of Ihesu wreton with fair lettres of gold / For which miracle many
received the faith of Ihesu christ / Of this saint says saint bernard upon the
psalm / Qui habitat / Saint Ignace martyr of god glorious is of great merit /
which was mynystre to the dyscyple that Ihesus so much louyd / And in his
epystles / the which he sent to the glorious vyrgyne marye / he salewed her
as mother that had born Ihesu christ / And she resalewed him again in sign that
he was a person of great honor / of great dygnyte / and of of great Auctoryte
/ The body of whom was honorably buried of christian me^ to the worship of
Ihesu christ / which is blessed in secula seculorum Amen /

Here ends the life of saint Ignacien
And here follows the puryficacion of our lady
POstquam impleti sunt dies purgacionis marie secundum legem moysi tulerunt
Ihesum in Iherusalem / luce secundo capitulo / Thauncyent law had his course
until the time that god has suffered death for us / And when he deyde on the
cross / he said Iohannis nono capl^o / Consummatum est / That is to say /
all thing is fynysshed and ended that has be wreton of me which law he
kept during his life / as it is wreton / I am not comen for to break the law /
In which he gaf us example of humylyte / and of obedience / like as saint Poul
says In like wise our lady for tobeye to the law / bare her sweet sone Ihesu
Christ unto the temple of Iherusalem after the xl day of his birth / for to
offer him to god / and for to give offryng for him such as in the law was
ordained / that is to wete a payr turtellis / or two douues was thoffryng of
pour folk / like as it is wreton / Our lord which in all caas came to make
our sauacion dayned not only to humble him self and descend fro his royame /
and becam man mortal semblable to us / Also he dayned to be born of a pour
woman / And was pour / for tenriche us / and draw us out of the myserye of
this world to the richesse permanable / And we that been pour by cause of our
sins / and without Richesses of good vyrtues / So worthyly should we come and
be at feste of our lord / we should offer to him that which by the offryng is
signefyed / The douue which is of her nature simple / and wyhout galle / And
the turtle naturelly chaste / For when she has lost her make / she will never
have other make / And with that she takes the weeping for her song / we ought
to offer to our lord instead of ij douues one simple will and a good Intencion
/ without reteynyng in our heart any galle of anger or of hate / toward our
neyhbour / For as our lord says / if thyn eye be simple / all thy works shall
be in light / And hereof says saint Johan theuangelist in thapocalipse / The
cite needs no son ne moan to shine in it / For the clerenes of god shall
enlumyne it / And his lantern in lambs / The lamb is the light / by the
lamb which is simple / is signefyed to us a simple conscience and ryghtwys /
which makes true Judgment of thyntencion / For all works ben good or evil /
if they be done in evil entencion or by ypocrysye they ben evil and without
prouffyt / like as says Ihesu christ / if thyn eye be evil / All thy body
shall be derke / by the eye / is understand thentencion with goodness simple /
And debonairte signefieth by the douues / we ought also to offer a pair of
turtles to our lord / that is to say a chaste life / and a very entencio^ to
leave our sins / the which is signefyed to us by the chasttete of the turtle
/ And by her weeping / the contricion / As Bede says Contricion ought to
begin in dread / and end in love / For the soul faithful / when she
remembers her sins in her conscience / She wepeth for the dread of the
pains of hell / that she has deseruyd / and thus offreth she to god a turtle
/ And when she has wept / there comes to her an hope to have mercy and pardon
of her sins / And this hope conceived of dread in him a love of god to serve
and to be in his company / So that that soul / that ought to sing wepeth for
love / which has delyuerd her so sone fro the paryllis and myseryes of this
world and for to come to the sweet company of our lord / And thus offreth she
that other turtle in weeping with david the prophet the long pylgremage / that
she has made in the myseryes of this world saying / Heu me quia incolatus meus
prolongatus est / For when she begins to think after the Joyous company of
Angellis / and of the sowles that been in heuene / And what Joy and deduyt that
they have in the ouerdesirous sight of our lord / Then all the world greueth
them / and desires to be delyuerd fro the faytes of the body / for to goo in
to the company of these holy sowlis And also that saint Symeon / which by
reuelacion of the holy ghoost / came in to the temple of Iherusalem in the same
hour / that the blessed virgyne brought her dear sone for to offer him / And
the holy ghoost had showed to him / that to fore that he should deye corporally
he should see Ihesu christ comen in to therthe / the which birth he knew
long before to be showed by the prophets / And when he saw Ihesu christ
brought in to the temple / anon he knew him by the holy ghoost / to be very
god and very man / And took him between his Arms and said / fair lord god late
thy sergeant and servant from hensforth be in peace / And suffer that after
this reuelacion showed to me I may depart and deye / for to be delyuerd fro
the euyllis of this world / For mine eyes corporell and spyrytuell has seen thy
blessed sone Ihesu christ / which shall save the creatures humayne fro their
sins / the which thou have made ready and ordained to fore the face of all
creatures humayne / for to be light to all people by his doctrine / tenlumyne
and take away derknesses that is to say of their ydolatrye / After this that
ysaye the prophet has prophesied of him / Populus genau^ qui ambulabat in
tenebris and cetera / the people of ge^tilis or paynems / which walked in
derknessis to worship ydollis and deuyllys for very god / saw a great light /
when they issued fro their sins by the doctrine of Ih^u crist which came also
to the glory of the Jews / For they received his sight bodyly / like as was
promised them / by the witness of the prophets / by which they might gloryfye
them / of this that their ryghtful king was born among them / and conuersed
bodyly in their country / And saint Symeon said Nunc dimittis seruum tuun
domine etc^ Sire let thy servant in pees after thy word // For mine eyes have /
seen thy health / which thou have made ready to fore the face of all peples /
that is light to the reuelacion of paynems / and to the glory of thy people of
Israhel / Ihesu christ is called pees / health / light and Joy / Peace by cause
that he is our moyen and our advocate / Health For he is our redemer / Light
for he is our enformer / And glory / for he is our governor / This feste is
called candelmas / And is made in remembrance of thoffryng that our lady
offryd in the temple as said is / And euerych beryth this day a candel of wax
brennyng / which represents our lord Ihesu christ / like as the candel
brennyng has three thyngis in it / that is to wit the wax / the weyke and the
fire / Right so be three thyngis in Ih^u christ / that is the body the soul and
the godhede / For the wax which is made of the be purely wthout company and
myxtionn of of one be with another / signefyeth the body / of our lord Ihesu
christ / And the fire of the candele signefyeth the dyuynyte of Ihesu christ /
which enlumyneth all creatures / And therefore if we will appiere in this feste
to fore the face of god pure and clean / and acceptable we ought to have in us
three thyngis / which be signefied by the candell brennyng / that is good
deedis true faith / with good werkis / And like as the candell without
brennyng is deed / Right so / faith is deed without werkis as saint Iame saiths
For to believe in god without obeyeng his coma^dementis prouffyteth nothing And
therefore says saint gregorye / The good work ought to show withoutforth /
that thyntencion abide good withinforth the heart / without sechyng within any
vain glory to be allowed and praised / And by the fire is vnderstonden charity
/ Of which god says / I am comen to put fire in therthe / and whom I will I
will brenne / This feste is called the puryficacion of our lady / not for that
she had need ne ought make her purificacion / For she was pure and clean
without having of any tatche of dedely sin ne venyal / like as she that had
without company of any man by the virtue of the holy ghoost conceived the sone
of god / and was delyueryd with out leesyng of her virgynyte / So she came with
her blessid sone at forty day / after his natyuyte for tobeye the
commandment of the law / after the manner of other wymen / which had need of
purificacion / And also for to show to us thexample of humylite / he is very
humble that is worthy to be praised for his virtues / This glorious lady is
queen of heuene and lady of angellis / neuerthebes she is pure and humble
emonge the wymen / like as a pour woman / without making any semblant of her
great humylyte / ne of the hye mageste of her sone / whereof saint bernard says
in this manner O who may make us to understand glorious lady the thought of
thyn heart / that thou had emonge the seruyses that thou made to thy
blessed sone in gyuyng him souke in leyeng down and reysyng / when thou saw
a lytyl child of the born on that one part and of that other side thou know
him to be god almighty /

And now thou byleuest and see him create / that had created all the world
/ Now thou see him feeble as a child which is all mighty and all puyssaunt
/ Now thou fedest him / that all the world fedeth / And now thou see him not
spekyng that made man and speech /

O who should conne show here upon the secrets of thyn heart / how sauoured
thy courage / when thou heldest thy child between thyn arms / whom thou
louedest as thy lord / And kyssed him as thy sone / who should not merueylle of
this miracle / when a virgyne and a a clean Maid has enfaunted and chylded
her maker and lord of all the world / To him let us adresse our thoughts /
and enbrace we this child of one very believe / whom we ought to love by cause
he has humbled him self for us / And to doubt him / by cause he is our Judge
and our lord / to whose comandementes we owe tobeye / if we will be saved /

We read an example of a noble lady which had great devotion in the blessid
virgyne marye / and she had a chapel in which she did do say mass of our
lord daily by her chapelayn / It happed that the day of the purificacion of our
lady her chappelayn was out so that this lady might that day have no mass /
And she durst not goo to another church by cause she had given her mantel unto
a pour man for the love of our lady / she was much sorrowful by cause she
might here no mass / And for to make here deuocions she went in to the
chapelle / and to fore thaulter she knelyd down for to make her prayers to our
lady / And anon she fyl a sleep / in which she had a vision / And her seemed
that she was in a church / and saw come in to the church a great company of
vyrgyns to fore whom she saw come a right noble virgyne / crowned right
preciously / And when they were all set each in order / came a company of
young men which satte down each after other in order like the other / After
entered one that bare a burden of candellis / And departed them to them above
first and so to each of them by order he gaf one / And at last came this man
to this lady aforsayd and gaf to her also a candell of wax / The which lady
saw also come a priest / a deken and a subdeken all reuestyd going to thaulter
as for to say mass / And her seemed that saint laurence and saint vynce^t were
deken and subdeken / And Ihesu crist the priest / And two angellis beryng to
fore them candellis / And two young angellis began the Introyte of the mass /
And all the company of the vyrgyns song the mass / And when the mass was
song unto thoffryng / her seemed that thylke virgyne so crowned went to fore
and after all the other followed / and offrid to the priest knelyng much
devoutly their candellis / And when the priest tarried for this lady that she
should also have comen / to thoffryng / The gloryouse queen of virgyns sent to
her to say / that she was not curtoys to make the priest so long to tarry for
her / And the lady answered / that the priest should proceed in his mass forth /
for she would keep her kandell and not offer it / And the gloryouse vyrgyne
sent yet ones to her / And she said she would not offer her candelle / The
third time the queen said to the messager / goo and pray her that she come
and offer her candell / or ellis take it from her by force / The messager came
to this lady / And by cause in no wise she would not come and offer up her
candell / he set hand on the candell that this lady held / and drew fast /
and she held fast / And so long he drew and haled that the candelle brake
in two pyeces / And that one half abode stylle in the hand of the lady aforsaid
/ which anon awoke and came to her self / and fond the piece of the candell in
her hand / whereof she much merueylled / and thanked our lord and the
gloryouse vyrgyne marye devoutly / which had suffered her that day not to be
without mess / And all the days of her life after / she kept that pyece of
that candle much preciously / like an holy relyque / And all they that were
touchyd therwyth were guarysshed and heled of their maladyes and sekenessis /
Late us pray then humbly to the glorious vyrgyne marye which is confort to
them yt forsake their sins / that she will make our peays to her blessed sone
/ and Impetre and get of him remyssion of all our sins / And after this life
to come to the glory and Joy of heuene / to the which bring us / the fader
/ the sone and the holy ghoost Amen /

Here ends the purificacion of our lady
Here follows the life of saint Blase and first of his name
BLase is as much to say as glosyng / or it is said as belacius of bela
which is habyte / and sius which is to say / lityl / And thus he is said
glosyng by the swetenes of his word / meke by his habyte of virtues And lytyl
by humylyte of manners and of conversion /

Of the life of saint Blase
Saint Blase was so sweet / holy / and humble in manners / that the criste^ men
of capadoce / of the cite of Sebaste chees him to be a bishop / The which
when he was bishop saw yt dioclesian the emperor made so many persecucucions
to christian men / that saint blase sought and would dwell in an hermytage in a
dyche / in which place the birds of heuene brought to him mete for to ete /
And it seemed to him that they came to serve him / and accompanye him / And would
not depart fro him till he had lift up his hand and blessed them / And also
sekemen came to him / And anon were cured and heled / Now it happed that the
prince of this region sent his knyghtis to hunte / And they could take no
thing but by aue^ture they came unto the deserte place where saint blase was /
where they found great multitude of beestes which were about him / Of whom
they could take none / whereof they were all abashed and showed this to their
lord / The which anon sent many knights for him / And coma^ded to bring him
and all the christian men with him / And that night Ih^u christ appiered to him
thryes / which said to him / Arise up and make to me sacrefise / Lo here ben
the knights that come to fetch the at commandment of the prince / And the
knights said to him / Come out fro this place / The president calls the /
And saint Blase answered my sons ye be well come / I see now well / that god has
not forgeten me / he went with them and contynuelly preached / And did many
miracles to fore them / There was a woman / that had a sone deyeng / in whose
throat was a bone of a fysshe thwart / which estrangled him / And she brought
him to fore his feet prayeng him that he would make her sone hoole / And saint
blase put his hand upon him and made his prayer to god / that this child and
all they that demanded benefettes of health in his name / that they should be
helped and opteyne it / And anon he was hool and guarysshed / Another woman
there was / that was pour which had a swyne / which the wulf had born away /
And she humbly prayed to saint blase / that she might have again her swyne / And
he began to smyle and said / good woman / Anger the not For thou shall have
again thy swyne And anon the wulf brought again to the woman which was a
wydowe her swyne / And anon after he was entr^d in to the cite / the prince
coma^d^d (...) put him in prison / And after another day he made him to come
to for him / whom he salewed by fair words saying to him / be thou Ioyefull
blase the friend of god / Saint blase answered to him / Be thou Joyous right
good prince / but call not them gods whom thou worshipest / but feendis /
For they ben delyuerd to fire perdurab^e with them that serve and worshype ^^em
/ Then was the prince much wroth / And made to beat saint blase with staves
and after to put him in prison / Then said saint blase / O mad man wenest
thou by thy torm^tis and pains to take away fro me the love of my god / whom
I have with me and is my helpar / And when this good wydowe which by saint
blase had recouerd her swyne herd hereof / she slew hit / and the heed and the
feet with a litil bread and a ca^dell she brought to saint blase / And he
thanketh god and ete thereof / and he said to her that every year she should
offer in his church a candell / And know thou / that to the and to all them /
that so shall do shall well happen to them / And so she did all her life / and
she had much great prosperyte / After this that the right cruel prince had
brought him to fore his gods / and in no wise might make him enclyne for to
adoure to their hoddes / he made him to be hanged on a gy^et / and his body to
be torn with combs of iron / And this don he was remysed again to prison / And
there were vij wymen that siewed him / which gadred up the dropes of his blood
/ which wymen anon were taken and constrained to sacrefye to their gods /
the which said / if thou wylt that we worship thy gods / and that we do
to them reverence send the^ to the water / for to wasshe and make clean their
vysages / to the end that we may more clenelyer worship them / Then the
prince was right glad and Joyous and anon sent them to the water / And the
wymen took them and threw them in the myddle of the stagne or ponde / And said
/ Now shall we see if they be gods / And when the prince herd this he was out
of his wit for anger / And smote him self all wroth saying wherefore retained
not ye our gods that they should not have thrown them in the bottom of the
watre / The mynystres answerden / thou spakest shrewdly to ye wymen / and they
cast them in to the water / to whom the wymen said / The very god may not
suffer iniquyte ne falsenes / for if they had been very gods / they had well
eschiewed that they had not be thrown there / and had seen what we would have
don / Then the tyrant bycam wroth / And did to make ready leed molten / and
iron combs / and vij cotes of iron brennyng as hot as fire on that one side /
And that other he did do bring smockes of lyne^ cloth and said to them that
they should chese which they would / And one of them that had ij small children
ran hardyly / and took the smockes of lynen cloth and threw them in the
fornays / for to goo after her self / if she had faylled / And the children
said to the mother / leave us not after the / but right sweet mother / like as
thou have nourisshid us with thy milk / so replenesshe us with the Royame of
heaven Then the tyrant did do hang them and with hokes and corchettis of
iron did do tere their flessh and all to rent it / of whom the flessh was as
white as snow / And for blood they gaf out milk / And as they suffered these
great tormentis / thangele of god descended fro heuene / and comforted them /
and said to them / have ye no dread / The werker is good that well begins and
well ends / and who deserves good reward shall have Joy / and for his work
complete / he shall have his merit / and for labor / he shall have rest / and
that shall be the reward Then the tyrant did do take them down / and did do
throw them in to the brennyg fornays / which wymen by the grace of god issued
without taking harm / And the fire was extynct and quenchyd / And the tyrau^t
said to them / Now leave ye your art of enchauntement and adoure ye our gods /
And they answered / do yt thou have bygonne / For we be now called to the
kingdom of heuene / Then he coma^ded that they should ben byheded And when
they should ben beheded / they began to adoure god knelyng on their knees saying
/ Lord god which have departed us fro derknesses / and in to this right sweet
light have brought us / and of us have made thy sacrefyse / receive our sowles
/ and make us to come to the lif perdurable / And thus had they their heedis
smeton of / and since their sowles went to heuene / After this the prince made
saint blase to be brought to fore him and said to him / have thou now
worshyppid our gods / or not / Saint blase answered Right cruel man I have no
dread of thy menaces / do what thou wylt / I deliver to the my body hoole /
Then he took him and did him to be cast in to a ponde / And anon he blessed
the water / And the water dreyde all away / and so he abode there sauf / and
then saint blase said to him / if your gods be very and true gods / late
them now show their virtue and might / and enter ye hither / Then there
entered in to it lxv persons / and anon they were drouned / And an angele
descended fro heuene / and said to saint blase / Blase goo out of this water /
and receive the crow-that is made ready of god for the / and when he was issued
out of the ponde the tyrant said to him / thou have determined in all manners
not for to adoure our gods / To whom saint blase said / Pour caytyf know
thou that I am servant of god / And I adoure not the feendes as ye do / And
ano^ then the tyrant did do smite of his heed / And saint blase prayed to
our lord to fore his death that who someuer desired his help fro thynfyrmyte of
the throat / or required aid for any other sekenes or Infirmyte / that he would
here him / and might deserve to be guarisshyd and heled / And there came a voys
fro heuene to him saying that his peticion was granted and should be done as he
had prayed / And so then with the two lytyl children he was byheded about the
year of our lord iijClxxxvij /

Here ends the life of saint Blase
Here follows the life of saint Agathe / and first thynterpretacion of her name
AGatha is said of agios / which is as much to say as holy / and theos that
is god / that is to say the sayncte of god / And as Crisostom^ says three
thyngis make a man holy / which three were parfyghtly in her / that is
clennesse of heart / the presence of the holy ghoost / and plente of good
manners / or she is said of a which is to say wit / and of geos / earth /
and of theos / god / as a goddess without earth that is without erthely love /
Or she is said of Ana / that is to say spekyng / and of than that is
perfection / that is that she was spekyng and accomplysshyng much parfyghtly /
and that appears well in her answers / Or she is said of gaath that is seruyse
/ and thaas souerayn / which is as souerayn seruyse / And by cause she said
that seruage is souerayn noblesse / Or she is said of ge that is solemn / and
of than that is perfection / For the perfection was right solemn / like as it
appyered by thangellis that buried her

Of saint Agathe
Saint Agathe the virgyne was right fair noble of body and of heart / and was
rich of goods / This glorious virgyne served god in the cite of Gathanence
ledyng a pure and holy life / Quyncyen the provost of Secyle being of a low
lygnage was lecherous / Auaricious and a mes^reaunt and paynem / And for
tacco^plysshe his evil desyris flesshly and to have richesses / did do take
saint Agathe to be presented and brought to fore him / And began to behold her
with a lecherous sight / And for to have her him self / he would have enduced
her to make sacrefyse unto the ydolles / And when he saw her ferme in her
purpoos / he put her in the keeping of a woman named affrodysse / which had ix
daughters over foul like unto the mother / This did he for to enduce saint
Agathe to do his wyll^ within xxx days / Affrodysse and her daughters
entreted the holy virgyne to consent to the will of the prouoste / And sometime
they made to her great promysses of temporell goods / and of great eases / And
sometime they made to her menaces of grievous torments / for to suffer and great
pains / to which saint Agathe answered freely / My courage and my thought ben so
fermly founded upon the ferme stone of Ihesu christ that for no pain it may not
be changed / your words ben but wind / your promesses ben but Rain / And
your menaces ben as ryuers that pass / And how well yt all these thyges hurtle
at foundement of my courage / yet for that it shall not moeue / In this manner
answered she / and alleway wept in making her prayers / and much great desire
had she to come to Ihesu christ by martirdom and by tormentis / when affrodysse
saw well / that in no wise she would be mo^uyd she went to the provost
quyncianus / and said to him Sonner should the stones wexe soft / and torn
iron to soft leed / than torn the courage of this maid / or to take fro her
the christian faith / I and my dought^es / have done none other thing night ne
day one after another / but to labor / how we might torn her heart to your
consentyng / I have promised her in your name / your precious aournementes /
clothes of gold / howses / lands / towns / servants / and great maynees /
And all this she despyseth / and reputeth them at no value / when quyncian herd
this / anon he made her to come to fore him in Judgment / And demanded her of
her lygnage / And at last he would constrayne her to make sacrefyse unto
thydolles / And saint Agathe answered that they were no gods / but were
deuylles that were in thydollys made of marble and of wood and ouergylte /
Qunncianus said chese one of two / or do sacrefyse to our gods / or thou
shall suffer pain and torments / Saint Aghate said / thou say that they be
gods / by cause thy wife was such one as was venus thy goddess / and thou thy
self as Jupiter / which was an homycide and evil / Quyncyanus said it
appyereth well that thou wylt suffer torments in that thou say to me vylonnye
/ Saint Agathe said I meruaylle much that one so wise a man / is such a fool
becomen / that thou say of them to be thy gods / whose life thou ne thy wife
will follow / if they be good I would that thy life were like unto theyres / And
if thou refusest their life / then art thou of one accord with me / Say
then that they be evil / and so foul / and forsake their living / and be
not of such life as thy gods were / Quyncianus said what ghost thou thus
vaynly spekyng / make sacrefyse / unto the gods / or if thou do not / I shall
make the to deye by diverse tormentis / Saint Aghate abode ferme and stable in
the faith / Theenne quyncianus did do put her in a derke prison / And she
went also gladly and with as good will as she had been prayed to goon to a
weddyng / On the morn quyncianus made her to be brought to fore him in Judgment
/ And said to her / Agathe how art thou aduysed for thy health / She answered
christ is mine health / Quyncianus said renye christ thy god / by which thou
may escape thy tormentis / Saint Agathe answered / Nay / but renye you thyn
ydolles which ben of stones and of wood / And adoure thy maker that made
heuene and earth / And if thou do not / thou shall be tormented in the
perpetuell fire in hell / Then in great ire quyncianus did her to be drawn
and stratched on a tree and tormented and said to her / Refuse thy vain opnyon
that thou have / and thou shall be eas^ed of thy pain / and she answered I have
as great dilection in these pains / as he that saw come to him that thing
which he most coueyteth to see / or as he that had found great tresour / And
like as the whete may not be put in the garner unto the time / yt the chaff be
beten of / in like wise my-sowle may not enter in to the Royame of heuene / but
if thou well tormente my body by thy mynystres / Then quyncianus did her to
be tormentid in her breasts and pappes / and commanded that her brestis and
mamellis should be drawn and cut of / when ye mynystres had accomplysshid his
commandment / Then saint Agathe said / Over felon and cruelle tyrant have
thou no shame to cut of that in a woman / wyche thou dydest souke in thy
mother / and whereof thou were nourisshyd / But I have my pappes hole in my soul
/ of which I nourisshe all my wits / the which I have ordained to serve our
lord Ihesu christ sith the beginning of my youghte / After quyncyanus did do
put her in prison / and commanded that none should enter for to hele her / ne
none should give to her mete ne drink / and when she was fast closed in the
prison / there came an ancient noble man and to fore him a child beryng a light
and diverse oynementis in his hand / This noble man said that he was a surgien
/ and in confortyng her said / how well that the tyrant has tormented the
bodyly / nevertheless thou have more tormented him in his heart by thy answers
/ I was there wha^ he made thy pappes to be cut of / And saw how I might
well hele them / Then said she / I knew never of medecyne corporal / And it
were shame to me to take it now / That which I have auowed and kept to my lord
since mine Infancye / yet I shall keep it if it plese him / Thauncyent noble man
answered / I am also cryste^ and a good maystre and leche / be not a shamed /
She answered / whereof should I be ashamed / thou art Ancient and of great age /
And how well that I be a young maid / Nevertheless my body is deffeted by the
torments / that the wounds suffer nothing to enter in to my thought whereof I
should be ashamed and not for that / I thank the fair fader that thou art so
dylygent to hele me / but know that my body shall receive no medecyne of noman
/ And this noble man said wherefore suffrest thou not me / that I may hele and
guarysshe the / She said by cause I have Ihesu crist my savior which with a
word heleth all / And if he will he may hele me And the good man smiling said
/ And he has sent me hither for to hele the / I am his Appostle / And know
verily that thou art hole in the name of him / And anon thappostle vanysshed
away / Then she fill down in prayers and said / Lord Ih^u christ I yield to
the tha^kyngis that thou have remembryd me / and have sent thyn appostle saint
peter to me which has comforted me and heled my wounds / And after thoryson
made / she saw that her pappes were again restored to her / and all her
wounds heled / And all that night was the prison fulfyllyd with great clerenes
and light / so that the kepers fled / for the great dread that they had / and
left the prison all open / Then said to her the other prisoners that were in
the prison / that she should goo their way / And she said that shall never
happen that the kepars of the prison shall suffer any harm for me / ne that I
shall lose my crown / I shall abide / in the faith of Ihesu christ / my lord
which has comforted and heled me / After four days quyncianus made her to
be brought to fore him in Judgment / and said to her that she should do
sacrefise to thydollis / She answered these words ben vayn / and thy
comandeme^tis evil they make the air to stynke / he is much meschaunt that
byleueth in a stone and without entendement / And leueth our lord the very god
that has heled me / and has restored to me again my pappes / Quincianus
demanded her / who is he that has heled the / She said Ihesu crist Quincianus
said / namest thou yet Ih^u christ / She answered I shall have in my heart Ihesu
christ as long as I shall live / Quincianus said / yet shall thou see if he may
help and hele the / And then he made her all naked to be rolled upon
brennyng brondes / And anon the ground where the holy vyrgyne was rolled on
began to tremble like an earth quaue / and a part of the wall fyl down upon
syluayn counseyllour of quyncianus and upon fastion his friend / by whose
counseyll she had be so tormented / And then all the cite of Cathanence was
abashed / And the people came rennyng unto the hows of Quincianus saying in a
great bruyt / that the cite was in a great paryll for the tormentis that he
did to saint Aghate / Quincianus redoubted the bruyte of the people / And
went* out by hynde and commanded that she should be remysed in prison / when she
came in to the prison / she Joined her hands holdyng them up to heuenward / and
said in prayeng / Lord god Ihesu christ which have created me of naught And
since my yougth have kept me / and have suffered me to live well in my yougth /
which have taken fro mine heart the love of the world / and have made me to
overcome the tormentis / and have lent me patience / among the pains / I pray
the that thou take my speryte / For it is time that thou make me to depart fro
this world / and to come to thy mercy / This ^ryson and prayer made she an hye
to fore many persons and anon after she gaaf up the ghoost and rendered her
soul / The year of our lord ijC and liij / in the time of decius the emperor of
Rome / After this the christian people took the body for to burye it worshipfully
/ And whylis they arrayed it with oynementis for tenbawme the corpse / Anon came
a young man clad in silk / and well an hundred that followed him richely clothed
/ which were never to fore seen in the cite / ne never after also / this young
man who^ followed the fair company set him on that one side of the tomb / in
which the body should be put / And when the body was enbamed within the tomb /
this young man set at head of the body a short table of marble stone / in
which was wryton this scripture / Mentem sanctam spontaneam honorem deo and
patrie liberacionem / which is as much to say / The holy saint Aghate had
alleway holy thought and pure And gaf honor to god with a free will / in all
her werkis / And pourchaced by her prayers peace and delyuerau^ce to all the
contreye / After that the table conteynyng this scripture was set at her head
/ the young man and all his company departed fro the tomb being closed without
appyeryng any more afterward / wherefore it is supposed that this young man was
her good angele / This was publysshyd ouerall / whereof the Jews and sarasyns
began to sing / and worship the sepulcre of the tomb of saint aghate /
Quincianus the provost deyde of an evil death / in the way as he went for to
seche the goods and Rychesses of saint Agathe / and also for to have taken her
parents / And never after / could be known where his body be came / And for to
preue that she had prayed for the sauacion of the c^ntrey / At the beginning
of feuerer the year after her martirdom / there aroos a great fire / and came fro
the montayne toward the cite of Cathanence / and burnt the earth and stones /
it was so fervent / Then ran the paynems to the sepulcre of saint agathe /
and took / the cloth that lay upon her tomb / and held it abroad against the
fire / And anon on the ix day after / which was the day of her feste ceased
the fire / as soon as it came to the cloth that they brought from her tomb /
showing that our lord kept the cite from the said fire by the merytes of saint
agathe / To whom pray we that she by her prayers may get and Impetre grace
of our lord to be kept from all parillis of fire in this world / And when we
shall depart hens / teschewe the perpetuell fire / and to come to the glory
and Joy in heuene amen /

Here ends the life and passion of saint Agathe
Of saint Amande and first thynterpretacion of his name
AMande is as much to say as amyalle / For he had in him three things / that
make a man amyable / The first is to be courtoys and gracious in company / As
salamon says in his proverbs the xix chapitre / Vir amabilis ad societatem /
The second is to be honest / in conversation / as it is said of hester / hester
secundo / Quod omnibus oculis amabilis videlatur / The third is to be vertuons
in faith of prowess as it is said in the book of paralipomenon / the second
chapter / Saul and Ionathas amabiles et decori /

Of the life of saint amande
Saint amand was born of noble fader and mother / On a time he entered in to a
monastery / And as he walked and went in the church he fond a great serpente
/ whom by the virtue of his prayer and with the sign of the cross he made him
to issue out / And to entree in to the great pytte out of which he never
issued after / And after saint amande came to the sepulcre of saint martyn / and
there abode xv year / where he lived with barle bread and water / and ware
alleway the hayer / After that / he went to rome And went in to the church
of saint peter / and abode there by night / the kepar of the church put him
out right rudely / And saint peter appyered to him as he lay and slepte to
fore the church door / And sent him in legacion in to france / where he
fond the king dagobert / the which he repreued strongly of his sins / The
king was angry and put him out of his Royame / After when the king had no
sone / he made his prayer to god that he might have one / And god sent him one
/ And when he was born / he thought much and sorowed who should baptize him /
And it came unto his mind that he would that saint Amande should baptyse him /
Saint ama^de was sought and brought to the king / and as soon as he was come the
king fyl down to his feet / and prayed him that he would pardone him of that he
had trespaced to him / And that he would baptyse his sone / And saint amande
granted benyngly to the king his request / the first peticion / but not the
second request / for he dredde that he would have desired about som^e wordly
occupacion or seculer thyngis / of which he would not gladly entremete / and
went his way and departed / but at last as vaynquysshyd by the prayers of
the king he granted him And thus then as he baptized the child / and noman
answered / the child with a clear voys said and answered Amen / And after this
the king prom^ted him to be bishop of sense / And ^^han he saw that the word
of god in predicacion was despised and not set by / he went in to Gascoygne
/ where he saw a Iogeler mocqued his words / The feend took him and with his
owen treth he tare him / and confessid that he had don Iniurye to the person
of god and anon deyd myserably / Now it happed on a time that he weesshe his
hands / and a bishop made the water to be kept / of which water a blind man
had his sight again / It happed that in that place by the will of the king he
would edeffye a monasterye / of monks / then a bishop that was of the next
cite took it grievously and was much angry therewith / and commanded his
servants to cast him out / or ellis they should slay him / And anon they came
to him and said to him in gyle and treson / that he should goo with them / and
they would show to him a place apt and good / and water enough / for to edyfye
upon a monastery for monks / And he that knew their malice and their evil
purpoos went with them unto the top of an hye mo^tayne where as they would
have slain him / And he desired much the martirdom for the love of our lord /
and for to come in to his company / but anon suddenly descended fro heaven such
a tempest of Rain and of orage that it couerd all the montayne / so much
that / that one could not see that other / and supposed to have deyde suddenly /
And they fyl down to therthe on their knees / praieng him to pardonne them /
And that they might depart thens alive / For whom he put him self to prayer
and anon the storm was appeasid and the wether fair / They went to their
place / And saint amande thus escaped fro this peril / And many other miracles
he shewde and did in thonour of our lord And fynysshyd in holy virtues his life
and departed out of this world in the time of heraclius the emperor abou the
year of our lord vjCliij

Here ends the life of saint Amande
Here next follows the life of saint Uedaste
Saint Uedaste was ordained bishop of arras by the hand of saint remyge / And
saint vedast was of much great holiness and clennesse For when he came to the
yate of Arras he fond there ij pour men of whom ye one was lame / and that
other blind These two pour men demanded of him som^e alms / And saint
vedast answered to them and said / I have neither gold ne silver / but this that
I have I give to you / Then he made them both hool by the virtue of his
prayer / It happed on a time he ca^ in to a church destroyed / and fond there
a wulf among the busshes / And he coma^ded him that he should goo his way / And
anon he obeyed to him and fled / so that since that time he was not seen /
At last when he had converted much people by his word and predicacion to the
faith of god / and also by good ensamples shewde euydently to the people / in
the fourtythe year of his bysshopryche / he saw a douue of fire that came fro
heaven to his hows / And by that he understood well / that he should fynysshe and
pass / out of this world / And so he did / For he deed anon after about the
year of our lord vCl / when his body should be translated / Saint omer which
was blind for age was sorry that he might not see the body of saint vedast and
anon our lord enlumyned him and rendryd to him his sight / And saw the body of
saint vedaste / but anon after / he was blind again as he had been to fore /
late us pray to him etc^ /

Thus ends the life of saint Uedaste
Here begins the lif of saint Ualentyne and first thynterpretacion of his
name
UAlentyne is as much to say as conteynyng valeur / that is perseueraunt in
great holiness valentyn is said also as a vayliaunt knight / For he was a
right noble knight of god / And the knight is said valiant that flees not /
and smyteth and defends valiantly / and ouercometh much puyssauntly / And so
saint valentyn wythdrewe him not fro his martirdom in fleyng / he smote in
dystroyng thydolles / he deffe^ded the faith he ouercam in suffryng /

Of saint Ualentyn the martre
Saint Ualentyne friend of our lord / and priest of great auctoryte was at Rome
/ It happed that Claudius the emperor made him to come to fore him / And said to
him in demandyng what thing is that / which I have herd of the valentyn / why
will thou not abide in our amyte / and worship thydolles and renounce the
vain opinion of thy creaunce / Sayyt valentyne answered him / if thou had
very knowleche of the grace of Ihesu christ / thou sholdest not say this that
thou say / but sholdest renye thydolles / and worship very god Then
said to saint valentyn a prince Then said to saint valentyn a prince which
was of the cou^ceylle of the emperor / what wylt thou say of our gods and of
their holy life / And saint valentyn answered / I say none other thing of them
but that they were men mortal and meschaunt / and full of all ordure and evil
/ Then said claudius the emperor / if Ihesu christ be god verily / wherefore
say not thou the truth / And saint valentyn said / Certainly Ihesu christ is
only very god / And if thou believe in him verily / the soul shall be saved /
thy Royame shall multyplye / and he shall give to the alleway vyctorye of thyn
enemies / Then claudius turned him unto all them that were there and said to
them / lords Romans / here ye how wisely and resonably this man speaks /
Anon the prouoste of the cite said / The Emperor is deceived and bytrayed / how
may we leave that / which we have holden and acostomed to hold since our
enfancie / with thyes words the emperor turned and changed his courage / And
saint valentyne was delyuerd in the keeping of of the prouoste / when saint
valentyn was brought in an hows in prison / Then he prayed to god saying /
lord Ihesu christ very god which art very light / enlumyne this house in such
wise / that they that dwell therein may know the to be very god / And the
provost said I meruaylle me / that thou say that thy god is very light / and
nevertheless if he may make my daughter to here and see / which long time has been blind / I shall do all that thou comandest me / and shall believe in thy god
/ Saint valentyn anon put him in prayers / And by his prayers the daughter of
the prouoste received again her sight / And anon all they of the hows were
converted / After the emperor did do smite of the heed of saint valentyn the
year of our lord ijClxxx / Then late us pray to saint valentyne / that he
get us pardon / of our sins / Amen

Thus ends the life of Saint Ualentyn
Here follows the life of saint Julian and first thynterpretacion of her name
IUliane is as much to say as brennyng plainly / for she burnt her self /
against the te^ptacio^ of the devil which would have deceived her And she helped
many other to believe in the faith of our lord Ihesu christ

Of saint Iuliane
Saint Iuliane was given in marriage to the prouoste of Nychomede which was
named Elongius / And he was a paynem / And therefore she would not assente to the
marriage ne assemble with him / but if he would first take the faith of christ and
be baptized / when her fader saw this Anon he did do her to be naked and
made her to be beten sore / And after delyuerd her to the provost / And after
when the prouoste held her / and saw the great beauty in her / he said to her
/ my most sweet Iulyane why have thou brought me in such confusion that I am
mocqued / by cause that thou refusest to take me / She said if thou wylt adoure
my god I shall assente and agree to take the / And otherwise shall thou never be
my lord / to whom the provost said Fair lady that may I not do / For
the emperor should then smite of my heed / And she said / if thou doubtest so
much the emperor which is mortal / why should not I doubt mine emperor Ilesu
christ which is inmortal do what thou wylt / For thou may not deceive me /
Then the prouoste did her to be beat / most cruelly with Rods / And half
adaye to hang by the heeris of her heed / and molten leed to be cast on her
heed And when he saw that all this grieved her not / he made her to be bounden
in chains / and to be set in prison / To whom the deuylle came then in the
lyknes of an Angele / which said to her in this manner / Iulyane I am the
angele of god which has sent me to the to warn and say that thou make
sacrefise to thydolles for teskape the tormentis of evil death / Then she
began to weep / And made to god this prayer / Lord god suffer not me to be
lost / but of thy grace show to me what he is that makes to me this monycion
/ The same time came to her a voys that said / that she should set hand on him
/ and that she constrayne him to confess what he was / And anon she took him /
and demanded him / And he said that he was the devil / And that his fader had
sent him theder for to deceive her / She demanded him who is thy fader / And
he answered beelzebub / which sends us for to do all evil / And makes us
grievously to be beten when we comen vaynquysshyd of the christian people / And
therefore I am certain I shall have much harm by cause I may not overcome the /
She said to him of what craft is thy fader beelzebub / the devil said / he
contryueth all evil and when we come in to hell / he sends us for to tempte
the sowles of the people / She demanded what tormentis suffers he / that
comes vaynquysshid of a christian creature / the devil said we suffer then
much grievous torment / And by cause when we be vaynquysshyd of a good man we
dar not return / and when we be sought and can not be founden / then
coma^deth our maystre to other deuylles that they tormente us where som^e ever
they find us / And t^erfore we must obey to him as to our fader / And of what
craft art thou / I take solace in the shrewdnes of the people / I love homycyde
luxurye / bataylle / and make debate and war / And she demanded him ghost
thou never to do good works and prouffytable / the devil answer / Madame to
the end that I answer the truth / To my right great harm and evil am I come
hither / For I had well supposed to have deceived the / and made the to make
sacrefise to thydolles / and to renounse thy god / when we come to a good
christian man / and we find him ready to do seruyse to god we send in him many
thoughts vain and evil / and also many evil desires / and torn his thought
by this that we set to fore him / and we send errors in his thougtes / And
we let him not persevere in his orysons ne in no good works / yet if we see
any that will goo to the church or in other place for any good anon we ben in
their ways and cast in their hertes diverse thoughts and occasions by which
they be dystorned for to do well / But who someuer may understand our
temptacions and apperteyne them / to the end that he put away fro him the evil
cogytacions and thoughts / and will make his prayers and do his good werkis /
and here the words of god and the dyuyne seruyse / Of him we be cast out / And
when they receive the body of Ihesu christ we depart forthwyth fro them / we
set our entente to nothing but to deceive good persons / that led an holy
life / and when we see them do good works / we send in them bitter and
grievous thoughts for to leave all / and do our will / Saint Iulyane said / O
thou esperyte how art thou so hardy to tempte any christian person / And the
devil answered / how dare thou thus hold me / if it were not thou affyest in
Ihesu christ / right so trust I in my fader / which is a malefactor / and I
do that plesith him / I have payned me to do often many euylles / And sometime I
come to mine entente and acco^plyssh my desire / but at this time I have failled
/ I would I had not comen hither / Alas how understood my fader / of this that
should not hap Madame late me goo and give me leave to goo in to som^e other
place / for it is no need that I accuse the to my fader / At last she let
him goo /

On the morn the provost coma^ded that saint Julian should be brought to fore
him in Judgment And when he saw her so well guarisshed and her vysage so fair /
and so shynyng / then said the prouoste to her Iulyane who has taught the
and how may thou vaynquyssh the tormentis / And she said herkene to me / and
I shall say to the My lord Ihesu christ has taught me to adoure the fader the
sone and the holy ghoost / For I have ouercomen and vaynquysshyd Sathanas thy
fader / and all his other deuyllis / For god has sent his Angel for to
conforte me and to help me / Meschaunt man know thou not / that the
tormentis ben made ready fore the everlasting / where thou shall be tormentid
perpetuelly in a perpetuel derkenes and obscurete / Anon the prouoste made to
be brought a whele of iron between two pylers and iiij horses to draw it forth
And four knights at one side and four knights on that other to draw and
four for to draw forth the whele so that all the body was tobroken / in
such wise that the mary came out of the bones / And the wheel was al blody /
Then came an angel of god and brake the wheel / and heled the wondes of saint
Iulyane and heled perfaytly / And for this miracle were conuertid all they
that were present / And anon after for the faith of Ihesu christ / were byheded
men and wymen to the nomof Cxxx persons / After commanded the provost / that
she should be put in a great pot full of boyllyng leed / And when she entryd in
to the said pot / All the leed bycam cold / so that she felt none harm /
And the prouoste cursid his gods / / by cause they might not punyssh a maid
that so vaynquysshyd them / And then he coma^ded to smite of her heed And
when she was led to be byheded the devil appyered to the prouoste in figure
of a young man and said / Spare not good people / and of her have no mercy / For
she has blamed your gods / And don much harm / And me she has beten this
night passed / Therefore render to her that she has deseruyd / With thyes
words saint Iuliane looked behind her for to wit who said such words of her
/ Anon the devil said / Alas / Alas Caytyf that I am I doubt me / that yet
she will take and bind me / And so he vanysshyd away / After this that she
had admonested the people to love and serve Ihesu christ / she prayed them all to
pray for her / And then her heed was smeton of / The prouoste entered in to a
ship with xxxiiij men for to pass an Arm of the sea / Anon came a great
orage and a tempest / which drowned the provost and all his company in the sea / And the sea threw their bodies to the Ryuage / And wild beestes came
thither and ete them / Thus this holy vygyne saint Iulane suffryd martirdom for
our lord the xiiij kalendes of the month of march / late us pray to her that
she pray for us etc^ /

Thus ends the life and passion of saint Julian virgyne
Of thee chayeryng of saint Peter thappostle
THe chayer is said in three manners / that is the chayer Ryall as it is said in
the book of kings / David sittyng in a chayer / And there is a chayer of
prestes as regum prymo / Hely the preeste syttyng upon a chayer / And the
third is the chayer for a Master / as is said / Mathei xxiij / upon the
chayer of moses et cetera / Then saint peter satte in a chayer ryall / For
he was prince of thappostles And he satte in the chayer of prestes / For he was
lord of all the prestes / And in the chayer of the maystre / For he was a
great doctor of christian men / The first was of equity / The second of
qua^tyte / And the third of truth and of virtue /

HOly church haloweth the feste of saint petre thappostle / and this day was
saint petre honorably enhau^ced in ye cite of anthioche / and set in the
chaier as a bishop / Many causes there ben / wherefore this feste is hallowed and
establysshyd / Of whom the first is as is said in a sermon of this feste / that
when saint peter went for to preche the word of god / and founded holy church
by his predycacion / Niceta and Aquila showed unto the cite of Anthioche / that
peter thappostle of god came theder / wherefore the people / And also the nobles
of the cite / came against him And knowleched them self culpable / of that they
had holden of the predicacion of Simon magus / which was an enchaunteur /
After they did to be brought to fore him all such people as were vexid with
diverse maladyes and sekenesses / of whom there were so many that they might
not be nombred / Saint peter beheld their repentance / And also that they
byleuyd fermly in the name of god / And anon lift up his hands unto heaven and
made his prayr to god saying / O god fader almighty I yield to the thankynges /
in this that thou have worthyly fulfyllyd the promesses of thy blessed sone by
which all creatures may know that thou art one only god in heaven and in
earth / And after he ascended up in to an hye place / And all the multitude of
sekemen were brought to fore him / And said to them in this manner / ye that
see me a mortal man as ye be / wene ne suppose not ye / that by me ye may be
heled / but by him that is descended fro heuene to therthe / which gives to
all them that believe in him full health of body and of soul / this ought ye
to believe / to the end that all may know that ye yt thus believe entierly with
all your heart in Ihesu christ may (...) made hool and guarisshid by him / and
anon all they yt were seek cried with an hie vois / we believe that Ih^u crist
is very god / suddenly a light appierid there / And all the seek people were
guarysshed and beled / of what someuer maladye they had / And that same day the
holy ghoost shewde so gretely his grace / that fro the least unto the most /
All byleued in our lord Ihesu christ / And there were baptized in vij days
more than ten thousand persons of men wymen and children / And also theophilus
the lord and provost of the cite / to whom saint peter had raised his sone /
which had been xiiij year deed / And som^e say that of his palace he made a
church / in the which all the people set up a chayer for saint peter to
sytte in more hyer for to preche the doctrine of Ihesu christ / and the better
to be herd and seen / And of thexaltyng thus of saint peter in to this chayer /
this feste takes the name of the chayeryng of saint peter / And in this
church was saint peter vij year And fro thens he went to Rome / and governed
the church of Rome xxv year / That other reason why this feste was
establysshed was for the reverence of the crown or tonsure on his heed /
which yet clerks bear and have / For like as som^e say / at this Iourneye
was first found the crown of the clerks / For when saint peter preached at
first time in the cite of anthioche / the paynems share him upon his heed above
like a fool in despysyng christian law / And by cause this was don to saint
Peter / For to do him despyte and shame / it was sith / stablysshyd that the
clergy should have his crown shaven / in sign of right great honor and
auctoryte / And it is to wete that in the crown ben three thyngis / First the
heed is dyscouerd and bare above / and the here cut away / And the crown is
round / There ben three resons why the heed is bare / of which saint denis
assygneth the tweyne / and says the rasure and cuttyng of / of the here
signefyeth pure life and clean without any arayeng without forth / For like as
heeris ben naturelly for to aourne the heed / right so dysforme they the heed
when they be cut of by mocquery or other wise / Also good manners which ought to
aourne the clean life / defforme the holy conversation when they ben left and
taken away by habites couoytous and proud / Also the rasure or shauyng which
is on the ouermest part of the heed / signefieth that between god and them /
ought be nethyng ne mean that should dysplese god / but their love should be in
god without any lettyng and enpesshement / And should adresse in hem their
thoughts / The second thing that is in the crown is that the heeris bey shave
clean away / by that is signefied that the clerks ought to take away fro their
hertes all vain thoughts / which might let and enpesshe the seruyse dyuyne
/ and also ought to be with drawn from all te^porall business / sauf only to
have their necessitees / The third thing that is in the crown / is that it is
r^unde / and this figure seems good by many resons / The first it that a
round figure has neither beginning ne end / The second is in a round crown
be^ no corners / And as saint bernard says where as ben corners / there is
gladly filth / and that is to be understand / that the clerks ought not to
have in their hertes no corners where ye filthe of sins might assemble / but
ought to have a clean conscience / And also they ought to have truth in their
mouths For as says saint Iherome / truth seeks no corners / The third
reason is For like as the figure of a crown / is most fair among all other /
So the conversation of clerks or prestes ought to be best aourned of good
manners among all other lay people / The fourth reason is / for like as a crown
has but one way round and no figure / like as saint Austyn says / there is
none so simple a figure as that which has but one way / Also the clerks
ought to be simple in their conversation with out fiction / and pride / And it
is to wite that holy church haloweth of saint peter iij festes in the year for
three yeftes / that he has power to give to the people / The first is the chayer
For he gives absolucion of sins / The second feste is called aduincula /
that is the first day of August / Fur he by his power transumeth the pain
perpetuell due for sins mortal in to pain temporell / The third feste is
of his martyrdom / For he has power to relece so^me pains of penance
enjoined for the sins confessyd / And for these three causes / he is dygne and
worthy honorably to be served and worshypped / Late us then pray to him /
that he may Impetre and get to us remyssyon of all our sins / and after
this short transitorye life we may come to everlasting Joy and glory in heaven
/

Amen
Thus ends the Chayeryng of saint Peter
Of saint Mathye thappostle / and first thynterpretacion of his name
MAthias in hebrewe is as much to say as given to our lord / or a gift of our
lord / or ellis humble or lityl / For he was given of our lord / when he was
chosen fro the world / and was set and entered among the lxxij dyscyples / he
was also given of our lord / when he was chosen by lotte and nombred among
thappostles / he was lityl / For he had all very mekenes / in him and humylite
There be iij manners of humylitees as saint Ambrose says that the first is of
the affliction by which aman is made humble / The second is consideracio^ of
of him self / and the third is of yt devotion which is of the knowleche of his
maker / Saint mathye had the first in suffryng martirdom / The second was in
despysyng him self / and he had the third in amerueyllyng the mageste of our
lord / For mathye is said / as doing good for evil / For he being good was
set in the place of Judas the traytre / And his life is read in holy church
and bid writes it as many holy men witness /

Of saint mathye
Saint mathye thappostle was in the place of Judas the traytre / And therefore
first we shall reherce here the birthe and beginning of Judas It is read in an
hystorye thaugh it it be named apocripha that there was a man in Iherusalem
named r^ben / and by another name Symeon of the kynred of david / or after
saint Iherome of the trybe of ysachar which had a wife named Ciborea / and on
the night that Judas was conceived his mother had a merueyllous dreme whereof she
was so sore aferd / For her seemed that she had conceived a child that should
destroy their people / and by cause of the loss of all their people / her
husbond blamed her much and said to her thou say a thing over euylle / or
the deuylles will deceive the / She said certainly if so be that I shall have a
sone / I trow it shall be so as I have had a reuelacion and none illusion /
when the child was born the fader and mother were in great doubt / and thought
what was best to do / For they durst not slay the child For thorrour that
they should have therein / neither they wist not how they might nourysshe one
that should destroy their lygnage / Then they put him to a lytyl fyscelle or
baskette well pytched and set it the in see And abandonned him to drive
whyther it would / And anon the floodes and wal^es of the sea brought and made
him aryue in an ylonde named Scaryoth / And of this name was he called Judas
Scaryoth / Now it happed that the queen of this contree went for to play on
the ryuage of the sea / And byheld this lytyl nacelle and the child / therein
which was fair / And then she syghed and said / O lord god how should I be
eased if I had such a child / Then at lest should not my Royame be
without heir / Then commanded she that the child should be taken up and be
nourysshid and she feigned her self to be great with child / And after
publysshyd that she had born a fair sone / when her husbond herd say hereof /
he had great Joy / and all the people of the contre made great feste / The
king and queen did do norysshe and keep this child like the sone of a king
/ Anon after it happed that the queen conceived a sone / And when it was born
and grown Judas beat often that child / For he wend that he had been his
brother and often he was chastysed therefore / but allewaye he made him to weep so
long that the queen / which knew well that Judas was not her sone / And at
last she said the truth / and told how that Judas was founden in the sea /
and yet this er was known Judas slew the child that he had supposed to be
his brother and was sone to the king / And in eschewyng the sentence of death /
he fled anon and came in to Iherusalem / And entered in to the court of pylate
which tho was prouoste / And he so plesid him that he was great with him and
had in great chyerete / and nothing was done without him / Now it happed on a
day that pylate went for to dysporte him by a gardyn / bylongyng to the fader
of Judas / And was so desirous to ete of the fruit of thapp^lles that he might
not forbere them / And the fader of Judas knew not Judas his sone / For he had
supposed that he had be drowned in the sea long to fore ne the sone knew not
the fader / when pylate had told to Judas of his desire he sprange in to the
gardyn of his fader / and gadred of the fruit for to bear ^o his maystre / but
the fader of Judas deffended him / And there bygan between them much stryf and
debate first by words / and after with fyghtyng so much that Judas smote his
fader with a stone on the heed / that he slew him / And after brought thapples
unto pylate / And told to him how that he had slain him that ought the gardyn
/ Then sent pylate to sease all the good that the fader of Judas had / And
after gaf his wife to Judas in marriage / And thus Judas wedded his owen mother /
Now it happed on a day that the lady wept and sighed much strongly and said /
alas how unhappy that I am / I have lost my sone and my husbond / My sone was
leyd on the sea and I suppose that he be drowned and my husbond is deed
suddenly / And yet it is more grievous to me that pylate has remaryed me against
my will Then demanded Judas of this child And she told him how he was set
in the sea / And Judas told to her how he had be fou^den in the sea / in such
wise yt she wist that she was his mother / and that he had slain his fader / and
wedded his mother / wherefore then he went to Ihesu christ which did so many
miracles / and prayed him of mercy and forgifnes of his sins / Thus fer it is
red in thistorye which is not autentike / Our lord made Judas one of his
appostles and retained him in his company / and was so pryue with him / that
he was made his procuratour and bare the purse for all the other / and stale of
that which was given to christ / Then it happed that he was sorry and angry /
for thoygne me^t that Marye magdalene poured on the heed and feet of our lord
Ihesu crist and said that it was worth CCC pens and said that so much he had
lost / And therefore sold he Ihesu christ for xxx pens of ye money usual / of
which every penny was worth x pens / And so he recouuerd CCC pens / Or after
that som^e say / that he ought to have of all the yeftes that was given to
Ihesu christ the tenthe penny / And so he recouerd xxx pens of that he sold him
And neuerthheles at lest he brought them again to the temple and after henge
him self in despayr / And his body opened and clefte a sonder / and his
bowellis fylle out / And so it apperteyned well that it should so be / for ye
mouth which god had kyssyd ought not to be defouled in touching / and also he
ought not to dye on the earth / by cause all erthely creatures ought to hate
him / but in the air where deuyllys and wicked spyrites ^ee / by cause he had
deseruyd to be in their company / Then when the time came between thascencion
/ and wythsontyde saint peter byheld that the nombre of thappostles was
menusshyd / he aroos up in the myddle of the dyscyples / and said fair brethern
/ ye know how our lord Ihesu christ had chosen xij men for to bear witness
of his resurrection / And Judas was goon the evil way / It behooves
taccomplysshe the nombre of xij / of such as has been with him / And since they
chosen two of them that were there / that one was named Joseph surnamed Iustus
/ and that other was mathye / And then they made their orysons and said /
lord god which know the hertes of all the persons / Show to us whom we
shall chese of thyes tweyne here / And after they cast lottes / and the lotte
fylle on mathye / which forth with was enombred with the other xj / And then
were they xij / But the holy saint denis says that the lotte was a Raye and a
shynyng which came and shone upon him / And anon he bygan to preche / and had
his predycacion about Iherusalem / And was much virtuous and did many
miracles as is wreton of him of whom the legende follows / which legende is
found at Tryre in Almayne /

Saint mathye which was set in the place of Judas / was born in bethleem of
the trybe of Judah / he was set to scole and in a lytyl time he learned all the
science of the law and of the prophets / he was a ferd of flesshly lusts /
And he passyd his yongthe in good manners / his courage was enclyned to all
virtues / For he was humble and debonayr / and allewaye ready unto do mercy /
And was not proud in prosperity / ne fraylle in aduersytee / he did that /
which he prechid he made the blind to see and heled the seek men / he raised
the deed men / and did great miracles in the name of Ihesu christ / And when
he was accused hereof to fore the bishop of Iherusalem / it was demanded him
that he should answer thereto / And he said / It behooves not much tanswere
herto / by cause for to be a christian man it is nothing crymynel / but it is a
glorious life Then said the bishop that he would spare him and give him
respyte to repent him / And saint Mathye answered god forbede that I should
repent of the truth that I have truly founden and become an apostate /

He was ferme in the love of god and clean of his body / and wise in spekyng to
all the questions of scripture / And when he preached the word of god / many
byleuyd in Ihesu christ by his predicacion / The Jews took him And brougt him
to Justice / and had gotten two false witnesses against him and for taccuse him /
the which cast on him first stones / and the other after / and so was stoned
/ And he prayed that the stones might be buried that the false wytnessys had
cast upon him / For to bear witness again the^ that stoned him / And fynably
he was slain with an axe after the manner of the Romans / And he held up his
hands / and commanded his esperyte to god / And after is is said that his body
was brought to Rome / And fro rome it was translated unto t^yre Another legende
says that his hody lies at Rome / and buried under a stone of pourphyrye in
the church of saint marye the mayor /

Of saint Gregorye the pope
GRegorye is said of grex which is to say a flock / and of gere which is to
say a prechour / Then Gregorye is to say as a prechour / to an assemble or
flock of people / or it is said as a noble doctor / or prechour / Or gregorye
is to say in our langage as awaked / For the awoke to him self to god / and to
the people / he awoke to him self by keeping of clennesse / to god by good
contemplacion / And to the people by contynuel predycacion / And by this is
deserved the vision of god / And saint Austyn says in the book of order / that
he sees god / that well lives / well studyeth and well prays / And poul
thystoryograph of the lombardes writes his hystorye and life of him / the
which Ioh^n the dekene afterward much dylygently compyled and ordained /

Saint Gregorye was born of the parentele of senatoures of Rome whose fader was
named Gordyane / and his mother siluia / And when he had so much learned that he
was a maystre / in phylosophye and also was rich of patrymonye / he thought
that he would leave all the rychesses that he had and would enter in to religyon
for to serve god / but in this that he put this thought in respyte / he
conseyued another purpoos / that was that him seemed he should better serve god
in a seculer habyte / in dooyng thoffyce of the pretorye of the provost of R^me
/ For to give to each man duly reason after the right of his cause / but he
fond in this office so great seculer business / that it began to dysplese him
/ by cause by this great business / he wythdrewe him over for fro god / In
this mean while his fader and mother deyden / in such wise that he was rich of
patrymonye and puyssaunt / that at beginning he founded and endowed with
rentes vj abbeyes in zecylle / And the seventh he founded within the walls of
Rome / in thonour of saint Andrew thappostle / in the which he becam a monk /
And the remanaunt of his patrymonye he gaf for gods sake / So that he that to
fore went clothed in clothes of gold and of silk / and aourned with precious
stones in the cite / when he was monk served in a pour habyte the monks /
There was at beginning of his conversation / of so parfayt a life / that it
might be said well that he was all parfayt / he made great abstynences in etyng
/ in drynkyng / in wakyng / and in prayeng in so much / that he was so
trauaylled that uneath he might sustain him self / he had put out of his
heart all seculier things / so that his conversation was in heaven / For he
had adressid all his desire for to come to the Joy permanable / On a time it
happed that saint gregorye in his selle of the same abbaye / where as he was
abbote wrote sum thing / And an Angele appeared to him in semblaunce of a
maronner which seemed as he had escaped fro the tempest of the sea / And prayed
him weeping to have pity on him Then saint gregorye commanded that there should
be given to him vj pens / And then he departed / The same day the angele came
agyan in like wise as he did to fore / And said that he had lost all his good
and prayed him that he would yet help him / on who^ saint gregorye had yet pity
/ and did do be given to him vj pens more / yet at third time he came and
made great cry and wept / and prayed him that he would yet help him to ward
his great loss / so that saint gregorye commanded his prouoste that he should
yet give to this pour man an alms / And the prouoste said / that there was
no more silver in all thabbaye but a disshe of silver in which his mother was
wont to send him potage / And saint gregorye commanded anon that / that dysshe
of silver should be given to him / And the angele took it with great Joy / And
lytyl while after this angele appyeryd to saint gregorye and said to him that
god has sent him so to him / It happed afterward that as saint gregory passed
through the market of Rome / and saw there two fair children whyt and rody of
vysage / and fair yelow here / which were for to selle And saint gregory
demanded fro whens they were / And the merchant answered of england / After
saint gregory demanded if they were christian and he answered nay / but that they
were paynems / Then sight saint gregorye and said Alas / what fair people has
the devil in his doctrine and in his domynacion / After he demanded how these
people were called / he answered that they were called englyssh men / then he
said they may well be so called / for they have the vysage of angels / And
for that saint gregory went to the pope / And by great prayers he Impetred and
had grant that he was sent in to england for to convert the people of the
same contre / but wha^ the Romans herd say that gregorye was sent in to
england / Anon they went to the pope and said to him / Thou have angered saint
peter / thou have destroyed al Rome / And hurt all holy church / in this that
thou have let gregorye goon out of Rome / Of which word the pope was angry
and much abashed / And sent anon his messagers after saint gregory / And
commanded him to return / and come again to Rome / which then was goon on
his Journey / three days / and for his noble and good renomee the pope made him
cardynal deken / After for the corrupcion of thayer the pope pelagius deyed /
And then saint gregorye was elect / of all the paple to be pope / but he
refused it and said / that to that dygnyte he was not worthy / And for the
right great mortalyte er that he was sacred pope he made to the people a sermon
and said / Right dear brethern well ought we to have doubt of the scorge of god
er that we feel it / And yet we ought to fere it and to torn and forsake our
sins / loo ye may behold the people deye er they bywepe their sins / Thynk
ye then in what point he comes in the presence of the Judge / that has had
no time to bewaylle his sins / The howses ben void / the children deye in
the presence of fader and mother suddenly so that they have lytyl time to deye /
where fore every man amend his life / whylis he has time for to repent him of
his evil deeds and sins / er that the Judge call him / fro the mortal body /
he says by the prophet / I will not the death of a synnar / but I will that he
return and live / much soon the Judge hereth the synnar when he conuerteth
fro his sins and amendeth his life / By such manner admonested he to the
people their health / And he or deyned to make processyon in all the chyrches
much solempnly for to impetre and get mercy for this mortalyte / when the
processyon was done / he would have goon pryuely out of Rome for thescewe
thoffyce of the papalyte / but against that / the gates were kept so that he
might not issue / At last he did do change his habyte / And so much did
with the marchaunts / that they brought him out of Rome in a tonne upon a carte
/ And when he was far out of the town / he issued out of the tonne / and
hid him in a dyche / And when he had been therein iij days the people of Rome
sought him all about / Anon they saw a pyler shynyng descend fro heaven
strayt upon the dyche / in which saint gregorye was / And a recluse an holy
man saw that by that pyler angellis descended fro heaven to saint gregory / and
after went up again / Anon then saint gregory was taken of the people / and
after thordynaunce of holy church he was ordained and sacred pope against his
will / For he was much debonayr / humble and mercyful to rich and pour and
to great and small / well may he apperceyue / that redeth his wrytynges / how
often he complained of this great charge that he was charged with all / to
which he said he was not worthy thereto / and also he might not here that any
should preyse him ne in lettres ne in words / And alleway he was in great
humylite / and acounted him self more meke and low after that he was pope than
to fore in so much that he was the first of the popes that wrote seruus
seruorum dei / that is servant of the seruantis of god he had great cure and
was besy to convert synnars / he made and compyled many fair books / of
which the church is greatly enlumyned / he was never idle / how well that he
was alleway seek / he conuerteth the englisshe people to the christian faith by
three holy men and good clerkys that he sent thither / that is to wit Augustyn
/ mellitus / and Ioh^n / for to preche the faith / And by cause the mortalyte
cessyd not he ordained a procession / in the which he did do bear an image of
our lady / which as is said saint luke the euangelyste made / which was a good
payntour / he had coruen it and painted after the likeness of the gloryouse
virgyne marye And anon the mortalyte cessed / and thayer becam pure and clear /
And about thymage was herd a voys of angellis that songen this Antheme regina
celi letare etc^ / And saint gregory put thereto / Ora pro nobis deum alleluya /
At the same time saint gregory saw an angele upon a Castelle / which made
clean a swerd all blody and put it in to the shethe / And thereby saint gregory
understood that the pestylence of this mortalite was passed / and after that /
it was called the castle Angel / Saint gregory did every day so great
alms / that many in the contre about were nourisshid by him / whom he had
by name wreton / And also the monks that dwelled in the mount Synay had of him
their sustenaunce / Emonge all other almesses that he did / he governed three
thousand virgyns / to whom he sent every year four score pound of gold / and
also he founded to them an abbeye in Iherusalem / And sent to them that therein
were such thing as they lacked / Every day had he pour men to dinner / On a
time it happed that he took the lauour for to give water to a pilgrim for to
wasshe his hondes by great humylite / and anon the pilgrim vanysshyd a way /
whereof saint gregory had merueylle / The night after our lord appiered in a
vysion and said to him / The other days thou have received me in my members /
but yesterday thou receyuedest me in my person / Another day saint gregory
commanded to his dyspenser that he should bring to dinner xij pour men / And
when saint gregory and the pour men were set at mete / he told at table
syttyng xiij pour pylgryms / And demanded of his dyspenser why he had don
above his commandment / to bring in moo than xij persons / And anon the
dyspenser all abashed went and told the pour men and fond but xij / and
said to saint gregory / holy fader there be no moo but xij / and so many shall ye
find and nomoo / Then considerid saint gregorye that one of the pylgryms that
set next to him often changed his vysage / For often he seemed young / and after
old / And after dinner saint gregory took him by the hand and brought him in to
his chamber / and prayed him that he would tell him his name / And he answered
wherefore dema^dest thou my name which is merueyllous / nevertheless know thou
well that I am the same pour maronner / to whom thou gave the dyssh^ of
silver in which thy mother was wont to sent the potage / And know for certain
that since that day / that thou dydyst to me that alms / god has destyned
the / to be pope / And said more over / I am thangelle of god / and he has
sent me hither to the to be thy deffendour / and procurour / of that which
thou would demand and Impetre of him / And after this the angele vanysshed
away / And in that time there was an heremyte an holy man which had left and
forsaken all the goods of the world for gods sake / and had retained nothing
but a catte / with which he playde often / and held it in his lap
delyciously / On a day it happed that he prayed god devoutly that he would wouch^
sauf to show to him to what saint he should be in like Joy in heaven / by cause
for his love he had left all the world and renounced / upon this god showed him
in a vysion that saint gregory and he should have like Joy in heuene / And when
he under stood this he syghed sore / and preysid lytyl his pouerte which he
had long suffered and born / if he should have like merit which habounded so
greatly in seculer Richesse / upon this there came a voys to him which said /
that the possession of richesse makes not a man in this world rich / but the
ardour of couetyse / Then be stille thou / dare thou compare thy pouerte to
the richesse of saint gregory / which love more thy catte with whom thou
cessest not to stroke and play / than saint gregory does all his richesses /
for he seesseth never to give alms for gods sake / Then theremyte
thanked almighty god and prayed that he might have his merit and reward with
saint gregory in the glory of peradys / On a day it happed that saint gregory
sange mass in the church of saint Marye Mayor / And when he had said / Pax
dominj sit semper vobiscum / Anon thangele said / Et cum spiritu tuo / and fro
than forthon the pope ordained a stacion in that church every year on ester
day / And when then he said in his mass / Pax dominj etc^ / none shall
answer in remembrance of this miracle / In the time that Traian the emperor
reigned / and one as a time he went toward abatayll out of Rome / it happed
that in his way as he should ride a woman a wydowe came to him weeping and said /
I pray the sire that thou aue^ge the death of one my sone / which Innocently
and without cause has be slain / The Emperor answered / if I come again fro the
bataylle hool and sound / then I shall do Justice for the death of thy sone /
Then said the wydowe / Sire / and if thou deye in the bataylle / who shall
then avenge his death / And the emperor said / he that shall come after me /
And the wydowe said / is it not better that thou do to me Justice / and have
the merit thereof of god / than another have it for the / Then had traian
pity / and descended fro his horse / and did Justice in auengyng the death of
her sone / On a time saint gregory went by the market of Rome / which is
called the market of traian / And thene he remembered of the Justice and other
good deeds of traian / and how he had been pyteous and debonayr / and was much
sorrowful that he had been a paynem / And he turned to the church of saint peter
wayllyng for thorrour of the mescreaunce of traian / Then answered a voys fro
god / saying I have now herd thy prayer / and have spared traian fro the pain
perpetuell / By this thus as som^e say / the pain perpetuel due to traian as
a mescreaunt was somdele take away / but for all that was not he quyte fro the
prison of hell / For the soul may well be in hell / and feel there no pain by
the mercy of god / And after it is said that the angele in his answer said
more to thus / by cause thou have prayed for a payneme / god grants the to
chese of ij things that one which thou wylt / Or thou shall be ij days in
purgatory in pain / or ellis all the days of thy life thou shall languysshe
in sickness / Then answered saint gregory / that he had lever to have
sickness all his life in this world / than to feel by ij days the pains of
purgatory / And ever after he had contynuelly the feures or axces / or the
gout in his feet / And hereof him self makes mention in one his epistle and
says / I am so much tormented of the gowte in my feet and of other sekenesses
/ that my lif is to me a great pain every day me seems that I ought to deye /
And alleway I abide the death / Som^e time my pain is lityl / and sometime right
great / but it is not so lityl / that it departs fro me / ne so great yt it
brings me to death / And thus it is that I that am alleway ready to deye / am
withdrawn fro death / It happed that a wydowe that was wont every sunday to
bring hoostes to sing mass with / should on a time be houselyd and co^muned /
And when saint gregory should give to her the holy sacrament / in saying /
Corpus dominj nostrj etc^ / that is to say / the body of our lord Ih^u christ /
keep the in to everlasting life / Anon this woman began to smyle to fore saint
gregorye / And anon he wythdrewe his hand / and remysed the sacrament upon
thaulter / And he demanded her to fore the people why she smyled / And she said
by cause yt the bread that I have made with my propre hands / thou namest it
the body of our lord Ihesu christ / Anon saint gregory put him self to prayer
with the people / For to pray to god that herupo^ he would show his grace for
to conferme our believe / And when they were risen fro prayer / saint gregorye
saw the holy sacrament in figure of a pyece of fhessh as great as the lytil
finger of an hand / And anon after by the prayers of saint gregorye / the
flesh of the sacrament turned in to semblau^ce of breed / as it had be to
fore / And therwyth he comuned and howseled the woman / which after was more
relygyous and the people more ferme in the faith / Saint gregorye made and
ordained the song of thoffyce of holy church / and establysshed at Rome two
scoles of song / that one beside the church of saint peter / And that other
by the church of saint Ioh^n latian / where the place is yet where he lay and
taught the scoliers / and the rod with which he menaced them / And the
anthyphoner / on which he learned them is yet there / he put to the canon of
the mass thse words / Diesque nostros in tua pace disponamus / atque ab
eterna dampnacione nos eripias / et in electorum tuorum iubeas grege numerari /
At last when saint gregory had been pope xiij year / vj monethis / and x
days / he being full of good works departed out of this world in the year of
our lord vjCvj year in the time when foca was Emperor of rome / Let us then
pray to saint gregory / that he get us grace that we may amend so our self
here in this lif that we may come unto everlasting life in heaven / Amen

Thus ends the life of saint Gregorye
Here begins of saint longius the life
LOngius which was a puyssau^t knight was with other knights by the
commandment of pylate on the side of the cross of our lord and percyd the side
of our lord with a spear / And when he saw the miracles / how the son lost
his light / and great erthequauyng of therthe was / when our lord suffered death
and passion in the tree of the cross / Then byleued he in Ihesu christ / Som^e
say that when he smote our lord with the spear in the side / the precious
blood aualed by the shafte of the spear upon his hondes / And of adventure with
his hondes he touched his eyes / And anon he that had be to fore blind saw
anon clerly / wherefore he refused all cheualrye / and abode with thappostles /
of whom he was taught and crystened and after he abandonned to lead an holy life
/ in doing almesses and in keeping the life of a monk / about xxxviij year in
cesaree and in Capadoce / And by his words and his example / many men
converted he to the faith of christ / And when this came to the knowleche of
octouian the prouoste / he took him and would have constrained him to do
sacrefise to thydollis / And saint longius said / There may noman serve two
lords which ben contrary to other / Thyn ydollis ben lords of thy malices /
corruptours of all good werkis and enemies to chastyte / humylite and to bounte
/ And friends to all ordure of luxurye / of gloutonnye / of ydelnesse / of
pride / and of Auaryce / And my lord is lord of sobrenesse that brings the
people to the everlasting life / Then said the prouoste / it is naught yt thou
say / Make sacrefice to thydollis And thy god shall forgive the by cause of
the commandment that is made to the / longius said if thou wylt become^ christian
/ god shall pardonne the thy trespaces / Then the provost was angry and made
the teeth of saint longius to be drawn out of his mouth / and did do cut
his mouth open / And yet for all that longius lost not his speech / but took
an axe that he there fond and hew and brake therewith thydollis and said / now
may we see if they be very gods or not / And anon the deuyllis issued out and
entered in to the body of the prouoste / amd his felaws / And they brayed like
beestes / and fill down to the feet of saint longius / and said we know well
that thou art servant unto the souerayn god / And saint longius demanded of
the deuylles why they dwelled in these ydollis / and they answered / we have
fou^den place / in these ydolles for us / For ouerall where Ihesu crist is not
named ne his sign is not showed / there dwell we gladly / and by cause when
these paynems come to these ydolles for to adoure and make sacrefise in the
name of us / then we come and dwell in thyes ydolles / wherefore we pray the
man of god that thou send us not in in thabysme of hell / And saint longius
said to the people that there were / what say ye will ye have these deuylles
for your gods and worship them / Or have ye lever that I hunte them out of
this world in the name of Ihesu christ / And the people said with an hye voys /
Much great is the god of christian people / holy man we pray the that thou
suffer not the deuylles to dwell in this cite / Then commanded saint longius
to the deuyllis that they should issue out of this people in such wise that the
people had great Joy / and byleued in our lord / A lytyl time after / the evil
provost made saint longius come to fore him / and said to him that all the
people were departed and by his enchau^tement had refused thydollis / if the
king knew it / he should destroy us and the cite also / Afrodisius answered /
how will thou yet torm^^ this good man which has saved us and has don so
much good to the cite And the provost said / he has deceived us by enchantrye
/ Afrodisius said his god is great / and has none evil in him / Then did
the provost cut out the tongue of afrodisius / wherefore saint longius sighed
unto god / And anon the prouoste becam blind / and lost all his members /
when afrodifius saw that / he said / lord god thou art Just / And thy
Judgment is verytable / And the provost said to afrodisius / Fair brother pray
to saint longius that he pray for me / For I have don ill to him / And
Afrodisius said / have not I well told it to the / do no more so to longius /
See not thou me speak without tongue / And the prouoste said / I have not
only l^st mine eyes / but also my heart and my body is in great pain / And
saint longius said / if thou wylt be hool and guarysshed / put me appertly to
death / And I shall pray for the to our lord after that I shall be deed that he
hele yt And anon then the provost did do smite of his heed / And after he
came and fill on the body of saint longius and said all in weeping / Sire I have
sinned I knowleche and confess my fylthe / And anon came again his sight and he
received health of his body / And buried honorably the body of saint longius /
And the prouoste byleuyd in Ihesu christ / And abode in the company of christian
men and thanked god and deyde in good astate / All this happed in Cesaree of
Capadoce to the honor of our lord god / to whom be given laud and glory in
secula seculorum

Thus ends the life of saint Longius
Here begins the lif of saint Maure
THe year that saint benet deied / he sent saint Maure / and four felaws with
him in to france / that is to wete fuscinien symplicien Antoninien and
constantinen at prayer of varricam the bishop of maulx for to found an
abbaye which the said bishop would make of his owen good / And gaf to saint
maure a book in which he had wreton the rule of his hand / And as they passed
the montaynes of mongus sourgus one of their servants fill fro his horse upon a
great stone / and his lift foot was all to frusshed / but as soon as saint maure
had blessed it and made his oryson / he was guarisshed and al hool / After this
he came in to the church of saint mauryce / And there was at enter a blind man
beggyng that had seten there xj year and was named lieuyn / which for the
long usage that he had been there / he knew all thoffice of the church by
heryng that he had learned there by without more / he coniured saint maure by the
virtue of the martirs that he would help him / And anon he was guarisshid and
had again his sight by his prayer / And then saint maure coma^ded him that he
should serve all his life in the church as he had don / On a night this holy
man and his felawe herberowed in ye hows of a wydowe / which was named themere
/ the which had a sone that was so seek that each man said that he was deed /
And this holy man heled him / And when he was hool he said to saint maure /
thou art he / that by thy merytes and by thy teeres have delyuerd me fro the
Judgment where I was in condemned to the fire of hell / Thus as they held
their way on the good friday in thabbaye of which saint Romayn was abbot /
And saint maure said to saint Romayn Saint benet shall depart out of this world
to morrow / On the morn after the hour of tierce as saint maure was in his
prayers he saw the way by which saint benet mounted in to heaven / and he was
aourned with palles and great foyson of clerenes / and this vision saw two
other monks / Also when saint maure and his fellow came to orlyance / they herd
say that the bishop varicam of maulx was deed / And he that was in his place
would not receive them / Then saint maure and his felawe went in to a place
that is called restis / And there founded ^e first an hows for to adoure god
there in thonour of saint martyn / and coma^ded that he should be buried therein
A clerk that was there named langyso fyl down of an hie steyer upon an hepe of
stones / and was all to frusshed but saint maure heled him anon / And after
flocus which was one of the grettest friends of the king had him in so great
reverence / that he durst not approuche / but if he bad him / Three werkmen that
wrought in that hows bygan to say shrewdly of saint maure / and say that he
coueyted over much vain glory / but anon they be came so mad that that one
of him lost forthwyth his life / And the other ij to tare them self with their
teeth / the holy man anon put his hand in their mouths / and made the feende
to goo out benethe / And after he raised the third to life which had be deed /
and commanded him if he would live / that he should no more enter in to that hows /
And this coma^ded he for theschewe the favor of the world / Theodebers king of
frannce came for to visit him / and prayed to saint maure and the brethern that
they would pray for him / And he gaf to them of that hows the fee Ryall of that
buscage / and all the rentes thereto belongyng / and the towns / On the morn
saint maure went to see the yeft that the king had given / And there he heled
one having the paleseye / which had be vij year seek / The second year that
this hows was founded came many noble men of the contre which demanded that
their children might be clothed and received in to the religion And there came so
many that the xxvj year of the fondacion of thabbaye there were an hundred and
forty brethern / and saint maure comandeth that they should abide in that
nombre without more or less / and not tencreace ne mynuysshe that nombre /
After this ^lotaire the king came in to this abbeye / And gaf thereto the chyef
of blason and the town longchamp therewith / And after this time saint maure
would no more issue out of thabbeye / but he went and abode in a side of the
church of saint martyn where he had made an house for him / and had with him
two monks for to serve him / but he ordained to fore / that bercuses should be
abbot after him / when he had been in hows that ij year and an half / the devil
appiered to him on a time / which was in his orysons / and said to him that
there should be great destruction of his brethern / but the angele of our lord
came after him which reconforted him And then he came unto the brethern and
said to them that he and many of them therwithin / should pass out of this
world / And it happed that with in a month after there deyed C and xvj monks
of that abbeye / And of all the no^bre there abode nomoo alive but xxiiij / And
then deyde Anthonyn and constantin that were comen with him / A lytyl while
after deyde saint maure of the pain of his side the xlj year after he was
comen theder the xviij kalendes of feuerer / And he deyde to fore thaulter of
saint Martyn where he was couerd with an heyr / The other of his felawshyp
returned to mount cassyn / And thus accomplysshyd this blessed saint his life in
the time of lowys thempereur the second / And the body of saint maure was born
fro thabbaye in Angeo named gaunefuelle for fere of the normans unto the abbaye
of fosses / where his body is now / which Abbaye founded saint banolanis
disciple to saint collon bain / his feste is the xv day of Ianyuer

Here ends the life of saint Maure
Here follows the life of saint Patryke and thynterpretacion of his name
PAtryke is as much to say as knowleche / For by the will of god he knew
many of the secrets of heaven and of the Joys there / And also he saw a
party of the pains of hell /

Of Saint Patryke
Saint Patryke was born in brytayne which is called England / And was learned
at Rome and there flourid in virtues / And after departed out of the parties
of ytalye where he had long dwelled and came home in to his coutre in walis
named pendyac / And entered in to a fair and Joyous contre called the valeye
Rosyne / To whom thangele of god appiered and said / O patryke this see ne
bysshopriche god has not provided to the but unto one not yet born / but shall
xxx year here after be born / And so he left that contre and Saylled over in to
yrlonde / And as chester says in polycronycon the fourth book the xxix
chapter that saint patryke fader was named caprum which was a priest and a
dekens sone which was called fodum And saint patrykes mother was named conches
martyns suster of france / in his baptesme he was named Sucate / and saint
germayn callid him magonius / and celestinus the pope named him patryke / that
is as much to say as fader of the cytezeyns / Sanyt patryke on a day as he
preached a sermon of the patience and suffrau^ce of the passion of our lord
Ihesu christ / to the king of the contre / he leued upon his croche or croos /
And it happed by aue^ture / that he set the end of the croche or his staf
upon the kings foot / and perced his foot with the pike which was sharp
byneth / the king has supposed ye saint patryke had don it wetyngly / for to
meue him ye sonner to pacyenee and to the feythe of god / But When saint
Patryke aperceyued it / he was much abashed / and by his prayers he helyd the
king / And furthermore he Impetred and gate grace of our lord / that no
venomous be might live in all the contre / And yet unto this day is no
venomous be in all yrelond / After it happed on a time that a man of that
contre stale a sheep which bylonged to his neighbor / where upon Saint
Patryke admonested the people / that who someuer had taken hit / should deliver
it ageyn within seven days / when all the people were assemblyd within the
church / and the man which had stolen it made no semblaunte / to render ne
deliver ageyn this sheep / Then saint Patryke commanded by the virtue of god
that the sheep should blete and cry in the belly of him that had eten hit / And
so happed it / that in the presence of all the people the sheep cried and bleted
in the belly of him that had stolen hit / And the man that was culpable repented
him of his trespace / And the other fro then forthon kept them fro stelyng
of sheep fro any other man / Also saint Patrike was wont for to worship and do
reverence unto all the crosses deuoutelye that he might see / But on a time
tofore the sepulcre of a paynym stood a fair cross / which he passed and
went forth by as he had not seen hit / And he was demanded of his felawes /
why he saw not that cross / And then he prayed to god he said for to know
whose hit was / and he said he herd a voys under the earth saying / thou saw
it not / because I am a paynym that am buried here / and am unworthy that the
sign of the cross should stand there / wherefore he made the sign of the
cross to be taken thens / On a time as saint patryke preched in yrelond the
feythe of Ihesu crist and did but little prouff yte by his predycacion / for he
could not convert the evil rude / and wild people / And he prayed to our lord
Ihesu christ that he would show them sum sign openly ferdeful and gastful /
by which they might be converted / and be repentau^t^ of their sins / Then
by the commandment of god Saint Patryke made in therthe a great cercle with
his staff / and anon therthe after the quantyte of the cercle opened / And
there appyered a great pytte and a deep / and saint patryke by the reuelacion
of god understood that there was a place of purgatory / In to which who
someuer entered therein / he should never have other penance ne feel none other
pain / and there was showed to him that many should enter which should never
return ne come ageyn / And they that should return should abide but fro one
morn to another and no more / And many entered that came not ageyn / As touching
this pytte or hole which is named saint Patrikes purgatory / Sum hold
opinion that the second patryke which was an abbot and no bishop / that god
showed to him this place of purgatory / but certeynly such a place there is
in yrelond wherein many men have been / and yet daily go on in / and come ageyn
/ and sum have had there meruayllous vysions / and seen grysly and horrible
pains of whom there been books maad / as of Tundale and other / Then this
holy man saint patryke the bishop lived till he was Cxxij year old / and was
the first that was bishop in yrelonde / and deyed in aurelyus ambroses time
that was king of brytayn / In his time was the abbot columba otherwise named
colinkyllus and saint bride whom Saint Patryke professyd and veylled And she
over lived him forty year All these three holy saints were buried in vlster
in the cite of Dunence / as it were in a cave with three chambres her bodies
were founden at first coming of king Johan king harry the secondes sone in to
yrelond / upon whose tombs these verses following were wryton / Hic iacent in
duno / qui tumilo tumilantur in vno / Brigida / Patricius / atque columba pius
/ Which is for to say in english / In duno these three been buried all in
one sepulture

Bryde Patryke / and Columba the mylde /

Men say that this holy bishop Saint Patryke did three great things / One is
that he droof with his staff all the venomous bestys out of yrelond / The
second that he had grant of our lord god / that none yrysshe man shall abide
the coming of antecryst / The iij wonder is read of his purgatory which is
more referred to the less saint Patryk thabbot / And this holy abbot by cause
he found the people of that land rebelle / he went out of yrlond and came in
to england to the abbey of glastenberye where he deyed on a saint bartylmewes
day / He flouryd about the year of our lord viijCL / and the holy bysshoy deyed
the year of our lord four hundred iiij score and x in the hundred and xxij
year of his age / to whom pray we that he pray for us /

Thus ends the life of Saint patryke
Of saint benet thabbot / And first the interpretacion of his name
BEnet is said by cause he blessed much people / or else because he had many
benedyccions in this life / Or for as much as he deseruyd for to have
blessings or benediccions perpetuel / And the holy doctor Saint gregory wrote
his life /

Of saint benet thabbot
TAynt benet was borne of the prouynce of Nurcia / And was sent to Rome for to
study / but in his Infancye he left the scoles and went in to a deserte /
and his nouryce which tenderly loved him went alweye with him till they came to
a place named offyde / And there she borrowed a vessel for to pourge or wine we
whete / but the vessel fyl to therthe by neclygence / and was broken in two
pieces / And when saint Benet saw his nouryce weep / he had great pity / and
made his prayers to almighty god and after made hit also hole as it had been
tofore / Then they of the contre took hit / and henge hit on the front of
the church in witness of one so fair a miracle / Then left saint benet
his nourice and fled secretly and came in to an hermytage / where he was
never known of no man but of a monk named romayn which mynystred to him mete
for to ete / And because that there was no way fro the monasterye of romayn
unto the pytte where Saint Benet was / he knytte the loof in a cord and so
let hit down to him / And because he should here wha^ romayn should let down
the breed / he bond a belle on the cord and by the sown thereof / he received
his breed / But the devil having envy of the charitee of that one / and of the
refeccion of that other / cast a stone and brake the belle / but nevertheless
Romayn left not to mynystre him / It happed that there was a priest on an
estern day that had arrayed his dinner for him self / and our lord appeared to him
and said / thou ordeynest for thy self delycious metes / and my servant deyeth
for hunger in such a pytte and named him the place / Then the priest aroos
and bare his mete with him / and sought so long that he fond Saint benet in
great pain / when he had founden him he said to him / Arise and take thy mete
and refeccion / For it is ester day / He answered I know well that hit is the
feste of paske / because that I see the / The priest said to him Certeynly this
day is the day of ester and saint benet wist hit not / by cause he had dwelled
there so long and so far fro people /

Then said they graces and made the benedyccion and took their refeccyon / It
happed after this that a black bird that is called a merle came on a time to
saint benet / and peckyd with his bylle at his vysage /

And greuyd and noyed him so much that he could have no rest for it / and
could not put it from him / but as soon as he had made the sign of the cross /
anon the bird vanysshyd away / And after that came to him a great temptacio^
of the flessh by the which the devil tempted him in showing him a woman and
burnt sore and was enflamed in his courage / but anon he came again to him self
/ and after he despoylled him self all naked and went among thorns and
walowed among the nettels so that his body was torn and payned by which he
heled the wounds of his heart / Then after that time / he felt no more
temptacion of his flessh / It happed that thabbot of a monastery was deed / And
for the good renom^e of this holy man saint benet / All the monks of thabbaye
gaf their voys and elect saint benet for their abbot / But he accorded not
thereto ne agreed to them / For he said that his conditions and manners were not
acordyng to theyres / Notwythstondyng he was vaynquysshyd and so Instauntly
required / that at last he consented But when he saw they lyuyd not ne were
not ruled acordyng to their religion and rewle / he repreued and correctyd them
vigorously / And when they saw that they might not do their wylles under him
/ They gaf him venym medlyd with wyn for to drink / but saint benet made the
sign of the cross over it and blessed it / and anon the vessel brake in
pieces which was of glass / when saint benet then knesoe that in that
vesselle was mortal drink / which might not abide ne suffer the sign of the
cross / he roos up and said god have mercy on you fair brethern / I said to
you well at beginning / that my conditions and manners apparteyne not to youres
/ Fro hensforth get to you another fader / For I may no longer dwell here /
Then went he again to deserte where god showed for him many signs and
miracles / and founded there two abbeyes / Now it happed that in one of thyes
two abbeyes was a monk that might not endure long in prayers / And when the
other of his felawys were in prayer / he would goo out of the church / Then
thabbot of that abbaye showed this to saint benet / And anon he went for to
see if it were true / And when he came he saw that the devil in lyknes of a
lytyl bla^k chy^d drew him out of the church by his cowle / Then said saint
benet to the abbot / and to saint maure / See ye not him that draws him out /
they said nay / then said late us pray to god that we may see him / when
they had made their prayers / saint maure saw him / but the abbot might not
see him The next day saint benet took a rod and beat the monk / And then
he abode in prayer / like as the devil had be beten / and durst no more come and
draw him away / And fro than forthon he abode in prayer / and continued
therein Of the xij abbeyes that saint benet had founded / three of them stood on
hye Roches so that they might have no water but by great labor / Then came
the monks to him and prayed him that he would set these abbeyes in som^e other
place / by cause they had great defaute of water / Then went saint benet
about the montayne and made his orysons and prayers much devoutly / and when
he had long prayed he saw three stones in a place for a sign / And on the morn
when the monks came for to pray / he said to them / goo ye to such a place
where ye shall find three stones / and there dygge a lityl and ye shall find
water / Our lord can well provide for you water / And they went and fond the
montaygne all swetyng / where as the three stones were / And there they dug
and anon they fond water so great habundaunce that it suffysed to them / and
ran down fro the top of the hille unto bynethe in to the valeye / It happed
on a time that a man hew buysshes and thorns about the monasterye / And his
axe or instrument of iron that he hew sprang out of the helue and fill in to a
deep water / then the man cried and sorowed for his tool / and saint benet
saw that he was over anguysshid therefore / and took the helue and threw it
after in to the pytte / And anon the iron came up and byga^ to s^ym^e till that
it entered in to the helue /

In thabbaye of saint benet was a child named placidus which went to the
River for to draw water / And his foot slode so that he fyl in to the River
which was much deep / and anon the River bare him forth more than a bow
shote / And when saint benet which was in his study knew it / he called to
saint maure and said that there was a child which was a monk that was about
to be drowned and bad him go to help him / And anon saint maure ran upon the
water like as it had been on dry ground and his feet dry / And took up the
child by the here / And drew him to land / And after when he came to saint
benet / he said that it was not by his merit / but by the virtue of his
obedyence / There was a priest named florentyn / which had envy on saint benet
/ and he sent to him a loof of bred enuenymed / After when saint benet had
this loof / he knew by the Inspiracion / that it was enuenymed / he gaf it to
a raven that was wont to take his fedyng of saint benettes hand / And
commanded him to bear it unto such a place that noma^ should find it / Then
the raven made semblaunt for tobeye to the commandment of saint benet / but he
durst not touch it for the venym / and fled about it / howlyng and cryeng
/ Saint benet said to him take this bread hardyly and bear it away / At last
the raven bare it away in to such a place / that there was never herd tidings
thereof after / And came again the third day after / and took his refection of
saint benettes hand / as he was wont to do to fore / when this priest
Florentyn saw that he could not slay saint benet / he enforced him to slay
spyrytuelly the sowles of his dyscyples / he took seven maidens all naked / and
sent them in to the gardyn to daunse and to carolle for to meue the monks to
temptacion / when saint benet saw the malice of florentyn / he had fere of his
dyscyples / and sent hem out of that place / when florentyn saw that saint
benet and his monks went out he demened great Joy and made great feste / And
ano^ the soler fyl upon him and slew him suddenly when saint maure saw that
florentyn was deed / he ran after saint benet / and called him saying / come
again / for florentyn that has don so much harm to you is deed / when saint
benet herd this / he was sorry for the perryllous death of florentyn and by
cause saint maure was glad for the death of his enemy as him seemed he enjoined
him penance therefore / After this he went to mount Cassyn where he had another
great aduesarye / For in the place where that appolyn was adoured / he made an
oratorye of saint Johan baptyst / and converted all the contre about to the
christian faith / whereof the devil was so tormented / that he appyered to saint
benet all black and ran upon him with open mouth and throat / And had his
eyes all enflammed / And said to him / Benet / Benet / And saint Benet answered
not / the devil said / Cursid and not blessed why have I so much persecucion /
Hit happed on a time that as the monks should lift a stone for a work of an
edefyce / they might not meue it / then there assembled a great multitude of
people / and yet they all might not lift it / But anon as saint Benet had
blessed it / they lift it a non / Then apparceyued they that the devil was
upon it / and caused it to be so heavy / And when they had a lytyl made the
wall hye / the devil appyerid to saint Benet / and bad him goo see them that
edeffyed / then saint Benet sent to his monks / and commanded that they
should keep them well / For the devil went to destroy them / but er the
messager came to them the devil had thrown down a part of the wall and had
therewith slain a young monk / Then they brought the monk all to bruised in a
sack to saint Benet / And anon saint benet made upon him the sign of the
cross and blessed him / and raised him to life / and sent him to the work
again / A lay man of honest life had acustome ones in the year to come to saint
benet all fasting / and on a time as he came there was one that bare mete
accompayned with him / And desired that he would ete with him but he refused it
/ After he prayed him the second time / and yet he refused it / and said he would
ete no mete till he came to saint benet / At the third time he fond a fair
fontayne / and a much delytable place / And began sore to desire him to ete
with him / And at last he consented and ete / And when he came to saint benet
/ he said to him / where have thou eten / which answered I have eten a lytyl / O
fair brother the devil has deceived the / but he could not deceive the first
ne the second time / but the third time he has surmounted the / then the
good man kneled down to the feet of saint benet and confessyd him of his
trespaas / Attila the king of goths would ones preue if saint benet had the
sperite of prophecye / and sent to him his servant and did do array him with
precious robes / and delyuerd to him a great company as he had been the king
him self / when saint benet saw him come he said to him fair sone / do of
that thou werest it is not thyn / and the man fyl down anon to the ground by
cause he mocqued the holy man and deyde anon / A knight that was vexed with the
devil was brought to saint benet for to be heled / And saint benet put him out
/ and after said to the knight / Goo and fro hensforth ete no more flessh / and
goo no more to none order / For what day thou ghost and take ordres the devil
shall reentre in to the / This knight held him long time without taking any /
till at last he saw younger than he / that went to ordres / And had forgete
the words of saint benet / and took ordres / And anon the devil entryd in to
his body / and tormented him till he deyde / There was a man that sent to saint
benet ij flagons of wyn but he that bare them hid that one / And presented
that other without more / wha^ saint benet had received the present / he
thanked him much / and said to him / Fair brother take good head how you shall
do with that which thou have hyd / and drink not thereof For thou know not
what is therein Then he was asshamed and so confused went from him / And when
he came to the place where he had hyd it / he would wit what was therein / like
as saint benet had told to him / and bowed it a lytyl / and anon a serpent
issued out / It happed on a time that saint benet ete / and a young man which
was sone to a great lord held to him a candel / and began to think in his
heart / who is this that I serve / I am sone unto a great man / hit
apperteyneth not that one so gentyl a man as I am / be servant to him / when
saint benet saw by experience the pride that aroos in this monk / he called
another monk / and made him to hold the candell / And after said to him /
what is that thou have / bless thy heart brother bless it / god forgive it
the / Now thou shall serve me no more / goo in to thy cloystre and rest the
there / There was a man of the king of goths which was named Zallas which
tormented over cruelly the christian men by cause he was of the sect of
tharrye^s in such wise that where he fond clerks or monks he slew them /
Then it happed on a day that he tormented a uylayn or a carle for the
couetyse of his good / when the carle saw that he would take all / he gaf all
that ever he had to saint benet / Then left Zallas to tormente him a lytyl /
but he bond him with the reins of his brydell / and droof him to fore / and
he rode after till that he came to thabbaye of saint benet and bad him that he
should show to him this benet / when he came theder he saw saint benet stand to
fore the gate allone and studied in a book / then said the vylayne to the
trau^t / Loo there is benet that thou demaundest after / when Zallas had looked
on him cruelly like he had been acustomed he had supposed to have dealt with him
/ like as he had do with other christian men And said to saint benet /

Arise up anon and deliver to me the goods of this carle which thou have by
the / when saint benet herd he lift up a lytyl his eyes / and be^^lde the
carle that was to fore him / And anon by great meruaylle his arms were
vnbounden / And when the carle saw him self vnbounden / he stood to fore the
tyrant Appertely without dread / And anon Zallas fyl down to the feet of saint
benet and recomanded him to his prayers / And never for all this left saint
benet to read on his book / but called his monks and coma^ded that his mete
should be brought to him / and the monks did so / And since bare it away /
Then admonested saint Benet the tyrant and said to him that he should leave
his cruelte and his wodenes / And he deperted and never after that day / he
demanded of vylayn any good / ne of the man that saint benet had vnbou^den only
by his sight / It happed over all champayne where as he dwelled / that so
great famyne was in the contre that much people deyed for hungre / then all
the breed of thabbaye faylled / and there was within but v loves for all the
covent / when saint benet saw that they were abashed / he began debonairly to
chastyse and warn them that they should have their hertes on hye to god and
said to them / Wherefore are ye in so great mesease for bread / if ye have no ne
this day ye shall have to morn / now it happed that on the morn they fond at
their yate two honderd muddes of mele / which were proprely sent fro god /
For never man wist / fro whens they came / when the monks saw that they
thanked god / and learned that they ought not doubt / ne of habundaunce ne of
pouerte /

It happed on a time that saint benet sent his monks for to edefye an abbaye
/ and said that at a certain day he would come see them and show them what they
should do / Then the night to fore that he had said to come / he appyered to
the maystre and to his monks / and showed to them all the places that they
should bylde / but they byleuyd not thye vysion / and supposed it had be but a
dreme / Then when they saw that he came not they returned and said to him /
Fair fader we have abyden that thou sholdest have comen to us / like as thou
promysest us then answered he what is that ye say remember not ye that I
appyeryd to you that night that I promised you / and enseygned and told how ye
should do Goo your way and do in such wise as I devised to you in the vysion
/ There were two nonnes nyghe unto his monasterye which were of much noble
lygnage / which were much talkatyf and restrained not well their tongues / but
tormented ouermoche him that governed them / And when he had showed this to
saint benet / he sent them word / that they should better keep scilence and
rule their tongues / or he would curse them / but they for all that would not
leave it / And so anon after they deyde and were buried in the church / And
when the deken cried in the end of the mass / that they that were acursed shald
goo out of the church / the nourisse that had nourisshed them / and that every
day had offered for them / byhelde and saw that when the deken sange so they
issued out of their sepulcres and went out of the church / And when saint
benet knew hereof / he offered for them him self and assoylled them / Then
after that when the deken said so as a fore / they never issued out after / as
their noucices had seen them There was a monk goon out for to see his fader and
mother without license and blessyng of his abbotte / And the day after he came
theder he deyd / And when he was buried in therthe / therthe cast him out
again And so it did twyes / then came the fader and mother to saint benet /
and told him how the earth threw him and would not receive him / and prayed that
he would bless him / Then took he the blessed sacrament / and made it to be
leyde on the breast of the corpse / And when they had done so they buried him /
and therthe drew him no more out / but received the body and held it / There
was a monk that could not abide in the monastery and prayed so much to saint
benet / that he let him goo and was all angry / and anon as he was out of
thabbaye / he fond a dragon with open mouth / And when he saw him he had fere
that he would have devoured him / and cried loud / Come hither and help me /
come hither / For this dragon will devour me / then the monks ran / but
they saw no dragon / and brought again the monk tre^blyng and syghyng then
the monk promised that he never would depart fro thabbaye In a time there was
in that center a great famyne / and all that ever saint benet might get and
have / he gave it to the pour people / in so much that he had no more in the
abbaye but a lytyl oil / and he commanded yet to the celerer to give it to a
pour man the celerer understood him well / but he gaf it not / by cause there
was no more in the covent / And when saint benet knew it he took the vessel /
and cast it out of the wyndow and was of glass / and it fell on a stone / and
brake not / then he repreued the celerer of inobedience / and of a lityl hope
that he had in god / and after he went unto his prayers / And anon a great
empty tonne that was there / was full of oylle in so much that it ran over /
It happed an other day that saint benet went to visit his suster named
scolastica / And as they satte at table / She prayed her brother that he would
abide there all that night but he in no wise would grant her / and said he
might not lie out of his cloister / And when she saw that he would not grant
to her to abide / she enclyned her heed and made her prayers to our lord / And
anon it began to tho^dre and to lyghtne / and the air to wexe derke / which
to fore was fair and clear / and a great rayn fyl down / so that for nothing he
might depart / And like as she wept with her eyes / right so forthwyth the
rain and storm came / and then she lift up her heed / Then saint benet
said to his suster / almighty god forgive you that ye have don For ye have
let me that I may not depart hens / And she said / Fair brother god is more
curtoys than ye be / For ye would not accept my prayer / but god has herd me /
now goo if ye may And then saint benet abode there / all the night spekyng of
god between him and his suster / without slepyng till they were both eased / On
the morn saint benet went to his abbaye / And on the third day after he lift
up his eyes to heaven / and saw the soul of his suster mount up in to heaven
in the lyknes of a douue / And anon he did the body of her to be brought to
his abbaye / and did it to be buried in his tomb / which he had do made for
him self / On a night as saint benet was in his pyayer at a wyndowe / he saw
the soul of saint germayn bishop of capes mount in to heaven / And like as a
light sudden that enlumyneth all the derknesses of the world / so the light of
that soul gaf a great light / And after he knew that the soul of saint
germayn passed that same hour / After this when time came / that saint benet him
self should deperte out of this world he showed it to his monks six days to
fore / and did do make his pytte / and after that a fever took him strongly /
which held him every day / and at the sixthe day / he did him self to be
born to the church / And there received the body of our lord Ihesu christ And
after among the hands of his dyscyples / his owen hands lyftyng up to heaven /
in making his oryson he rendryd his soul unto his creator / The same hour was
a reuelacion showed to two monks / For they saw a way to heaven all couerd with
palles and man tellis of gold / all full of torches brennyng / which enlumyned
all the heaven / which came fro the celle of saint benet unto heaven / And there
was a man in a fair habyte / to whom these monks demanded / what way that
was And he answered that it was the way by which saint benet mounted up to
heaven / Then the body of saint benet was buried in the oratorye that he had
made of saint Johan / where as was wont to be the altar of appollyn the xere
of our lord vC and xviij / To whom late us pray devoutly that he pray to our
lord for us that we may have grace after this life to come to everlasting bliss
in heaven / Amen /

Thus ends the life of saint benet Abbote
Here next follows the life of saint Cuthberd of durham
Saint cuthberd was born in england / And when he was viij year old our lord
showed for him a fair miracle / for to draw him to his love For on a time as he
pleyed at the balle with other children / Suddenly there stood emonge them a
fair young child of the age of iij year / which was the fairest creature that
ever they beheld / And anon he said to cuthberd / good brother use no such
vain plays ne set not thy heart on them / But for all that cuthberd took
none heed to his words / And then this child fill down and made great
heaviness / wept sore / and wrong his hondes / And then Cuthberd and the
other children left their play and comforted him and demanded of him why he
made such sorrow / Then the child said to Cuthbert / all mine heaviness is
only for the / by cause thou vsist such vain plays / for our lord has
chosen the to be an heed of holy church / And then suddenly he vanysshyd away
/ And then he knew verily / that it was an Angele sent fro our lord to him
/ And fro then forthon he left all such vain plays / and never used them
more / and began to live holyly And then he desired of his fader / that he
might be set to scole / and anon he drew him to parfyght living / for he was
ever in his prayers night and day / And most desired of our lord to do that
which might plese him and eschew that should dysplese him / and he lived so
vertuosly and holyly that all the people had Joy of him / and within a while
after Aydanus the bishop deyde / And as cuthberd kept sheep in the field / he
lokyd up ward and saw angellis bare the soul of Aydanus the bishop to heaven
with great melodye / And after that saint cuthberd would no more keep sheep but
went anon to thabbaye of geru^us / And there he was a monk / of whom all the
coue^te were right glad / and thanked our lord that had sent him theder / For
he lived there full holyly in fasting and great penance doing / And at last
he had the gowte in his knees which he had taken of cold in knelyng upon the
cold stones / when he said his prayers in such wise that his knee hegan to
swelle / And the synewys of his leg were shronke / that he might neither goo
ne stratche out his leg / but ever he took it full patiently / and said when
it plesith our lord / it shall pass away / And within a while after his
brethern for to do him comfort bare him in to the field / And there they met
with a knight / which said late me see and handle this cuthbertis leg / And
then when he had felt it with his hands / he bad them take the mylk of a
cow of one color / and the Iuse of small pla^tayn / And fair whete flour And
seethe them all to gydre / And make thereof a plaster / and leye it thereto /
and it will make him hool / And as soon as they had so done he was perfightly
hool / And then he thanked our lord full mekely / And after he knew by
reuelacio^ that it was an angele sent by our lord to hele him / of his great
sekenes and disease / And thabbot of that place sent him / to aselle of
theyres to be hosteler / for to receive / there ghestes / and do them confort /
And sone after our lord showed there a fair miracle for his servant saint
cuthberd / For Angellis come to him oftymes in liknes of other ghestis whom he
received and served dylygently with mete and drink / and other necessaryes /
On a time there come ghestis to him whom he received / and went in to the
houses of office for to serve them / And when he came again they were goon / And
went after for to call and could not espy them / ne know the stappes of
their feet how well that it was then a snow / and when he returned he fond
the table leide And thereon three fair white loves of bread all hoot which were
of meruayllous beauty and swetenes / For all the place smelled of the sweet
odor of them / Then he knew well that the Angellis of our lord had been there
/ and rendryd thankynges to our lord that he had sent to him his angellys for
to conforte him / and every night wha^ his brethern were a bed he would goo
and stand in the cold water al naked up to the chyn till it were myd night /
And then he would issue out Anth wha^ he come to land / he might not stand
for feebleness / and fayntnes / but often fill down to the ground / And on a time
as he lay thus / there came ij otters which licked every place of his body /
and then went again to the water that they came fro / And then saint
cuthberd aroos all hool and went to his celle again / and went to matyns with
his brethern / but his brethern knew nothing of his stondyng thus every night
in the sea to the chyn / but at last one of his brethern espied it and knew
his doing and told him thereof / but saint cuthberd charged him to keep it
secret / and tell noman thereof during his life / And after this within a while
the bishop of durham deyed / And saint cuthberd was elect and sacred bishop
in his stead after him And ever after he lived full holyly unto his death / And
by his prechyng and ensample gyuyng he brought much people to good living / And
to fore his death / he left his bysshopriche / And went in to the holy Island /
where he lyuyd an holy and solytary life unto that ^e being full of virtues
rendryd his soul unto almighty god / And was buried at durham / And after
translated and the body leyd in a fair and honorable shryne where as yet daily
our lerd shows for his servant there many fair and great miracles / wherefore
late us pray unto this holy saint / that he pray for us /

Here follows the fest of the anunciacion or salutacion of thangel gabriel to
our lady
THe feste of this day is called thanunciacion of our lady / for on this day
thaungel gabriel showed to the glorious virgyne marye the coming of the blessed
sone of god / That is to wete how he ought to come in to ye gloryouse vyrgyne /
and take in her nature / and flesh humayne for to save the world It was well
thing reasonable that than gel should come to the glorious virgyn marye / For
like as Eve by thenhortyng of the devil / gaf her cousente to do the sin of
Inobedyence to our perdicion / Right so by the gretyng of thangel gabryel and
by exhortyng the glorious virgyne marye / gaf her consentyng to his message by
obedyence to our salvation / wherefore like as the first woman was cause of our
dampnacion / So was the blessed virgyne marye beginning of our redemption /
when that thangel gabriel was sent for to show thyncarnacyon of our savior
Ih^u crist he fond her al one enclosed in her chamber / like as saint bernard
says / In which the maidens and virgynes ought to abide in their howses /
without rennyng abroode out openly / And they ought also to flee the words of
men / of which their honor and good renomee might be lassed or hurt / And
thangele said to the glorious vyrgyne marye / I salewe the full of grace / the
lord is with the / There is not founden in scripture in no perte such a
salewyng And it was brought fro heaven unto the glorious virgyne marye / which
was the first woman that ever in the world offrid to god first her virgynyte /
And thaungele said to her after / Thou shall be blessed above all other Wymen
/ For thou shall escape the malediction that all other wymen have in chyldyng
in sin and in sorrow / and thou shall be mother of god / and shall abide a pure
virgyne and clean / and our blessed lady was much abasshid of this salutacion
/ and thought in her self the manner thereof / This was a good manner of a vyrgyne
/ that so wisely held her stylle / and spack not / and showing example to
virgynes which ought not lightly to speak / ne without aduys ne manner / to
answer / And when thangele knew that for this salutacion she was tymerous and
abashed / A none he repeased her saying / Marye be nothing aferd / For thou
have founden sothly grace at god For thou art chosen above all wymen for to
receive his blessed sone / and be mother to god / and moyen and advocate for to
set peace between god and man for to destroy the death and bring the life / O
thou that art a vyrgyne says saint Ambrose / learn of marye to be manerd and
fere full to all men / learn to be stylle / and teschewe all dssolucions /
Marye was aferd of the salutacion of thangel / the which said Thou shall
conceive / and bring forth a sone / And thou shall call his name Ihesus / and
he shall be callid the sone of god / And marye said to the angele / In what
manner may this be that thou say / For I have purposed in mine heart / that I
shall never know man / And yet I never knew none / how then shall I have a
child again the course of nature / and may abide a vyrgyne / Then the Angele
informed her / and began to say / how her vyrgynyte should be saved in the
conceyuyng of the sone of god / and answered to her in this manner / The holy
ghoost shall come in to the / which shall make the to conceive / the manner how
thou shall conceive / thou shall know better than I shall conne say / For that
shall be the work of the holy ghoost / which of thy blood and of thy flessh
shall form purely in the / the body of the child that thou shall b^re / and
other work to this concepcion shall thou not do And the virtue of god
sovereign shall shadow the in such wise / that thou shall never feel in the
any brennyng ne couetyse carnal / and shall purge thyn heart fro all desires
temporell / and yet shall the holy ghoost shadow with the mantel corporel /
that the blessed sone of god shall be hid in the / and of the / for to couere
the right excellent clarte of his dyuynyte / so that by this vmbre or shadow
may be known and seen his dygnyte / like as huge of saint victor / and saint
bernard say / After thangele said / And for as much as thou shall conceive of
the holy ghoost / and not of man / the child that shall be born of the shall be
called the sone of god / yet of this concepcion which is above nature / the
Angele said to her this example / Lo elyzabeth thy cosyne which is barayne
has conceived a child in her age / For there is nothing impossyble to god /
which is almighty / Then said the gloryouse virgyne marye / to thangele the
answer for which he was comen / lo thandmayde of god / he do to me that he
has ordained after thy words She has given to us example to be humble when
prosperyte of hye Richesse comes to us / For the first word that she spack or
said when she was made mother of god and queen of heaven / that was that she
callid her self ancylle or handmayde / and not lady / much people is humble in
low estate and but few in hye estate / that is to wete in great estates / and
therefore is humylyte more preysed in them that been great in estate / As Soon as
she said loo here the handmayde of god late it ben do to me after thy words /
Thomas in compendio / In that same time that she had thus given her assente to
the angele / She conceived in her Ihesu christ which in that same hour was in
her parfight man and parfight god in one person / and as wise as he was in
heaven / or when he was xxx year old / This blessed Anunciacion happened the xxv
day of the month of march / On which day happend also as well to fore as
after these things that here after be named / On that same day Adam the first
man was created / and fyl in to orygynal sin by inobedience / and was put out
of paradys terrestre / After thangele showed the concepcion of our lord to the
gloryouse virgyne marye / Also that same day of the month kaym slew Abel his
brother / Also melchesedech made offryng to god of bread and wyn in the presence
of Abraham / Also on the same day Abraham offrid ysaac his sone / That same day
saint Johan baptyst was byheded / And saint peter was that day delyuerd out of
prison / And saint James the more that day byheded of herod / And our lord
Ihesu christ was on that day crucyfyed / wherefore / that is a day of great
reverence / Of the salutacion that thangel brought to the gloryouse virgyne /
We read an example of a noble knight / which for tame^de his life / gaf and
rendryd him self in to an abbaye of cysteauls / and for as much as he was no
clerk / there was assygned to him a maystre for to teache him and to be with the
brethern clerks / but he could nothing learn in long time that he was there
sauf these two words / Aue maria / which words he had so sore enprynted in
his heart / that alleway he had them in his mouth whersomeuer he was / At
last he deyde and was buried in the chyrcheyerde of the brethern / It happed
after that upon the buryels grew a right fair flourdelis / And in every flour
was wreton in lettres of gold Aue maria / of which miracle all the brethern
were amerueylled / And they did open the sepulture / and fond that the rote
of this flour delis came out of the mouth of the said knight / And anon they
understood that our lord would have him honored for the great devotion that he
had to say these words Aue maria / Another knight there was that had a fair
place by side the hye way where much people passed whom he robbed as much as
he might and so he used his life / But he had a good custom / For every day he
salewed the gloryouse vyrgyne marye in saying Aue maria / And for no labor he
left not to great our lady as said is / It happed that an holy man passed by
his house / whom he robbed and dyspoylled / But that holy man prayed them that
robbed him that they would bring him to their master for he had to speak with
him in his hows of a secret thing for his prouffyt / and when the robbers
herd that / they ladde him to fore the knight their lord And anon the holy man
prayed him that he would do come all his meyney to fore him / And when his main
by the coma^dement of the knight were assembled / the holy man said / yet ben
they not all here / there is one yet to come / Then one of them apperceyued
that the chambreleyn of the lord was not comen / And anon the knight made him
to come / And when the holy man saw him come / anon he said I conjure the by
the virtue of Ihesu christ our lord / that thou say to us who thou art / and
for what cause thou art comen hither / Anon the chambyrleyn answered / Alas now
must I say and knowleche my self / I am noman / but am a devil which am in
the form of a man and have take it xiiij year by which space I have dwelled
with this knight / For my maystre has sent me hither / to the end that I should
take heed night and day that if this knight cessed to say the salutacion Aue
maria For then I should strangle him with mine owen hand / and bring him to
hell by cause of the evil life that he has led and ledeth / but by cause he
says every day this salutacion / Aue maria I might not have him / and therefore
I abode here so long / For there passes him no day but that he saleweth our
lady / when the knight herd this he was much aferd / And fyl down to the feet
of this holy man / and demanded pardon of his sins / After this the holy man
said to the devil / I coma^de the in the name of our lord that thou depart
hens / and goo in to another place / where thou may grieve / ne annoye noman /
Then late us pray to the gloryouse virgyne marye / that she keep us fro the
devil / And that we may by her come to the glory of heaven To the which
bring us the fader / the sone / and the holy ghoost amen /

Thus ends the anunciacion of our blessed Lady
Here begins the lif of saint Second knight
Saint second was a noble and valiant knight / and glorious martyr of our
lord Ihesu christ / And suffered his passion and was crowned with the palm of
martirdom in cite of Astence / by whose glorious presence the said cite was
enbelisshyd and for a synguler patron e^noblysshid And this holy man second
was informed / in the faith of the blessed man Calatero which was holden in
prison by the prouoste Sapryce in the said cite of Astence / And when marcianus
was holden in prison in the cite of tredonence / Sapryce the provost would goo
thither for to make him do sacrefyse And saint second much desiryng to see
saint marcyane went with him / as it had been by cause of Solace / And anon as
they were out of the cite of Altence / a white douue descended upon saint
secondes heed / To whom sapryce said / See second how our gods love the /
which send birds fro heaven to vysite the / And when they came to the river of
tanagre saint second saw thangele of god going upon the flood and saying to
him / Second see that thou have ferme faith / and thus shall thou goo above
them that worsh^ppe ydolles / Then Sapryce said / brother second / I here
the gods spekyng to the / To whom saconde said / late us walk unto the
desires of our heart / And when they came to another flood that hight buryn /
that same angel aforesaid said / Second byleuest thou in god / or parauenture
thou doubtest / To whom second said / I believe verily the truth of his
passion / Then said Sapryce / what is that I here / And second said nothing
/ when they should enter in to trydone / by the coma^dement of the angele /
Marcianus issued out of prison and appierid to second saying / Second enter
in to the way of truth / and receive the victory of faith / Sapryce said
who is he that speaks to us as it were in a dreme / To whom Second said / it
may be well to the a dreme / but to me it is Admonicion and a comfort / After
this second went to melane / And the angele of god brought faustyn and
Jonathan which were holden in prison out of the cite to second / And of them
he received baptesme / And a cloud mynystred water for to baptyse him with /
And suddenly a douue descended fro heaven bryngyng unto faustyn and Ionatyn the
blessed sacrament / And faustyn delyuerd it to second for to bear it to
marciane / Then second returned when it was night / and went to the River
named pade / And the angele of our lord took the bridle of the horse and led
him over the River / and ladde him unto trydone / and set him in the prysone
where marciane was / And second delyuerd to marciane the yefte that faustyn
had sent to him / And receyuyng it said / the blessid body of our lord Ihesu
christ be with me in to everlasting life / Then by the commandment of thangele
/ Second went out of prison and went unto his lodgyng / After this marciane
received sentence to have his heed smeton of / And so it was don / And then
second took his body and buried it / And when sapryce herd hereof he did do
call second to him and said / By this that I see the do / I see well that
thou art a christian man / To whom second said / Verily I know leche me to be a
christian man / then sapryce said / Loo how desire thou to dey^ an evil death
To who^ second said / that death is more due to the than to me / And when
second would not sacrefyse to thydollis / he commanded to be despoylled all
naked / And anon the angele of god was ready and him cladde in a better clothyng
than he had to fore Then Sapryce commanded him to be hanged on an instrum^t
named eculee / of which two ends stand on the ground and ij upward like saint
Andrews cross and thereon he was honged / till his Arms were out of Ioynte /
but our lord restored him anon to health / And then he was commanded to goo in
to prison / And when he was there / thangele of our lord came to him and said /
Arise Second and follow me And I shall led the to thy maker / And he led him
fro thens unto the cite of Astence / And brought him in to the prison where
Caleocerus was / and our blessed saueour with him / And when second saw him /
he fyl down at his feet / And our savior said to him / Be not aferd second /
For I am thy lord god that shall keep the from all evil / And then he blessyng
him ascended to heuene / On the morn Sapryce sent unto the prison which they
fond fast shette / but they fond not second / Then sapryce went fro
trydone the cite unto Astence for to punysshe Caleocere / And when he was come
he sent for him for to be presented to fore him / And they said to him that
second was with him / And anon he commanded that they should be brought to fore
him / to whom he said By cause that my gods know you to be despysers of them
/ they will that ye both deye to gydre / And by cause they would not do
sacrefise to his gods he did do mylte pitche and rosyn and commanded to be
cast upon their heedes and in their mowthes / They drank it with great desire
as it had been most swetest water / And said with a clear voys / O lord how thy
words ben sweet in our mowthes / Then sapryce gaf upon them sentence that
saint Second should be beheded in the cite of Astence / And Caleocerus should be
sent to Albigarye and there to be punysshyd / when then saint Second was
byheded / thangellis of our lord took his body and buried it with much
worship and praysyng / he suffrid his death the third kalendes of apryl /
Late us pray then that he pray for us / to our lord /

Thus ends the life of saint Second martyr
Here begins the life of Marie Egypciaca
MArye the Egypcien which was called a synnar / led and lyuyd the most
strayt life and sharp that might be xlvij year in deserte / In that time was a
good holy and relegious monk named zozimas and went through the deserte which
lies by yonde the flome Jordan / And much desired to find som^e holy fadres /
And when he came fer and deep in the deserte / he fond a creature which was all
black over all her body of the great hete and brennyng of the son / which
went in that deserte / And that was this marye egypciaca aforsaid / But as soon
as she saw Zozimas come / she fled and Zozimas after / And she tarried And
said / Abbote Zozimas wherefore folowest thou me / have pity and mercy on me /
For I dar not torn my face toward the by cause I am a woman and also naked /
but cast thy mantel upon me / by which I may then without shame look and
speak with the / And when Zozimas herd him self named he was greatly
esmerueylled / And anon he cast to her his mantell / And humbly prayed her that
she would give to him her blessyng / And she answered It apperteyned to the fair
fader to give the benediction / and nothing to me For thou have the dignyte of
presthode / when he herd that she knew his name and his office / he had yet
more meruaylle / and of that she axid so mekely his blessyng / After she said /
Blessed be god the savior of our sowles Then she lift up her hands unto
heaven / in making her prayer / And Zozimas saw in prayeng to god her body was
lift up fro therthe well hye a foot and an half / And began to think that it
had been som^e evil spyryte / Then Zozimas coniured her by the virtue of god /
that she should tell to him her estate / and her condition / And she answered /
Fair fader spare me thereof / For if I should recou^te mine estate / ye should flee
away fro me / like as fro a venymous serpente / And thy holy eeres should be
made foul of my words / And the air should be full and fowl of corrupcion /
and when she saw that Zozimas would not be satisfied so / Then she said /
Fair fader I was born in Egypt / and when I was in the age of xij year I went
in to Alexandrye / And there I gaf my body openly to sin by the space of xvij
year / and abandouned it to lecherye and refused noman / After it happed that
men of that contre / went for adoure and worship the holy cross in
Iherusalem / And I prayed to one of the maronners that he would suffer me to
pass with the other people the sea / and when he me demanded payement for my
passage / I answered / Fair syres I have nothing to pay you with / but I
abandonne my body to do with all your playsir for my passage / and they took
me by that condition / and when I was come in to Iherusalem unto the entree of
the church for to worship the holy cross with the other I was suddenly and
Inuysibly put a back many times / in such wise that I might not enter in to
the church / And then I returned and thought in my self / that this came to
me for the great sins / that I had commysed in time past / And began to smite
my breast and weep tenderly and sighe grievously / And I beh^ld there thymage of
our lady / And I fyl down and prayed her all weeping / that she would Impetre and
get me pardon of my sins / of her sweet sone / and would suffer me to enter
in to the church for to worship the holy cross / promysyng to forsake the
world / And fro than forthon to live chaast / when I had thus prayed / and to
our blessed lady thus faithfully promysid / I went again to the doors of the
church / And without any Impedyment I entered in to the church / And when I
had devoutly worshypped and adoured the holy cross / A man gaf to me iij pens
/ of which I bought three loves of breed And after I herd anon a voys if thou
wylt pass and goo over slome Jordan thou shall be sauf / And then I passed
Jordan and came in to this deserte / where I never saw man by the space of xvij
year / These three loves that I bare with me bycam hard by the drought of the
time as a stone / of which I took my sustynaunce / and suffysed to me xvij
year / And after I ete herbs / my clothes ben Roten long sith / And thise
xvij first year I was much tempted by the brennyng of the son much asprely
/ And many delectacions that I have had in mete and drink the good wynes / and
doing the desires of my body / all these came in my thought / Then he
bewaylled them on the earth And prayed for help to our blessed lady in whom I
had set all my affyaunce / And I wept much tenderly / And anon I saw
coming about me a great light / by the which I was all recomforted / and
lost all the thoughts which often and grievously tempted me And since I have been delyuerd of all temptacions / and am nourisshyd of spirituel mete of the
word of our lord And thus have I be all my life as I have told to the / And I
pray the by thyncarnacion of Ihesu criste / that thou pray for me synful
creature / Then the old fader Zozymas fyl down unto ground / and thanked
our lord god that had thus saved his servant / And she said I pray the fair
fader that thou wylt come ageyn on the next sherethorsday and bring with the /
the body of our lord for to howsel me / For sithe I entered in to this deserte I
was never howseled ne received the holy sacrament / And then I shall come to
flomiordan against the / Zozymas went to his abbey / and after the year passed
on sherethorsday / he came ageyn in to the place / like as the holy woman had
prayed him / And when he was comen to flomiordan / he saw on that other side
the holy woman / which made the sign of the cross upon the water / and went
on hit / and came over to him / When Zozymas saw this miracle / anon he fyl
down to the feet of the holy woman / for to do to her honor and reverence /
but she forbad and deffended him and said / Thus ought thou not to do / For
thou art a priest and berest the holy sacrament the which she received in
right great devotion / and said in weeping / lord god please hit to the to
receive me in pees / For mine eyes has seen my savior / how well that she had
alwey wept and shed teerys so haboundauntly / that it seemed that she had lost
her sight And after she said to Zozymas / I pray the that at the end of this
year thou wylt come hyder ageyn to me / and pray for me synful creature / and
anon after she made the sign of the cross upon the ryuere / and passed over
the water with dry feet / as she tofore came And Zozymas went ageyn to his
abbey / But he repented much that he had not demanded the name of the woman /
And after the year passed he came ageyn to the deserte like as he had promised
to this holy woman / And he found her deed / and the body ordynatly leyed as
hit should be beryed / Zozymas began then anon tenderly to weep / and durst
not approach ne touch the body / but said to him self I would gladly berye this
holy body if I knew that I should not dysplese her / And when he was in this
thought / he saw lyeng by her heed a letter that said in this manner / Zozymas
burye right here the body of the pour marye / and render to the earth his
right / and pray to god for me / At whose commandment the second day after I
received him / he called me fro this world / Then zozymas was much glad that
knew the name of the saint / But he was gretely esmayed how he might burye the
body / For he had no thing for to delue therthe with / And anon he saw the
earth doluen and a sepulture made by a lion that came thither / And then
Zozymas buried her / and the lion departed debonayrly / And Zozymas returned
to his abbey / and recounted to his brethern the conversation of this holy
woman marye / And Zozymas lived an hundred year in holy life / and gafe laud to
god of all his yeftes / and his goodness that he receives synnars to mercy
which with good heart turn to him / and promyseth to them the joy of heaven /
Then let us pray to this holy marye thegypcien that we may be here so
penytente that we may come thither /

Thus ends the life of saint marye the Egipcien

precious / and also hit is much precious in the church / and much sweet
smellyng in deeds and in words / Or Ambrose may be said of Ambre and syos /
which is as much to say as god / For Ambrose is as much to say as ambre of

fader of light and of syor that is a little child / that is a fader of many
sons by spyrytuell generation / clear and full of light in exposicion of holy
scripture / and was little in his humble conversation / Or thus as is said in

by great renommee smellyng / savor by contemplacion within him / An honey comb
by sweet exposicion of scriptures / mete of Angels by his glorious life / And
paulynus bishop of volusian wrote his life unto Saint Austyn /

Of the life of saint Ambrose
Saint Ambrose was sone of Ambrose prouoste of rome / of whom it happed as he
lay in his cradell in the halle of the pretoire there came a swarm of bees
which fyl on his vysage and his mowth and after they departed and flewe up in
the air so hye that they might not be seen / when this was done the fader
which was hereof esmayed said if this child live there shall be sum great
thing of him / After when he was a little grown he beheld his mother and his
suster which was a sacred virgyn kiss the priests hand when they offered /
And he playeng with his suster put forth his hand for to kiss / and said /
that so behooved her to do to him And she not understanding him refused hit /
After he was set to scole at Rome / and becam to be so good a clerk that he
determined the causes of the paleys / And therefore valentynyen the emperor
delyuerd him to govern two prouynces named / lygurye / and Emylye / Then
when he came in to melane it happed that the bishop was deed / And the people
were assembled to provide for another / but between the Arryens and the good
christian men for the eleccion fyl a great sedycion and dyscorde And ambrose for
to pease this sedicion went thither / and the voys of a child was herd /
saying Ambrose ought to be bishop / and anon all the people accorded thereto
holy and began for to cry / Ambrose / Ambrose / But ambrose deffended as
much as he might / and all way the people cried Ambrose / Then for to make
the people sece / he went out of the church / and went up on a scaffolde and
made the people to be beten against the usage and custom for to let them
that they should name him no more / But yet they left not for all that / but the
people said thy sin be upon us / Then he being so^e troubled went home /
and suffryd comm^n wymmen to enter openly in to his hows to the end that when
the people (...) that / should revoke their eleccion / but for all that / they
cried as they did to fore / and said thy sins be upon us When saint ambrose
saw that he might not empesshe the eleccion he fled away but the people awayted
upon him / and took him at thyssue of the gate / and kept him so long till
they had grant of the emperor / and when the emperor knew hereof he had great
joy / because that the Judge that he had sent for the prouynces / was chosen
to be their bishop / And also he was glad by cause his word was accomplisshed
/ for the Emperor said to Ambrose when (...) sent him thither / goo said he
and abide not there as a Judge / but as a bishop Saint ambrose in the mean
while that they abode the answer of the emperor / fled yet away / but he was
taken ageyn / and was baptized / for he was not tofore baptized / how Well that
he was christian in will / And the viij day after he was consecrate and stalled
bishop of melan / And four year after that he went to Rome / and there his
suster the vyrgyn kyssed his hand as of a priest / and he smylyng said lo as I
told the / now thou kyssest my hand as of a priest / It happed after that
when saint Ambrose Went to another cytee to theleccion of a bishop Iustyn the
emperesse / and other of the sect of tharryens would not consent to the good
christian men / But would have one of their sect / Then one of the vyrgyns of
themperesse much fair took saint ambrose and drew him by his vestementes /
and would have made him to be beten / by cause he would not hold the party of
the wymmen / Then saint ambrose said to her if I be not worthy to be a
bishop / yet thou ought not to lay hand upon me / ne none other bishop
thou have laid hand on me / thou ought much redoubte and dread the
Judgment of god / And therefore god confermyd his sentence on her / For the
next day she was born to her grave and was deed / Thus was she rewarded for
the vylonye that she had done / And all the other were thereby sore aferde /
After this when he was returned to melan / he suffered many assaults and
persecucions of the emperesse Iustyn / For she moeued by yeftes and by honor
much people ageynste saint ambrose / and many there were that enforced them to
send him in exyle / And emonge al other there was one mounted in so great
madness and furour against him / that he hired him an hows by the church / by
cause he would have therein a carte for to set saint ambrose thereon / and led
him in to exyle / but that same fyl to him For he him self was sent in exyle
in the same carte / the same day that he would have led aweye saint ambrose /
To whom yet saint ambrose did good for evil / for he mynystred to him his
costs and necessaryes / Saint ambrose also establysshed in the church song
and offices at melane first / There were at that time in melane many men vexyd
and bysette with deuyls which cried with hye voys that saint ambrose tormented
them thus / but themperesse Iustyn and tharryens said / that said ambrose made
them to say so for money that he gafe to them / Then it happed that one of the
arryens was out of his mind and said thus / be they all tormented as I am
that consent not to saint ambr^se / and therefore the other arryens drowned him
in a deep pyscyne or pytte / There was another heretyke and an arryen a sharp
and so hard that he was Inconuertyble by cause no man might convert him to
the faith / On a time he herd saint ambrose preche / and he saw at his ere
an aungel that told him all that he preached / and when he had apperceyued this
/ he began to susteyn the feythe to which he had been contrary / After this it
happed that one enchauntour called deuyls to him / and sent them to saint
ambrose for to ennoye and grieve him / but the deuyls returned and said that
they might not approach to his yate by cause there was a great fire al about his
hows / and this enchauntour after When he was tormented of the provost for
certain trespaces / he cried and said that he was tormented of saint ambrose
There was a man that had a devil within him / And after went to melane / and
anon as he entered the cytee the devil left him / and as soon as he went out
of the cytee the devil reentred in him ageyn / then he demanded him why he
did so / and he answered by cause he was aferde of ambrose / after it happed
that a man being conducte and hired of Iustyn themperesse came to the beds
side of saint ambrose / and Would have put and ryuen his sword thorugh his body
/ but anon his arm was dried up / Another was vexed With a devil said that
saint ambrose tormented him / but saint ambrose made him to be stylle / for
ambrose tormenteth none but that does thennye of the / for thou see men
asse^de fro wh^ns you art fallen And that is it which tormenteth the For
ambrose can not be so blown and woe llen as thou art / Then was he stylle
and spoke not / when saint ambrose went in the town / he saw a man laughe by
cause he saw another fall / then said ambrose to him thou that laughest /
beware that thou fall not also / and after he fylle / and thus was he taught
that he should not mocque his felawe / On a time Saint Ambrose went unto the
paleys for to pray for a pour man / but the Judge made to close the gate that
he might not enter in / Then saint ambrose said thou shall come for to enter
in to the church / but thou shall not enter / and yet shall the yates be opene
/ And so it happed that after the Judge doubted his enemies / and went to the
church / but he might not enter in / and yet the yates were opene /

Saint ambrose was of so great abstyence / that he fasted every day / saufe the
sunday or a solemn feste / he was of so great largess that he gave all to
pour people and retained no thing for him self / he was of so great
compassyo^ that when any confessid to him his sin / he wept so bytterly that
he would make the synnar to weep / He was of so great doubt / that when hit was
told to him of the death of any bishop / he would weep so sore / that uneath
he might be comforted / And when it was demanded him why he wept for the
death of good men / For he ought better to make joy by cause they went to
heaven / then he answered I weep not because they goo tofore me but because
that uneath and with great pain may any be found for to do well such
offices / he was of so great stedfanesse and so establysshed in his purpoos /
that he would not leave for dread ne for greef that might be done to him / to
repreue the emperor / ne the other great men when they did things that they
ought not to do / ne he would flatre no man / There was brought ones tofore
him a man / which was grievously mysmade / Then said saint ambrose / the body
must be delyuerd to the devil / And that the flesh goo to the death / by
which the spyrite may be saved / uneath was the word out of his mowthe / but
the devil began to tormente him / After as it is said on a time he went to
rome and when he was on a time by the way herberowed with a rich man / Saint
ambrose began to demand him of his estate / that rich man answered / Sir mine
estate is happy enough and glorious / For I have rychesses enough / servants
/ varlettes / children / neuewes / cosyns / friends / and kynnysmen which
serve me / and al my works and besoynyes come to my will ne I have never
thing that may anger ne trowble me / Then said saint Ambrose to them that
were with him Flee we hens for our lord god is not here / haste you fair
children / haste you and let us abide here no lengyr / lest the vengeance of
god take us / and that we be not wrapped in the sins of these people / They
departed and fled anon / but they were not goon far but that the earth
opened and swolowed in all the hows of this rich man / and there abode not as
much as the step of him self ne of all that ever he had / Then said saint
ambrose be hold fa^e children how great pity and how great mercy god does to
them that have aduersyte in this world / and how wroth he is to them that have
the welthe and rychesses of this world / Of which thing apyereth yet the
pytte or f^sse Which endures in to this day in witness of this adventure /
when Saint ambrose beheld that auaryce which is rote of all euylles grew
more and more in much people / and specially in great men / and in them that
were in most great estate which sold al for money / and with the mynystres
of the church he saw symonye reygne / he began to pray to god / that he would
take him aweye fro the myseryes of this world And he Impetred that which he
desired Then he called his felawshyp and said to them in ioyeng / that he
should abide with them unto the resurrexyon of our lord / and a little tofore
that he lay seek / as he expownded to his notarye the xliiij psalm /
Sodaynlye in the presence and sight of his notary a fire in the manner of a
shield couerd his heed and entryd in to his mouth / Then became his face as
wghyte as any snow / and anon after hit came ageyn to his first form / And
that day he left his writing and endytyng / Then began his maladye to grieve
him / and the earl of ytalye which was then at mylane called the gentyl men
of the contree and said to them that if so great and good a man should goo fro
them it should be great pity / and great parelle to all ytalye / and said to
them that they all should goo with him to this holy man / and pray him that he
would get grant of our lord of space and longer life / when saint ambrose had
herd their request / He answered / fair sons I have not so lived emonge you
/ that I am ashamed to live if hit plese god / ne I have no fere ne dread of
death / for we have a good lord / In this time assemblyd his four dekens / and
began to trete who should be a good bishop after him And they named secretly
emonge them self / that uneath they them self herd hit Symplycien / Saint
ambrose was far fro them / they wend that he might not have herd them / And
he cried on hye thryes he is old / and he is good / when they herd him they
were much abashed / and departed / And sith after his death they chase the
same symplicien / for the good witness that saint ambrose had borne of him / A
bishop which was named honorius that abode the death of saint ambrose slepte /
and herd a voys that thryes called him and said / arise thou up for he shall
goo his way anon / Then he aroos anon hastily and went to melane / and
gave to him the holy sacrament / the precious body of our lord / And anon
saint ambrose leyde his arms in form of a cross / and made his prayers /
and so departed and gave up his ghoost emonge the words of his prayers /
about the year of our lord three hundred lxxx / the vygyle of ester / and when
his body in the night was borne in to the church / many children that were
baptized saw him as they said syttyng in a chayer honowrably / and other
showed him with their fyngres to their fader and other And sum said that they
saw a sterre upon his body / There was a priest that satte at mete with other
/ which said not well of him / but myssayed / but anon god so chastysed him
that he was borne fro the table / and deyed anon after / In the cite of
cartage were three bysshoppes to gyder at dinner and one of them spoke evil by
detraccyon of saint ambrose / And there was a man that told what was befallen
for such langage to this forsaid priest but he mocqued and iaped so much /
that he felt a stroke mortal that / that same day he deyed and was buried / It
is founden written in a cronycle that the Emperor valentynyen was wroth
because that in the cite of thessalonyke the people had stoned to death his Iuges
/ that were sent thither in his name / and for tauenge the same the emperor
did do slay v thousand persons great and little / good and evil and as well
them that had not trespaced as them that had deseruyd hit / And wha^ after this
occysyon he came to melane / and would enter in to the church / Saint abmrose
came against him and defended him thentre / and said to him that after so great
woodnesse / thou ought not to do so great presu^psyon / but perauenture thy
power suffers not the to knowledge thy trespace / hit aperteyneth that reason
surmounte power / thou art emperor / but that is for to punysshe the evil
people / how art thou so hardy to enter so boldly in to the hows of god / whom
thou have horrybly angered / how dare thou with thy feet towche his pamente /
how dare thou stretche thy hands which heen al blody / and of whom the
blood of Innocents run and drop of / By what presumpsion dare thou put
forth thy mowthe to receive the precious body / and blood of our lord / of
which mowthe thou have done the commandment of the devil /

Goo hens goo hens and put not sin upon sin / Take the bond that our lord
has bounden the with / For hit is given to the in way of medecyne / When the
Emperor herd these words he was obedyent / and began to wayle and weep / And
returned in to his paleys / and abode there long weeping / Then Ruffyn the
master of his knights demanded wherefore he so sorewed and Wept / and he
answered Ruffyn thou know not my sorrows / for I see that servants and
pour beggars may enter in to the church / but I may not enter / For ambrose
has excomyned me And he saying this at every word he syghed / Then said
ruffyn to him if thou wylt I shall make him anon to assoyle the / He answered
thou may not / For Ambrose doubts not the force ne the power of the
Emperor / To the end that he hold fermely the law of god / And when Ruffyn
said more and more that he should make him enclyne to assoyle him / Then he
sent him to Ambrose / And the Emperor followed sone after much humbly / When
Saint Ambrose saw Ruffyn come / he said to him thou have no more shame then
an hownde for to do such occision / and now come boldly to me When ruffyn
had prayed long for to assoyle the emperor which came foloweng him / saint
ambrose said to him certeynly I deffende to him the enter in to the chircche /
And if he Will be a tyrant / I will much gladly receive the death / Then
returned Ruffyn to the emperor and recounted to him how he had done / And
the emperor said certeynly I shall goo to him / that I may receive of him
vylonye enough / For it is well right / when he was come to him he demanded of
him absolucion much deuoutelye / Saint ambrose demanded of him what penance
have thou done for so great wickedness The Emperor aledgyd to him that dauyd
had sinned / and after had mercy / Saint ambrose said thou that have followed
him that sinned / follow also him repentaunte / Then said the emperor / it
apperteyneth to the to give and enjoin penance and I shall do hit / Then he
bad him do opene penance and common tofore all the people And the emperor
received hit gladly and refusyd hit not / when the emperor was reconsyled to
the church / he stood in the chauncel / Then said to him saint Ambrose /
what sechest thou here / He answered I am here for to receive the sacred
mysteryes / And ambrose said this place apperteyneth to no man but to priests
/ Goo out / for ye ought to be without the chauncell / And abide there thyth
other / Then obeyed the emperor humbly / and went out / And after when the
Emperor came to Constantynoble / and he stood without with the lay people /
the bishop came and said to him that he should come in to the chauncell with
the clerkys / he answered that he would not / For he had learned of Saint Ambrose
what dyfference there was between on Emperor and a priest / I have found a
man of truth my master ambrose and such a man ought to be a bishop

Thus ends the life of saint Ambrose The life of the saints tyburce and
Ualerian been contained in the life of Cecyle vyrgyn and marter

The life of saint Alphey bishop and marter
Saint Alphey the holy bishop and Marter was borne in england in the shyre of
Gloucestre / and he came of a noble kynne / And was his faders heir / but he
forsook all for gods love / And bycame a manke at derherste / five mile from
Gloucestre / but afterward good king Edward gave that hows of derherst to the
hows of saint denis in france / And wha^ saint alphey had been monk there long
time living a full holy life then he went fro thens to the abbey of bathe / to
be there in more contemplacyon and rest of soul / And he bylded there that
fair abbey / and establisshed therein black monks and endowed it / And was him
self therein the first abbot and founder / And he ladde there a full holy life /
and much well he guyded the monks in holy and virtuous living / And that time
was Saint dunstone bishop of caunterburye / and saint ethelwold bishop of
wynchester but within short time after saint ethelwold deyed / And then
saint Andrewe apperyd to saint dunston in a night and bad him arise anon / and
make Alphey abbot of bathe bishop of wynchester / and so hit was done with
great solempnytee / Like as our lord by his holy apostle saint andrew had
commanded / and he was bishop there xxxij year in full holy living / And after
that he was made archebysshop of cau^terburye after saint dunstone / And thereto
he was chosen by the pope / and by all the clergy of England in the year of
our lord a Mvj year / And vj year he was bishop of caunterburye / And in the
vij year came a wicked tyrant out of denmarcke in to this land of England
whose name was Edrithe with a great multitude of danes / And they burnt and
robbed in every place where they came / And slew many lords of the land and
many of the common people / And that time was etheldrede king of england / and
saint edward the marter was his brother / And saint edward the confessor his
sone / the which lies at westmestre /

And in this time the danes did much harm in this land / The chyef prince of
them hight kyrkyl / and his brother erdrythe was leder of thoost / they did full
great persecucion / For there was none that might resyste ne wythstond them /
for king etheldrede was a meke man / and took none head to help his people /
And Erdrythe with the danes went to caunterburye / and there he did much
wickedness to the people and brent and destroyed all that he might find But at
the last he was slain by men of caunterburye / and when the prince kyrkyl wist
that he was slain / He was much angry / And in great haste he came to
caunterburye and byseged the town / and anon he gate it / and burnt and
destroyed all that he might And this holy bishop saint Alphey came to the
prince of the danes / and prayed him to take his body and spare the pour people
of the town / but for all that / he slew monks priests and all that he
might find / And he tythed the monks / he slew ix monks and saved the
tenthe / and yet he thought there were over many on live / And began to tithe
them ageyn / and then saint alphey repreuyd them for their cursyd doings /
and then anon they took saint alphey the holy man and bound his hondes
behind him / and they led him with them fro thens unto the town of
grenewytche beside london / and there they put him in prison half a year and
more / and the friday in thester weke the devil apperyd to this holy man in the
prison in likeness of an aungel / and said unto him that it was our lords
will that he should goo out of prison and follow him / and this holy man
byleuyd him and went out and followed the wicked aungel / by night / and he
brought this holy man in to a derke valey / and there he Waded over waters and
dyches / myres and hedges / and ever this holy man followed him as he might for
werynes / till at last he had brought him in to a foul mire that was set
about with great waters / and there the devil left him and vanysshed aweye /
and then this holy man wyste well that he was deceived by his enemy the fend
/ And then he cried god mercy and prayed him of help /

And then our lord sent to him his holy Angel / and aided him out of the
mire and water / and said it was the will of god that he should return ageyn
to prison that he came fro / For to morrow shall thou suffer marterdom for our
lords sake / as he went ageyn toward the prison at grenewitche / erly by the
morrow his kepars that had sought him all the night / met him and anon they
cast him down to the ground and there they wounded him full pytouslye / And
then they brought him ageyn to prison / and they made therein a great
smolderyng of smoke / for to disease him / and then saint dunstone apperyd to
him / and bad him be of good comfort / For our Lord has ordained for the a
glorious crown / And as they spoke to gyder his bonds brake / and al his
wounds were made hole ageyn thorugh the mercy of our lord Ihesu / And when his
kepars saw this / they dredde full sore And anon this miracle was known to
the people / And they went then fast to see him / and the Iuges doubted the
great people that came thither / And they took him out of prison / and ladde him
to that place where he should be marterd / but the pour people made great
lamentacion for him / But anon the wicked tormentours stoned him to death like
as the Jews did saint stephen / And when he was almost deed one there was
that was his godsone which with an axe smote him on the heed that he fyl to
the ground and then rendered up his spyrite to our lord Ih^u criste / And
then these wicked tyrauntes threw the holy body in to a deep water / that
good men should not find hit / But by the purueaunce of our lord within short
time after he was found of the true christian men And they repreuyd gretely
these wicked tyrauntes / and they began then to scorn the holy body and one
of hem took an old roten stake or tree / and pyghte hit in the earth / and
said if this stake bear flowers by to morrow we will repent us and believe that
he is an holy man / or else we will never believe hit / And on the morn they
fond the stake grene and bare leuys / And when they saw this great miracle /
they believed in god / and kyssed the feet of this holy saint / and repented
them full sore of their wicked deeds / and cried full mekely god mercy and this
holy saint Alphey /

And after he was brought to london with great worship / and buried in the
church of Saint Paul with great reverence / And there his body lay buried
many year / And afterward hit was taken up and translated to caunterburye / and
his bones there leyed in a worshypful fiertre or shryne / where our lord
shows daily many fair miracles / for his holy marter Saint Alphey / And the
tormentours that repentyd them not / deyed anon after in great myserye in
diverse wyses for to be punysshed as hit plesyd our lord / Then let us pray
to this blessed marter and archebysshop saint alphey / that he be moyen unto
our lord Ihesu Christ that we may come to his everlasting bliss in heaven AMEN
/

Thus ends the life of Saint Alphey marter
Of saint George martyr and first of thynterpretacyon of his name
GEorge is said of Geos which is as much to say as earth and orge / that is
tylyeng / so george is to say as tylyeng therthe that is his flesh / And
saint Austyn says in lybro de trinitate that good earth is in the heyght of
the mou^tayns in the temperaunce of the valeyes / and in the plain of the
feldes / The first is good for herbys being grene / The second to vygnes / and
the third to whete and corn / Thus the blessed George was high in despysyng
low things / and therefore he had verdour in him self / He was attemperate by
dyscressyon / and therefore he had wyn of gladness / and within he was plain
of humylite / and thereby put he forth whete of good work / Or george may be
said of gera that is holy / and of gyon that is a wrasteler / that is as an
holy wrasteler / For he wrastled with the dragon /

Or hit is said of George that is a pilgrim / and geyr / that is or detrenchyd
out / and us / that is a cou^ceyllour / He was a pilgrim in the sight of the
World / and he was cut and detrenched by the crown of martirdom and he was a
good counceyllour in prechyng / And his legende is nombred emonge other
scriptures apocryfate in the counceyl of nycene / by cause his marterdom has
no certain relacion For in the calendar of bid it is said that he suffered
marterdom in parsydye in the cite of dyapolin / And in other places hit is
read that he restyth in the cite of dyspolyn / which tofore was called lyde /
which is by the cite of Ioppem or Iaph / And in another place hit is said that
he suffered death under dyoclesian / and Maxymyan / which that time were
Emperors / And in another place under Dioclesian / Emperor of Perse being
present lxx kings of his empire / And it is said here that he suffered death
under dacyen the prouoste / Then Dioclesyan and Maxymyan being emperors /

Here follows the life of saint George martyr
Saint George was a knight and borne in capodose / On a time he came in to the
prouynce of Lybye to a cite which is said Sylene / And by this cite was a
stagne or a ponde like a see / wherein was a dragon which enuenymed all the
contre / And on a time the people were assemblid for to slay him / And when they
saw him they fled / And when he came nyghe the cytee / he venymed the people
with his breeth / And therefore the people of the cytee gave to him every day two
sheep for to feed him / by cause he should do no harm to the people / And when
the sheep failed there was taken a man and a sheep /

Then was an ordenaunce made in the town / that there should be taken the
children and young people of them of the town by lotte /

And eueryche as it fyl were he gentil or pour should be delyuerd when the
lotte fyl on him or her / So it happed that many of them of the town were
then delyuerd / In so much that the lotte fyl upon the kings daughter /
Wherrof the king was sorry and said unto the people /

For the love of the gods take gold and silver and all that I have / and
let me have my daughter / they said how sir ye have made and ordained the law
/ and our children been now deed / And now ye would do the contrary / your
daughter shall be given / or else we shall brenne you and your hows when the
king saw he might no more do he began to weep and said to his daughter / Now
shall I never see thyn espousayls / Then returned he to the people and
demanded viij days respyte And they granted hit to him / and when the viij
days were passed they came to him and said / thou see that the cite
perissheth / Then did the king do array his daughter / like as she should be
wedded / and enbraced her kyssed her and gave her his benedyccion / And after
led her to the place where the dragon was / when she was there / saint george
passed by / And when he saw the lady / he demanded the lady what she made
there / And she said / goo ye your way fair young man / that ye perysshe not
also / Then said he tell to me what have ye / and why ye weep / and doubt
ye of no thing / when she saw that he would know she said to him how she was
delyuerd to the dragon / Then said saint george / Fair daughter doubt ye no
thing hereof / For I shall help the in the name of Ihesu Christ / She said for
gods sake good knight goo your way / and abide not with me / for ye may not
deliver me / Thus as they spoke to gyder the dragon apperyd and came rennyng to
them and saint George was upon his horse and drew out his sword and garnysshed
him with the sign of the cross / and rode hardely against the dragon which
came toward him and smote him with his spear and hurt him sore and threw him
to the ground / And after said to the maid / deliver to me your gyrdel and
bind hit about the neck of the dragon / and be not aferde / when she had done
so the dragon followed her as it had been a make be and debonayr / Then
she led him in to the cite / and the people fled by mountayns and valeyes /
and said / alas / alas / we shall be all deed / Then saint George said to
them / ne doubt ye no thing / without more believe ye in god Ihesu christ /
and do you to be baptized / and I shall slay the dragon / Then the king was
baptized and al his people / and saint george slew the dragon and smote of his
heed / And commanded thathe should be thrown in the feldes / and they took
iiij carts with oxen that drew him out of the cite / Then were there well
fystene thousand men baptized without wymmen and children / And the king did
do make a church there of our lady and of saint George / In the which yet
sourdeth a founteyn of living water which heleth seek people that drink thereof
/ After this the king offered to Saint george as much money as there might be
nombred / but he refused all and commanded that it should be given to pour
people for gods sake / and enjoined the king iiij things / that is / that he
should have charge of the chyrches / and that he should honor the priests /
and here their service dylygently / and that he should have pity on the pour
people / And after kyssed the king and departed /

Now hit happed that in the time of dyoclesyen and maxymyen which were
Emperors / was so great persecucion of christian men / that within a month
were marterd well xxij / thousand / And therefore they had so great dread that
sum renyed and forsook god and did sacrefyse to the ydolles / when saint
george saw this he left thabbyte of a knight / and sold all that he had /
and gave hit to the pour / and took thabbyte of a christian man and went in to
the mydel of the paynyms / And began to cry / all the gods of the paynyms and
gentyls been deuyls / My god made the heuens and is very god Then said the
provost to him of what presumpcion comes this to the / that thou say that
our gods ben deuyls and say to us what thou art / and what is thy name / he
answered anon and said / I am named george / I am a gentyl man a knight of
capadoce / and have left al for to serve god of heaven Then the prouoste
enforced him sefl to draw him unto his feythe by fair words / and when he
might not bring him thereto / he did do reyse him on a gylet / and so much
beat him with great staves and broches of iron / that his body was all to
broken in pyeces / And after he did do take brondes of iron and join them to
his sides and his bowellys which then appyeryd he did do frote with salt /
And so sent him in to prison / but our loord appyered to him the same night
with great light and comforted him much swetely / And by this great
consolacion he took to him so good heart / that he doubted no torment that
they might make him suffer / Then when dacian the provost saw that he might
not surmounte him / he called his enchaunter and said to him / I see that these
christian people doubt not our torments / Thenchau^tour bond him self upon his
heed to be smyten of / if he overcome not his crafts / Then he did take
strong venym and meddled hit with wine / and made Inuocacion of the names of
his false gods / and gafe hit to Saint George to drink / Saint george took
hit and made the sign of the cross on hit / and anon drank it without
greuyng him any thing / Then the Enchaunteur made it more stronger than hit
was tofore of venym and gave it him to drink / And hit greuyd him no thing /
when the enchaunteur saw that / he knelyd down at the feet of saint george /
and prayed him that he would make him christian / And when dacyen knew that he
was becomen christian / he made to smite of his heed / And after on the morn he
made saint George to be set between two wheles which were full of swerdes
sharp and cuttyng on both sides But anon the wheles were broken / and Saint
george escaped without hurt And then commanded dacian that they should put
him in a cawdren full of molten leed / and when saint george entered therein / by
the virtue of our lord him seemed that he was in a bayne well at ease / Then
dacyen seeing this / began to aswage his ire and to flatre him by fair words /
and said to him George the pacyence of our gods is over great unto the /
which have blasphemyd them / and done to them great despyte / then fair and
right sweet sone / I pray the that thou return to our law and make sacrefyse
to the ydolles / and leave thy folly / and I shall enhaunce the to great honor
and worship / Then began saint George to smyle and said to him / wherefore
saydest thou not to me thus at the beginning / I am ready to do as thou say /
Then was dacyan glad / and made to cry over all the town that all the
people should assemble for to see George make sacrefyse / which so much had
stryued there against /

Then was the cite arrayed / and feste thorugh out all the town / and al came
to the temple for to see him / when saint George was on his knees / and they
supposed that he would have worshypped thydolles / he prayed our lord god of
heaven that he would destroy the temple and thydolle in the honor of his name
/ For to make the people to be converted / And anon the fire descended fro
heaven and burnt the temple and thydolles and their priests / And sithe the
earth opened and swalowed all the cendres and ashes that were left / Then
dacien made him to be brought tofore him and said to him / what ben the evil
deeds that thou have done / and also great untruth / Then said to him saint
george / A sir believe it not / but come with me and see how I shall sacrefye /
Then said dacyan to him / I see well thy frawde and thy barate / thou wylt
make the earth to swalowe me / like as thou have the temple and my gods /

Then said saint george / O caytyffe tell me how may thy gods help the
when they may not help them self / Then was dacyan so angry that he said to
his wife / I shall deye for anger if I may not surmounte and overcome this man /
Then said she to him evil and cruel tyrant ne see thou not the great
virtue of the christian people I said to the well that thou sholdest not do to
them any harm / For their god fyghteth for them / And know thou well that I
will become christian / Then was dacy^n much abashed / and said to her wylt
thou be christian / then he took her by the here / and did do beat her cruelly
/ Then demanded she of saint george / what may I become by cause I am not
crystenyd / Then answered the blessed george / doubt the no thing fair
daughter / For thou shall be baptized in thy blood / Then began she to
worship our lord Ih^u crist and so she deyed and went to heaven / On the morn
dacian gave his sentence that saint George should be drawn thorugh all the
city / And after his heed should be smyten of / Then made he his prayer to
our lord / that all they that desired any bone might get of our lord god in
his name / and a voys came from heaven which said / that hit which he had
desired was granted and after he had made his oryson / his heed was smyten of
about the year of our lord ijClxxxvij / When Dacyen went homeward fro the
place where he was byheded toward his paleys / Fire fyl down fro heaven upon him
/ and burnt him and all his servants Gregore of Turonense tells that
there were sum that bare certain relyques of saint george / and came in to a
certain oratorye in an hospytal / and on the morning when they should depart
they could not meue the door till they had left there part of their relyques
It is also founden in thystorye of antyoche / that when the christian men went
over see to co^quere Iherusalem / that one a right fair young man appeared to a
priest of the hooste / and counceylled him that he should bear with him a little
of the relics of saint george / For he was conduytour of the battle / and so
he did so much that he had sum / And when hit so was that they had assyeged
Iherusalem / and durst not mou^te ne goo up on the walls for the quarellys and
defense of the sarasyns / they saw appertely saint george which had white
arms with a reed cross that went up tofore them on the walls / and they
followed him / And so was Jerusalem taken / by his help / and between
Iherusalem and port Iaphe by a town called ramys is a chapel of saint george
/ which is now desolate and vncouerd / and therein dwell christian grekys / And
in the said chapel lies the body of saint george / but not the heed And there
lain his fader and mother and his uncle not in the chapel / but under the wall
of the chapel / And the kepars will not suffer pilgrims to come therein but if
they pay ij duckettis / and therefore come but few therein but offer without
the chapel at an altar / And there is seven year and seven lentys of pardon /
and the body of saint george lies in the myddel of the autre or chore of the
said chapel / And in his tomb is an hole that a man may put in his hand / And
when a sarazyn being mad is brought thither / and if he put his heed in the
hoole / he shall anon be made parfytely hoool / and have his wit ageyn / This
blessed and holy marter saint George is patron of this royame of england / and
the cry of men of war / In the worship of whom is founded the noble order
of the garter / And also a noble college in the castle of wyndesore / by
kings of england / In which college is the heart of Saint george / Which
Sygysmond the Emperor of almayn brought and gafe for a great and a precious
relyque to King Harry the fyfthe / And also the said sygismonde was a brother of
the said garter / And also there is a pyece of his heed which college is nobly
endowed to thonoure and worship of almighty god / and his blessed marter saint
george / Then let us pray unto him that he be special protector and
defendour of this royame /

thus ends the life of saint George
Here follows of saint mark theuangelyst and first thynterpretacion of his
name
Mark is as much to say as hye to commandment certain / declyned and
bitter he was hye of commandment by reason of perfeccion in his life / For he
kept not only the commandments common / but also the hye as been
counceylles / he was certain in the doctrine of the gospel / like as he had
received of saint Peter his master / he was declyned by reason of parfyte and
great humylite / For because of great mekenes / he cut of his thombe / to the
end that he should not be chosen to be a priest / He was bitter by reason of
right sharp and bitter pain / For he was drawn thorugh the cite / And emonge
tho torments / he gave up his spyrite Or mark is said of a great mayleot or
betel / which with one stroke makes plain iron / and engenders melodye and
confermeth it / For Saint mark by his only doctrine quenched the
unsteadfastness of the heretykes / he engendryd the great melodye of the
praisyng of god and co^fermed the church

Of Saint mark the Euangelyste
Mark theuangeliste was of the kynrede of the leuytes / and was a priest / And
when he was crystened he was godsone of saint Peter thappostle / And therefore
he went with him to Rome / When Saint peter preched there the gospel the good
people of Rome prayed saint mark / that he would put the gospel in writing like
as saint Peter had preched / Then he at their request wrote / and showed hit
to his master saint peter to examyne / And when saint Peter had examyned hit /
and saw that hit contained ye very troth he approuyd hit / And commanded
that hit should be read at rome / And then saint Peter seeing saint mark
constaunt in the feythe / he sent him in to aquyle for to preche the feyth of
Ihesu christ / where he preached the word of god / and did many miracles / and
converted Innumerable multitude of people to the feythe of christ / And wrote
also to them the gospel / like as he did to them of Rome / which is in to this
day kept in the church of aquylence / and with great devotion kept / After
this it happed that saint mark ladde with him to Rome a bourgeys of that same
cite whom he had converted to the faith / named armogares / And brought him
to saint Peter / and prayed him that he would sacre him bishop of aquyle / and
so he did / Then this armogares when he was bishop he governed much holyly
the church / And at the last the paynyms marterd him /

Then Saint Peter sent saint mark in to alyxandrye / where as he preached
first the word of god / And as soon as he was entered a great multitude of people
assembled for to come ageynste him / There was he of so great perfeccion / that
by his predycacion / and by his good exaumples the pepl^ mounted in so holy
conversation / and in so great devotion / that at his Instaunce they led
their life like monks / He was of so great humylyte / that he did cut of his
thombe / by cause he would be no priest / For he Iuged him self not worthy
thereto / but the ordenaunce of god and of saint peter came ageynste his will /
For saint Peter made and sacred him bishop of alyxandrye / And anon as he
came in to alexandre his shoen were broken and torn / when he saw that he
said / verayly I see that my journey is sped / ne the devil may not let me /
sith that god has assoyled me of my sins / Then went saint mark to a
shomaker for tamende his shoes / And as he should work he prycked and sore
hurted his lift hand with his all / and when he felt him hurt he cried on
hye one god / when saint mark herd that / he said to him Now know I well that
god has made my journey prosperyous / Then he took a little claye and spyttel
and meddled them to gyder / and laid hit on the wound / and anon he was hole
/ when the shomaker saw this miracle he brought him in to his hows / and
demanded him what he was and fro whens he come / Then said Saint mark that
he was the servant of Ihesu christ / and he said I would feign see him / Then
said saint mark I shall show him to the / then he began to preche to him the
faith of Ih^u crist and after baptized him and all his meyne / when the men
of the town herd say that there was a man comen fro galylee / that despised
and defended the sacrefyses of thydolles / they began awayte how they might
deliver him to death / when saint mark espied that he made his shoemaker
which was named auien bishop of alixaundre / And he him self went to
pentepolyn / where as he was two year / and after came ageyn to alyxaunder /
and found then there the town full of christian men / And the bysshoppes of
thydolles awayted for to take him / Now hit happened on ester day when saint
mark song mass / they assembled al / and put a cord about his neck and
after drew him thorugh out the cite / and said let us draw bubale to the
place of bucale / and the blood ran upon the stones / and his flesh was
torn pyece mele that it lay upon the pamente all be bledde / After this they
put him in prison / where an aungel came and comforted him / and after came our
lord for to vysyte and comfort him saying / Pax tibi marce euangelista meus /
Pees be to the mark mine euangeliste / be not in doubt / For I am with the /
and shall deliver the / And on the morn they put the cord about his neck /
and drew him like as they had done tofore / And cried draw the bubale / and
when they had drawn / he thanked god and said in to thy hands lord I
commend my spyryte / and he thus saying deyed / Then the paynyms would have
brent his body / but the eyer began suddenly to change / and to hayle lyghtene
and thonder / in such wise that every man enforced him to flee / And left
there the holy body allone /

Then came the christian men and bare hit aweye / and buried hit in the church
with great joy honor and reverence / This was in the year of our lord lvij
in the time that nero was emperor / And it happed in the year of grace iiij
ho^dred lxvj in the time of leon the emperor that the venycyens translated the
body of saint mark fro alysaunder to venyse in this manner / there were two
merchants of venyse did so much what by prayer and by their yeftes to two
priests that kept the body of saint mark / that they suffered it to be borne
secretelye and pryuelye unto their ships / And as they took hit out of the
tomb / there was so sweet an adoure thorugh out all the cytee of Alexaunder
that all the people meruayled / ne knew not fro whens hit came then the
merchants brought hit to the ship / and after hasted the maronners / And
let the other ships have knowledge thereof / Then there was one man in
another ship / that Iaped and said wene ye to carye aweye the body of saint
mark / nay ye led with you an egypcien / Then anon after this word / the
ship wherein the holy body was turned lightly after him / And so rudely
borded the ship of him that had said that word that he brake one of the sides
of the ship / and would never leave hit in pees / till they had confessed that
the body of saint mark was in the ship That done she held her stylle / thus
as they sailed fast they took none head / and the eyer began to wexe derke and
thycke that they wyste not wh^re they were / Then apperyd Saint mark unto a
monk / to whom the body of saint mark was delyuerd to keep / and badde him
anon to stryke their sails for they were nygh land / and he did so / and
anon they fond land in an isle / and by all the ryuages where as they passed /
it was said to them that they were well happy that they led so noble a
tresoure as the body of Saint mark / and prayed them that they would let them
worship hit / yet there was a maro^ner that might not believe that it was the
body of Saint Mark but the devil entered in to him / and tormented him so
long that he could not be delyuerd till he was brought to the holy body / and
as soon as he confessyd / that hit was the body of Saint mark / he was delyuerd
of the wicked spyryte / And ever after he had great devotion to saint mark It
happed after that the body of saint mark was closed in a pyler of marble and
right few people knew thereof by cause it should be secretly kept / Then it
happed that they that knew thereof deyed / and there was none that knew where
this great tresour might be / wherefore the clerks and the lay people were
gretely dyscomforted and wept for sorrow / and doubted much that it had be
stolen away / Then made they solemn processyons and letanyes / and the
people began to fast and be in prayers / And al suddenly the stones opened and
showed to all the people the place and stead where the holy body restyd /
Then rendered they thankynges to god / of this that he had releuyd them of
their sorrow and anguysshe / And ordained that on that day they shall hold
feste alleweye for this devout reuelacyon /

A young man on a time had a cancre in his breast / and worms ete hit / which
were come of rotyng / and as he was thus tormented / he prayed with good heart
to saint mark and required him of help and aid / and after he slepte And
that same time apperyd to him saint mark in form of a pilgrim / tucked and
made ready for to goo hastily over see / and when he demanded him what he was /
he answered that he was saint mark / which went hastily for to socoure a ship
which is in parelle / Then he stratched and leyde his hand on him / and
anon as he awoke / he fond him self all hole Anon after this ship came
unto the port of venyse / and the maronners told the peril where they h^d
ben in and how saint mark had help them then for that one miracle / and for
that other the people rendered thankynges to our lord /

The merchants of venyse went on a time by the sea in a ship of sarazyns
toward Alexaunder / And they saw them in parelle they hew the cords of the
ship / and anon the ship began to break by the force of the sea / And all
the sarezyns that were therein fyl in the sea and deyed that one after that
other / Then one of the sarezyns made his auowe to saint mark and promised
him that if he delyuerd him fro this p^r^lle he would be baptized / Anon a man
al shynyng apperyd to him which took him out of the water / and remysed him
ageyn in to the ship / and anon the tempest cesed / when he was comen in to
alexandrye he remembryd no thing saint marcke which had delyuerd him fro
parille he went not to vysyte him ne he did him not do be baptized / Then
apperyd to him saint mark and said to him that he remembryd evil the bountee
that he did to him / when he delyuerd him fro the parelle of the sea / and
anon the sarazyn came ageyn to his conscience / and he went to venyse and was
there baptized and named mark / and byleued parfitely in god / and ended his
life in good works / There was a man gone up in the steple of saint mark at
venyse / and as he intended for to do a work / and was troubled in such wise
that he fyl and was like to have be al to broken in his membris / nevertheless
in his falling he cried saint mark / and anon he rested upon a branch that
sprange out / whereof he took none head / And after one raughte and let him
down a cord / by which he aualed down and was saved /

There was a gentyl man of prouynce which had servant that would feign goo on
pylgremage to saint mark / but he could get no license of his lord At last
he doubted not to anger his lord / but went thither much deuoutely And when
his lord knew hit he bare hit much grievously / and as soon as he was comen
ageyn / his lord commanded that his eyes should be put out / and the other
servants that were ready to do the lords will / made ready sharp brochettes
of iron / and enforced them with all their power and might not do hit / Then
commanded the lord to hew of his thyes with axes / but anon the iron was as
soft as molten leed Then commanded he to break his tethe with iron hamers /
but the iron thereof was so soft that they could do him no harm / Then when
the lord saw the virtue of god so openly by the miracles of saint mark he
demanded pardon and went to be nyse to saint mark with his seruau^te There
was a knight on a time so hurt in battle / that his hand hynge on the arm
/ in such wise that his friends and surgyens counceylled him to cut it of /
but he that was acustomed to be hoole / was ashamed to be maimed / and made hit
to be bound in his place / and after he called much deuoutely to saint mark
/ and anon his hand was as hole as it had been tofore And in the witness of
this miracle a sign of the cuttyng abode stylle / Another time there was a
knight armed which ran vpan a bridge / and his horse and he fyl in a deep
water / and when he saw he might not es^^pe be cried on saint mark / and anon
he raughte him a spear by which he was saved / and for this cause he came
anon in pylgremage to venyse and told this miracle /

There was a man taken by envy of them that hated him and was put in prison /
And when he had been there xl days and was much greuyd / he cried on saint
mark / And when saint mark had apperyd thryse / he supposed that it had be a
fantasye / at last he felt his yrons broken as it had been a roten threde /
and passyd by the kepars of the prison openly by day / he seeing them al / but
none of them saw him / and after came to the church of saint mark / and
thanked god deuoutelye / It happed in poylle was great famyne and the land was
bareyn that no thing might grow thereon / Then was hit showed by reuelacion
to an holy man / that it was because that they hallowed not the feste of saint
mark / And when they knew this anon they hallowed the feste of saint mark /
And anon began to grow great plente of goods thorugh out all the contree

It happed at papye in the couente of the freres prechours in the year of our
lord MijCxlj / that a friar a much relygyous man was seek unto the death named
Iulyanus / which sent for his pryour for to demand him in what state he was
in / and he told him that he was in peril of death / and that it approached
fast / And anon his face was al bright and ioyeful / and with gladness he
began to say / fair brethern my sawle shall depart anon / Make rome and place
for my soul ioyeth in my body for the good tidings that I have herd / And
lift up his eyes into heaven and said lord god take aweye my soul out of this
prison / and after he said alas who shall deliver me fro this corrupt and
mortal body / Emonge these words he fyl in a sight sleep / and saw saint
mark come to kym and stondyng by his beds side and he herd a voys saying to
him / O mark what make thou here / he answered that he was come to vysyte
this friar because he should deye / Then he demanded him woherfore he came
more then another saint / he answered / by cause he had a specyal devotion to
me and because he has often deuoutely vysyted my church / And therefore am I
come to vysyte him in the hour of his death / Then entryd in to that place
great plente of people all white / to whom saint mark demanded wherefore
they were comen / And they said and answered that they were comen for to
present the soul of this brother tofore god / and when the friar was waked /
he sent for the pryour / and told to him aduysedly all this vysyon and after
anon in the presence of the pryour he deyed with great joy / And all this
the pryour recounted to him that wrote this book named Legenda aurea /

Thus ends the life of Saint mark theuangelyste
Here follows of saint Marcelyn the pope
Saint marcelyn was pope of rome by the space of ix year and four months / In
his time reigned dyoclesyan and maxymyan emperors of rome / the which
commanded that he should be taken and brought in to the temple for to do
sacrefyse to the ydolles / and when he Would not assente the mynystres of
themperours menaced him that they would make him deye by diverse torments / And
when he herd that / he had so great dread that he put in their sacrefyse two
graynes of en^^nce only / whereof the paynyms had great joy / And the christian
men had right great sorrow / and reprehended him gretely of that he had such a
thing done against the christian feythe and anon he repented him and put him
self to the Judgment of the bysshoppes But the bysshoppes answered god forbede
that it never fall / that the pope of the christian people which is souerayn /
be Iuged of any man / but be he Iuged of him self / and anon he deposyd him
self / and after the christian men chosen him ageyn to be pope as he Was tofore
/ And when this came to the knowledge of themperours / then they did do take
him / and because that he would in no wise do sacrefyse to the ydolles / they
made to smite of his heed And then the persecucion and wodenes was so great
of the paynyms ageynste the christian people / that within a month after Were
put to death for the name of Ihesu christ and for to sustain the christian faith
/ well a xvijM christian people / Marcelyn in the hour that he should be beheded
said tofore all the people / that he was not worthy to be buried emonge christian
people / and therefore he commanded upon pain of cursyng that none should burye
his body / and so the body of him abode above the earth xxxv days without
buryeng / After saint Peter thappostle apperid to marcel / which Was pope
after marcellyn and said to him in this manner Marcel fair fader why buryest
thou not me / And he answered sir be ye not long sithe buried / And Saint Peter
said / I hold me not buried as long as I see marcellyn not buried / and the
pope answered how sir / know not ye how he acursyd all them that burye him /
and saint Peter said / is it not wreten that he that meketh him self shall be
enhaunced / this sholdest thou have thought / Goo then and burye him at my
feet / And anon the pope did his commandment / and buried the body of saint
marcellyn hastelye / Which was marterd the year of our lord ijC and lxxx year
/ Then pray we to him that he pray for us /

Thus ends the life of saint marcellyn the pope
Of saint vytal marter and first of thynterpretacyon of his name
UYtal is as much to say / as such one living / for he lived without forth
like as he was in his heart within / Or vytal is as much to say as life / Or
vytal is to say fleyng With wings / or fleyng him self with Wings of virtues
he was as one of the bestes that ezechyel saw having in him self four wings /
the wynge of hope by which he flewe in to heaven / The wynge of love by which
he flewe to god / The wynge of dread by which he flewe to hell / and the
wynge of knowledge by which he flewe to him self / And it is supposed that his
passion is founden in the book of geruase and prothase /

Of saint vytal
Saint Vytal was a knight and a consul and of valeria his wife he gate saint
geruase and saint prothase / he went to rauenne with paulyne that was Judge of
the contree / and when he came thither and saw that this paulyne made a
physicien named vrsianum to suffer many torments because he would not renye his
feythe / and at the last when they would have byheded him / he was so a frayed
that he would have renyed god /

Then / said saint vytal to him / Havrsyan do not so / thou were wont to
hele other / and now wylt deliver thy self to perdurable death / Thou were come
to the vyctorye / now thou art in peril to lose thy crown / which was ready
for the / when this physycien had herd these words / he was al recomforted /
and repentyd of his evil purpoos / and suffered gladly marterdom And saint vytal
did do burye him much honorably / ne never after would saint vytal not goo in
the company of the Judge paulyn / Then he had so great Indygnacion of that he
had d^fended vrsyan to make sacrefyse / and of this that he daygned not to come
to him / And because he showed him a christian man / he did him to be hanged by
the arms on a gybette / Then said to him vytal / thou art ouermoche a fool
/ if thou wene to dysceyue me / which have alweye delyuerd the other / Then
said paulyn bring him for to do sacrefyse / And if he do hit not / make a
deep py^t^ unto the water / and put his heed there under / and so they did and
there buried him quycke in the year of our lord lvij / And the priest of
thydolles that had given this counceyl was anon taken of the devil and cried
vij days contynuel and said / Saint vytal thou brennest me / and the seventh
day the devil threw him in the river and there deyed shamefully / And the wife
of saint vytal when she came to melane / she fond there of her people
sacrefyeng thydolles / which prayed her to ete with them of their sacrefyses /
to whom she answered I am a christian woman / and it is not lawful to me to ete
of your sacrefyses / Then they heeryng that / beat her so long and so sore
that they left her fordeed / And her men that were with her brought her to
melane half living and there the third day she deyed holy And the body of
saint vytal lies now at coleyn in the church of our lady /

Thus ends The life of saint Vytal
Here follows The life of saint Peter of mylane and first thynterpretacion of
his name
PEter is as much to say as knowing / or vnhosyng / or peter is said of
petros that is constaunte and ferme / and by that been vnderstonden three
preuyleges / that Were in saint Peter / he was a much noble prechour / and
therefore he is said knowing / For he had perfyte knowledge of scripture / and
knew in his predycacion what was behofful to eueryche / Secondly he was pure
and a vyrgyn / and therefore he was said vnhosyng / For he vnhosed and did of
his will fro his feet / and despoyled al mortal love in so much that he was a
vyrgyn / and not only of body / but also of mind / Thyrdly he was a marter
glorious of our lord / and therein he was constaunte and ferme to the end that
he should suffer stedfastlye marterdom for the deffence of the feythe /

Of saint peter of melane
Saint Peter the new marter of thordre of the friar prechours was borne in the
cite of veronne in lombardye / his fader and mother were of the sect of
tharryens / Then he descendyd of these people like as the rose that comes of
the thorn / and as the light that comes of the smoke / At the eage of vij
year when he learned at the scole his credo / One his eme which was an heretyke
demanded of him his lesson / and the child said to him credo / till to
creatorem celi et terre / his uncle said to him that he shald no more say so /
for god has not made temporal things / the child affermed that he ought to
say none otherwise but so as he had learned / and that other began to show
him by auctorytre his purpoos but the child which was full of the holy ghoost
answered so well and wisely / that his uncle departed al confus / and all
achauffed said to the fader that he should take aweye his sone fro scole / for
he doubted when he shall be great that he should turn against their law and
feyth and that he should confound them / and so it happed / and so he
prophesied like as cayphas did / but god against whom none may do would not
suffer it for the great prouffite that he attended of him Then after when he
came to more eage / he saw that it was no sure thing to dwell with the
scorpyons / he had in despyte fader and mother and left the world / whiles he
was a clear and a pure vyrgyn / he entered in to thordre of the friar prechours
/ there where as he lived much holyly the space of xxx year / or theraboute
full of al virtues / and especyal in deffendyng the feythe For love of which he
burnt / he did much abstynence for to bring his flesh low / he fasted /
he intended to wake by night in studyeng and in prayer when he should have
slepte and rested / And by day he intended to the prouffyte of the sowles / in
prechyng in confessyng / and in counceyllyng / in desputyng ageynste the
heretykes and arryens / And in that he had a specyal grace of Ihesu christ /
For he was right sore founded in humylyte / he was merueylously pyteous and
debonayre full of compassyon / of gret^ pacyence / of great charity / and of
steadfastness / So ripe and so w^l ordained in fair manner / That every man
might behold as in a myrrour in his contynence and in his conuersacyon / He
was wise and dyscrete / and so enprented in his heart that all his words
were ferme and stable / Then he prayed many times to our lord / that he would
not let him deye but by suffrance of marterdom for him and for his faith /

And thus as he prayed god accomplysshed in the end / He did many miracles in
his life / For in the cytee of melane / on a time when he examyned a bishop of
the Arryens that the christian men had taken / and many bysshoppes /

relygyous and great plentee of other people of the cite were there assembled
and was then right h^te /

This arryan said to saint Peter / tofore them al / O thou peter perverse if
thou art so holy / as this people holds the fore / wherefore suffrest thou
this folysshe people deye for hete / and prayest not god that he would shadow
them Then saint peter answered and said if thou wylt promise that thou shall
hold the very feythe / and thou wylt love thyn heresye / I shall pray
therefore to our lord / then al they that were on the party of the arryens
cried that he should promise him / for they supposed that he should not get hit
specially by cause the air was so clear / and no cloud was seen / and the
christian men doubted / that their feythe might there by come to confusyon / but
the bishop the heretyke would not bind him thereto / Saint peter had good
feythe and trust in god / and made his prayer openly that he would conueye
over them a cloud / and he made the sign of the cross / and anon the cloud
came and ou^rspred them like a pauyllyon that there were assembled / and abode
as long as the sermon endured / and it scratched no ferther but there / There
was a lame man which had been so lame v year / and might not goo / but was
drawn in a whelebarow and brought to saint peter at melane / and as saint
peter had blessed him with the sign of the cross / and ne he was hoole and
aroos / yet other miracles god showed for him by his life / It happed that the
sone of a gentyl man had such an horrible dys^ase in his throat that he might
nether speak ne draw his breeth / but saint Peter made on him the sign of the
cross and laid his cope on the place where the sore was / and anon he was
all hole / The same gentylman had afterward a grievous maladye / and supposyd
to have deyed / and made to bring to him the said cope which with great
devotion leyed hit on his breast / and anon he cast out a worm with two
heedes which was roughe / and after he was brought in good health / and anon
al hoole / It happed that a young man was dombe and might not speak a word
wherefore he came to saint peter and he put his fyngre in his mowthe / and his
speech ceme to him ageyn / Now it happed that time that an heresye began much
in lombardye / and that there were much people that were fallen in this error
/ and the (...) sent diverse In^uysitours thither of thordre of the friar
prechours / and because that at melane there were many in nombre of great power
and engyne / he sent thither saint peter as a man wise / constaunt and
relygyous which doubted no thing / and by his virtue he repreuyd them / and by
his wit he understood their malice / and when he had enterprised thoffice of
Inquysicyon / then began be as a lion to seche the heretykes over all / and
left them not in pees / but in all places time / and all the manners that he
might he overcame and confounded them / when the heretics saw that they
might not withstonde the holy ghoost that spoke in him / they began to trete
how they might bring him to death / then it happed on a time as he went fro
c^mes to melane for to seek the heretykes / he said openly in a predycacion /
that the money Was delyuerd for to slay him / and wha^ he approached nyghe the
cite / a man of theretykes which was hired thereto ran upon him / and smote
him with his fauchon in the heed and gafe and made to him many cruel wounds /
and he that murmured not ne grutched not suffered pacyently the cruelte of the
tyrauntes / and abandonned or gafe him self over to suffer the marterdom / And
said his credo / and in manustuas / commendyng his spyrite unto the hands of
our lord /

And so the tyrant left him in the place for deed / And thus told the
tyraunte that slew him / And friar Domynyke which was his felawe was sleyne
with him / And after when the tyraunte saw that he remeuyd yet his lyppes /
the cursed and cruel tyraunte came ageyn and smote him with his knyf to the
heart / and anon his spyryte mounted in to heaven Then was hit well known
that he was a very prophet / For the prophecye of his death that he had
pronounced was accomplysshed /

After he had the crown of virgynyte For as his confessors witness that in
all his life he had never done dedely sin / After he had the crown of a
doctor because he had been a god fast ferme prechour and doctor of holy
church / after he had the crown of marterdom / as it apperid when he was
slain / The renome hereof came in to the cite of melan / and the freres the
clergy and the people came with procession with so great company of people
that the prees was so great that they might not enter in to the town / and
therefore they left the body in thabley of Saint symplycien / and there it
abode all that night / and so he said the day tofore to his felawe / the
passion of saint Peter ensyewed much like the passion of our lord in many
manners / For like as our lord suffered for the truth of the feythe that he
preached / So saint peter suffered for the truth of the feyth that he
deffended / / and like as christ suffered of the Jews / So saint peter suffered
of the people of his own contre and of the heretykes / Christ suffered in the
time of ester / so did saint Peter Ihesu christ was sold for xxx pens / and
saint Peter was sold for xl pound / Ihesu christ showed his death to his
dysciples / and saint peter showed it in plain predycacion / Ihesu christ said
at his death lord god in to thy hondes I commend my spyrite / right so saint
Peter did say the same /

There was a nonne of almayne of the abbey of combat which had a grievous gowte
in her knee / which had holden her a year long and more / and there was no
master ne physicyen that might make her hole / She had great devotion to
saint Peter / but she might not goo thither by cause of her obedyence / and by
cause her maladye was so grievous / Then demanded she how many days iourneye
was fro thens to melane / and she found that there were xiiij iourneyes /
Then purposed she to make these iourneyes by her heart and good thoughts /
and she said for every iourneye a hundred pater nosters and alwey as she went
forth by her mind in her iourneyes / she felt her self more eased / and when
she come to the last iourneye in her mind / She fond her self al guarisshed
/ Then she said that day all the sawter / And after returned all the iourneyes
/ like as she had gone by her thoughts in her heart / and after that day she
felt never the gowte / There was a man that had a vylanous malady bynethe in
such wise that he voyded blood vj days contynuelly / he cried to saint peter
deuoutely / and as he had endyd his prayer / he felt him self al hoole / and
after he fyl a sleep / and he saw in his sleep a friar prechour which had a
face great and brown / and him seemed that he had been felawe to saint peter /
And verayly he was of the same form / This friar gave to him a box of
oynemente / and said to him have good hope in saint Peter / which late has
shed his blood for the feyth / for he has helyd the of the blood that ran
fro the And when he awoke he purposed to vysyte the sepulcre of Saint Peter /
There was a countess of the castle cassyn which had special devotion to saint
Peter / and fasted alweye his vygyl / Now it happed that she offered a candell
to thaulter of saint peter / and anon the priest for his couetise quenchyd the
candel / but anon after the candel was lyhht ageyn by him self / and he
quenched it ageyn ones or twyes and all weye as soon as he was gone it lighted
anon ageyn / then he left that and put out another candel which a knight
had offered in thonour of saint peter / which knight fasted also his even /
and the priest assayed ij times if he might put it out / but he might not /
Then said the knight unto the priest / what devil see thou not well the
miracle / that saint Peter will not that they be quenchyd /

Then was the priest abashed and all the clerks that were there with him /
in so much that they fled out of the church / and told the miracle
oueralle / There was a man called roba which had lost his gown / and all the
money that he had / when he came unto his hows / and saw him self in so great
pouerte / he called the deuylles and gave him self to them / then came to him
three deuyls which cast down roba upon the solyer / and after took him by the
neck / and it seemed that they would have estrangled him / in such wise that he
vnothe might speak when they that were in the hows bynethe herd him cry /
they went to him but the deuylles said to them / that they should return / and
they had supposed that roba had said so / and returned / and after anon he
began to cry ageyn / then apperceyued they well / that they Were the deuyls /
and fette the priest which coniured in the name of saint Peter the deuyls that
they should goo their way / Then two of them went away / and the third
abode / and his friends brought him on the morn to the church of the freres /
Then there came afrere named guyllam of versel / and this friar guyllame
demanded What was his name / and the fend answered I am called buthsephast /
then the friar commanded that he should goo out / and anon the fend called
him by his name as he had known him / and said guyllam / guyllam / I shall not
gone out for the / for he is ours / and has given him self to us / then he
coniured him in the name of saint peter the marter / and then anon he went
his way / and the man was all hoole / and took penance for his trespace / and
was after a good man / Saint peter whiles he lived / it happed that he dysputed
with an heretyke / but this heretyke was sharp / aygre / and so full of
words / that saint peter might have of him none audyence / when he saw that /
he departed fro the dysputacion / and went and prayed our lord that he would
give to him place and time to sustain the feythe / and that the other might be
stylle / and speak not / and when he came ageyn he fond this heretic in such
caas that he might not speak / Then the other heretykes fled al confused /
and the good christian men thanked our lord The day that saint peter was marterd
a nonne that was of the cite of florence saw in a vysyon our lady that styed
up in to heaven and with her two persons one on the right side and that other
on the lift in the habyte of freres which weren by her / and when she
demanded who it was / A voys said to her that it was the soul of saint Peter
/ And was founden certeynly that same day he suffered death / and therefore this
Nonne which was grouously seek prayed to saint peter for to recover her health
/ and he gate it for her entyerly / There was a scoler that went fro maloygne
unto monpellyer / and in lepyng he was broken that he might not goo / Then he
remembryd of a woman that was helyd of a cancre by a little of the earth of the
sepulcre of saint peter / and anon he had trust in god and cried to saint
peter in such manner as she had done / and anon he was hoole / In the cite of
compostelle there was a man that had great leggys swollen like a barelle / and
his womb like a woman with child and his face foul and horrible / so that he
seemed a monstre to look on / and it happed that he went with a staff beggyng
his breed / and in a place where he demaundd on a time alms of a good woman
/ she saw him so swollen that she said that it were better for him to have a
pytte to be buried in / than any other thing / For he was no better than deed
/ yet nevertheless said she I counceyl the that thou goo in to the church of
the friar prechours / and pray saint peter that he make the hoole / and have
in him very faith / and I hope he shall make the al hole / This seek man went
on the morn to the church / but he found it shette and closed / Then he
slepte at door / and he saw in his sleep that a man in the habyte of a friar
brought him in to the church / And couerd him with his cope / and when he
awoke he found him self in the church and was perfytely hole / Whereof much
people merueyled by cause they had seen so short time tofore him like as he
should have deyed forthwith / / There be many mo miracles which were over great
a labor to write al / for they would ocupye a great book / then let us
pray to this holy marter saint Peter / that he pray for us /

Thus ends the life of saint Peter the marter
Here follows of saint Phelip thappostle first of thynterpretacyon of his name
PHelyp is as much to say as the mowthe of a lamp / or the mouth of hands
/ or it is said of philos that is as much to say as love / and of ypus that
is to say souerayn / so phelyp is as much to say as love of sou^rayne
things / then is it said mowthe of a lamp for his clear prechyng and mowthe
of the hands for his besy work / and love of things souerayn for his
celestyal love and contemplacion /

Of the life of Saint phylyp
SAint phylip when he had preched in sychye / by the space of xx year / he was
taken of the Paynyms which would constrayne him to make sacrefise to ydolles
which was called mars their god / and anon under thydol issued out a right
great dragon / which forthwith slew the bysshoppes sone that appointed the
fire for to make the sacrefyse / and the ij prouostes also / whose servants
held saint phylip in iron bonds / and the dragon corrupted the people with his
breethe / that they al were seek / and saint philyp said believe ye me / and
break this ydol / and set in his place the cross of Ih^u crist and after
worship ye it / and they that been here deed shall reuyue and all the seek people
shall be made hole / and they that were seek cried to saint philip and said / if
thou may do so much that we may be guarisshed and hole we shall gladly do hit
/ and anon saint philyp commanded the dragon that he should goo in to deserte
without greuyng or doing any harm to any person / and anon he departed with
out apperyng after / and forthwith saint phylip heled al them that were seek /
and raised the three that were deed / and were al baptized / and preched to them
the space of a year the faith of Ihesu crist / and when he had ordained prestes
and dekens after he departed and came in to the cite of Ierapolym in asye /
where he destroyed the heresye of the Iheronyques which said and preched that
Ihesu crist had not taken very flessh humayn / but only the semblau^ce of the
body humayn / In this cite were his ij daughters / by whom our lord had
converted much people to the christian feyth / saint phelip tofore his death made
to come tofore him all the bisshoppes vij days tofore his death / and also all the priests and said to them these vij days has our lord given to me respyte
for to warn you to do well / and he was of the age of lxxxvij year / and after
this the paynyms took and held him / and fastenyd him to the cross / like
unto his master / and so he yielded up his soul and deyed / and his body was
worshypfully buried there / and his ij daughters deyed long after him / and
were also buried that one on the right side and that other on the lift side of
the body of their fader / Ysodore writes in the book of the life and death of
saints and says that philip preched to the frensshmen and to men that were in
derkenes / he enlighted them in the feyth / after be was taken in the cite of
Iherapolym of the paynyms and of them stoned and crucefyed / of whom the
martiloge of holy church speaks not / but of another philip which was one of
the vij dekens / saint Iherom says in the martilogye / that he was buried in
the cite of cezayr where god showed many fair miracles for him / beside whom
iij of his daughters ben buried and the fourth daughter lies at ephesym / The
first phylyppe differenceth fro this philip / For he was apostle / and this was
a dekene / thappostle rests at Iherapolym / and the dekene at Cezaire / he
had two daughters / and this four / Though historia ecclesiastico says that
philippe the appostle had iiij daughters prophetesses / but it is (...) more to
believe saint Iherome / Then let us pray to the holy appostle saint phelyppe
that he pray for us to our lord that we may come to his bliss amen /

Thus ends The life of the blessed appostle saint philip
And here follows of saint James the less
James is as much to say as supplantour or supplantyng a feste or making ready
/ or James is said of Ia and of cobar which is as much to say as the burden
or weight of god / or James may be said of Iaculo a darte and cope smytyng /
which is to say smeten with a darte / or smeten with glayues / he was said a
supplantour of the world / for he despised hit / in supplantyng the feste / for
he supplanted the devil / and he is said making ready / for alweye he made ready
his body to do well / for as gregore of nycene says / we have in us three evil
passions / which comen of evil norisshyng / or of right false conversation /
or of evil custom of the body / or of the vice of ignorance and they ben
cured by good conversation and for to haunte studyes of good exersitacion of
doctrine / So then the blessid James is escryed / for he was alwey ready in
his body to al good / he is said the burden or weyghte of good or godly manners
that he used by exercitacion of virtues / he was smeten with glayues by
marterdom /

Of saint James the less
James the appostle is said the less / how well that he was elder of age than
was Saint James the more / by cause like as is in relygyon / he that entered
first is called ayne / and great / and he that comes after shall be called
less though he be the older / and in this wise was this saint James called the
less / he was called also the brother of our lord / by cause he resembled much
well our lord in body in vysage / and of manner he was called James the Just
for his right great holiness / Far saint Iherome records that he was so holy
that the people s^r^f how they might touch the hemme of his robe or mantel / he
was also called James the sone of alphey / this James was ever holy after that
he issued out of his moders womb / he never drank wine / mede / ne sydre ne
never ete flesh / ne never rasour touched his heed ne he never baygned / he
knelyd so often in prayers / that his knees were as hard as the horn of a
camel / he sange in Iherusalem the first mass that ever was song therein / and
he was first bishop of Iherusalem / Joseph records that he had auowed at the
death of our lord that he would never ete till our lord were risen fro death to life
/ then on ester day our lord apperid to him and said / (...) the table fair
brother and ete / for the sone of the virgyn is risen fro death to life / Then
took he the breed and made the benediction and gave it to him / The seventh
year after the appostles assembled in Jerusalem on ester day / there saint
James demaundyng what god had done by them tofore the people / that they should
tell / and when saint James had preched seven days in the temple with the
other appostles / Cayphas and sum other would have been baptized / And then
entryd in a man suddenly in to the temple and said cryeng / O ye syrres what
will ye do / why suffer ye thus to be dysceyued of these enchauntours / be ye
ware and keep you that they dysceyue you not / he moeuyd so much the people
that they would have stoned the appostles / Then this fellow went up to the
lectron where as saint James preched and threw him down bacwarde / and fro
then forthon ever after he halted And this was done the vij year after the
ascencion of our lord / And he was bishop there by the space of xxx year And
in his xxx year when the Jews saw that they might not slay Saint Poule /
because he had appeled to the Emperor to Rome / and was sent forth to Rome /
they turned al their persecusyon against saint James / and said to him the
people is dysceyued / for they supposed that your Ihesus were messyas / Then
for as much as thou art much byleuyd / we pray the that thou assemble the
people / and that thou stand up on hye / and show to them that it is not he /
For thou art so just that We all shall believe in the / Then saint James
went up on the front of the temple on ester day / and all the people were
assembled bynethe Then said the Jews to him with an hye voys / Right Just
and true man we know well that thou shall not lie Show to us of Ihesus that
was hanged upon the cross that which thou know / for all the world is
dysceyued / Then answered he with an hye voys / wherefore demand ye me of the
sone of the vyrgyn / I say to you that he is now in heaven and sytteth on the
right side of god the fader / and shall come deem the living and the deed /
when the christian men had herd him / they were much glad / But the pharysees
and the masters of the law repented them of this / that they had made him to
say and bear this witness tofore the people / And took counceyll to gydre /
for to cast him down / for to make the people aferde / by cause they should not
believe him / and they cried O the Just man has erryd at this time / and after
they threw him down and the people began to stone him / but he was on his knees
and said / Fair lord god pardone them / for they wot not what they do /
Then escryed one of the sons of the priest named Jacob / Syres leave ye this
just man in pees / but there was a man in that company took a fullers staff
/ and smote him on the heed / that his brain fyl all abroad / And thus by
marterdom he fynysshed his life / and was there buried nygh unto the temple /
And the people would have slain these malefactors / because they had sleyne him
/ but they fled / this was done in the time of nero the year of our lord lvij
/ Josephus says that for thy great sin of the death of saint James / Was
Jerusalem afterward destroyeed / For tofore that the destruction came / god
showed meruayllous signs / For there was a sterre right clear and shynyng /
which had the form of a sword that henge over Jerusalem but this token ne
the tokenes hereafter following / came not only for the death of saint James /
but for the death of our lord Ihesu crist pryncypally / for he said there shall
not in the be left a stone upon a stone / but because our lord would not the
death of synnars / but that he would they should do penance and repent them /
he abode forty year / and called them unto penance by his appostles / and
most by saint James brother of our lord / which contynuelly preached to them /
For in this forty year were many signs and prodyges showed to them as
Josephus reherceth of which the sterre like the sword was one Which was seen
over the cite an hole year during and brennyng with great bryghte flames

The next year after in a feste of Ester there was a clerenesse and light
about the temple in the night that it was like unto clear day /

In that same time there was a cow brought forth to be sacrefyed / which
anon calued or brought forth a lamb against kind / After this a litel time
about going down of the son there was seen in the air carts and waynes and
great company of men of arms that enuyronned the cytee suddenly / In a feste
of whytsontyde which is called penthecoste / the priests went in to the
temple by night / for to do their mysteryes / and they herd a voys saying /
let us goo hens fro this place and iiij year after tofore that the destruction
came / a man whose name was Ihesus the sone of ananye began to cry sodeynlye /
the voys of thorryent / the voys of thoccident / the voys of four wyndes upon
Iherusalem / woo on the husbondes / woo upon the wives / and woo upon all the
people / the said man was taken smeten and beten / tormented / and brought
tofore the Judge / and he never wept ne cried mercy / but he ever perseueryd
and cried howlyng the same words addyng thereto / woo / woo to Iherusalem / al
this says Josephus / and yet for all these tokenes warnynges and prodygis / the
Jews were never aferde Then xl year after the passion of our lord Ihesu
christ came titus and vaspasyanus against Iherusalem and destroyed hit / The
cause and by whom it was destroyed is recorded in an hystorye though hit be
not autentyke / For pylate which doubted the furour and anger of the emperor
Tybere / because he had wrongfully Iuged and condemned Ihesu christ thynnocent
/ sent one of his servants for to excuse him / and the servants name was
albane / In this time vaspasyanus was governor of galace for the emperor / And
the messager of pylate which would have gone to Rome was constrained by a
contrary wind to arryue in galace and was brought to vaspasyan / For the
custom of the contree was that who was taken on the sea / and brought so in
against his will / should be at will of the lord body and goods And when
vaspasyanus saw him he demanded him what he was / and fro whens he came / he
said that he was of Iherusalem / Then said vaspasyan A lord god in that
contre were wont to be good masters and much good surgyens / my friend said
he can thou any thing of surgerye / This said he because he had in his nose
a botche full of worms fro his yongthe / and never might man be founden that
might hele him of it / the messanger of pylate answered and said / that he could
no thing thereof / Vaspasyan said if thou hele me not I shall slay the / The
messanger said he that enlumyned the blind and chaced deuyls out of men / And
raised deed men to life in our contree knows well that I can not hele the /
but he can well hele the if he will / Then demanded vaspasyan what he was / he
said to him that it was Ihesus of nazareth / whom they of Iherusalem had
sleyne wrongfully for envy / and if thou wylt believe in him he shall hele the /
Then said vaspasyanus / I believe well that he that raised deed men may well
hele and make me al hole / and saying these words the waspys fill from his
nose with the botche within which they were / and forthwith he was made
parfytely hole / whereof he had much great joy / And said I am certain that he
that has thus made me hole was the very sone of god / I shall demand license
of the emperor Tybere and I shall goo destroy the cursyd traitors / that have
sleyne this man / And then he let Alban the messager of pylate goo where he
would After this vaspasyan went to Rome and gate license of the emperor for to
destroy this people and the cite of Jerusalem / And assembled his host in the
time of nero the emperor / and came suddenly / The Jews then being the most
part in Iherusalem on ester day and byseged the town / For on that day all the
Jews of the contre were comen to the feast / so that they were suddenly
enclosed / Now was it so that tofore that vaspasyan came / the good men of the
cite were warned by the holy gooste / that they should goo out of the cytee /
And they went to a place called pellam / because that the vengeance should not
fall on them / but on the wicked people of the Jews / There was another cite
of the Iurye named Ionaparam / In which Josephus was duc / which vaspasyan
first assailed / but Josephus with such men as he had resysted them manlye /
but at the last when Josephus saw the destruction of it and might no longer
keep hit / he took with him twelve Jews / and hyd him in a cave or an hows
under therthe / where they were four days without mete and drink in great
anguysshe and affliccion / Then the Jews being there without consent of
Josephus had lever deye / than be subgette or put them self in seruytude to
vaspasyan / And would slay them self / and offer their blood in sacrefyse to god
/ And because Josephus was the most worthy and noble of them / they would slay
him first / by whose blood god might best be plesed or else as it is said in
the cronycle that each of them should slay other / rather than they should come
in to the hands of the romans /

Then Josephus a prudent man / and not wyllyng to deye / constytuted and
ordained him self Judge of the death and sacrefyse / and who that first should be
slain / he ordained that between two and two / should be drawn lotte / and so
the lotte given now one was sleyne now another / till at the last al were deed
saufe Josephus and one other / Then Josephus being a strong man and a light
caughte the sword to him / and axed his fellow whether he had lever live or
deye / and commanded him shortly without delay to tell him / and he sore
dredyng said I forsake not to live if I may by thy grace get and keep my life /
Then Josephus spoke to a servant of vospasyan and did so much that he gate
his life of vaspasian / and then he was brought to vaspasyan / and Vaspasyan
said to him / Thou sholdest have deyed / if thou had not gotten grace by the
prayer and request of this man and Josephus answered if any thing be done amys
/ it may torn to better / And vaspasyan said who that is bounden / what may he
do / Josephus a^swerd somewhat may I do if thou wylt give me audyence /
Vaspasyan said I will well that thou say / and if thou say any good / thou shall
be pesybly herd / And Josephus said the Emperor of rome is deed / and the
senate has made the emperor / and vaspasian answered if thou be a prophet why
have thou not prophesied to the people of this cytee that they shall be taken by
my hand / And Josephus said I have well xl days warned them / and in the mean
while came the messagers fro rome / and affermed that vaspasyen was made
emperor / and ladde him to Rome / All this recounteth Eusebyus in his
cronycle / Josephus said tofore to vaspasyan as well of the death of the emperor
/ as of his eleccion to be emperor And vaspasyan left his sone Tytus at the
syege of Iherusalem /

It is read also in the same hystorye though it be apocrypha that when Tytus
herd that his fader was enhaunced in to the empire / he was so glad and had so
much joy / that all his syne was were shronken / and was so feeble that he
was sore tormented with the palsye / and Josephus heryng thereof dylygently
inquired the cause of the sickness / the time thereof / and the manner / the
cause ne the sekenes were not known / but the time was when he herd of
theleccion of his fader to the empire / Josephus a wise and a prudent man
consyderyd the time of the coming of the sickness / and coniected that it
came of ouermoche joy and haboundyng gladness / and remembryng that
contraryes ben cured by their contraryes / For that which comes of love / is
cured by hate oftymes / And began tenquyre if there were any man that the
prince hated much / And it was that he had a servant whom he held in
prison / and hated him so much that in no wise he might look on him ne here
him named / Then he said tyto if thou desire to be hole / who that ever come
in my felawshyp / must be here sure and saufe / Then Josephus made the dinner
to be ready / and set him self against him and the servant that tytus most
hated satte on his right side / whom as soon as tytus had beholden he began to
chauffe and to be meruaylous angry for anguysshe / Then he which was
Infrigydate and cold for joy / stratched out his synewes and was made al hole
by the brennyng hete of anger and was al hole / All this forsaid of Josephus I
remytte hit to the redars Judgment whether he will believe it or not / but tytus
lay at the syege two year tofore the cite and so long that the famyne
oppressyd so sore / that the faders fro the children / and the children fro the
faders / and husbondes fro the wives / and wives fro the husbondes plucked the
mete out of others mowthes / And young men that had been right strong fyl down
deed in the streets and ways / they that should burye the deed fyl down oftymes
deed upon them that Were deed / and because they were not borne aweye / nor
they might not suffer the stenche of the deed bodies / they ordained that the
comyns of the town should cast them over the walls in to the dyches / by
cause they might not endure the stenche to burye them / And when tytus which
went about the cytee saw the dyches so full of carryens which corrupted all
the contree with the stenche / he held up his houdes to heaven Weeping and said
lord god now see I well / that this is not by me / but by the which herein
take vengeance / For then they of the town within had so great defaulte
that they ete their shoys and lachettis There was a gentyl woman in the town
which had a child to whom she gave sowke / And for hungre that she had she
strangled and slew this child / and roasted that one half / and kept that
other for to ete /

It happed that the governors of the town which went to search / smellyd
the savor of this rooste / and brake up the door / and thretened to slay the
woman if she gave to them not of her mete / Then she showed to them that
other dele of her child that she had kept / and said if he will / I shall
gladly give you part / Then had they so great horror thereof / that they
might not speak / Then said she this was my sone / the sin is mine and
comes on me / ete on hardelye / for I have eten part tofore / for ye loved
him not so well as I did that was his mother / and if pity meue you that ye leave
to ete of him / I that have eten that one half / know ye for certain that I
shall well ete that other half / They then being abhorred of this inhumanyte
went their way / After this then when vaspasyan had been emperor two year
/ Tytus took Iherusalem and destroyed al / and the temple also / And like as
the Jews had boughte our lord for xxx pens / So gave he thyrty Jews for one
penny / And like as Josephus records / He sold so four score and xvij
thousand / And xj hundred thousand were perisshed by famyne and by sword / It
is read that when tytus entered Iherusalem he saw a thycke wall / which he
did do perysshe and break And when an hole was made therein / they saw there a
fair old man / hoar and venerable of chere / whom they demanded long what
he was / At the last he answered and said he was Joseph of abyramathya a cytre
of Iudee and that the Jews had mured him therein / by cause he had buried
christ / and saying more that fro that time until this now / I have been fed
with heavenly breed and drink / and comforted with deuyne light / Nevertheless
in the gospel of nychodemus it is said / that when the Jews had shette him up
/ Christ in his resurrexyon took him thens and led him in to arymathye / It
may well be after / when he cessyd not to preche of Christ that the Jews so
mured him up / After this when vaspasyanus was deed / Titus his sone was made
emperor after him / and was so debonayr so lyberalle / and of so great
bountee / that there had none be like him / For as Jerome says / that day that
he had not given a yefte / ne had done no good at even he said to his friends /
O my friends this day have I lost / After this / long time it happed that
sum Jews would reedefye Iherusalem / and on the first morning that they
went to work / they found crosses on the dew / and then they fled / And
after they came ageyn and began to reedefye ageyn / And then they found
blody crosses / And then they fled aweye ageyn / And the third time they
came ageyn and out of the earth issued a fire and burnt and wasted them all /

Thus ends the life of Saint James the less with the storye of Josephus and
the destruction of Iherusalem /
Of thynuencion of tholy cross / and first of this word Inuencion
THe Inuencion of the holy cross is said because that this day the holy cross
was founden / for tofore it was founden of seth in paradyse terrestre / like as
hit shall be said here after / and also it was founden of salamon in the moute
of lybane and of the queen of saba / in the temple of salamon / And of the
Jews in the water of pyscyne / And on this day it Was founden of Helayne in
the mount of caluarye /

Of the holy cross
THe holy cross was fou^den two hundred year after the resurrexyon of our lord
/ It is read in the gospel of nychodemus / that wh^ adam Wexyd seek / Seth his
sone Went to the yate of paradise terrestre for to get the oil of mercy for
to enoynte with al his faders body / Then apperid to him saint mychel
thaungel and said to him / traueyle not the in vain / for this oil / for thou
may not have it till five thousand and five hundred year been passed / how be
it that fro Adam unto the passion of our lord were but five MC and xxxiij year
/ In another place it is read that the aungel brought him a branch / and
commanded him to plant it in the mount of lybanye / Yet find we in another
place / that he gafe to him of the tree that Adam etc of / And said to him that
when that bare fruit he should be guarysshed and all hoole / When seth came
ageyn he found his fader deed / and planted this tree upon his grave / And it
endured there unto the time of Salamon / and by cause he saw that it was fair
he did do hew it down / and set it in his hows named saltus / and when the
queen of saba came to vysyte Salamon / She worshypped this tree by cause she
said the savior of all the world should be hanged thereon / by whom the royame
of the Jews shall be defaced and seace Salamon for this cause made hit to be
taken up / and doluen deep in the ground Now it happed after that they of
Jerusalem / did do make a great pytte for a pyscyne / where as the mynystters
of the temple should Wesshe their bestys / that they should sacrefyse / and there
found this tree / and this pyscyne had such virtue / that the angels
descended and meuyd the water / and the first seek man that descendyd in to the
water after the meuyng / was made hole of what someuer sickness he was seek of
And when the time approached of the passion of our lord / this tree aroos out of
the water and floted above the water / And of this pyece of tymbre made the
Jews the cross of our lord / Then after this hystorye / the cross by
which we been saved / came of the tree by which we were dampened / And the
water of that pyscyne had not his virtue only of the aungel / but of the tree /
With this tree whereof the cross was maad / there was a tree that went
ouerthwarte / on which the arms of our lord were nailed / And another pyece
above which was the table / wherein the title was written / and another pyece
wherein the sokette or morteys was maad that the body of the cross stood in /
so that there were four manner of trees / That is of palm of cypres / of
cedre and of olyue / So each of these four pyeces was of one of these trees /
This blessed cross was put in the earth and hyd by the space of an hundred
year and more / But the mother of the emperor which was named helayne fond it
in this manner / For Constantyn came with a great multitude of barbaryns nyghe
unto the river of the dunoe / which would have goon over for to have destroyed
all the contre / And when constantyn had assembled his host / He went and
set them against that other party / but as soon as he began to pass the
river / he was much aferde / by cause he should on the morn have battle / and
in the night as he slepte in his bed / an aungel awoke him / and showed to
him the sign of the cross in heaven and said to him / Behold on hye on heaven
/ Then saw he the cross made of right clear light / and was written there
upon with lettres of gold / In this sign thou shalt overcome the bataylle /
Then was he all comforted of this vysyon / And on the morn / he put in his
banere the cross / and made it to be borne tofore him and his host / and
after smote in the host of his enemies / and slew and chaced great plente /
After this he did do call the bysshoppes of the ydolles / and demanded them
to what god the sign of the cross apperteyned And when they could not answer
/ some christian men that were there told to him the mysterye of the cross / and
informed him in the faith of the trynyte / Then anon he byleued parfytely
in god / and did do baptyse him and after it happed that constantyn his sone
remembered the vyctorye of his fader / Sent to helayn his mother for to find
the holy cross / Then helayne went in to Iherusalem / and did do assemble
all the wise men of the contre / and when they were assembled / they would fayn
know wherefore they were called / Then one Judas said to them / I wot well
that she will know of us where the cross of Ihesu christ was leyed / but
beware you al / that none of you tell her / For I wot well then shall our
law be destroyed / For zacheus mine old fader said to simon my fader / And my
fader said to me at his death / ^e well ware / that for no tormente that ye may
suffer / tell not where the cross of Ihesu criste was leyde / For after that
hit shall be founden / the Jews shall reygne no more / but the christian men that
worshypped the cross shall then reygne / And verayly this Ihesus was the
sone of god /

Then demanded I my fader / wherefore had they hanged him on the cross sithe
it was known that he was the sone of god / then he said to me fair sone I
never accorded thereto / But gayn said it al were / but the pharisees did it
because he repreuyd their vices / but he aroos on the third day / and his
dysciples seeing he ascended in to heaven / Then by cause that stephen thy
brother byleued in him / the Jews stoned him to death /

Then when Judas had said these words to his felawes / they answered we never
herd of such things / nevertheless keep the well if the auene demand the
thereof / that thou say nothing to her / when the auene had called them / and
demanded them the place where our lord Ihesu christ had be crucefyed / they
would never tell ne ensygne her / Then commanded she to brenne them all /
but then they doubted and were aferde / and delyuerd Judas to her and said /
lady this man is the sone of a prophet and of a Just man / and knows right
well the law / and can tell to you al thing that ye shall demand him /
Then the queen let all the other goo and retained Judas without moo / Then
she showed to him his life and death and bad him chese which he would Show to
me said she the place named golgata where our lord was crucefyed by cause / and
to the end that we may find the cross / Then said Judas it is two hundred
year passed and more / and I was not then yet borne Then said to him the
lady / by him that was crucyfyed / I shall make the perisshe for hungre / if
thou tell not to me the truth /

Then made she him to be cast in to a dry pytte / and there tormented him
by hungre / and evil rest / when he had been seven days in that pytte /
then said he if I might be drawn out / he should say the truth / Then he
was drawn out / and when he came to the place / anon the earth moeuyd and a
fume of great swettenesse was felt in such wise that Judas smote his hondes
to gyder for joy / and said / in truth Ihesu christ thou art the savior of
the world /

It was so that adryan the Emperor had do make in the same place where the
cross lay a temple of a goddess by cause that all they that came in that
place should adoure that goddess / But the queen did do destroy the temple /
Then Judas made him ready and began to dygge / and when he came to xx paas
deep / he fond three crosses and brought them to the queen / And by cause he
knew not which was the cross of our lord / he leyed them in the myddel of
the cite / and abode the demonstraunce of god / and about the hour of none /
there was the corpse of a young man brouhgte to be buried / Judas retained the
byere / and laid upon hit one of the crosses / and after the second / and when
he leyed on hit the third / anon the body that was deed came ageyn to life /

Then cried the devil in the air / Judas what have thou done / thou have
done the contrary that the other Judas did / For by him I have won many sowles
/ and by the I shall lose many / by him I reigned on the people / And by the I
have lost my royame / nevertheless I shall yield to the this bountee For I
shall send one that shall punysshe the / and that was accomplysshed by Iulyan
the appostata / which tormented him afterward when he was bishop of Iherusalem
/ and when Judas herd him he cursed the devil and said to him / Ihesu christ
dampne the in fire pardurable / After this Judas was baptized and was named
quyryache / And after was made bishop of Iherusalem / When helayn had the
cross of Ihesu christ / and saw she had not the nails / thrune she sent to
the bishop quyriache that he should goo to the place and seek the nails /
Then he did dygge in therthe so long / that he found them shynyng as gold
/ then bare he them to the queen / and anon as she saw them she worshypped
them with great reuererence /

Then gafe saint helayn a part of the cross to her sone / And that other
part she left in Iherusalem closyd in gold / silver and precious stones /
And her sone bare the nails to the emperor / And the emperor did do set them
in his brydel and in his helm When he went to battle / This reherceth Eusebe
Which was bishop of Cezayr / how be it that other say other wise / Now it
happed that Iulyan the appostata did do slay quyriache that was bishop of
Iherusalem / by cause he had found the cross / for he hated hit so much /
that where someuer he found the cross / he did hit to be destroyed / For when
he went in battle against them of perse / he sent and commanded quyriache
to make sacrefyse to thydolles / and When he would not do hit / he did do smite
of his right hand / and said with this hand have thou written many letters /
by which thou repellyd much folk fro doing sacrefyse to our gods /

Quyriache said thou wood hounde thou have done to me great prouffyte / For
thou have cut of the hand / with which I have many times wreton to the
synagoges that they should not believe in Ihesu christ / and now sithe I am
christian / thou have taken fro me that which noyed me / then did Iulyan do
melte leed and cast it in his mowthe and after did do bring a bed of iron /
and made quyriache to be laid and stratched thereon / and after leyed under
brennyng cooles / and threw therein greece and salt / for to tormente him the
more / and when quyryache moeuyd not / Iulyan the emperor said to him / outher
thou shall sacrefye our gods / or thou shall say at the least thou art not
christian / And when he saw he would do never neither / he did do make a deep
pytte full of serpents and venomous bestys / and cast him therein / and when he
entered / anon the serpents were al deed / Then Iulyan put him in a cawdron
full of boylyng oil / and when he should enter in to hit / he blessed it and
said / Fair lord torn this bayne to baytym of marterdom / Then was Iulyan
much angry / and commanded that he should be ryuen thorugh his heart with a
sword / and in this manner he fynysshed his life /

The virtue of the cross is declared to us by many miracles / For it happed on
a time that one enchauntour had dysceyued a notarye / and brought him in to a
place / where he had assembled a great company of deuylles / and promised to
him that he would make him to have much richesse / and when he came there / he
saw one person black syttyng on a great chayer / And all about him al full
of horrible people and black Which had speres and swerdes / Then demanded
this great devil of the enchauntour / who was that clerk / thenchauntour said
to him / Sir he is owres / then said the devil to him if thou will worship
me and be my servant / and ^enye Ihesu christ / thou shall sytte on my right
side / The clerk anon ble^syd him with the sign of the cross / and said
that he was the servant of Ihesu christ his savior / And anon as he had
made the cross / that great multitude of deuylles vanysshed aweye It happed
that this notarye after this on a time entryd with his lord in to the church
of saint sophye / and knelyd down on his knees tofore the image of the
crucyfyxe / the which crucifyxe as it seemed looked much openly and sharpelye
on him / Then his lord made him to goo a part on another side / and all
weye the crucifyxe turned his tyen toward him / Then he made ha^m goo on the
lift side / and yet the crucifixe looked on him / Then was the lord much
admerueyled / and charged him and commanded him that he should tell him whereof
he had so deserved that the crucifyxe so beheld and looked on him / Then
said the notarye that he could not remember him of no good thing that he had
done / saufe that one time he would not renye ne forsake the crucifyxe tofore
the devil / Then late us so bless us with the sign of the blessed cross
that we may thereby be kept fro the power of our ghoostly and dedely enemy the
devil / and by the merytes of the glorious passion that our saueour Ihesu christ
suffered on the cross after this life we may come to his everlasting bliss amen
/

Thus ends thynuencion of the holy cross
Here follows thystory of saint Johan portlatyne
When saint Johan the appostle and euangelyste preached in a cite of greece named
ephesym / he was taken of the Judge / which commanded him that he should make
sacrefyse to the false ydolles / and when he would not do hit / he put him in
prison / And after he sent a lettre to domycyen the emperor which said that
he held an enchau^tour in prison which had despised their gods / and
worshypped him that was crucefyed / Then commanded domycyen that he should be
brought to Rome / and when he was there / they did do shave of all the heerys
of his heed in derysion and after they brought him tofore the yate called
port latin / and put him in a tonne full of brennyng oil / But he never felt
harm ne pain / And without suffryng any harm he issued out / In that place
christian men did do make a fair church / and this day made a solemn feste /
as it were the day of his marterdom / And when the Emperor saw that he cessyd
not of prechyng for the commandment that he had made / he sent him in exyle
in to an isle named pathmos / It ought not to be believed the the emperor did
these persecusyons unto christian people because they believed in god / for they
refused none / But it was a dysplesure to them / that they worshypped god
without auctoryte of the senators / Another reason there was / and that was
that the service of their other gods was lassed and mynysshed thereby / The
third reason was that he preched to despise the worship / the honor / and the
hauoir of the world / and that was the thing pryncypal that the Romans loved
/ But Ihesu christ would no thing / by cause they held that it was done by
puyssaunce humayn / Another cause there was as master Johan beleth says why
that the emperor and the senate pursewed crist and his appostles And that was
that them seemed that god was over proud and enuyous / by cause he d^gyned not
to have a fellow / Another cause aledgeth crosyus and says / that the senate
had despyte of this that pylate had written the miracles of Ihesu criste to the
Emperor only and not to the senators / Wherefore they would not accord that
he should be amytted to be worshypped emonge the gods / Wherefore Tybere the
emperor did do slay so^me of the senators / and sum he sent in exyle / The
mother of saint Johan heryng that her sone was prysonner meuyd with moderly
compassyon came to Rome / and when she came she found that he was sent in
exyle / she went then in to the champeyn to a cite named vo^ilana / and
there deyed / and yielded her soul to christ / whose body was buried in a cave
where it long rested / but after by saint James her other sone hit was showed
/ which then was taken up and found sweet smellyng / and many miracles
showed in her translacion in the said cite / Then let us pray to saint
Johan that he pray for us /

Thus ends the felt of saint Johan Portlatyne
Here begins the life of Saint Gordyan
GOrdyan that was vicayr unto Iulyan the emperor constrained a christian man named
January for to do sacrefyse / But by the grace of god he was converted by the
prechyng of the same Ianuarye unto the christian feythe with his wife and liij men
/ and when this came to the knowleche of the Emperor / he commanded that
Ianuarye should be put and sent in exyle / and if so were that gordyan would not
do sacrefyse to the gods he should be byheded / and so his heed was smyten of
/ and the body cast unto the howndes / which lay so by the space of seven
days untouched / And at last his servants took and stale it aweye / and
with the body of the blessed epymache / whom the said Iulyan had sleyne a little
tofore / they beryed it / not far fro the cite of rome about a mile / And
this was done about the year of our lord three hundred and lx /

Thus ends the life of Saint Gordyane
Here follows the lives of Nereus and Achylleus and first thynterpretacion of
their names
NEreus is as much to say as counceyl of light / Or nereus is said of nereth
that is a lantern / and us that is hastyng / Or nereus is said of ne and reus
/ which is to say no thing gylty / he was then counceyl of light in
prechyng of vyrgynyte / a lantern in honest conversation / hasty in feruor of
love to get heaven / and never gylty in his conscience / Achylleus is said of
achi / that is to say my brother and lesa that is health / as who says / the
health of brethern / The passion of these tweyne written entyches victoryn and
Mar^ servants of christ dylygently /

Of the saints nereus and Achylleus
NEreus and Achylleus were ghelded and chaumberlayns of one domycel nece of
domycian the emperor / whom saint Peter thappostle baptized / and this
damoysel had to husbond a man that was called aurelyan / and was sone of one of
the counceyllours of the emperor / And When she was curyously clad and arrayed
in roobes / of pourpre and precious stones / these two glorious saints preached
to her the feythe of christ / and the virtue of vyrgynyte / they preysed it
much in showing that it was nyghe unto god and neighbor / suster unto
aungellis cosyn unto saints and of nature borne with creature humayn / And the
woman that is married is subgette to man and is bet^n with staves and fystes /
in such wise that they be delyuerd of their children or their time / disformed
/ and lame / and where in her yongthe she might uneath suffer techynges and
admonestments of her mother which were but soft and amyable / she should now by
the contrary suffer of her husbond great shames / repreues and vylanyes / and
she emonge all other things answered I know Well that my fader was Ialous over
my mother / and much sorrow suffered my mother / and my husbond / shall he be
such one herafter / thereto they answered / when they ben new weddyd they seem
much debonayr / But after when they feel them self married / they reygne much
cruelly / And sometime they maken their maidens maystresses gretter then their
wives / and thus all holiness may be lost / but by penance may hit be
recouerd / and vyrgynyte may not come ageyn to his perfeccio^ / how well that
the culpe of sin may well be deffaced / but the virgynyte may not be had ageyn
/

Then this damoysell which was named flauye byleued in god and auowed to him
her vyrgynyte / and received the veylle of the hand of saint clemente / and
when her husbond herd this / he gate license of the Emperor that he might do
what he would with his wife / and also of them that had converted her / And he
sent them all three in to an isle called prouynciana / and by this he supposed
to do that the foresaid saints that is to say Saint Neryn / and saint achylle
should torn the purpoos of his wife touching the auowe of the vyrgynte that she
had made / And after that a little time he went to the vyrgyn and also to the
saints to the end that they should change their purpoos / and they in no wise
would not / but yet more strongely than tofore were they confermed and comforted
/ and said plainly they would in no wise do ne make sacrefyse to the ydolles /
For they had be baptized of saint Peter thappostle which so had confermed
them in the law and feythe that they might make no sacrefyse but only to god
/ And therefore their heedes were smyten of and so suffered mrarterdom / about
the year of our lord four score / Of whom the bodies were buried by the
sepulcre of Saint Pernelle / And the other saints that is to say Saint
Vyctoryn Entyche and maron which were about them servants were put to
labor all day in the gardyns / And at even was given to them brown bread /
black and roughe which was made of great mele and brenne / Fynably he maad
Entyche to deye by force of famyne and to give up his spyryte /

He did do cast saint vyctoryn in to foul and stynkyng water / and there was
drowned / and he made saint marron to be laid under a stone the which lxx of
his servants might uneath moeue / and the glorious saint cast the stone upon
his sholdres as lightly as it had been a little straw / and bare it two mile
far fro thens / For which cause many were converted and byleuyd in god / For
which cause the masters counceyllours did him to be slain / and after this
aurelyan did do bring the damoysel fro the place of exyle / And sent to her
two vyrgyns named eufrosyne / and theodore / which had be nourysshed with her
/ to the end that they should torn and change her vow / But she converted
these two vyrgyns to the feythe by her exortacion / Then Aurelyan took the
husbondes of the two maidens and three enchauntours with him / and came to
domycelle for to wedde and accomplissh the marriage by force against her will
But domycylle as god would converted the young men to the feyth of Ihesu christ
/ But when aurelyan saw that she had converted the two young men and the two
vyrgyns before said he led her in to his chamber / and maad the enchauntours
to sing / and commanded the other to dance with him as he that would defoule
Domycelle / but the iogelers left syngyng / and the other daunsyng / And he
him self seced not do dance two days contynuelly / unto the time that he
exspyred and deyed tofore them all / Then Luxuryus which was his brother
gate leave to slay all them that byleuyd in Ihesu christ /

And he did so much that in the place where they dwelled he did do set a
fire / And they being in their prayers / rendryd their sowles unto god whose
bodies Saint Cezayre upon the morn fyndyng no thing hurt / buried / (...)
Then let us pray to them that we may come to everlasting bliss in heaven
amen /

Here follows of Saint Pancrace and first the interpretacion of his name
PAncrace is said of Pan that is as much to say as al / and gratus and cicius
/ which is as much to say as curtoys in his young age / Or otherwise as it is
said in the book called glosayr /

Pancrace is said rapynge / or Pancrace is subget to betynges and tormentys /
Pancrace is also said of diverse colors / and so it appyeryd by him He used
rapyne / in rauysshyng by his exortacyon the pray of caytyues mysbyleuyng in
bryngyng them to the feythe / He was also subgette to betynges and tormentys
in suffrynge them / also in diverse colors and full of all virtues /

Of Saint Pancrace
PAncrace was of right noble lignage / and was borne of the contree of frige /
when his fader and mother were deed / he was put to be governed in the hand of
denis his uncle / which was brother of his fader and they both came to rome
where they had of their patrymonye great rentys / In their street the pope
cornelyus held him pryuely / of which pope / pancrace and denis had received
the christian feythe / Fynably denis deyed in the country / and Pancrace was
taken and presented to Caesar / and then was Pancrace about fonrtene year of
age To whom the Emperor Dyoclesyan said / My little child I warn and
counceyl the that thou advise the well to the end that thou deye not an evil
death / For as a child thou art lightly deceived / and by cause thou art
noble of blood aid of lignage / and sone of one my right dear friend / I pray
the that thou leave this madness that thou have emprysed / And that I may have
the with me as my sone / To whom Pancrace answered if I be a child of body yet
mine heart is old / and by the virtue of my lord Ihesu christ your thretenyng
and menaces make me no more to moeue / than does the payntyng that I see upon
the wall / And these gods that thou would that I should worship ben but
deceyuers of creatures / and have been as germayns in fornycacions maad ageyn
god their creator / and have not spared kynne ne other / And if thou had
knowleche that thy servants were such / thou sholdest commau^de that they
should be sleyne /

And I much marvel that ye adoure such gods / When the emperor herd this
child thus speak / he doubted to be ouercomen of him / and commanded that his
heed should be smyten of and so he was marterd about the year of our lord two
hundred four score and five / whose body a worshypfull lady named Octouylla
which was of the senate with great dylygence buried honorably / And of him
said Gregory of turone doctor / that if there be a man that will make a false
oath in the place of his sepulcre tofore or he come to the chauncel of the
quyre / he shall be trauaylled with an evil spyryte and out of his mind / or he
shall fall on the pament all deed / It happed on a time that there was a
great altercacyon between two men And the Judge wyste not who had wrong / for
the ialousye of Iustyse that he had / and he brought them both unto the altar
of saint Peter for to swear / prayeng the appostle that he would declare who had
right / And when he that had wrong had sworen and had none harm / the Judge
that knew the malice of him said al on high / This old peter here is either
over mercyful / or he is pro^yce to this young man / but let us goo to
Pancrace / and demand we of ^ym the truth / and when they came to the
sepulcre / he that was culpable swear and stratched forth his hand but he
might not wythdrawe his hand ageyn to him / and anon after he deyed there /
And therefore unto this day of much people it is used that for great and notable
causes men make their oaths upon the relyques of saint Pancrace /

Here follows of saint urban and first thynterpretacion of his name
VRbanus is said of vrbanyte / that is curtosye / or it is said of vr / that is
to say fire or light / and bana / that is to say responce or answer / he was
light by honest conversation / fire by charity / and answer by doctrine / Or
he was light for the light is good to behold / and it is Inmateryal in essence
/ in setting celestyal and proffytable in werkyng And thus this saint was
amyable in conversation / Inmateryal in despysyng the world / celestyal in love
of god / and prouffytable in predycacion /

Of Saint Urban
Saint urban was pope after saint calixte / and the christian people were in his
time in over great persecusyon / but the mother of the emperor whom orygene
had converted prayed so much her sone that he left the christian people in pees
/ Nevertheless there was one almachyus prouoste of Rome and was there
pryncypal governor of the cite / And had cruelly smyton of the heed of saint
cecyle / This man was meruaylously cruel against christian men / And did
dylygently inquire where Saint Urban was / And by one of his servants na^ed
carpase he was founden in a derke place and a secret with three priests and
three dekenes / He commanded to put him in prison / and / after he did him to
be brought tofore him and accused him that he had deceived five thousand people
with saint cecyle and the noble men tyburse and valeryan and made al them do
sacrylege / And above this he demanded him the tresone of saint cecyle and of
the church To whom urban said I see now that couetyse moeueth the more to
persecute the christian men / than does the sacrefise of thy gods / The
tresour of saint cecyle is ascendyd in to heaven by the hands of pour people /

Then did he do beat saint vrbane with plommettys / and also his fellows
with him / and he praised the name of god Elyon / And the tyrant smylyng said
/ this old fellow would be reputed wise / For he speaks and says words that
he understands not / and when he saw that he might not overcome him / he
commanded him and sent him to prison ageyn / where as saint urban converted
three captayns of the town with the kepar of the prison which was named anolyn
/ And baptized them / when the tyraunte herd that anolyn was bycomen christian /
he did do bring him tofore him / and by cause he would do no sacrefyse to his
gods / he did do smite of his heed / and when saint urban and his fellows
were brought tofore thydollys / to the end that they should sacrefyse and sense
tofore the gods / Saint urban began to make his oryson to god / and anon
thidolle fyl down and slew xxij preestys of the law that held fire for to
make sacrefyse / Then were they beten cruelly / and after brought for to make
sacrefyse / and then they spytte in thydolle / and after maad the sign of
the cross in their forhedes / and kyssed each other / and received capytal
sentence / that is to say they were beheded and so suffered death under
alisaunder the emperor / which began to regne the year of our lord two
hundred and twenty / And anon after carpasyus was taken of the fend in
blasphemyng his gods / and in magnefyeng the christian men ageynste his will /
he was strangled of the fend / which thing his wife seeing called marmenye
with her daughter lucye / and all her howsholde received baptesme of Saint
Fortune priest / And after that the bodies of the saints were right honorably
buried /

name
PEtronylla is said of Petens / that is demau^dyng and of thronus / that is a
trone or a sete / as who says she was demaundyng the trone or sete of vyrgynes
/

Of saint Pernelle
Saint Pernelle whose life saint marcelle writes / was daughter of Saint peter
the appostle / which was right fair and bewteous / and by the will of her
fader she was vexyd with the fevers and axes / It happed on a time that the
dysciples dyned with saint peter / and one tytus said to him / peter how is it
that all seek people ben helyd of the and thou suffrest Pernelle thy daughter
lie seek / To whom saint Peter said / for it is expedyent to her for to be

answered if thou desyrest me to have unto thy wife / command thou certain
vyrgyns to come to me for to accompanye me unto thyn hows And whiles he was

and prayers / and received the holy body of our lord and reclyned in to her
bed / and after the third day she deyed and passyd out of this world rendryng

Here follows the life of saint dunston
Saint duston was borne in England / and our lord showed miracles for him or he
was borne / It was so that on a candelmas day as all the people were in the
church with tapres in their hondes / Suddenly all the lyghtes in the church
were quenchyd at ones / Sauf only the tapre which Saint Dunstons mother bare /
for that brennyd stylle fair / whereof all the people merueyled gretely / how
be it her tapre was out / but by the power of our Lord it lighted ageyn by hit
self / And brennyd full bright / so that all the other came and lighted their
tapres at the tapre of Say^^ Dunstons mother / wherefor all the ^^ople gave
lawde and thankynges unto our lord god for this great miracle / And then
there was an holy man that said that the child that she the^^e bare should give
light to al england / by his holy living /

This holy child dunston was borne in the year of our lord ix hundred and xxv
/ that time regnyng in this land king Athelston /

And saint dunstons fader hight herston / and his mother hight quyndrede and
they set their sone dunston to scole in the abbay of glastynburye / Where as
after he was abbot for his holy living / and within short time after he went
to his uncle ethelwold that then was bishop of caunterburye / to whom he
was welcome / and was glad of his conversation of holy living / and then he
brought him to king athelston the which maad full much of him also for his good
living and then he was made abbot of glastenburye by consent of the king and
his brother edmond / and in that place ruled full well and religyously the monks
his brethern and drew them to holy living by good ensaumple gyuyng / Saint
d^^ston and saint ethelwold were both made preestys in one day / and he was
holy in contemplacion / and when so was that saint dunston was weary of prayer /
then used he to work in goldsmythes work with his own hondes / for to
eschew ydlenes / and he gave alwey alms to pour people for the love of god
/ and on a time as he sat at his work / his heart was on Ihesu christ / his
mowthe ocupyed with holy prayers / and his hondes besy on his work / but the
devil which ever had great envy at him / came to him in an even tide in the
liknes of a woman / as he was besy to make a chalys And with smylyng said that
she had great things to tell him / and then he bad her say what she would /
and then she began to tell him many nyce trysyllys / and no manner virtue
therein / and then he supposed that she was a wicked spyryte / and anon
caught her by the nose wit^ a pair of tongues of iron brennyng (...) / and
then the devil began to rore and cry / and fast drew aweye but saint
dunston held fast / till it was far within the night / and then let her
goo / and the fend departid with an horrible noise and cry / and said that all the people myt here / alas what shame has this carle done to me / how may I
best quyte him ageyn / but never after the devil had never lust to tempte him
in that craft / and in short time after deyed king ethelston / and edmond his
brother reigned king after him / to whom saint dunston was chyef of counceyl /
for he gave to him right good counceyl to his lives end and then deyed
edmund the king And after him reigned his sone edwyn and sone after saint
dunston and he fill at stryf for his synful living / For saint dunston rebuked
the king sharply therefore / but there was none amendeme^t / but alwey werse
and werse wherefore saint dunston was right sorry and did all that pain he
might to bring the king to amendment / but it would not be / but the king
within a while after exyled saint dunston out of this land / and then he
sailed over the sea / and came to the abbey of saint amand in france / and
there he dwelled long time in full holy life till king edwyn was deed / and after
him reigned edgar king a full holy man / and then he herd of the holiness of
saint dunston / and sent for him to be of his counceyl / and received him with
great reverence / and maad him ageyn abbot of glastynburye / and sone after the
bishop of wor^^^re deyed And then saint dunst^^ was made bishop there by
the w^lle of king edgar / and within a (...) while after the sea of london
(...) as void to which king edgar p^^moted saint dunston also / and so he
(...) both bisshopriches in his hand that is to wit both the bisshoprich^
of worcestre and the bysshopryche of ^^^don / and after this deyed the
arch^^ysshop of caunterburye / and then ^^ng edgar made saint dunston
archeb^sshop of caunterburye / which he guyd^^ well and holyly to the pleasure of
god so that in that time of king edgar / and dunston archebysshop / was io^e
and myrthe thou ^ the royame of e^glond / and every man preysed gre^^ly saint
dunston for his hol^ life / good rule and guydyng / and in dy^^rs places where
as he vysyted and (...) curates that were not good ne propyce for ye well of
the sowles that they had ^^re of / h^ would dyscharge them and put them out of
their benefices and set in such as would entende and were ^^od men as ye shall
find more plainly matere in the life of saint Oswo^ And on a time as he satte
ot a princes table / he lokyd up and saw his fader and mother above in heaven /
And then he thanked our lord god of his great mercy and goodness that hit
plesyd him to show him that sight / and another time as he lay in his bed /
he saw the bryghtnes of heaven / and herd angels syngyng kyryeleyson / after
the note of kyrye rex splendens / which was to him a full great comfort And
another time he was in his medytacyons he had hangyng on the wall in his
chamber an harp / on which otherwhyle he would harp anthemes of our lady and
of other saints and holy ympnes / and it was so that the harp sowned full me
bodyously without touching of any hand that he could see / this antheme was
Gaudent in celis anime sanctoru^ / wherein this holy saint dunston had great
joy / he had a special grace of our lord that such heavenly joys and things
were showed to him in this wretchyd world for his great comfort and after this
he became all seek and fe^le / and upon holy thorsday he sent for all his
brethern and asked of them foryeuenesse / and also forgave them all trespaces
and assoyled them of al their sins / and the third day after he passed out of

and when the (...) herd of his great holiness / he sent for him to come to

no bishop in england should uysyte ne have to do there ne the king to let
them of their free el^^cion / but chese their abbot emonge the covent them self
/ and when he had gotten all this of the pope he was full glad and ioyeful /
and lyuyd there full holyly long time / And on a day as he said mass in the
church of saint Johan latrans / and when mass was done / there was no man
that would take his chesyble fro him at the end of the mass / and then he
saw the son beme shine thorugh the glass wyndowe / and henge his chesyb^

and they lived to gyder full holyly long time / and each was full glad and

Of Saint austyn that brout crystendom in to england
Saint austyn was an holy monk / and sent in to england to preche the faith
of our lord Ihesu christ / by saint gregory thenn^ king pope of rome / the
which had a great zele and love unto england as is reberced all alonge in his
legende h^w that he saw children of england in the marlet of rome for to be
sold which we (...) fair of vysage / for which cause he demanded license
and opteyned to goo in to England for to convert the people thereof to christian
feythe /

And he being on the weye the pope deyed / and he was chosen pope / and was
countremaunded and came ageyn to rome And after when he was sacred in to the
papacye / he remembryd the royame of england / and sent saint Austyn as heed
and chyef / and other holy monks and priests with him to the nombre of xl
persons unto the royame of england / and as they came toward england they came
in the prouynce of Andegauence / purposyng to have restyd all night at a place
called pounte Say a mile fro the cite and river of ligerym but the wymmen
scorned and were so noyous to them that they droof them out of the town / and
they came unto a fair broad elm / and purposyd to have restyd there that
night / but one of the wymmen which was more cruel than the other purposed to
drive them thens / and came so nyghe them that they might not rest there that
night / And then Saint Austyn took his staff for to remeue fro that place /
and suddenly his staff sprange out of his hand with a great vyolence the
space of three furlonges thens and there styked fast in the earth / and when
saint austyn came to his staff and pulled hit out of the earth / in contynente
by the might of our lord sourded and sprange there a fair well or fontayn of
clear water / which refresshyd him well and al his felawshyp / and about that
well they restyd all that night / and they that dwelled there by / saw all
that night over that place a great light coming fro heaven which couerd all that
place where these holy men lay / And on the morn saint austyn wrote in
therthe with his staff beside the well these words following / here had
austyn the servant of the servants of god hospytalite / whom saint gregory
the pope has sent to convert england / On the morn when the holy men / the
dwellers of the coostes thereby / which saw the light in the nyt tofore / came
thither and fond there a fair well / of the which they merueyled gretely /
And when they saw the scripture wreton in the earth / then they were gretely
abashed by cause of their unkindness / and repented them full sore of that
they had mocked them the day before / and after they edefyed there a fair
church in the same place / in the worship of saint austyn / the which the
bishop of andegaueuse hallowed And to the halowyng thereof came so great
multitude of people that they trad the corn in the feldes down al plain like
unto a flore clean swepte / For there was no sparyng of hit /

Not wythstondyng at the time of repyng that ground so trodden bare more corn
and better then any other feeldes beside not trodden did / And the high
altar of that church stands over the place where saint austyn wrote with
his staff by the well / and yet unto this day may no woman come in to that
church / but there was a noble woman that said that she was not gylty in
offendyng saint Austyn / and took a tapre in her hand and went for to offer
hit in the said church / but the sentence of almighty god may not be revoked /
for as soon as she entryd the church her bowellys and synowes began to
shrynke and she fyl down deed in ensaumple of all other wymmen / Whereby we may
understand that Iniurye done ageynste a saint / dysploseth gretely almighty
god / and fro thens saint austyn and his felawshyp came in to england / and
arrived in the isle of thanet in este kente / and king athelberte reigned that
time in kente / which was a noble man and a mighty / To whom saint austyn
sent showing the entente of his coming from the court of rome / and said that
he had brought to him right ioyeful and plesaunt tidings / And said that if
he would obey and do after his prechyng that he should have everlasting joy in
the bliss of heaven / and should regne with almighty god in his kingdom / And
then king adelston heeryng this / commanded that they should abide and tarry
in the same isle / And that / al things should be mynystred to them that were
necessary unto the time that he were otherwise aduysed / And sone after the
king came to them in the same isle / and he being in the field saint austyn
with his fellowship came and spoke with him having tofore them the sign of the
cross syngyng by the weye the letanye besechyng god deuoutely to strength
them and help and the king received him and his felawshyp / and in the same
place saint austyn preched a glorious sermon / and declared there to the king
the christian feythe openly and the great merit and avail that should come
thereof in time coming / and when he had ended his sermon / the king said to him
your promyses ben full fair that ye bring but by cause they be new and have
not ben herd here before / we may not yet give consent thereto / Nevertheless
by ceuse ye be come as pylgryms fro far contres / we will not be grievous ne
hard to you / but we will receive you mekely / and mynystre to you such
things as ben necessary / neither we will forbede you / but as many as ye can
convert to your feythe and relygyon by your prechyng ye shall have license to
baptyse them / and to accompanye them to your law / And then the king gave
to them a mancion in the cite of dorobernence / which now is called
caunterburye / And when they drew nigh the cite / they came in with a cross of
silver and with processyon syngyng the letanye / prayeng almighty god of socour
and help / that he would take aweye his wrath fro the cytee / and tenflawme
the hertes of the people to receive his doctrine /

And then saint austyn and his felawshyp began to preche there the word of
god / and about there in the prouynce and such people as were well despised
anon were converted and followed this holy man / and by the holy conversation
and miracles that they did / much people were converted and great fame aroos
in the contre / And when it came to his ere / anon he came to the presence of
saint austyn / and desired him to preche ageyn / and then the word of god so
enflamed him that Incontynente as soon as the sermon was ended the k^nge fyl
down to the feet of Saint austyn and said soroufully / alas woo is me that I
have erryd so long / and know not of him that thou spekest of / Thy promesses
ben so delectable that I think it all to long till I be crystened / wherefore
holy fader I require the to mynystre to me the sacrament of baptesme / And
then saint austyn seeing the great meekness and obedyence of the king that
he had to be crystened / he took him up wi^h weeping teerys / and baptized him
wyh all his howsholde and meyne / and enfor^^d them dyligently in the christian
^^ythe with great joy and gladness / and when all this was done / saint
austyn desyryng the health of the people of england / went forth on foot to
york / and when he came nyghe the cite / there met with him a blind man /
which said to him / O thou holy austyn / help me that am full nedy / To whom
saint austyn said I have no silver / but such as I have I give the / In the
name of Ih^u christ arise and be all hole / and with that word he received
his sight / and bylonyd in our lord and was baptized / And upon crystemas day
he baptized in the river named swale x thousand men without wymmen and children
And there was a great multitude of people resortyng to the said river / which
was so deep that no man might pass over on foot / and yet by miracle of our
lord there was neither man woman ne child drowned / But they that were seek
were maad ho ole both in body and in soul / and in the same place / they
bylded a church in the worship of god and saint austyn / And when Saint Austyn
had preched the feythe to the people / and bad confermed them steadfastly therein
/ he returned ageyn fro york / and by the weye he met a lepre askyng help /
and when saint austyn had said these words to him / In the name of Ihesu
Christ be thou clensyd from al thy lepre / Anon all his fylthe fyl aweye /
and a fair new skyn apperyd on his body so that he seemed all a new man /
Also as Saint Austyn came in to oxford shyre to a town that is called com^on
to preche the word of god / To whom the curate said / holy fader the lord of
this lordshyp has been oftymes wa^ned of me to pay his tithes to god / and yet
he wythholdeth them / and therefore I have cursed him / and I find him the more
obstynate / To whom saint austyn said / sone why payest thou not thy tithes to
god and to the church / know thou not that the tithes be not thyn but
bylongen to god / And then the knight said to him I know well that I tyle the
ground wherefore I ought as well to have the tenthe sheef as the ix / and when
saint austyn could not torn the knights entente / then he departed from him
and went to mass / and or he began / he charged that al they that there were
acursed should goo out of the church / and then roos a deed body and went
out in to the chircheyerde with a white clothe on his heed / and stood still
there till the mass were done / And then saint austyn went to him and
demanded him what he was / and he answered and said I was sometime lord of this
town / and because I would not pay my tithes to my curate / he acursed me and
so I deyed and went to hell / and then saint austyn bad him bring him to
the place where his curate was buried / And then the caryon brought him
thither to the grave / and by cause that al men should know that life and death
ben in the power of god / saint austyn said I commau^de the in the name of god
to arise / for we have need of the / and then he aroos anon and stood before
all the people / To whom saint Austyn said thou know well that our lord is
mercyful / and I demand the brother if thou know this man / and he said ye
/ would god that I had never known him / for he was a wythholder of his tithes
and in all his life an evil doar / thou know that our lord is mercyful / and
as long as the pains of he lle endure let us also be mercyful to al christian
/ and then saint austyn delyuerd to the curate a rod / and there the knight
knelyng on his knees was assoyled / and then he commanded him to goo ageyn
to his grave / and there to abide till the day of dome / and he entryd anon in
to his grave and forthwyth fyl to asshys and pouldre / And then saint austyn
said to the priest how long have thou layen here / and he said an hundred and
fyfty year / and then he asked how it stood with him and he said well holy
fader for I am in everlasting bliss / and then said saint austyn / wylt thou
that I pray to almighty god that thou abide here with us to conferme the
hertes of men in very believe / and then he said nay holy fader / for I am in
a place of rest and then said saint Austyn goo in pees / and pray for me
and for all holy church / and he then entered ageyn in to his grave / and
anon the body was turned in to earth /

Of this sight the lord was sore aferde and came al quakyng to saint austyn and
to his curate and demanded foryeuenes of his trespaas / and promised to make
amends / and ever after to pay his tithes / and to follow the doctrine of
saint austyn /

After this saint austyn entryd in to dorsetshyre / and came in to a town
where as were wicked people and refused his doctrine and prechyng utterly and
droof him out of the town castyng on him the tails of thornback or like
fisshes / wherefore he besought almighty god to show his Judgment on them / and
god sent to them a shameful token / For the children that were borne after in
that place had tails as it is said / till they had repented them / It is said
comynly that this fyl at strode in kente / but blessed be god at this day is no
such deformyte / Item in another place there were certain people which would
in no wise give feyth to his prechyng ne his doctrine / but scorned and mocqued
him wherefore god took such vengeance that they brennyd with fire Inuys^ble
so that their skyn was reed as blood and suffered so great pain / that they
were constrained to come and axe foryeuenes of saint austyn / and then he
prayed god for them that they might be acceptable to him and receive baptesme
and that he would relece their pain / and then he crystened them / and that
brennyng hete was quenchyd / and they were made parfytely hool / and fe^^e
never after more thereof /

On a time as Saint austyn was in his prayers / our lord apperyd to him and
comfortyng him with a gentyl and famylyer speech said / O thou my good servant
and true be thou comforted and do manly / For I thy lord god am with the in all thyn affeccion / and mine eerys ben open to thy prayers / and for whom thou
demaundest any petycion / thou shall have thy desire / And the yate of
everlasting life is open to the / where thou shall joy with me without end /
and in that same place / where our lord said these words he fyxed his staff
in to the ground / and a well of clear water sourded and sprange up in that
same place / the which well is called cerne / and it is in the contre of
dorsete / where as now is bylded a fair abbey and is named cerne after the
well / And the church is bylded in the same place where as our lord apperyd
to saint austyn / Also in the same contre was a young man that was lame dombe
and deef and by the prayers of saint austyn he was made hole / and then sone
after he was dyssolute and wanton / and noyed and greuyd the people with
iangelyng and talkyng in the church / And then god sent to him his old
Infyrmyte ageyn by cause of his mysguydyng / and at last he fill to
repentance / and asked god foryeuenes and saint austyn / and Saint austyn
prayed for him / and he was made hole ageyn the second time / and after that he
continued in good and virtuous living to his lives eyde /

And after this Saint Austyn full of virtues departed out of this world unto our
lord god / and lies buried at caunterbu rye in the abbay that he founded there
in the worship and rewle Where as our lord god shows yet daily many miracles
/ and the third day before the natyuyte of our lady is hallowed the translacion
of saint austyn / In which night a cytezeyn of caunterburye being that time at
wynchestre saw heaven open over the church of saint austyn / and a brennyng
laddre shynyg full bright / and angels coming down to the same church / And
then him thought that the church had brennyd of the great light and
bryghtnes that came down on the laddre / and merua^led gretely what this should
mean / For he knew no thing of the translacion of saint austyn / and when he
knew the truth that on that time the body of the glorious saint was
translated / he yaue lawde and thankynges to almighty god / and we may verayly
know by that euydent vysyon that it is an holy and a devout place / and as it
is said that of old time ancient holy men that used to come thither / would at
the enter of it do of their hosen and sho on and durst not presume to goo in to
that holy monasterye but barefoot / by cause so many holy saints ben there
shryned and buried / and god has showed so many miracles in that holy place
for his blessed saint / saint Austyn / that if I should al write them here / it
should ocupye a great book /

Then let us pray unto saint austyn fader and appostle of england by whom
this land was converted unto the cresten feythe / And by his ordenaunce
bysshoppes were ordained to mynystre the sacraments / that he be moyen unto
our lord Ihesu christ / that we may here so live according to his doctrine that
after this life we may come to everlasting bliss in heaven amen /

Thus ends the life of saint Austyn thappostle of england
Here next follows the life of Saint Germayn and first the inrtepretacion of
his name
gErmayn is said of germe and of ana that is hye / that is that there was
founden in the seed of germayn three souerayn things / that is hete natu^^l /
humor / and noresshyng / and reason of semence or seed / Germayn is said seed
bourgenyng / for he had in him hete by ardour of great dyleccion / humor by
eygrenes of devotion / and seed by virtue of his predycacion / by which he
engendryd much people to the feythe / And constancien the priest wrote h^s life
to saint Seueryn bishop of Ancerre /

Of Saint germayn
Saint Germayn was of much noble lygnage born in the cite of ancerre / and was
well learned in the arts lyberalle / and after he went to rome for to learn the
science of droyt and of the law / and there received he so much dygnyte /
that the senate sent him to the frensshe men for to have the rule and dygnyte
of burgoyn / and thus ^s he governed the cite of ancerre more dylygently than
the other / there was in the myddle of the cite a tree called a pynaple tree on
which were hanged on ye branches of this tree / for the mernayle of chase and
huntyng / the heedes of wild beestys that had been sleyne / But when saint
amadour which was bishop of this cite repreuyd them of such vanytees / and
warned them to hew down this tree / they would not consent thereto in any
manner / and on a time when germayn was not in the cite / the bishop did do
hew down this tree / and did do brenne hit / And when Germayn knew hit he was
much angry and forgate christian relygyon and came with a great multitude of
knytes for to have sleyne the bishop /

And then the bishop knew by reuelacion deuyne / that Saint Germayn should
be his successor / and forbear and yaue place to his hastynes / and went to
saint austyn / and after when he came ageyn to ancerre / he enclosed much
subtylly germayn within the church / and sacred him there / and said to him
that he should be his successor in the bishop rich / and so he was / for a
little after saint amadour deyed / and all the people required saint germayn to be
bishop and then he gave al his rychessys to pour people / and changed his
wife in to his suster / and tormented his body by the space of thyrty year /
that he never ete bread of whete / ne drank wine / ne used no potage / and
would have never salt to make his mete sauery / and two times in the year he
would drink wine / that was at ester and crystemas / and yet for to take aweye
the savor of the wine / he would put therein plente of ye water / and in his
refeccion he would take barley breed with ashes / and fasted every day / and
never ete but in the even / In winter ne somer he had but one clothyng / and
that was the hayr next his body / a cote and a gown / and if it happed so
that he gave not his vesture to sum pour body / he would were it till it were
broken and torn / his bed was enuyroned with ashes / hair / and sack
clothe / And his heed lay no hyer then his sholdres / but al day wept and
bare above his neck diverse relyques of saints / he ware none other clothyng
/ and he went often barefote / and selde ware any gyrdle / the life that he
ladde was above man's power / his life was so strayte and hard that it was
merueyle and pity to see his flesh / and was like a thing not credyble and
he did so many miracles / that if his merytes had not goon before they should
have been trowed fantasmes / In a time he was herberowed in a place where alwey
after sowper the tables were couerd when all men had sowped / whereof he
meruayled and demanded the host wherefore they couerd the tables ageyn after
sowper / and the host said it was for his neighbors that came to drink each
with other / And that night saint germayn concluded to watch for to see what
hit should be / it was not long after that there came in there a great
multitude of deuylles and sat at table in liknes of men and wymmen / And when
the holy man saw them / he commanded them that they should not depart / and
then sent to awake the host and all the neighbors and ghestys on al sides /
in such wise that every man and woman were founden in their howses / and he
maad al them to come and see if they knew any of them / and they said nay /
and then he showed them that they were deuyls / of whom the people was much
abashed / by cause the deuyls mocked them so /

And then saint germayn coniured them / and went their weye / and never
after returned / In a time Saint low bishop of troyes was byseged by the
king actylle / and saint low went upon the yate / and demanded who he was
that assyegyd and assailed them / and the king said to him I am he actylle the
scorge and rod of god / and then the meke bishop said to him sore weeping /
I am low that have wasted the flock of god / and have need of the scorgyng of
god and then saint low commanded to opene the yates / and all the people
of actyl were so by the will of god blinded / that they passed thorugh the
town and saw no men of the cite / ne did no hurt to no body / And then the
blessed saint low took saint germayn with him and went in to bretaygne where
as there were heresies / But when they were on the sea there aroos a right
great tempeste / which by the merytes of saint germayn was anon apeased /
Then they were honestlye received of the people of the country / whose coming
the deuyls that saint germayn had driven out of such bodies as were bis^ten /
had told their coming / and when they had been a while in england / and had
conuaynquysshed the heretykes / they returned in to their contrees and propre
places On a time it happed that saint germayn lay seek of a malady in a street
and the street was taken with fire / and men counceylled him to be borne thens
for peril of the fire / and then he put him self against the fire / and the
flawme burnt al about / and touched no thing that germayn lay in / Another
time he returned in to bretaygne for the heresies / and one of his dysciples
followed him hastily and fyl seek and lay down in a town and there deyed / and
when saint germayn returned thereby / he demanded to see the sepulture of his
dysciple which there was deed / and did do opene his sepulture / and he
called him by his name and demanded him what he did / and if he would no longer
goo with him and that other answered and said that he was well / and all things
were to him soft and sweet / and would no more come here / and the holy man
granted it him that he should abide in rest / And he remysed him self in his
grave and slepte in our lord /

He preached on a time in the contre of bretaygne in such wise that the king of
bretayne forbad him his hows and his people also / Then it happed that the
kings cowherde went to the pasture with his kyen / and received his porcyon
at kings paleys / and bare it to his lytyl hows / Then went saint germayn
and his felawshyp for to see where they might be lodged / And the cowherde
brought hem to his hows / and saw that they had great hungre / but he had not
mete for them and him / this cowherde had but one calfe / he slew it and gave
it to them and they took it debonayrly of the litel good that he had / and when
they had sowped and said graces / saint germayn did do gadre to gydre all the
bones of the calfe / and laid them under the skyn and after made his prayers
to god / and anon then the calfe aroos al alive and hole as he was tofore
And the next day after saint germayn demanded the king why he had for bode
him his hows / and the king was much abashed and c^ude not answer / Then
said saint germayn to him thou shall no more regne / but thou shall l^ue thy
royame to one better than the / and as they of saxon should fight against the
brytons / and they saw that they were but few / and saw the holy man pass
by / they called him And then saint germayn and his fellows preached so long
to them that they came to grace of baptesme / And on ester day they cast of
their armures / and by great desire of feyth purposed them to fight / and when
the other herd that / they purposed to goo against them hardely / for they
were dysseuerd / and saint germayn hid him alwey with his people / and warned
hem when he cried alleluya / they should answer with one voys / and when the
saints had cried alleluya / and the o^^er had answered / their enemies had so
great dread / that they threw al their harneys and armoures aweye / and wend
certeynly that all the mounteyns should fall on them / and also heaven / and so
they fled all afraid / On a time as saint germayn passed by angustynence /
and went to the tomb of saint cassyen / he inquired how it stood with him /
he answered to him out of the tomb wherein he lay and said I am in sweet rest
/ and abide the coming of the redemour / and he said to him rest in pees in
the name of our lord and pray for us deuoutely / that we may deserve the holy
joys of the resurrexyon / and when saint germayn came in rauenne / he was
received much honorably of Placyde the queen / and of valentynyen her sone /
and at sowper she sent to him a great vessel of silver full of delycyous mete
/ The which he received / and gave the mete to his servants / and retained
the vessel of silver for to give to the pour / And instead of this yefte / he
sent to the queen a dysshe of wood or of tree and a barley loof the which she
received gladly / and after did do cover that dysshe with silver and kept it
long in great devotion /

On a time that the said queen had desired him to dyne with her / he accorded
thereto gladly / and by cause he was weary of travail / of fasting and watchyng
he came upon an ass fro his hows unto the paleys / And anon as he was at
dinner his ass deyed / And when the queen knew that his ass was deed she was
much sorrowful / and did do present him a right fair and good horse / and when
the saint saw him so rychely aourned and apparaylled he would in no wise take
hit / but said show to me where mine ass is / For he that brought me hyder
shall bring me home ageyn / and then he went to his ass that lay deed and
said to him let us return home ageyn / and anon the ass aroos / and shoke
him as he had risen from sleep and that he had no harm / and then germayn
remounted on his ass and rode home / But tofore or he departed fro rauenne he
said that he should not be long in this world / and anon after he became seek
of the fevers / and the seventh day after he passed unto our lord /

And his body was born in to france as he had required to the queen / And he
deyed about the year of our lord four hundred and xx / Saint Germayn had
promised by his live to saint eusebe bishop of versayl that when he returned
he should halowe his church that he had founded / and when saint eusebe bishop
of versayl understood that he was deed / he would him self halowe his church /
and made to light the candellys and tapres / but the more they light them /
the more were they extyncte and put out / And when eusebe saw that / he
apperceyued that the dedycacyon was made or he would come and do hit / or else
of sum other bishop / and when the body of saint germayn was brought to
versaylle / as soon as it was entered in to the church / all the tapres were
light deuynely /

Then Saint eusebe remembryd the promesses of saint germayn / and that which
he promised living / he would do hit being deed / but it is not to be
understand of the great eusebe of versayl / that this was done in his time For
he deyed under valente the emperor and fro the death of him unto the death of
saint germayn was more than fyfty year fro that one to that other / but this
was another eusebe xnder whom this said thing was done /

Thus ends the life of saint Germayn
Here follows the life of saint peter thexorcisce or deken
Saint peter the deken was bounden with chains of iron in prison o^ one
archenne / whose daughter was vexyd of a fend / wherefore he was much sorouful
/ then said Saint peter to him that Ihesu christ should well hele her / if he
would believe in him / To whom arche^ne answered / I marvel much of the / by
cause thou suffrest so much for thy god And I see that he may not deliver the
Saint Peter said he will well that I suffer for to deserve the glory that all
weye shall endure / but he can well deliver me if he would and hele also thy
daughter / To whom archenne said I shall double thy chains / and if then thy
god may deliver the and also make my daughter hool / I shall believe in him / and
when that was done saint peter cladde in white clothys holdyng the sign of the
cross apperyd to him and then anon archenne fyl down to his feet / and his
daughter was made al hool / He then with all his hows received baptesme / and
he let out of prison all the christian men / and all them that would be christian
/

And he with many other that byleued were baptized of Saint marcellyn priest /
when the provost of Rome herd this / he made all the christian men come tofore
him / whom archenne gadred to gyder kyssyng their hondes and said That who would
come to be marterd should come hardely without dread / And he that dare not come
let him goo in pees where he will / and when the prouoste knew for certain
that saint peter and saint marcellyn had baytysed them / he made them come
tofore him / and departed that one fro that other / and put them so in prison
And saint marcellyn was laid naked upon broken glass without light or water /
and saint peter was enprysoned in a strayte place wherein he was strayned /
Then came an aungel fro heaven and vnbonde saint marcellyn and cladde him and
brought him with peter in to the hows of archenne / by cause they should seven
days comfort the people besyly /

After when he fond not marcellyn in prison where as he had set him / he
sent for archenne / and commanded him and his howsholde to do sacrefyse and
they would not obey to him / He put then him and his wife in to a pytte in the
earth / Then when saint marcellyn and saint peter herd tell thauenture of
archenne / they came to him and song mass in the same pytte with seven
christian men that deffendyd them / and after they said to the paynyms / we might
well if we would deliver archenne and hyde our self / but we will do neither /

Then the paynyms smote archenne with a sword thorugh the body and slew him
/ and after stoned to death his wife and his daughter / Then brought they
saint marcellyn and saint peter to the black isle / and there byheded them /
which place is called now candyda for their marterdom / and thus they suffered
marterdo^ the year of grace vij hundred four score and seven / and they that
smote of their heedes saw their sowles aourned with roses and precious stones
borne up to heaven by angels / One dorotheus that was one of them that byheded
them saw it wherefore he became christian / and lived after an holy life / and
after restyd in our lord /

Thus enden the lives of saint marcellyn and Peter
Here follows of saint pryme and felician and of thynterpretacion first of
their names
PRimus is as much to say as souereyn and great and Felician is as much to
say as a blessed or happy old man / Primus is said souerayn and great in
dygnyte for suffryng of his marterdom / and puyssaunt for thopperacion of
miracles / holy for the perfeccion of his life / and blessed for his glorious
fraycion / Felician is said happy old man not only for the auncyente of time
/ but for the reverence of dygnyte / for the rypenes of wysdom / and for the
weyghte of his manners /

Of saint Prime and felician
PRyme and felicyan were accused to the emperors dyoclesyan and maxymyan of
the preestys and bysshoppes of the ydolles to the end that they should do
sacrefyse and they said but if they so did their gods would do no thing for
them Then by the commandment of the empereurs they were shytte in prison
and bounden with chains of iron / but anon after the aungel vnbonde them and
presented them tofore the emperor / and when he found them fast and ferme in
the feythe / he did do beat them / and after that departed one of them fro that
other / and then said the prouoste to saint felycian / that he should have
pity on his old age / and that he should sacrefyse to their gods / Then
answered he loo I am four score year old / and it is thyrty year sithe I knew
the truth / and that I have purposed to serve god / which may well deliver me
fro thy hands / Then the prouoste did him be bounden / and made nails to be
driven in to his feet and hondes / and said to him / thou shall be in this
point so long till thou consent to us and shalt do our wylles / and when
the provost saw that he suffered his marterdom so gladly and so ioyously / he
did him to be tormented ageyn / and commanded that no thing should be
mynystred to him to ete / After this he maad saint pryme to come tofore him and
said to him / loo thy brother has consentyd to the saying of the emperor /
And therefore he is worshypped gretely in his paleys / do thou the same wise /
To whom he said though thou he the sone of the devil / yet in party thou
say that my brother h^^h consented to the decree of thy heavenly Emperor /
Then the prouoste was angry / and commanded to set fire and brenn^ his
sides / and boyllyng ^^ed do pour in to his mowthe in the presence of felycian
to fere him with all / And he drank it as swetely as it had be col^^ water /
Then the prouoste leyng (...) angry and araged / commanded two leons to be
put to them / which anon as they were put to them fyl down to their feet /
and stood before them like meke lambs / then after he sent two cruel beerys
/ which (...) as mylde and debonayr as the lions / There were in the place
that saw this well xij thousand men / of whom five hundred byleuyd in Ihesu
christ / Then the prouoste did the saints to be byheded / and threw their
bodies to dogs and to birds / but they never touched them and after this
christian men buried them / and these bl^ssyd saints were thus marterd the year
of our lord two hundred four sc^^e and seven / Then let us pray to these
saints that we may come to ^uer l^styng bliss in heaven AMEN /

Thus ends the passion of saints pryme and Felician
Here follows the life of saint Barnabe the appostle / And first the
interpretacion of his name
BArnabe is as much to say as the sone of him that comes / Or the sone of
consolacion / or the sone of a prophet / or a sone concludyng / he is four
times said a sone by four manners of exposicions he is said sone in escripture
by reason of generation / of erudycyon / of ymytacion / and of adopcion / he
was regenerate of Ihesu christ by baptesme / And he was taught by the gospel
and folowyd him by marterdom / and adopted by heavenly reward / and this was
towchyng him self / as towchyng other / he was coming / comfortyng /
prophecyeng / and concludyng / coming in rennyng and prechyng oueralle and that
apperyth / for he was fellow of saint poule comfortyng pour pepl^ and desolate
to pour people in gyuyng alms / To desolate in sendyng epistles in the name
of thappostles / prophecyeng for he floured by the spyrite of prophecye / in
concludyng / for he concluded a great multitude of people and converted them to
the feythe as it apperyth when he was sent to antyoche / and that says the
book called thactes of thappostles / as to the first he was a man and manlye to

Of saint barnabe thappostle
Saint barnabe was a deken and was borne in cypre and was one of the lxxij
disciples of our lord and is gretely praised in thystorye of thactes of
thappostles of many good things that were in him for he was right well informed
and ordynate / as well to him self as to god and to his neighbor / he was well
ordynate in him self after three virtues that been in the soul / that is to
say reason / desire and strength / he had reason enlumyned with the clerenes of
very knowleche / hereof is said in thactes of the appostles the xiiij chappyter
/ it is said there that there were in the church of antyoche doctors
prophets and great masters in holy screpture / emonge whom were barnabe
simon and many other great clerkys / yet had he desire well ordynate and
expurged fro the dust of al worldely affeccion / and thereof is found in
thactes of appostles the fourth chappytre / that he sold a field that he had /
and the valewe and prys thereof he laid at the feet of the appostles / and the
gloss says saint barnabe showed to us heryn that we ought leave the thing
that men should not put thereon their desire ne their hurt / and taught us to
despise gold and silver / by that that he laid the silver at feet of
thappostles / yet had he the virtue of the soul which is called strength well
affermyd with prowess of pacyence / and that may we see on the great things
and hye / that he emprysed / and on the great penaunces that he did / and on
the great torments and pains that he suffered / Great things then he
enprysed / and that may we see when he took upon him to convert so great a
cytee as was antyoche / For when Saint poul came in to Iherusalem / anon after
his conversion / and would accompanye him with the disciples they fled all
aweye like as sheep do fro wulues / But barnabe went anon to him and took and
brought him in to the company of thappostles / after he enforced his body with
great penaunces that he did / for he tormented hit with aspre and hard
fastings / yet was saint barnabe a man enforced to suffer pains and torments
/ For he and saint Poule abandonned their lives oueral for the love of our lord
Ihesu Christ / Secondly he was ordained as towchyng to god in beryng auctoryte
/ Mageste and bounte / he bare honor reverence unto the great auctorytee of
god / after that we find in the acts of appostles the xiij chappytre / when
the holy ghoost said / Take ye to me a part barnabe and powle for to do the
office that I have chosen them to / yet saint barnabe bare honor to the great
mageste of god / For when there should be done reverence to him and sacrefyse /
as to a god / and was called Iupyter as he that went before / and they called
powle mercurye / as a fair and wise speker / anon barnabe and poule rent and
tare their cotes / and cried all on hye ye people what do ye we ben mortal as
ye be / which warn you to torn and convert to the very god living Ihesu
christ / after saint barnabe bare reverence to the bounte of god after that is
founden in the acts of appostles the xv chappytre / Sum conuerses of the
Jews would mynysshe the bounte of the grace of god / and said that this grace
that our lord had done in his passion suffysed not to save us without
circumsycion / against this error poule and barnabe withstood vygorously and
showed to them appertely that the grace and bounte that god has done / is
suffycient without the law to our sauacion / After they sent to the appostles
this questyon / the which they sent anon thorugh the world epystles against
this folysshe error / after saint barnabe was right strongly well ordained
ageynste his neighbors / For all them that were commysed in his cure / he
nourisshed and fed / in word / in exaumple / and in bentfaytes / In word for
he pronounced to them the holy word of god and the gospel / hereof is said in
the acts of thappostles that poule and barnabe abode in antyoche prechyng the
word of god / that may be seen by the great multitude of people that he
converted in the cite of antyoche / for they converted so much people there
that the dysciples lost their specyal name / and were called christian men as the
other / yet nourisshed he them that he had charge of by good ensaumple / for
his life was to al them that saw him / as a myrrour of holiness / and
thexemplayr of al religyon / For he was in all his werkys noble and hardy / and
well embelisshed of all good werkys / and was full of the holy ghoost and
enlumyned and light in the feyth of our lord / al these four things been
touched of him in thactes of thappostles / yet nourisshed he them by benefaytes
in two manners / that is in alms temporal in admynystryng to the pour their
necessyte / and in other alms spyrytuel / in foryeuyng all rancour and evil
will / The first alms did saint barnabe / for he bare to such as were in
right great pouerte and myserye / that as was nedeful for them to live / For
after that we find in the acts of thappostles / there was a great famyne in
the time of claudyus the emperor / which famyne had agabus prophesied / and by
cause the dysciples that would return to their brethern in to Iudee / sent
unto the most auncien their almesses by the hands of barnabe and poule / the
second alms did saint barnabe when he pardoned his anger to Ioh^n surnamed
mark / For when the said Ioh^n which was one of the dysciples was departed
from the company of barnabe and of poule / he repented him and would return to
them and barnahe foryaue it him / and took him ageyn to his dysciple / but
poule would not receive him with him / Nevertheless that which was done
between them both / was by good entencion / for in this that barnabe took him
ageyn / we may see the swetenes of his pity / and in this that saint poul would
not receive him is showed the great favor of right that was in him / after
that the gloss says actuum xv / by cause this Ioh^n had be tofore the master
of the law to deffende the law of Ih^u christ And had not contained him
vygorously for to repreue them / but had been neglygent / For this reason Saint
Powle would not accord to receive him in to the company of the other /
Nevertheless this departing that Ioh^n was thus departed fro the company of
saint powle and fro the other was for no vice that was in him but for ye
sharpenes and enspyryng of the holy ghoost to the end that they might preche in
diverse places / after that it happed after for wha^ barnabe was on a time in
the cite o^ ycome / a man with a clear shynyng vysage apperyd by night to this
Ioh^n aforsaid his cosyn / and said to him thus / Johan have in the no
doubtau^ce but be strong and vygorous / For fro hensforth thou shall no more be
called Ioh^n / but thou shall be called right hye enhaunced / and when he had
told this to his cosyn saint barnabe he answered and said to him / keep ye well
that thou tell this vysyon to no man / for in the same form he apperyd to me
/ that night after when saint barnabe and saint paul had long preached in the
cite of antyoche / thau^gel of god apperyd to saint poule and said to him goo
hastelye in to Iherusalem / for thou shall find there sum of the brethern
that abide the / then barnabe would goo in to cipre to vysyte his frendys and
kynne that were there / and saint poul would goo to Iherusalem / thus departed
that one fro that other by entysement of the holy ghoost that so had ordained
hit / and when saint poul had showed to saint bernabe this that thaungel said /
saint bernabe answered to him / the will of god be done like as he has
ordained hit / I goo now in to cipre / and more herafter shall I not see the /
for there shall I end my life then he humbly knelid down and fyl to his feet
weeping / and saint poule which had compassyon of him / said unto him these
words by consolacion / Bernabe w^pe no more for our lord will that hit be so /
our lord has apperid to me this night and has said to me let not ne give
none empesshement to barnabe for to goo in to cipre / for he shall there
enlumyne many folk and shall suffer there marterdom / On a time that barnabas
and Ioh^n issued out of cipre / and found an enchauntour named helyas which
by his enchau^tement had taken aweye the sight from so^me / and after given it
to them ageyn / he was much contrary to them and would not suffer them enter
in to the temple / after this barnabe saw on a day men and wymmen being all
nakyd re^nyng thorugh the town / and made then great feste / whereof he was
much angry and gave his malediccion and curse to the t^mple / and suddenly a
great part thereof fyl down and slew a great part of the people / at last
saint barnabe came in to the cite of salamyne / but this enchau^tour aforsayd
moeuyd the people gretely against him / so much yt the Jews came and took him
/ and ladde him thorugh the cite with great shame and would have delyuerd him to
the Judge of the cite for to punysshe him / and to put him to death / but when
they herd say that a great and a puyssau^t man was come in to the cite which
was named eusebyus / and was of the lignage of the emperor nero / the Jews had
doubt that he would take him out of her hondes and let him goo / and therefore
anon they bond a cord about his neck and drew him out of the cite / and
there anon brent him / but yet the felon Jews were not satesfyed to marter
him so / For they took the bonys of him and put them in a vayssel of leed and
would have cast them in to the sea / but Ioh^n his disciple with ij other of
his disciples went by night in to the place and took the holy boones and buried
them in an holy place / then after that sichilbert says they abode in that
place unto the time of the emperor zenom and gelase the pope that was the year
of our lord vC / after that then as saint dorathe said they were fou^den by
the reuelacion of saint barnabe him self / and were fro thens translated in to
another place / and saint dorotheus says thus / barnabe preached first at Rome
of christ and was maad bishop of mylane /

Thus ends the life of saint Barnabe
Here folowtthe lives of saints vyte and modeste and first the ^nterpretacion
of their names
MOdeste is as much to say as attemperate / which is one of the cardynal
virtues / and two extremities goon round about every virtue / and the virtue
abides in the mids / and thextremytees of wysdom been trycherye and folly /
thextremytees of attemperaunce been thaccomplisshement of al flesshly desires
and to do after his will / Thextremytees of strength ben feeble courage and
folysshe / and thextremytees of Justice ben cruelte and defaulte / And therefore
modest was attemperate by the mean of virtues that were in him / Vyte is said
of vyta that is life / Saint austyn in libro de trinitate deuyseth of three
manners of life / that is the life doing that apperteyneth to actyf life / a life
idle that apperteyneth to ydlenes / and a life spyrituel which apperteyneth to
life contemplatyf / and this great manner of living was in him / Or vite is as
much to say as virtue or right virtuous /

Of Saint vite and Saint modeste
Saint Uite was a child much noble / that suffered marterdom in the age of xij
year / his fader beat him often by cause he despised the ydolles / but never for
betyng ne smytyng he would never worship them / when valeryen the provost of
lukes herd say hereof / he made him to come tofore him / and when saint vite
would not do sacrefyse for him ne for his words he did do beat him with great
staves / but the hands of them that beat him became dry and the hondes of
the prouoste also in such wise that they might not bewelde them / Then said
the provost alas alas I have lost mine hondes / then said to him the child
vyte / call thy gods / and pray them that they help the if they may then
said the prouoste may thou hele me / the child answered I may well hel^ the in
the name of my lord Ihesu christ / and anon he made his prayer and helyd him /
Then said the prouaste to his fader / chastyse thy sone to the end that he
deye not an evil death / Then his fader brought him ageyn to his own hows /
and made come to him harpes pypes and al manner Instruments that he might have
/ and after did do come maidens for to play with him / and made him to have al
manner of delyces that he might get to mollefye and change his heart / and
when he had been shette and enclosed in a chamber one day / there issued a
meruallous odor and sweet savor / whereof his fader and the meyne meruayled /
and when the fader looked in to the chamber he saw two angels syttyng by his
sone / and then said he the gods ben comen in to mine hows / and anon after
these words he was blind / Then assemblyd all the cite of Luques at the
cry of the fader / and the prouoste Valeryan came also / And demanded what it
was that was happed to him / And he said to him / I have seen in my hows the
gods also shynyng and bryghte as fire / And by cause I might not suffer the
clerenes I am becomen blind / Then led they him to the temple of Iouys and
promised unto him a bulle with horns of gold for to have ageyn his sight /

But when he saw hit auayled him no thing / he required his sone that he would
pray for him / And anon he maad his prayer unto god / and anon he was all
hool / Yet for all that he would not believe in god / But thought how he might
put his sone to death /

Then apperyd the aungel to a servant that kept him whose name was modeste
and said to him / take this child and led him unto a strange land / and
anon he fond a ship ready / and entryd therein / and so went out of the
contree / An aungel brought mete to them / and he did many miracles in the
contree where he was / Now it happed that dyoclesyan sone of the emperor had a
wicked spyryte in his body / and said openly that he would not goo out till ye
child of luques named vyte were comen / Anon he was sought all about the
country / and after when he was fou^den / he was brought to the emperor
Then he demanded if he might hele his sone / he answered I shall not hele him
/ but our lord shall /

And anon he laid his hand on him / and he was all hool / so that the devil
left him / Then said dyoclesyan / my child take counceyll in thy werkys /
and do sacrefyse unto our gods / to the end that thou deye not an evil death
/ And vyte answerde that he would never do sacrefyse to their gods / and
anon he was taken and put in prison with modest his servant / and leyed
mylstones upon their bodies / And anon the mylle stones fyl of / and the
prison began to shine of great light / and when it was told to the emperor /
they were taken out of prison / and after saint vyte was cast in to a fire
brennyng but by the might of god he issued out hool and sauf without suffryng
of any harm /

Then was there brought a terryble lion for to devour him / but anon by
the virtue of the feythe he became meke and debonayr / after the emperor made
him to be hanged on a gybette with modeste and crescencia hrs nouryce which
alweye followed him / Then anon thayer began to trouble and thondre / the
earth to tremble / the temples of the ydolles to fall down / and slew many /
The emperor was a ferde and smote him self on the breast with his fyste saying
alas alas / a child has overcome me / then came an aungel that vnbonde them
/ and fond them self by a ryueer / and there restyng and prayeng rendryd their
sowles unto our lord god / whose bodies were kept of eglys / and afterward by
the reuelacion of saint vyte / a noble lady named florencia took the bodies and
buried them worshypfully /

They suffered marterdom under dyoclesyan about the year of our lord two
hundred four score and seven / It happed afterward that a gentelman of france
bare aweye the heedes and put them in a church which is a mile fro lusarches
named fosses / and closed them in a wall unto the time that he myt set them
more honorably / But he deyed or he might parfourme hit / So that the heedes
were there where as no man living knew where they were Hit happed so after
that there was certain work in that church / and when the wall was broken
where the heedes lay / and were dyscouerd / the bellys of that church began
to sown by them self / Then assembled the people to the church and fond a
writing which devised how they had be brought thither / and then they were
laid more honorably and set then they were tofore / and there then were
showed many miracles / Then let us pray to these glorious saints that it
may plese them to pray to god for us in such wise that we may by their
merytes and prayers come to the glory of heaven / to which bring us the fader
and sone and holy ghoost amen /

Thus enden the lives of saint vyte modest and crescence
Here follows the life of Saint Quyryne and Iulitte
QUyryne* was sone of a noble l^dy of yconye which lady w^ld flee the
persecucion / and she went with her sone quyryne which then was but three
year old / in to the cite of tharse in celysye / And she was there presented
to Alysaundre the prouoste / and bare her child in her arms / which when her
two chamberers saw that / anon they fled and left her allone / Then the
provost took the child in his arms / And Iulytte his mother refusyng to do
sacrefyse / made her to be scourged with raw synewes / and when the child
saw his mother beten he wept bytterlye and made a lamentable noise / but the
prouoste took it in his arms and daunced it upon his knees / and would fayn
plese the child with kyssynges and fair words / The child alweye beholding
his mother / abhorred the kyssynges of the prouoste / and turned his heed aweye
from him with great Indygnacion and cratched his face with his nails / and
gave his cries consonaunte unto his mother / as he should have said / and I am
also christian / Then he bote the provost and wrastlyng with him all to
cratched him / Then the Prouoste having Indygnacyon hereof and in a great
anger threw down the child of the stappes where as he satte in Judgment /
that the tender brayn fyl a broad out of his heed upon the stappes / Then
Iulytte seeing her sone goo to heaven tofore her / gave thankynges unto god / and
she was thereof right glad / Then it was commanded that Iulytte should be
flayne / and brennyng pytche cast on her / and at last her heed to be
smyten of /

And it is found in another legende that quyryne despised the tyraunte as well
when he glosed him as when he blamed him / and confessyd him to be christian /
how be hit that he was over young to speak / but the holy ghoost spoke in him /
when then the provost demanded of him who had so taute him / He answered and
said o thou prouoste I marvel much thy folly / which see me so young of
age not being yet three year old / and demaundest who has taught me this
dyuyne wysdom / thou may clearly e se^hat it comes fro god / when the child
was beten he cried I am christian / and the more that he cried / the more
strength emonge the torments he received / And the Judge did do dysmembre the
mother with the child / and al to hew them in pyeces / and by cause their
membris should not be buried of the christian people / he commanded that they
should be cast and dysperpled a broad / But not wythstondyng they were of an
aungel gadred to gyder / and in the night buried by the christian people / whose
bodies were showed in the time of constantyn the great wha^ pees was in the
church by a maid which had been one of her chamberers that tho yet lived and
were had of all the people in great devotion / They suffered marterdom about the
year of our lord CCC and thyrty under alysaunder /

Thus ends the life of saint quyryn and his mother Iulitte
Here follows the life next of saint maryne
MAryne was a noble vyrgyn and was one only daughter to her fader without
brother or suster / and after the death of her mother / her fader entryd in to a
monastery of religyon / and changed thabbyte of his daughter / so that she
seemed and was taken for his sone and not a woman / then the fader prayed
thabbot and his brethern that they would receive his only sone whom at his
Instaunce they received for to be a monk / and was called of them al brother
maryne / he began to live right religyously and to be much obedye^t when she
Was xxvij year / and her fader approached toward the death / he called his
daughter to him confermyng her in her good purpoos / commaundyng her that in no
wise she should show ne do be known that she were a woman / and then her
fader deyed / she went oftymes to the wood with the carte to fetch home wood /
and by cause it was far fro the monasterye / other while she lodged in a good
man's hows / whose daughter had conceived a child by a knight / And when it
was perceived / she was thereof examyned / who had begoten that child and she
said that it was the monk maryne had leyen by her and gotten it / and then
anon the fader and mother went to the abbay / and maad a great compleynte and
a great clamor to thabbot for his monk maryne / Then thabbot being hereof
sore abashed sent for maryne and demanded of him why he had done so horrible
a sin / And he mekely answered and said holy fader I ask of our lord mercy
for I have sinned / Then the abbot heryng this was much angry for the sorrow
and shame / and commanded anon that he should be put out of the hows / And
then this maryne full patiently went out of the monasterye / and dwellid at
the yate three year and lived straytly with a morsel of breed a day / and when
the child was wened fro the moders pappe / it was sent to thabbot and he
sent it to maryne / and bad him keep such tresour as he had brought forth /
and then he took mekelye and pacyently the child and kept it with him there
two year / Al these things he took in great pacyence / and in all things gave
to our lord thankynges / and at last the brethern had pity on him and
consyderyd his humylyte and pacyence and did so much to thabbot that he was
taken in to the monasterye / and all the offices that were most foul were
enjoined to him for to do / he took it all gladly / and all things he did
pacyently and deuoutely / and at the last being full of virtuous life she deyed
and departed out of this world / When they should take up the body and wasshe it
for to dyspose hit to be buried / they saw that she was a woman / all they
were astonyed and aferde / and knowleched that they had tr^spaced gretely in
the servant of god / Then they ran all for to see the sight and asked
foryeuenes of their ygnoraunce and trespaas / Then bare they the body of her
in to the church / And there honorably they buried it / Then she that
enfamed the servant of god was taken and vexyd with a devil / And knowlechyng
her sin came to the sepulcre of the blessed vyrgyne / and there was delyuerd
and made al hool To whose tomb the people oueral there about came and
assemblyd / and there our lord showed many miracles for his blessed vyrgyn
maryne / she deyed the xiiij kalendys of Iuyl /

Thus ends the life of saint Maryne
Here folowen the lives of saint geruase and prothase and first of the
ynterpretacion of their names
^Eruase is said of gerar which is as much to say as a vessel or holy / or of
gena that is to say strange / and of syor that is little / For he was holy by
merit of his life / a vessayl for to receive virtues in him self / strange by
despysyng of the world / and he was little by despysyng of him self /

Prothays is said of prothos why che is as much to say as first / and of syon
that is dyuyn / Or prothas may be said of procul / that is far / and of
stasis that is set / that is to say he was first by dygnyte / he was dyuyn by
dyleccion / and far set fro worldly affecaon / And Saint Ambrose fond
their passion written in a book founden in the sepulture at their heed /

Of saint geruase and prothase.
Saint geruase and saint prothase were brethern of one burden of fader and
mother / their fader was saint vytal / and their mother the blessed valerye /
which gave all their goods unto the pour for the love of god / and dwelled
with saint nazaryen which made a right fair oratoyr in the cite of hebredune /
And a child named celsus bare to him the stones / and if nazaryen had then
the child celsus or none I wot never / For the hystorye of nazaryen reherced
that celsus was offryd to him long after / and when they were offryd and ladde
to nero the emperor / this child celsus followed them much sore weeping / and
one of the knights buffeted and smote him / and nazaryen then blamyd him /
Then the knights in a great anger beat and defowleden nazaryen under their
feet / and after they put this celse with the other in prison / and after that
they threw him in to the sea / and ladde geruase and prothase to melan / And
nazaryen was delyuerd by miracle and came to melan / In that time there came
thither the earl astase which went in battle ageyn them of marcomannos /
which came against him Then the kepers of the ydolles came to him and said
that their gods would give none answer / but if geruase and prothase should
first offer to them and do sacrefyse / Then anon were they brought and
led for to sacrefyse and then geruase said / that all the ydolles were deef
and dombe / and that he should require help of almighty god / Then the earl
was wroth and commanded him to be beten with scorges of leed so long till he
gave up his spyrite / and so suffryd death / Then he commanded prothase to
be brout to him to whom he said / thou cursyd wretch now think to save thy
life / and deye not an evil death with thy brother / To Whom prothase said who
is a wretch / I that dread the not or thou that dredest me / To whom of
tasyus said / how should I dread the wretch / To whom prothase said / In that
thou dredest me that thou sholdest be hurt by me if I made not sacrefyse to
thy gods / if thou dreddest not to be hurt of me / thou would never
compelle me to the sacrefyse of ydollys / Then the prouoste commanded him to
be hanged on a gybet / then said prothase to him / I am not angry with the /
For I see thyn eyes of thyn heart blinded / and I have great pity of the by
cause thou see not what thou do but do that thou have begone / that this
day the benygnyte of our savior may bring me to my brother / Then the earl
commanded him that his heed should be smyton of / and thus he suffered marterdom
for our lord / Phelyp a servant of Ihesu christ with his sone took the bodies
and buried them secretly in his hows in a tomb of stone / and laid a book at
her heedes conteynyng their natyuyte / their life / and their end /

And they suffered death under nero / abowte the year of our lord lvj / These
bodies were hyd there many yerys / but in the time of saint ambrose they were
founden in this manner / Saint ambrose was in prayer in the church of saint
felyce and saint nabor in such wise that he neither slepte ne woke holy there
apperyd to him two young men clad in whyt vestementys with one cote and mantel
and hosed / and they apperyd prayeng with him with their hondes holden up /
Then saint ambrose prayed that if it were illusyon that it should appear
no more / And if it were truth / that it should be showed him / Then when
the cock crewe the yonglynges apperyd to him adouryng with him in semblable
manner / and at the third time they apperyd the third night / when he had
fasted and slepte not / And with them apperyd saint peter the appostle after
that he had seen him in paynture Then the yonglynges said no thing but the
appostle spoke / These ben they that desire none erthely thing / but have
followed mine admonestementes / And these been they of whom thou shalt find
the bodies in such a place / And there thou shall find an arche of stones
couerd with xij feet of earth / and thou shall find at their heedes a litel
book wherein is contained their birth and their end /

Then saint ambrose called all his neighbors / and began first to dygge the
earth / and fond like as thappostle had said to him / and they had layn in
that place well a three hundred year and they were as fresshe as they had been
laid there that same hour / and a right sweet savor issued out of their
tomb / and in contynent a blind man touched the byer / and anon he had his
sight ageyn / and many other seek people were helyd by the merytes of them /
and in their solempnytees pees was reformed between the lombardes and the
emperor of Rome / And then Saint gregory the pope establisshed for the
Introyte of ye mass of them / Loquetur dominus pacem / and this office
aperteyned in party to the saints / and in party to the great adventures
that were in that time / And saint austyn reherceth in the book of the cite of
god that he was present and the emperor and much great company that a blind
man received his sight at melan at the bodies of Geruase and prothase / but it
is not known whether hit was the same blind man or no / Also he tells in
the same book that there was a young man in a town named victoryan rode his
horse in to a river that lay there by and as soon as he was therein / the devil
strangled him / and threw him in the water all deed / and whiles they songen
euensonge in a church of saint geruase and prothase which was there by / he
was smyton with the voyses of them that song / that he sterte up a live and in
a great haste he entryd in to the church in a great dread and held fast the
altar like as he had be bounden thereto / then the devil menaced him and said
if he would not come thens he would break all his membrys / and a little while
after by the merytes of the holy marters he was plainly helyd / and saint
ambrose says in his preface / These ben they that by the heavenly baner took
tharmes of the appostles and vaynquysshed and have the vyctorye / and ben
assoyled fro the snares of the world / they destroyed the felawshyp of the
fend / and followed freely without any empesshement our lord Ihesu christ / like
unto a debonayr fraternity / that so learned the holy words that no fylthe was
medlyd emonge them / O how glorious a stryf was this that causes them both to

Thus enden the lives of saint Geruase and saint prothase
Here follows the life of saint Edward king and marter
Saint edward the young king and marter was the sone of king edgare and he was
king but iij year and seven months and when his own mother was deed his
fader the king wedded another wife which was full wicked / and by her he had a
sone named ethelrede / This queen labored sore for to destroy this young king
edward / for to make her own sone athelrede king / And litel loved the king
edward / For then king edgar was deed which had been a good Iustyser in
chastysyng rebellys / and cherysshyng good and Well dysposed people / for he had
a blessed and an holy man saint dunsto^ which was chyef of his counceyl and
was much ruled by him / and in that time was joy and myrthe in all england /
And the queen thorugh entysyng of the fend our enemy labored ever and
awayted for to destroy this young king edward / and so it happed that this
said young king Edward rood on huntyng with his knights in the wode of dorset
beside the town of warham / and there in the chaas it happed the king to
depart aweye from his men / and rode forth allone to see his brother athelrede
which was thereby with the queen his mother in the castle named corf / but when
the queen saw him there being allone she was ioyeful and glad in her heart
hopyng then taccomplysshe that / which she sore had labored fore / and
went to the king and welcomed him with fair and blaundysshyng words / and
commanded to fetch bread and wine to the king and whiles the king drank the
botelyer took a knyf and roof the king thorugh the body to the heart / in
such wise that the king fyl down deed / And anon then the queen's
servants buried the body in a desolate place of the wode / to the end that
no man should know where he were becomen / And when saint dunston knew that
the king was so murdered / he maad much great sorrow / and in short time
after yet a part against his will he crowned her sone ethelrede king / And
then he said to the king / for as much as by manslaughter and wrong thou
art comen to be king thou shall therefore have great sorrow and trowble to thy
lives end / And al shall fall for the death of thy brother edward / who that
will know the sorrow that fyl / may see it in the life of saint alphey / and
there he shall see what sorrow there fyl / and al was for the death of this
saint Edward / And all the pour people of this land sorowed gretely for this
good kings death / and in especyal by cause they could not know where he was
buried For they would burye him much worshypfully if they might find him / And
in a time as god would / men of warham and of the contre be goon for to seek
this holy body of saint edward with great devotion prayeng our lord that they
might have knowleche where the holy body was / and sone after one of them that
so sought saw a great light in a desolate place of the wode in liknes of a
pyler of fire stratchyng fro heaven even unto the grave / where the holy body
lay in /

And then the people full reverently dygged up the body / and brought it with
solemn processyon to the church of warham / and they buried this holy body
in the church yerde at the este end of the church / for they durst not do
otherwise for dysplesure of ye queen But now over that grave is bylded a fair
chapel of our lady / and in the place where he was first buried is now a right
fair well / which is called saint edwardes well where our lord shows many
miracles for his holy marter saint edward /

And in like wise in the chapel at warham where as his holy body lay long /
our lord shows also miracles but long time after by the labor of the earl
alphere which much louyd saint edward the bysshoppes and clergy by the
counceyl of saint wylfryde and saint edythe susters of Saint edward and nonnes
at wylton / the holy body was take out of the chapel of warham and brought
with great solempnyte unto the nonnerye of shaftesburye / And by the way as
men bare this holy body / two creples were made al hole and followed the holy
body with great joy and myrthe thankyng god and the holy saint of their health
/ and when they came to shaftesburye / they laid this holy body in the wall
by the hye altar right worshypfully / where our board showed many miracles for
him and when the queen his stepmoder herd tell what miracles god showed for
him / then she repented her full sore / and cried god mercy and the holy saint
for her trespaas / and purposyd to ride thither to do worship to the holy body
/ and there to ask foryeuenes of the death that she had co^mysed to be done in
him / but when she would have ryden thyderward her horse would not goo forth in
no wise / for betyng ne drawyng / and then she light down and went thither
full mekely on her feet / and often in her journey she repentyd her of that
cursed deed / That she had caused to be done to this holy saint Edward / and
when she came to shaftesburye / where as this holy body was buried / she did
full great reverence thereto / and cried god mercy / and the holy saint for her
great offense / and after this she became a full good woman / and had great
repentance thereof unto her lives end / and after when the holy body had
restyd in the wall certain yeris / Saint edward apperyd to an holy religyous
man and bad him goo to dame althrede abbess of that place / and say to her
that she purueye that his body should be laid in a more worshypful place And
then she went to saint dunston to pray him of his help in this matere /
and sone after saint dunston came with a multitude of bisshoppes / abbottes /
pryours / and of the clergy / And took up this holy body and laid it in a
worshypful shryne / which the abbess and other well dysposed people had
ordained for hit / And when his body was take out of the wall / there came out
of the grave a flauour like a smoke of frankencence smellyng / so sweet that
all the people were gretely comforted thereby / and thus this holy king and
marter was translated in the year of our lord a thousand and somewhat more / and
when king etheldrede was deed / edward his sone reigned after him / which was
an holy and glorious king and confessor / And lies buried at westmestre /
and worshypfully shryned / where as our lord has showed many a great miracle
for him /

Then let us pray to this holy marter saint Edward king / and to saint
Edward king and confessor that they pray to our lord for us that we may in
this wretchyd world so amend and repent us of our wretchyd life that when we
shall depart hens / we may come to his everlasting life in heaven amen

Here ends the life of Saint Edward king and marter
Here follows the life of saint Albone / and of saint amphiabel
AFter that Iulyus Cezar the first emperor of rome had divided the land of
france and he made a shyppynge in to great brytaygne / which now is called
england / in the time of cassybelan king of the brytons / and twyes he was
driven out / and the third time by the help of one androgeus duc of kente he
had vyctorye and conqueryd the royame / and subdued it to Rome and made it to
pay yearly trybute / and ordained and stablisshed certain statutes in this
land which were long obseruyd and kept / Emonge which he ordained that
none of this land should receive the order of knyghthode but only at rome by
the hands of the emperor / lest perauenture the rude people and unworthy would
take upon them that order unworthily which is of great dygnyte / and also they
should make an oath never to rebelle ne bear arms ageynste the emperor /
which statutes were used in all places obedyent to rome and under their
subieccion Then reigned in the land of britayne which now is called england a
king named seuerus / which for to plese the emperor Dyoclesyan sent his
sone that hight bassyan / with many other lords sons of cornewayl / walys /
scotlond and yrelond unto the nombre of a thousand five hundred and xl / Emonge
which was a princes sone of walys in great array / which hight amphyable a
goodly young man and well lernyd in latin / frensshe greek / and hebrewe / Also
there was in his felawshyp a lords sone of the the cite of verolamye named
albone / which was a well disposed and semely young man and dyscrete in his
governance / And al this felawshyp came prosperouslye to rome / In the time
when Zephyrus was pope of rome / which saw the great bewtee of this young
company / and had compassyon that they were not christian / And labored as
much as he might to convert them to the feythe of Ihesu christ / and emonge
al other he converted the princes sone of wales amphyabele and baptized him /
and informed him secretly in the feythe / and then this holy amphyabel
forsook the pomp and glory of the world / and took on him wylful pouerte for
the love of Ihesu christ and ever after continued his life in perfeccion / Also
there were many other conuertyd at that time / whom dyoclesyan did do seek /
but none could he find / Then he ordained a day in which these young men
should receive thordre of knyghthode of themperours hand / And he him self
gyrded their swerdes about them / and informed them the rule and estate of the
order / And when all the cerymonyes were done longyng to the order / and the
oath sworen / bassyanus sone of king seuerus desired of the Emperor that he
might preue the feetes of knyghthode there in Iustyng and torneyeng / which
was granted to him and gretelye allowed for his manly desire and noble request
/ In which torneye and Iustes bassyanus and his felawshyp had the prys and
vyctorye /

And emonge al other albone was the best knight and most best preuyd in
strength / wherefore he had a souerayn name tofore al other / whose arms was of
asure / with a sawtyre of gold / which arms afterward bare the noble king
off a first fou^der of the monasterye called saint albons / and he beryng the
arms had ever glorious vyctorye / And after his death he left tho arms in the
monasterye of saint albons / Then when bassyanus and his felawshyp had long
soiourned in rome they axed license of the emperor to return home in to
britaygne / which the emperor granted to them all / saufe to albone whom
for his manlynes and prowess he would reteyne for to be in his seruyse about
his person / and so he abode with him there seven year / And after for diverse
causes maxymyan which was fellow to dyoclesyan was sent in to britayne with a
great army for to subdue the rebellys with whom albone came and was ordained
prince of his knights / and so entrid in to brytaygne ageyn /

In that time saint poncyan satte in the sea at rome which by him self and
virtuous men that preached / and by showing of miracles converted unto the
feythe of Ihesu christ / and cristenyd in the cite of rome lxvj thousand men
and when the emperor herd hereof / he assemblyd all the senators / and
kings princes and lords of every land / being under thobeysau^ce of rome to
have aduys how he might destroy the christian faith / and then it was
concluded that the pope should be dampened with al his christian people and be
punysshed with diverse torments / And that all the books of criste^ law should
be burnt / and chirches thrown down / and all men of holy church to be
slain in every place / which ordenaunce when it was known emonge the christian
people of rome of diverse parties of the world / Then they went and departed
in to their own contre / Emonge whom saint amphyable which long had dwelled
at rome departed and came home in to brytayne ageyn where he was borne / And
so came unto verolamye where as none would receive him in to his hows / and
walked about in the streets abydyng the comfort of god / And then it happed
he met with albone which was lord of that cytee and prince of the knights
and steward of the land having about him a great multitude of servants /
and at that time albone was rychely arrayed with clothes frengyd with gold / to
whom all the people did great worship / Then amphyabel which had left the
arms of a knight / was arrayed like a clerk / knew well albone / but albone
knew him not / how be hit they had been tofore both in one felawshyp / and
desired and prayed albone of herberough for the love of god / which Albone
without faynyng / as he that alwey loved to do hospytalite granted him
herberugh / and well received him and gave to him mete and drink necessary for
him / And after when his servants were departed he went unto this pilgrim
secretly / and said to him in this wise / How is it said he that thou art a
christian man and come in to these parties unhurt of the gentyles / To whom
saint amphyabel said / My lord Ihesu criste the sone of the living god has
surely conduyted me / and has kept me by his power fro all parylles /

And that same lord has sent me in to this land to preche and denounce to
the people the feythe of Ihesu christ to the end that they should be made people
acceptable to him / To whom albone said what is he that is the sone of god
whom ye afferme to be Ih^u criste and sone of the vyrgyne / these been new
things to me for I have not herd of them / I would fayn know what christian men
feel thereof / Then amphyabel expowned to him and declared our feythe and
believe / In which anon albone dysputed ageyn and said that by reason it might
not le / and so departed fro him / and the next night after saint albone saw
in his dreme all the mysterye of our faith as well how the second person of
the trynyte came down and took our nature and becam man and suffered death and
of his resurrexyon and his assencion whereof he was gretely troubled and came on
the morn to amphyabel / and told him what he had dremyd / and then saint
amphyabel thanked our lord / and so informed him in the feythe / that saint
albone was steadfast in the believe of Ihesu christ /

And thus kept his master amphyabel in his hows vj wekys and more And alwey
in a place named tygurryum they held their holy comynycacion so long till at
last they were espied / and compleyned on unto the Judge / wherefore the Judge
sent for albone and for the clerk / and by cause the clerk should goo in to
walys saint albone did do clothe him like a knyt and lad him out of the town /
and departed with many teerys / and commendyd each other to our lord / And
after Saint albone was sent fore / which came having on him the clerkys array
and clothyng beryng a cross and an image of our lord hangyng thereon / to the
end that they should know verayly that he were a christian man / and the men
that came for him drew him cruelly to the Judge askepodot / And when the
paynyms saw him bear the sign of the cross / which was unknown to them /
they were sore trowbled and aferde /

Then the cruel Judge demanded him whose servant he had be and of what
kynrede / and by cause he would not tell he was much wroth / but emo^ge many
questyons he told him that his name was albone / and that he was a very
christian man /

Then the Judge demanded him where the clerk was / that entryd in to the
cite now late spekyng of christ / he is come for to begyle and deceive our
cytezeyns / know ye well he would have comen unto our presence but that his
conscience has remeuyd him / and has mystruste in his cause / and gyle and
falsenes is hyd under his doctrine / Thou may well know and euydently
understand / that thou have given thy consent to a folyssh man / Wherefore
forsake his doctrine / and repent the and make satysfaccion for thy trespaas
in doing sacrefyse to our gods / and that done thou shalt not only have
foryeuenes of thy sin / But thou shall have towns and prouynces / men gold
and power /

Then said albone to the Judge / O thou Judge the words and menaces that thou
have spoken been but vain and superflue / It is openly known that this
clerk if it had thought him good and proffytable / and also if our both
hertes had accorded thereto he had come to thyn audyence / but I would not
assente thereto / knowing that this people is ever ready to do evil / I knowleche
that I have received his doctrine and repent me no thing thereof / For the
feythe that I have received restores the feeble and seek to their hele for the
deed preuyth hit / This feyth is more dear to me then all the richesse ^^at
thou promysest me / and more precious then all the worship that thou purposest
to give me / For sh^rtely your gods ben false and fayllyng / For they that
most besely serve them been most wretchydly dysceyued / Then came anon
forth a great multitude of paynyms and with force and strength wol^ compelle
him to do sacrefyse / and commanded him to offer to the gods / but in no
wise he would not consent to their cursed rytes / And by the commandment of
the Judge he was taken and stratched a broad to be scourged / and as he was
grievously beten / he turned him to our lord with a glad ^ vysage / and said my
Lord Ihesu christ / I beseech the keep my mind that it meue not / ne that it
fall fro the estate that thou have set hit in / For lord with all my heart
I offer my soul to the in very sacrafyse / And I desire to be made thy
witness by shedyng of my blood / These words sowned he emonge his betynges /
and the tormentours beat him so long that their hondes wexyd weary / and the
people hoped that saint Albone would change his purpoos / and therefore he was
kept under the governance of the Judge vj wekys and more / and all that time
the Elements bare wytnes of the Iniurye done to holy albone / For fro the time
of his taking unto the time that he was delyuerd fro the bonds of his flesh
/ there came never dew ne rain upon the earth / But brennyng hete of the
son / and also in the nyghtes all that time was insufferable hete / so that
neither trees ne feldes brought forth no fruit / And thus the elements
foughten for this holy man against the wicked men And the Judge askepodot dredde
for to slay him by cause of the great love that the emperor had to him / and
for reverence of his dygnyte and power of his kynrede / unto the time that he
had informed dyoclesyan of his conversation / And when the emperor had seen
the lettres / anon maxymyan came in to brytayne for to destroy the feythe of
Ihesu criste / and was commanded that no christian man should be spared sauf
only albone / whom they should entrete to peruerte him by fair promysses /
and to fere him by menaces / and so to compelle him to torn ageyn to their
sect / and if he would in no wise leave the christian feyth / then he to have
capytal sentence and be byheded by so^me knight for the worship of the order of
knyghthode / And the clerk that converted him to suffer the fowlest death that
could be ymagyned / that the byholders thereof may have dread and horror of
semblable pains / And when maxymyan came in to brytaygne he took with him the
king askepodot / and went strayte to the cite of verolamye for to fylle the
commandment of the emperor / And then saint albone was brought forth
tofore them out of prison / and by all the weyes that they could ymagyne they
tempted to peruerte him / But the holy man was constaunt and ferme in the
feythe / whereof they having Indygnacion ordained a day of Justice / which day
comen they gave sentence first on amphyabel / that where ever he were founden
he should be scourged / and after bounden to a stake all naked / and then his
nauel to be opened and his bowels to be fastenyd by that one end to the stake
/ and he then to be driven to goo round about the stake till al his bowellys
were wou^den out about the stake / and after to have his heed smyten of / and
as towchyng saint albone they yaue sentence that he should be byheded / Which
sentences were given under writing / Then all the burgeyses of verolamye of
london and other towns abowte were so^moned to come the next thursday
following for to here the Judgment and see the execusyon upon albone prince of
knights and steward of britaygne / at which day came people without nombre foe
to see this said execucyon / And then was albone brought out of prison whom
they desired to make sacrefyse to Iubyter and Appollyn / which utterly refused
it / but preached the feythe of christ that he conuertyd much people to be
crystenyd / Then maxymyan and Askepodot yafe fynall sentence on him thus
saying / In the time of the Emperor dyoclesyan / albone lord of verolamye
prince of knights and stewa^d of all brytayne during his life / has despised
Iubiter and appollyn our gods and to them has do derogacyon and dysworshyp
/ wherefore by the law he is Iuged to be deed by the hand of sum knight /
and the body to be buried in the same place where his heed shall be smyton of /
and his sepulture to be made worshypfully for thonoure of knyghthode / whereof
he was prince and also the cross that he bare / and sklauyn that he ware should
be buried with him / and his body to be closyd in a cheste of leed and so laid
in his sepulture / This sentence has the law ordained by cause he has renyed
our pryncypal gods /

Then aroos a great murmour emo^ge the people and said that they ought not to
suffer such Iniurye done to so noble and so good a man / and specially his
kynrede and friends which labored full sore for his delyueraunce / whereof
albone was aferde to be delyueryd fro his passion at their request and
Instaunce / and stood up holdyng the cross lokyng toward heaven and saying lord
god Ihesu christ I beseech the that thou suffer not the fend to prevail
against me by his deceytes / and that the people let not my marterdom / And
then he turned to the people saying / wherefore tarry ye and lose the time and
why execute not ye on me the sentence / for I let you wit I am a great enemy
to your gods / which have no power ne may do no thing / ne here ne see ne
understand / to whom none of you would be like / O what vanytee / and what
blyndenesse is emo^ge you to worship such ydollys / and will not know Ihesu
christ the only sone of god and his very true law / Then the paynyms
spoke to gyder and assented that he should be put to death and they chose a
place where he should be executed named holmesherst /

But then aroos a contencion emo^ge the people what death he should suffer
Sum would have him crucefyed like as christ was / and other would hane him
buried quycke / but the Judge and the people of the cite would have him byheded
according to the commau^deme^t of the emperor / and so he was ladde forth
toward his marterdom / and all the people to the place following this holy man
with despytous words and rebukes / whereto the blessed man albone answered no
word / but mekelye and pacyently suffered all their repreuys / and the people
were so great a multitude that they ocupyed all the place which was large and
great /

And the heet of the son was so great that it burnt and scalded their feet
as they went / and so they ladde him till they came to a swyfte rennyng river
/ where they might not lightly pass for prees of people / for many were shyfte
over the bridge in to the water and were drowned / and many by cause they might
not goo over the bridge for prees / unclothed them for to swymme over the
river / and so^me that could not swymme presumed to do the same / and were
wretchydlye drowned whereof was a great rumoure and noise pytously emonge the
people And when Saint albone perceived this thyynge / he waybed and wept for
the harm and death of his enemies that so were perisshed / And knelyd down
holdyng his hondes up to god besechyng that the water might be lassed and the
flood wythdrawen that the people might be with him at his passion / and
forthwyth god showed at request of saint albone a fair miracle / for the
water wythdrewe and the river dried up in such wise that the people might
saufly goo dry foot over the river / and also by the prayer of this holy man /
they that tofore had be drowned were restored ageyn to life / and were founden a
live in the depnes of the river /

And then one of the knights that drew saint albone toward his marterdom
saw these miracles that god showed for him / and anon threw aweye his sword
and fyl down at the feet of saint albone / saying I knowleche to god mine error
/ and demand foryeuenes and wept sore and said O albone servant of god for
verayly thy god is almighty / and there is none god but he / and therefore I
knowleche me to be his servant during my life / for this river by thy prayers
is made dry / wherefore I bear wytnes that there is no god but thy god which
does such miracles / And when he had said thus their furye and woodnes
encreced / and said to him thou art false / For it is not as thou say ne as
thou affermest / For this river is thus dried by the benygnyte of our gods /
and therefore we worship Iubyter and appollyn / which for our ease have take up
this water by this great hete / and by cause thou take aweye the worship of
our gods / and rewardest it to other by evil Interpretacion thou have
deserved the pain which longs to a blasphemar And then forthwyth they
drew out his tethe of his heed / and the holy mowthe that had borne witness
of truth was grievously beten with so many of them / that or they left they
tare all the membris of his body and to brake al his bones / and all to rent
his body / and left him lyeng upon the sonde /

But who might without weeping of teerys express how this holy man albone was
drawn and led thorugh briars and thorns and sharp stones / that the blood
of his feet colored the way as they went in / and the stones were blody /
Then at last they came to the hylle where this holy albone should fynysshe
and end his life / In which place lay a great multitude of people nygh deed
for hete of the son and for thirst / and when they saw albone they grynted
with their tethe on him for anger saying / O thou most wicked man how great is
thy wickedness that make us to deye with thy sorcerye and wytchecrafte / in
this great myserye and hete / Then albone having pity on them sorowed by
great affeccion for them / and said lord that made man's body of earth / and
his soul unto thy liknesse suffer not these creatures to perisshe for any
cause commysed in me / and blessed lord make the air attemperate / and send
them water to refresshe them / And then anon the wind blewe a fresshe cole
/ and also at the feet of this holy man albone sprange up a fair well whereof
all the people meruayled to see the cold water spring up in the hot sondy
ground / and so high on the top of an hylle / which water flowyd al about
and in large stremys rennyng down the hylle /

And then the people ran to the water and drank so that they were well
refresshed / and thus by the merytes of saint albone their thurst was clean
quenchyd / but yet for all the great goodness that was showed they thursted
strongely the blood of this holy man and his death / and gave the praysyng and
lawde to their gods / and took this holy mand and bound him first to a stake
/ and after hynge him on a boughe by the here of his heed / and sought emonge
the people one to smite of his heed / and then a cruel man was ready / and in
an anger took his sword and smote of the heed of this holy man at one stroke /
that the body fyl to ground / and the head hynge stylle on the boughe / and
the tormentour as he had smyten of his heed / both his eyes sterte out of his
heed / and the wretch might in no wise be restoryd ageyn to his syghte /

Then many of the paynyms said that this vengeance came of great ritwysnesse
/ Then the knight which was left for deed upon the sonde a lityl before /
enforced him self as much as he might and crepte upon his hondes unto the
top of the hylle / whereas saint albone was byheded / And the Judge seeing him
began to scorn him and all the miracles that had been showed by saint alboue /
and said to him / o thou lame and crooked now pray to thyn albone / that he
restore the to thy first health / run and hye the and take the heed by which
thou may receive thyn hele / why taryest thou so long / goo and burye his
body and do him service / Then this knight brennyng in charity said I believe
fermelye that the blessed albone by his merits may get to me parfyte health /
and get to me of our lord that / which ye say in scorn / and when he had
thus said he took and enbraced the holy heed in his arms / and reverently
losed hit fro the boughe and set it fair to the body / and by the miracle of
our lord he was forthwith restoryd to his first health / and forthwyth began
to preche the great power of our lord Ih^u christ and of the merytes of saint
Albone / And then he was strenger to labor than ever he was tofore / whereof
he yafe thankynges and lawde to god and to this holy marter saint Albone / And
there in the same place he buried the holy body / and laid a fair tomb over
him / and afterward the paynyms took this knight and bond him to a stake and
after smote of his heed that same day / and after the Judge gave license to the
people to depart and goo home / and the night after was seen a clear b^me
coming down fro heaven to the sepulcre of saint albone / by which angels
descendyd and assendyd all the night during syngyng heavenly songs emonge
which this song was herd / Albone the glorious man is a noble martyr of
Ihesu christ / and the people came to behold this sight / Wherefore many were
turned from their false believe / and byleuyd in Ihesu christ / and many of them
sone after went in to walys for to seche amphyabel for to be baptized and
informed in the feythe of Ihesu christ / and there they fond him prechyng the
word of god / And then they told him how that albone was marterd and for a
token they brought the cross which he held in his hand and was yet blody
of his blood / whereby he might euydentelye know that he had suffered death /
Whereof this holy man gave lawde and thankynges to our lord / and maad then
unto them a noble sermon in such wise as all that people that came fro
verolamye were baptized and received the feythe / and sone after the Judge had
knowleche of the departing of this people fro the cytee / and were gone in to
walys to receive the feythe of amphyabel / saint albons master / Whereof he was
much angry and sore moeuyd / and enquyryd of the nombre of them that were gone
/ and he fond a thousand and moo whose names were wryton / and then he
ordained a multitude of people well armed and in deffence for to seche amphyabel
and those people that were goon to him / Which went in to walys and there
fond all these people awaytyng on amphyabel and heryng him preche the word of
god / to whom one of them that were so sent said to amphyabel O thou
dysceyuer and most wicked of all men / why have thou disceyued this people
with thy deceyuable prechyng steryng them to forsake our true laws and gods
/ command them to leave their error and to return home ageyn to our cite /
and if thou do not / We shall slay al them / and bring the to our cite there
to be tormentyd / to the death / To whom one of the christian men said certeynly
/ this man is the verey true servant of god for whom god does and shewyth
daily miracles / and we al knowleche us to be very true christian men / and be
ready for the love of the feyth of our lord Ihesu christ to suffer death / for
to have therefore our reward in heaven everlasting joy and bliss / and
counceyl you to be baptized and to receive the feythe of christ / and when the
paynyms herd this they in a great furye ran upon all that blessed company /
and cruelly slew / which gladly offered them self to suffer death for our lord
/ There the fader slew the sone and the sone the fader / brother slew brother
/ and cosyns their cosyns / Then the holy man amphyabel seeing this blessed
company thus cruelly put to death / recomended their sowles to almighty god /
and then the tormentours took amphyabel and swear by their gods that they
would bring him to verolamye quycke or deed / and bond his hondes behind him
fast / and drew him forth going a foot / and they rydyng that his feet bledde
grievously / till they came to the place where saint albone was buried / and by
the way there was a seek man which was going fro verolamye toward amphyabel
for to receive the feythe / and he cried to amphiabel for to be releuyd of his
sekenes / whom the paynyms scorned / and amphiabel by ye name of our lord made
him al hole / and his bonds that his hondes were bound with were losid /
whereof so^me of the paynyms glorefyed our lord / they said that amphyabel was
brought and should come / whereof they of the cite were glad and supposed he
should have forsake his feyth but the tormentours took and bond him not with
stondyng that he always preched the word of god / And one of them told to them
how that their friends were slain / and what miracles god showed for them at
their death / in such wise that many were converted to the faith / And the
people ran out of the cite to the place where as this holy man was and stood /
Which was at that tomb of saint albon / and one of those tormentours in a
great furye took this holy man and bond him fast / And after opened his nauel
and took out one end of his bowellis / And fastened it to a stake which he
pyght in the ground / and made the holy man to goo round about the stake /
and droof him with whippes and beat him till that his bowellys were wounden out
of his body / And in all this pain this holy man yaf no token of sorrow ne of
disease / And then in their wodenes they run upon him with speres and
swerdys to compelle him to run about / till all were drawn out / which was
a merueylle to the people that he so pacientely myt endure such greuouse
torments so long / wherefore many of them forsook their ydolles / and becam
christian / And when the Judge saw and knew that the people were becomen christian
he commanded to slay them incontinent / and so there were slain to the nombre of
a thousand people / which amphyabel saw and thanked god recommandyng to him
their sowles / and then the tormentours seeing yet the life in this holy man
cast stones at him and stoned him and he always perseuerid in prechyng to them
/ and counseylled them to be baptized / And they should have foryeuenes of al
their sins / and the yates of heaven should be opened to them / But they cessed
not of their cruel castyng of stones / Tthenne at last this holy man
amphyabel lift up his eyes in to heaven besechyng our lord to receive his
spirit And then he saw saint albon stondyng emonge the angellys to whom he
said / O holy saint albon I beseech the that thou pray to our lord for me /
that hit plese him to send his angel to lead me surely that I be not let in
my way be the cursyd ennemy the fend / And uneath he had said the word but
two angellys descended fro heaven and said to him this day shall thou be in
heaven with albon / And when the paynems herd this heavenly voys / They were
sore aferd and abashed / And the angelys took his soul with heavenly song and
myrthe / and bare it unto heaven / And so departed this holy soul from the body
/ And the paynems perseueryng in their malice threw always stones at the deed
body / and anon after fyl a debate among the paynems that each faught with
other / and in the mean while a crsten man stale away the body and hyd it / And
anon after our lord shewde a great miracle / And that was that the vysages of
the tormentours were dysfygured / their hondes / arms and other membrys dreyed
up / And the Judge lost his mind and was mad / By cause they stroof again the
will of god / And suffered great pain afterward And thus suffered this two holy
martres saint albon and saint amphyabel martyrdom and death for the faith of
Ihesu christ Which by their merytes bring us unto his ever lastyng bliss Amen

Thus enden the passions and martyrdom of saint Albone And saint Amphiabel

prechyng / and in forgoyng prerogatyf of preparacyon or making ready / All
these virtuous things were in him /

Of saint Johan Baptist
THe Natyuyte of saint Johan baptyste was ancient and showed by the archaungel
gabryel in this manner / It is said in thystorye scolastyke that dauyd the king
wyllyng to encrece and make more the seruyse of god / Instytued xxiiij
bysshoppes or high preestys of whom one was ouerest and grettest and was
named prince af the preestys / and he ordained that each priest should serve a
weke / abias was one and had the viij weke / of whose kynrede Zacharyas was
descendyd / fader of Saint Johan baptyste / This Zacharye had to wife one of the
daughters of the kynrede of aaron / whose name was elysabeth daughter of esmeria
which was suster of saint anne mother of our lady Then this Elysabeth and our
lady were cosyns germayns / daughters of two susters / These two Zacharye and
his wife elizabeth were Just tofore our lord living in all the Iustyficacions /
and holdyng all the commandments of the law without murmr ne compleynt
preysyng and thankyng our lord god / They had no children for the holy woman
was bareyn / They had great desire to have a sone that might be bishop of the
law by succession of lygnage after Zacharye / And hereof had they in their
yongthe prayed much to our lord / but when it plesyd not unto our lord they
took it a worth and thanked god of all / They served the more deuoutely our
lord god For they had no charge but only to serve and entende unto him / Many
there be that withdraw them fro the service and love of our lord for the love
of their children / They were both old he and his wife Elysabeth / It happed
at a solempnyte that the Jews had after august / that the bishop did holy
sacrefise in doing the office that apperteyned to him and to his weke / he
went for to encence and entryd in to the temple / and the people abode without
making their prayers and awaytyng the coming ageyn to them of the holy bishop
/ Thus as he was allone and encencyd the altar / The aungel gabryel apperyd to
him stondyng on the right side of the altar / and when the holy bishop saw
him he was abashed and had great dread / The aungel said to him / be no thing
aferde Zacharye thy prayers ben herd / And have fou^den grace tofore our lord
/ Elysabeth thy wife shall conceive and bear a sone whom thou shall call Johan
of whom thou shall have great gladness And much people shall make great feste
and joy of his natyuyte / For he shall be great and of great merit tofore our
lord / He shall not drink wine / ne syther / ne thing whereof he might be
dronken / and in his moders womb he shall be sayntefyed and fulfilled with the
holy ghoost / he shall convert many of the sons of Israhel that is to say of
the Jews to our lord And shall goo tofore him in the spirit and virtue of
helye the prophet / for to convert fader and sons / old and myscreauntes to
the sens of rightwysnesse / and to the service of god / When the aungel had
thus said to Zacharye / he answered how may I believe and know that this is
troth that thou say / I am now a^olde and auncyen / and my wife old and
bareyn The aungel answered and said / I am gabryel the aungel and servant
tofore god which in his name am sent to speak to the and to show to the these
things aforsayd / and by cause thou have not byleuyd me thou shalt l^se thy
speech / and shall not speak till the day / that this which I have said shall be
accomplisshed each thing in his time The people were abydyng and awaytyng when
Zacharye the bishop should come out / and meruayled where he tarried so long /
he came out of the temple / but he might not speak / but the holy man made to
them signs / by which they thought well that he had seen sum vysyon of our
lord / but more knew they not / he abode in the temple all that weke / and
after went home to his hows / his wife conceived and wax great / and when she
perceived it she was shamefaste / and kept her in her hows well five monethys /
In the syxthe monethe the same aungel Gabrye was sent from our lord unto the
blessed vyrgyn marye newly espowsed to Joseph / which showed the concepcion of
Ihesu criste sone of god our lord / and the aungel told to her that she should
conceive of the holy ghooste without knowleche of man / for our lord may do all that it pleases him / like as it apperyth said he of Elysabeth thy cosyn the
which she being old of age and bareyn by nature of her body / has conceived
by the pleasure of our lord / and has now borne abowte vj months / when our
lady herd that saint elizabeth her cosyn was great she went to vysyte and
accompanye her in the montayns where she dwelled / right far hard and evil
way / When she came thither / she salewyd her much courtoyslye / Our lady was
then great with the blessed sone of god our lord Ihesu christ / whom she had
conceived when she said to the aungel / Ecce ancilla d^miny / And then she
was replenysshed with the deyte and humanyte of our lord Ihesu Christ /

Then when the salutacyon issued out of the body of our lady / the gretyng
entryd in to the eerys of the body of Saint Elyzabeth / and in to her child
that she had within her / which child was enoynte of the blessed holy ghoost
/ and by the presence of our lord sayntefyed in the womb of his mother / and
replenysshed with grace / whereof he remeuyd him for joy in his moders womb /
in making to our lord reverence such as he might make not of him self / but by
the grace that he had received of the holy ghoost / Of which by the merytes
and grace done to the blessed child saint Elysabeth was replenysshed / And
anon prophesied in saying and cryeng within high voys / Thou art blessed
emonge and above all wymmen / and blessed be the fruit of thy womb From
whens comes to me such grace so great / that the mother of my lord comes to
vysyte me / I know well that thou have conceived the sone of god / For as soon as thy salutacyon entrid in to mine eerys / the child that is in my belly made
joy and feste and remeuyd thou art well blessed and happy that thou have given
feythe and byleuyd the words of the aungel / which he said to the / for all
things shall be performed that he has said to the /

Of all these things saint elysabeth knew no thing when our lady came ne
yet our lady had no thing said to her / but the holy ghoost by the merits of
her holy child that she bare replepysshed her and made her to prophecye Then
answered our lady and made the holy psalm saying / Magnificat aia^mea dominum /
and all the remenaunte / Our lady abode with Saint elysabeth three months or
there aboutes / till she was delyuerd and laid a bed and it is said that she
did the office and seruyse to receive Saint Johan Baptyst when he was borne /

When then he was borne / and the neighbors and cosyns and frendys knew the
grace that our lord had done these holy folk noble of lygnage / rich of
goods / and of great dygnyte to whom in the end of their age he had given an
heyr male against double or treble nature /

They maad great joy and feste with them / when the viij day came and the
child should be circumsyced / they called him after his faders name Zacharyas /
The mother said that he should be named Johan and not Zacharye / And they went
unto the fader / and said that there was none in that kynrede that so was
called /

And then the fader demanded pe^ne and ynke and wrote / Johannes est nomen
eius / Johan is his name / And all they merueyled / Anon after by the merytes
of saint Johan his faders mowthe was opened / and had ageyn his speech / and
spoke glorefyeng our lord god /

And these tidings of this holy child thus borne were anon spradde all
about the contreye / And each man said in his heart / and withoutforth one to
another / what suppose ye shall be of this child / he shall be great and a man
of our lord /

For he is al ready now with him / and the hand / the work and the virtue of
our lord is with him / The fader holy Zacharye replenysshed with the holy
ghoost said and prophesied / and made then the holy psalm / Benedictus
dominus deus israhel / which psalm is alwey songen in the end of matyns / It is
said that holy zacharye dwelled upon the montayns two mile nyghe to Iherusalem
/ and there Saint Johan baptyst was borne / and after that saint Johan was
circumcysed / he was nourisshed as a child of a noble and rich man and sone
of great dygnyte / But when he had understanding and strength of body / god our
lord and the heart performed the work / he issued out of his faders hows /
and left richesses honors / dygnytees / noblesse / and all the world / and
went in to deserte on from jordan / Sum say he went in the eage of xv year
accomplisshed / And other say he departed at xij year of eage for to serve our
lord without empesshement / by which he kept scilence and bydwonge his life
and his soul fro idle words / This holy saint Ioh^an dwelling in deserte ware
an heyr maad of the heyr of camellys /

Sum say that he ware the skin of a camel in which he had maad an hole to
put his heed in / and gyrded it with a gyrdle of wulle / or of lether cut out
of an hyde or a bestys skin He ete locustes not such as we have here / that
we call honey sokellys / Sum say that it is flesh of sum beestys that
habou^de in deserte of Iudee where he baptized / with wild honey he ete it /
That it was flesh the legende of saint austyn does us to understand / which
says that Saint austyn ete flesh by the exaumple of helye the prophet /
which ete the flessh that a crow brought to him / and so saint Johan ete
locustes / sum say that there ben roots so called / There served he our
lord solytarylye upon the flome Jordan / till that he was about xxix year old
/ the aungel of our lord came to him and said that he should show the coming of
our lord / and preche penance for to purge them that were baptized in a
customyng the baptesme of our lord Ihesu christ / This aungel said to saint
Johan baptyste that Ihesu christ saueour of the world should come to him for to
be baptized / and it should be he on whom the holy ghoost should descend in
semblaunce of a dowue / Saint Johan drew him toward bethanye upon the river or
deserte not fer fro Iherusalem / there preached he and taught / and baptized
them that would amend their life / and said to them that the savior and health
of the world was nyghe / Then came to him many / and he said to sum
religyous men of evil life / ye children of serpentys / who has given to you
counceyl to eschew the ire of our lord if ye will be baptized in sign of
penance / do ye the works of penytentes / leave the evil / humble you / do the
work of mercy / wene ye by cause ye be circumsysed and be the children of
abraham / that ye shall be saved / Our lord shall make of these stones if it
plese him the child of abraham which with abraham shall be sauyd / Saint Johan
preached about a year tofore that our lord came to him for to be bap^ysed /

When the pharysees herd say that he baptized / they sent to know what he
was / and they demanded if he were christ the great prophet that was promised
in their law / and he said nay they demanded hem if he were help and comen
fro paradyse tere^stre / He said nay / They demanded him if he was a proph^te
/ he said nay / They demanded him whereof he medlyd then to baptyse / sithe
he was neither christ / ne help / ne prophet / Say to us said they who that
thou art that we may answer to them that have sent us hither /

He answered I am he of whom ysaye prophesied / I am the voys of the cryar in
deserte / Adresse ye and make ready the ways to god / and make ye right the
paths of our lord / They said to him wherefore baptysest thou then / He
answered I baptyse and wasshe the body with water in sign af penance / but
emonge you is he that ye know not / which was tofore me / and came after me /
of whom I am not worthy to lose the latchet of his shoo / He shall give you
baptesme in the virtue of the holy ghoost in water and fire of penance / when
Saint Johan alonge the flome Jordan had preached and baptized about a year Our
Lord came unto him and would be baptized of him / Saint Johan enlumyned of the
holy ghoost knew him / And did to him reverence as to his god his maker and
lord / He was so espyred that humayn nature which was pure in him might not
sustain so great knowleche / And he said right humbly / Sir thou come to me
which art pure and clean to be baptized and wasshen of me that am foul and
wasted which ought to be baptized of the and wasshen / how dare I lay on the
mine hands / Our lord said to him do this that I say now / For thus behooves it
to fulfylle all Justice / and to hum^le and give ensaumple of baptesme to al
people and then in humylite and pacyence he baptized our lord and wysshe him
where he had never fylthe /

And al by holy mysterye / on whom the holy ghooste dyscendyd vysybly in
lykenes of a down /

And the voys of the fader was herd saying here is my well beloved sone / in
whom I am plesyd / Then our lord was thyrty year old fro his natyuyte and
xiij days beginning of the xxxj year /

On that same day our lord changed water in to wine in chana galylee / And
this suffyseth for the natyuyte of saint Johan baptest / and the resydue of his
life and of his death shall be said at the feste of his decolacyon by the grace
of god who bring us to his bliss Amen /

Thus ends the natiuite of saint Johan Baptiste
Th life of Saint Loey
Saint Loye was borne in the contre of lymoges / his fader was named eucherye /
and his mother terrigia / what time his mother was conceived with him / she saw
in her sleep an egle flee over her bed / and thryes bowed and enclyned to her
/ and promised to her sum thing / and with the voys of the egle she awoke /
and was much abashed / and began to think what her dreme might sygnefye /
and when the time came of chyldyng and that she should be delyuerd / she was in
great parylle / and anon she sent for an holy man to come and pray for her /
When the good man was come anon he said to her / have no doubt dame ne dread
/ for this child shall be h^ly and much great in the church / and after that
he was borne this child grew in virtue / and his fader set him to
goldsmythes craft / and when he knew well the craft and art of goldsmythrye
he came in to france and dwelled with a goldsmyth that made work for the
king / Hit happed that time that the king sought for one that could make for
him a sadle of gold and of precious stones / Then the master of saint loye
said to the king that he had founden a werkman that should right well make what
someuer he would / The king delyueryd to him a great mass of gold / which
mass the master delyuerd to saint loye / whereof he made two right fair
sadels / and presented that one to the king / and that other he retained him
self / when the king saw this sadyl so fair / he and all his people
meruayled much thereof and the king rewarded him much largely / Then after
this saint loye presented to the king that other sadyll saying to him that of
the remenaunte of the gold he had maad the same / And then was the king more
esmerueylled than he was tofore / and demanded how he might make these ij
sadellys of that weight that was delyuerd to him / saint loye said well by the
pleasure of god / then grew the name and fame of him in the kings court /
Saint loye louyd well pour people / for all that he wanne and might win / he
destrybued it to them in so much / that often he was almost naked / The pour
people also louyd him / that where he went they followed him / and that they
that would speak with him must ask and inquire of the pour people where he was
/ On a time it happed that as he deled alms with his own hand / there was
a pour man that had his hand styffe and lame / And put forth the better hand
to receive the alms / Then Saint Loye said to him that he should put forth
that other hand Which as well as he might he put forth / Saint Loye took and
handled it and enoynted it with a litel oil and anon it was guarisshe and
hool Another time when he had given to the pour people all the gold and silver
that he had / many other pour men came and demanded of him alms and
beholding him self that he had no more to give / Anon he departed emonge them a
marcke of gold that he had borrowed of his neighbor / and anon after came moo
pour folk to demand alms / he put his hand anon to his purse / for he
remembryd not that it was void / and by the will of god he fond therein a
marcke of gold / and when he had found that he began gretely to thank our
lord god thereof / and destribued it and departed it to the pour people for the
love of god / He was of hye stature reed of vysage and angelyk of simple and
prudente regard and chere / at the beginning he was cladde with precious
vestementys of gold aourned with gemmys and ouches / and ware gylte gyrdellis
with precious stones / but under that on his bare flesh he ware alweye the
hayr / after this he gave al his precious vesture to the pour people for to
socour them in their necessyt^es / And fro than forthou he used alweye simple
and pour clothyng and often despoyled him self for to clothe the pour people /
and when the king saw him in such wise / he gave to him his own vestementes
and gyrdellys / for he louyd him as his propre soul / And abandoned to him all
his hows and commanded to al his folk that all that saint loye would have /
should be delyuerd to him without delay / and all he gave and destribued to
pour folk prysonners and to seek / Fro the time of Bruneshylde queen unto the
time of dagoherte the pestylence of symonye reigned strongly which for to take
aweye and destroy / saint loye and saint Onen labored sore / Then was saint
loye chosen bishop of noyon after achayre bishop of the said cite / and with
him was chosen saint onen archebysshop of Roen / saint loye was pastor
spyrituel of tournay cite ryal of noyon of gaunte and of all flaundres and of
courtray / he had a certain place in which by certain days he called to pour
and seek men and served them deuoutely / And made clean their heedes and wysshe
them / and them that were lowsy and full of vermyne he him self would pyke and
make them clean / and gave hem mete and drink / and clothyd them and when they
departed anon came other to whom he did in like wise and when great company
came sometime he made them to sytte down and refresshed them all / but every
day at the least he had twelve / the which he made sytte down / and at certain
hour ete and drank with hem / but first he wysshe their hondes and served
them / On a time he Impetred and gate of the king / that all the bodies that
were dampened to death that he could find in towns and citees hanged and
ratted that he might take them down and burye them / and ordained men of his
cellegys to do it / It happed on a time that in the company of the king in
the parties of arastrye in a town named strabor / he fond a man that was
hanged that same day / and was then deed and men made the sepulture for to
bury him in / And Saint Loye approchyd him / and began to take him down / and
apperceyued that the soul was in the body / he would not appropre the miracle
to him but keep him fro vaynglorye / and said full swetely / o what evil have
we done for to let this man to be take of if god almighty have not helped us /
The soul is yet in his body / when he was raised he was cladde and he did him
to take his rest / when they that had made him to deye knew hit / they would
have made him receive death ageyn / and with great pain Saint loye delyuerd
him fro their hands / Yet be gate lettres of grace for him for to be more sure
/

There was a priest in his dyosyce which was Infamed / and often he repreuyd
him and exhorted to be confessyd but the priest alwey heled his sin When
saint loye saw that his fair admonycion auayled not he excomyned and acursed
him and deffendyd him that he should no more sing mass / unto the time he had
done open penance / The priest set naught by his commandment ne deffen
(...) despytyng his sentence / a little (...) this the said priest would goo
sing mass / and as he approached unto the aul^er he fyl down to ground and
deyed / Many other miracles did he by his live and does yet / he edefyed at
noyon the ancellys of Ihesu christ / By him god showed the body of saint
quyntyn / he fond at faysons the bodies of two brethern germayns marters /
saint cryspyn and cryspynyen and ordained a precious vessel to put them in / he
fond also at beauuays the body of saint lucyen which was of the company of
saint quyntyn / which he put in a precious vessel /

At paris upon the great bridge he maad a blind man to see / the sextayn of
the church of saint colombe at paris came to saint loye and said to him that
theuys had born aweye by night all the Iewellys and paremens of the said church
/

Then saint loye went in to the orratorye of saint colombe and said to her /
herke thou colombe what I say to the / My redemptour will that anon thou bring
ageyn thornamentes of this church that have been take aweye Or I shall in such
wise close the dorys with thorns / that never herafter thou shall in this
place be served ne worshypped / when he had said thus he departed / on the
morn the sextayn of the said church that was called marturyn rose up and
fond all the paremens and Iewellys that had be borne aweye / and were set in
the place as they had been tofore /

Saint loye did do ordeyne much rychely the body of saint germayn / and the
bodies of saint seueryn / Saint platon / saint quyntyne / saint lucyen saint
genouefe / saint colombe / Saint maxyme / saint Iulyen / and specially of saint
martyn at tours by dagoberte the king / and the tomb of Saint bryce / and
another tomb where the body of saint martyn had be long in and the hows of
saint deuys the marter at paris / and the teguryon of marble which is upon him
of meruayllous work of gold and of ge^mes when saint loye deyed he was lxx
year (...) end of the year he was (...) in to another place / And was found
also fresshe and with out rotyng as he had been a live in his sepulture / Now
here ye yet a more great miracle / his berde and his heerys were shaven when he
deyed / But in his tomb when he was translated they were found as great and
long as they had alweye grown in his tomb /

Thus ends the life of saint Loye
And begins the life of Saint wyllyam
Saint wyllya^ was drawn out of noble lignage / in his chyldehode he was made
chanonne of paris and of soysson / and when he came to parfyte age and was a
man ripe and attemperyd he might no more suffer the pestylencys and the perils
of this deceyuable world / but brake all the bonds of the world and went
unto a deserte named gran monte / and lived there a great while in pure
conscience and in holy contemplacion / but as he ladde this life there grew on
him a great trybulacyon that he had great fere that the tranquylite of his
contemplacion might be troubeled / and went in to an abbey of cisteaux / and
there he was professyd and prouffyted much in virtues fro than forth on / and
after he was there made pryour / Afterward he was translated from thens in to
another abbey / that is called karolosence / and there by eleccion he was
chosen abbotte And there in all humylite he treatyd debonayr^y his dysciples
and subgettys in showing to them ensaumples of good virtues and good manners /
After he was chosen to be archebysshop of bourges / and how well it was against
his will he acceptyd it / nevertheless when he had accepted and taken hit / yet
therefore changed he not the habyte of the order which he had tofore taken ne
the obseruaunce also / and how well that he had metes delycious enough as to
such a prelate ben ordained and arrayed / Nevertheless he left not the
sobrenes that he had mayntenyd tofore in humylite in holy medytacion / and in
devout prayers / in which gladly alweye he ocupyed his time / And he was
much besy for the health of the sowles that were commysed to him and charged
to keep / gladly and dyligently he herd their confessyons be norisshed them
swetely / Often and dyligently he preached to them or did do preche / he
deserved so much grace of our lord / that by his devout prayers and merytes
in his living life god showed many miracles / On a day it happed that a priest
named gerald had lost the health of one of his hands that he might sing no
mass / which came to saint wyllyam and saint wyllyam bad him that he should
confess him / and without doubt he should be hool / and so he did / and at
the end of three days he sange mass hool and sound / Another time there was a
young child that had his brain sore troubled in such wise that his eyes
turned in his heed / his friends brought him tofore this holy man / on whom he
had great pity and began humbly to handle him and laid his hand on his heed /
and anon the pain cessyd and he was anon all hool / he was alwey glad and
joyous and that displesyd much to sum that were of hard and rude living /
Above al things the sin of detraccion dysplesyd him much / and louyd no
detractours / and to his power with great dylygence he made hem teschewe this
sin / and where they would not he withdrewe him fro their company / Fynably
he took the cross for to goo over see against heretykes and hethen men / and
as he made his purueau^ce for to make the said vyage he rendrid and yaue up his
soul to almighty god the fyfthe ydus of the monthe of Ianyuer / and was buried
in the church of burges / the which anon after began to do miracles / when
the Pope honoryus the third herd his life and how god showed miracles for him
After that he by great dyligence had made Inquysycyon he canonysed him to the
honor and praysyng of god which by the prayers of the said saint wyllyam
bring us to his everlasting bliss in heaven amen /

Thus ends the life of saint wyllyam
Here begins the life of Saint Eutrope
Saint Eutrope was borne and came of the most excellent lignage of all the
world and was borne in the royame of Perse and was sone of the admyralle of
babylone which was named ex^^^^s whom the said exerses engendryd on a queen
which was called guy^e and saint eutrope was endoctryned in his yongthe in
letters of caldee and of greece so ferforth that he was comp^ryd to the most
gretest clerk of the royame / After he went to galylee in to the court of
king herodes for to see sum curyosyte or sum nouelte of the barbaryens that
were with the king herodes / when he had dwelled there certain days in the
court / he herd the fame and renommee of the miracles of our lord Ihesu
christ / and began to inquire and search so much that he herd say that our
lord would goo over the sea of galylee / and he put him self in the multitude of
people that folowyd him / It happed that this day our lord by his Infenyte
largess refresshed and fed five thousand men with five loves of barley bread
and two fysshes in the presence of Sayn^ eutrope / When saint eutrope had seen
this miracle / and herd say of his other miracles / fro than forthon he began
to believe a little in him / but he durst not for his pedagoge or his governor
which was with him / For the admyralle his fader had co^mysed him in his guard
/ when he had fed him with the other / he went to Iherusalem in to the
temple / for to pray and adoure his creator in his law / and after this
went home to his fader / and told him all that he had seen in the contre fro
whens he came / I have seen a man said he that is called christ / but in all the
world is not his pareyll ne like / For he reyseth deed men / he heleth the
lazers / he makes blind men to see / the deef to here / the lame to goo right
/ and heleth al manner sekenesses and yet more tofore me he has fed with five
loves of barley and ij fysshes five thousand men /

Wherefore if it plesyd him that has made heaven and earth to send him in to
this contreye / I should be glad and joyous / if it plesyd you to do him
honor and reverence / when thadmyral herd the words of the child / he
went thynkyng how he myt see him A little while after the child that had great
desire to see yet Ihesu christ took leave of his fader / which he gate with
great pain / and came sithe with great company for to worship and adoure in
the temple / where he saw on a day how the children of Iherusalem came with a
great company of people tofore our lord Ihesu christ unto bethanye making to
him great reverence / and took the bows of palm and of olyues / and of other
trees and many other flowers / which they threw in the way where he should
pass / and songen with hye voys osanna / Then saint eutrope him self began
to cast flowers in the way / but he was much angry by cause he might not see
Ihesu christ for the multitude of the people that was there / and after that is
contained in the gospel he was in the company of them that were come for to
adoure and worship in Iherusalem at the feste that was there / which said to
saint phelyppe / Sir we would see Ihesu christ / Then Saint phelyp accompanied
with saint Andrewe told it to Ihesu christ / And anon after saint eutrope and
his company saw him syttyng upon an ass / whereof he was right glad / and fro
than forthon he byleuyd secretly / and accompanied with him / but he doubted
his felawshyp / for as much as his fader had commanded them to keep him well /
and that they should bring him ageyn with them / Then he herd say that the
Jews should shortly bring Ihesu christ to death / and by cause he would not
see so great cruelte do on to so true and Just a man / he departed on the
morn and went in to his country / and recounted all that he had seen of our
lord / a little while after he returned and herd say how he was put to death
wherefore he was sorry / For he louyd him much / But when he herd say that he
was risen fro death to life / and ascendyd in to heaven he was much joyous / and
returned in to babylonye fulfilled with the holy ghoost And all the Jews that
he fond in his contreye for anger he destroyed / by cause the^ of Jerusalem
had put our lord to death / After this a certain time when thappostles were
departed thorugh the world / two shynyng candelstykes of gold were sent in to
perse which were of very faith / that is to say Simon and Thadeus the
appostles of god / And entryd in to babylone / and had chaced out of the
country two enchauntours zaroen and arphaxat / which had perverted the people by
false and deceyu^ble spekyng / and in this cite these two appostles began to
sow the word of god / and to do many miracles / and hele seek people of diverse
maladyes / When this holy young man knew of their coming he was right glad /
and admonestyd his fader to leave his errors and his ydollys / and that he
should receive the christian feyth to the end that he might get thereby heaven / And
what by the predycacion of the appostles and by the counceyl and exortyng of
his sone / his fader and many other were converted and regenerate in the holy
font of baptesme by the hands of the appostles / and after all the cite was
converted to the feythe / and did do make a much notable church there / and
ordained there a prelate an holy man and true whom they had brought with
them fro Jerusalem named abdyas endoctryned in the doctrine of the gospellys /
and they ordained saint eutrope archedeken / and when they had al thus ordained
/ they departed and went in to other cytees for to preche the feythe of god /
And anon after they received the palm of marterdom / After Saint eutrope
wrote their passion in lettres of caldee and of greek / a little while after
saint eutrope herd speak of the miracles that saint Peter prince of the
appostles did / which that time was pope of rome / he took leave of the bishop
pryuelye without wetyng of his fader and came to rome / When saint peter saw
him he received him much agreably and endoctryned and taught him the law of
god much dylygently / when he had dwelled with saint peter a long while by
the ordenaunce and commandment of saint peter he went in to france with
many other for to preche the christian feythe / and thus as he entryd in to the
cite of xayntes he went thorugh the streets and places prechyng the feythe of
christ / anon as they of the cite saw him / they knew well that he was a
barbaryen by his speech / And when they herd him preche things that they
never herd tofore / they burnt him with brennyng fagottes and beat him with
poles vylaynsly / and when they had so vylaynsly beten him they put him out of
the cite / but the glorious friend of god bare full pacyently this persecucyon /
and made in a mountayn right nyghe the cite a little lodge of bows / wherein he
dwelled a great while / and by day time he came and preached in the cite / and
at night he returned unto his little lodge / where he abode in fastings and
prayers and in orysons / Then when he had been long there and had converted
but few of the people / he went ageyn to saint peter to rome / and when he
came thither / he fond that he had suffered passion on the cross / and fond
there Saint clemente in his stead / which commanded and counceylled him to
return in to the said cite of xaintes / and that in prechyng the
commandments of god benygnely he should abide the palm of vyctorye for the
love of our lord / that is to wete passion and marterdom / Then saint
clemente ordained him a bishop / and also saint denis which was come out of
greece to rome and many other brethern / which saint clemente sent in to
france / and thus departed they fro Rome / and arrived in the cite of ancerre
/ and there in great love they kyssed and enbraced each other in taking leave
for to depart one fro another and tenderly wept / Saint denis and his felawes
came to paris / and saint eutrope went to xaintes strongely confermyd and
f^rme in the love of god all pressed and ready to suffer all torments / and
much constauntely preached the feyth in such wise that many were haptysed /
Emonge whom the daughter of the king of the said cite which was named
euscelle was baptized / when her fader knew hit he had thereof so great
Indygnacion / that he put her out of the cite / and anon as she was out for
the love of god / she went strayte unto the lodge of the holy man and abode
there / Alwey the fader for love that he had to his daughter / was sorry that he
had put her out / and sent oftymes to her messagers for to come ageyn home to
him /

To whom she answered that she had lever for the feythe of Ihesu crist dwell
out of the cite / then to return in ageyn to sacrefyse the ydollys / For
which answer the fader was so angry and wroth that he wist not what to do and
did do assemble all the bouchers of the town / and gafe to them an hundred
and fyfty shyllynges for to put to death saint eutrope / and that they should
bring ageyn his daughter to his hows /

Then the day tofore the kalendys of may they assemblyd with them many
sarasyns and came to the lodge of saint Eutrope / and first they stonyd him and
after they beat this holy man with staves and scourges leded all nakyd and
after they cleuyd his heed with a bochers axe / and sawyd him with a saw / The
maid with moo other buried him by night in his teguryon or lodge / and kept
him in vygylles with lyghtes and in deuyne obsequyes as long as she lived / A
little while ater she departed out of this world right holyly and was buried
beside her master / as she had required by her life / After this a certain
space of time they of xaintes edefyed over this holy corpse a much notable
church / In which all seck folk of diverse maladyes and sekenesses have been
helyd / and yet daily been / And also many prysonners ben also by the prayer of
this holy saint delyuerd of their yrons / as guyues boltes and other which ben
hanged in the said church / in remembrance that they have been losed and
vnbounden by the prayers of Saint eutrope / Saint denis wrote the passion and
marterdom of saint eutrope in greek / and sent it in to greece to his friends
that byleuyd tho in god by the hands of saint clemente that tho was pope of
Rome / in exaltyng and glorefyeng the name of god which without end regneth
and shall regne amen /

Thus ends the life of saint Eutrope
And begins of saint Marcial
IN the time that our lord Ihesu christ preached in Iurye in the lygnage of
beniamyn / much people came to him for to have that was necessary to them as
well of drink as of mete / and in especyall for to here and understand such
thing as touched the sauacyon of the soul / On a day in the mids of all the
company came a man that was of the said lygnage of beniamyn the most noble of
all the Jews named by his right name marcial / and his wife was called
elysabeth which had between them both a child of the eage of xv year / that
was named also marciall when they herd our lord Ihesu christ preche / which
said in his predycacion Do ye penance / the royame of heaven is nyghe to them
that do penance / And who that is not regenerate in water by the sacrament
of baptesme he may not enter in to the royame of heaven / Then by the
commandment of our lord Ihesu christ / Marcyal / his wife / and their sone
marcial which was a child replenysshed in holy doctrine were baptized of
Saint Peter / Then Zaches and Joseph the which buried our lord were baptized
also and many other of the people of the Jews which were over long to tell
here all their names / when all this was accomplysshed / and that eueriche
turned homeward to his hows / The child marcyal returned not with his fader
and mother / but gafe him self all over unto our lord Ihesu christ / and put him
in the company as one of his dysciples / and held him a weye by Saint Peter /
which was right nygh of his kynne / and fro than forthon he was so ensumyned
and endoctryned of our lord and of Saint Peter that he no thing desired so
much as for to accomplysshe commandments solytayrs / After this saint peter
came to rome and prayed to marcyal that he would goo with him / and thus as they
had been to gyder endoctryned with one holy doctrine / and of one merytorye
dyleccion / In like wise that to gyder they receive the common reward of the
joy perdurable / and thus as they went / they were accompanied of sum
dysciples of antyoche / emo^ge whom were alphynyen / and austridynyen and many
other / when they were entryd within Rome / they were received of a man named
marcelle at that time consul of the Romans / Thus as they dwelled there god
apperyd to saint peter / and commanded him that he should send saint marciall
in to the prouynces of gaul for to preche the feythe and the believe to the
people which were in the bonds of the devil of hell / Then Saint Peter
called to him sa^nt marcial / and told him all by order that our lord had
said and commanded him / when saint marcyal herd that he began strongely to
weep by cause he doubted the far regyon and the people which had no knowleche
of god / when Saint Peter saw him / thus weep / he began much swetely to
comfort him in saying to him / my holy brother be not heavy ne sorouful / for
god shall be alweye with the / like as he has promised to us saying / loo I am
alwey and shall be with you unto the consummacion of the world / Thus my sweet
brother he commanded us after his resurrexyon saying / Goo ye unto and thorugh
the universal world and preche the gospel to all creatures / that who shall
believe and shall be baptized / he shall be saved / and they that will not so do
shall be dampened / which things my blessed brother behooves us to keep and put
in effect / to the end that we forgete not the commandments of god / anon
after these blessed words / saint marcial took leave of saint peter / and
brought with him the two dysciples aforsayd / that is to wete alphynyen and
austrudynyen and departed like as god had commanded to saint peter / Thus
then as they went / and that they were weary and sore traueylled by the way
which was long and grievous saint austrudynyen departed out of this world and
deyed / when saint marcial saw that he was deed / he returned in great haste
to rome and told to saint peter that which was byfalle in their weye / When
Saint Peter had herd him he said return as hastily as thou may and take my
burdon in thy hand and thou shall come where thou have left thy brother /
touch his body with this burdon / and anon he shall arise and goo in thy
company as he did tofore / When saint marcial came ageyn to the corpse he
touched it with the burdon like as saint Peter bad him / And anon he was
raised fro death to life / After when saint marcial had iourneyed long by diverse
contreyes in long prechyng and sowyng the word of god / they came in to guyan
unto a castle called tulle / and there were received of a rich and a mighty
man named arnold / which had a daughter that daily was tormentyd with the
enemy / Thus as saint marcyall entryd in to the hows / The fend began to cry
saying I know well now that I must issue out of the body of this maid / For
the angels of paradyse that been with the marcyal tormente me right grievously
/ but I pray the by the name of him that was cruc^fyed whom thou prechest of
that thou send me not in to thabisme of hell / Then saint marcyal said to
him I conjure the in the name of Ihesu christ that was crucefyed for us that
thou issue out of the body of this maid / and never return ageyn / but that
thou goo unto a place deserte where bird ne foul ne person dwellyth / with
this commandment the maid cast out the enemy and she fyl down as deed /
Then saint marcyal took her by the hand and raised her up and delyuerd her
to her fader hool and saufe / Holiness and benygnyte with all humylite shoon in
saint marcial / and was alweye in prayers / Another miracle also our lord
showed by the prayere of saint marcial in the same place / The prince of the
said castle which was called nerua / and was cosyn to the emperor nero / had
a daughter which was suffocate and murdered by the fend and was deed / Then
the fader and mother of the child that were much sorouful and heavy with a
great part of the people brought the body of the child tofore saint marcial
tenderly weeping and saying to him / O man of god help us at this time / thou
see how it is with us / when saint marcyal saw the lamentacyon and the
sorrow that they maad / he had pity on them / and said with an high (...) I
pray you al as well christian as paynyms / that ye will deuoutelye pray god
almighty / that by his benygne grace hit please him to give ageyn the life to
this child / The two dysciples of saint marcial and a few of christian people
that were there put them to prayers / and sith saint marcial himself made his
prayer saying / Sire I pray the in the name of thy blessed dear sone / and of
thy good friend sanyt peter / by thordenaunce and commandment of whom I am
comen hither / That it please the to reyse this child here to the end / that
when he shall be raised many may believe in thyn holy and precious name / Then
saint marcial trustyng in the help of god took the child by the hand saying
to him / In the name of our lord Ihesu christ / That of the Jews for us was
crucyfyed and the third day rose fro death to life / arise up and stand right on
thy feet / Anon the child aroos rizt upon his feet / and sith kneled down to
the feet of the holy man saying to him / O man of god I require the to baptyse
me to the end that I may be saved and mark me with the sign of the holy cross
/ for other wise may non be sawed / but if he be baptized / anon saint macial
baptized him / And with him in the same place were well crstyned also as well men
as wymen three thousand and vjC And after this saint marcyal went and destroyed
the ydolles and brought them to naught / For thens went saint marcial and his
two disciples and departed and came to lymoges where they were benyngly received
of a matrone that was named susanne / In whose presence saint marcial heled one
that was frenatyke / when the good woman susanne saw the miracle that so was
made in her presence / anon she and her meyne were baptized / After this saint
marcyal went in to the temple where the prestes of the ydoles were / The
which beat him grievously / and sith put him in prison On the morn as he made
his prayer / there descended a light so great upon him that men might not
behold him / The chains of iron to breast and the doors of the prison opend /
the kepers and they that were there required to be baptized / and the prestes
that had so beten him were smeton to death by thondre and lyghtnyng / Then the
other that were there came to saint marcyal in to the prison / and prayed him
that he would reyse them that so were smeton to death by the thondre / promisyng
to him that if he so did they al would be baptized / Then our lord by his
prayer raised them ageyn fro death to life / Then that same time were turned to
christian faith and baptized xijMl creatures as men and wymen / And after this on
a time deyde the holy woman susanne and tofore her death she recomanded to saint
marcyal her daughter that was called valeriene / which had promised and auowed
to our lord chastity as long as she lived / after when the holy maid knew
that there should come to lymoges a lord named steuyn which was lord of all the
prouynce fro the river of rosne unto the sea / She was sore aferd lest he would
do to her any gryef or noyance against her auowe / And gaf away al her richesses
to pour folk for the love of god / when the said steven was come to limoges he
made to do come tofore him the holy maid to the end to have his will of her /
but when she was come / and saw that she would not consent to do his will
anon he made her heed to be smyten of Than the squire that byheded her herd
thangels sing that bare the soul of the holy vyrgyne in to heaven with much
great Joy and sollempnyte / anon he returned unto his maystre / and told him
all that he had seen and herd and sithe fyl down deed at his feet / Then the
duc and al his company had much great dread / and the duc him self clad him
next his flessh in a sharp heyr and hard for great repentance / and praid
saint marcyal that he would pray god that hit might plese him to reyse his
squire fro death to life / and he would believe in the faith of Ihesu criste and be
crystyned / anon after that saint marcyal had prayed our lord raised thesquyer
/ Then the duc and well a xvMl persons in his company were baptized / In
this time the same duc by the commandment of the emperor Nero went in to
Italye with a great company of men of arms / when he had acomplysshyd the
commandment of nero / they went to rome for to see saint peter / whom they
fond prechyng to the people / which people were barefote and had clothed them
with the heyr lyeng on the ground tofore saint peter in demaundyng him pardon
of their sins / when Saint peter saw the duc and so much fair people in
his company / he demanded them what they were and of what contre Then the
duc told him by order how he and his company had been converted and baptized
of saint marcyal / After when they were departed from rome / they thought that
they would goo see saint marcial tofore or they returned in to their country /
Thus then as they were lodged nyghe by a river and the sone of the earl of
poytiers bayned him in the said river / thenemye the devil drowned and smored
him to the death / when his fader knew it he went weeping tenderly to Saint
marcyal / and prayed him to reyse his sone fro death to life / Then Saint
marcyal went to the place where he was drowned / and commanded to the fend
to bring the body out of the water / and that he should appear in a lykenes
vysyble tofore them all / Anon issued out of the water three fendes like
ethyopyens more black than cooles / and had terryble feet and eyes / and great
heyr that couerd all the body / and cast out at their mowthes and
nosethrilles fire like sulphre and cried like ravens / when they had told to
saint marcyal the harms and euylles that they had done / He commanded them
that they should depart and goo in to places deserte / where as they might
never noye ne grieve person living / Saint marcial which had pity and
compassyon on them that wept for the deed child raised him fro death to life /
and then the child told tofore them all that were there / how the fend
had drowned and smoldred him / and how they would have bounden him with chains
of iron brennyng / but an aungel of heaven delyuerd him and showed him the fire
of purgatory / and fro thens led him to the yate of paradys and as the
fendes required to have him / a voys came fro heaven and commanded that he
should arise ageyn and that he should live yet xxvj year / when he had told all this / he gave him self al over to saint marcial / and fro than forthon lived
in great abstynence and holy life like as thaungel had taught him / Saint
marcyal did many miracles and virtues / There was in that time a woman that had
an husbond seek of the palseye / to which woman saint marcyal delyuerd his
burdon / with which she touched a little her husbond and Incontinent he was
hool / Another time the fire was so great in the cite of lourdews / that all
was on a flame / Saint marcial held up his burdon against the fire and anon
^it was quenchyd / Another time as he would have hallowed a church at lymoges /
the prince aforsayd conveyed and sommoned all the people pour and rich to come
to the dedycacion of this church / And when they were al assemblyd saint
marcial admonested and warned them to be in very chastyte / It happed emonge
them whiles the mass was on saying that there was a knight which he and his
wife were sore vexyd and troubled with fendes / and as they were brought tofore
saint marcyal / he demanded of the fendes why they vexed them so / and they
answered to him thou haste commanded them that the people should mayntene
chastity / and these two have all this night exposed them in lecherye and this
is the cause that wherefore we ben entryd in to them / saint marcyal at the
request of the prince and people heled them / This same year that is to say the
xl year after the passion of our lord Ihesu christ / the same our lord Ihesu
christ apperyd to him and showed how that hastily he should depart fro this
world and be with his other friends in the royame of heaven / Then he did do
assemble all the christian people that he had converted and to them made a much
sweet sermon in taking leave of them / Sone after he was seek of the fevers /
and then our lord apperyd to him with a great quantyte of aungellys which
with much joy and gladness bare the soul of saint marcyal in to heaven / vbi
est honor and gloria in secula seculoru^ amen / This Saint marcyal of whom we
speak here was the same child as so^me say / on whom our lord laid his hand
upon his heed / when the contencyon and stryffe was emonge the appostles which
of them should be grettest in the royame of heaven / and then our lord set
the child marcyal in the myddle of them layeng his hand upon his heed as said
is / and said to them y^ ye be not little and humble as this child is / ye shall
not enter in to heaven he that shall be leeste emonge you / he shall be grettest
in my royame / as the gospel makes more plain mencyon / the which glorious
saint / saint marcial let us pray unto that he procure unto our said lord
Ihesu christ that all we may have part with him in the joy and glory
perdurable amen /

Here ends the life of saint marcial one of the disciples of our lord Ihesu
christ
And follows the life of saint Geneuefe
THe noble saint Geneuefe was borne at nau^cerre beside paris in the time of
themperours honorius and theodosius the less / and was with her fader and

She shall be of so great merit against god / and of her good life and
conversation many shall take ensau^ple that they shall leave their sin / and
shall convert them to god and shall live religyously by which they shall have
pardon and joy perdurable / Then he said to geneuefe / my daughter tell to
me and be not asshamed / if ye will be sacred and live in vyrgynyte unto the
death as espouse of Ihesu christ / The maid answered holy fader ye demand
that I desire / there lacks no more but that by your prayers our lord will
accomplysshe my devotion / the holy man said / have ferme believe in god and
preue by werkys the good things that ye believe in your heart and say with
your mowthe / and our lord shall give you force and virtue / Saint Germayn held
his hand on her heed till he came unto the mynstre / there he gave to the people
the beneyson / Saint Germayn said to the fader and mother of the maid that they
should bring her ageyn on the morn to him / when she was brought ageyn on the
morn saint germayn saw in her a sign celestyal / I wot not what / and said
to her / god the saleweth Geneuefe / Daughter remembrest thou what thou
promysest to me yesterday of the vyrgynyte of thy body / holy fader said the
maid I remember well that by the help of god I desire and think to
accomplysshe my purpoos / Then the holy man looked on the ground and saw a
penny sygned with the cross which came by the grace and will of god / he took
hit up and gave hit her and said fair daughter take this and bear it in mind
of Ih^u christ your espouse and suffer not about you none other arayemente of
gold ne silver ne of precious stones / for if the beauty of this world
surmounte a little your thought / ye shall lose the goods of heaven / he
commounded her to god and prayed her that she would remember him in her orysons
and prayers / and recommaunded her to fader and mother The two holy bysshoppes
went from thens in to england / there were heretykes against the feythe /
which said that children borne of fader and mother baptized had no need to be
crystenyd which is not truth / for our lord Ihesu christ says clearly in the
gospel that none may enter in to the kingdom of heaven / if he be not regenerate
of water and of the holy ghost / That is to say regenerate by ye sacrament of
baptesme By this scripture and by semblable the holy prelates destroyed their
false creaunce and believe and by virtue also and by miracles / For in a
solempnyte of ester by many that were new baptized / in syngyng alleluya they
chaced and droof aweye their enemies of scotland / and strangers of other
places that were come for to grieve them / Hit happed on a day that Geronce the
mother of the holy maid Geneuefe went on an holy and festeful day toward the
mynstre / And her daughter went after saying that the feythe that she had
promised to Saint germayn she should keep by the help of god / and that she
would often goo to the mynstre to the end that she might deserve to be espouse
of Ihesu christ / and that she might be worthy of his love / the mother was
angry and smote her on the cheke /

God auengyd the child that the mother became blind / and that in xxj months
she saw not / when the mother had been long in this pain which much enoyed
her / She remembryd of the goodness that Saint germayn had said of her daughter
/ and called her and said my daughter goo to the pytte and fetch me water /
the maid went hastily / when she was at the pytte she began to weep by cause
her mother had lost her syghte for her sake / and took up water and bare it to
her mder / The mother stratched her hands to heaven and took the water with
great feythe and reverence / And maad her daughter to sign her with the sign
of the holy cross and wesshe her eyes / and anon she began for to see a
little /

When she had twyes or thrice wesshen her sight came hole to her ageyn as it
had been tofore / after this it happed that the holy maid was offered to the
bishop of chartres buylique for to be sacred with two other elder maidens /
For men offered hem after their eage But the holy bishop knew by the holy
ghoost that geneuefe was the most worthy and dygne and said to her that was
behind should come before / For god had tho sanctefyed her / After the death of
her fader and her mother the holy damoysel came and dwelled at paris for to
assaye and prove her there / and for to avail the more she was seek of the
palsye so much that it semyd that her membris were dysioyned and departed that
one fro that other / whereof she was so sore tormentyd that during three days
she was kept as for deed / for there apperyd on her no sign of life / sauf
that her Iowes were a little reed / In this space and time as she confessyd
after an aungel led her in spyryte where as the rest was of good folk and
where the tormente was of evil people afterward she showed to many the secrets
of their consciences as she that was taught and enseygned of the holy ghoost /
The second time saint germayn returned fro england and came to paris / The
people almost al went against him with great joy / and tofore al other things
saint germayn demanded how genouefe did / but the people which more is
Inclyned to say evil of good people then well / answered that of her was no
thing in blamyng her / which was to her a praysyng of other mennys preysyng
is none the better / ne of others blamyng is none the werse / therefore the holy
man set naught of their ianglyng / but as soon as he entryd in to the cite he
went strayte to the hows of the holy vyrgyn whom be salewed in so great
humylite / that al they meruaylled / and showed to them that dyspraysyd her the
ground wete of her teerys / and recyted to them the beginning of her life / and
how he fond at nancerre that she was chosen of god / and recommendyd her to
the people / Tidings came to paris that aceylle the felon king of hougrye had
enterprysed to destroy and waste the parties of france and to subdue them to
his domynacion / The bourgeyses of paris for great dread that they had sent
their goods in to other cytees more sure / Saint geneuefe warned and
admonested the good wymmen of the town that they should wake in saftynges and in
orysons by which they might assuage the ire of our lord and eschew the
tyranny of their enemies like as did sometime the two holy wymmen Iudyth and
bester / They obeyed her and were long and many days in the church in
wakynges fastings and in orysons / She said to the bourgeyses that they should
not remeue their goods ne send them out of the town of paris / for the other
cytees that they supposed should be more sure should be destroyed and wasted /
but by the grace of god paris should have none harm / and sum had Indygnacion
at her / and said that a false prophet was risen and apperyd in their time /
and began emonge them to ask and trete whether they should drown her or stone
her / whiles they were thus tretyng as god would came to paris after the decees
of saint germayn tharchedeken of ancerre / and when he understood that they
tretyd to gyder of her death he came to them and said fair syrres for gods
sake do not this myschyef / For she of whom ye trete saint germayn witnesses
that she was chosen of god in her moders belly / And loo here been the letters
that he has sent to her in which he reco^mendeth him to her prayers / When
the bourgeyses herd these words recyted by him of saint germayn and saw the
letters / they meruaylled and fer^d god and left their evil counceyl / and did
no more thereto / Thus our lord kept her fro harm / which keeps all weye them
that be his / and deffe^deth after that thappostle says / and for her love did
so much that the tyrauntes approchyd not paris / Thank and glory to god and
honor to the vyrgyne / This holy maid did great penance in tormentyng her
body al her life and became been for to give good exaumple / For sith she was of
ye age ^f xv year unto fyfty she fastyd eu^^y day sauf sunday and thursday / In
her refection she had no thing but barley bread and sometime venes / the which
soden af^^r xiiij days or three wekys she ete for all delyces / always she was
in prayers / in wakynges and in penaunces she drank never wine ne other lycour
that might make her drunk in all her life / when she had lived and vsyd this life
fyfty year / the bysshoppes that were that time saw and beheld that she was
over feeble by abstynence as for age warned her tencrece a little her fare / The
holy woman durst not gaynsaye them / For our lord says of the prelates / who
hereth you hereth me / and who despyseth you dyspyseth me / and so she began
by obedyence to ete with her bread fysshe and milk / and how well that she so
did / she beheld the heaven and wept whereof it is to believe that she saw
appertly our lord Ihesu christ / after the promise of the gospel that says /
that blessed be they that be clean of heart / for they shall see god / she had
her heart and body pure and clean / There ben twelve virtues vyrgynal says
hermes pastor with out which no vyrgyne may be agreeable to god / that is to
wete feythe / abstynence / pacyence / magnanymyte / symplesse / Innocence /
concord / charity / dysciplyne / chastyte / truth / and prudence / Thise
virtues accomplysshed the holy vyrgyne by work / she taught and enseygned by
word / and showed often by ensaumple Often and tofore all other holy places she
vysyted the place where as restyd saint denis and his felawes / and had great
devotion to edefye upon the said holy bodies a church / but she had not whereof
/ On a time came to her the preestys / as often they had done tofore to whom
she said reuerente faders in god I pray and require that each of you do his
power and his deuoyr to assemble matere whereof might be made and edefyed a
church in the honor of the glorious marters saint Denis and his felawes /
for the place where they rest out much to be worshypp^d and doubted / which
first taught to ou^ ^^ncestres the feythe / Dame (...) the preestys / we would
feign and have great will thereto / but we can get no chalk ne lyme / Then
said the holy vyrgyn with a glad chere in prophecyeng as she that was
replenysshed with the holy ghoost / Goo ye I pray you to paris upon the great
bridge / and bring that ye shall find there / they went thither and abode
there a while meruaylled and abashed / And anon came by them two swyne herdes
spekyng to gyder / of which that one said as I went yesterday after one of my
sowes I fond a fourneil of lyme meruelously great / That other answered and I
fond in the wood under the rote of a tree that the wind had thrown down a
fournel of lyme of which I trow was never none taken aweye / When the
preestys herd this they had great admyracion and blessed our lord that had
given such grace to geneuefe his handmayde / They demanded where the fournels
were and after returned and told to the vyrgyne what they had founden / She
began to weep for joy / and as soon as the preestys were gone and departed she
satte on her knets and was all the night in orysons and in teerys in requyryng
help of god to perform this work / and on the morn erlye all mate and
trauaylled of wakyng she went to genese a good priest / and prayed him that he
would do his pain and labor that the church might be edefyed / and told him
tidings of the lyme / when genese herd this / he was all ameruaylled and fyl
down to her feet / and promised to her that night and day he would do his
labor to accomplysshe her commandment / By the help of god and of saint
Geneuefe and of the people of paris the said church was begone in the honor
of the blessed marters Saint denis / Saint Rustyque / and saint Eleuthere which
now is called saint denis de lestree / There ben yet the holy bodies where our
lord shows fair miracles / For as the werkemen entendyd to make the edefyce
each after his craft / It happed that their drink failed and was done / And
genese the priest said to geneuefe which knew not hereof that she should talk
with the werkemen so long that he might goo to paris and fetch drink when
she herd this she demanded for the vessel that they had empted / and it was
brought to her / she maad them to depart fro her / Then she knelyd down on
her knees and prayed god with warm teerys to help her / and when she felt
that our lord had herd her prayer / She aroos up and maad the sign of the
cross upon the said vessel and a meruayllous thing happed / For the vessel
was full / the werkmen drank her belly full and as often as they would unto the
time that ye church was par^ytely made / whereof they thanked our lord / The
holy vyrgyne had devotion to wake the night that our lord rose fro death to life
after the custom and statutes of ancient faders / It happed on a time that
she put her on the way tofore day to goo to the said church of saint deny /
and made to bear a candyl brennyng tofore her / The night was derke the wind
great and it rayned fast / which quenched the light of the candel / The
maidens that were in her company were sore troubled / She asked after the
candell and as soon as she had hit in her hand hit was lyghted by gods will
ageyn and so she bare it brennyng unto the church / Another time when she had
endyd her prayer a candel that she held / light in her hand by the grace of
god / Semblably in her celle on a time was a candel light in her hand without
any fire of this world / of which candel many seek folk by their feyth and
reverence have been helyd / That tapre is kept yet at nostre dame de paris / A
woman which by the temptacyon of the devil which to his power alwey de^eyueth
the good / stale aweye her shoes / but as soon as she was at home / she lost
her sight / when she saw that our lord had auengyd the wrong that she had
done to the vyrgyne / She did her to be led to her with the theft / when she
came tofore the holy vyrgyn / she fyl down to her feet and required her of
foryeuenes and restoryng of her sight / Geneuefe that was right debonair took
her up fro the ground and in smylyng gave to her the sight ageyn of her eyes /
The holy vyrgyn on a time went to laon / and the people of the town went out
ageynste her / Emonge whom were the fader and mother of a maid that had been ix
year so paralatyke / that none might show the ioynture of her membrys / They
besought and re^uyred saint geneuefe that she would vysyte the seek maid She
went and saw her / and sithe made her prayer as she was acustomed and after
handled the membrys of the maid / and commanded her to do on her clothes and
hosen and shoes / Incontynente she aroos in good health in such wise that she
went unto the church with the people / The folk that saw this / blessed our
lord that had given such grace to his damoysel geneuefe / and when she
returned they conveyed her syngyng with great joy The king of france
chyldryke how be it he was a paynym h^lde her in great reverence / so did also
the barons of france for the fair miracles that she did in the name of our
lord Ihesu christ / whereof it happed on a time that the said king held
certain prysonners Iuged to death / but by cause geneuefe should not demand
them / he issued out of paris and made to shytte the yates after him / the holy
virgyn knew hit anon and went hastily after him for to help to deliver
them As soon as she came to the yates they opened without keye seeing all the
people which thought it a great wonder / She pursewed the king and obtained
grace for the prysonners /

In the parties of the oryent bey^nde Antyoche was a good man named Symeon
which had despised this world and was of meruaylus holy life which demanded
of saint geneuefe of the merchants that went in to tho patryes / And by them
he salewyd her much honorably / And recommaunded him unto her prayers / hit
was a great marvel that the holy man which had never seen ne herd speak of
her did do great her by her name / verayly the friends of god that know his
will and do thereafter have tidings that one fro that other by admynystracion
of the holy ghoost / they shall never be separate ne departed / as Saint ambrose
being at melan knew of the death of saint martyn at tours / At meaux was a
noble damoysel which was a med by her propre name celyne / which when she had
herd of the grace that god had given to saint genouefe / she required her to
change her habyte a young man had fyau^ced and trouthed her / which had great
Indygnacion wha^ he herd of those tidings and came to meaux in a great Ire
where the ij vyrgyns dwelled / and when they knew of his coming they fled
unto ye church there happed a fair miracle / For as they came to the church
door which was locked and fast shette / the door that was so locked opened by
his gree by him self / thus saint geneuefe delyuerd saint celyne fro peril and
fro the contagyon of the world / the which perseuerid in abstynence and in
chastyte to her end In this time the said celyne offered to saint geneuefe one
her chamberer which had leyen seek ij year and might not goo / the holy
vyrgyne handled her membrys with her worthy hands / and anon she was hool and
in good point There were brought to her xij men that were wood and byset with
deuyls unto paris which were over hard bystad and tormented of thenemye / the
virgyn had great pity and went to prayer and orisons in requyryng our lord with
salt teris that by his grace and goodness he would deliver them of this
pestylence / and as she perseuerid in her prayers / they were hanged in the
air in such manner as they touched no thing / she aroos fro her prayer and
said that they should goo to saint denis / the wode men answered that they might
not but she vnbonde them / the virgyn which was for them in great sorrow
commanded them that they should goo / then anon they suffered them to be
led secretly / their hands bound behind their backs / she went after
them / and when she was in the church of saint denis she stratched her self on
the ground in orisons and in wepynges / Thus as she perseueryd in prayers and
wepynges the wode men cried with an high voys / that they approached whom the
vyrgyn called in to their help / none ought to doubt that the enemy that
saw that he must nedys issue and goo out signefyed by the mowthe of the
demonyaks that the appostles marters and other saints that the holy virgyn
called came unto her help by the yefte of god which is ready to do the will of
them that dread him and call him in truth / when the holy vyrgyn herd this
that they said / She aroos up and blessed each after other with the sign of
the cross / and anon they were delyuerd of the enemies / They that were
present felt so great stenche that they doubted no thing but tho sowles
were delyuerd fro the vexacion of the devil and blessed our lord for this
miracle / There was at bourges a damoysel which herd speak of the great
renomee of this holy saint / came to paris for to speak to her / she had been
sacred / but after the consecracion she had lost her vyrgynyte / the holy
genouefe demanded of her if she was a vyrgyn nonne or wife or a wydowe / She
answered that she was a vyrgyn sacred / Geneuefe said nay / tellyng to her the
place and time of her defloracion and the man that had done the feyte / When
she saw that it was for naught that she said she was a vyrgyne / her
conscience remorsed her and fyl down to her feet in requyryng pardon / In
semblable wise the holy genouefe dyscouerd to many the secrets of their
consciences which ben not here wryton by cause it were over noyous and long
to write / A woman whom the holy vyrgyn had helyd had a child of the age of
four year / which fyl in a pyt he was therein the space of three hours the
mother came and drew it out and bare it al deed unto the saint in rendyng her
heir and betyng her breast and pappes and weeping bytterly / and laid the
child deed at her feet The holy vyrgyn couerd hit with her mantel / and after
she fyl down in her prayers and wept / and anon after when she cesyd of her
weeping our lord showed a fair miracle / for the child that was deed reuyued /
the which was baptized at ester after / and was named celonyer / by cause she
was raised in the celle of saint Genouefe / There came fro meaux a man to this
holy vyrgyne which had his hand dried unto the wreste / and she handled his
joints and fyngres and maad thereon the sign of the cross / and anon the
hand became all hool / Geneuefe that knew well that our lord Ihesu christ was
baptized the day of epyphanye / and after went in to deserte in gyuyng
enseygnement to them that been regenerate in the sacrament of baptesme / to
fast wake and adoure besely and to accomplysshe by work the grace that they
have taken in the baptesme by the ensaumple of sweet Ihesu christ / Then
entryd the holy vyrgyn in to her celle the sunday tofore the said feste / and
abode there as recluse unto the thursday absolute in wakyng in prayers in
fastings and orysons / Thither came a woman to see her more for curyosyte than
for good feythe / And therefore god punysshed her / Far as soon as she approached
the door of the celle / she lost her sight and became blind / But the holy
maid by her debonayrte and by her prayer gate her sight ageyn and by the sign
of the holy cross when she issued out of her celle in the end of lent / In
the time that the cite of paris was assyegyd by the term of ten year like as
thauncyent hystoryes reherce that there followed so great famyne and hungre that
many deyed for hungre / The holy vyrgyne that pity constrained her went to the
said for to goo fetch at name sum vytaylles / when she came unto a place of
said where as of custom ships were wont to perysshe / She made the ship
to be drawn to the ryuage and commanded to cut down a tree that was in the
water / and she set her to prayer / Then as the ships should have smyton
upon the tree / hit fyl down And two wild heedys graye and horrible issued
therout which stanke so sore that the people there were enuenymed by the space
of two hours / and never after perysshed ship there thank be to god and to
his holy saint / Unto arcy the castle went this holy vyrgyne / and there came
ageyn her a great lord which required her that she would vysyte his wife which
had had long time the palseye / The holy vyrgyn went and uysyted her which
had been long seek with prayers and orysons / and after blessed her with the
sign of the cross and commanded her that she should arise / She then that
had been four year seek and might not help her self aroos seeing all the people
which thanked our lord / Fro arcy she went to troyes in champayn / the people
came to mete with her and offered to her great multitude of seek people without
nombre / She blessed them and sygned them with the sign of the cross / and
Incontynente they were helyd in the sight of all the people which meruayled
much and rendryd thankynges to our lord / There was brought to her a man
which by the pugnycion of god was made blind by cause he wrought on the
sunday / and a blind maid also the holy vyrgyne blessed them in the name of
the fader and sone and of the holy ghoost / and anon their sight was restored
to them / There was a subdeken present and saw this / he went and fette a
child which had been seek x year of the febres right sore the holy vyrgyn did
do bring holy water and blessed it and gave him drink / and that done by the
grace of god the child was in good health / In this time many took of the
cuttynges of her vesture by devotion whereof many seek were helyd / and many
vexyd by spyrytes were delyuerd and remysed in to their good mind / Fro arcy
returned the holy vyrgyne to paris with xj ships charged with vytayl / wind
tempeste and orage assailed them so strongely that they wend to have
perysshed without remedy / the holy vyrgyn lift up her hands to heaven
requyryng help of our lord / and anon the tempeste cessed Then bessus a
priest that was present and saw it which tofore had tremblid for fere began
to sing for joy cantemus domino gloriose / All that there were thanked our
lord that had saved them by the prayer of the damoysel geneuefe / when the
goods came to paris that she had brought she departed them and gave for the
love of god / to sum pour / wulle / and to other hool loves of breed / and
sometime she so hasted for pity / that she took the loves hot out of the oven
secretly and gave it to the pour / The wymmen meruayled why she took their
loves but they spoke ne said no thing / And they much doubted that they should
not find their count ne tale / But notwythstondyng that she had so taken by
the grace of god they fond al their loves and lacked none / by the merytes of
the holy saint / her hope was no thing in worldly things but in heavenly / for
she byleuyd in the holy scripture that says who so yeueth to the pour /
leneth for a uayle / The reward which they receive that give to pour people /
the holy ghoost had she wyd to her long tofore / and therefore she cessyd not
to weep / to adoure / and to do werkys of pity / For she knew well that she
was none other in this world but a pilgrim passing / There was at meaux a
bourgeys that by the space of four year he might not here ne goo / he did him
be brought to the holy vyrgyn which dwelled at paris / and required her that
she would restore to him his health and heryng she touched his eerys and
blessed him and anon he was hole and went and herd as he did before thankyng
our lord / On a time the holy vyrgyne went to orlyaunce / a woman named
fraterne was in great sorrow for her daughter that lay deyeng / anon as she
wyste the coming of the holy virgyne she went to her to saint aiguen where she
fond her in prayer / fraterne fyl down to her feet saying / Dame geneuefe give
me ageyn clode my daughter / When geneuefe saw the good feythe of her she said
/ dyscomforte the no thing / thy daughter is in health / the which by the
meruayllous puyssaunce of god at the word of the holy vyrgyne was brought fro
the wycket of death and came al hool against her mother and met with her at
the portal of the hows / The people thankyd our lord for this fair miracle /
In the said cite there was o servant culpable against his master / the holy
maid prayed his master that he would foryeue him his trespaas / The master as
felonous and proud daygned not to do hit at her request / Then said the
holy vyrgyne / though ye despise me / our lord will not have me in despyte /
as soon as he was at home he was taken with an hot fear ague which vexyd him
in such wise that he myt not sleep of all the night On the morn he came to the
holy vyrgyne rennyng with open mowth like a bear of almayn the tongue hangyng
out and fomyng like a boor / requyryng pardon / which would give no pardon /
The saint had pity on him and blessed him / and the fyeure left him / thus
made she the master hool / and the servant excused / fro orlyounce the holy
woman went to tours by the water of loyre where she suffryd many perils /
when she areyued at tours / great foyson of demonyaks came against her out of
the church of saint martyn and the spyrytes cried by the mowthes of them that
were mad and vexyd which were burnt by the merytes of saint martyn and saint
geneuefe and the perils that the vyrgyn had in the water of loyre they had
done hit by envy / The holy vyrgyn went unto the church of saint martyn
where as she helyd money demonyaks by prayers and by the sign of the cross and
the demonyaks said at the hour of the tormente that the fyngres of the saint
burnt about them as tapres en flamed with fire of heaven / hereof herd three
men which kept their wives mad they went to the church and prayed her that
she would vysyte their wives The blossyd vyrgyne which was debonayr went and
vysyted them and delyuerd them fro thenemye by vnctyon of holy oil and by
prayer / Anon after it happed as she was in orysons in a corner in the church
of saint martyn that one of the syngars was so sore vexyd with the enemy that
he ete his membris / which went out of the chauncel and came strayte to the
holy vyrgyn / the blessed virgyn commanded the spirit to issue out / he
answered if he issued he would issue by the eye She commanded that he should no
lengyr abide ne dwell there / and then he issued out anon would he nolde he
by the flux of the womb and left foul enseygnes and tokenes / and the seek
man was at hool and in good mind whereof he thanked our lord /

They of tours honourid much this blessed vyrgyne / how well hit was against
her will / On a time as ^e was at her door she saw a maid pass by beryng a
buyret of oil / she called her and asked what she bare / She answered and said
oil which she had boughte / the holy maid which saw the enemy syt^e on the
mowthe of the buyrette / blewe on hit / and the buyrette brake / she blessed
the oil and bad the maid bear it forth saufly / the people that saw this had
great meruaylle that thenemye could not hyde him but that she perceived him /
and thankyd our lord / There was brought to her a child by his friends which
was dombe / blind and lame / the blessed vyrgyn enoynted him with the holy
oil / and the same our he saw clearly spoke and went and received health
entyerly / In the terroyr of meaux the holy maid did do labor a field ^^at
she had / and a storm and tempeste trou^^ed wind and rayn aroos which (...)
much the werkemen / She (...) stretchyng on the earth in orison (...) prayer /
and our lord showed (...) a fair miracle / for the rain fyl (...) all the corn
in the feldes theraboute and in her field fyl not one drope / Another time as
she was on the sayn there was a great tempeste / and she besoughte god of help
/ and anon it cessid in such wise that they that were present saw well that
our lord at her request and for her love made wind and ra^ne to cesse / all
seek men that she enoynted with holy oil deuoutelye were helyd and made hool /
hit happed so that on a time when she would have enoynted a demonyak she fond
no oil in her ampolle / when (...) was so sorry that she wyste not what to do /
For there was no bishop present for to bless h^t / She lay dou^ in orysons
and prayer besechyng god that he would deliver the man from the enemy / Our
lord showed there two fair virtues / for as soon as she aroos / her ample was
full of oil being in her hands / of which she enoynted the mad man and
anon was delyuerd of the wicked spyrite / which ample with the oil saw the
same man that wrote her life xviij year after her decesse / Many other miracles
without nombre showed our lord for the love of the holy and blessed saint /
saint Geneuefe / the which lived in this world full of virtues and miracles /
more than four score year / and departed out of this world and deyed worthily
the third day of Ianyuer / And was buried in the mount of paris called mount
par lover / and now is called the mount of saint geneuefe in the church of
saint Peter and Poule / the which as said is at the beginning the king bowys
sometime named cloius did do make by thenhortemente of this holy virgyn / for
the love of whom he gave grace to many prysonners al her departing / and after
there were many fair miracles which by negligence by envy and not retchyng
were not wryton / as he confessyd that put her life in latin / exepte two which
he set in the end of his book / as here follows / Unto the sepulcre of the
holy vyrgyn was brought a young man that was so seek of the stone that his
frendys had no hope of life / In great weeping and sorrow they brought him thither
requyryng aid of the holy vyrgyn / Anon after their prayer the stone issued
and was forthwith all hool as he had never been seek / Another man came thither
that gladly wrought on the sunday / Wherefore our lord punysshed him / for his
hands were so bynommen and lame that he might not work on other days / He
repentyd him and confessid his sin and came to the tomb of the said virgyne
and there honored and prayed deuoutelye / and on the morn he returned all
hool praysyng and thankyng our lord that by the worthy merits and prayers of
the holy virgyne grant and give us pardon grace and joy perdurable After the
death of the blessed virgyne saint geneuefe was assigned a lamp at her
sepulcre in which the oil fourded and sprange like water in a well or
fontayn / Three fair things showed our lord by this lamp / for the fire and
light brennyd contynuelly / The oil lassed not ne mynysshed / and the seek
people were heled there / Thus wrought our lord by the merits of the blessed
vyrgyne corporally / Which much more habundantly wyrcheth by her merytes to

for us wretchid synnars that we may so live and amend us in this present life
that we may come when we shall depart hens by her merits unto the life
perdurable in heaven amen /

Thus ends The life of saint Geneuefe
Here follows the life of saint Maturyne
SAint maturyn was borne of the dyosyse of sens / and his fader was called
maryn / which by the commandment of the emperor maxymyen persecuted much
strongely christian men / but his sone maturyne fro the time of his Infancye
priuyly in his heart / and in will was dysciple of Ihesu criste / and was much
sorrowful of the predycacion of his fader and mother / for as much as they were
paynyms and myscreauntes / wherefore he prayed many time our lord Ih^u christ
that by his benygne grace he would convert them / So it happed on a night as he
slepte / a wys said to him maturyn thy petycion is herd and granted who anon
aroos and gave and rendryd great thankynges to our lord / The mother of saint
maturyne being enspyred with the holy ghoost / came to him and said / O my sone
what reward and what merit shall we have if we believe in Ihesu christ / as by
many times thou have desired us / then saint maturyne said to her / Mother I
let you wit that after the general resurrexion body and soul shall have joy
without end / and that so much that heart humayn may not think / ne tongue
speak ne pronounce / anon then the mother of saint maturyn went to her
husbond his fader / for to tell to him what her sone had said / To whom the
fader said thus / I have this night seen in a vysyon / that our sone maturyne
was entryd in to a shepcote / and that there was delyuerd to him a great
multitude of shep / and then they both two received the holy sacrament of
baptesme / of an holy bishop named polycarpe / which ordained and made saint
maturyn priest when he was but xx year old / After that / that saint mauryce
and his fellows were marterd and that the people of the romans had suffryd many
dyuerce trybulacions / The emperor maxymyen had a daughter which had a wicked
spyryte in her body which tormentyd her much and persecuted for whom her
fader the emperor did do make many crafts of enchau^tementes for to guarisshe
and hele / but hit auayled no thing Then the fend that was within her cried
and said by the mowthe of the maid / O emperor it avails the nothing that
thou do / For I will not depart from hens / till thou have brout hither out
of france maturyn the se^uaunte of god / which by his prayers shall get
health to thy daughter / and unto the people / and anon the emperor with a great
multitude of people went to seche him / and brought him to rome upon this
condycion / that they should swear and promise that if it happed wat he deyed by
the way / they should bring or send him to the place to be buried where as
they had taken him / and when they came nyghe to rome / the people came against
him and received him much reverently / And anon as he was comen to rome he
helyd and delyuerd the daughter of the emperor fro the hands of the fend
Semblably all the other seek men that were presentyd to him he helyd them /
Nevertheless it happed so that the day of the kalendys of nouembre he rendrid
and gave up his soul to god much holyly / Then took they the precious body
and enoynted it with noble oynementes / and beryed it with much reverence /
and when they had leyed it in the earth / on the morn they came unto the
sepulture / and fond the holy body above the earth nyghe unto the same
sepulture / and then were they all abashed / and wyste not what to do / how
be it when one of the knights that had brought him out of ffraunce had
remembryd of the promise that they had made / anon he said to the people the
cause wherefore it was / And anon after by the commandment of the Emperor
the knights brought the body ageyn much solempnely in to his contreye in a
place / where our lord by the merytes of the holy body has showed many
miracles and virtues / Of which by the blessed prayers and his Intercessyons
we may have part Amen /

Thus ends the life of saint Maturyne
Here follows of Saint Uictor marter
SAint Uictor the glorious knight and marter in the time of anthonyn and
aurelyen emperors was presented as a christian man unto a duc called Sebasten /
which would have made saint victor do sacrefyse to thydolles / to whom saint
vyctor answered that he was a true knight to Ihesu christ / and that he would
not do sacrefise when the duc understood that / he commanded that his back
should be al to broken / and his synewys to be drawn out / and this holy man
gave great thankynges to god / for the torments that were done to him / and
also of that / that he abode alwey in very feythe / The duc was much moeuyd
and angry / and comman^ded that he should be put in a brennyng furneys / when
saint vyctor was therein he made his prayers unto our lord / and he was therein
three days hool without greuyng of any fire or flamme / or fume / and without
any do^mage and on the third day he was founden hool and sound / after the duc
did do take venym / and to make by an enchauntour mortal mete / and maad him to
ete it / which mete this holy man ete without any greuaunce or hurt / and yet
he did do make by the said enchau^tour / more strenger venym then he did
tofore / and gave it to saint vyctor / which ete hit without any hurt like as
he did that other / When the enchauntour saw that the venym might in no wise
grieve the holy man / he burnt all his books / and renounced al worldely
goods / and conuertyd him to the feythe of god / After all these things the
duc yet admonested saint victor that he should do sacrefyse to his gods /
Which thing saint vyctor refused as he did tofore / Then the duc commanded
that all the synewes of his body should be al drawn out / and after put him in
boyllyng oil / and after did do hang him by chains / and set unto his
sides pottes all brennyng / but nevertheless he was alweye in such wise
recomforted of our lord / that he felt no pain / Then the Judge was much
abashed / And commanded to take quycke lyme and vynagre medlyd to gyder / and
made it to auale in to his throat / and after did do put out his eyes / Then
saint victor said to him / spare me not / for I am al pressed and ready to suffer
all tormentys / And then the tyraunte commanded that his feet hynge upward
/ and so henge three days long in such wise / that the most party of the
blood of his body ran out at his nosethrilles And at the end of three days
the other knights came for to see if he were deed / and they that were blind
came and were nyghe him / by the prayers of this glorious saint / they were
enlumyned ageyn and had their sight The which knights when they were returned
to the duc / they told to him this adventure / how by the prayers of this holy
man they had received their sight / and that they left him a live and hool /
Then the duc commanded that he should be flayne / and in the mean while a wife
of a knight named corone cried with an high voys vyctor thou were borne in a
good time / and thy werkys ben blessed / for thacceptable sacrefyse of the
holiness of thy thought / the which our lord has received in gree / as he did
the sacrefyse of abel / when this woman which was but xvj year old had said
this and other good things and words she put more to and said / loo see ye
not thaungels of paradys that bring two crowns / of which thou shalt have
the gretter and I the less / and how well that I be a feeble vayssel /
nevertheless I have ferme hope in our lord Ihesu christ that he shall give to
me his heritage / and when the duc understood the words that she had said He
commanded that she should do sacrefyse to the gods / and she answered and
said I am named corone / and thou requyrest me to lose my corone / When the duc
had herd her answer / he commanded his knights / that by force they should
make two trees to enclyne and bow down / that one against that other / and
thereon they henge corone / and suddenly let the trees goo and so they did /
whom by the radour and force of the trees in spryngyng she rendryd her soul
to our lord in ferme feythe and affyaunce of the life eternal / And as the two
said trees adressyd / her glorious body abode in two pyeces on the ground /
After that the duc commanded that Saint vyctor should be byheded / who at the
smytyng of / of his heed bledde milk and blood to gyder / which miracle much
people saw / which then byleueden in our lord Ihesu christ / Qui cum patre
et spiritu sancto viuit and regnat deus / per omnia secula seculorum AMEN /

Thus ends the passion of saint Uyctor marter
Of Johan and Paul
COnstance the daughter of constantyn the emperor had ij prouostes that one was
named Ioh^n / And that other paul It happed in that time that gallycan which
was duc and conduytour of thoste of the romans should goo in battle against
the barbaryns / Which had taken dacye and the contray about and he demanded
that co^stance daughter of the emperor should be given to him in marriage for a
reward / The Emperor would well as for him / But he thought it might not be /
because constance after that saint agnes had heled her would never consent to be
married / for she had a vowed virginyte / wherefore she would rather suffer death
than enclyne thereto / but nevertheless the maid that trusted in god said to her
fader / that at his retornyng fro the battle / if he had victory might well be
spoken of ye marriage / and in hope thereof she desired to have ij daughters of
gallican for to dwell with her that by them she might know the better the
manners of their fader / and she delyuerd to him her ij pronostes John and poul
to go with him to batail / which was so don / then this duc went to batail
and was desco^fyted and fled in to a cite of tharse / and anon the barbaryns
assiged him / then said seint Ioh^n and saint poul make thyn avow to god of
heaven that thou shall never wedde wife and you shall veynquyssh thyn enemyees
better tha^ thou have / and then he did after their cou^seill / and on the
morn a yonglyng yt bare a cross on his sholder appeared to him and said / take
thy sword and com after me / when gallican the duc had taken his swerd / he
led him through al his enemies to the king / whom he slew / and all the host
was so aferde that they yielded them al to him / whom then he subdued and made
the^ subgettis and tributaries to rome / and when he went by his enemies ij
knights appeared and co^fermed him in the faith / and after he becam criste^
And returned again to rome / And was received with great honor And then he
prayed the Emperor to pardonne him of taking of his daughter / For he purposed
never to have wife / But keep him contynent and chaste / And that plesyd well to
the emperor Then were his two daughters also converted / and he left his
duchye / and gaf all to pour people / and him self served god and did after
many miracles / In so much that deuyls and wicked spirits went out of the
bodies of creatures by his simple regard and syghte / And hereof the renommee
and fame went fro the est unto the west / and the people came fro far for to
see this great man how he was changed / For he wesshe the feet of pour men /
and set them at table / and gaf them to ete / he served the seek men / and
did the office of seruytude much besily / It happed that when constantyn was
deed an Emperor sone of the great constantyn was emperor all of the herresie
of the Arryens and held thempyre / He had ij neuewes of whom that one was
called gallus and that other Iulyan / this gallus was so badde that he did do
sle him / Then Iulyan doubtyng and being afferde entrid in to relygyon And
dyssympled and seemed to be holy and was made lector / He was a magycyen and
counseylled with fendes / Of whom he had answer that he should yet be emperor
/ and so it happed afterward / For such needs came to constantyn that he
created Iulyan governor of his oste / And named him Cezar / He was a great
bateyller and man of werre / Then when constantyn was deed / He becam
emperor Then commanded he that gallycan the duc which was become so blessed
a man / should make sacrefyse to thidollys or else go out of the contraye / For
the emperor durst not slay so great a man / Then he went to alexa^drye And
there the mescreantes made one to run him thorough with a swerd / And so
deserved he the crown of martirdom / Then showed Iulyan the emperor the
couetyse of his heart And he confermed by wytnes of the gospel seyeng / our
lord Ihesus said who that renounceth not all that he has / May not be my
dyscyple / And therefore when he herd that the blessed saints / Ioh^n and poul
had the richesses that custance their lady had left to them / and they
sustained the pore christian people of our lord Jesus crist / he demanded them
that like as they had been with constantyn so would he that they should be with
him then they said to him when the glorious Constantyn / and constant his
sone gloryfyed them to be christian / we would well serve them / but sith that thou
have forsaken thy relygyon full of virtues / we ben departed fro the / ne we will
no more obey to the / Iulyen then said to them / I had the estate of a clerk
in the church / and if I would have abyden / I had had the most worshipful /
But because it is vanyte and folly to serve parisshis / and to be idle / I have
set my heart in cheuallrye / And therefore I have made sacrefise to the gods
/ And they have given to me the empire / And thus ye that have be brought forth
and norisshed in paleys ought to be by my side / and if ye have me in despyte /
I shall do so much that I shall not be despised / then ansuerd they / we love
better god than the / and we doubt nothing thy menaces by cause that we will
not anger our god then said Iulyan / if ye do not my will within x days
with your agreement / ye shall do it after against your will / The saints said
to him / think ye as though now the ten days were goon / And do this day that
which thou purposest to do then / to whom Iulyan wene ye that christian men
shall make you marters / but if ye consent to me I shall punysshe you / Not as
martirs / but as comen enemies / then Ioh^n and poule during these x days
intended to prayer and to alms / And after on the tenth day terencyen was
sent to them which said to them Our lord Iulyan has sent me to you That ye
should honor the image of Iouys which we bring to you / Or else ye must deye
/ Then they said to him / If Iulyan be thy lord / Have thou peace with him /
we have none other lord but Ihesu christ / when Iulyen herd these words / he
made their hedes to be smyterum offe secretlye and to be buried in their hows /
and after made to be said that they were sent in to exyle / Then anon after
the fend entered in to the son of terencya^ And began to cry in that house
that he was brent of the devil / When tirencyan saw this / He knoulechyd his
trespaas / And after becam christian and put in writing the passion of this ij
holy seyntes / And his son was delivered of the devil / This was den in the
year of grace four hundred sixty and four / Saint gregory records that a lady
vysitid often and gladly the church of these two seyntes / And when she came on
a time she fond two monks in strange abbyte And she supposed they had be
monks / She commanded to give them her alms / But whiles her despencier
approached to them / They approached to her and said / Thou visetest now us / But
we shall visyte the at day of Judgment / And shall give that / that we may
/ And when they had so said / Anon they vanysshed away / Then late us pray
unto god that by their merits / He give to us in this world his grace / And
in that other his glory / Per Cristum Dominum nostru^ Amen

Here follows of Saint leon the Pope
LEon the Pope as it is read in the myraclys of our blessed lady / In the
church of saint marie the more as he song there mass / and much people by
order were comyned and houseled / and a matrone a certain woman kissed his
hand / whereof he was tempted vehemently in his flesh / And this holy man was
a great wreker and auenger on him self and cut of his hand that same day
pryuelye and threw it fro him / Afterward the people murmured among them / by
cause the pope song no mass / And did not dyuyne seruyse solempnly as he was
wont to do / Then leon turned him unto the blessid virgyne our lady / and
co^mysed him self holy to her prouyde^ce Then she anon appeared to him / and
restored to him his hond and reformed it with her holy hands / co^maundyng
that he should goo forth and offer sacrefyse unto her son / Then this holy
man leo preched unto all the people that came theder / and showed euydently how
his hond was restored to him again / This leo the pope held the counsel at
Calcydon / and ordained vyrgynes to be vayled / It was also made there a
statute / that the vi^gyne marye should be called the mother of god / that same
time attila destroyed Italye / then leo wakyng prayed in ye church of
thappostlys three days and iij nyghtes / and after said to his men who that
will follow me late him follow / When then he approached to Attylle / Ano^ as he
saw seint leon / he descended fro his horse and fyl down platte to his feet /
and prayed him that he should ask what he would / And he desired that he should
goo out of Italye / and relece the christian people that he had in captyuyte / And
his servants repreued him that the tryumphyng prince of the world should be
ouercomen of a pressed / he answered / I have provided for my self and to you / I
saw on his right side a knight stondyng with aswerd drawn and saying to me /
But if thou spare this man thou shall be slain and all thy men / Then saint
Leo wrote a pistle to fabyane bishop of constantynople against enticium and
nestonum / which he laid upon the sepulcre of saint Peter and was in
contynuell fastings and prayers saying / O holy peter what that I have erred
in this epistle as man / thou to whom the cure of the church is commysed
correct and amend / And after xl days Peter apperid to him prayeng / and
said I have read it and amended it / Then leo took the epistle / and fond
it corrected and amended with the hands of thappostle / Other also xl days he
was contynuelly in fastings and prayers at the sepulcre of saint Peter /
Bysechyng to get him forgyuenes of his sins / To whom peter appeared and said
/ I have prayed our lord for the / and he has forgyuen the all thy sins /
sauf only of thymposicion of thy hand thou shall be examyned / He deyed about
the year of our lord four hundred and sixty

PEter had a great Name / For he was called Simon bariona / and simon is as
Much to say as right obeysaunt / or commysyng great heaviness / bariona is as
much to say as sone of a douue or of a culuer / he was obedyent when our lord
called him / For at voys of one only calling he obeyed to our lord / he was
co^mysing heaviness and sorrow when he renyed Ihesu christ / For he went out and
wept bitterly / he was son of the douue / For he served god with simple
Intencyon / Secondly he was called Cephas which is as much to say as chief /
or stone / or blamyng with the mouth he was said chief by reason of the
pryncipalyte in prelacyon / A stone by reason of his stedfastnes in his passion
/ blamyng with his mouth by reason of constau^ce in his prechyng Thirdly he was
called peter which is as much to say as knowing on vnhosyng / and shoyng or
vnbyndyng / knowing / for he knew the dygnyte of christ when he said thou art
christ son of the living god / In vnhosyng and shoyng / when he vnshodde his
feet fro thaffectyon of all dedely and erthely werk saying / loo we have left

Of Saint Peter
Saint Peter thappostle among al other and above all the other was of most
fervent and brennyng love / For he would have known the traytre that should
betraye our lord Ihesu christ As saint austyn says if he had known him he
would have torn him with his tethe / And therefore our lord would not name him to
him / For as Crisostome says if he had named him / peter had arysen / and all
to torn him Peter went upon the sea / he was chosen of god to be at his
transfiguraco^n And raised a maid from death to life he fond the statere or
piece of money in the fisshes mouth / He received of our lord the keys of the
kingdom of heaven he took the charge to feed the sheep of Ih^u crist / he
converted at a whitso^tide three thousand men / he heled claude with Ioh^n and
then converted v thousand men / he said to Ananye and saphyre their death
before / he heled Enee of the palscy / he raised thabyte / he baptized cornelye
/ with the shadow of his body / he heled seek men / He was put in prison by
herod / But by the angelle of our lord he was delyuerd / what his mete was
and his clothyng the book of saint Clement wytnessith / For he said bread only
with olyues and selde with wortes is mine usage / And I have such clothyng as
thou see a Cote and a mantel / And when I have that / I demand no more / It
is said for certain that he bare always a sudary in his bosom with which he
wyped the teres that ran from his eyes / For when he remembryd the sweet
presence of our lord for the great love that he had to him he might not forbere
weeping / And also when he remembered that he had renyed him he wept
habundauntly great plente of teres / In such wise that he was so acustomed to
weep that his face was brent with teres as it seemed / like as Clement says /
And says also that in the night when he herd the cock crow he would weep
customably / And after that it is read in historia ecclesiastica / That when
Saint Peter's wife was led to her passion / He had great joy / And called her
by her propre name and said to her / My wife remember the of our lord / On a
time when Saint Peter had sent two of his dysciples for to preche the faith
of Ihesu Christ / And when they had goon twenty day Iourneyes / one of them
deyed / And that other then returned to saint peter and told him what was
happened Some say that it was saint mercyal that so deyde / And sum say it
was saint maternus / And other say that it was saint Frank / Then saint
Peter gaf to him his staff and commanded that he should return to his felawe
and lay hit upon him / which he so did / Then he which had been xl days
deed / anon aroos al living / That time Simon thenchauntour was in Jerusalem /
And he said he was first truth / and affermed that who that would believe in
him he would make them perpetuel / And he also said that nothing to him was
impossyble / It is read in the book of saint Clement / That he said that he
should be worshipped of all men as god and that he might do all that he would
/ And he said yet more / when my mother Rachel commanded me that I should go
repe corn in ye field and saw the ziekle ready to repe with / I commanded the
siekle to repe by it self alone / And it reped ten times more than any other /
And yet he added herto more after Iherom / And said I am the word of god / I am
the holy ghost / I am almighty / I am all that is of god he made serpents of
brass to moeue / and made thymages of iron and of stone to lawhe / and dogs
to sing / and as saint line says he would dyspute with saint peter / and show
at a day assygned that he was god / and peter came to the place where the stryf
should be and said to them that were there / Pees to you brethern that love
troth To whom simon said / we have non need of thy peace / For if peace and
concord were made we should not proufyte to find the troth / For theuys have
peace among them / And ther^or desire no peace but bataile / for when ij men
fyghten / and one is ouercomen then is it peace / Then said peter why
dredest thou to here of peace / Of sins grow bateylles / where is no sin
there is pees / In dysputyng is truth founden and in werkis right wysnes /
Then said simon it is not as thou say But I shall show to the / the
power of my dygnyte / that anon thou shalt adoure me / I am first truth and
may flee by the air I can make new trees / and torn stones in to bread /
Endure in the fire without hurtyng / And all that I will / I may do / Saint
Peter disputed against all these / And disclosed all his malefyces / Then
simon magus s^eyng that he might not resyste peter / cast all his books in to
the sea lest saint peter should preue him a magycyen by his books / And went to
Rome where he was had and reputed as a god / And when Peter knew that / he
followed and came to Rome / The iiij year of claudyus the emperor peter came to
Rome / And satte there xxv year and ordained two bisshoppis as his helpars /
Line / and Clete / one within the walls / And that other without / He
intended much to prechyng of the word of god / by which he converted much
people to the faith of christ / And heled many seek men / and in his prechyng
alleway he preysed and preferred chastyte / He converted four concubynes of
agrippe the provost / So that they would no more come to him / wherefore the
provost sought occasyon against peter / After this our lord appeared to saint
peter saying to him / simon magus and nero purposen against the / dread the not
for I am with the / and shall give to the the solace of my serua^u^t paul /
which to morn shall come in to rome / Then peter knowing that he should not
long abide here assembled al his brethern / and took clement by the hond and
ordained him a bishop / and made him to sit in his oune sete / after this as
our lord had said tofore paul came to rome / and with peter began to preche the
faith of crist / Simon magus was so much byloued of nero / that he wend that
he had been the keeper of his lif / of his health / and of all the cite / on a day
as leo ye pope says as he stood tofore nero suddenly his visage changed / now
old / and now young which when Nero saw he supposed that he had be the sone
of god / Then said simon magus to nero / By cause that thou shalt know me
to be the very son of god / command my head to be smyten of / and I shall
arise again the third day / Then nero commanded to his brother to smite of
his head / and when he supposed to have byhede simon he byheded a ram / Simon
by his art magyke went away unhurt and gadred to geder the me^bres of the ra^me
and hyd him three dyees / The blood of the ra^me abode and congeled / The third
day he came and showed him to Nero saying command my blood to be wasshen away
/ For lo I am he that was byheded / and as I promised I have risen again the
third day / whom Nero seeing was abashed / and trowed verily that he had been
the son of god All this says leo / Sometime also when he was with nero
secretly with in his conclaue / The devil in his lyknes spoke without to the
people / Then the romans had him in such worship that they made to him an
image / and wrote above this title / To simon the holy god / Peter and paul
entered to nero / and discouerd al thenchantemens and malefyces of Simon magus /
And Peter added thereto seyeng that like as in Christ ben two substaunces / That
is of god and man So is in this magycyen ij substaunces That is of man and of
the Devil / Then said simon magus as saint Marcelle and leo witnessen / Lest
I should suffer any longer this enemy / I shall command my angellys / that they
shall aue^ge me on him / To whom Peter said I dread nothing thyn angellys / but
they dread me / Nero said Dredest thou not simon that by certain things
affermeth his godhed / To whom Peter said / if dygnyte or godhed be in him /
late him tell now what I think / or what I do / which thought I shall
first tell to the / that he shall not mow lie what I thynk to whom nero said /
come hither and say what thou thynkest / Then peter went to him and said to
him secretly / command some man to bring to me a barley loof / and deliver hit
to me pryuely / when hit was taken to him he blessed hit / and hyd hit under
his sleue / and then said he Now simon say what I think / and have said /
and done / Simon answered / lat peter say what I think Peter answered what
simon thinks that I know I shall do it when he has thought / Then Simon
having indygnacion cried a loud / I command that dogs come and devour him
/ And suddenly there appeared great dogs / And made an assault against Peter /
He gaf to hem of the bread that he had blessed / And suddenly he made them to
flee / Then said peter to nero lo I have showed you what he thought against me
not in words but in deeds / For where he promised angellis to come against me /
he browght dogs / thereby he shows that he has none angellys but dogs /
Then said simon / here ye peter and paul / if I may not grieve you here / ye
shall come where me shall behoue to Judge you / I shall spare you here / Hec leo /
Then Simon magus as Egesippus and lynus sayen / Elate in pride auaunted him
that he can reyse deed men to life / And it happed that there was a young man
deed / And then Nero let call Peter and Simon / And all gaf sentence by
the will of Simon that he should be slain that might not areyse the deed man
to life / Simon then as he made his incantaco^ns upon the deed body / he was
seen meue his head of them that stood by / then all they cried for to stone
peter / Peter uneath getyng scylence said / if the deed body live / let him
arise walk and spelie else know ye that hit is a fantasye that the head of
the deed man meueth / let Simon be taken fro the bed / and the body abode
vnmeuable / Peter stondyng aferre making his prayer cried to the deed body
seyeng / young man arise in the name of Ihesu christ of nazareth crucified / And
anon he arose living and walked / then when the people would have stoned Simon
magus / peter said / he is in pain enough knowing him to be ouercomen in his
heart / Our master has taught us for to do good for evil / Then said simon
to peter and poul / yet is it not come^ to you that ye desire / for ye be not
worthy to have martirdom / the which answered that is that we desire to have To
the shall never be well / For thou lie all that thou say / Then as marcel
says Simon went to the house of marcel and bond there a great dog black / at
the door of the house / and said now I shall see if peter which is accustomed
to come hither shall come And if he come this dog shall strangle him / And a
lytil after that peter and poul went theder / And anon peter made the sign of
the cross and vnbond the hound / And the hound was as tame and meke as a lamb
/ and pursewed non but simon And went to him and took and cast him to the
ground under him and would have estrangled him / And then ran peter to him
and cried upon the hound that he should not do him any harm / And anon the
hound left and touched not his body / But he all to rent and tare his goun
in such wise that he was almost naked / Then all the people and specially
children ran with the hou^d upon him And hunted and chased him out of the town
as he had been a wulf / Then for the repreef and shame / he durst not come in
to the town of all an hole year after / Then Marcelle that was dissciple of
simon magus seeing these great miracles came to peter / And was fro then
forthon his disciple / And after at the end of the year simon returned and was
received again in to thamyte of Nero / And then as leon seyth this simon
magus assembled the people and showed to them how he had been angered of the
galyleens / And therefore he said that he would leave the ate which he was wont to
defend and keep / And set a day in which he would ascend in to heaven / For
he dayned no more to dwell in therthe / Then on the day that he had
stablisshed like as he had said he went up to an hye tour which was on the
capytol / And there being crouned with laurer threw him self out fro place to
place and began to fle in thayer / Then said saint Poule to saint peter / hit
aperteyneth to me to pray / And to the for to comaunde Then said Nero this
man is very god / and ye ben two traytees / then said saint peter to saint
poul / Poul brother lift up thyn head and see how simon flees / Then saint
Poul said to saint Peter / when he saw him flee so hye / Peter Whi taryest
thou perform that thou have bygonne god now calls us / Then said Peter / I
charge and conjure you Angels of sathanas which bear him in thayer by the
name of our lord Ihesu christ / that ye bear ne sustain him no more / but lat
him fall to the earth And anon they let him fall to the ground and brake
his neck and head and dyed there forthwyth / And when Nero herd say that
simon was deed / and that he had lost such a man / He was sorouful / and said
to thappostles / ye have don this in despyte of me / And therefore I shall
destroy you / by right evil example / Hec leo / Then he delyuerd them to
paulyn which was a much noble man / And paulyn dely / uerd them to mamertyn
under the keeping of two knights process and martiniani / Whom saint peter
converted to the faith / And they then opened the prison / and let them all
goo out that would goo / wherefore after the passion of thappostles paulyne when
he knew that they were christian / byheded both process and martynyan / The
brethern then when the prison was opened prayed peter to goo thens / and he
would not but at last he being ouercomen by their prayers went away / And
when he came to the gate as leo witnesses which is called sca^ maria adpassus
he met Ih^u christ coming against him / And peter said to him Lord whither
ghost thou / And he said to him / I goo to rome for to be crucyfyed again / And
peter demanded him / lord shall thou be crucified again / and he said ye / and
peter said then lord I shall return again then for to be crucyfyed with the /
This said our lord ascended to heaven / Peter beholding it / which wept sore
/ and when peter understood that our lord had said to him of his passion he
returned And when he came to his brethern he told to them what our lord had
said / And anon he was taken of the mynystres of Nero / and was delivered to
the provost agryppe / then was his face as clear as the son as it is said
Then agrippe said to him / thou art he that glorifyest in the people / and in
wymen that thou departest fro the bed of their husbondes / whom thappostel
blamed and said to him / that he glorified in the cross of our lord Ih^u christ
/ Then peter was commanded to be crucyfyed as a stranger / and by cause that
poul was a cytezeyn of rome hit was commanded that his head should be smeten
offe / And of this sentence given against them sent dionyse in a pistle to
Tyimothe says in this wise / O my brother thymothe / if thou had seen
thagonyes of the end of them / thou sholdest have failed for heaviness and
sorrow / who should not weep that hour when the commandment of the sentence
was given against them that peter should be crucified / and poul be byheded /
thou sholdest then have seen the turbes of the Jews and of the payne^s that
smote them and spitte in their vysages / And when the horrible time came of
their end / that they were departed that one fro that other / they bond the
pylers of the world / but this was not without waylyng and weeping of the
brethern / Then said seint poul to seint Peter / Pees be with the / that art
foundement of the church / and pastor of the schepe and lambs of our lord /
Peter then said to poul / go thou in pees precher of good manners / Medyatour
/ ledar and solace of rightful people / And when they were with drawn fer fro
other / I followed my master / They were not both slain in on street / This
says saint dyonyse / and as leo the pope and marcelle witnessen when peter
came to the cross he said / when my lord descended fro heaven to therthe / he
was put on the cross right up / but me whom hit pleseth to call fro therth to
heaven / my cross shall show my head to therth / and adresse my feet to heaven
/ For I am not worthy to be put on the cross like as my lord was Therefore torn
my cross and crucyfye me my head dounward / then they turned the cross and
fastened his feet upward and the head dounward / Then the people were angrye
against nero and the provost and would have slain hem by cause they made seint
peter so to dye / but he required them / that they should not let his passion
/ and as leo witnesses Our lord opened the eyes of them that were there and
wept / so that they saw the angelys with crowns of roses and of lylyes
standing by peter that was on the cross with the angelys / And then Peter
received a book of our lord wherein he learned the words that he said / Then
as egesippus says Peter said thus / lord I have desired much to follow the /
but to be crucyfyed vpryght I have not usurped / Thou art allwey ryghtfull /
hye and sovereign / and we ben sons of the first man which have the head
inclined to therth of who^ the fall signefyeth the form of the generaco^n
humayne / Also we be borne that we ben seen enclyned to therthe by effect /
And the condition is changed For the world weneth that such thing is good
which is evil and badde / lord thou art all thing to me / and nothing is to
me but thou only / I yield to the thankynges with all the spyrite of which I
live / by which I understand And by Whom I call the / And when seint Peter
saw that the good crystyn men saw his glory / In yeldyng than kings to god
/ and co^mendyng good people to him / he rendered up his spirit Then marcel
and apuleus his brother that were his dissciples took of the body fro the cross
when he was deed / and enoynted hit with much precious oynement / and buried
him honorably Ysodore says in the book of the natiuyte and death of seyntes
thus / Peter after that he had governed Antioche he founded a church under
claudyus the emperor / he went to Rome ayens^e simon magus / there he preached
the gospel xxv year and held the bisshopriche / and xxxvi year after the
passion of our lord he was crucified by nero turned the head dounward for he
would be so crucyfyed / hec ysodorus / That same day peter and poul appeared to
saint dyonyse / as he says in his foresaid epistle in these words / understand
the miracle and see the prodyge my brother thymothe of ye day of the martirdom
of them for I was ready in the time of departing of them / After their death I
saw them to geder hond in hond / entryng the yates of the cite and clad with
clothes of light and arrayed with crowns of clernes and light / hec dionisius /
Nero was not vnpunyssyd for their death and other great sins and tyrannyes
that he commysed / for he slew him self with his owen hond / which tirannyes
were over long to tell but shortky I shall reherce here sum / he slew his
master seneca by cause he was aferd of him when he went to scole / Also Nero
slew his mother and slitte her belly for to see the place where he lay in / The
phisiciens and masters blamed him and said the sone should not slay his mother
that had borne him with sorrow and pain / then said he make ye me with child
and after to be deliuerd that I may know what pain my mother suffered / which
by craft they gaf to him a young frosshe to drink and grew in his belly / and
then he said but if ye make me to be deliuerd I shall slay you all / and so
they gaf him such a drink that he had a vomyte and cast out the frosshe / And
bare him on hand that because that he abode not his time it was misshapen /
which yet he made to be kept / Then for his plesyr he set Rome a fire /
which brennyd vij days and vij nyghtes / and was in an hye toure and enjoyed
him to see so great a flame of fire and song merylye / he slew the senators
of Rome to see what sorrow and lamentacyon their wives would make he wedded a
man for his wif / he fisshed with nets of gold threde / And the garment that
he had worn one day / he would never were it ne see it after / Then the
Romans seeing his wodnes assailed him and pursewed him unto without the cite /
And when he saw he might not escape them he took a stake and sharped hit with
his tethe / and therewith stak him self through the body / and so slew him self
/ In an other place it is read that he was devoured of wolves / then the
romans returned / and fond the frosshe and threw it out of the cite and
there brent hit / In the time of seint Cornelys the pope / greeks stale away
the bodies of the appostles peter and poul but the deuyls that were in the
ydoles were constreyned by the deuyne virtue of god and cried and said / ye
men of rome socour hastily your gods which ben stolen fro you / for which
thing the good christian people understood that they were the bodies of peter and
poul And the paynems had supposed that it had been their gods then assembled
great nombre of christian men and of paynems also / And pursewed so long the
greeks / that they doubted to have be slain / and threw the bodies in a pit
at catacumbas / but afterward they were drawn out by christian men / Saint
gregorye says that the great force of thondre and lightnyng that came fro heaven
made them so affrayed that they departed each fro other / and so left the
bodies of thappostles at catacombes in a pit / But they doubted which bones
were peter's and which poules / wherefore the good christian men put them to prayers
and fastings / and it was answered them from heaven / that the great bones
longed to the prechour and the lass to the fisshar / and so were departed / and
the bones were put in the church of him that it was dedicate of / and other
say that siluester the pope would halow the chirches and took all the bones
together and departed them by weyghte great and small / and put that one half in
one church and that other half in that other / And seint gregore recou^teth in
his dyalogue / that in the church of seint peter where his bones reste^ was a
man of great holiness and of mekenes named gencyen / And there came a maid into
the church which was crepel and drew her body and legs after her with her
hands / And when she had long required and prayed sent peter for health / he
appeared to her in a vision and said to her / Go to gencyen my servant / and he
shall restore thy health Then began she to crepe here and there through the
church and enquired who was gencyn / and suddenly it happed that he came to her
that him sought / and she said to him / the holy appostle saint Peter sent me
to the that thou sholdest make me hole and deliver me fro my disease / and he
answered if thou be sent to me fro him / Arise thou anon and goo on thy feet /
And he took her by the hand and anon she was all hole in such wise as she
felt nothing of her grief nor maladye / And then she thanked god and saint
peter / and in the same book saint gregore says wha^ that an holy priest was
com to the end of his life / he began to cry in great gladness / ye be welcome my
lords / ye be welcome / that ye vouchesauf to come to so lytyl and pour a
servant / and he said I shall come and thank you / then they that stood by /
demanded who they were that he spack to / And he said to them wondryng / have
ye not seen the blessed appostles peter and poul / and as he cried again his
blessed soul departed fro the flessh / Some have doubt whether peter and poul
suffered death in one day / For some say that it was the same one day / but one a
year after the other And Iherome and all the seyntes that trete of this matter
accorde^ that it was on one day and one year / And so is hit contained in an
epistle of Denis / and leo the pope says the same in a sermon saying we
suppose / but that it was not don without cause that they suffered in one day
and in one place the sentence of the tyrant / And they suffered death in one
time to the end that they should goo to geder to Ih^u christ / and both under one
persecutour / to the end that egall cruelte should strain that one and that
other / The day for their merit the place for their glory / And the
persecucyon one come by virtue / hec leo / thaugh their suffered both death in
one day and in one hour / yet it was not in one place / but in dyuerce w^thin
rome / And hereof says a versyfyar in this wise / Ense coronatus paulus cruce
petrus eodem / Sub duce / luce / loco / dux nero / Roma locus / That is to say
/ Paul crouned with the swerd And peter had the cross reuersed / the place was
the cite of rome / And how be it that they suffered death In one day yet saint
gregorye ordained that / that day specially should be the solempnyte of saint
Peter / And the next day Co^memoraco^n of saint poul / For the church of
saint Peter was hallowed that same day / And also for as much as he was more in
dygnyte / and first in conuercyon / and held the pryncypalite at Rome /

Thus ends the life of saint Peter thappostle


Here begins the life of saint Poul thappostle and doctor
POul is as much to say as the mouth of a trompe or of sense or merueylously
chosen / or a miracle of electyon Or paul is said of pausa that is rest / Or
it is said litill of latin / And by this ben vnderstonden vj prerogatyues /
which paul had before the other appostles / The first is a fruitful tongue /
For he renepleneshid the gospel fro Jerusalem to Ierico And therefore he is said
the mouth of a tromp / the ij was virtuous chary te for he said who is seek /
and I am not seek and therefore he is said mouth of s^ns or understanding / The
third is conuercion much merueyllous / and therefore he is said meruelously
chosen / For he Was meruellously chosen and converted The fourth is the hand
werchyng / and therefore he is said merueyllous of el^^tion / For it was a great
miracle when he chaas to get his dispences with the labor of his hands / and
to preche without cessyng / The fyfte was contemplacyon delycyous / For rest
of thought is required in contemplacyon / For he was rauisshid unto the third
heaven / The syxte was humylyte virtuous / and thereof he is said lytyl / Of this
name paul ben three opynyons / Orygene says that he had alleway two names /
and was called paulus and saulus / And Rabanus says that he was called saulus
/ and that was after Saul the proud king but after his conuercyon he was
callid poul / as it were lytyl and humble of spyrite / And therefore he said I am
leest of all the appostles / And bid said that he was called paul of Sergio
paulo proconsul whom he converted to the faith / And lynus the pope writes his
passy^n

Of Saint Poul doctor and Appostle
Saint Poul thappostle after his conuersyon suffered many persecucions / the
which the blissed hyllarye reherseth shortly saying / Poul thappostle was beten
with roddis by philippis / he was put in prison / and by the feet fast set in
stocks he was stoned in listris / In yceyne and thessalonyque he was pursewid
of wicked people / In Ephesym he was delyuerd to wyld beestis / In damask he was
let by a lepe down of the wall In Iherusalem he was arested / beten / bounden
/ and awayted to be slain / In Cezarea he was enclosed and deffamed Saylyng
toward ytalye he was in paryl of death / And fro thens he came to rome / and was
Iuged under nero and there fynysshid his life / This says saint hyllarye / Poul
took upon him to be appostle among the gentyles / ij lystris was a contracte
which he (...) and redressid / a young man that fylle out of a wyndow and dyed /
he raised to life / and did many other miracles at the I Will of metylene / a
sarpent lote his hand / and hurted him not / and he threw it in to the fire /
It is said that all they that came of the progenye and lynage of that man that
then herberowed poule may in no wise be hurt of no venomous beestis /
wherefore when their children be born they put serpents in thayr cradellis
for to prove if they be verily their children or no In some place it is said
that paul is less than peter / Otherwhile more / and sometime egalle and like
/ For in dygnyte he is less / In prechyng greter and in holiness they be egal /
haymond seyth that paul fro the cock crow unto the hour of five he labored
with his hands / and after entee^ded to preching and that endured almost to
night / the resydue of the time was for to ete / sleep / and for prayer /
which was necessary / He come to rome when nero was not fully confermed in
the empire and nero heryng that there was disputyng and questyons made between
paul and the Jews he retchyng not much thereof / suffered poul to go where he
would and preche freely / Ieronimus says in his book De uiris illustribus that
the xxxj year after the passion of our lord / the second year of nero saint
poul was sent to rome bounden / and ij year he was in free keeping and disputed
against the Jews / and after he was let go by nero / and prechid the gospel in
the west parties / and the xiiij year of nero the same year and day that peter
was crucified his head was smyten of Hec Ierommus / The wysdom and relygyon of
him was publisshed over all / and was reputed meruellous he gate to him many
friends in themperours h^us / and converted them to the faith of christ / and
some of his wrytynges were recyted and read tofore the emperor / and of al men
meruelously commendyd / and the senate understood of him hy things of
auctorite It happed on a day that poul prechid about eue^song time in a lofte
a young man named patroclus boteler of nero and with him welbyloued / went for
to see the multitude of people / and the better for to here paul he went up in
to a wyndowe / and there slepyng fill down and dyed / which when nero herd
was much sorry and heavy therefore / and anon ordained another in his office /
Paul knowing hereof by ye holy ghost said to them stondyng by him / That they
should goo and bring to him patroclus which was deed and that the emperor louyd
so much / whom when he was brought he raised to life and sent him with his
felawes to the emperor / whom the emperor knew him for deed and whiles he made
lamentacyon for him / hit was told to the emperor that patroclus was comen to
the yate / And when he herd that patrocle was alive he much merueyled and
commanded that he should come in To whom nero said / Patrocle lyuest thou / and
he said / ye emperor I live and nero said / who has made the to live again /
and he said the lord Ih^u Christ king of all worlds / Then nero being wroth
said / then shall he regne ever and resolve all the Royames of the world /
To whom patroclus said / ye certainly emperor / then Nero gaf to him a
buffette saying / therefore thou seruest him / and he said ye verily I serve him
that has raised me fro death to life / Then five of the mynystris of nero that
assisted him said to him / O emperor whi smitest this young man truly and
wisely answeryng to the / Trust verily we serve that same king almighty / And
when Nero herd that / he put them in prison for strongly to tormente them /
whom he much had loved / Then he made to inquire and to take all christian
men / And without examynacion made them to be tormented with over great
torme^tys / Then was paul among other bounden and brought to fore nero / To
whom nero said O thou man servant of the great king / bounden to fore me why
withdrawest thou my knights / and drawest them to the / To whom paul said /
Not only fro thy corner I have gadred knights / But also I gadre fro the
universal world to my lord / To whom our king yeueth such yeftes that never
shall fail / And grants that they shall be excluded fro all indygence
and need / And if thou will be to him subgette / Thou shall be sauf / For he is
of so great power / that he shall come and Judge all the world / and destroy
the figure thereof by fire / And when nero herd that he should destroy the
figure of the world by fire / commanded that all the christian men should be brent
by fire / and paul to be byheded as he that is gilty against his mageste And
then so great a multitude of christian people were slain then / that the people
of rome brake up his paleys / and cried and meued sedycion against him saying /
Cezar amend thy manners and attempre thy co^uaundementis / For these ben our
people that thou destroyest / and defend the empire of Rome / The Emperor then
dredyng the noise of the people / Changed his decree and edicte / that no man
should touch ne hurt no christian man till the emperor had otherwise ordained /
wherefore paul was brought a gayn to fore nero / whom as soon as nero saw he
cried and said take away this wicked man and byhede him / And suffer him no
longer to live upon the earth / To whom paul said / Nero I shall suffer a
lytyl while but I shall live eternally with my lord Ihesu crist Nero said
smite of his head / that he may understand me strenger than his king / that
when he is ouercomen we may see whether he may live after To whom paul said /
to thend that thou know me to live ever lastyngly / when my head shall besmyten
of / I shall appear to the living / And then thou may know that crist is god
of life and of death / And when he had said this / he was led to the place of
his martirdom / and as he was led / the iij knights that led him said to
him / Tell to us paul / who is he your king that ye love so much / that for
his love ye had lever deye then live and what reward shall ye have therefore
Then paul preched to them of the kingdom of heaven / and of the pain of
hell in such wise that he converted them to the faith / And they prayed (...)
to goo freely whyther he would / (...) forbede / brethern said he that I should
flee / I am not fugytyf / But the lauful knight of christ / I know well that fro
this transitorye life I shall goo to everlasting life / As Soon as I shall be
byheded / true men shall take away my body / Mark ye well the place and come
thither to morrow / and ye shall find by my sepulcre / two men luke and titum
prayeng / to whom when ye shall tell for what cause I have sent you to them /
they shall baptyse you / and make you heirs of the kingdom of heaven / and
whiles they thus spaken to geder / Nero sent two knights to look if he were
slain and byheded or no / And when thus saint poul would have converted them /
they said / when thou art deed / And rysest again then we shall believe / Now
come forth and receive that thou have deseruyd / And as he was led to the
place of his passion in the yate of hostyence / a noble woman named plantille a
disciplesse of paul / who after another name was called lemobia For happily
she had ij names met there with paul / which weeping commendyd her to his
prayers / To whom paul said / Fare well plantilla daughter of everlasting
health / lene to me thy veyl or keuerchief with which thou kouerst thy head /
that I may bind mine eyes therewith / and afterward I shall restore it to the
again / And when she had delyuerd it to him the bouchers scorned her saying /
why have thou delyuerd to this enchauntour so precious a cloth for to lose it /
Then when he came to the place of his passyo^ he tornid him toward the eest
holdyng his hondes up in to heaven right long with teres prayeng in his own
langage and thankyng our lord / And after that bad his brethern fare well and
bond his eyes him self with the keuerchyef of plantille / and knelyng down on
both knees stratched forth his neck / and so was byheded / And as soon as the
head was fro the body hit said Ihesus crystus / which had been to him so sweet
in his life / It is said that he named Jesus or crystus or both fyfty times /
Fro his wound sprang out milk in to the clothes of the knight / and afterward
flowed out blood / In thayer was a great shynyng ^^ght / and fro the body came a
much (...) odor / Dyonyse in a pystle to ^^ymothee / says of the death of
paul ^^us / In that hour full of heaviness my well-beloved brother / the boucher
saying Paul make ready thy neck / Then blessed paul looked up in to heaven
markyng his forhede and his breast with the sign of the cross / and then
said anon / my lord Jesus crist in to thy hondes I comende my spirit etc^ / And
then without heaviness and compulsion he stratched forth his neck / and
received the crown of martirdom / The bocher so smytyng of his head / The
blessid martyr poul took the keuerchif and vnbonde his eyes / and gadred up his
owen blood and put it therein / and delyuerd to the woman / Then the boucher
returned / and plantille met him and demanded him saying / where have thou
left my master / The knight ansuerd he lies without the town with one of
his felawes / and his visage is couerd with thy keuerchief / and she answered
and said I have now seen peter and paul enter in to the cite clad with right
noble vestementis / and also they had right fair crowns upon their hedes more
clear and more shynyng than ye son And has brought again my keuerchyef all
blody which he has deliuerd me / For which thing and werk many believed in
our lord and were baptized And this is that saint dyonyse says / And when Nero
herd say this thing he doubted him and began to speak of al these things with
his phylosophres and with his friends / and as they spoke to gydre of this
matter / paul came in and the yates shitte and stood tofore Cezar and said /
Cezar loo here is tofore the poul the knight of the king perdurable / and not
vaynauysshed / Now bileue then certeynly that I am not deed but alive / But
thou Chaytyf shall deye of an evil death / By cause thou have sleyne the
servants of god And when he had said thus he vanysshyd away / And nero what
for dread and what for anger he was nygh out of / his wit / and wist not what
to do Then by the counseyl of his friends he vnbonde patrocle and barnabe /
and let them goo where they would / And the other knights longynus master of
the knights and aggestus came on the morn to the sepulcre of poul / and there
they found two men prayeng that were luke and titus / And between them was
poule / And when luke and titus saw them they were abashed and began to flee
/ and anon poul vanyshyd away / and the knights cried after them and said /
we come not to grieve you / but know ye for troth that we come for to be
baptized of you / Like as paul has said whom we saw now prayeng with you /
when they herd that / they returned and baptized them with great Joy / The
head of saint paul was cast in a valey / And for the great multitude of other
hedes of men that Were there slain and thrown there it could not be known
which it was / It is read in thepystle of saint Dyonyse that on a time the
valey should be made clean / And the head of saint poul was cast out with
the other hedes / And a shepherde that kept sheep took it with his staff / and
set it up by the place where his sheep grased / he saw by iij nyghtes
contynuelly and his lord also a right great light shine upon the said heed /
Then they went and told it to the bishop and to other good christian men /
which anon said truly that is the head of saint poule / And then the
bishop with a great multitude of christian men took that head with great
reverence / and set it in a tablette of gold / and put it to the body for
to Join it thereto / then the patriarch answered we know well that many holy
men ben slain and their hedes ben desperpled in that place / Yet I doubt
whether this be the head of poul or no / but late us set this head at feet
of the body and pray we unto almighty god that if it be his head / that the
body may torn and Join it to the head / which plesed well to them all and
they set the head at feet of the body of poul / And then all they
prayed / And the body turned him and in his place Joined him to the head / and
then all they blessed god and thus knew verily that that was the head of
saint paul / this says saint dionyse And saint Gregory tells that there was
a man that fylle in despair in the time of Iustyn the emperor / And made ready a
cord to hang him self / and always he cried on saint poul saying Saint paul
help me / Then came there a black shadow saying to him / Hye the good man
make an end of that thou have begone / And he allewaye made ready the cord
saying / most bussyd paul help me / And when all was ready there came another
shadow as it had been of a man said to him that stired him / Fle hens thou
most wretch / For paul the advocate is come^ Then the foul shadow
vanysshed a way / and the man coming again to him self and castyng away the
cord took condign penance for his offense and trespass / In the same epistle
a for said saint denyse bewayleth the death of his master paul with mylde
words saying / who shall give teres to mine eyes / and to my brows a fountayn
of water that I may weep day and night that the light of ye church is extyncte
And who is he that shall not weep and wayle / and clothe him with clothes of
morning and sorrow / And in his mind be greatly abasshid / Loo Peter the
foundament of the church and glory of seyntes and holy appostles is goon fro
us / And has left us orpha^ns / Paul also the techer and comfortoure of the
people is failed to us and shall no more be found / which was fader of faders /
doctor of doctors / pastor of pastors / profoundnesse of wysedom / a tromp
sounyng hye things / And a prechour of truth / I say verily paul to be most
noble of thappostles and never weary of prechyng of the word of god he was an
erthly angelle an heavenly man / image and symylytude of dyuynyte / and has us
all forsaken ^edy and unworthy in this despised world / And is goon unto christ
his god his lord and friend / Alas my brother thymothee best byloued of my
soul / where is thy master / thy fader and lover / Fro whens shall he great
the any more / loo thou art made an orphane and remaynest allone / Now he shall
no more write to the with his own hond / my derest son / woo to me my brother
thymothee / what is happed to us / of heaviness / of derknes / and harm / By
cause we be made orphans / Now come not his epistles to the In which he wrote
/ paul the little servant of Jesus crist / Now he shall no more write to the
citees saying / receive ye my welbelouyd son / Shette my brother the books of
the prophets and clapse them / For we now have none enterpretour of the
parablys ne paradygmes / ne their dictes / Dauyd the prophet bewailed his
son and said / woe to me / who shall grant me to deye for the my son / woe
to me / And I may say woo to me / master mine verily woe to me / Nou the
concourse of thy dysciples coming to rome and sechyng cesseth and fails / Now
no man says / late us goo and see our doctors / and ask we them how us
behooves to rule the chirches to us commysed / And shall enterprete and
expoune to us the seyenges of our lord Jesus christ and of the prophets / verily
woe to these sons my brother thymothee / that been depryued of thayr spirituel
fader / And also to us that been deprived of our spirytuel masters which
gadred to gyder understanding and science of the old and new law / And put
them in their epistlis / where is now the renewyng of paul and the labor of
his holy feet / Where is the mouth spekyng and the tongue counseyllyng / and
the spirit well plesyng his god / Who shall not weep and waylle / For they that
have deserved glory and honor toward god / ben put to death as malefactors
and wicked men / woe to me that be held in that hour his blessed body all
bewrapped in his innocent blood / Alas my fader and doctor / thou were not
gilty of such a death / now whyther shall I go for to seche the / the glory of
christian men and preysyng of good true men / who shall stynt thy voys that
sowned so hye in the chirch in prechyng the word of god / loo thou have e^trid
in to thy lord and thy god whom thou have desired with all thyn affectyon
Jerusalem and Rome be evil friends For they ben egall in ylle / Jerusalem has
crucified our lord Ih^u crist / and rome has slain his appostles Ih^rlm
seruyth him that they crucyfyed / And Rome in solempnysyng glorifyeth them that
it has sleyne / and nou my brother thymothee thise ben they whom thou louedest
/ and desyredest with all thy heart / like as saul and Ionathas that were not
departed in life ne in death / and so I am not departed fro my lord and master /
but when ylle and wicked men depart us / And the separacyon of one hour shall
not be always / For his soul knows them that love him though they speak not
to him which now ben f^r from him / And at the day of the great ressurection
they shall not be departed from him / Hec dyonysyus / Saint Ioh^n Crisostm
says in the book of praysyng of saint poul / and commends this glorious
appostle much saying / what is founden suffycyent in commendaco^n of him sith
all the goodness that is in man / the soul possedeth it only / And has it in
him / And not only of a man but also of the a^gelis / And in what manner we shall
say to you here after Abel offered sacrefyce and of that he was preysed / but we
shall show the sacrefyse of paul / And it shall appear greter in as much as
heaven is heyer than the earth / For paul sacrefyed him self every day / And
offrid double sacrefyse in heart and in body which he mortefyed he offrid not
sheep ne nete / but he sacrefyed him self in double wise / and yet that
suffised him not / but he studied to offer to god all the world / For he
enuiro^ned all the world that is under heaven / and made angellis of men / And
more over the men that were like fendes / He changed them to angellis / who is
he that is found parayle or like to this sacrefyse / which poul with the
swerd of the holy ghost offered up to the autar which is above heaven / Abel was
slain by treson of his brother / but paul was slain of them whom he desired to
with draw and save fro Innumerable euillys His dethes were so many that they
may not well be nombred / he had as many as he leuyd days / Noe as it is read
kept him self his wife and his children in the ark / but paul in a more
perri^ous and older flood in an arc not made with bordes with pitche and glewe
/ But with epistles made for bordes / delyuerd and saved the universal world
fro the flodes of error and of sin / This Arc or ship was not born to one
place but it was sent through the universal world / ne lymed with pitche ne
glewe / but the bordes thereof were enoynted with the holy ghoost / He took them
that were worshippers of reasonable bestes almost more foles than unreasonable
bestes for to be the folowers of angellis / He ouercam that arc in which was
received the crow / and sent him out again / and closyng a wolf therein / whoos
wodenes he could not change / But this poule took fawcons and kytes / and made
of them douues / And excluded all wodenes and ferocite fro them / and brought
to them the spirit of mekenes / Sum meruaille of abraham that at the
commandment of god left his country and kynredde / but how may he be com
compared to paul / which not only left his contree and kynrede / but also
him self and the world also he forsook and dyspised all thing / and required
to have but one thing / and that was the charity and love of Ihesu crist / Ne
he desired things / present / ne things to come etc^ but abraham put him
self in parel for to save his brothers son But paul sustained many parellis
for to bring the universal World fro perellys of the devil / and brought other
to great surete with his own death / Abraham would have offered his son ysaac to
god / but paul brought neither friend ne neighbor / But offered him self to
god a thousand times / So^me meruele of the paciens of ysaac For he suffered the
pittes that he made to be stopped / but paul not beholding the pyttes stopped
with stones / ne his owen body beten only / But them of whom he suffered great
peynes / he studied to bring to heaven / And the more this well was stopped /
so much the more it flowed out stremes in shedyng of water of scripture of
mekenes and of pacyence / Of the pacyence of Jacob scripture merueylleth /
which abode vij year for his spouse / But who has that soul of an ademant yt
may follow the pacyence of paul / For he abode not only vij year for crist his
spouse / but all his life time / he was not only brent with the hete of the day
/ ne suffered only the frost of the night / But suffryng temptacions / now with
betynges / now stonyd with stones / And always among his tormentis caught the
sheep and drew them to the faith from the mouth of the devil / And also he
was made decorate and made fair with the chastity of Joseph / And here I doubt
lest so^me would take it for a lesyng for to preyse here paul / which
crucifyeng him self not only the beauty of mennis bodies but all such things
that were seen to be fair and clear that he beheld set no more by them then
we do by a little ashes or fylthe / and abode vnmeuable as a deed man to a deed
man / all men wondre at Job / for he was a marvelous champyon / but paul was
not only troubled by months / but many years enduryng in agonye / and all
wey apperid clear / He put not away the wodenes of his flessh with a sherde or
shelle but he ran daily as the understanding mouth of a lion / and faughte
against innumerable temptacions which were more tolerable than a stone / which
not of iij or iiij ffrendes / but of all men and of his brethern he suffered
obprobryes / and was confused and cursed of them all / and he took ever
mekelye and patiently / Job was a man of great hospitalyte and had cure of
pour people / and that he did was to sustain the fylth of the flesh / But
saint poul labored to help the sekenes of the sowlis / Job opened his house to
every man that came / But the soul of paul showed him to the universal world
/ Job had sheep and oxen Innumerable And of them he was lyberal to pour men /
Poule had no pocessyon sauf his body / And with that he mynystred suffyciently
to them that had need / which in a place says / unto my nescessytes / and to
them that were with me these hondes have mynystred / And to holy Job were yeuen
worms / wounds / and sores which did to him much pain and sorrow / but and
thou will considre paul y^ shall see / betynges hongre / cheynes / and peryllys
that he suffered of his known men / and of s^^aungers / he suffered of all the
world besynes for the chyrches / and brennyng for sklaundres / thou may see
that he was harder than any stone / and his soul ouercam with infirmyte iron
and adamant / what Job suffered with his body / That paul sustained with his
mind which is more grievous than any worm / And often his eyes flowed of teres
not only on days / But also on nyghtes / he was more tormented than a woman in
the birth of her child wherefore he said / My little children whom yet I bring
forth / Moses chas for to be defaced out of the book of life for the health of
the Jews / and offryd him self to perysshe with other / But paul would not
only perysshe with his kynrede but that all other should be saved would be cast
down from ever lastyng Joy / And moses repugned against pharao / And paul
against the devil every day / He for one people of the Jews / And paul faught
for all the universal world / Not by sweet / but by blood / Saint Ioh^n the
baptyst / ete locustes and wyld honey / but paul in the myddle of the world was
as strayte in his conversation / as seint Ioh^n was in deserte Not only he was
fed with locustes and wild honey but with much fouler mete he was content /
For often he left his necessary mete for the fervent study that he had to
preche the word of god / Truly there appiered in saint Johan great constance in
prechyng against herodiades But Paul not one ne two ne three but he corrected
Innumerable men set up in hye power / And also older tyrauntes / It rests
now that we compare paul to Angellys In which we shall preche a great thing
for with all charge / they obeyen unto god / which dauyd says merueyllyng /
that they be mighty in virtue / And ever done the commandments of god / And
also the prophet says / that he makes his angellys spyrites / And his
mynystres fire brennyng / And all this we may find in paul / that like to
fire and a spyrite he has run thrououte all the world / and with his
prechyng has purged it / And yet he has not sorted heaven / and that is
wonderful / For he conuersed such as in heaven / and was yette enuyronned with
his mortal flesh / A lord how much be we worthy dampnacion / when we see all
good things to be assembled in one man / And we study not to follow the least
part of them / Ne he had in this world none other thing / Ne none other nature
/ ne none other soul dyssemblable to us / ne dwelling in none other world /
but in the same earth and the same regyon / also under the same laws
nourisshed and manners / and he surmounteth all men that now ben or have been by
virtue of his courage / Ne this thing is not to be merueilled in him only / that
for the haboundau^ce of devotion he felt no pain / But he recompensyd in him
the virtue for his reward / And when he saw that his death approchyd / He
called other to the delight of his Joy saying / Make ye Joy and rejoice ye
with me / And certeynly he hasted more to wrongs and Iniuryes which he
suffered for his true prechyng / And was gladder thereof than he were boden to a
feste of great Joy / For he desired more death than bodily lif / and he desired
more pouerte than richesse / and traueyle than rest / for in his rest he chaas
rather weeping than rest He used to pray more for his enemies than other do
for their friends And above all other thing he dradde the wrath of god / And
had none other desire / But only to plese god And he forsook not only all
present things / But all things that been for to come / He refused all
prosperytees that ever were or ever shall be in earth / and if we shall speak of
heavenly things / thou shall see the love of him in Ih^u christ / And with this
love he thought him self blessed / he converted not to be felaw with angelys ne
archangelys ne with none order of angelis but he coueyted more with the love of
god to be lest of them that be punyshed / than without his love to be among
souerayn honors / and that was to him most gretest tormente for to depart fro
his love / for that departing should (...) him an hell and pain wythouten end
And on that other side for to use the charity of christ was to him life world and
promyssyon / and all goods with out nombre / And so he despised all that we
dread / like as we despise an herb putrefyed and roten / he reputed the
tirauntes conspyryng their furour in to the appostles / like as bytynges of
flees / and he reputed death cruelnes and a thousand torments / but as a play
or game of children / whiles he suffered them for crystes sake / he thought he
was made more fair with byndyng of cheynes / Than he had be crouned with a
dyademe / For when he was constrained to be in prison / he thought he was in
heaven / And he received more gladlyer betynges and wounds / than other
victoryes / he loved no less sorrows than medes / For he reputed tho sorrows
instead of rewards / And such things yt ben to us cause of sorrows were
unto him great delight / And was ever enbraced with great wepynges wherefore he
said / who is sclaundred and I brenne not / and who can sey I delight in
sorowyng / many ben wounded with the death of their children / and take comfort
when they may weep enough / and it is most greuau^ce to them when they ben
restrained from their weeping / In like wise paul night and day had consolacion
of his teres and weeping / there could no man weep ne bewail his oun defautes /
as he bewailed other me^nes defaultes / for like as thou wenest him to be in
torment that wepeth the perysshyng for his sins the which desire to be
excluded fro the Joy of heaven to the end that they might be saved / ffor he
felt as much the perysshyng of other souls as he felt or trowed him self to
perisshe / to what thing may he then be lykened / to what iron / or to what
adamant / For he was strenger then any adamant / and more precious than gold
or ge^mys / that one matter he overcome with strength and that other with
precyousnes / then we may say that poul is more precious than all the world
and all that is therein / For he fleyhe as he had had wings through all the
world in prechyng / and he despised al labors and perellys / as though he had been without body / And like as he posseded heaven so he despised all erthly
things And like as iron that is leyde in the fire is made all fire / Right so
paul enbraced with charity was made all charity / And right as it had been a
common fader of all the world / so he louyd all men and surmounted all other
faders bodyly and ghoostly by curyosite and pity / And desired and hasted him
to yield all men to god and to his kingdom / as though he had engendered them
all / This holy paul that was so simple and used the craft to make baskettis
came to so great virtue / that in ye space of xxx year he converted to the
christian faith / the persees and parthes / them of mede / the yndes and the
Scites / the Ethiopes / the Saromates and sarasyns / and more over al manner men
/ and like as fire put in straw or in towhe wastes it / right so wastyd poule
all the werkis of the fend And when he was led through the great see / he
Ioyed him as greatly as though he had been led to see an empire / And when he
was entered in to Rome / It suffyced him not to abide there / but he went in to
spain / And was never idle ne in rest / But was always more brennyng than fire
in the love to preche the word of god / Ne dradde no parrellys / ne had no
shame of despytes / But was ever ready unto battle / And anon shewde him self
pesyble and amyable / And when his discyples saw him bound in cheynes for
all that he sessed not to preche whiles he was in prison / wherefore some of the
brethern consyderyng his techyng took the more strength to them / And were
more constant against the enemies of crystes faith / and al this and much more
says saint Ioh^n grisostom / which were over much to write here but this shall
suffyse / then late us pray unto almighty god that by the merits of saint
poul we may have foryeuenes of our sins and trespaces in this present life
that after the same we may come to ever lastyng Joy in heaven /

Thus ends the commemoracion of Saint poule thappostle and Doctoure /
Here folowen the lives of the vij brethren /
THe seven brethern were sons of Saint felycite whose names be January /
ffelix / philippe / siluanus / alexander vitalis and marcialis / All these were
called by the commandment of the emperor anthonye / to fore publyen the
prouoste / And then the prouoste counseylled the mother that she sholld have
pity upon her self and on her sons / who answered and said / Neither for thy
flateryng ne by thy blaundesshyng words thou may not draw me to thy desire
/ ne with thy thretenynges thou may not break me I am assured of the holy
ghoost whom I have that I shall a live overcome the / And better shall
vaynquysshe the when I am deed / and then she turned her to her sons and
said / My sons see the heaven and look upward my derest children / for christ
abides you there ffyght ye strongly for christ / and show you faithful and
true in the love of Ih^u crist / and when the provost herd that / he
commanded that she should be smeton and buffeted / and as the mother and her
sons abode most constantly in the faith / the mother seeing and comfortyng them
/ they were sleyn with diverse tormentis / and saint gregore calls this
blessed felicite more than a martyr / ffor she suffered vij times death in her
vij sons / and the eight time in her propre body / and he says in his omelye
that saint felicyte in byleuyng was the ha^dmayde of crist and in prechyng was
made the martyr of crist and she dredde to leave after her for to live her vij
sons in prison like as wordly friends dread lest they should deye in prison /
she childed and bare them by the holy ghoost / whom she had born to the world
of her flesh / and them whom she knew well were of her own flessh / she might
not see dye without sorrow / but it was the force of the love within forth /
that ouercam the sorrow of the flessh / and I have said by right this woman to
be more than a martyr that so often has be extynct in her sons in which she
has therein multeplyed martirdom / she ouercam the victory of martirdom when
for the love of god her only death suffyced her not / And they suffered death
about the year of our lord Cx under decius the emperor /

Here ends the passion of the vij brethern
The life of Saint Theodora
THeodora was a noble woman and a fair in Alysaunder in the time of zenone
the emperor / and had a rich man to her husbond and dredyng god / The devil
having envy to the holiness of theodore / entysed a rich man of the town in to
the concupiscence of her / which sent to her diverse messagers and yeftes
requyryng that she would assent to his desire / but she refused their message
and despised the yeftes / he was so besy on her and so much grievous that she
could have no rest / and was almost overcome / at last he sent a witch /
and promised to her many things if she could bring about that she should
consent to his desire / and she went and exorted her to do this sin with y^
man and to have pity on him / To whom she said that to fore god al things were
known / wherefore she would in no wise do so great a sin and this false
enchau^teresse said / what someuer is don in the day time god sees and knows
/ But what is don after the son is down in the west and is derke / god
knows no thing thereof / to whom theodora said / say thou truth / ye
verily I tell you truth / And so the woman being deceived bad the man should
come at nyggt and she should accomplyssh his will and desire / and when this ylle
woman had told this to the man / he was glad and Joyful and kept his hour and
had his will of her / and departed / theodora retornyng to her self began to
weep most bytterly / and smote her vysage and breast saying / Alas Alas I have
lost my soul / And have destroyed the beauty of my name / her husbond came fro
without / and fond his wife so sorowyng and desolate / desired to know the
cause for to comfort her / But she would receive no consolacion / On the morn
erly she went to a monasterye of nonnes / and demanded of the abbess / if god
could know any sin don and commysed by night after the day was passed To
whom she said / Nothing may be hyd fro god / For god sees and knows all
that is don in what hour it be commysed by night or day / And then she wept
bitterly saying / give me the book of the gospellys that sum lotte may fall
to me / And she openyng the book fond wreton / Quod scripsi scripsi / Then
she returned home to her hows / And on a day when her husbonde was out / she
cut of her here / and clad her with the clothes of her husbonde / and went to
a monasterye of monks which was xviij mile thens / And hyed her / and there
required that she might be received with the monks / She was demanded of her
name and she said that she was named Theodorus / And there she was received /
And mekely did all thoffyces / and her service was acceptable to every body /
After certain years / thabbot called brother theodorik for to yoke the oxen /
and commanded her that she should goo to the cite and fetch oil / her husbond
wept much for sorrow / and dredde lest she were goon away with an other man /
And the angelle of god appeared to him and said Arise erly and stand in the way
of the marters Peter and paul / and she that shall mete the / is thy wife /
which don theodora with her camellis came and seeing her husbond / knew him well
/ And said within her self / alas good husbond how much labor do I that I
may have forgeuenes of the sin that I have don to the / And when she
approached him she salowed him saying / Our lord give the Joy my lord He
nothing knew her / And when he had long abyden he held him deceived / And a
voys said to him / he that yesterday salowed the / was thy wife / Theodora was
of so great holiness that she did many miracles / She saved a man al to torn
with a wyld best by her prayers / And she cursed that best / and suddenly it
dyed and fyl down / The devil could not suffer her holiness / apperid to her
saying / Thou strompet above all other and aduoulterer / thou have forsake thy
husbond for to come hither and despise me / By my might and power I shall reyse
a battle against the / and but I make the renye the crucified god / say it am
not I / She made the sign of the cross / And anon the devil vanysshed / On a
time as she returned fro the cite / And in a certain place was herberowed / a
we^che came to her in the night saying / Sleep with me this night / whom she
refused And then this wenche went to a another / that lay in the same hostery
/ when her belly began to swelle / she was demanded of whom she had conceived
And she said that monk has leyn by me / when the child was born they sent it
to the Abbotte of the monasteri which blamed sore theodorik / and he mekely
demanded that it might be forgyuen him / but he was cast out of the monastery
/ and took the child upon his sholder / and so she abode out of the monastery
vij year / and norisshid the child with the milk of the bestes / the devil
having envy of her much pacyence in the lyknes of her husbonde he transfygured
him / and came and said to her / come now thou my wif / for if thou have leyn
with another man I forgive it the / and she had supposed it had be her husbond
/ and said I shall no more dwell with the / for the son of Johan the knight
has leyn by me / and I will do penance for that I have sinned against the /
and she made her preyer / and anon the devil vanisshyd away / and knew that it
was the devil / another time the devil would make her afferd for deuylles came to
her in the lykenes of terryble wyld bestes / and a certain man said to hem /
ete ye this strompet she then prayed / and anon they vanysshed away / Another
time a multitude of knights came whom a prince tofore and the other worshipped
him / which knights said to theodore arise and worship our prince / which
answered I worship and adoure my lord god and when it was told to the prince /
He commanded that she should be brought to fore him / And to be tormented with
so many torments / that she should be esteemed for deed / And then she made
her prayers / And all the multitude vanysshed away / Another time she saw
there much gold / and she blessed her and commended her to god / And it
vanysshed away / another time she saw a baskette born full of all manner of
good mete / And he that bare it said to her / The prince that beat ye says /
that thou sholdest take this and ete / for he did it vnwittyngly / she blessed
her and anon he vanysshed away when the seven year were complete that she had been out of the monestarye / the abbot consyderyng her pacyence took her in
again in to the monasterye with her child / And uneath two year after when she
had laudably accomplysshed her obseruaunce / she took the child and closed it
with her in her celle / And when the abbot knew thereof he sent certain of his
monks to take heed what she did and said / And she embrasyng the child and
kissyng said My sweet son the time of my death comes / I leave and command
the to god / take him for thy fader and helper And my sweet son see that thou
fast and pray / And serve my brethern devoutly / And she this saying yaf up
her spirit and slepte in our lord / About the year of grace four hundred
sixti and x / which the child beholding began to weep bytterly / In that same
night was a visyon showed to thabbot in this wise / him seemed that a great
marriage was made and thereto came angellys prophets marters and all seyntes /
And in the myddle of them was a woman besette about with great glory / And
they that assysted her worshipped her / And a voys was herd saying / This is
theodoryk the monk that was falsely accused of a child / And seven times ben

Here follows the life of seint Swithine bishop /
SAint Swithyne the holy confessor was born besides wynchester in the time of
Saint Egberte king / he was the vij king after kenulf that saint byryne
cristened / For saint austyn cristened not all england in saint athelbertus
days / but saint byryne cristened the west party of england in the days of
kenulf the king / And that time this holy Saint Swythyne served our lady so
devoutly / that all peole that knew him / had great Joy of his holiness And
elmeston that was in that time bishop of wynchester made him priest And then
he lived a strayter living than he did before / And he become then so holy in
living / that king Egbert made him his chaunceler / and chyef of his counseyll
and set ethulf his sone and his heyer under his rule and guydyng / And prayed
him to take heed to him that he might be brought up virtuously / And within
short time after the king deyed / And then his sone ethulf was made king
after him And he guyded this land full well and wisely that it increased greatly
in good living through the counseyl of Saint Swythyne / And when Elmeston the
bishop of wynchester was deed / Swythyne was made bishop there after him
whereof the people were full glad and by his holy living he caused the people to
live virtuously / And to pay truly their tithes to god and holy church / And
if any church fyl down or was in decay / seint Swythyne would anon amend it at
his own cost / Or if any church were not hallowed he would goo thither a foot
and halowe it / For he louyd no pride ne to ride on gay horse / ne to be praised
ne flatred of the people which in these days such things be vsyd over much
god cease it / Saint Swythyne guyded full well his bysshopryche / And did much
good to the town of wynchester in his time / He did do make without the west
gate of the town a fair bridge of stone at his proper cost / And on a time there
came a woman over the bridge with her lap full of eggs / And a rechelles felaw
stroglyd and wrestlyd with her / And brake all her eggs / And it happed that
this holy bishop came that way the same time And bad the woman let him see
her eggs / And anon he lift up his hand and blessed the eggs / And they were
made hole and sound euerichon by the merytes of this holy bishop / And being
then glad thanked god and this holy man for the miracle that was don to her /
and sone after deyde king ethulf / And his sone Egbert reyned after him / And
after him was athelbert king / And in the third year of his regne deyde this
blessed bishop saint Swythyne / And when he should deye he charged his men to
bury him in the chircheyerde For the people should not worship him after his
death / For he louyd no pomp by his life / Ne none would have after his death / He
passyd to our lord the year of grace viij hundred and vj / And he lay in the
church or he was translated an hundred and ix year / And odd dayees / But in
the time of holy king Edgar his body was translated and put in a shrine in
thabbay of wynchester by saint dunstone and Ethelwold /

And the same year was saint Edward king and martyr shryned at shaftesbury /
These two bishops dunston and Ethelwold were warned by our lord to see that
these two holy seyntes Swythyne and Edward should be worshypfully shryned / And
so they were within short time after / And an holy man warned Ethelwold whiles
he lay seek to help that these two holy bodies might be shryned / And then
he should be parfyghtly hool / And so endure to his lives end / And the token
is / that ye shall find on Saint Swythynes grave / Two rings of iron nailed
fast thereon And as soon as he set hand on the rings they come of / of the
stone and no token was seen in the stone / where they were fastened in / and when
they had taken up the stone fro the grave / they set the rings to the stone
again / And anon they fastened to it by them self /

And then this holy bishop gaf lawde and praysyng to our lord for this
miracle / And at openyng of the grave of saint Swythyne such a sweet odor
and savor issued out ye king edgar and all the multitude of people were
fulfilled with heavenly swetenes / And a blind man received there his sight
again / And many men heled of diverse sekenes and maladyes by the merits of
this holy Saint / Saint Swythyne / to whom ^ate us preye / that he be our
aduocat to the good lord for us etc^

at three of the clock the fyfty year after his passion / For this glorious saint
our lord has showed many great miracles / as well by his life / as after his
death and martirdom For a little to fore his death a young man deyed / and was
raised again by miracle / And he said that he was led to see the holy order
of saints in heaven And there he saw a sete void / And he axed for whom it

like as the priest had said / And then assoyled him and lycensyd him to say
mass as he did before commaundyng him to keep this thing secrette as long as
he lyuyd / There was a lady in england / that desired gretely to have graye
eyes / For she had a conseyt she should be the more beauteuous in the sight of
the people / and only for that cause she made a vow for to vysite saint Thomas
upon her bare feet / and when she came thither / and had devoutly made her
prayers to have her desire Suddenly she wax start blind / And Then she
perceived that she had offendyd and displesid our lord in that request / And
cried god mercy of that offense / And besought him full mekely to be reestored
of her sight again / And by the merits of the blessed saint Thomas / she was
restored to her sight again / and was glad to have her old eyes / And returned
home again / and lived holyly to her lives end / Also there was a lords karuer
that brought water to him at his table to whom the lord said / if thou ever

should not be most prouffytable for his soul / Then he returned again to the
tomb of saint Thomas / And prayed if his health were not prouffytable to his
soul / that his old sekenes might come again to him / And it came anon again
to him and endured unto his lives end / And in like wise there was a devout
blind man which had his sight restored to him again by the merits of saint
thomas / but after he repented him for he could not be so quyete in his mind
as he was before / he had then so much lettyng by seeing the vanytees of the
world / wherefore he prayed to our lord that by the merits of Seint Thomas he
might be blind again to the world as he was before / and anon he had his desire
/ and lyuyd after full holily to his lives end / who should tell all the
miracles that our blessid lord has showed for this holy martyr it should over

Thus ends The translacyon of Saint Thomas martyr /
Here follows the life of saint Kenelme king and martyr
^Aynt kenelme martyr was king of a part of england by walys / his fader was
king to fore him / and was named kenulph and founded the abbey of wynchecomb /
and set therein monks / and when he was deed he was buried in the same abbey
/ And that time wynchecombe was the best town of that contraye / In England ben
iij pryncipaul rivers And they ben tamyse / Seuarn / and Humbre / This king
kenelme was king of wurceter shyre warwik shyre and gloucetre shyre / and the
bishop of wurcetre was bishop of those iij shires and he was king also of
Derby shyre chesshyre / shropppyre / staffordshyre / her fordchyre / notyngham
shyre / norhampto^ shyre / Bokynghamshyre / oxfordshire leycetreshyre / and
lyncolnshyre / All this was called the march of walys / and of all those
contryes saint kenelm was king and wynchecombe that time was chyef cite of all
these shyres and in that time were in england vj kings / And before that /
Oswold had been king of all england / And after him it was departed in saint
kenelmes days / kenulf his fader was a full holy man / And dornemyld and
que^drede were susters of saint kenelme and kenulf his fader deyde the year of
our lord viij Cxix / Then was kenelme made king when he was vij year of age /
And his suster dornemild louyd him much / and they lyuyd holyly to gydre to
their lives end / but quyndrede that other suster turned her to wyckednes /
and had great envy at her brother kenelme / by cause he was so rich above her
/ and labored with all her power to destroy him by cause she would be queen
and regne after him and let make a strong poison / and gaf it to her brother /
But god kept him yt it never greuyd him / and when she saw that she could not
prevail against the king in that manner / She labored to Askeberd which was
chief ruler about the king / and promised to him a great sum of money / and
also her body at his will / if he would slay this young king her brother / And
anon they accorded in this treson / And iij this while and that same time this
young holy king was a sleep and dremed a meruellous dreme / For him seemed that
he saw a tree stand by his beds side / and that the heyght thereof touched
heaven / and it shyned as bright as gold / and had fair branches full of blosmes
and fruit / And on every branch of this tree were tapers of wax brennyng
and lamps light / which was a glorious sight to behold and him thought that
he clymed upon this tree / And askeberd his governor stood bynethe and hew
down this tree that he stood on / And when this tree was fallen down this holy
young king was heavy and sorouful / and him thought there came a fair byrd which
flewgh up to heaven with great Joy / And anon after this dreme he awoke / and
was all abasshid of this dreme / which anon after he told to his norice
named wolwelyne / And when he had told to her all his dreme / She was full
heavy / and told to him what hit mente And said his suster and the trayter
askaberde had falsely conspired his death For she said to him / that he had
promised to quendrede to slay the / And that signefyeth that he smyteth down
the tree that stood by thy beds side / And the byrd that thou saw flee up
to heaven signefyeth thy soul that angellys shall bear up to heaven after thy
martirdom / And anon after this askaberde desired the king that he should goo
and disporte him by the wodes side named Clent and as he walkid the young king
was al heavy and leyd him down to sleep / and then this false traitor purposed
to have slain the king / and began to make the pyt to bury him in / But anon as
god would the king awoke / and said to this askaberd that he labored in vayn /
ffor god will not that I dye in this place / But take this small rod / and
there as thou shall set it in the earth / there shall I be martred / And
then they went forth to gydre a good way thens / till they came to an hawthorn
/ And there he pyght the rod in therthe / and forthwith incontinent it bare
grene leuys / and suddenly it wexe to a great asshe tree / the which stondeth
there yet unto this day / and is called kenelms asshe / and there this askaberd
smote of this holy young kings head / And anon his soul was born up in to
heaven in lykenes of a white douue / and then the wyckid traitor drew the
body in to a great valey between ij hills / and there he made a deep pit and
cast the body therein and leyde the head upon it / And whiles he was about to
smite of the head / The holy king knelyng on his knees said this holy cantycle
Te deum laudamus / till he came to this veers / Te martirum candi datus / And
therwyth he yaf up his spyryte / to our lord Ihesu christ in lykenes of a douue
/ as before is said / Then anon this wicked man askaberd went to quendrede and
told to her all alonge how he had don / whereof she was full glad / And anon
after took on her to be queen / and charged on pain of death that no man should
speak of kenelme / And after that she abandou^ned her body to wretchyd living
of her fflessh in lecherye / and brought her owen men to wretchyd living / And
this holy body lay long time after in that wode called Clent / For no man durst
fetch him thens to bury him in hallowed place for fere of the queen queen dread
/ and it was so that a pour wydow by which had a white Cow / which every
day was driven in to the wode of clent / And anon as she was there she would
depart and goo in to the valeye where kenelme was buried / and there rest
all the day syttyng by the corpse without mete / And every night come home with
other bestes fatter and gaf more milk than any of the other kyen / And so
contynwed certain years / whereof the people merueyled / that she ever was in so
good point and ete no mete / That valey where as saint kenelmes body lay is
called Coubage / After on a time as the pope song mass at rome in Saint Peter's
church / Suddenly there came a white douue and let fall a scrowe on the altar
whereon the pope said his mass / And these words were wreton therein in lettres
of gold / In Clent in Coubage / kenelme king barn / lies under a thorn / his
head of shorn / And when the pope had said his mass He showed the scrowe to
all the people But there was none that could tell what it mente / till at
last there came an englyssh man / And he told it openly tofore all the people
what it meant And then the pope with all the people gaf laud and praysyng to
our lord / and kept that skrowe for a relyque / And the fest of saint kenelme
was hallowed that day solempnly thorough all rome / And anon after the pope
sent his messagers in to england to the archebysshop of caunterbury named
wylfryde / And bad him with his bishops goo and seek the place where the holy
body lies / which is named Cowbage in the wode of clent And then this place
was sone known / by cause of the miracle that was showed by the white cow /
and when tharchebisshop with other bisshoppis and many other people came theder
and fond the place / anon they let dygge up the body / and took it up with
great solemnyte / And forth with sprang up in the same place where as the body
had leyn a fair well which is called Saint kenelmes well unto this day
where much people have been heled of diverse sekenes and maladyes / And when the
body was above therth / there fyl a stryf between them of worcettershyre and of
gloucetreshyre / who should have this body / And then a full good man that was
there among them yaf counseyl that all the people should lie down and sleep and
rest them for the wether was then right hoote / And which of the two shires
that god would should first awake / they to take this holy body and goo their
way / And all thepeple agreed thereto And leyde them down to sleep / And it
happed that thabbot of wynchecombe and all his men awoke first / And they took
up the holy body and bare it forth toward wynchecomb til they came upon an hylle
a mile fro the abbey And for hete and labor they were nygh deed for thurst /
And anon they prayed to god and to this holy saint to be their comfort / And
then the abbot pyght his croos in to therthe / and forth with sprang up there
a fair well whereof they drank and refresshed them much / And then took up
this holy body with great solempnyte / And the monks received it with
processyon solempnly and brought it in to thabbay with great reverence / Joy
and mirth And the bellys sowned and were ronge without man's hand / And then
the queen quendrede demanded what all this ryngyng mente / And they told her
how her brother kenelme was brought with processyon in to thabbay And that the
belles rongen with out man's help / And then she said in great scorn /
that is as true said she as both mine eyes fall upon this book / and anon
both her eyes fell out of her head upon the book / And yet it is seen on this
day / where they fylle upon the sauter she radde that same time / deus laudem /
and sone after she deyde wretchydly / and was cast out in to a foul mire / and
then after was this holy body of saint kenelme leyde in an honorable shryne
/ where as our lord shows daily many a miracle / To whom be given laud and
praysyng world with outen end Amen /

Thus ends the life of Saint Kenelme king and martyr
Here follows the glorious life and Passion of the blessed virgyne and martyr
Saint Margarete / And first of her name
Of Saint margarete
MArgarete is said of a precious ge^me or owche that is named a Margaryte /
Which gemme is white / lytyl and virtuous / So the blessed margarete was
white by vyrgynyte / lityl by humylyte / and virtuous by operacion of miracles
/ The virtu of this stone is said to be against effusyon of blood / against
passion of the heart / and to confortacyon of the spyrite / In like wise the
blessed margarete had virtue against shedyng of her blood by constance / For in
her martirdom she was most / constant / and also against the passion of the
heart / that is to say / temptacion of the devil / For she ouercam the devil
by victory / and to the confortacion of the spyrite by doctrine / ffor by her
doctrine she conforted much people and converted to the faith of christ /
Theophynus a learned man wrote the legende

THe holy seint margarete was of the cite of anthyoche daughter of theodosye
patryarke and prince of the ydolles of paynems / And she was delyuerd to a
norice for to be kept And when she came to parfyght age she was baptized /
wherefore she was in great hate of her fader / On a certain day when she was xv
year of age / and kept the sheep of her noryce with other maidens / The
provost olybryus passyd by the way where as she was / And considered in her so
great beauty and farines / that anon he bre^ned in her love and sent his
servants / and had them take her and bring her to him / For if she be free /
I shall take her to my wife / and if she be bond I shall make her my concubyn /
And when she was presented to fore him / he demanded her of her lynage / Name
and religyon And she answered that she was of noble lignage / and her name
margarete And christian in religyon / To whom the provost said / Two the first
things ben conuenyent to the / that is that thou art noble / and art called
margarete / which is most fair name / But the third apperteyneth no thing to
the / that so fair a maid and so noble should have a god crucified / To whom
she said / how know thou that crist was crucified / he answered by the books
of christian men / To whom margarete said / O what shame is it to you / when ye
read the pain of christ and the glory / And believe one thing and deny a
another / And she said and affermed him to be crucified by his will for our
redemption / and now lives ever in bliss and then the provost being wroth
commanded her to be put in prison / And the next day following commanded that
she should be brought to him and then said to her / O good maid have pity on
thy beauty / And worship our gods / that thou may be well / To whom she
said / I worship him that makes the earth to tremble whom the sea dredeth / and
the wyndes and creatures obey / To whom the provost said but if thou consent
to me / I shall make thy body to be al to torn to whom margarete said / Christ
yaf him self over to the death for me / and I desire gladly to dye for christ /
Then the provost commanded her to be hanged in an instrument to tormente the
people / and to be cruelly first beten with rods / and with iron combs to
rende and draw her flessh to the bones in so much that the blood ran about
out of her body / like as a streme renneth out of a fresshe spryngyng well /
they that were there wept and said / O margarete verily we ben sorry for the /
which see thy body so foul and cruelly torn and rent / O how thy most beauty
have thou lost for thyn incrudelyte and mysbyleue / Now believe and thou shall
live / then said she to them / O evil counselors depart ye and goo fro me
/ This cruel torment of my flesh / is sauaco^n of my soul / then she said
to the provost / Thou shameless hound and insaciable lion thou have power over
my flesh / but christ reseruyth my soul / The provost couerd his face with
his mantel / For he might not see so much effucion of blood / and then
commanded that she should be taken down / and to shette her fast in prison /
and there was seen a merueylous brightness in the prison of the kepars / And
whiles she was in prison she prayed our lord that the fend that had fought
with her / he would vysible show him unto her / And then appyered an horrible
dragon and assailed her and would have devoured her / but she made the sign of
the cross / And anon he vanysshyd away / And in another place it is said that
he swolowed her in to his belly she making the sign of the cross / And the
belly brake a sondre and so issued out all hool and found / this swolowyng and
brekyng of the belly of the dragon is said that it is apocryfum / After this the
devil appiered to her in lykenes of a man for to deceive her / And when she
saw him / she went to prayer / and after aroos and the fend came to her and
took her by the hond / and said / It suffyseth to the that thou have don / But
now cesse as to my person / She caught him by the head / and threw him to the
ground / and set her right foot on his neck saying / lie still thou fend
under the feet of a woman / The devil then cried / O blessid margarete I am
ouercomen / if a young man had ouercomen me I had not retchyd / But alas I am
ouercomen of a tender virgyne / wherefore I make the more sorrow For thy fader
and mother have been my good friends / She then constrained him to tell / why
he came to her / And he answered / that he came / to her to counseylle her for to
obbeye the desire and request of the prouoste / Then she constrained him to
say wherefore he tempted so much and so often christian people To whom he answered
that naturally he hated virtuous men / and though we be often put abacke from
hem / yet our desire is much to exclude hem from the felicite that they fill
fro / for we may never obtain ne recover our bliss that we have lost / And
she then demanded what he was / and he answered / I am named veltis / one of
them whom Salamon closid in a vessel of brass / And after his death it happed
that they of babylon fond this vessel / And supposed to have founden great
tresour therein / and brake the vessel / and then a great multitude of us
deuellis flewe out and filled full the air always awaytyng and espyeng where we
may assail rightful men / And when he had said thus / she took of her foot
and said to him flee hens thou wretchid fend / and anon therthe opened / and
the fend sanke in / Then she was sure / For when she had overcome the
master / She myhht lightly ouercom the mynystre Then the next day following
when all the people was assembled / she was presented tofore the Judge / And she
not doing sacrefyse to their falls gods / was cast in to the fire / and her
body broyled with brennyng brondes in such wise that the people merueylled that
so tender a maid might suffer so many tormentis / And after that they put her
in a great vessel full of water fast bounden that by chaungyng of the tormentis
/ the sorrow and felyng of the pain should be the more / but suddenly the earth
trembled / and the air was hydous / and the blyssyd virgyne with out any hurt
issued out of the water saying to our lord / I beseech the my lord that this
water may be to me the font of baptysme in to ever lastyng life / And anon
there was herd great thondre / and a douue descended from heaven and set a
golden crown on her head / Then vM men byleued in our lord / and for crystes
love they al were byheded by the commandment of the provost Olybryus that time
in campolymeth the cite of Aurelya / Then Olybryus seeing the faith of the
holy margarete Inmeuable / And also feryng that other should be converted to the
christian faith by her gaf sentence and commanded that she should be byheded
Then she prayed to one malcus that should behede her that she might have space
to pray / And that gotten she prayed to our lord seyeng / ffader almighty / I
yield to the thankynges that thou have suffered me to come to this glory
besechyng to pardonne them that pursiewe me / And I beseech the good lord that
of thy haboundant grace thou wylt grant unto all them that write my passion /
read it / or here and to them that remember me that they may deserve to have
plain remyssyon and forgyfnes of all their sins / And also good lord if any
woman with child traueylyng in any place call on me / that thou wylt keep her
fro peril / and that the child may be delyuerd fro her belly without any hurt of
his membrys / And when she had fynysshed her prayer there was a voys herd fro
heaven / saying that her prayers were herd and granted / And that the yates of
heaven were opene and abode for her / and bad her come in to the contreye of
ever lastyng rest / then she thankyng our lord aroos up and badde the
hangman accomplysshe the commandment of the provost / To whom the hangman
said / God forbede that I should slay the vyrgyn of christ / to whom she said if
thou do it not thou may have no part with me / Then he being aferde and
tremblyng smote of her head / and he falling down at her fete gaf up the ghoost
/ Then Theofynus took up the holy body / and bare it in to antyoche and
buried it in the house of a noble woman and wydowe named sinclecia And thus this
blessed and holy virgyne saint margarete suffered death and received the crown
of martirdom / the xiij kalendes of auguste as is founden in her storye / and
it is read in an other place that it was the iij ydus of Iuyll / Of this
virgyne writes an holy man and says / The holy and blessed margarete was full
of the dread of god / sad stable and worshipful in religyon / arrayed with
compunctyon / laudable in honest and synguler in patience / and nothing was
founden in her contrary to christian relygyon / hateful to her fader / and by
loved or our lord Ih^u Christ / then late us remember this holy virgyne that
she pray for us in our needs etc^

Here ends the life of Saint Margarete
Here follows of Seint prayede virgyne /
SAint prayede was suster of saint potenciane / which were susters of the
seyntes Nonati and thymothe / which were informed in the faith of thappostles
/ And when the cruel persecucion was of many christian men and were martred and
sleyne they buried the bodies of the holy martirs / and gaf all their goods
and facultees to pour people for gods love / and at last they slept in our
lord and deyde about the year of our lord Clx under Mark Antonye the provost

Here follows the life of saint Marye magdalene / And first of her name /
MArie is as much to say as bitter / or a lyghter / or lyghted by this ben
vnderstonden three things that been three the best parts that she chaas / That
is to say / part of penance / part of contemplacion within forth / And part
of heavenly glory / and of this treble party is understood that is said by
our lord Marye has chosen the best part / which shall not be taken fro her /
The first part shall not be taken from her by cause of the end which is the
folownyg of bles sydnes / The second by cause of contynuaunce / ffor the
contynuaunce of her life is co^tynued with the contemplacion of her contrary /
The third by reason of perdurablenes / And for as much as she chafe the best
part of penance / she is said a bitter see / ffor therein she had much
bitterness / And that appiered in that she wept so many teres that she weshe
therwyth the feet of our lord And for so much as she chaas the part of
contemplacion wythinforth she is a lyghtar / ffor there she took so largely /
that she spradde it habundantly She took the light there / with which
afterward she enlumyned other / And in that she chaas the best part of the
heavenly glory / she is said the light For then she was enlumyned of
parfyght knowledge in thought and with the light in clernes in body / magdalene
is as much to say as abydyng culpable / Or magdalene is Interpreted closed or
shette / or not to be ouercomen Or full of magnyficence / by which is showed
what she was to fore her conversion / and what in her conversion / and what
after her conversion / For to fore her conversion she was abydyng gylty by
oblygacion to ever lastyng pain / In the conuercion she was garnysshyd by
armor of penance / She was in the best wise garnysshed with penance / For as
many delyces as she had in her / So many sacryfyses were founden in her / And
after her conversion she was praised by over haboundaunce of grace / For where
as sin habounded / grace over habounded and was more etc^

Of marye Magdalene
MArie Magdalene had her sur name of Magdalo a castle and was born of right
noble lygnage and parentis which were descended of the lygnage of kings / And
her fader was named Sirus / and her mother Eucharye / She with her brother lazare
/ and her suster Martha posseded the castle of magdalo / which is two mile fro
nazareth / and bethanye the castle which is nygh to Jerusalem / and also a
great part of Jerusalem / which all these things they departed among them /
In such wise that marye had the castle magdalo / Whereof she had her name
magdalene / And lazare had the part of the cite of Jerusalem / and martha had
to her part bethanye / And when Marye gaf her self to all delyces of the body
/ And lazare intended all to knyghthod martha which was wise governed nobly
her brothers part / and also her susters / and also her owen / and admynestred
to knights / And her servants and to pouer men such necessytes as them
neded / Neuerthe^^s after thascencion of our lord they sold all these things
and brought the valwe thereof and leyde it at the feet of ye appostlys / Then
when magdalene habounded in rychesses / And by cause delight is felawe to
rychesses and haboundaunce of things / and for so much as she shone in beauty
greatly and in rychesses so much the more she submysed her body to delight / and
therefore she bost her right name / and was called customably a sinner / and
when our lord Ih^u christ preached there and in other places / She was enspyred
with the holy ghoost / And went in to the house of Simon leprous where as our
lord dyned / Then she durst not by cause she was a sinner appear tofore the
Just and good people / but remained behind at feet of our lord / and wesshe
his feet with the teres of her eyes / and dried them with the here of her head
/ and enoynted hem with precious oynement / For thenabytantes of that regyon
used baynes and oynementes for the over great brennyng and heet of the son /
And by cause that Simon the pharysee thought in him self / that if our lord had been a very prophet / he would not have suffered a synful woman to have touched
him / Then our lord repreued him of his presumpsion / and foryaf the woman
all her sins / And this is she that same marie magdalene to whom our lord
gaf so many great yeftes / And showed so great signs of love / that he took
from her seven deuyls / he enbraced her all in his love / and made her right
famylyer with him / he would that she should be his hostess / And his procuresse
in his Journey / he often times excused her swetely / For he excused her against
the pharyse which said that she was not clean / and unto her suster that
said that she was idle / and unto Judas said that she was a wastresse of good
/ and when he saw her weep / he could not wythholde his teres / And for the
love of her he raised lazare which had be four days deed / and heled her
suster fro the flux of blood which had holden her seven year / And by the
merits of her he made marcelle chambriere of her suster martha to say that
sweet word / blessed be the womb that bare the / and the pappes that gaf the
souke / but after saint ambrose it was martha that said so / And this was her
chambriere / This marie magdalene said it is she that wesshe the feet of our
lord and dried them with the here of her head / and enoynted them with
precious oynement / and did solemn penance in the time of grace / And was
the first that chaas the best part which was at the feet of our lord / an
herd his prechyng / which enoynted his head / and at his passion was nygh
unto the cross / which made ready oynementis / and would enoynt his body and
would not depart fro the monumente / when his descyples departed / To whom
Ihesu christ appyered first after his resurectione / and was felawe to the
appostlys / and made of our lord appostolesse of thappostles / Then after
thascencion of our lord the xiiij year fro his passion / long after that the
Jews had sleyn saint Stephen / and had cast out the other dyscyples out of
the Iewery which went in to diverse contrayes and preched the word of god There
was that time with thappostles saint maxyme which was one of the lxxij
dyscyples of our lord to whom the blessed marie magdalene was commysed by saint
peter / and then when the descyples were departed / Saint maxyme / marye
magdalene / and lazar her brother martha her suster Marcelle chaumberer of
martha / and saint cedonye which was born blind and after enlumyned of our
lord / all these to gydre and many other christian men were taken of the
mescreauntes and put in to a ship in the sea without any takyl or rother /
for to be drowned / but by the puruyaunce of almighty god they came al to
marcelle / where as none would receive them to be lodged / they duellyd and
abode under a porche to fore a temple of the people of that contray And when the
blessed marie magdalene saw the people assembled at this temple for to do
sacrefyse to thydollis / she aroos up peasibly with a glad visage a dyscrete
tongue and well spekyng / And began to preche the faith and law of Ihesu christ
/ and withdrewe them fro the worshippyng of thydollis / Then were they
admerueylled of the beauty of the reason / and of the fair spekyng of her / And
it was no merueylle that the mouth that had kyssed the feet of our lord so
deboneyrly and so goodly should be enspyred with the word of god more than the
other / And after that it happed that the prince of the prouynce and his wife
made sacrefise to thydollis for to have a child / And marie magdalene prechid
to them Ih^u christ / And forbade them tho sacrefyses And after that a lytil
while marie Magdalene apperyd in vysion to that lady saying / wherefore have thou
so much richesse / and suffrest the pour people of our lord to deye for hungre
and for cold / And she doubted and was aferd to show this vysion to her lord
And then the second night she appeared to her again and said in like wise and
adiousted thereto menaces / if she warned not her husbond for to comfort the
pour and nedy / And yet she said nothing thereof to her husbond / And then
she appeared to her the third night when it was derke and to her husbond also
with a frownyng and angri visage like fire like as all the house had brennyd /
And said thou tyrant and membre of thy fader the devil with that serpent thy
wife that will not say to the my words / thou restest now enemy of the cross /
which have filled thy belly by glotonye with diverse manner of metes and suffrest
to perisshe for hungre the holy Seyntes of our lord / Lie thou not in a
paleys wrapped with clothes of sylke / And thou see hem without herberough
descomforted / And ghost forth and take no regard to them / Thou shall not
escape so ne depart without punysshement thou tyrant and felon because thou
have so long tarried / And when marie magdalene had said thus / she departed
away Then the lady awoke and sighed / And the husbond syghed strongly also
for the same cause and trembled / And then she said sir have thou seen the
sweuen that I have seen / I have seen said he that I am greatly amerueylled of /
And am sore afferde what we shall do / And his wife said It is more
prouffytable for us to obey her / Then to run in to the ire of her god whom
she prechyth /

For which cause they received them in to theyer house and mynystred to them
all that was necessary and nedeful to them / Then as Marie magdelene
preached on a time / The said prince said to her / wenest thou that thou may
defend the law that thou prechest / And she answered / Certainly I am ready to
defend it / as she that is confermed every day by miracles / and by the
predycacion of our master saint peter / which now sits in the sea at rome
/ To whom then the prince said / I and my wife ben ready to obey the in all
things / if thou may get of thy god whom thou prechest that we might have a
child / And then marie magdalene said that it should not be left therefore /
And then prayed unto our lord that he would vouchesauf of his grace to give to
them a sone / And our lord herd her prayers / And the lady conceived Then her
husbond would goo to saint peter for to wit if it were true that marie
magdalene had preached of Ihesu christ / Then his wife said to him / What will
ye do sir / wene ye to goo with out me / nay when thou shall depart I shall
depart with the / and when thou shall return again I shall return / and when
thou shall rest and tarry I shall rest and tarry / To whom her husbond answered and
said / dame it shall not be so / For thou art great and the perils of the sea ben without nombre / thou myghtest lyghtely perysshe / thou shall abide at
home and take heed to our posessyons / And this lady for no thing would not
change her put poos / But fyl down on her knees at his feet sore weeping
requyryng him to take her with him / And so at last he consented and
granted her request / then marie magdalene set the sign of the cross on
their sholdres to the end that the fend should not enpesshe ne let them in
thayer Journey / Then charged they a ship habundantly of all that was
necessary to them / And left all their things in the keeping of marie
magdalene / And went forth on their pilgrymage / And when they had made their
course and sailed a day and a night / there arros a great tempest and orage / And
the wind encresed and grew over hidouse in such^ wise that this lady which
was great and nygh the time of her chyldyng began to wex feeble and had great
anguysshes for the great wawes and troublyng of the sea / and sone after bygan
to traueyle and was delyuerd of a fair sone by accasyon of the storm and
tempest / And in her chyldyng deyed / and when the child was born he cried for
to have comfort of the tetes of his mother / and made a pyteous noise / Alas
what s^rowe was this to the fader / to have a sone born which was cause of the
death of his mother / And he might not live / for there was none to norisshe him /
Alas what shall this pilgrim do / that sceth his wife deed / and his sone cryeng
after the breast of his mother / And the pilgrim wept strongly and said / Alas
caytyf alas what shall I do / I desired to have asone / and I have lost both
the mother and the sone / and the maro^ners then said / this deed body must be
cast in to the sea / or ellis we al shall perysshe / for as long as she shall
abide with us / this tempest shall not cesse / And when they had taken the body
for to cast it in to the sea / the husbond said abide and suffer a litil /
and if he will not spare to me my wife / yet at lest spare the lityl child
that cries / I pray you to tarry a while for to know if the mother be a swowne
of the pain / and that she might reuyue / and whiles he thus spacke to them
the shypmen espied a montayn not fer fro the ship / And then they said that
it was best to set the ship toward the land and to burye it there and so to
save it fro deuouryng of the fysshes of the sea / and the good man did so much
with the maronners / what for prayers and for money that / they brought the
body to the montayn / and when they should have dygged / for to make a pytte to
lay the body in / they fond it so hard a Roche that they might not enter for
hardness of the stone / and they left the body theer lyeng and couerd it with a
mantel / and the fader leyde his lityl sone at breast of the deed mother / and
said weeping / O marie magdalene why came thou to marsele to my great loss
and evil adventure why have I at thyn Instau^ce entreprysed this Journey / have
thou required of god that my wife should conceive and should deye at the chyldyng
of her sone / for now it behooves that the child that she has conceived and
born perysshe because it has no norice / This have I had by thy prayer / and
to the I command them to whom I have commendyd all my goods / And also I
commend to thy god if he be mighty that he remember the soul of the mother /
That he by thy prayer have pity on the child that he perysshe not / Then
couerd he the body all about with the mantel and the child also / And then
returned to the ship / And held forth his Journey / And when he came to Seint
peter / saint peter came against him / And when he saw the sign of the cross
upon his sholdre / He demanded him what he was / and wherefore he came / and he
told to him all by order / To whom peter said / pees be to the / thou art well
com / and have byleued good counseyle And be thou not heavy / If thy wife sleep /
And the lytil child rest with her For our lord is almighty for to give to whom
he will / and to take away that he has given / and to restablisshe and give
again that he has taken / And to torn all heaviness and weeping in to Joy
Then Peter ladde him in to Iherusalem and showed to him all the places where
Ih^u christ preached and did miracles / and the place where he suffered death / And
where he ascended in to heaven / And when he was well informed of Saint Peter in
the faith / And that two year were passyd sith he departed fro marselle / He
took his ship fort return again in to his contraye / and as they sailed by
the sea / they came by the ordinance of god by the roche where the body of his
wife was left and his sone / Then by prayers and yeftes he did so much that
they aryued thereon / And the lytil child whom marie magdelene had kept went
often sythes to the sea side / and like small children took small stones and
threw them in to the sea / And when they came they saw the lytil child playeng
with stones on the sea side / as he was wont to do / and then they merueyled
much what he was / And when the child saw them / which never had seen people
tofore was aferde and ran secretly to his moders breast and hyde him under
the mantel / And then the fader of the child went for to see more appertly /
And took of the mantel / And fond the child which was right feyr sukyng his
moders breast / Then he took the child in his arms and said / O blessed
marie magdalene I were w^l happy and blessed if my wife were now alive / and
might live and come again with me in to my contreye / I know verily and believe
without doubt / that thou that have given to me my sone / and have fed and
kept him ij year in this roche / May well restablisshe his mother to her first
health / And with these words the woman respired and took life and said like as
she had been awaked out of her sleep / O blessed marie magdalene / thou art of
great merit and gloriouse / For in the pains of my delyueraunce thou were my
mydwyf / And in all my necessytes thou have accomplysshid to me the service of a
chaumberer / And when her husbond herd that thing / he admerueylled much and
said / lyuyst thou my right dear and best beloved wife To whom she said / ye
certainly I live and am now first come fro the pylgrimage / fro whens thou art
come / And all in like wise as saint peter ladde the in Iherusalem / And
showed to the all the places where our lord suffered death / was luryed / And
ascended to heaven / And many other places I was with you with marye magdalene /
which ladde and accompanied me / And showed to me all the places which I well
remember and have in in mind / And there recounted to him all the places and
the miracles that her husbond had seen / And never failed of one article ne
went out of the way fro the sooth / And then the good pilgrim received his
wife and his child / And went to ship And sone after they came to the port of
marselle / And they fond the blessed marie magdalene prechyng with her
desciples / And then they knelyd down to her feet / And recounted to her all
that had happened to them And received baptism of Saint maxymyn / And then
they destroyed all the temples of thydolles in the cite of marse^le / And made
chirches of Ih^u christ / And with one accord they chaas the blessed Saint
lazare for to be bishop of that cite / And afterward they came to the cite of
Ays / And by great miracles and prechyng they brought the people there to the
faith of Ihesu christ / and there saint maxymyn was ordained to be bishop /

In this mean while the blessed marie magdalene desirous of souerayn
contemplacion / sought a right sharp deserte / and took a place which was
ordained by thangele of god / and abode there by the space of xxx year without
knowleche of any body / In which place she had no comfort of rennyng water /
ne solace of trees ne of herbs / And that was because our redemer did do show
it openly / That he had ordained for her refection celestial / and no bodily
metes / And every day at every hour canonycal she was lift up in thayer of
thangellis / And herd the glorious song of the heavenly companyes with her
bodily ^eres / Of which she was fed and filled with right sweet metes / and
then was brought again by thangellis unto her propre place / in such wise as
she had no need of corporal norisshyng / It happed that a priest which desired
to lead a solytarye life took a Celle for him self a twelve forlonge fro the
place of marie Magdalene /

On a day our lord opened the eyes of that priest / and saw with his bodyly
eyes in what manner the Angels descended in to the place where the blessed
magdalene dwelled / and how they left her in to thayer / and after by the space
of an hour brought her again with dyuyne praysynges to ye same place / and
then the priest desired greatly to know the truth of this merueyllous
vision / and made his prayers to almighty god / and went with great devotion
unto the place / and when he approached nygh to it to a stones cast / His thyes
began to swelle and wex feeble / and his entrayles began within him to lack
breath and syghe for fere and as soon as he returned he had his thyes al hool /
and ready for to goo / And when he enforced him to goo to the place / al his
body was in langour and might not meue / and then he understood that it was a
secret celestial place where no man humayn might come / and then he called
the name of Ih^u and said / I conjure the by our lord / that if thou be a man
or other creature reasonable that dwellist in this cave / that thou answer me /
and tell me the troth of the / And when he had said this three times / the
blessed marie magdalene ansuerd / Come more nere / and thou shall know that
thou desire / and then he came tremblyng unto the halt way and she said to
him / Remembrest thou not of the gospel of marie magdalene the renommed synful
woman which wesshe the feet of our savior with her teeris / and dried them
with the here of her head / and deserved to have foryeuenes of her sins / and
the preeste said to her I remember it well that is more than xxx year that holy
church bileueth and confessith that it was don and then she said I am she
that by the space of xxx year have been her without wittyng of any person / and
like as it was suffered to the yesterday to see me In like wise I am every day
lift up by the hands of thangellys in to thayer / and have deserved to here
with my bodily eeris the right sweet song of the company celestyal / And
because it is showed to me of our lord that I shall depart out of this world
/ Goo to Maxymyne / and say to him that the next day after the resurrection of
our lord in the same time / that he is acustomed to arise and goo to matyns
that he allone enter in to his oratorye and that by the mynysterye and service
of Angellys he shall find me there / And the priest herd the boys of her like /
as it had be the boys of an angelle but he saw nothing and then anon he went
to saint maxymyn and told to him all by order / Then saint maxymyn was
replenysshed of great Joy And thankyd greatly our lord / And on the said day
and hour as is aforesaid he entrid in to his oratorye / And saw the blessed
marie magdalene sta^dyng in the quyre or chore yet among thangellys that
brought her / and was lift up fro therthe the space of ij or iij cubyttis /
And prayeng to our lord she held up her hands / and when Saint maxymyn saw
her he was aferd to approach to her / And she returned to him and said / come
hither mine own fader and flee not thy daughter / And when he approached and came
to her / as it is read in the books of the said seint maxymyn For the
customable vision that she had of angellis every day / the chyere and visage of
her shone as clear as it had been the rays of the son / And then all the
clerks and the prestes a fore said were called / And marie magdalene received
the body and blood of our lord of the hands of the bishop with great
habundaunce of t^eres / and after she stratched her body tofore the altar /
And her right blessed soul departed fro the body and went to our lord / and
after it was departed there issued out of the body an odor so sweet smellyng
that it remained there by the space of senen dayees to al them that entrid in /
And the blessed maxymyn enoynted the body of her with diverse precious
oynementis / and buried it honorably / And after commanded that his body
should be buried by heers after his death /

Egesippus with other books of Josephus accorden enough with the said storye /
And Josephus says in his tratye that the blessed man magdalene / After the
ascencion of our lord for the brennyng love that she had to Ihesu Christ / And
for the grief and descomfort that she had for the absence of her master our
lord she would never see man / but after when she came in to the countray of Ays
/ She went in to deserte and dwelled there xxx year without knouyng of any man
or woman / And he says that every day at vij hours canonyques she was lift
in to thayer of the angellys / But he says that when the priest came to her /
He fond her enclosed in her celle / And she required of him a vestement / And
he delyuerd to her one / which she clothed and covered her with / And she went
with him to the church and received the commynyon / and then made her
prayers with Joined hands / and rested in pees In the time of charles the
great in the year of our lord vijClxxj Gerard duc of burgoyne might have no
child by his wife / wherefore he gaf largely alms to the pour people / and
founded many chirches and many monasteries / and when he had made thabbay of
uisiliacense / he and thabbot of the monasteri sent a monk with a good
reasonable felawshyp unto ays for to bring thither if they mygt of ye relics of
saint marie magdalene / and when the monk came to the said cite / he fond it
all destroyed of paynems / Then by adventure he fond the sepulcre / for the
writing upon the sepulcre of marble showed well that the blessed lady marie
magdalene rested and lay there / and thistory of her was merueyllously entayled
and coruen in the sepulcre / and then this monk opened it by night and took
the relyques / and bare them in to his lodgyng and that same night marie
magdalene apperyd to that monk saying / doubt the nothing make an end of thy
work / then he returned homward until he came half a mile fro the monastery
But he might in no wise remeue the relyques fro thens / til that thabbot and
monks came with prosessyon and received them honestly / And sone after the duc
had a child by his wife / There was a knight which had a custom every year to
goo a pilgrimage unto the body of seint marie magdalene which knight was
slain in battle And as his friends wept for him lyeng on the byere / they
said with sweet and devout quarelles / why she suffered her devout servant to
dye without confession and penance / Then suddenly he that was deed aroos
All they being sore abashed / And made one to call a priest to him / and
confessyd him with great devotion / And received the blessed sacrament And
then rested in peace / There was a ship charged with men and women that was
perisshed and all to brake / And there was among them a woman with child
which saw her self in peril to be drouned / And cried fast on marye magdalene
for socour and help making her auowe that if she might be saved by her merytes
and escape that peril if she had a sone she should give him to her
monasterye /

And anon as she had so auowed / A woman of honorable habyte and beauty
apperyd to her and took her by the chynne / and brought her to the ryuage all
sauf / And the other perysshed and were drowned / And after she was delyuerd
and had a sone and accomplisshed her auowe like as she had promised / Some say
that marie magdalene was wedded to Saint Ioh^n theuangefist when crist called
him fro the weddyng / and when he was called fro her she had thereof Indignaco^n
/ that her husbond was taken fro her / and went and gaf her self to all delight
but by cause it was not couenable that the calling of saint Ioh^n should be
occasion of her dampnaco^n / therefore our lord converted her mercifully to
penance and because he had taken fro her souerayn delight of the flesh / he
replenyshed her with souerayn delight spirituel to fore al other / that is the
love of god and it is said that he ennoblesshed saint Ioh^n to fore al other
with the swetnes of his famyliarite / by cause he had taken him fro the delight
aforsayd / there was a man which was blind on both his eyes / and did him to
be led to the monastery of the blessid marie magdalene for to visit her body
/ his leder said to him that he saw the church / And then the blind man
^scried and said with an hye voys / O blessed marye magdalene help me that I
may deserve ones to see thy church / And anon his eyes were opened and saw
clerly all things about him / There was another man that wrote his sins in
a cedule and leyde it under the couerture of the altar of marie magdalene
mekely prayeng her that she should get for him pardonne and foryeuenes / and a
while after he took the cedule again and fond all his sins effaced and
stryken out / Another man was holden in prison for debt of money in yrons /
And he called unto his help often times marye magdalene / And on a night a
fair woman apperid to him and brake all his yrons / and opened the door / and
commanded him to go his way / and when he saw him self loos he fled away
anon / There was a clerk of fflaundres named Stephen risen and mounted in so
great and desordonnate felonnye that he haunted all manner sins / And such
thing as aperteyned to his health he would not here Nevertheless he had great
devotion in the blessed marye magdalene and fasted her vygyle / And honored

song in lykenes of a white douue / Then late us pray to this blessed marye
Magdalene that she get us grace to don penance here for our sins / that
after this life we may come to her in ever lastyng bliss in heaven Amen

Thus ends the life of Seint marie Magdalene /
Here follows the life of seint Appollynare / And first the Interpretacion of
his name /
Appollynare is said of pollens that is shynyng and Ares that is virtue / That
is to say shynyng in virtues / Or it is said of appollo / which is as much
to say as merueyllous and naris / that is dyscressyon / as who says he was a
man of merueyllous descrecion / or he is said of / A / that is without and
polluo and ares / that is to say virtuous with out pollucion of vices /

Of Saint Appollynare
APpollynare was dysciple of saint Peter thappostle / and of him be was sent to
rauenne from rome / and there he heled the wife of the tribune and Judge of the
town / and baptized her with her husbond and household which thing was told
and showed to the provost / and anon he did do areste apppllynare and led him
to the temple of Iubyter for to do sacrefyse to him and he said to the prestes
of thydollys that the gold and silver that was set abouteethydollys had been
better to have be given to pour men / than to be yeuen to deuyls / And then
he was a non taken and beten sore with staves that he was left half deed / but
he was taken up of his dyscyples and brought in to the house of a wydowe / And
there was kept and refresshed vij months fro thens he came to the cite of
clacense And there he heled a noble man which was dombe / And as he entered in
to an hows there was a maid which had an unclean spyrite within her which
cryeng said goo from hens thou servant of god or I shall make the to be
bounden hondes and feet / and to be drawn out of the cite / whom anon
appollynar rebuked / and constrained the spyrite to goo out and depart fro the
maid / / Then when he had thus called the name of our lord upon the dombe
man and had so cured him / And delyuerd the maid of the wicked spyrite moo
than vC men byleued in our lord Ihesu christ / The paynems then beat him with
staves and for bad him that he should not nempne the name of Ihesu christ / he
then lyeng on therthe cried and saying that Ihesus was very god / Then they
made him to stand bare foot upon brennyng coals / And yet always he preched
constantly the law of Crist / and then they seeng that he would not cesse /
droof him out of the cite / That time rufus patricius duc of the cite of
raue^n^ had a daughter seek / and did do call appollynare to hele her / and
as soon as appollynare entrid in to the house his daughter deyde / to whom rufus
seyde would god thou had not entered in to my house / for the great gods ben
wroth therefore and would not hele my daughter what may thou do to her / to whom
Appollynare said be thou not aferd but promise to me yt if the maid arise thou
shall not for^ede her to follow her maker / which when he had promised he made
his prayer and anon the maid aroos / and knowleched the name of christ / and
was baptized with her mother and a great multitude of people / and she abode a
virgyne / and when Cezar herd hereof he wrote to the provost of the pretoyre
that he should make oppollynare to do sacrefyse or to put him in exyle The
provost then seeing that he would do no sacrefyse / commanded that he should
be beten with staves / and to be tormented on the galowes / where as he allway
most constantly preched the name of our lord / Then he commanded to cast
hot scaldyng water in his fresshe wounds / And he sore bounden with great
weyghte of iron should have be sent in to exyle / That seeing the christian and so
great felenye don to him were moeuyd in their courage / Ran upon the paynems
and of them slew more than two hundred / And when the provost saw that he hid
him self / And commanded appollynare in to a strayte and hard prison / And
after bond him sore with cheynes / and set him in a ship with three clerks
following him and so sent him forth in exyle / where only he with two clerks
and two knights escaped the peril of the tempest / And tho knights he
baptized / After this he returned again to rauenne / And was taken of the
Paynems / And ladde to the temple of Iubyter / Whose symulacre when he saw / he
cursed it / And suddenly it fyl down / And when the bysshoppes saw that they
presented him to Thauro the Judge / whose sone which was blind Saint Appollynare
made to see /

And when the Judge saw that / He byleued on him / And made him to dwell four
year with him in his hows / After this when the bishops had accused him to
vaspasian / Vaspasian commanded who someuer did any wrong to the gods / He
should do satisfaction / Or to be pryued frothe cite / It is not ryghtful said
he that we should avenge the gods / But they them self may avenge them of
their enemies if they be wroth / Then demostenes patricyus seeing that he
would do no sacrefise delyuerd him unto a Centuryon then being christian / by
whose prayer he went in to the street of lepres / And that he should there hyde
him from the wodnes of the paynems / But the people followed him and beat him
unto the death / where he abode and lived by the space after of vin days / And
preached to his dyscyples / And then yaf up his spyrite unto our lord and
deyed / and there was honowrably buried about the year of our lord lxx / under
vaspasian / of this martyr says saint ambrose in his preface / appollynare
most worthy bishop was sent fro pet^r prince of the appostles to rauenne / for
to show the name of Ih^u unto the paynems / who did merueyllous signs of
virtues to them that believe in Christ / And was al to rent and torn with wode
^etynges of the wicked paynems / And by cause the christian men should not doubt
/ He did and performed merueyles like to thappostles / after his torments he
raised a maid from death to life / to blind men he yaf sight / and to a dombe
man he restored his speech / One that was vexyd with a devil he delyuerd / He
clensyd a lepre / he heled the members broken with a pestelence sekenes of
another / The symylacre of the god Iubyter with the temple he ouerthrewe / O
most worthy bishop of merueyllous praysyng thou deseruedest the power and
dygnyte of thappostle / O most strong champyon of our lord which in thyn old
age constantly prechest our lord Ih^u christ redemer of the world /

Thus ends the life of Saint Appollynare /
Here follows the life of saint Cristyne / And first the interpretacion of her
name /
CRistyne is as much to say / as enoynted with crisme / She had sothly the
bame of good odor and sauoure in conversation / And oil of devotion in mind
/ and also the benedyction of grace /

CRistyne was born in tire in Italye / and was comen of Noble kynrede of fader
and mother / And by cause of her beauty her fader enclosed her in a certain tour
with xij chamberers to serve and awayte on her And ordained there with her
gods of silver and of gold / and because of her great beauty she was desired
of many noble men for to have wedded her / but her fader in no wise would give
her to no man / but would have her continue in her virgynyte to do worship and
sacrefyse to the gods / But she being enspired of the holy ghoost abhor^ed
the sacrefyse of thydolles / And thencence that was delyuerd to her to do
sacrefise with / she hid it in a wyndowe / and when her fader came the maidens
and chamberers said to him / Thy daughter despyseth to offer to our gods /
And says that she is christian / Then her fader provoked her with sweet and
fair words for to do sacrefyse to their gods / To whom she said / Call
not me thy daughter / but this to whom sacrefyse belongs / I will not offer to
no deed gods / but to god of heaven I offer sacrefyse of land and preysyng /
then said her fader to her / O my douyhter / thou ought not to offer to
one god lest the other be wroth to the / to whom she said thou have said well
not knowing the truth / I offer truly sacrefyse / to the fader and to the
sone / and to the holy ghoost / then said the fader if thou worshyppest three
/ whi will thou not adoure the other / To whom she said / They three be but one
god / After this Crystyne brake all the gods / and the gold and silver she
gaf to pour people / her fader then came again for to worship his gods /
and he not fyndyng them demanded of the maidens / what crystyn had don to them
And when he had knowleche what she had don / commanded her to be despoyled /
and to be beten with xij men unto the time that they began to fail and were so
weary that they might no more then crystyn said to her fader / O thou that
without honor / and with shame art abhomynable to god / For they that beat me
fail and be faint / require thy gods that they give to them strength if they
may / Then be did do bind her with cheynes of iron and did do set her in
prison / and when her mother herd that / she rent her clothes and came to the
prison / and fill down at her daughters feet and said / my daughter Crystyn the
light of mine eyes have pity on me / To whom she said / why call thou me thy
daughter wotest thou not well that I have the name of my god / And when she
might nothing make her to torn fro her faith She returned to her husbond / and
told to him what she had ansuerd to her then the fader commanded that she
should be brought to fore him in Judgment / And said to her do sacrefyse to our
gods or ^llys thou shall suffer many torments / and shall no more be called
my daughter / To whom she said Thou have gotten to me great grace / For now thou
call not me daughter of ye devil / what is born of the devil is a devil thou
art the sone of the same sathanas then he commanded that her flesh should
be all to rent and drawn with hokes of iron / and her tender membris be all
to broken and departed fro other crystyne then took part of her flessh and
threw it in to the vysage of her fader saying / O tyrant take the flessh
which thou have gotten and ete it / Then her fader set her upon a whele and
put under fire and oil / And the flame issued out so great that it slew and
brent vC men / The fader ascrybed al this work to nygromancy and said she had
don that by wytchecraft / and commanded her again to prison / and badde her
servants when it was night that they should bind a great stone to her neck /
and cast her in to the sea / and anon as they had so don / Angellys took her
up and Christ descended / and baptized her in the sea saying / I baptyse the in
the name of god my fader / and in me Ih^u christ his sone / and in the holy
ghoost / And committed her to mychel the arkangelle which led her to the
land / and when her fader herd yt she was come again to land / he smote his
forhede and said to her By what with craft do thou these things / that in
the sea thou excersysest thy cursed werkys / To whom crystyne said / O thou
fool and unhappy I have received this grace of crist Then he commanded that
she should be put in prison and on the morn to be byheded / And that same night
vrbane her fader was founded deed / Then after him followed and succeeded a
wicked and evil Judge named dyon which did do make a tubbe of iron And did do
put theryn pitche oil and rosyn / and set them a fire / And when it was ready
he made Crystyne to be cast therein and made four men meue the tubbe that she
should be the sonner consumed / Then crystyne praised god and thanked him that
she was so renewed and rocked as a child in a cradle / then the Judge being
wroth made her head to be shaven / And naked to be led through the cite unto
the temple of Appollyn / whom she commanded to overthrow / And anon fill down
in to pouldre / And when the Judge herd thereof / he deyde and gaf up his
speryte / After him Iulyanus succeeded which did do set afyre a great forneys
and crystyne to be cast therein / wheryn she abode five days with angellys
syngyng and walkyng unhurt and after issued out thereof saufly with out harm /
and when Iulyanus herd hereof he said that she did allle this by art magyke and
wytchecraft / and did do be put to her two addres / two serpents / and two
aspydes / the serpents lycked her feet / the two aspydes heng at her breasts
and did her none harm and the ij addres wond them about her neck and licked
up her sweet / Iulyanus then said to his enchaunteour art not thou an
enchauntour / meue the bestes / and when he began to meue them they made
assault to him and slew him forth with / Then cristyne commanded the
serpents / that they should goo to a deserte place / And she raised
thenchaunter that was deed to life a gayn / then Iulyanus commanded that her
breasts should be cut of / out of whom flowed milk with blood / Then he
made ber tongue to be cut out of her head / But Crystyne lost not her speech
for cuttyng out of her tongue But took it and threw it in the vysage of the
Judge / And smote out there with one of his eyes / Then was Iulyan wroth / And
made to shote at her And she was smeton with one arowe in to the side / And
with a another unto the heart / And she so smeton yielded up her soul unto god
and thus suffered martirdom about the year of our lord two hundred four score
and seven / her body was beryed in a castle bulsena between thold town and
viterbe / and tirus which was not far fro that castle which is now
destroyed /

Thus ends the life of Saint Cristyne /
Here begins the life of seint James the more And appostle and first of
thinterpretacion of his name /
THis James thappostle is said James the sone of zebedee / brother of Saint
Johan theuangelyst / And beonarges / that is the sone of thondre / And James
the more / he was said James sone of zebedee / not only in flesh but in
thexpocision of the name ffor zebedee is interpreted gyuyng or given and James
gaf him self to god by martirdom of death and he is given to us of god for a
specyalle patron / he is said James brother of Ioh^n not only by flesh /
but by semblaunce of manners / For they both were of one love / of one estudye
and of one will / They were of one love for to avenge our lord / For when the
samaritans would not receive Ih^u christ / James and Ioh^n said if it plese the
lord late fire descend fro heaven / and destroy them / they were of like
study for to learn for thise ij. were they that demanded of our lord of the
day of Judgment / and of other things to come And they axed that one of them
might sytte at right side of him / and that other on his lift side / he was
said the sone of thondre / by cause of the son of his predycacion for he
fered the evil and exyted the slouthful / and by the hyenes of his prechyng he
did merueyles in conuertyng them to the faith whereof bid says of saint Ioh^n
that he thondred so hye / that if he had thondred a little hyer / all the world
might not have comprysed him / He is said James the more like as that other
James is said the less / First by reason of his calling for he was first
called of Ih^u christ / secondly by reason of famyliarite / For Ihesu crist was
seen to have greter famyliarite with him than with the less James / like as it
apperyth at reysyng of the maid and at his holy transfyguracion / thyrdly by
reason of his passion / For among all thappostles he was the first that suffered
death / and he may be said more / by cause he was first called to be appostle /
so he was first called to the glory perdurable

Of Saint James the more and appostle /
James thappostle sone of zebedee prechid after thassenco^n of our lord in the
Iewerye and samarye and after he was sent in to spaygne for to sow there the
word of Ihesu christ / but when he was there he prouffyted but little / for he
had converted unto crystes law but ix discyples / of whom he left ij there for
to preche the word of god / and took the other vij with him and returned again
in to Iudee / Master Ioh^n beleth says that he converted there but one man
only / and when after he preched the word of god in Iudee / there was an
enchauntour named hermogenes with the pharseeis / which sent philette his
disciple to saint James / for to overcome him to fore all m^n / and to preue
his prechyng falls / but thappostle ouercam him tofore all men resonably / And
did many miracles tofore him / Phylete then returned to hermogenes / and
approved the doctrine of James to be true and recited to him his miracles and
said that he would be his discyple And desired and counseyllyd hermogenes in
like wise to be his dysciple / Then hermogenes was wroth / And by his craft
and enchauntementis he made phylete in such wise yt he might not moeue and
said / Now we shall see if thy James may save the / then phylete sent his
child to saint James and let him have knowleche hereof / Then saint James
sent to him his sudarye or keuerchyef and said / Say to him that our lord
redressyth them that been hurt / and unbinds them that been empesshyd / and
as soon as he said so and touched the sudarye he was vnbou^den and losed fro al
thenchauntyng of hermogenes / and aroos up and wen^ Joyfully to saint James /
then hermogenes was angry and called many deuylles and commanded them that
they bring to him saint James bounden and philete with him for to avenge him on
them / lest his dysciples after ward adresse them against him / Then when the
deuyls came toward saint James they cried howlyng in thaier saying James
thappostle of god have pite on us / For we brenne tofore our time comme / To
whom James said wherefore come ye to me / and they said hermogenes has sent us
to the and to phylete for to bring you to him / and thangele of god has bound
us with cheynes of fire and tormenteth us / And James said the angele of god
shall vnbynd you / And goo ye to him / and bring him to me bounden / but hurt
him not then they went and took hermogenes and bound his hondes / and
brought him so bounden to saint James / and they said to hermogenes / thou
have sent us thither where we were strongly tormented and grievously bounden /
And then said they to saint James / give to us power against him / that we may
avenge the wrongs and our enbracementis / And James said to them / lo here is
phylete to fore you why take ye him not / they answered we may not touch him /
ne as much as a flee that is in thy couche then said James to philete / to
the end that thou do good for evil / like as christ bad us vnbynd him / and
then hermogenes was all confused / And James said to him goo thy way freely
where thou wylt For it apperteyneth not to our discyplyne / that any be
converted against his will / And hermogenes said to him / I know well the ire of
the deuyllis / But if thou give to me some what of thyn that I may have with me
they shall slay me / then saint James gaf to him his staff / Then he went
and brought to thappostle al his books / of his false craft and enchauntyng for
to be brent / But saint James by cause that the odor of ye brennyng might do
eueyl or harm to some foolis he made them to be cast in to the sea / and after
he had cast his books in to the sea he returned / and holdyng his feet said O
thou delyuerer of souls receive me penytent / and him that has sustained till
now myssayeng of the / and then began he to be parfyght in the dread of god
our lord / so that many virtues were don by him afterward / and when the Jews
saw hermogenes converted they were all moeuyd of envy / and went unto Saint
James and blamed him by cause that he preached Ih^u christ crucified / And he
approved clerly the coming and the passion of our lord Ih^u christ in such wise
that many byleuyd in our lord / Abyathar which was bishop that year moeued
the people against him / And then they put a cord about his neck / And
brought him to herod agrippe / and when he was ladde for to be byheded by the
commandment of herod / A man having the palsy cried to him / And he gaf him
health / And said in the name of Ih^u crist for whom I am ladde to be by heded
arise thou and be al hool / And bless our lord thy maker / And anon he aroos
and was all hool / A Scrybe named Josias which put the cord about his neck
and drew him seeing this miracle / fyl down to his feet and demanded of him
forgyuenes / and that he might be cristened / and when a byathar saw that / he
made him to be taken / and said to him but if thou curse the name of Criste
thou shall be byheded with him / To whom Iosyas said / be thou acursed / and
acursed be al thy gods / And the name of our lord Ih^u criste be blessed
world withouten end / Then abyathar commanded to smite him on the mouth
with fistes / and sent a messager to herod / and gate consent that he should
be byheded with James / And when they should be byheded both / saint James
desired a pot full of water / of him that should smite of their hedes and
therwyth he baptized Josias / and then anon they were both byheded and
suffered martirdom / Saint James was byheded the viij kalendes of Aprille on our
lady day thanu^ciacion / and the viij kalendes of August he was translated to
compostelle And the thread kalendes of Ianyuer he was buried / For the making of
his sepulcre was fro august unto Ianyuer and therefore the church has
established that his feste shall be hallowed in the viij* kale^des / of august
where as is most couenable time and as master Ioh^n beleth says which made
this translacion dyligently / when the blessed saint James was byheded his
discyples took the body away by night for fere of the Jews / and brought it in
to a shipp^ / and committed unto the will of our lord the sepulture of it / and
went with all in to the ship without sail and rother And by the conduyte of
thangelle of our lord they arrived in galyce in the Royame of lupa / There was
in spaygne a queen which had to name and also by deseruyng of her life lupa
which is as much to say in englyssh as a she wulf / And then the discyples
of saint James took out his body and leyde it upon a great stone / And anon the
stone received the body in to it as it had be soft wax / and made to the body
a stone as it were a sepulcre Then the desciples went to lupa the queen and
said to her / our lord Ihesu christ has sent to the / The body of his dysciple
so that him that thou would not receive alive / thou shall receyu^ deed / and
then they recited to her the miracle by order how they were comen without any
gouernayle of the ship and required her place couenable for his holy
sepulture / and when the queen herd this / she sent them unto a right cruel man
by trycherye and by gyle as master beleth says / and some say it was to the
king of spaygne / For to have his consent of this matter / and he took them and
put them in prison / and when he was at dinner The angelle of our lord opened
the prison and let them escape away all free / And when he knew it he sent
hastily knights after for to take them ^^nd as thise knights passed to go
over a bridge / the bridge brake and ouerthrewe and they fyl in the water and
were drowned / And when he herd that he repented him and doubted for him self
and for his people / and sent after them prayeng them for to return / and that
he would do like as they would them self / and then they returned and
converted the people of that cite unto the faith of god / And when lupa the
queen herd this / she was much sorouful / and when they came again to her they
told to her thagrement of the king She anssuerd take the oxen that I have in
yonder mountaygne / and Join ye and yoke them to my carte or chariote And
bring ye then the body of your master / and bylde ye for him such a place
as ye will / and this she said to them in gyle and mockage / For she knew well
that there were non oxen but wyld bullis / and supposed that they should never
Join them to her charyot and if they were so Joined and yoked to the chariote
they would run hither and thither / and should break the chariot and throw down
the body and slay them But there is no wysdom against god / And then they that
knew nothing the evil courage of the queen / went upon the mountain and fond
there a dragon castyng fire at them / and ran on them / and they made the
sign of the cross / and he bracke on two pieces and then they made the
sign of the cross upon the bulls / and anon they were meke as lambs /
Then they took them and yoked them to the charyot / And took the body of
saint James with the stone that they had leyde it on and leyde it in the
chariot / and the wild bulls without gouernyng or dryuyng of any body drew it
forth unto the myddle of the paleys of the queen lupa / And when she saw this
/ She was abashed / and byleued and was crystened / And delyuerd to them all
that they demanded / and dedyed her paleys in to a church and endowed it
gretely / And after ended her life in good werkys / Bernard a man of the
bysshopriche of mutynense as Calyxte the pope says was taken and enchayned and
put in to a deep tour / and called always the blessed saint James / So that
saint James apperid to him and said come and follow me in to galyce / And
then his bonds brake / and saint James vanysshed away / And he went up in
to the hye tour and his bonds in his neck / and sprang down without hurtyng /
And it was well lx cubytis of heyght / And as bede says / There was a man that
had don a foul sin / of which the bishop doubted tassoyle him / and sent
him to saint James with a cedule in which the sin was wreton / and when he
had leyde the cedule upon the altar on the day of saint James he prayed saint
James that by his merytes his sin might be foryeuen and deffaced And after he
opened the cedule and fond the sin effaced and stricken out / Then he
thanked god and saint James / xxx men of loreyn went to gydre on pilgrimage to
saint James about the year of our lord a M lxiij And all made faith to other
that every man should abide and serve other in all estates that shall happen
by the way / exepte one that would not make none covenant / It happed that one
of them was seek / and his fela^^ abode and awayted on him xv days / and at
last they ^lle left him sauf he that promised not / which abode by him and
kept him at the foot of the mont seint Mychel-And when it drew to night the
seek man deyed / and when it was night / the man that was alive was sore af^rd
for the place which was solytary / and for the presence of the deed body / and
for the cruelte of the strange people / and for the derknes of the night that
came on / But anon saint James apperid to him in lyknes of a man on horse bak and
comforted him and said / give me that deed body tofore me / and lepe thou up
behynd me on my horse / And so they roode all that night xv day Journey that
they were on the morn to fore the son rysyng at mount Joy which is but half
a leeke fro saint James / There saint James left them both commaundyng him that
was alive that he should assemble the chanones of seint James for to burye this
pilgrim / And that he should say to his felawes by cause they had broken their
faith their pylgremage auayled them not And he did his commandment / and when
his felawes came they meruelled how he had so fast goon / and he told to them
all that saint James had said and don / And as calyste the pope reherceth
there was a man of al mayn and his sone went to saint James about the year of
our lord Miiij score and three / And came to toulouse for to be lodged / and
their host made them drunk / Then the host took / a cup of silver and put
it in their male / And on the morn when they were goon he followed after them as
theuis And bare them on hond that they had stolen / his cup / and said that
they should be punysshed if the cup were founden on them / And he fond it in
the male / and anon they were brought to Judgment / And then the sentence was
given / that all that they had should be given to the host / And that one of
them should be honged / And then the fader would have deyed for his sone / and
the sone for the fader / At last the sone was honged / And the fader went
forth weeping on his pylgremage to saint James / And came again xxxvj days after
/ And then went for to see his son and cried and wept / but the sone
which was hanged began to comfort and said to his fader / Right sweet fader
weep no more / For I was never so well at ease for the blessed saint James has
allway sustained and hold me up / and has fed me with swetnes of heaven And
when the fader herd him speak he ran anon to the cite / and did so much that
the people came / And his sone was taken down all hool as though he never had /
had harm / And the host was honged which had put the cup in to the male /
Hughe de sco^ victore rehersith that the devil apperid in lykenes of saint
James to a pilgrim And told to him many things of the unhappiness of the world
/ and said to him that he should be well blessed if he slew him self in thonour
of him / And anon he took a knyf and slew him self / and then the host in
whose house he was lodged was holden suspecte / And was sore aferde to be put
therefore to death / Then he that was deed reuyued again / and said that the
devil had caused to slay him self / and brought him in to great tormentis / and
saint James ran and brought him to fore the trone of the Judge / and where the
deuyls accused him / he gate that he should be restored to his life / There was a
young man of the countray of lions as hughe thabbot of cluyny witnesses that
was acustomed to go often to saint James / and the night tofore he should goo
thyderward he fyl in fornycacion / And the next day he went forth / On a night
it happed that the devil appiered to him in lykenes of saint James / And said
to him / know thou who I am / and he answered nay / and the devil said to
him I am James thappostle / whom thou have used to visyte every year / and I am
glad for thy devotion / But it is not long sith that thou in going out of thy
house fyllest in fornycaco^n and have presumed to come not confessyd thereof
wherefore thy pylgremage may neither plese god ne me / It apperteyneth not to do
so / For who that will come to me in pylgrimage / he must first show his sins
by con^rysion and by confession / and after by going on pylgremage punysshe
them and make satisfaccion / and this said / the devil vanyshed away / Then
this young man was in great anguysshe / and disposed him to return home again
to his house and confess him of his sins / and then to begin again his
Journey And then the devil apperid to him again in lyknes of thappostle / And
warnyd him in no wise to do so / But said to him / This sin may in no wise be
forgyuen / But if he cut of his membris genytores / But yet he should be more
blessed if he killed him self / and be a martyr for the name of him / And he
that same night when his felawes slepte took a knyf and cut of his genytoyres
/ and with the same knyf smote him self in to the belly / and his felawes awoke
/ and when they saw this thing they were sore aferde and anon fled away
lest that they should be taken as suspecte of thomycide / And after as they made
ready his pit to bury him in / he reuyued again / and then all they were
abashed and fled away / And he called them again / and told all that was
byfallen to him saying / when I at the suggestio^ of the devil had slain my
self / the deuyls took me and lad me toward rome / and anon saint James came
after us / and blamed strongly the deuyllis of their fallace / And when they
had long stryued to gyder Saint James constrayued them to com in to a medowe
where the blessed virgyne satte spekyng with many Seyntes And the blessid saint
James complained for me / and then she blamed strongly the deuyllis and
commanded that I should be restored again to my life / and then saint James
took me and rendered to me my life again like as ye see / and three days after
his wou^des were hool and there apperid nothing but the traces where the
wou^des were and then he reprised again his Journey / and fond his felawes /
and recited to them all this by order / And as Caliste the pope reherseth
there was a french man about the year of our lord a M and a C would eschew the
mortalite that was in ffraunce / and would visit saint James / and he took his
wife and children and went thither And when they came to pampelone his wife deyde /
and his host took fro him al his money / and his Iument upon which his
children were born / And this man that thus went all descomforted / and bare
his children on his sholdres / and led one after him was in great anguysshe
and sorrow / Then came a man to him upon an ass which had pytye on him / and
lent to him his ass for to bear his children / And when he came to saint James
and had done what he would and prayed / saint James apperyd to him / and
demanded if he knew him / And he said nay And saint James said to him / I am
James thappostle / which have lent to the mine ass / And yet I shall leave him
to the for to return / And I late the wete that thyn host is fallen fro a
soler and is deed / and thou shall have again all that he has taken fro the /
and when all this was don he returned Joyous with his children to his hows /
and as soon as his children were taken of fro the ass / it was not known where
it becam /

A merchant was deteyned of a tyrant / and all despoyled was wrong fully put
in prison / And he called much devoutly saint James in to his help / And
saint James appiered to him to fore them that kept him / and they awoke / and
he brought him unto the highest of the tour / and anon the tour bowed down so
low that the top was even with the ground / And he went out without lepyng
and unbound of his yrons / Then his kepers followed after but they had no
power to see him / Three knights of the dyocyse of lion went to saint James /
and that one was required of a pour woman / which for the love of saint James
to bear her sack upon his horse / and he bare it after he fond a man seek / and
set him on his horse / and took the burdon of the man and the sack of the
said woman and followed his horse a foot / but he was broken with the hete of the
son and with labor to goo a foot / that when he came to saint James in
galyce / he was strongly seek / And his felawes prayed iij days for the health
of his soul / which iij days he lay specheles / and his felawes abydyng his
death the fourth day / he syghed greatly and said / I thank god and saint James
for I am delyuerd by his merits / When I Would have don that Which ye Warned
and admonested me / But the deuyls came to me and strayned me so sore that I
might do no thing that apperteyned to the health of my soul / and I herd you
well but I might not answer / And then the blessid saint James came and
brought in his lift hond the sack of the Woman / and in the right hond the
burdon of the pour pilgrim that I helped by the Way / and held the burdon for
a spear / And the sack for a shylde and so assailed the deuyls as all angry /
and lift up the burdon and fered the deuyllis that they fled away / and thus
the blessed saint James has delyuerd me by his holy grace / And has rendered
to me my speech again Call me the priest for I may not be long in this life /
It is time to amend our trespaces toward our lord / And then he turned him
to one of his felawis / and said to him / Friend ride no more With thy lord for
certeynly he is dampened / and shall perisshe shortly by evil death / And
therefore leave his company / and then he deyed / And When he Was buried his ij
felawes knights returned / and that other said to his master this that he had
said to him / and he set not thereby / And had despyte to amend him / And
anon after he was smyton with a spear in battle and deyed / And as calyste the
pope says / that there was a man of vir^liac Went to seint James / And his
money failed him by the Way / And he had shame for to beg and ask alms /
and he leyed him to rest under a tree / and dremed that Saint James fed him /
And when he a woke he fond a loof baken under asshen at his head / And With
that loof he lived xv days till that he came again to his owen place / and ete
suffysauntly twyes a day of the same loof / And always on the morn he fond it
hool in his sachet / Also the same Caliste reherseth that a bourgeys of the
cite of barselone went to Saint James about the year of our lord MiC / and
required only that he should never be taken of any enemies / and as he returned
by Sysyle he was taken in the sea of sarasyns / and led often times to fayres
for to be sold / but always the chains with which he was bounden losed / and
when he had be sold xiiij times he was bounden with double cheynes / Then he
called saint James to his help / and saint James apperyd to him and said by
cause thou were in my church / and thou set nothing by the health of thy
soul / But demaundest only the delyueraunce of thy body / therefore thou have
fallen in this peril / but because that our lord is merciful / he has sent me
for to bye the / and anon his chains brake / and he beryng a part of the
chains passed by the contrays and castellys of the sarasyns and came home unto
his owen countraye in the sight of all men which were abashed of the miracle
/ For when any man Would have taken him / as soon as they saw the cheyne they
were aferd and fled / And when the lions and other bestes would have run on
him in the deserts where as he went / when they saw the cheyne they were
afferd that they fled away It happed that in the year MCCxxx and viij In a
castle named praat between Florence and pyscoye / A young man deceived of
symplesse by counseyle of an old man set fire in the corn of his tutour /
which had charge to keep him / by cause that he would usurp to him self his
heritage / Then he was taken and confessyd his trespass and was Iuged to be
drawn and brent / then he confessyd him and avowed to saint James / And when
he had be long drawn in his sherte upon a stony way / he was neither hurt in
his body ne in his sherte / Then he was bounden to a stake / and fagottis and
busshes were set about him and fire put thereto / which fire brent a two his
bonds / And he always called on saint James / and there was no hurt of
brennyng founden in his sherte nor in his body / and when they would have cast
him again in to the fire / he was taken away fro them by saint James thappostle
of god / to whom be given laud and praysyng /

Here follows of saint Cristophre / and first of his name
CHristofre to fore his baptesme was named reprobus / But afterward he was
named xpo^fer which is as much to say as beryng christ / of that / that he
bare christ in iiij manners / he bare him on his sholdres by conueyeng and ledyng
/ In his body / by making it lene / In mind by devotion / And in his mouth by
confession and predycacion /

Of Saint Christofre
CHristofre was of the lygnage of the Canances / And he was of a right great
stature And had a terryble and ferdful chore and countenance / And he was xij
cubytes of length / And as it is read in sum histories / that when he
served and dwelled with the king of cananees it came in his mind that he would
seche the grettest prince that was in the World / and him would he serve and
obey / And so far he went yt he came to a right great king of whom the
renomme generally was that he was the grettest of the world / and when the king
saw him he received him in to his seruyse / and made him to dwell in his
court / Upon a time a mynystral song to fore him a song / in which he named
often the devil / And the king which was a christian man when he herd him name
the devil / made anon the sign of the cross in his vysage / and when xpo^fer
saw that he had great merueyle what sign it was / and wherefore the king made
it / And he demanded of him And because the king would not say he said / if
thou tell me not I shall no longer dwell with the / and then the king told
to him saying / alleway when I here the devil named / I fere that he should have
power over me / and I garnysshe me with this sign / that he grieve ne anoye me
/ then xpo^fer said to him doubtest thou the devil / that he hurt the not
/ then is the devil more mighty and gretter than thou art / I am then
deceived of my hope and purpose / ffor I had supposed I had founden the most
mighty and the most grettest lord of ye world / but I command the to god /
for I will goo seche him for to be my lord and I his servant / and then
departed fro this king / And hasted him for to seche the devil / and as he went
by a great deserte / he saw a great company of knights of which a knight
cruel and horrible came to him and demanded whider he went and xpo^for ansuerd
to him and said / I goo seche the devil for to be my master / and he said I am
he that thou sechest / and then xpo^fer was glad and bond him self to be his
servant perpetuel and took him for his master and lord / and as they went to
gydre by a common way / they fond there a cross erecte and stondyng / and
anon as the devil saw the cross he was aferd and fled and left the right
way / and brought xpo^fer about by a sharp deserte / and after when they
were passyd the cross he brought him to the hye way that they had left / and
when xpo^fer saw that he merueylled and demanded whereof he doubted and had
left the hye and feyr way / and had goon so far about by so aspre deserte And
the devil would not tell to him in no wise / Then cristofer said to him if
thou wylt not tell me / I shall anon depart fro the and shall serve the no
more / wherefore the devil was constrained to tell him and said / there was a
man called christ which was hanged on the cross / and when I see his sign I
am sore aferd and sle fro hit where someuer I see it / To whom xpo^fer said
then he is gretter and more myghtier than thou / when thou art aferd of his
sign / and I see well that I have labored in vayn / when I have not fou^den
the gretest lord of the world / And I will serve the no longer / goo thy way
then for I will goo seche Ih^u Criste And when he had long sought and
demanded where he should find crist At last he came in to a great deserte to
an hermyte that dwelled there / and this hermyte preched to him of Ihesu crist
and informed him in the faith dylygently and said to him / This king whom thou
desire to serve / requires the seruyse that thou must often fast / And
xpo^fer said to him require of me sum other thing and I shall do it for that
which thou requyrest I may not do / And the hermyte said / thou must then
wake and make many prayers / And cristofer said to him I wot not what it is /
I may do no such thing / and then the hermyte said to him know thou
such a river in which many be perysshed and lost / to whom cristofer said / I
know it well / then said the heremyte by cause thou art noble and hye of
stature / and strong in thy membris thou shall be resident by that river / and
thou shall bear over al them that shall pass there which shall be a thing right
couenable to our lord Ih^u crist / whom you desire to serve / and I hope he
shall show him self to the / then said cristofer certes this seruyse may I
well do and I promise to him for to do it / then Went cristofer to this river
/ and made there his habitacle for him and for a great pool in his hand instead of a staf by Which he sustained him in the Water / And bare over al manner
of people without cessyng / and there he obode thus doing many days And in a
time as he slepte in his lodge he herd the voys of a child which called him
and said / xpo^fer come out / and bear me over / Then he awoke and Went out /
but he fond no man / And when he was again in his house / he herd the same voys
and he ran out and fond no body / The third time he was called and came theder
and fond a child beside the ryuage of the river / Which prayed him goodly to
bear him over the Water / And then xpo^fer lift up the child on his sholdres
and took his staff and entered in to the River for to pass / And the water of
the river aroos and swellyd more and more / And the child was heavy as leed /
And always as he went ferther / the water encresed and grew more / And the
child more and more wexyd heavy in so much that xpo^fre had great anguysse /
and was aferd / to be drowned And when he was escaped with great pain and
passyd the water / And set the child a ground / he said to the child /
Child thou have put me in great peril / thou Wayest all most as I had had
all the world upon me I might bear no greter burdon / And the child answered /
Crystofre merueyle the nothing / For thou have not only born all the world
upon the / But thou have born him that created and made all the world upon thy
sholdres / I am Ih^u christ the king / to Whom thou seruest in this work / And
because that thou know that I say to the truth / set thy staf in the
earth by thy house / and thou shall see to morn that it shall bear flowers and
fruit and anon he vanysshed from his eyes And then cristofre set his staf
in therthe / and when he aroos on the morn he fond his staf like a palmyer
beryng flowers leaves and dates / and then Cristofre went in to the cite of
lycye / and understood not their langage / Then he prayed our lord that he
might understand them / and so he did And as he was in this prayer / The Iuges
supposed that he had be a fool / And left him there / And then when cristofre
understood the langage / He couerd his visage and went to y^ place Where they
marterd christian men / and comforted them in our lord / and then the Iuges
smote him in the face / and xpo^fer said to them / If I were not christian I
should anon avenge mine Iniurye / And then Cristofre pyiched his rod in
therthe / And prayed to our lord that for to convert the people it might bear
flowers and fruit / and anon it did so / And then he converted viij thousand
men / and then the king sent two knights for to fetch him to the king / and
they fond him prayeng / And durst not tell to him so / And anon after the
king sent as many mo / And they anon set them down for to pray with him And
when xpo^fre aroos he said to them What seche ye / And when they saw him in
the vysage / they said to him / the king has sent us that we should led the
bounden unto him / And Cristofre said to them / if I would ye should not led me
to him bounden ne vnbounden / And they said to him if thou wylt goo thy way /
goo quyt where thou wylt /

And we shall say to he king / that we have not found the / hit shall not be
so / said he / But I shall goo with you / and then he converted them in the
faith / And commanded them that they should bind his ho^des behynd his back /
and led him so bounden to the king / and when the king saw him he was aferd
and fill down of the siege and his servants lift him up and releuyd him again
/ And then the king inquired his name and his contray / and cristofre said to
him / tofore or I was baptized I was named reprobus and after I am named
xpo^fer / tofore baptem a cananee / now a christian man / to whom the king said /
thou have a folissh name that is to wete of crist crucified which conde not
help him self ne may not proffite to the / How therefore thou cursid cananyen
why wylt thou not do sacrefyse to our gods / to whom cristofre said / you art
righfully called dagarus for thou art the death of the world / and felaw of the
devil / and thy gods ben made with the hondes of men / And the king said to
him thou were norysshed among wyld bestes / and therefore thou may not say but
wyld langage and words unknown to men / And if thou wylt now do sacrefyse to
the gods / I shall give to the great yeftes and great honors / and if not I
shall destroy the and consume by great pains and tormentis / But for all
this he would in no wise do sacrefyse / wherefore he was sent in to prison / And
the king did do behede the other knights that he had sent for him whom he had
converted / and after this he sent in to the prison to Saint Christofer two
fair wymen of whom that one was named vysena / And that other Aquylyne / and
promised to them many great yeftes if they could draw xpo^fer to sin with
them / And when xpo^fer saw that he set him down in prayer / And when he was
constrained by them that enbraced him to meue / he a^oos and said what seek ye
/ For what cause be ye comen hither / And they which were affrayed of his
chyere and clerenes of his vysage sayden / holy saint of god have pite of us so
that we may believe in that god that thou prechest / And when the king herd
that / He commanded that they should be laten out and brought to fore him / to
whom he said / ye be deceived / but I swear to you by my gods / that if ye
do no sacrefise to my gods ye shall anon peryssh by evil death / And they
said to him if thou wylt that we shall do sacrefyse / command that the
places may be made clean / and that all the people may assemble at the temple /
and when this was done they entered in to the temple and took their gyrdles and
put them about the necks of their gods / And drew them to therthe / and
brake them all in peaces and said to them that were there / Goo and call
phisiciens and leches for to hele your gods / And then by the commandment
of the king / Aquylyne was honged / and a right great and heavy stone was honged
at her feet / so that her members were much despitously broken / And when she
was deed and passyd to our lord / her suster vicena was cast in to a great fire
/ but she issued out without harm all hool / and then he made to smite of
her head / And so suffered death / After this xpo^fer was brought tofore the king
/ And the king commanded that he should be beten with rods of iron / and that
there should be set upon his hode a cross of iron read hot and brennyng and
then after he did do make a siege or a stole of iron / and made christofer to
be bounden thereon / And after to set fire under it / And cast theryn pytche
/ but the siege or setyl malte like wax / And Christofer issued out without
any harm or hurt / And when the king saw that / He commanded that he should
be bunde to a strong stake and that he should be through shoten with arowes with
xl knights archers /

But none of the knights might attain him / For the arowes henge in thayer
about nyghe him without touching / Then the king wend that he had be through
shoten with the arowes of the knights / and adressid him for to goo to him /
And one of the arowes returned suddenly fro the air / And smote him in the eye
and blinded him / To whom Chrystofer said / Tyrant I shall dye to morn make
a lytyl claye with my blood temperyd and enoynte therwyth thyn eye / and thou
shall receive health / Then by the commandment of the king he was ladde for
to be byheded and then there he made his oryson / and his head was smeton of
and so suffered martirdom / And the king then took a lytyl of his blood and
leyde it on his eye / and said in the name of god and of Saint xpo^fer / and
was anon heled / Then the king by leued in god and gaf commandment that if
any person blamed god or saint xpo^fer / he should anon be sleyne with the
swerd /

Ambrose says in his preface thus of this holy martyr / lord thou have given
to xpo^fer so great plente of virtues / and such grace of doctrine that he
called fro the error of paynems xlviij thousand men to thonour of christian
faith by his shynyng miracles / And vesene and aquylene which long had been
comyne at bourdel under the stenche of lecherye / He called and made them
serve in thabyte of chastyte / And enseygned them to a like crown of martirdom
/ And with this he being strayned and bounden in a fete of iron and great fire
put under doubted nothing the hete / And all an hole day during stood bounden
to a stake / Might not be through persed with arowes of all the knights / And
with that / one of the arowes smote out the eye of the tyraunte / To whom the
blood of the holy martyr restablysshed his sight / and enlumyned him in taking
away the blyndnes of his body / and gate of the christian mind and pardon And
also gate of the by prayer to put away sekenes and sores fro them that remember
his passion and figure / Then late us pray to saint xpo^fre that he pray
for us etc^ /

Thus ends the life of saint Christofre martyr /
Of the seven Slepars
THe seven slepars were born in the cite of Ephesym / And when decyan
the emperor came in to Ephesym for the persecucion of criste^ men he commanded
to edefye the temples in the myddle of the cite / so that all should come with
him to do sacrefyse to thydollys / And did do seche all the christian people and
bind them for to make them to do sacrefyse or else to put them to death / In
such wise that every man was aferde of the raynes that he promised / that the
friend forsook his friend / And the sone renyed his fader / And the fader the
sone / And then in this cite were founden seven christian men that is to wete /
maxymyen / Malchus / marcyanus / deny^ Ioh^n / Serapyon / and Constantyn And
when they saw this they had much sorrow / and by cause they were the first in
the paleys that despised the sacrefises / they hyd them in their howses / and
were in fastings and in prayers / And then they were accused to fore dacien
and came thither and were founden very christian men / then was given to them
space for to repent them / unto the coming again of dacyen / And in the mean
while they despended thayr patrymonye in alms to the pour people /

And assembled them to gydre and took counseyl and went to the mount of Celyon
/ And there ordained to be more secretly / And there hyd them long time / And
one of them admynystred and served them all way / And when he went in to the
cite / he clothed him in thabyte of a beggar / when dacyen was comen again he
commanded that they should be fette / And then malchus which was their
servant and mynystred to them mete and drink returned in great dread to his
felawes and told and showed to them the great f^rour and wodenes of the emperor
/ And then were they sore aferde And malchus set tofore them the loves of
breed that he had brought so that they were comforted of the mete And were more
strong for to suffer tormentis / and when they had taken their refection and
satte in weeping and waylynges suddenly as god would they slepte / And when it came
on the morn they were sought and could not be founden / Wherefore Dacien was
sorouful by cause he had lost such young men / And then they were accused
that they were hid in the mount of Celyon / And had given their goods to
pour men and yet abode in their purpoos / And then commanded decius that
their kynrede should come to him and menaced them to the death if they said not
of them all that they knew / And they accused them and comployned that they
had despended al their richesses / then decius thought what he should do with
them / and as our lord would he enclosed the mouth of the cave wherein they were
with stones to the end that they should dye therein for hungre and fault of mete /
then the mynystres / and two christian men / Theodore and Ruffyne wrote their
martirdom and leyde it subtly among the stones / And when decius was deed and
all that generation three Clxxij year after / and the xxx year of Theodocien
the emperor when the heresye was of them that denied the Resurrexyon of deed
bodies and began to grow / Theodocien then the most christian emperor being
sorouful that the faith of our lord was so felonysly demened for anger and
heaviness he cladde him in hair and wept every day in a secret place / and
ladde a full holy life / which god merciful and piteous seeing would conforte
them that were sorouful and weeping / and give to them esperaunce and hope of
the resurexyon of deed men / And opened the precious tresour of his pity and
raised the forsayde martirs / in this manner following / he put in the will of a
burgeys of ephesym / that he would make in that montayn which was deserte and
aspre a stable for his pastors and herdemen / And it happed that of adventure
the masons that made the said stable opened this cave / And then these holy
seyntes that were with in awoke and were raised / and enter salewed each other
/ And had supposed verily that they had slepte but one night only / And
remembered of the heaviness that they had the day tofore / And then malcus
which mynystred to them said what decyus had ordained of them for he said we
have been sought like as I said to you yesterday for to do sacrefyse to
thydollys / that is that the emperor desires of us / and then maxymyen
ansuerde / god our lord knows that we shall never sacrefye / And comforted
his felawes / He commanded to malchus to goo and by^ breed in the cite / And
bad him bring more than he did yesterday / and also tenquyre and demand what
the emperor had commanded to do / And then malcus took v shilynges And
issued out of the cave / and when he saw the masons and the stones tofore the
cave / he began to bliss him / and was much admerueyllyd / But he thought
litil on ye stones / for he thought on other thing / Then came he all
doubtous to the yates of the cite / And was al admerueylled / For he saw the
sign of the cross about the yate / and then without taryeng he went to that
other yate of the cite and fond there also the sign of the cross thereon / and
then he had great merueyle / ffor upon every yate he saw set up the sign
of the cross / And therewith the cite was garnysshed / And then he blessed
him and returned to the first gate / and wend he had dremed / and after he
aduysed and comforted him self / and covered his vysage and entered in to the
cite / and when he came to the sellars of bread And herd the men speak of god
yet then was he more abashed / and said What is this that no man yesterday
durst name Ihesu christ / And now every man confessyth him to be christian I
trow this is not the cite of ephesym For it is all otherwise builded / It is
sum other cite I wot not what / And when he demanded and herd verily that
it was ephesym / he supposed that he had er^yd / And thought verily to goo
again to his se^awes / And then went to them that sold bread And when he
showed his money the sellers merueyled / and said that one to that other /
that this young man had sou^den sum old tresour / and when malchus saw them
talk to gydre / he doubted that they would led him to the emperor / and was
sore aferde / and prayed them to ^a^e him goo / and keep both money and breed /
but they held him / and said to him / Of wh^ns art thou / For thou have
founden tresours of old emperors / Show it to us and we shall be felaws
with the and keep it secret / And mal^^us was so aferd that he wist not what
to say to them for dread / And when they saw that he spacke not / They put a
cord about his neck / and drew him through the cite unto the myddle And
tidings were had al about in the cite that a young man had found ancient
tresour in such wise that all they of the cite assembled about him / And
confessyd there that he had founden no tresoure And he byheld them all / but
he could know no man there of his kynrede ne bygnage which he had verily
supposed that they had lived / but he fond non wherefore he stood as he had been
from him self in the myddle of the cite / And when saint martyn the bishop and
an typater the consul which were new comen in to this cite / herd of this
thing they sent for him that they should bring him wisely to them and his money
with him / And when he was brought to the church he wend well he should have been led to the emperor decius / And then the bishop and the consul
merueylled of the money / and they demanded him where he had founden this
tresour unknown / And he answered that he had nothing founden / But it was
comen to him of his kynrede and patrimony / and they demanded of him of what
cite he was / I wot well that I am of this cite / if this be the cyt^ of Ephesym
/ And the Judge said to him / Late thy kynrede come and witness for the / And
he named them But none knew them / And they said that he feigned for tescape
fro them in some manner / And then said the Judge how may we believe the that
this money is comen to the / of thy friends when it appears in the scripture
that it is more than iijClxxij year sith it was made and forged / and is of
the first days of decyus the emperor / And it resembles nothing to our money /
and how may it come fro thy lygnage so long sithe / and thou art young / and
would deceive the wise and ancient men of this cite of Ephesym / And therefore
I command that thou be demened after the law / til thou have confessyd where
thou have found this money Then malchus kneled down tofore them and said /
For gods sake lords say ye to me that I shall demand you And I shall tell
to you all that I have in my heart / Decius the emperor that was in this cite
where is he / And the bishop said to him / sone there is no such at this day
in the world that is named decyus / he was emperor many years sith / And
malchus said sire hereof I am gretely abashed / and noman byleueth me / For I
wot well that we fled for fere of decyus the emperor / and I saw him that
yesterday he entered in to this cite / if this be the cite of ephesym then the
bishop thought in him self / and said to the Judge that this is a vision that
our lord will have showed by this young man / Then said the young man follow ye
me / and I shall show to you my felawes which ben in the mount of Celion / And
believe ye them / This know I well that we fled fro the face of the emperor
decyus / And then they went with him and a great multitude of the people of
the cite with them / And malchus entered first in to the cave to his felawes /
And the bishop next after him And there fond they among the stones the letters
sealed with two sealis of silver / And then the byssh^p called them that were
comen thither / and read them tofore them all / So that they that herd it were
all abashed and admerueyllyd / And they saw the Seyntes sittyng in the cave /
And their vysages like unto roses flouring and they knelyng down glorified god
And anon the bishop and the Judge sent to theodocyen the emperor / prayeng him
that he would come anon for to s^e the merueylles of our lord that he had late
showed / And anon he aroos up fro the ground / And took of the sack in which
he wept / And glorified our lord / And came fro constantinople to Ephesym / And
all they came against him / And ascendyd in to the mountain with him to gydre
unto the saints in to the cave

And as soon as the blessed seyntes of our lord saw the emperor come / their
visages shone like to the son / And the emperor entrid then and glorified
our lord and enbraced them weeping upon each of them and said / I see you now
like as I should see our lord reysyng lazare / And then maxymyen said to him /
believe us / For for sothe our lord has raised us tofore the day of the great
resurrection /

And to the end that thou believe fermly the resurection of the deed people /
Meryly we ben raised as ye here see and live And in like wise as the child is
in the womb of his mother without felyng harm or hurt / In the same wise we
have be living and slepyng in lyggyng here without felyng of any thing / And
when they had said all this / they enclyned their hedes to therthe / and
rendrid their spirits at the commandment of our lord Ih^u Criste / and so
deyed / Then the emperor aroos and fyl on them weeping strongly / and enbraced
them / And kyssed them deboneyrlye And then he commanded to make precious
sepulcres of gold and silver and to burye their bodies therein / and in the same
night they appiered to the Emperor / and said to him / that he should suffer
them to lie on therthe like as they had leyn to fore til that time that our
lord had raised hem / unto the time that they should rise again / Then
commanded the emperor that the place should be aourned nobly and richely with
precious stones / and all the bishops that Would confess the resurrection
should be assoyled /

It is doubt of that which is said that they slepte CCClxij year / For they
were raised the year of our lord iiijClxxviij / and decius reigned but one year
and three months / and that was in the year of our lord ijC and lxx And so
they slepte but ijC and viij year

Thus ends the historye of the seven slepars

Cogytacion / Affection / Intencion / Action / and locucion / or speech /

intencion right / and thereof he is said departed / Intencion is that departs
works for of a simple eye comes a bright body / Of a shrewd eye is made a

courage / hit is said that ambrose in the book of geruase and prothase has
rehearsed the life and passion of them / In sum books it is read / That there
was a phylosophre having devotion to nazaryen that wrote his passyo^ which
ceracius which buried the bodies of the seyntes leyde it at the head of them /

Of seint nazarien and seint celse
NAzarien was sone of a noble man named Affrican but he was a Jew and of saint
perpetua most christian woman and comen of the noblest of the romans / and had
be baptized of saint peter thappostle / when he was ix year old / he
merueilled gretely seeing his fader and mother so gretely to varye in
thobseruacion of their religyon for his mother kept the law of bapteme / and
his fader followed the law of ye sabate wherefore to who^ he might follow of them
he doubted much / for they both labored to draw him to their faith / at
last by the will of god he followed the law of his mother / and received ye holy
bapteme of saint line the pope / which when the fader knew he began to exorte
and draw him fro his holy purpos / And rehearsed to him by order all the manner
of tormentis that Were ordained for christian men but he might not withdraw him
fro his holy purpose / That Which is said that he was baptized of line the
pope / it is to understand that line was not then pope / but afterward he Was
pope / Nazaryen lived after his bapteme many years as it shall appear here after
/ which saffred martirdom under Nero / Which crucyfyed peter the last year of
his regne / Then when Nazaryen would in no Wise assent to his fader but
preached crist most constantly / His kynrede dradde lest he should be slain and
at their request and prayer he departed out of rome / And took with him vij
summers charged and laden with riches and goods / which all he gaf to pour
people in the parties of Italye to Which he came / And the tenth year that he
departed fro rome he came to placense and fro thens to mylane / And fond there
geruase and prothase holden in prison whom he comforted / and When it was
known that Nazarien had comforted / and encoraged the said marters / He was
anon taken and brought to the prefecte / and he always abydyng stydfastly in the
faith and knoulechyng of christ / was beten with staves / And so cast out of the
cite / and as he Went fro place to place / his mother Which then was deed
apperyd to him / and comforted him / and warned him that he should goo in to
ffraunce / and so he did / And when he came in to a town of france which that
hight gemellus and had converted much people to the faith of Ih^u christ / There
was a noble woman which offered to him her sone named cesse / which was an
elegante and fair child / prayeng him that he would baptyse him and take him
with him / and when the prefecte of france herd hereof / he took him and the
child celse with their hondes bounden behynd them / and a chain in their
necks put them in prison / for to torment them on the morn / Then the wife
of the prefecte sent to him affermyng that it was not rightfully done yt he
should sle Innocents / but the gods almighty should presume to avenge them /
By which words the prefecte was corrected / and deliuerd the Innocentis but
charged and warned them yt they should no more preche there then he icam to
the cite of tryre and he was the frst that preached crist and converted many to
ye faith and there edefyed a church / and when cornelye lyeutenant of nero
herd hereof he sent thither an hundred knights for to take him / and they fond
him in an Oratorye that he had made / And took him and bound his hondes saying
/ the great nero has sent for the / to whom nazaryen said / the king al out of
order has also knights out of order / why came ye not honestly and said / New
calls the / and I would have comen / Then they led him bounden so to New /
and Celse the child weeping they smote and buffetted him / And constrained him
to follow / and when New saw them he commanded to put them in prison till they
there deyed by tormentis / And on a day when New sent his hunters to take wyld
festys / Suddenly a great multitude of wild beestes / brake their ordenaunce /
and entryd the gardyn of nero where they slow and al to rent many men / that
nero all troubled fled / and hurted his foot / that uneath he might come to
his paleys / and after lay many a day / and might not remeue for the pain of
the wound / At last he remembryd of nazaryen and celse / and supposed his
gods were wroth with him / because he suffered them to live so long / Then
by the commandment of the emperor / knights beat them both and brought them
to fore the emperor Nero saw their vysages shine like the son / And he
supposed that they had don it fantastykly to much him by magyk / and
commanded them to put away their enchauntementis / and offer to the gods /
Then was nazaryen led to the temple and prayed that all men should goo out
/ And then he made his prayers to god / And all thydolles fyl down and were
broken / and when new herd that he commanded to cast him in to the sea And if
it happed that he escaped they should follow and take him and brenne him / and
should take the ashes of him and cast it in to the sea nazaryen thene and the
child Celse were put in a ship / and brought in to the myddle of the sea /
And were both cast in / and anon about the ship aroos a great tempeste and
about them was great calm and tranquylite / when they then that were in the
ship were aferd to be perisshed / and repented them of the harm and
wyckednes that they had co^mysed in the seyntes / Nazaryen with the child celse
walked upon the sea and apperid to them with a glad chere / and entered in to
the ship to them / And then they beleuyng / By his prayer the sea was
peasid / and fro thens they sailed vjC paas and came to a place beside Iene /
where they long preached / And after came to melane where they fond geruase and
prothase in the place where he had left them / and when Anolynus the provost
herd that / sent him in exyle / and Celse the child abode in the house with a
noble woman Nazaryen then came to rome / and fond his fader then old and
christian / and inquired of him how he was crystened which said that peter
thappostle had appiered to him and bad him believe as his wife and his sone did /
then fro thens he was exyled of tho bisshoppes unto melane again / Fro whens
tofore he was exyled to rome / and was now compellyd again with wrong to goo
to rome / where he was presented to the provost with the child Celse / which
then was ladde out of the yate of rome / which is named three wallis with the
child celse and there was byheded / whose bodies christian men took up / and by
night buried it in a gardyne / and the next night they apperyd to an holy saint
named Ciriake saying that he should burye their bodies in his house more depper
for dread of nero / To whom he said / I pray you first my lords that ye make
my daughter hole of the palsy / which anon when she was hool / he took the
bodies / and as they commanded he did / Long time after this / god showed
their bodies to saint Ambrose / and he left celse lyeng in his place / and
took up the body of nazarien with as fresshe blood as he had be buried / the
same day smellyng a merueyllous sweet odor Incorupte with his here and his
berde and brought it to the church of thappostles / And there buried it
honorably / and after took up the body of celse and beryed it in the same
church / They suffered death about the year of our lord lvij / Of this martyr
says Ambrose in his preface / O thou holy noble champyon and blessed martyr
shynyng by thy shedyng of thy blood thou have deserved to have the kingdom of
heaven which by the Innumerable assaults of tormentis have ouercomen the
wodenes of the tyrant by the constance of faith / And have gadred to gydre a
multitude of people to everlasting life O thou martyr of whose health the church
Ioyeth more / than the world Ioyed in his punysshyng / O thou blessed mother of
her children glorified with tormentis / which led them not with waylyng ne
sorowyng to hell / But departing hens followed her with perpetuel laud unto
the heavenly kyngdoms All this and more says Saint Ambrose

Thus enden the lives of seint Nazaryen / and Saint Celse
Here follows the life of saint Felyx / and first of his name
FElyx is said of felicitate that is blessydnes / Or else felix as beryng
stryues and tribulacions of this world for everlasting life Or felix beryng
lyhe or water to faith which is to say ledyng people to the faith /

Of saint Felix
FElyx was chosen pope instead of liberie and was ordained and sacred / For by
cause lybery the pope would not consent to the heresy of tharryens / he was sent
in to exyle / of constancyen sone of constantyn / and there abode three year /
Wherefore all the clergy of rome ordained Felix to be pope by the will and
consent of liberie And then this Felix assembled a counseyl of xlviij
bisshoppes / And condemned Constancien Arryen and he retike and two prestes
which favored and sustained him in his heresye For which thing constancien
was Wroth / and chased Felix out of his bisshopriche / and called again
liberien by this couenaunte / that he should be partener with him and the other
whom Felix had condemned / and liberien which was tormented by the greuousnes
of his exyle submytted him unto the evil heresye / and thus the persecucion
grew more / In so much that many prestes and clerks were slain within the
church / wstthout that lyberien defended them / and Felix which was cast out
of his bysshopriche dwelled in his own heritage / of which he was put out and
was martred by smytyng of / of his head about the year of our lord CCC and xl
/

Thus ends the life of saint felix pope / and Martyr
Here follows of the Seintes Simplicien Faustyn and Beatrice and first of
their names
SYmplicien is as much to say as simple or Without any plyte of falsehede / He
was simple by meknes and humylite / For he humbled him self to receive
martirdom / he was knowing / For he knew the christian faith / and for the faith
he suffered martirdom / ^ Faustyn is as much to say as fortunate / Beatrice is
to say holdyng blessydnes / or it is said of beata that is blessed / / And of
ares that is virtue which is a blessed virtue / And beatryce is said sorouful
or beuy / For she was sorouful of the passion of her brethern / and she was
blessed by her martirdom /

Of the Seintes / Simplicien Faustyn and Beatrice
SYmplicien and ffaustyn brethern when they would not by no constraynt do
sacrefyse to thydolles / and refused it utterly they suffered many tormentis at
rome under diocl^sien / and at last sentence was given against them and were
byheded and their bodies cast in to tyber the river / And Beatrice their
suster took up the bodies of them / and buried them honorably / Lucrete which
was provost of rome went on a time playeng about therytage of beatrice and
saw her and made her to be taken / and commanded her that she should make
sacrefyse to his gods and she refused it / And lucrete made his servants to
strangle her in a night and let her lie / and lucyne the virgyne took away
the body and buried it with her brethern / and after that lucrete entrid in to
their heritage And thus as he assailed the martirs And did do make a great
feste to his friends / And as he satte at dinner / A young child that lay

thou lucrete here and vndestande thou have sleyne and assailed the marters of
god / and therefore thou art yeuen in to the possessyon of the fend / and then
anon lucrete tremblid and fered / And was forthwith rauysshed of the devil and
was so tormented by iij hours of the devil that he deyed at that same dinner /
and when they that were there saw that / they were conuertid to the faith /
and recompted to al men how the passion of seint beatrice was aduengyd at the

Thus enden the lives of the Seintes / Simplicien Faustin and Beatrice
And here follows the life of Saint Martha
Saint Martha hostess of our lord Ihesu christ was born of a ryalle kynrede /
Her fader was named Syro And her mother euchalia / The fader of her was duc of
Sirie and marytyme / And martha with her suster posseded by the heritage of
their mother three places / that was the castle magdalene and bethanye / and a
part of Iherusalem / It is nowher read that martha had ever any husbond ne
felawsshyp of man / But she as a noble hostess mynystred and served our lord /
and would also that her suster should serve him and help her / ffor she thought
that all the world was not suffycyent to serve such a gh^ste / After
thascencyon of our lord when the dyscyples were departed / she with her brother
lazare and her suster Marie Also Saint maxymyne / Which baptized them / and to
whom they were commysed of the holy ghoost / And many other were put in to a
ship without sail ores or rother gouernayle of the paynems / which by the
conduyte of our lord they came all to marcelle / and after came to the
territorye of Aquense or ays / And there converted the people to the faith /
Martha was right facounde of speech and curtoys and gracious to the sight of
the people / There was that time upon the River of rone in a certain wode
between ari late and auynyon a great dragon half lest and half fysshe /
gretter than an ox / longer than an horse / hayng tethe sharp as a sword /
and horned on either side / head like a lion / tail like a serpent / and
defended him with two Wings on either side / and could not be beten with cast
of stones ne with other armor / And was as strong as xij lions or beres /
which dragon lay hydyng and lurkyng in the river / and perysshed them that
passyd by and drowned ships / he came thither by see fro galyce and was
engendryd of leuiathan / which is a serpent of the water and is much wood /
And of a be called bonacho / that is engendryd in galyce / And when he is
pursiewed he cast out of his belly behynd his order the space of an aker bond on
them that follow him and it is bright as glass / And what it touches it
brenneth as fire / To Whom martha at the prayer of the people came in to the wode
/ And fond him etyng a man / And she cast on him holy water / and showed to him
the cross / which anon was ouercomen and stondyng still as a sheep she bond
him with her owen gyrdle / and then Was sleyn with speres and glayues of the
people / the dragon was called of them that dwelled in the contre tharasconus
whereof in remembrance of him / that place is called tharasconus which tofore
was called verlue and the black lake / by cause there ben wodes shadowous and
black / and there the blessed martha by license of maxymyne her master and of
her suster duellyd and abode in the same place after / and daily ocupyed in
prayers and in fastings / and there after assembled and were gadred to gydre a
great couente of susters / and bilded a fair church at thonour of the blessed
marie virgyne / where she led an hard and a sharp life / she eschewed
flesh and all fat mete / eggs chese and wine / she ete but ones a day /
An hundred times a day and an hundred times a night she kneled down and bowed
her knees On a time at Auynyon when she preched between the town and the River
of roon there was a young man on that other side of the river desyryng to here
her words / and had no bote to pass over / he began to swymme naked / but he
was suddenly taken by the strength of the water / And anon suffocate and
drowned / whose body uneath was founden the next day / And when it was taken
up / it was presented at the feet of martha for to be raised to life / She
then in manner of a cross fill down to the ground and prayed in this manner /
O adonay lord Ih^u crist which reysedest sometime my well byloued brother /
behold my most dear gheste / to the faith of them that stand here / and
reyse this child / And she took him by the hand / and forthwith he aroos
living / and received the holy bapteme Eusebyus tellith in the v book of
thistorye ecclesiast / that a woman named emorissa / After that she was heled
of our lord / she made in her court an image like unto Ihesu christ / with
cloth and h^me like as she saw him when she was heled / And worshipped him
much devoutly / The herbs that grew under thymage / to fore that she had
touched the hemme were of no virtue / but after that she had touched it / they
were of so much virtue / that many seek people by them were heled / That woman
emorissa whom our lord heled / ambrose says that it was martha / Seint Iherome
says / and it is had in historia tripertita that Iulianus apostata took away
that image that Emorissa made / and set his own there which with the stroke
of thondre was al to broken / Our lord came to her a year tofore her death and
showed to her that she should depart out of this world / and all that year she
was seek and labored in the febrys and viij days tofore her death she herd
the heavenly felawships of angellis beryng her susters soul in to heaven / and
anon did do come all the covent of brethern of susters and said to them my
friends and most sweet felawes / I pray you to rejoice and enjoy with me /
For I see the felawship of angellys bear the soul of my suster marie unto
heaven / O most fair and sweet suster / thou lyuest now with thy master and my
ghest in the blessid sete in heaven / and then anon Martha said to them that
were present that her death was nyghe / And had to light the tapers about her /
And that they should wake unto her death / And about mydnyght to fore the day of
her death / they that should watch were heavy of sleep and slepte / and there came
a great wind and extyncte and did ont the lights / She then seeing a great
tourhe of wicked spirits began to pray and said / My fader hely / my dear
gheste / thise de^cyuers ben gadred for to devour me / bryngyng wreton all the
evil deeds that ever I did / O blessed hely be not for withdrawn fro me / but
entende in to mine help / and f^rthwith she saw her suster coming to her
holdyng a bronde in her hand and lyghted the tapers and lamps / and as each
of them called other by their name / Crist came to them saying / come my
welbelouyd hostess / For where I am thou shalt be with me / Thou have
received me in thyn herberugh / and I shall receive the in mine heaven / and all
them that call upon the / I shall here them for thy love Then the hour of her
death approchyng she commanded that she should be born out of the house that she
might be hold and look up in to heaven / and to l^ye her on the earth / and to
hold the sig^e of the cross to fore her / and saying these words she prayed
/ My sweet gh^ste I beseech the to keep me thy pour creature / And like as thou
have vouched sauf to be lodged with me / so I beseech the to receive me in to
thyn heavenly herberugh And then she had that the passion after luke should be
read tofore her / And when this was said Pater in manus tuas comendo spiritum
meum / she gaf up her spirit and deyed in our lord / The next day following
that was the sunday / whiles they said lauds about her body / and did her
obsequy^ / and about the hour of tier^^ at petogori^e our lord appeared to the
blessid ffrancone syngyng mass / which after thepystle slepte in his chair /
and said to him my welbelouyd ffrancone / if thou will fulfille that thou
behyghtest long sith to my hostess martha / arise anon and follow me / whose
commandment he obeyed / and suddenly both came to tharascone And syngyng
thoffyce about the body And the other answeryng / they with there owen hondes
leyd the body into the sepulture / And troth it was that at petogorike when
they had songen in the chore / and the deken should goo read the gospel and
receive the benediction they awoke the bishop demaundyng the benediction /
Then the bishop awoke and said / why have ye awakend me my brethern / Our
lord Ihesu Crist has led me to his hostess martha / And we have leyed her
in her sepulture Now send thither messagers for to felche our ring of gold and
our gloves / which whiles I made me ready to burye her I delyuerd them to the
sextayne / and and I have forgoten them there by cause ye awoke me so soon /
Then were messagers sent forth / and as the bishop said they fond his ring
/ and one glove / which they brought again / and that other the sextayn
retained for a wytnes and memory / And the blessed ffrancone added thereto
saying that after her sepulture / a brother of ye same place a learned man in
the law demanded of our lord what was his name / To whom he ansuerd not / but
showed a book open in his hand in Which was wreton this versycle / In
everlasting memory shall be my rightful hoostesse and she shall dread non evil
in the last day / and when he should torn the leaves of the book / in every leef
he fond that same wreton / where afterward many miracles were showed and don at
her tomb / Then Clodoneus king of ffraunce was after this made a christian man
/ and baptized of saint remyge / And suffered great pain in his mines came to
her tomb / and there received very health / For which cause he enryched that
place / And the space of iij mile way about on both sides of the river of Roon
as well towns as castellys / he gaf to the same place and that place he made
free / Marcilla her servant wrote her life which afterward went in to
sclauonye / And there preached the gospel of christ / and after x year fro the
death of martha she restid in our lord / Then late us pray to this blessed
martha hostess of our lord / that after this short life we may be herberowed
in heaven with our blessed lord Ihesu crist / to whom he give Joy laud and
preysyng world without end Amen /

Thus ends the life of the blessed Saint martha /
And here folowen the lives of Abdon and Sennen
ABdon is said of Absein in greek / which is as much to say as cut in
latin / and dolos Which is to say as seeing / He was cut and hewn in his
body / and saw god by martirdom / Sennen is said of senos in greek / Which
is as much to say as Wit / and en that is in / And thereof is sennen as in
wit / or sennes as old / As who says he was old in wit /

Of seyntes Abdon and sennen
ABdon and sennen suffered martirdom under decyen the emperor / wha^ decius
the emperor had surmounted babilone / and the other prouynces / he fond sum
christian men within the cite / And brought them with him bounden to the cite of
Cordule / And made them there to dye by diverse tormentys / And then Abdon and
sennen which were as governors of the contray / took the bodies and buried
them / Then were they accused and brought to decyen / and he did do led them
with him bounden in chains to rome / then were they brought tofore decien
and tofore the senators / then was it commanded that they should do

devoured by bytynges of wyld beestes / But they dyspyseden to make sacrefyse /
and spytten ayenste the false ydollys and statues / and then were they drawn
to the place of martyrdom / and made to be brought to them two lyone / and ij
berys / which did to them non harm ne touched them not / But rather kept
them fro harm / Then began they to cast speres and swerdes at them and at
last they were all to hewn with swerdis and then they were bounden by the
feet and drawn through the town unto thydolle of the son / And when they had
leyn there iij days quyryne subdeken took the bodies up and buried them in his
house / And they suffered death about the year of our lord two hundred liij /

Thus ends the lives of Abdon and Sennen /
Here follows the lyl of saint Germayne / and first of his name /
GErmayne is said of germe and ana that is hye / this is to say souerayn
germe / Three things ben fou^den in seed germynyng / that is to wete natural
hete / humor nutrimental and reason of seed / Then the holy Saint Germayn is
said as seed germynyng / For in him was hete by brennyng of love / humor by
fatness of devotion / and reason of the seed by virtue of predycacion by which
he enge^dryd much people to the faith / And in good manners / And constance the
priest wrote his life to saint seueryn bishop of Anserre /

Of Saint Germayne
GErmayn was of much noble lygnage born in ye cite ancerre And was taught and
informed well in the arts lyberalle / And after he went to rome / For to learn
the science of the decretees droytes and law And there received he so much of
dygnyte / that the senate sent him unto ffraunce for to have and obtain the
dygnyte of the duchy of all burgoyne And thus as he governed the cite more
dylygently than all the other / there was in the mids of the cite a tree which
was a pyn / On which men henge on the branches for the great merueyle of
their huntyn / the hedes of wyld bestes / but saint Amadour which was bishop
of that cite repreuyd them of such vanytees / and warned them and desired that
they should hew down that tree / to the end that none ylle occasion might come
to the christian men but they would not consent thereto in no manner / and on a
time when germayn was not in the town / the bishop did do cut down this tree
/ and made it to be burnt / And when Germayn knew it / he was much angry /
and forgate the christian relygyon / and came with a great multitude of knights
and assayed if he might slay the bishop / and then the bishop knew by
reuelacio^ ^euyne that Germayn should be his successor / and gaf place to his
wodenes / And went to the cite of augustydyn / And after he came again to
Ancerre / And then he shette and enclosed subtylly germayn within the church
/ and there sacred him / and said to him that he should be his successor in
the bysshopryche / and so he was / For anon after saint amadour deyed / and all the people required Germayn to be bishop / And then he gaf al his richesses
to pour people / And ch^unged his wif in to his suster / and returned so his
body by the space of xxx year / that he never ete bred of whete / ne drank wyn
/ ne he used no potage / and would have no salt to sauer his mete / and twyes
in the year he drank wyn / and that was at crystemasse and at estre / and to
quench and to take away the sauer of the wyn he put in plente of water / and
in his refection / he took of the ashes after his barley breed and fasted
every day / and ete never til night / In winter ne in summer / he had but one
clothyng that was the hair / his cote and his gown and if it so happed that he
gaf not his vestement to any pour man / he ware it so long that it was broken
and vnpeced his bed was all enuyronned with ashes / and hair and with a
sack / And had not his head adressyd upon a pyllowe more hyer than his
sholdres / but every day he wept and bare about his neck relyques of seyntes
he ware none other clothyng / he ware sold hosen or shoon / and selde was
gyrde / and the lif that he lived was above / man's power / his life was such
that it was great miracle and pity to see his flesh and was a thing not
credyble / and did so many miracles / that but if his merytes had goon before
/ they should have been trowed fantastique / On a time he was herberowed in a
place / where every night the table was made ready for to ete after souper when
men had souped / and he was much admerueyled thereof / and demanded of the
haost of the house / wherefore they made ready so to ete after souper / And thoost
said to him that it was for his neyhbours / which would come and drink one
after that other / and that night Saint Germayn establisshed him to wake for to
see what it was / It was not long after that the^e came theder a great multitude
of deuyls and came to the table in guyse of men and wymmen And when the holy man
saw them / he commanded them that they should not goo away / and after he sent
for to wake the neyhbours on all sides in such wise that every body was
found in his bed / and in their houses / and made the people to come and see
if they knew any of them / but they said nay And then he showed them that
they were deuylles / whereof the people were much abashed / by cause the
deuylles had mocqued them so /

And then saint Germayn coniured that they never after returned thither ne came
more there / That same time saint lupe floured which was bishop of Troyes /
the cite was assyeged of the king attyla / and saint lupe went upon the gate /
and cried and demanded what he was that so let them To whom he said I am
attila ye scorge of god / and then the meke bishop answered and said / and I
am lupe Alas the waster of the flock of god And have need of the scorge of god
and commanded then to opene the gates And the people of the king attil^ were
all made blind by the will of god so that they passyd through the town and saw
no man of ye cite ne did no harm to any body / Then the blessid germayn took
with him saint lupe / and they both went in to bretayne / where as the heresies
then were / but when they were on ye see a great tempest came and aroos /
which by the preyer of saint Germayne anon cessed / and then they were
received honestly of the people of the contre / whose coming deuyllys had said
to for which saint Germayn had cast out of bodies that they had vexed / and
when they had ouercomen the heresies / they returned again unto their own
places / On a time it happed that saint germayne lay seek in a street / which
street was afyre / To wh^m^ the people came and desired to bear him out of the
street for dread of the fire but he would not be born thens But put him self
against the fire which burnt all about him / and touched not him ne the house
that he was in / Another time he returned in to bretayn for the heresies / one
of his disciples followed him hastily and fyl seek by the way and deyed there /
and when saint germayn returned / he demanded to see the sepulture of his
dysciple that was deed / and it was opened to him And he called him by his name
/ and demanded him what he did and made and if he would dwell any more with
him / and anon the body spacke and said that he was well / and al things were
sweet to him / and would no more be callid again in to this world he said / And
the saint granted him that he should be in rest / and l^yde down his head and
slepte in our lord / He preched on a time in brytayn so much that the king
denied him lodgyng and his people / Then it happed that the kings kowherd
went with his portion that he fette at paleys and bare it to his lytil house /
And he saw the blessed Germayne and his men seche their lodgyng where they
might he herberowed that night / And the Cowherd brought them in to his hows /
and saw that they had much hongre / But he had not mete enough for him and
for his ghestes / This Cowherde had but one calf / which he did do slay for
to give to them / And he received them debonayrly with the litil good that he
had / And when they had souped and had said graces / Saint germayn bad him
bring to him the bones of the calf / and to lay them upon ye skin And after
made his prayer to god / and anon the calf aroos to life without taryeng / and
on the morn seint germayn came hastily to the king / and demanded him why he
had denied him lodgyng / Then the king being sore abashed could not answer
/ Then he said to the king goo out / and leave thy royame to one better than
thou art And then saint germayn ordained the cowherd to be governor of the
royame / Then as the saxons fought against the brytons / and saw that they
were but a few men and saw the holy men pass by them / they called hem and
the seyntes preached so much to them that they came to the grace of bapteme ^
And on ester day they cast of their armor / and through brennyng charity of
faith purposed to fight / and when that other party herd that they purposed
to goo against them hardely / And saint Germayn hyd him self aparte with his
people / and warned them when he should cry / Alleluya / that they should answer
/ Alleluya / And when the said saint germayn had cried / Alleluya / And the
other had answered / Their enemies had so great fere / that they cast away all
their armours / and had wend verily that all the montayns had fallen on them
and heaven also / and so al affrayed fled away / On a time as saint germayn
passed by augustynence / and went to the tomb of seint cassyen and inquired of
him how it was with him / And he answered him out of the tomb and said / I am
in sweet rest / and abide the coming of our redemer / and he said again /
rest thou then stylle in the name of our lord / and pray for us devoutly
that we may deserve the holy Joys of the resurrection / And when Saint germayn
came in to rauenne he was received much honorably of the queen placida / And
of valentynyen her son / and at the hour of souper she sent to him a right
great vessel of silver / full of delycious mete / the which he retained for to
give to pour men / And instead hereof he sent to the queen a dysshe of tree /
and a barley loof / the which she received gladly / and after did do couere
the dysshe with silver and kept it long with great deuoco^n On a time when the
lady had boden him for to dyne with her / he granted it debonayrly / and
because he was weary of traueyle / and fastings he rode from his hostel unto
the paleys upon an ass / and whiles he dyned his ass deyed / And when the
queen knew that his ass was deed / She was much sorouful / and did do
present to him a right good horse of right great beauty and great / and when he
saw him so rychely aourned and arrayed / he would not take it / but said show
me mine ass / For he yt brought me hither shall bring me home / And went to the
deed ass / and said arise and late us return home / and anon he aroos and
awoke as he had slepte and as he had had no harm / and then Saint germayne
mounted on his ass and r^de to his lodgyng / but er he departed fro rauenne he
said / that he should not belong in this world / and a while after he fyl seek
of the fevers or access / and the seven day after passyd out of this world
unto our lord / and his body was borne in to ffraunce / like as he had desired
of the queen / and he deyed about the year of our lord / CCCC / and xxj /
Saint germayn had promised to saint Eusebye which was bishop of versayle /
that when he returned he would halowe his church that he head founded / And when
saint eusebe understood that he was deed / he would him self halowe his church
and did do light the tapres / But the ofter they light them / so often they went
out / and were quenchyd / and when Saint Eusebe saw this / he apperceyued well
that the halowyng was done / or else it should be done an other time / or it
should be reserved to an other bishop / and when the body of saint germayn was
brought to versayl as soon as his body was brought in to the church all the
tapers were light by them self by gods grace / Then saint eusebe remembered
of the promise of Saint germayne / and that which he had promysid living / He
accomplisshed i^ being deed / But it is not to be understand that this was the
great eusebe bishop of versayl / That this was don in his time / ffor he deyed
under valent the emperor / And fro the death of him unto the death of saint
germayn was more than fyfty year /

But this was another Eusebe under whom this thing was don / Then late us
pray unto this holy germayn that he pray for us to god almighty / that after
this life we may come to everlasting bliss in heaven Amen /

Thus ends the life of Saint Germayn
Here next follows the life of Saint Eusebe / And first of his name /
EUsebe is said of eu / which is as much to say as good / And sebe that is
eloquence or staco^n / Or Eusebe is as much to say as worship / he had bounte
in sanctificacion / Eloquence in defense of the faith stacion in the
stedfastnes of martirdom And good wyrshyppyng in the reverence of god /

Of saint Eusebe
EUsebe was always a vyrgyne / and whiles he was yet young in the faith he
received bapteme and name of Eusebe the pope / In which bapteme the hands of
angellis were seen that lift him out of the font On a day a certain lady was
esprised of his beauty / and would have goon to his chamber / And thangellis
kept the door in such wise that she might not enter / and on the morn she
went to him and kneled down at his feet / and required of mercy and foryeuenes
/ of that she had been in will to have made him sinned / and he pardonned her
debonayrly / And when he was ordained to be a priest / he shone in so great
holiness / that when he sang the solempnytees of the masses the angellys
served him / After this when the heresye of the arryans had enfected al Italye
/ / and Constantyn the emperor fauouryng them / Iulyus the pope sacred Eusebe in
to bishop of versaylle the cite / the which held the pryncipate of the other
citees in Italye / and when the heretics herd say that / they shitte fast
the doors of the church / which was of our blessed lady and blessed virgyne
seint marie / then the blessed saint knelyd down / and anon the doors opened
by his prayer / Then put he out eugenyen bishop of melan / Which was
corrumped of this evil heresye / and ordained in his place denis a man / right
catholyque / And thus Eusebe purged all the church of thoccident / And
anastase purged thoryent of the heresye arryen / Arrius was a priest of
Alysaunder / which said and affermed that christ was a pure creature / And
said that he was not god / and for us was made / that we by him as by an
Instrument were made of god / And therefore constantyn ordained a counseyl at
nycene / where as this error was condemned / And after this arryen deyed of a
miserable death / For he voyded all his entrayles bynethe at this foundement /
and Constancien sone of constantyne was corrupt with this heresye / For which
cause this constancien had great hate against Eusebe / And assembled a counseyl
of many bysshoppis / And called denis and sent many lettres to eusebe and he
knew well that the malice of him was so great that he daygned not come to him
/ wherefore the emperor establisshed against thexcusacion of him / that the
counseyl should be solempnysed at mylane which was nygh to him / and when he
saw that eusebe was not there / He commanded to the Arryens that they should
write their faith / and send it to Denis bishop of Melane / and xxix
bysshoppes he made subscrybe the same faith / And when Eusebe herd that / he
issued out of his cite for to goo to mylane / And said well to fore that he
should suffer much / And thus as be came to a flood for to goo to mylane / the
ship tarried long on that other side of the River but the ship came at his
commandment And bare him over and his felawshyp without governor / Then
the foresaid denis came against him and kneled down to his feet and required
pardon and when Eusebe could not be turned by yeftes ne by menaces of this
Emperor / he said tofore them all / ye say that the son is less than the
fader wherefore have ye then made my son and my dyscyple gretter than me /
for the dyscyple is not above the maistre / ne the son above the fader /
Then were they meuyd by this reason / And showed to him the writing that they
had made and denis had wreton / and they said that he had wreton / And he said
nay / I shall not subscrybe after my son / to whom I am souerayn by auctorite
/ but brenne this writing / And after write another if ye will / er I shall
write / and thus by the will of god that cedule was brent which denis and the
xxix bisshops had subscrybed / and then tharcyens wrote again another cedule
/ and delyuerd it to Eusebe and to the other bysshoppes for to subscrybe / but
the bysshoppes enhardyed of Eusebe / would in no wise consent to subscribe / but
they were glad that thylke cedule which by constraynt they had subscrybed was
burnt / then was constancien angry / and delyuerd Eusebe to the will of
tharcyens / and ano^ they drew him fro the myddle of the bysshoppes / and beat
him cruelly and drew him fro the highest of the palace by the stappes down to
the lowest and fro the lowest to the highest unto the time that his head was al
to bruised and bledde much blood / And yet he would not consent to them / and
then they bond is hands behind him / and after drew him with a cord
about his neck / and he thanked god and said that he was all ready for to
deye for the defense of the faith of holy church / Then constancien
exyledliber^en the pope / Denis / Paulyn / and all the other bysshoppes that
Eusebe had enhardyed / And then thareyens led Eusebe in to Ierapolyn a cite
of palastyne / and enclosed him in a strayt place in so much that it was
strayt and short that he might not stretche out his feet / ne torn him fro one
side to a another / and he had his head so strayt that he might not meue it / ne
torn hither ne thither his mombres in no manner sauf only his sholdres and arms
/ the place was so strayt in length and in bread / And when Constancien was
deed / Iulien suc^eded him / And would plese every man / and commanded that
all the bisshoppes which had been exyled should be repeellyd / And the temples
of the gods to be opened and would that all men should use peace / under what
law he were / And by this occasion Eusebe issued out of prison / and came to
Athanase and told to him what he had suffered / Then Iulyen deyde / And
Ionynyen reigned / And tharcyens sessed / Saint Eusebe returned to the town of
versayll / where the people received him with great Joy / And after when valent
reigned tharryens came again in to their forces / and entered in to the house of
Eusebe / and stoned him with stones / and so put him to death / And deyed
debonayrly in our lord / And was buried in the church that he had made / and
it is said that he Impetred and gate grace of our lord that none arcyen might
live in that cite / And after the cronyques he lived lxxxviij year / He floured
about the year of our lord CCC and l

Thus ends the life of saint Eusebe /
Here follows the seven machabees /
There were vij machabees with their worshipful mother / And a priest named
eleazar / which would ete no swynes flesh by cause it was defended in their
law / And after that it is contained in the first book of the makabees / they
suffered great tormentis and such as never were herd to fore / and it is to
understand that the church of the Oryent makes the solempnytees of the
seyntes of that one and of that other testament / and the church of the
occident / makes no feste of them of tholde testamente / sauf of the
Innocents / by cause that the souls of the seyntes of that time descended in
to hell / but she makes feste of the innocents by cause that Ih^u was slain
in eueriche of them / and also of the machabees / and there ben iiij resons
wherefore the church makes solempnytes of the machabees / how be it that they
descended in to hell / ^ The first reason is because they had prerogatyue of
martirdom not tofore like herd / amd above that any other of the old
testament have suffered / And therefore ben they preuyleged / that their passion
be solempnysed by their merit And this reason is set in scolastyca historya
/ The second reason is for the representacion of the mysterye / the number of
vij is universal and general And by them be vnderstonden and signefyed all
the faders of tholde testament worthy to be solempnysed / And how be it that
the church makes not solempnyte of them / by cause they descended in to hell
/ And also because that there came so great a multitude of new seyntes /
nevertheless in thise vij is don reverence to them all /

For as it is said by the nombre of seven is assygned an vnyuersite / The third
is because of thensample of suffryng / And there ben purposed in ensample of
good christian men for two things that is to say / the constance after the
constance of them they ben enhardyed in the love of the faith / and also for to
suffer for the law of the gospel / like as they did for the law of moses /
The fourth reason is for by cause of their tormentis / For they suffered such
torments for their law that they held for to deffende / like as christian men
do for the law of the gospel / And master Ioh^n beleth assygneth thise three
last resons in his sum of the office /

Thus ends it of the machabees /
Here follows the feste of seint Peter / ad vincula at lammas
THe feste of saint peter thappostle that is called ad vincula was establisshed
for four causes / That is to wete in remembrance of ye delyueraunce of saint
peter / And in mind of delyueraunce of Alexander / For to destroy the custom
of the paynems / And for to get Absolucion of spirituel bonds / And the first
cause which is in remembrance of saint peter ffor as it is said in thistorie
scolastyque / that herod agrippe went to rome and was right famylier with
gayus neuewe of tyberius Emperor And on a day as herod was in a chariote
brought with gayen / he lift up his hands in to heaven / And said I would
gladly see the death of this old felawe Peter / and the lord of all the world
/ and the chariot man herd this word said of herod /

And anon told it to tyberyus / wherefore Tyberyus set herod in prison /

And as he Was there he beheld on a day by him a tree / and saw upon the
branches of this tree an owl which satte thereon / and another prysonner
which was with him / that understood well dyuynacions said to him / Thou
shall be anon delyuerd and shall be enhaunsed to be a king In such wise that
thy friends shall have envy at the / and thou shall dye in that prosperyte /

And know thou for truth / That when thou shall see the Owl over at the
end of five days after thou shall dye for certain / And anon after Tyberyus
deyed / And Gayus was Emperor / which delyuerd heroude out of prison / and
enhaunsed him gloryously / and sent him as king in to Iudee / and anon as he
came he sent his puyssaunce / and set hand to / For to put sum of the
church to affliction / and did do slay James brother of saint Johan
theuangelyst with a sword before the day of ester / And because it was a thing
agreeable and plesed the Jews / He took Peter on ester day / and enclosed him
fast in prison / And would after ester bring him forth and show him to the
people and slay him / but thangel came merueyllously / and vnbond him and losed
his chains / and sent him forth all quyt to the seruyse of prechyng the word
of god / And the felonny of this king suffered not tabyde any discicion of
vengyance / For the next day following he made to come the kepars / For to
begin to tormente them with diverse pains for the fleyng of Peter / but he
was let to do that / that the delyueraunce grieved the^ not / For he went
hastily to Cezarie / And there was smeton of an angelle and deyed / Thus
reherceth Josephus in the book of antyquyte / For when he rode came in to
Cezaree / all the men and wymmen of that prouynce came to him And when the day
came that he should goo in Judgment and take possessyon of the contray / He went
and cladde him with a vestment of tyssue merueylously shynyng of gold and
silver And when the son smote and shone on it / It was more shynyng than the
son / For it was so bright / that no man might behold it / And the
brightenes was like read metal / and gaf fere and dread to them that looked
thereon / and therefore the pride of him was so great / that he better seemed a man
made by craft / than by nature humayn And then the people began to cry and
say / we have seen the till now like a man / But now we confess that thou art
above nature humayn / And thus as he was flatred with honors / and reffused
not dyuyne worshippes / he being there set he saw above his head an owl
syttyng / which was messager of his hasty death / And when he had apperceyued
the owl / And byheld the people that were there assembled and comen at his
commandment / he said to them / certain I that am your lord shall deye
within five days / For he knew it well / because the deuynour had told him
that he should deye within five days that he had see the owl syttyng above him
/ And Incontinent after this thing thus accomplisshed he was smeten sodanly in
such wise that worms ete his bowels and on the fyfte day deyed / And this
says Josephus / And because then in remembrance of the delyueraunce of
Saint Peter prince of thappostles fro the cruel vengaunce of the cruel tyrant
/ which as soon as he was enhaunsed to be king / went to pursewe and destroy
the church / therefore the church haloweth the feste of Saint Peter advincula /
And the epistle is songen in the mass in which this delyueraunce is witnessed
here to be done / The second cause of thestablyssyng of this feste / was by
cause Alysaunder the pope which was the vj after Peter / And hermes provost of
rome which was converted to the faith by the same Alexander were holden in
diverse places in the prison of quyryn the Judge / which Judge said to hermes
the provost / I merueylle of the that art so wise a man / that thou will leave
the great worldly honors that thou have / and the great richesses that thou
receyuest of thy prouostye / And wylt leave all these things for dremyng of an
other life / To whom hermes said / to fore this time I despreysed and scorned /
And wend there had been none other life than this Quyrynus answered / Make prouf
to me that there is an other life / and anon I shall apply me to thy faith /
To whom hermes said / Allexander whom thou hold in thy prison / shall
inform the better than I / Then quyryn cursyd Alexander / And said to him /
I will that thou shall make proef of this thing to me / and thou sendest me to
Alexander / whom I hold bounden in chains for his evil deeds Truly I shall
double the prison upon the and alexander / and I shall set watch upon you /
And if I find the with him or him with the / I shall verily give faith to thyn
and his words And then he doubted their kepars / And showed this to
Alexander / and then alexander prayed to god / And an angelle came to him and
brought him in to the prison to hermes / And when quyryn came to the prison He
fond them both to gydre / whereof he was much admerueylled / and then hermes
recounted to quyryn how Alexander had heled his son and raised him fro death /
And quiryn then said to Alexander / I have a daughter named balbyne / wyiche
is seek of the gout / if thou may hele her / I promise the that I shall
receive thy faith / if thou may get for her health / To whom alexander said
/ Goo anon and bring her to me in to my prison / And quyryne said to him / how
may I find the in thy prison and art here And Alexander said goo thy way anon
/ For he that brought me hither shall sone bring me theder / And Quyryn went
then and fette his daughter / And brought her in to the prison where
Alexander was / and fond him there / and then knelyd down to his feet / And
his daughter began to kiss the chains with which seint Alexander was bounden
hopyng thereby to receive her health / And Saint Alexander said to her / Daughter
kiss not my chains / But seek the chains of saint Peter and kiss them with
devotion / And thou shall receive thy health / And anon Quyryn did do seche the
chains of Saint Peter / and they were founden / And Alexander did the daughter
do kiss them / And anon as she had kyssed them she received her health and was
all hool /

Then Quyryn demanded pardon and foryeuenes / And delyuerd Alexander out of
prison / and received the holy bapteme he and all his meyne and many other /
Then Alexander establysshed this feste to be hallowed alleway the first day of
august / And did do make a church in thonour of seint peter where as he set
the chains And named it saint peter ad vincula / and to that church come
much people at that solempnyte / and the people kyssed there the bonds and
chains of saint peter / The third cause of this establisshement after bid is
this ^ Antoyne and Octauyan were so conjoined to gydre by affynyte / that they
departed between them two thempyre of the world / Octouyen had in thoceydent
ytalye ffraunce and spain / And Antoyne had in the eest / Asye / Ponte and
affrique / Anthoyne was wild Ioly / and rybauldus / and had the suster of
Octauyen to his wife / And left her and took cleopatra which was queen of egypt
/ and for this cause Octauyen had him in great despyte / And went with force of
arms against Anthoyne in Asye / And ouercam him in all things / Then
Anthoyne and Cleopatra fled as vaynquysshed / And slew them self by great
sorrow / And octauyen destroyed entierly the royame of Egypt / and made be
under the Romans And fro thens he went in all the have he might in to
Alexandrye /

And despoyled it of all rychesses and brought them to Rome / And increased so
the common prouffyt of Rome / That there was given for one penny that / which to
fore was sold for four / And because the batayles of the people / had wasted
and destroyed the cite of Rome / he renewed it saying / I fond it couerd with
tyles And I shall leave it now couerd with marble /

And for these causes he was made emperor / And the first that ever was called
Auguste / And of him ben all other that come after him called Augustes / Like
as after his uncle Iulyus Cezar they ben called Cezariens / Also this month of
Auguste which tofore was called Sextilys The people entitled it to his name
and called it Angustus / in thonour and rememberaunce of the victory^e of the
Emperor that he had the first day of this monthe / In so much that all the
Romans made that day great solempnyte unto the time of Theodosye the emperor /
which began to regne the year of our lord CCCCxxvj / Then Eudosie daughter
of the said Theodosyen Emperor and wife of valente / went by a bow to
Iherusalem / And there a Jew gaf to her for great love a great yefte / And
they were the bonds that is to wete the ij chains / with which Saint Peter
under herod was bounden with / Whereof she was much Joyous / And when she
returned to rome / she saw that the Romans hallowed the first day of august in
thonour of an Emperor Paynem which was deed / then was she much sorouful /
by cause they did so much honor to a man dampened / And thought that they
might not lyghtely be wythdrawen fro this custom / But if she might so much
do she would not leave it thus / But that it should be made in thonour of Saint
Peter / And that all the people should name that day / the day of Saint Peter ad
vincula /

And hereof she had collaco^n with saint Pelagyen the pope / And brought them
with fair words to that / that the remembrance of the prince of paynems was
forgoten / And the memory of the prince of thappostles was hallowed / And it
plesed right well to all the people / Then she brought forth the chains
which she had brought fro Iherusalem And showed them to all the people / And
the pope brought forth the chain with which he had be bounden under Nero /
And as soon as that chain touched that other / all three by miracle were but
one / like as they had be never but one / Then the pope and the queen
establysshed that the folisshe relygyon of the people making solempnyte of a
Paynem were changed in to better / And was made of Saint Peter prince of
thappostles / And the pope and the queen set the chains in the church of
saint Peter ad vyncula /

And were given of the queen to the said church right great yeftes / and right
fair preuyleges / and it was establysshed that day to be hallowed over all /
And this is that led says / And Sygybert also says the same of this thing /
And of what great virtue this chain is / It apperyth well in the year of our
lord four hundred and xl iiij /

There was an earl which was nyghe to the Emperor Octone that was so cruelly
vexyd and tormented with the devil to fore all the people that with his owen
trethe he bote and tare him self / And by the commandment of the emperor he
was led to pope Ioh^n for to put the chayns about his neck And there was a
another put about his neck of this wode man and demonyake / ^ And it did him
none alegement / By cause it had no virtue / And at last the very chain of
Saint Peter was brought and put about the neck of the said man Demonyake /
But it was of such virtue that the devil might not bear it / But departed and
went out cryeng tofore them all / Then Theodoryke bishop of Mets took that
chain / and said he would not depart fro it in no manner but if his hand were
cut of / and for this cause was great descorde between the pope and the bishop
and the other clerks / And at last the Emperor appeased the noise And gate
of the pope that he had a lynke of the chain / ^ And he kept it much
Worthily in great devotion / Mylet also recompteth in his cronyque / And is
wreton in thystorie tripertite that in that time there was a great horrible
dragon which apperyd at empyrum / And the bishop donat^ spytte in his mouth /
and killed him forthwith / but that bishop made tofore the sign of the cross
with his fyngres upon the dragon / For he was so great that there behooved seven
cople oxen to draw him thens out of the town / in to a place where he was
brent for by cause ye stenche of him should not corupt the air / yet says the
same mylet / and also it is said in thystorye tripertite / that the devil
apperyd in a town named creta in the semblaunce of moses And this creta is
nygh to a montayne which is nygh to the sea / and assembled a great multitude
of Jews of all places / And brought them to the top and highest of the
montayne / and promised them to lead them and to goo dry foot with them upon
the sea in to the land of promyssyon / And there he assembled people without
nombre / And some believe that the devil had despyte of the Jew that had given
this chain to the queen by which the feste of Octauyen cessed to be made /
And when the devil saw that he had there of the Jews without nombre above ye
great montayne / He made many fall down from the top to the ground bynethe /
And made of them without nombre to be drowned in the sea / And thus the devil
aduenged him on them / And many of them that escaped bycam christian / ffor when
they would have goon up on the montayne with the other they might not go up so
sharp roches / in such wise that they that went up were all to cut with
the stones / And the other were drowned in the sea / and weren all deed / And
when the other would have done the same / and tarryed by cause they wist not
what was happed of the other / certain fysshers going by them told what was
fallen of the other / and thus they that might escape returned and went not
after the other / And al thise things ben contained in the said historye / The
fourth cause of the Instytucion of this feste may be assygned here in this wise
/ ^ For our lord delyuerd saint Peter out of his chains by miracle / And gaf
him power to bind and unbind / ffor we be holden and bounden unto the land
of sin / and have need to be assoyled / Therefore we worship the solempnyte of
the chains afor said / For as he deserved to be unbound of the bonds of his
chains / so received he power of our lord Ih^u crist to assoyle us / And this
last reason may be lightly apperceyued For thou see that thepystle accords
thabsoluco^n and losyng of the chains made to thappostle / And the gospel
records the power that was given to him for tassoyle / And thoryson of the
death requires that absolucion be made to us / And this that sometime he gives
absolucion / And assoylleth the dampened otherwhyle by the power of the kayes
which he received / It apperyth in a miracle of the blessid virgyne marry /
On a time there was a monk a scolyer which was in the cite of coloyne in the
monastery of saint peter which monk was synful and when this monk was
supprysed with sodeyn death / the deuyllis accused him and cried on him that he
had don all manner sins / That one said I am couetyse / which so often thou
have coueyted against the commandment of god / And another said I am vain
glory of which thou have enjoyed the in making a vaunte among men / And
another said I am thy lesyng in which thou often syn^edest in lyeng / And other
in like wise /

And contrary to them some good werkys that he had don excused him saying / I
am obedyence / which thou dydest to thyn elders and soueraynes / Another said
I am the song of psalms that thou have songen to god much ardantly / and
seint peter to whom he was a monk went to god for to pray for him / and our
lord ansuerde to him / has not the prophet said by my Inspyracion / One^ quis
hitabit in tabernaculo tuo / lord who shall dwell in thy tabernacle / or who
shall rest in thy hye holy montayn / he that shall be without spotte of sin /
how may this man then be saved which is not entered without spotte / Ne has
done no rightwisnesse / And yet peter prayed for him with the blessid virgyne
mother of god / Then our lord gaf upon him this sentence / that the soul
should return again to the body and that he should do penance / And then
saint peter with the kay that he held in his hond fered the deuyllis / and made
them to flee / and after delyuerd the soul to a monk of the same monastery /
and commanded him that he should bring it to the body / and he bare it to him /
and required of him for his reward that he had brought it again that he should
say every day for him the psalm Miserere mei deus / and that he should of te
swepe his sepulture and keep it clean / And thus he reuyued fro the death and
came again to the world / and did his penance / and / recompted to all the
people this that had happed to him / Then late us pray this glorious appostle
saint peter to be our advocate to our lord Ihesu christ / that we may by the
power of the kayes given to him have very absolucion of our sins / that
after the accomplyssheme^t of this short and transitory life we may come to ever
lastyng life in heaven amen

Thus ends thistorye of seint Peter ad vincula /
Here follows the life of saint Stephen the Pope /
When saint stephen the pope had converted many of the paynems unto the christian
faith both by word and by example / and had also buried many bodies of the
marters in the year of our lord two hundred and lx he was sought by great
study of valeryen and of galyen then empereurs For by cause that he and his
clerks should do sacrefyse unto their ydolles or ellis to be slain by diverse
tormentis / and the said emperors made ordinance / that who someuer brought
them / he should have all their substance and for that cause x of his clerks
were taken / and brought forth / and anon without audyence were byheded And the
day following saint Stephen the pope was taken and brought to the temple of mars
their god / to the end that he should adoure and do honor to thydolle / or
else he should have sentence to be byheded / But when he was entered in to the
temple he prayed to our lord Ih^u christ that he would destroy the temple / and
anon a great party of the temple fylle / And all they that were there /
ffledde for dread that they had / and then he went to the Cymetoyre of saint
luke / and when valerien herd that / he sent to him mo knights than he did
tofore / and when they came they fond him syngyng mass / And anon he fynysshed
devoutly that which he had begone / And that done the^ byheded him in his
seete /

Thus ends the passion of saint Stephen the pope /
Here follows thynuencion of saint Stephen prothomartir /
THe Inuencion of the holy body of saint Stephen prothomartir was made in the
year of our lord iiijCxvij in the xvij year of honorius the emperor / The
Inuencion of him the translacion / and the conjunction were made by order / For
a pressed named lucyen of the contray of Ih^rlm / Of whom gerard recompteth among
the noble men and writes thus / that on a friday When he was in his led and
rested / and uneath awoke / He saw an ancient man of noble stature with a
long berd with a semely vysage enuyronned in a White mantel / In which there
were litil ouches and crosses of gold tissued / he was hosed with hosen
browdred with gold above which held in his hand a rod of gold / with which
he touched him and said Goo and with great dylygence opene our tombs / For We
ben leyde in a place dyshonest and of despyte / Goo thou therefore unto Ioh^n the
bishop of Iherusalem / and say to him that he lay us in a more honorable
place / And by cause that drought and tribulacion is through the world / God
has ordained to be debonayr and merciful to the world by our suffragyes and
prayers And lucian said to him / Sire who art thou / I am said he gamaliel
which norisshed thappostle poule and enseygned him the law of my faders / And
he that lyyth with me is saint Stephen which was stoned of the Jews / and
cast out of the cite for to be devoured of the bestes and birds / but he kept
him to whom he kept his faith with out hurtyng / And I with great dylygence
took up the body / and With great reverence buried it in my new tomb And that
other that lies with me is Nychodemus my neuewe which went by night to Ih^u
christ / and received bapteme of Peter and Ioh^n / and therefore the princes of
prestes were a^gry with him / and would have sleyne him / but that they left
at reverence of us Nevertheless they took away all his substance / and
deposed him from his pryncypate / and beat him strongly and let him lie for
deed / And then I led him in to my house / where he lived after but a few
days / and when he was deed I buried him at feet of saint stephen / And the
third that is with me is abybas my sone which in the xx year of his age
received bapteme with me / And Was a clean virgyne / and learned the law of god
with my disciple poule / And Ethea my wife and selemus my sone which would not
receive the faith of Ih^u crist were not Worthy to be in our sepulture thou
shall find them buried in a another place / And shall find their tombs void
and idle / and when he had said all this / saint Gamaliel vanysshed away / And
then lucyan awoke and prayed to god if this vysyon were true / that it might
be showed yet the second time and the third time / and the next friday after
following / he appeared like as he did tofore / and said to him wherefore have thou
desdayn to do that which I have required the / and he said to him / Sire I
have no desdayne / but I have prayed god / if it be in his name / that it apere
to me yet onys again / and Gamaliel said to gym because thou have thought in
thy courage / that if thou find us how thou myghtest deuyse the relics of each
of us / I shall ensign the of eueriche by symylitude to know the tombs and
relics of each of us / and then he showed three panyers of gold and the
fourth of silver / of the which that one was full of read roses / the other
tweyne of white roses / And the fourth which was of silver was full of saffron
/ and gamalyel said to him these panyers ben our tombs / and these roses ben
our relics / and the first full of read roses is the tomb of saint Stephen /
which only of us all deserved the crown of martirdom / The other tweyne full
of White roses ben the tombs of me and nychodemus Which perseuered with a
clean heart in the confession of Ih^u christ / and the fourth of silver which
is full of saffron / is of abybas my son / Which shyneth by whytenes of
vyrgynyte / and issued out of this world pure and net / and this said he
vanysshed away / and the friday after that weke following / he apperyd to him
again all angry and blamed him grievously of his delayment and necligence / And
anon lucian went to Iherusalem / and recou^ted all by order to Ioh^n the
bishop / and called the other bishops / and went to the place that was
showed to lucien and When they had begone to delue / and meued therthe a right
sweet savor Was felt / And by the merueyllous flauour and sweetness / and by
the merits of the saints lxx seek men Were heled of their Infirmytees / And
thus the relics of these seyntes Were transported in to the church of syon
which is in Iherusalem / In the which saint stephen used thoffice of
tharchedeken / And there were they ordained for right honorably / In the same
hour descended fro heaven much rain / and of this vision and inuencion bid
makes mention in his cronyke / and this Inuenco^n says saint bid was in the
same day yt his passion is hallowed / and his passion as it is said was the same
day also But the festes have been changed by double reason / The first reason is
by cause that Ih^u christ was borne in earth / that man should be born in heaven
/ therefore it apperteyneth that the feste of Saint stephen should follow the
natyuyte of christ / ffor he was first marterd for criste for to be born in
heaven / and so it signefyeen that the one follow that other / and therefore it is
songen in the church / yesterday christ was born in earth / that this day
stephen should be borne in heaven / the second reason is that the feste of the
Inuencion is more solempnly made than the feste of his passion / and that is
only for the natyuyte of our lord Ihu christ Nevertheless our lord has showed
many miracles in thynuencion of him / And because his passion is more worthy
than his Inuencion / therefore ought it to be more solenpne / and therefore the
church has transported his passion to the time in which it is had in gretter
reverence / And as saint austyn says the translacion of him was in this manner
/ Alexandre senator of constantynople went with his wif to Iherusalem And made
there a fair oratorye to Saint stephen the first martyr / and after his death
he did him to he buried by his body / and seven year after Iuleane his wife would
return in to her country / by cause that the princes did to her wrong And would
carye with her the body of her husbond / and when she had made long request to
the bishop with many prayers / The bishop showed to her two tombs of silver
and said to her / I wot not which of thise tweyne is thy husbond / And she
said to him / I wot well / and went hastily / and enbraced the body of stephen
/ And thus by caase of fortune / when she wend to have taken the body of her
husbond / She took the body of the prothomartir and when she was within the
ship with the body / there was herd hymns and songs of angels / and a right
sweet odor / and the deuyls cried and menyd great tempest saying / Alas / Alas
/ ffor the first martyr stephen passyth her by / which beteth us cruelly with
fire / and the maronners were in great doubt and cried on saint stephen / And
anon he appeared to them and said I am here / doubt ye nothing / and anon
great peace was and fair weder in the sea / Then were there herd the voys of
deuyls cryeng felon prince brenne this ship / For stephen our aduersayre is
within it with that the prince of deuillis sent five deuyllis for to brenne the
ship / but thangel of our lord plunged them down in the ground of the sea /
and when they came to caladoyne the deuyllis cried saying / the servant of god
comes which was stoned to death of the felon Jews / Then came they in
sauete in to Constantynople / and the body of saint stephen was brought with
great reverence in to a church / and this says seint Austyn / the coniunco^n
of the body of saint stephen with the body of seint laurence was made by this
ordenaunce / It happed that throdociane daughter of theodocien the emperor was
greatly tormented thith a devil / and when it was told to her fader / which was
at constantynoble / he commanded that his daughter should be brought thither /
and that she should touch the relyques of saint stephen the first martyr / And
the devil cried within her / if stephen come not to rome / I shall not issue
out of her / For it is the will of thappostles / and when the emperor herd that /
he Impetred and gate of ye clargy and people of constantynoble / that they gaf
to the romans the body of Saint stephen / and they should have therefore the
body of saint laurence / And the emperor Wrote to pelagyen the pope / upon
Which the pape by the counseyl of the cardenallis consented to the request of
the emperor / and then went the cardynallis to constantynople and brought to
rome the body of saint Stephen / And the greeks came for to have the body of
saint laurence / the body of seint stephen was received in to capuan which
gate by their devout prayers the right arm / and builded their church
metropolitan / that is to say tharchebysshops see in thonour of him / and when
the romans were comen to rome they would have borne the body of seint stephen
unto the church of saint Peter ad vincula / they that bare it stood still and
might goo no ferther / And the devil which was in the maid cried ye traueyle
you for naught / For he shall not be here / but with laurence his brother where
as he is / And for this muse was the body born thither / And the maid touched
the body and was all hool / and saint laurence as enioyeng him of the coming
of his brother and smylyng turned him in to that other part of the sepulcre and
made place and left half the place void / And when the greeks set their
hondes for to have born away laurence / they fyl down to therth as they had been
deed / but the pope and the clerks prayed for them and all the people / and
yet uneath with great pain came they to life again at euensong time Nevertheless
they were all deed within x days after / and the latynes and all they that
so consented entered in to frenesye and might not be hool unto the time that the
two bdyes were entombed to gydre And then Was there a voys herd fro heaven
that said / O blessed rome which have enclosed in one tomb the glorious Jewels
/ the bodies of saint laurence of spain and of saint sttephen of / Iherusalem
/ This conjunction was made about the year of our lord ixCxxv / Saint austyn
recounteth in the xxij book of the cite of god / that vi deed bodies were
raised by the Inuocacion and prayers of seint stephen / that is to wete that
there was one / that lay deed / and the name of seint Stephen was called over
him / and he was anon raised to life / Also there was a child which Was sleyne
With a cart^ whom his mother bare to the church of Saint stephen / and Was anon
raised to life / And there was a nonne which was at her last end / and was
born to the church of seint stephen / and there dyed in the sight of all the
people and after she aroos all hool / Also a maid of yponence / of whom her
fader bare her cote to the church of seint Stephen / and after leyd it on the
body of the deed maid / and anon she aroos / And a young man of yponence deyed
/ Aut anon as the body of him was enoynted with the oil of seint stephen he
aroos to life / Another child was born deed to the church of seint stephen and
by the merits of Seint Stephen was anon restablisshed te life / and of this
precious martyr says seint austyn Gamaliel master of the scole / and with a
stole a boute his neck made reuelacion of him / Saul dispoyled and stoned him
/ Ihesu criste wrapped in pour clothes enriched him / and crowned him With his
precious blo^de and stones / and Saint stephen shone in beauty of body in
flower of age / in fair speech of reason wisdom of holy thought in works of
deuynyte he was a strong pyler of the faith of god / For when he was taken and
holden with tongues among the hondes of them stoned him / In the fornais of fire
of faith he was destrayned / smeton demened and beten / the faith encresed and
was not vaynquysshed / And Seint augustyn says in an other place upon this
auctorite hard brain he was not flatred / but put out / He was not tasted /
but hurt / he fered ne trembled not / but was chauffed and in an other place
he says thus / be hold stephen thy felaw / he was a man as thou art / and of
the mass of sin as thou art / and brought with the same prys that thou were
/ he was dekene and radde the gospel / that thou redest or herest / There he
fond wreton love your enemies / And this blessed prothomartir saint Stephen
learned in redyng / and prouffyted and accomplysshed in obeyeng / Then late us
pray devoutly to him that he pray for us to that blessid lord for whom he
suffered death / and prayed for them that pursiewed him / that he pray for us /
and that we may fel^ theffecte of his prayer like as saul did which after
was called Paul the holy doctor and appostle Amen /

Thus ends Thinuencion of Saint Stephen prothomartir
Here follows of saint domynyk / and first of his name /
DOmynyk is said as a kepar of our lord Or else as kept of god / or it is
said domynycus as to thethymologye of this name that is dominus / It is said
kepar of our lord in three manners / that is to wete kepar of thonour of our lord
/ as touching to god kepar of the vyneyarde or of the flock of our lord / unto
his neighbor / Kepar of the will of our lord or of his commaundementis as
touching him self / Secondly he is said domynycus / as kept of our lord Our
lord kept him in his three fold state / of whom the first is / that he was a
lay man / In the second he was a chanon reguler / And the third as appostle /
ffor in the first state he kept him self / in making him self to begin laudably
and well / In the second to perform well / and in the third taccomplissh well In
the third he may be said domynyk by the ethymologye of this name dn^s Dominus
is said as gyuyng menaces gyuyng a yefte / or gyuyng less So saint Domynyk was
gyuyng / that is to understood yeuyng thretenyng by leuyng of Iuiuryes / gyuyng
yeftes by largess of ffraunchyse / for he gaf not only to pour men / But he
would often selle him self for to releue and bye pour men / And in gyuyng less
/ that was by making his body lene / For he gaf alleway less to his body than
it desired or appetited /

Of Saint Domynyk Friar and prechour /
DOmynyk was duke of the order of the freres prechours and a noble fader of the
parties of spain / of a town named callorega of the diocise of oxonyence / and
his fader was named ffelix / and his mother Iohane / of whom he came as of the
flesh and his mother tofore that he was born saw in her sleep that she bare a
little whelpe in her belly / which bare a brennyg brond in his mouth / and
when he was issued out of her womb / He brent all the world / and also it
seemed to a woman that was godmoder to him at font and held him yt the child
domynyk had a sterre right clear in his forhede which enlumyned all the world
And as he was yet a child and in the keeping of his nourice / he was often found
leuyng his bed and lyeng on the bare ground / And after When he was sent to
palentyne for to learn / he tasted ne drank never wine in x year And when he
saw that great famyne was there he sold his books and al his substance / and
gaf the prys of them to pour people / and wha^ his good renome grew / he was
made chanon reguler of the bishop of oxonyence in his church / And after he
was myrrour of life unto the people / and was ordained subpryour of the chanonnes
/ and day and night he intended to read / in prayeng god cotynuelly that he
would give him grace that he might estende to the health of his neighbors / In
the book of collaco^ns of faders he read curyously and took therein great
perfection / he went with the said bishop to tholous / And there he
reprehended his host of heresye / and converted him to the faith of Ihesu
christ / And presented him to our lord / as an handful of the first fruit of
the to coming harvest / It is read in the gestys of the earl of mounfort /
that on day as seint domynyk preached against the heresies / that he put in
writing the auctoritres that he purposed / And delyuerd the cedule to an
heretic for to argue against his objections / and that night the heretics
assembled at the fire / and showed to them that sedule / and they bad him to
cast it in the fire / And if the cedule brenned their faith was not but
trecherye / And if it brenned not / then he preached the very faith of the
church of Rome / And then was the cedule cast in the fire / And when it had
be in the fire a while / it sprang out al sauf / And then one of them that
was more hard than the other said cast it in again yet / And we shall preue
better and more plainly the truth / Then it was thrown in again / and it
issued out again without brennyng / Then said he late it be cast in the
third time / And then shall We know without doubt the issue of this thing /
and it was cast in again / And it came out the third time without lesyon or
hurt / And yet the heretics abydyng in their hardness swear emonge them
fermlye that none of them should publisshe this thing / nevertheless a knight
that was there which was somewhat according to our faith disclosed this miracle
/ and it is said asemblable thing happed at the mount victorial in the temple
Jupiter / that a disputaco^n was ordained against the heretics / like as the
maladye of theresye grew in the Parties of albegeys / that disputacion
solemn was at the temple of Iupyter / and Were ordained Iuges on both patyes
/ To Whom thaffyrmacion of the faith that eueriche should ensygne should be
wreton in a book / And the book of saint domynyk was chosen and presented among
the other / Upon the Which the Iuges stroof against them / how be it It was
ordained that the books of one part and that other should be cast in to the
fire / And they that brenned not should be holden with out doubt for the very
faith / and so the books were thrown in to a great fire brennyng And anon the
book of the heresies Was brent / and the book of saint domynyk only was saved
and not burnt / But sprang out of the fire without hurtyng and it was cast in
the second time / and it lepe out without brennyng / And after this the other
christian men went home again to their proper places / and the bishop of
oxonyence deyed / and saint Domynyk abode there allone with a few christian men
and catholyque against the heretics / And denounced and preched the word of
god fermely And thaduersaryes of troth mocked him / and spitte at him / and
threw at him filthe of the streets and other right foul things / And bond
behynd him wyspes of straw in great despyte / And when they thretened and
menaced him / he answered Without fere or dread / I am not worthy to be marterd
/ ne I have not yet deserved that death by glory / And therefore he passyd
hardyly by the way where they despised him / and song and Went Ioyously / And
they merueyled and said to him / have thou no dread of death / what would
thou have done if we had taken the / I had prayed you said he / that ye should
not have slain me suddenly / But lytil and lytil ye should have hewn membre fro
membre / one after a another / and then that ye had showed tofore mine eyes my
members so detrenched / and then that ye had left my body so lyeng and foul^d
in my blood / without to have slain me at your will / He fond a man that for
the great pouerte that he suffered was Joined to the heretykes / and saint
domynyk seeing this / ordained him self to be sold / and that the prys of him
should be given to the pour man to bring him out of his pouerte / And this did
he for to bring him of the foul error that he was in / And so he would have been
sold if not the deuyne mercy had not otherwise pourueyed Another time a woman
came to complain to him that her brother was in the hondes of the sarasyns in
great captyuyte / And that she knew no way how to deliver him / And he was
meuyd of pity in his heart / And offered him self to be sold for the redempcyon
of that other / But god that knew him more necessary for the redempcyon
spirituel of many caytyues suffrid it not / and yet he intended to be his
pledge and to lie for him / his charity was so great / In a time he was lodged
With certain ladies which by occasion of relygyon they had be desceyued of the
heretics / and then he fasted and his felawe with him all the lent with
bread and water / so that by the shadow of relygyon he took fro them that
error / and in the night he woke sauf when necessyte was / he lay down under a
table without other thing / And thus thise wymmen were brought to the knowleche
of truth / and then began he to think of thestablisshement of his order /
and of what office it might be / For to goo and preche through the world / and
for tenhaunce the christian faith against the heretics / And when he had dwelled
x year in the parties of toulouse after the death of the bishop of oxonyense /
unto the time that the counseyl should be solempnysed at latranense / Then he
Went to rome with Faucon bishop of toulouse to the counseyl general for to
get of Innocente the pope that the order which is said the order of the
prechours might be confermed to him and to his successors / And the pope would
not lyghtely accord to this thing / And then it happed on a night that the
pope saw in a vision that the church of latronense Was suddenly menaced for to
fall and overthrow / and as he beheld it all aferd / he saw on that other
side / seint domynyk rennyng against it and sustained / and bare it up and kept
it (...) falling / and then awoke the pope / and understood the vision and
received Ioyously the petico^n of the man of god And badde that he and his
brethern should seche sum Rewle approved / and he would conferme it at his will
/ and then saint domynyk came to his brethern and showed to them What the pope
had said / and they Were of nombre / about xvj or xvij freres / which anon
called counseyl of the holy ghoost and chosen the rule of saint Austyn prechour
and holy doctor / and would of one will be in deed and name prechours / and
establisshed therewith sum customs more strayter in their living which they
took above / and promised to keep them truly / In this time Innocent the pope
deyed / and honorius was made pope and souerayn bishop of the church / and he
gate of the same honorius the confirmacion of his order in the year of our lord
a MCCxvj / And on a time as he prayed at rome in the church of saint peter for
thencreacyng of his order he saw coming to him the glorious princes of
thappostles Peter and poule / And him seemed that Peter gaf to him the staff
first / And saint poul delyuerd to him the book and they said to him / goo and
preche / For thou art chosen of god to do that occupacion / and mynysterye /
and in a litil moment him seemed that he saw his sons sprad through out the
world two and ij prechyng to the people the word of god / For which cause he
came again to toulouse / and departed his brethern sum to paris / sum in to
spain / And other to boloyne / and he returned again to Rome / There was a
monk before thestablysshement of this (...) which was rauysshed in spirit
and saw the blessed virgyne our lady Seint marie knelyng with her hands
joined prayeng her son for the humayn lygnage / and he often Withstode her
request / and at last he said to her that so besily required him / mother
what may I do more for them / I have sent to them patriarchs and prophetis /
and litil have they amended them / after I came to them my self / and after that
I have sent to them appostles / And they have sleyn them / I sent to them also
martirs / confessors and doctors And they accorded not to them ne to their
doctrine / but by cause it apperteyneth not to me / to wythsay thy request I
shall give to them my prechours / by whom they may be enlumyned and made clean
or else I shall come against them / my self if they will not amend them / And
another saw that same time when the xij abbottes of ye order of Cystews were
sent to tholous against the heretics / For When the sone had ansuerd to his
mother as is above said The mother said to him / Fair sone thou ought not to
do to them after their malice / but after thy mercy / To whom the sone
vaynquysshed by her prayers said / I shall yet do to them mercy at thy
request / For I shall send to them my prechours / that shall warn and inform
them / And if then they not correct them / I shall spare them no more / A
Friar menour that long time had be fellow with seint fraunsoys recounted to
many of the freres of the order of the prechours / that when seint domynyke was
at rome for the confirmaco^n of his order of the pope / he saw on a night Ih^u
crist in thayer holdyng three speres in his hand / and brandysshed them against
the world / and his mother ran hastily against him / and demanded him what he
would do / And he said to her / all the world is full of vices / of pride / of
luxurye / and of Avarice / and therefore I will destroy them with these three
speres / Then the blessed virgyne fill down at his feet and said / Dear sone
have pity / And tarry thy Justice by thy mercy / and Ihesu christ said to her /
see thou not how many wrongs and Iniuryes they do to me / and she answered /
Sone attempre thy wrath / and tarry a lityll I have a true servant and a
noble fighter against the vices / which shall run oueral and vaynquysshe the
world and subdue them under thy seygnorye And I shall give to him a another
servant in to his help that shall fight as he does / and our lord her sone
said I am appeased and receive thy prayer but I would see / whom thou will
send in so great an office / And then she presented to him saint domynyk /
And Ih^u christ said / truly this is a good and a noble fyghter / and shall
do dilygently that thou have said / And then she showed to him and offryd to
him seint ffraunsoys / and he preysed him / as he did the first / And Saint
Domynyk considered dylygently his felawe in that vysyon / For he had never seen
him before / and he fond him on the morn in the church / and knew him by
that he had seen him in the vysyon without other shewer / and began to kiss
him / and said thou art my felawe / thou shall run with me / and we shall be
to gydre / and none aduersarye shall surmounte us / And then he recounted to
him all by order the said vysion / and fro then forthon / they Were one heart
and one soul in our lord / And commanded that this love should be kept to
them that should come after them perdurably / And when on a time Saint domynyk
had received a nouyse in to thordre / Some that had been his felawes perverted
him / in such wise that he would return to the world / And demanded after his
gown / and when seint domynyk herd that / he went to prayer / and as the young
man had despoyled him of his relygyous clothyng / and they had don on him his
sherte / he began to cry with an hye voys and say / I chauffe I brenne /
certainly I am all burnt / do of / do of this cursed sherte which brenneth
al my body / And might not endure in no wise til he was despoyled of this
sherte and clothed again with his relygyous clothes / and brought again in to
the cloystre of the religious And when saint domynyk was at boleyne / what time
the freres were goon to sleep / A friar converse began to be tormented of the
devil / and when ffrere Reyner of losanne knew it / he said it to saint
domynyk / And saint domynyk commanded that he should be brought in to the
church tofore the altar of our lady / and x ffreres might uneath bring him /
And then said Saint domynyk / I conjure the wicked spyryte that thou tell to
me wherefore thou vexyst thus the creature of god And wherefore and how thou
entredest here / And he answered I vex him / ffor he has deserved it / He
drank yesterday in the cite without license of the priour / and made not the
sign of the cross thereon / and I entered then in sign of a botel to the end
that he should drink me With the win the sonner / Then it was founden that he
had dronken in the town / And in the mean while / he made the sign of the
cross and they ronge to matyns / and when the devil herd that / he said I may
no longer abide here / Sith they with the great hoodes arise / and thus he was
constrained by the prayer of Saint domynyke to issue and goo his way and the
friar was delyuerd and hool / and was well ware ever after to do against the will
of the pryour / And as saint domynyk on a time came to a river toward the
parties of toulouse / his books Which had a custodye fyl in the water / and
could not find them / but must leave them behynd him / And the third day after
/ a fisshar cast his hoke in to the water / and supposed to have teken up some
great fysshe / And drew up the books of saint domynyk with out any wetyng /
like as they had been kept dylygently in an almarye / and on a time When he came
to a monasterye / And all the brethern were at rest / and he Would not
destrouble ne awake them / he put him to prayer / and entered in with his felawe
/ the yates being shette and closed / also in like wise in the conflicte of
theretikes as he was with a converse of the cystews in an euentyde and came to a
certain church / and fond hit shytte and closed / he made his prayers and
suddenly they were in the church / and abode there all that night in prayer /
And when he had prayed he had always a custom to stau^che his thurst at so^me
well or fontayn lest he should have any desire to drink in the house of his
host / There was a scolier in the hows of the freres at boloyne for to here
mass / and hit happed that saint domynyk sang the mass / and when it came to
the offryng the scolier Went and kyssed the hand of Saint domynyk with great
devotion / and when he had kyssed it / he felt come out of his hand so great
swetenes / and so sweet an odor / as he ever had felt to fore in his life /
and fro than forthon the Ardeur and brennyng of lecherye began to wexe cold in
him / so that he which tofore had been vayn and lecherous was after so
contynent / that his flesh shone all of clerenes and chastity / and the
flesh of saint domynyk shone much of great chastyte and purete / of whom the
odor cured the filthes of the thought / There was a priest which saw saint
domynyk so ardantly in his predycacion With his felawes / and he concluded in
him self that he would Join him to them / if he might have a book of the new
testament / necessary to him for to preche / and as he thought this / there
came a young man beryng a book of the new testament to selle under his vestement
/ and anon the priest bought it with great Joy / But as he doubted yet a lytil
he made his prayer to almighty god / and made the cross upon the book without
forth and sithe opened the book and looked within forthwith / and the first
chappytre that he fond was in the acts of thappostles / that / Which is
said to Peter came first to his sight / which was this Arise up descend and
goo with them nothing doubtyng / For I have sent them / Then he went and
Joined him to them / On a time when a noble master in science and in fame was
regent in toulouse in theologye / On a morning tofore the day while he purueyed
his lessons / he was surprised with sleep / and enclyned him on his chayer a
lytil / and him seemed that seven sterres stood tofore him / and as he
merueylled of the nouuelte of this / the said sterres grew suddenly in to so
great light that they enlumyned all the world / and when he awoke / he was
strongly amerueylled / and when he entered in to the scoles / and as he read /
saint Domynyk with vj freres of the same habit entered and came amyably to him /
and showed their purpoos and said / that they coueyted to haunte his scoles /
Then this master remembered his vision / and doubted not but thise were the
seven sterres that he had seen / When saint domynyke was on a time at Rome /
Master Reynold of saint Aman deene of Orleaunce / which was wise in the law
Canon / And had been five year doctor was comen with the bishop of Orleaunce
to the sea / for to pass in Rome / And had been long in purpoos for to have
left the world / and to entende to prechyng / but he was not yet auised how he
might accomplisshe it / and when he had herd thynstytucion of thordre of the
prechours of a cardynal / to whom he had told his will he called saint
domynyke / and exposed to him his purpoos / And then he had counseylle to
enter in to the order / But without taryenge he was taken with so grievous
sekenes / that he was in despayr of his health / And then saint domynyk prayed
hertely to our blessid lady / the vyrgyne / to whom he had commysed all the
order / that she would give to that deen health for a little time / And suddenly
the queen of mercy came with three maidens / And Reynold wakyng / and abydyng the
death / saw her come to him / and our lady said to him / be of good chere /
require of me What thou wylt / And I shall give it to the / And as he thought
what he should require / one of the maidens said to him softely / that he should
require nothing / but to commytte him all to her will /

And when he had so done / then she put forth her vyrgynal hand / and
touched his eres his nosethrellis / mouth hands / feet / and raynes / and
enoynted them with the oynemente of health Which she had brought with her in
saying propyrly the form of the words / which apperteyne to the members And
she said to the raynes / these raynes be restreyned with the girdel of chastyte
/ And then she turned to the feet And said I enoynte these feet / in
preparacion of theuangely of pees / And she said / I shall send to the an
Ampulle / for to restablysshe the to full health And then she showed to him the
habyte of the order / and said to him / This is the habyte of thine order And
saint domynyke being in prayer saw all this vysyon / And on the morn saint
domynyke came to him / and fond him all hoole / And herd of him all the
ordinance of the vysyon / and he took thabite that the vyrgyne showed to him /
For to fore the freres used surplys / And the thirdde day the mother of god was
there / and enoynted the body of Reynold that she took not only awey the hete
of fevers / but also extyncted and quenchyd the ardour of luxurye / like as he
confessyd after / that one only meuyng of luxurye was not after in him / And
this vysyon saw again a relygyous man of the hospytal with his own eyes /
being present saint domynyk / and was astoned thereof / And this vysyon saint
domynyk publysshed to many brethren after this death / Then was reynold
sent to boloyne and intended much ardauntly to prechyng / and encreaced the
nombre of the freres / And after that he was sent to paris / And a while after
he deyed in our lord / There was a young man of the Cardynal esteuen fylle with
his horse in to a dyche / And was drawn out thereof all deed / and offryd to
saint domynyk And he made his prayers / and the young man restablysshed to life /
In the chirch of saint Sixte A mason had be hired of the freres / for to
repair the broken walls / And a piece of the wall fyl upon the man / and slew
him / but saint domynyke commanded / that the body should be brought to him /
And anon by the help of his prayers / he was restablysshed to life and to
health / In the same church at rome on a time there were forty freres / and
they had but little bread / Then saint domynyke commanded to put the bread in
three parties / that there was / And as soon as each of them had broken a
morselle of bread with joy / there came two yo^g men of ye same habit and
form which entrid in to ye refectory or fraitour and the lappes of their
mantels ye henge on their neck were full of bread and wha^ they had given it al
fully to saint domynyk they departed so suddenly / yt none of them wist whens
they came ne whider thy went and then saint domynyk gaf forth with his hand
here and there to the freres and said Now ete my brethren / When saint
Domynyke on a time was in his iourneye grievously troubled with greet floodes
of rain he made / the sign of the cross / and chaced awey the rain fro him
/ and fro his felawe like as he had a pauyllon upon him / and the ground was
al weet about him / And no drope came nyghe him the space of three cubits / On
a time as he passid by ship toward the parts of thoulette / the shipman
demanded of him a penny for his passage / And the holy man of god promised to
him the kingdom of heaven / for his labor saying that he was the disciple of
Ihesu crist / And that he bare neither gold n^ silver / ne money / And he drew
him forsybly by the cope / and said thou shall leave here thy cope / or thou
shall pay to me a penny / The good man of god lift up his eyes to heaven / and
^raid a little / And as he had a little thought / he looked upon the ground / and
saw a penny / which without doubt was procured by the will of god / Then
said he / loo my brother take hit there / and let me goo in pees It happed on a
time / that when this holy man saint domynyke was in his vyage / A relygyous
man / which was of good conuersacyon / and holy acompanyed with him but he was
of a strange langage / And they were sorry / that they couthe not understand
each other / for to comfort each other / And they prayed and gate grace of our
lord / that in three days that they went to gyder / what by signs / and what
by words each of them understood / what that other mente / There was a man /
which was vexyd with many deuylles / And was offryd and brout to him And he
took a stole and put it about his own neck / and after bounded about the
neck of the demonyake / and commanded them that were in him / that fro thens
forthon they should tormente no more that man / and anon they were tormented
within him / and baganne to cry / late us goo / wherefore constreynest thou for
to be so tormented And he said / I shall not let you goo / tylle ye have
given to me pledge that ye shall not return again / And they said what
pledge may we give to you / And he said the holy martirs that resten in yonder
Church / And they said / we may not / For enmerytes require it not / And he
said ye must needs give them / or I shalt not suffer you to goo quyte / And
they answered / that they would done their pain / And a little while after they
said / how be it / that we be not worthy / We have gotten that the holy martyrs
shall be our pledges / And he required them to have a sign and token of this
thing / And they said / goo to the shryne / where the heedes of the martirs ben
/ and ye shall find them / reuersed and turned / And then he went / and
fond like as they had said / And as he prechid on a time / sum ladies / that
had been deceived of heretykes ^^^eled at his feet / and said to him / Servant
of god / help us / if it be true that thou prechest / The spyryte if error
has blinded our sins /

And he said / be ye form / and tarry a little / and ye shall see / what lord
ye have served / And anon they saw spring out of the myddell of them / a
Catte right horrible / which was more than a greet dog / And had great eyes
and flawmyng Her tongue long brood and blody / and long unto the nauel / He
had the tayll short / and raised up on high / and showed the after end /
which way he turned him / Out of which there issued a terryble stenche / And
when he had turned hither / and thither among the ladies long / At the last
he mounted up by the belle rope in to the steple / and vanysshed awey leuyng a
great stenche after him / And the ladies thanked god / and were converted to
the feyth Catholyque / when he had / ouercomen sum heretykes in the parties
of thelouse / And they were condemned to be burnt / he saw one among them /
which was named Reymond / And he said to the mynystres / keep ye this man
that he be not burnt in no manner with the other / And then he said to him /
spekyng swetely to him / I know well sone / that thou shall yet be a good man /

And he was left / and abode twenty year in his euylle heresye / and in the^de
he was converted / and was a Friar prechoure in that order / and fyuysshed his
life well and laudably / And as he was on a time in spain accompanied with
sum freres / he saw in a vysyon a right great dragon / which swolowed in to
him the brethren that were with him / And when he understood this vysyon / he
warned his brethren to resist strongly the fend their enemy And a little
while after / all the freres / except friar Adam and two Conuersys departed
from him / And he demanded one of them / if he would go also / And he said
nay fader / I shall not love the head / for to follow the feet And anon he
gaf him self to prayer / and converted almost al by his prayer He was at saint
Syxte on a time at Rome / And suddenly the holy ghooste lyghted on him / And he
called his brethren in to the chappytre / And said apertely to fore them all
/ that four of his brethren should deye shortly / two in body / and tweyne
in soul / And anon two freres deyde in our lord / And tweyne departed out
of thordre He was on a time at Boloyne / and a friar an Almayn born named
Conrade with him / whom the freres desired much to have in to thordre / And
as saint domynyk spak to the pryour of cassamarye of the Cystews in the Vygyle
of thassumpcyon of our lady of certain matter / And he said to him by amyable
affyaunce / I tell to the pryour a thing / which I never yet said to no man /
ne thou shall never tell hit / as long as I shall live and that is this / I
never yet required thing of god in this life / but that I had my desire / and
the said pryour said to him that perauentur he should deye before / And saint
domynyk by the spyryte of prophecye said to him / that he should live long
after him / And the pryour said to him / Fader / require master co^rade /
that he give him self in to thordre For the Freres desire him much / And he
said / brother thou requyrest a much hard thing / Then when complyne was
said / the other freres went to rest / And he abode in the church / and did
as he had be acustomed all the night to be in oryson and prayer / And when
the freres assembled at pryme / And the chau^tor bagan Iam lucis orto / Master
Conrade came suddenly / which desired to be sterred with new light and fylle
done alte feet of saint Domynyk / And required thabyte of thordre / And
received it perseuerantly / And he was right relygyous / and a gracyous lector
often in thordre / which as he lay in deyeng / and had c^osed his eyes / the
freres had wend he had been deed And he opened his eyes / And lokyng about
said / Dominus vobiscu^ / which is to say / our lord be with you And they
answered / Thy spyryte be with god / And then said he / All Christian sowles
by the mercy of God / may rest in pees / And forthwith he deyde and rested in
our lord / Saint domynyk was of much steadfast equalite of thought / but if
he had be meued by pity and by mercy / For he had a joyous heart / a peasyble
vysage of a man within forth / the conpunction appeared outward / and that
showed debonayrte / In the day time / there was none more common to his felawes
and brethren in all honest / And at hours in the nyt and in his prayers /
there was none more steadfast / The day he departed to his neighbors / And the
night to god / his eyes were like a well of teres / And often when our lords
body was lift up at mass / he was so rauysshed in his mind / as he had
seen Ihesu crist in his flesh / For which cause / he would not much here
mass with the other / he had a custom right comune / for to wake all the
night in the church / In such wise / that sold he rested in his bed for to
sleep / and when he was weary and necessite of sleep / constreyned him / He
rested him tofore an altar enclyned / or have a stone under his heed / he
received with his propre hand three times in the night discyplyne with a chain
of iron that one for him self / ye other for ye sinners yt ben in the world /
and the third them that been tormented in purgatory He was on a time chosen to
be bishop in Coreacense / but he refused utterly affermyng to leave rather the
earth / than to consent to thelection / that was made to him / It was asked of
him on a time wherefore he duellyd not more gladly in the dyocese of thoulete
than in the diocise of carcossone / And he said that in the dyocise of
thoulette / I find much people which honor me / And in carcassone it is all the contrary / For there all men assaylle me / It was demanded of him by a
man / In what book he most studied / and he answered / in the book of charity
/ On a time the holy man Domynyke woke in the chirch of Boloyne / And the
devil appyered to him in the form of a friar / And saint domynyk had supposed
that he had been a friar / and made him a sign that he should goo to rest with
the other freres / And he made to him signs ageyn in mockyng him / Then
saint domynyke would know / what he was that so despised his commandment /
and lyghted a candel at lamp / and beheld him in his face / And he
confessid that he was the devil / And when he had blamed him strongly / anon
the devil enjoyed him / that he had made him broken his scilence / And saint
domynyk said / that he might well speak as prioure and master of the freres /
And constreyned him to say / whereof he tempted the freres in the quyer / he
said / I make them to come late / and to goo out erly / Then he brought him
in to the do^tour / And asked him whereof he tempted the freres there / and he
said I make them sleep long / and arise late / and thus I keep them fro
dyuyne service / and in the mean while to have unclean thoughts / And after he
ladde him in to the refectorye or fraytour / and demanded him / whereof he
tempted them there / And then the deuylle sprange upon the tables / and said
oftymes / now more / now less / And when the saint asked him what he mente
thereby / he said I tempte some freres to take much mete / by which they be
let to do gods service / and sum that they take less / than they should
do / for to make them over feeble to keep the obseruaunces of their order After
he brout him in to the parloure or locutorye / and demanded him whereof he
tempted the brethren there / then he put out his tongue often / and made a
merueylous son of confusyon / And the saint demanded him what he mente
thereby / And he said / this plare is al mine / For when the freres ben assembled
to speak / I tempte them that they speak confusedly / and that they meddle
words without prouffyte / and that one tarry ne abide not tille the other
have spoken / And at last he brought him to the chapyter / but when he was
tofore the door of the chappytre he would in no wise enter in / And said / I
shall not come in there never / For this is a cursed hows / and is hell to me
/ For what someuer I win in other placys / I lose all here for when I have
made any friar to sin by any negligence / he purges him anon of that
negligence in this place of malediction / and accuses him to fore all the
brethren / For they be here warned Confessed / accused / beten / and assoylled
/ And I here lose all / whereof I sorrow / for lesyng of that I ioyed to have
wonnen in other places / And when he had said all this he vanysshed away / And
in the end when the term of his pylgremage approached / he was at boloyne /
And began to languysshe by grievous infirmyte of his body / And the
dissolucion of his body was showed to him by a vysyon / for he saw a right
fair yonglyng / which called him and said thus / Come my friend / come to
Joys / come / And then he assembled twelve freres of the Covent of Boloyne /
And to the end that he would not leave them / and disheryted / and orphans / he
made his testament and said / These ben the things / that I leave to you /
possede by ryghtfull heritage / as to my sons / First to have charity / to
keep humylyte / to possede voluntary pouerte / and exhorted as much / as he
might straytely that there should be none temporelle possessions in his order /
And that he that should presume to touch and foul the order of friar prechours
with erthely rychesses / he prayed ferdfully / that he should have the
maledictyon and curse of god almighty / and of him And the Freres made much
sorrow of his departing / And he in recomfortyng them swetely said / My
brethern late not my departing trouble you / and doubt ye nothing / For ye
shall have me more profitable deed than living And he came to his last hour in
the year of our lord MCCxxj / And so slepte in our lord Ihesu christ / whose
departing out of this world was showed the same day and the same hour to the
friar general then priour of the prechours of bryxia / And afterward to the
bishop of the same cite in this manner / For as he slepte a light sleep the
heed enclyned to a wall / he saw the heaven opene / and put down to the earth
two white laddres / Of which Ihesu christ and his mother held the end on high
/ And the angels descended and ascended by the ladres singing In the mids of
the ladders there was a sete set / And upon the sete satte saint domynyk with
his heed coured like a friar / And Ihesu christ and his mother drew up the
laddres in to heaven so hye / that he that sat / was lift up in to heaven / and
then the opnyng of heaven was shette and closed / And thenme the same friar
came to boloyne / And fond that the same day and the same hour saint domynyk
deyed / There was a friar named raoul which was that time that he deyd at tybur
/ And went to the altar to sing mess / And when he came to the canon in
which is remembered the living men / he thout to pray for the health of saint
domynyk / And suddenly he was rauysshyd in his mind and saw the holy man saint
domynyk crowned with a crown of gold laureate / And going out of boloyne by
the way royal / And then he marked the day and hour and fond that saint
domynyk was then deed / And when the body of him had leyen long under earth
/ And myraclees showed whythoute seassyng / And that his holiness might not be
hid / There issued and came out of the place where he lay a right great odor
the same time when his tomb was opned wiche was bonden with iron bonds and
instruments and semente / And the stone take away and the body translated to
an hyer place / And the odor surmounted all aromaty^^ / Ne there was none
odor like to that / And yt was not only in the bones of ye holy body / But in
the pouldre and cheste and in all therthe about was like savor / In such
wise as the earth was born in to fer regyons / And retained long the same
odor / And this odor also abode in the hands of the freres that had touched
sum things of the holy relykes / that how well that they were wasshen and
fro^^n / Yet retained they long and many days the sweet odor / And bare
witness of the sweet flauour and eyer In the prouynce of hongrye a noble man /
His wife and his son went to visit in a church the relikes of saint domynyk
/ And the son was seek and came to his last end and deyd And the fader leyde
the corpse of the child to fore the altar of saint domynyk and began to weep
and say / Blessed domynyk I came to the all glad and Ioyeful but alas I goo
home soroufully / I came with my son but I return without him / Yield to me
ageyn my sone / Give to me again the gladness of my heart / And about
mydnyght the child reuyued and went about in the church / There was a young
man which was serf and bond to a young lady / and went to fysshe in a water /
and be fylle therein and was drowned / and he was a long while in the water /
and was drawn out al deed And the lady prayed saint domynyk for the reysyng of
him / and promised that she would goo barefoot unto his relikes / and if he were
raised she would make him a friar / and quyte him his bondage / and he aroos up
tofore them al / and she acomplisshyd her auowe In that same prouynce of
hongrye There was a man that wept by cause that his sone was deed and preyd
saint domynyk for his reysyng to life / and about the cock crownyng / the deed
body aroos and opened his eyes saying to his fader / Whefore fader have ye your
face so weet / And he said sone they be the teres of thy fader / For thou were
deed / And I remained allone and sorouful / And he said fader ye wept much /
but saint domynyk had pity of your weeping / and gate by his merytes to render
me to you all hool / A seek man there was which had been xviij year blind /
and desired to vysite the relics of seint domynyk as prouyng and assayeng
aroos out of his bed / And anon he felt so great virtue in him self that he
began hastily to goo / and the more he went / the more he was strenger to goo
and the more clerlyer he saw / and when he came / he received perfyght health /
In that prouynce a lady ordained to do sing a mass in thonour of saint
domynyk / and she fond not the priest at hour due / And she wrappyd three
candellys that she had made ready in a toweyll / and leyde them in a vessel /
And then she turned her a lytyl and after came again and fond her candelles
enlumyned and brennyng appertly and each body ran for to see this great
meruaylle / and abode there so long till the candellys were brent without
enpeyryng of the towayll / There was a scoler at boloyne which was named
Nycholas which suffered great pain in his raynes and in his knees / so that he
had none hope of health / and auowed to saint domynyk and took a threde to make
a candel of his length / and mesured him in length and bread / And when the
threde atteyned to his knees he called at every mesure the name of Ih^u christ
and of saint domynyk anon he felt allegeau^ce / and said I am delyuerd and
aroos up and wept for joy / and came to the church without any aid / where
the body of saint Domynyk restyd / and god showed for him miracles without
nombre in that cite / In Auguste the cite of cecylle was a maid which was
seek of the stone / and should have been cut / and for this paryll her mother
commanded her to saint domynyk / and the night following saint domynyk came to
the maid slepyng / and leyde in her hand the stone with which she had been
tormented / And then she awoke / and fond her self delyuerd of the pain /
and delyuerd to her mother the stone / And told her vysyon by order / And the
mother bare the stone to the freres / And they henge it tofore thymage in mind
and remembrance of this fair miracle that saint domynyk had done In palacye in
scicile there was a pour woman that had a sone which was gretely tormented
with scrophules / which children ben wont to have in their neck / and could
find no remedy she auowed to god and to saint domynyk that if he might be
deliuerd / she would make him to labor in the works of the church of freres
for no hyre but gladly for naught / and the night following / a man appiered to
her in thabyte of a friar / and said woman know thou thyes things / and
named to her iiij things / that was Arayn ve^t / pelletre / lapacium / and the
Iuse of porret / and she said she knew them well and he said goo and take
these things and confyte them with the Iuse of porret and leye on the sore of
the neck of thy son / and he shall be al hool / Then she awoke and did so
and he was all hool / and the mother accomplisshed her vow / There was a man of
piemo^nt swollen like a monstre / auowed him to saint domynyk / and he apperid
to him in his sleep / and opened his belly without pain and took out all
thordures and enoynted him with his holy hand and heled him parfyghtly In the
cite of August when in the ^est / of the translacion of Seint Domynyk certain
wymmen were at solempnytees of the masses / and when they returned homward to
their houses / they saw without a woman that spynned in the feste of one so
great a saint / and they took and repreued her charitably why she spanne at the
feste of one so great a saint / and she was angry and ansuerd / ye that be
wymmen of the freres / keep ye their festes / and anon the eyes of that woman
swellyd and there came out roten matter and there issued worms so that one of the
neighbors took xvij worms out of her eyes / And then she repented her and
came to the church of the freres and confessyd her sins / And auowed that fro
than forthon she would never myssaye to the servant of god domynyk / but should
devoutly hold his feste / and anon she was made hool / here was a Nonne named
marye which was seek at Crypolyn in the monastery of Marie magdaleyn / and was
smyton in the thye so grievously that five months during they doubted that she
would have deyed / and then she bethoughte her / and prayed thus in her self /
lord god I am not worthy to pray to thene to be herd of the / but I pray my
lord saint domynyk / that he be medyatour between the and me that he may get
to me the benefeite of health / And when she had long prayed in teres / she
slepte and saw saint domynyk With two freres that opened the curtayn that
henge before her bed / and entryd and said to her / Wherefore desire thou so
sore to be heled / And she said sir that I might more devoutly serve god / And
then he drew out his oynement which was of sweet odor from under his cope
/ and enoynted her thye / and she was anon all hool / and said this oynement
is much precious sweet and light / And when she demanded how it was named he
said to her / this oynement is the oynement of love / and is so precious that
it may not be bought for no prys / For in the yeftes of god is no better than
love / For there is nothing more precious than charity / but it is sone lost if
it be not well kept / Then he appeared to her suster that night that slepte in
ye dortour saying / I have heled thy suster which anon aroos and ran thither
and fond her hool / And When she felt her enoynted with sensible unction /
she wyped it with great reverence with a bendel of sylke / And when she had
told all this to the abbess / to her suster and to her confessor / and had
showed the unction and bendel they were smyten with the nouelte of the savor
so suete smellyng that it might not be compared to none Aromatyke / and they
kept that unction with great reverence / how agreeable the place is unto god
where the body of saint Domynyk rests / how be it that many miracles ben
showed there / yet one shall I say to you here and that shall suffyse /
Master Alysaundre bishop of vendosm reherseth in his postillys upon this
word / Mercy and truth have met to gydre / That a scolyer duellyng at
boleygne which was all given to wicked vanytees of ye world saw a vysyon /
That him seemed he was in a great field / and that a great tempest of thondre
and lightnyng descended from heaven upon him / and then he fled the tempest /
and came tofore an hows and fond it shette / and knocked at door for to enter
in / and thostesse answered / I am rightwysnes that am enhabyted here / and this
house is mine and thou art not rightwys / Therefore thou may not enhabyte here
/ And then he wept bytterly for these words / and went to a another house
that he saw beyond that and knocked at the door for to come in / but
thostesse which was within answered / I am truth / and thou art not true
there for I may not receive the / And fro thens he went to the iij house beyond
that / and required that he might come in for the tempest / and he that was
within said / I am peace that duelle here / and peace is not with felons / but
only with men of good will / And by cause I think the thoughts of peace / I
shall give to the good cou^seyl / My suster dwellyth above me / which always
helps kaytyues / goo to her and do that she shall counseylle the / And
then he went to that house And she that was within said / I am mercy that
dwell here / if thou wylt be saved fro this tempest / goo to the house of the
freres prechours at boleyne / and there thou shall find the stable of doctrine
/ the rack of scripture / the ass of symplenesse / the ox of discrescion /
and marie enlumynyng Joseph prouffytyng / and the child Ihesu saving / and when
this scoler awoke he came to the house of freres / and recounted his vysyon by
order / And required to have the habyte / and he received it / and abode in
thordre / saint domynyk tofore thynstituco^n of thordre saw Ih^u crist holdyng
three darts in his hond and menaced the world / then I friar Ioh^n of vignay
translatour of this book will no more reherce this visyon for in this present
chapter it is reherced tofore / and was showed also to a monk wherefore I here
make an end / then late us considre the holy life / the holy conversation /
and the holy miracles / that god has showed for this blessed man Saint domynyk
/ and late us pray him to be mediator between god and us that we may deserve
to be enoynted with thoynement of charity and of mercy / that after this short
life We may come to everlasting life in heaven Amen /

Thus ends the life of saint Domynyk /
Here follows the life of saint Sixte and first of his name
SIxtus is said of Sios that is god / and of status that is to say state / so
sixtus is as much to say as godly state / Or sixtus is said of sisto sistis /
as it were steadfast and ferme and fixus / that is fixed / For he was steadfast
and fyxe in the faith in passion / and in good work and operacion /

Of Saint sixte pope and martyr
SIxtus the Pope was of athenes / and was first a phylosophre and after was
dsciple of Ih^u christ / and was the souerayn bishop / And after was presented
to decien and valerien Emperors With two of his discyples and dekenes
felycyssyme and Agapite / And when decien might not enclyne hem in no manner /
he made them to be brought to the temple of Mars for to do sacrefyse to him or
for to be put in prison of mamertyn / and when he had refused to do sacrefise
/ and Was brought in to prison of mamertyn / the blessed saint laurence cried
after him saying / Fader whyther ghost thou without thy son / priest whyther
ghost thou without thy mynystre / To whom sixte said / Sone I leave the not /
but gretter bataylles ben due to the / after three days thou deken shall follow
me priest / but in the mean while take the tresours of the church / and
depart them where thou wylt / and when he had distributed them to pour
christian men valerien the provost ordained that Syxte should be brought again
for to do sacrefyse in the temple of mars / And if he refused it he should have
his head smeton of / And when he was led / the blessed laurence cried / after
him saying Fader leave me not / For I have despended all thy tresours / and
then the knights herd speak of the tresours / and helden Laurence / And
then they beheded sixte / Felicissym and Agapyte / and so they three suffered
death to gydre / In this same day is the feste of the transfyguracion of our
lord / and renewyd of new wyn if it may be founden of a ripe grape in sum
chyrches / and this day ben the grapes blessed in sum places / and the people
take thereof and ete it instead of holy bread / And the reason why is of this
that our lord said in his soper / to his dyscyples / I shall not drink of
this generation of the vine tofore I shall drink it new with you in the
regne of my fader / And this transfyguracion in that which he said new /
represents the glorious Inuocacion that Ihesu christ had after his
resurrection / and therefore on this day of the transfyguracion which
represents the resurection / men seek new wyn / And it is to wit that some
say that the transfyguracion Was made in veer / but the dyscyples disclosed it
not but kept it secret / by cause our lord commanded that they should not
dysclose it / till he was risen fro death to life / But after they manyfested and
dysclosed it on this day /

Thus ends of Saint Sixte pope and Martyr /
Here begins the life of seint Donat and first of his name
Donat is as much to say as borne of god And that is by regeneracion / of
grace Infusion / and glorificaco^n For there is treble generation spirituel of
god / that is to say of natyuyte religyosite / and of body mortalite / For
when seyntes deye that it is said that they be born / For the passing out of
this world of saints is not said death of saints / but natalyte / the child
appetiteth to be born to have larger place to dwell in / more mete for to ete
/ better air to respyre / and to see light / And when the saints issue out of
the belly of holy church their mother by death the four things they receive
aforsayd after their manner / and therefore they be said born / or gyuyng or
given of god

Of Saint Donat
DOnat was norysshyd / and taught of the emperor Iulyan then this Julian was
ordained to be soubdeken / but when he was enhaunsed to be Emperor / he slew
the fader and mother of donate / And donate fled in to the cite of arentyne
and dwelled there with hyllarye monk and did there many miracles / ffor the
provost of the cite had a son demonyake / and when he was brought to for^
Saint donate / the wicked spirit began to cry and say / In the name of our
lord Ih^u christ do me none harm ne be grievous to me / ne that I goo out of my
house / O donat wherefore constraynest thou me to issue out with torments / but
he was anon delyuerd when donat prayed / There was a man named Eustace which
received in Tuskane the rentes of the prince / and left the money in the
keeping of his wife named Eufronye / But for sorrow that she had of the enemies
that destroyed the contree / she hyd the money and deyed for sorrow / and when
her husbond came again he could not find the money / and when he with his
children should be brought to tormente / He fled to Saint donat / and donat
went with him to the sepulcre of his Wife / and said with a clear voys /
Eufronye I conjure the by ye virtue of the holy ghoost that thou say where thou
have leyde this money / And she answered out of the sepulture and said / At the
entree of the hows where I dalue it / And then they went thither and fond it
like as she had said / and a lytil while after Satirus the bishop deyed in our
lord / and all the clergy choos donat to be bishop in his place / and so he
was / On a day as saint gregore recounteth in his dyalogue when Saint donate
houseled the people after mass and the deken mynystred the body of our lord to
the people / sodanly the deken fill with the chalyce by thympulsion and
threstyng of the paynems that came thither / and the chalyse brake / whereof he
was sorry and so was all the people / And saint donat gadred to gydre the pieces
of the chalice and made his prayer / and remysed it in his first form / and a
lytil pyece the devil took away and hid it / which piece lacks yet in the
chalyce / and that chalice is kept in the said church in Wytnes of this
miracle / And the paynyms that saw this Were converted to the faith in so
much that lxxx of them received bapteme / There was a well or a fontayne
enfected that who that drank if it was anon deed And saint donat went anon
thither upon his ass for to pray and make the water hool / and anon an
horrible dragon issued out of the fontayn / and wonde his tail about the
legs of the ass / and adressyd him against donate / and donate smote him with
his staff / or as sum say he spytte in his mouth and he deyed / and then
he prayed to our lord and chased away all the venym out of the fontayne /
Another time when he and his felawes had great thruste / he made a fontayn to
sourde tofore them / The daughter of the emperor / theodocien Was tormented with
a devil / and was brought to Saint donat / and he said / thou foul spirit goo
out and dwell no more in this creature which is the form of god / To whom the
devil said give me place where I shall issue out and tell to me whyther I shall
goo / Saint donat said to him / Fro whens camst thou hither / and he said fro
deserte And donat answered return thou thither / and the devil said / I see in
the the sign of the cross out of which the fire spryngeth against me / / and
for dread of the fire I doubt for to goo / give me place and I shall issue out
/ And donat said loo here is place that thou may goo thy way / and return
thither that thou came fro / And then he made all the house to tremble / and
Went his way / There was a man borne to be buried / and there came a man that
brought an oblygacion and said that he ought to him two hundred shylynges / and
therefore he would not suffer him to be buried in no wise / wherefore his wife
which was wydowe came to saint donat and showed to him that matter / and said
that thylke man had received all that money / then went seint donat to the
corpse and touched the deed man with his hand / and said / arise thou up / and
see what thou shall do to this man that suffers not to burye the / the Which
then satte up and preued that he had paid it and vaynquysshed him tofore all
men and took thoblygacion in his hand and rent it in pieces / and after said
to saint donate / Fader command me to sleep again And he said sone goo now in
to rest forthon / And in that time it had not reyned well in three year / and
that the earth had be bareyn and brought forth no fruit / the mescreantes came
to the emperor Theodocien requyryng that he should deliver to them donat which
had made that by his art magyke / But at the request of the emperor / donat came
and prayed our lord that he would send to them reyne / And he sent to them so
great habou^dance that all the other were wette / and he went home allone / In
that time that the goths destroyed ytalye / and that much people departed from
the faith of god / Euadryan the provost was repreued of Apostasye / and saint
donat and saint hillary repreued him / and then he took them / and Would have
constrained them to do sacrefise to Iubyter / But they reffused it / and he
did do beat hillarye so much all despoyled that he gaf up his spyryte to god
/ and he leyde donat in prison / and after did do smite of his head the year of
our lord CCClxxx /

Thus ends the life of saint Donat martyr
Here begins the life of seint Ciriake martyr /
CIriake was ordained deken of Marcelle the pope / and was taken and brought to
maximien the emperor / and was commanded that he and his felawes should deluethe
earth / and should bear it on their sholdres unto the place that he made / And
there was saint saturnyne whom Ciriake and sisinnius heelpe for to bear And
after Ciriake was put and enclosed in prison / and at last was presented
tofore the prouoste / And as Appropynyan ladde him sodanly came a voys with
light fro heaven Which said Come ye blessed of my fader etc^ And then
Appropinianus byleued and made him self to be baptized / And came to the provost
confessyng Ihesu christ / To whom the provost said / Art not thou made christian
/ Which answerde / Alas for I have lost my days / The provost answered truly
now thou lesest thy days / and commanded to smite of his head / And when
saturnyn / and sisinnius would not make sacrefyse / They were tormented with
diverse torments / and at last were byheded / And the daughter of dyoclesyan
named Arthemie was tormented of the devil / and the devil cried within her and
said / I shall not goo out tofore that Ciria^k the dekene come / and then
was Ciriaque brought to her / and then said the devil / if thou wylt that I
issue and goo out / give me a vessel where I may enter in / and then answered
Ciriake / lo here is my body enter therein if thou may / and he said In to thy
vessel I may not enter / For it is signed and closed on all sides / but if
thou cast me out here / I shall make the soon come in to babilone / and when
he was constreyned to goo out arthennya cried and said / I see the god that
Ciriak prechith / and when he had buptysed her / and had grace of dyoclesian
and of Serene his Wife / he dwelled and lived surely in an house that he gaf him
/ Then came there a message fro the king of perse to dioclesian prayeng him
that he would send him Ciriake / For his daughter was tormented of a devil /
and then by the prayers of dyoclesyan Ciriake went gladly with largo and
smaragdo with all things necessaryy in the ship in to babylone / and when
they came to the daughter / the devil cried to him thorugh the mouth of the
maiden / O Ciriak thou art weary of traueyll and he said I am not weary / but am
governed oueral by the help of god / And the devil said / nevertheless I have
brought the there as I would have the And Ciriak said / Ihesu christ commands
the that thou goo out / And then the devil issued out and said O name
terryble that constrayneth me And the maid was then made hole And was
baptized with fader and mother and much other people / And they offered to him
many yeftes but he would none take / and abode there xlv days fasting in bread
and water / and at last he came to rome / And after ij months dyoclesyan
was deed / And Maximyen succeeded to thempyre / And was wroth with Arthemye his
suster / and took Ciriake and bond him with chains / and commanded to draw
him tofore his chare / This maxymyen may be called and said the sone of
dyoclesyan by cause he succeeded him / and had his daughter to wife which was
called valeriane / and after he commanded to carpase his vicaire to constrayne
Ciriake and his felawes to do sacrefyse / or else slay them by diverse
tormentis / And he took Ciriaque / and threw pytche molten and brennyng hot
on his head / and henge him in the tormente named eculee / and after he did do
smite of the head of Ciriake / and also byheded his felaws about the year of
our lord iijC And Carpase gate the house of Saint Ciriake / and in despyte of
christian men he made a bayne in the same place where Ciriak baptized / and there
bayned and made bankettis in etyng and drynkyng / And suddenly he with xix
felawys deyed there / And therefore the bayne was closed up / And the paynems
began to dread and honor christian men /

Thus ends the life of Saint Ciriake /
Here follows the life of saint laurence and first of his name
LAurence is said as holdyng a crown made of laurier / For sometime they that
vaynquysshyd in bataylle were crowned with laurier bows and branches showing
vyctorye / and it is alleway couerable verdour / of odor agreeable and virtuous
of strength / and the blessed laurence is said of laurier / for he had
victory in his passion / whereof decius confused said / I wene now that we be
vaynquysshed / he had verdeur in clennesse of heart and purete / For he said my
voys has no derkenes / he had odor of perpetuel memoire / whereof it is said
he departed all and gaf to pour people / and therefore remains his droyture
perdurably / which he fulfilled with holy work / and hallowed it by his
glorious martirdom / he had strength by his virtuous prechyng by which he
converted lucille the provost romayn / This is that tree of such virtue / that
the leef brake the stone / heled the deef / and doubted no thoucer / And thus
laurence brake the hard herd / he gaf spyrituel reward / And deffended the
sentence for the thonder of evil people

Of saint laurence the glorious martyr
LAurence martyr and subdeken was of the lignage of spain and saint sixte
brout him thens / And as master Johan beleth says / when the blessed sixte
Went in to spain / he fond there ij yongmen laurence and vyncent his cosyn
right ordynat by honest of manners and noble in all their works / and brought
them with him to rome / Of whom that one that was laurence abode with him / And
vincent his cosyn returned in to spain and there fynysshyd his life by glorious
martirdom / But in this reason master beleth repugneth the time of martyrdom of
that one and of that other / For it is said that laurence suffered death under
decian and vince^t under dyoclesyan / and between decian and dyoclesyan were
about xl year And there were vij emperors between them So that the blessed
vyncent might not be young / and the blessed sixte ordained laurence his
archedeken / and in his time Phylip the emperor And phylyp his sone received the
faith of Ihesu christ / And when they were crystend they entendyd gretely to
enhau^ce the church / And this emperor was the first that receyueyd the faith
of ihu^ christ / whom as it is said Origenes converted to the faith / How ^e it
that it is read in other place other wise / And that saint po^cian had don it
And he reigned the year a thousand fro the byldyng of rome So that the year a
thousand should rather be yeue^ to crist than to thydolles / And that year was
hallowed of the romans with right great appareylle of games and great
esbatemens / And there was a knight with philip the emperor named decian Which
was noble and much renomed in arms and in batayles / And when in that time
france rebelled against this emperor / He sent thither decien for to take awey
the co^tencio^s and subdue them torome / and decius so sent thider made all
things well / And subdued them all to rome / And had vyctorye / And when
the emperor herd his coming / And would honor him more hyely And went against
him unto verone But for as much as the evil people feel them more honored / so
much more he was swollen in pride / Then decien elate in pride began to
coueyte thempyre / And on a time when decien knew that the emperor slepte in
his pauyllon / he entered in secretly and cut the throat of his lord slepyng
And then he drew to him by yeftes and prayers and also by promesses all them
of the host that the emperor had brought / And went anon to the cite of rome
/ And when philyp the yo^ger herd this thing / he was sore aferd and doubted
strongly / And as Sica^ says in his cronyke he delyured all his faders tresour
and his to to saint sixte and to saint laurence / to the end / that if hit
happed him to be slain of decyen / that they should give this tresoure to pour
people / and to the Chirches / And wondre not that the tresours that laurence
gaf / be not named the tresours of the emperor / but of the church / or
parauenture they were said tresours of the church / For Phelyp had left them
to be dispendyd to the church / And after phelip fled and hid him for fere
of decyen / And then the senate went against decian / and confermed him in
thempyre / And by cause he was not scene to have slain his lord by treson but
only for he had renyed thydollys / therefore he began right cruelly to
persecute the church and Christian men / and commanded that they should be
destroyed without mercy / And many thousand martirs were slain among whom
phelyp was crowned with martirdom / And after that decius / made a search of
the tresours of his lord / Then was Sixte brought to him as he that adoured
Ihesu Crist / and had the tresours of thempyre / And then commanded decian /
that he should be put in prison so long that by tormentys he should renye god /
and tell where the tresours were / And the blessid laurence followed him / and
cried after him / whyther ghost thou fader without a mynyster / what thing is
in / me yt has displesyd thy faderhode / or what thing have you seen in me have
you seen me / forsake my lygnage or go out of kind / Prove me whether thou have
chosen a couenable mynystre / to whom thou have commysed the dispensacion of
the body and blood of our lord / To whom saint Sixte said / I shall not leave
the my sone / but gretter stryues and bataylles be due to the for the feyth of
Ihesu crist we as old men have taken more lightter bataylle / and to the as to
a young man shall remain a more gloryouse battle of which thou shall tryumphe
and have vyctorye of the tyrant / and shall follow me within three days /
Then he delyuerd to him all the tresours comandyng him that he should give
them to chirches and pour people / And the blessed man sought the pour people
night and day / And gaf to each of them that as was needful / and came to the
hows of an old woman / which had hid in her hows many christian men and wymmen
/ And long she had had the head ache / And saint Laurence leyd his hand upon
her head / And anon she was heled of the ache and pain / And he wesshe the
feet of the pour people / And gafe to each of them alms / The same nyt he
went to the hows of a christian man and fond therein a blind man / and gafe to
him his sight by the sign of the cross / And when the blessid / Sixth would
not consent to decian / ne offer to thydollys / he commanded / that he should
be led forth / and be byheded And the blessid laurence ran after him and seid
/ Forsake me not holy fader / For I have dispended the tresours that thou
delyuerst to me / And when the knights herd speak of the tresours / they took
laurence / and brought him to the provost / And the provost delyuerd him to
decian / And Decian Caesar said to him / where ben the tresours of the church /
which we know well that thou have hyd / and he answered not / wherefore he
delyuerd him to Valeryan the prouoste to the end that he should show the
tresours / and do sacrifise to thydolles / or to put him to death by diverse
tormentis / And Valeryen delyuerd him to a provost named Ypolyte for to be in
prison / and he enclosed him in prison with many other / And there was in prison
a paynym named Lucylle / which had lost the sight of his eyes with ouermoche
weeping / And saint laurence promised to him to rystablysshe his sight / if he
would believe in Ihesu Crist and receive baptym / And he required anon to be
baptized / Then saint laurence took water and said to him / All things in
confession ben wasshen / And when he had dylygently informed him in the
artycles of the feythe / And he confessid that he byleuyd all / he shadde
water on his head / and baptized him in the name of Ihesu Crist / And anon he
that had be blind / received his sight ayene And therefore came to him many blind
men / and went again enlumyned from him / and having their sight / And then
again Ypolyte said to him show to me the tresours / to whom laurence said /
Ypolyte / if thou Wylt believe in our lord Ihesu Crist / I shall show to the /
the tresours / and promise to the life perdurable / And Ypolyte said / if thou
do this that thou say / I shall do that thou requyrest / And in that same
hour Ypolyte byleuyd / and received the holy baptym / he and all his meyne /
And when he was beptysed / he said / I have seen the sowles of the Innocents
Joyous and glad / And after this Valeryan sent to ypo lyte that he should
bring him laurence / and laurence said to him late us goo to gyder / For the
glory is made ready to me and to the / And then they came to Judgment / And he
was inquired again of the tresours / And laurence demanded dylacion of three
days / and Valeryen granted him on pledge of Ypolyte / And sayn^ laurence in
these three days gadred to geder pour people blind and lame / and presented
them tofore decian / in the palace of Salustyen and said / These here ben the
tresours perdurable / which shall not be mynuysshed / but encrece / which be
departed to each of them The hands of thise men have borne the tresours in to
heaven / Then Valeryan in the presence af decian said / what varyest thou in
many things / Sacrefye anon / and put fro the thine art magyke / And
laurence said to him / whether ought he to be adoured / that makes / or he
that is made And then decian was angry / and commanded that he should be beten
with scorpyons / And that all manner of torments should be brought to fore him
/ And then commanded he him / that he should do sacrefyse for teschewe these
torments / and saint laurence answered Thou cursyd man / I have alwey coueyted
these metes / To whom decius said if these be metes for the / show to me them
/ that be like to the / that they may ete with the / To whom laurence said /
they have given their names in to heaven / and thou art not worthy to see them /
And then by the commandment of decien / he was beten al naked with rods
and staves and pyeces of iron brennyng were leyd to his sides And laurence said
/ lord Ihesu Criste / god / sone of god / have mercy on me thy servant /
which am acused / (...) I have not renyed the / and they have demanded me /
and I have confessyd the to be my lord / And then Decius said to him / I
know well / that thou despysest the torments / by thyn art magyke / but me
thou may not despise / I swear by my gods and goddesses that but thou wylt
do sacryfice to them thou shall be punysshed by diverse torments / Then he
commanded / that he should be long beten with pl^mmettys / And then he prayed
saying lord Ihesu crist receive my spyryte / And then came a voys from heaven /
decian heryng which said yet many torments ben due to the / And then decian
said replenysshyd with felonye / ye men of Rome / have ye herd the deuylles
co^fortyng / this cursyd man which adoured not the gods / ne doubted not the
torments / ne dredeth not the princes wrath / And then commanded he again
that he should be beten with scorpyons / And then laurence smylyng rendryd
thankynges to god / and prayed for them / that were there / And in that same
hour a knight named R^^mayne byleuyd in god / and said to saint laurence / I
see to fore the a right fair yonglyng stondyng / and with a lynnen clothe
clensyng thy wounds I adjure the by the living lord god that thou leave not /
but haste the to baptyse me / And then said decien to valeryen / I wene that
we shall now be ouercomen by art magyke / And then he commanded / that he
/ should be vnbounden / and enclosed in the prison of ypolyte / And then
Romayne brout an vrcelle or a cruse with water / and fylle down at feet of
saint laurence / And received baptysme of him / And when decyan knew it / he
commanded that Romayn should be beten with rods / And he was so much beten /
that he might not hold him upon his legs / but in no manner might no man make
him say / but that he was a good Christian / and freely baptized / And then
decyan did do smite of his head / And that night was laurence led to decyen /
And when Ypolyte which was there saw that / he began to weep / and would have
said / that he was cristened And Laurence said to him / hyde Ihesu Crist within
the / And when I shall cry / here and come thither / And then all manner of
torments / that couthe be devised or thought / were brought tofore decian /
And then said decian to laurence / or thou shall make sacrifyse to the gods
/ or this night shall all these torments be dispendyd on the / And then
laurence said to him / my night has no derkenes / but all things shine in my
syghte / And then said decian / bring hyder a bed of iron / that laurence
contymax may lie thereon / And the mynystres despoylled him / And leyd him
stratched out upon a gredyron of Iron / and leyd brennyng coals under / and
held him with forkes of iron / Then said laurence to Valeryan / learn thou
cursyd wretch / for thy coals give to me refresshyng of coldness / and make
ready to the torment perdurable / And our lord knows / that I being accused
have not forsaken him / And when I was demanded I confessid him criste / And I
being roasted give thankynges unto god and after this he said witha glad there
unto decian / thou cursyd wretch thou haste roasted that one side / turn that
other / and ete / And then he rendryng thankynges to our lord said I thank
the lord Ihesu Criste / For I have deserved to enter in to thy yates / And so
gaf up his spyryte / And then decian being all confused walked in to the
palais of Tiberye with Valeryan / and left the body lyeng upon the fire which
ypolyte in the morning took away / with Iustyne the preeste / And beryed it
with precious oynementes in the field Verane / And the Christian men that buried
him / fasted three days and three nyghtes / and hallowed the Vygyles weeping there
and waylyng / But many doubt if he suffered death under this decian / For it is
red in the Cronycle / that Sixte was long after decian / Eutropius nevertheless
affermeth and says / that decian meuynge persecucyon against christian men among
other / he slew the blessid laurence deke^ and martyr / And it is said in a
Cronyke autentyke enough / that it was not under this decyan emperor / that
succeeded to phelyp / but under another decyan younger / which was Cezar and not
emperor / he suffered martyrdom / For between Decyan the emperor / and this
decyan the younger under whom it is said that laurence was martryd / there were
many emperors and popes Also it is said that gallus and Volusianus his sone
succeeded decyan / And after them Valeryen with galren his sone held thempyre /
And they made decyan the younger Cezar and not emperor / For auncyently when
any was made Cezar / neuerthemore he was Augustus ne emperor / as it is read
in the chronicles / that Dyoclesyan made maxymyan Cezar / And after fro Cezar he
was made Augustus and emperor / In the time of these emperors valeryen and
galyan Sixth held the sea of Rome / And this Decyan was called Cezar and not
emperor / but decyan Cezar only / And he martred the blessid Fabyan / And
cornely succeeded after Fabyan / which was martred under Valeryan and galyan /
which reigned xv year / And lucyan succeeded Cornely / And Stephen the pope
succeeded lucyan / And Denis succeeded Stephen / And Sixte succeeded Denis / And
this is contained in that Cronycle / And if this be true / that which master
Johan beleth puts / may be true And it is read in an other cronycle that
the said galyan had two names / and was called galyan / and Decyan / and under
him Sixte and Laurence suffered martirdom about the year of our lord two
honderd / and three score / Godefroy in his book / that is called antheonydes /
affermeth / that galyan was called by another name Decyan / Saint gregory says
in his Dyaloges / that there was a nonne in Sabyne / which held her contynent
of her flesh / but she eschewed not the Ianglerye of her tongue / and she was
buried in the chirch of saint laurence the holy martyr / And was leyd to fore
the altar of the martyr / and was taken of the deuyls and departed and so wen
a sondre / and that one part was burnt / and that other part remained hoole
/ so that on the morning the brennyng appeared vysybly / Gregory of Tours says
/ that when a certain priest repaired the chirch of saint laurence / And one
of the bemes was over short / and required saint laurence / that he which had
norysshed pour men would help his pouerte / And the beme grew so suddenly that
there remained a great part / And the priest cut that part in to small pyeces
and cured and heled there with many maledyes / And this witnesses saint
fortunate / It happed at Bryoras a castle in ytaly / that a man was sore vexed
with tooth ache / And he atouched this wode And anon the ache was gone / Saint
gregory tells in his book of dyaloges that a priest named sanctyne repaired a
church of saint laurence which had be burnt of lumbardes / and hired many
werkmen / And one time he had nothing to set to fore them / And then he
made his prayers / and after looked in his paner / and there he fond a much
white loof of breed / but him seemed / that hit suffysed not for one dinner for
three persons / Saint Laurence / which would not fail his werkmen / did do
multyplye that his werkmen were sustained thereby ten days / In the chirch of
saint laurence at melan was a chalyce of crystal / merueylously clear And as
the deken bare it on a day of solempnyte / to the altar / it fylle out of his
hondes to the ground / and was all to broken / And then the deken weeping
gadered to gyder the pyeces / And leyd them on the altar / And prayed the holy
martyr saint laurence / that the chalyce broken might be made hoole again /
And then anon it was founden al hool It is read inthe book of the miracles
of our blessid lady saint Marye / that a Judge named Stephen was at rome / and
took gladly yeftes / and perverted the Iugeme^tes / And this Judge took aweye
by force three howses / that were longyng to the church of saint laurence / And
a gardyn of saint Agnes / And posseded them wrongfully / It happed that the
Judge deyed / and was brout to Judgment to fore god / And when saint laurence
saw him / he went to him in great despyte / And strayned him three times by
the arm right hard And tormented him by great pain / And saint Agnes and
other Vyrgyns dayned not to look on him / but turned their vysages awey fro him
/ And then the Judge gyuyng sentence against him said / by cause he has
withdrawn other men's things / and has taken yeftes and sold truth /
that he should be put in the place of Judas the traitor / And saint Proiecte
whom the said Stephen had much louyd in his lif came to the blessid laurence
and to saint Agnes and cried them mercy for him / Then the blessid vyrgyn
Mary and they prayed to god for him / And then it was granted to them that
the soul of him should goo ageyn to the body / and there should do his
penance thyrty days / And our blessid lady commanded him / that as long as
he lived / he should say the psalm / Beati inmaculati / And when the soul came
to the body ageyn / his arm was like as it had be brent / like as he had
suffered that hurt in his body / And that token and sign was in him as long
as he lived / Then rendryd (...) that which he had taken and did (...)
penance / And at xxx day / he passed out of this world to our lord / It is
read in the life of saint Henry the emperor / that he and kunegonde his wife were
vyrgyns to geder / by thatysement of the devil / he had his wife suspecte of a
knight / And he made his wife goo barfoote upon brennyng ashes / fyften paas
/ And when she ascended upon them she said thus / As I am not corrupt ne
defowled of Harry ne of al other / so Ihesu criste help me / Then Henry
the emperor was ashamed / and yafe her a buffet on the c^^ke / and a voys said
the Vyrgyn Mary has delyuerd the Vyrgyn / and she went without any hurt upon
the brennyng ashes and when the emperor was deed there went a great multitude
of deuyls to fore the celle of an heremyte / and he opened the wyndowe and
demanded at last what they were / and one answerde a legyon of deuyls we be
/ that goo to the death of the emperor / if parauenture we may find any thing in
him / He adjured him / that he should come again to him / which retornyng
said / we have prouffyted no thing / For when this false suspecion of his wife /
and all the good things and euylle things were leyd in a balau^ce / this
burnt and bruled / laurence brought forth a pot of gold of much great weight
/ And when we supposed to have surmounted / he cast that pot in the balaunce
on that other side / so that it weyeth more and was heuyer / And then I was
angry / and brak an ere of the pot / And he called that pot a chalyce / which
the emperor had given to the church Emstence / which he had in special
devotion / And had do made it in thonoure of saint laurence / And for the
gretenes of it / hit had two eres / And it was founden then that emperor
deyde that time / and one ere was broken of the Chalyce /

Gregory reherceth in his Regystre / that his predecessor coueyted to make
better sum things about the body of saint laurence / but he wyste not where
it lay / netheles the body of saint laurence was discouerd / and vnheled by
ygnoraunce / but all they / that were there present as well monks as other
were deed in fyften days after / It is to wete that the passion of saint
laurence was most excellent in four things / like as it is founden by the
sayenges of saint Maxymyn bishop / and of saint Austyn / First in the sournes
of his passion or bytternes Secondly in prouffyte or effect / Thyrdly in
constaunce / or strength / And fourthly in the merueylous bataylle and manner
of his vyctorye / First it was right excellent in the bytternes of the pain /
this says saint Maxymyn / And after sum books of saint Ambrose /

Brethren saint laurence was not slain by short and simple passion / For who
that is smyten with a swerd he deyeth but ones / And who that is cast in a
fire is delyuerd at ones / but this holy man was tormented by long and
multyplyed pains / so that the death should not fail him at tormente / ne
fail him at the end / we read that the blessid children went thorugh the
flambes / And have gone upon the coals brennyng harfeet whereof saint laurence
is not to be preferred of less glory / For as they went in their pains
thorugh the fla^mes / This in his torment lay upon the fire / They defowled /
and trade upon the fire with their feet / And this was restreyned for to leye
his sides therein /

They praide in their pains holding up their hands to our lord god / but he
was stratched in his pain and prayed our lord with all his body / And it is
to wete that the blessid laurence is he / that after saint Stephen ought to
hold the prymacye / Not only for that he suffered gretter pain / than other
martyrs / as is well found and read / that many have suffered as much pain /
but it is said for six causes First for the place of the passion / For hit
was at Rome / which is heed of the world / and Syege of the Apostles /

Secondly / for thoffyce of the predycacion / For he accomplysshed dylygently
thoffyce of prechyng /

Thyrdely for the lowable dystrybucion of the tresours / that he gaf all to
pour men wisely /

And these three Reasons puts Master Wylliam of Ancerre /

Fourthly for the antyquyte / and proved martyrdom / For if it be said / that
sum other have had / gretter pain / Alwey hit is not so Autentyke / And also
sometime in doubt / but the passion of saint laurence is much solemn / and
approved in the Church / And therefore many Saints approuue his passion in
their Sermons and afferme hit /

Fyftly for the degree of dignyte / For he was Archedeken of the Syege of Rome
/ And as it is said / there was never sithe Archedeken in Rome / Sixtely / for
the cruelte of torments / For he suffered them right grievous / as he / that was
roasted upon a gredyron of iron / Whereof saint Austxn says / Sithe / that the
members were broken by many diverse betynges / He was commanded to be
tormented upon a gredyl of iron / and was leide thereupon which by contynuell
heete / that was there under / the gredyll had tho force to brenne / so that
he was tormented by the tornynge of his membrys more forcybly / For the pain
was the more long / Secondly he was right eycellent in effect or prouffyte /
For after this / that Austyn and Maxymyn say / this bytternes of pain made
him high by gloryfycacion / and honorable by opinion / renomed and lowable by
devotion and noble by contencion / First it made him hyhe by gloryficacion /
whereof saint Austyn says / Persecutour / thou we rewood against the martyr /
and more than wood / For when thou assemblest pain / thou encreacest his
glory / thyn engyn fond not glory of the aid when thynstrumentes of the
torments transported him in thonoure of vyctorye / And after Maxymyn and in
sum books of Ambrose it is said / how be hit that the members were bounden in
the hete of the sparcles / the force of the feith was not corrupt / the body
suffered enpayryng / but he gate the gain of health / And saint Austyn says
truly his body is blessid / For torment never changed him out of the feyth of
god but his relygyon crowned him in holy rest / Secondly he was honorable by
oppynyon and renommee after maxymyn and Ambrose / that say / we may lykene the
blessid laurence to mustard seed / which is broken by many manners / when by
the grace of his mystery he replenysshed the world of good odoure / For to fore
that he was constytute in his body / he was humble unknown and seruysable /
And after that he was all to broken and burnt / he shed in all the chirches
of the world the odor of his noblesse / Also this is an holy thing and
playsaunt / that the solempnyte of saint laurence be nobly honored / whoos
shynyng flammes he as vaynquysshoure holy chirch haloweth this day in all the
world / in so much that his glorious passion enlumyneth all the world / by
the glory of his martyrdo^ / Thyrdely he was lowable by devotion / wherefore was
he so lowable and so with devotion to be reputed / Saint Austyn shows it by
three reasons / and says thus / We ought to receive the blessid man with
devotion / First / for he gaf his precious blood for the love of our lord /
And after / for by cause he had unto our lord great affynyte / showing / that
the feyth of christian men ought to deserve to be of the company of martirs /
Thyrdly / by cause he was so / holly of conversation / that in the time of
pees he deseruyd the croune of martirdom / Fourthly he made him self noble by
following / whereof saint Austyn says that the cause of all his passion was by
cause he exhorted other to be like to him / In three things he showed him to us
following / First in strong suffryng of aduersitees / whereof saint Austyn says
/ the most profitable form for tenforme the people to god / is the fair
speech of martirs / It is light to pray / and it is prouffytable to admoneste
and warn the things / And thexamples be better than the words / And it is
more to teache by work than by voys / And in this right excellent manner of
techyng the persecutours might feel of laurence how he shone by great dygnyte /
And how the merueylous strength of his courage gaf not only place of believe /
but also comforted and strengthed other by ensample of his suffraunce /
Secondly by gretenes of the feyth and fervor of love / Whereof Maxymyn says /
and Ambrose also / when he vaynquysshyd by feyth / the flammes of the
persecutoure he shewde to us by the fire of faith that he ouercam
thembracementes of the fire of hell / And by the love of Crist not to fere the
day of dome / Thyrdly in brennyng love / Maxymyn and Ambrose seyn / that saint
laurence enlumyned the world plainly / of the same light that he was embraced
with and chauffed the hertes of all christian people / by the flammes that he
suffered by these three things says saint Maxymyn after the books of saint
Ambrose that we ben called to the feythe by thexample of saint laurence / and
embraced to martyrdom / and chauffed to devotion /

Thyrdly he was right excellent in constaunce and in strength / And hereof
says saint Austyn / The blessid laurence dwellid in Ihesu christ unto the
temptacion / unto the demand of the tyrant / And unto the death / in whom
thocasion was long / and by cause / that he had well eten and well dronken /
he was fat of this mete And dronken of the chalyce / so that he felt not the
torments ne eschewed them / but succeeded the Royamme of heaven / he was so
constaunt / that he set not by the torments / but after that saint Maxymyn
says / he was made more parfight in dread more ardaunt in love / and more
Joyous in brennyng / For the first it is said thus / he was stretched upon the
flammes of the great brondes / of fire / and turned often fro that one side to
that other /

And how much more he suffered of pains / so much more he dradde god / And of
the second he says thus / When the grain of the mostard is grounden / it
chauffeth / And when Laurence suffered torments / he was enflammed again / and
tormented of a new manner of merueylous torments / And the gretter torments /
that the wood persecutours dyden / the more devout was laurence to our
savior And as to the third / he says thus / he was chauffed in the law of
Ihesu Crist / that by great hyenes of courage he despised the torments of his
own body / that in having Vyctorye / of his wood tormentour / he was Joyous
for to despise it by the fire /

Fourthly he was right excellent in the merueylous bataylle / and in the manner
of his vyctorye / And as it apperith openly by the words of saint Maxymyn and
of saint Austyn / The blessid laurence had five brennynges without forth /
which he al ouercam manly / and extyncte them / The first was the fire of
hell / The second mate ryall flamme / the thyrdde carnal concupiscence / the
fourth of brennyng couetyse / And the fyfte of a mad wodenes The quenchyng of
the first fire / that is of hell / Maxymyn says / It might give no place of
brennyng to the worldly fire for to brenne his body / which quenchyd the fire
perdurable of hell / he went through the fire erthely and materyal of this
world / but he escaped and eschewed them / the horrible flambe of the fire
perdurable of hell / The quenchyng of the second fire he says also / he
trauayled by bodily brennyng / but the dyuyne ardoure quenchyd the materyal
brennyng / And yet says he / how be it the euylle people put under the fagottes
and wood / for tencrece / and make great flamme / Saint Laurence esprysed by
the hete of the feyth felt not the flammes / And saint Austyn says / the
charity of Ihesu Crist may not be surmounted with flammes / for the fire that
burnt without forth / was more feeble / than that which he embracyd within
forth / And the quenchyng of the third fire of carnal concupyscence / says
saint Maxymyn / saint laurence passed thorugh the fire / which he abhorryd
being not burnt / but he enlumyned shone he brenned lest he should brenne / And
by cause he should not brenne he was burnt Of the quenchynge of the fourth
fire / that is of Auaryce of them / that coueyte the tresours / of which they
be deceived / Says saint Austyn thus / A man coueytous is armed by double
ardour of money / and is enemy of truth / his auaryce is for to stele gold
And by his febonye he leseth our lord He has no thing / he prouffyteth no
thing / humayne cruelte is withdrawn by his wyndes and c^rporalle matter / And
laurence goth to heaven / And he fails in his flammes / Of the quenchyng of
the fifthe fire / that is of the furyous woodenes / how that is to say furyous
woodenes of the persecutoure was deceived and brought to naught / Seyth Saint
Maxymyn thus / when the woodenes of the mynystres of the fla^mes was surmo^ted
/ he restrained the brennyng of the worldly wodenes And till that time the
deuyls intent prouffyted / till that the true man ascended / and mounted in to
heaven gloryously unto his lord god / And he made to c^le the cruelte of the
persecutours confused all with their fires / And shows that the woodenes of
the persecutours / was fire / when he said / the woodenesse of the Paynyms
maade ready a gredel of iron upon the fire strongly brennyng / And that was
done / to the end / that he should avenge the fyres and great heetes of
indignacion And it was no wonder / though he surmounted these three great fyres
without forth / For as it is had of the words of the said maxymyn / he had
within forth three refroydours or coldes / and bare in his heart three fyres / by
which he assuaged by coldenes all the fire with out forth / And surmounted
with the^bracynge of more fire / And the first coldenes / was the desire of
celestyalle glory / Che second was the remembrance of the law of god / And
the third was the clennes of his conscience / By this treuble coldenes he
quenchid all the fire without forth / And he was cold of the first refraydeur
/ which is desire of heavenly glory / as saint Ambrose says / the blessid
Laurence might not feel the torments of fire in his entraylles / which
within him posseded the refraidour of paradis Though the burnt flesh lay to
fore the tyrant / and the body burnt / Nevertheless the body suffered no pain
in earth whoos soul and courage was in heaven / Of the second coldenes or
refraideur / that is the remembrance of the law of god he says thus / when
he reme^bryd to fore the commandments of Ihesu Christ / al was cold that he
suffered / Of the third which is purete and clennes of conscience he says
thus / the right strong martyr truly is burnt in his entraylles / but he
sechyng the kingdom of heaven / enjoys / as a vaynqueur / by the refroydour
of the clennes of his conscience / And as saint Maxymyn says / he had three
fyres within forth / by the which he surmonnted by embracyng all the fyres
without forth The first was the gretenes of the faith The second the ardaunt
dilection / The thyrdde the very knowledge of god which embracyd him as fire /
Of the first fire says saint Ambrose / As much as the brennyng of the feyth
chauffeth him / so much coled him the flamme of the torment / We read in the
gospel that the fire of the feythe is the fire of the sauyoure / Theuangelyst
said / I came in to the earth to put fire therein / And with this fire was saint
laurence embraced and felt not the brennyng of the flammes / And of the second
fire he says thus / the martyr laurence brenned without forth of
thembracementes of the tyrau^t but the gretter flamme of the love of god /
brenned him within forth / Of the thyrdde fire he says thus / The right
cruel flamme of the persecutour might not surmounte the martyr / For he was
over much more ardauntly chauffed in his thought / by the rays of troth that
he felt not the flamme without forth / which he vaynquysshyd and ouercam
Laurence among the other martirs has three pryueleges as toward office The
first he has only a Vygyle among all the other martirs But at this day the
Vygyles of saints ben changed in to fastings / by many / And as Master
Johan Beleth reherseth / It was sometime the customme / that the men went with
their wives and children at the solempnyte of feestes / And woke there all the
night with tapers and light / but by cause many adventures were made in these
Vygyles / It was establysshed / that the Vygyles should be turned in to
fastings / And nevertheless the ancient name is retained / And is yet retained
/ And is called Vygyle / The second pryuelege is in the Octabas or vtas / For
he only with saint stephen have their octauas among all other martirs / like as
saint Martyn has among the Confessors / The third is in the reprysyng of the
anthemys For he only and saint pawle have that only / But powle has that for
thexcellence of his prechyng / And Laurence for thexcellence of his passion /

Thus ends the life of saint Laurence martyr
Here follows of saint ypolite martyr and first of his name
YPOlitus is said of yper / that is as much to say / as upon and lytos / that
is a stone / as who says upon a stone / that is to understand founded upon
Crist / Or of in / and polys / that is a Cite / Or Ypolitus is as much to say
/ as polysshed / he was well founded upon the stone Crist / by constance and
stedfastnes / he was in the cite above by desire / and coueytyng / he was
polysshed by the bitterness of his torments /

YPolyte buried the body of saint laurence / And after he came in to his hows /
and yaf the pees to his servants / and to his Chamberyers / And commyned them
with the sacrament of the altar / which Iustyne the priest had sacred / And
the table was couerd / but or he took any mete / the knights came / and haled
him awey / and brought him to the emperor / And when decyan themperoure saw him
/ he smylyng said to him / Art thou now made an enchanteur / which have borne
aweye the body of Laurence / And Ypolyte said / that have I done / not as an
enchaunteure / but as a Christian man / Then decian being replenysshed with
great suroure commanded / that he should be despoylled of his habyte / that he
ware as a Christian man / and that his mouth should be beten with stones / To
whom ypolyte said / thou have not despoylled me but rather clothed / To whom
decian said / how is it / that thou art now so felysshe / that art not ashamed
of thy nakedness / Now therefore make thou sacryfyse / and thou shall live / or
else thou shall perysshe with laurence / to whom ypolyte said / I would / I
might be made thexample of saint laurence / whom thou presumest to name with
thy foul mouth / and pollute / Then decyan made him to be beten with stones
and all to rent with combs of iron / And he confessid with a clear wys / that
he was Christian / and when he had despised these torments / he did him to be
clothed with the vesture of a knight / that he to fore used / in exhortyng him
that to receive his amytye / and his first chyualrye / And Ypolyte said I am
the knight of Ihesu crist / and then Decyan replenysshed with greet wrath
delyuerd him to Valeryan the provost / and that he should take all his
facultees / and slay him by diverse torments / And then he fond that all
the meyne of ypolytes hows were christian / And all were brought to fore him /
and when he would have constreyned them to do sacryfyse / One named Concordia
Nouryce of ypolyte answered for them all / we had lever deye with our lord
chastely / than live synfully / and then decian being present / commanded
that she should be beten with plometttis of leede unto the time / that she gaf
over her spyryte / and ypolyte said / Sire I thank the / that thou have sent
my nouryce to fore the sight of thy saints / and after that Valeryan did do
led ypolite with his meyne to the yate Tyburt^ne / and ypolyte comforted them
all / and said brethren dread you not for ye and I have one only god / and
then Valeryan commanded that all they should ben byheded before ypolyte / and
then he made ypolyte to be bounden by the feet unto the necks of wild
horses / and made him to be drawn among thorns / bryeres and roches tylle he
rendryd and gaf to god his spyryte / he deyde about the year of our lord CC
lxvi / And then Iustyn the priest took the bodies of them and buried them by
the body of saint Laurence but he couthe not find the body of saint concord
For it was cast in to a preuy / A knight that was named porphyre wend that the
blessid Concord had gold and precious stones in her clothes and came to a man
named herenen / which was secretly a Christian man / and said to him / keep my
ceunuylle secret / And draw concord out of the preuy / For I trow / that
there ben in her vestymentes gold and precious stones / And he said show to me
the place / where she lies / And I shall keep thy connceylle / And shall tell
to the what I shall find / And then he drew her out of the preuy chamber
/ and fond nothing / And then the knight fled awey anon / And Hyreneus
called to him a Christian man / named Abonde / And bare the body to saint Iustyn
/ and he took it deuoutely / and buried hit by the body of saint ypolyte with
the other / And when Valeryen herd hereof / he did do take Hyreneus and Abound
/ and threw them all quycke in to the preuy / And Iustyn took out their bodies
/ and buried them with the other / And after these things don decyen and
Valeryen ascended in to a golden chare / for to go and tormenten Christian men /
And de cyen was rauysshed of a deuylle / and cried / O Ypolyte has bounden me
with sharp chains and ledeth me awey / And Valeryen cried also / O laurence
thou drawest me with fyry chains / And the same hour Valeryen deyde / And
decyan returned home / and deyde the thyrdde day / tormented of the deuylle /
and cried laurence cesse thou a little / I conjure the to cesse thy torments /
and so deyde And when Tryphonye his wife / which was much cruel / saw this
thing she left all / and took to Cyrylle her daughter / and went to saint
Iustyn and did do baptyse her / with many other / And that other day after
that / as Tryphone praid she gaf up her spyryte / and deyde / And Iustyn the
priest buried her body by saint Ypolyte / And xlvij knights / heryng that the
queen and her daughter were becomen Christian / came with their wives to Iustyn
the priest / for to receive baptysme / Claudius the emperor / when Cyryll would
not do sacryfyse / did do cut her throat / and did do byhede the other
knights / And the bodies were borne with the other in to the feld Verane / and
there buried / And it is to be noted here expressly / that Claudyus succeeded
decyen / which martred saint laurence and saint ypolyte / but he succeeded not
decyan the emperor / For after the Cronykes Volusyan succeeded decyan / and
galyen succeeded volusian / And claudius succeeded galyen / so it behooves that
galyen had two names / that is to wete galyan and decyan / and so said Vyncent
in his Cronyke / and godeffroy in his book / Galyan called one unto his help
that was named decyan / whom he made Cezar / but not emperor / so says
Rychard in his cronyke / Of this martyr says Ambrose in his preface / The
blessid martyr Ypolyte considered / that Ihesu criste was very duke / and he
would be his knight / and had lever be his knight / than duke of knights And
he pursyewed not saint laurence which was put under his keeping / but followed
him / so that in suffryng martyrdom he left the law of the tyrant / and
came / and posseded the tresour of very rychesses / which is the glory of the
king pardurable and perpetuel / There was a carter / named Peter which yoked
his oxen in the carte in the feste of marye magdalene / and followed his oxen /
and began to curse them / And anon the oxen and the cart were smyten with
thonder / And that same peter / which had so cursed was tormented of cruel
torments / For fire took him / so that he burnt the senewes and the flessh
fro his thye / and the bone appeared / and that the thye and leg fill of /
then he went to a church of our lady / and hyd his leg in an hoole of
the church / And prayed our lady with teres deuoutely for his delyueraunce /
And on a night the blessed Vyrgyne with saint Ypolyte came to fore him in a
vysyon / And she prayed to ypolyte that he would restablysshe peter in his first
health / And anon saint ypolyte took his leg in the hole and took and set
it in his place / like as on graffyth in a tree / And he felt so much pain
in that vysyon / that he awoke and cried so loud / that he awoke all the
meyne / and they aroos and took light / and saw that peter had two legs and
two thyes / but they had supposed that it had be illusion / and they tasted yet
/ and yet efte again / and saw that he had verily his membrys / and then
they awoke him / and demanded of him hou it happed /

And he wend / that they had mocked him / And when he saw it / he was all
abashed / yet nevertheless the new thye was softer than the old / And might
not well sustain his body therewith / And by cause this miracle should be
publysshed / he halted an hoole year / And then the blessed Vyrgyne apperyd
to him and saint to saint Ypolyte / that he should perform that which
apperteyned to that cure / And then he awoke / and felt him self al hool And
then he entered in to a recluage To whom the deuylle apperid oftyme in the
lykenes of a woman naked / and joined to him naked / And the more he defended
him / the more the deuylle approached ner in temptynge him shamefully / And when
he had been shamefully trauayled of her / he took the stole of a priests neck
/ and gyrd him with hit / And anon the devil departed / And left lyeng there
a stynkyng and roten careyne / And so greet stenche issued / that there was
none that saw it / but said that it was the body of sum deed woman / which
the deuylle had taken

Thus ends the life of saint ypolyte
Here follows the assumpcion of the glorious vyrgyne our lady saint Marye
WE find in a book sent to saint Johan theuangelyst / or else the book
which is said to be apocriphum is ascrybed to him / In what manner the
Assumpcion of the blessid Vyrgyn saint Marye was made / Thappostles were
departed / and gone in to diverse Countrees of the world / for cause of
prechyng / And the blessed lady and Vyrgyne was in an hows by the mount of Syon
/ And as long as she lived / she vysyted all the places of her sone with great
devotion / that is to say the place of his baptysme Of his fasting / of his
passion / of his sepulture / of his resurection / and of his ascencion / And
after that Epyphanes says / she lived four and twenty year after thascencion
of her sone / And he says also / when our lady had conceived Ihesu Christ /
she was of the age of fourten year / And she was delyuerd in the xv year / And
lived and abode with him three and thyrty year And after his death / she lived
four and twenty year / And by this acompt when she departed out of this world
she was lxxij year old / but hit is more probable / that / which is red in
another place / that she lived after the ascencion of her sone twelve year /
And so then she was lx year old / And on a day when all thappostles were
sprad through the world in prechyng / the glorious vyrgyne was gretely esprysed
and embraced with desire to be with her sone Ihesu Crist / And her courage
eschaufed was moved / And great habundaunce of teres ran without forth by
cause she had not egally the comfortes of her sone / which were withdrawe^
from her for the time / And an angel came to fore her with great light / and
salewed her honorably / as the mother of his lord / saying / Al hayll blessid
Mary / receyuyng the blyssyng of him that sent his blessyng to Jacob / lo here
a bowhe of palm of paradis lady which I have brought to the / which thou
shall command to be born to fore thy bear / For thy soul shall be taken fro
thy body / the thirdde day next following And thy sone abides the his
honorable mother / To whom she answered / if I have found grace to fore thyn
eyes I pray the that thou vouchesauf to show to me thy name / And yet I pray
the more hertely / that my sons and my brethren thappostles may be assembled
with me / so that to fore I deye / I may see them with my bodily eyes / And
after to be buried of them / And they being here / I may yield up my ghoost to
god / And also yet I pray and require / that my spyryte yssuyng out of the
body / see not the horrible / ne wicked spyryte ne fend / And that no might of
the deuylle come ageynste me / And then the Aungel said / lady wherefore
desyrest thou to know my name / which is great and merueylous All thappostles
shall assemble this day to the / and shall make to the noble exequyes at thy
passing / And in the presence of them / thou shlat give up thy spyry^^ / For he
that brought the prophet by an here / fro Iudee to Babylone may without doubt
suddenly in an hour bring thappostles to the / And wherefore doubtest thou to see
the wicked spyrytes / sythr thou haste broken utterly his heed / And have
despoylled him from thempyre of his power / Nevertheless thy will be done /
that thou see not the fen^e / And this said the Angel mounted in to heaven with
great light / and the palm shone by right great clerenes and was like to a
grene rod / whoos leaves shone like to the morrow sterre / And it happed as
saint Johan the euangelyst prechid in Ephesym / the heaven suddenly thondred /
And a white cloud took him up / and brought him to fore the yate of the
blessed Vyrgyn Mary / And he knocked at the door / and entryd / and salewed the
Vyrgyn honorably / whom the blessid Vyrgyne beheld / and was gretely
abashed for Joy / and might not absteyne her fro weeping / And said to him /
Johan sone remember the of the word of thy master / by which he made me
mother unto the / And the a sone unto me / loo I am called of thy master / and
my god / I pay now the debt of condition humayne / And recomende my body unto
thy besy cure / I have herd say that the Jews have made a counceyll and said
/ late us abide brethren unto the time that she that bare Ihesu be deed / And
then incontinent we shall take her body / and shall cast it in to the fire
/ and brenne it / Thou therefore / take this palm / And bear it to fore the
bear when ye shall bear my body to the sepulcre / Then said Johan / O would
god that all my brethren thappostles were here / that we might make thyn
exequyes couenable / as it houeth / and is dygne and worthy / And as he said /
that all the Appostles were rauysshed with clouds fro the places where they
preached / and were brought to fore the door of the blessid Vyrgyne Marye / And
when they saw them assembled they merueyled / and said / For what cause has
our lord assembled us here / Then saint Johan went out and said to them /
that our lady should pass and depart out of this world / and added more to
saying / brethren beware and keep you from weeping when she shall depart / by
cause that the people that shall see it / be not troubled / And said / loo
these how they dread the death / which preche to other the resurection / And
denis disciple of pawle affermeth this same in the book of dyuyne names / That
is to wete / that all thappostles were assembled at the assumpcion and death
of our lady / Marye / and were to geder there / And that each of them made a
sermon unto the praysyng and laud of Ihesu Crist / and the blessed Vyrgyn his
mother / he said thus spekyng to Thymothee / Thus we and thou as thou well
know / And many of our holy brethren did assemble at the vysyon of the
mother / that received god / And James brother of god was there / And Peter
thappostle most noble and sovereign of the theologyens / And after that me
seemed / yt all the Ierarchyes lift her up after and acordyng to her virtue
without end / This said saint Denis / And when the blessid Vyrgyn Marye saw
all the Appostles assembled / she blessed our lord / and satte in the mids
of them / where the lamps tapres and lyghtes brenned / And about the third
hour of the night / Ihesu Criste came with sweet melodye and song with
thorders of the Angels the companyes of patriarchs / thassembles of martirs /
the Couentes of Confessors / the Carolles of Virgyns / And to fore the bed of
our blessid lady the companyes of all these saints were set in order / And
made sweet song and melodye / And what exequres were done of our blessid lady
and there halowyd / hit is all said and enseygned in the forsaid book / which
is attrybued to saint Johan / For first Ihesu Crist began to say / Come my
chosen / and I shall set the in my sete / For I have coueyted the beauty of
the / And our lady answered / Sire my heart is ready / And all they / that were
comen with Ihesu Christ entewned swetely saying / this is she that never
touched bed of ^aryage in delight / And she shall have fruit in refection of
ho^^y sowles / Then she sange of her se^f saying / All the generacions shall
say / that I am blessid / For he that i^ mighty has done great things to me
/ And the name of him is holy / And the chauntour of chauntours entewned more
excellently above all other saying / Come fro lybane my spouse / come fr^
Lybane / Come / thou shall be crowned / And she said I come / (...) in the
beginning of the book hi^ is wreton of me / that I should do thy will / For
my spyryte has Ioy^^h in the god / my health / And thus in the morning / the
soul issued out of the body / and fled up in the arms of her sone / And she
was as fer enstraunged fro the pain of the flesh / as she was fro corrupcion
of her body / Then said our lord to thappostles / Bear ye the body of this
Vyrgyne my mother in to the vale of Iosephat / And leye ye her in a new
sepulcre / that ye shall find there / And abide me there three days / tyll^
that I return to you /

And anon she was enuyronned with flowers of Roses / that was the company of
martirs / and with lylyes of the valeyes / that were the company of angels /
of Confessors / and Vyrgyns / And thappostles cried after her saying / Right
wise Vyrgyne / whyther gooste thou / lady remember the of us /

And then the company of saints that were abyden / were awaked with the
sown of the song of them / that mounted / and came against her / And saw
their king bear in his propre arms the soul of a woman / and saw yt this
soul was Joined to him and were abashed and began to cry saying Who is this
/ that ascends fro deserte fulle of delyces Joined to her to her friend / And
they that accompanied her said / this is the right fair among the daughters of
Jerusalem / And like as ye have seen her fulle of charity and dylection / so is
she ioyously received / And set in the sete of glory on the right side of her
sone / And thappostles saw the soul of her being so white / that no mortal
tongue might express it / And then three maidens that were there took of the
clothes fro the body / for to wesshe it / the body anon shone by so great
clernes / that they might well feel hit in touching and wasshyng / but they
might not see it / And that light shone as long as they were about the
wasshyng of it / And then thappostles took the body honorably / and leyde it
on the bear / And Johan said to Peter bear this palm to fore the buere / For
our lord has ordained the above us / And has made the pastor and prince of
his sheep To whom peter said / It apperteyneth beitre to the to bear it / For
thou art chosen Vyrgyn of our lord / And thou ought to bear this palm of
light / at thexequyes of chastyte / and holiness / thou that drankest of the
fontayn of perdurable clernes / And I shall bear the holy body with the byere
/ And these other Appostles our brethren shall goo round about the body /
yeldynge thankynges to god / And then saint powle said to him / I that am
lest of the Appostles and of you all / shall bear with the / And then Peter
and Powle lift up the bear / And Peter began to sing and say / Israel is
issued out of Egypt / And the other Apostles followed him in the same song /
And our lord couerd the bear and thappostles with a cloud / so that they were
not seen but the voys of them was herd only / And the Angels were with
thappostles syngyng / and replenysshed all the land with merueylous swetnes /
And then all the peuple was moeued with that sweet melodye and issued
hastily out of the cite / and inquired what hit was / And then there were
sum that said to them / that Mary such a woman is deed / and the disciples
of her sone Ihesu bare her and made such melody as ye here about her / And
then ran they to arms / and they warned each other saying / Come and late us
slay all the disciples / and late us brenne the body of her / that bare this
traytre / And when the prince of priests saw that / he was al abashed / and
full of anger ang said / loo here the tabernacle of him / that has troubled us
and our lygnage / behold what glory he now receives / And in saying so / he
leyd his hondes on the bear / wyllyng to torn it / and overthrown it to the
ground / Tun suddenly both his hands wexe dry / and cleued to the bear / so
that he henge by the hands on the bear / and was sore tormented / and wept
and brayed / And the Angels that were there in the clouds blinded all the
other people / that they saw no thing / And the prince of priests said / saint
Peter despise me not in this trybulacion / And I pray the to pray for me to our
lord / Thou ought to remember when the Chambriere that was vssher accused
the / And I excused the / And saint peter said to him / we be now empeshyd in
the service of our lady / and may not now entende to hele the / but and if
thou byleuest in our lord Ihesu christ / and in this that bear him / I wene and
hope that thou soon shall have health and be al hoole / And he answered / I
believe our lord Ihesu Crist to be the sone of god / And that this is his right
holy mother / And anon his hondes were losed fro the bear / but yet the
drye^nes and the pain cessid not in him And then saint peter said to him /
kiss the bear / and say I believe in god Ihesu Crist that this woman bare in
her belly / and remained Vyrgyn after the chyldyng / And when he had so said /
he was anon all hoole parfitely / And then said peter to him / Take that
palm of the hand of our brother Johan / and leye it on the people that be
blind / And who that will bileue shall receive his sight again And they
that will not believe shall never see / And then thappostles bare marye unto
the monument / And satte by it like as our lord had commanded / And at the
thyrdde day Ihesu crist came with a great multitude of Angels and salewed them /
and said pees be with you / And they answered / god / glory be to the / which
only make the great miracles and merueyles / And our lord said to
thappostles / what is now your aduys / that I ought now to do to my mother of
honor / and of grace / Sire it seems to us thy servants / that like as thou
have vaynquysshyd the death / and regnest world with out end / that thou reyse
also the body of thy mother / and set her on thy ryt side in perdurabylyte /
And he granted it / And then Mychael the angel came / and presented the soul
of Marye to our lord / And the saueour spacke and said / Arise up / haste the
my culuer or douue / tabernacle of glory / vessel of life / Temple celestyal /
And like as thou never feltest conceyuyng by none atouchement / thou shall not
suffer in the sepulcre no corrupcion of body / And anon the soul came again to
the body of marye / and issued gloryously out of the tomb / and thus was
received in the heavenly chamber / and a great company of angels with her / And
saint Thomas was not there / And when he came / be would not believe this And
anon the gyrdell / with which her body was gyrde came to him fro the air /
which he received / And thereby he understood that she was assumpt in to heaven
/ And all this here to fore is said / and called Appcriphum / Whereof saint
Ierom says in a sermon to paula and Eustochium / ber daughter / That book is
said to be apocryfum sauf that sum words which hen worthy of feythe / and
ben approved of seyntes as touching nine things / that is to wete / that the
comfort of thappostles was promised / and given to the Vyrgyne / And that all the saints assembled there / And that she deyde without pain / And was buried
in the vale of Iosephat / And there were made ready the obsequyes / and the
devotion of Ih^su crist / and the coming of the celestyall company / and the
persecucion of the Jews / and the shynyng of the miracles / and that she was
assumpt in to heaven body and soul / But many other things ben put there more
at fantasye and symulacion than at truth As that / that Thomas was not there
And when he came he doubted / and other things semblable / which ben better
not to believe them / than to bileue her clothes and vestymentes were left in
her tomb / to the comfort of good christian men / And of one party of her
vestymentes it is said that there happed such a great miracle as follows /
when the duke of Normandy had assyeged the cite of chartres / The bishop of
the cite took the cote of our lady / And set it on the head of a spear like
a baner / and went out against the enemies surely / and the people followed him
/ And anon all the host of thenemyes were turned in to franesye / and were
blind / and trembled / and all were abashed / And when they of the cite saw
this thing / above the dyuyne demonstraunce / they went on egrely / and slew
their enemies the which thing displesid much the vyrgyn saint Marye as it was
proved by that / that her cote vanysshed awey / And the duk their enemy fond
it in his lap / It is read in the reuelacions of saint Elysabeth / that on a
time as she was rauisshed in spyryte / she saw in a place much fer fro folk a
tomb or a sepulcre enuyronned with much light / and was like the form of a
woman within forth And there were about it a great multitude of angels / and a
little while after she was taken out of the sepulcre / and borne up on high
with that multitude / And then came against her a man beryng in his right arm
the sign of the cross / and had with him many angels without nombre / which
received her much ioiously / and led her with great melodye in to heaven /
and a litel while after / Elyzabeth demanded of an angel / to whom she spak
often / of that vysion that she saw / It is showed to the / said the aungel in
that vysyon that the vyrgyn our lady is assumpt in to heaven as well in her body
as in her soul / It is said in the same reuelacions / that it was showed to
her / that the xl day after the soul departed fro her body she was so assumpt
in to heaven and also / yt when our blessid lady spak to her she said / After
thascencion of our lord an hole year and as many days more as ben fro the
assencion unto her assumpcion she over lived / And also she said all
thappostles were at my departing / and buried my body honorably / And xl
days after was raised / And then saint Elyzabeth demanded of her / whether
she should hyde this thing / or that she should manyfeste it / and show it /
And she said / It is not to be showed to flesshely ne vnbyleuyng peuple / ne it
is not to be hyd to devout and christian people

It is to be noted / that the glorious vyrgyne Marye was assumpt and lift up
in to heaven entyerly / Ioyously and gloryously / She was received entyerly /
that is holly as the church byleueth debonayrly / And that afferme many
saints / and enforce them to prove it by many reasons / And the reason of
saint Bernard is such / he says that god has made the body of saint Peter
and saint James so gloryously to be honored / that he has enhaunsed them by
merueylous honor / that to them is deputed place couenable for to be worshipped
/ And all the world goth to seek and offer to them / Then if the body of his
blessid mother were on the earth And not haunted by devout vysytacion of
christian men / it should be merueyll to here / that god would not have done as
much worship to his mother and honored as much her body / as the bodies of
other saints upon the earth / Iherome says thus / that the Vyrgyn Marye
mounted in to heaven / the xviij kalendas of septembre / That he says this of
thassumpcion of the body of Marye / but the church will rather debonayrly
believe it / than folysshly to doubt it / And he preued it afterward / that it
is to be byleued / yt they yt aroos with our lord have accomplysshyd their
perdurable resurection / wherefore should not we say then / that it is done in
the blessid Vyrgyne Marye / and also many believe that saint Ioh^n the
euangelyst is gloryfyed in his flesh with Ihesu crist / And then much more
our lady ought to be gloryfyed in heaven both body and soul / which says /
worshipe thy fader and mother / And he came not to break the law / but to
fulfylle it / And therefore he honors his mother above all other / Saint Austyn
affermeth not this only / but he preueth it by three reasons And the first
reason is the unity and assemble of the flesh of our lord and of our lady /
And says thus putrefaction / and worms is the reproach of condycion humayne /
which Ihesus never touched / And the flesh of Ihesu is out of this repreef /
the nature of marye is out of thereof / For it is preued that Ihesu criste has
taken his flesh of her / The second reason is / that the dygnyte of the body
of her / of whom him self says / this is the syege of god / the chamber of
our lord of heaven / and the tabernacle of crist / she is worthy to be where he
is / so precious a tresour is more worthy to be kept in heaven than in earth

The thyrdde reason is parfyght entyernes of her vyrgynall flesh / and says
thus / Enjoy thou marye of honorable gladness in body and in soul / In thy
prppre sone / And by thy propre sone thou ought to have no harm of
corrupcion / where thou had none corrupcyon of vyrgynyte in chyldyng so
great a sone / so thou whom he endewed with so great glory be alwey without
corrupcyon / and live entyerly / which barest entyer him / that is parfyght of
all / And that she be with him whom she bare in her womb / and that she be
at him whom she chylded / gaf sowke / and norysshed / Marye mother of Ilesu
Crist admynystresse and servant / And by cause I may none other thing feel / I
dare none other wise say / ne presume / And hereof says a noble Versyfyer thus
/ Transit ad ethera / virgo puerpera / virgula Iesse / Non sine corpore / sed
sine tempore tendit ad esse / The vyrgyne that chylded mounted unto heaven / the
little rod of Iesse / not without body / but without time she entendeth to
be there vyrgyne pure and uette / Secondly / she was assumpte and take up
gladly And hereof says Gerard bishop / and martyr in his Omelye / The heuenes
received this day the blessid vyrgyne / The Angels were glad / tharchangels
enjoyed / The Thrones songen / The domynacyons maden melodye / The pryn^ypates
armonysed / The potestate^ harped / Cherubyn and Seraphyn songen louynges and
preysynges / And bryngyng her with thankynges and lauds unto the syege of the
dyuyne and sovereign mageste / Thyrdly / she was lift up in to heaven so
honorably / that Ihesu Crist him self with all the strength of the heavenly
company came against her / Of whom saint Jerome says / Who is he that is
suffysaunt to think how the glorious queen of the world went up this day /
And how the multitude of the celestyall legyons came against her with great
talent of devotion And with what songs / she was brought unto her sete / And
how she was received of her sone and embraced with peasyble chere and clear
face / And hou she was enhaunced above all other creatures / And yet he says /
it is on this day / that the Chyualrye of heaven came hastily for to mete with
the mother of god / and enuyronned her with greet light / and brought her to
her sete with preysynges and songs spyrytuel / And then enjoyed them the
celestyall company of Jerusalem with so greet gladness / that no man may
recounte / ne tell / and made joy and song all enioyeng in charity / by
cause that this feste is every year hallowed of us / and made and continued to
all other / And it is to believe / that the sauyoure him self came and met with
her hastily And brought her with him and set her in her sete with greet joy
/ And how had he acomplysshed otherwise that which he commanded in the law
saying / honor thy fader and mother / Fourtly / she was received excellently /
^ Saint Ierom says / this is the day / in which the Vyrgyn Mary not corrupt
went unto the hyenes of the throne / And she was there enhaunced in the
heavenly kingdom / And honouryd gloryously syttyng next unto Christ / And how
she is enhaunsed in the heavenly glory / Gerard the bishop reherceth in his
Omelyes / saying / Our lord Ihesu Crist may preyse this blessid Vyrgyne his
mother / as he did / and magnefye / so that she be contynuelly preysed of that
mageste and honored / And enuronned of the company of Angels enclosed with the
turmes of Archangels / posseded of the thrones / and gyrde about ^f the
domynacions / enuyronned with the service of the potestates / beclypped with
thembracementes of the pryncipates / enjoyed with the honors of the virtues /
obeyed with lauds and praysynges of the cherubyns / and possessed on all
parts with not recountable so^ges of the Seraphyns / And the over great and
ineffable Trynyte enjoys in her perdurable gladness / And his grace redoundeth
all in her / And makes all other to entende and awayte on her / the over
shynyng order of thappostles honor her with ineffable laud / the honorable
multitude of martirs besechen her in all manner / as to one so great a lady /
The felaushyp of Confessors innumerable continue their song to her / The right
noble and white company of vyrgyns make^ noble carollyng of the glory of her /
Hell full of malice howleth / And the cursed deuyls cry unto her / and dread
her / There was a clerk devout unto the Vyrgyye Marye / which studied every
day / how he might comfort her ageynste the pain of the five wounds of
Ihesu Crist saying thus / Rejoice the vyrgyne / and mother vndefowled which
receyuest the joy of the angels Enjoy that thou conceyuedest / Enjoy the /
that childest the light of clernes / Enjoy the mother / which never were
touched / All fetures and all creatures praise the mother of light / be thou
for us alweye prayeng to our lord /

And as this clerk had leyn long with an over great sekenes / And came toward
his end / he began to dread and was troubled / And our blessid lady appeared
to him / and said / Sone / where for tremblest thou by so great fore / which
have so often showed to me joy / be thou Ioyefull now thy self / And that thou
may enjoy perdurably come with me / There was a monk much Ioly and light
of his living / but devout to our lady / which on a night went to do his
folly acustomed / But when he passyd before the altar of her lady / he salewed
the Vyrgyne and so went forth out of the church And as he should pass a
River / He fylle in the water and drowned / and the deuyls took the soul /
then came Angels for to deliver it / And the deuyls said to them / wherefore
come ye hyder / ye have no thing in this soul / And anon the blessid Virgyn
Marye came / and blamed them / by cause they had taken the soul / which was
here is And they said that they had founden him fynysshyng his life in evil
works / And she said / hit is false that ye say / I know well / that when he
went in to any place / he salewed me first / And when he returned and came
again also / And if ye say / that I do you wrong^ / let us putt it again in
Judgment of the sovereign king / And when they strofe to fore our lord of this
matter / It plesyd him / that the soul should return again to the body And
repent him of his sins and trespaces / And then the brethren saw that
the matyns were over long differred / and sought the sextayn / and went to
the River / and found him there drowned / And when they had drawn the body
out of the water / what they should do / they wist not / and merueyled what he
had done / and suddenly he came again to life / and told what he had done / and
after finysshed his life in good works / There was a knight / which was mighty
and rich / that dispended folyly his good / and came to so great pouerte that
he / which had been acustomed to give largely great things / had need to
demand and ask the small / And he had a right chaste wife / and much devout
/ to the blessid Vyrgyne marye / And a great solempnyte approached at the which
the knight was acustomed to give many gifts / And he had nothing to give /
whereof he was gretely ashamed / And he went in to place deserte full of heaviness
/ and of weeping / so long that the feste was passed / for to wayle there his
euylle fortune / and for teschewe shame / And anon a knight much horrible
came syttyng on an horse / which arresonned the knight / and inquired of him the
cause of his great heaviness / And he told him al by order that / as was happed
to him / And this foul knight said to him / if thou wylt a little obey to me /
thou shall habounde in glory / and in richesse more / than thou were to fore /
And he promised to the devil / that he would do so gladly / if he acomplysshed
that he promised / And then he said to him / goo home in to thine hows / and
thou shall find in such a place there so much gold / and so much silver /
And thou shall find there also precious stones / And do so much / that such
a day thou bring me hither thy wife / And the knight returned home in to his
hows / and fond all thing like as the deuylle had promised / And anon he
bought a palace / and gaf great gifts / and bought again his heritage / and
took his men ageyn to him / And the day approached which he had promised to lead
his wife to the fend / And called her / late us goo to horse back / For ye must
come with me / unto a place fer hens / And she trembled and was aferd / and
durst not gaynsaye the commandment of her husbond / And she commanded her
self deuoutely to the blessid Vyrgyn Marye / And began to ride after her
husbond / And when they had ryden a good while / they saw in the weye a
church / and she descendid fro the horse and entrid in to the church / her
husbo^d abode without / And as she command her deuoutely to the blessid
Vyrgyne Marye in great devotion and contemplacion she suddenly slepte / And the
glorious Vyrgyne did on semblable habyte of this lady / and departed fro the
altar / and issued out / and mounted upon the horse / And the lady abode
slepyng in the church / And the knight wend / that she had been his wife / that
was with him / and went alwey forth / And when he was comen to the place
assigned / the deuylle came with a great Rese to the place / And when he
approached / and came ner / he quaked and trembled anon / and durst go no ner /

Then said he to the knight / thou most traytoure of all men / wherefore
have thou deceived me / and have rendryd to me harm for such great goods as
I have given to the / I said to the / that thou sholdest bring thy wife to me /
And thou have brought the mother of god / I would have thy wife / and thou have
brought to me Marye / For thy wife has done to me many iniuryes / wherefore I
would take on her vengeance / And thou have brought to me this for to tormente
me / and for to send me to hell / And when the knight herd this / he was
sore abashed / and might not hold him fro weeping / ne durst not speak for
dread and merueyle / And then the blessid Mary said Thou felon spyryte by
what folly durst thou will grieve and annoye my devout servant / this shall
not be left in the unpunished / I bind the in this sentence / that thou
descend in to hell / and that thou fro hens forth have no presumpcion to
grieve none that call upon me / And then he went awey with great howlyng /
And the man sprang down fro his horse / and kneled down on his knees to her
feet / And the Vyrgyn our lady blamed him / and commanded him to return
again to his wife / which yet slepte in the church / and bad him that he
should cast awey all the Rychesses of the deuylle / And when he came again /
he fond his wife yet slepyng / and awoke her / and told to her all that was
byfallen / And when they were comen home / they threw aweye all the rychesses
of the deuylle / and duellyd alwey in the louynges of our lady / and received
afterward many rychesses that our lady gaf to them

There was a man / which was rauysshed in Judgment to fore god / For he had
much sinned / and the devil was there and said / ye have nothing on this soul
/ but it ought to be mine / For I have thereof an Instrument publyque / To whom
our lord said / where is thyn Instrument / I have he said an Instrument / that
thou saydest with thy propre mouth / and have ordained it for tendure
perpetuelly / For thou saydest / in what hour that ye eten of it / ye shall
dye / And this is of the lygnage of them that took of the mete forboden And by
the right of this Instrument publyque he ought to be Iuged to me / And then
our lord said / late the man speak / but the man spack not /

And the devil said yet again / the soul is mine / For if he has done any
good deeds / the wykked deeds passen the good without comparyson / And then
our lord would not anon give sentence against him / so that he gaf him term of
eight days / so that at the end of eight days / he should appear again to
fore him / and give acomptes of all these things /

And as he went fro the vysage of our lord sorowyng and tremblyng he met
with a man / which asked the cause of his heaviness / And he told to him all by
order / And he said to him doubt the no thing / ne be not aferd / For I shall
help the manly for the first / And he demanded of him his name / And he said
Veryte / And after he found another / which promised to help him for the
second / And when he had asked his name / he said his name was rightwysenes /

At the eyghte day he came to the dome to fore the Judge / and the deuylle
opposid to him the first caas / and truth answered and said / We know well
that there is double death / corporelle and Infernal / and this Instrument that
the deuylle alleges ageynste the speaks no word of the death of hell / but
of the death of the body / And of that it is clear that al men be enclosed in
that sentence / that is to wit that he dies in his body / and that is not the
death of hell / And as touching the death of the body the sentence endures
alwey / but as to the death of the soul / it is repelled by the death of Ihesu
Criste / Then the deuylle saw / that he was discharged of the first /

Then he opposed and alleged the second / but rightwysenes came / and ansuerd
thus / how be it that he has been thy servant many years / netheles reason
gayn says it / For reason murmured alweye by cause he served so cruel a lord /
But at the thyrdde objection / he had none help / and our lord said bring
forth the balaunce / and late all the good and euylle be weyed / and then
truth and rightwysenes said to the sinner / Run with all thy thought unto
the lady of mercy / which sytteth by the Judge / and study to call her to
thyn help / And when he had so done / the blessid Vyrgyne marye came in to
his hel^e / and leyd her hand upon the balaunce on the side where as were but
few good deeds / And the deuylle enforced him to draw on that other side /
but the mother of mercy wan and obtained / and delyuerd the sinner /

And then he came again to him self / and amended his life / It happed in the
Cite of Bourges / about the year of our lord / v / C / and xxvij / that when
the christian men were comyned and hou seled on an eesterday / A child of a Jew
went to the altar with the other children / and received our lords body
with the other / And when he came home / his fader demanded him whens he came /
And he answerde / that he came fro scole / and that he had been howseled with
them at mass / And then the fader full of wodenes / took the child and
threw him in to a brennyng furnays that was there / And anon the mo^^^ of god
came in the form of an image / which the child had seen stondyng on the altar
/ and kept him fro the fire without taking any harm / And the mother of the
child with her great cryeng / made tassemble many Christian men / and Jews / the
which saw the child in the furnays without any harm or hurt / and drew him
out / And demanded him / how he escaped / And he answered and said / that
reverent lady which stood upon the altar / came / and help me / and put awey
all the fire fro me / Then the Christian men understanding this / to be
thymage of our lady / took the fader of the child / and threw him in to the
fornayce / which incontinent was brent and consumed / There were certain monks
to fore day stondyng by a river / and talked and iangled there of fables and
idle words / And they herd a great rowyng / and oores betyng the water coming
hastily / And the Monks asked / who ben ye / And they said we ben deuyls /
that bear to hell the soul of Ebronyen provost of the hows of the king of
France / which was Apostata in the monastery of saint Galle / And when the
Monks herd that / they doubted strongly / And cried high saint mary pray for
us / And the deuylles sayden / well have ye called Marye / For we would have
disioyned you / and have drowned you / by cause your dissolute and out of of
time Ianglyng / And then the Monks returned to their Covent / And the
deuylles went in to hell / There was a woman that suffered many greues and
iniuryes of a devil / which appeared vysybly to her / in the form of a man /
And she sought many remedies / now holy water / now one thing / now other /
but he cessed not And then an holy man counceyled her / that when he came to
her / that she should lift up her hands to heaven / and cry saint Mary help
me / And when she had so done / the deuylle fled all afraid / as he had be
smyten with a stone / and after stood and said / The cursyd devil enter in to
his mouth / that taught the that / And anon vanysshed awey / And never came
again /

Here follows yet of the assumpcion of our blessid lady /
THe name of thassumpcion of the right holy vyrgyn Marye is showed in a Sermon
/ made and ordained of diverse sayenges of saints / the which is read
solempnly in many chirches / and therein is contained all that I can find in
the world / In narracions of holy faders / of the departing out of this life
of the glorious vyrgyn Marye mother of god / that I have set here to the loving
and praysyng of her / Saint Cosme which had to surname vesture says / he has
learned of his forn goers / which did / that ought not to be forgoten / And
says that Ihesu christ ordained and disposed the life of his mother to be
fynysshed / he sent an Aungel acustomed / which showed to her to fore the
demonstraunce of her departing / that the death should not come suddenly / and
give to her tribulacion / And she had prayed him her sone face to face when he
was here in earth / that she should not see any wicked spyryte he sent then
to her the angel to fore with these words / It is time to take my mother with
me / / And thus as thou have replenysshed the earth with joy / so make heaven
to enjoy / Thou shall render the mansions of my fader joyous / And thou shall
comfort the spyrytes of my saints / Be not thou wroth to leave the world
corrumpable with hi^ couetyses / but take the celestyall palace

Mother be not aferde to be taken fro thy flesh / thou that art called to the
life perdurable / To Joy without faylyng / to the rest of pees / to sure
conuersacyon / to refection not recordable / to light not quenchable / to day
not euenyng to glory not recountable / to my self thy sone maker of all
things / for I am life perdurable / love not corrumpable / habitacion not
recordable / light without derkenesse / Bounte not estymable / I give without
trembling to the hertes ease / None shall rauysshe the out of my hand / For
in my hand ben all the ends of the world / Delyuere to me thy body / For I
have put in the my deyte / or godhede / The death shall never have joy on ye /
for thou have borne the very light / brekyng ne destruction shall not enuyronne
the / for thou have deseruyd to be my vessel / come thou anon to him / which
is borne of the for to receive the guerdons of the womb of the mother / and the
reward of thy mylk for my mete / Come now fast and have the to join the to me
thine only sone / I know well thou shall not be co^streyned for the love of
another sone than of me that shows the vyrgyn and mother / I show the a wall
of steadfast faith / thou art an Arche of sauacion / A bridge to them that flete
/ A staff to the feeble / A ladder to them that go up and mount to heaven / the
most debonayr advocate for synnars / I shall bring thappostles to the / of
whom thou shall be buried right of their hondes / For it apperteyneth to my
spyrytuel children of light / to whom I have yeuen the holy ghost to burye
thy body / And that they accomplysshe in thy person ye service of thy
merueylous departing out of the earth / And after that the aungel had
recounted these things / he gaf to our lady a bowhe of palm / sent fro the
plant of paradys / in token of the vyctorye ageynste the corrupcion of death /
and clothes of inmortalyte / and when he had al said / he styed up in to heaven
fro whens he came fro / Then the blessid vyrgyn mary assembled her neighbors
/ and said to them / I let you wete certainly / that I am at the end of my
temporell life / and shall hastily depart / wherefore hit behooves that ye wake
/ For to eueryche that shall pass out of this world / come gladly good angels
and wicked spyrytes / and when they herd this / they began to weep and say Thou
doubtest the syghte of the spyrytes / which have deserved to be mother of the
maker of all things / and barest him that robbed hell / which have deserved
to have the sete above Cherubyn and Seraphyn / how shall we do then / and
whyther shall we flee / and there were a great multitude of wymmen weeping /
And said that she should not leave them Orphans / And the blessid virgyn our
lady said in comfortyng them / ye that be moders of sons corruptyble may not
well suffer to be a litel while thens fro your children / how then ought not I
to desire to goo to my sone / which am mother and vyrgyn / and he is only sone
of god the fader / and if ye or any of you had but one sone / ye would desire to
see him / and be comforted in the lignage of him / and I then that am not
corrupt wherefore should not I be desirous to see him / which is life of al
creatures / and whiles they spak these things / the blessed saint Johan
theuangelyst came and inquired how the matter went / and then when our lady
had told to him of her hasty departing / he fylle down stretched to the earth /
and said with weeping terys / O lord / what ben we / wherefore sendest thou to us
so many trybulacions / Why have not thou erst taken awey the soul fro my body
/ and that I had been better vysyted of thy blessid mother / tha^ I should come
to her departing / and then the blessid virgyne bad him weeping in to her
chamber / And showed to him the palm and the vestymentes / which the aungel
had brought / and after leid her down in her bed / for to be there iyl her
passing / and anon after came a greet noise of thonder whytter than snow / in
which thappostles were brought to fore the yate of our blessid lady like as
it had rayned / so fill they down one after another / And as they merueyled of
this thing / Johan came to them / and told to them what the angel had showed to
our lady / And then they al wept and saint Johan comforted them / and then
they dried their eyes / and entryd in to the blessid vyrgyn / and salewed her
honorably and adoured / and she said to them / My dear children / god my sone
keep you all / And when they had told to her of their coming / she said to them
all their estate / And the appostles said / Right honorable lady and vyrgyn /
we in beholdynge the ben gretely comforted / like as we should be in our lord
and maystre / And we have only comfort in our self by cause we hope that thou
shall be medyatryce for us unto god / And then she salewed Powle by name /
god save the exposytour of my comfort / how be hit / that thou have sen^ Ihesu
Christ in his Flesh / Nevertheless I am comforted said saint Powle / that I
may see the in flessh And unto this day I have preached to the people that thou
have borne Ihesu Christ / And now I shall preche / that thou art borne up to
heaven to him / And after the vyrgyn showed to him that which thangel had
brought / And warned them that the lyghtes should not be put out tylle that she
were departed / And there were CC xx tapres And then she clad her with the
clothe of mortalyte / And salewed them all And ordained her body to abide in
her bed unto her issue and departing / And Peter stood at the head / And
Johan at the feet / and the other Apostles were about the bed / and gaf
laud to the vyrgyn mother of god / And then Peter began the song and said
/ Enjoy thou spouse of god in the chambres celestyall / / thou candelstyk of
lyt without derkenes by the is showed the everlasting light and clerenes / The
blessid Archebisstep of Co^stantynople wytnessith / that all thappostles were
assemblyd at the passing of the blessid vyrgyne marye the right sweet mother of
god / saying thus / blessed lady mother of god / thou that have received of the
nature humayn the death / which may not be eschewed / yet shall thou not sleep /
ne the eye shall not slombre that keeps the / Thy departing hens ne thy
dormycyon shall not be without wytnes The heuens recounte the glory of them
that songen over the in earth / and of them shall the truth be showed / The
clouds cry to the honor and to him that mynystreth to the / The angels
shall preche the service of life done in the by thappostles / which were
assembled with the in Jerusalem / And saint Denis Ariopagite witnessith the
same saying / We as I know well / and they and many of our brethren were
assembled for to see the body of her that bare god / And James the brother of
god / And Peter the right noble and sovereign of theologyens were present And
after it plesyd them / that after this vysyon / all the sovereign prestes
songen louynges after that each of them had conceived in his thought of the
bou^te of her / And saint Cosme in following the narracion says / And after
this a great thonder knokketh at the hows with so great an odor of swetnes
that with the sweet spyryte (...) hows was replenysshed / in such wise / that
all they that were there sauf the Apostles and three vyrgyns which held the
lyghtes slept / Then our lord ca^ with a great multitude of Angels / and
took the soul of his mother / And the soul of her shone by so great light /
that none of thappostles might behold it / And our lord said to saint Peter
Burye the corpse of my mother with great reverence / And keep it there three days
dylygently / And I shall then come again / and transporte her unto heaven
without corrupcion / And shall clothe her of the semblable clernesse of my
self / which that I have taken of her / And that which she has taken of me
shall be assembled to geder and acorde That same saint Cosme reherceth a
dredefull and a merueylous mysterye of dissencion naturell and of curyous in
quysycyon / For all things that been said of the glorious vyrgyne mother of god
/ ben merueylous above nature / and ben more to doubt than tenquyre / For when
the soul was issued out of the body / the body said these words Sire I
thank the / that I am worthy of thy grace / Remember the of me / For I ne am
but a thing faint / and have kept that / which thou delyuerdest me And then
the other awoke / and saw the body of the vyrgyn without soul And then
began strongly to weep / and were heavy and sorouful / And then thappostles
took up the body of the blessid Vyrgyne / and bare it to the monument / And
saint Peter began the psalm / In exitu Israel de egipto And then the
companyes of Angels gaf louynges and praysynges to the vyrgyne / in such wise
/ that al Jerusalem was meued for that great joy / so that the sovereign
priests sent greet multitude of people with gleyues and staves / and one of
them in a great furour ca^ to the bear / and would have throwe^ it down with ye
body of the blessid mother of god And by cause that he enforced him so
malycyously to touch and draw down the corpse / he lost his hondes by his
deseruyng / for both his hands were cut of by the wrestes / and henge on the
bear / and he was tormented by horrible sorrow / and he required pardon / and
promised amends / And saint peter said to him thou ^ayst in no wise have
pardon if thou kiss not the bear of the blessed vyrgyne / And that thou
confess also Ihesu Christ the sone of god to be fourmed in her / And then
when he had so done / his hondes were joined again to his wrestys and was al
hole / Then saint peter took a leef of the palm / and gaf hit to him / and
said / Go in to the Cite / and leye it on them that been seek / and they that
will believe shall receive health / And then when thappostles came to the
vale of Iosaphat / they fond a sepulcre like unto the sepulcre of our lord /
And leyd therein the body with great reverence / but they durst not touch hit
/ which was the right holy vessel of god / but the sudary / in which she was
wrappid and leyd it in the sepulture / And as thappostles were about the
sepulcre after the commandment of our lord / At the third day a cloud much
bryt enuyronned the sepulcre / And the vois of Angels was herd sown swetely /
And a merueylous odor was felt / sweet smellyng / And when our lord was come
and seen descended there / all were merueylously abashed / And he bare the
body with him of the blessid vyrgyn with much great glory / And then
thappostles kyssed the sepulcre and returned in to the hows of saint Johan
evangelist in preysyng him as kepar and guard of so noble vyrgyn / And
notwithstondynge one of thappostles failed at this great solempnyte And when he
herd so great miracles he merueyled and required with great desire / that her
sepulcre might be opened for to know the truth of all these things / And
thappostles denied it to him / all said that it ought ynow to suffyse the
wytnes of so great persons / to the end that lest parauenture the mysbyleued
men should say / that the body were stolen aweye / or drawn by theft / And he
then which was angry said / why defend ye to me that / which am semblable
to you in your common tresours / And at the last they opened the sepulcre /
and fond not the body / but they fond only but the vestymentes and the
sudarye / / Saint Germayn Archebisshop of Constantynople says that he fond
wreton in t^ystorye enthymothyen / in the third book of the xl Chappytre / And
the same wytnessyth the great damascyen / that as the noble emperesse Helene in
mind of holy church had made many chirch^s in Constantynople / among all
other she edefyed in the time of Marcian the emperor at balthenes a merueylous
chirch in thonour of the vyrgyne Marye / and called Iuuenal archebisshop of
Jerusalem / and all the other bisshops of palestyne / which duellyd then in
the cite ryall for the seen which had be holden in Calcedone / and she said to
them We have herd say / that the body of the right holy vyrgyn our lady is
in su^che a place in such a tomb in the vale of Iosephat / We will then
that for the guard of this Cite / that the body of that blessid vyrgyn be
transported hyder with due honor and reverence / And Iuuenalle answe^de to
her like as he had founden in Ancient hystoryes / that the body was borne in
to glory / and was not in the monument / for there was no thing left but the
vestymentes and the sudary only / And tho vestymentes Iuuenall sent then in
to Constantynople / and were there leid honorably / And late no man wene that
I have made this of my propre head and engyn / but I have set it here which
I have by doctrine and stu^y learned of the lesson of them / which by tradicion
and lernyng of their forn goers have received it / And hyderto endure the
words of the said Sermon /

Yet of thassumpcion of our blessid lady
Verily Johan damascene / which for the time was a greek / says many
merueilous things of thassu^pcion of the right holy and glorious vyrgyne marye
/ For he says in his sermons / that this day the right holy and sumptuous Arc
/ which bare within her / her maker was brought and set in the temple /
which was not made of hondes / On this day the right holy culuer or douue /
Innocent and simple fled fro the arc / that is to say fro the body in which
god received and fond rest / On this day ye vyrgyn that conceived / not
knowing the passions erthely / but enduced by thente^dements celestyall shall
not fail / but shall be called very heaven / soul dwelling in the celestyal
tabernacles / And how be hit that the right holy soul be separate fro her
blessid body / And that her body was leyd in sepulcre / nevertheless it is not
deed / ne shall not be corrupt by rotyng / That is to wete / the body of whom
childyng / the vyrgynyte remained without any hurtyng or dissolucion and is
transported to better and more holy life without corrupcion of death for to
remain in the tathrnacles / perdurable And like as the son shynyng clear
otherwhyle is hyd and apperyth faylyng a short time / yet she has nothing lost
of her light / but in her self is the fontayne of light perdurable / And thou
art the fontayne of light without wastyng the tresour of life / how be it that
by short interualle / or space of time thou shall be brought to corporell
death / Nevertheless thou gyuest to us habundantly clerenes of light with out
defaute / And thyn holy dormycion or shepyng is not called death / but a passing
or departing / or more propyrly a coming / For thou departing fro the body /
camst to heaven / And Ihesu Christ / Angels and Archangels / And all the heavenly
company came to mete the / The foul and dampened spyrytes doubt much thy noble
and excellent coming / And thou blessid and glorious vyrgyn thou wentest not to
heaven / as did Helye and thou mountest not as powle did unto the third heaven
only ^ut thou came and touchedest the syege ryall of thy sone / The death of
other saints may well be said death / for that death makes them blessid / but
she has no place in the / For thy death / ne thy tra^smygracion or thy
perfection or thy departing makes the not ne gives to the surete to be
blessid / for thou art beginning myddell and end of all weles and goods /
which excede thought humayne / Thy surete / thy very perfection / and thy
concepcion without s^ed / And thy dyuyne habytacion have made the blessid /
whereof thou saydest thy self / that thou art not made blessid by thy death / but
of thy concepcion in all generacions / And death has not made the blessid / but
thou have ennoblysshed the death / in taking awey the heaviness and sorrow thereof
/ conuertyng it in to Joy For god said lest parauenture the first form of man
/ that is to wete Adam put forth his hand / and take of the tree of life / and
live perdurably / how then shall not she live in heaven perdurably that bare
this life / which is perdurable / and without end / Sometime god putted out of
paradys the first parents which slepte in the death of sin buried fro the
beginning of in obedyence and glotony / and now she that has borne life to all
humayne lignage / and was obedyent god the fader / and put awey fro her all
ordure of sin / how shall not she be in heaven Wherefore should not she enjoy
the yates of heaven / Eve stretched her ere to the serpent / of whom she took
the venym mortal / And by cause she did it for delight she was subdued to beryng
and bryngyng forth children in sorrow / and pain / and was condemned with Adam
But this blessid vyrgyne that enclyned her ere to the word of god / whom the
holy ghost replenysshed which bare in her womb the mercy of the fader
which conceived without knowledge of man / and childed without pain / and
sorrow / how durst death swolow her how myyht any thing have corru^cion / that
bare life / And yet says the said damascene in his sermons / Verily the
Apostles were departed thorugh the world in all countries and ente^ded to
preching to men and to draw them out of the deep derkenesse by one holy word /
and brought them to the table celestyall / and to the solemn espousaylles of
God / And then the dyuyne commandment / which is a net or a cloud
brought them fro all the parties of the world in to Iherusalem in assemblyng
them between his wings / And then Adam and Eve our first parents cried /
Come to us right holy / and wholesome Celyer / which fulfyllest our desire /
And the company of saints / which was there said ageyn / Remain with us our
comfort / And leave us not orphelyns / thou art the comfort of our trauaylles
/ refresshyng of our swetynges / that if thou live / hit is to us a glorious
thing / to live with the And if thou dye / it is glorious to us to deye with
the / how should we be in this life / and shall be detestable fro the presence
of thy life / And as I suppose / such things / and semblale sayden thappostles
with great plente of them of the church with great waylynges and syghes in
compleynyng them fro the departing / And she retornyng toward her sone said /
Sire I pray the to be very comfortour to my sons whom it plesyd the to call
brethren / which ben heavy and sorouful of my departing / And with that I
shall bliss them with my hand / give to them thy blyssyng upon my blyssyng /
And then she stretched out her hand / and blessed / all the college of
good Christian men / And then said after / lord I commend my spyryte in to thy
hands receive my soul thy love / which thou have kept without blame of
sin / to thy self / And I commend my body to the earth for to keep it hoole
/ or where it shall plese the to enhabyte it transporte me to the / so where
thou art the^fantement or fruit of my womb / that I be duellyng wi^h the /
All these words herd thappostles / Then said our lord / Arise up my
beloved / and come to me / O thou most fair among wymmen my love / thou art
fair / and no spotte of fylthe is in the / And when the right blessid Vyrgyn
herd that she commended her spyryte in to the hands of her sone /

Then thappostles were bedewed with teres / and kyssed the tabernacle / And
by the blessyng and holiness of the h^ly body / who someuer touched the bear
deuoutely were heled of what someuer sekenes they had / deuyls were chaced fro
demonyakes / The air and the heaven Were puryfyed by thassumpcion of the soul
/ and the earth by the de^^sicion of the body / And the water was sayntyfyed by
the wasshyng of the body / For the body was wasshen with right holy water and
clean / And the holy body was not made clean by the water / but the water was
hallowed of her / And after the holy body was wou^den and wrapped in a clean
sudary / and was leyd upon the bed / and lamps burnt full bright about her /
Oyggnementes gaf a great and fragraunt odor / the louynges and preysynges of
angels resowned / And thappostles and other that were there song dyuyne songs
/ And the Arc of our lord was borne / in to Mount of syon unto the vale of
Iosephat upon the ^ heedes of the Apostles / And the Angels went to fore some
/ And sum followed the body / And other conveyed her / And she was accompanied
of all the plente of the church / And some of the Jews herd hit in their
evil malice / descended down fro the Mount of syon / and one of them which
was a membre of the deuylle ran folyly unto the holy body / And assaylled it
for to have cast it to the earth drawyng hit with both his hands / and both
his hands cleuyd to the bear / and were departed fro the body / like as two
staves had been sawed of / and so he was like a tronke / til that f^yth changed
his thought / And he waylyng soroufully repented him / and they that bare the
bear tarried / and made that Jew worshipe and touch the holy body / and then
came his hands again in to their first estate / and then was the body borne
unto the vale of Iosephat / and there it was em^raced and kissed and songs
songen of holy ^ouynges and preysynges / and there were wept many teres / and
then yt holy body was leid in the tomb honorably / but her soul was not
left in hell / ne her flesh felt never corrupcion

And they sayden / that she was the well / which never was dygged / the field
not ^red / The vygne not cut / tholyue berynge fruit / which shall not be
holden in the bosom of the earth / For hit apperteyneth / that the mother be
enhaunced with the sone / And that she mount to him like as he descended in to
her / And that she that has kept her virgynyte in her childyng / ought to see
no corrupcion / And she that bare the creatoure of all the world in her belly /
ought to duelle in dyuyne tabernacles / And that she whom the fader had taken
to espouse / were kept in the chambres celestyalle / And tho things that
long to the sone / ought to be posseded of the mother / And all this said
Johan damascene /

Yet of thassumpcion of our lady aftir saint Austyn
Saint Austyn shows autentyckly in a sermon of the right holy assumpcion of
our blessid lady sayen^ we yt have bego^n^ to speak of the body of ye Vyrgyn
per^urable and of thassumpcion of her blessid sowl^ We say thus / First that we
find nothing of her wreton / sith that our lord hangyng on the Cross /
commanded her to his disciple / sauf that Luke records in his wrytynges
saying / that all they were by one courage perseueryng with the Vyrgyne Marye /
mother of our lord Ihesu christ / what is then to say of her death / and of
her assumpcion / Whereof the scripture reme^bryth no thing / It is then as me
seems to be inquired thing which is acordynge to truth / without which /
Auctoryte is nothing / we remember the condition humayne / We doubt not to
say / that surely she went to temporal death / And if we say that she is
resolved in to common putrefaction / in worms and in to ashes or dust / It
behooves us to weye and think such thing as apperteyneth to so great
holiness / and to the seygnorye of such a chamber of god / We know well that
it was said to the first fader / thou art poudre / and in to poudre thou shall
return / but the fless^ of Ihesu Christ escaped fro this condycion / For his
flesh suffered never corrupcion / Then is except fro this general sentence
the nature taken of the Vyrgyne / And god said to the woman eve / I shall
multyplye thy dyseases / and thou shat bring forth children with pain and
sorrow / But marye suffered never such dyseases / of whom the sword of sorrow
perced (...) soul / But Marye childed without sorrow And then if she were
ouyte / and had no part of sorrow in childyng / then ought she not to have
pa^te of dyseases ne of corrupcion / ^ut she is except of sum other
generalytees / by cause that the dignyte gafe to her such seygnorye / And
though we say / that she suffered death / yet is she not retained with the
bonds of death / if o^re lord would keep his mother entyer and hoole and the
chastyte of her vyrgynyte / Wherefore may he not keep her without corrupcion of
stenche of rotynnesse / It apperteyneth then unto the debonayrte of our lord
/ to keep thonour of his mother / which was not come to break the law / but to
accomplysshe it / And in his life had worshipped her to fore al other by the
grace of her conceyuyng / And therefore we ought well to believe that he honors
her at her death with synguler salvation / and of special grace / And rotynes
and worms ben but reproach of humayne condycyon / And when Ihesu christ is out
of that reproach / the nature of Marye is excepted / the which is the nature
that he took of her / For the flessh of Ihesu christ is the flessh of Mary /
the which he bare above the sterres / in worshypyng man above nature / and in
worshypynge more his mother / if he be sone of the very mother / Then is it
couenable thing / that she be mother of the same sone / Not as to the unity of
the Person / but to the unity of bodyly nature / if grace without propyrte of
especial and te^porell nature may make unity how much more then may the grace
of corporal / and especial natyuyte / make unity of grace / like as the
disciples in Ihesu Crist / of whom he says him self / that they ben one as we
be / And after he says / Fader I will that where I am / they be with me / And
then if he will have with him them / that been joined so with him in the
feythe / and that they be Iuges with him / what shall then be iuged of his
mother / Where is she worthy to be but in the presence of her sone / Therefore I
understand and believe / that the soul of marye be honored of her sone / by a
right excellent prerogatyf possedyng her body gloryfyed in Ihesu Crist / whom
she conceived / And why should not she possede her body gloryfyed / by which
she conceived / For so great an halowyng is more worthy to be in heaven than in
earth / The sete of god / the Chamber of our lord / and the worthy tabernacle
of Ihesu Christ ought and apperteyneth better to be there / as he is / than else
where / and so right precious tresoure is more worthy to be in heaven / than in
earth / And by right no resolucion of rotynnes may not follow so great
entyernes of thing not corumpable / And by cause I feel not that the right
holy body be not delyuerd in to mete of worms / I doubt to say it / And by
cause that the yefte of grace incomparable surmounteth gretely this estymacion
that I feel / that the consideracion of many scriptures admoneste me to say
truth / God says sometime to his mynystres Where as I am / there shall be my
mynysstre / if this sentence be generalle to all them / that have mynystred
Ihesu christ by faith and by work / how is there any more special than Marye /
For with out doubt / she was admynystresse in all work / For she bare him in
her belly / she childed him / she nourisshed him and leyd him in the Crybbe /
she went with him in to egypt / and kept him all her life / unto the death of
the Cross / and departid not fro him / but followed him / his dyuynyte might
not be to her incredyble / For she knew well / that she had not conceived of
the seed of man but by dyuyne Inspyracion / then she having feyth in the
puysaunce of her sone as of ye virtue of god not chau^ge^ble said / when the wyn
failed / Sone they have no wyn / she wist / that he might do all thing / And
he acomplysshed anon that miracle / And then see thou / that Marye was
admynystresse of Ihesu Christ by feythe and work / Then if she be not where
as Ihesu crist will that his mynystres be where shall she be then / And if
she be there Is it not by grace pareylle and like And if it be not egall /
where is the egall mesure of god that renders to eueryche after his deserte /
For by the deserte of Marye is given to man ly^yng much grace / Shall then
the grace be lassed to her being deed / Nay nay / for if the death of al
saints be precious Certes I Judge the death of Marye to be right precious /
which is received to the Joys perdurable / by the debonay^te of her sone
Ihesu Crist / more honorably than the other / whom he had honored by grace
tofore his other saints And I say / that she ought not to be put / ne is not
set to the common humanyte after the death / that is to wete / of worms / of
rotynnesse and of pouldre she that bare in her belly the savior of all men /
if the dyuyne Volente vouchesauf to keep the vestymentes of the children from
hurtyng among the fla^mes of fire / why should not he then in his mother that
which he kept in a strange vesture / It plesyd him to keep Jonas in the belly
of the whale with out corrupcion / should not he then keep his mother not
corrupt / he kept danyell a live in the pytte of lions fro there disatempered
honger out he not to keep Mary for so many yeftes of meritees and dgnytees and
we know well that all these dygnytees that we have said have not kept nature
/ For we doubt not but grace has kept more the entyernes of Marye than
nature / And then our lord makes Marye to enjoy in her propre sone / both
in soul and in body / as she that never had tatche / ne spot of corrupcion in
bryngyng forth so great a sone / For she is alwey with out corrupcion that
was fulle of so much grace / She is living entyerly / she that childed the
life of all / And then if I have said / as I ought to say / Ihesu Criste
approve it thou and thine / And if I have not said as I ought do say / I pray
the to pardone me thou / and thine /

Thus ends the history of thassumpcion of our blessid lady Saint Marye
Here follows the life of saint Rock
Saint Rock was borne in Mou^tpeler which is a Town ofgrete name upon the
bordure of France / and was borne of noble progeny His fader was lord of
Mountpeler / and was named Johan / and was comen of the noble hows of france /
And though he was noble of birth and rich of lordship / he was also virtuous
in all humanyte / he had a wife of noble kynrede and fair of vysage / named
libera / which both deuoutely served our lord Ihesu Crist / and lived in
dyuyne love and holy works / And how well that they thus had lived long / yet
had they no child ne heyr / wherefore they often made their prayers / And vowed
pylgremages / And on a day most specially / the wife made her prayers to our
blessid lady prayeng deuoutely for to have a child / and was in very
contemplacion / in which she h^rde the voys of an angel seyeng / O Lybera god
has herd thy prayer / and thou shall receive of him grace of thy peticion /
And anon she went to her husbonde / and told him as she had herd of the
Angel / And then they hereof ioyeful accomplysshed thacte of matrymony / and
she conceived / and at ^yme was delyuerd of a sone / which in his batpysme was
named Rochus / or Rock And this Rock had inpressid in the sholder on his lift
side a cross / which was a token that he should be acceptable and byloued of
god / which thing when his fader and mother saw they blessid god / and his
mother her self nourysshed and gaf sowke to the child / and fed it / And
commysed and did gladly the other besynes of a nouryce / which devout mother
fasted twyes in the weke / And the blessid child rock absteyned him twy^s also
when his mother fasted in the weke /

And would sowke his mother but ones that day / which was to al a great wonder /
and that day he was gladder / meryer and swetter than the other And after
when he came to five year of age / he disposed him to the works of penance /
and was much obedyent to fader and mother / And in the twelft year of his age /
he fasted many and diverse fastings for Crystes love / And the more his
membrys grew / the more the cross / that to fore was spoken of appeared larger
and more apparaunt /

In that time the fader of saint Rock was seek / and saw his last end
approach / and called to him his sone rock and said / O mine only sone Rock
thou see well that I shall shortly fynysshe my life / alwey the will of god
be fulfilled and four things with my lordship and heritage I leave to the and
co^ma^de y^ tacomplysshe / First like as thou have begone / that thou serve
besyly god / Socondly that thou remember pour people / wydowes and Orphans /
Thyrdly I co^stytute and ordeyne the governor and dyspensatour of al my
tresours / that thou dispende them in charytable and meke works / And fourthly
that with all dylygence thou haunte and freque^te the hospytalles of seek and
pour men / These foresaid things Rock promised to his fader to fulfylle them
to his power / And anon after his fader deyde / whom Rock buried honorably
/ and leyd it in a sepulture / And in the xx year of his age he buried also his
devout mother / And in few days he executed the testament of his fader
effectuelly / And vysyted Relygyous places of pour people / wretches oppressid
/ and seek men he cured by counceylle and works / wydowes and Orphans he
comforted / and pour maidens to marye he releued / And in these good offices
and works he dispended his faders goods / And when he had fynysshed his
faders commandments he decreed to leave the contre of Mount p^ler / and to
make and seche other diverse pylgremages / and clad him with thabyte of a
pilgrim / and couerd his head with a bonet / a scryppe on his sholder / and a
pylgryms staf in his right hand / and so departed / and after many desert^
places he came to Rome / but to fore he came in to a town called in latin Aqua
pendens where as was a common and hard pestylence / which when Rock knew of
many by the wey / he desytously went unto the hospytal of that town called
water hangyng / and gate with great prayers and labor of one Vyncente / which
had the rule of thospytal that he might there day and night serve the seek
people / Vyncent was aferd / and dredde / lest Rock which was a young flouryng
man should be smeton with the pestylence / but after that he came / them that
were seek / he blessid in the name of Christ And as soon as he had touched the
seek men they were al hoole / And they said and confessed as soon as this holy
man Rock was comen in / all they that were vexed and seek / And the fire of
pestylence had infected / he extynetyd it / and delyuerd all the hospital of
that sekenes / And after he went thorugh the Town / And each hows / that was
vexyd with pestylence / he entryd and with the sign of the Cross^ and mind of
the passion of Ihesu crist he delyuerd them all fro the pestylence For whom
someuer Rock touched / anon the pestylence lest him / And when the town of
water falling was delyuerd fro the contagyon of the pestylence / rock went to
the Cite of Cenes which is a great cite of ytalye which no less pestylence
vexed / And he it in a short place delyuerd it fro the pestylence / And fro
thens he came to come / which was then so full of pestylence / that uneath
in all the Town could not be founden one hows wyd thereof / In tho days there
was at Rome a cardynal of the title of Anglerye / which is a prouynce of
lombardye / and the blessid Rock came in to this cardynals place / And as he
stood to fore him a little / suddenly a merueylous comfort and hope entrid in to
the courage of the cardynal / he understood the young man saint Rock to be
right dear with god / For his chere / his manners / and his attemperaunce showed
it / wherefore he commended him to Rock / that he should deliver him fro the
pestylence / and conserve him / And then Rock did sign in the cardynals
forhede / and made with his fyngre a cross / And anon an apparaunt sign and
a very cross was seen impressid in his forhede And so the cardynal was
preserved fro the pestylence / Nevertheless for the nouelte of the thing / he
prayed saint Rock that the token of the cross should be take awey / lest thereby
he should be to the people a new spectacle / Then Rock exhorted the cardynal
/ that he shall bear the sign of the cross of our redemer in memory of his
passion in his forhede perpetuelly / and worshipe it reverently / by which
sign he was delyuerd fro the hard pestylence / The cardynal then brought
saint Rock to the pope / which anon saw that is godly / a bright raye and
heavenly shynyng out of the forheede of Rock / And after when his dyuyne
virtue was known to the pope / Rock opteyned of him full remission of sin /
Then the cardynal bygan tenquyre of Rock of his lygnage and of his Country /
but rock affectyng no mortal glory hyd his lignage / and received again of
the pope his blessing / and departed fro him / And abode at Rome with the same
cardynall three year contynuelly / and labored in vysytyng and helpyng the
pour people and them / that were seek of the pestylence / And after three year
the cardynall being old deyd / And Rock for soke Rome / and came to the Town of
Armyne a noble Cite of Ytalye / Which also he delyuerd fro the said pestylence
/ And when that Town was delyuerd / he went to the Cite of Manasem in
lombardye / which was also sore oppressid with seek men of the pestylence /
whom with all his heart he served dylygently / And by the help of god made
that town quyte of the pestylence And fro thens went to placence / For he
understood yt there was great pestilence Rock was ever of great study / how he
might in the name of Ihesu / and of his passion / deliver mortal men fro the
hurt of pestylence / And so an hole year he vysyted the howses of pour men /
and they that had most need to them / he did most help / And was alwey in
tho spytal / And when he had been long in tho spytall of placence / and had
heled almoost all the seek men there in / About mydnyght he herd in his sleep
an Angel thus saying / O Rock most devout to christ awake / and know thou
that thou art smeton with the pestylence / study now how thou may be cured /
And anon he felt him sore taken with the pestylence under his both arms /
And he thereof gaf thankynges to our lord / And he was so sore vexid with the
pain / that they that were in thospytall were depryued of their sleep and rest
of the nyt / Wherefore saint rok aroos fro his bed and went to the vtterist
place of thospytalle / and lay down there abydyng the light of the day / And
when it was day the people going by / saw him accused the master of thospytal
of offense that he suffered the pilgrim to lie without thospital but he purged
him of that defaut saying that the pilgrim was smyten with the pestylence / as
ye see / And vnwetyng to us he went out / Then the Cytezeyns incontinent
put out saint Rock fro the Cite and subarbes / lest by him the Cite might be
the more enfected / Th^nne saint Rock sore oppressid with fervent pain of the
pesstylence / suffered pacyently him self to be eiecte out of placence / And
went in to a certain wood / a deserte valeye not fer fro placence / alweye
blyssyng god / And there ^s he might / he made him a lodge of bows and leaves /
alwey gyuyng thankyng to our lord / saying / O Ihesu my savior I thank the
that thou put me to afflyction / like to thine other servants by this
odyous ardour of pestylence / and most meke lord I byseche the to this deserte
place / give the refrygery and comfort of thy grace / and his prayer fynysshed
anon there came a cloud fro heaven by the lodge that saint Rock h^d made with
bows / where as sprange a fair and a bright well / which is there yet unto
this day / whose water saint Rock dra^k being sore a thurst / and thereof had
great refresshyng of the great hete that he suffered of the pestylence fever /
There was nygh unto that wood a little vyllage / in which sum noble men
dwelled / among whom / there was one well byloued to god named gotard which had
great husbondry / and had a great famylye / and h^usholde / This Gotard held
many hounds for huntyng / among whom h^ had one much famylyer / which boldly
would take bread for the lord / And when Rock lacked bread / that hound by
the ru^ueaunce of god brought fro the lords lord bread unto Rock / which
thing when gotard had aduertysed often that he bare so awey the bread / but he
wist not to whom ne whither / wh^rof he merueyled / and so did al his
household / And the next dinner / he set a dellcate loof on the lord / which
anon the hound by his new manner took aweye and bare it to Rock / and Gotard
followed after / and came to the lodge of saint Rock / and there beheld how
famylyarly the hounde delyuerd the bread to saint Rock / then gotard
reverently salewed the holy man and approached to him / but saint Rock dredyng
lest the contagyous air of the pestylence might enfecte him / said to him /
Friend goo fro me in good pees / For the most vyolente pestylence holds me /
Then Gotard went his wey and left him / / and returned home / where by
gods grace he said thus to him self all stylle / This pour man whom I have
left in the wood and deserte / certeynly is the man of god / sith this hound
without reason brings to him bread I therefore that have seen him do so /
ought sonner to do it / which am a christian man / By this holy medytacion
Gotard returned to Rock / and said holy pilgrim / I desire to do to the that
thou nedest / and am auysed never to leave the / Then Rock thanked god which
had sent to him gotard / And he informed gotard besyly in the law of Christ /
And when they had been a while to geder / the hou^d brought no more bread /
Gotard axyd cou^ceyll how he might have bread / for more and more he hongred
and axed remedy of saint Rock / Saint Rock exhorted him after the text saying
/ In the swette of thy vysage thou shall ete thy bread / and that he should
return to the Town / and leave all his goods to his heirs / and follow the
wey of christ / and demand bread in the name of Ihesu / Then gotard was
ashamed to do so where he was known / but at the last by the besy admonycion
of saint Rock / Gotard went to placence / where as he had great knowledge / and
beggeth bread and alms at the door of one his gossyb / That same gossyb
thretened sharply Gotard and said / he shamed his lygnage / and friends by
this foul and indecent beggyng / And put him awey being wroth and scornyng
him / For which cause Gotard was constreyned to beg besyly at the doors of
other me^ of the Cite / And the same day the gossyb / that so had said to
gotard was taken sore with the pestylence / and many other that denied alms
to gotard / And then anon the Cite of placence was enfect with contagyous
pestylence and gotard returned to the wood / and told to saint Rock all that
was happed / And saint Rock told to gotard to fore / that his gossib should
hastily dye which was done in deed / And saint Rock meued with pity and mercy
being full seek went in to placence being full of pestylence / And left gotard
in the wood / And though saint Rock were sore vexed with the pestylence / yet
he with great labor went to placence And with touching and blyssyng he help
and heled them all / And also cured thospytal of the same Cite / And he being
sore seek and almost lame returned again to Gotard in to the wode / And many
that herd that he and Gotard were in the place of the desert valeye came te
them / whom he found al with Rock / And to fore them all he did these
miracles / the wild heestes which wandered in the wood / what hurt sekenes /
or swellyng they had / they ran anon to saint Rock / and when they were
heled / they would enclyne their heedes reverently / and goo their weye / And a
little while after Gotard and his felawes for certain necessitees / and erandes
returned in to placence / And left that time saint Rock allone in the valleye
/ and saint Rock made his prayers to almighty god / that he might be delyuerd
fro the wou^des of pestylence / And in this prayer he fyl a sleep / And in the
mean while returned fro the Cite / And when he came and joined him to Rock
slepyng / he herd the vois of an angel saying / O Rock friend of god / our
lord has herd thy prayers / lo thou art delyuerd fro the pestylence / and
art made al hoole And our lord comaundeth that thou take the weye toward
thy country / with this sodeyn voys gotarde was astoned / which never to fore
knew the name of Rock / And anon Rock awoke and felt him self al hole by
the grace of god / like as the Angel said / And Gotarde told unto Rock / how
he had herd the aungel / and what he had said / then saint Rock prayed
gotarrd that he should keep his name secret^ / and to tell it to noman / For he
desired no worldly glory / Then after a few days saint Rock with gotard
and his felawes abode in the desert and informed them all in godly works /
And they then began to wexe holy / wherein he exhorted them and confermed /
and left them in that deserte valeye / And saint Rock as a pilgrim doing
peuau^ce intended brennyng in the love of god toward his Country / and came to
a prouyuce of bombardye called Anglerye / and applied him toward almaynewhere
the lord of his prouynce made war with his enemy / whoos knights took saint
Rock / as a spy / and delyuerd him to thr lord as a traitor / This blessid
saint alweye confessing Ihesu crist was deputed unto an hard and strayte
prison / And the blessid Rock pacyently went in to prison / and suffered it
gladly / where day and night remembryng the name of Ihesu comme^dyd him to god
prayeng / that the prison should not disproufyte him / but that he might have it
for wyldernes and penance / And there he abode five year in prayers / In the
end of the fyfthe year when god would / that his soul should be brout in to ye
felaushyp of his saints / and be alweye in the sight of god / he that bare
mete to saint Rock in to the prison / as he was acustomed every day / he saw
a great light and shynnng in the prison / And saint Rock knelyng on his knees
prayeng which all these things he told to his lord / And the fame hereof
ran all about the cite / so that many of the Cytezeyns ran to the prison
by cause of the nouelte of this thing / And there saw and byhelde it / and gaf
laud thereof to almighty god / and accused the lord of cruelte / and woodenes /
Then at the last when saint Rock knew by the will of god / that he should
fynysshe his mortal life / called to him the kepar of the prison / and prayed him
that he would goo to his lord / and to exhort him in the name of god / and of
the glorious vyrgyn Marye / that he would send to him a priest / of whom ^^ he
deyd he would be confessid / which thing was anon done / And when he had
confessid him to the pr^est / and deuoutely taken his blessyng / he prayed him
that he might abide allone three days next following for to be in his
contemplacion / by which he might the better have mind of the most holy
passion of our lord / For Rock felt well tho / that the cytezeyns prayed the
lord for his delyueraunce / which things the priest told to the lord / Aid
so it was granted to saint Rock tabyde there allone three days / And in the
end of the third day / the Angel of god came to saint Rock saying thus / O
Rock god sends me for thy soul / of whom in this last part of thy life /
that what thou now desyrest / thou sholdest now ask and demand / Then
saint rok prayed unto almighty god with his most devout prayer / that all
good christian men which reverently prayde in the name of Ihesu to the blessid
Rock might be delyuerd surely fro the stroke of pestylence / And this prayer
so made / he expyred / and yaf up the ghooste / Anon an Angel brought fro
heaven a table dyuynely wreton with lettres of gold in to the prison / which he
leyde under the head of saint Rock / And in that table was wreton / that god
had granted to him his preyer / that is to wete / that who that calls
mekely to saint Rock / he shall not be hurt with any hurt of pestylence /
And then after the third day the lord of the Cite sent to the prison /
that saint Rock should be delyuerd out of hit / And they that came to the
prison fond saint Rock departed fro this life / And saw thoru all the prison
a merueylous light / in such wise / that without doubt they byleued him to
be the friend of god / And there was at his head a great tapre brennyng / and
another at his feet / by Which tapres all his body was light / Ferthermore /
they fond under his head the foresaid table / by which they knew the name of
the blessid Rock by auctoryte / which name known / the mother of the lord of
that Cite knew many years to fore saint Rock to be the sone of the lord Johan
of Mountpeler / which was brother germayne to this lord / of whom we have said
/ which thing / and all that was done was by cause they knew not his name /
Then they knew him to be neuewe to the lord / and also by the sign of the
cross / which saint Rock ^are as to fore is said / that he had hit / when
he was borne out of his moders belly / Then they being thereof penytent and in
great waylyng and sorrow / At last with all the people of the cite they buried
saint Rock solempnly and relygyously / which soon after the holy saint was
canonysed by the pope gloryously / And in his glorious name and honor they
builded a great and a large church / Then late us reverently with devotion
pray unto this glorious saint / saint Rock that by his intercession and
prayer we may be delyuerd fro the hard death of pestilence and epydemye / and
that we may so live in this life and be penytent for our sins / that after
this short life we may come unto everlasting life in heaven Amen / The fest of
saint Rock is alwey holden on the morn after the day of thassumpcion of our
lady / which life is translated out of latin in to English by me William
Caxton /

Thus ends the lif of saint Rock
Here follows the life of saint Bernard the mellifluous doctor. And first of
thynterpretacion of his name
BErnard is said of that is a pytte or well and nardus which is the gloss /
says upon cantica is an humble herb and of hot nature and well smelling /
He was hot in brennyng love / humble in conuersacyon a well in flowyng
doctrine / a pytte in depenes of science / and well smellyng in swetenes of
fame / his life has wryton Abbotte William of saint Theoderyk / and the felawe
of saint bernard / and hernalous thabbot of boneualle



Saint Bernard was borne in Burgoyn in the Castle of fontaynes of noble lygnage
/ and much relygyous / Whoos fader he et Celestyn / and was a noble knight in
the world / and much religious to god And his mother was named Aleth / She had
seven children / six males / and one femele / The men children she norysshed
all for to be Monks / and the daughter for to be a Nonne / And anon as she
had a child / she offryd it to god with her own hondes / She would refuse
strange breasts / For like as she fed hem with her moderly milk / so fed
she them with nature of goodenes And as long as they grew and were under her
hand she norysshed them more for desert than for the Court / For she fed
them with more common and grosser metes / like as she would have sent them right
forth in to deserte / And as she bare the thyrdde sone / which was Bernard in
her belly / she saw in her sleep a dreme / which was a demonstra^ce of things
to come / Her seemed / that she had in her belly a whelp al white and read upon
the bucke / barkyng in her belly / And when she had told her dreme to an holy
man / he answered to her prophecyenge Thou art mother of a right noble whelp /
which shall be a wardeyn of the hows of god / and shall gyu^ great barkynges
against the enemies / For he shall be a noble prechour / and shall guarysshe
much people by the grace of his tongue / And as Bernard was yet a little child /
he was seek of the heed ache / and there came a woman to him for to charm him /
and there by to assuage the grievous ache of his head but he put her fro him
cryeng by right great indignacion / And the mercy of god failed not to his
enfancye in good love / For he aroos and felt that he was delyuerd thereof /

In the blessed night of the natyuyte of our lord when the child Bernard
abode in the church thoffyce of matyns and coueyted to know / what hour
Ihesu christ Was borne / The child Ihesus appeared to him / as he had be borne
again out of his moders belly / wherefore as long as he lived / he supposed
that hour to be the hour of the natyuyte of our lord / And ever after as long
as he lived was given to him in that hour more parfyght wit / and spech more
habondaunt / in such things as apperteynen to the sacrament / And after that
he made a noble work among all his other works / of the laud and preysyng
of god and his blessid mother / In the which work he expowned the lesson
euangelyk / how the Angel Gabryel was sent to the vyrgyne marye / And when
thau^cyent enemy saw the purpoos of the child full of health And bente
against him many gynnes of temptacion / And on a time when he had holden his
eyes / and fixed them upon a woman / he had anon shame in him self / and was a
cruel venger of self / For he lepte anon in to a ponde full of water and frorn
/ and was there in so long / that al most he was frorn And by the grace of god
he was coled fro the hete of carnal concupiscence About that time by
instygacion of the deuylle / a maid leyde her in his bed by him al naked
there where he slepte And when he felt her / he let her lie in that side of
the bed that she had taken / and turned him to that other side / And
slepte / And she tarried a space of time / and felt him / and ketild him / and
would have drawn him to her entente / And at the last when she felt him
vnmeuable / though she were unshamefast / yet she was ashamed and all confused
aroos / and went her wey Another time as he was herbour^hed in the hows of a
lady / she considered the beauty of this young man / and was gretely achauffed /
and strongly desired his company / And then she ordained a bed out fro the
other / And in the night she aroos without shame And came secretly to him /
And when he felt her / he cried thieves / thieves / And she fled / and light a
candel her self / and sought the thief / and none was founden / And then each
man went to his bed again / but this unhappy woman rested not / but aroos
again / and went to the bed of Bernard as she did to fore / And he cried
thieves / thieves / And the thief was sout / but he was not fou^den / ne
publysshed of him which knew her well / And yet was she chaced the thyrdde
time / And then with great pain she cessed / what for dread and despayr /
And on the morn as they went by the wey / his felaws repreued him of that he
had so dremed of thieves / and inquired of him what it was / And he answered /
Verily I have suffryd this night the assaylynges of a thief / For mine hostess
enforced to take awey fro me tresour not recouerable / And then he bythought
him self that it was not sure thing to duelle with the serpent / And thought
for to flee it / And then he ordained him to enter in to the order of Cistews
And when his brethren knew it / they would have taken him from that purpoos /
and our lord gaf to him so great grace / that they might not torn him fro his
conuersyon / but he brought all his brethren / and many other to religyon /
Nevertheless Gerard his brother a noble knyt supposed alwey that they were vain
words / and refused alwey his monestementes and techynges / And then Bernard
brennyng in the faith and in the spyryte of broderly love of charity said /
My brother I know well that one sharp trauayll shall give understanding to thyn
eres And after that he put his fyngre on his side / and said to him / one
day shall come / and that soon / that a spear shall perce thy side / and
shall make wey to thyn heart for to take the cou^scylle / that thou now
refusest / And a short time after Gerard was taken of his enemies / and was
hurt on the side in the place / where his brother had set his fyngre / And
was put in prison fast bounden / And then came to him Bernard / And they would
not suffer him to speak to him / And he cried on hye / Gerard brother / know
thou that we shall goo shortly / and enter in to the monastery / And that
same night the bounds of Gerard brake / and fylle of / and the door opened by
him self / and he fled out / and said to his brother / that he had changed
his purpoos / and would be a monk / And this was in the year of thyncarnacion
of our lord / a M / C / and xij / in the xv year of the order of Cysteaux /
The servant of god Bernard at the age of xxij year entryd in to the order of
Cysteaux / with moo than thyrtty felawes / And as Bernard issued with his
brethren out of his faders hows / Guy that was the oldest saw Vynard his
younger brother / which was a little child / and played with the children / And
said to him / Vynage brother / all the possession of our heritage shall
apperteyne to the / And the child answered not as a child / and said / ye shall
then have heaven / and leave to me only the earth / This part is not euenly ne
right wysly divided / And after the child abode a little while with his fader /
but afterward he followed his brethren / when the servant of god Bernard was
entryd in to the order / he was so esprysed and in all thing occupied in god
/ that he used no bodily wits / He had been a year in the celle of Nouyces And
yet he wist not whether there were any wyndowes on the hows or no / and oftymes
he had entryd and gone out of the church / where as in the head were three
wyndowes / And he supposed / there had been but one / And thabbot of Cystraux
sent of his brethren for to edyfye the hows of Cl^reuaux / And made Bernard
there Abbot / which was there long in great pouerte / which often made his
potage with leaves of holme / And the servant of god waked over man's power /
And said that he lost no time / but when he slepte / And said that the
comparyson of sleep and of death were like semblable / so they that sleep ben
like as death were with men / and like as deed men ben seen slepyng to god / he
was uneath drawn to any mete for delight of appetyte / but only for dread of
faylyng / And he went to take his mete / like as he should have gone to a
torment / And he was alwey acustomed when he had eten / to wete if he had eten
to much or more than he was acustomed / And if he had so done / he would
punysshe him self / so that he refreyned his mouth / that he lost a great
party of the savor and tastyng of his mete / For sometime he drank oil / when
it was given him by error instead of drink / He said that the water was good
allone and refresshyd him well / And he perceived not / that he drank oylle /
but when his lyppes were enoynted / sum told him thereof / And sometime and
other while he ete the fat of raw flessh instead of butter / He said that
all that he had learned of holy scripture / he had learned it in woods / in
feldes / most by medytacion and prayenge / And confessid / that he had none
other maistres but Oaks and Holme treees / this confessid he among his friends
/ At taste he confessyd that sometime when he was in medytacions or prayeng /
him thought / that all holy scryptures apperyd to him expowned / On a time as
he reherseth in canticis / that he would put among the words such as the holy
ghoost counceyled him / And whiles he made that traitye he would thynk of good
courage / what he should do when that were made / And then a voys came to him
saying tylle thou have acomplysshed this werk thou shall do none other / he
had never playser in clothing / he said that fylthes were in demonstraunce of
neclygence / And outrageous clothyng was folly gloryfyeng him self in commysyng
outward vain glory / he had in his heart alwey this proverb / and often said
it / who does / that noman does / all men wondre on him / he ware many years
the hair / And as long as he might hyde it / he ware it / And when he saw
that it was known / he left hit anon / and took him to common vesture He
lawghed never / but if he made gretter force to laughe than to refrain him He
was wont to say / that the manner of pacyence was in three manners / of in
iuryes / of words / of damage / of things / and of mysdoyng of the body / On
a time he wrote a letter to a Bishop friendly / and admonested him amyably /
And he was much wroth / and wrote to him a letter saying thus at the
beginning / Gretyng to the / that haste the spyryte of blasphemye / To whom he
answered / I suppose not to have the spyryte of blasphemye / ne have said euylle
to any man / but only to the prince the devil /

An Abbot sent to him syx honderd mark of silver for to make a couente / but
all the money was robbed by theuys by the wey / And when saint Bernard herd
thereof / he said none other thing / but blessed be god that has spared me fro
this charge / Chanon reguler came to him / and prayed him much / that he would
receive him to be a Monk / And he would not acorde hit to him / but counceyled
him to return to his church / he said to him / why haste thou so much in
thy lokes preysed prefection / if thou will not show it / and deliver it to
him / that coueyteth it / If I had thy books I would al to rende them / And
Bernard said to him / thou have not read many of them / but that thou myghtest
be parfyght in thy Cloystre / I preyse in all my books the correction of manners
And not the mutacion of places / And the chanon being all araged lepte to him
and smote him on the cheke that it was read and swollen / And they that were by
aroos against this cursyd man for to have smeton this cursyd man / but Bernard
came bitwene cryenge / and coniuryng by the name of Ihesu Christ that they should
not touch him / ne do him none harm He had a customme to say to the Nouyces
/ that would enter in to Relygyon / leave there without your body / that will
enter in to Relygyon / leave the body without / that ye have taken fro / the
world / And join you to themthat ben hew withynne / late the spyryte enter
only / For the flesh prouffyteth no thing

Saint Bernardes fader went in to the Monastery / and dwelled there a certain
time / And after deyde in good age / The suster was married in to the world /
And on a time she arrayed and apparaylled her in Richesse and delyces of the
world / And went to the monasterye for to vysyte her brethren in a proud
estate and great apparaylle / And he dradde her / as she had be the deuylle
or his net for to take sowles / ne would not goo out for to s^e her / And
when she saw / that none of her brethren came ageynste her / One of her
brethren that was portyer said to her / that she was a foul ordure stynkyng
wrapped in gay array / And then she malte al in teres / and said / if I be a
synnar / god deyd for synnars / And by cause I am a sinful woman I come to
ask counceylle of them that been good / if my brother despise my flesh / he
that is servant of god / he ought not to despise my soul / late my brother
come / And what he shall command me / I shall do / And she held that
promise / And he came with his brethren / And by cause she might not depart
fro her husbond / he taught her to despise the glory of the world / and showed
to her / how she should ensyewe the steps of her mother / And then when she
came home again / she was so sore changed / that in the myddle of the world
she lad the life of an heremyte / And al straunged from the world / In the end
she vaynquysshed her husbond by prayers / and was assoilled of her vow / and
entryd in to a monastery / On a time saint Bernard was sore seek / so that him
seemed / he should give up his spirit and was at his end as him seemed in a
trau^ce / and him thout yt he was to fore god in judgment and there was ye devil
on ye other side which put on him many accusacio^s and reproaches / and wha^ he
had al said / bernard said without fere dread or wrath / I confess me that I
am not worthy to have the kingdom of heaven / by mine own merytes / but our
lord / which holds me by double right / as his heritage / and by the merytes
of his passion / by that one he is content / And that other he gives to me /
by which gift I out not to be confounded / but it apperteyneth to me by right
/ And thus he was confused / and the vysyon failed and the man of god came to
him self and destrayned his body by so great trauaill of fastings and
wakynges that he languysshed in contynuel maladye / that he might not follow
the covent / but with pain /

On a time he was so grievously seek that all the brethren p^^yd for him so
that he felt him a l(...)ell alleged and eased of his pain / Then he did
do assemble all his brethren and said / wherefore hold ye so wretchyd a man
/ ye be stronger / and have vaynquysshed / I pray you / spare me and late me
goo / This holy man was elect of many Cytees for to be a bishop specially of
the Cite of Iene / and the cite of Melane / And refused hit not folyly / ne
granted thereto / but said to them that required / that he was not his own /
but deputed to other / And by the counceylle of this holy man / the brethren
so provided by the auctorite of the pope / that none might take him from them /
which was their joy to have him /

On a time when he vysyted the order of Chartrehows / and when the brethren
were well edyffyed by him / one thing there was that moeued a little the pryour
of the place / and that was the sadel that saint Bernard rode on was over
precious / and showed little pouerte of the brethren / and the pryour told hit
to one of the brethren / And the brother said it to saint Bernard / And he
merueyled / and axed / what sadle it was / and sent for hit / For he wyste not
what sadle hit was / how well he had ryden upon hit fro Clereuaulx to the
chartrehows / he went all a long day by the lake of lozane / and saw not the
lake / ne took head of hit / And at even as his felawes spak of that lake / he
demanded where was that lake / And when they herd that / they merueyled
strongly / For certeynly the humblenes of his heart vaynquysshed in him the
heyght of name / For the world couthe never enhaunce him so high / but he
allone humbled him self the more / he was reputed sovereign of all / and he
acounted him self lest and most low / And at the last he confessyd / that
when he was among his sovereign honors and favors of the people / him seemed /
that there was another man changed in him / or as he had been in a dreme / And
there where he was among the most simple brethren / he vsyd most amyable
humylyte / there he ioyed / there fond he him self / and that he was returned
in to his own person / he was alwey founden to fore the hours or redyng or
writing / or in medytacions or in edifyeng his brethren by word On a time as
he preached to the people And that they al understood deuoutely his words /
such a temptacion arose in his heart / verily now prechest thou well / now art
thou well herd of the people / and art reputed wise of them all / And the holy man felyng him to be put in this temptacion / rested / and tarried a while / and
thought whether he might say more or make an end* And anon he was comforted
by die / uyne aid answered softely to him that temptyd him / I neither began
by the / ne I shall not end by the / And so performed surely all his Sermon
/ A Monk that had be a Rybaude in the world and a player tempted by a wicked
spyryte would return again to the world / And as saint Bernard retained him
/ he demanded him / whereof he should live / And he answered to him / that he
couthe well play at the dyse / and should well live there by / And saint Bernard
said to him / If I deliver to the any good / wylt thou come again every year /
that I may part half gayn with the And he had great Joy thereof / And
promised him so to do / And then saint Bernard said that there should be
delyuerd to him twenty shyllynges / And he went with all / And this holy man
did this for to draw him again to the relygyon as he did after / And he
went forth / and lost all / And came again al confused to fore the yate /

And when saint Bernard knew him there / he went to him ioyously / and opened
his lap for to part the gain / And he said / fader I have won ne nothing /
but have lost your catayll receive me if it plese you to be your cataylle / And
saint Bernard answerde to him swetely / if it be so / it is better that I
receive the / than lose both that one and that other /

On a time saint Bernard roode upon an horse by the way / and met a vylayn by
the way / which said to him / that he had not his heart ferme and stable in
prayeng / And the vylayn or up londyssh man had great despyte thereof / and said
that he had his heart ferme / and stable in all his prayers / And saint
Bernard which would vaynquysshe him and show his folly / said to him /
depart a little fro me / and begin thy pater noster in the best entente thou
can / And if thou can fynysshe it without thynkyng on any other thing /
without doubt I shall give to the the horse that I am on / And thou shall
prom yse to me by thy faith / that if thou think on any other thing / thou
shall not hyde it fro me / And the man was glad / and reputed the horse his /
and granted it him / and went a part / and began his pater noster / And he
had not said the half when he remembryd if he should have the sadle with all /
And there with he returned to saint Bernard and said that he had thought in
prayeng / and after that he had no more will to auaunce him /

There was a Monk of his / named brother Robert nyghe to him self as to the
world had he deceuoed in his childehode by thentysement of sum persons / And
was sent to thabbey of cluny / and thonourable man left him a while there /
And he would call him again by lettres / And as he endyted the lettre by clear
day / and another Monk wrote hit / A rain came suddenly v^on them / And he that
wrote would have hyd the parchemyn fro the rain / And saint Bernard said /
this work is the work of god / write on har^yly / and doubt the no thing /
And then he wrote the letter in the mye^des of the rain without being wete
/ And yet hit rayned all about them / For the virtue of charity took aweythe
moisture of the rain fro them / A great multitude of flies had taken a church
that he had do make / so that they did much harm to all them that came
thither / And he said I curse and excomyne them / And on the morn they were
founden al deed /

He was on a time sent fro the Pope to Melane for to recouncyle the Church /
And when he had done / and was returned / A man of Melan brought to him his
wife / which was demonyake / And anon the deuyll^ began to myssaye him
thorugh the mouth of the wretchyd woman / and said thou etar of porrette /
wene thou to take me out of mine hows / nay thou shall not / And the holy man
saint Bernard sent him to saint Sire in his Church / And the said saint Sire
gaf the honor to his host / And heled her not / And thus was she brought
again to saint Bernard And then the devil began to cry and say /
neither Sire / ne Bernard shall put me out / And saint Bernard said / Sire
ne Bernard shall not put the out / but our lord shall put the out / And
as soon as he made his prayer / the wicked spyryte said / Ha / A / how gladly
would I issue from hens / For I am here tormented grievously / But I may not
/ For the great lord will it not / And the holy man said / who is that Lord /
And he said Ihesus of Nazareth / And saint Bernard said / saw thou him ever
/ And he answered ye / Bernard said / where saw thou him / And he said in his
glory / And saint Bernard asked him / and were thou in glory / And he said ye
/ How wentest thou fro thens / and he said with lucifer many of us fill / all
these he said by the mouth of the woman that every man herd / Then said to
him the holy man / would not thou go ayene in to that glory / And he said
mowyng merueylously / it is to lade / Then the holy man prayde / and the
wicked spyryte issued out of that woman / but when the man of god was departed
thens / the wicked spyryte entrid again / And her husbond came after the holy man / and told him what was happed / and he made to bind a writing about her
neck conteynyng these words / I command the in the name of our lord Ihesu
christ that thou be not so hardy to touch more this woman / and he durst never
after touch her / There was a pyteous woman in Guyan / which was vexyd with a
devil that duellyd in her / and vexyd her merueilously six year during in
vsyng her his lechery / / And the holy man saint Bernard came in to tho parties
/ And the deuylle menacyd her / if she went to him / that it should not
proufyte her / And if she went / he that was her love / should be to her a
cruel persecutour / but she went surely to the holy man / And told to him
weppyng strongly what she suffered / / And he said / take this staf / which is
mine / and leye it in thy bed / And if he may do any thing / late him do it
/ and she did so and leyd it in her bed / And he came anon / but he durst not
go to his werk acustomed / ne presumed to approach her bed / but he thretened
her right egrely / that when he was gone / he would avenge him right cruelly on
her / And when she had said this to Bernard / he assembled the peuple / that
eueryche should hold a candel brennynge in his hand / and came to this devil /
and with all them that were there he cursyd him and excomyned / and defended
that never after he should so do to her / ne to none other / And thus was she
all delyuerd of that Illusion / And when on a time as this holy man as a legate
in to that prouynce for to reconcyle the duke of guyan to the church / And he
refused to be reconciled in all manners The holy man went to the altar for to
sing mass / And the duke abode without the church as excommyned / And when
he had said Pax domini / he leyd the body of our lord upon the patene / and
bare it without the chirch And went out with a face flammyng and brennyng /
and assailed the duke by ferdfull words saying / We have prayed the / and thou
have despised us / boo here is the sone of the vyrgyne / which is comen to the
/ which is lord of the church whom thou persecutest / this is thy Judge / in
the name of whom al knees bow / in the hands of whom thy soul shall come
/ despise him not as thou have his servants / resyste him if thou may /
Then anon the duke wax all styf and was inpotent in all his membrys / And
then he fylle down at his feet / And the holy man put his foot at him / and
commanded him to arise / and to here the sentence of god / he then tremblyng
aroos and accomplysshed anon that the holy man commanded / On a time as this
holy man saint Bernard entryd in to Almayne for tappease a great discord / there
was an Archebisshop that sent an honorable clerk against him / And when the
clerk said to him / that he had be sent fro his maystre against him the holy man answered to him and said / another lord has sent the / And be merueyled
and said that he was sent of none other / but of his lord thar^h^bisshop / And
saint Bernard said / sone thou art deceived / our lord Ihesu Christ which
has sent the is gretter master / And when the clerk understood him / he
said / sire wenest thou / that I will be a Monk / nay / I thought it never /
ne hit came never in my heart / yet after in the same vyage he forsook the world
/ and received thabyte of this holy man saint Bernard / He took also on a time
in to the (...) a noble knight / And when he had followed saint Bernard a little
time / he began to be grievously tempted / and when a brother saw him so heavy
/ he en^uyred him the cause of his heaviness And he answered him / I wot well I
shall never be glad / And the brother told it to saint Bernard / and he prayed
to god much ente^tifly for him / And anon that brother that was so pensyf and
so heavy seemed more joyous than the other / and more glad / than he had been
to fore heavy / And the brother blamed him / by cause he had said that he should
never be joyous / And he answered and said / I wot well I said I should never be
glad / but I say now / that I never shall be soroufull / when saint Malachyel
bishop of Irlond / of whom he wrote the life full of virtues passid out of
this world out of his monasterye blessydly to our lord Ihesu christ / And saint
Bernard offryd to god for him sacryfyce of helithe / he saw the glory of him
by reuelacion of our lord / and by thyn spyracion of god / he changed the
form of prayer after the communyon saying thus with Joyous voys / God that
have acompanyed saint Malachyell by his merytes with thy saints / we pray the
to give to us / that we that make the feste of his precious death may follow the
examples of his life / And when the chantour herd him / he said to him / and
showed that he erred And he said I err not / but I know well what I say / and
then went to the body / and kyssed his feet / And in a time that the lent
approached / he was vysyted of diverse knights / And he prayed them that at the least in these holy days they should absteyne them fro their vanytees / their
Iolytees / and doing outrages / and they in no wise would agree thereto / And
then he bad make ready wyn and said to them / drink ye the health of your
sowles / and when they had dronken the wyn / they were suddenly changed / and
went to their howses / and they that had denied to do a little time / they
gaf to god after all the time of their life / and ladde a right holy life / At
the last the holy saint Bernard approchyng to the death said blessydly to his
brethren / I require and commanded you to keep three things / the which I
remember to have kept to my power / as long as I have been in this present life
/ I have not wylled to sclaundre any person / and if any have fallen / I have
hid hit as much as I might / I have ever trusted less mine own wit than
any others / If I were hurt / I never required vengeance of the hurter / I
leave to you charity / humylyte and pacyence / and after that he had done many
miracles and had made Clxxj monasteryes / and had ordained many books and
trayttyes / he accomplysshed the days of his life the lxiij year of his age /
in the year of our lord a MClvj / he slepte in our lord among the hands of
his sons / and his glory showed his departing hens to much people / He
appyered to an abbotte in a monasterye and admonested him / that he should
follow him / and he so did /

And then saint Bernard said / we be comen to the Mount of Lybane thou shall
abide here / And I shall ascend up an hyhe / And he asked him / wherefore he
would gone up / And be said for to learn I will go up / And he being gretely
admerueyled said / what wylt thou (...) fader / to whom we believe / that there
is none to the like / ne holden so wise in science / as thou art / And he
said here is no science / ne here is no knowledge of truth / but there above is
plente of science / And on high is the veery knowledge of truth / And with
that word he vanysshed aweye / And then that Abbotte marked that day / and
found that saint Bernard was then passed to our lord / which showed for him
many miracles / And Innumerable / To whom be given laud and preysyng
everlasting Amen

Thus ends the life of the glorious doctor saint Bernard
Of saint Thimothe and interpretacion of his name
THimothe is as mohe to say as holding dread / Or of timore that is dread /
and theos a word of greek / which is deus in latin / and god in English / as
the dread of god

Of saint Thymothe
Saint Thymothe was taken under New of the prouoste of Rome / and was grievously
beten / and had quyk lyme put in his throat and upon his wonndes / And he
rendryd thankynges to god with all his heart / And then two Angels came to him
/ saying / lift up thyn head to heaven And then he byheld / and saw the
heaven open / and Ihesu Christ which held a double crown / and said to him
thou shall receive this of my hand / And a man named Appollynare saw this
thing / and did him to be baptized / And therefore the provost commanded / that
they tweyn to gyder / perseueryng in the confession of our lord should be
byheded / about the year of our lord / lvj /

Thus end the passions of Thymothe and Appollynare
Here follows of saint Symphoryen
SYmphoryen was borne in the Cite of Augustydynense / And he being a young child
shone in so great habondaunce of virtues / that he surmounted the life of
thauncyentes / And as the paynyms hallowed the fest of Venus / Symphoryen was
there / and would not worshipe thymage to fore Eraclye the provost / And then
he was long beten / and after set in prysonne / And they would have
constreyned him to do / sacryfyse / and promised to him many yeftes / He
answered and said / Our lord can well reward the merytes / And also he can
well punysshe the sins / Then the life that we owe to god of debt / late us
pay with good will Slow penance / is to understand sinners enharded ben
enoynted with the swetnes of honey / which engendath venym / and thoughts
euylle byleuynge / your cone^yse to fore al things possedeth no thing / For
hit is bounden to the arts of the deuylle / And shall be witholden in the
bounds of the cursyd and evil wynnyng And your Joys when they begin to
shine / shall be broken like glass / And then the Judge fulfilled with wrath
/ yaf sentence / and commanded that Symphoryen should be slain / And as he was
led to the place of his martyrdom / his mother cried fro the wall of her hows
/ and said / Sone / Sone / Remember the of the life perdurable / look upward /
and behold him / that regneth in heaven / The life shall not be take aweye fro
the / but it shall be changed in to a better / And then he was anon
byheded / And his body taken of Christian men / And was honorably buried / And
so many miracles were showed at his Tomb / that hit was holden greet
honor of the paynyms / Gregorye of Tours reherceth of the place where his
blood was shed / A Christian man bare away three stones / which were befprenct
with his blood / and put them in a caas of silver / and tables of tree
enclosed about it / and bare them in to a castle / which castle was al burnt
with fire / And that caas was founden hoole and sauf in the myddel of the fire
/ And he suffryd death about the year of our lord CC / and lxx /

Thus ends the lif of saint Symphoryen.
Here begins the lif of saint Bertylmewe thappostle / And first thexposicion
of his name
BErtylmew is expowned the sone of above hangyng the waters / or sone of
ouerhangyng the sea / he is said of bar / that is as much to say as sone / and
tholos / which is as much to say as soueraynte / and of Moyes / that is to
say water / And here of is said Bartylmewe / as a sone hangyng over the waters
/ That is of god which enhaunceth the minds of doctors on hyhe / For to
shede and besprynge bynethe the waters of doctrine And it is a name of Syrye /
and not of hebrewe / And by the first three suspendynges that he had ought to be
noted / he was suspended / or taken up fro the love of the world / and he was
suspendyd / that is to say ententyf in heavenly love / And he was suspended /
that is to say wrappyd in the grace / and in the aid of god / not by his
merytes his life shone / but by thayde of god / Of the second came the depenesse
of his wisdom / of which depenes of wisdom Denis says in his mystycal
theology^ The dyuyne Bertylmewe / of whom is much dyuynyte / and right little
/ And that the gospel is broad and great / and also it is short / And after the
intent of saint Denis / Bertylmewe will show / that all things may be
affermed and shwed of god under one consyderacion / And by another
consideracion may be more propyrly denied

Of saint Bertylmew thappostle
Saint Bartlmew thappostle went in to ynde / which is in the end of the world
/ And therein he entryd in to a Temple / where an Idol was / which was named
Astaroth And he as a pilgrim abode there / In that ydoll dwelled a fend / that
said / yt he could hele al manner sekenesses / but he lied / for he could not
make them hoole And he cessed to make them seek / and the temple was full of
seek people and could have none answer of that ydoll / wherefore they went in to
another cite / where as an other ydol was worshipped / named berith and they
demanded him / wherefore astaroth gaf to them none answer / And Beryth said /
your god is bounden with chains of fire / yt he neither dar draw breath ne
speak after that bartylmewe thappostle of god entryd in to the temple / And
they said to him / who is that Bertylmew / And the deuylle said / he is the
friend of god almighty / And he is comen in to this prouynce for to avoid all
the gods of ynde / And then they said / tell us sum tokens and signs
that we may know him and find him / and the deuylle said to them / he has
his here is black / and cryspe / his skyn white eyes great / his nosethrellis
even and streyt his berde long / and hoor a little / and of a strayte and
semely stature / he is clad in a white cote / and a white ma^tell which in
every corner ben gemmes of purpur / and precious stones therein And it is sith
xxvj year that his clothes never wexed old ne foul / he prays and
worshipeth god on his knees an honderd times a day / and an honderd times by
night / The Angels gone with him which never suffer him to be weary / ne to be
an hongryd / he is alwey of like semblaunt glad and joyous / he sees all
things to fore / he knows all thing / he speaks all manner langages / and
understands them And he knows well what I say to you / And when ye seche
him / if he will he may show him self to you / And if him list not / not
shall ye find him / And I pray you when ye find him / that ye pray him /
that he come not hyder / that his Angels do not me as they have do to my
felawe Then they went / and sought him dylygently / and besyly two days /
and fond him not / On a day one that was bisette with a deuylle / cried and
said / Appostle of god Bertylmewe / thy prayers brenne me / And thappostle said
/ hold thou thy pees / and come the^s And anon he was delyuerd / And when
Polemyen king of that regyon herd this thing / which had a daughter lunatyk
/ he sent to thappostle prayeng that he would come to him / and hele his
daughter / And when thappostle was come to him / and saw that she was bounden
with chains / and bote all them that went to her / he commanded to unbind
her / And the mynystres durst not goo to her / And he said / I hold the
deuylle fast bounden that was in her / And therefore be not aferd / And then
anon she was vnbounden and delyuerd / And then would have presented to
thappostle Camellys charged with gold / and silver and precious stones / but he
could not be founden in no manner / And on the morrow following thappostle
appyered to the king allone in his chamber / and said to him / wherefore
soughtest thou me yesterdaye with gold and silver and precious stones / Tho
things ben necessary to them / ye coueyt^ things worldly / but I desire no
things terryenne charnel / Then saint Bertylmew began to say many things
/ and inform the king of our redemption / and among other things / how Ihesu
crist vaynquysshed the deuylle by merueylous and couenable puyssaunce / Justice
and wysedom / For it was couenable that he that overcome the sone made of the
earth / that was Adam / while he was yet a vyrgyn / should be ouercomen of the
sone of the vyrgyn / he ouercam him then myghtely when he threw him
puyssauntly out of his lordship Which had thrown out by force our forn
fader / And thus as he that over comes sum tyrant / sends his felawes to
fore for to set up his sign over all / and to cast out tyraunts / In like
wise Ihesu christ sent his messagers over al for to take awey the honor and
the worshypyng of the deuylle rightwysly / For it is right that he that
vaynquysshed man by etyng and held him that he should be ouercomen by a man
fasting / and hold man no longer / For it is rightful that he which by the
art of the deuylle was despised that by the art of Ihesu christ should be
vaynquysshed / And like as the faucon takes the bird / right so took he
Ihesu christ in deserte / by cause he fasted and would assaye if he had hongre /
And if he had hongre / that he might have deceived him by mete / And if he had
none hongre / then knew he well without doubt / that he Was god but he
might not know him / For he had hongre / and consentyd nothing to him / ne to
his temptacions / And when he had prechid the sacramenty^ of the feythe / he
said to the king / that if he would receive baptysme / he would show him his god
bounden with chains / And the day folewyng when the bisshops sacryfyed within
the palace of the king / the deuylls began to cry and say / Cesse ye cursyd
wretcches to do sacryfyse to us / lest ye suffer werse than I that am bounden
with chains of fire by the Angels of Ihesu Christ / whom the Jews crucyfyed
/ and supposed to have brought to death which death that is our queen he has
enprysoned / And has bounden our prince in chains of fire / And anon
the^nne they set cords on the image for to pulle down and overthrow thy
dolle / but they might not / Thappostle then commanded the deuylle / that he
should issue and goo out / and break thydoll all to pyeces / And he issued out
/ and destroyed and brake al thydolles of the temple / And anon thappostle
made his prayer saying / O God of Abraham / god of Isaac / and god of Jacob /
which have given to us such power / that we enlumyne the blind / and cleanse
the lepres / I desire and require that this multitude might be heled / And they
all answered / Amen / And forthwith all the seek people were cured and heled /
And then thappostle did do halowe and dedye that Temple / And commanded
the devil to goo in to the deserte / Then the angel of our lord appeared
there / and flewhe round about the temple / And ensigned and graued with his
finger the sign of the cross in four corners of the temple saying / Our
lord says this / like as I have you cured / and made you clean of all your
sickness / so late this temple be made clean of al fylthe and ^^dure / But I
shall show him to you that dwelled therein to fore / To whom thappostle has
commanded to goo in to deserte / And doubt ye not to see him / Make in your
forhedes such a sign as I have graven in these stones / And then he showed
to them an Ethyopyen more black than thonder / the face sharp / the berd long /
his herys hangyng unto his feet / his eyes flaming as hoote fire / and cast
out sparkles of fire / and castyng out of his mouth flammes of sulpher / and
his hondes bounden with chains of fire behind his back / And then the angel
said to him / by cause that thou have herd that thappostle has commanded /
and have broken all thydolles of the temple / I shall unbind the / go in to
such a place / where as dwells noman / And be thou there unto the day of
Judgment / And when he was vnbounden / he went his way with a great brayeng /
and howlyng / And the angel of our lord mounted up in to heaven in the sight of
them all / And then was the king baptized with his wife and his children / and
all his people / and left his Royamme / and was made discyple of thappostle /
Then all the bisshops of thydollys assembled them to gyder / and went to
Astryarges the king / and brother to Polemyen / and compleyned of the loss of
their gods and of the destruction of their Temples and of the conuersyon of
his brother / made by art Magik / Astryarges was wroth / and sent a thousand
men armed to take thappostle / And when he was brought to fore him / the king
said to him / Art not thou he / that have perverted my brother / And
thappostle answered to him / I have not peruertyd him / but I have conuertyd him
/ and the king said to him / like as thou haste made my brother forsake his god
/ and believe in thy god / So shall I make the forsake thy god / and shall
sacryfyse to my god / and thappostle said / I have bounden the god / that thy
(...) adoured / and shewde him bounden and (...) him to break his false image /
and if thou may so do to my god / thou may well draw me to thine ydolle /
And if not / I shall all to break thy gods / and then bileue thou in my
god / and as he said these words / It was told the king / that his god
baldach was overthrown / and al to broken / and when the king herd that / he
brake and all to rent his purpur / in which he was clad and commanded that
thappostle should be beten with staves / and that he should be flayn quyck /
and so it was done / Then the Christian took awey the body / and buried it
honorably / Then the king Astryarges / and the bisshops of the Temples were
rauysshed with fendes and deyde / and the king Polemyen was ordained bishop /
and acco^plysshed thoffyce of a bishop xx year / much lowably / And after
that rested in pees full of virtues /

There ben diverse opynyons of the manner of his passion / For the blessed
dorothee says that he was crucyfyed / and says also / Bertylmewe preached to
me^ of ynde / and delyuerd to them the gospel after Mathewe in their propre
tongue / he deyde in Albane a cite of great Armenye crucyfyed the heed dounward
Saint Theoderyck says that he was slain / and it is read in many books that
he was byheded only / And this contraryete may be assoylled in this manner /
that sum say that he was crucyfyed / and was take down or he deyde / And
for to have gretter torment he was slain / and at last byheded /

In the year of our lord CCC xxxj / Sarasyns assaylled Cecylle / and destroyed
the isle of laparyte / where as the body of saint Bertylmewe lies / and brake
up the sepulcre / and threw the bones hyder and thither / And it is said that
his body came in such wise from ynde thither in to that isle / when the paynyms
saw / that this body and his sepulcre were gretely honored for the miracles
that bifelle / they had thereof great despyte / And leyd them in a tomb of led
/ and threw them in to the sea And by the will of god they came in to this isle
/ And when the Sarasyns had departed and thrown the bones here and there / and
were departed thens Thappostle appeared to a Monk / and said to him / Arise up
and goo / and gadre to geder my bones that (...) departed / And he said to him
/ by what reason shall I gadre to gyder thy bones / And what honor ought we
do to them / when thou suffrest us to be destroyed / And thappostle said to
him / Our lord has spared this people here a long while by my merytes / but
for their sins that they have sinned / which cry vengeance unto heuene / I
have not conne get pardon ne foryeuenesse for them / And then the Monk said
how shall I among so many bones f^nde thyn / And thappostle said to him thou
shall gadre them by night / and them that thou shall find shynynge / thou
shall take up / and the monk went and fond them all as he had said / and
took them up / and brought them with him in to a ship / and sailed with them
to Beneuente / which is chyef cite of puylle / and thus were they transported
thither / And it is said now that they be at Rom^ / how b^ it they of Beneuente
say / that they have the body / There was a woman that brought a vessel full of
oylle for to put in the lamp of saint Bertylmew / and how well she enclyned the
vessel for to pour out the oylle / there would none issue out / how well she
touched with her fyngre the oylle clear / And then one cried and said / I
trow this oylle be not agreeable to the appostle that it should be in his lamp
/ wherefore they put it in another lamp / and it issued anon / when that the
Emperor Frederyck destroyed Beneuent / And he had commanded that all the
chirches that were there should be destroyed / and enforsed them to bear awey
the goods fro that Cite in to an other place / And there was a man which fond
men al white shynyng / And him seemed that they spak to geder of some secret
thing / and he merueyled strongly who they were / and demanded them / and
then one of them answered and said / this is Bertylmewe thappostle with
the other saints / which had chirches in this Cite that speak and ordeyne to
gyder / in what manner and by what pain this emperor should be Iustyfyed /
that has cast them out of their tabernacles / And they have now confermed
among them by ferme sentence / that he without taryeng shall go to the
Iugemement of god for to answer there upon / And anon the Emperor deyed an
evil death It is in a book read of the miracles of saints that a certain
master hallowed solempnly the fest of saint Bertymew And the devil in the form
of a maid appeared to this master that prechid And when he saw her / he had
her to come and dyne with him / and when they were set at the table she
enforced her much for to draw him to her love / And then saint Bertylmewe
came to the gate and prayed that he might come in for the love of saint
Bertylmewe / and she would not but sent him bread / and he would none take / but
prayed the master by his message / that he should say / what thing that he
supposed was most propre in a man / And he answered to laugh / And the maid
said nay / It is sin / in which a man is conceyueth / born / and lives in
sin / And saint Bertylmewe answered that he had well said / but she had more
profoundely answered / And the pilgrym demanded after at the maystre Where the
place was conteynyng the space of a foot where had god made grettest miracle /
And he said the sign of the Cross / in which god had made many miracles /
And she said nay it is the head of a man / in which the litell world is / And
thappostle allowed the sentence of that one / and of that other / And then he
demanded the third time / how far it was fro the sovereign syege or sete in
heaven / unto the lowest and deppest place of hell / And the maystre said that
he wist not And she said / I know it well / For I fylle down from that one to
that other And hit behooves / that I show it to the / And the deuylle fylle
down in to hell with a great bruyte and howlyng And then they sent for the
pilgrim and he was vanysshed and gone awey and they could not find him / And
in like wise nyghe according to this is read of saint Andrewe / The blessid
Ambrose says thus in the preface / that he made of this appostle in abredgyng
his legende / Ihesu Christ thou have vouchesauf to show to thy disciples
prechyng many things of thy dyuyne Trynyte in merueylous manner and thy mageste
/ among whom thou have sent the blessed Bertylmewe honor by right great
prerogatyf in to a far country / And how be hit / that he was all fer fro
humayne conversation / Nevertheless he deseruyd by thencreacyng of his
predicacions to mark / and think in thy sign the beginning of that people /
Ha / by what louynges is the merueylous appostle to be honored / And when the
hertes of the people of his neighbors suffysed not to him to receive his seed
/ he thorugh persed like in fleing in to the last Countrees of the lands of
ynde / and entryd in to the temple where there were great company of seek people
without nombre / And made the deuylle so muet / that he gat no remembrance
to them / that adoured him / And the maid that was Lunatyk by tormente of the
deuylle he did unbind / And delyuerd her all hole to her fader / O how great
was this miracle of holiness when he made the fend enemy to the lygnage humayne
/ and break and destroy his own ydolle / and to bring it to naught / O how
worthy is he to be nombred to the heavenly company / to whom the angel appeared
to preyse the feythe of him by his miracles / And came fro the sovereign halle
And showed to all the people the devil chayned / and right foul / and the
sign of the Cross empressid in the stone beryng health / And the king and the
queen were laptised with the people of their Cytees / And at the last the
tirau^t brother of Polemyen new in feith by the relacion of the bisshops of the
temple made the blessed Appostle constaunt in the faith to be beten / flayn /
and receive right foul death / And as he denounced the meschyef of death / he
had and bare with him in to the glory of heaven vyctorye of his glorious
strife / And the blessid Theodore Abbot and noble doctor says of this
Appostle in this manner among other things / The blessed appostle Betylmewe
prechid first in lychaone / and after in ynde / and at the last in Albane / a
Cite of great armenye / and there was first slain / and afterward his head
smyton of and there he was buried / and when he was sent of our lord to preche
/ as I suppose / he herd how our lord said to him / go my disciple to preche
/ void out of this Country / and goo fight / and be capax of perils / I have
first accomplysshed and fynysshed the works of my fader / and am first
witness / Fill thou the vessel that is necessary / and follow thy maystre /
love thy lord / give thy blood for his blood / and thy flesh for his flesh
/ and suffer that / which he had suffered / late thyn armoure be delonairte
in thy swetynges / and suffer swetely among wicked people / And be pacyent among
them that perysshe the And the Appostle recuylled not / but as a true servant
and obeysaunt to his master went forth Ioyeng / and as a light of god
enlumynyng in derkenes the work of holy church / like as the blessed saint
Auistyn wytnessyth in his book / that like a tylyer of Ihesu Christ he
prouffyted in spyrytuel tylyeng / Saint Peter thappostle taught the naao^s /
but saint Bertylmew did great miracles / Peter was crucyfyed the head dounward
/ And Bertylmewe was flayn quyck / and had his head smyton of / And they tweyne
encreced g^^tely the church / by the yeftes of the holy gho ost / And right as
an harp gives a right sweet sown of many st^^nges / in like wise all
thappostles gaf sweet melodye of the unity dyuyne / And were establysshyd by
the king of kings / And they departed among them all the world / And the
place of Armenye was the place of Bertylmewe / that is fro eiulath unto gabaoth
/ There thou may see him with the plough of his tongue erye the feldes
unreasonable / sowyng in the depnesse of the heart the word of the faith / and
in plantyng the vygnes of our lord and trees of paradys / And to eueryche
setting medycynally the remedies of the passions / And threw thorns not
intellygyble / and cut down trees of felonnye / and closed them about with
hedges of doctrine / But what reward yielded the tyrauntes to their curate /
They gaf to him dishonor for honor / cursyng for benediction / pains for
yeftes / trybulacion for rest / And right bitter death for restfull life / And
sith that he had suffered many torments he was of them discoryate and flayn
quyck and deyde not / And yet for all that he had them not in despyte that
slew him / but admonested them by miracles / and taught them by demonstraunces
/ that did him harm / But there was no thing that might refrain their
bestyal thoughts / ne withdraw them from harm / what did they afterward /
they enforced them ageynste the holy body And the malades and seek men refused
their medycyne and heler / the cite refused him that enlumyned their blyndenes
/ governed them yt were in peril / and gaf life to them that were deed / And
how cast they him out / certeynly they threw the body in to the sea in a
cheste of leed / And that cheste came fro the regyon of armenye with the chestes
of four other martirs / For they did also miracles / and were thrown with
him in to the sea / And the four went before a great space of the sea / and
did service to thappostle like as servants in a manner so far / that they
came in to the parties of Cecylle in an isle that is named Lyparys / like as it
was showed to a bishop of hostyence / which then was present / And these
right rich tresour came to aright pour woman / And these right precious
Margarytes came to one not noble / The right shynyng light came to one right
heavy / And then the other four came in to other lands / and left the holy
appostle in that isle / and he lest the other behind him / And that one /
which was named Papyen went in to a Cite of Cecylle / And he sent another
named Lucyen in to the Cite of Messenne / And the other tweyne were sent in to
the land of Calabre sent gregory in to the Cite of Colompne / And Achare in
to a cite named Chale / where yet at this day they shine by their merytes / And
then was the body of the appostle received with ympnes / louynges / and
candellys honorably / And there was made and bylded a fair church in thonoure
of him / And the Mou^tayn of Vulcan is nyhe to that isle / and was to hit much
grievous / by cause it received fire / the which Mountain was withdraw by the
merytes of this holy saint fro that isle un mile without to be seen of any
body / and was suspended toward the sea And yet apperith it at this day to them
that see hit / as hit were a figure of fire fleing aweye / Now then therefore
I salewe the Bertylmewe / blessid of blessid saints / which art the shynyng
light of holy church / Fssyhar of / fisshes reasonable / hurte^ of the deuylle
which hurted the world by his theft Enjoy the sone of the world enlumynyng
all erthely things / mouth of god / Fyry tongue pronouncyng wysdom /
Fontayne spryngyng goodly full of health / which halowest the sea by thy goynges

repayrest in heuenes shynyng in the myddle of the dyuyne company clear in the
resplendisshour of glory / And enjoy the in the gladness of Joy insacyable /
Amen / And this is / that theodore says of him /

Thus ends the life of saint Bertylmewe
Here follows the life of sa^ynt Austyn doctor And first thexposicion of his
name^
AUstyn this name was sorted to him for thexcellence of his dignyte / Or for
the ferue^te love that he had / or for thexposicion of his name / For
thexcellence of his dignyte / For like as the emperor Augustus precellyd all
other kings / Right so he excelled al other doctors / after that Remygie
says / The other doctors be compared to sterres / And this to the son / As
hit apperyth in the epistle / that is songen of him / he shyneth in the Temple
of god / like to the son shynyng / Secondly for the fervent love / For like
as the month of August is hot by hete / so is he enchauffed of the fire of
the dyuyne love / wherefore he says him self in the book of Confessions / Thou
have thorugh perced my heart with thy charity / Also in the same thou have
brought me in to a desirous affection within forth / which can not be asw^ged
/ And I wot not to what swet^nes it is made in me / I wot not what it shall
be / I wot well / hit shall not be in this life / Thyrdly for thexposicion of
the name / Augus is as much to say as growyng / and styn is a Cite / And ana
is as much to say as sovereign / And then Augustyn is as much to say / as
encrecyng the cite sovereign / And it is songen of him / this is he that may
well encrece the Cite of god / Or it is said in the glosarye / Austyn is said
great / blessed and clear / he was great in his life / cl^re in his doctrine /
and blessed in glory / Possidonius bishop of Calamente compyled his life / as
Cassiodore says in the book of noble men

Of saint Austyn doctor and Bishop
Saint Austyn the noble doctoure was borne in Auffryke in the Cite of Cratage /
And was comen of noble kynrede / And his fader was named Patryce and his mother
Monica / he was sufficiently instruct in the arts lyberalle / so that he was
reputed for a suffysaunt philosopher / and a right noble doctor / For he
learned al by him self without master in redyng the books of Arystotle / and
all other that he might find of arts lyberalle / And he understood them / as
he him self wytnessith in the book of Confessions saying / All the books
that been called of the arts lyberall / then I most wretchyd servant of al
couetyses / read them by my self allone / and understood all them that I
might read / and all them of the craft of spekyng and of deuysyng / All them
of dyuysyons of figures / of Musyke / and of nombres I read and understood
them with out great difficulte / and without techynq of any man / this
know thou my lord god / For the hastynes of mine understanding / and the
yefte of lerynge is of the only / and comes of thy name / but I have not
sacryfyed to the therefore / And therefore science without charity edefyeth not /
but swellyth in therrour of manych^ens / which afferme that Ihesu christ was
fantastyke / and renye the resurection of the flessh / And in the same error
Austyn fylle / and abode therein nine years / whiles he was an adolescent / and
was brought to believe the truffes and Iapes that say that the fygge tree
wepeth / when his fygges ben taken awey or leaves / And when he was xix year of
age / he began to read in the book of philosophy in which he was taught to
despise the ^anytees of the world / And by cause that book plesyd him well / but
he began to be sorry that the name of Ihesu Crist which he had learned of his
mother was not therein / And his mother wept often / and enforced her much to
bring him to the veryte of the feythe / And as it is read in the book of
Confessions / she was in a place much heavy / and her thought that a fair young
man was to fore her / that inquired of her the cause of her heaviness / And she
said I weep here the loss of my sone Austyn / and he answered be thou sure For
where thou art / he is / and she saw her sone beside her / and when she had
told this to Austyn / he said to his mother / thou art deceived mother / hit was
not said so / but where that I am thou art / and she said contrary / sone it
was not said so to me but where I am / thou art / And then the mother
ententyfly prayed and required a bishop instantly that he would pray for her
sone augu^tyn / And he being ouercomen said to her by the voys of a prophet /
goo thy way surely / For a sone of so many t^rys may not by possibilyte
perysshe / And when he had certain years taught Rethoryke in cartage / he
came to Rome secretly without the knowledge of his mother / And assembled there
many disciples / And his mother had followed him unto the yate to make him
abide / or else that she should go with him / And he abode that night / but he
departed secretly on the morn / And when she apperceyued hit / she
replenysshed the eeres of our lord with clamor / And went in the morning and
at even to the church / and prayed god for her sone / In that time they of
Melane required a doctor of Rethoryke of Symache the prefecte of Rome that he
might read Rethoryke at Melan / And that time Ambrose servant of god was
bishop of that Cite / and augustyn was sent at the prayer of them of Melane /
and his mother might not rest / but did much pain to come him / And fond
him that he ne was very manachyen ne very catholyque / And then it happed
that augustyn began to haunte with saint Ambrose / and often herd his
predicacions / And was much ententif to here if any thing were said against
the Manychyens or other heresies /

On a time it happed that saint Ambrose disputed ageynste the error manychyen
long and condemned it by open and euydent resons / and by auctorytees so that
this error was al put out of the heart of augustyn / And what byfelle to him
afterward / he reherceth in the book of his confessions / and seith when I
knew the first / thou betest awey thynfyrmyte of my syte / shynyng in me
forcybly / And I tremblyd for dread of good love / and I fond my self right fer
fro the in a Regyon of vnlykelyhode / like as I herd thy voys fro heaven on hyhe
saying / I am mete of gretenes encreced / and thou shall ete me / thou shall
not change me in the as mete of thy flessh / but thou shall be changed in me
/ And as he reherceth there / the life of Ihesu christ plesyd him much well /
but he doubted yet to goo in such distresses / but our lord anon put in
his mind / that he should goo to Symplycyen / in whom all dyuyne grace shone /
for to refrain his desires / and for to say to him what manner was couenable
to live / for to goo in the weye of god / in which that other went / For all
that was done displesyd sauf the swetenes of god / and the beauty of the hows
of god which he loved / And Symplycyen began to exhort him / And saint
Augustyn exhorted him self and said / how many children and maidens serve in
the church of god to our lord / And may not thou do that they do in them
self and not in their god / wherefore taryest thou / cast thy self in him / and
he shall receive the / and reward the / And among these words / Vyctoryn came
to his mind / Then Symplycyen was much glad / and told to him / how
Vyctoryn was yet a paynym / and deserved to have a great image to his lykenes
in the markette of Rome / And how he oftymes said that he was a christian man /
To whom Symplycyen said I shall not bileue it / but if I see the in the
church / And he answered meryly The walls make not a man Christian / At the
last when he came in to the church / he brought to him secretly a book
wherein the Credo of the mass was / and bad him read / And he ascended upon
high and with voys on high pronounced it / whereof Rome merueyled / and the
church was ioyefull / And all cried suddenly / Vyctoryn / Victoryn / And anon
they held her pees for joy And after that there came fro Auffryke a friend of
Augustyn which was named Poncyen / And recounted to him the life and miracles
of the great Antonye that had been deed before under Co^stantyn the emperor / And
by the Ensamples Austyn enforced him strongly / so that he assailled his
felawe Alippe as well with chere / as mind / and cried strongly / what suffer
we / what here we / untaught people and folyssh rauysshe and take heaven / And we
with our connyng and doctrynes plonge and synke in to hell / And by cause
they go to fore / we ben ashamed to follow them And then he ran in to a
gardyn / And as he says him self / he cast him self down under a fygge tree /
and wept right bytterly / and gaf out weeping vois by cause he had tarried
so long fro day to day / and fro time to time / And was gretely tormentid /
so that he had no manner in him self for sorrow of his long taryeng / like as he
writes in the book of his Confessions / and said / Alas lord how thou art
high in high things / and deep in depenes / And departest not / ne ghost
out of the wey / And uneath we come to the / A lord he said call me / moeue
me / change me / and enlumyne me / rauysshe me and make sweet and soft al mine
enpesshementes and lettynges / as hit apperteyneth / for I dread them sore / I
have loved the over late / thou beaulte so old and so new / I over late
have loved the / thou were within / and I was without / and there I sought the
And in the beaulte / and fayrenes that thou haste / I fylle all defourmed and
foul / thou were with me / but I was not with the / Thou have called and cried
and have broken my deefnes / Thou have enlumyned clered / and haste put away
my blyndenes / Thou haste replenisshed me with fragraunt odours and I haste me
to come to the / I have tasted the / and am hongry / and desire the / Thou have
touched me / and I am brent in the voys of leuyng thy pees / and as he wept
thus bitterly / he herd a voys saying / Take and read / and anon he opened
the book of thappostle and cast his eyes on the first chapter / and read /
clothe ye you in our lord Ihesu crist / and anon all the doubts of derkenes
Were extynct in him / and in the mean time he began to be so gretely tormented
With tooth ache / that almoost he says he was brought to believe thoppynyon of
Cornelys the Philosopher / which puts that the sovereign well of the soul
is in wysdom and the sovereign well of the body is in suffryng no pain ne
sorrow / And his pain was so great and vehement that he had lost his speech /
wherefore as he writes in the book of his Confessions / he wrote in tables of
wax / that al men should pray for him / that our lord should aswage his pain
/ And he him self kneled down with the other / And so denly he felt him self
hoole / And then he sygnyfyed by lettres to the holy man saint Ambrose /
that he would send to him word / which of the books of holy writ
apperteyned best to read in for to be made most couenable to the Christian
feythe / And he sent to him answer / ysaye the prophet / by cause that he
was seen to be the shewer and pronouncer of the gospel / and of calling of men
/ And when Augustyn understood not all the beginning / and supposed all the
remenaunt to be other wise than it was to read / he differred to read them /
tylle he were more connyng in holy writ / And when the day of Eester came /
And Austyn was xxx year old / he and his sone which was named a de o datus / a
child of noble wit and understanding / whom he had gotten in his youth /
when he was a paynym and a philosopher with Alyppe his friend by the merytes of
his mother / and by prechyng of saint Ambrose received baptysme of saint Ambrose
/ And then as it is read saint Ambrose said The deum laudamus / And saint
Austyn said / Te dominum confitemur And so they two to geder ordained and made
this ympne / and song hit unto the end / And so wytnessyth it Honorius in
his book / which is named the myrrour of the Church / And in some other old
books the title of this ympne or psalm is intytled / the Cantykle of Ambrose
and of Augustyn / And anon he was merueylously confermed in the faith
Catholyke / And forsook all the hope that he had in the world / And renounced
the scoles that he rewled / And he shows in his book of confessions / how he
was fro thens forth achauffed in the love of god saying / lord thou have
thorugh per^ed mine heart with thy charity / And I have borne thy words fixed in
mine entraylles / And thensamples of thy manners / which thou have made of
black white and shynyng / and of deed living / And of corrupt thoughts thou
make fair and high understanding in heavenly things / I mounted up in to
the hylle of weeping / and thou gave to me syngyng the cantycle of grees /
shape arowes / and cooles wastyng / ne I was not in tho days fulfilled in thy
merueylous swetenes / for to considere the heyght of the dyuyne counceylle up
on the health of the lygnage humayne How much have I wept in thy yn^pnes and
cantycles swetely sownynnge / And by the vois of thy church I have been moeued
egrely / The voyses have ronnen in mine eres / And thy truth has dropped in
mine heart / and then teres have ronnen down / and I was well eased with them
/ Then these things were establysshed to be songen in the church of Melan /
And I cried With an high cry of mine heart / O in pace / O in idipsum / O thou
that say I shall sleep in that same / and take rest thou art the same / For
thou art not changed / and in the is rest forgetyng all labors / I read all that psalm And I brenned / which sometime had been a barker bitter and blind
against the lettres honyed with the swetenes of heaven / and enlumyned with thy
light And upon such scriptures I held my pees / and spack not / O Ihesu
crist my helper / how sweet is it suddenly made to me to lack the swetnesses of
i^^ffes and Iapes / which Were fer fro me to leave and forsake / and now to leave
and forsake them is to me great joy / Thou have cast them out fro me / And
thou Which art sovereign swetenes have entryd in to me for them which a^te
swetter than any swetnes or delyces / more clear than any sight / and more
secret than / any secret counceylles / and more high than al honor / And
there is none more high than thou / And after this he took Nebrydyon and
Euodyon and his mother / and returned again in to Auffryke / But whann^ But
when they came to hostyberyn / his sweet mother deyde / And after her de^h /
Austyn returned unto his propre heritage / and there intended with them yt lode
with him in fastinges and in prayers He wrote books / and taught them that were
not wise / And the fame and renomme of him spradde over all / And in all his
books and works / he was holden merueylous / he reffused to come to any Cite
where as was no bishop / lest he should be let by that office / And in that
time was in yponence a man full of great virtues / which sent to Augustyn /
that if he would come to him / that he might here the good of his mouth / he
would renounce the world / And when saint Augustyn knew it / he went hastily
thither / And when Valeryen Bishop of yponence herd his renommee and fame /
he ordained him a priest in his church / how be it / that he refused it much
and wept / And sum reputed his teres to be made by pride / And said to him
in comfortyng him / that it was time that he were a priest / thou he were
worthy to a gretter office / Nevertheless he approchyd to the Bisshopryche / And
anon he establysshed a Monasterye of clerks / and began to live under the
rewle of thappostles Out of which monastery were ten chosen to be Bisshops /
And by cause the seid Bishop was a greek / and but litel lettred in latin
tongue and taught / he gaf power to Augustyn for to preche against the manner of
the church Oryental / And therefore many Bisshops despised him / but he raught
not / if he did it to be done by the said Augustyn that which he could not
do him self / In that time he conuaynquysshed fortunate the priest a
manychyen / which was an heretyke / and many other heretykes / which namely
were rebaptysed donastykes / and Manychyens / all these he confounded and
ouercam / Then the blessed Valeryen doubted / lest Augustyn should be taken
awey from him for to be made and required to be a bishop in another cite / And
he would have gladly offryd to him his bisshopryche / but he supposed that he
would have fled in to some secret place there as he should not have be founden
/ And then he impetred of tharchebisshop of cartage / that he might cesse /
and leave his bisshopryche / and that he would promote Augustyn to be bishop of
the church of yponence / but when Augustyn herd that / he reffused it utterly
/ in all manners / Nevertheless he was constrained and so coacte that he took
at the last the cure of the bisshopryche / which thing he said / that he
ought not to be ordained the bishop living / and said and wrote for thymbycion
of the general counceylle / the which he learned a fter / that it was ordained
in the counceil of the bisshops / that all the statutes of the faders ought to
be said to ordeyne of them / that ordained them / And it is read that he said
after of him self / I ne feel our lord so angry with me / in no thing as
that I am not worthy to be set in the dignyte of the governance of the church
/ his clothyng and hosyng and shoyng and all his other aournementes and array
were not over fowl ne over fair / but they were of suffysaunt / moderate and
competent habyte And said of him self I am ashamed of precious clothyng / and
therefore wha^ any is yeuen to me / I selle hit / For clothyng may not be common /
the prys is common / he used alweye his table sparynge / he used alwey pottage
and wortes for seek folk / and oftymes he had flesh for ghestes and seek
people / and he loved better at his table lesso^s and disputacio^s tha^ mete /
and had these versus wreton at his table / Quisquis amat dictis absentum rodere
vitam / Hanc me^sam veti tam nouerit esse sibi / That is to say / who so ever
love to missay any creature that is absent / it may be said / yt this table is
denied to him at al / for on a time as a man had losid his to^g to say of a
bishop familyer with him he rebuked him cruelly and said / that he should leave
/ or race awey these verses / or go fro the table / On a time when he had boden
to dinner some of his friends / one of them entrid in to the kechyn / and found
yet all the mete cold that they should have at dinner / and ano^ he returned to
austin and said What have ye for our dinner / and austyn answered to him / I note
ne can no skill of such metes / and than he said I shall not then dyne with
you / And then Augustyn said / that three things he had learned of saint
Ambrose / The first is / that he should never demand wife for another man /
the second that he should never not leave his horse to him that would ride / And
the third / that he should go to no feste / The cause of the first lest they
accord not / and be not of one will / and curse him / that brought hem to
gyder / The cause of the second / lest the ryder take harm in his rydyng / and
blame him / that lent him the horse / The cause of the thyrdde / lest at the
feste he lose the manner of te^peraunce / he was of so great purete and
humylyte / that the right little sins which we repute for none / he
confessyd them to god / as it appears in the book of his Confessions / and
accused him self mekely to our lord / For he accused him self there / that when
he was a child how he played at the balle / when he should goo to Scol^ / Also
of that he would not learn of his fader and mother and of his maystres / but by
constraynt / Also when he was a child of that he read gladly the fables of
Eneas / and complained Dydo / which deyde for love / Also of that he had
stolen mete fro the table / and out of the celyer of his fader and mother /
that he had given to children / that played with him / And of that that at the
plays and games he had vyctorye by fraud Also he confessyd him of stelyng of
peerys of a peretre standing nyghe his vyneyerde when he was sixten year old /
In the same book he accused him of that little delectacion / which sometime he
felt in etyng and said / thou have taught me / that I should take nourysshyng
of mete like a medycyne / but when I goo to rest with full belly / then I go in
the way / in which the snare of concupyscence assayleth me / And how we* that
the cause of etyng and drynkyng be cause of health / she adioyneth with her a
peryllous chamberere / that is Ioyouste / which enforces her often to perysshe
/ so that by the cause hit is often cause of that I would do for health /
Dronkenesse is fer fro me / I byseche the lord / have mercy on me / that it
approach not me / And lord who is he / but sometime he is rauysshed out of his
metes / who that it be / that is not / certainly is much parfyght / It am not
I for I am a synful man Also he held him self suspecte of smellyng / saying /
of vnleefull smellyng I entermete me not ouermoche / when they be present / I
require them not / And if I have them / I refuse them not / ne I coueyte them
not / as me seems / when I lack them / I shall not be deceived / No man says
he / ought to be sure in this life / For it is called all temptacion / that is
to wete / that he may be made of the worse the better / and not of the better
the werse And he confessyd him also of heryng / saying / the delytes and
voluptuosytees of mine eres have bowed and subdued me / but thou have unbound
and delyuerd me / For when it happed me that the song more moeued me that the
thing songen I confess me sore to have sinned / And then I would that I had
not herd him that so sange / And then he accused him of seeing of that he saw
sometime gladly the hound rennyng / And when he went sometime by adventure by the
feldes he beheld gladly huntyng / And when he was at home he beheld oftymes
the spyncoppes or spyders / taking flies by the nets of their Copwebbes /
hereof he confessyd him to our lord / For sometime they took fro him good
thoughts / and let him of sum good works / And he accused him of
thappetyte of praysyng / and of the morning of vayn glory / saying that he
would be preysed of men / And thou blamest him / He shall not be deffended of
men when thou Iugest him / Ne be wythdrawen / when thou shall dampne him /
For man is praised for sum gift / that thou hast^ given to him / Nevertheless
he enjoys more of that he is praised / then he does of the yefte that thou
have given / We be tempted every day with these temptacions without ceassynge
/ or cotidyan fornays is our tongue humayne / Nevertheless I would well that the
name of every good deed should encrece by the help of a strange mouth But the
tongue encreceth hit not / but blame mynuysseth hit / I am sorry sometime of my
praysynges / when they be praised in me / in which they displease me / For so
sum manners ben esteemed better than they be / This holy man confounded right
valyauntly the Heretykes / in so much that they preached openly that it were
no sin to slay augustyn / and said that he ought to be slain like a wolf /
and they affermed that god pardonned all the sins to them that slew him /
And was oftymes awaited of them / And when he went in to any places / they
set espyes / but by the grace of god they were deceived of their vyage / and
might not find him / He remembryd alwey the pour people / and socour^d them
freely of that he might have / And sometime he commanded to break the vessels of
the church for to give to the pour people / and dispende it among the nedy /
He would never bye hows / ne field / ne Town / And refused many herytages that
were fallen to him / wherefore he said / that they apperteyned to the children
of the deed people / and to them that were next of their kynne / And it suffysed
him enough that which fill to him by the church / And yet he was not ententyf
for the love of such goods / but day and night he thought in dyuyne
scriptures / he had never study in new fabrykes ne buyldynges / but eschewed
to set thereon his courage / which ever he would have free fro all bodyly
greues / so that he might more freely entende and more contynuelly to the lesson
/ Nevertheless he would not forbede them that would edyffye / if that he saw them
not do it dysatemperatly / he preysed them strongly that had desire to deye /
and remembryd much often there upon / the ensamples of three bisshops / For
when Ambrose was at his end / he was prayed / that he should get longer
space / of his life by his prayers / he answered I have not lived so that I am
ashamed to live among you / And I am not aferd to dye / For I have a good lord
/ which answer Augustyn preysed merueylously / And also he said of another
Bishop / that it was said to him that he was yet much necessary to the
Church / and that he should pray to god for the delyueraunce of his sickness
/ And he said if I did never well but selde / wherefore should he deliver me now /
And of another Bishop / that he said that Cypryan told / when he was in
grievous sekenes / and prayed that god would send him health / A yonglyng appeared
to him / and looked sternly on him / and said to him by desdayne / thou doubtest
to s^^fre to issue / what shall I do to the / He would never have that any
woman should dwell with him / ne his own susters / ne the daughters of his
brother / which served god to gyder / For he said though of his suster / ne of
his nyeces might none euylle suspecion grow / Nevertheless by cause that such
persons might not be with out other that served them / And also other might
come to them / of such might the thoughts be meued to temptacions or might be
diffamed by evil suspecion of men / he would never speak allone with any wymmen
/ but if hit were in secret / he gaf never no goods to his kynne ne to his
Cosyns / ne he retched whether they habou^ded or were nedy / he would never or
selde pray for any neither by lettres ne by words / remembryng a certain
philosopher / to whom his friends had not given much to in the time of his
hongre / Often the puyssaunt that is required / yeueth Verayly when he spack for
his friend he attempred so the manner of his dytee / that he was not over
hastyng him self / but the curtosye of the sayer deserved to be herd / He would
gladlyer here causes of unknown men / than of his friends / For between them
he might freely know the defaute / and of them to make one his friend / for
whom by right he might give sentence / And of his friends he was sure to lose
one / that was him / ayenste whom he gaf the sentence / he was desired to
preche the word of god in many chirches And there he preached and converted many
fro errors / when he preached he had a custom sometime to depart him fro his
purpoos / and then he said that god had ordained that for the prouffyte of
some ne person / As hit appeared to a manychyen / which in a sermon of Augustyn
where as he departed fro his matter / and preached ageynste the same error / And
thereby he was converted to the feythe /

In that time that the Goths had taken Rome / and that thydolatres and falls
christian men enjoyed them thereof / Then made saint Augustyn therefore the book
of the Cite of god / in which he showed first / that rightwys men were
destroyed in this life / And the euylle men flowryd / And the traytye of the
two Cytees is Jerusalem / and Babylone / and of the kings of them For the
king of Iherusalem is Ihesu Christ / And he of Babylone is the deuylle / the
which two Cytees make two loves in hem / For the cite of the deuylle makes a
love to him self growyng the same unto despyte of God / And the cite of god
made a love growyng unto the despyte of him / In that time the wandales about
the year of our lord four honderd / and forty took all the prouynce of
Auffryke / and wasted all / And spared neither man ne woman / ne for order / ne
for age / And after came to the Cite of yponense / and assyeged hit with great
power / And under that trybulacion Augustyn to fore al other ladde a bitter and
right holy life / For the teres of his eyes were to him bread day and night
when he saw sum slain other chaced awey / the chirches with out priests
/ and the Cytee wasted with the Inhabytau^ts / And among thus many euylles by
the sentence of a certain wyseman he comforted him self saying / thou shall
not be greet in wenyng great things / by cause / that the woods and stones
fall And they that been mortal dye / he called then his brethren and said I
have praid our lord that either he take aweye fro us these perils / or send
to us pacyence / or take me out of this life that I be no more constreyned to
have so many cursidnesses or ylle happes / And the thy^dde thing that he
required he had For in the thyrdde month of the syege he trauaylled in the
Fevers / and lay down on his bed / And when he understood his departing / he
did do write the seven psalms of penance in a place ageynste the wall / And
read them lyeng in his bed / and wept habondauntly / And by cause he should
entende to god the more dylygently / And that his entente should not be let
by no body / x days tofore his death he suffered no body to enter in to him /
but if hit were his phisycyen / or else when his refection was brought him /

A certain seek man came by cause he should leye his hand on him / and thereby
to hele him of his Infyrmyte / And saint Augustyn answered to him sone that
which thou requyrest of me / wenest thou that I may do such thing that I ne
never did / If I might do hit / I would then hele my self / And the man
required of him alwey affermyng that he was so commanded in a vysyon to come
to him / And then he prayed for him / and he received health / he heled many
seek people / and did many other miracles / he recompted in the book of the
Cite of god another miracle of tweyne foles / of which that one said / I have
seen a vyrgyn of yponense / which enoynteth her with oil / And anoye the
devil rauysshed and vexed her / And a priest prayed for her weeping / And she was
anon made all hoole / And the fend issued fro her / And of that other miracle
he says in the same book / I know well / that a bishop on a time prayed for a
child that he had never seen / and he he was anon delyuerd of the deuylle
And it is no doubt but that he said it of him self / but he would not name him
self by cause of humylyte / he says in the same book / that a man should have
be cut of the stone / and men doubted that he should deye / And then the seek
man prayde god weeping / And Austyn praid for him / And he was heled without
cuttyng or incysyon / Then when his departing approuched / he enseygned his
brethren / that ^hey should reteyne in mind / that no man of what excellence
that he were / ought^ not to day without Confession / ne without to receive
his savior / And when he came to the last hour / he felt him hoole in all
his membrys / of good entendement / clear seeing and heryng / And in the year
of his age three score and six / and of his bisshopryche forty / he put him
self in prayers with his brethren / which prayenge he departed out of this
life / and went unto our lord / And he made no testament / For he was pour in
Ihesu Christ / And had not whereof / And he flouryd about the year of our lord
four honderd / And thus saint Augustyn right clear by light of wisdom
fyghtyng in deffence of truth / of feythe / and of garnyson of the church
surmounted all the other doctors of the church / as well by engyne / as by
conning / flourynge with out comparyson / as well by example of virtues / as
by habondaunce of doctrine / of whom the blessed Remygye in recordyng of
Iheromme and other doctors says thus / Saint Augustyn concluded all the
other by engyn and by science / For how be hit / that the blessid Iheromme
says / that he had seensixe M volumes of Orygenes / This same wrote so many
/ that no man by day ne night / might not write his books ne yet read them
Volusian to whom saint Augustyn wrote says of him thus / It lacks in the
law of god / All that which Augustyn knew not / Saint Iheromme says thus
in a pystle / that he wrote to the glorious saint Augustyn / I have no connyng
to answer to thy two greet books shynynge by all clerenes of fair speaking /
And certeynly this that I have said and have learned by engyne and connyng / and
drawn out of the fontayne of scripture as taken aweye / and a deserte to the
/ but I pray thy reverence / that thou suffer me a lytelle to preyse thyn
engyne / The blessed Ysydore wrote thus of him in the book of twelve doctors /
The glorious saint Augustyn Bishop / fleing by the high Montayns as an Egle
has pronounced by clear words many of the spaces of heaven / the bounds of
the lands / and the Cercle of the waters / And after hit apperyth in what
reverence and love saint Iheromme had to him in the epystles / that he sent
to the holy father saint Augustyn / I Iheromme honor alweye thy blessydnesse
by such honor as hit apperteyneth to love our lord Ihesu Christ dwelling
in the / But and if it may be now / late us now gadre of thy praysynges sum
thing / The blessid saint Gregory says thus of his books in a pystle / that
he sent unto Innocent provost of Auffryque by cause hit has lyked to the to
send to us for the exposycion of holy Job We r^ioyse us in thy study / But
if thou will be made fat in science / read the sweet pystles of thy patron
and heed saint Augustyn our felawe / But think not that our whete may be
compared to his rye And the blessed prospere said of him / Saint Augustyn was
quycke in engyne / Sweet in speech / Wise in lettu^re / and a noble Werker in
the labors of the Church / Clear in daily disputacions / in all his doings
well ordered / sharp in assoyllyng questyons / right a ppert in confundyng
heretykes / And right catholyke in expownyng of our feyth and subtyle in
expownyng the scriptures of canon / And after that the strange people had
occupied that country long / And had corrumped the holy places / the good
Christian men took the body of saint Augustyn / And brought it in to sardyne /
And after that two honderd and four score year one Lyprand a devout king of
the lombardes sent solemn messagyers thither for to bring the relyques of
saint Augustyn to pauye / which gafe great good for hit / And brought the body
unto Iene / And when the devout king herd thereof / he had great joy / And
went for to mete with hit at the said Cite / and received it honorably And on
the morn when they would have ladde the body aweye / they might not remeue it
in no manner till that the king had auowed / that if he would late him be borne
thens / he would make there a church in thonour of him and when he had done so
anon without any diffyculte / hit was ladde and taken fro thens / And on that
day following there fylle a miracle in a Town named Cryselle in the
Bisshopryche of Trydone in the same wise / And there he builded another church
in thonour of him / And the same town with all thappertonentes he gaf to them
that served in the said church to possede for evermore / And by cause the king
would please the saint / and doubted that he would be in some other place than
the king would have / where ever the king herberughd by night with the body /
he made there a church in thonour of him / And thus was brought to pauye with
great joy / And was leid honorably in the church of saint peter / which is
called Cioldoree / or heaven of gold in English Saint Bernard on a nyt as he
was at matyns / he slombryd a little / and the lessons of saint Augustyn were
read / And then he saw a right fair young man stondyng before him / And so
great habundaunce of water coming out of his mouth / that him seemed all the
church was full thereof And then he awoke and wist well that it was saint
Augustyn / which had fulfilled that church with his doctrine / There was a
man which had great devotion to saint augustyn / gafe great good to a Monk
that kept the body of saint Augustyn for to have a finger of the glorious
saint / And this Monk took this money / and delyuerd to him the fyngre of
another deed man wrapped in sylke / and feigned that it was the fyngre of the
glorious saint Austyn / And the good man received it much honorably / and in
great reverence / and honored hit every day deuoutely / and touched with all
his eyes / and his mouth / and often enbraced it against his breast / And god by
his mercy that byholdeth all thing and the faith of this man gaf to him for
that fyngre / the very propre fyngre of saint Augustyn / And when he came in to
his countreye there were many miracles showed there by / The renomme and fame
thereof came to pauye of this fyngre / And the Monk before said affermed alwey /
that it was the fyngre of another deed man The sepulcre was opened for to know
the truth / and hit was found / that there lacked one of the fyngres of the
glorious saint / And when thabbotte had knowledge of this thing / he putt out
the Monk of that office / And tormented and punysshed him sore / Many other
miracles has god showed by his life / and also after his death / which were
over long to write in this book / For they would I suppose conteyne a book as
much as all this and more / but among other correction I will set here in
one miracle / which I have seen painted on an altar of saint Austyn at the
black Freres at Andwerpe / how be it / I find hit not in the legende mine
exampler / neither in English / Frensshe / ne in latin / It was so that this
glorious Doctor made and compyled many volumes as a fore is said / among whom
he made a book of the Trynyte / In which he studied / and mused sore in his
mind / so ferforthe / that on a time as he went by the sea side in Auffryke
studyeng on the Trynyte / he fond by the sea side a little child / which
had made a little pytte in the sonde / and in his hand a little spone / And
with the spone he took out water of the large See / and poured hit in to the
pytte / And when saint Augustyn beheld him / he merueyled / and demanded
him / what he did / And he answered and said / I will lade out / and bring
all this water of this See in to this pytte / what said he / hit is Impossyble
/ How may hit be done / sithe the Sea is so greet and large / and thy pytte
and spone so lytylle / yes forsothe said he / I shall lyghtlyer / and sonner
draw all the water of the Sea / And bring hit in to this pytte / than thou
shall bring the mysterye of the Trynyte and his dyuynyte in to thy little
understanding / as to the regard thereof For the mysterye of the Trynyte is
greter and larger to the comparyson of thy wit and brain / than is this
great see unto this little pytte / And therwyth the child vanysshed awey /
Then here may every man take ensample / that no man / and specially simple
lettred men / ne unlearned presume to entermete ne to muse on high things of
the godhede ferther than we be enfourmed by our faith / For our only feyth
shall suffyse us / Then here with I make an end of the life of this glorious
Doctor saint Austyn / to whom late us deuoutely pray / that he be a medyatour
and advocate unto the blessed Trynyte / that we may amend our synful life in
this transytorye world / that when we shall depart / we may come to
everlasting bliss in heaven / Amen /

Thus ends the lif of saint Augustyn doctor
Here follows the decollacion of saint Johan Baptist
AT is read that the decollacion of saint Johan baptist was establysshed for
four causes like as it is fou^dein the book of office / First for his
decollacion / Secondly for the brennyng and gaderynge to geder of his bones /
Thyrdly for the Inuencion and fyndyng of his heed / And fourthly for the
translacion of his fyngre and dedycacion of the church / And after sum people
this feste is named dyuersly / that is to say decollacion / Collection /
Inuencion / and dedicacion / First this feste is hallowed for his decollacion /
which was made in this manner / For as hit is had in historia scolastica /
Herodes Antipa sone of the great Herod went to Rome / and passed by the hows
of philip his brother / and began to love the wife of his brother / which was
named Herodyane / wife of the same philip his brother / after that Josephus says
/ she was suster of Herod Agryppa / And when he returned / he refused and
repudyed his own wife and secretly wedded her to his wife / the which thing
his wife knew well that he had wedded his broders Wife / And this first wife of
Herod was daughter of Areth / king of damask / And therefore she abode not the
coming home of her husbond / but went to her fader as soon as she might / And
when Herod returned / he took awey the wife of phelyp his brother / and wedded
her and left his own / And there moeued against him therefore Herod Agryppe And
the king of Arethe and Phelyp bycam his enemies / And saint Ioh^n said to him /
that he had not done well to do so / by cause after the law hit apperteyned
not to him to have and hold the wife of his brother living / And Herod saw
that Johan repreuyd him of this thing / so cruelly as Josephus says by cause
he repreued him of blame / he assembled great people for to please his wife / And
did do bind and put saint Johan in prison / but he would not slay him for
doubt of the people / which much loved Johan / and followed him for his
predicacion / and Herod and Herodyan couetyng occasyon ageynste saint Johan /
how they might make him to dye / ordained between them secretetely / that
when Herod should make the Feste of his Natyuyte / the daughter of Herodyane
should demand a yefte of Herod for daunsyng and spryngyng at the feste to
fore the pryncipal princes of his royamme / And he should swear to her by his
oath that he shall grant hit her / And she should axe the head of saint Johan
/ and he would give it to her for keeping of his oath / but he should feign as he
were angry by cause of making of the oath / And it is read in thystorye
scolastyk that he had this tricherye and great fantasye in him / where it is
said thus / It is to be byleuyd that Herod treated first secretly with his
wife of the death of saint Johan / And under this occasion says Iherom in the
gloss / And therefore he swear for to find occasion to slay him / For if she
had required the death of his fader or mother / he had not given it to her / ne
consented it / And when the feste was assembled / the maid was there spryngyng
and daunsyng to fore them all in such wise / that hit plesyd much to all /
And then swear the king / that he would give to her what someuer she required
/ though she demanded half his kingdom / And then she warned by her mother /
demanded the head of saint Johan baptist / Nevertheless herood by euylle
courage feigned that he was angry by cause of his oath And as Rabanus says /
that he had sworn folyly / that he must needs do / But he made no sign of
sorrow saufe in the vysage / For (...) was joyous in his heart / he excused the
felonye of his oath / showing that he did it under the occacion of pity /
Then the hang man came / and smote of his heed / and delyuerd it to the maid
/ the which she leyd in a plater / and presented hit at dinner to her
meschyuous mother / And then Herod was much abashed / when he saw hit /
And saint Austyn reherceth in a Sermon / that thoccasion of the decollacion was
the sweryng / that there was an Innocent man and a true / which had lent
certain money to another man / which denied it him when he axed it / And the
good man was meued and constrained him by his oath to swear / whether he ought
him or no / And he swear / that he ought him naught / And so the creditor
lost that he had lent / and then he says / that in the next day following
the creditor was rauysshed / and brought to fore the Judgment / and hit was
asked him why call thou that man for to be byleuyd by his oath / and he said
by cause he denied my debt / and the Judge said / it had been better to the to
lose thy debt / than he should lose his soul by making of a falls oath as he
did / And then this man was taken and greu ously beten / so that when he
awoke the tokenes of his wounds appeared on his back / but he was pardoned and
forgeuen / And after this Austyn says / that saint Johan was not byheded on
this day / when the feste of his decollacion is hallowed / but the year to fore
about the feste of Eester / And by cause of the passion of Ihesu Christ and of
the sacrament of our lord hit is differred unto this day / For the less ought
to give place / to the more and gretter / And of that saint Johan / saint Johan
Crysostom says / Johan the baptist byheded is bicome master of the scole of
virtues / and of life the form of holiness / the Rewle of Justice / the myrrour
of vyrgynyte / the ensample of chastyte / the weye of penance / pardon of
sin / and disciplyne of faith / Johan is gretter than man / peer unto the
Angels / sovereign holiness of the law of the gospel / the voys of
thappostles / the scylence of the prophets / the lantern of the world / the
forgoer of the Judge / and moyen of all the Trynyte / And this so great a man
was put to martirdom / and gaf his head to the aduoultrer / and delyuerd to the
spryngyng maid / Herod then went not awey al unpunished / but he was
dampened in to exyle / For as it is contained in thystory Scolastyke / Herod
Agryppe was a noble man / but he was pour / And for his over much pouerte he
was in despair / and entryd in to a certain toure for to suffer death there by
famyne and hongre / But when Herodyane his suster herd thereof / she prayed
Herod tetrarche / that he would bring him thens / and mynystre to him / And
when he had done so / they dyned to gyder And Herodes Tetrarcha began to
chauffe him by the wyn / which he had dronken / And began to repreue Herod
Agryppe of the bienfettes that he had done to him / And that other sorowed sore
/ and went to Rome / and was received in to the grace of Gaius the emperor /
and gafe to him two lord ships / that is to say of lusayne and Abylyne / and
crowned him / and sent him king in to the Iewrye / And when Herodyane saw her
brother have the name of a king / she prayed her husbond with great wepynges /
that he should goo to Rome / and bye him the name of a king / he habunded
gretely in Rychesses / and entendyd not to her desire / For he had lever be
idle in rest than to have honor laboryous / But at the last he was ouercomen
by her besy prayers / and went to Rome with her / And when Herod Agryppe
knew it / he sent lettres to the Cezar / that Herod Antipas or thetrarcha
had made friendship with the king of perces and alyaunce / and that he would
rebelle against thempyre of Rome / And in token of this thing he signyfyed to
him / that he had in his garnysons armours ynowe for to garnysshe with seven
thousand men / And when the emperor had read these lettres / he was much glad
/ and began to speak of other things first a far fro his purpose / And
among other things he demanded him / if he had in his Cytees great
habundaunce of armures / as he herd say / and he denied hit not to him /
Then the emperor byleuyd well that which Herod had sent him in writing /
and was angry toward him / and sent him in to exyle / And by cause his wife was
suster to Herod Agryppe / whom he much loved / gaf to her leave to return to
her Countreye / but she would goo with her husbond in exyle / and said / that he
had been in great prosptryte / she should not leave him in his aduersytees / And
then were they brought to lions / And there ended their lives myserably /
This is in thystory Scolastyke / Secondly this feste was establysshed and
hallowed for the brennyng of his bones / and gaderyng to gyder on this day /
like as sum say / they were were burnt / and were gadryd up of good Christian
men / And then suffrid he the second martyrdom / when his bones were burnt
/ And therefore the Church haloweth this feste also / as his second martyrdom /
as it is read in thystorye Scolastyke / For when his disciples had borne his
body in to the Cite of Sebasten palestyne / they buried hit between Helyzee and
Abdyas / And at his tomb many miracles were showed Then Iulyan thappostata
commanded that his bones should be brent And they cessed not to do their
woodenes / then they took them and brent them in to poudre / and wynewed
them in the feldes / And Bid says in his Chronicles / that when they h^d
gadred his bones / they drew them a far that one fro that other / And by
this wise he suffered the second martyrdom / But they say that kn^wen it not /
that the day of his natyuite his bones were gadryd all about and Were burnt /
And whiles they were in gadryng as it is said in Scolastica historia / there
came Monks fro Jerusalem / which covertly putt them among the gaderers and
took a great part of them / and bure them to Phelyp Bishop of Jerusalem / And
he sent them afterward to athanayse bishop of Allexandrye / and long time
after Theophyle Bishop of the same Cite leide them in the Temple of Serapis
when he had hallowed and purged it fro fylthe / and sacred it a church in
thonoure of saint Johan Baptist / and this is that thystorye scolastike says /
But now they be worshipped deuoutely at Iene / like as alexander the third and
Innocent the fourth witnesses for truth / and approwe it by their
pryuelegys / And like as Herod which biheded him was punysshed for his trespass
/ so Iulyan thappostata was smyten with dyuyne vengeance of god / whose
persecucion is contained in thystorye of saint Iulyen to fore rehearsed after
the conversion of saint Poul / Of this Iulyan appostata / of his natyuyte of
his empire / of his cruelte / and of his death is said plainly in historia
tripertita / Thirdely this feste is halewed for the Inuencion of his heed or
finding thereof / For as sum say / his heed was founden on this day / And
as hit is read in thystorye Scolastyke / Johan was bounden and enprysonned /
and had his head smyten of within the castle of Arabye / that is named
Mache^onte / And Herodyane did do bear the head in to Jerusalem / and did do
burye it secretly / there by where as herod dwelled / For she doubted / that
the prophet should rise again if his head were buried with the body / And as
hit is had in thystory Scolastyke in the time of Marcian the prince / which was
the year of our lord / three honderd / and liij / Johan showed his head to two
monks that were comen to Jerusalem / And then they went to the palace
which was longing to herod / and fond the head of saint Ioh^n wrapped in an
hair / And as I supoose / they were of the vestymentes that he ware / in
deserte / And then they went with the heed toward their propre places / And
as they went on their wey / a pour man which was of the Cite of Emyssene came
and felaushipped with them / And they delyuerd him the bag / in which was
the holy heed / Then this man was warned in the night that he should goo his
Way / and flee fro them with the heed / and so he went with the heed / and
brought hit in to the Cite of Emyssene / And there as long as he lived / he
worshyped the heed in a cave / and had alwey good prosperyte / And when he
should dye he told and showed it to his suster / chargynge her to tell it to no
body / by her faith / and she kept it all her life like as he had done to fore
long time After that long time the blessid Ioh^n Baptiste made reuelacion of
his head to saint Marcell Monk that dwelled in that cave / in this manner / him
seemed in his slepyng / that many companyes syngyng went thither and said / loo
here is saint Johan baptist / whom one lad on the right side / and another on
the lift side / and blessed all them that went with him / to whom when
Marcelle came / he raised him up / and took him by the chynne / and kyssed him
/ And Marcell demanded him / and said My lord fro whens art thou come to us /
And he said I am comen fro Sebasten / And then when Marcelle was awaked / he
merueyled much of this vysyon / And the night following as he slepte there came a
man to him / which awoke him / And when he was awaked he saw a right fair
sterre which shone amyddes of the c^lle thorugh the hows / And he ar^^s / and
would have touched it / and it turned suddenly on that other side / And he
began to run after hit / tylle that the sterre abode in the place where the
heed of saint Johan was / and there he da^f and fond a pot / and the holy
heed therein / And a Monk that would not believe that hit was the heed of saint
Johan leyd his hand upon the pot / and forthwith his hand brenned and
cleued so to the pot / that he couthe not withdraw it there fro in no manner
/ and his felawes prayed for him And then he drew of his hand but it was not
hoole / And saint Johan appeared to him and said / when my heed shall be set
in the church / touch thou then the pot / and thou shall be hoole / and
so he did / and received his health / and was hool / as it was before / Then
Marcelle showed this to Iulyane bishop of the same cite / and they bare it
reverently in to the cite and showed hit honorably And fro that time forth
the feste of his d^collacion was there hallowed / for it was founden the same
day / And after this it was transported in to the cite of Constantynople / And
as it is said in thystorye trypartyte / that Valent the emperor commanded that
it should be leyd in a charyot for to be brought to Constantinople / And when
it came to Galcydone / the charyot would go no ferther / how well that they set
in mo^estes to draw it / wherefore they must leave hit there / but afterward
theodofius would bring it thennes / And fond a noble woman set for to keep
it / And he prayde her that she would suffer him to bear awey the heed / And
she consented by cause that she supposed that like as valent might not have it
thens / that in like wise he should not conne have hit thennes

Then the emperor took it and enbraced in his arms much swetely the holy
head / And leyd it within his pourpre / and bare it in to the Cite of
Constantynople / and ediffyed there a right fair church / and set hit therein
/ This says the Hystorye trypertyte / After this in the time that the king
Pyppyne reigned / hit was transported in France in Peytowe / And there by his
merytes many deed men were reised to life / And in like wise as Herodes was
punysshed / that byheded saint Johan / And Iulyan appostata / that burnt his
bones / so was Herodyane / which counceylled her daughter to demand the
head of saint Johan / And the maid that required hit deyde right ungraciously
and euylle / And some say that Herodyane was condemned in exyle / but she was
not ne she deyde not there / but when she held the heed between her hands /
she was much ioyeful / but by the will of god / the heed blewh in in her
vysage / and she deyde forthwith / This is said of sum / but that which is
said to fore that she Was sent in exyle with Herod and myserably ended her
life / This sayen saints in her Chronicles / and it is to be holden / And as her
daughter went upon the water she was dro^ned anon / And it is said in another
Cronycle / that the earth swalowed her in all quycke / and may be vnderstonden
as of the egypcia^s / that were drouned in the reed see / so the earth
devoured / Fourthly / this feste was hallowed for the translacion of his fyngre
/ and the dedycacion of his church / For his fyngre with which he showed our
lord as it is said might not be burnt / And this said fyngre was founden of
the said monks / which afterward as it is had in historia Scolastica / Saint
Tecle brought it over the Montayns / and set it in the church of saint
Martyn / And this witnesses Master Johan Beleth saying / That the said saint
Tecle brought the same fyngre fro beyond the sea in Romayn And there builded a
church in thonoure of saint Johan / which church as it is said was dedycate
and hallowed this same day / wherefore it was stablysshed of our holy father the
pope / that this day should be hallowed thorugh the world / And Gobert says
that a much devout lady toward saint Johan was in France / which much
prayed to our lord / that he would give to her sum relykes of the said saint
Johan / And when she saw that it prouffyted not in prayeng to god / She
began to take affyaunce in god / and auowed that she would fast and neu^^ete
mete till she had of him sum relyque / And when she had fasten ^^^tayne days
she saw upon the table to fore her a fyngre of merueylous whytenes / And she
received with great joy that yeft of god / Then after came thither three
Bisshops / and each of them would have part of the fyngre / Then by the grace
of god / the fyngre dropped three drops of blood upon a clo^h by which they
knew that each of them had deseruyd to have a drop / And then Theodolye
queen of the lom^^rdes founded at (...) beside Me^^n a noble church in thonour
of saint Johan baptist / And like as Powle witnessith in thystorye of lombardes
/ an^ the time passed unto Constaunce the emperor which would have take ytalye
fro the lombardes / And he demanded of an holy man / which had a spy^yt of
prophecye / how he should do with (...) bataylle which he had enterprysed /
And that man was all night in prayer / and came to the emperor / and ansuerde to
him and said / The queen has de^ made a church of saint Johan baptist And
prays contynuelly for the Lombardes / And therefore thou may not surmounte
them / but the time shall come / that that place shall be despised / And
then they shall be ouercomen / Which was accomplysshed in the time of
Charlemayne On a time came a man of great virtue / as saint gregorye says in his
Dyalogue / whoes name was sanctyn / and had received in his keeping a d^ken /
that was taken of the lombardes by such a con^icion / that if he fled he
should have ^is head smyten of / The said Sanctyn constrained the deken to flee
/ and delyuerd him And when the ^^ken was gone they took the same sanctyn /
and led him forth to be byheded / And they chese a strong tyrant to do hit
/ And he had no doubt to smite of his head at one stroke / And then the
said Sanctyn stretched forth his neck / And the strong Boucher lift up his
arm with the swerd / and Sanctyn cried saint Johan receive my soul / And
then anon the arm of the Boocher was so styf / that he couthe not bring it
down again / ne bow it in no manner / And then that Boucher made his oath /
that he would never after in his life smite no Christian man / And the good man
Sanctyn prayed for him And anon the arm came down / and was all hoole / Then
late us pray unto this holy saint / saint Johan baptist to be a moyen between
god and us that we may so live virtuously in in this life / that when we shall
depart / we may come to ever lastyng life in heaven Amen

often / why honor thou not our gods / It is better that thou deye allone /
then we al be wrapped in the death / And then Sauyen fled secretly awey /
and went unto the Cite of Trecasyne / And as he went over the River of Secane
/ he prayed our lord that he might be baptized there / and so he was / And
then our lord said to him / thou have fou^den now that / which thou have

And he said yes Then the emperor being full of wodenes / had him to sacryfyse
to his gods / or else he would make him deye an euylle death / Sauyen refused
hit / And anon he commanded to bind him / by the hands and by the feet /
and to beat him with staves of iron / And then sauyen said to him / encrece
the torments if thou may hardyly / For I doubt not ne fere not the ne the
torments that thou do to me / And then the emperor being all wroth /
commanded that he should be brought in to the myddel of the Cite / and there be
bounden upon a benche / and make a great fi^^ there under / and cast oil therein
/ that he might be burnt and bruyled / And he being within the flamme
themperoure byhelde him / and saw that he was joyous therein / as he had been in
a bayne / whereof he was much abashed / and said to him Euylle beeste
suffyseth it not enough to the / the sowles that thou have deceived / though
thou not assaye to deceive by thy art magyke / To whom Sauyen said / there ben
many sowles yet / and also thy self / which shall by me believe in our lord
Ihesu Christ / And then themperoure blamed the name of Ihesu Christ / and
commanded that he should be bounden on the morn at a stake / and be shotten at
with arowes / The arowes abode hangyng in the air on the right side and on the
lift / and none of them hurted him / And when the emperor knew that he had
none harm / he wend to have been enraged / And commanded that the next day
following he should be brought to him / And after he demanded him / where is thy
god / Now let him come hither and deliver the fro these arowes / And as soon
as he had said so / one of the arowes sprange in to the eye of the emperor /
and smote out his eye / and then the emperor was angry / And commanded to
put him in prison / And that on the next morn erly he should be byheded / And
then Sauyan prayed our lord that he might be brought in to the place where as

braken / and the doors of the prison were opened / and he went out of the
prison / And went to fore all the knights that kept him / And they in no
manner apperceyued him / And went in to the same place / And when the emperor
herd say / that he was escaped / he commanded that he should be pursewed /
And that his head should be smyten of / And when saint Sauyen apperceyued /
that the knytes followed and that he approached the water / he made the sign of
the Cross / and went upon the water / like as he should have gone upon the
earth dry / and went unto the place / where as he was baptized / then the
knights followed him and were much abashed of that they had seen him gone on
the water / And when they were nyghe him / they doubted much to smite at him /
And he said to them / smite me when ye will al surely and bear of my blood to
your emperor / and late him rub his eye therewith / and he shall be hoole
/ to the end that he know the virtue of god / And after this they smote his
head of / And he roose up and bare it thene nine and forty paas / and there
was buried / And after that the knights bare of his blood to the emperor /
wherewith he enoynted his eyes / and anon he had his sight and was al hoole /
And then he said his god is good and myty / And there was by a woman / that

forty year / And then she made her to be borne thither / And as soon as she
had touched his sepulcre / and made her prayer / anon she received health and
her sight again / And he suffered death about the year of our lord CC / lxx /
in the kalendes of Feuerer / and the historye of his suster is here set by
cause that the feste of her is on the same day / And as Sauyne his suster wept
every day for her brother / and sacryfised for him to thydollis / and in the end
the angel appeared to her in her sleep and said Sauyne weep no more / but love
all that thou have / and thou shall find thy brother in great honor / Then
she awoke / and said to her felawe / My sweet love haste thou herd no thing /
and she said yes lady / For I have seen a man that spoke to the / But I wot
not what he said / and then she said to her / wylt thou not accuse me / and
she said no lady / but do what thou wylt / so that thou slay not thy self /
And thus they both went aweye that morning / and whenne her fader wyste it
that she was gone he was much so rouful / and did do seche her long / And
then he lift up his eyes to heaven and said if thou art very god of heaven /
I pray the destroy mine ydollys / which may not save me ne my childeren / And
anon our lord made it for to thondre / and brake all the ydollys / and much
people saw it / which bileuyd in our lord / Then the blessid Sauyne went to
Rome / And there she was baptized of the blessed Euse be the pope / and dwelled
there five year / And heled two lame men / and two blind men / And then the
Angel appeared to her in her sleep / and said to her / what is this that thou
do that have left thy Rychesses / and lyuest here in delyces / Arise and
dyne / And after goo in to the cite of Trecane / that thou may find there
thy brother / And then she said to her chambryere / It behooves us no longer
to abyte here / And she said / lady / whyder will ye go^ / All the people here
love you well / And will ye go dye in a place / where as the people know you
not / And she said / god shall purueye for us / And then she took a loof of
barley breed / and went unto the Cite of Rauenne / and entryd in to the hows of
a rich man / whose daughter was bewailed as deed / And she required the maid
of the hows / that she might be lodged there / And she said / how may thou be
lodged here / when the daughter of h^rin is deed and all be sorrowful / And
she said to her / For me she shall not deye / and then she entrid in / and
took the hand of the maid / and raised her up al hole / And the mother would
have retained her there / but she in no wise would agree thereto / but departed /
And the daughter lived / and aroos on the morn / And when Sauyne with her
chambryere arrived a mile nyghe unto trecane / she said to her Chambryere /
that she would there rest a little / And there came a noble man fro the Cite
named Lyceryen / and demanded them saying Of whens be ye / To whom Sauyne
seyde / I am of this Cite / And he said Why lie thou / when thy speech
shows the to be a pilgrim / And she said / Verayly I am a pilgrim / and feche
Sauyen my brother / whom I have long lost / And he said to her / that man for
whom thou demaundest was but late slain for the name of Ihesu Christ / and is
buried in such a place / And then she put her in prayeng and said / lord
which have alwey kept me in chastyte / suffer me then no more to travail by
these hard and weary Iourneyes / ne my body to be rem^ued out of this place /
And lord I recommaunde to the my chambryere which has suffered so much pain
for me / and for my brother / whom I may not here see / I byseche the to make
me worthy to se him in thy regne / And when she had fynysshed her prayer /
she passed out of this world and went to our lord / when her chambryere
saw that her maystresse was deed / she began to weep / by cause she had
nothing necessary to bury her with / The said man then sent a cryat thorugh
the Cite / that all great and small should come see the strange woman that was
there deed / And incontinent all the people ran / and she was buried
honorably / And this same day is the feste of saint Sauyne that was wife of
saint Valentyn knight / which was byheded under Adryan the emperor / by cause
he would not sacryfyse to thydollys /

Thus enden the lives of saint Samen martyr and of Sainne his sustir
Here follows the lif of seine Low And first of thinterpretacion of his name
EOwe or Lupe is sum sekenes in the leg / which behooves a medycyne / For
hit is a maladye that regneth and uses the flesh / And also hit is said a
manner of fysshe that is on the water / and on the land / And it may not drown
by no force of water / And thus may be expowned saint Low / For he used and
strayned his propre flesh by penance / For he was like the lupe of the water
and of the earth / For he duellyd in the waters of d^ly^es of rychesses / and of
temptacions / and might not drown among these waters in no wise /

Of saint Lupe or Low
Saint Lupe or Low was borne at Orleau^ce / And was of the ryal lygnage / And
by the resplendysshour of his great and many miracles and virtues / He was made
Archebisshop of Sense / And gaf all that he had to pour people / And on a
day when all was given / It happed that he had boden many men to dyne /
with him / And then his mynystres said that there was not wyn half enough for
the dinner / And he answered to them / he that fedeth the birds of heaven shall
perform his^ haryte of wine And anon after come a messager to the yate that
said to them that there were a reyued to fore the yate an honderd M^es of wine
On a time they of the Court said euylle of him / by cause that he had with him
a vyrgyn of our lord / which was daughter of his predecessor / And as they
said he loved ^eramour / and spoke much despytously / and over dysatemperately
/ And when he herd these things / he took the vyrgyne and kyssed her / to
fore all the detractours and euylle sayers and said / that no strange ne
evil words ennoye ne hurt no man when his own conscience defoylleth him
not / And by cause he knew well that she loved well Ihesu Christ and purely /
therefore this holy man louyd her with a right pure thought / On a time when
the king Clotayre was king of France / and entered in to Burgoyne / he sent
his styward against them of sens for to assyege the Cite / Then Lupe entered
in to the church / and began to ring the clock And when thenemyes herd it
/ they had so great dread that they supposed never to have escaped fro thennes
/ but that they should have deyde all / but if they fled / and at the last
the stywarde of Burgoyne was taken / ^ And when he was taken / there was
another styward sent in to Burgoyne / and came to Sens / And by cause saint
lupe had given to him no gifts / he had great despyte / And diffamed him to
the king / so that the king sent him in to exyle / And there he shone by
miracles and virtues / And in the mean while they of Sens slew a Bishop
which had taken the place of saint lupe / And after they impetred of the king
that saint Lupe returned fro exyle / And when the king saw that he was
wrongly do to / he was changed by the grace of god / that he knelyd to fore
the saint / and required pardon / And restablysshed him again in his church /
and gaf to him many fair yeftes / On a time as he came to paris / a great
company of prisoners came ageynste him / their bonds broken / And all the
doors of the prison open On a sunday as he song mass / A precious stone fylle
down fro heaven in to his chalyce / the which he gaf to the king / which he
held for a noble relyque / On a time the king Clotayre herd say / that the
Clockes of saint Steu^n of Sens had a merueylous swetenes in their sown / And
sent for them / and took them fro thens / and did do bring them to Paris /
by cause he would here the sown of them but it displeased much to saint Lupe
And as soon as they were out of the Cite / they lost all their swetenes of
their sown / And when the king herd that / he commanded that they should be
brought again in to their place / And as soon as they were seven mile nyghe
unto the Town / they began to repryse their sown / like as they had to fore
/ And saint Lupe went against them / and received them with greet Joy / and
honor / For he had lost them with great sorrow to fore / On a night as he
prayed / he had over great thyrste by the false meuynges of the deuylle / And he
demanded cold water for to drink / And he knew well the trecherye of the
enemy / And when he held the vessel / in which he should drink / he set a
plater upon it and shytte the deuylle fast therein / and he began all the
night to howl and braye / And in the morning the holy man coniured him / that
he that was comen by night to tempte him / by day he let him goo al confused
/ On a time as he by night vysyted the chirches / as he was acustomed / as he
returned home / he herd his clerks brawlyng and chydyng by cause they would
do fornycacion with wymmen / which anon entryd in to the church / and prayed
for them / And anon all the pryckyng of temptacion went fro them / And they
came to fore him / and demanded pardon and foryeuenes / At the last he being
ennoblyd in many virtues slepte in pees in our lord / He flouryd about the
years of our lord / six honderd / and ten /

Here begins the lif of saint Mamertyn / And first of thyn terpretacion of
his name
SAmertyn is said of Mamma / which is as much to say as a pappe / And of
tyna / that is to say taste / for like as taste that falls fro the pappe in
to the mouth of the child / and is first nature of blood / And after hit is
converted in to the swetenes of Milk / In like wise was he nourysshed first
in blood / that is to say in sin / And after he conuertid him self anon in
to the pappe of his heart in the swetenes of god

Of saint Mamertyn
MAmertyn was first a paynym / and worshipped thydolles / and it happed on a
time he lost his one eye / and his hand was dried up / And he supposyd / that
he had angryd his gods / And went toward the Temple for to adoure thydollys
/ And there met him on the way a Relygyous man / named Sauyn / which
demanded of him how this Infyrmyte happed to come to him / And he said I have
^ngryd my gods / And therefore I goo adoure them / to the end / that if they
ben angry / they may bec^me de^onayr to me / To whom he answered Brother / thou
errest / For thou wenest / that the deuyls be g^ddes / but go unto saint
Germayn / bishop of Ancerre / And if thou wylt believe his counceylle / thou
shall be hoole anon / Then anon he took his wey to goo thither / And went
to the sepulture of saint Amadour bishop / and of moo other saints / And by
cause of the great rain that fylle that night / he went in to the celle /
which was set on the Tomb of saint Concord / And as he slept he saw a
merueylous vysyon / Him thought / there came a man to the door of the Celle / and
called saint Concord / And said / that he should come to the feste that saint
Amad^ur / and saint peregryn / and other saints made / and he answered again
out of the tomb that he might not now come for his gheste / whom he must
keep for the serpents that were there would else slay him / And he went / and
told to the other what he had said / and anon he returned again / and said /
Holy saint Concordyen / arise / and come and being with the Viuyan the deken /
and Vyuyan the subdeken for to do their office / and Alexander shall keep thy
gheste / Then it seemed to Mamertyn / that saint Concordyen took him by the
hond / and ^ad him with him / And when saint Amadour saw him / he demanded of
him who is this / that is come with the An he said it is my gheste / And he
said / put him out / For he is al foul / and may not be here with us / and
when he should be put out / he kneled to fore them / and gate grace of
saint Amadour / which commanded him to goo to saint germayne / Then he a
woke / and came to saint Germayne / and kneled to fore him / and required pardon
/ and told to him all that was happed / And they went then to gyder to the
Tomb of saint Concordyen / And lift up the stone / and saw many serpents /
which were ten foot long / and would have flowen awey / but saint Germayne
commanded / that they should goo in to such a place / there as they should
neither grieve ne hurt man / And then Mamertyn was baptized / And was made
all hoole / and was made a Monk in the Monastery of the blessed saint Germayne
/ And was Abbot after saint Elodyen / And in his time saint Maryne was there a
Monk / whoos obedyence saint Mamertyn would prove / and commysed him to keep
the foulest office of the monasterye / And made him herdman of the oxen and
kyen in an isle that was there / but he was of so great holiness that wild
birds came to him / and were nourysshed of his hand / And delyuerd a wild
bore fro the hounds / and let him goo his way / There came thieves / and robbed
him on a time of all that he had / and took awey all his clothes sauf a
mantel / And when they were gone he called them again And said Return and
come again For I have fou^den here a penny in my mantel / parauenture it is
necessary to you / which anon returned / and took awey the mantel with the
penny and left him naked / And then as they went hastily toward their
withdraughte and secret places / they went all that night / And in the morning
they fond them at his Celle / whom he salewed / and received them benyngly /
and weesshe their feet / and mynystred to them such as he had / then they
were astonyed and repented them / and each of them was converted to the faith
/ On a time young Monks that dwelled with saint Mamertyn / had set snares
for to take a bear which was a customed to ete their sheep / And the bear
fylle in the snare / and was taken which saint Mamertyn lyeng in his bed
knew / and aroos out of his bed and fyndyng him in the snare said / what do
thou here thou wretch / flee hens / lest thou be taken / and losed him and
let him goo / And when this holy man was deed / And his body was borne to
Angyers / as they came by a Town / they might not remeue him thens in no manner
unto the time that a man / that was there in prison came out suddenly / and
brake his two bonds And ran freely to the corpse / and help to bear it in to
the Cite where hit is buried honorably in the church of saint Germayn in
much great reverence

Thus ends the life of saint Mamertyn

church a man was smeton with a serpent and deyde / And Gyles came against this
serpent / and made his oryson / and chaced out of him all the venym / There was
a man which was demonyake in the monasterye with other people / and troubled
them that herd the service of god / Then Gyles coniured the deuylle / that
was in h^s body / And anon he issued out / and anon he was al hoole / Then
Gyles doubted the parylle of the world / and went secretly to the Ryua^^ of
the sea / And saw there marynas in great peril / and like to (...) in the sea
And he made his prayer / and anon the tempest cessed / and anon the maronners
came to bond and thanked god And he understood by them / that they went to
Rome / And he desired to go with them / whom they received in to their ship
gladly / And said they would bring him thither without any freyght or huyr / And
then he came to Arelete / and abode there two year with saint Cezaryen Bishop
of that Cite And there he heled a man / that had been seek of the fevers three
year / And after he desired to goo in to deserte / and departed covertly / and

and caused great plente of goods / And when he had done this miracle / he
doubted the peril of the glory humayne / and left that place / and entered
ferther in to deserte / And there fond a pytte / and a little well and a fair
hynde / which without doubt was purueyed of god for to norysshe him / And at
certain hours mynystred her milk to him / And on a time servants of the
king roode on hontyng / and much people / and many hou^des with them / It
happed that they espied this hynde / and they thoute that she was so fair /
that they followed her with hou^des / and when she was fore constrained / she
fled for socour to the feet of saint Gyles / whom she nourysshed / and then
he was much abashed when he saw her so chauffed and more tha^ she was wont to
be / and then he spra^g up and espied the hu^ters / Then he praid to our
lord Ihesu criste / that like as he sent her to him for to be nourisshed by
her / that he would save her / Then the hou^des durst not approach her by the
space of a stone cast / but they howled to gyder / and returned to the hunters
/ and then the nyt came / and they returned home again and took no thing /
and when the king herd say of this thing / he had suspection what it might be
/ and went and wa^ned the bishop / And both went thither with great
multitude af hu^ters / and when the h^u^des were on ye place where as ye hynd
was ^^en durst not go forth / as they did before but then they all
enuyronned the busshe for to see what there was / but that busshe was so thyck
/ that no man be might enter therein for the bre^bles and thorns that were
there / And then one of the knights drew up an arowe folyly for to make it
aferd and spring out / but he wounded and hurt the holy man / which cessed
not to pray for the fair hynde / And after this the hunters made weye with
their swerdes / and went unto the pytte / And saw there this ancient man /
which was clothed in thabyte of a Monk of a right honorable figure and parure
/ and the hynde lyeng by him / And the king / and the Bishop went allone to
him / and demanded him fro whens he was / and what he was / and why he had
taken so great a thycknesse of deserte / and of whom he was so hurt / And he
answered right honestly to every demand / And when they had herd him speak /
they thought that he was an holy man / and required him humbly pardon / And
they sent to him maystres and surgyens to hele his wound / and of fryd him
many yeftes / but he would never ley medycyne to his wound / ne receive their
yeftes / but refused them And he prayed our lord that he might never be hole
thereof in his life / For he knew well / that virtue should prouffyte to him in
Infyrmyte / And the king vysyted him often / and received of him the pasture of
health / And the king offryd to him many great Rychesses / but he reffused all
/ And after he admonested the king / that he should do make a monasterye /
where as the disciplyue of thordre of Monks should be / And when he had do
make it / Gyles reffused many times to take the charge and the Croce / And at
the last he was vaynquysshed by prayers of the king / and took hit / And
then king charles herd speak of the renommee of him / and impetred / that he
might see him / And he received him much honorably / And he prayed him to
pray for him / among other things by cause he had done a sin so foul and

the sin of the king was wryton in by order / and that it was pardonned him by
the prayers of saint Gyles / so that he were thereof repentaunt / and absteyned
him fro doing it any more / and hit was adjoined to the end / that who that
required saint giles for any sin that he had done / if he left it / that it
should be pardonned to him / And after the holy man deliuerd the cedule to the
king And he confessyd his sin / and required pardon humbly / Then saint
Gyles returned thens with honor / and when he came to the Cite of Verence / he
raised the sone of a prnyce / that was deed / And a little while after he
denounced that his monasterye should be destroyed of enemies of the faith / And
after he went to Rome / and gate pryueleges of the pope to his church / And
two doors of Cypress / In which were the images of saint Peter and Powle /
And he threw them in to the Tybre at Rome / and recommaunde them to god / for
to govern / And when he returned to his Monasterye / he made a lame man to goo
/ and fond the two doors of Cypres at the yate of his monasterye / whereof he
thanked god / that had kept them without brekyng in so many adventures as
they had been / and sithe he set them at the yates of the church / For the
beauty of them / and for the grace / that the church of Rome had done thereto
/ And at the last our lord showed to him his departing out of this world And
he said it to his brethren / and admonested them to pray for him / and so he
slepte / and deyde goodly in our lord / And many witness that they herd the
company of angels beryng the sowl of him in to heaven / And he flouryd about
the year of our lord / vijC /

Thus ends the life of seint Gyles
Here follows the natyuyte of our blessid lady
THe natiuyte of the blessed and glorious vyrgyne marye of the lignage of Judah
/ and of the Rial kynrede of dauyd took her Orygynalle beginning / Mathewe /
and Luke desceyue not the generation of Marye / but of Joseph / which was
far fro the concepcion of Christ / but the customme of writing was of such
ordynannce that the generation of wymmen is not showed / but of the men / And
verily the blessed Vyrgyne descended of the lygnage of Dauyd And it is certain
that Ihesu Christ was borne of this only vyrgyne / It is certain that he came
of the lygnage of Dauyd and of Nathan / For Dauyd had two sons / Nathan and
Salamon among all his other sons / And as Johan damascenne witnesses / that
of Nathan descended leuy / and Leuy engendryd Melchy / and Panthere / Panther
engendryd Barpanthere / Barpanthere engendryd Ioachym Ioachym engendryd the
vyrgyne marye / which was of the lygnage of Salamon / For Nathan had a wife / Of
whom he engendryd Jacob / And when Nathan was deed / Melchy which was sone
of leuy / and brother of panther wedded the wife of Nathan mother of Jacob / And
on her he engendryd Hely / And so Jacob / and Hely were brethehen of one mother
/ but not of one fader / For Jacob was of the lygne of Salamon / And hely of
the lygne of Nathan / And then Hely of the lygne of Nathan deyde without
Children / And Jacob his brother / which was of the lygne of Salamon took a
wife / And engendryd and raised the seed of his brother / and engendryd Joseph
/ Joseph then by nature is sone of Jacob by descente of Salamon / That is to
wit / Joseph is the sone of Jacob / and after the law he is sone of Hely
which descended of Nathan / For the sone that was borne was by nature his that
engendryd him / and by ye law he was sone of him yt was deed / like as it is
said in thystorye scolastyke / And Bid wytnessyth in his Cronycle / that
when all the generacions of thebrewes and other strangers were kept in the
most secret chestes of the Temple / Herod commanded them to be burnt /
wenynge thereby to make him self noble among the other / if the preues of the
lignages were failed / he should make them believe that his lygnage apperteyned
to them of Israel / And there were sum / that were called domynykes / for by
cause that they were so nygh to Ihesu Christ / and were of Nazareth / and they
had learned thordre of generation of our lord / a part of their grau^tsirs
faders / and a part by sum books / that they had in their howses / and
taught them forth / as much as they might / Ioachym spoused Anne which had a
suster named Hysmerye / And Hysmerye had a daughter named Elyzabeth / and Eliud
/ Elyzabeth was mother to Johan baptist / And Elyud engendryd Emynen / And of
Emynen came saint Seruace / whoos body lies in Mastreyght upon the River of
the Mase / in the bisshopryche of lyege / And Anne had three husbondes / Ioachym
/ Cleophe / and Salome / And of the first she had a daughter named Marye / the
mother of god / the which was given to Joseph in marriage / And she childed our
lord Ihesu crist And when Ioachym was deed / she took Cleophas the brother of
Joseph And had by him another daughter named Marye also / And she was married to
Alphee / And Alphee her husbond had by her four sons / that was James the
less / Joseph the Just / other wise named barsabee / Simon / and Jude /
Then the second husbond being deed / Anne married the thyrdde named Salome /
and had by him another daughter / which yet also was called Marye / And she
was married to Zebedee / And this Marye had of Zebedee two sons / that is to
wit / James the more / and Johan theuau^glyst / And hereof ben made these
verses / Anna solet dici / tres concepisse marias / Quas genuere viri / Ioachym
/ Clephas / Salomeque / Has duxere viri / Joseph / Alpheus / Zebedeus / Prima
parit Cristum / Iacobumque secunda minorem Et Joseph Iustum peperit cum Simone
Iudam / Tercia maiorem Iacobum Volucremque Iohannem /

But it is merueylous for to see ho^ the blessed vyrgyn Marye might be Cosyn
of Elyzabeth / as it is to fore said / It is certain that Elyzabeth was
Zacharyes wife / which was of the lignage of leuy / And after the law each
ought to wedde a wife of his own lignage / And she was of the daughters of
Aaron / as saint Luke wytnessyth And Anne was of Bethlehem / as saint Ieromme
says / and was of the Trybe of Judah / And then they of the lygne of leuy
wedded wives of the ligne of Judah / so that the lygne Royal / and the lygne of
the prestes were alweye joined to gydre by cosynage / So that as Bede says /
This Cosynage might be made sithe the first time / And thus to be norysshyd fro
lygnage to lygnage / And thus should it be certain that the blessed Vyrgyne
Marye descended of the Ryall lygne / and had cosynage of the priests / And
our blessed lady was of both lygnages / And so our lord would / that these
two lygnages / should entresemble to gyders for greet mysterye / For hit
apperteyneth that he should be borne / and offryd for us very god / and (...)
king / and very priest / and should govern his true christian men fyghtyng in
the Chyualrye of this life / and to crown them after their vyctorye / the
which thing apperith of the name of Christ / For Christ is as much to say as
enoynted / For in tholde law there was none enoynted but priests and kings /
And we ben said Christian of Criste / and ben called the lygnage chosen of kings
and priests / but by cause it is said that the man took wives of their lignage
only / that was by cause the distribucion of the sorts should not be confounded
/ For the trybe of leuy had not his sort with the other / and therefore might
they well marye them with the wymmen of ye tribe / or where they would like as
seint Ierom reherceth in his prologue wha^ he was a child he had a litil book
of thystory of the natyuyte of the vyrgyn Marye / but as he remembryd a long
time after he translated hit by the prayer of sum persons / And fond that
Ioachym / which was of galylee of the Cite of Nazareth / espoused saint Anne
of Bethlehem / And they were both Just / and without reproach or
reprehencion in the commandments of our lord / And divided all their
substance in three parties / that one party was for the Temple / That other
they gaf to the pour and pylgryms / And the thyrdde was for them self / and
their meyny to live with / And thus lived twenty year in marriage without
having any lignage / And then they auowed to our lord / that if he sent to
them any lygnage they should give hit to him / for to serve him / For which
thing they went every year in to Jerusalem in three pryncypal feestes / so that
in the fest of Eu^enye that was the dedycacion of the Temple / Then Ioachym
went unto Jerusalem with his kynrede / and came to the altar with the other /
and would have offryd his offryng / And when the priest saw him / he put him a
part by great despite / and repreuyd him by cause he came to the altar of god
/ and said to him that it was couenable / that a man cursyd in the feyth should
not offer to our lord / ne he that was barayne should be among them / that had
fruit / as he that had none to thenerece of the people of god / And then
Ioachym al confused for this thing / durst not go home for shame / by cause
they of his lygnage and his neyghbourghs / which had herd it should not
repreue him / And then he went to his herdmen and was there long / And
then the angel appeared to him only / and comforted him with great clerenes
/ And said to him / that be should not doubt ne be aferd of his vysyon / and
said / I am the Aungel of our lord sent to the for to denounce to the / that
thy prayers have auayled the / and ben herd / And thy almesses ben mounted to
fore our lord / I have seen thy shame / And herd the reproach that that thou
art barayn^ is to the no reproach by right / and god is venger of sin and not
of nature / And when he chosed the belly or womb / he werketh s^o that he
opens it after more merueylously / And the fruit that shall be borne / should
not be seen to come forth by lecherye / but that it be known that it is of
the yefte of god / The first mother of your people was Sara / And she was barayne
unto the nyenty year / And had only ysaac / to whom the benediction of al
people was promised / And was not Rachel long barayne / And yet had she after
Joseph / that held all the seygnorye of Egypt / which was more strong than
Sampson and more holy than Samuel / And yet were their moders barayne / Thus
may thou believe by reason / and by ensample / that the childynges long abyden
be woned to be more merueylous / And therefore Anne thy wife shall have a daughter
/ And thou shall call her Marye / and she as ye have auowed shall be fro her
Infancy sacred unto our lord / and shall be full of the holy ghooste / sithe
the time / that she shall depart fro the womb of her mother / and she shall
dwell in the temple of our lord / and not without among the other people / by
cause that none evil thing shall be had in suspecion of her and right as she
shall be borne of a barayne mother / so shall be borne of her merueylously the
sone of a right hyhe lord / Of whom the name shall be Ihesus / And by him
shall health be yeuen to all the peuple / And I give to the the sign / that
when thou shall come to the golden yate at Jerusalem thou shall mete there Anne
thy wife / which is much amoeued of thy^^ng taryeng / and shall have joy of
thy coming / And then the Aungel when he had said this / he departed fro him
/ And as when Anne wept bytterly and wyste not / whither her husbond was gone
/ The same Aungel apperyd to her and said all that he had said to her
husbonde / And gase to her for a sign that she should go in to Jerusalem to the
golden gate / and t^ere (...) should mete with her husbond which was returned
And thus by the commandment of thaungel they met and were ferme of the
lignage promised / and glad for to see each other / and honored our lord / and
returned home abydyng ioyously the promise dyuyne / And Anne conceived / and
brought forth a daughter / and named her Marye / And then when she had
accomplysshed the time of three year / and had left sowkyng / they brought her
to the Temple with offrynges / And there was about the Temple after the xv
psalms of degrees / xv stappes or grees to ascend up / to the Temple / by
cause the Temple was high set / And no body might go to the altar of
sacryfyses / that was without / but by the degrees / And then our lady was
set on the lowest step / and mounted up without any help / as she had be of
parsyght age / And when they had performed their offrynge / they left
their daughter in the Temple with the other Vyrgyns / And they returned in to
their place / And the vyrgyn marye prouffyted every day in all holiness / and
was vysyted daily of Angels / and had every day dyuyne visyons / Iheromme
says in a pystle to Cramacyen / and to Helyadore / that the blessid Vyrgyne
Marye had ordained this customme to her self / that fro the morning unto the
hour of tierce / she was in ^ryson and prayer / And fro tierce unto none she
intended to her work / And fro None she cessed not to pray till that thaungel
came / and gaf to her mete / And in the fourtenthe year of her age / the bishop
commanded in common / that the vyrgyns that were Instituted (...) the Temple /
and had accomplysshed the time of age / should return to their howses / and
should after the law be married / all the other obeyed his commandment / But
Marye answered that she might not do so by cause her fader and mother had given
her all to the seruyse of our lord /

And then the bishop was much angry by cause he durst not make her to
break her auowe against the scripture / that says / auowe ye vows / and yield
them to god / And he durst not break the customme of the people / And then came
a feste of the Jews / And he called a^le the ancient Jews to counceylle /
and showed to them this thing / And this was all their sentence / that in a
thing so doubtable / that counceylle shall be axed of our lord / And then
went they al to prayer / and the bishop that was gone to axe counceylle of
our lord / anon came a voys out of thoracle and said / that all they that
were of the hows of dauyd that were couenable to be married and had no wife /
that each of them should bring a rod to the altar / And the rod that
flourysshed / and after the saying of ysaye / the holy ghost sytte in the
form of a douue up on it / he should be the man that should be desponsate / and
married to the Vyrgyne Mary / And Joseph of the house of dauyd was there among
the other / And him seemed to be a thing vncouenable / a man of so old age as
he was / to have so tender a maid / And where other brought forth their rods
he hid his / And when no thing appeared according to the voys of god the
Bishop ordained for to ask cou^seylle again of our lord / And be answered /
that he only / that should espouse the vyrgyne had not brought forth his rod
/ And then Joseph by the commandment of the bishop brought forth his rod
/ And anon it flouryd and a douue descended from heaven there upon / so that it
was clearly thaduys of every man / that he should have the vyrgyne / And then
he espoused the vyrgyne Marye / and returned in to his Cite of Bethlehem / for
to ordeyne his meyne and his hows / and for to fetch such things as were
necessary / And the vyrgyne Marye returned unto the hows of her fader with
seven vyrgyns her felawes of her age / which had seen the demonstraunce of
the miracle / And in tho days the Angel of our lord appyered to the Vyrgyn
prayeng / and showed to (...) how the sone of god should be borne of her / And
the day of the Natyuyte was not known in long time of good christian men / and
as master Johan ^eleth says that it happed that a man of good contemplacion
every year in the ^^y^hydus of September was in prayer And he herd a company
of Angels that made great solempnyte / And then he required deuoutely / that
he myt have knowledge / wherefore every year only on that day / he herd such
solempnyte and not on other days / And then he had a dyuyne answer / that
on that day / the blessed Vyrgyne Marye was borne in to this world / And that
he should do it to be known to the men of holy church / so that they should
be concordable to the heavenly Court in halowynge this solempnyte / And when he
had told this to the sovereign Bishop the (...) / and to other / and had been
in fastings / in prayers / and sought in scryptures / and wytnessys of old
wrytynges / they establisshyd this day of the natyuyte of the glorious vyrgyne
to be hallowed generally of all Christian men / but the Vtas sometime was not
hallowed ne kept / But Innocent the fourth of the nation of give ordained and
Instytued the said Vtas to be observed / And the cause was this / After the
death of pope gregorye / anon the Cytezeyns of Rome enclosed all the
cardynallys in the conclaue by cause they should purueye litely for the church
/ but they might not acorde in many days / but suffered of the Romans much
sorrow Then auowed they to the queen of heaven / that if they might goo quyte
fro thennes / they should establysshe to halowe the octaues of ye Natyuyte /
which they had long neclygently left / And they then by one acord chees
Celestyn / and were delyuerd / and accomplysshed then their auowe by Innocent
/ For Celestyn lived but a little time / And therefore it might not be
accomplysshed by him / And hit is to wit that the church haloweth three
Natyuytees / the Natyuyte of our lord the Natyuyte of the blessed Vyrgyne Marye
/ and the natyuyte of saint Johan Baptist / And these three signefye three
natyuytees spyrytuel / For we be borne again with saint Johan Baptyst in the
water of baptym / and with Marye in penance / and with our lord Ihesu Christ
in glory / And hit behooves / that the natyuyte of bapteme goote fore
contrycion / and that of joy also / For the two by reason have vygylles / but
by cause that penaun^e is a^ou^ted for Vygyle / therefore that of our ledy
behooves no vygyle / but they have all vtas / For all haste them unto the
viij resurection / There was a knight much noble and devout unto our lady /
which went to a tornoyeng / And he fond a monasterye in his way / which
was of the vyrgyne Marye / and entryd in to it for to here mass / and there
were masses one after another / And for thonour of our lady / he w^l^ leave none
/ but that he herd them all / And when he issued out of the monastery / he
hasted him appertely / And they tha^ returned fro the tornaye met him / And
said to him that he had ryden right nobly / And they that hated him affermed
the same / And all they to gydre cried that he had right nobly tournoyed / And
sum went to him and said that he had taken them / Then he that was wise
auysed him that the curtois vyrgyne and queen had so curtoysly honored him /
and recounted all that was happende / And then returned he to the monasterye /
and ever after abode in the seruy^e of our lord / the sone of the blessed
vyrgyne / The^ was a Bishop / which had the blessid Vyrgyn Marye in souerayn
honor and devotion / And there he saw the vyrgyne of al virgyns / which came
to mete him / and began to lead him by sovereign honor to the chirch that he
went to / and two maidens of the compan^ went to fore syngyng / And saying
these verses Cantemus socie domino cantemus honorem / Dulcis amor cristi
personet ore pio / That is to say / Sing we felawes to our lord / sing we
honor / Sing we with a vois debonayre that sweet love which ought to plese
him and that other company of vyrgynes song and rehearsed again the same /
Then the two first syngers began to sing this that follows / Primus ad yma
ruit / magna de luce superbus / Sic homo cum timuit primus ad yma ruit / that
is to say / the first pride fill low fro great light / So the first man for
his etyng of thapple fylle low also / And so brought they to the church with
procession the said Bishop / And the two to fore began all way and the other
followed / There was a wydowe whose husbond was deed / and had a sone whom she
bouyd tendyrly And that sone was taken with enemies / and put in prison fast
bounden / And when she herd thereof / she wept without comfort / and prayed
unto our blessed lady with right devout prayers / that she would deliver her
sone / and at the last she saw / that her prayers auayled her not / and
entryd then in to the chirch where as thymage of our lady was coruen / and
stood to fore thymage / and aresoned hit / in this manner saying / O blessed
virgyn I have prayed often the for my sone / that thou sholdest deliver him / And
thou have not helped me his wretchyd mother / And I pray also thy sone to help
me / and yet I feel no fruit / And therefore like as my sone is taken fro me /
so shall I take awey thyn / and set him in prison in hostage for mine / and
in this saying she approached ner / and took awey fro thymage the child that
she held in her lap / And wrapped hit in clean clothes / and shett it in her
chyste / and locked it fast rizt dylygently / and was right Ioyeful / that she
had so good hostage for her sone / and kept it much dylygently / And the
night following / the blessed vyrgyne marye came to the sone of the same wydowe /
and opened to him the door of the prison / and commanded him to goo thens /
and said to him Sone say to thy mother / that she yield to me again my sone /
sith I have delyuerd her sone / And he issued / and came to his mother / and
told to her how our blessed lady had delyuerd him / and she was ioyefull /
and took the child / and came to the church / and delyuerd to our lady
saying / Lady I thank you / For ye have delyuerd to me my sone / And here I
deliver to you youres again / For I confess / that I have mine / There was a
thief that often stale / but he had alwey great devotion to the vyrgyn Marye /
and salewed her often / It was so / that on a time he was taken / and Iuged to
be hanged / and whenne he was hanged / the blessed vyrgyn sustained and held
him up with her hands three days that he deyde not / ne had no hurt / and
they that hangyd possid by adventure thereby / and fond him living / and of
glad chere / and then they supposed / that the cord had not be well
strayned / And would have slain him with a sword / and have cut his throat /
but our blessid lady set on her hand to fore the strokes / so that they might
not slay him / ne grieved him / and then knew they by that he told to them /
that the blessed mother of god help him / and then they merueyled / and took
him of / and let him go in thonour of the virgyn Marye / and then he went /
and entryd in to a monastery / and was in the service of the mother of god / as
long as he lived / There was a clerk that louyd much the blessid Virgyn / and
said his hours every day ententifly / and when his fader and mother were deed
/ they had none other heir / so that he had all the heritage / and then he
was constrained of his friends / that he should take a wife / and govern his
own heritage / And on a day it happed / that they intended to hold the fest
of his marriage And as he was going to the wedding he came to a chirch / and he
remembrid of the seruyse of our blessed lady / and entrid in / and began to
say his hours And the blessed Virgyne Marye apperid to him / and spak to him
a litel cruelly / O fool and unhappy / why haste thou left me / that am thy
spouse and thy friend / and love another woman to fore me / Then he being
moeued / returned to his felawes / and feyned al / and left to accomplysshe
the sacrament of marriage / And when mydnyght came / he left all / and fled
out of the hows / and entrid in to a monastery / and there served the mother of
god / There was a priest of a parysshe which was of honest and good life / and
couth say no mass / but mass of our lady the which he sange deuoutely in
thonour of her / wherefore he was accused to fore the bishop / and was anon
called to fore him / and the priest confessyd / that he couthe say none other
mass wherefore the bishop repreuyd him sore as uncunning and an ydeote / and
suspendyd him of his mass / that he should no more sing none fro than forthon
And then our blessed lady apperid to the Bishop / and blamed him much by
cause he had so entreted her chappelayne / And said to him that he should within
thyrtty days / if he restablysshed him not again to his office acustomed /
Then the Bishop was aferd / and sent for the preeste / and prayed him of
foryeuenes / And had him / that he should not sing / but of our lady / There
was a clerk which was vayn and ryotous / but alwey he loved much our lady the
mother of god and said every day his hours / And he saw on a night a vysion /
that he was in Judgment to fore our lord / And our lord said to them / that
were there / what Judgment shall we do of this clerk / deuyse ye hit / For I
have long suffered him / and see no sign yet of amendment / then our lord
gaf upon him sentence of dampnacion / and all they approved hit / Then aroos
the blessed vyrgyne / and said to her sone / I pray the dobonayre sone of thy
mercy for this man / so that thou asuage upon him the sentence of dampnacion
/ and that he may live yet by the grace of me / which is condemned to death
by his merytes / And our lord said to her / I deliver him at thy request for
to know / if I shall see his correction / Then our lady turned her toward
him / and said / goo / and sin no more / lest it happend werse to the /
Then he awoke / and changed his life / and entryd in to Relygyon / and
fynysshed his life in good works the year of our lord vCxxx and vij / There was
a man named theophyle / which was vycayre of a Bishop / As Fulbert says /
that was bishop of Chartres / And this Theophile dispendyd all wisely the
goods of the Church under the bishop / and when the Bishop was deed / all
the people said that his Vycayre should be Bishop / But he said thoffyce of
Vycayre suffysed him / And had lever that than to be made Bishop / So there
was theranother Bishop made / And Theophyle was against his will putt out of
his office / Then he fylle in despair in such wise that he counceylled a
Jew how he should have his office again / which Jew was a magycyen / and
called the deuylle / and he came anon / Then Theophyle by the commandment
of the deuylle renyed god and his mother / and renounced his Christian profession
/ and wrote an oblygacion with his blood / and sealed it with his ring / and
delyuerd it to the deuylle And thus he was brought in to his office again /
And on the morn Theophyle was received in to the grace of the Bishop / by the
precuracion of the devil / And was restablysshed in the dignyte of his office
/ And afterward when he aduysed him self / he repented and sorowed sore of this
that he had done / And ran with great devotion unto the vyrgyn mary with all
deuocio^ of his thout prayeng her to be his aid and help / And then on a
time our blessid lady apperyd to him in visyon / and rebuked him of his
felonnye And commanded him to forsake the devil. and made him to confess
Ihesu christ to be sone of god and to knowledge him self to be in purpoos to
Christian man / And thus he (...) the grace of her / and of her sone / And in
sign of pardon that she had gotten him / she delyuerd to him again his
oblygacion / that he had given to the deuylle / and leyde it upon his breast /
so that he should never doubt to be servant of ye devil / but he enjoyed
that he was so delyuerd by our blessid lady / And when Theophyle had
herd all this / he was much Ioyeful / and told it to the Bishop / and to
fore all the people that was bifallen him / And all merueyled gretely / and
gaf lawde and praysyng unto the glorious vyrgyne our lady saint Marye / And
three days after he rested in pees / There ben many other miracles / which
our blessid lady has showed for them that call upon her / which were over
long to write here / but as touching her natyuyte / this suffyseth / Then
late us contynuelly give laud and praysyng to her as much as we may / and
late us say with saint Ie romme this Response Sa^ncta et inmaculata vyrginitas
/ And how this holy Response was made I purpose under correction to write here
/ It is so / that I was at Coleyn / and herd reherced there by a noble doctor
/ that the holy and devout saint Ieromme had a custom to vysyte the chirches
at Rome / And so he came in to a Church / where an image of our blessed lady
stood in a chapel by the door / as he entryd / and passyd forth by without
any salutacion to our lady / And went forth to every altar / and made his
prayers to all the saints in the church each after other / And returned
again by the same image without any saleweng to her / Then our blessed lady
called him / and spak to him by the said image / and demanded of him the cause
why he made no salutacion to her seeing that he had done honor and worship to
all the other saints / of whom the images were in that church And then
saint Ieromme kneled down / and said thus / Sancta et inmaculata vyrginitas /
quibus the laudibus referam / nescio / Quia quem celi capere no^poterant tuo
gremio contulisti / which is to say / Holy / and vndefowled virgynyte / I wot
never what lawde and praysynges / I shall give unto the / For him that all
the heuenes might not take ne conteyne / thou have borne in thy womb / So sith
this holy man thought him self insuffycyent to gyne to her lawde / then what
shall we synful wretches do / but put us holy in her mercy knowlechyng us
insufficient to give to her due law and praysyng but late us mekely byseche
her taccepte our good entente and will / and that by her merytes we may
atteyne after this life to come to her in everlasting life in heaven / Amen /

Thus ends the lif of the natiuite of our blessid lady
Of saint Adrian martyr And first of his name
ADrian is said of A / which is as much to say as without / and of ydros
that is water For after that he confessyd to be Christian / he was without water
of sin / Or he may be said of Andor / that is to say light / and dyan / that
is to say god For he was enlumyned with light dyuyne by passion of martyrdom
/

Of Saint Adrian martyr
ADrian suffered death under Maxymyen Emperor / For when the said Maxymyen was
in the Cite of Nychomedye / where as he sacrefysed to the ydolles / And by his
commandment they sought all christian men / Sum sought them for dread And
sum for l^ue / And sum for promise of silver / so that neighbor brought
his neighbor to martyrdom / and cosyn his cosyn / Among whom three and
thyrtty were taken / of them that they sought / and broute to fore the king /
And the king said to them / have ye not herd / what pain is ordained ageynste
the christian men / And they said to him / We have herd the commandment of thy
folly / Then the king was angry and commanded that they should be beten with
raw synewes / and their mouths beten with stones / And that each of their
tongues should be perced with iron / and that they should be bounden / and closed
in prison / And then Adryan which was first in thoffice of knyghthode said
to them / I coniute you by your god / that ye tell to me the Reward that ye
entende to have for these torments / And the holy men said / that never eye
saw ne ere herd / ne heart of man might think tho things / that our lord
makes ready for them / that louen him parfyghtely / And Adryan leep in the
myddel among them and said / a compte ye me with them here / For I am a Christian
man / And when the emperor herd that / and that he would do no sacryfyce / he
did do bind him / and threw him in prison And when Natalye his wife knew /
that her husbond was in prison for the faith of Ihesu Christ / she was glad
and ran to the prison / and kyssed the chains that her husbond was bounden
with / and also of the other / for she was christian secretly / but she durst
not publysshe it for dread of the persecucion And she said to her husbond /
Blessed art thou my lord Adryan / For thou have founden the Richesse / Which
thy fader and mother never left to the / which have need of them / that possede
many things / and shall have thereof great need / when they shall have no
time to borowe / ne to take / when that one shall not deliver that other fro
pain / ne the fader the sone / ne the mother the daughter / ne the servant the
maystre / ne one friend another friend / ne Richesse them that owe them / And
when she had admonested him that he should despise all worldly glorys and
friends and kynrede / and that alwey he should have his heart unto celestial
things / Adryan said to her / Goo now my suster the time of our passion
hastes of which thou shall see our end / Then she recommaunded her
husbond unto the other saints / that they should comfort him / And then she
returned unto her hows / And after Adryan heryng when the day of his passion
should be / and gaf yeftes to the kepars of the prysonne / And delyuerd to hem
the other saints in pledge / and went to his hows for to call Natalye / like
as he had promised by oath / that she should be present at their passion / And a
man that saw him come / ran to fore him and said to Natalye / Adryan is
delyuerd / see loo where he comes / And when she herd it / she byleuyd it not
/ and said / And who may deliver him fro his bounds / god forbede that he be
losed of his bonds / and departed from the saints / And as she said these
words / a child of the meyne came / that said / Certes my lord is late goo /
And she supposed that he had fled fro his martyrdom. and wept bytterly / and
when she saw him / she shytte hastily the door ageynste him / late him be
far from me said she yt is fallen awey fro god and god forbede / that I speak
to the mouth of him / that has renyed his lord / And then she turned to him
/ and said / O thou wretch without god who constrained the to empryse and
take / which thou may not perform / who has taken the fro the saints or
who has deceived the for to depart from them / Say to me wherefore art thou
fled to fore thou saw the bataylles How art thou hurt / Certain hit is
of none arowe / that was shoten to the Certes I should have merueyled / if any
of the people of the felons and with out god had be offryd to god / and how
unhappy / and how caytyf am I / what shall I do / that am joined to him /
that is of the lygnage of felons / It is not granted to me to be the wif of a
martyr / but for a time / but now I shall be called the wife of a renegate and
transgressour / My Joy certainly has little endured / And it shall be to me a
reproach long time / And in herynge this thing / the blessed Adryan enjoyed him
strongly and merueiled much of his wife that was so young and right fair /
noble / and married but xiiij months without more / h^u she might say this /
And therefore he was the more ardaunt to martyrdom / And herd gladly these
words / But when he saw her ouermoche tormented / he said to her opene the
door to me Natalye my love and lady / For I have not fled the martirdom / as
thowwenest / but I am come to call the as I promised to the / And she byleuyd
it not / but said to him / See how this traytoure renegate deceyueth me / why
lie thou / that other Judas / Flee thou unhappy fro me / or I shall slay my
self And then thou shall be full / sorry and while she tarried to opene the door
/ he said opene anon / for I must goo / and then thou shall see me no more /
and then shall thou weep that thou have not seen me to fore my death / I have
leyd to pledge for me the holy martyrs And if the mynystres seche me / and
they find me not / they shall cause the saints to suffer their martyrdom /
and mine al^o / And when she herd that / she opened the door / And they then
embraced / and kyssed each other / and went to gyder to the prison And there
Natalye clensyd seven days during the wounds of the saints / with precious
clothes / And then the emperor commanded them to be brought to him / And they
were so broken with the pains / that they might not goo / but were borne as
beestes / And Adryan certainly was bounden his hands behind him / And spoke
to Natalye / and was born upon the torment of Eculee and presented to Cezar /
And Natalye joined her to him / and said to him / My lord / beware / that thou
tremble not for none adventure when thou shall see the torments / thou shall
not suffer here but a little / but thou shall be anon enhaunced with the
Angels / And then Adryan would not sacryfyse / and was beten right grievously
/ And then Natalye ran to the saints that were in the prison / and said my
lord has begone his martyrdom And the king warned him / that he should not
blame his gods / And he answered if I be thus tormented / that blame the^ that
be no gods / hou shall thou be tormented / that blasphemest him / that is
very god / And the king said to him / these other traitors have taut the these
words / To whom adryan said / Why call thou them traitors / which ben
Doctors / and enseygne the life perdurable / And Natalye ran to the other
with great joy / and told the words / that her husbond had said / And then
the king did him to be beten with four strong men And Natalye anon reported
to the other martirs that were in the prison / all the martyrdom / the
answers / and the pains of her husbond / and he was so sore beten that his
entrailles sprang out of his belly / And then he was bounden with iron and
put in prison / with the other / And Adryan was a young man lusty / and much
fair of eight and twenty year of age / And when Natalye saw her husbond lie
grouelynge upon the earth / and al to broken / she leyde her hand on his
heed in comfortyng him / and said / Thew art blessed my lord / For thou art
made worthy to be of the nombre of saints / thou art blessid my light / when
thou suffrest for him / that suffered death for the / Goo then forth my sweet
love that thou may see his glory / And when the emperor herd that many wymmen
mynystred to the saints in prison / he commanded that they should no more be
suffered to enter / And Natalye herd that she shoof her heed / and took
thabyte of man / and served the saints in the prison / and made the other
wymmen do so by the ensample of her / And she praid her husbond when he
should be in glory / that he would pray for her / that she might keep her
vndefowled in this world / or rather to be taken out thereof / And when the
king herd what the wymmen had done / he commanded to bring forth an anuelt or
a stythye / so that the holy martirs should have thereon her legs and arms
all to frusshed / and broken thereon and dye the sonner / And then Natalye
doubted / that her husbonde should be aferd for the torments of the other / and
prayde the mynystres / that they would begin with him / Then they hew of
his legs / and thyes / And Natalye prayed him / that he would smite of his
hondes to the end / that he should be like to the other saints / that had
suffered more than he / And when he had hewn them of / he gaf up his spyryte to
god / The other saints held forth their feet with their free will / and
passyd to our lord / And the king commanded that the bodies should be brent /
And Natalye hyd in her bosom the hond of saint Adryan / And when the bodies of
the saints were thrown in to the fire / Natalye would have with them sprongen
in to the fire / and ^e came / And suddenly anon (...) a (...) quenchyd the fire
/ so that the bodies of the saints had none harm / And the Christian men took
counceylle to gydre / and did do bear the bodies to constantynople tille that
the pees was given to the church / that they were fette again with honor /
And they suffered death about the year of our lord two honderd and four score
/ Natalye then abode and dwelled in her hows / and retained the hand of
saint Adryan / And for to have thereof she kept it al wey at her beds head /
And after the Judge saw natalye so fair / so rich and so noble by leave of
themperoure he sent wymmen to her / by cause she should consent to him by
marriage / to whom Natalye answered / who is he / that may do so much honor
/ that I may be joined to him by marriage / but I require you that I may have
term of three days to array and make me ready / And thi^ she said to the end /
that she might flee awey / Then began she to pray our lord that he would
keep her fro touching of man / And then suddenly she fylle a sleep / and one
of the martirs appeared to her / and comforted her swetely / and commanded her
that she should goo to the place where the holy bodies were / And when she
awoke / she took the hond of Adrian only with her / and entryd in to a ship
with many Christian men / and when the Judge herd it he followed after with many
knights / and then the wind came contrary to them / And drowned many / and
constrained the other to return / And then in the night the deuylle appeared
to them in guyse of a maronner in a ship of fantasme / and said to them / fro
whens come ye / and whyder goo ye / And the Christian men said / we come fro
Nychomedye / and goo unto Constantinople / And he said / ye err / goo / toward
the lift side / And ye shall sail more right / And he said so by cause he
would have drowned them in the Sea / And as they followed the sterres / anon
suddenly Adryan appeared to them in a boat / and ^ad them sail / as they did
before / And told to them / that it was a wicked spyryte that had spoken to
them / and then he went to fore them and showed them the way / And when
Natalye saw him go to fore them / she was replenysshed with joy / so that to
fore day they came to Constantynople / And when Natalye entered in to the hows
where the martirs were / she put the hond of Adryan to the body / And when she
had made her prayers / she slepte / and saint Adryan appeared to her / and
salewed her / And commanded her / that she should come with him in to Joy
perdurable / And when she awoke / she told to them that were there her vysyon
and took her leave / and after gaf up her spyryte to almighty god / And then
the good Christian men took her body / and leyd it with the bodies of the martirs

Thus ends the life of saint Adryan martyr
Here follows the life of saint Gorgone
Saint Gorgone and Dorothe were in Nychomedye chyef in the palace of Dyoclysyan
/ and renounced their Chyualrye for to follow their everlasting king / And
confessyd with an high voys / that they were Christian / and when the emperor
herd that he was strongly angry and it did him much displesyr / and greuaunce
for to lose such men / which he had nourysshed in his palace / and were noble
of manner / and of lygnage

And when he saw / that he might not turn them by menaces ne by fair words
/ he did do strain and pain them in the torment of Eculee / and did all to
rende and break them with scorgys and hokes of iron / and to cast in their
womdes salt and vynegre / which entryd in to their entraylles / And they
suffryd hit Ioyously / Then he made them to be roasted upon a gredey^on / And
they lay thereupon / as they had ^yn upon a bed full of flowers / and suffered
none harm / And after this the emperor commanded / that they should be hanged
with cords / And their bodies to be given to hounds and woluys to be devoured
/ And so ^hey yield up their spirytes to almighty god / but their bodies abode
vntouchyd / and were taken up and buried by good christian men / and they suffered
death the year of our lord two honderd / and four score / Then many years
after the body of saint gorgon was transported to Rome / And the year of our
lord vijClxxiiij / the bishop of Mets neuewe of king pyppyn transported the
same body in to France / And leyd it honorably in the Monasterye of
Gorgoryence /

Thus ends the lif of saint Gorgone martyr
And here begynnen the lives of the saints Prothe and Iacincte and Eugenne And
first of their names
PRothus is said of prothos / that is to say first / And of panthos which is
as much to say as presentacion / For he was of the first of his lygnage
presented to god by good works / and by martyrdom Iacynctus is as much to
say as lyeng within or a precious stone / named Iacyncte / For he played in the
tormentis / And therefore he is in Joy above / as a precious Iacyncte / Eugenne
is said / of ^u / which is as much to say as good / and Gigns gignis / that
is to engendre / And so Eugenne is as much to say / as well engendrynge / For
she engendryd to Ihesu Christ good ^gnage / That was fader and mother / and many
other / which by her were engendryd to the Christian faith /

Of saint Prothe and Iacincte
PRothe and Iacincte were gentylmen of noble lygnage / and were felawes in the
study of philosophy^ of Eugenne daughter of Phylyp / of the most noble
lygnage of the Romans / which Phelyp had taken of the Senate the prouostye
of Allexandrye / And had ladde with him Claudia his wife / his sons Auyte and
serge / and his daughter eugenne / And Eugenne was parfighte in all the
lyberalle arts and lettres / Prothe and Iacyncte had studied with her / and
were comen to parfec^^on of those scyences / And Eugenne in the xv year of her
age was required to be married of one Aquylyne / sone of the Consul Aquylyn /
And she answered / that her behooved to be married and chose a husbond full of
good manner / and not of hyhe lygnage / And then came to her hond the doctrine
of saint Powle / And began in her courage to be made Christian by good manners /
And then at that time the Christian men were well suffryd to dwell beside the
Cite of Alexandrye / And as she went playenge and walking by the Town / she
herd Christian men sing a Verse of the sawter which says / All the gods of
the my screauntes ben deuyls / Our lord certainly made the heaven / Then said
she to Prothe and Iacynte that had estudyed with her in the ^artes lyberal / We
have over passed thargumentes / and sylogysmes of the philosophres by estudye
corruptyble / the Arguments of Arystotl^ / And yders of plato / and
thensignementes of socrates / and shortly all that the poet sa^ge and made /
or the philosopher thought it is al closyd by his sentence / late us then be
brethren / and follow we our lord Ihesu crist / and this cou^ceil plesid them
and then she took thabyte of a man / and came to the monastery where elleyn
was abbot / which would in no wise suffer / that any woman should come to him /
and this elleyn had on a time disputed against an heresye / and when that he
saw that / he might not sustene the force of thargumentes / he did do brenne a
great fire for to preue his faith / and said / we shall see now which is the
right says / and he him self entered first in to the fire / and came out ageyn
without hurt or gryef / but the heretyk would not enter in to the fire / and
was co^fused / and put awey / and when Eugenne was gone to him / and had said /
that she was a man / he said to her / thou say truly / and well / yt thou art
a man / for thou werkest virtuously / and the condition of her was showed to
him then of god / and she received thabyte with Prothus and Iacincte / and
did her to be callid of al / brother Eugenne / and when her fader and mother saw
her chare come home empty and void / then they did do seek their douter
oueral but she myt not be fou^den / and then went they to dyuynours and
sothsayers / and demanded them where their douter was become / and they
ansuerd / that she was rauysshed of the gods among the sterres and therefore
her fader made an image of his douter and coma^ded that all the people should
worshipe her / and she duellid among the company of brethren in the dread of
god / and when the provost of the church was deed / she was made provost / and
then in Alexandrye was a lady noble and rich / which was named Melancye /
whom saint Eugenne enoynted / with oylle / and delyuerd her of a quartayne in
the name of god / and she sent to her many yeftes / which she would not receive
/ and the said lady supposed that eugenne had been a man / and visited her often /
and beheld the gretenes and beaulte of her body / in such wise / that she was
strongly esprysed and chauffed in her love / and was gretely troubled how she
might do to make eugenne to have to do with her / and then she feigned her to
be seek / and sent for this brother eugenne to come and have pity on her / and
when she was come she told to her in what manner she was taken in his love /
and how she brenned in desyryng him / and praid her / that she would lie by her
/ and have to do carnally / and embraced her / and kyssed her / and exhorted
her for to do sin / and eugenne had great horror and abhomynacion of her /
and said thou art by right called me lancye / for hit is an evil name and
fulfilled of trayson / thou art said black and derke douter of derkenes /
friend of the devil / lyt of pollucion / nourisshyng of lechery / anguissh^us
/ douter of sempyternal death / and when she saw her deceived of that she
coueited she doubted that eugenne should discouere her felonnye / and began
first to cry that eugenne would ^^er have enforced her / and then she went
to the provost phelyp / and complained saying yt a young man a falls christian was
come to me by cause of me dycyne / and took me and would have enforced me by
strength for to have sinned with him / if I had not be helped and delyuerd by
a chamberere which was in my chamber / and when the provost herd this he was
gretely meuid and sent for a multitude of people / and made eugene to be brought
with the other servants of Ihesu crist bounden in iron / and establisshed a
day when they al should be delyuerd to beestes for to be devoured / and then
were they called to fore the provost / which said to eugene / say to me thou
ryt cursyd wretch / if your god has taught you to do such works / as for
to corrumpe and defowle the wymmen forcibly against their will / and then
Eugenne / which had the head enclyned / by cause she would not be known / said
that our lord taught and enseygned chastyte entyerly / and promised to them /
that kept hit the life perdurable / And we may well show / that Melancye is false and lies / But hit is better to us to suffer / than she should be
vaynquysshed and pugnysshed / And that the fruit of our pacyence perysshe not /
but notwithstondyng let her cha^berere be brought forth here / She is the
wytnes of our felonye / so that the lesynges of her may be repreuyd / And when
she was come / she being learned of her lady opposed against euge^ne / and said
/ that he would have taken her by force / And also all the other of the meyne
corrupt by the lady wytnessyd that it was so / And Euge^ne said / the time is
passed of scylence / and the time to speak is now / I will no longer suffer /
that this shameless creature / put more blame gyltles on the servant of Ihesu
christ / ne that she gloryfye not in her malice / ne in her falsete And by
cause that truth surmounteth her lesynge / and that wisdom surmounteth her
malice / I shall show the truth for none advantage / but for the glory of
our lord / And then she took her cote / and rent it unto her gyrdel above /
and said / that she was a woman / as it apperyd / And also said to the provost
/ thou art my fader / and Claudyenne is my mother / And the tweyne that sytte
with the Auyce / and Serge ben my brethren / And I am Eugenne thy daughter /
And these tweyne ben Prothus / and Iacyncte / And when the fader herd that /
he knew well his daughter / And then he and her mother embraced her / and
wept tendyrly for joy / And then they clothed Eugenne / with clothes of
gold / and enhaunced her on hyhe / And after this came a fire from heaven / and
burnt Melancye / and all her meyne / Then Eugenne conuertid to the faith /
her fader / mother / brethren / and all the meyne / and therefore left the
fader the prouostye / And was ordained Bishop of the Christian people / And as he
was in prayer / and oryson he was slain of the myscreau^tes / and paynyms /
Then Claudyenne with her sons and Eugenne returned to Rome / and there
couertid much peuple unto the faith of Ihesu Christ / Then by the
commandment of the emperor there was a great stone bounden to the neck of
Eugenne / and was thrown in to tyber / but the stone brake / and she went
without harm upon the water / Then she was thrown in to a brennynge
fornays / but the fornays was quenchyd by miracle / and bycam cold / And then
she was put in to a derke prison / but a great shynynge light made it all
clear and light / And when she had been there ten days without mete our
lord Ihesu Christ apperyd to her / and brought to her a right white loof / and
said to her / take this mete of my hand / I am thy savior / whom thou have
loved with all thy thought / And on that day that I descended in to therthe I
shall receive the / Then on the day of the Natyuyte of our lord / the
tormentour was sent to her / and he smote of her head / And after that she
appeared to her mother / and said to her that she should follow her on the sunday
after / And when the sunday came / claudyenne put her self to prayer / and gaf
her spyryte to god / and then Prothus and Iacyncte were drawn to the temple
/ for to do sacryfyse / and they by their prayers al to brake thidolle / and
when they would in no wise do sacryfyse they acco^plysshed their martirdom in
suffrynge their hedes to be smyto^ of / and suffered death under Valeryen and
galyen / about the year of our lord ijC and lvij / by whose merytes late us
pray almighty god to have mercy on us / and bring us to his bliss Amen /

Thus enden the lives of Prothe and Iacincte
Here follows the Exaltacion of the holy Cross
TExaltacion of the holy Cross is said / by cause that on this day the holy cross and faith were gretely enhau^ced / And it is to be vnderstonden / that
to fore the passion of our lord Ihesu crystel / the tree of the cross was a
tree of fylthe / For the crosses were made of vile trees / and of trees without
fruit / For all that was planted on the Mount of caluarye bare no fruit It
was a foul place / for hit was the place of the torment of theuys / it was
derke / for it was in a derke place and without any beauty / It was the tree of
death / for men were put there to death / It was also the tree of stenche / for
it was planted among the caroynes / and after the passion the Cross was much
enhaunced / For the vylte was transported in to preciousyte / Of the which the
blessed saint Andrewe says / O precious holy Cross god save the / his
bareynes was turned in to fruit / as it is said in the Cantyques / I shall
ascend up in to palm tree / et cetera / His ignobylyte or unworthiness was
turned in to sublymyte and heyght / The Cross that was tormente of theuys is
now born in the front of themperours / his derkenes is turned in to light and
clerenesse / whereof Crysostom says / the Cross and the wou^des shall be more
shynyng than the rays of the son at the Judgment / his death is converted in
to perdurabylyte of life / whereof it is said in the preface / that fro whens
that the death grew / From thens the life resourded / And the stenche is turned
in to swetenes / ca^ticoru^ / j This exaltacion of the holy cross is
solempnysed and hallowed solempnly of the church / For the faith is in hit
much enhaunced / For the year of our lord six honderd and xv / our lord
suffered his people much to be tormentyd by the cruelte of the paynyms / And
Cosdroe king of the Perceens subdued to his empire all the Royammes of the
world / And he came in to Jerusalem / and was aferd and adrad of the sepulcre of
our lord and returned / but he bare with him the part of the holy Cross /
that saint Helene had left there And then he would be worshipped of all the
people / as a god / and did do make a tour of gold and of silver where in
precious stones shone / and (...) therein the images of the son and (...) the moon and of the sterres / and (...) that by subtyle conduytes water to (...)
hid / and to come down in manner of rain / And in the last stage / he made
horses to draw charyottes round about like as they had meuyd the boure / and
made it to seem as it had thondre^ and delyuerd his Royamme to his sone / And
thus this cursyd man abode in this Temple / and did do set the Cross of our
lord by him / and commanded that he should be called god of all the people /
And as it is read in libro de mitra^^ officio The said Cosdroe resydent in his
trone as a fader / set the tree of the Cross on his right side instead of
the sone / and a cock on the lift side instead of the holy ghost / and
commanded / that he should be called fader / And then Heracle the emperor
assembled a greet host / and came for to fight with the son of Cosdroe by
the river of danubye / and then hit pleasyd to either prince / that ^che of
them should fight one ageyn^^e that other upon the bridge / and he that should
vaynquysshe and overcome his aduersarye should be prince of thempyre with^ute
hurtyng either of both hosts / and so hit was ordained and sworn / and that
who someuer should help his prince / should have forthwith his legs and arms
cut of / and to be plonged / and cast in to (...) River

And then Heracle commanded him all to god and to the holy cross with all
the devotion that he might And then they fought long / And at the last our
lord gaf the vyctory to Heracle / and subdued him to his empire / The host
that was contrary / and all the people of / Cosdroe obeyed them to the Christian
faith / and received the holy baptism / And Cosdroe knew not the end of
the battle / For he was adoured and worshipped of all the people as a god / so
that no man durst say nay to him / And then Heracle came to him / and fond
him sitting in his syege of gold / and said to him / For as much as after
the manner thou haste honored the Tree of the cross / if thou will receive
baptym and the faith of Ihesu Christ / I shall get it to the / and yet shall
thou hold thy crown and Royamme with little hostages / And I shall let the
have thy life / And if thou will not / I shall slay the with my swerd / and
shall smite of thine heed / And when he would not acorde not thereto / he did
anon do smite of his head / and commanded that he should be buried / by cause
he had be a king / And he fond with h(...) one his sone of the age of ten
year / whom he did do baptyse / and lift him fro the font / And left to
him the Royamme of his fader / And then did do break that Tower / And gaf
the silver to them of his hooste / and gaf the gold and precious stones for to
repair the chirches that the tyrant had destroyed / and took the holy cross / and brought it again to Jerusalem / And as he descended fro the mount
of Olyuete / and would have entryd by the gate / by which our savior went to
his passion on horsbacke aourned as a king / suddenly the stones of the yates
descended / and joined them to gyder in the gate like a wall and all the people
was abashed / and then the Aungel of our lord appyered upon the gate
holdyng the sign of the sign of the cross in his hand / and said / when
the king of heaven went to his passion by this gate / he was not arrayed like a
king / ne on horsbacke / but came humbly upon an ass / in showing thexample
of humylyte / Which he left to them that honor him And when this was said /
he departed and vanysshed aweye / Then the emperor took of his hosen and shone
himself in weeping / and despoylled him of all his clothes in to his sherte /
and took the cross of our lord / and bare it much humbly unto the yate / And
anon the hardness of the stones felt the celestyalle commandment / and
remeued anon / and opened and gaf entree unto them that entered / Then the
sweet odor that was felt that day when the holy Cross was taken fro the
Toure of Cosdroe / and was brought again to Iherusalem fro so far country /
and so great space of land returned in to Iherusalem in that moment / and
replenysshed it with all swetenes / Then the right devout king began to
say the praysynges of the Cross in this wise / O Crux splendidior / et cetera
/ O Cross more shynynge than all the sterres / honored of the world / right
holy / and much amyable to all men / which only were worthy to bear the
raunson of the world / Sweet tree / Sweet nails / Sweet iron / sweet spear
berynge the sweet burdens / Save thou this present company / that is this day
assembled in thy lawde and praysynges / And thus was the precious tree of the
Cross reestablysshed in his place / And thau^cyent miracles renewed / For a
deed man was raised to life / and four men taken which the palsy were cured and
heled / and lepres were made clean / and fyften blind received their syghte
ageyn / Deuylles were put out of men And much people / and many were delyuerd
of diverse sekenes and maladyes / Then the emperor did do repair the
Chirches / and gaf to them great yeftes / And after returned home to his Empire
/ And hit is said in the Chronicles / that this was done other wise / For they
say / that when Cosdroe had taken many Royammes / he took Iherusalem /
and Zacharye the patriarch / and bare awey the tree of the Cross / And as
Heracle would make pees with him / the king Cosdroe swear a great oath / that he
would never make pees with Christian men and Romans / if they renyed not him that
was crucyfyed / and adoured the son / And then Heracle / which was armed
with faith brought his hooste against him / and destroyed / and wasted the
Persyens with many batayls that he made to them / And made Cosdroe to flee unto
the Cite of thelyfonte / And at the last Cosdroe had the flyxe in his belly
/ And would therefore crown his sone king / which was named Mendasa / And
when Syroys his oldest sone herd hereof / he made alyaunce with Heracle / And
pursewed his fader with his noble people / and set him in bonds / And sustained
him with breed of trybulacion / and with water of anguysshe / And at last he
made to shote arowes at him by cause he would not bileue in god and so deyde /
and after this thing he sent to Heracle the patriarch the tree of the cross
and all the prisoners / And Heracle bare in to Jerusalem the precious tree of
the cross / And thus it is read in many Chronicles also / Sybyle says thus of
the tree of the cross / that the blessed tree of the cross was three times
with the paynyms / as it is said in thystorye trypertyte / O thryes blessed
tree / on which god was stratched This peradventure is said for the life of
Nature / of grace / and of glory / which came of the cross / At
Constantynople a Jew entryd in to the church of saint sophye / and considered
/ that he was there allone / and saw an image of Ihesu Criste / and took his
swerd and smote thymage in the throat / And anon the blood guysshed out /
and sprange in the face and on the heed of the Jew / And he then was aferd
and took thymage / and cast it in to a pytte / And anon fled awey / And it
happed that a Christian man met him / and saw him al blody / and said to him /
fro whens come thou / thou have slain sum man / And he said / I have not /
the christian man said verily thou have commysed sum homycyde / For thou art al
besprongen with the blood / And the Jew said / Verily the god of Christian men
is great / and the faith of him is ferme and approved in all things / I have
smyten no man / but I have smyten thymage of Ihesu Christ / and anon issued
blood of his throat / And then the Jew brought the Christian man to the pytte
/ And there they drew out that holy image / And yet is seen on this day the
wound in the throat of thymage / And the Jew anon bycam a good Christian man
and was baptized / In Syrye in the cite of baruth there was a christian man /
which had hired an hows / for a year / and he had set thymage of the crucifixe
by his bed to which he made daily his prayers and said his deuocions / and
at the years end he remeued and took an other hows / and forgate and left
thymage behind him / And it happed that a Jew hired that same hows / and on a
day he had another Jew one of his neybours to dinner / and as they were at mete
/ it happed him that was boden in lokyng on the wall to espy this image /
which was fyxed to the wall and began to grenne at it for despyte / and
against him / that had him / and also thretened and menaced him / by cause he
durst keep in his hows thymage of Ihesu of nazareth / and that other Jew swear
as much as he might / that he had never seen it / ne knew not that it was
there and then the Jew feigned as he had been peasyd / and aftir went strayt
to the prince of the Jews / and accused that Jew of that which he had seen
in his house / Then the Jews assembleden and came to the hows of him / and
saw thymage of Ihesu Christ / and they took that Jew and beat him / and did to
him many iniuryes / and cast him out half deed of their synagoge / and anon
they defowled thymage with their feet / and renewed in it all the torments of
the passion of our lord / and when they perced his side with the spear /
blood and water issued haboundauntly / in so much that they fy^led avessel /
which they set there under / And then the Jews were abashed and bare this
blood in to their synagoge and all the seek men and malades that were enoynted
there with / were anon guarysshed and made hool / and then the Jews told and
recounted all this thing by order to the bishop of the country / and all they
with one will received baptym in the faith of Ihesu Crist / and the bishop
putt this blood in ampulles of Crystalle and of glass for to be kept / and
then he called the Christian man that had left it in the hows / and inquired
of him / who had made so fair an image / and he said that Nychodemus had made
it / And when he deyde / he left it to gamalyel / And Gamalyel to Zach^e and
Zachee to Jacques / and Jacques to Simon / And had been thus in Jerusalem unto
the des^^uction of the Cite / And fro thennes hit was borne in to the Royamme
of Agryppe of Christian men / And fro thennes it was brought again in to my
Countreye / and it was left to me by my parents by ritful heritage / and this
was done in ye year of our lord seven honderd and fyfty / And then all the
Jews hallowed their synagogues in to chirches And thereof comes the customme
that Chirches ben hallowed / For to fore that time / the aulters were but
hallowed only / And for this miracle the church has ordained / that the fyfthe
kalendas of december / or as it is read in an other place / the fyfthe ydus of
Nouembre should be the memory of the passion of our lord / wherefore at Rome the
church is hallowed in thonoure of our savior where as is kept an am pulle
with the same blood / And there a solemn seste is kept and done and there is
proved the right great virtue of the cross unto the paynym^ and to the
mysbyleuyd men in all things /

And saint Gregory records in the thirdde book of his dyalogues / that
when Andrewe Bishop of the Cite of Fundane suffered an holy nonne to dwell
with him / the fend thenemy leganne temprynte in his heart the beaulte of her
/ in such wise / that he thought in his bed wicked and cursid things / And
on a day a Jew came to Rome / And when he saw / that the day failed / and
might find no lodging / he went that night / and a bode in the Temple of
Appolyn / And by cause he doubted of the sacrylege of the place / how be hit /
that he had no faith in the Cross / yet he markyd and garnysshed him with
the sign of the Cross / Then at mydnyght when he awoke / he saw a company
of euylle spyrytes / which went to fore one / like as he had sum auctoryte
of puyssaunce above the other by subjection / and then he saw him sytte in the
mids among the other / And began to inquire the causes and deeds of
eueryche of these euylle spyrytes / which obeyed him / And he would know /
what euylle eueryche had do / But Gregory passyth the manner of this vysyon /
by cause of shortness / But we find semblable in the life of faders / That as a
man entryd in a Temple of thydolles / he saw the deuylle sitting / and all
his meyny about him And one of these wicked spyrytes came / and adouryd him /
and he demanded of him / Fro whens come thou / And he said / I have been in
such a prouynce / and have moeued greet wars / and made many trybulacions
and have shed much blood / and am come to tell it to the / And Satan said
to him / in what time have thou done this / And he said in thyrtty days And
Satan said / why have thou be so long there aboutes / and said to them that
stood by him / goo ye and beat him / and all to lasshe him / Then came the
second and worshipped him / and said / Sire I have been in the sea / and have
moeued great wyndes and torments / and drowned many ships / and slain many
men / And Satan said how long have thou ben about this / and he said xxij
days / and Satan said have thou done no more in this time / and coma^ded that
he should be beten / and the third came / and said / I have been in a Cite and
have meuyd stryues and debate in a wedding / and have shed much blood / and
have slain the husbond / and am come to tell the / and satan axyd / in what
time have thou done this / and he said in ten days / and he said / have thou
done no more in that time / and coma^ded them that were about him to beat him
also / Then came the fourth and said / I have been in the wyldernes forty
year / and have labored about a Monk / and uneath at the last I have
thrown and made him fall in the sin of the flessh / and when satan herd
that / he aroos fro his sete / and kyssed him / and took his crown of his head
/ and set it on his head / and made him to sytte with him / and said / thou
have done a great thing / and have labored more / than all the other / and this
may be the manner of the vysyon / that saint gregorye leueth / when each had
said / one sterte up in the myddle of them all / and said he had meuyd
Andrewe ageynste the nonne / and had meuyd the fourth part of his flesh
against her in temptacion / and thereto / yt yesterday he drou so much his mind
on her / that in the hour of even song he gaf to her in Iapyng a buffe / and
seid pleynly yt she myt here it that he would sin with her / then the
master coma^ded him that he should perform yt he had begone / and for to make
him to sin he should have a singular vyctory and reward among all the other /
And then commanded he / that they should goo look who that was that lay in
the Temple / And they went / and looked / And anon they were ware / that he
was marked with the sign of the cross / And they being aferd escryed / and
said / Verily this is an empty vessel / alas / alas / he is marked / And with
this voys all the company of the wykked spyrytes vanysshed away / And then
the Jew al amoeuyd came to the bishop / and told to him a^l by order what was
happend / And when the bisshoppe herd this / he wept strongly / and made to
void all the wymmen out of his hows / And then he baptized the Jew / Saint
Gregory reherceth in his dyalogues that a nonne entryd in to a gardyne / and
saw a letuse / and coueyted that / and forgate to make the sign of the cross
/ and bote it glotonesly / And anon fylle douue / and was rauysshed of a
deuylle / And there came to her saint Equycyen / And the deuylle began to cry
and to say / what have I do / I satte upon a lettuse / and she came / and
bote me / and anon the deuylle issued out by the commandment of the holy
man of god / It is read in thystorye Scolastyke / that the paynyms had peynted
on a wall the arms of Serapis / And Theodosyen did do putt them out / and
made to be painted in the same place the sign of the Cross / And when the
paynyms and priests of thy dolles saw that / anon they did them to be
baptized / saying / that it was given them to understand of their olders /
that tho arms should endure till / that such a sign were made there / in
which were life / And they have a lettre / of which they use / yt they call
holy / a had a form that they said it exposed and signyfyed life perdurable /

Thus ends the exaltacion of the holy Cross
Here follows the life of saint Johan Crisostome
Johan Crisostome was of Antyoche / And was borne of noble kynrede / of whom
the life / the lygnage / the conversation / and the persecucion is more plainly
contained in thystorye trypertyte / when he had been in the study of
philosophye / he left hit / and yaf him self to the service of god / and was
made a priest / And for the love of chastyte / he was reputed old / For he
entendyd more to the brennynge love of god / than to vtteward debonayr^e / And
for the rightwysnes of his life / he intended most to the things to come / and
was demed proud of them / that knew him not / He was noble in techynge / he
was wise in expounynge / and right good in refraynyng of vain manners /
Archadyen and Honoryen reigned then in thempyre / And Damasce sat then in
the Sea of Rome / And when Crysostome was made Bishop of Constantynople / he
began to correct hastily the life of Clerks / And therefore all they were
moeued and styred to hate him / and eschewed him / as he had been a mad man
/ And spacke euylle of him / And by cause he would not bydde them to dyne / and
ete with him / Ne would not ete with them / they said / that he did hit by
cause he ete his mete so foul / And the other said / that hit was for the
excellence and noblesse of his metes / And the truth was / by cause / that
his stomach was often sore / and greuyd / Wherefore he eschewed the great dyners
and the festes / And the peuple louyd him much for the good Sermons / that he
made to them / and set little by that his enemies said. Then Crysostome
began to repreue sum of the barons / And therefore the envy was the more
against him / And yet he did other thing / that moeued yet more / For Eutrope
provost of thempyre / which had the dignyte of consul / would have auengyd him
on sum that fled to the church for socour / And studied that a law should be
ordained by the emperor / that none should flee to the church / And they that
had been therein to fore should be draw out / And a little while after / Eutrope
had trespaced to the emperor / and fled anon to the church / And when the
Bishop herd thereof / he came to him / which was hid under thaulter / And
made an Omelye against him / in the which he repreuyd him right sharply / And
therefore many were wroth / by cause he would do no mercy to that cursyd man And
yet he did no thing but chyde /

And when the emperor saw his will / he made Eutrope to be borne out of the
church / and did do smite of his heed / And he repreuyd sharply many men
for diverse causes / And therefore he was hateful to many / And Theophyle Bishop
of Alea^ndrye would have deposed Johan Crysostome / and would have set in his
syege ysydore / the priest / And therefore he sought dyly gently cause to depose
him / And the people that were fed merueylously with the doctrine of saint
Johan / defended him strongly / And Johan Crysostom constrained the priests to
live after the holy ordynaunces of holy church And said that they should not
use the honor of preesthode / For they despised the life of a priest / and would
not follow it / And Johan governed not only the Bisshopryche of Constantynople
/ but he ordained to other prouynces by auctoryte af the emperor such laws as
were much prouffytable / And then when he knew that yet the people
sacryfysed about the other prouynces to the deuylles / he sent thither Monks
and clerks / and made them destroy all the Temples of thydolles / In that
same time was a man which was made maystre of the chyualrye / and was named
Gannas / of the lygnage of Celysque barbaryen / which strongly was lift up /
and by study of tyranny was corrupt of theresye / Areyenne / And that same
gannas prayed the emperor / that he would give to him a church within the cite
for him and his to make in their prayers / And when the emperor had grant
him / he came to Johan Crysostome for to have a chirch / as was granted to him
by the emperor / but Johan which was strong in virtue / and all embraced in
the love of god said to the emperor / promise not ne give no such thing ne holy
thing unto dogs And dread the no thing of this barbaryn / but command /
that we both two be called to fore the / And take heed / what shall be said
between us both softely / For I shall so refrain him that he shall no more
dare demand such thing / And when the emperor herd this / he was glad / and
the next day he did do call that one and that other And as an orator
required for him / Johan said / the hows of god is open in every place to the /
where as no man is warned to adoure and pray / And he said I am of another
law Make request that I may have a temple for my self / For I have emprysed
many trauaylles for the common prouffyte of Rome / And therefore I ought not to
be warned of my peticyon / And Johan said to him thou have received many
rewards / which amounte more than thy pain / and have ben made master of
the knights / and clad with the ^ournementis of consul / and hit be houeth the
to consydere / what thou were late / and what thou art now / and thy rather
pouerte / And thy richesse now / and what clothing thou vsedest to fore / and
what array thou werest now And by cause that a little labor have given to the
so great rewards / be not now disagreable to him / that has so much
honored the / And by such manner words he stopped his mouth / and
constrained to be stylle / And (...) saint Johan governed nobly the Cite of
Ca^stantynople this same gannas coueyteth thempyre / And by cause he might do
no thing by day / he sent by night his barbaryns for to brenne the palace /
And then it was well showed how saint Johan kept the Cite / for a great
company of angels which had great bodies / and were armed apperyd to the
barbaryns / and chaced them awey anon / And when they had told to their lord
that which was happed / he merueyled strongly / For he knew well that the
hooste of the other knights were spread in other cytees / And then he sent
them the second time / and they were rechaced again by the vysyon of the
angels / And at the last he issued him self with them / and saw the miracle /
and fled / and supposod they had been knights that had by day time have been
within / and had watched by night / And then he went to Tharse with great
strength / and wasted / and destroyed all the Countreye / so that all the
people dredde the cruelte of the Barbaryns / And then the emperor commysed to
saint Johan the charge of his legacion / And he not remembrynge the enemytee
between them went forth Ioyously / And then Gannas which knew the truth
of him came to mete him on the way / for he knew well / that be came for pity /
and took him by the hond / and kyssed his mouth / and his eyes / and
commanded his sons / that they should kiss his holy knees / And he was of
such virtue and so holy / that he constreyned the most cruel men to dread
him / In this time when these things were done / and saint Johan flouryd in
Constantynople by doctrine / and was holden merueylous of al them of the sect
of tharryens / which then encre^ed gretely / And they had a church without
the Cite / And in the saterdaye and sunday they would sing within the yates by
night hympnes / and Anthems / And on the morn they would goo thorugh the cite
singing Anthems and issued by the yates / and entryd in to their church / and
cessyd not to do thus in despyte of Christian men / And song often this song /
where ben they that say one only to be three things by his virtue / And then
Johan doubted that by this song simple men might be deceived / And ordained
that the good Christian people should go by night with tapres / torches / and
la^ternes syngyng glorious ympnes of the church / that the euylle works of
the other might be destroyed / And the faith of the good men might be
affermed / And did do make crosses of gold and of silver / which were borne
with tapers bre^nyng / And then the sect of th^reyens embracid with envy
rebellyd unto the death / So that vryson on a night which was chamberlayne of
themperoure was smyten with a stone / who was ordained by saint Johan
crysostome for to goo with thympnes / and of the people were many slain on that
one party / and on that other / ^henne themperoure meuyd by these things /
deffended that tharryans should sing no more ympnes in common / And after this
holy man suffered great persecucion for ryghtwys^es and true doctrine / And
was exyled / and after repeled again / And yet after for envy he was exyled
again / And so after many a great labor / and noble doctrine he ended his
life being in exyle the xiiij day of september / And when he was passyd / a
strong hayle fylle in Constantynople upon the cite / and up on the subarbes /
which did much harm / And then all the people said / It was done by wrath
of ^od / for the wrongful exylyng and condempnyng of the holy man saint Johan
crysostome / and that was showed well by the death of themperesse his grettest
enemy which deyde the fourth day after the haylle / And when this noble
doctor of the church was passyd out of this world / the bisshops of the west
would in no wise commyne ne have a do with the bisshops of the eest / till that
the name of that holy man sa^nt Johan were set among the bisshops ^is
predecessors / And then Theodosyen a right good christian man sone of the
said emperor which h^lde the name and party of his grount sire did do
bring the holy relykes of this doctor in to the ryal cite with tapres and
lyghtes / Then Theodosyen did do put and burye (...) said body of saint
Johan crysostome in the church of saint Sophye in the month Ianyuer / And
all the people went to mete with it and acompanyed it with torchys and lyghtes
/ And then Theodosym worshipped deuoutely the holy reliques / and vysyted
often his sepulture prayenge the holy saint to pardone Archadyen his fader and
Eudoxia his mother / and to foryeue them / that they had done ignorau^tly
against him / And they were deed long to fore This emperor was of so great
debonayrte / that he iuged noman to death / that had offendyd him / And said
that his wy^le was to call the deed men to life again if he might / It seemed
that his Court was a monasterye / For therein were said contynuelly matyns and
lawdes / he read the books dyuyne / And his wife was called Eudochice / he had
also a daughter named Eudoxe / whom he gaf to wife to Valentynyen whom he made
emperor / And all these things ben wreton more plainly in thystorye
tripertite / And this holy man saint Johan Crysostome passed about the year
of our lord three honderd / four score / and ten /

Thus ends the life of saint Johan Crisostome
Here follows of saint Cornely the pope and martyr And first thexposicion of
his name And of saint Ciprian
COrnely is expowned / And is as much to say as entendynge in prayer / And
the guard in abiding things outrageous / Or Cornely is said of Cornu / which
is as much to say as strong / and of leos that is people / that is the
strength of people / Cypryan is said of Cyprye that is oynture / and Ana / that
is high / Then Cypryan is as much to say / as oynture of hyghte / For he
had oynture of the grace sovereign and of virtues / or Cipryan is said of
Cyprys / that is to say heaviness or heritage / For he had heaviness of his
sins / and heritage of the heavenly Joys /

Of saint Cornely and saint Ciprian
SAint Cornely succeeded to Fabyan in the papacye / And was sent in exyle of
decian Cezar / And his Clerks with him / And there received lettres of
comfort fro Ciprian Bishop of cartage / And at last he was brought again
from exyle / And presented to Dicyen / And when he saw him fast in the faith
he commanded / that he should be beten with plomettys of led / And that he
should be brought to the Temple of mars for to do sacryfyse or else to have his
head smyton of / And as he was led / a knight prayed him / that he would
return to his hows / by cause of saluste his wife / which had leyn seek five
year of the pallasye / And she was heled by his prayers / And one and twenty
knights with her byleuyd in god / and were al brought to the temple of Mars
by the commandment of decyen / And all they spytte against hit / and were
all martred with Cornely And they suffered death about the year of our lord /
ijC / and liij /

And Cypryan bishop of Cartage was present in the same cite / and was brought
to fore pattern the Consul / And when he couthe not torn him in no wise fro
the faith of christ / he sent him in exyle / And fro (...) he was called
again of Galeryen Consul / which came after pattern / And receyned martyrdom
by smytyng of his head / And when the sentence was given on him / he said /
graces and thankynges be given to god / And when he came to the place of his
martyrdom / he commanded his servants to give to him that should smite of
his heed xxv pyeces of gold / And then he took a lynen clothe / and bond
his eyes with his own hands / And thus be exceyued the crown of martyrdom /
the year of our lord / ijC and lvj /

Thus enden the lives of saint Cornely and Cipriane
Here follows the life of saint Eufemye And first of thynterpretacion of her
name
EUfemia is said of eu / that is good / and of femme / that is a woman / as who
says / a good woman / that is to wete / a profitable honest / and
delectable / For in this treble manner she is said good / She was prouffytable
to other by conuersacyon / Honest by ordinance of manners / And delectable to
god / Or Eufemye is said thus as swetenes of sown / Sweet sown is made in
three manners / that is to wete by voys / as in syngyng by touching / as in an
harp / and by blowynge / as in pypes / and organes / Thus was the blessed
Eufemye sweet sown to god in voys of predicacion in touching of good work /
and in blowynge of devotion

Of saint Eufemye
EUfemye was daughter of a Senator And saw Christian men in the time of
Dyoclesyan so sore tormentid and al to rent by diverse tormentys / she came to
the Judge / And confessyd her to be Christian / And she comforted by ensample the
courages of other men / and by her Constaunce / And when the Judge sl^we the
ceysten men / the one to fore another / And made other to be present / by cause
they should be aferd of that they saw the other so cruelly tormentyd / and
broken / And that they should sacryfyse for dread and fore / And when Eufemye
saw thus heaven to fore her the holy saints / she was the more constaunt by
the stedfastnes of the martirs / And said to the Judge / and said that she
suffryd wrong of him / Then the Judge was glad / wenynge / that she would
have consentyd to do sacryfyse / and when he demanded her / what wrong he
had done to her / she said to him For sithe / I am of noble sygnage / why
put thou to fore me the strangers / and unknown / and make them goo to
Christ to fore me / For hit were my playsyr to goo thither by martyrdom to fore
them / And the Judge said to her / I had supposed / that thou would have
returned in thy thought / and I was glad that thou had remembryd thy
noblesse / And then she was enclosed in the prison / And the day following
without bonds was brought to fore the Judge / And then she complained right
grievously / why ageynste the laws of themperours she was allone spared for to
be out of bonds / And then she was long beten with fystes / and after sent
apene to prison / And the Judge followed her / and would have taken her by force
for to have accomplysshed his foul lust / but she deffended her forcybly /
and the virtue dyuyne made the hondes of the Judge to be came / And then the
Judge wend to have hen enchaunted / and sent to her the provost of his hows
for to promise to her many things for to make her consent to him / bu^ he
might never opene the prison / which was shytte / neither with keye ne with
axes / tylle he was rauysshed with a deuylle cryenge and tretynge him self /
that uneath he escaped / And then she was drawn out / and set upon a
whele full of brennynge coals / And thartilloure that was master of the
tormentys had given a token to them to torn it that when he should make a sown
/ that they all should turn it / And the fire should spring out / and all to
break and rende the body of the vyrgyne / but by thordynaunce of god the iron
that the artillour and master had in his hand fylle to the earth / and made
the sown / And they turned hastily / so that the whele burnt the master of
the work / and kept Eufemye without hurt syttyng upon the whele / And the
pare^tes of thartyllour wept / and put the fire under the whele / and would
have brent Eufemye with the whele / but the whele was brent and Eufemye was
vnbounden by the aungel of god / and was seen stand all hoole unhurt in an
hyhe place / And then Apulyen said to the Judge / the virtue of Christian peuple
may not be ouercomen / but by iron / therefore I counceylle the to do smite of
her head / Then they set up laddres / and as one would have set hond on
her / he was anon smeton with a palasye / and was borne thens half deed / And
another named softnes went up on hyhe but anon he was changed in his courage
/ and repentyd him / and required her humbly pardon / And when he had his
swerd drawn / he cried to the Judge / that he had lever slay him self / than
touch her whom the angels deffended / At the last when she was taken thens
/ the Judge said to his chau^celler that he should send to her all the young
men that were Ioly for tenforce / and to make her do their will till she should
fail and deye / And then he entryd in / and saw with her many fair vyrgyns
prayenge with her / And she made him to be crystend with her admonestementes /
And then the Judge did do take the vyrgyne by the here / and henge her thereby
/ And she ever abode Constaunt and vnmeuable And then he did do shytte her
in prison without mete seven days / and pressyd her there between four
greet stones / as who should press olyues / but she was every day fed with
an Angel / And when she was between those two hard stones / she made her
prayers / And the stones were conuertid in to right soft ashes / Then the
Judge was ashamed for to be vaynquysshed of a maid / And then he made her to
be thrown in to a pytte / where as cruel bestes were / which devoured every

Thus ends the life of saint Eufemye
Here begins the life of saint Lambert And first of thynterpretacion of his
name
LAmbert is said of lampos in greek / which is as much to say as brennyng /
And of thus / that is encence / That is to say encence brennynge to god / Or
he may be said of lampas a lamp / which gives light in the church / he was
encence brennynge to god by distress of conscience / and for to keep obedyence
/ And he was light in the church by noble predicacion / and by ensample of
good operacion /

Of saint Lambert
TAmbert was of a noble lygnage / but he was more noble by holiness / And was
informed in lettrure in his first age / so for his holiness he was louyd of
all the people in such wise that after his master The obarde he deseruyd to be
promoted to be bishop of Trecht / whom Chylderik king of France loved much
/ And had him alweye dear before other bisshops / But when the malice of the
Jews grew / the felons put him out of his honor without cause / and set
Ferramund in his chayer / And lambert entryd in to a monasterye / and was there
/ and conuersyd seven year goodly / On a night when he aroos fro prayer / he
^^te wind goo behind by ignorance / And when thabbott herd it / he said /
he that has done that late him go out to the cross barefote And anon
Lamberte went out to the cross barfote in his hair / and was there / and
went in the snow / and in the froste when the brethren chauffed them after
matynes / And the abbot demanded / where Lamberte was / And a brother said /
that he was gone to the cross by his commandment / he did do call him /
And then the abbot and his Monks required him to pardone them / but he not
only pardonned them / but also preached to them the virtue of pacyence / And
after vij year Ferramond was putt out / And saint Lambert was brought again
by the commandment of pepyn to his first see / And there he shone by word
and / by ensample in all virtue / Then two wicked men adressyd them against
him / and began to rebuke / and blame him strongly / And the friends of the
same bishop slew them In that time Lambert began to blame strongly pypyn
for a common woman that he held / And Dodo a Cosyn of them / that had be slain
/ and brother of the same cemyn woman / and offycer of the kings halle /
assemblyd a great felaushippe / and assyeged al about the bisshops place / And
would avenge the death of his Cosyns on saint Lambert / And when a child came
to saint Lambert / which was in his prayers / and told him thereof / he
trusting well in our lord / thought / he should well vaynquysshe them / And
took a sword / And when he had remembryd him self / he threw aweys his
sword / And Iuged him self better to vaynquysshe in suffrynge of death than to
leye his holy hands in the blood of the felons / And this holy man warned
his people / that they should confess their sins and suffer pacyently death /
And anon the felons came upon them / and slew forthwith saint Lambert / whom
they fond in oryson and prayer / And when they were gone / sum of his men /
that escaped bare the body to the cathedralle church secretly by water in a boat / And buried hit with great heaviness of them of the Cite in the year of
our lord four honderd and ten /

Thus ends the life of saint Lambert
Here begins the life of saint Mathewe / And first of the Interpretacion of
his name
MAthewe was named by tweyn names / that was Mathewe and Leuy / Mathewe is
expowned an hasty yefte / or a gyuer of counceylle / Or it is said Mathewe of
magnus / and theos that is god / as it were a greet god / or of manus that is
an hand / and theos that is god / as it were the hond of god / he was a yefte
of hastynes by hasty conversion / a yeuer of counceylle by wholesome predicacion
/ great to God / by perfection of life / And the hand of god by writing of the
gospelle of god / Leuy is interpred assumpte / or applied / or put to / or
set / he was assumpte and taken awey fro gaderyng of tolles / he was applied
to the nombre of thappostles / he was put to the company of theuangelystes
and set to the Cathaloge of martirs /

Of saint Mathewe
MAthewe thappostel prechynge in Ethyope in the cite that is said Vadaber /
Fond there two enchaunteurs named Zawes and Arphaxat / which enchaunted the
men by their Art / so that whom that they would should seem that they were
pryued of the health / and office of their members which were so eleuate in
pride / that they made them to be honored as gods Then Mathewe thappostle
entrid in to that Cite / and was lodged with the ennuche of candace the queen
whom phelyx baptized / Then he discouerd the faytes and deeds of
thenchaunteurs in this maner^ / that all that they did to men in to hurt /
that turned mathewe in to health / Then this eu^uche demanded of saint
Mathewe / how he and understood so many tongues / and then Mathewe told him /
how the holy ghoost descended / and had given to thappostles all science of
tongues / That like as they had emprysed by their pride to make the Toure unto
heaven / which cessed by confusyon of tongues / that were changed / all in
like wise the appostles made a toure of scyences of tongues / and nothing of
stones but of virtues / by the which all that believe shall mount up in to
heaven / Then came before them a man that said / that thenchauntours were comen
with two dragons / which cast fire and sulpher by their mouths / and
nosethrellys / and slew all the men / Then the Appostle garnysshed him with
the sign of the Cross / and went out surely to them / And anon as these
dragons saw him / anon they came and slept at his feet / Then said Mathewe
to thenchauntours / where is your craft awake ye them if ye may / And if I
would pray our lord / that which ye would have commysed in me / I should soon
execute on you And when the peuple were assembled / he commanded the dragons
/ that they should depart without hurtynge of any / And they went anon / And
thappostle there made a great sermon of the glory of paradys terrestre /
saying that it apperyd above all the Montayns / and was nyghe unto heaven / And
that there were neither thorns ne roches / And that the lylyes and Roses
flourysshed alwey / and waxyd never old / but the people were there alweye
young / And the sown of angels souned there alweye / and the birds came anon
as they were called / And said that out of this paradys was a man cast / but
he was called to the paradys of heaven by the natyuyte of our lord / And as he
said these words to the peuple / anon a great noise aroos / and a great
weeping was made for the sone of the king / which was deed / and when these
enchaunteurs might not reyse him / they made the king believe that he was
rauysshed in to the company of the gods / And that he should make to him a
Temple / and an image / And then the foresaid Ennuche kepar of the queen of
Candace / Made thenchaunteurs to be kept / and sent for thappostle / And
when the Appostle was comen / he made his prayer / and raised the kings sone
anon And then the king which was named Egyppe / sent for all the men in
his prouynces / saying to them / Come and see ye god in the lykenes of a man /
And then the people came with crowns of gold / and diverse manner of
sacryfyses / and would have sacryfyed to him / And then saint Mathewe beheld
them / and said / what do ye men I am not god / but I am servant of our lord
/ And by the commandment of him / they made a great church of the gold and
silver that they had brout which in thyrtty days space was edyfyed and
achyeued / in which Church the Appostle sat three and thyrtty year / And
conuertyd al Ethyope to the faith of Christ / And then the king Egesyppe
with his wife and his douter / and all the people were baptized / And then
thappostle ha^owed to god Ephygene the kings daughter / and made her
maystresse and gouernesse of moo than two honderd Vyrgyns / And after this
Hyrtake succeeded to the king / and coueyted the said vyrgyne Ephygene / and
promised to the Appostle half his Royamme if he would make her consent to be
his wife / and thappostle said to him / that after the customme of his
predecessor / he should come on the sunday to the church / And Ephygene being
present with the other virgyns he should here what he should say of the goodness
and laufull marriage / And then departed with great joy / and supposed / that
he would have styred Ephygene to his marriage / And when the vyrgynes and all
the people were assembled / he spack long of good and lawful matrymonye / and
was much allowed of the king / which supposed that he had said for to have
joined the vyrgyne to him / for to consent the marriage / Then scylence was
made / he made rehersaylle of his sermon saying / that marriage is good / if
it be truly hold by good alyau^ce / but ye that ^en here / know ye well that
if any servant would take the wife of a king wedded he should not only run to
the offense of the king / but above that he should deserve death / and not for
to wedde her / but for that he in so taking the spouse of his lord should
corrumpe the marriage joined / And thus the king that knew that Ephygene is
made the spouse of the king perdurable / and is sacred with the holy veil /
how may thou take the wife of a more puyssaunt king / and couple her to the
by marriage / And when the king herd this / he began tenrage / and departed
al wode and frantyke / And thappostle without dread and constant confermed
all the other to pacyence / And Ephygene lyenge before him for dread he
blessed / and all the other vyrgyns also / And after the solempnytees of the
mass / the king sent a tormentour / which slew mathewe with a swerd behind
him / which was standing by the altar holding up his hands in to heaven /
And so was consecrate a martyr / And then all the peuple would have gone to
the palace for to have slain the king / And with great pain were they holden
of the priests and dekens / and halowden with great joy the martyrdom of the
appostle / And the king then sent to Ephygene matrones and enchaunteresses
/ but for all them when he saw that he might not torn her courage / ne draw
her to him in no manner / he enuyronned and bysette the hows of her with a
right great fire / for to brenne her / and all the other virgynes / And then
the holy appostle appyered at the fire / and put out the fire about the hows
/ and hit took the palace of the king / so that it burnt and consumed all
that was therein / that none escaped sauf the king / and his sone only / And
the sone was rauysshed of the deuylle / and began to cry and confess his
faders sins / and went to the sepulcre of thappostle / And the fader was
made a foul meselle / And when he saw that he might not be cured / he slew
him self with his own hand with a swerd / And the people then establysshed
for to be king the brother of Ephygene / whom thappostle had de baptized and
reigned lxx year / and establysshed his sone for to be king after him / And
encrecyd much thonour of christian men and replenysshed al Ethyope with noble
chirches of our lord / And then Zaroes and Arphaxat fled in to perse fro the
day that thappostle raised the sone of the king / but saint Simon and Jude
vaynquysshed them there / And know ye that four things ben pryncipally
considered in the blessed saint Mathewe / the first is the hastynes of
obedyence / for as soon as our lord called him / he left al / and doubted
nothing the lords / and left the rekenynges of his receytes imparfyght / And
joined him parfyghtly to our lord Ihesu crist And for this hasty obedyence /
sum took occasion of error in them self / lake as saint Iherome records in
thorygynal upon the foresaid place / saying in that place / Porphyrye and
Iulyan Auguste repreueth in the same place the folly of the story lyeng saying
that as the story says / like as they followed suddenly the savior / that they
would as hastily follow another man that had called them / For there were showed
so many virtues / and so many tokens tofore / that thappostles of our lerd
byleuyd verily without doubt / And certeynly this resplendyssheur of the
preuy mageste shone in his blessid fa^e at the first to them that saw him And
he might by that syghte and will draw them to him / if such virtue as men
say is in a precious stone / which is named Magnete / which draws to him
festues and strawes / how much more the creator of all thing may draw to
him whom he will / This said Iherome. The second is his largess or his
lyberalyte / For anon he made to him a great feste in his hows / the which
was not gree^e by apparaylle of metes / but hit was much great only by reason
of great desire / For he received with right great will / and right great
desire / And also it was great by reason of seruys For this feste was
demonstraunce of great mysterye / which mysterye the gl^se expowneth upon saint
Luc saying he that received our lord Ihesu Christ in his hows was fed
withinforth plentyuously of gretter things / than the other / that is to wete
of del^ctacions / of good manners / and of good delytes / And after he was
greet by reason of his enseygnementis / For he showed great techynges and
doctrynes And this was of great mercy by desire / and not by sacrifise / as he
said Misericordiam volo et non sacrificium / etcetera / And also they that been
hoole / need no leche / and so it was great / for there was Ihesu Criste and
his disciples / The third is humylite / which appierid to him in two things /
first he showed him a publican / the other evangelists as says the gloss / by
cause of shame / and for the honor of theuangelist they set not their common
name / but as it is wreton / the Just is first accuser of him self / And
Mathewe named him self publican first / by cause / that he showed that none
conuertid ought not mystruste of health / like as he was made of a publican an
Appostle and evangelist /

Secondly / by cause he was pacyent in his iniuryes / For when the Phariseis
murmured that Ihesu crist was descended to a man synnar / Mathewe might have
answered / ye ben more wicked and more synful that wene ye be Just / and
reffuse the leche / for I may no more be said synnar / that am gone to the
leche of health / and hyde not my sin / ne wound / The fourth is the great
solempnyte of him in the Church of his Gospellys / his gospellis ben often and
more used in the church / than the other euangelystes / like as the psalms of
dauyd / and thepystles of powle ben reherced before other scriptures / which
ben more ofter recited in the church / And this is the reason / that James
witnessith that there ben three manner of sins that is to wete / the sin of
pride / of Lecherye / and of avarice / In the sin of pride sinned saulus /
for saul by the sin of pride persecuted the church over prowdly / Dauyd
sinned in the sin of lecherye / For he maade aduoultrye / And for
thaduoultrye (...) slew vrias his true knight / And Mathewe sinned in the
sin of ^uarice / for for coueitous he meddled him of vylaynous gayn / For he
was in a port of the sea / where he received the toll and customme of ships
and marchaundises / and how be it that they were sinners / yet alweye our lord
took their penance in gree / and was plesid there with / so that he pardonned
them not only their sins / but multyplyed in them his yeftes of grace / For
him that was a right cruel persecutour / he made a right true prechour / And
him that had be auoulterer and homycide he made a prophet / And him that
coueyted so vylaynous gain / he made appostle and evangelist / And therefore
these foresaid three ben often recited / that no man that would be conuertid should
have despair of pardon / when such that were in so great sin he beholds to
have been in so great grace / And it is to be considered / that after saint
Ambrose sum things ought to be noted in the conversion of saint Mathewe /
That is to wete / somewhat of the party of the leche / And sum of the party
of the seek to be helyd / In the leche were three things / that is to wete /
wisdom / by which he knew the Rote of the maladye / And the bounte / by
which he mynystred the medycyne / And the power / by which he helyd him so
soon / Of these three says saint Ambrose in the person of the said Mathewe /
This Master may take aweye the sorrow fro my heart / And the dread of the
soul / which knows the things hid and preuy / And this is as touching to
the first / And as to the second / I have founden a leche / that dwellyth in
heaven / and shedeth in erth^ his medycyne / And as to the thyrdde / he said /
he may well hele my wonndes / that knows not his own / In this blessid
seek man / that was helyd / that is to say / saint mathewe / three things ben
to be considered after Saint Ambrose / He took away first his maladye / He was
always agreeable to his leche / And he was alweye clean and hoole / after he
had received his health / Then he said / Mathewe follow now thy leche
meryly and gladly / and he ioyeng said / now I am no publycan / ne am not leuy
/ I have put awey leuy / sithe I have received Christ and follow him and this is
to the first / And as to the second I hate my lygnage / and flee my life / and
follow only the lord

And as to the thyrdde he said / who shall depart me fro the charity of our
lord / god which is in me / Trybulacion or anguysshe / or hongre / as who
says / nothing / And the manner of helynge as Ambrose says was treble / First
Ihesu Christ bond him with bonds / Secondly / he Impressyd in him charity /
And thyrdely he clensyd him from al rotynes / And Ambrose says in the person
of Mathewe / I am bounden with the nails of faith and good life of charity /
Secondly / I shall keep thy commandment as emprynted in me by charity / And
as to the thyrdde Good lord come soon / and opene my wounds / lest any
noyeful humor corrupt ne rote the hyd passions / and wasshe them that been
foul and cleanse / them / his gospel / that he had wreton with his own hand
was fou^den with the bones of saint Bernabe / the which gospellys barnabe bare
with him / And leyd them upon them that were seek / And anon they were heled
by the merytees of the martyr / and were founden in the year of our lord v / C
/

Thus ends the life of saint Mathewe thappostle and evangelist
Here follows the life of saint Maurice And first of his name
MAurice is said of mare that is bitter / and as / that is to say vomytyng
odor or hard / or of us that is to say / counseyllour or hasty / Or it is
said of Mauron which after ysydore in greek is said black / he had
bytternesse for his euylle ydolatrye / and dylacion of his Country / he was
vomytyng by couetyse of things superflue / hard and f^rme to suffer torments
/ Counseyllour by thadmonestement of knights / his felawes / hasty by ardeur /
and multyplyenge of good works / Black by despysynge him self / And the
blessed Euthere wrote and ordained his passion when he was Archebisshop of lion

Of saint Maurice or Moris
MOris or Maurice was duk of the right holy legyon of Thebans / They were
named Thebans of Thebes their cite / And that regyon is in the parties of the
eest beyond the parties of Arabye / And it is full of Rychesses / plentyuous
of fruit / delectable of trees / The Induellers of that regyon ben of great
bodies / and noble in arms / strong in bataylle / subtyle in engyne / and
right haboundaunt in wisdom / And this Cite had an honderd yates / of which
is said this verse Ecce vetus Thebea centum iacet obruta portis / that is to
say / the Town of Thebes with an honderd is now overthrown right strong /
To them James the brother of our lord preached the gospel of our lord /

In that time Dyoclesyan and Maxymyen Emperors would have utterly destroyed
the faith of our Lord Ihesu Christ / And sent such Epystles unto all the
Prouynces / where Christian men duellyd / if any thing behooved to be determined
or to be know^n / and all the world were assembled in that one party / and Rome
allone were of ye party al ye world should be a^ vaynouysshed and ouercomen /
And Rome only should abide in the hyenes of science / And wherefore then ye /
that be not but a little people and contrary to the commandment of her / and
reffuse so folyly the establysshements of that Cite of Rome / wherefore receive
ye the faith of the gods inmortal / or else sentence irreuocable of
dampnacion shall be pronounced against you And then the Christian people
received these lettres / and send again their messagers al void without
answer And then Dyoclosyan and Maxymyen were moeued by great Ire and wrath
sent unto all the prouynces / And commanded that they should come to Rome
ready in arms of battle for to discomfyte all the whelles of the empire of Rome
/ Then the lettres of themperours were sent and dyrected to the Thebans /
which people after the commandment of god they rendryd to god that was due to
him / and to the Cezar that was longyng to him Then assembled this chosen
legyon of knights / that is to wete six thousand six honderd lxvj knights /
and were sent to the emperor for to help in their Just and lauful bataylles /
and not to bear arms against Christian men but rather to deffende them / And
the noble man Mauryce was duk of this holy legyon / and they that governed
under him / which bare the baners were named saint Candidus / saint Innocent /
saint Exuperye / saint Vyctor / and saint Constancyen / all these were
capytaynes / Dyoclesyan then sent against the frensshmen Maxymyen / which
he had made felawe with him in thempyre / and delyuerd to him great strength
without nombre / and adjoined to him the legyon of Thebans And they had been
exhorted of marcelle the pope / that they should rather suffer death / than to
corrumpe the faith of Ihesu christ / And when this great host without nombre
had passed the montaynes / and came bynethe / The Emperor commanded that all
they that were with him / should saeryfyse to thydolles and on them that would
not / they that would not be ronnen on as rebels to be destroyed / and
specially on Christian men / And when the holy knights herd that they departed
fro the hooste eight mile fer / And took there a certain place delectable by
the River of Rhone / which was named Aganon / And when Maxymyen knew it / he
sent knights to them / and commanded that they should come hastily unto the
sacryfyces of the gods with the other / And they answered / that they might
not so do / by cause they held the feythe of Ihesu christ / And then
the emperor embraced with ire said / The iniurye celestyel is meddled with my
despyte / And the Relygyon Romayne is despised with me / Now shall that Contymax
knight feel / not only for me / but for tauenge my gods / Then Cezar
commanded his knights that they should goo / and constrayne them / to do
sacryfyse to the gods / or else they should slay alweye the tenthe man / Then
the holy saints stratched their hedes with Joy / and hasted that one to fore
that other to come to the death / And after saint Mauryce aroos up / and said
to his felawes among other things / Enjoy ye with us / and I thank you For we
ben al ready for to deye for the faith of Ihesu Crist / we have suffered our
felawes knights to be slain / And I have suffryd your felawes to suffer death
for Ihesu Christ / And I have kept the commanndement of god / which said to
Peter / putt thy swerd in to thy shethe / but now by cause that we be enclosyd
with the bodies of the knights our felawes / and have our clothes reed of
their blood / late us then follow them by martyrdom / And if it plese you
late us send this answer unto Cezar / We ben thy knights Sire Emperor /
and have taken arms to the deffence of the common well / In us is no traysonne
/ ne dreede / But in no whyse we will forsake the law / ne faith of Ihesu
Christ / And when the Emperor herd that / he commanded to byhede yet the
tenthe man of them And when that was done / one of the Bauerers / named
Exuperius / took the Banere / and stood among them / and said / Our glorious
duck Mauryce has spoken of the glory of our felawes knights / Ne think not
that I take arms for to resist such things / but let our right hondes cast
awey such flesshely arms / And late us arm us with virtues / And if it plese
you late us remaunde unto the emperor such words / we ben knights of thyn
empire / but we confess us to be servants of Ihesu crist we owe unto the
chyualrye / and to him Innocence / and of the we attend the reward of our
labor / And of him we have the beginning of life / And we ben ready to receive
for him / all torments / And we shall not depart fro his faith Then Cezar
commanded / that his host should enuyronne all that legyon of knights / so
that none should escape / Then were / enuyronned the knights of Ihesu Christ
with knights of the devil / that one of them should not escape / and were al to
hewn / and smyton of heedes and hondes / and trodden under the feet of the
horses / and were sacred martirs of Christ / And they suffered death in the year
of our lord ijC / and lxxx / Nevertheless there escaped sum by the will of our
lord / and came in to other Regyons / and preached the name of Ihesu criste / and
had in other places vyctory of martyrdom / And it is said / that Solutor / and
auentor and Octauus went unto Thauryne / And Alexander to byrgame / Second
unto vyn cemylye / And Victor Constancyen and vrsyn and other that escaped /
And when the Bouchyers divided the pray among them and ete to gydre / They
saw an old man named vyctor pass forth by / and they bad him come and ete
with them / and he began to demand them / how they might ete with joy
among so many men slain and deed and when that he had herd that they were
christian men / syghyng he waillyd gretely / and said / he had been well blessed
/ if he had be slain with them / And when they apperceyued that he was a
Christian man / they anon ran upon him / and slew him / After this Maxymyen
at Melane / and Dyoclesian at Nychomedye in one day forsook their purpre
clothing / and leyd hit down for to lead a more simple life / And that they
that were younger / as Constancyen / Maxymyen and Galeryen / whom they had
ordained Cezaryens should govern thempyre / And as Maxymyen would again regne
and command as a tyrant / he was pursewed of Constancyen his stepsone / and
fynysshed his life by hanging / And after this the holy body of Innocent one
of that legyon / which had been cast in the River of Rosne / was founden / and
by damycyan of genanence / And grato of Augustodonense and prothase of the same
bisshops in their church is honorably buried / and there was a paynym a werk
man that wrought to make the chirch with other / but he wrought not but on the
sondayes in the time when men sange / and made solempnyte of masses in the said
Church / and there came to him a company of saints which rauysshed him / and
(...) him and also repreuyd him by cause he wrought in masonrye / when other
did the dyuyne seruyse and office in the church / And then he so corrected
ran to the church to the bishop and required to be crystned / And Ambrose
says thus of these martirs in his preface / The company of these true
christian me^ enlumyned with dyuyne lyt coming fro the ferther ends of the world
/ which were armed with spyrytuel arms and hyed to their martyrdom with
stable feythe / and dylygent constau^ce / whom the cruel tyrant for to fere
them tythed two times by the slaughter of the swerd / And after he seeing them
constaunt in the faith commanded them all to have their heedes smyton of /
But they brenned in so great charity that they cast and threw awey their arms
and harnoys / and knelynge on their knees received suffrably with a Joyous
heart the swerdes of them that martryd them / among whom mauryce embraced in
the love and faith of Ihesu Christ received the crown of martyrdom / Hec
Ambrosius / There was a woman which delyuerd her sone to learn unto thabbotte
of the church / in which the holy saints lie Inn / And the sone deyde in
short time after / Wherefore the mother wept without remedy / Then saint
Mauryce appeared to her / and inquired why she wept so for her sone / And she
answered / that as long as she should live she should weep for him / And he said
to her / weep no more for him / as he were deed / For know thou for certain
he is with us / And if thou wylt preue it / arise to morn / and every day of
thy life and come to matynes / and thou shall here his voys among the monks
singing / And ever after during her life she came every day / and herd the
voys of her sone syngyng among the Monks / when the king guturanyche had
given all that he had to pour men / and to chirches / he sent a priest for to
fetch to him of the relykes of this holy company And as he returned with the
relykes the tempest aroos in the lake of losan / in such wise / that the
ship was in peril / he set the casse with the relikes ageynste the wawes
of the water / And anon the tempest seaced / And the wawes of the water were
appeasyd / It happed in the year of our lord nine honderd / and lxiij / that
some Monks by thaccorde of Charles had impetred and gotten of Nycholas the pope
the body of saint Urban pope and of saint Tyburce martyr / And retornynge they
vysyted the church of the holy martyrs / and impetred and gate of thabbot and
Monks / that they transported the body of saint Mauryce / and the head of
saint Innocent unto Ancerre / in to the church that saint germayne had dedyed
in the name of these martirs / and brought it thither /

Peter of Amyens reherceth that in burgoyne was a proud clerk and ambycious /
which had gotten a chirch of saint Mauryce / and usurped hit by force ageynste
a mighty knight / which was contrary / and against him And on a time was song
a mass in the end of the gospel / that they that enhaunce them shall be meked /
and they that meke them shall be enhaunced / This said Malerous and cursyd
clerk lawhed and said / that is false / For if I had humbled and meked my self /
I had not had this day so much rychesses / as I have in the church And
as soon as he had said that / anon came thondre and lyghtnynge fro heaven in
manner of a sword / and entryd in to his mouth out of which issued the
blasphemies / and anon he was extynct and deed suddenly / Then late us
deuoutely byseche Almighty god / that by the merytes of this holy martyr saint
Mauryce / and his holy felauship the legyon / which is six thousand / six
honderd / three score and six / that suffered martyrdom / as here to fore is
reherced / we may after this transytorye life come unto the everlasting bliss
in heaven / where he reigned world without end / Amen /

Thus ends the life of saint Maurice with his felawes
Here follows the life of saint Iustyne and first of her name
IUstina is said of justice / For by Justice she rendryd to eueryche that was
his / that is to wete / to god obedyence / unto her superior prelate /
reverence / To her like and semblable concord / To them / that were bynethe and
inferior disciplyne / To her enemies / pacyence / unto wretchis / and to them
in distress compassion and works of pity / and to her self holiness /

Of saint Iustyne
IUstyne the virgyne was of the Cite of Anthyoche daughter of a priest of
thydolles / And every day she sat at a wyndow by a priest which read the
gospel / of whom at the last she Was conuertid / And when the mother of her
had told hit unto her fader in his bed / Ihesu christ apperyd to them with his
angels saying / come to me / I shulle give to you the kingdom of heaven / And
when he awoke anon they did them to be baptized / with their daughter / And
this vyrgyne was strongly grieved and vexed of Cyprian / And at the last she
conuertid him / to the faith of Ihesu crist And Cyprian from his childhode had been an enchaunteur / For fro the time that he was seven year old / he was
consecrate by his parents to the deuylle And he used craft of nygromancye And
made wymmen to torn in to Iumentes and beestes / as them seemed and many other
things semblable / And he was coueytous of the love of Iustyne / and burnt in
the concupyscence of her / And resorted to his art magyke / that he might have
her for him self / or for a man named Acladye / Which also burnt in her love
/ Then he called a deuylle to him / to the end that he might by him have
Iustyne / And when the deuylle came / he said to him / why have thou called me
And Cypryan said to him / I love a vyrgyne / canste thou not so much / that I
may have my playsyr of her And the deuylle answered / I that might cast man
out of paradys / and procured that cayn slew his brother / and made the Jews
to slay christ / and have troubled the men / trowest thou I may not do that
thou have a maid with the / and use her at thy playsir Take this oynement /
and enoynte with all her hows without forth / And I shall come / and kyndle
her heart in thy love / that I shall compelle her to assente to the / And the
next night following the devil went / and enforcid him to meue her heart un to
unlawful love / And when she felt it she recommaunded her self deuoutely to
god / and garnyssled her with the sign of the Cross / And the Devil all
affrayed of the sign of the cross / fled away from her / and came again to
Cypryan / and stood before him And Cypryan saydeto him / why have thou not
brought to me this vyrgyne / And the devil said I see in her a sign / which
fered me / that all strength is failed in me / Then Cypryan left him / and
called another deuylle more stronger than he was / And he said / I have herd
thy commandment / and have seen the nonpower of him / but I shall amend it
and accomplysshe thy wysse / Then the deuylle went to her / and enforced to
meue her heart in love / And enflamme her courage in things not honest / And
she recommaunded her to god deuoutely / and put fro her that temptacion by the
sign of the Cross / and blewe on the devil / and threw him anon awey from
her / And he fled al confuse / and came to fore Cypryan / And Cypryan said to
him / where is the maid / that I sent the fore / And the deuylle said I
knouleche that I am ouercomen / and am rebouted / And I shall say how / For I
saw in her a sign horrible / and lost anon all my virtue / Then Cypryan
left him / and blamed him / and called the prince of the deuyls / And when he
was comen / he said / wherefore is your strength so little / which is overcome
of a maid / Then the prince said to him / I shall go and / vex her with
great Fevers / And I shall enflamme more ardently her heart / And I shall
arrouse / and bydewe her body with so ardau^t desire of the / yt she shall be
al frantyke / and I shall offer to her so many things / that I shall bring her
to the at mydnyght / Then the devil transfigured him self in the lykenes of
a maid / and came to this holy vyrgyn and said / I am comen to the for to live
with the in chastyte / and I pray the that thou say / what reward shall we
have for to keep us so / and the vyrgyn ansuerde / the reward is great / and
the labor is small / and the devil said to her what is ye then / ye god
coma^ded when he said / grow and multiplye and replenysshe therth Then fair
suster I doubt yt if we abybyde in virgynyte / yt we shall make the word of god
vayn and also despysynge and inobedie^t by which we shall fall in to a grievous
judgment where we shall have no hope of reward / but shall run in great
torment and pain / Then by thatysement of the deuylle / the heart of the
vyrgyne was smyten with evil thoughts / and was gretely enflammed in desire
of the sin of the flesh / so that she would have gone thereto / but then
the vyrgyne came again to her self / and considered who that it was / that
spack to her / And anon she blessed her with the sign of the Cross / and
blewe against the deuylle / and a none he vanysshed aweye / and malte like wax
/ and incontinent she was delyuerd from all temptacion / A little while after
the deuylle transfygured him in the lykenes of a fair young man / and entryd
in to her chamber and fond her allone in her bed / and without shame
sprange in to her bed and embraced her / and would have had a done with her
And when she saw this she knew well / that hit was a wicked spyryte / and
blessed her / as she had done to fore / and he malte away little wax / And
then by the suffraunce of god she was vexed with axesse and fevers / And the
devil sl^we many men and beestes / and made to be said by them that were
demonyakes / that a right great mortalyte should be thorugh al Anthyoche / but
if Iustyne would consent unto wedlok / and have Cypriane / wherefore all they
that were seek and languysshynge in maladyes lay at the yate of Iustynes fader
and friends cryenge / that they should marye her / and deliver / the cite of
that right great peril / Iustyne then would not consent in no wise And
therefore every body menaced her / And in the syxthe year of that mortalyte / she
prayed for them / And chaced / and droof thens that al pestylence / and when
the deuylle saw / that he prouffyted no thing / he transumed and transfygured
him in the form of Iustyne for to defowle the fame of Iustyne / and in
mocking Cypryan / He auaunced him / that he had brought to him Iustyne / And
came to him in likeness of her / and would have kyssed him / as if she had
languisshed for his love / And when Cypryan saw him and supposed that it had
be Iustyne / He was al replenysshed with Joy and said / thou art welcome
Iustyne the fairest of al wymmen / And anon as Cypryan named Iustyne / the
deuylle might not suffer the name / but as soon as he herd it / he vanysshed
awey as a fumee or smoke / And when Cypryan saw him deceived / he was al heavy
and sorouful / and was then more brennyng and desirous in the love of Iustyne
/ and woke long at the door of the virgyne / and as him seemed / he changed him
sometime in to a bird by his art magyke / and sometime in to a woman / but wha^
he came to the door of the vyrgyne / He was neither like woman ne bird / but
apperyd Cypryan as he was / Acladius by the deuyls craft / was anon turned in
to a sparow / and when he came to the wyndowe of Iustyne / as soon as the vyrgyn
beheld him / he was not a sparow / but showed him self as acladyen / and began
to have anguysshe and dread / for he myt neither flee ne lepe / and Iustyne
dredyng lest he should fall / and break him self / did do set a ladder / by
which he went down / warnyng him to seace of his woodenes / lest he should be
punysshed as a malefactoure by the law / then the deuylle being
vaynquysshed in all things returned to Cyprian / and held him all confused to
fore him / and Cyprian said to him / and hou art not thou ouercomen / what
unhappy is your virtue / that ye may not overcome a maid / have ye no might
over her / but she ouercometh you / and breketh you al to pyeces / Tell me I
pray the / in whom she has all this great myt and strength / and the devil
said / if thou wylt swear to me / that thou wylt not depart fro me ne forsake
me / I shall show to the her strength and her victory to whom ciprian said /
by what oath shall I swear / and the devil said / swear thou by my great
virtues yt thou shall never depart fro me / and ciprian said / I swear to the
/ by thy great virtues / yt I shall never depart from the / then the devil
said to him wenyng to be sure of him This maid makes ye sign of the cross /
and anon then we wexe feeble and lose al our myt and virtue / and flee from
her / / like as ^oaxe flees fro the face of fire / And Cyprian said then to
him / the Crucyfyed god / is than gretter than thou / And the deuylle said ye
certeynly he is gretter than al other And all them that we here deceive / ^e
Iugeth them to be tormentid with fire inextynguyble / and Cypriansaid then
ought I to be made friend of him that was crucyfyed / lest I fall herafter in
to such pains / To whom the deuylle said / Thou have sworn by the might
and virtues of my strengthes / the which no man may forswere that thou shall
never depart from me To whom Cyprian said / I despise the / and forsake the /
and all thy power / And renounce the / and all thy deuylles / and garnysshe
and mark me with the sign of the cross / And anon the deuylle departed al
confused / Then Cyprian went to the bishop / And when the bishop saw him
he wend that he were come to put the Christian men in error / And said / late
it suffyse unto the Ciprian them that be without forth / For thou may no
thing prevail against the church of god / For the virtue of Ihesu Christ is
joined thereto / and is not ouercomen / And Cyprian said / I am certain / that
the virtue of our lord Ihesu Crist is not ouercomen / And then he recounted
all that was happend / And did him to be baptized of him / And after he
prouffyted much / as well in science / as in life / And when the Bishop was
deed / Cyprian was ordained Bishop / And prouffyted the blessed vyrgyn Iustyne
with many virgyns in a monasterye / and made her Abbess over many holy
vyrgynes / Saint Cyprian sent then epystles to martirs / and comforted them
in their martyrdom / The earl of that Country herd of the fame and renommee
of Cypryan and Iustyne / he made them to be presented to fore him / and
demanded them / if they would do sacryfyse / And when he saw that they
a^ode steadfastly in the faith of Ihesu christ he commanded / that he should be
put / in a Cawdron full of wax / pytche / and greece brennynge and boyllynge /
And all this gaf to them merueylous refresshynge / and did to them no gryef /
ne pain / And the priest of thydolles said to the provost of that place /
Command me sire to stand and to be to fore the Caudron / And I shall anon
overcome all their vartue / And then he came to fore the caudron / and said /
Great is the god Hercules / and Iupyter the fader of gods / And anon the
great fire issued from under the Cawdron / and anon consumed and burnt him /
Then Cypryan and Iustyne were taken out of the Cawdron And sentence was
given ageyn them And they were both byheded to gydre And their bodies were
thrown to hounds / and were there seven days / And after they were taken up
/ and translated to Rome / And as it is said / now they resten at placence /
And they suffered death in the seventh kalendes of Octobre / about the year of
our lord CClxxx under Dyoclesyen

Thus enden the lives of saint Cyprian and Iustyne
And here folowen the lives of saint Cosme and Damyan And first of their names
COsmas is said of cosmos / which is to say a form / shappe or ornacion /
Or after ysydore / Cosmos in greek / is said clean in latin / He was a form
to other in example / He was ornate in good vortues / and clean fro all vices
/

Damyan is said of dama / which is a be humble and meke / Or damianus is
said of dogma / which is doctrine / and Ana that is above / or of daminum that
is sacryfyse / Or Damyanus is said / as it were the hand of our lord / he had
mekenes in conversation / supernal doctrine in predicacion / his sacryfyse /
was in mortifycacion of his flesh / And he was the hand of our lord in
medycynal curacion and helynge

Of the saints Cosme and damyan
COsme and Damyan were brethren germaynes / that is of one fader and of one
mother / and were of the Cite ^gee / And borne of a Relygyous mo^^r named
Theodora / They were learned in the art of Medycyne / and of leche craft / and
received so great grace of god / that they heled all maladyes and languours /
not only of men / but also cured and heled bestes And did all for the love of
god / without taking of any reward / There was a lady which had spente al
her goods in medicines / and came to these saints / and anon was heled of her
sickness / and then she offrid a little yefte to saint Damyan / but he would
not receive it / And she swear and coniured him by horrible oaths that he
granted to receive hit / And not for couetyse of the yefte / but for to obey
to the devotion of her / that offered it / And that he would not be seen to
despise the name of our lord / of which he had be coniured / And when saint
Cosme knew hit / he commanded that his body should not be leyd after his death
with his broders / And the night following our lord apperyd to saint Cosme /
and excused his brother And when Lysyas herd their renommee / he made them to
be called to fo^e him / and demanded their names and their country / And
then the holy martyrs said / Our names ben Cosme and Damyan / And we have
three other brethren / which he named Antyne / Leonce / and Euprepye / Our
countreye is Arabye / but Christian men know not fortune / Then the preconsul
or Judge commanded them / that they should bring forth their brethren And that
they should all together do sacryfyse to the ydollys / And when in no wise
they would do sacryfyse / but despised thydollys / he commanded they should be
sore tormentid in the hands and feet / And when they despised his tormentys
/ he commanded them to be bounden with a chain and thrown in to the Sea /
But they were anon delyuerd by thaungell of our lord / and taken out of the Sea / and came again to fore the Judge / And when the Ingr saw them / he said /
ye overcome our great gods by your enchauntementes / ye despise the tormentis
/ and make the sea peasyble / Teache ye me your wytchecraft / And in the name of
the god Adryan I shall follow you / And anon as he had said this / two deuyls
came / and beat him gretely in the vysage / And he cryeng said / O ye good men I
pray you that ye pray for me to our lord / And they then praid for him / And
anon the deuyls departed / Then the Judge said / Loo ye may see how the gods
had indignacion against me / by cause I thonght to have forsaken them / but I
shall not suffer my gods to be blasphemed / And then he commanded them to
be cast in to a great fire / But anon the flamme sprange far from them / and
slew many of them / that stood by / And then they were commanded to be
pu^te on a torment named Ecul^e / but they were kept by the Aungel of our lord
/ And the tormentours tormentid them above all men / And yet were they taken
of with out hurt on gryef / and foo came all hole to fore the Judge / Then the
Judge commanded the three to be put in prison / And made Cosme and Damyan to be
crucyfyed / and to be stoned of the people / but the stones returned to them
that threw them / and hurted and wounded many of them / Then the Judge
replenysshed with woodenesse / made the three brethren to stand by the Cross
/ And commanded that four knights should shote arowes to Cosme and Damyan /
but the arowes returned and hurted many / and did no harm to the martirs / And
when the Judge saw that / he was confused in all things / he was anguysshous
unto the death / and did do byhede all five brethren to gydre / Then the
christian men doubted of the word / that saint cosme had said / that his brother
should not be buried with him / and as they thought thereon / there came a voys /
which cried and said / they ben al of one substance / berye them all to gydre
in one place / And they suffered death under Dyoclesyan / about the year of our
lord two honderd four scor^ and seven / It happend that an husbond man after
that he had labored in the field about repynge of his corn he slepte With
open mouth in the feld And a serpent entryd in by his mouth in to his body /
then he awoke / and felt no thing / and after returned in to his hows / And
at even he began to be tormented and cried pytously / and called unto his
help / the holy saints of god / cosme and damyan / and when the pain and
anguysshe encreced / he went to the church of the saints / and fylle suddenly
a sleep / and then the serpent issued out of his mouth like as it had
entryd / There was a man that should have gone a long vyage / and recommended
his wife to cosme and Damyan / and left a token with her / that if he sent for
her by that token / she should come to him / And the deuylle knew well the
token / and transfygured him self in the fonrme of a man / and brought to the
woman the sign of her husbond / and said / thyn husbonde has sent me fro
that cite to the / for to lead the to him / And yet she doubted for to goo with
him / and said / I know well the token / but by cause he left me in the
keeping of the saints cosme and Damyan / Swear to me upon their altar that
thou shall bring me to him surely / And then I shall goo with the And he
swear like as she had said / Then she folewed him / And when she came in a
secret place / the deuylle would have thrown her down of her horse for to
have slain her / And when she felt that / she cried to god and to the saints
cosme and damyan for help And anon these saints were there with a great
multitude clothed inn white and delyuerd her / and the de^ylle vanysshed away /
And they said to her / we ben Cosme and Damyan / To whoos oath thou byleuedest
/ Therefore we have hyed us to come to shyn help Felyx the eight pope after
saint gregory did do make a noble church at Rome of the saints Cosme and
Damyan / and there was a man / which served deuoutely the holy martyrs in that
church / whom a Can^^e had consumed al his thye / And as he slepte / the
holy martyrs Cosme and Damyan apperyd to him their devout servant /
bringing with them an Instrument and oynement / of whom that one said to that
other / where shall we have flesh when we hane cut aweye the roten flesh
to fylle the void place / Then that other said to him / There is an ethyopyen
that this day is buried in the chircheyerd of saint peter ad vincula / which
is yet fresshe / late us bear this thither / and take we out of that moryans
flesh / and f^ll this place with all / And so they fette the thye of this
deed man / and cut of the thye of the seek man / and so changed that one
for that other / and when the seek man awoke / and felt no pain / he put
forth his hand / and felt his leg without hurt / And then took a
Candel / and saw well that it was not his thye / but that hit was another / And
when he was well come to him self / ^e sprange out of his bed for joy / and
recounted to all the people how hit was happed to him / and that which he had
seen in his sleep / And hou he was heled / and they sent hastily unto the
Tomb of the deed man / And fond the thye of him cut of / and that other
thye in the tomb instead of his / Then late us pray unto these holy martyrs to be onr socoure and help in all our hurtes blechures and sores / And
that by their merytes after this life we may come to everlasting bliss in
heaven / Amen /

Thus enden the lives of the saints Cosme and Damyan
Here follows of seint Forsyn And first of his name
FOrsin is said of forma / that is the rule of virtue to other by ensample / Or
he may be said Forsyn / like as sitting out of paradys / as long as the
bataylle of angels / and of deuyls dured for him / Or he is said of fors /
which is clarte / and of sedeo se dis to sytte / For he sytteth in the clernes
perdurable

Of seint Forsyn
FOrsyn was a Bishop And Bid writes thystorye of him / And like as he shone
in all bounte / and virtue / so at his last end he yielded up his spyryte / And
when he passyd / he saw two angels coming to him / which bare his soul up
to heaven / and the third Angel came with a white sheld shynynge / and he went
before / And after that he saw deuyls cryenge and herd how they said / late us
go to fore and make a bataylle to fore him / And when they were gone to fore
him they returned against him / and threw to him brennynge darts / But the
angel that went before received them with his shield / And then the devil
set them against the Angels / and said / that he had alweye said idle
words / And therefore he ought not without pain use the blessed life / And the
Aungel said to them / if ye purpose not against him the pryncipal vices / he
shall not perysshe for the small / And then the deuylle said / if god be
rightwys / this man shall not be saved / For it is wreton / if ye be not
converted / and made like as one of my little children / ye shall not enter in
to kingdom of heaven / To whom thau^gel excusing him / said / he had indulgence
in his heart / but he obtained the custom and usage / and the devil said like
as he has taken euylle customme / so late him receive vengeance by the
sovereign Iorge / And the holy Angel said / we shall be Iuged to fore god /
Then the deuylle was styl^e / yet he aroos again / and said / unto now we
trowed / that god had be true / for all tho sins that been not purged in earth
/ he promised that they should euerlastyngly be punysshed / This man received a
vesture of an usurer / And was not thereof punysshed / where is then the
rightwysnes of god / To whom thau^gel said / hold your pees For ye know not
the secret Iugementis of god / as long as a man hops to do his penance /
so long the mercy of god is ready to the man / The devil answered / here is no
place of penance / To whom thaungel said / ye know not the profoundnesse of
the Iugementes of god / Then the deuylle smote him so grenously / that after
when he was restablysshed to life the token and trace of the stroke abode ever
after / Then the deuyls took one / that was tormentid in the fire / and
threw him on Fors^n / so that he brent his sholdre / And then Forsyn saw well
/ that it was the usurer of whom he had received the vestyment / And
thaungel said to him / by cause thou receyuedest it / he has brent the / if
thou had not received the yefte of him / that is deed in sins / this pain
should not have burnt the / And thou have this pain of brennynge by cause
thou receyuedest of the vestyment of him / And that other deyul then said /
yet must he pass by the strayte yate / where as we may surmounte and overcome
him / and said to the Angel / god commanded to love his neighbor / as him
self / and the angel said / this man has done good works to his neighbors /
And thaduer^arye said It suffyseth not / but if he has loved them / as him
self / To whom the Aungel said / the fruit of love is to do well / For God
shall reward every man after his works / And the enemy said by cause he has
not fulfilled the word of love / he shall be dampened / Then the deuyls
fighting were ouercomen of the Angels / and yet the deuylle said / if god be
not wicked this man shall not escape without pain / For he promised to
renounce and forsake the world / And he has not done it / Then thangel
answered / he louyd not those things that been of the world / but he louyd well
to dispende them unto them that had need / And the deuylle answered In what
someuer manner he loved them it was against the commandment of god / And these
adversaries thus vainquysshed / yet the deuylle began again malycious
accusacyons saying It is wreton if thou show not to the wicked man / his
wyckednes I shall require his blood of thine hond / and this man has not showed
worthyly penance / to the sinners / And the angel said / when the sinners
despise the word that they here / then the tongue of the doctor is lettyd to
speak / when he sees that his predicacion is herd and despised / then it
apperteyneth well to a wise man to be stylle / when it is no time to speak / And
this batayl was right strong / so much that they came to fore the aungel of
god / And that the good had ouercomen the adversaries / Then this holy man
was enuyronned with great clerenesse / And as Bede says / one of thangels said
to him behold the world / Then he turned him / and saw a valeye derke / and
tenebrous / and four fyres in the air above / which were fer that one from
that other / And thaungel said to him / these ben four fyres that brenne /
that one is the fire of lesynges / For in baptym / al promise to renounce the
deuylle and al his works / And they accomplysshe hit not / The second is of
couetyse / that is when the richesse of the world is set to fore heavenly
things / The third is of dissencyon / that when men dar not offend their
neighbors for vylaynous and vicious things / The fourth is of wyckednes and
felonnye / when they despoylle them that be feeble and pour by fraud and
deceyte / as by extorcyon and tyranny / for naught / And after these fyres
assembled to gyder in one And he approached to it / and doubted and was aferd /
and said to thaungel / Sire this fire approaches to me / And the Aungel answered
/ This that thou have not set a fire shall not brenne the / For this fire here
examyneth the people after their merytes / And like as the bodies brenne by
will not couenable / right so brenneth the fire by pain due / And at the last
the soul was brought again to his pro^re body / And his neighbors wept /
which had supposed that he had been deed / And after this he lived a certain
time / and fynysshed his life laudably in good works /

Thus ends the life of saint Forsyn
Here follows the feste of saint Mychel tharchaungel And first thexposicion
of his name
Mychel is expowned sometime as god / And oftymes as saint Gregorye says / when
a thing of meruayllous virtue is done / Mychel is sent forth / so that he by
the deed and the name be given to understand that none may do that god may
do / And therefore ben attrybued to him many things of merueylous virtue / For
like as Danyel wytnessyth / he shall arise and adresse in the time of Ante
christ against him / And shall stand as a defendoure and kepar for them that been chosen / He also faught with the dragon and his angels / and casting them
out of heaven had a greet vyctorye / He also had a great plee and altercacion
with the deuylle for the body of Moses / by cause he would not show hit / For
the children of Israel should have adoured and worshyped it / He receyned the
sowles of saints And brought them in to the paradys of exultacion and joy /
He was prince of the synagoge of the Jews / but now he is establysshed of our
lord prince of the church of Ihesu Christ / and as it is said he made the
plaghes of egypt / / he departed and deuydid the read see / he ladde the people
of Israhel by the deserte / and set them in the land of promyssyon / he is
had among the company of holy Angels / as banerer / and berynge the sign of
our lord / he shall slay by the commandment of god right puyssauntly Ante
christ / that shall be in the Mount of olyuete / And deed men shall arise at
voys of this same Archaungel / And he shall show at the day of Judgment the
Cross / the spear / the nails / and the Crown of thorns of Ihesu Christ /

Of saint Mychel
The holy solempnyte of saint Mychel / is said appyerynge dedycacion /
vyctorye / and memory / The apparicion of this aungel is many fold The first
is / when he appyered in the Mount of gargan / This Montayne is in Naples /
which is named gargan / And is by the Cite named Syponte And in the year of
our lord three honderd four score and ten / was in the same Cite of Syponte a
man / which was named Garganus / which after sum books had taken that name
of the montayne / or else the Montayne took the name of the man / and he was
right rich / and had a great multitude of sheep and beestes / And as they
pastured about the sides of the Montayne / It happed that a bulle left the
other beestes / And went upon hyhe on the Mountain / and returned not home
again with the other beestes / Then this rich man the owner took a great
multitude of servants / and did do seche this bull al aboutes / And at the
last he was founden on high on the Montayne / by the entree of an hole or a
cave / And then the maystre was wroth / by cause he had strayed allone
from other beestes / and made one of his servants to shote an arowe at him /
And anon the arowe returned with the wind / and smote him that had shot hit
/ wherewith they of the Cite were troubled with this thing / and went to the
Bishop / and inquired of him / what was to be done in this thing that was so
wonderful / And then be commaun d them to fast three days / and to pray
unto god / And when this was done / saint Mychel appeared to the Bishop saying
/ know ye that thylke man is so hurt by my will / I am Mychell the
Archaungel / which will / that this place be worshypped in earth / and will
have hit surely kept / And therefore I have prouyd that I am kepar of this place
by the demonstraunce and showing of this thing / And then anon the Bishop
/ and they of the Cite went with processyon unto that place / And durst not
enter in to hit / but made their prayers without forth The second apparicion
was in the year of our lord seven honderd and ten in a place / which was
named Tumba by the sea side / six mile fro the Cite dauerances / Saint Mychel
apperyd to the Bishop of that Cite / and commanded him to do make a church
in the foresaid place / like as it was made in the Mount of gargan / And in a^
ke wise should halowe the memory of saint Mychel there / And the bishop
doubted in what place it should be made / And saint Mychael said to him / in the
place where he should find a bulle hyd of thieves / and yet he doubted of the
largeness of the place / And saint Mychell appyered to him / and said / that
he should make hit of the bread that he should find that the bulle had trodden
and traced with his feet / and there were two roches / which no maunes power
might remeue / Then saint Mychel apperyd to a man / and commanded him that
he should goo to that same place / and take awey the two wekes And when he came /
be remeued the two roches as lyghtely as they had weyed no thing / And when
the chirch was edyffyed / there mychel set a pyece of a stone of marble / there
upon which he stood / and a part of the palle that he had leyd on the altar
of that other Church he brought thither to this Church / And by cause they had
great penurye and need of water / they made by the thadmonestement of
thanngelle an hoole in a stone of marble / and anon there flowed out so
much water / that unto this day they be sustained by the benefayt thereof / And
this apparicion is solempnly hallowed the xvij kalendes of Nouembre in that
place / And there happed in the same place a miracle worthy to be putt in
remembrance / This Montayne is enuyronned about with the sea Occean / but on
saint Mychels day it auoydeth twyes / and gives way to the people / And as a
great company of people went to the Chirch / hit happed that a woman great with
child neyhe her time of delyueraunce was in the company / and when they
returned / the wawes and water came with great force / so that the company for
dread fled to the Ryuage / And the woman great with child might not flee / but
was take and wrapped in the floodes of the sea / but saint Mychel kept the wife
al hoole / and she was delynerd and childed among the wawes in the myddel of
the sea / And she took the child between her arms and gaf it sowke / and
after when the sea was withdrawn / she went a land at hoole with her child /
The third apparicion happed in the time of Gregory the (...) / For when the
said (...) had establysshed the letanyes for the pestylence that was that
time / and prayed deuoutely for the people / he saw upon the castle / which was
said sometime the Memory of Adryan / the angel of god which wyped and maade
clean a blody swerd / and put it in to a shethe / And thereby he understood /
that his prayers were herd / Then he did do make there a Church in
thonoure of saint Mychel / And that Castle is yet name d the Castle angel /
And yet anothir apparicion was in the Mount of gargan when he apperyd and gaf
vyctory to them of Syponte / which is hallowed the eight ydus of Iuy let / The
fourth apparicion is that which is in the Ierarchye of the same angels / For
the first apparicion is said Epyphanye / that is thapparicion of seuereynes /
The second s said yperphanye / that is the mean apparicion / And that other is
said ypophanye / that is the most low apparicion / And Gerarchye is said of
gerar that is holy / and of Archos that is a prince / And see gerarchye is to
say an holy pryncipate and every gerarchye conteyneth three ordres of angels /
For the souerayn gerarchye after thassygnacion of saint denis conteyneth
Cherubyn / Seraphyn / and the thrones / The myddle conteyneth the domynacions /
the virtues / and the potestates / the last conteyneth the pryncipates / angels
and Archaungels And thordynaunce and disposicion of them may be seen by
semblable and like in erthely pryncipates / For of the mynystres that been
about a king / some work inmedyatly about the person of the king as
cubyculers / Counseyllours and thassystentes / and they a be like unto the
order of the first Ierarchye / Sum there ben that have the rewle of the
Royamme / sum in one prouynce / and sum in another / as ben lyeutenauntes
Capytaynes of Chyualrye and Iuges / And they be like unto the second Ierarchye
/ And other ben assigned to particular offices in the diverse parties of the
Royamme / as Mayres / Shereues / baylles and such other less offices / And
these ben like to thordres of the (...) Gerarchye / the three ordres of the
first Gerarchye ben taken in as much as they assiste god / and ben conuertid
to him / And thereto ben three things necessary / that is to wete / sovereign
love And that is as touching the order of Seraphyn / which ben said fyry /
parfyght knowledge that is touching cherubyn / which is as much to say as
plenytude of science / and perpetuel fruycion or vsau^ce / As touching the
thrones / which ben said sitting / For god sytteth and rests in them / The
three ordres of the myddel Gerarchye / ben taken and had in as much as they
domyne and govern thunyuersyte of people in common / This seygnorye and this
gouernynge is in three things / the first in seygnorye and commaundynge / and
that apperteyneth to thordre of domynacion / which seygnoryeth above other
that been lower / and adresse them in all the mynystres dyuyne / and
commands to them all thing / And that says Zacharye in the fyfthe
chapter / that one Aungel says to another / Run and speak to the child /
Secondly in doing / And this apperteyneth to thordre of virtues To whom no
thing ne is impossyble to execute / which that is commanded to them / for to
them is given power to do all things dyffycyle which ben perteynynge to
dyuyne mysterye / And therefore it is attrybued to them to do miracles /
Thydrly in constraynynge / for to constrayne the Impedymentes and destourbles /
And this apperteyneth to thordre of the potestates / And this is sygnyfyed in
Thobye / where Raphael bond the devil in the ouerest deserte The three ordres
of the last Gerarchye / ben taken after that they have government and lymyted
/ Some of them seygnorye and govern in one prouynce / And that been they of
thordre of the pryncipates / like as the prince of perses seygnoryeth upon the
persia^s like as it is read in danyel in the tenthe Chapter /

And sum ben deputed to the governance of a multitude of a cite / And theybe
said archa^gels / and the other bencommysed to the governance of one person /
and they ben said Angels / and ben said to show the small things and little /
by cause that their seruyse and mynysterye is lymyted unto one man /
Archaungels ben said more and gretter / For the we will of a multitude is better
and more worthy than the well of one man / In thassignacion of thordres of the
first Gerarchye / Gregory accords with Dyonyse / and Bernard also / which
is taken about their fruycion / which is in brennynge love / as touching to
seraphyn / In profounde cognycion / as to Cherubyn / and in perpetuell
retencion / as touching the thrones / but they discordre in thassignacion of
the myddle and last two ordres / that is pryncipates and virtues / Gregory and
Bernard have another consideracion / that is to wete that the myddell Gerarchye
is in his seygnorye or prelacye / and the last is taken in his pity or
mynystracion / the prelacye in angels is treble / for Angels domyne over
spirits angelyk / And they ben said domynacions / And they domyne also over
good works / And they ben said pryncipates / And they domyne over devils and
they be said potestates / and the order and the degrees of their dignyte
apperith in these things / The mynysterye of them is threfold / Sum stands
in werkyng / sum in techyng / and in techyng sum more and some less / The
first apperteineth to virtues / the second to archaungels / and the third to
angels / The fifthe apparicion is hit which is read in thistorye tripertite /
There is a place beside Constantinople where as sometime the goddess vesta was
worshipped / but now there is bylded a church in thonour of saint Mychel / and
is named Mychels place For a man that was named Aquylyne was taken with a right
great fever meuyd of read colere / And the phisiciens gaf to him so brennyng /
in a agne a drink / which anon he vomyted out at his mouth / and what he
ete or drank / alweye he vomyted and casted out / so that he was nyghe deed
And did him to be borne to that place / And supposed well there to be soon deed
or heled / And then saint Mychel apperyd to him / and said to him that he
should make a confection of honey and wyn and peper / And what someuer he ete he
should wete therein / And so should he have plain health / which thing he did /
and anon he was delyuerd from his maladye / how well that after the Judgment of
the Phisicyens that drink or medycyne was contrary to them that been Coleric
This is had in thystorye trypertite /

Secondly / this solempnyte of saint Mychel is said vyctorye / And the victory
of saint Mychell is manyfold / And also of other Angels / the first is that
saint mychael gaf to them of Syponte in this manner / After a certain time that
the place was found / they of Naples were yet paynyms / And ordained their
host for to fight against them of Syponte and of Bonyuent / And by the
counseylle of the Bishop the Christian men took triews for three days / that
they might fast tho three days / and require their patron saint Mychaell unto
their aid and help / In the third night the holy saint Mychael appyeryd to
the said Bishop / and said that their prayers were herd / and promised them to
have vyctorye / And commanded them to run on their enemies at fourth hour
of the day / without more taryeng And when they run against them / the
Montayne of gorgan began strongly to tremble / and a great tempest arose / so
that lyghtnyng fleyghe about / And a derke cloud couerd the Montayne / so
that six honderd of their adversaries deyde of the fyry arowes which came fro
the air / And all the resydue of them that were not slain / left their
ydolatrye / and submytted them anon to the Christian faith /

The second vyctory of saint Mychell was / when he put out of heaven the dragon
Lucyfer with all his folowers / Of which is said in thapocalyps / Factum est
prelium magnum / Apocalipsis dnodecimo / For when Lucifer coueyted to be like
to god / tharchaungel / which bare the baner of the celistyall host came and
chaced Lucifer out of heaven with all them that followed him / and has enclosed
them in derke air unto the day of dome / For they be not suffered to duelle in
heaven / neither in the upper (...) of thayer / by cause that place is (...) and
delectable / ne yet to be in earth with us / to the end that they should not
ouermoche tempte ne torme^te us / But they ben in thayer bitwene heaven and
earth / so that when they look upward / they may behold the joy that they
have lost / and have thereof great sorrow / And when they look donnward / they
may see the men mount up to heaven / fro whens they fylle Notwithstondynge by
the dyuyne dispensacion they descend often unto us in earth / As like hit has
be showed to sum holy men / they flee about us as flies / they ben
Innumerable / And like flies they fylle thayer without nombre / whereof says
Haymo / as the philosophers sayden and doctors have oppynyon / This air is
also full of deuyls / and of wicked spyrytes / as the son bemes ben full of
small mot^s / which is small dust or pouldre / And how well that they be so
many / Never theles after the sentence of Orygene / their power ne strength is
but right little / and that we may overcome them here / And if any of them ben
ouercomen of any holy man / he may never after tempte a man of that vice / Of
which he is ouercomen /

The third vyctory is / that Angels have every day of the deuyls when they
fight for us against them / And deliver us fro their temptacions / and they
deliver us in three manners / First in refreynynge the power of the devil like as
it is said Appcalypsis vises^o / of the angel that bond the deuylle And sent
him in to Abisme / that is the pytte of hell / And Thobye which faith that
the Aungel Raphael bond the deuylle in the ouerest deserde / And this byndynge
is none other thing / but the refraynynge of his puyssaunce and might /
Secondly he delyuereth us in refraynyng our couetyse / the which thing is in
genesis the xxxij chapitre there where he says / that thangell took the synew
of Jacob / and anon it dried up / Thirdly in empressyng in our hertes the
memory of the passion of our lord / this is signefyed appcalipsis vij / where
it is said / Ne woylle ye not grieve ne noye in therthe / ne in the sea / ne the
trees till we have marked them / Ezechyel says / the sign of thau be in the
forhedes of the people / Thau is made like an hedeles Cross / And they that been
marked there with dreede not thangel smiting / whereof is said / up on whom ye
see thau / slay them not / The fourth victory is that / that tharchangel
mychell shall have of Antecryst when he shall slay him / then mychael the
great prince shall arise / as it is said danielis xij / he shall arise for them
that been chosen / as an helpar and a protector / and shall strongly stand
against Antecryst / and after as the gloss says / Antecryste shall feign him to
be deed / and shall hyde him three days / and after he shall appiere saying
that he is risen fro death to life / and the deuyls shall bear him / by art
magyke and shall mou^te up in to thayer / and all the people shall marvel and
worshipe him / and at last he shall mount up on the mount of olyuete / and
when he shall be in a pauyllon in his syege entryd in to that place where our
lord ascended Mychel shall come and shall slay him / of which vyctorye is
vnderstonden after saint gregorye / that which is said in thapocalipsis / the
battle is made in heaven / This word of the treble bataylle in heaven is
expowned of the battle that he had with Lucifer / when he expulsid him out of
heaven / and of the battle that he had with the deuyls that tormente us / And
of this last solempnyte is said dedycacion / by cause on this day the said
place in the Mount gargan was dedycate / and hallowed of him by reuelacion / For
when they of Syponte were returned fro thoccision of their adversaries / and
had so noble vyctorye / yet doubted they to enter in to the said place / and
halowe it to tharchaungel / Then the bishop went / and axed counseylle of
pope pelagyen / And he ansuerd if the church ought to be dedycate / that ought
to be on that day that the vyctorye was done / And if it plese other wise to
saint Mychael / men ought to require his will thereof / and then thepope /
the bishop and men of the cite fasted three days / and saint Mychel appiered
to the bishop and said / It is no need to you to dedye and halowe that I have
hallowed / and commanded that he should enter in to that place the next day
with the people / and should frequente hit with prayers / and they should feel
that he should be a specyal patron to them / and he gaf to them a sign of
consecracion / that was / that they should goo up thereto by a posterne toward
the eest / and they should find there the steps of a man impressyd in a
marble stone / then the bishop on the morn and much great people came to the
place / and entryd in / and fond a great cave and three aultres / of which two
were set toward the southe / and the third toward the eest much honorably
/ and was couerd al about with a read mantel / and when the solempnytees of
the masses were done / and the people had taken holy communyon / al returned to
their propre places / and the bishop left there prestes and clerks for to
sing and say goodly the dyuyne office / and within the said church sourdeth
clear water and sweet / which the common people drynketh and ben heled thereby of
many diverse maladyes / And when the pope herd these things / he
establysshed to halowe this day in thonoure of saint Mychel and of all the
holy Angels / and to be kept holy thorugh all the world /

Fourthly / this solempnyte is said the Memory of saint Mychael / how well
that we all solempnyse this feast in the honor of all the Archaungellys of
our Lord / We do the Memory and the honors generally / And hit
apperteyneth and is behoeffull to us to give to them / lawde praysynge and
honor by manyfold reasons expert / that is to wete / For they ben our kepars
/ our mynystres / our brethren / our neighbors / the berars of our sowles
in to heaven / and representers of our prayers unto god / Right noble knights
of the king of heaven / And perdurable comfortours of them that been in heaviness
and trybulacions / And first we ought to honor them / For they ben our
kepars / wherefore we ought to worshipe them / To every man ben given two Angels
/ One euylle for to styre him to ylle / and one good to keep him The good
Angels ben deputed to the keeping of men in their birth / and after the
natyuyte also / and ben allwey with them / when they ben full grown / And in
this three astates is an aungel necessary to a man / For when he is yet
little in the womb / he may be deed and be dampened / when he is out of the
womb to fore he be grown / he may be let fro baptysme / And when he is
grown / he may be drawn to diverse sins / The deuylle deceyueth them /
that been grown by fallace and herkenyng / he flatereth them by delyces and
blaundyses / And oppressyd virtue by vyolence / therefore hit is need that a good
Angel ben deputed to the keeping of a man / to the end that he address and
enduce man ageynste the fallace that he exhort and somone to do good ageynste
flaterynge and blanndyces / And that he deffende him from oppression ageynste
vyolence / And the prouffyte of the keeping of the angel to a man may be
assigned in four manners / The first / that the soul may prouffite in the
well and good of grace / And this does the Angel to the soul in three manners
And the first is in to remeuynge all lettynge to do well and good / And that
is signefyed in Exodi duodecimo where the angel smote all the first be gotten
of Egypt / Secondly in awakynge or excytynge from slouthe / And that is
signefyed Zacharye quarto / The Angel of our lord has areysed me / as a man
that is waked out of his sleep / Thirdly in ledyng a man in the way of
penance / and bringing again / And this is sygnefyed in Thobye in the fyfthe
chapter in the Aungel that ladde him and brought him again / The second
prouffyt that thangel does / is / that he fall not in to sin / And this does
the Angelle in three manners / First in lettynge the euylle to be done / that it
be not done / And this is sygnefyed in the book of nombres in the xxij chapter
/ For balaam which went for to curse Israel / was let of thangel / Secondly
/ in blaming the sin passed / that man depart fro it / And that is
sygnefyed in the book of Iuges in the second chapter / how the angels blamed
the children of Israel for brekyng of the law / wherefore they wept / Thyrdly
in bringing strength for to take away the sin present / And this is
signefyed in loathe / when he was led out by force / he his wife and his
daughters fro the cite of Sodom / that is to wete fro the custommaunce of
sin / The third effect and prouffyte is / if that if he fall / that he arise
anon again / And this does the aungelle in three manners / First is meuyng a
man to contricion / And this is sygnefyed in Thobye in the xij chapter / where
as he taught thobye to enoynte the eyes of his fader with galle / that is to
understand contricion of the heart enoynteth the eyes of the heart / Secondly
in purging lyppes by confession / And that is sygnyfyed in ysaye the / v /
chapter / where the angel purged the lyppes of ysaye / Thyrdely in enioyeng to
satisfaction / And that is sygnyfyed in Luke the xv chapter / that says /
that gretter joy is in heaven of a synnar doing penance than of lxxxxix rytful
men which need no peuau^ce / The fourth prouffit is / that man fall not so
often in to sin as the devil encyteth him thereto / and this does he in three
manners / that is to wete in refraynyng the puyssau^ce and myt of the devil in
affeblyng the couetyse and desire of sin / and in enpryntyng in our minds
the passion of our lord Ihesu crist / of which things it is said to fore / We
ought to honor them secondly / for they ben our admynystratours / like as
thapostle says adhebreos x / They ben spyrytes of admynystracion / all
spirits ben sent for us The superyors ben sent to the moyens The moyest ben
sent to the lowest / and the lowest ben sent to us / And this sendynge comes
of the dyuyne bouute / And in this sendynge appyereth how much the bounte
dyuyne apperteyneth to the love of our health / Secondly of the charity of the
aungel / For this sendynge apperteyneth that it be of ardaunt charity /
specially to desire the health of other / Wherefore Ysaye says / Loo I am here
lord / send me forth / And the Angels may help us by cause they see that we
have need of them / and may well overcome the euylle spyrytes and angels /
And therefore the law of charity angelyck requires / that they be sent to us /
Thyrdly / this sendyng is needful to the need of man For they be sent
tenflamme our affection to love / Whereof in sign hereof it is read that they
were sent in a fyry chare / Secondly / they ben sent tenlumyne to
understanding unto knowledge / And this is signefyed apocalipsis x / in the
Aungel / which had a book opene in his hond / Thyrdly / they be sent for to
strength in us all our perfection unto the end / And that is signefyed iij
Regum xix / Where the angel brought to Helye a loof of bread baken under asshen
/ and a vessel of water / And he ete / and walked in the strength of that mete
unto the Mount of god Oreb Thyrdly they ought to be honored / For they ben
our brethren and our neighbors / For all they that been chosen ben taken to
the ordres of angels / the sum unto the ouerest / and sum to the lowest /
and sum to the myddel / For the dyuersyte of her merytes / And how be it /
that the blessed vyrgyne be abouen all / like as saint gregory shows in his
Omelye / For he says / there ben sum / that taken the small things / but yet
they leave not to show hit to the brethren / And they run in the nombre of
angels / And these ben they / that may take the souerayntees of the secrets
celestyal / and show it to other / And these ben tharchaungels celestyalle /
and show it to other / And these ben tharchaungels / and ben they / that make
merueylous signs / and work puyssauntly / And these be that with virtues
work / And sum there be / that chase awey the wicked spyrytes / by the virtue
of prayer / and by strength of their power received of god / And these have
their merytees with the potestates / And there be sum that by their virtues
mount above the merytees of them that been chosen / and domyne over the
brethren / and sort their merit with the pryncipates / And there ben sum
that overcome and do mine over al vices in hem self / And they by right ben
called of the world Gods among men / Like as god said to Moses / Loo I have
establysshed the god of Pharao / And these ben with the domynacions And there
ben sum that sytte in the Trone like presydentes / and examyne the works and
deeds of other / by whom when holy church is governed / all they that be
n chosen ben Iuged / And these ben with the thrones / and ben they that with
the Charity and love of god / and their neyboure before other ben full / And
these by their merytees have taken their sort in the nombre of Cherubyn / For
cherubyn is said the plenytude of science And as pawle says / the plenytude of
the law is love and charity / And these ben they / that enbraced in the
brennyng love of supernal contemplacion / wysshe only to be in the desire of
their maker / They desire no thing of this world / but only ben fed in the
love of the lord perdurable / they eschew al erthely things / and over pass
by thought al temporal things they love / they brenne / and rest in that
brennynge love / they brenne in loving And ben enflammed in speaking / And
all that ever they touch in any manner by word / they make them anon to
brenne in the love of god / And where shall these take their sort / but among
the nombre of Seraphyn / Hec Gregorius / this says saint gregory / Fourthly /
they ought to be honored by cause that they be berars of our souls in to
paradys / And this done they in three manners / The first in making ready the
way / as Malachiel says in the thryd chapter / loo here I send mine angel
which shall make ready thy way to fore thy face / Secondly in beryng them to
heaven by the way made ready / like as it is said in Exodo the four and twenty
chapter / I send to the mine angel which shall keep the in thy way / and
shall bring the to the land which I have promised to thy faders / Thyrdly in
setting them in heaven / and hereof says lucas luce / xv / It was done when the
beggar deyd / his soul was borne of angels in to Abraham's bosom / Fyftly /
they ought to be honored by cause they ben representers of our sowles to fore
god / and this representacion is in three manners first they represente our
prayers to fore god / and this says Thobye the xij chapter / when thou
praydest with teres / And buryedest the deed men / I offered thy prayer to our
lord / Secondly they allege for us to fore our lord / And hereof says Iobe the
xxxiij Chapter / if there were an angel speaking for him / and said one of
like things / that he show the equity of the man / our lord should have mercy
and pity on him / Also Zachee primo / And thaungel of our lord answered and said
O lord of all strengthes / shall not thou have pity of Iherusalem / and of the
cytees of Judah / To whom thou art wroth / This is the lxx year / Thyrdly /
they show the sentence of god as it is said in danyell that the angel gabryell
fleing said / Sith the beginning of the prayers / the word issued out /
that is to wete the sentence of god / and I am comen for to show it to the /
For thou art a man of desires / Of these three things says Bernard upon the
Cantyques / The aungel secheth moyen between the love and the lover in offrynge
the desires / and bryngyng yeftes / and meueth her / and plesyd him / Sixthly /
they ought to be honored / For they ben the right noble knights of the king
perdurable / after that Job says in the xxv chapter / Is not this the noble
nombre of his knights For as we see in the knights of sum king / that
sum of them dwell always in the halle of the king / and accompanye the king
/ and coueyte honor and solace to the king / and some other keep the cytees
and castles of the king and other fyt against the enemies of the king / Thus is
it of the knights of Christ / Some ben in the halle ryall / that is to seye in
the heaven Imperyal / and accompanye alwey the king of kings / and sing alwey
songs and gladness to his honor and glory / saying Sanctus / sanctus /
sanctus / blessyng and clernes and wisdom / And the other keep the cytees /
the towns / the castellys and the fawbourghs / they ben deputed to the keeping
of us / keeping the state of vyrgyns / of contynentes / of married people / and
the castellys of Relygyon / Whereof ysaye says / Upon the walls of Iherusalem
I have establysshed kepars / Other there ben that fight and vaynquysshe the
enemies of god / Of whom it is said in thapocalypsis / There is a bateyll made
in heaven / that is after some exposycyon / in the church mylytaunt / Mychel and
his angels foughten with the dragon / The seuenthe and the last they ought to
be honored / by cause they ben comfortours of them that been in trybulacion /
And hereof says Zacharye in the first chapter / Thangel that spak to me good
words were words of comfort / And this done they in three manners / First in
comfortyng and str^ng thing / danielis decimo / For where as danyel fill the
aungel of our lord touched him and said / be not aferd / ne dread the no thing
/ pees be to the / Comfort thy self and be boystous / Secondly in keeping fro
Impacyence / and this says Dauyd / He has commanded his Angels to keep the
in all thy ways / Thirdly in refresshynge and lassyng that trybulacion / and
that is signefyed in Danyel the third chapter / There where as the angel of
our lord descended in the fornays with three children / and made the myddel of
the fornays as it had been a wind blowyng with a soft dew / By these ensamples
we may understand that we ought to give honor to the holy company of Angels
/ And to pray them to keep us in this wretchid life / from our enemies the
deuylle / the world / and the Flesh / that after when we shall depart /
they present our souls unto almighty god in heaven / there to duelle / and
abide sempyternally / with them / quoth ipse prestatur / qui sine fine viuit et
regnat in secula seculorum Amen

Thus ends the Historye of saint Mychel and thaungels
Here follows the life of saint Ieromme And first of his name
IHeromme is said of Ihera that is holy / And of nemus / that is to say a
wood / And so Iherome is as much to say as an holy wood Or it is said of
norma / that is to say law / whereof is said in his legende / that Iheromme is
interpreted an holy law / He was ferforth holy / that is to say ferme or
clean / or dyed of blood / or deputed to holy usage / like as vessels of the
Temple ben said holy / For they ben ordained to holy usage / he was holy that
is to say st^dfast in holy work by long pers^ueraunce / he was clean in
mind by purete / he was dyed in blood by thinking of the passion of our lord
Ihesu christ he was deputed to holy usage / by ^hexposicion of holy scripture
/ he was said an holy wood / by the conversation that he sometime did and
abode in the wood / And he was said law for the rewles of his disciplyne /
which he taught to his Monks / or by cause he expowned and interpreted the
holy law and scripture / Iheromme also is interpreted the vision of beaulte /
or Iugyng words / there is beauty manyfold First is spyrytuall / which is in
the soul / Second morale / which is in honest of manners / The third is
intellectual / which is in the angels / The fourth is substancyall / which
is dyuyne / the fyfthe is heavenly / which is in the Country of saints / This
five fold beaulte had saint Ihero^me in him self / For he had spyrytuall in
dyuersyte of virtues / The moral he had in thoneste of his life / he had
intellectual in thexllence of purete / He had the substancyell in brennynge
charity / He had the celestyal in the perdurable and excellent clerenes or
clartee / He Iuged the speches and words / his own well examyned in clearly
pronouncynge / The others being true in confermyng The false condempnynge and
confusyng And the doubteful in expownyng

Of saint Iheromme
IHerome was the sone of a noble man named Eusebe borne of the town Strydone /
which is in the utter end of Dalmace and of panonye / he being yet a child
went to Rome / and was there taught in lettres of greece / latin / and hebrewe /
he had for his techer in gramair / Donate / In Rethoryque / Vyctoryn thoratour
/ and he was day and nyt occupied and exercysed him self in dyuyne scriptures /
which he drew couetously / And after shed hit out haboundauntly / And as he
writes in an Epistle to Eus^ochium / that on a time as he red on a day plato /
And in the night Tullye desyrously by cause that the book of the prophets
plesyd him not / he was about mydlente taken with a sudden and brennynge
fever / that all his body was cold / In such wise that there was no vytal hete
sauf a little which he felt in his breast / And as thexequyes for his death
was making ready / he was suddenly brought to the Judgment of god / And there
he was demanded of what condition he was / And he answered boldly that he was a
Christian man / And the Judge said / thou lie / thou art a Cyceronyan / and no
christian man where as thy tresour is / there is thy heart Then saint Iheromme
was stylle / and said no thing / And anon then the Judge commanded that he
should be sore beten / then he cried and said / have mercy on me lord / have
mercy on me / Then they that were assistynge our lord / prayed him that he
would forgive thyis young man his trespaas / And he then bganne to swear and
say lord / if ever I read or here more seculer books I shall forsake the /
And with the words of this promise and oath he was late goo / And anon he
reuyued / And then he saw him self al bywepte / And of the st^okes of the
betynges that he received to fore the Trone of our lord the tokens of the
strokes and lasshes were seen on his sholdres right horrible and great / And
fro than forthon he becam good / and read dyuyne books with as great study
as ever he had read the books of poetry and of paynyms / And when he was
nine and twenty year old / he was ordained Cardynal priest in the Church of
Rome / And when Lyberius was deed / all the people cried to have saint Ieromme
sovereign priest And when he began to blame the Iolyte and Lauays life of
some clerks and Monks / they had indignacion and despyte of him / and lay in
a wait to hurt and sclaundre him / And as Johan Beleth said / they scorned
and mocqued him by the clothing of a woman / For on a night when he arose to
matyns / as he was a custommed and fond a woman's clothyng lyenge by his bed
/ which his enemies had leyd there / And he wenynge that they had been his own
did them on / and so clothed came in to the church / and this did they that
had envy at him / by cause other should wene that he had a woman in his
chamber / And when he saw that / he eschewed their woodenes / and went unto
Gregory Nazanzenne bishop of constantinople / And when he had learned of him
the holy scripture and holy l^ttres he went in to deserte / where what and
how much he suffryd for Crystes sake he recounted to Eustochium / and said /
that when he was in that greet deserte and waste wilderness / which is so
burnt by the son / that it gaf to the Monks a right dry habytac^^ / I
supposed me then to be at Rome among the delyces / and my members scalded
burnt made dry and black like to the skin of a Moryan or an Ethyope / And
I was alwey in teres and wepynges / And when the very sleep came and oppressyd
me / against which I often repugned / then I leyd my dried bones on the bare
earth / of metes and drink I speak not / For they that were seek used only
cold water / And for to take any thing boylled or roasted it was to them
lecherye / and yet nevertheless I was often felawe unto scorpions and wild
beestes / and yet the carollis of maidens and thembracementis of lechery grew
in my cold body / and in my flesh / wherefore I wept contynuelly / and for to
adaunte and subdue my proud flesh I rose at mydnyght all the weke long /
ioynyng often the night with the day / and I cessid not to beat my breast
prayenge our lord to render to me the peasyble pees of my flesh / And I also
doubted my propre celle / as feryng my consaytes and thoughts / wherefore I
went and departed wroth and reuengynge my self passed allone through the
sharp and thycke deserts / And as our lord is witness aftir many wepynges
and teeres / It seemed me that I was among the company of angels / this during
four year / Then his penance thus done / He returned to the town of
Bethlehem / where as a wise and a prudent be offryd him self to abide by the
Crybbe of our lord / And then his holy bible which with study he had
translated and other books he read / and lad the day forth with fasting unto
even / And there he assembled many disciples unto him for to labor there in
his holy purpoos / and abode there in the translacion of holy scripture / lv
year and six months / and remained a pure vyrgyne unto the end of his life /
And how well that it be said in his legende that he was ever a virgyne / yet
nevertheless he wrote of him self to palmacyen / I bear vyrgynyte in to heaven /
Not for that I have virgynyte but for I marvel more that I have it not /
Then at the last he being weary for to trauaylle / lay down in his bed /
wherouer henge a cord on a beme / whereon he leyd and held his hondes for to
lift up him self / that he might done the service of god / as much as he
might / On a day toward even Ieromme satte with his brethren for to here the
holy lesson / And a lion came halting suddenly in to the monastery / and when
the brethren saw him anon they fled / and Ieromme came against him / as he
should come against his ghest / and then the lion showed to him his foot
being hurt / then he called his brethren / and commanded them to wasshe
his feet / and dylygently to seche and search for the wound / And that done
the plant of the foot of the lion was sore hurt and prycked with a thorn /
Then this holy man put thereto dylygent cure and heled him And he abode ever
after as a tame best with hem / Then saint Ieromme saw that god had sent
him to them / not only for the health of his foot / but also for their
prouffyte / and joined to the lion an office by thaccord of his brethren / And
that was that he should conduyte and led an ass to his pasture which brought
home wood / and should keep him going and coming / and so he did / For he
did that which he was commanded / and ladde thasse thus as an herdman / and
kept him wisely going and coming / and was to him a right sure kepar and
defendour / and alwey at hour acustomed he and the ass came for to have
their refection / and for to make the ass to do the work acustomed / On a
time hit happed that the ass was in his pasture / And the lion slepte fast /
And certain merchants passed by with camellys / and saw the ass allone /
and stale him and lad him away / and anon after the lion awoke / and when he
fond not his felaw / he ran groynynge hyder and thither / and when he saw
that he could not find him / he was much soroufull / and durst not come in /
but abode at the yate of the church of the monastery / and was ashamed that he
came without the ass / And when the brethren saw that he was comen more late
than he was wont and without the ass / they supposid that by constraint of
honger he had eten the ass / and would not give to him his portion acustomed /
and said to him / go and ete that other part of the ass / that thou have
devoured / and fylle thy glotonnye / And by cause they doubted / they would wit
if he had so eten / they went to the pastures of the Town to see / if they
cou^he have any demonstraunce of the death of thasse / and they fond no thing
and returned and told it to Jerome / and then he commanded them to enjoin him
to do thoffyce of thasse / then they hewed done busshes / and bows / and
leid upon him / and he suffrid it payssybly / And on a day when he had done
his office / he went out to the feldes / and began to run hyder and
thither desiring to know / what was done to his felawe / And saw fro far
merchants that came with camellys charged and laden / and the ass going
before them / It was the manner of that Regyon / that when the people went
far with camellys / they had an ass / or an horse going to fore with a cord
about his neck for to conduyte the better the camellys / And when the lion
knew the ass / with a great rerynge he ran on them so tereybly / that all
the merchants fled / And he so fered the camellys with betynge the earth
with his taylle / that he constrained them to goo strayte unto th celle with all
their charge and ladynge / And when ye brethren saw this / they told it to
Ieromme / and he said brethren wesshe the feet of our ghestes / and give them
mete / And abide ye the will of our lord herupon / And then the lion
began to run ioyously through out all the monastery / as he was woned to do
/ and kneled down to every brother / and fawned them with his tail / like as
he had demanded pardon of the trespass that he had done / And saint Iheromme
/ which knew well what was to come said to his brethren / Goo and make ye
ready all things necessary for ghestes that be coming to us / And as he thus
said / there came to him a messager / saying to him / that there were ghestes at
the yate / that would speak with thabbot / And as soon as they were come / they
knelyd to thabbot / and required of him pardon / And he raised and made them to
stand up goodly / And commanded them to take their own good / and not to
take aweye other men's / And then they prayde the holy saint that he would
take the half of their oylle / And he reffused hit / And at the last he
commanded to take a mesure of oylle / And then they promised that they should
bring every year a mesure of oil to that church and their heirs after them
/

It was auncyently the customme / that who someuer would / might sing in the
church / so that Theodosyan the emperor / as Johan Beleth says required and
prayed damase the pope / that he would commyse to sum wyseman of the church to
ordeyne the office and ordynal of the Church / And then he knew well / that
Iheromme was a man that knew the langages of greek / latin and hebrewe / and
in all science / and commysed to him the seid sovereign office / And then
Iherom divided the psaulter by feryes / and to every ferye a nocturne propre he
assigned / And establysshed in the end of every psalm to be said Gloria patri /
And after he ordeygned resonably to be songen the epystles and gospels / and
and all other things appertenaunt sauf the song / which he sent from
bethlehem unto the pope / which al was ^pproued and ratefyed of him / and of
the cardynals for to be used perpetuelly and so confermed /

After this in the mouth of the spelunke or cave in which our lord lay / he
did do make his monumente or sepulture / And when he had accomplysshed lxxxviij
year and six months / he was there buried / In what reverence saint Austyn
had him in / It apperyth in his epystles that he sent to him / In one of the
which he wrote in this manner / To his right dear friend most best bylouyd /
and most cl^ne in observing and enbracynge of Charity / unto Iheromme Austyn /
etcetera / And in another place he writes thus of him / Saint Ieromme priest
learned in lettres of greek / latin / and H^brewe / and in holy wrytynges
approved unto his last eage / Of whom the nobleness of his fair eloquence /
has resplendyd from the eeste unto the weste like unto the clerenes of the
son / Prosper says also of him in his cronyques / Iheromme priest was in
bethlehem sometime clear to all the world of noble engyne / And lived in
translatynge and writing of holy scripture / and with hyhe and noble study
served the universal church / He said also of him self to Ambygen / I never
enforced me so much fro mine enfancye / as for teschewe a swellyng courage /
and enhaunced heed / and calling ageynste him the hate of god / And ever I have
dred the sure things / and have intended with all my heart to the Monasterye /
and to hospytalyte / and have received gladly al comers / saufe Heretykes / and
have wesshen their fete / Isydore says thus in the book of Ethymologye /
Iheromme was wise in three langages / whoos Interpretacion is taken to fore
other / For hit is more holding and clear by words and it is interpreted of a
very christian It is wreton also of Iheromme in the dyalogue of Severe disciple
of saint Martyn / which was in his time / Ieromme without the merit of the
faith and dowayre of virtues / is not only Instruct in lettres of latin / but
in greek and Hebrewe / so that none ought be comparyd to him in every science
/ the which had were perpetuel against the wicked men / The heretykes hated
him / for he left never to Impugn ayenste them / The Clerks hated him / For
he repreuyd their sins / and their life / But plainly good men louyd him and
meruayled of him / For they that demed him an Heretik were mad / he was al in
lessons / all in books / he ne rested day ne night / but always read or wrote
/ Hec Seuerus / And like as it apperyth by these words / And also he
wytnessyth him self / He suffered many persecutours / and detractours / which
persecucions he suffered pacyently and goodly / as it apperid in an Epistle that
he sent to asselle / I give thankynges to our lord god / that I am worthy
that the world hate me / And that wicked men and Ianglers hold me for euylle /
For I know well that men come to heaven by the dyffame of wicked men / more than
by good renommee / And I would that the company of myscreauntes should pursewe
and persecute me for the name and right of our lord / My will is that the
repreef of the world arise more fervently against me / so that I might
deserve to be preysed of our lord / and that I may hope the reward of his
promise / Temptacyon is desirous and agreeable / whoos merit in resystynge is
to be hoped reward of Christ in heaven / Ne the cursynge / ne malediction is not
grievous which is changed in to dyuyne laud and praysynge / He deyed about
the year of our lord CCC / lxxx / and eyghte /

Thus ends the life of saint Iheromme
Here follows the life of seint Remyge And first of his name
REmyge is said of Remige / that is a boteman or a rower / Or hit is said of
Remys / which ben Instruments / by which the ship is rowed and conduyted /
and of gyon / that is to say wrastlynge / He governed the Church / and kept
it fro paryll of wrake and brought it to the port of heaven And for the church
he wrastlyd against the assaults of the deuylle /

Of saint Remyge
SAint Remyge conuertid to the faith the king and the peuple of France / The
king had a wife named Rotilde which was Christian / And she enforced her much
to convert her husbond to the Christian faith / but she might not / And when she
had a child She would have Crystened him / But the king deffended it to her
/ And she rested not / til at the last the king granted that it should be
christian / And after that it was cristened / it deyde anon / Then said the
king / Now hit apperith well / that Christ is a vile god / for by cause he may
not keep him / which in his faith should have been enhau^ced in my kingdom
after me / And she said to him / Now feel I well that I am louyd of my god / by
cause he has received the first fruit of my womb he has enhaunced to a
better kingdom my sone / and to regne perpetuelly with outen end / which is
much better than thy kingdom is / And soo^e after she conceived again / and
had a fair sone / whom with great prayers she baptized as she did the first /
but anon after he was seek / so that they had none hope of his life / And
then the king said to his wife / Certeynly this is a feeble god / which may
not co^serue ne keep none that is baptized in his name / And if thou had a
thousand / and dydest them to be baptized / al should perisshe / yet nevertheless
the child reuyued and was hole / so that he reigned after his fader / And the
faithful queen enforced her to bring her husbond to the faith / but he
reffused it in all manners / It is said in that other feste which is after
thepyphanye / how the king was conuertid to the faith And the foresaid king
Clouys when he was crystened said that he would give to saint Remige for tendowe
his church / as much land as he might go about whiles he slepte at mydday /
And so it was done / but there was a man / which had a mylne within the
circuyte / which saint Remyge had closed / And as saint Remyge went about
it / the Mylnar putted him out with indignacion and great despyte / And saint
Remyge said to him / friend have no desdayne / and late it not be to hard if
we have also this Mylne / with that other / Nevertheless the Mylnar put him out
/ And anon the whele of the Mylne began to torn contrary / And then the
Mylnar cried after saint Remyge and said / Servant of god / come and late us
have the mylle to gydre / And saint Remyge said / nay hit shall neither be mine
ne ^hyn / And anon the earth opened / and swolewed in all the mylle /

And saint Remyge knew by the spyrite of prophecye / and by the will of god /
that a great famyne should come / And assembled in a Town great plente of whete
/ And the dronken Vylayns of the Town mocqued and scorned him of his
prouydence / And set the garners a fire / And when he knew hit / he came
thither / And by cause he was cold for age / and his last time approchyd fast /
he satte down by the fire / and warmed him / and said with a peasyble heart /
the fire is alwey good / Nevertheless they that made that fire / and all the
men of their lygnage were broken in her members / And the wymmen gowty / And
this endured in the same Town unto the time of Charles / which chaced and
maade them goo their way and so disperplyd them / And it is to be known /
that the feste of saint Remyge that is hallowed in Ianyuer / is the feste of his
blessed death and deposicion / and this is the feste of the translacion of his
blessed body / For when after his death the holy body should have be brought to
the church of saint Thymothe / and Appollynare with the shryne / and came nyghe
unto the church of saint Cristofre / it began to weye so much / that they
might not meue hit fro thens in no manner / At the last they prayed our lord /
that he would vouchesauf to show them if it were his will that the body should
be buried in that church / where as no relyques rest / And then anon they
took up the body lyghtely ynowe / and buried him there honorably / And many
miracles were there showed / so that they enlarged / and made the church more
ample and large / And then they made an oratoyre behind the altar / and
would have do l^^en for to have leyd the body in that oratoyre / but they couthe
not meue hit in no manner / Then they watched / and prayed unto our lord /
and at mydnyght they fylle all a sleep / And on the morn they fond the
sepulcre with the body in the place / which angels had borne thider / while
they slepte / And this was the k lendes of octobre / which afterward by long
time on the same day it was translated in to a feretre or shryne of silver /
he flowrid about the years of our lord CCCC four score and ten /

Thus ends the translacion of saint Remyge
Here follows the life of seint Logier And first of his name
LOgier is said of leos that is to say people / and of ganos that is to say
angel Logyer was aungel of the people / For an angel is propyrly light And is a
messagyer for to show the peuple good works / And so he showed to the people
to fore the deed / hou he and Ebronyen should fynysshe their lives

Of saint Logyer
LOgyer when he shone and resplendyd in all virtue he deserved to be Bishop of
Aduense Clotayre was deed he was much grieved for the cure and charge of the
Royamme / And by the will of god and counsel of the princes he crowned
Childryck yet young to be king / But Ebronyen would have made Theoderyck brother
of Childryck king / not for the prouffyte of the Royamme / but by cause he was
put out of his power / and was hated of all the people / And doubted the Ire
of the king and of the princes / And therefore he required of the king license
for to enter in to Relygyon / And the king granted it to him / Then the
king did hold his brother the oderich in guard that he should machyne nothing
ageynste the Royamme / And by the holiness and prouydence of the good Bishop
Logyer all the people were in joy and in pees / And soon after the king
being enpayred by euylle counceylle was meuyd in wrath against this holy Bishop servant of god / And sought menes ententyfly how he might couenably
putt him to death / But Logyer suffered all goodly / and reputed his enemies like
as his friends / and did so much toward the king / that on eester day / he
should sing mass in the cite / whereof he was a bishop / And that day it was
told to him / that the king should perform yt night all that he had treted for
his death / but he ne doubted nothing / but dyned that day with the king at his
own table / And then he fled his persecutour / in such manner that he
went to the monasterye of Lucon there serving our lord / in which Ebronyen
there was hyd in thabyte of a (...) And also served him in great charity And a
while after the king deyde / And Theoderyche was enhaunced in to the regne /
For which thing the blessed saint Logyer meued by the wepynges and teeres of
the people / and constrained by the commandment of his abbot / returned
unto his see in his Cite / But Ebronyen anon renou^ced his relygyon / And was
ordained steward of the king / And how be it that he was euylle to fore yet he
was worse after / And studied how he might bring Logyer to death / And sent
knights for to take him / And when the blessed Logyer knew it / he would have
escaped fro their woodenes / and malice / And as he issued out of the Town in
thabyte of a Bishop / He was taken of the knights / which anon put out his
eyes / And then two year after saint Logyer with gu^ryn his brother whom
Ebronyen had exyled were brought unto the palace of the king / And as
Ebronyen mocqued the bishop / they answered wisely and peasybly / Not
wythstondynge that wicked man Ebronyen sent gu^ryn for to be stoned to death
with stones And made the Bishop to be ladde all the night bare foot upon
sharp stones / on which the water ran fast / And when he herd that he
preysed god in his torments he made to cut out the tongue of his heed / and
after to keep in prison / for to make him suffer new torments / But for all
that / he lost never his speech / but intended to preche and to exhortacion as
well as he might / And said to fore / how he and Ebronyen should deye / and when
/ Then a great light in manner of a crown enuyronned his heed / which
much people saw / And sum demanded him what thing hit was / And he kneled
down / and made his prayers yeldynge graces to god / And admonested all them
that were there / that they should change their life in to a better / And when
Ebronyen herd that he had great envy at him / And sent four men for to smite
of his head And when they led him forth / he said to them / It is no need
to you to labor any more / but fulfylle ye here the desire of him that sent
you / And then three of them had so great pity of him / that they kneled down
/ and required pardon / And the fourth smote of his head / which anon was
rauysshed of the deuylle / and thrown in the fire ended his life myserably /
Then two year after Ebronyen herd that god showed many miracles for his
blessed saint / and the renomme of it shone over all / and was tormentid with
cursyd envy / and sent thither a knight to wete the truth / and to return
and tell to him / And when the knight came thither / he prowdly smote the tomb
with his foot / and said / an euylle death mote he have / that says and
byleueth / that this deed body may do miracles / And anon he was rauysshed
of the deuylle and deyde suddenly / And the saint was the more worshyped by his
death / And when Ebronyen herd this / he was then more tormentid with malice
of envy / and enforced to quench the fame of the holy saint / but after the
saying to fore of the saint / he felonnously slew him self with a swerd / And
this holy bishop saint Logyer suffered death about the year of our lord / vjC /
lxxx in the time of Constantyn the fourth /

Thus ends the life of saint Logier
Here follows the life of saint Fraunceis first begynner of the Freres mynours
And first of his name
FRaunceis was first named Johan / but after his name was changed / and was
called Fraunceys / The cause of chaungynge of his name was manyfold / First for
the reason of his merueylous chaungynge / For it is known that he received of
God by miracle the frensshe tongue / And it is said in his legende that when
he was replenysshed of the grace of god and of thardoure of the holy ghooste
he pronounced out brennynge words in Frensshe / Secondly by the reason to
publysshe his office / whereof is said in his legende / that the dyuyne prouyden
gaf to him that name by cause of him synguler / And is acustomed name /
thoppynyon of this mysterye was known thorugh out all the world / Thyrdly by
reason of his office in effect / wheruppon was given to understand that by him
/ and by his sons he should make many servants of the deuylle and bond to
sin free / Fourthly by reason of great courage / and magnanymyte of heart /
For frensshe men ben said of fyersnes / For in them is naturell fyersnes and
great c^rage of heart / Fyftly by reason of the vertuosyte in speaking / For
his word keruyd away the vices like an axe Sixtely by reason that he chaced
awey comnnely the deuyls / Seventhly by reason of honest in his conuersacyon /
and of perfection of work / And it is said that sum signs that were brought
to Rome / to fore the Consuls / which were in terror of the people and in
worship were called Franciscas /

Of saint Fraunceis
FRaunceis servant and friend of Almighty god / was borne in the Cite of
Assyse / and was maade a Merchant unto the xxv year of his age / and wasted
his time by living vaynly / whom our lord corrected by the scorge of sekenes /
and suddenly changed him in to another man / so that he began to shine by
the spyryte of prophecye / For on a time he with other men of peruse was taken
prisoner And were put in a cruel prison / where all the other waylled and
sorowed And he only was glad and enjoyed And when they had repreuyd him
thereof / he answered / know ye / said he that I am ioyeful / For I shall be
worshipped as a saint thorugh out all the world / On a time he went to Rome
by cause of devotion / And he took of all his clothes / and cladde him with
the clothes of a beggar / and satt among the pour men to fore the church of
saint Peter / And as one of them begged with hem coueytously / And much
oftener would have done / but the shame of known people let him

The old enemy the deuylle enforced him to let him of his holy purpos And
showed to him a woman monstrous and horrybly diffygured / croke bak and lame /
which was in that Cite / And he said to him / that he left not that he had
enterprysed / he would make him semblable and like unto her / But he was
comforted of our lord which herd a voys saying to him Fraunceys take these
bitter things for the sweet / and despise thy self / if thou desire to know
me / On a time he met a lepre / whom naturelly men abhor / but he
remembryd him of the word that was said of god / and ran to him and kyssed
him / And anon the lazare vanysshed away / wherefore he went to thabytacion of
the lazars / And kyssed deuoutely their hands and gaf to them money / And
let hem have no need of such as he myte do / On a time he entryd in to the
Church of saint Damyan for to make his prayers / And thymage of Ihesu Christ
spak unto him and said Frau^ceis goo and repair my hows / which is all
destroyed as thou see / And from that hour / the soul of him lyquefyed /
And the passion of Ihesu Christ was merueylously infyxed in his heart / And
then he did great pain / and was besy in repayryng the church / And sold
all that he had / and gaf the money thereof to a preeste And he durst not
receive hit / for fere of his parents and kynne / Then he casting it awey
to fore the preeste as dust setting not thereby / wherefore he was taken of his
fader and bounden / and restored to him his money / And resygned also his
clothes / and so naked he fled to our lord / and clad him with hair / And
then the blessed Fraunceys went unto a simple man / whom he took instead
of his fader / and prayed him that like as his fader doublyd on him his curses /
that in contrary he should bless him / his own brother germayn saw him in a
winter time have on him but foul and few clothes / and that he tremblid for
cold / and was entendynge to his prayers said to his felawe / Goo to Fraunceys
/ and say to him that he selle to the a penyworthe of his swote / And when
he herd it / he answered with a glad chere / I will selle hit unto my lord god
/ On a day he herd in the church that which our lord said to his discyples
when he sent them to preche / And anon he adressyd him with all his might
to do and keep all tho things / he did of his hosyn and shone fro his feet /
and clad him with a foul cote / and took a cord for his gyrdle / He went on
a time in a snow by a wood / and was taken by thieves / and they demanded him
what he was / And he said that he was the messager of god / And anon they took
him / and cast him in the snow / saying to him / lie thou there vilayn
messager of god / Many noble and unnoble clerks and lay men had despised
the world and begone to follow him / And the holy father enseygned and taught
them the perfection of the gospel / which was for to be in pouerte / and that
they should go by the wey of symplenesse / / he wrote then a rule after the
gospel to him self / and his brethren had and to be had / which pope Innocent
confermed / And fro than forthon he began to sprede more ardauntly the seeds
of the word of god / and went about cytees / and castles by a fervent and
merueylous desire / There was a Friar / which seemed outward of merueylous
holiness and kept scylence so straytly / that he would not be shryuen by words
but by signs / and every man preysed him as a saint / this holy man Fraunceis
came thither / and said / leave ye brethren to preyse him / for I shall not yet
preyse him / lest it be by fayntyse of the deuylle / late him be warned to be
shryuen twyes in the weke by word and speaking / And if he do it not / this
is but temptacion of the deuylle / and fraudelous deceyte / and then the
freres warned him so to do / and he put his fyngre to his mouth / and shoke
his heed / and showed that in no wise he would confess him / And anon after
he returned again to worldly life as an hound to his vomyte / And went out
of his order / and fynysshed his life in synful acts and works / On a time
saint Fraunceis was weary of going / and rood upon an ass And his felawe one
Leonard of Assyse was also weary of going / and saint Frau^ceis biganne to
think thus / and say in him self / his kynne and my kynne were not like / And
incontinent he alyghte down and said to the Friar / It apperteyneth not to me
to ride / and the to goo afoote / For thou art more noble than I am / And the
Friar was abashed and kneled down and required pardon / On a time as he
passed by a place / a noble lady ran so hastily ageynste him that she might
not speak for werynes / And he axed of her / what she would / and she said /
pray for me / fader For I may not perform the purpoos of health / which I
have bigonne / for my husbond which lets me / does to me many aduersytees
in the service of god / and he said to her / goo thy way daughter / For thou
shall have anon comfort of him / And say to thyn / husbond in gods name and
mine / that now is the time of health / And herafter shall be time of equity and
right And when she had said so to her husbond / the man was suddenly changed
and auowed to god contynence and chastyte / On a time a pour labourer was
almost lost in a wood for thurst And this holy saint impetred a fontayne by
his preyers / He said on a time to a Friar / that was famylyer with him / this
secret / which was showed to him by the holy ghost / There is a servant of
God living in the world on this day / For whoos sake as long as he shall live
our lord shall suffer no famyne among the people / but without doubt it is
said / that when he was deed all that condition was changed to the contrary
/ For after his blessid death / he apperyd to the same friar / and said to him
loo now is the famyne comen / which as long as I lived upon earth / our lord
would not suffer to come / On an eester day the Freres greeks that were in
desert had leyd their table more curyously than in an other time / And had
made ready the glasses / and set them on the lord / And when saint Fraunceis
saw that / he anon withdrewe him / and sat on his head the hat of a pour man
which was there / and bare his staf in his hand / and went out and abode at
the gate / And when the fre^s ete at dinner / he cried at the door that they
should give for the love of god an alms to a pour seek man / Then the
pour man was callid in / And entrid and satte down allone upon the earth and
set his dysshe in the dust / which when the Freres saw / they were abashed
and were sore aghast / And he said to them / I see the table arrayed and aourned
/ And I know well that it is not for pour men that seek their mete fro door
to door / he loved pouerte in him self / and in all other / so that he called
alwey pouerte his lady But when he saw one more pour than him self / he had
thereof envy / and doubted to be overcome of him / On a day / he saw a pour
woman / and he showed her to his felawe and said the pouert^ of this woman
does to us shame / and repreueth strongly our pouerte / For for my Rychesses I
have chosen my lady pouerte / And she shyneth more in this woman than in me /
when on a time a pour man passid to fore him / and the holy man was meuyd
with inward compassion / his felawe said to him / though this man be pour /
parauenter there is not a rycher of his will in all the prouynce / Then
saint Fraunceis said to him Anon despoylle the of thy cote / and give it to
the pour man / and knowleche thy self culpable / and knele down to his feet /
To whom anon he obeyed and did so / On a time three wymmen like of vysage and
all things and of habit entrid and met him and salewed in this manner /
Welcome my lady pouerte and anon they vanysshed awey / and were no more seen /
On a time as he came to the cite of Arete / and a mortal bataylle was meuyd in
the Cite / This holy man saw upon the burgh on the ground the deuyls making
joy and were glad / Then he called his felawe named Syluestre / and said to
him / go to the yate of the Cite / And command to these deuyls in gods name
that is almighty / that they go out of the Cyte^ Then he went hastily and
ceyed strongly / Al ye deuyls / depart from hens in the name of god / and by
the commandment of Fraunceis on^e fader / And they went awey / And then
the Cytezeyns anon bycam to accord / The foresaid Syluester when he was yett
a seculer priest he saw in his sleep a golden Cross issue out of the mouth
of saint Fraunceis / of the which the over end touched heaven / and the arms
of the Cross stratched fro that one to that other part of the world / Then
this priest had conpunction / and left the world / and followed perfightely
this holy man saint Fraunceis / and on a time as this holy man was in prayer /
the devil callid him thryes by his own name / and when the holy man had
answered him / he said / none in this world is so great a synnar but if he
convert him / our lord would pardone him / But who that sleeth him self by hard
penance / shall never find mercy / And anon this holy man knew by the
reuelacion the fallace and deceyte of the fend / how he would have withdrawn
him for to do well / and when the devil saw that he might not prevail
against him He tempted him by grievous temptacion of the flesh / and when this
holy servant of god felt that / he despoyllid of his clothes / and beat him
self right hard with an hard cord saying / Thus brother Ass / it behooves the
to remain and to be beten / and when the temptacion departed not / he went
out / and plonged him self in the snow al naked / and made seven great balls
of snow / and purposed to have taken them in to his body / and said / this
grettest is thy wife / and of these four two ben thy daughters / ^ and two thy
sons and the other tweyne that one thy cha^berer / and that other thy varlet
or yema^ haste the and clothe them / For they al deye for cold / and if thy
besynes that thou have about them grieve the sore / Then serve our lord
parfightely / and anon the devil departed from them al confused / and saint
Fraunceis retournyd again in to his celle / gloryfyeng god / And as he dwelled
on a time with Leon the cardynal of saint Cross in a night the devils came to
him / and beat him right grievously Then he called his felawe / and said to
him / these ben deuyls Iaylers of our lord / whom he sends to punysshe the
excesses / but I can remember me of none offencis that I have done / but by ye
mercy of god I have washed them awey by satisfaction / But parauenture he has
sent me them / by cause he will not suffer me to fall / by cause I dwell in
the Courts of greet lords / which thing perauentur engenders not good
syspection / to my right pour brethren / which suppose I habounde in delyces
/ And erly in the morning he aroos and departed thens / On a time as he was in
his prayers / he saw vpoon the covering of the hows assembles and companyes
of deuyls / which ran hyder and thither with great noise / And he went out
/ and signed him with the sign of the Cross and said / I say to you in the
name of almighty god / that ye deuylles do to my body / all that is suffrid to
you to do / And I shall suffer hit pacyently / For I have no gretter enmye
than my body / and ye shall avenge me of mine aduersarye / whiles ye take on hit
vengeance by my life / then they vanysshed awey al confused / There was a
Friar / which was felaw of saint Fraunceis was on a time rauysshed / and saw
in spyryte the glorious place in heaven / wherein he saw among other seetes a
right noble seete shynynge of more noble glory / than the other / And as he
merueyled / for whom this noble syege or sete was kept / he herd / that it
was said / that this sete longed sometime to one of the princes that fylle / And
is now made ready to the meke and humble Fraunceys / And when saint Fraunceys
issued fro his prayers / that friar demanded him / Fader / what wenest thou of
thy self / And he said / I wene that I am grettest of all sinners / And anon
the spyryte came in to the heart of the friar / and said / behold / what was
the vysion that thou saw / Fro humylyte shall lift up the most meke man
unto the sete lost by pride / This holy man saint Fraunceis saw in a vysion
above him Seraphyn crucyfyed / the whicehe emprynted in him the signs of his
crucyfyenge / that him seemed that he was crycyfyed / and that in his hands /
his feet and in his side him seemed were the sign of the wou^des of the
crucyfyeng / but he did hyde these tokenes / as much as he might / that
noman should see them / And yet nevertheless sum saw them in his life / and at
his death / they were seen of many / and were showed by many miracles that tho
signs were true / Of which miracles tweyne shall suffyse for to be set
here / There was a man named Rogyer / and was in puylle to fore thymage of
saint Fraunceis / And began to think and say / may this be true that this
man was so ennobled by such miracle / or was this an illusion / or an
Inuencion dissimyled of his brethren the Freres / And as he thought this / he
herd suddenly a sown like as a quarrel had he shot out of Arbalaste / or a
Cross bow / and he felt him grievously hurt in his lift hand / but there
appyeryd no hurt in his glove / And then he took of his glove / and saw in
the palm of his hand a wound as it had been of an arowe / out of which
wound there issued so great pain of ache and brennynge / that almoost he
deyde for sorrow and pain / And then he repented him and said / that he
byleuyd right verily the signs and toknes of saint Fraunceis / and when he
had praid by tw^ days saint fraunceis by his holy signs and stygmates he
was anon delyueryd of his pain and maade al hoole / In the Royamme of Castyle
there was a man devout to saint Fraunceis / which went on a time to Complyne
to the church of saint Fraunceis / And men lay in a wait for to slay him /
and instead of another man he was taken by error and ignorance / and was
wounded / and left as half deed / And after the cruel morderer stycked his
swerd in his throat / and left it therein / and might not draw it out / but
went his way / And then men cried and ran hyder and thither / and the man
was bewailed / like as he had been deed / And when they ronge to matyns at
mydnyght at the church of the Freres / the wife of the man began to cry Arise
up sire / and goo to matyns / For the belle calls the / And anon he lift up
his hand to show / that some man should take awey the sword fro his throat /
And anon in the sit of them all / the swerd sprange out a far as it had be
thrown of a strong Champyon / And anon the man arose parfyghtely hole / And
said that saint Fraunceys came to him / and joined his stygmates to my wounds /
and enoynted them with the swetenes of his signs / and sewyd them to gydre
merueylously by his towchynge / And when he would have gone / I showed him /
that he should take aweye the swerd / For else I should not conne speak / And
anon he took it out / And threw it awey far from him / And heled me with
touching my throat with his signs /

The two clerks great lumynayres of the world / that is to say saint Domynyke
/ and saint Fraunceys were in the Cite of Rome to fore the Lord hostyence /
which afterward was pope of Rome / And this Bishop said to them / wherefore
make ye not of your freres Bisshops and prelates / which should prevail more
by techynge and example gyuynge / And there was long contencion between them /
who should first answer / And Humylyte ouercam Fraunceys that he would not
speak to fore that other / And then saint Domynyk humbly obeyed / and said /
Sire our brethren ben left up in good degree. if they know hit / And I /
shall never suffer to my power / that ever they shall hope to have any hyer
dygnyte / After that answered saint Fraunceys / Sire my Brethren ben called
Mynours / by cause they would not be made gretter / And the blessed saint
Fraunceys full of right great symplycyte admonested and warned all creatures to
love their Creator / he preached to birds / and was herd of hem / they suffryd
him to touch ^ them / and without license they would not return ne flee fro
him / And on a time when he preached / the Swalowes chyteryd and song / And
anon by his commandment they were stylle / There was also on a time a bird on
a fygge tree beside his celle which sange often full swetely / And saint
Fraunceys put forth his hand / And called that bird / And anon the bird
obeyed / and came upon his hand / And he said to her / sing my suster / and
preyse thy lord / And then anon she song / And departed not tylle she had
license /

He spared to touch lyghtes / lamps / and Candels by cause he would not
defowle them with his hands / He went honorably upon the stones for the
worship of him that was called stone / He gadryd the small worms out of the
way / by cause they should not be trodden with the feet of them that passyd by
/ He commanded in winter to give honey unto bees that they should not perysshe
for hongre He called all beestes his Brethren / He was replenysshed of
merueylous Joy for the love of his Creatoure / He beheld the Son / the Moon
/ and the Sterres / And somoned them to the love of their Maker / He defended
for to make him a greet Crown / saying / I will / that my simple Brethren
have part in my head There was a Seculer man / which saw saint Fraunceis the
Servant of God prechynge at saint Seueryns / And saw by reuelacyon of God /
that saint Fraunceys was stratched on a Cross maade of two clear swerdes / Of
which that one came fro his heed / to his feet / And that other stratchyd
from that one hand to that other / so that he never had seen such a
demonstraunce / Then he was moeued in his heart / And entryd in to the order
/ And fynysshed goodly his life / On a time as saint Fraunceys was seek on his
eyes for contynuelle weeping / his Brethren said to him / that he should
refrain him fro weeping / And he answered / The vysytacyon of the light
perdurable / is not to be put away for the light that we have here with the
flies / And when his brethren constrained him to take a Medycyne for his
eyes / And the Surgeon held a brennynge iron in his hand / And the blessed
Fraunceys said / My brother Fire / be thou to me in this hour debonayre and
curable / I pray to our lord that made the that thou attempre my hete / And
then he made the sign of the Cross ageynste the fire / And the fyry iron
wat put in his tender flesh from his ere unto his eye lyddes / And he felt
no pain He was strongly seek in the deserte of saint urban / And when he
felt that nature faylled in him / he axyd for to drink wyn / And there was none
/ And they brought to him water / and he blessid it / and made the sign of the
Cross thereon / and it was conuertid / and turned in to right good wine / And
the holy man gate of our lord that the pouerte of the deserte might not get
/ And as soon as he had tasted it / he becam strong / and was all hoole / he
had lever here blame of him self than preysynge / And for by cause that the
peuple preysed in him any thing of merit of holiness / he commanded to sum
brother to say to him in his ere sum vylonnye in blaming him and defowlynge.

And when such a brother so constrained ageynste his will / called him
vylayne / Merchant and vnprouffytable fool / then was he glad / and
blessed him and said / god bless the / For thou say right very true words
/ And this thing apperteyneth to me for to here /

And this holy saint Fraunceis would never be more master ne governor / but
he would be more subgette / ne so command as obey / And therefore he left for
to be general / and demanded to be under the wardeyne / to whose will he alwey
submytted him self in all things / He promised alweye obedyence to the friar
with whom he went / and kept hit / When a Friar had done any thing
against the Rule of obedyence / and had sign of penance / yet this holy saint Fraunceis for to fere other commanded to cast the hode of him in to the
fire / And when it had been a while in the fire he commanded to take it out
and give it again to the Friar / And the hode was taken out of the fire
without hurt / He went on a time by the more of venyse / and fond there a
great multitude of birds singing And he said to his felawes / our susters
these birds give lawde to their maker / late us goo in the myddle of them /
and sing we our hours canonycals to our lord / and they entrid in among them
/ and they meued not but by cause they might not here each other for the
chyterynge and noise of birds / he said my susters birds / cease your song /
tylle we have yolden unto our lord due praysynges / And then they held hem
stylle / And when they had fynysshed their lawdes / He gaf to them license
to sing ageyn And anon they reprysed their song after their customme /

He was on a time herberowed with a knight / and saint Fraunceis said to him /
Brother fair hooste / Agree to that I shall say to the / Confess thy sins
/ For thou shall soon ete in an other place / And anon he granted that to
him / And ordained for his meyny / and took penance of health / And also
soon as they went to the table / the hooste deyde suddenly / On a time he
fond a great multitude of Birds / And then he said to them / My brethren
/ ye ought strongly to praise / and give lawde to your maker / while has
cladde you with feathers / And has given to you pens for to flee / And has
granted you the purete of the air / and governed you with out charge or
business / And the birds turned their beckes or bylles to him / and spradde
their wynghes / and stratchyd their necks and adressyd their hedes / and
beheld him ententyfly / And he passyd forth by the myddle of them so nyghe
that he towchyd them with his cote / And none of them aroos out fro his place
/ tylle he gaf to hem leave / that they flewhe to gyder / On a time when he
preached at the Castelle Almarye / And he might not be herd for the Swalowes /
which maade their nestes / To whom he said / My sustres Swalowes / hit is
time / that I speak / For ye have said enough / be ye now stylle / till the
word of god be accomplysshed / And they obeyed / and were stylle anon /

And this holy man saint Fraunceis passed thorugh puylle / he fond in his way
a purs full of money / and when his felawe saw it / he would have taken it for
to have given it to the pour people / but he would not suffer him in no manner /
and said to him / Sone it apperteyneth not to the to take the goods of others
/ And when his felaw hasted to take it / saint Fraunceys prayed a little / and
after commanded him to take the purs / which then fond therein a great
addre instead of money / And when the Friar saw that / he began to double
/ but he would obey / and took the purs in his hondes / And there sprange out
anon a serpent venomous / And then saint Fraunceys said to him / Money is
no^ne other thing to the servants of god / but the deuylle / which is a
serpent venomous / There was a Friar grievously tempted / and he began to think
/ that if he had any thing wreton with the hand of their fader saint frau^ceis
that that temptacion should be chaced awey anon / but he durst in no wise
discouere this thing / On a time saint Fraunceys called him and said / Sone
bring to me perchemyn and ynke / For I will write sum preysyng to god / And
when he had wreton he said Take this chartre / and keep it unto the day of thy
death dylygently / And anon all his temptacion went awey

And the same Friar when saint Fraunceis lay seek / began to think Our
fader approaches the death / And if I might have after his death his cot^ I
should be gretely comforted / And after this the saint called him / and said / I
give to the this my cot^ if thou have thereto after my death plain right / He
was lodged on a time in Allexandre in lombardye. with an honest man / which
demanded him / if for thobseruaunce of the gospelle / he should ete of all
that which was set to fore him / And he consentid to the douocion of the
hooste / And then the host did do make ready a capon of seven year old /
and as they ete / there came an untrue man / which demanded alms for the
love of god / And anon when this blessid man herd that blessid name / he sent
to him a membre of the capon / and the cursyd man kept it / And on the morn
when the holy man prechid / he showed that pyece of the capon and said / Loo
see here / what flesh this Friar eteth / whom ye honor as a saint / For he
gaf hit to me yester even / but this pyece of the capon was seen of all the
people as it were fysshe / And that man was blamed of all the people / and said
that he was mad / And when he understood it / he was ashamed / and
demanded pardon / And when this man came again to his good thought the flesh
returned again to his own kind / and form / On a time as he satt at the
table / and collacion was made of the pouerte of the blessid vyrgyne our lady /
anon saint Fraunceis aroos / and began to weep and sobbe sorowfully / so
that his vysage was al wete of teeres / And began to ete the remenaunt of his
breed upon the ground He would also that right great reverence should be done
to the hands of prestes / To whom was given power to sacre the blessid
sacrament of our lord And then he said often / if it happed me to mete any
saint coming fro heaven / and also a pour priest / I would first goo kiss the
prestes hands / and would say to the saint / holy saint abide a while / For
the hands of this priest have handled the sone of life / and has performed a
thing above humanyte / He was ennoblyd in his life by many miracles / For the
breed that was brought to him to bless gaf health to many seek men / he
^^nuertid the water in to win / of which a seek man tasted / and reuyued anon
health And also did many other miracles / And when his last days aporochyd /
And was greuyd by long infyrmyte then he made him self to be leyd upon the
bare ground / And did do call all the Freres that were there / And when
they were all present / he blessed them / And like as our lord fed his
disciples at souper in sherthursdaye / he gaf to each of them a morselle of
breed / And warned them / as he was woned to do / to give lawde to their maker
/ And the very death which is to all men horrible and hatefulle / he
admonested them to preyse it / And also he warned and admonested death to come
to him / and said / Death my suster welcome be thou And when he came at the
last hour / he slepte in our lord / Of whom a Friar saw the soul in manner
of a sterre like to the moon in quantyte and to the son in clerenes /

There was a Friar named Augustyn which was mynystre and servant in the
land of labor of the earth / And as he was in his last end / and had lost
his speech / he escryed suddenly and said / abide me Fader / abide / I shall
goo with the / Then the Freres demanded him what he said / And he said / See
ye not our Fader Fraunceys that goth unto heaven / And anon he slepte in pees
/ and followed his holy fader / A lady which had be devout to the blessed
Frau^ceys deyed / and the Clerks and prestes were at the byere for to sing
thexequyes of her / she aroos up suddenly of the biere / and called one of the
priests / that were there / and said / fader I would confess me / I was deed /
and should have be put in a cruelle prison / by cause I had not shryuen me of
a sin that I shall say / But saint Fraunceys prayed for me / that this
confessyd and showed I shall have foryeuenesse / And anon as I shall have
said and confessyd hit to the / I shall rest in pees to fore you all / And
then she was confessyd and assoylled / and rested anon in our lord / The
Freres of Vyterbe would have borrowed a carte of a man / And he answered in
despyte / I had lever see two of you flayn with saint Fraunceys / than I should
leave you my carte / but he came again to him self / and repreuyd him self / and
repentyd him of the blame that he had said / and doubted the Ire of god / And
anon his sone was seek / and deyde / And when he saw his sone deed / he
slepte on the earth weeping / and called saint Frau^ceis / and said / I am he /
that sinned thou sholdest have beten me / give ayene to me / holy saint
prayenge d^uoutely to the / whom thou have taken away fro me blaming the /
and blasphemynge wyckedly / And anon his sone reuyued and said / when I was
deed / saint Fraunceys ladde me by a long way and derke / And at last he
brought me unto a right fair grene / And after said to me / Return to thy
fader / I will no longer hold the / There was a pour man which ought unto a
certain Rich man a quantyte of moneye^ And prayed him for the love of saint
Fraunceys he would prolonge the term of payment / To whom he answered prowdely
/ I shall set the in such a place / that neither Fraunceys ne none other
shall help the / And anon he took / and bond him / and set him in a derke
prison / And anon after saint Frau^ceis came thither and bracke up the prison
and losed his bonds / and brout the man al saufly to his own hows / There was
a knight which detracted the works and miracles of saint fraunceys / and on
a time as he played at the dies / he being all araged and full of woodenes
and cruelnes said to them that stood by him / if saint Fraunceis be a saint /
late come eyghten on the dies / And anon came in three dies in each of hem six
/ and so it apperyd nine times / at every time three sixes / at each cast /
And then he adioustyng woodenes to wodenes he said ysit be true yt frau^ceis
be a saint late a swerd ryue me through my body this day / And if he be no saint
/ that it escape saufly / And when the playenge at dies was ended / by cause he
had made that prayer in sin / he said Iniurye to his neuewe / And he took
his swerd / and stack it through belie and slew him anon /

There was a man that hade lost his thye that he couthe not moeue hit

And cried to saint Fraun^^is thus saying / help me saint fraceis / remember
the of the devotion and of the seruyse that I have done to the / For I carried
the upon mine ass / and kyssed thy feet / and thy hondes / And now I deye for
pain of this right hard tormente / Then the holy man appyeryd to him with a
litille staf that he held / which had the sign of thau / and touchyd
therewith the place of his pain / and the postume bracke / and received anon
full health / but the sign of thau abode alwey in the same place / with that
sign saint Fraunceys was wont always to sign his lettres / There was a maid
which duellyd in the Montaynes of puylle in a castle / and her fader and mother
ne had but only this daughter / And she deyde / And her mother was much devout
toward saint fraunceis / But then she was full of heaviness / And saint
Fraunceys appyeryd to her / and said / weep no more for the light of thy
lantern is quenchyd And it apperteyneth not that I yield her again to the by
thy prayer / But yet the mother had affyaunce and trust in the saint / And would
not suffer to bear awey the body / but in calling saint Fraunceis she took her
daughter that was deed / and raised her up alive and hoole / There was a little
child in Rome fallen out of a wyndowe to the ground / and deyde forthwythe /
And they called to saint Fraunceys for help / and he was anon restored to life
/ In a cite of Swetse hit happened / that an hows fylle / and slew a child And
when they had putt the corpse in a chyste for to berye / the mother called on
saint Fraunceys with all her devotion / And about mydnyght the child cowhyd /
and aroos all hoole / And began to preyse god / Friar James of Reaten had
passyd a floode in a vesselle with other Freres which were set a land / and
he hasted so sore after to goo out / by cause he was last / and the ship
recuyeled backward in to the water / so that he fylle down in to the deppest
of the flood / And then all the Freres prayde saint Fraunceys for him / And
he him self as he might with like devotion callid the holy saint unto his aid
and help in his heart / And that same Friar began to goo in the bottom of
the water as dry as he had gone on the earth / and caught the boat which was
drowned / and brought hit to the bank / and came up without wetynge of his
clothes / that he ware / Ne nener drope of water touchyd his cote ne wette no
thing on him / Then late us deuoutely pray this holy father saint Fraunceis
to be our socoure and aid in our aduersytees and peryllys / and help that by
his merytes we may after this short life come in to everlasting life in heaven /
Amen

Thus ends the life of saint Fraunceis
Here follows the life of saint Pelagyeune And first of her name
PElagyenne is said of pelagus / which is as much to say / as the sea / For
in the Sea all waters habounde / In like wise habounded she in the Sea of this
world / of all Rychesses / and of delyces / She was the Sea of Inyquyte / and
the flood of sins / but she plonged after in the Sea of teeres / And weesshe
her in the Flood of baptysme /

Of saint Pelagienne
PElagyenne was the formest and noblest of the wymmen of Antyoche fulle of
Rychesses in all things She was right fair of body / noble of habyte / vain
and varyable of courage and not chaste of body / On a time as she went thorugh
the Cite with great pride and ambycion / that there was no thing seen on her /
but gold and silver and precious stones / And oueral where as she went / she
filled thayer with diverse odours / and sweet smellys / And to fore and after
her went a great multitude of young men / and maidens / which were also clad
with right noble vesture and rich / And an holy father / which was named
^onnon bishop of leopoleos / which now is called daunete / passyd thorugh the
Cite / and saw her / Then he began to weep right bytterly / by cause she
had more cure to plese the world / than she had to plese god / And then
fylle down upon the pamente / and smote therthe with his vysage / and wette it
with his t^erys / and said / O most hyhe god / have pity on me synnar / the
adourneme^t and array of one common woman has surmounted in one day all the
wisdom of all my life / O lord late not tharray of one woman of folly
co^fou^de me tofore the sight of thy dredefull mageste / She has arrayed her
self with hyhe study / and all her might for erthely things / And I had
purposed lord to have pleased the / but I have not accomplysshyd it / by cause
of my neclygence / Then he said to them / that were with him / In truth I
say to you / that god shall set this woman in wytnes against us in the dome
/ by cause that she so besyly paynteth her for to plese worldly friends and
lovers / And when we ben neclygent for to please the heavenly spouse our
lord god / And when he had said these or semblable words / He fylle
sodanly a sleep / And him seemed that a foul douue or black culuer flewhe about
him / whiles he was at mass at altar / And when he commanded / that they
that were not baptized should depart and goo their way / this douue departed
anon / and came again after the mass / and was plungyd in a vessel full of
water / and went out all clean and white / and flewhe up so high / that she
might not be seen / And then he awoke / On a time when he preached in a
church Pelagyenne was present / She then becam so repentaunt that she sent
him a lettre by a messager thus saying / To the holy Bishop of Ihesu Christ /
Pelagyenne disciple of the deuylle / et cetera if thou art verily the disciple
of Ihesu Christ / the which as I have herd said descended from heaven for the
sinners / Vouchesauf to receive me repentaunt synful woman / To whom the
Bishop sent again / I pray the not to tempte my humylyte / For I am a
synfulle man / if thou desyrest to be saved / thou may not see me allone /
but among other men thou shall see me / Then she came to him to fore many /
and took his feet / And most bytterly weeping she said / I am Pelagyenne /
the Sea of Inyquyte / Flood of sins / the Swalowe of perdycyon / And the
deuourer of sowles / I have deceived many by deceytes / which now all I
abhor / Then the Bisshoppe demanded her / saying / what is thy name / She
said / I have be called fro my birth / Pelagyenne / But for the pomp of my
clothing / men call me Margaryte / Then the Bishop received her benyngnly
/ and enjoined to her helthfull penance / And informed her in the dread of god
dylygently / And Regenered her by holy baptism / The deuylle then cried
there / saying / O what vyolence I suffer of this old servant of God / O
vyolence / O euylle old age / acursyd be the day / in which thou were born
contrary to me / For thou have taken aweye my grettest hope / On a night whiles
Pelagyenne slepte / the deuylle came to her / and awoke her / and said / Lady
Margaryte / what harm did I ever to the / have I not aourned the in all
Rychesses / and in all glory / I pray the / tell me / wherynne I have
angryd the / and I shall amend it anon / I require the leave me not / lest I
be made reproach unto the Christian people / and then she blessid her / and blew
on him / And the deuylle vanysshed away / And the third day after she assembled
all the goods that she had / and gaf hit to the pour people for the the love
of god / And a little while after she fled awey by night without knowledge of
any person / and took thabyte of an heremyte / and set her self in a little
celle / and there served our lord in much great abstynence / and was of much
great and good renommee unto all the people / and ladde a right holy life /
and good. And was called brother Pelagyen / After a Deken of the same bishop /
that had baptized her went to Iherusalem for to vysyte there the holy places
/ Then that bishop said to him / that after the vysytacion of the holy
places / he should see he a Monk that was named pelagyen / and that he should
vysyte him / For he should find there the true servant of our lord / And so
he did / And anon she knew him / but he knew her not for the great lenesse
that she had / And Pelagyen demanded him have ye a bishop / And he said ye
lady / And she said to him / Say to him / that he pray for me / For truly he
is thappostle of Ihesu christ / And / then the priest departid / and came
again the thyrdde day But when he came / he knockyd at door of the celle /
and anon answered / he opened the wyndowe / and saw that she was deed / Then
he came / and told hit to the bishop / then the Bishop and the clergy / and
all the monks assemblyd for to do thexequyes for this holy man / And when
they had taken the body out of the celle / they fond that she was a woman /
And then they merueyled gretely / And gaf thankynges unto god / and buried
the body much honorably / the eight day of October the year of our lord two
honderd and four score /

Thus ends the life of saint Pelagien
Here follows of saint Margarite said Pelagyen ^ And first of her name
THis virgyne Margaryte had tweyne names / She was called Margaryte / and
Pelagyen / In so much as she was named Margaryte / she is alwey lykened to a
flower For she had in her flower of her Vyrgynyte / And in that she was
called Pelagyen she might be said of pena pain / and lego legis to gadre /
For she gadred pain in many manners / in the Relygyon / where she put her
self as a man for to keep to god her vyrgynyte /

Of saint Margarite other wise Pelagyen
MArgarite otherwise called Pelagyenne / was a right noble vygyne / right rich
/ and right fair / And was much nobly kept by the dylygence of her friends /
For she was instruct in good manners / And she was ententyf to keep chastyte and
honest / in such wise / that she reffused to be seen of all men in any manner
/ And at the last she was required to marriage of a noble young man / And by
the accord of one and other of each other Friends / all things necessary to
the weddynges / were maade ready / and had with much great glory of
rychesses and delyces / And when the day of wedding came / that the
yonglynges and maidens were assembled in right great noblesse to fore the
chamber / and the faders and moders made great feste for the marriage with great
joy / the vyrgyne enspyred of god / that the damage of her vyrgynyte was
brought by so great harmeful enioyenge / and stratched her to the earth sore
weeping / and began to think in her heart the recompense of her vyrgynyte /
and the sorrows that folowen of marriage / and reputed all the joys of the
world as ordure and fylthe / And that night she kept her fro the company of
her husbond / And at mydnyght she commanded her to god / And cut of her here
/ / and clad her in thabyte of a man And fled fro thennes to a monasterye of
Monks / And did do call her brother pelagyen / and there was received of
thabbot / and dylyge^tly instruct and taut / And she held her self there
holyly / and relygyously / And when the pryour / which was thereby of nonnes
was deed / by consent of thabbotte and of thauncyent men she was set to be
master of thabbeye of Nonnes / how be hit that she refused it strongly And as
she admynystred not only their necessaryes / but also fode to the soul
contynuelly without blame / The deuylle had envy of her / and thought he
might occupye her good time / by sum objection of sin / And as a vyrgyne
which was dwelling with out the gates had sinned in lechery by thyntymacion
of the deuylle / And when her belly aroos / so that she might not hyde it /
All the vyrgynes were so aferd and so shamefast / and also the Monks of
either monasterye / that they wist not what to do / And supposed verily that
pelagyen / which was provost / and also famylyer with the woman had done
this deed / And so condemned him without Judgment And then he was put out
and wyste not why / And was closyd in a pytte within a roche / And then he
that was most cruel of all the Monks was ordained for to mynystre him /
which served him with barley bread and water / and that in right little
quantite / And when the Monks had enclosyd him / they departed / and left
pelagyen there allone / And was not troubled in any manner / but ever thanked
god / and comforted her self in her contynence by thensample of holy saints /
At last when she knew that her end aporochyd / she wrote lettres unto
thabbotte and to the Monks in this wise / I of noble lygnage was called
Margarete in the world / but for I would eschew the temptacions of the world I
called my self pelagyenne / I am a man / I have not lied for to deceive / but I
have showed that I have the virtue of a man / And have virtue of the sin /
which was put on me / And I Innocent thereof have done the penance therefore /
I require you for as much as I am not known for a woman / that the holy
sussters may burye me / so that the demonstraunce of me deyenge / may be the
clensynge of my living / And that the wymmen may know that I am a vyrgyne /
whom they Iuged for aduoulterer / And when they herd hereof / the Monks and
the Nonnes ran unto the pytte / in which she was enclosyd / and the wymmen
then had knowledge that she was a woman and vyrgyne without touching of man /
And then they were penytente / and had great repentance of that which
they had done / And buried her in the church among the vyrgyns honorably /

Thus ends the life of saint Margrete otherwise called pelagyen
Here follows of saint Thais or Thaisis first of her name
THaisis is said of taphos / that is to say death / for she was cause of the
death of many that deyde for her in sin / or she is said of thalos / that is
to say delight / For she was delycious to men / and accomplysshed all worldly
delytes / or she is said of thalamo / that is will or affection of marriage /
For at the last she had will to be married to god by great penance

Of saint Thaisis
THaysis as it is read in vitas patrum was a common woman / and of so great
beaulte / that many followed her / and sold all their substaunces / that they
came unto the vtterest pouerte / And they that were her lovers / often faught
for her / and stroof for Ialousye / so that they otherwhyle slew each other /
and thereof her hows was often fulle of blood of young men that drew to her /
which thing came to the knowledge of an holy Abbot named pafuncius / and he
took on him seculer habyte / and a shellyng in his purs and went to her in a
cite of egypt / and gaf to her a shellyng / that is to say twelve pens / as
it had be cause for to sin with her / And when she had taken this money /
she said to him late us enter in to the chamber here within / And when they
were both entryd in to the chamber / she said to him / that he should go in to
the bed which was preciously aourned with clothes / then said he to her /
if there be any more secret place here / late us goo thereto / and then she
led him in to diverse secret places / And he said / alwey he doubted to be
seen / And she said to him / there is within a place where no man enters / and
there shall no man see us but god / and if thou dread him / there is no place
that may be hid from him / And when the old man herd that / he said to her
/ and know thou that there is a god / And she answered I know that there is a
god / and a Royamme of a to coming world for them that shall be saved and
also torments in hell for sinners / And he said to her / if thou know this
/ wherefore have thou lost so many sowles / and thou shall not only give acomptes
for thyn own sin / but thou must rekene them / that by the have sinned /
And when she herd this / she knelyd down to the feet of the abbot pafuncius /
and sore weeping she prayed him to receive her to penance saying / fader I
knowledge me penytent and contryte / and trust verily by thy prayer / that I
shall have remyssyon and foryeuenes of my sins / I axe of the but the space of
three hours / And after that I shall goo whyder someuer thou wylt / and shall
do that / which thou shall command me^ And when he had given to her that
term / and assigned her / whyder she should come / then she took all tho
goods that she had won with sin / and brought them in to the myddle of the
cite to fore the people / and brent them in the fire saying / Come ye forth all
that have sinned with me / and see ye how I brenne that which ye have given to
me / And the valewe of the goods that she burnt was of five honderd pound of
gold / And when she had all burnt it / she went to the place / which thabbot
had assigned to her / And there was a monasterye of vyrgynes / and there he
closed her in a celle / and sealed the door with leed / and the celle was
little and strayte / And but one little wyndowe opene / by which was mynystred
of her pour living / For thabbot commanded / that they should give to her a
little bread and water / And when the Abbot should depart / Thaysys said to
him / Fader / Where shall I shede the water / and that which shall come fro
the conduytes of nature / And he said to her in thy selle / as thou art worthy
/ And then she demanded how she should pray / And he ansuerde / thou art
not worthy to name god / ne that the name of the Trynyte be in thy mouth / ne
stratche thy hands to heaven / by cause thy lyppes ben fulle of iniquytees /
And thyn hands full of evil attouchynges and foul ordures / but look only
toward the eest / And say often these words / Qui plasmasti me miserere mei /
lord that have fourmed me / have mercy on me / And when she had been there
three year closed / thabbot pafuncius remembryd / and sorowed / and went to
thabbot Anthonye for to require of him if god had forgyuen her her sins / And
the cause told / saint Anthonye called all his disciples / and commanded them
/ that they should all wake that night / and be in prayer / so that god should
declare to sum of them / the cause why thabbot Pafuncius was come / And
then as they prayed without ceassynge / thabbot paul the grettest disciple
of saint Anthonye / saw suddenly in heaven a bed arraed with precious
vestymentes / which three vyrgynes arrayed with clear vysages / And these three
vyrgynes were named / the first was dread / which drew thaysys from euylle /
And the Second shame of the sins / that she commysed / and that made her to
deserve pardon / And the third was love of rytwysenesse / which brout her to
hye sovereign place / And when Powle had said to them / that the grace of
this vysyon was only by the merytes of saint Anthonye / A goodly voys answered /
that it was not by the merit of Anthony his fader / but by the merit of
thaysis the synnar / And on the morn when thabbot powle recounted his vysyon
/ And they had known the will of god / thabbotte pafuncius departed with
great joy and went anon to the monasterye / where she was / and opened the
door of the Celle / And she prayed him / that she might yet abide there enclosed
in / and thabbotte said to her issue and go out For god has forgeuen to the
thy sins / And she answered / I take god to witness / that sith I entryd
herin / I have made of all my sins a sum / and have set them to fore mine
eyes / And like as the brethe departs not fro the mouth ne the nosethrellys
/ so the sins departed never fro mine eye / but alwey have bewepte them / To
whom the Abbot pafuncius said / god has not pardonned the thy sins for thy
penance / but by cause that thou have had alwey dread in thy courage / And he
took her out fro thens / And she lived after xv days / and then she rested
in our lord / Thabbot Effrem conuertyd in like wise another common woman / For
when that common woman would have drawn saint Effrem for to have sinned
dyshonestly / he said to her / follow me / and she followed / And when they
came in a place / where a great multitude of men were / he said to her sytte
down here / that I may have to do with the / and she said / how may I this
do among so great multitude of people here standing And he said / if thou be
ashamed of the people / thou ought have gretter shame of god / which sees
all things hid / And she went awey all ashamed /

Thus ends the life of saint Thaysis
Here follows the life of saint Denyse And first of his name
DEnyse is as much to say / as hastily fleing / or Denyse is said of dya /
which is as much to say / as two / and nysus / which is to say y lift up /
For he was lift up after two things / that is after the body and the soul /
Or denis may be said of Dyane that is Venus / the goddess of beauty / and of
syos that is to say god / as who says / he is fair to god / or as sum say
he is said of Dyonisia that is after ysydore a precious stone black / which is
good ageynste dronkenesse / he was hasty in fleing the the world by parfyght
renonciacion / He was lift up by contemplacion by things within forth / he was
fair to god by beauty of virtues / He prouffyted to synnars ageynste
dronkenesse of vices / And he had many names to fore his conuersyon / For he
was called Ariopogita for the street that he dwelled in / he was called
theosophus / that is to say wise to god / Also of the wise men of greece he is
said unto this day perystera vranos / that is to say / the wynghe of heaven /
For he flewe merueilously with the wynghe of spyrytualle understanding in to
heaven / Also he was said Macharius that is blessed Also he was said of his
Countreye Ionicus / Ionica as says papye is one of the langages of greeks / Or
Ionyces ben said a manner of round pylers / or Ionicum is said a foot of
versyfyenge / which has two syllabes short / and tweyne long / By which he
is showed / that he was wise and knowing god / by Inquysycyon of things preuy
and hid / Wynghe of heaven by love of things celestyall / and blessed by
possession of everlasting goods / By other things it is showed that he was a
merueilous Rethour by eloquence / a susteynour and a berar up of the chirch by
doctrine / short to him self by humylyte / and long to other by Charity /
Saint Austyn says in the eight book of the Cite of God / that Ionyque is a
kind of Philosophres ytalyens / which ben toward ytalye / and Ionyques ben of
the part of greece / And by cause that denis was a sovereign philosopher^ he was
named Ionyque / And Methodins of Constantynople endyted his life and his passion
in grekesshe tongue / And Anastasius in latin / Which was a writar of the
bible of the church of Rome as ygnarus bishop of Raynes says /

Of saint Denyse
SAint Denyse Ariopagyte was conuertyd to the faith of Ihesu Christ of saint
powle thappostle And he was called Aryopagyte of the street that he dwelled ^n
/ And in that street called Aryopage was the Temple of Mars / for they of
Athenes named every street of the gods that they worshipped in the same / And
that street / that they worshipped in the God Mars they called Aryopage / For
Aryos is to say mars / and pagus is a street / and where they worshyped pan
they named panopage / and so of all other streets / Aryopage was the most
excellent street / by cause that the noble men haunted it / And therein were the
scolers of the arts lyberalle / And denyse dwelled in that street / which was
a right great philosopher / And for as much as the plant of wisdom of the
deyte was in him / he was called Theosophus / that is to say / knowing god /
And one Appollophanus was his felawe in philosophye / There were also Epicurij
/ which said / that all felycyte of man was in only delight of the body / And
stoycy / which held oppynyon that it was in the only virtue of courage / And
then on the day of the passion of our lord / when derkenesse was upon the
vnyuersalle world / the philosophres that were at Atthenes could not find in
causes naturelle the cause of that derkenesse / And it was no natural eclypse
/ For the moon was then fro the son / and was xv days old / and so was in
a parfyght distaunce fro the son / And nevertheless an Eclypse takes not awey
the light in the universal partytyes of the world / And it may not endure
three hours long / And it appiereth that this eclypse took awey all the light
/ by that which saint Luke says that our lord suffryd in all his membrys /
And by cause that the Eclypse was in Elyopolym / in Egypt / in Rome and in
greece / And Orose says / that it was in gyece / and in the end of Asye the
less / And says / that when our lord was nailed to the Cross / there was a
right great tremblyng and earth quaue thorugh the world / The Roches were cut
a sondre / and the Montaynes cloven / right great floodes fylle in many parties
more than they were wont to do / And that day fro the sixthe hour unto the
nynthe hour the son lost his syghte thorugh out all the lands of the
universal world And in that night there was no sterre seen in all Egypt /
And this remembryth Denis to Apolophanes saying in his Epistle / The world was
derke communely of obscurete of derkenesses / And after the only dyametre
returned purged / And when he had founden that the son might not suffer
such heaviness / And we ne may not have knowledge in our courage yet the
mysterye of this thing / by our conning and wisdom / And O Appollophanes
myrrour of doctrine what shall I say of these secrets and hyd things / I
attrybute and put them to the / as to a mouth dyuyne / and not as to
understanding ne speech humayne / To whom he said / O good denyse / these ben
the mutacions of dyuyne things / And in the end it is sygnyfyed al along the
day and the year of thanunciacion / that Powle our doctor said to our deef
eeres / And by the signs that al men cried which I remembryd / I have founden
the very troth / and am delyuerd from the laas of falsenes / These ben the
words of denis that he wrote in his epistle to polycarpe / and to
Appollophanes saying / we were we tweyne at Helyopolym / and we saw the Moon
of heaven goo disordynately / And the time was not couenable / And yet ageyn fro
the nynth hour unto euensonge time at the Dyametre of the son establysshed
above all naturel ordenaunce / That eclypse we saw begin in the eest / and
coming unto the term of the son / After that retornyng again and not
purged of that defaute / but was made contrary after the Dyametre / Then
Denis and Appollophanes went to Helyopolyin in Egypt by desire to learn
Astronomye / And after Denyse returned again / That the said Eclypse took
aweye the light fro the vnyuersalle parties of the world / It apperith that
Eusebe wytnessyth in his Chronicles / which says that he has read in the
dyctes af the Ethyncyens that there was in Bythynnia / / which is a prouynce of
Asye the less a great earth shaking / And also the grettest derkenesse that
might be / And also says that in Nycene which is a cite of Bytynne / that the
earth trembling threw down howses / And it is read in Scolastica Historia
that the Philosophers were brought to this / that they said / that god of
nature suffered death / or else the ordinance of nature in this world was
dissolved / or that the elementys lyeden / or god of nature suffered / And the
elementis had pity on him / And it is said in another place that denyse says /
this night sygnefyed that the new very light of the world should come / And
they of Atthenes made unto this god an altar / and set this title thereupon /
This is the altar of the god unknown and on every altar of their gods the
title was set above in showing to whom that altar was dedycate / and when
that henyens would make their sacryfyse unto this unknown god The philosophres
sayden / this god has no need of none of our gods / but late us knele down
to fore him / and pray unto him deuoutely / For he requires not thoblacions
of beestes / but the deuocio^s of our corages / and after when the blessed
saint pawle came to Athenes / the philosophres Epicurij / and stoycy disputed
with him / Sum of them said / what will this sower of words s^ye / And
other said / that he seemed a shewer of new gods / that been deuyls / And
then they brought hy^ in to the street of the philosophres for to examyne
their new doctrine / And they said to him / bryngest thou any new tidings /
we would know what thou have brought to us / For thatenyens intended to none
other thing / but to here sum new things / And then when saint Powle
had beholden al their aulters / He saw among them the altar of God
unknown / and Pawle said / whom honor ye that ye know not / Him show I
to you to be very god that made heaven and earth / And after he said to Denyse
/ whom he saw best learned in dyuyne things / Denyse what is he that unknown
god / And Denyse said / He is verily a god / which among gods is not showed
/ but to us he is unknown / and to come in to the world / and to regne
without end And pawle said / Is he a man only or spyryte / and Denyse said /
he is god and man / but he is unknown / by cause his conversation is in heaven
/ Then said saint powle / this is he that I preche / which descended fro
heaven / And took our nature humayne / and suffryd death / and aroos again the
third day And as saint denis disputed yet with saint powle there passed by
adventure by that way a blind man / to fore them And anon Denis said to Powle
/ if thou say to this blind man in the name of thy god / see / and then
sees I shall anon believe in him / but thou shall use no words of
enchauntement For thou may happily know sum words that have such might
and virtue / And pawle said / I shall write to fore the form of the words /
which ben these / In the name of Ihesu Christ borne of the vyrgyne / crucyfyed
and deed / which aroos again / and ascended in to heaven / and from thens shall
come for to Judge the world / See And by cause that all suspecion be taken awey
/ Pawle said to Denyse / that he him self should pronounce tho words / And
when Denyse had said those words in the same manner to the blind man / Anon
the blind man recouerd his syghte / And then Denis was baptized / And Damare
his wife / and all his meyny / And was a true Christian man / And was Instruct
and taught by saint Powle three year / and was ordained Bishop of Athenes /
And there was in predycacion / And conuertyd that Cite / and great pa^te of the
regyon to christian feith And it is said that saint Powle showed to him that he
saw when he was rauysshed in to the third heaven / like as saint Denyse seyth
and shewyth / in diverse places / whereof he speaks so clerly of the gerarchyes
of Angels / of the ordres and of the disposicions and offices of them / so
that it is not supposed that he learned of any other / but only of him that was
rauysshed unto the thyrdde heaven / and had seen all things / He flouryd by
the spyryte of prophecye / like as it appieryth in an epistle that he sent to
Johan theuangelyst in the isle of pathmos / to which he was sent in exyle /
where as he prophesied that he should come again sareng thus / Enjoy thou
verily byloued / very wonderfulle / and to be desired ryt well byloued / thou
shall be laten out fro the keeping that thou have in pathmos / And shall
return unto the land of Asye / And thou there make there the following of thy
good god and the good works of him / and shall deliver them to them that
shall come after the / And as it is seen and showed in the book of the names
dyuyne / he was at the deyenge of the blessed virgyne Marye / And when he
herd that peter and powle were enprysoned at Rome under Nero / he ordained a
Bishop under him and came for to vysyte them And when they were martryd and
passyd to god / And Clement was set in the sea of Rome / After a certain time
he was sent of the said Clement in to France / and he had in his company
Rustyke and Elentherye / And then he came with them to paris / and converted
there much people to the faith and did do make many Chirches / and set in
them clerks of diverse ordres / And then he shone by so great heavenly grace
that when the Bisshops of thidolles moeued by stryf the people against him / And
the people came for to destroy him / Anon as they had seen him / they left
all their cruelte / And knelyd down at his feet / where they had so great
dread / that they fled aweye from him for fere / But the deuylle which had
envy / and saw every day his power mynnysshed and destroyed / And that the
church encreaced / and had vyctorye of him / and moeued Domycyen the emperor
in so great cruelte / that he made a commandment / that who someuer might
find any christian man / that he should constrayne them to do sacryfyse / or
tormente them by diverse torments / And then he sent the provost sysynnye^
of Rome to paris ageynste the Christian men / And fond there the blessed denyse
prechynge / and made him cruelly to be beten / bespytte / and despised / and
fast to be bounden with Rustyke and Elentherye / and to be brought to fore him
/ And when he saw that the saints were constaunt and ferme in the
knowlechynge of our lord / he was much heavy / and soroufull / Then came
thither a noble matrone / which said that her husbond was fowly deceived of
these enchaunteurs And then anon the husbond was sent fore / And he
abiding in the confession of our lord was anon put to death / And the
saints were beten cruelly of twelve knytes / and were straytly bounden with
chains of iron / and put in prison / the day following Denis was leyd upon a
gredyron / and stratched al naked upon the celes of fire / And there he sange
to our lord saying / Lord / thy word is vehemently fiery / And thy servant is
enbraced in the love thereof / And after that he was put among cruel beestes
/ which were excited by great hongre and famyne / by long fasting / And as
soon as they came rennynge upon him / he maade the sign of the cross ageynste
them / and anon they were made most meke and tame / And after that he was
cast in to a fornais of fire / and the fire anon quenchyd / And he had
neither pain ne harm / And after that he was put on the cross / and thereon
he was long tormentid / and after he was taken down / and put in to a derke
prison with his felawes / And many other Christian men / And as he song there the
mass / and communed the peuple / our lord appyeryd to him with greet light /
and delyuerd to him bread saying / Take this my dear friend / For thy reward
is most great with me / After this they were presented to the Judge / and were
put again to new torments / And then he did do smite of the hedes of the
three felawes / that is to seye denyse Rustyke and Elentherye in the name of the
holy trynyte / and this was done by the temple of Mercurye / And they were
byheded with three axes / And anon the body of saint Denis raised him self up /
and bare his heed bitwene his arms / as the angels ladde him two leghes fro
the place / which is said the hylle of the martirs / unto the place where he
now rests by his election / and by the purueaunce of god / And there was herd
so great and sweet a melodye of Angels / that many of them that herd hit
byleuyd in our lord / And La^sia wife of the forsaid provost lubye / said that
she was Christian / And anon she was byheded of the wicked felons / and was
baptized in her blood / and so deyed / And Lysbyen his sone which was a
knight at Rome / under three Emperors came afterward to paris / and was baptized
/ and put him self in the nombre of the Relygyous / and the wicked paynyms
doubted that the good Christian men would burye the bodies of Rustyke and
Elentherye / and commanded that they should be cast in to said the River /
And a noble woman badde them to dyne that bare them And whiles they dyned /
this lady took aweye the bodies / and buried them secretly in a field of
heerys / And after when the persecucion was cessyd she took them thens / and
leyde them honorably with the body of saint Denis / And they suffered death
about the year of our lord four score and sixten / under domycyan / the year
of the age of saint Denis four score and ten / On a time when Regulus the
holy bishop song mass at Arelatence and reherced the names of thappoostles
in the canone / he added and joined to the blessid martirs Denyse / Rustyke /
and Elentherye / which so said / many supposid that they had yet lyuyd / and
merueyled why he so reherced their names in the canone / And they so wondryng
there appyered upon the Cross of the altar three dounes sitting / which
had the names of the saints marked and wreton on their breasts with blood /
which dylygently beholding / understood well that the saints were departed
out of this world / And ygnarus Bishop of Reins says in a pistse / which
he sent to Charles / that this denis / that was sent in to France / was
denyse Ariopagita as before is said / And the same says Johannes scotus in a
pystle to charles / lest by the reason of the countynge of the time / should be
said against / as sum would obiecte / About the year of our lord eight
honderd xxxij in the time of lowys king of France / the Messagyers of Mychael
emperor of Constantinople among other things brought to L^wys sone of
Charles le grant the books of saint denis of the gerarchye of the angels
translated out of greek in to latin and were received with great joy / And
that same night were nynten seek men heled in his church / About the year of
our lord / six honderd and three and forty / like as hit is contained in a
Cronycle Dagobert king of France / which reigned long to fore pyppyn /
began to have fro his childehode great reverence to saint Denis / For when
he douted in that time the Ire of his fader Clotayre / he fled anon to the
Chirch of saint Denis / And when this holy king was deed / it was showed in
a vysyon unto an holy man / that the soul of him was rauysshed to judgment /
and that many saints accused him that he had despoylled their chirches / And
as the wicked Angels would have had him to the pains / the blessed Denis came
thither / and by him he was delyuerd at his coming / and escaped fro the pains
/ And peradventure the soul returned to the body / and did penance / Clouys
king discovered the body of saint Denis not dewely / and brake the bone of his
arm / and rauysshed it awey coueytously / And anon he becam out of his mind
/ Then late us worshipe almighty god in his seyntes / that we by their
merytes / may amend our self in this wretchyd life / that we may after this
life come unto his sempyternal bliss in heaven Amen

Thus ends the life of saint Denyse
Here follows of saint Calixt pope And first of his name
CAlixte is said of caleo cales / that is to say eschauffe or to make warm /
For he was hoote and brennynge / First in the love of god / And after he was
hoote and brennynge in g^tynge and purchacyng sowles / and thyrdly he was hoote
in destroyeng the false ydolles / and also in showing the pains for sin /

Of saint Calyxte
CAlixte the pope was martryd the year of our lord two honderd / and two and
twenty under Alysander the Emperor / And by the works of the said emperor /
the most apparaunt party of Rome was then brent by vengeance of god / And
the lift arm of thydolle Iupyter / which was of fine gold was molten / And
then all the prestes of thydolles went to the emperor Alysander / and
required him that the gods that were angry might be appeased by sacryfyses /
And as they sacryfysed on a thursday by the morn / the air being al clear /
four of the priests of thydolles / were smeton to death with one stroke of
thondre / And the altar of Jupiter was burnt / so that all the people fled
out of the walls of Rome / And when Palmachyen Consul knew that C^lyxt with
his clerks hid him over the water of Tybre / required that the Christian men /
by whom this evil was happed and comen should be put out for to purge and
cleanse the cite / And when he had received power for to do so / he hasted
him incontinent / with his knights taccomplysshe hit / And anon they were al
made blind And then palmachyen was aferd / And showed this / unto Alysandre
/ And then the emperor commanded that the wednesday all the people should
assemble / and sacryfye to Mercurye / that they might have answer upon these
things / And as they sacryfyed a maid of the temple which was named Iulyane
was rauysshed of the deuylle / and began to cry / The God of Calyxte is very
true and living which is wroth / and has indignacion of our ordures / And
when palmachyen herd that / he went over Tybre unto the Cite of Rauenne unto
saint Calixte / and was baptized of him he / his wife and all his meyny / And
when the emperor herd that / he did do call him / and delyuerd him to Symply
cyen Senator / for to warn and treat him by fair words / by cause he was
much profitable for the comune / And Palmachyen perseueryd in fastings /
and in prayers / Then came to him a man which promised to him / that if he
heled his wife / which had the palseye / that he would bileue in god anon /
And when Palmachien had adourid and praid / the woman that was seek aroos / and
was al hole And ran to Palmachyen saying / Baptize me in the name of Ihesu
crist which has taken me by the hand / and lift me up / Then came Calixte /
and baptized her and her husbond / and symplycyen / and many other / And when
the emperor herd hereof / he sent to smite of the hedes of all them that were
baptized / And made Calixte to live five days in the prison without mete and
drink / And after he saw that calixt was the more comforted and glad / And
commanded that he should every day be beten with staves / And after he made a
great stone to be bounden to his neck / and to be thrown down from an hihe out
of a wyndowe in to a pit / And Asteryen his priest took up the body out of
the pytte / And after buried the body in the Cymytorye of Calipodyen /

Thus ends the life of saint Calixte
Here follows the life of seint Edward king and confessor
IN old time the Royamme of England was gretely troubled with the Danes / So
that in many kings days there couthe no pees be maade / But contynuelly werre
/ And the Danes prevailed ageynste England / And they brought it under their
subjection / for their cruelte and tyranny was so great / that without
sparynge of any thing brent and destroyed / But at the last / it plesyd
almighty god / that this tyranny should cease / And sent of his grace unto
this Royame of England a peasible king named Edgar / In whose birth angels
songen / that pees shall be in his time / and so in his days was no werre in
england / saint edward king and martyr his sone reigned not long after him For
his stepmoder did do slay him in his young age / by cause her sone Ethelrede
should regne / and saint Dunston baptized Ethelrede and said / by cause he
defowled the fontstone / that he should live in great trouble / and so he did /
for the danes warryd all his time / and this Etheldrede wedded Earl Goodwyns
daughter / on whom he gate Edmond yronsyde / And after the death of that queen
he wedded the daughter of Rychard duke of Normandy / which hit Emme / by whom
he had two sons / Alurede and Edward which was a saint and Confessor / of
whom we purpose to speak / when king Etheldrede was fall in age / he made a
parliament / which of his two sons should be king after him / And then by
the prouysyon of god it was concluded / that Edward / which was not then
borne and in his moders belly should be king and excluded Edmond yrensyde and
Alfrede / which were the kings older sons / And when the king had consented
thereto / a general oath was made to perform the same in time coming / And
after when this child was borne / All the land enjoyed in his birth / hopyng
to be gretely releiud by him / yet alweye the cruelte of the danes was so
great / which the king so much doubted / that he sent the queen and his two
sons ^ Alfrede and Edward in to Normandy / and took his oldest sone edmond
with him to battle to fight against ye danes / the sorrow was then great in
England / for much people turned to the danes against their own king / and
without pity did brenne and slay their own Country with the danes / among
whom was slain saint Alphey / Archebisshop of caunterbury at grenewyche / and
many other good men / and some bisshops / prestes / and men of Relygyon fled
in to secret places and deserts / where they deuoutely praid unto almyty god
for to have very pees in this land / but this werre continued all the life of
Etheldrede according to the prophecye of saint Dunston / And after Etheldrede
reigned Edmond yrensyde his sone in full great trouble / for in his days no man
durst trust other / ne open his courage to his neighbor / for that time each
man appechyd other of treason / to then tente that he might have his good / And
they that were not of power to overcome their neighbor / turned unto the danes
against their owen neighbors / and so by the help of the danes / they
fulfilled their cursyd purpoos / and so there was much extorcion / And much
people slain in diverse places / in howses / feeldys and ways / that the
people vnneches durst burye them / Also in that time was great tyranny /
murthre oporessyng of wymmen as wives wydowes and maidens against their wylles
/ And in this persecucion Englysshmen were nyghe destroyed / and great
desolacion was in holy church / For monasteryes / Chirches and howses of
Relygyon were burnt and destroyed / which caused many to flee in to wyldernes
among whom the good bishop of wynchestre bryghtwold fled in to thabbay of
glastenbury / where he daily prayed unto almighty god for pees of this Royamme
of England / Our blessed lord seeing his mekenes showed to him a vysyon / by
which he was grely comforted / For in a night as he was in his oratorye / he
fylle in a sweet slombre / and saw the glorious Appostle saint Peter with
bright shynyng clothes / appieryng in an hyhe place of dygnyte / and with him a
semely young man rychely arrayed in clothyng of a king / whom saint peter did
consecrate and enoynte in to a king / and commendyng his chastity gretely /
and his clean living / and it was showed to this bishop many years to fore yt
this edward should regne in this land / and the bishop being abashed of this
vision desired of seint peter to know ye vision thereof / to whom saint peter
seid thestate of this royam / and told yt ye furye and wodenes of ye danes
should cease sone after and said yt all this punysshement was for the sins of
the people / and god should purueye for a peasible king which shall fynysshe
all the woodenes of his enemies the danes In whoos time shall be plente of
pees / both to the church / and to the land / and great haboundaunce of corn
and fruit / And this Royamme shall be prosperous in all things / And the
people shall be of such conditions / That other lands shall both love and dread
them / the kings name shall be Edward / which shall rule all manner things to
the plesyng of god / And shall end his life in the love of our lord graciously /
And when this holy bishop awoke / he knelyd down / and maade his prayers with
shedyng of teres / And though that pees was not yet reformed / Nevertheless he
thanked almighty god / that he was certain / that by gods grace he should see
hit / in his days / wherefore he went about / and prechid to the people for to
do penance / And our lord should show to us mercy / and give to us pees / and
all things plentyuous / And in this werre was the king slain by treason /
And he was buried at glastenbury / Then both his sons were brought to
king Canutus the dane / to do with them what he would / And when he saw them
/ he might not for pity slay them / but sent them over the sea to be slain
there / so that he might regne in England peasybly / when the ryghtfull blood
were destroyed / Notwithstondyng they were preseruyd and kept alive / and were
conveyed to the Emperor of Rome / the which kept them / till saint Edward
was maade king of England / and then he married tholdest of them to a cosyn of
his / by cause of the love that they had to king Edward / which was uncle to
them / Then had king Canute the rewle of England by strong hand / All
law and good rewle set a side / For in his days was full much trouble and
robberye with other great oppressions and Importable charges among the comonte
/ For he drad no man / except the ij sons of the king / that were then with
the emperor / wherefore his counceyl would that he should wedde the mother of them
named Emme / to make the more allyaunce between them / And sone after Alfrede
came in to England / for to speak to his mother / And anon as he was come over
the sea in to this land / Earl goodwyn came / and welcomyd him / And anon after
slew him by treason er he came to the presence of his mother / For whose death
saint Edward made great sorrow / and while this holy child saint Edward was in
Normandy / he vsyd a full good life / hauntyng oftymes holy Church / And louyd
and conuersyd many ^ymes with the company of holy Religious men and specially
among holy monks / And vsyd to pray aid say in this manner / O good lord I
have none help but the only / my friends ben gone fro me / And they ben become
mine adversaries / Mine fader is deed / My brethren ben slain / My mother is
wedded to my most enemy / And I am left allone / And daily they seek the
moyens to slay me / but to the lord I am left pour / I beseech the lord to
help me that am a faderles child / for thou sometime helpedest merueylously
Edwyn and Oswold / which were exyled and ordained for to deye / Thou defendest
them only from death / but also thou good lord restoredest them again to their
own kingdoms / O good lord I beseke the / and pray the to keep me sauf / and
bring me in to the kingdom of my fader / Thou shall be my god And saint Peter
the Appostle my patron / The relyques / of whom by the grace of god / I
purpose to vysyte / and to honor in the same place / where they now rest /
if thou lord send to me l^f health oportunyte and space / And when king Canute
had reigned in England xx year / having two sons by the said Emme / that is to
wete Harold and hardeknoute / he deyde / and when his first sone had reigned
four year / he exyled his own mother / and deyde sone after / And after him
reigned his brother a little time / and deyde also as our lord had ordained /
and then was England delyuerd fro the grievous tribute of thraldom of the
danes / and then the lords and the comyns of England remembrid the oath that
they maade in the parliament / which swear that Edward which was then in his
moders womb should be their king / And anon sent in to Normandye for this
holy child Edward / And the lords and the comyns received him with great
gladness / And then the archebisshop of Caunterbury and tharchebisshop of
york with other bisshops did consecrate him enoynted / and crowned him king
of England O good lord / what joy and gladness was then in England / For
when the old felycyte of this land was almost despayred then it was
kyndeled ageyn by the coming of this blessed king saint Edward / Then had
the comyns rest and pees / and the lords and gentil men rest and honor /
And then holy church received all her lybertees again / Then was the
sun lift up / and the moon set in his order / that is say / priests
shyned in wisdom and in holiness / The monasteryes flouryd in devotion by holy
relygyon / The Clerks gaf light and prosperyd in their offices to the pleasure
of god / The common people were content and were ioyefull in their degree / and
in this kings days there was no venym that might then corrupt the earth
with pestylence / and in the sea none outragyous tempests / and the land
plentyuous of all manner of fruytes / And in the Clergy nothing inordynate /
and among the coming people was no grutchyng / And the renomee and fame of this
holy king saint Edward sprange so merueyllously about to other nations / in
such wise that all Christian kings desired to have pees with him

The king of France / which was nyghe of his kyn made with him a generalle
pees / so that it might be said of him as it was said of Salamon All the
kings of therthe desired to see his face / and to here his wisdom except
only denmark / Which yet conspyred ageynste this Royamme of england / And
what fylle thereof / it shall be declared here after more openly / for this holy
king Edward was ever full of mekenes and of virtue / And never lift up by
vain glory / but ever he remembryd the words of our lord that says / I
have set the prince of the people / but be not therefore lift up in vain
glory / but be thou among them / as one of them / He was among his household
men egall and famylyer / among priests meke and debonayre / to his people
amyable / and chyerful / To wretchis and nedy men full of compassion / and large
of alms yeuynge / He was also much devout in the seruyse of god / And
dylygent to repair and reedefye Chirches that were destroyed by the danes /
And in Judgment fulle discrete / considering no man's person / but only the
weight of his cause / as well to the rich / as to the pour / and he had
richesse enough / and And his tresour seemed common to all pour men / his
words were sad and discrete / and medlyd with myrthe / spekyng often of Ihesu
Christ the second person in the Trynyte / And of our blessed lady his mother /
And sometime he spak sharply / as he saw need correctyng trespassours / gentyl
and sweet to good men He was never elate ne enhaunced in pride / no dishonest
by glotonye / He would not be compellyd by wrath / ne enclyne for yefte / He
despised richesse and was never sorry for loss of worldly goods and rychesses
/ ne the more glad for winning thereof / in such wise / that all men
merueyled of the sadness of him / And about the king were diverse coueitous men
/ which said to the king how his tresoure wastyd fast / And if the danes come
again / he had not where with to defend him / wherefore they counceiled him
to reyse an aid among his comyns like as king Canute had done diverse
times / An aid was then cleped the dane ghelte / And they counceiled to do
in like wise / And he said nay / And he would not agree thereto Notwithstondynge
/ they daily cried upon him / and when he saw them so importune / and showed
so great peryls / then at the last he said to them to preue them / late us
see / how ye will do / And when they herd that of his owen mouth were right
glad / and sent out commyssiones for to gadre it / and spared no country
but made them pay in the largest wise / and when this money was leueyed and
brought in to the kings tresorye / then they brought the king thither for to
see it / The king then standing a fer fro it saw the devil in lykenes of an
ape sittyng upon ye tresour And said what have ye done / and what money have ye
brought to me / Forsooth there shall not one penny be spente to mine use / but I
charge you for to deliver to each man his money again / but thereto they were
much loathe / and said that they might spend it in deeds of charity / Then
the king sayd^ / god forbede that I should spend the goods of other men / For
what alms should I make with ye gods of pour comyns and lauborers / see ye
not how the devil sytteth upon the hepe of money / and makes great joy that
he has taken us in his snare / wherefore I charge you on pain of death / that
ye deliver this money again / there as ye had it every penny / Then they
obeyed the king / and repaid it unto them / of whom they had received it / and
durst never after moeue the king to such matters / ne in none other like / so
that all the days of saint Edward was neither task ne tayllage leueyed among
his comyns / which was a great joy to the royame In a time the king was seek
lyeng in his bed / And there stood in his chamber a cheste open full of gold
and silver And a clerk came / in supposing the king had slepte / and took
out of it a certain sum of money / and went his way / And soon after he
came again / and would have taken more / then the king said / Forsothe now
thou art unwise to come again / For thou had suffycyently ynow to fore /
therefore beware / For if the tresorer come / and find the / thou art like to
deye therefore / wherefore if thou love thy life / flee fast awey with that that
thou have / And anon after came the tresorer / and fond hou of the tresour was
born aweye a great part / And sought and inquired dylygently for the thief /
that stale hit / And the king seeing the great trouble and sorrow of the
tresorer demanded him the cause of his heaviness And when he had told to the
king / the king said to him / sorrow no more therefore / For peraduentur he that
has it has more need to it / than we / And so the thief escaped and was not
pursued after / when all things were quyete in the Royamme / the counceill of
the land assemblyd for to treat for a marriage / for the king / which thing
when it was moeued he was gretely abashed dredyng to lose the tresour of his
vyrgynyte / which was kept in a fraylle and brutyll vessel / and what he
should do or say / he wist not / For if he should obstynatly deny it / he
dradde lest his auowe of chastyte should be openly known / and if he consentid
thereto / he dred to lose his chastyte / wherefore he commended him self only to
god saying these words / O good lord / thou deliver dest sometime three
Children fro the flamme of fire in the chymeney and fornais of the chaldyes /
and by the lord Joseph escaped with his chastyte / fro the wife of putyphar she
holdyng his mantell / And yet by thy mercy he escaped / and good lord by thy
virtue Susanne was delyuerd fro the death / to the which thold unchaste
priests had dampened her to / And by thy might lord Iudyth escaped when she
had slain Holofernes / And reseruyd her fro defowlyng / and escaped without
hurt / And above all other thou have preseruyd thy blessed mother most best
and swettest lady / she being both wife and vyrgyne / / then behold on me
thy servant / and sone of thyn handemayde / that am in great dread / I lift up
mine heart to the bisechyng the that art my lord and thy mother my swettest lady
/ to help me now in this most need / that I may so receive the sacrament of
wedlok / that I fall not in parylle of my chastyte / And with this condicyon
in his heart he consentid to matrymony

Then was all the counceyl right glad / and serchid for a vyrgyne that were
acordyng to his astate / And among all the virgyns of the land Edithe
daughter of earl goodwyn was founden most acordyng to him by her virtuous
conditions / and her fader ma^d great means to the kings counceille for to
accomplysshe this marriage / by which he might come in the kings conceyte /
And by his wysedom / for his great myt and power he had his intent and when the
marriage was solempnysed and accomplysshed by the holy sacrament / He and the
queen auowed to live to gydre chaste secretly / that noman knew it but god
allone / The was bitwene them a lonyng spousehede without bodyly knowing of
deed / Chaste embracing without defloracion of vyrgynyte / There was between
them verily chaste love without flesshely towchynge and knowing / Afterward
sum of the Royamme grutchid / saying / he had taken a wife by compulsion
ageynste his will / of an unkind lygnage / And would not know his wife / by
cause he would not bring forth mo tyrauntes / And this none knew the very
truth of his chaste life whiles he lived / but the very clennesse of his mind
was suffycyent wytnes of his chastyte / Hit happend on a wytsonday as the king
was crowned at westmestre in his astate / And knelyng made his prayers
deuoutely for the tranquyllyte and pees / of his land / before the altar of
the blessed trynyte / at leuacion of the blessed sacrament / he fylle in a
soft and demure lawhyng / so that the lords that were there present awaytyng
on him merueyled gretely / but durst say no thing to him till the seruyse was
done / Then one that was hardyer / than another demanded of him the cause of
his lawhyng / And then he told to him / how the danes had assemblyd a great
power of people ageynste the Royamme of England / And were entering in to their
ships / And as the king of denmark would have entryd in to the ship /
suddenly his strength was taken from him / And so fell in to the Sea / between
two ships / and was drowned / by whoos death the people of denmark and also
of England were delyuerd fro sin and parylle / They herynge this merueyled
gretely / and sent in to denmark to know the truth / And when the Messagers
returned / they reported that it was true as the king had said / And that the
king of denmark was drowned that same time that saint Edward lowhe / After
this the noble saint Edward remembryd his auowe and promise to vysyte saint
peter at Rome / which he made in Normandye / wherefore he let call his comyns
and his lords to a Counycelle to fore him / whereof he come ned with them / how
and in what manner he might depart / and of the governance of the Royamme in
his absence what peuple should be conuenyent for taccompanye him / And what
Money should suffyse him and his meyny / and when the lords and comyns herd
this / they were full heavy and sorrowful that he should depart from them / And
he seeing their heaviness comforted them / and said how that our lord had sent
to them pees / and by his good grace should continue the same in his absence /
yet notwithstondyng the people required him to send unto the pope to be
assoylled of his auowe / or else dylaye it till another time / And the king
seeing the sorrow and lamentacion of his peple^ which wept and wrong their
hands / and as people amassed without a defendour and kepar / comforted them
and granted tabyde stylle with them / And ordained certain Bisshops for to go
to Rome and to ask of our holy fader counceylle / how he might be assoilled
of this auowe that he had made to visit saint Peter / And then
tharchebisshop of york and bishop of wynchestre and ij abbots with diverse
clerks and lay men went to Rome / and when they came to Rome the pope had made
that time a great congregation of clerks of diverse great matters belongyng to
holy church / and when the pope wist of their coming / he was right glad and
sent for them / and the pope badde them tell the cause of her coming / and
anon scylence was made / and they exposed the cause of their coming / and
recited the auowe and the desire of king Edward / the peril of the Royame / the
trouble / the dread of the people / the brekyng of the pees / the clamor of the
pour comyns / the ieopardy of the king in his absence / and the piteous
destruction which the danes had late made by their cruelte / and also declared
the great devotion that he had to visit the holy appostles Peter and Powle /
then the pope and the clergy merueiled gretely / and gaf lawde and praisynge
unto almyty god that he had sent so devout and virtuous a prince in the angle
of the world to mayntene by his wisdom the christian faith / And how dredefull
he was to offend against the holy Church /

And when the pope understood how his people louyd him / and how soroufull^
they would be of his departing / They merueyled gretely / and thoute verily /
that he was gretely bylouyd of god / and was with him in all his works / For
they saw in him the mekenes of dauyd / the chastyte of Joseph and the Richesse
of Salamon / And yet he set naught there by / then the pope considering the
great perils / that might ensi^we by his departing dispensid with him / and
assoylled him of his auowe / of which he sent to him a bulle under leed / And
enjoined him in penance to give the goods that he should have spente in his
pylgremage to deeds of charity and to reedyfye some church of saint peter / and
endowe hit with sufficient lyuelode / And then the messagers received the
popes blessing / And returned in to England / and came unto the king at
westmestre / and when the king understood how he was assoylled of his auowe /
And how they had spedde / he was glad / and thanked almighty god / and our
holy father the pope / There was an holy man a recluse in the dyocyse of
worceter / which knew no thing of the counceyll assemblyd upon the
governance of the land / ne of tha uowe of the king / ne of the message
sent to Rome / To whom saint Peter appyerid in a night / and said to him /
how king Edward had sent to Rome to be assoylled of the auowe that he made /
when he was beyond the sea / and he has great conscience by cause his
counceylle wol not suffer him taccomplysshe hit in going in his propre person
to Rome / wherefore thou shall write to him in my name / and give him knowledge /
that he is assoylled by mine auctoryte fro the bond of his auowe / And how he
shall have in commandment of the pope for his penance / to give such goods
as he has ordeygned for his exspensis to pour men / and to make a new Abbay
in thonour of saint Peter / or to repair an old one / and tendewe it
suffyciently / and write to him / that by the same token / that he chaas me
sometime to his patron in Normandy / that he repair the Abbaye called Thorney
/ in the west side of the Cite of london / which sometime I hallowed my self /
And late him set therein Monks of good conuersacyon / For fro that place
shall be a ladder stratchyng in to heaven And Angels descendynge and ascendynge
/ berynge up to heaven to our lord the prayers of meke and devout men / And to
him that ascends by that ladder / I shall opene the yates of heaven / like as
our lord has enjoined me by mine office / and I shall lose them / that been
bounden / and receive them / that been unbound / All this that thou have herd
of me / thou shall write it / and send it to king Edward / which then was
many a mile thens / And the Messager / that came fro this Anchor or recluse / came
to the presence of the king / the same time / that the Bisshops came fro Rome
And when the king had received the lettres that came fro Rome with great
reverence / and read them / he thanked God / that he was so clearly releced
of the bond of his auowe / And then he commanded the lettres of the Recluse
to be read / And when they were read / and saw they were acordynge to the
lettres / that came fro Rome / he humbly thanked god / and saint peter his
patron / and Incontinent disposid him to fulfille his penance / And began to
repair thabbaye that he was assigned to repair by the glorious appostle saint
peter / and yaf largely alms to pour people / and fraunchysed al England of
the trybute / that was vsyd yearly to be paid to the danes for evermore / On a
time when king Edward was at westmynstre / there came to him a Crepyl born in
Irlond / which was named Gylemychell And this Crepyl had no feet / but went
upon his hands and knees having in either hand a little stole to go with His
legs were both bent backward and cleuyd to his thyes / and his toes grew
fast to his buttokkes / This Crepyl entrid boldly in to the kings palais / and
came to the kings chamber door / And one Hulyn the kings chamberlayn demanded
him shurply what he did there / To whom the crepil seid let me not I pray
you for I must needs speak to the king / For I have be out of this land six
times to vysyte the holy Reliques of the holy appostle seint peter to thentent
for to be heled / and saint peter denied me not but badde me goo in to england
/ and late the king bear me on his back in to the Church of saint Peter / and
then I shall be made parfyghtly hoole / which thing was told to the king by
the same Hulyn / and anon the king had pity on the pour man / and desdeygned
not / but took him on his sholdres / and bare him / whom the crypel beclypped
with his foul and skabby hondes and arms / and so in the beryng his synewes
losed / and were retchyd out / And of kyrnellys and botches of his face and of
scurffys there ran great plente of blood and atter on the kings clothes /
which was told to the king / and also that he was al hoole / but the king
took none head thereto / but bare him to the hyhe altar / and there he was set
down on his feet / and was made parfyghtely hoole to ride or go whyder he would
/ but the king would in no wise have this miracle ascrybed to him / but yaf to
him a reward and bad him go to rome and thank god and his holy appostle saint
peter / In the time of king Athelberte / which reigned in kent / And Sygebert
in myddelsex / which were conuertid to the faith of Christ by saint Austyn /
which Athelbert made in london within the Cite a noble and ryall church in
thonoure of saint Powle / in which saint Austyn ordained saint Mellyte to be
bishop of that Cite / which thing was not satisfied with that good deed but
thought And also did do make another church in the west end of the Cite /
which then was called Thorney / and now is named westmynstre / which
church he prayed Mellyte for to halowe in thonour of saint Peter / and the
night before that he had purposed to halowe it / saint Peter appyered to a
fisshar in Temse / and bad him set him over fro stangate to westmynstre / And
he prayed the fysshar to abide him there till he come again / and he would well
reward him / for his labor / And soon after the fysshar saw saint Peter
enter in to the Church with a great light / which light endured contynuelly
as long as he was in the church / And a certain space after he returned to
the fysshar / axynge him if he had any mete to ete / And the fysshar was so
gretely abashed of the light that issued out of the church with him / that
he durst not speak to him / To whom soynt Peter said / Brother / dread the
not / I am a man as thou art / have thou take any fysshe / and he said nay /
For I have awayted on you all this night / while ye have been in the church /
And then they entryd in to the boat / And saint Peter commanded him to cast
out his net / And when he had so done / there came so great a multitude of
great fysshys in to his net / that uneath they might draw up the net for
brekynge / And when they were come to land Saint Peter divided the fysshes /
and ^adde the fysshar bear the grettest unto Mellyte Bishop of London / and
deliver it to him / And tell to him that I have hallowed the church of
westmynstre this night / And say to him / that he say mass therm to morrow /
and if he will not believe it / say to him / when he comes / he shall find
there tokenes suffycyent / And I shall be patron of that church / and vysyte
it of times / and bear in the sight of almyty god / the prayers and deuocions
of true christian people that pray in that place / and take thou the remenaunt of
the fysshe for thy labor / And this said / saint Peter vanysshed away / Then
the fyssher merueyled gretely of the sight that he had seen / And erly by the
morrow he went to the Bisshoppe Mellyte of london / and delyuerd to him the
fysshe that saint Peter had sent to him / and told to him by order / like as
saint Peter had given him charge / and as ye have herd to fore / but the
Bishop would not bileue him til he came to westmestre and see the tokenes for to
put him out of doubt / and when he had opened the chirch door he fond a
cross made of sonde / fro that one side of the church unto that other wit^ /
a / b / c / lettres of grew / and he fond also xij crosses made on the walls
in diverse places of the church / and thendes of xij candels almost brent out
/ and also he saw ye places that were enoynted with holy oil / which yet
were moist and appyered newely done / Then the Bishop byleuyd this thing
verily / and said mass that same day in the church / And there preached to
the peuple a glorious sermon / And declared the great miracle openly / wherefore
the people gaf laud and praysynge to god / and to his glorious Appostle saint
Peter / And when saint Edward understood / that this church was of old time
hallowed by saint Peter / And how saint Peter had commanded him to repair
the same Church / as the lettre of the recluse makes mention / So then
ever after he had full great devotion to the same place / And he did do cast
down the old work / and did do bylde it up new / and endowed that Monastery
worshipfully with lyuelode and Iewellis / And at that time pope Leo was deed /
And pope Nycholas was after him / And then the king to give relacion to him
of his penance enjoined by leo his predecessor / to re^difye a monastery of
the glorious appostle saint Peter / And sent Alurede the Archebisshop of york
to Rome / with other Clerks tenforme the pope that he had accomplisshed his
penance / that is to wete / both distrybuted his goods to pour men / And
also repaired a monastery of saint Peter / And how he had by reuelacion what
place he should repair / prayenge him to ratefye and conferme the same / which
pope Leo had done to fore him / Then pope Nycholas consyderyng the great
devotion and true intent of this Christian king saint Edward / confermyd the
bulle of absolucion / and ratefyed the fundacion and the statutes of the
monasterye / And gaf thereto great and large pryueleges / that who so ever
presumed to take awey any moeuable or inmeuable goods or would take any man by
force or strength out of that church or of the precyncte of the same should
be acursyd by thauctoryte of peter and Pawle / to be dampened with Judas in
hell euerlastyngly to lie in pain / Then the Messagyers returned again
fro Rome with the lettres of confyrmacion / And when the king saw the great
benyuolence of our holy father the pope / and his favor and gentylnesse /
gyuynge to him by writing moo pryueleges / and fredom than he desyrede /
Then he was fulle of gladness and joy / and thonked almighty god of all
his yeftes / On a time the king was in the church of saint peter at
westmynstre / and was disposed in great devotion / as his customme was to here
mass / Earl Leofryke kneled behind the king / and saw with his bodyly eyes
our lord Ihesu christ between the priests hands / appyerynge in the lykenes of
a glorious child or beauteuous person / which blessed the king with his
right hand / And the king which was gretely comforted with the sight bowed
down his head / and with great devotion and mekenes received the blessing of
our lord / Then the earl aroos to tell the king / supposing that the king
had not seen it / but he knew the earls entente / and bad him stand stylle
/ For that thou see I see / And him I honor / And when mass was done.
they talkyd to gydre of their visyon / and they were merueylously refresshyd
with the yeftes of the holy ghost / and might not well speak for joy / and
weeping / Then the king commanded Leofryke that this vysyon should never be
vtteryd ne openly known / tylle the time that they should deye / And when
Leofryke should depart hens / he told it in Confession to his ghoostly fader /
and made it to be wreton / And that writing was leyd in a chyste among other
relyques / And many years after when they were both deed / the writing was
found and radde / And then the holiness of the king was known / and his
mekenes showed which would not hit should be showed by their life for vain
glory / There was a young woman yeuyn in marriage to a noble man / and not
long after she had tweyne mysfortunes First she was barayne / And also there
aroos under her cheke many foul botchys and kernellys full of corrupt humors
/ which engendryd foul wo^mes / and made her flesh to stynke / so that she
was abhomynable and hateful unto her husbond and to all her friends / And
when she couthe not be heled by no medycyne / then she put al her hope and
trust in almyty god / And with many a bitter tere both day and night besought
and prayed him to deliver her fro that repreef and dysese / or else to take her
out of this world / And when she had thus long continued in prayer / she
was commanded by a voys in her sleep / that she should goo to the holy king
Edward / And if he would wasshe her face with his hondes / she should be all
hoole / And when she awoke she auowed to seek the king in his palace / And
then she came thither / and maad means that the king might have knowledge of
her dreme / And when the king understood it / he called her to him / and
said / if god will that I should wesshe thy face / I will not refuse it / And
called after water / and with his own hands he wesshe her face And wrong
out the worms / and all the foul blood out of her face / And badde her
tarry there three or four days / tylle the skin might cover again her vysage
/ And thank thou god for thy delyueraunce / And when she was maade
parfyghtely hoole / and her vysage fair and beauteuous / then she fylle
down at the kings feet / and thanked him humbly of her delyuerau^ce / but he
forbad her for to give any praysynge to him therefore / but badde her to give
lawde and praysynge to god therefore / For he is the doar and not I / Then she
prayed the king / that he would pray to god for her / that she might have a
Child / by her husbond / For she had been long bareyne / And the king
promised her so to do / And then she returned ioyously home to her husbond /
And sone after conceived and had a child / whereof she thanked god that she was
heled of both her dyseases / Saint Powle writes / that the holy ghost
yeueth graces dyuersly / to some he yeueth wisdom / to some conning And to
sum grace to hele and to cure seek people / But this blessed king saint
Edward had a special grace above other in gyuyng sight to blind men / There
was a blind man well known / which herd a voys in his sleep / that if he myt
have of the water that the king wesshe his hands in / and wasshe his eyes
therewith / he should have his sight again / Then the next day after this
blind man went in to the kings palais / And told his vysyon to the kings
Chamberlayne / And the Chamberlayne told it to the king / Then the king
said that it might be well an Illusyon or a dreme which is not alwey true /
for it has not be seen / that foul water of a sinners hondes should give
sight to blind men Then said the chamberlayn that many times dremes have been
founden true as the dremes of Joseph / Pharao / Danyel / and many other /
Then the king in great humylyte went in to the church on a solemn day
with a basyne of water / And commanded the blind man to be brought to him /
And as the king weshe the face of the blind man / his eyes were opened and had
his sight / and stood all abashed lokyng on the people / as he had newely
comen in to this world / And then the people wept for joy to see the
holiness of the king / And then he was demanded if he might see clearly /
And he said ye forsothe / And the king knelyd down before the altar saying
this verse with great dread and mekenes / Non nobis domine non nobis sed nomini
tuo da gloriam / That is to say / Not to us lord / not to us / but unto thy
name be yeuen glory / After this the holiness and fame of saint Edward sprange
about / so that a Cytezeyne of Lyncolne which had be blind three year came to
the kings palais to have of the water that the king had wasshen his hands
in / For he bileuyd that it would hele him / And as he had gotten of that water
by one of the kings officers / he weshe his face and his eyes there with / And
anon he was restored to his syghte / and was parfyghtely made hole / and so
ioyefully returned home / magnyfyenge god and saint Edward / that he had his
sight again /

In a time there were gadrid to gydre certain werkemen to hew down tree / es
to the kings palais at Bruhamand after their labor / they leyd them down to
sleep in the shadow / And a young man of that felauship that heyts wylwyne /
when he should rise / he opened his eyes / and might not see / he weshe his face
and rubbed his eyes / but he might no thing see / wherefore he was full of
heaviness / Then one of his felawes ladde him home to his hows / and abode
so blind eyghten year / And at the last a worshipfulle woman came to vysyte
and comfort him And when she knew how he was made blind she badde him be
of good chere / and said / if he would vysyte lx chirches with good devotion /
and then to have the water / that the king had wasshe his hondes in / and
wasshe his eyes with all / he should have his fight again Then he was gretely
comforted and gate him a gyde / and went / and visyted three score chirches
with great devotion / and came to the kings palace / and cried for help / And
they that herd hym^ bad him cease of his cryenge / but for all that he cried
more and more / And when the king understood it ^he called him to him / And
said / why should I not set my hondes to help this pour man / though I be
unworthy / if it please god to releue him and to give to him his syghte / And
by cause he would not be founden disobedyent to god ne presumptuous / he took
water / and wesshe his eyes full mekely / And anon he was restored to his sight
/ and saw as clearly as ever he did / Also there was a fair miracle of three
blind men / And the fourth had but one eye / which camen to the kings
palais / And then came one of the kings servants / which had pity on them
/ and he gate of the water that the king had wesshen his hondes in when he
had heled that other blind man / And he brought this water to the gate / and
told these pour men how the king a little hefore had helyd a blind man with
the same water / And said to them / if they would wesshen their eyes with good
devotion they might be heled by gods grace / with the same water / And then
they kneled down with great devotion / and praide this man to wesshe their
eyes there with / And then he made a cross with the water upon each of their
eyes and besot almyty god to open their eyes And they all there received
their parfyght sight / And returned in gyuynge lawde and praysynge God of
their sight yeuen to them / by the merytes of saint Edward /

As the king on a time sat at the table with the queen / and her fader Earl
Goodwyn / and saw how Harold and Tostyne the two sons of Goodwyn played to
fore the king / but at the last the game turned in to ernest / and they began
to fight / And Harold took his brother by the here / and threw him to the
earth / And fylle upon him in great anger / and would have strangl^d him / but
if he had been let / Then the king demanded Goodwyn if he understood any
thing thereby / And he said nay forsothe / Then the king said / ye shall
see when they come to man's age / that one of them shall slay that other if
he can / And Harold which is the strenger shall put that other out of his
land / Then shall his brother Tostyn come again with the king of Norwey
and hold a bataylle against Harold his brother in England In the which both
the king of norwey / and Tostyne shall be slain / and al their hooste sauf a
few that shall escape / And the same Harold shall give him self to penance
for the death of his brother / and so escape / or else he shall be put out of his
kingdom / and deye wretchydly / The king was many times moeued and displesyd
with Goodwyn / For he mysused the kings power / and attempted the king in many
thyngis / that were vnleefull / And in all that he might / he labouryd to
bring out of consayte the kings cosyns and friends that came to him out of
Normandye / to thentent that he might have all the rewle about the king as
well secretly as out ward / And the king understanding his falsenes said but
little / But in a time as the king sat at his dinner with diverse lords and
gentiles about him / One of his servants Was almooste overthrown / as he
smote that one fo^e with that other / And yet the sadder foot sauyd al / and
kept him on his feet / which thing gaf occasion to the king to talk to his
lords / And tho two feet were lykened to two brethren / that if that one were
over charged that other should help and socoure him Then said the king / so
might my brother have been an help to me / and a supporter in time of need / if
he had not ben bytraid of goodwyn / Then goodwyne herynge these words of the
kings mouth / was soore aferd and said Sire ye deem that I should bytraye
your brother / I pray god that this Morcelle of bread may choke me if I
consented to his death / Then the king blessed the bread / and badde him ete
hit / And the morsel abode in his throat / and choked him / so that his
brethe was stopped / and so deyde wretchydly / Thene the king said draw the
traitor out of my presence / For now his traysone and falshede appyereth / On
an eester day when he had received our lord / and was set at his dinner In
the myddle of it when all was scylence / he fylle in to a smylyng / and after
in to a sadness / wherefore all that were there merueyled gretely / but none
durst axe of him what he mente / but after dinner duke harold followed him in to
his chamber / with a bishop and an Abbot that were of his preuy counceylle /
and demanded of him the cause of that thing / Then the king said / when
I remembryd at my dinner / the great benefetes of worship and dignyte / of metes
/ of drynkes / of servants / of arraye / and of all Rychesses and Ryalte
that I stood in at that time / And I referryd all that worship to almighty god
/ as my customme is / then our lord opened mine eyes / And I saw the seven
slepers lyenge in a cave in the Mount Celyon / beside the Cite of Ephesym / in
the same form and manner / as though I had been by them / And I smyled /
when I saw them turn them fro the right side to the lift side / But when I
understood what is sygnyfyed by the said tornynge / I had no cause to lawghe
/ but rather to morn / The tornynge sygnefyeth that the prophecye be fulfilled
/ that says / Surget gens co^tra gentem / that is to say / people sha^le arise
ageynste people / and a kingdom ageynste another / they have leyn many years
upon their right side / And they shall lie yet on there lift side lxx year / In
which time shall be greet bataylles / great pestylence / and greet moreyn /
great earth quaues / great hongre / and great derthe thorugh all the world / of
which saying of the king they gretely merueyled / And anon they sent to the
emperor to know if there were any such cite or hylle in his land / in which
such seven men should sleep / Then the Emperor meruaylynge sent to the
same hylle / and there fond the cave / and the seven martirs slepynge as they
had been deed / lyenge on the lift side euerychone / And then the emperor was
gretely abashed / of that sight / and commended gretely the holiness of saint
Edward the king / of England / which had the spyryte of prophecye / For
after his death began great Insurrections thorugh all the world / For the
paynyms destroyed a great part of Syrye / and threw down both monasteryes
and chirches / And what by pestylence and stroke of sword / streets / feldes /
and Towns lay full of deed men / the prince of greece was slain / The Emperor of
Rome was slain / The king of England / and the king of France were slain /
and all the other Royames of the world were gretely troubled with diverse
diseases / when the blessed king Edward had lived many years / and was fall
in to great age / it happed he came riding by a church in Essex called
Clauerynge / which was at that time in halowynge / and should be dedicate in
thonour of our lord and saint Johan theuangelyst / wherefore the king for great
devotion light down / and tarried while the church was in halowynge / And in
the time of procession A fair old man came to the king / and demanded of him
alms in the worship of god and saint Johan euangelyste / Then the king
fond nothing ready to give / ne his Amener was not present / but took of the
ryng fro his fyngre / and yaue it unto the pour man / whom the pour man
thanked and departed / And within certain years after two pylgryms of England
went in to the holy land for to vysyte holy places there / And as they
had lost their way / and were gone fro their felauship / and the night
approached / and they sorowed gretely as they that wyste notwhyder to goo / and
dredde sore to be perysshed among wild beestes / At the last they saw a fair
company of men arrayed in white clothing with two lyghtes borne a fore them /
And behind them there came a fair ancient man with white here for age / Then
these pylgryms thought to follow the lyte and drew nyhe / Then the old man
axyd them what they were / and of what Regyon / And they answered / that they
were pilgryms of England and had lost their felauship and way also / Then
this old man comforted them goodly / and brought them in to a fair cite /
where was a fair Cenacle honestly arrayed with all manner of deyntees / And
when they had well refresshyd them / and restyd there all night / On the
morn / this fair old man went with them / and brought them in the right
weye again / And he was glad to here them talk of the welfare and holiness
of their king saint Edward / And when he should depart fro them / then he
told them / what he was / and said / I am Johan theuangelyst / And say ye unto
Edward your king / that I great him well by the token that he yaf to me this
ring with his own hands at the halowynge of my church / which ryng ye
shall deliver to him agexne / And say ye to him / that he dispose his goods
/ For within six months he shall be in the Joy of heaven with me / where he
shall have his reward for his chastyte and for his good byuynge / And dread ye
not / for ye shall speed right well in your Journey / And ye shall come home
in short time / sauf and sound / And when he had delyuerd to them the ring
/ he departed fro them suddenly / And sone after they came home / and did their
message to the king and delyuerd to him the ryng / and said that saint Ioh^n
euangelyst sent it to him / And as soon as he herd that name / he was full of
joy / and for gladness let fall teerys fro his eyes ^euynge lawde and
thanking to almighty god / and to saint Johan his auowry / that he would
vouchesauf to late him have knowledge of his departing out of this world / Also
he had another token of saint Johan / and that was that the two pylgryms should
deye tofore him / which thing was prouyd true / for they lyuyd not long
after / And at the feste of Cristemasse the king was seek / And on the day of
thynnocentes he herd mass in the new Church of Westmynstre which he had
reedefyed / And then he gyuyng than kings unto almighty god / returned in to
his chamber sore seek / there abydyng the mercy of our lord / And all the
lords / gentiles / and comyns were in great heaviness when they understood
that the king might not live / remembrynge what welthe and prosperyte the land
had been in / during his days / And what Ieopardy hit was like to stand in /
after his dyscees / Then all things were committed to the queen whom he
louyd specially And she fulle dylygently mynystred to him all things
necessary / And when he was so feeble by sekenes that his naturalle hete was
almoost gone / he lay nyghe two days in a trance / as a man / that had been
rauysshed / And when he came to him self ayene they that were about him
merueyled gretely / For they wend verily that he should no more have spoken /
Notwithstanding after he spack with an hole spyryte these words / O thou
merciful lord god / that art infynyte almighty In whose power all things ben
put which chaungest Royammes and empyres / if tho things ben true / that
thou have showed to me / so grant to me space and strength to declare them
to my people / that if peradventure they give them to penance / they may have
grace and foryeuenes / Then almyty god yaf to him a new strength / that
passyth al man's reason / And that might not be without miracle / For before
that time he spack so soft that for feebleness he might not well be herd / And at
that time he spak with an hole breast these words following / When I was young
/ and dwelled in Normandye / I louyd well the felauship of good men / For he
that spak most relygyously and goodly / with him was I most conuersaunt / And
among all other there were tweyne / to whom I drew much for their honest
conversation / and for the holiness of their life / swetnes of their manners / and
their comfortable words / whom I saw translated in to heaven / For many years
gone they deyde / and now they have appyered to me by the suffraunce of god /
and have showed to me the state of my people / and what sins regne among them
/ And what vengeance shall be taken on them for their sins / Prestes have
offendyd / For they mynystre the holy sacraments with unclean thoughts and
pollute hands / And as an hired man / and not as a very shepeherde defend
not their sheep ne feed them / And as for princes and gentiles / they ben
founden falls and untrue / and felawes to fendes theuys and Robbers of the
Country / which have no dread of god / ne honor him / And true law is a
burden to them / and had in despyte / and cruelnes much used / and the
prelates keep not rightwysnes / they correct^ not their subgettis / ne teache ne
inform them as they should do And therefore our lord has now draw out his
swerd of vengeance to smite his peuple / This punysshement shall begin
within this year both by sword and wastyng this Royamme pytously / And th^nne
I began to syghe and morn for the trouble / that was coming to my people /
And said / if they would be turned and do penance shall not they have
foryeuenes / and god shall bless them again / And it was answered to me / the
hertes of the people ben so Indurate / and so blinded and their eeris so
stop^ed / that theywylle not here of no correction / ne they / be not moeued ne
provoked by no benefayttes that our lord yeueth them Then I axyd if there were
any remedy that might attempre the wrath of our lord / To whom it was ansuerd
in these words / A grene tree cut fro his stock shall he divided fro his
propre rote the space of three furlonge / And without man's hand shall torn
again to his old rote / and take again his sap / and floryssheth and
brings fourth fruyre / And when this is done / there may come remedy / And
when this was said / they were sodanly gone out of my syghte There was about
the king that time / the queen / Duke Harold her brother / Robert kepar of the
palais / And Stygande / which had defouled his faders bed / For whiles
Robert tharchebisshop of Caunterbury lived / the said Stygande put him down /
and came in by symonye / wherefore he was suspendid by the pope / And afterward
god took vengeance upon him / so that his belly bracke / and his bowellis
fylle out And so he deyd wretchidly / This Stygande gaf no credence to the
kings words / but descryued it to his age / and to the feebleness of the king /
and made it but a fantasye / but other / that were better auysed wept and
sorowed / and wrange their hands / and sent to our holy fader the pope /
yeuyng him Informacion of the same vysion / And our holy father wrote Epistles
to England exhortyng the people to do penance / but his writing prouffited not
But when king Harold had broken the oath / that he had made to duke william /
therefore he was slain in bataille / then they knew well that the prophecye of
saint Edward was comen For the^ue the lyberte of England made an end / And
then came in bondship and thraldom / That time England was al changed / And
I understand saint Dunston prophesied the same trouble coming / And after a
certain time he promised comfort also / Wherefore this foresaid vysyon may be
conuenyently expowned / as here follows / The tree signefyeth the Royame of
England / Whose grenesse and fayrenesse bitokeneth Rychesses / plentyuous and
honor of England. of Whom all worship proceeds / which worship has
proceeded of the true blood of the land / and of the true lygnage / which
descended fro Alured whom our holy fader the pope crowned and enoynted king /
as for the first king of the true lygne of England unto this holy king
Edward by succession / The tree is cut down fro the stock / when the Royame
is divided and translated from one seed or lygnage to an other / The space of
three furlonges / is the time of three kings / that is to say Harold / william
Conqueror / and william his sone / The coming again of the tree to the stock
without man's help / was when king Henry the first came in to this
Royamme / not by man's strength / but by very true love of his comyns He
took his sap and his very strength / when he wedded Molde the daughter of
the nece of saint Edward ioynynge to gydre the seed of England and of Normandye
/ And by the tree flowrysshed / whom Maulde themperesse sprange of their seed
/ And it brougth forth fruit / when of her came Henry the second / And thus
this two people were joined to gydre / if this exposycion displese any man /
late him expowne it better / or else late him abide a time / tylle it be
fulfilled / so that the prophecye of king Edward acorde to the prophecye of
saint Dunston / This holy king saint Edward knowing that his hour / drew
nyghe / spack to them / that stood weeping about him / And in comfortyng them
said / Forsothe / if ye louyd me / ye would pray / that I should pass fro this
world to the fader of heaven there to receive the joy which is promised to
all true Christian men / put ye awey your weeping / and speed forth my journey /
with prayers / with holy psalmes^ and with alms deeds / For though mine enemy
ye fe^de may not overcome me in my faith / yet there is none founden so parfite
but he will assaye and tempte to let / or to feer him / And then he
commanded the queen to her brother in commending her virtues unto his lords /
and declared to them their pure chastyte / For she was to him in open places as
his wife / and in secret places / as his suster / And he commanded also that
her dowayre should be made sure to her / And they that come with him out of
Normandye should be put to their chois / whether they would abide stylle in
England / and to be endowed with lyuelode after their degree / or else to
return again in to Normandy with a suffycyent reward / And he chaas his place
for his sepulture in the church of saint Peter / which he had new bylded And
said he should not long abide in this world / And when he beheld the queen
/ and saw her weep and syghe among / he said to her oftymes / My daughter
weep not / for I shall not dye / but I shall live / and shall depart fro the
land of death / And believe to see the goodness of god in the land of life / And
then he set his mind al in god / and yaf him self holy to the faith of
the Church / in the hope and promyses of Christ under the sacramentis of the
church / And among these words of praysynge he yielded up his spyryte unto
god / In the year of our lord M lxvj / when he had reigned in this land xxiij
year / and six months and xxvij days / the fourth day of Ianyuer / And as
his Cosyns and his lovers stood about this holy body / when the spyryte was
passed / they saw a merueylous beauty / and an heavenly sight in his face /
And when they looked on his naked body / they saw it shine with a merueylous
brightness / for the clernes of his vyrgynyte And then they wrapped the holy
body in pallys / And beryed it with great reverence and worship / and largely
alms was given for him / And all the lords spyrytuell and temporel were
present at the beryeng of him / than king god of the great benefaittes / that
he showed in this land during the life of the holy saint and king saint Edward
/ wherefore lawde / glory and honor be given to almyty god world without end
Amen /

The eight day after his beryeng there came a crepil to his Tomb to be helped of
his great disease / which many times before had received alms of the kings
hand / And he had be wasshen of the kings hand on cenethursdaye
Notwythstondyng the miracle of his curing was prolonged by the prouysyon of
god / and not showed in his life time / by cause that many miracles god showed
for him / In like wise he would show after his death / This Crepyl was called
Rauf / And was a norman borne / and the synewes of his arm were shronken to
gyder / that his feet were draw up to his buttokkis that he might not goo /
neither on his feet ne on his knees / but sat on an holowe vessel in manner of a
basyn / drawyng his body after him with his hondes / And when he came to the
Tomb / he besought almighty god and saint Edward deuoutely / that he might be
cured and heled of his disease / which in his life time had most lyuyd by his
alms / And when he had continued a while in his prayers / other peuple
that had compassion of him praid for him also / And at last he lift him self
up / and felt his synewes losed / And then he arose up and stood on his feet
/ and felt him self made parfyghtely hole for to do what he should / We have
read of the virtues that saint Edward had in helyng blind men in his living /
which our lord has not withdraw from him after his death / It happed that
thyrtty days after his beryeng / there came to his Tomb a man which had but
one eye ledyng after him six blind men each of them held other by the skyrte
/ And all they deuoutely prayed to god and to saint Edward / that they might
have their sight / and to be delyuerd of the great myserye / that they stood in
/ And much people came thither for to see what should befalle of this thing / And
when they saw how hertely these blind men prayde / then all the people
being moeuyd with pity knelyd down deuoutely / and prayed for them to god /
and to this holy saint / And anon as they had endyd their prayers All they
received parfyghtely their sight / And then each of them. that had been
blind lokyd fast on each other And thought it a new world with them / and
each inquired of other / if they might see / and they said ye / And all knelyd
down thankyng god full hertely / that by the meryces of saint Edward had
restored to them their sit parfyghtly / And also to their leder / which had
but one eye at his coming And had sight of the blind eye also / And so all
had their parfyght sight And after they returned home each in to his Country
gyuynge lawde and thankynges to god and this holly king / After this Harold
Arphage king of Norwey and Tostyn brother of king Harold of England came with a
great nauye and a great host and arrived in humbre / and there made werre
entendynge to conquer this land / how be it / the people began to resyste
them / but they were not of power to overcome them / And when Harold understood
this / he raised a great multitude of people to withstonde them / Then saint
Edward on a night appyered to an holy Monk which was Abbot of Rammesey / And
bad him go and tell to Harold that he should overcome his enemies / the which
intended to destroy and consume this Royamme of England / And say to him /
that he dread not / For I shall so conduyte him and his host / that he shall
have vyctorye / For I may not see ne suffer this Royamme of England to be
destroyed And when thou have told to him this he wy^le not believe the /
wherefore thou shall prove thy vision in this manner / late him think and set his
mind on what thing he will / And thou shall tell him / what he thinks /
For god shall show that to the / And then he shall give credence to thy
words On the morn the abbot of Rammesey named Alexis went to king harold and
told to him this visionn / And how he should by the aid of saint Edward
overcome his enemies / And when he herd hit first / he supoosed / hit had been
a fantasye / And when he showed to him his preuy thought / then he gaf faith
thereto / And went to the bataille / how be it / he was then seek in his
grynde of a pestilence botche / And slew Tostyne his brother / and Harold
Harfage / And right few or none escaped a live fro the bataille / Wherefore the
Englisshmen thanked god and saint Edward of their victory / In the monastery
of westmynstre there was a fair young man / which was blind / whom the Monks
had ordained to ring the bellys / And he had a customme daily to vysyte the
Tomb of saint Edward with certain prayers / And on a time as he prayed there
he fylle a sleep / And he herd a vois / that had him go and ring to the last
hour / And when he awoke / he saw saint Edward going to fore him like a
king with a Crown on his head / and had a merueylous light about him / And
he beheld him till he came to the hye altar / And then he saw him no more /
ne the light / but he had his sight ever after tylle his lives end / And
then he told unto the monks how he was helyd / and had his sight again by
this miracle /

Of the deposicion of saint Wulstan / And how he was restored again / When
William Conqueror had gotten al England / and had it under his power / then
he began to meddle with the Church / And by thaduys of Lanfrank the holy
Bishop Saint wulstan was challenged / that he was not able of lettrue ne of
connyng / for to occupye the Royamme and office of a Bishop / and was called
to fore Lanfranke / and wylled him to resign by the consent of the king / to
the said Lanfranke Archebisshop / that a man of gretter connyng might occupye
the dignyte / To whom Wulstan seyde / Forsothe fader I know well that I am
not worthy to have this dignyte / ne am not suffycyent to occupye so great a
charge / For I knew well mine uncunning at such time / when I was elect
thereto / but I was compellyd by our holy fader the pope and by good king Edward
/ And fith hit plesyth the counceylle that I shall resign / I shall gladly
resygne / but not to you / but to him / that compellyd me to take hit / and
then he departed incontynentfro thrachebisshop Lanfrank / and went strayte
te the tomb of saint Edward with his cross in his hand / And he said to saint
Edward as he had then ben a live / O thou holy and blessed king / thou
know well that I took this charge on me again my will / but by constraynt
of the pope and the / I obeyed to take hit / and it now so is that we have a
new king / new laws / and yeueth new sentences / in repreuyng the of thyn
error for so much as thou yauyst it to me / simple and uncunning man / And
me for the presumpcion that I would consent to take it / That time thou
myghtest well have been begyled / For thou were a frayel man / but now thou art
joined to god / where as thou maiste not be deceived / thou gave to me the
charge / And to the I here resign it again / And with that he fixed his staf
in to the hard stone of his tomb seyenge / take this / and give it to whom it
plesith the / And the hard stone / that lay upon his Tomb resoluyd by miracle
/ and received his Croo^ / or pastoral staf / and held it so fast / that it
might not be taken out by man's hand / And anon he did of thabyte of a
bishop / and did on a Cool / and stood among the Monks in such degree as he
did to fore er he was Bishop / And when word came / and was reported to them /
that had consentyd to his resignacion / they merueyled gretely / and were all
abashed / And some of them went to the Tomb / and would have pullyd out the
staf / but they couthe not moeue hit / And when tharchebisshop Lanfrank herd
thereof / He commanded to Gudulf bishop of rouchestre to go and fetch to him
the pastoralle staf / but when he came / he set hand on it / and pullid at hit
/ but the stone held hit so fast / that he might not moeue hit / wherefore he
was sore abashed and came to Lanfranke and told to him of this miracle /
Then the king and Lanfrank were abashed / And came both in their persons to
see this thing / And there maad their prayers / And after with great reverence
Lanfryke assayed and set hand on the staf for to have pullyd it out / but
it would not mean / Then the king / and the Archebisshop were sore aferd and
repentid them / And sent for to seche wulstan / whom they fond among the
monks / And brought him tofore the king and tharchebisshop / who anon knelyd
down and axid foryeuenes And Wulstan mekely kneled down / And praid them not
so to do to him / and humbly and mekely pardoned them / and praid
tharchebisshop humbly to bless him / then Lanfrank went to this holy man
wulstan and said / Brother / thy ryghtful symplycyte has been but little set by
among us / but our lord has made thy ryghtwysnes to shine like as a day sterre
/ but brother / we have tree spaced and erryd in Iugyng the good to be evil /
and the evil good / but our lord god has areysed the spyryte of saint Edward /
which has made void all our sentences / and thy symplenes is allowed to
fore god / wherefore come hyder to thy king and ouris saint Edward / and receive
again thy staf which he has denied to us / for we suppose he will deliver it
to you / then wulstan the servant of god mekely obeyed with great reverence
unto tharchebisshop / and went unto the Tomb where as the staf stood fast
fixed in the stone / and knelyng down saying / O blessed saint of god / I here
mekely submytte me to thy sentence / to whom sometime thou gauyst and chargist
me unworthy with this staf / if hit so plese the that thyn old sentence abide
/ then restore to me again this pastoral staf / and if it plese to the to
change it / so show to us to whom thou wylt / shall take it / and this seid /
he set his hand humbly and with great reverence on ye staf / and anon the
hard stone resoluyd / and let the staf to go out / as hit had been soft earth
or claye / and when they that stood about him saw this great miracle they wept
for joy / in gyuynge out largely teeres / and axyd him foryeuenes gyuyng laud
and praysyng unto almighty god / and to this holy king saint Edward / And ever
after king William had great devotion to vysyte the tomb of his Cosyn saint
Edward And did great cost toward the making of his shryne / How his holy body
was found incorrupt many years after / After this miracle was showed / there was
much talkyng of his holiness / And the devotion of the people encreaced daily
more and more / so that there were many diverse worshipful persons that
desired to see this holy body / For some said that it lay incorrupte / and
some said nay / and in this meke stryf they gate license of thabbot gilbert to
see it / and when the day was set that this holy body should be showed / there
came thither many worshipful men and wymmen of Religyon / among whom came Gu^dulf
bishop of Rouchestre / And this was six and thyrtty year after his beryenge /
that they opened his tomb / And when the stone was remeuyd / they felt a
merueylous sweet sauoure that all the church was replete thereof / as though
an odor aromatike had flowed out of the Tomb / And they fond the palle that
lay next his body as hoole and as fair as it was when he was buried / And when
the palle was take of / they drew forth his arms / they moeued his fyngers
and his toes / and they were bowyng and hoole / as they had be newely buried
/ And in his flesh was fou^den no corrupcion / but it was fair and fressh of
color / pure and bryghter than glass whytter than snow / And it seemed a body
gloryfyed / And they fered to discouere his vysage / but gundulph which was
hardyer than another with devotion vnbonde his head / And the first that
appyeryd was the fair hoor here of his head / and then he thought to take
some thereof for a relyque. and with reverence and dread plucked there at / but
he could none have out / for they were as fast as they were when he was a live
Then said thabbot / ffader suffer him to lie in rest / and ate^tpte not to
mynuysshe yt that our lord has so long prescruyd and kept hole / Then the
palle in which the holy body was wrappid was taken awey / and another of the
same valor was fette / and the holy body leid therein and couerd again his
tomb with full great reverence / abydyng the great resurection / How vengeance
was showed to a damoiselle that blasphemyd saint Edward / In the Cite of london
there was a noble woman which was ryt connyng in sylke work / which was
desired tembrawdre certain garments to the countess of gloucettre which
then was young lusty / fresshe and newely wedded / and would have them made in
short space / And when the festful day of saint Edward approchyd / this noble
woman was sore troublid in her mind / for she dradde thyndignacion of the
great lady / if her garments were not ready at time set / And also she dradde
to work on ye day of saint Edward / for it was both synful and perilous /
Then she said to a young damoiselle / that was felawe with her / and wrought
in the same work / what think ye best now / either to displese this lady or
else this good saint Edward / and she answered is this not that Edward whom the
chorles of the country worshipe / as he were a god / and she said yet more /
what have I to do with him / I will no more worshipe him / than if he were a
chorle / then this noble woman was sore abashed and moeuyd with her that
said such words of blasphemy to this holy saint / And she all to beat her
forto be in pees / and she of frowardnes blasphemyd him more and more / and
then suddenly she was smeton with a palsy / so that her mouth was drawn to
her ere / and also she had lost her speech and foomyd at mouth like a bore /
and gru^ted / her teeth to gydre merueylously / and was sore punysshed in all
her membris and when this noble woman saw thie / she was full heavy that she had
beten her by cause almyty god had so punysshed her / and wept full bytterly /
and when hit was known in the cite / her neybours came some for to comfort her
/ and some to wondre upon her so lyeng / and then there came a worshipful man
to visyte her / and counceiled that she should be carried by water unto the
shryne of saint edward and to pray to god there / that by the merytes of the
holy saint Edward he would show some miracle for her / and when she was so
brought thither / much people praid for her / but they had not their intent anon
/ but abode in her prayers till mydnyght that matyns began / and then they
praid the Monks to pray for her / And when they had done matyns / they come
to the shryne also / and praid for this damoiselle which lay there in full
great pain and torment / and when the holy monks had praide for her a good
while / then this damoyselle arose up al hole / and demanded why they wept /
and made so much sorrow And when they saw her mouth in his right place / and
al her membrys restored again / they were full of joy / and yaf laud and
thankynges unto almighty god and to his holy king and Confessoure saint Edward
/ How a Monk was heled of a fever quartane / In thabbay of westmynstre there was
a virtuous monk and connyng named Gylberd which was sore vexyd with a fever
quartane fro the month of Iuyl to Crystemas / and consumed like a dry image /
wherefore he praide god to relece his pain or take him out of this world / And
on Cristemasse night / he took heart to him / and went to matyns with his
brethren / And when he herd the gospel how a little child was borne and yeuen
to us fro the fader of heaven / whose mother was a pure vyrgyne / he had so
great devotion that his mind was rauysshed with so great joy that he felt no
disease two days after / And after tho two days the fever came again and
vexyd him contynuelly unto the fest of saint Edward / which is alwey in the
vygyle of the pyphanye / and that day in the hyhe mass time he came to the
tomb of saint Edward / and fill down plat in great devotion / and weeping said
thus / O thou my lord and my king how long will thou forgete me / how long
shall I suffer this pain / how long shall thou torn thy face fro me / where
ben all the great miracles that our faders have told to us done in their
days / thou have helped many strangers / but me that am in thine own church
thou forgetest / And closest to me the yate of thy pity would god that I myt
deye / I am norisshed in pain / and may not deye / my life is sorrow to me /
but it can have none end / and I desire death / and can not have it what shall I
strive with the / but I beseech the good king / laudable prince / and sweet
patron / moeue thy bowellis of mercy on me / if it plese the / give me health
or else late me deye anon / and among these words the teres brake out of his
eyes / and sobbynges fro his heart / that he could not speak with his mouth /
but with his affection / And when mass was done / he aroose up fro prayer all
hoole / and felt all his membrys merueylously refresshyd with a new
strength / And entryd in and axyd after mete and drink / and anon he felt
him self that he had received again his strength / And ever after he was
moeued with great devotion unto the glorious saint Edward by whoos merytees he
was delyuerd fro his sekenes and disease / And in like wise a knight named
Geryn / was heled that same day / a year after of the fever quartane / which
came that same day unto the shryne / and herd the same Monk / that had so be
heled / which then was pryour / make a sermon in which he told of the
miracle / how he was hoole / And after the Sermon this knight thought / he would
not ceesse / but deuoutely pray this holy saint till he were hole / and abode
there prayenge all that day and night following till the Monks came to matyns
whom he praid to pray for him / And when they had prayed a good while he
felt him self made parfyghtly hole / And then he with all the people gaf
thankynges to our lord almighty god and saint Edward for his delyueraunce /
Also a nonne of berkynge / that had been seek twelve months and nyghe consumed
awey had a vision on a night / by which she understood that she should go to
saint Edword / and be hoole / And she making her prayers to saint Edward / and
at such time as her sekenes came / she entryd in to her oratory And said the
seven psalms and letanye / and when she did so twyes / al her pain was gone /
and was made parfitely hole / and thanked almighty god / which by ye merytes
of saint Edward had heled her / and soon after came to westmynstre in
pylgremage / And there did show this miracle / and told how she was made hole
/ Also there was a Mo^k of Westmynstre / which was acustomed to say every day v
psalms in the worship of god and saint Edward / which Monk was grieved with
three manner sekenesses / For he had on his arm a congellacion of blood in
manner of a postomme / he had also in his breast a straytnes / that uneath
he might draw his breast / Also he had in his foot a merueylous swellyng / and
a great / that he might not goo / but with great pain / And when the yearly
feast was hallowed / he saw his brethren go to the church at mydnyght for to
ring the bellys / And he was right sorry that he might not do the same /
Notwithstondyng he payned him self and went thither / and said the seven
psalms / and when he had done and saw his brethren ring meryly / he said in
his prayer to saint Edward / O thou my good king / I beseech the to pray for
me / that I may have strength to do / as I see my brethren do / For I
commytte me fully to thy might / And I believe verily that thou wylt suffer me
no longer in this great disease / And when he had made an end of his prayers /
he arose up / and went to the bellys for to ring them / And anon the postomme
of his arm brake / And when the foul matter was out / he felt him self hole
of that disease / Then his most pain was in his breast / and he went
again to pray and to give thankynges to god / and to saint Edward of the
delyueraunce of his postomme / And there he prayed full deuoutely / that he
might be delyuerd of the disease of his breast / and when he aroos fro prayer /
he felt his heart made all hole fro the sekenes yt he had in his breast Then
he felt no disease / but on his foot / and when he come among his brethren
in the fraitour / he told them hou he was delyuerd fro tweyne of his sekenesses
/ and when they saw him / they meruayled gretely / and besought almighty god
and saint Edward that he might be delyuerd of that disese in his foot / And at
night when he went to his bed / he put him self holy in the merits of saint
Edward / And when he arose he felt no pain / but put down his hond to his
foot to feel how it was and he felt that the swellyng was gone he lepe out of
his bed and told to his brethren with full great joy how he was made
parfightly hole as ever he was / Then they al were full glad / and went with
him to the church to give thankynges and praisynges to almyty god and to his
holy confessor saint Edward for these miracles and for his delyuerau^ce fro
the ij sekenesses / wherefore god be praised in his servant without end / ame^

Thus ends the life of saint Edward king and Confessor
Here follows of saint Luke Theuangelist And first of his name
LUke is as much to say as arysynge or enhauncynge him self / Or Luke is said
of light / he was reysyng him self fro ye love of the world and enhauncyng in
to the love of god And he was also light of the world for he enlumyned the
universal world by holy predicacion / And hereof says saint Ma^hewe / Mathei
quinto / ye ben the light of the world / the light of the world is the son /
And that lyzt has heyght in his sete or syege / And hereof says Ecclesiastes
the xxvj Chapter / the son rysynge in the world is in the right hyhe things
of god / he has delight in beholding / And as it is said Ecclesiastes vndecimo
/ The light of the son is sweet / And hit is delytable to the eyes / to see
the son / He has swyftnes in his moeuyng as it is said in the second book of
Esdre the fourth chapter / The earth is great / and the heaven is hyhe / And
the course of the son is swyft / and has prouffyte in effect / For after the
philosophre man engend^th man and the son / And thus Luke had hyhenes by the
love of things celestyalle / delectable by sweet conversation / Swyftnes by
fervent predicacion / And vtylyte and prouffyte by consceypcion and writing of
his doctrine /

Of saint Luke euangelyst
LUke was of the nation of Syrye / And Anthyochyen by art of medycyne And
after sum he was one of lxxij disciples of our lord /

Saint Iheromme says that he was discyple of thappostles and not of our lord /
And the gloss upon the xxv chapter of the book of Exodi sygnefyeth / that he
joined not to our lord when he preached / but he came to the faith after his
resurection / But it is more to be holden that he was none of the lxxij
disciples / though sum hold oppynyon that he was one / But he was of right
great perfection of life and much well ordained as toward god / And as
touching his neighbor / as touching him self / and as towchynge his office /
and in sign of these four manners of ordenaunces / he was descryued to have
four faces / that is to wete / the face of a man / the face of a lion / the
face of an ox / and the face of an egle and each of these bestes had four
faces and four wynghes / as it is said in Ezechyell the first chapter / And
by cause it may the better be seen / late us ymagyne some be / that has his
head four square / and in every square a face / so that the face of a man be to
fore / and on the right side the face of the lion / and on the lift side / the
face of the ox / and behind the face of thaygle / and by cause that the face
of thaygle appyerid above the other for the length of the neck / therefore hit is
said that this face was above / and each of these four had four pens / For
when every be was quadrate as we may ymagyne / In a quadrate ben four
corners / and every corner was a pen / By these four beestes after that
saints sayen / ben signefyed the four euangelystes / Of whom each of them
had four faces in writing / that is to wete of humanite / of the passion of
the resurection / and of the dyuynyte / how be it / these things ben
syngulerly to synguler / For after saint Iheromme Mathewe is signyfyed in the
man / For he was syngulerly meued to speak of thumanyte of our lord Luke was
fygured in the Ox / For he devised about the presthode of Ihesu Christ / Mark
was fygured in the lion / For he wrote more clearly of the resurection / For as
sum say the fawnes of the lion ben as they were deed unto the third day /
but by the brayeng of the lion they ben raised at the third day / And therefore
he began in the cry of predicacion / Johan is fygured as an Egle / which
flees highest of the four / For he wrote of the dyuynyte of Ihesu Christ / For
in him ben wreton four things / he was a man borne of the vyrgyne / he was an
ox in his passion / A lion in his resurection / And an Egle in his ascencion /
And by these four faces it is well showed / that luke was ryghtfully ordained in
these four manners For by the face of a man it is showed / that he was
ryghtfully ordained / as touching his neighbor how he ought by reason teache
him draw him by debonayrte / and nourysshe him by lyberalyte / for a man is a
best resonoble / debonayre and lyberalle / by the face of an Egle it is showed
that he was ryghtfully redeyned / as towchyng god / For in him the eye of
understanding beheld god by contemplacion / and the eye of his desire was to
him by thought or effect / And old age Was put awey by new conversation /
The Egle is of sharp sight / so that he beholds well without moeuyng of his
eye the raye of the son / And when he is merueylous high in the air / he
sees well the small fysshes in the sea / he has also his beck much crooked /
so that he is let to take his mete / he sharpeth it / and whetteth it
against a stone / and makes it couenable to the usage of his fedynge / And
when he is roasted by the hot son / he throws him self down by greet
forse in to a fontayne / And takes away his old age by the hete of the son /
and changes his feathers / and takes awey the derkenes of his eyes / By the
face of the lion it is showed how he was ordained as towchyng him self / For he
had noblesse by honest of manners / and holy conversation / he had
subtylytee for teschewe the lyggynge in a wait of his enemies And he had
suffraunce for to have pity on them / that were tormentid by afflyctyon / The
lion is a noble best / For he is king of beestes / he is subtle / he defaceth
his traces and stappes with his taille when he flees / so that he should not
be founden / he is suffryng / For he suffryth the quartayne / By the face of an
ox / hit is showed / how he was ordained as touching his office / that was to
write the gospel / For he proceeded morally / that is to say by moralyte /
that he began fro the natyuyte / and childhode of Ihesu Christ And so proceeded
little and little unto his last consummacion / he began discretely / And that
was after other two evangelists that if they had left any thing / he should
write hit / And that which they had suffycyently said / he should leave / he was
well manerd / that is to say well learned and enduced in the sacrefyses and
works of the temple / as it appiereth in the beginning / in the myddle / and
in the end / The Ox is a moralle be / and has his foot cloven / by which
is discrecion understood / and it is a best sacrefysable / And truly how that
Luke was ordeygned in the four things hit is better showed in the ordinance
of his life / First as towchynge his ordenaunce unto god / After saint Bernard
he was ordained in three manners / that is by affection and desire / by thought
and Intencion / thaffection ought to be holy / the thought clean / And
entencion rytfull / he had the affection holy / For he was fulle of the holy ghost / like as Iheromme says in his prologue upon Luke / he went in to
Bythynye fulle of the holy ghost / Secondly he had a clean thought / For
he was a vyrgyne in body and mind / in which is noted clennesse of thought /
Thirdly he had ryghtfull intencion / For in all things that he did he sought
the honor of god / And of these two last things it is said in the prologue
upon thactes of Appostles / he was with out sin / and abode in vyrgynyte /
and this is touching the clennesse of thought / he louyd best to serve our
lord / That is to the honor of our lord / This is as to wchyng the ryghtfulle
intencion / Fourthly / he was ordained as towchyng his neighbor / we ben
ordained to our neighbor / when we do that we ought to do / After Rychard of
saint Victour / there ben three things that we owe to our neighbor / that is
our power / our knowledge / and our will / and late the fourth be put to /
that is / all that we may do / Our power in helpyng him / our knoulege in
counceylyng him / Our will in his desires / and our deeds in seruyses / As
towchyng to these four / saint Luke was ordained / For he gaf first to his
neighbor / his power in aydynge / and obsequyes / And that appiereth by that
he was joined to pawle in his trybulacions / and would not depart fro him / but
was helpyng him in his prechynges / like as it is wreton in the Epistle of
pawle in the second chapter to Thymothee saying / luke is only with me / In
that he says only with me / hit sygnyfyeth that he was an helpar / as that he
gaf to him comfort and aid / And in that he said only / it signyfyeth that he
joined to him fermely And he said in the eygthe Chapter / to the Corynthyens /
he is not allone / but he is ordained of the Chirches to be felawe of our
pylgremage / Secondly / he gaf his knowledge to his neighbor in counceylles /
he gaf then his knowledge to his neighbor / when he wrote to his neighbors
the doctrine of thappostles and of the gospel that he knew / And hereof he
berith him self wytnes in his prologue saying / it is mine auys / and I assente
good thephyle to write to the right well of the beginning by order / so that
thou know the truth of the words / of which thou art taught / And it
appyrreth well that he gaf his knowledge in counceyls to his neighbors by the
words that Iheromme says in his prologue / that is to wete / that his words
ben medecyne unto a seek soul / Thyrdly he gaf his will unto the desires of
his neighbor / And that appyereth by that / that he desires / that they should
have health perdurable / like as pawle says to the Colocenses / Luke the leche
saleweth you / that is to say / think ye to have health perdurable / for he
desires it to you / Fourthly he gaf to his neighbor his deed in their
seruyses / And it appiereth by that / that he supposed that our lord had be a
strange man / and he received him in to his hows / and did to him all the
seruyse of charity / For he was felawe to Cleophas when they went to Emaus /
as sum say / And Gregorye says in his morallys that Ambrose says / it was
another of whom he names the name / Thyrdyly / he was well ordained / as
touching him self And after saint Bernard three things there ben that ordeyne a
man right well as touching him self / and makes him holy / that is to live
sobyrly / and ryghtful labor / and a debonayr wit / And after saint Bernard
each of these three is divided in to three / that is to live sobyrly if we have
compaynably contynently / and humbly / Ryghtfull work is / if he be ryghtfull
/ discrete / and fruytfull / Ryghtfull by good entencion / Discrete by mesure /
and fruytfulle by edyfycacion / The wit is debonayre when our faith feleth
god to be sovereign good / So that by his puyssaunce we believe / that our
Infyrmyte be helped by his power / our ygnoraunce be corrected by his wisdom
/ And that our wickedness be diffaced by his bounte / And thus says Bernard /
In all these things was saint Luke well ordained / He had first sobre
living in treble manner / For he lived contynently / For as saint Iheromme
wytnessith of him in the prolologue upon Luke / he had never wyfne children /
he lived compaynably / and that is signefyed of him where it is said of him and
Cleophas in thoppynyon before said / Two disciples went that same day et cetera
/ Felauship is signyfyed in that he says two disciples that is to say well
manerd / Thyrdly he lived humbly / of which humylyte is showed of that he
expressyd the name of his felawe Cleophas / and spak not of his own name / And
after thoppynyon of some Luke named not his name for mekenes / Secondly / he
had ryghtful work and deed / and his work was ryghtfull by Intencion / And
that is sygnefyed in his collecte where hit is said Carnis mortificacionem
ingiter in corpore suo pro tui nominis amore portauit / he bare in his body
mortificacion of his flesh for the love of thy name / he was discrete by at
temperaunce / And therefore he was fygured in the form of an ox / which has
the foot cloven / by which the virtue of discrecion is expressyd / he was also
fruytful by edificacion / he was so fruytfull to his neighbors that he was
holden most dear of all men / Wherefore ad Colocenses quarto He was called of
thoppostle most derest Luke the leche saleweth you / Thyrdly he had a meke
wit / For he byleuyd and confessyd in his gospel god to be soueraynly mighty
/ soueraynly wise / and soueraynly good / Of two the first it is said in the
iiij chappytre / They all were abashed in his doctrine / For the word of him
was in his power / And of the third / it appyerith in the xviij chapter where
he says / there is none good / but god allone / Fourthly and last he was right
well ordained / as touching his office / the which was to write the gospel /
and in this appierith that he was ordained by cause that the said gospel is
enoblysshed with much truth / hit is full of much prouffyte / hit is
embelysshed with much honest / And auctorysed by great auctoryte / It is
first ennoblysshed with much truth / For there ben three trouthes / that is
of life / of ryghtwysnes / and of doctrine / Truth of life is concordaunce of
the hand to the tongue / Truth of ryghtwysnes is concordaunce of the
sentence to the cause / And truth of doctrine is concordaunce of the thing to
the understanding / And the gospel is ennoblysshed by this treble veryte / And
that this treble veryte is showed in the gospel / luke shows that Ihesu
Christ had in him this treble veryte / And that he taught it to other / and
shows that god had this truth by the wytnes of his adversaries / And that
says he in the xxvij Chappytre / Master we know well / that thou art true
and techest and saiste ryghtfully / that is the veryte of the doctrine / but
thou techest in truth the way of god / that is the truth of life For good
life is the way of god / Secondly he shows in his Gospelle / that Ihesu
Criste taught this treble truth / First he taught the troth of life / the
which is in keeping the commandments of god / whereof hit is said / thou
shall love thy lord God / Do that / And thou shall live / And when a
pharysee demanded our lord / what shall I do for to possede the everlasting
lyf^ And he said / know thou not the commandments Thou shall not slay /
thou shall do no theft / ne thou shall do no aduoultry Secondly there is
taught the veryte of doctrine / wherefore he said to sum / that peruertid this
troth the enleue^th chapter / Woo be to you pharisees that tithe the people et
cetera / and pass over the Judgment and charity of God / Also in the same /
woo be to you wysemen of law / which have taken the keye of science / Thirdly
is taught the truth of ryghtwysnes where hit is said / yield ye that longs
to the emperor / And that ye owe to god to god And he seyth the xix Chapter /
They that been mine enemies / and will not that I regne upon them / bring them
hither / and slay them to fore me / And he says in the thyrtenthe chapter /
where he speaks of the dome / that he shall say to them that been repreuyd
depart fro me ye that have done wyckednes / Secondly / his gospel is full of
much prouffite / whereof Powle and him self write that he was a leche or a
phisicyen / wherefore in his gospel hit is signyfyed / that he made ready for us
medycyne most prouffytable / There is treble medycyne / Curyng preseruyng and
amendynge / And this treble medycyne shows saint Luke in his gospelle / that
the leche celestyall has made ready / The medicine curing is that / which
cures the maladye / and that is penance / which takes awey all maladyes
spyrytuell / And this nedycyne says he / that the celestyall leche has made
ready for us / when he says / Hele ye them / that be contryte of heart / And
preche ye to the caytyues the remyssion of sins / And in the fyfthe chapter
he says / I am not come to call the Just and true men / but the sinners to
penance / The Medycyne amendyng is that encreaceth health / And that is the
obseruacion of counseylle / For good counceyll makes a man better and more
parfyghte / This Medecyne shows us the heavenly leche when he says in the
eyghtenth chapter / Selle all that ever thou have and give to pour men /

The medecyne preseruatyf / is that which preserves fro falling / And this is
theschewyng of thoccasions to sin / and fro euylle company / And this
medecyne shows to us the heavenly leche when he says in the twellfth
chappytre / keep you fro the mete of the pharysees / and there he techeth us
teschewe the companyes of shrewes and euylle men / Or it may be said that the
said Gospel is replenysshed with much prouffyte / by cause that all virtue is
contyened therein / And hereof says saint Ambrose / luke compryseth in his
Gospel all the virtues of wisdom in hystorye / he enseigned the natyuyte /
when he showed thyncarnacion of our lord to have be made of the holy ghost But
Dauyd enseygned naturell wisdom when he said / Send out the holy ghoost /
and they shall be created And when he enseygned derkenes / made in the time of
the passion of Ihesu Christ / and tremblyng of the earth And the son had
wythdrawen her light and rays / And he taught moralyte when he taught manners
in his blessidnes / he taught reasonable things when he said / he that is true
in little things / he is true in great things / And without this treble
wisdom / the mysterye of the Trynyte ne of our faith may not be / that is to
wete Wisdom naturelle / Reasonable / and Moralle / And this is that saint
Ambrose says / Thyrdly / His gospel is embelysshed and made fair with much
honest / so that the style and manner of spekyng is much honest and fair

And three things be conuenyent to this that sum men hold in his dictes
honest and beauty / the which saint Austyn techeth / That is to wete / that
it please that it appyere and moeue / that it please / he ought to speak
ornatly / that it appyere that he ought to speak apertly / that it moeue that
he speak fervently / And this manner had Lucas in writing and in prechyng / Of
two the first hit is said in the viij Chapter to the Corynthyens / We sent
with him a brother / the gloss / Barnabe or Luke / of whom the praysynge is in all Chirches of the gospel / In this that he said the praysyng of him is
sygnefyed / that he spak ornatly / in this that he said in all Chirches / hit
is signefyed / that he spak apertly / And that he spak fervently hit appieryd
when he said / was not then our heart brennyng within us in the love of
Ihesu when he spoke with us in the way /

Fourthly his gospelle is auctorysed by Auctoryte of many saints / What
merueyle was it though it were auctorysed of many / when it was auctorysed
first of the fader / whereof Iheromye seyth in the xxxj Chappytre / Lo the days
shall come our lord says / I shall make a new covenant with the house of
Israel and of Judah / not after the covenant that I made with their faders
but this shall be the covenant says our lord / I shall give my law in to
the bowellys of them /

And he speaks plainly to the letter of doctrine of the Gospel / Secondly hit
is enforced of the Son / For he says in the same Gospel the one and
twentyest Chapter / Heaven and earth shall pass / And my word shall not perysshe
/ Thirdly he is enspyred of the holy ghoost / whereof saint Iheromme says in
his prologue upon Luke / He wrote this gospel in the parties of Achaye by
admonestment of the holy ghost / Fourthly he was to fore fygured of the Angels
/ For he was prefygured of the same Aungel Of whom thappostle says in the
xiiij Chapter / I saw the Angel fleyng by the mids of heaven / And had the
gospel perdurable / This is said perdurable / For it is made perdurable / that
is of Ihesu Christ / Fyfthly the Gospel was pronounced of the prophets / that
Ezechyel the prophet pronounced to for this Gospel When he said that one of
these beestes should have the face of an ox / wherefore the gospel of Luke is
signefyed / as it is said to fore / And when Ezechyel seid in the second
Chapter / that he had seen the book that was wreton without and within / In
which was wreton the lamentacion song / By this book is understand the
gospel of Luke that is wreton within for to hyde the mysterye of profoundenesse
/ and without for the showing of thystory In which also ben contained the
lamentacion of the passion / the Joy of the resurection / and the woo of the
eternal dampnacion / as it appieryth the xj Chapter / where many woes ben
put Sixthly the gospel was showed of the vyrgyne / For the blessed vyrgyne
marye kept and heled dylygently al these things in her heart / as it is said
Luce secundo / to the end that she should afterward show them to the wrytars
as the gloss says / that all things / that were done and said of our lord
Ihesu christ / she knew and retained them in her mind / So that when she was
required of the wrytars or of the prechers of thyncarnacion / and of al other
things she might express them suffycyently like as it was done / and were in
deed / whereof saint Bernard assygneth the reason why the Aungel of our lord
showed to the blessed vyrgyne the conceyuyng of Elyzabeth /

The conceyuynge of Elyzabeth was showed to Marye by cause of the coming now
of our savior / and now of his messager that came to fore him / The cause why
she retained the ordinance of these things was by cause that she might the
better show to wrytars and prechours the truth of the Gospel / This is she
that fully fro the beginning was Instruct of the celestyal mysteryes / And it
is to be byleuyd that theuangelystes inquired of her many things / And she
certyfyed them truly / And specially that the blessed Luke had recours to her /
like as to the Arc of the testament / And was certyfyed of her many things /
And specially of such things / as apperteyned to her / as of the salutacion
of the Angel Gabryel / of the natyuyte of Ihesu Christ / and of such other
things / as Luke speaks only / Seventhly the Gospel was showed of the
Appostles / For Luke had not ben with Christ in all his acts and miracles /
therefore he wrote his gospel / after that thappostles that had been present
showed and reported to him like as he shows in his prologue saying / like as
they that had seen him fro the beginning / and had been mynystres with him /
and herd his words informed and told to me / And by cause hit is accustomme in
double manner to bear witness / It is of things seen / and of things herd /
Therefore says saint Austyn / our lord would have two witnesses of things seen
/ they were Johan and Mathewe / And two of things herd / and they were mark
and Luke / And by cause that the witness of things seen ben more ferme and
more certain than of things herd / Therefore says saint Augustyn / The two
gospels that been of things seen / ben set first and last / And the other
that been of herynge ben set in the myddle / like as they were the strenger
and more certain of / and by the other tweyne /

Eyghtly / this gospel is merueylously approuyd of saint Powle / when he
brings the Gospel of Luke to the confirmacion of his sayenges / and dictes /
whereof saint Ieromme says in the book of noble men / That sum men have
suspecyon that alwey When Saint Powle says in his Epystles / Secundum
euangelium meum / that is after my Gospel / that is sygnefyed the volume of
Luke / And he approuyd his gospel / when he wrote of him / Secundo ad
Coryntheos octauo / of whom the laud and praysynge is in the gospel in all
the church / It is read in thystorye of Antyoche that the Christian men that
were besyeged of a great multitude of turks / and did to them many mescheues
and were tormentid with hongre and ylle hap / But when they were pleynly
conuertid to our lord by penance / A man full of clerenes in white vestymentes
appyeryd to a man that woke in the church of our lady of Trypolyn / And when
he demanded him who he was / he said / that he was Luk that came fro Antyoche
/ where our lord had assemblyd the chyualrye of Heuene / and his appostles for
to fight for his pilgryms against the Turks Then the Christian men enhardyed
them self and disconfyted all the hooste of the Turks /

Thus ends the life of saint Luke theuangelist
Here follows the life of saint Crisaunt And first of his name And of saint
Daria And of her name
CRysaunt is said as grown and multyplyed of god / For when his Fader
naturelle would have made him to sacrefyce unto thydolles / God gaf to him force
and power to contrary and gaynsaye his fader / and yield him self to god /
Daria is said of dare to give / and of dya / which is as much to say as
tweyne / For she gaf her to two things / First will to do evil / when she
had will to draw Crysaunt to sacrefyse thydolles / And after she gaf her to
good will / when Crysaunt had conuertid her to God /

Of saint Crisaunt and Saint Daria
CRisaunt was sone of a right noble man / that was named Polyme / when the
fader saw / that his sone was taught in the faith of Ihesu christ And that he
couth not withdraw him there fro / and make him do sacryfyce to thydolles / he
commanded that he should be closed in a strong hold / and put to him five
maidens for to with draw him with blaundysshyng and fair Words / And then
he prayed god that he should not be surmounted with no flesshely desire of these
euylle bestes / and anon these maidens were so overcome with sleep / that
they might not take neither mete ne drink / as long as they were there / but
as soon as they were out they took both mete and drink / And one Daria a
noble and a wise virgyne of the goddess vesta arrayed her nobly with clothes /
as she had been a goddess / And prayed that she might be laten enter in to
crysaunt / And that she would restore him to thydolles and to his fader / And
when she was comen in / Crysaunt repreuyd her of the pride of her vesture And
she answered / that she had not done it for pride but for to draw him to do
sacryfyce to thydolles / and restore him to his fader / And then Crysaunt
repreuyd her / by cause she worshipped them as gods / For they had been in
their times evil and sinners and haunted common wymmen / And Daria answered /
the philosophres felt thelementes by the names of men / and Crysaunt said to
her / if one worshipe therthe as a goddess / And another ere and labor the
earth as a Chorle or a plough man / To whom gives the earth most / It is
preuyd that it gives more to ye ploughman than to him that worshipeth it / And
in like wise he said of the sea / and of other elements / And then Crysaunt
and Daria conuertid of him / coupled them to gydre by the grace of the holy
ghoost / and feigned to be joined by carnal marriage / and conuertid many other
to ou^e lord / For claudyen / which had been tormentour of them they conuertid
to the faith of our lord with his wife and Children / and many other knights
/ and after this Crysaunt was enclosed in a stynkynge prison by the
commandment of Numeryne / but the stenche was anon turned in to a right
sweet odor and sauoure / And Daria was brought to ye bordel but a lion yt was
in the Amphyatre came and kept the door of the bordelle / And then there was
sent thither a man to defloure and corrumpe the vyrgyne / but anon he was taken
of the lion / And the lion began to look on the vyrgyne / like as he
demanded what he should do with the caytyf / And the vyrgyne commanded that he
should not mysdo him / but late him go / And anon he was conuertid / and ran
thorugh the cite And began to cry that Daria was a goddess / And then
hunters were sent thither for to take the lion / And they anon fylle down to
the feet of the vyrgyne / and were conuertid by her / And then the provost
commanded to make a great fire within thentre of the bordell / so that the
lion should be burnt with Daria / And the lion considering well this thing
dredde / and wrynge took license of the vyrgyne / and went whyder he would
without hurtynge of any body / And when the prouoste had done to Crysaunt and
daria many diverse torments / and might not grieve them / at the last they
being married without corrupcion were put in a deep pytte / and thrown on them
earth and stones / And so were conse^^ate martirs of Christ

Thus ends the life of saint Crisaunt And of Daria
Here follows the passion of enleuen thousand vyrgyns
THe passion of enleuen thousand vyrgyns was hallowed in this manner / In
Brytayn was a christian king named Notus or Maurus which engendryd a daughter
named Vrsula / This daughter shone full of merueylous honest / wisdom and
beauty And her fame and reno^mee was born al about / And the king of England
which then was right mighty / And subdued many nations to his empire herd
the renommee of her and said / that he should be well happy / if this vyrgyne
might be coupled to his sone by marriage / And the young man had great desire and
will to have her / And there was a solemn embassade to the fader of vrsula /
and promised greet promesses / and said many fair words for to have her /
and also made many manaces / if they returned vaynly to their lord / And
then the king of Brytayne began to be much anguysshous / by cause that she
that was ennoblysshed in the faith of Ihesu Criste should be wedded to him that
adoured ydolles / by cause that he wist well / she would not consent in no
manner / And also by cause he doubted much the cruelte of the king / And she
that was dyuynely inspyred / did so much to her fader / that she consented to
the marriage by such a condycion / that for to solace her / he should send to
her fader x vyrgyns / And to her self / and to them ten other virgyns he should
send to each a thousand vyrgyns / and should give to her space of three year
for to dedycate her vyrgynyte / And the young man should be baptized / and in
these three year he should be informed in the faith sufficiently / so that by
wise counceylle / and by virtue of the condycyon made / he should withdraw fro
her his courage / but this yonglyng received this condicyon gladly / and hasted
his fader / and was baptized / And commanded all that vrsula had required
should be done / And the fader of the vyrgyne ordained that his daughter whom
he most louyd / and the other that had need / of comfort of men and seruyse /
ordained in their company good men for to serve them / Then virgynes came fro
all parties / and men came for to see this great company And many Bisshops came
for to goo with them in their pylgremage / Emonge whom was pantulus Bishop of
Basy^e / which went with them to rome / And returned fro thens with them and
received martyrdom / Saint Gerasyne queen of Scycyle which had made of her
husbond that was a cruel tyrant a meke lamb / And was suster of Moryce the
Bishop / and of Darye mother of saint Vrsula / To whom the fader of saint
vrsula had sygnefyed by secret lettres / She by thynspyracion of god put her
self in the weye with her four daughters Babylla / Iuliana / Victorea and
aurea / and her little sone Adryan / which for love of his susters went in the
same pylgremage / And left all in the hand of his own sone / and came in to
Brytayne / And saylled over see in to England / And by the counceyl of this
queen / the virgyns were gadred to gydre fro diverse Royammes / And she was
ledar of them / And at the last she suffryd martyrdom with them / And then
the condycion made / all things were made ready / Then the queen showed her
counceylle to the knights of her company / And made them all to swear this
new chyualrye / And then began they to make diverse plays and games of
bataylle / as to run here and there / and feigned many manner of plays / And
for all that / they left not their purpoos / And sometime they returned fro
this play at mydday / and sometime uneath at even song time / And the barons
and great lords assembled them to see the fair games and disportes / And all
had joy and playsyre in beholding them and also meruaylle / And at the lasie
when Vrsula had conuertid all these Virgyns unto the faith of Christ / they
went all to the sea / And in the space of a daye^ they sailled over the sea /
having so good wind that they arrived at a port of gaul named Tyelle / and
fro thens came to Coboyn / where an Angel of our lord appyeryd to vrsula / and
told her that they should return again the hole nombre to that place / and
there receive the crown of martirdom / and fro thens by the monycyon of the
angel they went toward Rome / And when they came to Basyle they left there
their ships / and went to Rome a foot / At the coming of whom the pope
Ciriacus was much glad / by cause he was borne in Brytayne / And had many
Cosyns among them / And he with his clerkis received them with all honor /
And that same night it was showed to the pope that he should receive with them
the Crown of martyrdom / which thing he hid in him self and baptifid many
of them that were not then baptized / And when he saw time couenable when he
had governed the chirch one year / and enleuen wekes / and was the xix (...)
after Peter / he purposed to fore all the people / and showed to them his
purpoos / and resigned his office and his dygnyte / but all men gaynsayd it /
and specially the cardynallys / which supposed that he trespaced leuynge the
glory of the papacye / And would goo after this folysshe vyrgyns / but he would
not agree tabyde / but ordained an holy man to occupye in his place / which
was named Ametus And by cause he left the syege apostolyque against the will of
the clergy / the clerks put out his name of the Cathologue of popes / and
all the grace that he had gotten in his time / This holy company of wymmen
made him for to leave hit / And then two felon princes of the Chyualrye of
Rome Maxymyen / and Affrycan saw these great company of vyrgyns / and that
many men and wymmen assemblyd to them / doubted that Christian relygyon should
much be encreaced by them / wherefore they required dylygently of their vyage /
And then sent they messagers to Iulyan their Cosyn prince of the lygnage of
the Hunes / that he should bring his host against them / And should assemble at
Coleyne / And there byhede them / by cause they were Christian / And the blessed
Cyryake issued out of the Cite of rome with this blessed company of vyrgyns /
And Vyncent priest Cardynal and Jacques that was come fro Brytayne in to
Antyoche / and had hold there seven year the dignyte of the Bishop / which
then had vysyted the pope / and was gone out of his Cite And held company
with these virgyns when he herd of their coming / and suffrid martyrdom with
them / And mauryce Bishop of Leuytane the Cite / uncle of babylle and Iulyan /
And Folarius Bishop of lucence with supplyce bishop of Rauenne / which
then were come to Rome / put them in the company of these virgyns / Ethereus
the husbond of Vrsula abydyng in britayne was warned of our lord by a vysyon of
an Angel / that he should exhort his mother to be Christian / For his fader deyde
the first year that he was Crystned / And Ethereus his seen succeeded after him
in his regne / And then when these holy vyrgyns returned fro Rome with the
bisshops / Ethereus was warned of our lord / that he should anon arise and goo
to mete his wife at Coleyne / and there receive with her the Crown of
martyrdom / the which anon obeyed to admonestements dyuyne / And did do
baptyse his mother / and came with her / and his little suster Florence then
also baptized / and with the bishop Clement / metynge the holy virgyns / and
accompanied them unto martyrdom / and Marculus bishop of greece / and his nece
Constaunce daughter of Dorothe king of Constantynople / which was married to
the sone of a king / but he deyde to fore the weddyng / And she auowed to our
lord her vyrgynyte / they were also warned by a vysyon / and came to Rome / and
joined them to these vyrgyns unto the martyrdom / And then all these
vyrgyns came with the bisshops to Coleyne / And fond that it was besyeged with
the Hunes / And when the Hunes saw them / they began to run upon them with
a great cry and araged like wolves on sheep / and slew all this great
multitude / And when they were al byheded / they came to the blessed Vrsule /
and the prince of them seeing her beauty so merueylous was abashed / and began
to comfort her upon the death of the vyrgyns / and promised to her to take her
to his wife / And when she had refused him / and despised him at all he shote
at her an arow / and perced her thorugh the body / And so accomplysshed her
martyrdom / And one of the vyrgyns / which was named Cordula was sore aferd /
and hid her self all that night in a ship / but on the morn she suffrid death
by her free will / and took the crown of martyrdom / And by cause her feast
was not hold with the other vyrgynes / she appierid long after to a recluse /
and commanded him that the next day following the feste of the virgyns / her
feast should should be remembryd / They suffrid death the year of our lord
CCxxxviij / But sum hold oppynyon / that the the reason of the time shows
/ that they suffered not death in that time / For Cecylle ne Constantynople were
then no Royammes / but it is supposed / that they suffryd death long time
after when Constaunt was Emperor / And that the hunes and goths enforced
them ageynste Christian men in the time of the emperor Marcyen / that reigned in
the year of our lord four Clix / Hit is to be remembryd that among these
enleuen thousand vyrgyns were many men / For the pope Cyryaque and other
bisshops / and Ethereus king with other lords and knights had much people
to serve them / And as I have been informed in Coleyn / that there were men
beside wymmen / that thylke time suffryd martyrdom fyften thousand / So the
no^bre of this holy multitude as of the holy virgins and men were xxvjM / to
whom late us pray to our lord that he have mercy on us / There was an Abbot
that Impetred of thabbesse of the place where these holy vyrgyns rest in
Coleyn / a body of one of these virgyns / and promised that he would set it in
his church in a fair shryne of silver / But when he had kept it a year
upon the altar in a cheste of tree / And in a night as thabbot song matyns /
the said vyrgyne descended fro the altar bodyly / And enclyned honorably to
fore the altar / And went thorugh the choer / seeing all the monks which
were thereof sore abashed / And then thabbot ran / and fond it al void
and nothing therein / then thabbotte went to Coleyne / and told to thabbesse
all the thing by order / Then went they to the place where they had taken
the body / And fond the same there again / And then thabbot required pardon
/ And prayed thabbesse / that he might have again the same body / or another /
promysyng right certainly to make hastily a precious shryne / But he couthe
none have in no manner / There was a relygyous Monk which had great devotion
to these holy virgins / and it happed / that he was on a day seek / and saw a
right fair and noble vyrgyne appiere to him / and demanded him if he knew
her / And he was amerueyled of this vysyon / and said he knew her not / And
she said I am one of the virgyns / to whom thou have such great devotion /
And thereof thou shall have a reward / if thou say enleuen thousand pater
nosters for the love and honor of us / we shall come unto thine aid and
comfort at the hour of thy death / And then she vanysshed awey / and he
accomplysshed her request as soon as he might / And anon after he did do
call his Abbot / and did him to be eneled or enoynted / And as they enoynted
him / he cried suddenly / make ye place to the holy vyrgyns / and go out of the
way / that they may come to me And when thabbot demanded him / what it was /
and what he mente / He told to him by order the promise of the vyrgyne /
Then all they withdrewe them a little after. And sone came again / And fond
him departed out of this world unto our lord / Then late us deuoutely give
lawde and praysynge unto the blessed Trynyte / And pray him that by the
merytes of this great multitude of martirs he wolle foryeue and pardone us of
our sins / that after this life we may come unto this holy company in heaven
/ Amen /

Thus ends the passion of saint Ursula with enleuen thousand Uyrgyns and
fyften thousand men al martirs
Here follows of the saints Cryspyn and Cryspynyan
IN the time when the furyous persecucion of Christian men was under Dyoclesyan
and maxymyan to gydre regnynge / Cryspyn and Cryspynyan born at Rome of noble
lygnage / came with the blessed saints Quyntyn / Fustyan and Victoryn unto
Paris in france / and they there chese diverse places for to preche the faith
of criste / Cryspyn and Cryspynyan came to the Cite of suession / and chosen
that Cite for the place of their pylgremage / where they followed the stappes of
saint powle thappostle / that is to say / to labor with their hands for to
provide to them necessaryly to live / and excercysed the craft of making of
shoes / In which craft they passed other and took by constraynt no reward of
no body / wherefore the gentyles and paynyms / overcome by the love of them / not
only for need of the craft / but also for the love of god came often to them /
And left the error of thydolles / and byleuyd in very god / At the last these
holy men being sought of Ryctyonarye were founden amendynge and cloutynge
pour men's shoes / which were taken and bounden with chains / and brought
unto him / And after many Interrogacions and questions / they refusing to
sacrefyse to thydolles were stratched and bounden unto a tree were commanded
to be beten with staves And after alles such as shoes ben sewed with were
thresten and put under the vngles or nails of their fyngres / and layners or
lachettes of their skin were cut out of their back / who among these
sharp and strong pains prayeng / the alles sprang from their vngles and nails
/ and smote the mynystres that payned them / and wounded them cruelly / Then
Ryctionarye commanded to hang on their necks mylne stones / and in the
winter time under the yse in the River of anxion to be drowned / but the water
might not drown them / ne the stones make them to synke / ne the cold
constrayne ne hurt them / but as they had bayned and wasshen them in somer
time / they throwynge awey the byrthen of stones arrived and came to that other
brynke of the River / which thing Ryctyonarye beholdynge / and seeing this
miracle / by thynstigacion of the deuylle / was al araged / and commanded to
melte led in the fire / and the holy martirs to be casten in to hit / therein
to be drowned and consumed / But these holy men prayeng / and saying / Blessed
art thou lord god / of our faders / et cetera / A drope of the fervent oylle
sprange in to the eye of Ryctyonarye / and blinded it cruelly paynynge him by
grievous tormente / But he yet for all that being wood for anger / commanded
/ to boylle pytche oylle / and greece / and to throw the holly men therein for
to be drowned and consumed / But the saints Inmeuable of their hope / and
besyly in their prayers sayden / O lord thou art strong / and mighty enough
to delyuere us fro these torments to us showed and done to the confusion of
the deuylle / and of all his servants / And as soon as their prayer was
fynysshed / an Angel ladde them out without hurt or sca^he / which thing
when Ryctyonarye saw / he sprange and fylle down him self in the fire / and
there perysshed by the ryghtwys Judgment of god / which had put to death by
fire many martirs of Christ / and descended down to euerlastyynge fire / These
holy men seeing this / the next night following / they prayed our lord that he
would command them so delyuerd fro the torments to come unto him / To whom
it was showed that same nyt that the next day following they should receive the
mede of their reward / and And so it was done / For Maxymyan heryng the death of
Ryctyonary / commanded that their hedes should be smeton of / And thus they
suffrid and received the Crown of martyrdom the tenth kalendes of Nouembre /
And their bodies were left to be devoured of beestes and fowls / but god
suffryd them to be kept vndefowled and not to be touched of any be / After
this the aungel of our lord appyeryd to a certain old man commaundyng him to
take up the bodies and burye them in his how / which old man took a cosyn of
his an old woman / which ^u^llyd with him in his celle / / and went to the
place / where they had been biheded And by cause it was nyghe to the River /
they might lyghtely be brought to the Celle by water / but they had no ship
ne bote ready / ne they couth not the craft of rowyng / ne had the strength to
bring them ageynste the streme of the River / And when they came to the place
they fond the bodies of the saints / and a boat ready in the river ordained by
our lord / Then they having hope and trust in our lord each of them took
up a body of the martirs / And went freely without burden in such wise that
it seemed to them that they bare no berthen / but that they were borne of the
berthens / And they entryng with the holy bodies in to the litil boot without
ores / and gouernayl / that might be seen against the strong streme of the
flood were brought unto the ryuage of his celle / and there buried them in his
oratorye / And where the persecucion of them ceessed / the honor of them was
showed to the people by miracles / In such wise / that a great church was
afterward maade in thonoure of the holy saints of true Christian people / then
late us pray to them that they pray for us / etcetera

Thus ends the martyrdom of the holy saints Crispyn and Crispynyan
Here follows of the holy Appostles Simon and Jude And first of their names
Simon is as much to say / as obedyent / or being in heaviness / And he had
a double name / He was said Simon Zelotes / And Simon Cananean / of cana a
street that is in galilee there where as our lord conuertid the water in to win / And Zelotes is as much to say as canamen / This holy man had in him
obedyence of the commandments by execucion / heaviness by pity of tormente /
And had love of Sowles by ferme ardour of love / Judas is as much to say as
confessyng or glorious / or Judas is as much to seye / as gyuynge joy / For
he had Confession of faith / glory of Regne / and glory of the everlasting
joy / This Judas was called by many names / He was said Judas / James / For he
was brother to James the less / And he was called Thadee / which is as much
to say as taking a prince / or Thadee is said of Tharea / that is a vesture /
and of deus that is god / For he was vesture ryal of god by ornament of virtues
/ by which he took crist the prince / He is said also in thystory Ecclesiaste
Lebeus / which is as much to say as heart / or worshipper of heart Or he is
said Lebeus of Lebes / that is a vessel of heart by great hardynesse / or a
worshipper of heart by purete / a vessel by plenytude of grace / For he
deseruyd to be a vessel of virtues / and a cawd^on of grace / And Abdyas
Bishop of Babyloyne by the Appostles ordained wrote their passion and Legende
in greek / And the disciple of Abdyas translated it out of greek in to latin
And was named Affrycan /

Of the holy saints Simon and Jude
Simon Cananyen and Judas thaddee were brethren of James the less and sons
of Marye Cleophe / which was married to Alpheus / And Jude was sent of Thomas
to the king Abagar of Edysse after thascencion of our lord / And it is read
in the Hystorye Scolastyque / that the said Abagar sent a pystle unto our
lord Ihesu Christ in this manner / Abagar the sone of Euchanye / To Ihesu blessed
saueour / which appiereth in the places of Iherusalem sends salutacion / I
have herd of the / and of the helthes / and recouerynges / that thou make and
do / ben without medycynes and her bys / And that thou make the blind to
see by thyn only word and the lame go / the mesels to be cured and made hole /
and the deed bodies to live again / which things herd of the / I wene in my
courage / that thou art one of two / that is that thou art god / that art
descended from heaven for to do this / or that thou art the sone of god / that
do such things / wherefore I pray the by writing / that thou wylt travail
so much / as to come to me / and hele me of my maladye / Of which I have be
long vexed / And I have herd say that the Jews murmr against the / and lie
in a wait against the / Come therefore to me / For I have a little Cite / but it
is honest And shall well suffyse to us both / Our lord Ihesus answered ^yn /
by writing in these words / Blessed art thou that have byleuyd in me / when
thou have not seen me / It is wreton of me / that they / that see me not shalt
believe in me / And they that see me shall not believe / Of that thou have wreton
to me / that I shall come to the / me behooves taccomplysshe that / which I
am sent fore / And after to be received of him from whom I am sent / when I
am ascended I shall send to the one of my disciples to hele the / and quykene
the / This is wreton in Historia Ecclesiastica / And when Abagar saw that he
might not see god presently after that it is said in an Ancient Historye as
Johan damascene witnesses in his fourth book / He sent a payntour unto Ihesu
Christ / for to figure thymage of our lord / to the end / that at least that he
might see him by his image / whom he might not see in his vysage / And when
the payntoure came by cause of the great splendor and light that shone in the
vysage of our lord Ihesu Christ / he could not behold it / ne couthe not
counterfete it by no figure / And when our lord saw this thing / he took fro
the payntour a lynnen clothe / and set it upon his vysage / and enprynted the
very physonomye of his vysage therein / And sent it unto the king Abagar /
which so much desired it / And in the same History is contained how this
image was fygured / It was well eyed / well browed a long vysage or chyere /
and enclyned which is a sign of maturyte / or ripe sadness / That Epistle of
our lord Ihesu Christ / is of such virtue / that in the Cite of Edysse no
Heretyk ne no paynym may live therynne / ne none Tyrant may grieve hit / For
if any people come ageynste that Cite by force of Arms / A Child shall stand
upon the gate / And shall read that Epistle / And that same day either
thenemyes shall flee / and ben aferd / or they shall make pees with them of
the Town / And as is said this has been done /

But this Cite has been sith taken of the Sarasyns / and touched / In such
wise that for the multyplyeng of sins this benefayt is lost Also it is read
in thystorye ecclesiastyke / that when our lord was ascended in to heaven /
thomas thappostle sent thaddee / that was Jude unto the king Abagar /
according to the promise of our lord / And when he was comen to him / And had
told to him / that he was messager of our lord Ihesu Christ / which had
promised to send him one / And Abagar saw in the vysage of thadee a
merueylous / and godly bryghtnes / And when he had seen it / he was all
abashed / and aferd and worshipped our lord saying / Verily thou art the
disciple of Ihesu Christ sone of god / which sent to me word / that he would
send to me sum one of his disciples / that should hele me and give to me life
/ To whom Thaddee said / if thou byleuest in the sone of god / thou shall have
all the desires of thyn heart / And Abagar said / I believe on him verily /
And tho Jews that slew him / I should gladly slay them / if hit were possible
to me / and had power / how be it / that thauctoryte lets hit / And as it is
read in some places and books / that Abagar was lepre / And thaddee took the
epistle of our savior / and rubbed and froted there with the visage of Abagar
/ And anon he received full health / Judas preached first in Mesopptamye and in
ponto / And Simon preached in Egypt / And fro thens came they in to Perse / And
fond there two Enchaunteurs / Zaroes / and Arphaxat / whom saint Mathewe had
driven out of Ethyope / And fond also there waradach a duke of the kings of
Babyloyne / which should go in bataill against them of ynde / And could have
none answer of his gods / And then they went to a Temple nyghe to the Cite
/ And there they had answer / that by cause that thappostles that were comen /
they might not answer / Then the duk did inquire for them / and fond them
And demanded them / wherefore they were comen / And what they were / which
answered if thou demand of our lygnage / we ben Hebrews / and if thou
demand of our condycyon / we ben servants of Ihesu Crist / and if thou
demand wherefore we ben comen / we ben for your health / To whom the duk
answered / when I shall return Ioyously fro the betayll / I shall here you / To
whom thappostles said / It is more couenable to the to know him now / by
whom thou may overcome and appese them that been rebel to the / And the duk
answered / I see you more mighty than our gods / I pray you to say to us to
fore the end of the bataylle / And thappostles sayden / by cause that thou
know thy gods / to be liars / we command them / that they give answer to
that thou demaundest / by cause that when they have / we shall preue yt they
have lied / then thydolles said / that the battle should be great / And
that much people should be overthrown on both sides / And then the
Appos^les began to lawhe / And the duk said to them / I am aferd / and ye
lawhe / And thappostles sayden / doubt ye no thing / For pees shall be made
among you and to morn at the hour of tierce / the messagyers of the medes
shall come and shall submytte them to thy puyssance with pees And then the
Bisshops of thydollys maade a great laughter / and said to the duk / These men
here would assure the here / to the end / that thou sholdest by leave folysshly /
And that thou sholdest be bitaken of thyn adversaries / And thappostles said /
we say not Abide a moves / but one day only / And thou shall be vaynquysshour
al in pees / Then the duk maade to be kept that one and that other / that
they that said the truth should be honored / and the liars punysshed /
Then on the morn like as thappostles had said / it happed / And then the
duke would have burnt the Bisshops of thydolles but the Appostles lettyd him /
that he should not slay them / For they were not come for to slay / but for to
quyken the deed / And then the duk much merueylled / that they would not that
they should be slain / ne receive none of their goods / And brought them to the
king and said / These ben gods hyd in form of men / And when he had told
all to him in the presence of his enchaunteurs / Thenchaunteurs being moeued
of envy said / that they were malycious / and wicked men / and purposed sum
malice against the royamme subtylly / Then the duke said to them / Now if ye
dare / assaye ye and dispute with them / And thenchaunteurs said / if thou
wylt / thou shall see that they shall not mow speak / we being present /
Make men to come hyder / that been eloquent / and can well speak / And if they
dare speak to fore us / despise ye us / And say / we ben fools / And then
were brought to fore them many advocates / And anon they were made do^be to
fore the enchaunteurs so that by signs they might not show / that they
might not speak / Then said thenchaunteurs to the king / to the end / that
thou know / that we be gods / we shall suffer them to speak / but they
shall not mow go / And then we shall give to them their going / And shall
take awey their sight / And yet shall their eyes be open / And when they had
done al these things / the duke brought the Advocates al confused unto
thappostles / And when thaduocates saw thappostles so evil clothed they had
of them great despyte in their courage^ To whowhome Simon said / Oftymes it
happeth / that among Coffrys of gold wrought with precious stones / ben ryt
vile things enclosed / And within Coffres of tree ben leyd gold rings and
precious stones / Promise ye that ye will forsake the ydolles and will
worshype one only god Inuysyble / and we shall make the sign of the Cross in
your forhedes / And ye shall then mow confound these enchaunteurs / And
when these Advocates had renounced thydolles / and were marked in the
forhedes with the sign of the Cross / they entryd again to the king / to
fore the enchaunteurs / Then might they not be ouercomen of the enchaunteurs
/ but confounded them openly before the king and all the people /
Thenchau^teurs were then angry And made to come a great multitude of
Serpents / Then thappostles came anon by the commandment of the king /
and filled their mauntelly^ with the serpents / and threw them against
thenchaunteurs saying / Moeue ye not in the name of our lord Ihesu Crist / but
be ye to torn and byten / so that ye cry and braye / in showing / what sorrow
and pain ye suffer / And then when the serpente bote and ete the flesh of
thenchaunteurs they cried and houled like wulues / And the king and the other
prayed thappostles that they would suffer them to deye with the Serpents / And
thappostles answerde / that they were sent for to bring men fro death to life
/ and not fro life to death / Then made they their prayers and commanded the
serpents / that they should take fro them again the venym that they had shed
/ And return again to the places / that they came fro / And thenchaunteurs
felt greter pain / when they drew out their venym again / than they did
the first time when they bote them / And thappostles said to them / ye shall
feel this pain three days / And at the third day ye shall be hool / so yt ye
depart fro your malice / And when they had been tormentid three days without
mete and drink / and without sl^pe / the Appospostles came to them and said /
god day ^eth not to have service by force / And therefore arise ye al hool / and
go your way / ye have power to do what ye will And they abydyng in their
malice arose up / and fled fro thappostles / and moeued al most against them
al babylone / After the daughter of a duk conceived a sone by fornycacion / And
at her delyueraunce thereof / she diffamed an holy deken / and said / that he
had defowled her / And that she had conceived of him / And when the
friends of her would have slain the deken the Appostles came / and demanded /
when the Child had been borne / And they said yesterdaye / the first hour of
the day / And the Appostles said / bring hyder the child to us / And also
the Deken / that ye accuse / And when that was done / the Appostles said to
the child / say to us in the name of our lord / if this deken has done this
deed / And the child answered / this deken is chaste / and an holy man / ne he
never defowled his flesh / And then the parents and friends required that
thappostle should demand / who had done that felonnye / They answered It
apperteyneth to us for texcuse thynnocentes / and not bytraye ne hurt them /
that been culpable / That time it happed that two cruel tygres which were
enclosed in a pytte / brake out and devoured all them that they met and
encountered / And then thappostles came to them / and made them as meke and
debonayre in the name of our lord / as they had been sheep / or lambs And
then thappostles would have departed thens / but they were holden by prayers /
so that they abode there a year and three months / and in that espace of time
the king and mo than lx thousand men were baptized without children / And the
foresaid enchaunteurs went in to a Cite called Suamar where as were lxx
bisshops of ydollys / whom they meued ageynste thappostles / so that when they
came thither / either they should do sacryfyse to thydolles or they should ^e
slain / And when thappostles had gone round about the prouynce / they came
to the said Cite / And anon all the bisshops and the people took them / and
brought them to the Temple of the son / And the deuyls began to cry in the
symylacres / what will these appostles of the living god do to us / loo how
We ben burnt by flammes in their entryng in to this Cite / And then the
Aungel of our lord appiered unto the Appostles / and said to them / chese ye
of two things that one / that is either that this people be suddenly deed or
slain or that ye be martred / To whom they said we will that thou convert
them here / and led us to the pain of martyrdom / And they then commanded
scylence / and thappostles said / by cause that ye shall know / that these
ydolles ben fulle of deuyls / we command them for to come out / and that
each of them break and destroy his false image / And anon two Ethyopyens black
and naked issued out of thydolles / all the people seeing which were abashed
/ and all to brake their ydolles / and went their wey cryeng cruelly / And
when the Bisshops saw this / they ran upon thappostles And hew them to
death anon / And that same hour which was right fair weder came so great
thonder and lyghtnynge that the Temple was smeton in three / And the two
enchaunteurs were turned in to coals by the stroke of thondre / And the king
bare the bodies of thappostles in to his cite / And did do make a church of
merueylous gretenes in thonoure of them / And hit is founden in diverse places
of saint Simon that he was nailed to the Cross which thing ysydore says /
in the book of the death of thappostles / And Eusebe in thystory ecclesiastyque
/ and Bid upon the acts of thappostles /

And master Johan Beleth in his sum wytnessith the same / And as they say /
when he had preached in egipte / he came again / and was maade bishop in
Jerusalem / after the death of James the less / and was chosen of the Court
of the Appostles / And hit is said / that he raised thyrtty deed men to life /
when he had governed the church of Jerusalem many years unto the time of
Trayan the emperor / in the time that Atticus was Consul in Iherusalem / of
whom he was taken and tormentid / and done to much wrong / And at the last he
was tormented and fixed to the Cross / And the Judge and all they that were
there / merueyled / that the man which six score year old might suffer the
torment of the Cross / And sum say verily that it was not this Simon that
suffered the martyrdom of the Cross / but it was another the sone of Cleophe
brother of Joseph / And Eusebe bishop of Cezaryense wytnessyth it in his
Cronycle / For ysydore and Eusebe corrected their Chronicles of that they said
to fore / which appyereth by Bid / that when he fete this / He revoked hit
in his retractions /

And the same wytnessyth vsuart in his Martylogye /

Then late us deuoutely pray these Appostles to be our specialle Advocates
unto our blessed lord Ihesu Christ their master / to have pity and mercy on us
/ AMEN /

Thus enden the lives of saint Simon and Jude Appostles

weary / And after was put in prison / but he was unbound of an Angel / And he
went in to the cite / and there preached to the people / Then he was taken
again / and was strayned on the Eculee an Instrumente to tormente saints on /
unto the brekyng of his veins / and beten with raw synewes right long / And
afterward he was boylled in brennynge oylle / and pytche / And yet for all
that he mocqued the Judge / Then the Judge did do put in to his mouth quyck
lyme / vyneaygre / and mustard / And yet alleway he abode constaunt and
vnmeuable / And then he was brought in to Vermandoys / And fixed in him ij
nails fro his head unto his knees / And ten nails between his nails / and
the flessh of his nayllys and the flesh on his hands / And at the last the
provost made him to be byheded / And threw the body in to the water / which
body was hid there lv year / And then founden there by a noble woman of
Rome / For as she was contynuelly in prayer / she was in a night warned by an
Aungel / that she should go hastily unto the castelle of Vermandos / And it was
commanded to her that she should fetch the body of saint Quyntyn in such a
place / and burye it honorably / And when she came to the said place with a
great company And as she maade her prayers / the body of saint Quyntyn appiered
above the water swetely smellyng and with out corrupcion / which body she
took / and buried it worshipfully / And for the sepulture that she maade
honorably / she that to fore was blind received her sight again for a reward
/ And then there she edyffyed a fair church / and returned home unto her
own place again / In which church now is a fair monastery of Monks / and a
good town called saint quyntyns in Vermandos / where daily beshewed many great
miracles / And in specially for the ydropecye / etcetera / and swellynge of
great belyes for over great superfluyte of water / For this sickness in
especialle he is sought / And many men have been cured and maade hole by the
merytes of this blessed saint and martyr saint Quyntyn / To whom pray we that
we may be delyuerd from all Infyrmytees / as far as it shall please god /
and necessary for us / AMEN /

Thus ends the life of saint Quyntyn
Here follows the life of saint Eustace and first of his name
EUstace was named to fore his baptysme placidas / which is as much to say /
as plesaunt to god / And Eustace is said of eu / that is to say good / and
stachis / that is fortune / there for Eustace is as it were good fortune / He
was playsaunt to god in his conversation / And after he hekde him in good
works /

Of saint Eustace
EUstace / which first was named Placidas was master of the chyualrye of
Trayan the emperor / And was right besy in the works of mercy / but he was a
worshipper of ydolles And he had a wife of the same Ryte and also of the deeds
of mercy / of whom he had two sons / which he did do nourysshe after his
estate / And by cause he was ententyf to the works of mercy / he deseruyd to
be enlumyned to the way of truth / So that on a day as he was on hontynge /
he fond an herd of hertes / among whom he saw one more fair and gretter
than the other / which departid fro the company And sprange in to the
thyckest of the forest / And the other knights ronnen after the other hertes /
but placidas siewed him with all his might / and enforced to take him / And
when the heart saw that he followed him with all his power / At last he
went up on an hyhe roche / And Placidas approchynge nyghe thought in his mind
/ how he might take him / And as he be held and considered the heart dylygently
/ he saw between his horns the form of the holy Cross shynynge more clear
than the son / and thymage of Christ / which by the mouth of the heart /
like as sometime Balaam by the ass spack to him saying / Placidas / wherefore
folowest me hyder / I am appiered to the in this beeste / for the grace of the
/ I am Ihesu Christ whom thou honor ignorauntly / thy almesses ben ascended
up to fore me / And therefore I come hyder / so that by this heart that thou
huntest I may hunte the / And sum other say / that this image of Ihesu
Christ / which appiered between the horns of the heart said these words /
And when Placidas herd that / He had greet dread / And descended fro his
horse to the ground / And an hour after / he came to him self / and aroose fro
the ground / and said / Reherce again this / that thou haste said / And I
shall believe the / And then our lord said / I am Ihesu Christ / that
fourmed Heaven and Earth / which made the light tencreace / And divided it fro
derkenesse / And establysshed time / Days / and Hours / which fourmed man of
the slyme of the Earth / which appyeryd in Earth in Flesh / for the health
of the lygnage humayne / which was Crucyfyed / Deed / buried / And aroose the
thyrdde day / And when Placydas herd this / He fylle down again to the
Earth / And said / I believe Lord / that thou art he / that maade all things
/ And conuertist them that err / And our lord said to him / if thou byleuest
/ goo to the Bisshoppe of the Cite / and do the be baptized / And Placidas
said to him / Lord / wylt thou / that I hyde this thing / fro my wife and my
sons / And our Lord said to him / Tell to them / that they also make them
clean with the / And see / that thou come again to morrow hither / that I
appiere again to the / and may show to the that / which shall come herafter
to the / And when he was comen home to this hows / and had told this thing to
his wife in their bed / she escryed / My lord and said And I saw him this
night that is passyd / and said to me to morn thou / thy husbond / and thy
sons shall come to me / And now I know that it was Christ / Then they went
to the Bishop of Rome at Mydnyte which baptized them with great joy / And
named placidas Eustace / And his wife theopysse / And on the morn Eustace went
to hunte as he did before / And when he came nyghe to the place / he departed
his knights as for to find veneson / And anon he saw in the place the form
of the first vysion And anon he fylle down to the ground to fore ye figure /
and said lord / I pray the to show to me / that which thou haste promised to
me thy servant / to whom our lord said / Eustace / thou art blessed which
have taken the wasshyng of grace / for now thou have surmounted the deuylle /
which had deceived the / and trodden him under foot / Now thy faith shall
appiere^ the deuylle now by cause thou have forsake him / is armed cruelly
against the / And it behooves the to suffer many things and pains / for to
have the Crown of victory / thou must suffer much / by cause to humble the
fro the hyhe vanyte of the world / and shall afterward be enhaunced in
spyrytuelle Rychesses / thou therefore fail not / ne look not unto thy first
glory / For the behooves / that by temptacions thou be another Job / And when
thou shall so be humbled / I shall come to the / and shall restore the unto
the first joy / Say to me now whether thou wylt now suffer and take
temptacions / or in the end of thy life / And Eustace said to him / lord if it so
behooves / command that temptacion to come now / but I beseech the to grant
to me the virtue of pacyence / To whom our lord said / Be thou constaunt /
for my grace shall keep your sowles / Then our lord ascended in to heaven /
And Eustace returned home / and showed all this to his wife / After this a few
days / The pestylence assayllyd his servants and his knights / and slew
them all / And in a little while after / all his horses and his beestes deyde
suddenly / and after this sum that had been his felawes / seeing his depredacion
/ entryd in to his hows by night / and robbed him / and bare awey gold and
silver / and despoylled him of all other things And he / his wife / and
children thanked god / and fled awey by night al naked / And by cause they
doubted shame / they fled in to Egypt / And all his great possession came to
by rauayne of wicked people / Then the king and all the Senators sorowed
much for the master of the Chyualrye / which was so noble / by cause they
might here no tidings of him / And as they went they approached the sea / and
fond a ship / and entryd in to hit for to pass / And the maistre of the
ship saw the wife of Eustace was right fair / And desired much for to have her
/ And when they were passed over / he demanded his reward for their freyt And
they had not whereof to pay / so that the master of the ship commanded that
the wife should be holden and retained for his hyre / And would have her with him
/ And when Eustace herd that he gaynsayd hit long / then the master of the
ship / commanded his maronners to cast him in to the Sea / so that he might
have his wife / And when Eustace saw that / he left his wife much sorowfully
/ and took his two children / and went weeping and said / Alas / woe ain I for
you / for your mother is delyuerd to a strange husbond / And thus sorowynge he
and his children came to a river / and for the great habondaunce of water / he
durst not pass that River with his both sons attones / which were then
young / But at the last he / left one of them on the brynke of the River /
And bare over that other on his sholders / And when he had passed the River
/ He set down on the ground the child / that he had borne over And
hasted him for to fetch that other / that he had leffte on that on that
other side of the River / And when he was in the mids of the water / there came
a wulf and took the child that he had borne over / and fled with all to the
wood / And he then all despeyred of him / went for to fetch that other /
and as he went / there came a great lion / and bare awey that other child / so
that he might not reteyne him / For he was in the myddle of the River / And
then he began to weep / and draw his here / And would have drowned him self
in the water / if the dyuyne purueaunce had not let him / And the herdmen /
and plowemen saw the lion beryng the child al alive / and they followed him
with their dogs / so that by dyuyne grace the lion left the child al sauf
without hurt / And other plowemen cried and followed the wulf / and with their
staves and fauchons delyuerd the child hoole and sound fro his teeth without
hurt / And so both the herdmen and plowemen were of one vyllage / and
nourysshed these children among them And Eustace knew no thing thereof but
weeping and sorowyng saying / to him self / Alas woe is me / For to fore this
myshappe / I shone in greet welthe / like a tree / but now I am naked of all
things / Alas I was a customed to be acompanyed with a great multitude of
knights / And I am now allone / and am not suffered to have my sons / O lord I
remember me / that thou saidest to me / the behooves to be tempted / as Job was
/ but I see that in me is more done to than was to Job For he lost all his
possessions / but he had a donghylle to sytte on / but to me is no thing left
/ he had friends which had pity on him / and I have no ne / but wild beestes
/ which have borne awey my sons / To him was his wife left / and my wife is
taken fro me and delyuerd to another / O good lord give thou rest to my
trybulacions / and keep thou so my mouth / that mine heart declyne not in to
words of malice / and be cast fro thy vysage / And thus saying and wayllyng
in great weeping went in to a street of the town / and there was hired for to
keep the feldes of the men of that town / and so kept them xv year / his sons
were nourysshed in another town / and knew not that they were brethren / and
our lord kept the wife of Eustace / so that the strange man had not to do
with her / ne touched her / but deyde / and ended his life / In that time
the emperor and the people were much tormentid of their enemies / And then
they remembryd of placidas / how he many times had foughten nobly against them
/ for whom the emperor was much sorrowful / and sent out in to diverse
parties many knights to seche him / and promised to them yt fond him much
rychesses and great honor / And two knights which had been under him in
chyualrye came in to the same street / where he duellyd / And anon as placydas
saw them / he knew them / And then he remembryd his first dignyte / and
began to be heavy and said / Lord I byseche the to grant to me / that I
may sometime see my wife / for as for my sons / I know well / that they be
devoured of wild beestes / and then a voys came to him and said / Eustace /
have thou good affyaunce / For anon thou shall recover thyn honor / and
shall have thy wife and thy Children / and anon he met with these knights /
and they knew him not / but demanded of him / if he knew any strange man
named placidas / And had a wife and two children / and he said nay / yet he had
them home to his hostel / and he served them And when he remembryd of his first
estate / he might not hold him fro weeping / Then he went out / and wesshe
his face / and returned for to serve them / And they considered / and said that
one to that other / how that this man resembles much unto him / that we seche
/ And that other answered / certainly he is like unto him / Now late us see / if
he have a wound in his head that he gate in a bataylle / Then they beheld
and saw the sign of the wound / And then they wist well it was he that
they sought / Then they arose and kyssed him / and demanded of his wife and
children / And he said / that his sons were deed / and his wife was taken awey
fro him / And then the neighbors ran for to here this thing / by cause
the knights told / and recounted his first glory and his virtue / And they
said to him the commandment of the emperor / And clad him with noble vestymentes
/ Then after the iourneye of fyften days they brought him to the emperor /
And when he herd of his coming / he ran anon against him / And when he saw
him / he kyssed him / Then Eustace recou^ted to fore them all by order that
which had happened to him / And he was restablysshed unto thoffyce to be ageyn
master of the chyualrye / And was constrained to do thoffyce as he did to
fore / And then he compted / how many knights there were / and saw / that
there were but few / as to the regard of their enemies / And commanded that
all the young men should be gadred in the cytees and towns / and it happed
that the country where his sons were nonrysshed should make and send two men
of arms / Then all the Inhabitants of that Country ordained these two young
men his sons most couenable above al other for to go with the master of the
chyualrye / And then when the master saw these young men of noble form /
and aourned honestly with good manners / they plesyd him much / And ordained
that they should be with the first of his table / Then he went thus to the
bataylle / And when he had subdued his enemies to him / he made his host to
rest three days in a Town / where his wife dwelled / and kept a pour
hostelery And these two young men by the purueaunce of god were lodged in
thabytacion of their mother / without knowing what she was / And on a time
about mydday / as they spack that one to that other of their enfancye / And
their mother which was there herkened what they said much ententifly / so that
the grettest said to the less / when I was a child / I remember none other
thing / sauf that my Fader / which was master of the knights / and my mother
which was right fair had two sons / that is to say me / and another younger
than I / and was mothe fair / And they took us / and went out of her hows by
night / and entryd in to a ship for to go I wot not whyder / And when we went
out of the ship / our mother was left in the ship / I wot not in what
manner / but my fader bare me and my brother and sore weeping / And when he
came to a water / he passyd over with my younger brother / and left me on the
bank of the water / And when he returned / a wulf came / and bare aweye my
brother / And er my fader might come to me / a great lion issued out of the
forest / and took me up / and bare we to the wood / but the herd men that saw
him took me fro the mouth of the lion / and was nourysshed in such a Town as
ye know well / ne I couthe never know what happened to my brother ner where he
is / And when the younger herd this / he began to weep and say / Forsothe
like as I here / I am thy brother / For they that nourisshed me / said / that
they had taken me fro a wulf / And then they began to embrace and kiss
each other and weep / And when their mother had herd all this thing / she
considered long in her self / if they were her two sons by cause they had
said by order what was befalle them / And the next day following she went to
the master of the chyualrye / And required him saying / Sire I pray the that
thou command that I may be brought ageyn to my Country / for I am of the
country of the Romans / And here I am a stranger / And in saying these
Words / she saw in him signs / and knew by them that he was her husbond /
And then she might no longer forbere / but fylle down at his feet and seid
to him / Sire I pray the to tell of thy first estate / For I wene that thou
art placidas maistre of the knights / which otherwise art called Eustace /
whom the saueour of the world has conuertid / And have suffrid such
temptacion and such / And I that am thy wife was taken fro the in the sea /
which nevertheless have be kept fro all corrupcion / and had of me two
sons / Agapyte and theospyte And Eustace herynge this and dylygently
consid^red and beheld her / anon knew that she was his wife / and wept for
joy / and kyssed her / and glorified much our lord god which comforted the
discomforted / And then said his wife / Sire / where ben our sons / and he
said / that they were slain of wild beestes / and recounted to her how he had
lost them / And she said / late us give thankynges to god / For I suppose /
that like as god has given to us grace each to find other / so shall he give
us grace to recover our sons / And he said / I have told the / that they be
devoured of wild beestes And she then said I sat yesterday in a gardyne /
and herd two yonglynges thus and thus expownynge their Infancye / And I believe
/ that they be our sons Demand them / and they shall tell to the the
truth Then Eustace called them / and herd their enfancye / and knew that
they were his sons / Then he embraced them / and the mother also / and kyssed
them also / Then all the host enjoyed strongly of the finding of his wife
and children / and for the vyctorye of the barbaryns / And when he was
returned Tcaian was then deed / And Adrian succeeded in thempyre / which was
werst in all felonnyes / And as well for the vyctory as for the fyndyng of his
wife and Children / he received them much honorably / and did do make a great
dinner and feast / And on the next day after / he went to the Temple of
thydolles for to sacrefyse for the vyctorye of the B^rbaryns / And then
themperour^ seeing that Eustace would not do sacr^fyse / neither for the victory
/ ne for that he had founden his wife and children / warned and commanded him /
that he should do sacryfyce / To whom Eustace said / I adoure and do
sacryfyse to our lord Ihesu Christ / and only serve him / And then the emperor
replenysshed with ire put him / his wife / and his sons in a certain place /
And did to go to them a right cruel lion / and the lion ran to them / and
enclyned his head to them / like as he had worshipped them and departed /
Then the Emperor did do make a fire under an ox of brass or copper / And
when it was fire hot / he commanded / that they should be put therein al quyck
and a live / And then the saints prayde and commanded them unto our lord
And entered in to the ox / And there yielded up their spyrytes unto Ihesu Christ
/ And the third day after they were drawn out to fore thempereur / and were
founden al hoole and not touched of the fire / ne as much as an here of them
was burnt ne none other thing on them / And then the Christian men took the
bodies of them / and leyd them in a right noble place honorably / and made
over them an oratory / And they suffered death under Adryan themperoure which
began about the year Cxx / in the kalendes of Nouembre /

Thus ends the life of saint Eustace
Here follows the solempnyte of al halowes
THe feeste of all the Saints was establysshed for four causes / First for
the dedycacion of the Temple / secondly for supplement of offenses done /
Thirdly / for to take awey neclygence / And Fourthly for to get more lightly /
that thing / which we pray fore / This feast was establisshed pryncipally
for the dedycacion of the Temple / For the Romans saw / that they seygnouryed
over all the world / And therefore they made a right great Temple / And set
their ydolle in the myddle / And al about this ydolle they set the false
images of all the prouynces / so that al tho images beheld right thydolle of
Rome / And it was ordained by art of the deuylle that when a prouynce would
rebelle / against the Romans / Thymage of that prouynce should torn his back
to thydolle of Rome / like as in showing that hit departed fro the seygnourye
of Rome / And then anon the Romans would bring great puyssaunce in to that
prouynce / And there subdued it to their seygnourye / And yet it suffysed not
to the Romans / that they had in their seignorye all the false images of
the prouynces / but maade to each of tho false gods a Temple / like as tho
gods had maade them lords / and vaynqueurs of all the prouynces / And by
cause that all the ydolles might not be in that Temple / They made a gretter
Temple more merueylous and hyhe than all the other / And for to show the more
their wodenesse / They dedyed this Temple in thonour of all their gods / And
more for to deceive the people / the Bisshops of thydolles feigned that it had been commanded to them of Cybele a goddess that is called mother of the gods
/ And they called this Temple Pantheon / which is as much to say as all
gods / of pan that is all / and theos that is god / And by cause they would
have victory of all the people / therefore they made a great Temple to all the
sons of Cybele / And the fou^dament of this Temple was cast round by a spear /
that by that form / the perdurablete of their Gods should be showed / And
for as much as the great quantite of the earth / which was within seemed not
susteynable to be voyded / and that the work was a little seen above the earth
/ they filled the creuyses within the earth / and meddled penyes with therthe /
And did alwey so / tylle the said Temple was fully accomplysshed / And then
they gaf license / that who someuer would take awey the earth / that all the
money that he fond with therthe should be his / Then came hastily great
company of people / and voyded anon the Temple / And at the last the Romans
maade a pyne of copper and gylt / and set it in a right hyhe place / And it is
said all the prouynces were entaylled and graven merueylously within that pyne
/ So that all they that come to Rome might see in that pyne / in what part
his prouynce was / And this pyne after long time fylle / and remained in the
ouerest part of the Temple And in the time of Focas the emperor / what time
Rome had received the faith / Boneface the fourth (...) fro saint gregory
about the year of our lord six honderd and five / gate of Focas the said Temple
/ And did do take awey and enface all the ordure of all tho ydolles / And
the fourth kalendes of May he hallowed it in thonour of our lady saint Marye /
and of all the martirs / And called it saint Marye at martres / which now is
called sancta Maria rotunda / that is saint Marye the round / For then was
made no solempnite of the Confessors And by cause there assembled great
multitude of people at his feast / And there might not be found haboundaunce of
vitaylle for the people that came / (...) Gregory establysshed this feste to be
in the kalendes of Nouembre / For then ought to be gretter habondaunce of
vytaylle when the corn is had in / and wine made / And establisshed this
day to be hallowed thorugh the world in the honor of all saints / And thus
the Temple that had be made for all thydolles is now dedycate / and hallowed to
all the saints / And where as the worshippynge of ydolles was used / there is
now the praysyng of all saints / Scondely it is ordained for the supplement of
things offendyd and trespaced / that is to say for to accomplysshe such as
we have ouerpassed / For we have left / and ouerpassed many saints / of whom
we have made no feste / ne may not halowe the fest of every saint by him self.
as well for the great multitude / which ben Infynyte / as for our Infyrmyte /
For we ben feeble and weyke / and may not suffyse for the shortness of time /
For the time may not suffyse thereto / And as saint Jerome says in a pystle
which is in the beginning of his calendar / there is no day / except the first
day of Ianyuer / but that there may be foundeh every day mo than five thousand
martirs / And therefore by cause we may not syngulerly make feast of every saint
/ saint Gregory the (...) has ordained and establysshed that we shall on one
day honor them generally and to gydre / And Master Wylliam of Ancerre
puts six resons in the sum of the office / wherefore hit was establysshed
/ that we should here in this world make solempnyte of the saints The first is
for the honor of the dyuyne mageste / For when we do worship to the saint
or saints / we worshipe god in his saints / and say that he is merueylous in
them / For who that does honor to saints / he honors him specially /
which has sanctyfyed them / The second is to have aid in our Infyrmyte / For
by our self we may have none health / therefore have we need of the prayers of
saints / And therefore we ought to honor them / that we may deserve that they
aid and help us / It is read in the thyrdde book of kings of the first
chapter / that bersabee is as much to say as the pytte of fyllynge / which
is to say / the Church tryumphaunt / saying to her sone / that is to say /
that to the Church tryumphaunt he had obtained the regne by his prayers / The
thyrdde cause is for thaugmentacion of our surete / that is to say for the
glory that is purposed in us in their solempnyte / our hope and surete ben
augmented and encreaced / And if mortal men and deed might thus be enhaunced by
their merytes / it is truth that the might and puyssaunce shall no thing
there by be mynuysshed / ne lassed / The fourth for thensample of us following
/ For when the feste is remembryd / we ben called tensiewe and follow them /
so / that by thensample of them we despise all erthely things / And desire
celestyall things / The fyfthe is for the debt of entrechaungynge
neyghbourhede / For the saints make of us feste in heuene / For thaungels of
god and the holy sowles have joy and make feste in heuene of a synnar that
does penance / And therefore it is right when they make of us feste in heaven
/ that we make feste of them in earth / The sixthe is for the procuracion of
our honor / For when we honor the saints / We procure our honor / For
their solempnyte is our dignyte / For when we worshipe our brethren / we
worship our self / For charity makes al to be common / And our things ben
celestyall / erthely and perdurable / And above these reasons Johan damascene
puts three reasons in his fourth book the seventh Chapter / why / and
wherefore the saints and their Relyques ought to be honored / of which some
ben preysed for their dygnytees / and sum for the preciousytees of their
bodies / And the dygnyte of them is in four manners / For they ben friends of
god / Sons of god / heirs of god / and our dukes and ledars / And saint
Johan puts these auctorytees Iohannis decimo tercio / For the first / Iam
non dico vos seruos / et cetera / I say you not now servants / but friends /
For the second Iohannis Primo / Dedit eis potestatem filios dei fieri / he gaf
to them power to be maade the sons of God / Of the thyrdde ad Romanos oct^uo /
if ye be sons / ye be heirs / et cetera / Of the fourth he says thus / How
much sholdest thou labor to find a leder to bring the to the king / and
speak for the / that is to wete / that they ben leders of grace and of all
humayne lygnage / and speak and pray for us to god / wherefore they ought to be
worshipped / Other ben taken as touching the preciosite of their bodies / And
the said Johan Damascene puts four resons / And saint Augutyn puts
thereto the fyfthe / by which is showed the preciousite of the bodies or of the
Relyques / For the holy bodies were the selyers of god / temple of Ihesu Crist
/ they were the Alabastre / or box of the precious oynement / and the fontain
of the dyuyne life / members of the holy ghost / First they were the celers of
god / For the Saints ben celers of god and pure aournementes / Secondly they
were the temple of Ihesu Crist / For hit follows by cause that god duellyd in
them by entendement / whereof thappostse says / Ne know ye not that your
bodies ben the temple of tholy ghost / duellyng in you Hereof says Crisostom /
Man delyteth him in edificacion of walls / and god delyteth him in the
conversation of saints / Whereof Dauyd says / Sire I have louyd the beauty of
thy hows / but that beauty is not made by dyuersyte of marble / but hit is
given to living men by dyuersyte of graces / the beau^te of marble the Flesh
delyteth / The beauty of grace quykenyth the soul / the first deceyueth the
eyes / and that other edyffyeth by double endendemente Thyrdly / they ben the
Alabastre or box of spyrytuel oynement / wherefore hit is said oynement of good
odor comes of himself / And this given the Relyques of saints / if the water
ran from the Roche / and out of the stone in deserte / And also water ran
out of the Iowe of the ass to Sampson / which had thurst / then it is not
incredyble / that there renneth fro the Relyques of saints / oynementes well
smellyng to them that know the yefte of god / and thonour of saints which
comes from him / Fourthly / they ben Fontaynes of dyuynyte / Of whom is said
/ they that live in veryte with free pacyence / ben assistaunt to god / and ben
to us wells of health / Our lord Ihesu Christ yeueth unto Relyques of his
saints many benefayttes in diverse manners / Fyftly they ben membrys of the
holy ghost / this reason assigns saint Augustyn in the book de Ciuitate dei /
And says / they be not to be despised / but to be honourid gretely / and to
worshipe the bodies of the saints / of whom when they lived / the holy
ghoost used as his own membre in all good work / And thappostle says / ye
seche experyence of him that speaks in me Christ / And of saint Stephen it is
said / they might not resist his wisdom / ne to the holy ghoost that spoke
in him / And Ambrose says in thexametre / It is a right precious thing / that
a man is made the membre of dyuyne voys / And with his bodyly lyppes expressyth
the words celestyall / Thyrdly / the feste of all the saints is establysshed
for the clensynge of our neclygences / For how be hit / that we halowe the
festes of a few saints / yet we keep them neclygently of times / and leave
many things undone by ygnoraunce / and by neclygence / And if we have not
solempnysed any festes / as we ought to do but neclygently / Now in this
general feste we ought to fulfylle and amend it / and purge us of our
neclygence / And this reason is touchyd in a sermon / that is recited this day
in the Church / And hit is ordained / that at this day memory is made of all
saints / that what someuer fragylyte humayne has done less than he ought /
by ygnoraunce / by neclygence / or by occupacion of seculer things in the
solempnyte of saints / that hit be appeased in thobseruacion of this holy
feast / It is to be noted / that there be four differences of the saints /
that we honor by the course of the year / which ben of the new testament /
of whom on this day we gadre to gyder for taccomplisshe that which we have
neclygently done / that been thappostles martirs / confessors and vyrgyns / And
after Rabane / these four ben sygnefyed by the four parties of the world / By
thoryent that is Eest / thappostles / by the southe the martirs / By the nor^he
the confessors / And by the west the vyrgyns / The first difference is of
thappostles / Of whom thexcellence is magnyfested / by cause they surmounte all
the other saints in four thyngis / First in soueraynte of dygnyte / For they
ben the wise princes of the church mylytaunt / they ben the puyssaunt
accessours of the Judge perdurable / they ben sweet pastors of the sheep and
flock of our lord / And they ben sweet Iuges / as Bernard says / It besemeth
well to establysshe such pastors and such doctors of thumayne lygnage /
that been sweet or soft / puyssaunt and wise / sweet or soft / that they
receive us goodly / by mercy / Mighty / For to defend us puyssauntly / wise
for to bring us to the way of truth / After they surmounte the other saints
in soueraynte of puyssaunce / whereof saint Augustyn says thus / God gaf power
to the Appostles over the deuyls for to destroy them / Above thelementes to
change them / A love nature to cure it Above the sowles for to assoille them /
of their sins / above the death for to despise / hit above thaungels for to
sacre the precious body of our lord Ihesu Christ / Thyrdly / They excede other
saints in prerogatyf of holiness / so that by their great holiness and
plenytude of graces the life and conversation of Ihesu Crist shone in them as in
a myrrour / and was known in them as the son in his splendor / as a rose in
his odor / And as fire in his hete / And hereof says Crysostome upon Mathewe
Ihesu Christ sent his Appostles / as the son his rays / as the Rose his
odor / And as the fire his sparkles / And like as the son appierith in his
rays / And as the Rose is felt by his odor / and as the fire is seen in his
sparkles / so by the virtues of them is known the puyssaunce of Ihesu Crist
Fourthly / Thappostles excede other saints in theffecte of prouffyte / Of
which vtilite saint Augustyn spekyng of thappostles seyth / Of the most vile
/ of the most ydeottis / And of the l^ste / ben ennoblisshed / enlumyned and
multeplyed / the most eloquente and fair spekars / the clerest wits and
conning / And most plentyuous wisdom of facunde and speaking of Auctours and
doctors / The second dyfference is of martirs / of whom thexcellence is
showed / by that they suffrid in many manners / prouffitably / consta^tly and
multyplyengly / For above the martyrdom of blood / shedyng / they suffrid /
three other martyrdom without effusion of blood / that is (...) in plente /
which Dauyd had / largess in pouerte / which Thobye showed / And chastyte of
wydowhed in yongth of which Joseph used in Egypt / And after gregory / also
this is treble martirdom without shedyng of blood that is pacyence in
aduersite / whereof it is said / we may he martirs without iron / if we keep
verily pacyence in our courage / Compassion of them that been in affliction and
tormentis / whereof it is said / who that has compassyon of any that is in
necessyte / he bears the Cross in his thought / And he that suffers vylonny
/ and loves his enemy is a martyr secretly in his mind / Secondly they
suffrid martyrdom prouffitably / which prouffyt on the part of the martirs
is remyssion of all sins hepyng and having plente of merytes / and
receyuynge of Joy perdurable / And these things have they bouzt with their
precious blood / And therefore it is said / their blood is precious / that is to
say / full of price / And of the first and second saint Augustyn says in the
book of the Cite of god / what thing is more precious than death by which
sins ben pardonned / and the merits encreaced / And the same upon Johan
says / the blood of Ihesu Crist is precious without sin / And yet made he
the blood of his saints precious / For whom he gaf his precious blood / For if
he had not made the blood of his saints precious / hit should not be said /
that the death of saints is precious in the syghte of our lord / And Ciprian
says / that martirdom is the end of sin / term of peril / ledar of health
/ master of pacyence / and hows of life / Of the third saint Bernard says /
Three things there be / that make the death of saints precious / rest of
trauayll / Joy of nouelte / surete of perdurabylyte / And as touching to us
the prouffyte is double / For they be given to us for an example to fight /
whereof saint Johan Crysostome says to us / thou Christian man art a knight
delycate / if thou wene to have victory without fyghtyng / and tryumphe
without battle / excercyse thy strength mytely / and fight thou cruelly in
this bataylle / Considere the covenant / understand the condition / know the
noble Chyualrye / know the covenant that thou have made and promised / the
condycion that thou have taken the Chyualrye / to whom thou have given the
name / For by that covenant all men fight / And by that condition all have
vaynquysshed and by that chyualrye / This says Crisostom / Secondly / they be
given to us patrons for to aid and help us / they aid us by their merits /
and by their orysons / Of the first says saint Augustyn / O the vnmesured pity
of our lord / which will that the merits of the martirs be our aids and
suffrages / He examyneth them for to enseigne and teache us / He breketh them
for to gadre us. and he will / that their torments ben our prouffitees / Of
the second says saint Iheromme against vygilancyen / if thappostles and martirs
/ when they were yet in their bodies alive might pray for other / and were
therein diligente / how much more then ought they to do after their crowns
/ victory and triumphs / Of whom Moses one only man gate pardon for six
Thousand men armed / And saint Stephen praid for his enemies / And since they be
now with god / Should they do less / Thirdly / the martirs have suffered
constantly / Saint Augustine says that ye soul of a martyr is ye glayue
resplendisshaunt by charity / sharp by verite brandisshed by the virtue of god
fyghtyng / yt which has surmou^ted the company of gaynsayeng them in
repreuyng them She has smeton the wicked and thrown down them that were
contrary to her / And Crisostom says / that the martirs tormentid were
strenger than the tormentours / And the torn members vaynquysshed the rentynge
yrons The thirdde difference is of the confessors / Of whom the dignyte and
excellence is manyfested by cause they confessid god in three manners / by heart
/ by mouth / and by werk / The Confession of heart suffyseth not without
confession of mouth / like as Johan Crisostom says and preueth it in four
manners And as to the first he says thus The Rote of confession is faith of
the heart And as long as the Rote is a live and quycke in the earth it is
necessary that she bring forth bows and leeuys / And if if it bring none
forth / it is to understand that it is dried in therthe And all in like wise /
when the Rote of faith is hole in the heart / she brings forth alwey
Confession in ye mouth / And if the confession of the heart appiereth not in
the mouth / understand without doubt that the faith of the heart is dried
up / As to the second he says / if it suffyseth to believe in the heart / and
not to confess it to fore men then thou art untrue and an ypocryte / For
how be hit that he byleueth not at the heart / yet hit prouffiteth him to
confess with his mouth / And if it prouffyteth not to him that confessyth
without believe / It prouffited not to him that byleueth without Confession /
And as to the thyrdde he says if it suffyse to Ihesu Christ / that thou know
him / how be hit that thou confess him not to fore men / then hit suffyseth
to the also / that thou know him / And if thou confess Ihesu crist to fore
god / And if his cognoyssaunce suffyseth not to the / no more suffyseth to the
thy faith / As to the fourth / he says / if only the faith of thy heart
should suffyse to the / god would then have created to the but only the heart
/ but god has created both the heart / and the mouth / For to believe with thy
heart / and to confess it with thy mouth / Thyrdly / they confessid god by
work / And saint Iheromme shows / how god is confessid by work / or renyed
/ and says Ihesu Christ is sapyence / Rightwysnes / truth / holiness and
strength / Sapyence is denied by folly / Ryghtwysnes by Inyquyte / truth by
lesynges / holiness by fylthe And strength by feeble courage / And as often as we
ben ouercomen by vices and by sins we renye god / Also in the contrary as
often as we done any good / we confess god / The fourth difference is of the
vyrgyns / of whom the excellence and dignyte is showed and manyfested / First
in that they ben the spouses of the eternal king / And hereof says saint
Ambrose / who may esteem more gretter beaulte / than the beauty of her that is
loved of the king / Approuued of the Judge / dedycate of god / alwey an espouse
/ and alweye without corrupcion / Secondly by cause she is compared to angels
/ vyrgynyte surmounteth all condition of nature humayne / by which men ben
associate to Angels / And the vyctory of vyrgyns is more than of Angels /
Thangels lyuen without flesh / And vyrgyns living in their flesh
tryu^phen Thyrdly for by cause they be more noble than other Christian people /
whereof Cypryan says / virgynyte is the flower of the seed of the Church /
beauty and aournement of spyrituel grace / a glad Joy of lawde and honor /
work en tiere and incorrupte / image of God / And yet more noble as to the
holiness of god / and portion of the flock of Ihesu Christ / Fourthy / by cause
they ben put to their husbondes / and this excellence that virgynyte had / as
to the respect of thaccouplement of marriage appiereth by manyfold comparacion /
For marriage fylleth and swells the belly / And virgynyte the mind / Whereof
Augustyn says / Vyrgynyte chesith to follow more ye life of angels in their
flesh / than tencreace the nombre of mortal people in their flesh / For it
is more blessid and more plentyuous tencreace their mind / than to be great
with child / For sum have Children of sorrow / And vyrgynyte brings forth
Children of Joy / virgynyte replenyssheth heaven of children And they that been
married replenysshe the earth / And Iherome says / The weddynges fylle the
earth / and vyrgynyte fylleth heaven / that one is of great besynes. And this is
of great rest / virgynyte is scylence of charge / pees of the flesh /
Redemption of vices / and pry^cesse of virtues / Marriage is good / But
virgynyte is better / Saint Iheromme says to palmacyen the difference bitwene
marriage and virgynyte and says they difference as much / as is bitwene not to
sin / and to do well / or as I may clerlyer say / as is between good and
better / For marriage is compared to thorns / And vyrgynyte to Roses / And he
says to Eustochium / I preyse marriage for they enge^dre virgyns / I gadre fro
the thorns roses gold fro therthe / and out of the shelle a precious
margaryte or stone / Fyfthly is showed the dignyte and excellence of vyrgyns /
For they enjoy many pryueleges / For the vyrgyns shall have the crown that is
called Aureola they only shall sing the new song They shall be cladde with
vestymentes of the same with Ihesu Christ and joy alwey with him / And they
shall follow alwey the lamb / The fourth and the last / this feast is
establysshed for to Impetre and get the sonner that thing that we pray fore /
by cause that we honor this day all the saints generally / which also
pray for us all to geder / And so they may the lightly er get the mercy of
our lord for us / For if hit be Impossible that the prayers of sum saints
be not herd / hit is much more Impossible / that the prayers of al should not
be herd / And this reason is touched when hit is said in the collette /
Desideratam nobis tue propiciacionis habundanciam multiplicatis intercessoribus
largiaris / lord give to us by the multyplyed prayers of all thy saints / the
desired habundance of thy debonayrte / And the saints pray for us by merit /
and by effect / by merit when their merit helps us / by effect / when
they desire our desires to be accomplysshed / And this do they not / but there
as they accomplysshe the will of our lord / And that on this day all the
saints assemble them for to pray for us / It is showed in a vysyon / that
happend in the second year after this feste was stablysshed / On a time when
the sextayne of saint Pe^^r had by devotion visited all the aulters of the
Church / And had required suffragies of all the saints / At last he came
again to thaulter of saint Peter / And there rested a little / and saw there
a vysyon / For he saw the king of kings in an hyhe throne sit And all the
Angels about him / And the blessed virgyn of vyrgyns came crowned with a right
resple^d ysshynge rowne / And there followed her a great multitude of vyrgyns
without nombre and contynentes also / And anon the king arose against her /
and made her to sytte on a sete by him / And after came a man cladde with the
skin of a camel / and a great multitude of ancient / and honorable faders
following him / And after came a man in thabyte of a bishop / and a great
multitude in semblable habyte following him / And after came a multitude of
knights without nombre / whom followed a great company of diverse people /
Then came they all to fore the Trone of the king / And adoured him upon their
knees / And then he that was in thabyte of a Bishop began matyns / and the
other followed And an Aungel / which ladde this sextayne thus in the vysyon /
expowned this vysyon to him / and said / that our blessed lady the vyrgyne was
she that was in the first company / and he that was cladde in the heir of
camels was saint Johan baptyst with the patriarchs and prophets / And he that
was aourned in thabyte of a bishop was Peter with thappostles / The knights
were the martirs / And the other the confessors / the which al came to fore
our lord sitting in his throne for to give to him lawde and than kings of
thonour that was done to them in this world of the mortalle people / And prayed
to him for all the universal world / And after the Aungel brought him in to
another place / and showed to him men and wymmen sum in beds of gold /
other enioyenge in diverse delytes / other naked / and pour / and other
beggyng / And said to bym / that this was the place of purgatory / they that
dwelled there were the sowles / they that habounded in welthe were the sowles
of them which were socoured by their Friends by many aids / The pour were
the sowles / of whom their executours and Friends set not by them / ne did
no thing for them / And then he commanded him / that he should show this to
the pope / that after the feste of all halowen he should establisshe the
commemoracion of all sowles / And that generalle suffrages temporal might be
done for them on the next day where they may have none in special /

Thus ends the solempnyte of al saints
Here follows the commemoracion of al souls
THe memory of the departing of al Christian souls is stablysshed to be
solempnesed in the church on this day / to ^hende that they may have general
aid and comfort / where as they may have none special / like as it is showed
in the foresaid reuelacion And Peter damyens says yt in Cecyll in the isle of
wulcan / saint Odylle herd the voices and the howlings of deuyls which
complained strongly / by cause that the sowles of them that were deed were
taken aweye fro their hands by almesses and by prayers / And therefore he
ordeygned that the feste and remembrance of them that been departed out of
this world / should be made and holden in all monasteryes / the day after the
feast of al holowen / the which thing was approuyd after of al holy Church /
And thereof we may specially touch two things / First of the purgacion of tho
sowles / And secondly of their suffrages / Of the first is to be considered
three things / First who ben they that been purged / Secondly / by whom they
ben purged / Thyrdly / where they ben purged / It is to wete that there ben
three manners of them that been purged / The first ben they that deye to fore er
they have done satisfaction of the penance yt has been enjoined to hem /
Nevertheless if they had so much co^tricion in the heart / that it had suffysed
tefface the sin / they should have freely passyd to the life perdurable / hou be
it that they had not accomplysshed their will ne satisfaction / For contricion
is right great satisfaction of their sins / and putting awey of sin And
hereof says saint Iheromme / The length of time auaylleth not so much as of
sorrow / ne thabstynence of metes auaylleth not so much as the mortyfycacion
of vices / but now they that deye without this contricion to fore
taccomplysshynge of their penance / ben grievously punysshed in purgatory /
but if it happen that the satisfaction of them be done of sum of their
friends But to this that such mutacion of the satisfaction may auaille / four
things ben required /

The first is of thauctortte of the chaunger / for it ought be don of
thauctoryte of the priest / The second / is of his part for whom this
mutacion is of the satisfaction / that is the necessite of him / For he may be
in such estat / that he may not well do satisfaction for that other^ that is
to say in charity / For he ought to be in charity / The third is on his side
/ on whom the commutacion is maade of satisfaction for that other / that is to
say of charity / For it is requysyte that he be in charity by which he makes
satisfaction to be merytoryous and suffycyent / The fourth thing is
proporcion / that is to wete / that the less pain be proporcioned in to
gretter / For the propre pain of the synnar satisfyeth more to god than of a
stranger / And alwey is he tormentid in purgatory / but for the pain that he
suffers / And that other pays for him / he is the sonner delyuerd / For god
acounteth his pain and the pain of that other / For if he were condemned to
suffer the pain of two months in purgatory / he might so be helped / that
he should be delyuerd in a monethe / but he shall never be taken thennes tylle
the debt be paid / And when it is paid / that ought to be paid / after it is
conuertid in to the well of him that had done hit / And if he have no need / It
is turned unto the well of other that been in purgatory / The second that been in
purgatory / ben they that have accomplysshed their penance / but alweye by the
neclygence or ignorance of the priest / which confessyd them / It was not
suffysaunt / And if they have not had right contricion that may suffyse for
their sin / they shall accomplysshe all that there / by cause of the little
penance doing in this life / For our lord that knows the manner / and the
mesure of pains and of sins / he gives pain suffysaunt / in such wise /
that there remains not one pain unpunished / Then the penance that is
enjoined either it is gretter / or egalle / or less / if it be gretter / they
that have done more / hit shall torn to thencreacynge of glory / if it be
egall / then hit shall suffyse to the remyssion of his sin / if it be
less / then that which lacks shall be fulfilled by the virtue of the
dyuyne puyssaunce and Justice / Of them that repent them at the last /
herkene what Augustyn says / he that is baptized / and at that hour goth out
of this world / he goth surely / A man well living / and so deyeth gooth
surely / A man doing penance at the last / and reconciled / if he goo surely
I am not sure / Therefore hold the certain weye / and leave the uncertain weye /
This says seint Austyn for such done penance more for need than of will /
and rather for dread of pain / than for love of glory / The third / that gone
in to purgatory / ben they that bear wode / heye and stubple / This ben they /
that not withstanding they love god yet they have carnalle affection to their
Rychesses / their wives / and possessions / yet they love no thing to fore god
/ And these ben tormented in purgatory after the manner of their long or short
being therein / as the wood in long brennyng as the heye less / or the
stubple leest and shortest / And saint Augustyn says / though this fire be not
perdurable / yet it is grievous merueylously / so that hit surmounteth all the
pain that any man suffryd ever in this world / For so grievous pain was never
founden in the flesh / how be it that martirs have suffryd great pains / The
second / is to wete / by whom they ben purged / or by whom punycion is maade
/ It is done by the euylle Angels / and not by the good / For the good Angels
tormente not the good sowles / but the good angels tormente the euylle angels
/ and the euylle angels tormenten the evil Christian sowles / And it is well to
believe that the good Angels vysyte often and comfort their brethren and their
felawes / and warn them to suffer in pacyence / And yet have they another
remedy of comfort of this that attend certainly the glory to come / For
they be certain to have joy / less than they that been in the contreye / and
more certaynte / than they that been in their life / For the certaynte of them
that been in the country is without abiding and dread / For they abide not
that is for to come / when they have it present and doubt no thing to lose
it / But the certeynte of them that been in the life is contrary / but the
certaynte of them that been in purgatory is moyenne / for they abide to have it
/ and without dread / For they have free will without dread confermed / that
they may no more sin / And yet have they another comfort / that they wene
alwey / that there ben made prayers and done almesses for them / And
peradventure / it is is more true that / this punycion not made by evil
angels / but by commandment of the dyuyne Justice / And by the fors thereof
succedynge / As to the third hit is to wete where they ben purged / in a place
by hell / which is called Purgatory / after thoppynyon of diverse wysemen /
how be it / that it seems to sum other / that it is in thayer in a place
brennynge and round / but nevertheless there ben ordained diverse places to
diverse sowles / and for many causes / And that is for light punycion / or for
hasty delyueraunce or for the sin commysed in that place or for ye prayer of
some saint First for the lyt punycion as it is showed to sum / after that
saint gregory says / that sum sowles ben purged in the shadow / Secondly
for their hasty delyueraunce / that they may show unto other / how that they
need to require aid / And thereby might hastily issue out of the pain / like
as it is read / that sum fysshars of saint Thybault / that fysshed on a time
in harueste and took a great pyece of yse / instead of a fysshe / And they
were gladder thereof than of a fysshe / by cause the bishop had a great
brennynge of hete in his leg / And they leyde that ice there to / and it
refresshyd him much / And on a time the bishop herd the voys of a man in the
ice / And he coniured him to tell him what he was / And the voys said to him.
I am a soul / which for my sins am tormented in this ice / and may be
delyuerd if thou say for me thyrtiy masses contynuelly to gyder in thyrtty
days / And the bishop emprysed to say them / And when he had said half of
them / he made him ready to continue forth and say the other / And the deuylle
maade a discencion in the Cite / that the people of the Cite fought each against
other / And then the Bishop was called for tappese this discord / And did
of his vestymentes / And left to say the mass / And on the morn he began
all new again / And when he had said the two parts / him seemed / that a
great host had besyeged the Cite / so that he was constrained by dread / and
left to say the office of the mass / And after yet he began again the
seruyse / And when he had al accomplysshed except the last mass / which he
would have begonnen all the town and the bisshops hows was taken by fire / And
when his servants came to him / and bad him leave his mass / he said /
though all the Cite should be brent / I shall not leave to say the mass / And
when the mass was done the ice was molten / And the fire that they had
supposed to have seen / was but a fantosme / and did none harm Thyrdly / for
our Infyrmyte / that is / yt we know what great pain is made ready to synnres
after this mortalle life Also diverse places be deputed to diverse sowles for
our Instruction / as it happed at Marys / There was a master / which was
chau^celer at paris named Sylo / which had a scoler seek / And he prayed him /
that after his death he should come again to him / and say to him of his estate
/ And he promised him so to do / and after deyde / And a while after he
appyered to him / clad in a Cope wreton fulle of argumentis fallacions and
sophymmes / and was of parchemyn / And within forth all fulle of flambe of fire
/ And the chaunceler demanded him what he was / And he told to him / I am
such one / that am comen again to the / And the chau^celer demanded him of
his estate / And he said / this Cope weyeth on me more than a mylne stone / or
a toure / And it is given me for to bear / for the glory that I had in my
Sophyms and Sophystycall arguments / that is to say deceyuable and fallacions
/ The skynnes ben light / but the flamme of fire within forth tormenteth / and
al to brenneth me / And when the maystre Iuged the pain to be light / the
deed scoler said to him / that he should put forth his hand / and feel the
lytnes of his pain / and he put forth his hand / And that other let fall a
drope of his sweet on hit / And the drope percyd thorugh his hand sonner than
an arowe could be shoten thorugh / whereby he felt a merueylous tormente And
the deed man said / I am all in such pain / And then the chaunceler was
all aferd of the cruel and terryble pain / that he had felt / concluded to
forsake the world / and entryd in to relygyon with great devotion / Fourthly
for the sin that has be co^mysed in the place / As saint Augustyn says /
Sometime sowles be punysshed in ye places where they have sinned as appiereth by
an ensample that saint gregory recites in the fourth book of his dyalogue /
and says that there was a priest / which vsyd gladly a bayne / and when he came
in to the bayne / he fond a man whom he knew alwey ready for to serve him /
And it happed on a day that for his dylygent seruyse / and his reward the
priest gaf to him an holy loof / And he weeping answered / Fader wherefore gyuest
thou me this thing / I may not ete it / for it is holy / I was sometime lord of
this place / but after my death I was deputed for to serve here for my sins /
but I pray the that thou wylt offer this bread unto almyty god for my sins /
And know thou for certain that thy prayer shall be herd / And when then
thou shalt come to wasshe the / thou shall not find me / And then this
priest offryd all a weke entiere sacryfyse to god / for him / And when he came
again / he fond him not / Fyftly diverse places ar deputed to diverse sowles
for ye prayers of sum saint / as it is read of saint patryke / that he
Impetred a place of purgatory in Irelond for sum Of which thystory is wreton
to fore in his life / And as to the thyrdde / that is suffrages / three things
ought to be considered / First the suffrages that been done / Secondly of them
/ for whom they be done / Thirdly of them by whom they be done / About the
suffrages that been done / It is to be noted / that there ben done four manner of
suffrages / which prouffite unto them that been deed / that is to wete prayers
of good Friends / gyuynge of almesses / Singing of masses / and obseruacion of
fastings As touching to that / that the prayers of friends prouffite to them /
It appiereth by ensample of paschasyen / of whom gregory tells in the fourth
book of his dyalogues / and says that there was a man of great holiness and
virtue And two were chosen for to have been popes / but nevertheless at the last
the Church accorded unto one of them / And this paschasyen alwey by error
suffered that other / And abode in this error unto the death / And when he
was deed the byere was couerd with a clothe named dalmatyke / one that was
vexyd with a devil was brought thither / and touchyd the clothe / and anon he
was made hole / And a long time after as saint Germayn bishop of capuenne /
went to wesshe him in a bayne for his health / he fond paschasyen deken there
and served / and when he saw him / he was aferd / and inquired dylygently /
what thing so great and so holy a man made there / And he said to him that he
was there for none other cause / but for that he held and sustained more than
right required in the cause before said / and said I require the that thou
pray our lord for me / And know that thou shall be herd / For when thou
shall come again thou shall not find me here / And then the Bishop praid
for him / and when he came again he fond him not / And Pieter Abbot of Cluny
says that there was a priest that song every day mass of Requiem for all
Christian souls / And hereof he was accused to the bishop / and was suspended
therefore of his office / And as the Bishop went on a day of great solempnyte
in the Church yerd / all the deed bodies aroos up against him saying / this
Bishop gives to us no mass / And yet he has taken awey our priest fro us /
Now he shall be certain / but if he amend he shall deye / And then the
Bishop assoylled the priest / and sange him self gladly for them that were
passid out of this world / And so it appierith that the prayers of living
people ben profitable to them that been departed / by this that the Chauntour
of paris reherceth / There was a man that alweye as he passed thorugh the
Church yerd / he said De profundis for all Christian sowles / And on a time he
was bysette with his enemies / so that for socour he leep in to the chircheyerd
/ And they followed for to have slain him / And anon all the deed bodies arose
/ and each held such a Instrument in his hand that they defended him that
prayde for them / And chaced aweye his enemies putting them in great fere /
And the Second manner of suffrages is for to give almesses / and that helps
them / that been in purgatory / as it appiereth in the book of Machabeis / where
hit is read / that Judas the most strong man made a collacion / and sent to
Jerusalem xij thousand drammes of silver there to be offryd for the sins of
deed men / remembrynge ryghtfully and relygyously of the resurection / And how
much to give alms avails for them / that been departed it appyereth by
ensample that saint gregorye puts in his fourth book of dyalogues / There
was a knight that lay deed / and his spyryte taken fro him / And a while after
/ the soul returned to the body again / And what he had seen done / he told
and said there was a bridge / And under that bridge was a flood foul / horrible
/ and full of stenche / and on that other side of the bridge was a medowe sweet
odoraunt and aourned full of all manner flowers / And there on that side of the
bridge were peples assembled cladde al in white that were filled with the sweet
odoure of the flowers / And the bridge was such / that if any of the mynystres
would pass over the bridge / he should slide and fall in to that stynkyng River
/ And the ryghtwys people passid over lightly and surely / in to that delectable
place / And this knight saw there a man named Pieter / which lay bounden /
and great weight of iron upon him / which when he axyd / why he lay so there
/ It was said to him of another he suffers by cause if any man were delyuerd
to him to do vengeance / He desired it more to do it by cruelte / than by
obedyence / Also he said / he saw there a pilgrim / that when he came to the
bridge / he passid over with great lyghtnes and shortly by cause he had well
lived here / and purely in the world / and without sin / And he saw there
another named Stephen / which when he would have passid / his foot slode that
he fylle half over the bridge / And then there came sum horrible black men /
And did all that they might to draw him down by the legs / And then came
other right fair Creatures and white / and took him / by the arms / and drew
him up / And as this stryf endured / this knight that saw these things
returned to his body / and knew not which of them vaynquysshed / But this way
we understand that the wicked deeds / that he had done / strofe against the
works of almesses / For by them that drew him by the arms upward / hit
appierid that he louyd almesses / And by the other / that he had not
parfightely lyuyd ageynste the sins of the flesh / The thyrdde manner of
suffrages is the oblacion and offryng of the holy sacrament of the altar /
which prouffiteth much to them that been departed as it appiereth by many
ensamples / like as saint gregory recounteth in the fourth book of his
dyalogue / that one of his monks named Iustus / when he came to his last end /
he showed that he had hid three pens of gold / And thereof sorowed sore / And
anon after he deyde / And then saint gregory commanded his brethren / that
they should burye his body in a donghylle / And the three pieces of gold with him
/ saying / thy money be to the in perdycion Nevertheless saint Gregory
commanded one of his brethren to say for him every day mass thyrtty days
long / And so he did / And when he had accomplysshed his term / the monk
that was deed appierid on the thyrttyest day to one / which demanded how it
was with him / And he ansuerde to him / I have been euylle at ease unto this day
/ but I am now well / I have this day received commynyon / and this sacrifice of
thaulter prouffiteth not only to them yt ben deed / but also to them yt ben
living in this world / It happed there was a man which was with other labourid
in a roche for to dygge for silver / and suddenly ye roche fill on them / and
slew them al sauf this one man / which was sauyd in a creuyce of the roche /
but for all yt he myt not issue ne go out / and his wife supposed yt he had been
deed / and did do sing every day a mass for him / and bare every day to
thoffryng a loof and a pot of wine and a candel / and the devil which had
envy herat appierid three days contynuel to this woman in form of a man and
demanded her whyder she went / and when she had said to him / he said to her /
thou ghost in vayn / for the mass is done And thus she left the mass three
days / that she did not sing for him / And after this another man dygged in
the same Roche for silver / And herd under this the voys of this man / which
said to him / smite soft / and spare thyn hand / For I have a great stone
hanging over my head / And he was aferd / and called mo men to him for to here
this voys / and began to dig again / And then they herd semblably that
voys / And then they went more ner / And said who art thou / And he said I
pray you to spare your smytyng / For a great stone hangs over my head / and
then they wente^ and dug on that one side til that they came to him / and
drew him out al hole / And they inquired of him / In what manner he had so
long lyned there / And he said / that every day was brought to him a loof / a
pot wyn and a candell / sauf these three days / And when his wife herd that /
she had great joy / And knew well / that he had be sustained of her offryng /
and that the devil had deceived her / that she had do sing no mass tho three
days / And as Peter thabbot of Cluny wytnessyth and says / that in the town
of ferare in the dyocise of granepolytane / that a maronner was fallen in to
the sea by a tempest / and anon a priest sange mass for him / And at the
last he came out of the sea / al sauf / And when he was demanded how he
escaped / he said / that when he was in the Sea / and almost deed / there came to
him a man which gaf to him bread / And when he had eten / he was well
comforted / and recouerd his strength / and was taken up of a ship that passed
by And that was founden that hit was the same time that the priest offrid to
god the blessed sacrament for him / And the fourth manner of suffrages / that
prouffiteth to them that been deed / is fasting /

Saint Gregorye in spekyng of this matere / and of three other wytnessyth it and
says / the sowles of them / that been departed ben assoilled in four manners /
by thoblacion of priests / by the prayers of saints / by the alms of
friends / and by the fastings of their kynnesmen / that the penance done for
them by their Friends is vaillable to them / hit is showed by a solemn
Doctor / which reherceth that there was a woman / which had her husbond
deed And she was in great despair for pouerte / And the devil appierid to her
/ and said that he would make her rich / if she would do as he would say to her
And she promised to do hit / And he enjoined her that the men of the church
that she should receive in to her house that she should make them do fornycacion
/ Secondly that she should take in to her hows by day time pour men / And in
the night drive them out void and having no thing / Thirdly that she should
in the Church let prayers by her Ianglyng / And that she should not confess
her of none of all these things /

And at the last as she approached toward her death / her sone warned her to be
confessid / And she discovered to him what she had promised / And said / that
she might not be shryuen / And that her confession should auaylle her no thing /
But her sone hasted her / and said he would do penance for her / she repentid
her / and sent for to fetch the priest / But to fore er the priest came / the
deuyls ronnen to her / and she deyde by thoorryblenes of hem / Then the sone
confessid the sin of the mother. And did for her seven year penance / And
that accomplysshed he saw his mother / And she thanked him of her delyueraunce
/ And in like wise auaille the Indulgences of the church /

It happed that a legate of the pope praid a noble knight that he would make
war in the seruyse of the church / and ride to Albigoi^ / And he would
therefore give pardon to his fader / which was deed / And the knight ^ode forth
and abode there an hole lent And that done / his fader appiered to him more
clear than the day / and thanked him of his delyueraunce / And as to the third
/ that is to say for whom the suffrages ben don / there ben iiij things to be
considere / First who ben they / to whom it may prouffyte / Secondly / Wherefore
hit ought to prouffyte them / Thyrdly hit must be known / if hit prouffyte to
all egally / Fourthly how they may know the suffrages / that been done for
them / As to the first / who ben they / to whom the suffrages may prouffite /
It is to be known as saint Austyn says / that all they / that depart out of
this world / or they ben right good or right euylle / or between both Then
the suffrages that been done for the good / ben for to yield thankynges for them
/ And they that been done for the evil / ben sum comfort to them that live /
And they that been done for them that been myddle / and between both / they ben
clensynges to them / And they that been right good / ben they that anon flee to
heaven / And ben quyte of the fire of purgatory / and of hell also / And there
ben three manner of this people / that been children baptized Martirs and parfyght
men / These ben they that parfyghtely mayntenyd the love of god / the love of
his neighbor and good works / And thought never to plese the world / but to
god only And if they had done any venyal sin / Hit was anon put awey by
the love of charity / like as a drope of water in a fornays / And therefore they
bear no thing with them that ought to be brent / And who that prays for any
of these three manner peuple / or does any suffrages for them / he does to them
wrong / For saint Augustyn says / he does wrong that prays for a martyr But
if one pray for one that is rizt good / of whom he doubts that he be in
heaven / then of his orysons ben yeuen thankynges / And they come to the
prouffite of him that prays / like as Dauyd says / My prayer shall be tornyd
in to my bosom / And to these manners of people is the heaven anon open / when
they depart / ne they feel no fire of purgatory / And this is signyfyed to us
by the three / to whom the heaven was opened / It was first opened to Ihesu
Christ when he was baptized and prayeng / by which is signefyed that the heaven
is open to them that been baptitised / be they young or aged / if they deye /
anon they flee in to heaven / For baptysme is clensyng of all orygenall sin
and mortalle by the virtue of the passion of Ihesu Christ / Secondly / hit was
opened to saint Stephen / when he was stoned / whereof it is said in thactes of
thappostles / I see the Heuens open / And in this is sygnefyed that hit is open
to all martirs / And they flee anon to heaven / as soon as they depart /
Thyrdly / hit was opened to saint Johan theua^gelist / which was right
parfyght / whereof is said in thapocalipse / I beheld / and loo the door was
open in heaven / by which it appiereth that it is opened to parfyght men / that
have all accomplysshed their penance / And have in them no venyal sins / or
if any happen to be commysed / anon it is consumed and extyncte / by the
ardour of charity / And thus heaven is open to these three manner of people which
enter lightly in for to regne perpetuelly / The right evil and wicked men ben
they / that anon ben plunged in to the fire of hell / For whom if their
dampnacion be known there ought no suffrages be done for them / after that
saint Augustyn says / if I knew my fader to he in hell / I would no more
pray for him than for the devil / but if any suffrages were done for a
dampened man / Of whom were doubt that he so were / nevertheless they should not
prouffite hxm to his delyueraunce / ne that is to say fro the pains ne do the
mytygacion of them / ne lassyng of it / ne shorting of time / For as Job says
/ In hell is no redemption / They that been myddle good / ben they / that have
with them some thing to be brent and purged / that is to say wode / heye and
stupple / or else they that been surprysed with death / before they might have
accomplysshed their penace in their life / Ner they be not so good but that they
need have suffrages of their friends / ne they be not so euylle / but that
suffrages might prouffyte and ease them / And the suffrages that been done for
them / ben clensynges for them And these ben they / to whom suffrages only may
prouffyte / And in doing such manner suffrages / the church is acustomed to
observe three manner days that is the seventh day / the thyrttyest day / And
thannyuersarye / And the reason of these three days is assigned in the book of
office / The seventh day is kept and obseruyd / that the souls should come to
the sabate of everlasting rest / or by cause that all the sins that they
have commysed in their life / be foryeuen / which they have done by seven days
/ or that all the sins that they have commysed in their body / which is
made of four complexions / and in their soul / ^in which ben three poures may
be forgyuen / The trentalle is kept / which is in three dysaynes / that they
may be purged of all such things / as they have sinned in the trynyte / And
brekynge of the ten commandments / The annyuersarye is observed that they
come fro the years of calamyte and maleurte unto the years of perdurabilite /
And like as we solempnyse every year the feste of a saint to their honor /
and our prouffit Right so we observe thannyuersary of them that been deed unto
their prouffyte and our devotion / Of the second / that is / wherefore the
suffrages ought to prouffite to them / It is to wete / that hit ought be
prouffite for three reasons / First by reason of unity / For they ben one body
with them of the Church mylytaunt / And therefore their goods ought to be common
/ Secondly by reason of dignyte / by which they deserved when they lived /
that these suffrages should prouffite them / For they help other / And it is
reason that they be helped that have helped other / Thirdly by reason of
necessite / For they ben in the state / in which they may not help them self /
As to the thirdde it is to wete / if it prouffyte to all egally / It is to wete
that the suffrages / if they be done for some in especial they prouffite more
to them / for whom they be made / tha^ for other / And if they hen done for the
common / they prouffite most to them that have deseruyd most in this life / And
if they be made egalle / hit prouffiteth them that have most need / Fourthly /
that is to wete / if they know the suffrages that been done for them After
saint Augustyn / they may know it by three manners / First by dyuyne reuelacion
/ that is when our lord shows to them such thing / Secondly / by
manyfestacion of good Angels / which ben alwey here with us / and considere
all that we do / and may incontinent descend to them / and anon she we it to
them / Thirdly by Intymacion of sowles / that gone hens and gone thider / For
the souls that gone from hens out of this world may well tell be such
things and other Fourthly nevertheless / they may know it by experyence and
by reuelacion / for when they feel them self alleged / and releued of their
pain / they know well / that some suffrages have been done for them / Thirdly
/ it is to wete / by whom these suffrages ben made / that is to wete / that if
these suffrages should prouffite / It behooves / that they ben done by them that been in charity / For if they ben done by evil and sinful persons they may
not prouffite to them / whereof is read that when a knight lay in his bed
with his wife / And the moon shone right clear / which entrid in by the
creueches / he merueyled much / wherefore man which was reasonable obeyed not to
his maker / when the creatures not reasonable obeyed to him / And then began
to say evil of a knyt which was deed / and had been famylyar with him / And
then this knight / of whom they so talked entryd in to the chamber / and said
to him / Friend / have none euylle suspecion of any man / but pardonne me if I
have trespaced to the / And when he had demanded him of his state / He ansuerd
I am tormentid of diverse torments and pains / and specially by cause I
defouled the church yerd / and hurt a man therein / and despoilled him of his
mantell / which he ware / which mantell I bear on me / and is heuyer than a
Montayne / And then he prayed the knight / that he would do pray for him / And
then he demanded if he would that such a priest should pray for him or such
one / and the deed man wagged his head / and answered not / as he would not have
him / Then he axyd of him / if he would that such an Heremyte should pray for
him / And then the deed man answered / would god that he would pray for me / And
the living knight promised / that he should pray for him / And then the deed
man said / And I say to the / that this day two year / thou shall deye / And
so vanysshed aweye / And this knight changed his life in to better / And at the
day slepte in our lord / That which is said / that suffrages done by evil
men may not prouffyte / but if they ben works sacramentalle / as is the
celebracion of the ma^^e / For that may not be defowled of an euylle mynystre /
Or else if he / that is deed left any goods to dispose by sum euylle man /
And should anon have disposed them / And did not / like as it is red that it
happed / As Turpyn tharchebisshop of Raynes says / that there was a noble
knight that was in the batail with Charles the grant for to fight ageynste
the mores / And prayde one that was his Cosyn / that if he deyde in bataylle /
that he should selle his horse and give the prys thereof to pour people / And he
deyde / and that other desired the ^ors / and retained it for him self / And a
little while after he that was deed appiered to that other knight shynynge as
the son / and said to him / Cosyn thou have made me to suffer pain eight
days in purgatory by cause thou gauyst not the price of my horse to pour people
/ but thou shall not escape awey unpunished / This day deuylles shall bear
thy soul in to hell / And I being purged go in to the kingdom of heaven /
And suddenly was a great cry herd in thayer / as of beres lions / and wulues /
which bare him awey / Then late every executour be ware that he execute well
the goods of them that they have charge of / and to beware by this ensample
here to fore wreton / For he is blessid that (...) beware by other men's
harms / And late us also pray dyligently for all Christian sowles / that by
the moyen of our prayers / Almesses / and fastings they may be eased and
lyssed of their pains / AMEN /

Thus ends the commemora^cion of al Christian sowles
Here follows the life of saint wenefryde vyrgyne and martyr
AFtir that the holy man Beuno had do made many chirches / And had ordained the
seruyse of god deuoutely to be said in them / He came to a place of a
worshipful man named Tenythe / the which was the sone of a noble Senator
called Elynde / And desired that he would give him as much ground as he might
bylde a Church on in thonour of god / Then he gra^^ted him his asking with
good will And then did do build thereon a fair church / To ^he which this
worshipful man / his wife / And his daughter Wenefryde resorted daily / for to
here therein dyuyne seruyse / And then Wenefryde was set to scole to this holy
man Beuno / And he taught her full dylygently / And informed her parfyghtly in
the faith of Ihesu Criste / And this holly maid wenefryde yaf credence to his
words / and was so enflammed with his holy doctrine / that she purposed to
forsake al worldly plesaunces / and to serve almighty god in mekenes / and in
Chastyte / And then it fortuned upon a sunday / she was diseased / and she
abode at home / and kept her faders hows / while they were at church / To
whom there came a yo^ge man for to defowle her / who was named Cradok the sone
of a king named Alane / which young man brenned in the concupiscence of her /
by thentycynge of the fend / which had envy at this holy vyrgyne w^^efryde /
And she demanded the cause of his coming / And when she understood his
corrupt intent she excused her / and put him of all that she might / And he
alweye abiding in his foul purpos would in no wise be answered / then she
considering his foul desire / and feryng lest he would oppress her / feigned
her / as she would have consented / and said she would go in to her chamber / for
to array her self for to plese him the better And when he had agreed to her /
she closed fast the chamber door / and fled pryuely by another door toward
the church / And when this young man had espied her / he followed her with
his swerd drawn like a wood man And when he had overtaken her / he said to
her these words / Sometime I louyd the / and desired to have the to my wife /
But one thing tell now / to me shortly / either cousente to me taccomplysshe
my plaisir / or else I shall slay the with this swerd / Then this blessed
vyrgyne wenefryde thought fermely that she would not forsake the sone of the
everlasting king / for to please the sone of a temporal king / And said to him
in this manner / I will in no wise consent to thy foul and corrupt desire /
For I am joined to my spouse Ihesu Christ / which preserves and keeps my
vyrgynyte / And trust thou very^y / that I will not forsake him / for all thy
menaces and thretenynges / And when she had said thus / this cursyd Tyrant
full of malice smote of her head / And in the same place where as the head fill
to the ground / there sprange up a fair well gyuyng out haboundauntly fair
clear water / where our lord God yet daily shows many miracles / And many
seek people having diverse dyseases have there ben cured / and heled by the
merits of this blessid virgyne saint wenefryde / And in the said well appiere
yet stones bespryncte and specled / as it were with blood / which can not be
had awey by no mean / And the moss that grows on these stones is of a
merueylous sweet odor / And that endures unto this day / And when the fader
and mother knew of their daughter / they made great lamentacion for her death /
by cause they had no moo children / but her only / And when this holy man Beuno
understood the death of wenefryde / and saw the heaviness of her fader and mother
/ he comforted them goodly / And brought them to the place where as she lay
deed / And there he made a sermon to the people declarynge her vyrgynyte / And
how she had auowed to be a relygyous woman / And after took up the head in his
hands / and set to the place where it was cut of / And desired all the
people that there were present to knele down / And pray deuoutely unto Almighty
god / that it might plese him to reyse her again unto life / And not only for
the comfort of fader and mother / but for to accomplysshe the vow of Relygyon
/ And when they aroos fro prayer / this holy vyrgyne arose with them also /
made by miracle alive again / by the power of almighty god / wherefore all the
people gaf lawde and praysyng unto his holy name for this great miracle / And
ever as long as she lived after / there appiered about her neck a redenes round
about like to a read threde of sylke / in sign and token of her martyrdom /
And this young man that had thus slain her / had wyped kis swerd on the grass
/ and stood stylle there beside / And had no power to remeue aweye / ne to
repent him of that cursyd deed / And then this holy man Beuno repreuyd him /
not only of thomycyde / but also by cause he reverenced not the sunday / and
dradde not the great power of god there showed upon this holy virgyne / and said
to him / why have thou no contricion for thy mysdede / but sith thou repentest
not / I byseche almighty god to reward the after thy deseruynge / And then
he fylle down deed to the ground / and his body was al black / and suddenly
borne awey with fendes / Then after this holy maid Wenefryde was veyled and
consecrate in to Relygyon by the hands of this holy man Beuno / And he
commanded her tabyde in the same church / that he had do make there / by the
space of seven year / And there tassemble to her virgyns of honest and holy
conversation whom she should inform in the laws of god / And after the seven
year to go to sum holy place of relygyon And there tabyde the resydue of her
l^f And when this holy man should depart fro her / and go in to Irlond / she
followed him till she came to the forsaid well / where they stood talking a
long while of heavenly things / And when they should depart / this holy man
said / It is the will of our lord that thou send to me every year sum
token / which thou shall put in to the streme of this well / and fro hens it
shall by the streme be brought in to the sea / and so by the purueau^ce of god
it shall be brought over the sea the space of fyfty mile / to the place where

this holy Abbot Elerius delyuerd to this holy vyrgyne Wenefryde the charge of
the susters / but she reffused it / as long as she might / but by constreynte
she took the charge / and lyuyd afterward a virtuous life / and more strayter
and harder than she did to fore / in gyuyng good ensample to all her susters /
And when she had continued there in the seruyse of god eight year / she
yielded up her spyryte to her maker To whom late us pray / to be a specialle
intercessour for us AMEN /

Thus ends the life of wenefryde vyrgyne and martyr
Here follows the life of saint Leonard And first of his name
LEonard is as much to say / as the odor of the people / And it is said of
leos that is people / and of nardus that is an herb sweet smelling / For by
the odor of good fame he drew the people to him / by thodour of good renommee
/ Or Leonard may be said as gaderynge hyhe things / Or hit is said of lion /
the lion has in him self four things / The first is force or strength / And
as Isydre says / hit is in the breast and in the head / And so the blessed
saint Leonard had strength in his breast / by the refraynyng of evil thoughts
/ in the heed by contemplacion of sovereign things / Secondly / the lion has
subtilyte in two thyngis For he has his eyes open / when he slepeth / And
diffaceth his traces when he flees / And thus Leonard waked by labor of good
work / and in waking he slepeth by rest of contemplacion / And diffaceth in
him self the trace of all worldly affection / Thyrdly the lion has might in
his voys / For by his voys he reyseth the thirdde day his whelpe that is deed
borne / And makes all other beestes by him to be in pees and rest / And in
like wise Leonard raised many that were deed in sin / and many that lived
bestyally / he fixed them in good works and profitable / Fourthly / the lion
has dread in his heart after that ysydore says / He doubts two things /
that is the noise of wheles of chariottes or carts / and fire brennyng / In
like wise Leonard doubted / and in doubtyng he eschewed all the noise of the
world / And therefore he fled in to the deserte / And he eschewed the fire of
couetyse / and therefore he reffused the tresours that were of fryd to him

Of saint Leonard
AT is said that leonard was about the year of our lord / vC / And he was
baptized in the holy fount of saint Remyge Archebisshop of Raynes And was
Instruct of him / and enduced in holy disciplynes of health / And the parents
and kynnesmen of saint Leonard were chyef and highest in the palace of the king
of France / This Leonard gate so much grace of the king / that all the
prysonners that he vysyted were anon delyuerd And when the renommee of his
holiness grew and encreaced / the king constrained him for to dwell with him
long time / till that he had time couenable / and gaf to him a Bisshopryche /
And he reffused it / and left al desiring to be in deserte / And went to
Orleaunce prechynge there with his brother Lieffart / And there lived a little
while in a Couente / And then Lyeffart had desire to dwell allone in a
deserte upon the River of Loyre / And Leonard was warned by tholy ghoost to
preche in guyan / And then they kyssyd to gyder / and departed Then Leonard
preached there / and did many miracles / and dwelled in a forest nyghe to the
Cite of Lymoges In which forest the king had do made an halle or a lodge /
which was ordained for him when he should go hunte / And hit happed on a day
that the king went for to hunte in that forest And the queen which was gone
thither with him for her recreacion / which then was great with child began
to trauayll of child / And the trauayll endured long / and was in point to
perysshe / so that the king and all the meyny wept for the peril of the queen
/ And then Leonard passyd thorugh the forest / and herd the vois of them that
wept / and was moeued with pity and went thither / And the king called him /
And demanded him what he was / and he said that he was a disciple of saint
Remyge / And then the king had good hope / by cause he had been informed of
a good maistre / And brought him to the queen / and prayed him / that he would
pray for her and for the fruit that she bare that she might get of god double
joy / And anon as he had made his prayer he gate of god that he required /
Then the king offryd to him much gold and silver / but he reffused al / and
desired him to give hit to pour men / and said / I have no need of no such
things / It suffyseth me to despise the Rychesses of the world / and to serve
god in this wode / and that is / that I desire / And then the king would have
given to him all the wode / I will not have all / but as much / as I may go
about with mine ass / in a night I desire / which the king gladly granted to
him / And there was made a monastery / In which he lived long in abstynence /
and two monks with him / And their water was a mile fro them / wherefore he
did do make a pytte all dry / the which he filled with water by his prayers
/ And called that place noble / by cause / he had received it of a noble
king And he shone there by so great miracles / that who that was in prison /
and called his name in aid / anon his bonds and feters were broken / and
went awey without any gaynsayeng freely / And came presentyng to him their
chains or yrons / And many of them / that were so delyuerd dwelled stylle
with him / and served there our lord / And there were seven of his noble
lygnage which fold awey all their goods / and duelleden with him / And he
delyuerd to each of them a part of that wood / And by his holy ensample / he
drew many to him / And at the last this holy man being endowed with many
virtues the eyghte ydus of Nouembre departed out of this world / and slept in
our lord wherafterward for the many miracles that god showed there it was
showed to the clerks of the Church / that by cause that place was over lytil
for the great multitude of people that came thither / that they should do make in
another place another Church / And bear therein the body of saint Leonard
honorably /

And then the Clerks and the peuple we^^ all three days in fastings and in
prayers / And on the third day / they saw all the countreye couerd with snow
/ sauf only the place wherein saint Leonard would rest / which was all void /
And thither was the body transported / And the Church made / And the great
multitude of yrons of diverse manners witness well / how many miracles our
lord has showed for him / And specially to prisoners / of whom the feters and
yrons hang to fore his tomb / The vycounte of lymoges had do make a great
chain for to fere with all the malefactors / and commanded / that it should
be fastened unto a tronke in his Toure / And who someuer was bounden with this
chain / to that tronke there as it was set / he might see no light / And hit
was a place right derke / And who so deyde there / deyde not of one death only
/ but more than of a thousand torments

And it happed that one of the servants of Saint Leonard / was bounden with
this Chain without deseruyng So that almost he gaf over his spyrit And
then as he might in his courage he auowed to Saint Leonard / And prayed him /
that sithe he delyuerd other / that he would have pity on his servant / And
anon saint Leonard appierid to him in a white vesture and said. Fere the no
thing / For thou shalt not deye / Arise up / And bear thou this chain with
the to my Church / follow me / for I goo to fore / Then he aroos / and took
the chain / and followed saint Leonard / which went to fore him / tylle he
came to the church / And anon as he was to fore the yates saint Leonard left
him there / and he then entrid in to the church / and recounted to all the
people / what saint Leonard had done / And be henge that great chain ^o fore
his Tomb /

There was a certain man / which duellyd in the place of saint Leonard And
was much faithful and devout to Saint Leonard / And hit happed that this
good man was taken of a Tyrant / which began to think in him self / that
Seynte Leonard unbinds / and loses all them / that been bounden in yrons /

And the might of iron has no more might ageynste him / than wax has
ageynste the Fire /

If I set this manne in yrons / Leonard shall anon delyuere him / And if I
may keep him / I shall make him pay for his raunsonne a thousand shyllynges
/ I wot well what I shall do / I shall goo make a right great and deep
pytte under the earth in my Toure / And I shall cast him theryn bounden with
many bonds / And after I shall do make a cheste of Tree / upon the mouth of
the pytte / And shall make my Knights to lie therynne al armed / And how be
hit / that if Leonard break the yrons / yet shall he not enter in to hit /
under the earth / And when he had made al this that he thought / This man
which was enclosed therein / cried often to saint Leonard / so that on a night
saint Leonard came / and turned the chyst wherein the knights lay armed and
closed them therein / like as deed men ben in a tomb / And after entryd in to
the fosse or pit with great light And took the hand of his true servant /
and said to him / Slepest thou or wakest / loo here is Leonard / whom thou so
much desyrest / And he sow merueylyng said / lord help me / Anon his chains
were broken / and took him in his arms / and bare him out of the toure / And
then spak to him as a friend does to a friend / and set him at home in his
hows / There was a pilgrim which returned fro the vysytynge of saint Leonard /
and was taken in Almayne / and put in a pytte or fosse / and fast closed therein
/ And this pilgrim prayed strongly saint leonard / and also them that took him
/ that they would for the love of saint leonard let him go / for he had never
trespaced to them / And they answered / but if he would pay much money / he
should not depart / And he said / be it / between you and saint Leonard / to
whom I remytte the matter / And the night following saint Leonard appired to
the lord of the castle / and commanded him that he should delyuere his pilgrim
/ And on the morn he supposed he had dremed / and would not delyuere him / The
next night he appiered to him again / and commanded him to late him goo /
but yet he would not obey / The third night saint Leonard took this pilgrim /
and brought him out of the castle / And anon the toure and half the castle
fylle / and oppressyd many of them that were therm And the prince only was le /
te to his confusion a live / and had his thyes broken / etcetera / There was
a knight in prison in Brytayne / which often called on saint Leonard / which
anon appiered to him in the sight of al men / and knowing him / And they
being sore abashed entryd in to the prison and brake his bonds / and put
them in the man's hand / and brought him forth before them all being sore
aferd / There was another Leonard which was of the same profession / and of
one virtue / of whom the body rests at Corbigny / And when this Leonard was
prelate in a monastery / he was of so great humylite / that he was seen to be
lowest of all / And much people came to him so fast / and so many / that they
that were enuyous said to the king Clotayre / that if he took not good head to
the Royamme of France / he should suffer damage / and that great by Leonard /
which gadred to him much people under the shadow of Relygyon / And then
this cruel king commanded that he should be chaced awey / but the knights that
come for to chase him / were so co^uertid by his words / that they were
conpuncte / and promised to be his disciples / And then the king repentid
him / and required pardon of him / And put them from him that had so myssayd
of him / and fro their goods and honors / And louyd much saint Leonard / so
that uneath the king would not restablysshe them again to their estate / at
the prayers of the holy saint / And this holy saint Impetred and had grant
of god / that who someuer were holden in prison / and prayed in his name / that
he should anon be delyuerd And on a day as he was in his prayers / a right
great serpente stretched him fro the foot of saint Leonard / a long upward
unto his breast / And he never therefore left his oryson / And when he had
accomplyssh^d his orysons / he said to the Serpent / I know Well that sithe the
beginning of thy creacion / thou tormentest men / as much as thou may / but
thy might is given to me now / do to me now that which I have deseruyd / And
when he had said thus / the Serpente sprange out of his hode / And fylle
down deed at his feet / After this on a time when he had appeased two Bisshops
/ that had been in discord / he said that he should on the morn fynysshe his
life / And so he did / And that was about the year of our lord vC / lxx /

Here follows the life of saint Leonard
Here follows of the four crowned martirs
THe four crowned martirs were Seuerus / Seuerianus / Capoforus / and
Victorinus / which by the commandment of Dyoclesian were beten with
plommettis of led unto the death / The names of whom could not be founden but
after long time they were showed by dyuyne reuelacion / and hit was was
establysshed that their memory should be worshipped under the names of five
other martirs / that is to wete / Claudyen / Castor / Symphorian / Nychostrate
/ and Symplycyen / which were martred two year after the four crouned martirs
/ And these martirs knew all the craft of sculpture or of keruyng / and
dyoclesian would have constrained them to kerue an ydolle / but they would not
entaylle ne kerue hit / ne consent to do sacrefyse to thydolles / And then
by the commandment of Dyoclesian they were put in to tonnes of leed all
living / and cast in to the sea about the year of our lord / two honderd four
score and seven / And Melchyades the (...) ordained these four saints to
(...) / and to be called / four crowned martirs before that their names were
founden / And though their names were afterward founden and known / yet for
thusage they ben alwey called the four crowned marthes /

Thus ends of the four crowned marters
Here follows of saint Theodore And first of his name
THeodore is seid of theos / that is as much to say / as god / and of das /
that is to say / give / And of ^usruris / that is a field /

And thus Theodorus is as much to say / as a field given of god / For he gaf
him to god / and renounced the feld of the Chyualrye of the emperor /

Of saint Theodore
THeodore suffered death under Dyoclesian and maxymyan in the Cite of Maryne /
And when the Provost said to him / that he should do sacrefyse / and return
to his first chyualrye / Theodore ansuerid / I serve my god and his sone Ihesu
Christ / To whom the provost said / then thy god has a son / and theodre
said ye certainly / To whom the provost said / Of whom may we know him /
And the odore said / Forsothe ye may well know him / and go to him / And
then there was term given to saint Theodore for to do sacryfyse unto
thydolles And he entryd in to the Temple of Mart by nyt / and put fire in it
under / and brent all the Temple / And then he was accused of a man / that
had seen him / and was enclosed in the prison for to deye there for hongre /
and then our lord appyerid to him and said Theodore my servant have thou
good hope / For I am with the / Then came to him a great company of men clad
in white / the door being closed / and began to sing with him / And when the
kepars saw that / they were aferd and fled / Then he was taken out / and
warned to do sacryfyse / he said / if thou brenne my flesh by fire / and
consumest hit by dyuyne torments / I shall never renye my god as long as my
spyryte is in me / Then he was honged on a tree by the commandment of
the emperor / and cruelly his body was rent and torn with hokes of iron yt his
bare rybbes appyeryd / Then the provost demanded of him Theodore wylt thou
be with us / or with thy god crist / and Theodore answered / I have been with my
Ihesu Christ / and am / and shall be / Then the provost commanded that he
should be burnt in a fire / In which fire he gaf up his spyryte but the body
abode therein without hurt About the year of our lord two honderd / lxxvii /
And all the people were replenysshed with right sweet odoure And a vois was
herd / which said / Come to me my friend / And enter in to the joy of thy
lord / And many of the people saw the heaven open /

Thus ends the life of saint Theodore
Here follows the life of saint Martyn And first of his name
MArtyn is as much to say as holdyng / Mart that is the god of bataill
against vices and sins / Or Martyn is said as one of the martyrs / for he was
a martyr by his will / and by mortyfyenge of his flesh Or Martyn is expowned
thus / as despysynge / provoking / or seygnoryenge / He despised the deuylle
his enemy / He provoked the name of our lord to mercy / And he seygnoryed over
his flesh / by contynuelle abstynence in making it lene / over which
flesh / reason or courage should domyne / as saint Denis says in an epistle
to Demophyle / like as a lord domyneth over his servant or a fader his sone /
or an old man a young wanton / so should reason domyne the flesh / Seuerus
which otherwise was called Sulpicius / disciple of saint Martyn wrote his life
/ which Seuerus Genandius remembers / and nombreth among the noble men /

Of saint Martyn
MArtyne was borne in the castelle of Sabarye in the town of Pauonye / but he
was nourysshed in ytaly at pauye with his fader / which was master and
trybune of the knights under Constancyen and Iulyane Cezar / And Martyn rode
with him / but not with his will / For fro his young Infancye he was enspyred
deuynely of god / And when he was twelve year old / he fled to the Church
ayenste the will of all his kynne / And required to be made new in the
faith / And fro thens he would have entryd in to deserte / if Infyrmyte of
maladye had not let him / And as themperours had ordained / that the sons
of Ancient knights should ride instead of their faders / And Martyn which
was fyften year old was commanded to do the same / and was maad knight / and
was content with one servant / And yet oftymes Martyn would serve him / and
draw of his botee / In a winter time as Martyn passed by the yate of Amyens he
met a pour man al naked / to whom no man gaf any alms / Then Martyn
drew out his swerd / And carf his mantell therewith in two pyeces in the
myddel / And gaf that one half to the pour man / For he had nothing else to
give to him / And he clad him self with that other half / The next night
following / he saw our lord Ihesu crist in heaven clothed with that part /
that he had given to the pour man And said to the Angels that were about
him / Martyn yet new in the faith has couerd me with this vesture / Of which
thing this holy man was not enhaunced in vain glory / But he knew there by
the bounte of god / And when he was eyghten year of age / he did do baptyse
him self / And promised / that he should renounce the dygnyte to be the Judge of
the knights / and also the world / if his time of his prouostye were
accomplisshyd / Then held he yet chyualry two year / And in the mean while /
the barbaryns entered among the frenshe men And Iulyan caesar / which should
have foughten ageynste them / gaf great money unto the knights / And Martyn
willing no more to fight reffused his yefte / but said to cezar / I am a
knight of Ihesu crist / It apperteyneth not to me for to fight / Then Iulyan
was wroth / and said / that it was not for the grace of Relygyon / that he
renounced chyualrye / but for fere and dread of the present bataylle following /
To whom Martyn not being aferd said to him / by cause that thou hold it for
cowardyse / and that I have not do it for good faith / I shall be to morn
all unarmed to fore the bataylle / And shall be protected and kept by the
sign of the cross / and not by shield ne by helm / And shall pass thorugh
the bataylles of the enemies surely / And then he was commanded to be kept
/ For to be on the morn all unarmed against thenemyes But on the morn
thenemyes sent messagers / that they would yield them and their goods / whereof
hit is no doubt / but that by the merytes of this holy man / that this
vyctorye was had without shedynge of blood / And then forthon he left
chyualry And went to saint Hyllarye bishop of poytyers / And he made him
acolyte And he was warned of our lord in his sleep / that he should yet vysyte
his fader and mother / which yet were paynyms / And also that he should suffer
many tribulacions / For as he went over the montaynes / he fell among theuys
/ And when one of the thieves had lift up an axe for to have smeton him in
the head / he bare the stroke with his right hand / And then that other
took his hands and bond them behind him at his back / and delyuerd him to
another to hold him / And hit was axyd of him if he were aferd or doubted / To
whom Martyn answered / that he was never to fore so sure / For he knew well
that the mercy of god was ready and would come in temptacions / And then began
to preche to the thief / and conuertid him to the faith of Ihesu crist / And
then the thief brought martyn forth on his way / and after lived a good life
/ and when he was passid Melane / the deuylle appieryd to him in a man's
lykenes / and demanded him whyder he went / and he said thither / where as
our lord would that he should go / and the devil said to him / where someuer
thou ghost the devil shall alwey be against the / and martyn ansuerd to him /
our lord is mine helper / and therefore I doubt nothing that may be done to me /
and then anon the fend vanisshed awey / then he went home / and converted
his mother / but his fader abode stylle in his error / and when theresye
aryenne grew in the world he was beten openly and put out of ye cite and came
to Melane and did do make there a monastery but he was cast out of tha^ ryens /
and went with one priest only in to the isle of galmarye / And there took for
his mete herbs / and among other he took an herb enuenymed / which was named
Hereborus / And when he felt that he should deye / and was in parylle / he
chaced awey the pain and peril / of the venym by the virtue of prayer / And
then he herd / that the blessed Hyllarye returned fro his exyle / And went
to mete him / And ordained a Monasterye by poityers / And there was renewed in
the faith / which he had in keeping / And when he went a little out /
and came ageyn he fond him deed without baptysme / And then he went in to
his celle / And brought the corpse thither / And there knelyd by the corpse / and
by his orysons / he remysed him in his life again / And as the same reherceth
often that when the sentence was given / against him / And was put in a
derke place / And two Angels said to the Judge / this is he / for whom Martyn
is pledge / And then he commanded / that he should be remoeued unto his body /
and so was yolden alive to Martyn / And also he restablysshed the life to
another that was hanged / And trewly when the people of Tours had no Bishop /
they required strongly him to be their Bishop / And he reffused hit / But
there was one / which was to him contrary / by cause he was of vile habyte /
and despysable of chere And one there was among the other / which was named
defensor / And when the lector was not present / an other took the psaultyer
/ and read the first psalm that he fond / in which psalm was wreton this
verse / Ex ore infancium / God thou have performed the laud by the mouth of
children and young soukers / And for thine enemies thou shall dostroye thenemye
defensour / And thus that defensour was chaced out of the Town by all the
people / And then he was ordained bishop / And by cause he might not suffer
the tumulte / ne noise of the peuple / he establysshed a monasterye a two lekes
fro the Cite and there lived in great abstynence with four score disciples of
whom diverse cytees chosen of them to be their bisshops / And there was a Corpse
in a chapelle which was worshipped as a martyr / And saint Martyn couthe find
no thing of his life / ne of his merytees / He came on a day. on the sepulcre
of him / and prayed unto our lord / that he would show to him what he was / and
of what merit / And then he turned him on the lift side / And saw there a
right obscure and derke shadow / Then Saint Martyn coniured him / and
demanded him what he was / And he said to him / that he was a thief / And that
for his wickedness was slain / Anon then Saint Martyn commanded / that
the altar should be destroyed / It is read in the Dyalogue of Severe and Galle
/ disciples of saint Martyn / that there ben many things left out in the
life of saint Martyn / which ben accomplisshed in the said Dyalogue / So on a
time saint Martyn went to Valentynyen the emperor for a certain necessyte And
the Emperor knew well / that he would require such thing / as he would not
give to him / And Martyn came twyes to have entryd / but he might not enter /
Then he wrapped him in hayer / and cast ashes on him / and maade his
flesh lene al an hole weke by fastings / and did great abstynence / And
then the Angel warned him to go to the palais / And noman should gayn say
him / And then he went to the Emperor / And when he saw him / he was
angry / by cause he was let come in / And would not arise ageynste him / tylle
that the fire entrid in his chamber / and felt the fire behind him / Then
he aroos all angry And confessyd / that he had felt the virtue dyuyne / And
began tembrace saint Martyn / and granted to him all that he desired / and
offryd to him many yeftes / but he reffused / and took none /

And in this Dyalogue hit is read / how he raised the thyrdde deed person For
when a Iongelynge was deed / his mother prayde saint Martyn with weeping teres
/ for to reyse him to the pour man / And commanded / that he should go his
way anon / And when the Archedeken warned him to goo do the seruyse /
Martyn said that he might not goo tylle the pour man were clothed / and mente
him self / but he understand him not / For he saw him clothed / and couerd
with his cope / and wist not that he was naked under / And therefore he rought
not of the pour man / And then he said to him / why bring ye nothing for
ye pour man / bring ye me then a vesture / and let me be clothed for the
pour man / And then he being constrained went to the market / And bought a
vile cote and a short for v / pens / which was naught worth / And came / and
angrely threw it down at his feet / And saint Martyn took hit up / and
cladde him with all secretly And the sleues came to his elbowes / And the
length was but to his knees / And so went to sing the mass / And as he
sange mass / a great light of fire descended upon his heed / and was seen of
many that were there / And therefore he is said like and egalle to thappostles /
And to this miracle adds Master Johan Beleth / that when he lift up his
hands at the mass / as hit is of customme / the sleues of thaube slode down
unto his elbowes / For his arms were not great ne flesshely / and the sleuys
of his cote came but to his elbowes / so that his arms abode al naked / Then
were brought to him by miracle sleues of gold / and full of precious stones of
Angels / which couerd his arms couenably / He saw on a time a sheep shorn /
and said / this has acomplisshed the commandment of the gospel / For he
had two cotes / and has given to him that had none / and thus said he ye ought
to do / he was of great power to chase awey the deuyls / For he put them out
oftymes fro diverse people / It is read in the same dyalogue / that a Cow was
tormentid of the deuylle / and was wood / And confounded much people / And as
saint Martyn and his felauship should make a vyage / this wode Cow ran
against them / And saint Martyn lift up his hand / and commanded her to tarry
/ And she abode stylle without moeuynge / Then saint martyn saw the deuylle
/ which satte upon the back of the cow / and blamed him / and said to him /
Depart thou fro this mortal be / and leave to tormente this be that
noyeth no thing / And anon he departed / And the cow kneled down to the feet
of this holy man / And at his commandment she returned to her company full
mekely /

He was of much great subtylyte for to know the deuylles / they could not be
hid fro him / For in what place they put them self in / he saw them / For
sometime they showed them to him in the form of Iupyter / or of Mercurye / And
otherwhyle they transfygured them in lykenes of venus or of my nerve / whom
eueryche he knew / and blamed them by name /

It happed on a day / that the deuylle appierid to him in the form of a king
in purpre / and a crown on his head with hosen / and shone gylte / with an
amyable mouth / and glad there and vysage / And when they were both
stylle a while / the deuylle said / Martyn / know thou whom thou worshippest
/ I am Crist / that came descended in to earth / And will first show me to the
/ And as saint Martyn all admerueyled said no thing / yet the deuylle said to
him / wherefore doubtest thou Martyn to bileue me / when thou see that I am
Christ / And then Martyn blessed of the holy ghoost said / Our lord Ihesu
Criste says not / that he shall come in purpre / ne with a Crown
resplendysshynge / I shall never believe that Ihesu Christ shall come / but if
hit be in habyte and form such as he suffryd death in / And that the sign of
the Cross be borne to fore him. And with that word / he vanysshed aweye / and
all the halle was was filled with stenche /

Saint Martyn knew his death long time to fore his departing / the which he
showed to his brethren / And whiles he vysyted the dyocise of ^^ul for cause
to appease discord yt was was there / And as he went / he saw in a water
birds that plonged in the water / which awayted and espied fysshes / and ete
them / And then he said / In this manner deuylles espy foles / they espy
them / that be not ware / they take them that know not / but ben ignorant /
and devour them that been taken / And they may not be fulfilled ne saciate with
them that they devour / And then he commanded them to leave the water / and
that they should goo in to deserte Countrees / And they assembled them / and
went unto the wodes and montaynes / And then he abode a little in that
dyocyse / and began to wexe feeble in his body / and said to his disciples /
that he should depart and be dissolved / Then they all weeping said / Fader
/ wherefore leuest thou us / or to whom shall thou leave us all desolate / and
discomforted / The rauysshynge wulues shall assaylle thy flock / and beestes /
And he then moeued with their wepynges wept also / and prayed saying / Lord
if I be yet necessary to thy peuple / I refuse nothing the labor / thy will
be fulfilled / He doubted what he might lest do / For he would not gladly
leave them / ne he would not long be departed fro Ihesu Christ / And when he
had a little while ben tormentid with the Fevers / And his disciples prayde him
/ where as he lay in the asshen dust and hair / that they might lay some
straw in his cowche where he lay / he said / It apperteyneth not / but that
a Christian man should deye in hair and in ashes / And if I should give to you
another ensample / I my self should sin / And he had his hands and his eyes
toward the heuene / And his spyrit was not losed fro prayer / And as he lay
toward his brethren / he prayed that they would remeue a ly^ell his body / And
he said / Brethren / late me behold more the heuene / than the earth so
that the esperyte may adresse him to our lord / And this saying / he saw
the deuylle that was there / And saint Martyn said to him / wherefore stand
thou here thou cruel be / thou shalt find in me no^hynge synfulle ne
mortalle / the bosom of Abraham shall receive me / And with this word he
rendryd / and gaf up unto our lord his spyrite in the year of our lord three
honderd / Four score / and lviij / And the year of his life four score and one
/ And his chere shone as it had been gloryfyed / And the voys of Angels was
herd singing of many that were there And they of poytyers assembled at his
death / as well as they of Tours / and there was great altercacion / For the
poyteuyns said / he is our Monk / we require to have him / And the other
said / He was taken from you / and given to us / And at mydnyght all the
poyteuyns slepte / And they of Tours put him out of the wyndowe / and was
borne with great joy / and had over the water of leyre by a boat unto the Cite
of Tours / And as Sever Bishop of Coleyne on a sunday after matyns vysyted and
went about the holy places the same hour that saint Martyn departed out of
this world / he herd the Angels singing in heaven / Then he called his
Archedeken / and demanded him if he herd any thing / And he said nay / And
the Bishop badde him to herkene dilygently / And he began to stratche forth
his neck / and adresse his eres / and lent upon his staf / Then the Bishop
put him self to prayer for him / Then he said / that he herd voices in
heuene / To whom the Bishop said / It is my lord saint Martyn which is
departed out of this world / And the Angels bear him now in to heuene / And
the deuyls were at his passing / but they fond nothing in him / And went
awey all confused / And the archedeken marked the day and the hour / and
knew verily after that saint Martyn passyd out of this world that same time /
And Severe the Monk which wrote his life / as he slepte a lytelle after matyns
/ like as he wytnessyth in his Epistle / Saint Martyn appiered to him cladde in
an aulbe / His chere clear / the eyes sparklynge / his here purple / holding
a book in his right hand / which the said Severe had wr^ton of his life /
and when he had given him his blessing / he saw him mount up in to heaven /
And as he coueyted for to have gone with him / he awoke / And anon the
Messagers came which said that that same time saint Martyn departed out of
this world And in the same day saint Ambrose / Bishop of Melane sange mass /
and slepte upon the altar between the lesson of the prophecye / and the
epistle / And none durst wake him / And the subdeken durst not read the pystle
with out his leave / And when he had slepte the space of three hours / they
awoke him / and said / Sire the hour is passyd / And the people ben weary for
tabyde / wherefore command / that the Clerk read the pystle / And he said to
them / be not angry / Martyn my brother is passid unto god / and I have done the
office of his departing and buryeng / and I could no sonner accomplysshe ne
make an end of the last oryson / by cause ye hasted me so sore / Then they
marked the day and the hour / and they fond / that saint Martyn was then
passyd out of this world / and gone to heaven / Master Johan Beleth says that
kyngis of France were woned to bear his cope in bataylle / And by cause they
kept this cope / they were called chappellayns / And after his death the year
three score and four / when saint perpetue had enlarged his church / And
would transporte the body of saint Martyn therein / they were in fastings and
vygylles ones / twyes / thryes And they might not moeue the sepulcre / And as
they would have lift hit a right fair old man appiered to them and said /
wherefore tarry ye / See ye not that saint Martyn is all ready to help you / if
ye set to your hands with him / And then anon they lift up the sepulcre
/ and brought hit to the place / where as he is now worshipped / And then
anon this old man vanysshed aweye / This translacion was made in the monethe
of Iuyllet / And hit is said / that there were then two felawes / one lame /
and that other was blind / The lame taught the blind man the weye / And the
blind bare the lame man / And thus gate they much money by truaundyse / and
they herd say that many seek men were heled / when the body of saint Martyn
was borne out of the Church on procession / And they were aferd / lest the
body should be brought to fore their hows / and that peradventure they might be
heled / which in no wise they would not be / For if they were heled / they
should not get so much money by truaundyse as they did / And therefore they
fled fro that place / and went to another church / where as they supposed
that the body should not come / And as they fled / they encountered / and met
the holy body suddenly vnpourueyed / and by cause god gives many bienfaittes to
men not desired / and that would not have them / they were both heled / against
their will / and were right sorry therefore / And saint Ambrose says thus of
saint Martyn / He destroyed the Temples of the cursyd error / he raised the
baners of pity / he raised deed men / he cast deuylles out of bodies / in
which they were / And alleged by remedy of health them that trauaylled in
diverse maladyes and sekenesses / And he was founded so parfyghte / that he
cladde Ihesu Christ instead of a pour man / And the vesture that the pour man
had taken / the lord of all the world cladde him with all / That was a good
largess / that dyuynyte couerd / O glorious vesture and in^stymable yeft yt
clothed and couerd both ye knyt and the king / This was a yefte / that no man
may preyse of which he deseruyd to clothe the deyte / lord / thou gave to
him worthily the reward of thy confession / thou put under him worthily the
cruelte of tharryens / And he worthily for the love of martyrdom / never
dredde the torments of the persecutours / what shall he receive for the
oblacion of his body / that for the quantite of a little vesture which was but
half a mantelle / deseruyd to clothe and couere god and also to see him / And
gaf so great medicyne to them that trusted in god / that some he helyd by his
prayers / and other by his commandments / Then late us pray to saint
Martyn et cetera /

Thus ends the life of saint Martyn
Here follows the life of saint Bryce And first of his name
BRyce is said of Breos / that is to say in Greek as mesure / and of scio scis
/ that is to know / And thus thexposicion of this name Brictius or Bryce is as
much to say as knowing mesure / For at beginning of his enfancye when he
was young / he was full of many sottyes and folyes / but he could well after
the mesure of him self demand and counceylle / and govern well other / and to
excuse him self by mesure /

Of saint Bryce
BRyce was Archedeken of saint Martyn / and was much grievous to him / and
said of him many things unreasonable / And on a time a pour man came to Bryce
/ and demanded of him where the Bishop was / And how he should know him / And
he bad him goo in to the Church / and him that ^how shall there see lokyng
upward to heaven as a mad man or one fro him self / that same is Martyn / And
the pour man went and fond saint martyn / And when he had received that
he asked / saint Martyn called saint Bryce and said to him / Bryce seems it to
the that I am a fool or frantyke / And he forsook hit / and denied it for shame
/ And said / he had not said so / And saint Martyn said / I have herd it / For
mine eres were at thy mouth / when thou saydest hit to the pour man openly /
I tell and say to the forsothe / that I have obtained and have grant of god
/ that thou shalt su^cede me in this Bisshopryche / But know thou for certain
that thou shall suffer therynne many aduersytees / And when Bryce herd him
say so he scorned him saying / Said I not true when I said / he was a fool
/ And after the death of saint Martyn Bryce was elect and made Bishop of Tours
/ which fro then forthon he intended all to prayer / and how be it that he
had been proud / yet he was always chaste / And in the thyrttyest year of his
bisshopryche / a woman which was relygyously clad / which was his lauender /
and had wasshen his clothes / had conceived and born a child / which all the
people said yt the bishop had gotten / and they assembled at his yates with
stones / and sayden / we have long suffrid thy lecherye for the love of saint
Martyn / and for his pity / But now we will no more kiss thy hands / which
ben acursed / but he denied the fait and deed manly / And said / bring to me
the Child / And when he was brought he was but thyrtty days old / And saint
Bryce said to him / I conjure the by the sone of god that thou say to me to
fore all this people / if I have engendryd the / And the child said / thou art
not my fader / And the peuple yet not content badde him to demand the Child.
who was his fader / And he said / that apperteyneth not to me to do / I have
done that apperteyneth to me for mine excuse / And the people said / that this
was done by the art of enchauntement / and said plainly / he should not
seignorye over us thus falsely / under the shadow of a pastor / And then
yet for to purge him / he bare in his lap or his vestymente coals al
brennynge / unto the Tomb of saint Martyn / And his vestymente never brenned
ne had none harm / And then he said / like as my vestymente is unhurt and
not burnt of these coals / but is hole and not corrupt of the fire / in like
wise is my body clean of touching of any woman / And yet the people byleued him
not but beat him / and did to him many Iniuryes / And put him out of the
bisshopryche / by cause the word of saint Martyn should be accomplysshed And
then saint Bryce went his way weeping / and came to the (...) and abode there
seven year

And purged him / of that he had trespaced to saint Martyn / And the people made
a new Bishop / named Iustynyen / And sent him to Rome / for to deffende the
cause against Bryce / And he went thyderward he deyde in the Cite of
Vercellence / Then the people made one Armenon Bishop in his stead / And in
the seuenthe year returned with auctoryte of the (...) / and took his lodging
six mile without the cite / And that same night Armenon the Bishop deyde /
And Bryce knew hit by dyuyne teuelacion / and said to his people / that they
should arise and haste them for to goo / and burye the Bishop of Tours / which
was deed / And as Bryce entryd at one yate the deed Bishop was brought in at
another yate / And when he was buried / saint Bryce took his see / or syege /
And was Bishop after that seven year / and led an holy / and laudable life /
And in the seven and fourthyeste year of his Bisshopryche he passyd unto our
lord / to whom be given lawde and glory / Amen

Thus ends the life of saint Bryce

THere was a merueyllous holy woman in the Cite of Assyse / which was named
Clare / First ye shall understand / that her natyuyte was much worthy / and
noble / It is read that as touching the world she was of right noble lygnage
/ and as touching the spyryte to the regard of the state of virtues / and

heart and her body / And to this he enjoined her / that on palmesonday she
should halowe the feste with the other peuple / but the night following in
remembrance of the passion of Ihesu christ / she should torn her joy in to
weeping / and afflictions / For in such wise to weep the passion of Ihesu

And there her here was cut of / And after they ladde her in to an Abbay of
nonnes / And there left her / Fyftly how her friends despised this work
ordained by our lord / It is read when this lady was thus ordained / she
labored and did so much that she drew her suster named Agnes in to her
company / wherefore as well for that one as for that other / the carnalle friends
of saint Clare had her in indignacion out of mesure / wherefore saint Fraunceys
translated them in to the church of saint Damyan / which church by the
commandment of the crucyfixe he had repaired / And there this lady began

/ and with great pain if it had not be for thobedyence of saint Fraunceis /
she had never received the soueraynte of them / And after that she had
received the domynacion over them / and governance / she was to fore all
other ready to serve them that were seek / as she had been an handmayde or
servant / And was so humble / that she would wasshe the feet of her handmaydens
and servants when they came from without fro their work / and dreyde them
and kissed them / Seventhly / how Saint clare kept pouerte / It is read that

fedynge and clothing / ne would have none other / And notwithstondynge that she
was assoylled of ye pope of the vow of pouerte / And thereupon had received

well be assoylled of my sins / but the vow of pouerte I shall keep unto the
death / The eight How in necessite Ihesu criste vysyted her / It is read that
on a time at the hour of dinner in the college of saint Clare was but one loof
of bread / nether myt no more be had / then saint Clare took this loof of
the hand of the dispenser / and made then her prayer / And after of that loof
made as many loves and parties / as there were susters / And as soon as
eueryche had received her part / how well hit was but little / the dyuyne grace
multyplyed it so much / that eueryche left sum and had enough / Item
semblably it is read / that god did for her / when in her college the
pottes were faylled / Nynthly / how in straytnes saint Clare was ruled / This
holy lady was content with one pour cote lyned with a mantelet / She used
never pendauntes ne furs of skynnes / but dispendyd all her time in keeping
her body in seruage of the spyryte / And here with thryes in the weke she
fasted in this manner / that she never tasted thing that was soden / Item
every year she fasted two lentens to bread and water only / sauf the sunday she
took a little wyn / And shortly she lived so straytly / that she becam so
feeble / that saint Frau^ceis commanded her by virtue of obedyence / that she
should faylle no day / but that she should take for her refection an ounce / and
an half of bread / She was never without heyr next her flesh / And for a
pelowe she took a block or a great stone / She lay alwey on the bare ground /
Or for to take the better her rest she lay otherwhyle up on the cuttynge of

that oftymes the fend apperyd to her by night saying / if so be that ye
absteyne you not fro wakyng and weeping / ye shall for certain be blind / And
she ansuerde / he shall not be blind that shall see our lord in his glory /
And when the fend herd this answer / anon he departed all confused / ne
durst never after tempte her / ne let her of her prayers / Enleuenthly / god
of his grace had perced her heart / It is read that saint Clare for to
dispende amerously the time that god had lent her / In especyalle she was
determined / that fro the hour of mydday unto euensong time / she would

and say prayers and orysons acordynge thereto / After unto the five wounds of
the precious body of Ihesu Christ / as smeton and persed to the heart with the
darte of the love divine / It is read that fro the time on a sherthursdaye the
hour of the maundye unto ester even the satyrday she was remembrynge and
thynkyng on the suffraunce of our lord Ihesus so brennyngly / that she was
rauysshed as all dronken in the love of god / that she knew not what was said
ne done about her / but as vnmeuable or as all insensible / in stondynge she
held her eyes fixed in one place / Twelftly / how in her disease and pain she
was of god comforted / It is said / that she was by the space of eight and
twenty days in contynuelle langoure and sekenes / Nevertheless was never seen
in her sign of vnpacyence / but alwey sweet words / and amyable in preysyng
and thankyng god of all / and in especial hit is read that in the sekenes /

mete or drink And nevertheless she was so swetely vysited of god / that it
seemed unto all them that saw her / that she had no pain ne disease / but
yet more every creature that come to her was comforted in god / And in especial
it is read / that when the hour of death approached / she which long time
had lost her speche^ began to speak and say / goo out surely / thou have a
good saufconduyte / And when one of her sustrrs being there present herd
that / she demanded her to whom she spack / And she answered to my soul /
whom I see abasshid to deporte fro my body / for he ought not for to doubt /
For I see the holy vyrgyne Marye which abides for me / And this said Our
blessed lady entrid in to the chamber where saint Clare lay / And she was
crowned with a crown right clear shynyng / that thobscurite of the nyt was
changed in to clerenes of mydday / And she brought with her a right great
multitude of other vyrgyns all nobly crowned / among whom there was one /
that bare a rich mantelle / To whom she said give hyder the ma^tell / And
when she had swetely embracyd her / she cladde her with the mantell / And
at that same time was weeping about her the college of susters / And in
especial Agnes the suster of saint Clare making great moan and sorrow /
Then saint Clare said swetely / My susters / discomforte you not / For ye
shall have unto god of me a good and a true Advocate / And thou Agnes shall
soon after follow me in to glory / Now is it well reason and right / that we
say and show of the great meruaylles / that god showed for saint Clare by her
holy prayers / For she was verytable / true and worthy of all honor That
great tempest that was in the time of Frederyck the emperor / whereof holy Church had so much to suffer / that in diverse parties of the world was
much war / so that by the commandment of the emperor were bataylles
establysshed of knights / And with that so many Archers of Sarasyns / as they
had be hills of flies for to destroy the people / Chastellis and Cytees /
The Sarasyns ran as woodmen tylle they came to the yates of Assyse / And the
felon sarasyns that been full of all cruelte and falshede / And seek nothing /
but for to flee and destroy Christian men's blood / And they came unto the
Cloystre of the pour ladies of saint Damyen / And the holy ladies had so great
fere that their hertes malte in their bodies / and run weeping to their mother
saint Clare / And she that was seek without fere / of heart made her to be
ladde to fore her enemies unto the door / And did do bear to fore the body of
our lord / you which was in a pixe much rychely garnysshed and deuoutely / And
this holy lady was on her knees saying with weeping treres unto our lord /
Hafayr lord god plese hit you then / that they that serve you / and ben
disarmed / whom I nourisshe for your love be brought in to the hands and
power of the paynyms / Fair swet lord / I byseche the / that thou kee thy
handmaydens and servants / For I may not keep them in this point / and our
lord anon sent of his special grace a vois / as it had been a child / which
said to her / I shall keep you alweye O sweet fair lord keep this cite if it
please you / which has given to us such things / as has been nedefulle to
us for the love of you / And he answered the cite shall have sum greuaunce /
but nevertheless I shall keep and defend hit / Then this holy vyrgyne saint
Clare aroos fro her prayer which had yet her vysage al bewept and comforted
much swetely her susters that wept / and said to them / I command you fair
daughters / that ye comfort you in good faith / and trust ye only in our
lord / For the sarasyns shall never do you harm / Anon then the Sarasyns
had so great dread and fere that over the wallys / and by tho places that
they had entryd / they fled hastily / And were in this wise by the oryson
and prayer / of saint Clare destroubled / and put fro their empryse / Then
commanded she to all them / that herd the vois that that in no manner they
should discouere ne tell it to any that lived / On another time it happed /
that an old squire full of vain glory / the which was much hardy in bataylle
/ and was captain of a great host which Frederick had delyuerd to him /
and came with all his host for to take the cite of Assyse / he did do hew
done the trees / and destroy the countreye al about / and besyeged the cite
/ And swear / that he would not depart thens till he had taken the Cite / And
thus was the cite besyeged for to have be taken / And when saint Clare the
handmaide of Ihesu crist herd the tydyng she had great pity / and did do
call her susters / and said to them / Right sweet daughters / we receive
daily many bienfaites of this Cite / and it should be a great unkindness to us
/ if we socoured it not in this great need / as much as we may / Then
commanded she to bring ashes / and said to her sustres that they should
discouere their hedes / and she her self first cast great plente of Ashes
upon her head / and after upon the hedes of all the other / and said to them /
Now go fair douters / And with all your heart require and pray ye to our lord
/ that he will deliver this Cite / And then euerich by hem self in great
wepynges and terys made their orysons and prayers deuoutely to our lord in
such wise / that he kept and defended the Cite / that on the morn the host
departed out of the country / And it was not long after that they all were
deed and slain It should not be acordynge / that we should hele and keep secret
the merueylous virtue of her prayer / the which at beginning of her
conuersyon / she converted a soul to god / For she had a suster yongir than
her self was whose conversation she much desired / And in all her prayers that
she made / she prayed at the beginning with all her heart to our lord / that
like as she and her suster had been in the world of one heart and of one will
/ that it might please the fader of mercy / that Agnes her suster whom she had
left in the world / might despise the world and sauoure the sweetness of god
/ so that she might have no will to marye her sauf only to god her true
friend / in such wise that between them both / they might espouse their
virginyte to our lord / These two susters loved merueylously to gyder / And
were much soroufulle of their departing / and that one more than that other /
But our lord granted unto saint Clare the first ye^t that she demanded /
For hit was a thing / that much plesyd him After the seuenthe day / that
saint Clare was conuertid Agnes her suster came to her / And discovered her
secretenesse to her and will / And said utterly / that she would serve god /
And when Saint Clare herd that / anon she embraced her / And said for joy
that she had / My suster ye be right welcome / I thank god that has herd me
for the / For whom I was in great sorrow How be hit that this conversion was
merueyllous / And yet more to be wondered / how Clare deffended her suster by
her prayers / At that time were the good blessed susters at saint Mychell of
pambo / which were joined to god / and they followed the life and works of
ihesu christ / And there was saint Clare which felt more of god than the other
/ And she informed her suster her nouryce how she should rewle her / And the
parents and kynnesmen of saint clare began a new battle / and stryf against
the vyrgyns / For when they herd say / that Agnes was gone to duelle with
her suster saint clare / there came on the morn to the place where saint
clare dwelled twelve of her kynnesmen and Friends al fro them self all araged
/ and showed not without forth the malice that they had in their heart but gaf
them to understand / that they came for good / And when they came within /
they made no force of saint clare for to draw her out / For they knew well /
that they should no thing exployte of their entente / but they turned to Agnes /
and said to her / What make thou here / come out with us home to thy hows /
and she answered / that she would never depart fro the company of saint clare
/ And a tyrant a knyt took and drew her by the here / And the other took her
by the arms / and caryen her forth a far / And she which seemed that she was
among the hondes of a lion / and taken fro the hands of god / began to cry
and said / Fair dear suster help me / and suffer not that I be taken aweye
fro the holy company of Ihesu crist / But the felons drew this vyrgyn against
her will over the Montayne / and rent her clothes / and drew and raced out
her here / And the holy sweet vyrgyne saint clare kneled down / and put her
self to prayer / And praid our lord to give her suster a strong heart and a
stable / and that she might by the puyssaunce of god overcome and surmounte
the puyssaunce of the people / and anon the holy ghost made her so peysaunt
and heavy / that it seemed that her body were fyxed to the ground / in such
wise / that for all the force and power that they couthe (...) they might not
bear her over a lytelle broke / And the men that were in the feldes and river
came for to help them but they might nuer remeue her fro the earth / And
then one of them said in mockyng / It is no wonder though she be heavy / For
she has eten much led / Then the lord mouualt her uncle lift up his arm
for to beat her cruelly but an ache and pain took him suddenly / and tormentid
him a long time right cruelly / After that this said Agnes had suffered this
long wrastlyng of her kynnesmen and Friends / came saint Clare / and prayed them
for gods sake / they should leave this bataylle with her suster / and go their
way / and take heed of them self And she received the cure and charge of Agnes
her suster / which lay thereon the ground in great disease / And finally her
kynnesmen departed in great anguysshe an and sorrow of heart / And then anon
after she aroos up much gladly / And had much great joy of that first
bataylle / that she had suffered for the love of Ihesu Christ / And fro this time
forward / she ordained her self to serve god perdurably / And saint Fraunceis
cut of her here is with his own hands / and enduced / and taught her to serve
god / and so did saint Clare her suster / And by cause we may not shortly
acompte with few words / the great perfection of the life / of Agnes /
therefore we shall entende unto the life of saint Clare the vyrgyne / Was hit
not great meruaylle of the orysons and prayers of saint Clare / which were so
strong and so much auaylleth against the malice of the people / when they
fled / and were puissaunt to brenne the deuyls / It happed on a time / that a
much devout woman of the bisshopryche of Pyse came to one of the ladies / for
to yield thankynges to god / and saint Clare / which had delyuerd her fro
thandes of / v / deuyls / For they fled and waylled that the orysons of saint
Clare burnt them all / And therefore they might no longer dwell in that
place / The pope gregory had much great faith and great devotion in the
prayers of yt holy virgin / And not without cause / For he had preued and
felt certain virtue thereof / which had helped many and dyuerce / that had
necessyte and need / And when he was Bishop of hostence / and after when
he was pope / he sent his lettres to her / by which he required her to pray
for him / And anon he felt him eased / and alleged by her prayers / Then
certainly if he which was vycayre of Ihesu Christ by his humylyte as we may see
had so great devotion to saint Clare / of whom he required her aid / and
recommaunded him to the virtue of her orysons / well ought we then tensiewe
with all our power the devotion of such a man / For he knew well / how much
love is mighty / and how the pure vyrgyns have delyuerd entree in to the door
of the heart of our lord / And if our sweet lord give him self to them / that
love him fermely / who may he deny them / for whom they require him
deuoutely / Alwey seen / that they require him / that is need and behoeffull /
The holy werk shows well the great faith / and the great devotion that she
had in the holy sacrament of the altar / For in that great maladye which had
so vexed her that she lay in her bed / she aroos / and did her to be borne
from one place to another / and did spynne a fyn small clothe / of which she
made mo than fyfty corporas / and sent them in fair towellis of sylke in to
dyuerce chirches in diverse places of Assyse / When she should receive the body
of our lord / it was meruaylle to see the teres that she Wept / of which she
was all wete / And she had so great fere when she approchyd nyghe unto her
saueour / that she ne doubted him no less which is in semblaunce very god in
the form of breed the sacrament / than him that governs heaven and earth /
which is al one / Thus as she had alwey souuenaunce and mind of Ihesu Christ
in her maladye / so god comforted her / and vysited her in her Infyrmyte and
languore In the hour of the natyuyte of Ihesu crist at cristemas / when the
angels and the world made feast and songen and enjoyed of litil Ihesus yt was
born / al ye pour ladies went to matyns in to their monastery / and left
allone their pour mother sore grieved in her maladye / Then she began to
think on litil Ihesus / and was sorouful that she might not be at the seruyse
and preyse our lord And said in syghynge Fair lord god / I wake here allone /
And anon she began to here the Freres that songen / and saint Fraunceis /
and herd well the Iubylacion / the psalmodye / and the great melodye of the
song / how be it / her bed was not so nygh / that the voys of a man ne of a
woman might not be herd / ne understand / if god did hit not by his curtosye
/ or if god / had not given to her above al nature of man force and power to
here hit / but this passyd all / For she was worthy to see in her oratorye the
joy of our lord On the morning when the ladies her doghters came to her /
she said to them / Blessed be our lord Ihesu Christ / For when ye left me /
he left me not truly / And I say to you / that I have herd this night all
the seruyse and solempnyte that has be done in the church by saint Fraunceis
thorugh the grace of Ihesu crist / At pains of her death / our lord
comforted her alwey / For she drew out of the holy wounds of Ihesu criste a
bytternesse / of which her heart / her will And her thought were full of
anguysshes merueyllously bitter / And often as she had be dronken of the
sorrow and teeres that she wept for the love of Ihesu Christ / For oftymes the
love of god / which she had emprynted in her heart within forth / she made
to appear by signs outeward / She enfourmed and taught the nouyces / and
admonested them / that they have in their mind the sorrow and pain of the
death of Ihesu crist / And that she said with her mouth / she did it in her
heart and gaf ensample / When she was secretly all one / to fore she might
say any thing / she was al bedewed with teres / She was most devout / and
had more fervor of devotion between vndern and none / than any other time / by
cause she would / that in the hour that Ihesu crist was crucyfyed in the altar
of the cross / that her heart should be sacrefyed to god our lord / On a time
hit happed at the hour of none / that she prayed to god in her celle / And the
deuylle gaf to her such a stroke under the ere that her eyes and her vysage
were al couerd with blood She had learned an oryson of the five wounds of
Ihesu christ / which she often recorded and remembered / by cause her heart and
thought were nourysshed therein / and might feel the delytes that been in Ihesu
Christ / She learned thoffice of the cross of saint Fraunceis / which loved her
truly / And she said it as gladly to her power as he did / She gyrd to her
flesh a cord / whereon were thyrten knottes / which were full of brochettes of
small nedles / and thereon small rings / And this did she in the remembrance
of the wounds of our lord / It happed on a time on the holy sherthursdaye /
which is the day when our lord made his maundy or souper / where as is
remembryd / how god louyd unto the end his disciples about the hour of even /
when god began the wrastlynge of his passion / Then saint Clare being
heavy and sorrowful / enclosed her in the chamber of her celle / And hit happed /
that she prayed god long / and was soroufull unto the death / and in that
sorrow and heaviness / she drew a fervent love full of desire / For she remembryd
how Ihesus in that hour was taken / estrayned / haled forth and mocked / in so
much that of this remembrance she was all dronken / and satte in her bed /
All that night was she so rauysshyd and on the morn that she wyste not where
her body was / The eyes of her head looked steadfastly in one place / without
meuynge or lokynge a side / And the eye of her heart was so fixed in Ihesu
Christ that she felt no thing One of her daughters more famylyer and secret
with her than other went often to her for to see her / and alwey she fond her
in one point / The night of the satirday this good devout daughter brought a
candell brennynge / and without speaking maade a sign to her blessed mother
Clare / that she should remember the commandments of saint Fraunceis / For he
had commanded that every day she should eye somewhat / Then as she stood
before her with a candell brennynge / Saint Clare came again to her astate /
And her seemed / that she was comen from an another world / And she sad Fair
daughter what need is of a candell / is it not yet day / And she answered /
Right dear fair mother / the night is passed / and the day is gone / and that
other night is comen / Fair daughter said saint Clare / This sleep that I have
made be blessed / For I have much desired it / And god has given hit to me /
but beware that thou say it never to creature as long as I live / When our
lord knew and apperceyued how well and how much this holy Clare louyd him /
And the right great love that she had to the very cross for the love of him /
he so enlumyned and pryueleged her in such manner / that she had power to
make tokenes and miracles by the Cross / For when she made the sign of the
very cross up on them that were seek / anon the maladye fled awey / and so
many miracles god showed for her / Of which I shall tell you sum / First
of a friar that was out of his wit / On a time it happed / that saint
Fraunceis sent to saint Clare a friar named steven / and was al mad fro him
self / that she should make upon him the sign of the Cross / For he knew well
/ that she was a woman of great perfection / And he honored her much for the
virtue that was in her / And she / that was obeyssaunt and good daughter of
obedyence / blessid the Friar by the commandment of saint Fraunsoys / and
made him to sleep a lytelle / And after she took him by the hond And he aroos
al hoole / and went to saint Fraunsois clean delyuerd of al his maladye /
This blessed saint Clare was a good maystresse and true for tenforme young
people / that knew but little of relygyon / And she was president and vpperyst
of the maidens of our lord / and informed them in good custommes / and taught
them right well to do penance / She nourysshed them by so great love / that
uneath any tongue may express / she taught them pryuely to flee ale noise of
the world / by cause they should join to our lord / And also she exhorted them
/ that they should put fro them all carnal affection and flesshely love of their
friends / And that they should not be over tender over them ne love them
ouermoche / ne howses / ne land / but make them strong to please and serve god
She counceylled them / and warned / that they should hate to do the will of the
body / And that the delytes and flesshely desyrs of the flesh / they should
with all their heart and good reason go there ageynste / she said to them the
fend of hell lies in a wait and leyeth his hokes and grynnes subtylly for
to take and bind the holy sowles / and yet they tempte more the good people /
than them of the world / She would that they should wake and labor with her
propre hands in such works as she had establisshed to them She would that
when they had done their bodyly trauaylle / they should goo to prayer / For
prayer is a thing that plesyth much god / And she would that in prayeng they
should rechauffe their bodies / and that they should leave and depresse neclygence
and al coldenesse of heart / and be kyndeled and lyghted in the holy love of
god / so that instead of coldenes they should be hot in devotion / In no
place / ne in no cloystre was scylence better kept ne holden / there was no
lauas in their speech / ne euylle / but they were sobre and so good / that
they showed well / that in their hertes was none evil / but al godenes / The
good maystresse saint Clare her self spack so lytil / that she restrained them
/ and thought merueyllously on their words / How be it that in her heart / ne
in her thought was but al holiness / This good lady pourueyed to her daughters /
the word of god by devout prechynges / And had so much joy and gladness
perfoundely in her heart in herynge the words of the holy predicacion that al
her delight was in our lord Ihesu Christ her espouse / For on a time as Friar
phelyp A dryen preached / a right fair child was to fore saint Clare / and
abode there a great part of the sermon / and beheld merueylously and
graciously saint Clare / whereof hit happed that he that was worthy to know
and see so hyhe things of saint Clare / received in that sight and beholdynge
so great a swetenes in his heart / and so great comfort / that it might not be
said / ne expressyd / And how be hit that she was not let^^ed / yet herd she
more gladly the sermons in latin tha^ in her vulgar tongue / She knew well that
with in the shelle was the kernel / she herd the sermons ententyuely / and
assaueured them more swetely / She could much well draw to her / that was
most profitable for her soul / And well knew she that it was no less
cunning to gadre fair flowers among the sharp thorns / than to ete the
fruit of a fair tree / that is to say / that she louyd better a rude sermon
well edyffyeng than a fair polysshed little prouffytynge / On a time hit
happed / that the pope gregory deffended / that no friar should go to the hows
of the ladies without his leave / And when the holy mother saint clare knew
that / she had much sorrow in her heart / by cause she saw well / that she
might not have that which was needful / which was the noreture of holy
scripture / And said to her susters with a soroufull heart Now forthon well may
the pope gregorye take fro us all the freres / when he has taken fro us
them that nourysshed our sowles with the word of god / And anon she sent
again all the Freres of her how^ to the maystre or mynystre / For she said /
she had nothing to do to have freres to get them bodyly bread / when they
failled them that nourysshed her and her susters with the word of god / Anon
as the pope gregory herd this tydynge / he repeled that / which he had
deffended / and set all at the will of god / This holy and good Abbess loved
not only the sowles of her good daughters but thought well in her heart oftymes
/ how she might serve their bodies most charitably For when it was right
cold / she couerd by night them that were feeble / And vysyted them much
swetely / And if she saw any trouble by any temptacion or any anger / which
happeth sometime / she would call them secretly / And comforted them all weeping
And other while she would fall down to the feet of her daughters / that were
mate and heavy / And knelyd to fore them / so that the swetenes and debonairte /
that the ladies saw in her good mother / that she alleged / and took awey their
sorrow / whereof the ladies her daughters couthe her much thank / And thus
learned they to do well by devotion / and to love their good mother more swetely
/ and followed by the ryt weye the works of their good Abbess / And they
meruaylled much of the great habondaunce of holiness that god had given to
his spouse / When she had been forty year in the state of right holy
pouerte / hit pleased to our lord to call her to be rewarded in heaven / and
sent to her a great maladye / and multyplyed her languoure and sekenes / She
had sometime done so sharp penance / that her body ne her flesh had no
strength / And at the last she was over seek / and much more than she was
wont to be / For as our lord had given to her in her health richesse of
merytes / of good virtues / and of good works / Right so would god enriche her
in her sekenes / to the end that she should suffer for him right great pain and
torments / For in suffrynge of sekenes is virtue parfyghte how / and in what
wise she was virtuous in her maladye / and parfyght ye may here / For how be
it that she had been eight and twenty year in langueur and maladye / yet never
she grutched ne murmured ne playned / but allewey said holy words / and
rendryd thankynges to our lord / how be it that she was merueylously agreued
and seek / so that it seemed that she hasted much to draw to her end / Hit
pleasyd nevertheless to our lord / that he respyted her fro the death / unto the
time / that her end might be honored and enhaunced her by the presence of the
pope and of the cardynals / to whom she was especial daughter / for when the
pope and the cardynals had abyden a great while at lions / Saint clare was
then merueyllously (...) by sekenes / so that her daughters had great
sorrow at their hertes / that them seemed that a glayue had per^^d them / or
that they have be ryuen with a swerd / But our lord showed anon a vysyon to one
his ha^dmayde / which dwelled at saint powles / For hit seemed to her that she
and her susters were at saint Damyans to fore saint clare which was right seek
/ And her seemed that this Clare lay in a much fair bed / and much precious
/ And her seemed that her daughters wept / when the soul should pass out of
the body / And anon she saw a right fair lady at the head of the bed / and
said to them that wept / Fair daughters weep no more for this lady shall
overcome all / And know ye / that she shall not deye / till that our lord
and his disciples shall come / And she shall not abide long after that the
pope and the Court of Rome shall come to perouse / And anon as the Bishop
of Hostence herd say / that this holy woman was seek / anon in great haste he
went to see and vysyte the spouse of Ihesu Christ / For he was her ghostely
fader / and had the cure of her soul / And nourysshed her with pure heart /
and pure will / For he had alweye deuoutely loved the holy vyrgyne / And
then he gaf to her in her maladye the body of our lord / For that is the very
fedyng of the soul / And he comforted the other daughters by his sermons and
holy words / Then the holy good mother weeping praid him much swetely that
he would take heed of her daughters there being / and of all the other / And
that for the love of our lord he would remember her / And above all other
things / she prayed him / that he would do so much that her pryuelege of
pouerte might be confermed of the pope and of the cardynals / And he that
loved verily her / and the relygyon / and that had alwey truly aided her /
promised that he should do and did hit / In the year after came the pope and
the cardynals to Assyse / for to see the departing of the holy vyrgyne / and to
put to effect the vysyon / that h^dde be seen and signefyed of her For the
pope is the hyhest man in earth under god / and that best represents the
person of Ihesu Christ / For like as our lord had his disciples which were
joined to him in earth / In like wise the pope has his cardynals / the which
ben joined to him in the holy church / Our lord god hasted him / as he that
knew the ferme purpos of his spouse saint Clare / And hasted for to honor
her and to set in the palais / of the king of paradys his pour pilgryme /
and the good lady also coueyted and wysshed with all her heart / that she
might be delyuerd of her mortal body / And that she might see in heaven Ihesu
christ / as she that had ensiewed him in therthe with all her heart in very
pouerte / Her members were bruised / and troubled by great sekenes that the body
might not endure / For it was over much enfebled / so that our lord called
her fro this world / and ordained for her health perdurable / Then pope
Innocent the fourth / and the cardynallis came with him for to vysyte
thandmayde of god / of whom he had better proved the holy life / than of any
woman that was in his time And therefore he knew certainly / that it was reason
that he should come and honor her with his presence / And when he came in to
the hows of the ladies / he went thither / where as this holy saint lay / And
took to her his hond for to kiss / And the pope which was curtois stood upon
a tree / and took to her his foot to kiss by great humylyte / And she took it
and kyssed it much swetely / and after enclyned her self to the pope much
humbly / and required him with a sweet chyere that he would assoille her of all
her sins To whom he said / would god / that we had no more need of
absolucion of sins that we have done / than ye have / And then he assoylled
her of all her sins and gaf to her largely his benediction And when they
were al departed / for as much as she had received that day by the hands of
the mynyster prouynciall the very body of our lord / She lift up her eyes to
our lord to heaven / and joined her hands to gyder / And said then / Ha my
right sweet and fair daughters / our lord Ihesu crist by his debonairte has
done to me so great good and given to me so great a yefte / that heaven ne
earth may not know / For I have received this day a much hyhe lord / and
also have seen his vycayre / The good daughters were about the bed / which
wept / and abode for the orphalyns / Whereof they had much great sorrow / in
their hertes / For the death of their mother percyd their hertes like as it were
a swerd / which daughters departed not fro her ne for hongre ne for thurst / ne
for no sleep / ne they thout neither of bed ne of table / All the delytes
that they had was for to cry to weep and to make sorrow / And among all the
other / her suster / which was a much devout vyrgyne wept many teres / and
said to saint Clare her suster / Fair and right sweet suster depart not awe
ye fro me / And leave me not here allone And saint Clare answered to her much
swetely / Fair sweet saster / It plesyth to god / that I depart fro this
world / but weep no more fair suster / For ye shall come hastily to our lord
hastily after me / And also I say you that our lord shall do to you great
comfort and consolacion to fore or ye deye / After this holy and good Clare
drew fast to her end / And the folk and people had to her great devotion /
And the prelates and cardynals came often to see her / And honored her as a very
saint / But there was a merueylous thing to here / For she was by the space
of twelve days / that never entryd in to her body no corporal mete / And she
was so strong by the suffraunce and grace of god / that she comforted in the
seruyse of god all them that come to fore her / And desired and charged them
to do well / And when Friar Reynald which was debonayr came for to see her /
And beheld the great sekenes that she had long time suffered / he preached to
her / and prayed her much to have pacyence / And anon she answered to him freely
and debonayrly / Sith that the holy man saint Fraunceis the servant of Ihesu
Christ has showed to me the weye of truth / And that I have felt and known
the will and grace of Ihesu christ by the aduertysement of saint Fraunceis /
know ye right dear brother / that no pains displease me / ne no penance
greueth me / ne no sekenesses ben to me hard ne displesen / and then answered
she to the friar / when she felt our lord knock at her yate for to take
her soul out of this world / And required / that good folk and spyrytuel
should be with her / that she might here of them the holy words of god / and
specially the words of the death and passion of Ihesu Christ / And among all
other came a Friar named vynberes which was one of the noble prechers that was
in earth / and that oftymes spacke and said noble and holy words ardaunt and
good / of whose coming she was much glad And prayed him that if he had made
ready any new thing / that he should say it / And then the friar opened his
mouth / and began to say so sweet words / that they were like sparklys /
of fire and of ardaunt fervor or hete whereof the holy vyrgyne had much great
consolacion / Then she turned her / and said to her daughters / Sweet
daughters / I recommau^de to you the holy pouerte of our lord / And give ye to
him thankynges for that he has done to you / Then she blessed all them that
had devotion to her / and to her order / And gaf largely and wisely her
blessing to all the pour ladies of her order that were to fore her there /
The two felawes of saint Fraunceis that were there / of whom that one was named
Aungel comforted them / that were full of sorrow / And that other Friar kyssed
deuoutely and holyly the bed of her that should pass to our lord / The holy
ladies sorowed much the loss of their mother / And as much more as they cried
and wept without forth / so much more were they ardauntly greuyd within forth
/ Then saint clare began to speak to her soul al softely / Go said she / go
surely / For thou have a good guide and conduytour in the way where as thou
shall go / which shall led the well the right way Go said she hardyly / for
he yt made the and sanctyfyed the / shall keep the / For he loves the also
tenderly / as the mother does her child / Lord god said she / blessed be thou
that made me And then one of her susters demanded her / to whom she spack
/ I have said she spoken to my blessid soul / And without faylle / her
glorious conduy tour is not fer fro her / Then she called one of her
daughters / and said to her / Fair daughter see thou the king of glory whom
I see / but the daughter saw him not / For the will of god was that one should
see that an other saw not / For there was an happy wydowe and comfortable /
which saw him with the eyes of her heed among the teres that she wept / And
yet nevertheless she was wounded to the heart with a darte full of swetenes and
of sorrow / Then she turned her sight toward the door of the hows / And saw
a great company of vyrgyns enter in to the hows all cladde with white clothes
/ And each of them bare a crown of gold in her head / And among all other
there was one much more clear and fayrer than the other which bare a crown
of gold wyndowed / out whereof issued a right great clerenes / yt all the hows
was so clerly light / that it seemed the night to be clear day / And this lady
that was so clear approached to the bed / where as the spouse of her sone
lay / And she enclyned upon her / and embraced her much swetely / Then the
vyrgyns brought a mantell of right great beauty / And the vyrgyns enforced them
/ to serve / and to cover the body of saint Clare / And well to make ready the
hows / And on the morn was the fest of saint Laurence / And then deyde and
departed out of this mortal life the holy lady and friend of our lord / And
anon the soul of her / was crouned in everlasting joy / The spyryte of her
was much benyngnely and ioyously losed and delyuerd fro the flesh / And
when the body abode in the earth / the soul went with god / which was her
life / And blessid ben the holy company of god / that fro the valeye of this
world conduyted the holy soul of this lady in to the montayne of heuene /
where the blessed life is / Now is the blessed vyrgyn in the company of them /
that been in the court of heaven / Now has she changed her pour little life /
which has brought her for to sytte at the table where the great delytes ben
/ Now has she for the little life of humylyte and of sharpnes the blessed Regne
of heaven / where as she is cladde and arrayed with the robe of perdurable glory
/ Anon the tidings were spredde abroad / that the blessed vyrgyn was departed
/ And when the people of Assyse herd thereof / they came to the place both men
and wymmen by so great companyes / that hit seemed that in the cite abode
neither man ne woman / And all cryenge / O dear lady and Friend of god / and
there with they preysed her / and wept much tendyrly / The potestate and the
provost of the Cite ran much hastily thither And with them many companyes of
knights and of people armed / which all that day and all night kept the
body of the holy vyrgyne much honorably / For they would in no wise that the
town should not have by any adventure dommage / or hurt in taking awey the
tresour that lay there On the morn came the vycayre of Ihesu Christ and all the
cardynals with him with all the Cite of Assyse unto the Church of saint
Damyan / And when it came there to that they should begin the mass for the
blessed saint clare / hit happed / that he that began would have begone
thoffyce of them / that were deed / And anon the pope said / that they ought
better do thoffyce of vyrgyns / than thoffyce of deed folk So that it seemed
that he would canonyse her to fore er she was buried / Then answered the Wise
man the bishop of hostence / and said hit was more acustomed to say of them
that been deed / in this caas / And then they said the mass of Requiem / and
all the prelates and the Bishop of Hostense begonnen to preche and took their
matere / how all the world is vanyte / and begonnen to preyse much gretely
this sweet saint / saint clare / And how she had despised the world and all
that was therein / Then the cardynals that were there went first / and did
holyly the seruyse about the holy body and thoffyce like as it is acustomed /
And by cause that them seemed neither right ne reason yt the precious body should
not be far fro the cite / they bare it to saint Georges with so right great
feste / singing and preysynge god in ympnes and lawdes / and in so great
melodye / that there was honor enough / And in the same place was first buried
the body of saint Fraunceis / And fro this time forthou came much people every
day to the tomb of saint Clare / and gyuynge praysynge and lawde to our lord
god / and verytably / this is a right very saint and glorious vyrgyne regnynge
with the company of Angels / to whom god has given so much honor in earth
/ Ha sweet virgyne / Pray thou to Ihesu Christ for us / For thou were the
first flour of the holy pour ladies / which have drawn to penance without
nombre / and that yt may conduyte us to the life permanable / Amen / It was not
long after gretely that Agnes suster of saint Clare was somoned and called to
wedding of the veary lamb Ihesu Christ / And also saint Clare ladde her suster
unto the joy perdurable full of delyces / there be now the two daughters of
syon / which were susters germayns of grace and of nature / and ben now
h^rytours of the joy of heaven / there where they feel the swetenes of God /
and enjoy with him Now is Agnes in the joy and in the consolacion / that
Clare her suster had promised to her / to fore that she deyde / For like as
Clare brought her out of the world / so brought she her self in the Cross
of penance / by which she is shynyng in heaven / Thus went Agnes after her
suster right soon out of this mortal life full of weeping and of sorrow unto
our lord which is life of the soul in heaven which regneth with the fader and
holy ghoost / AMEN /

Here folowen miracles which were showed after her death
THe tokenes and miracles of saints ought to be showed preysed and honored /
And also wytnessyd / when the works in the life were holy and full of
perfection / we find not many signs / ne miracles that saint Johan the
baptist did / Nevertheless he is a much holy saint / and gretter than such
one as have be showed for many miracles / And therefore I say that the right
holy life and the great perfection of saint Clare / which she used and demened
here in earth / ought well to suffyse and witness that she is a very saint /
if it were not for the people / which have the more great devotion / and more
gretter faith unto the saints when they see the signs and miracles that
god shows for them / I know well that saint Clare was in the weye full of
merytes / And that she was rauysshed in the perfoundnes of the great clernesse
and light of heaven / Nevertheless though she were resplendysshaunt / well
sauerous / and right full of great miracles / as is well declared by the
cardynallys of Rome / Mine oath of truth that I have made and my conscience
constrayneth me / that I write to my power the life truly / and the miracles of
her / how well I pass over many fair things

Of one that was delyuerd of the fend
There was a child named Iaquemyn of Perouse / which had in his body the
devil / in such wise that this Iagnemyn fylle in the fire / as he that couthe
not keep him / Sometime he hurtled strongly ageynste the ground / Sometime he
bote the stones / so that he brake his t^eth / and otherwhyle brake his head
that all his body was blody / and fowled his mouth / and put out his tongue
/ And sometime he lay and wallowed and was round / so that often he leyd his
thye in his neck / And every day twyes this maladye came to him / and two
persons might not keep him ne hold him / but that he would despoylle and
unclothe him maulgre them both / There could no phisicyen ne wise man / that
was in all the contre find any remedy ne give counceyll to ease him / But
the fader / which was named quyndelor when he saw that he could find no
counceylle / ne remedy for this maladye / began to cry and call on saint
clare the holy vyrgyne / and said to the that art worthy of all honors I
auowe my child / which is meschaunte and caytyf / And pray the right sweet
saint / that thou wylt send to my child health / And forthwith went to her
tomb full of believe to have his request / and leyd the child upon the tomb
of the vyrgyn / and made his prayers / And anon he was delyuerd of the maladye
/ ne never was seek after of that sekenes / ne never hurt him after by reason
of that maladye

Another miracle
Allexandryne of Perouse had in her body a right felonnous deuylle / which had
so utterly power over her that made her descend from a roc^e that stood upon
a River of water / and made her to flee over the water / as she had been a bird
/ and made her to light upon a little bough of a tree which henge over the
River / And cessid not to play there / Also for her sin / hit happed that
she lost her lift side / and was lame of that one hand / And she assayed much
if she might be heled by any medycyne / but all the medycynes that she took
auaylled her not / And then she came to the tomb of saint clare with great
repentance of heart And began to require saint clare / that she would help
her / And anon she was heled and redressyd in all health / And her side was
hole and hand also / and delyuerd of the possession of the deuylle which was
in her / And of many other sekenesses and maladyes to fore the sepulcre of
saint clare /

Of one being mad that she heled
A man borne in France came on a time fro the court / and fylle in a maladye /
that he was out of his wit / and might not speak / and so demened his body
that he might have no rest / and was much over strange and hydous to look on
/ No man might so hold him / but that he brake fro them maulgre them that
held him and brake a sondre cords / or any other thing that they bond him
with / and they of his country brought him to saint clare / and anon he was
hehed / and well delyuerd of his maladye /

And that night he saw the same vysyon that he had first seen that other night

so much people in the monasterye / And lyenge to fore the tomb of the holy
vyrgyne / that he might not enter / ne come in to the monasterye / ne to the

Thus ends the life of saint Clare
Here begynnneth the life of saint barbara
IN the time that maxymyen reigned / there was a rich man / a paynym which
adoured and worshypped the ydolles / which man was named dyoscorus / this
dyoscorus had a young daughter which was named barbara / for whom he did do
make an high and strong toure / in which he did to keep and close this Brbara
to the end that no man should see her by cause of her great beaulte / Then
came many princes unto the said dyoscorus for to treat with him for the
marriage of his daughter / Which went anon unto her and said my douggter
certain princes be comen to me which require me for to have the in marriage /
wherefore tell to me thyn entente and what will ye have to do / Then saint
barbara returned al angrye toward her fader and said my fader I pray you that
ye will not constreyne me to marye / for thereto I have no will ne thought /
After this he departed fro her and went in to the town where there was one
making a cysterne or a pyscyne / For he had many werkmen for to perform this
work / And also he had tofore ordained how he should pay unto each of them
their salayre / and after this he departed thens and went in to a far
contreye where he long soiourned

Then saint barbara the an lle of our lord Ihesu christ descended fro the
toure for to come see the work of her fader / and anon she perceyurd that
there were but two wyndowes only / That one ageynste the southe / and that
other ageynste the north / whereof she Was much abashed and admeruaylled and
demanded of the werkmen why they had not made no moo wyndowes and they answered
that her fader had so commanded and ordained / Then saint barbara said to
them make me here another wyndowe / They answered / dame we fere and dread to
anger your fader / which commanded us to make no moo / ne we dar not therefore
make no moo / e The blessed maid said / do and make that I command you / and
I shall content my fader / and shall excuse you against him / Then did they
that she commanded to them by the manner that she enseygned and showed them /
when the holy saint barbara walked and came unto the cysterne / she made with
her fyngre toward thorryent a cross with her thombe in the stone of marble the
which cross is there yet unto this day / Which every man may see that comes
thither by devotion / and when she came unto the side / where as the water
descended in to the said cysterne / she blessed it / and made the sign of the
cross and Incontynente the water was hallowed in Which al they that Were seek
received health / if they had parfyte believe in god and in the blessed maid /
In this same cysterne was this holy maid baptized of an holy man / and lived
there certain space of time / in taking only for her refeccion honey socles
and locustes / following the holy precursour of our lord Saint Johan baptyste /
this cysterne or pyscyne is semblable to the fontayn of Syloe / in which he
that was borne blind recouerd there his sight Hit is also like to the pisyne
named robatyca / In which thympotente by the word of god was made hole /
These pyssynes or pecynes ben fontaynes perpetuelles in which al manner seek
men / in what someuer maladye they were greuyd or tormented that went therein /
received fully their health / In this fontaygne is living water / and it is the
water that the samarytane required of our lord to have of the holy pecyne / On
a time this blessed maid went up upon the toure / and there she beheld the
ydolles to which her fader sacrefyed and worshypped / and sodeynlye she
received the holy ghoost / and became meruayllously subtyl and clear in the
love of Ihesu christ / For she was enuyronned with the grace of god almighty of
souereyn glory and of pure chastyte / This holy maid Barbara aourrned with
feythe surmounted the devil / for when she beheld thydolles she cratched them
in their vysages / in despysyng them all and saying / all they ben made like
unto you / which have made you to err / and all them that have affyaunce in
you / and then she went in to the toure / and worshepped our lord / and
when the work was full parfourmed / her fader returned from his vyage / and
when he saw there three wyndowes / he demanded of the werkemen / wherefore have
ye made three wyndowes / and they answered your daughter has commanded so /
Then he made his daughter to come before him / and demanded her why she had
do make three wyndowes / and she answered to him and said / I have done them to
be maad by cause three wyndowes lyghten all the world and all creatures / but
ij make derkenesse / Then her fader took her and went down in to the pyscyne
demaundyng her how three Wyndowes give more light then two / and saint Barbara
answered / These three fenestres or wyndowes betokene clearly / the fader / the
sone / and the holy ghoost / the which ben three persons and one very god /
on whom we ought to believe and worship / Then he being replenysshed with
furour / Incontynente drew his sword to have slain her / but the holy vyrgyn
made her prayer / and then meruayllously she was taken in a stone and borne
in to a montaygne on which two shepherdes kept their sheep / the which saw
her flee / and then her fader Which pursewed after her / went unto the
sheepherdes and demanded after her And that one which would have preserved
her said that he had not seen her / but that other which was an evil man
showed and poynted her with his fyngre / whom the holy saint barbara cursyd /
and anon his sheep became locustes / and he consumed in to a stone / and
then her fader took her by the here and drew her down fro the montayn and
shytte her fast in prison / and maad her to be kept there by his servants
unto the time that he had sent to the Judge / for to deliver her to the
torments / And when the Judge was aduertysed of the feythe and believe of the
maid he did her to be brought tofore him / her fader went which her
accompanied with his servants / thretenyng her with his sword / and delyuerd
her unto the Judge and coniured him by the puyssaunce of his goods that he
should tormente her with horrible torments / Then satte the Judge in Judgment
and when he saw the great beauty of saint barbara he said to her / now chese
whether ye will spare your self / and offer to the gods / or else deye by
cruel torments / Saint barbara answered to him / I offer my self to my god
Ihesu christ / the which has created heaven and earth / and al other things /
and fie on you deuylles which have mowthe and can not speak / they have eyes
and can not see / they have eerys and here not / they have noses and smelle not
/ they have hands and may not feel / and they have feet and may not goo / they
that make them / be they made semblable to them / and al they that have fyaunce
and believe in them / Then became the Judge al wode and angrye and commanded
to unclothe her / and beat her with synewes of bulls / and frote her flesh
with salt / and when she had long endured this / that her body was al blody /
the Judge did do close her in a prison unto the time thot he had delybered of
what torments he might make her deye / and then at mydnyght descended a
great light and clerenesse in to the prison / in which our lord showed him to
her saying / barbara have confydence and be ferme and steadfast / for in heaven
and in therthe thou shalt have great joy for thy passion / therefore doubt
not the Judge for he shall be with the / and I shall deliver the fro al thy pains
/ that any shall make the suffer / and Incontinent she was al hole / and
then when our lord had said thus / he blessed her / and re / mounted in to
heaven / then saint barbara was gretely reioysed by the great comfort of our
lord / and on y^ morn the Judge commanded that she should to brought tofore
him / and when she was come he saw that her wounds apperyd not / but was al
hole / and he said to her behold berbara the bounte of our gods / and how
much they love the / For they have heled thy wou^des / Then the blessed
barbara marter of Ihesu christ answered to the Judge / thy gods be semblable to
the / without entendemente / how may they hele my wounds they may not help
them self he that has heled me is Ihesu criste the sone of god / the which
will not have the / by cause thy heart is so Indurate and hard with the deuyls
/ then the Judge replenysshed of ire commanded that she should be hanged
between two forked trees / and that they should break her raynes with staves /
and brenne her sides with brennyng lamps / and after he made her strongely to
be beten and hurted her heed with a mayllet / Then saint barbara beheld and
looked upward to heaven saying Ihesu Christ that know the hertes of men / And
know my thought / I beseech the to leave me not / Then commanded the Judge
to the hangman that he should cut of with his sword her pappes and when they
were cut of / the holy saint looked ageyn toward heaven saying Ihesu christ
torn not thy visage fro me / and wha^ she had long endured this pain / the
Judge commanded that she should be ladde betyng thorugh the streets / and the
holy vyrgyn the third time beheld the heaven and said / Lord god that coueryst
heaven with clouds I pray the to cover my body to the end that it be not seen
of the evil people / and when she had maad his prayer / our lord came over her
and send to her an au^gel which cladde her with a white vestemente / and the
knights ladde her unto a town called dallasyon / and there the Judge
commanded ^o slay her with the sword / and then her fader all araged took
her out of the hondes of the Judge / and ladde her upon a montayne / and Saint
barbara reioysed her in hastyng to receive the sallayre of her vyctorye / and
then when she was crawen thither / she made her oryson saying / lord Ihesu
Christ which have formed heaven and earth I beseech the to grant me thy grace
and here my prayer / that al they that have memory of thy name and my passion
I pray the that thou will not remember their sins / for thou know our
fragylyte / Then came there a voys down fro heaven saying unto her Come my
spouse barbara and rest in the chamber of god my fader / which is in heaven /
and I grant to the that thou have required of me / And when this was said she
came to her fader and received the end of her marterdom with Saint Iulyan But
when her fader descended from the montaygne / a fire fro heaven descended on him
and consumed him / In such wise that there could not be found any ashes of
all his body / This blessed virgyne saint barbara received marterdom with
saint Iulyan the second nonas of decembre / A noble man called valentyne buried
the bodies of these two marters and laid them in a little town / in which
many miracles were showed in the loving and glory of god almighty and saint
barbara the holy marter suffered passion in the time of maxymyen emperor of

transytorye life in to his glory pardu rale am en /

Thus ends the life of saint barbara
Here begynnneth the life of saint Alexys
ALexys is as much to say as going out of the law of marriage for to keep
vyrgynyte for gods sake / and to renounce all the pomp and rychesses of the
world for to live in pouerte /

Of saint Alexis
IN the time that archadyus and honnoryus were emperors of rome there was in
rome a right noble lord named eufemyen / which was chyef and above all other
lords about themperours / and had under his power a thousand knights / He
was a much Just man unto all men / and also he was pyteous and mercyful unto
the pour For he had daily three tables set and couerd for to feed the
orphans / pour wydowes and pylgrymmes / and he ete at the hour of none wy^h
good and relygyous persons / His wife that was named Agbaes led a relygyous
life / but by cause they had no child / they prayed unto god to send them a
sone that might be their heir after them of their hauoyr and goods Hit was so
that god herd their prayers and behold their bounte and good living / and
gafe unto them a sone which was named alexys / whom they did to be taught
and informed in all scyences and honors / After this they married him unto a
fair damoysel which was of the lygnage of the emperor of Rome / When the day
of thespowsaylles was comen to even / Alexys being in the chamber with his wife
allone / began to enfourme and Induce her to dread god and serve him / and
were all that night to gyder in right good doctrine and fynably he gafe to his
wife his ring / and the bocle of gold of his gyrdle / both bounden in a little
clothe of purple and said to her / Fair suster take this / and keep it as
long as hit shall plese our lord god / And it shall be a token between us / And
he give you grace to keep trewely your vyrgynyte / after this he took of gold
and silver a great sum and departed allone fro Rome / and fond a ship in
which he saylled in to greece / and from thens went in to surtye and came to a
cite called edyssya / and gafe there all his money for the love of god / and
cladde him in a cote and demanded alms for gods sake like a pour man
tofore the church of our lady / and what he left of the almesses above his
necessyte / he gave it unto other for gods sake / and every sunday he was
howsellyd and received the sacrament / Such a life he led long / Sum of
the messegers that his fader had sent to seche him thorugh all the parties of
the world / came to seche him in the said cytee of edyssya and gave unto him
their alms / he syttyng tofore the church with other pour people / but
they knew not him / and he knew well them / and thanked our lord / saying I
thank the fair lord Ihesu christ / that vouchest saufe to call me and to take
alms in thy name of my servants / I pray the to parfourme in me that /
which thou haste begone / When the messagers were returned to Rome / and
eufemyen his fader saw that they had not founden his sone / He laid him down
upon a matras stratchyng on the earth / wayllyng and said thus / I shall hold
me here and abide / till that I have tidings of my sone /

And the wife of his sone alexis said weeping to eufemyen / I shall not depart
out of your hows / but shall make me semblable and like to the turtle which
after that she has lost her felawe / will take none other / but all her life
after lives chaste /

In like wise I shall refuse all felawshyp unto the time that I shall know
where my right sweet friend is becomen / After that alexys had done his
penance by right great pouerte in the said cite / and led a right holy life
by the space of seuentene year there was a voys herd that came fro god unto
the church of our lady / and said to the porter / make the man of god to enter
in / for he is worthy to have the kingdom of heaven / and the spyryte of god
restyth on him / When the clerk could not find ne know him emonge the other
pour men / He prayed to god to show to him who it was / and a voys came fro
god and said / he sytteth without tofore thentre of the church / and so the
clerk fond him / and prayed him humbly that he would come in to the church /
When this myrarle came to the knowleche of the people / and alexys saw that
men did to him honor and worship / anon for tesch^we vaynglorye he departed
fro thens / and came in to greece / where he took ship and entryd for to goo
in to cecyle / But as god would there aroos a great wind which made the
ship to arryue at the port of Rome / when alexys saw this anon he said to
him self / by the grace of god I thyl charge no man of Rome / I shall goo to my
faders hows in such wise as I shall not be beknowen of any person / and when
he was within rome he met eufemyen his fader which came fro the paleye of
the emperor with a great meyne following him / and alexys his sone like a pour
man ran cryeng and said / Sergeaunte of god have pity of me that am a pour
pilgrim / and receive me in to thy hows for to have my sustenaunce of the
relyef that shall come from thy board / that god bless the and have pity on thy
sone which is also a pilgrim /

When eufemyen herd speak of his sone / anon his heart began to melte and
said to his servants / which of you will have pity of this man and take the
cure and charge of him / I shall deliver him from his seruage and make him free
/ and shall give him of mine heritage / And anon he commysed him unto one of
his servants / and commanded that his bed should be maad in a corner of the
halle / Where as comers and goers might see him / And the servant to whom
Alexys Was commanded to keep maad anon his led under the stayer and stappes
of the halle / And there he lay right like a pour wretch / and suffered many
vylonyes and despytes of the servants of his fader / which oftymes cast and
threw on him the wasshyng of dysshes and other fylthe / and did to him many
evil tornes and mocqued him / but he never compleyned / but suffered all
pacyentely for the love of god / Fynably when he had led this right holy life
within his faders hows / in fasting in prayeng and in doing penance by the
space of seuentene year / and knew that he should sone deye / he prayed the
servant that kept him to give him a pyece of parchemy^ and ynke / and therein
he wrote by order al his life / and how he was married by the commandment of
his fader / and what he had said to his wife / and of the tokenes of his ring
and bocle of his gyrdle that he had given to her at his departing / and what he
had suffered for gods sake / And all this did he for to make his fader to
understand that he Was his sone / After this when hit pleasyd to God for to
show and manyfeste the vyctorye of our Lord Ihesu Christ in his servant
Alexys / On a time on a sunday after mass heeryng all the people in the
church there was a voys herd from god cryeng and saying / as is said Mathei
vndecimo capitulo / Come unto me ye that labor and be trauaylled / I shall
comfort you / Of which voys all the people were abashed / which anon fyl
down unto the earth / And the voys said ageyn / Seche ye the servant of god /
For he prays for all Rome / And they sought him but he was not founden /
Alexis in a morning on a good friday gafe his soul unto god and departed out
of this world / And that same day all the people assemblyd at Saint Peter's
church / And prayed god that he would show to them where the man of god might
be founden that prayed for Rome / And a voys was herd that came fro god that
said ye shall find him in the hows of Eufemyen / And people said unto Eufemyen
/ why haste thou hid fro us / that thou have such grace in thyn hows / and
eufemyen answered god knows that I know no thing thereof / Archadyus and
honoryus that then were emperors at Rome / And also the pope Innocente
commanded that men should goo unto Eufemyens hows for to inquire d^lygentlye
tidings of the man of God Eufemyen went tofore with his servants for to
make ready his h^ws ageynste the coming of the po^e and Emperors / And when
(...) Wife had understand the cause / and how a voys was herd that came (...)
god / saying / Seche the man of god in Eufemyens hows / anon she said to
Eufemyen / Sir see if this pour man that ye have so long kept and herberowed
be the same man of god / I have well marked that he has lived a right fair
and holy life / He has every sunday received the sacrament of the altar / He
has been right relygyous / In fasting / in wakyng / and in prayer / and has
suffered pacyentlye and debonayrlye of our servants many vylonyes / And when
Eufemyen had herd all this / He ran toward alexys and fond him deed / He
dyscoueryd his vysage / which shone and was brighte as the face of an aungelle
/ And anon he returned toward themperours and said we have found the man of
god that we sought / and told unto them how he had herberowed him / and how
the holy man had lived / And also how he was deed / and that he held a bylle
or letter in his hand / which they might not draw out / Anon the emperor
with the pope went to Eufemyens hows and came tofore the bed where alexys
lay deed / and said / how well that we ben synnars / yet nevertheless we
govern the world and loo here is the pope the generalle fader of all the
church / give us the letter that thou hold in thyn hand / for to know
what is the writing of hit / and the pope went tofore and took the letter /
and took it to his notayre for to read / and the notayre read hit tofore the
pope / the emperors / and all the people / and when he came to the point that
made mencyon of his fader / and of his mother / and also of his wife / and that
by thenseygnes that he had given to his wife at his departing his ring and
bocle of his gyrdle wrapped in a little purple clothe at his departing / Anon
eufemyen fyl down a swowne / and when he came ageyn to him self / he began
to draw his heerys / and beat his breast and fyl down on the corpse of alexys
his sone and kyssed it weeping and cryeng in right great sorrow of heart saying
/ Alas right sweet sone wherefore have thou made me to suffer such sorrow /
thou saw What sorrow and heaviness we had for the / alas why had thou no
pity on us in so long time / how myghtest thou suffer thy mother and thy fader
weep so much for the / and thou saw it well without taking pity on us / I
supposed to have herd sometime tidings of the and now I see the lie deed in
thy bed which sholdest be my solace in mine age / alas what solace may I have
that see my right dear sone deed / me were better deye then live / when the
mother of alexys saw and herd this / she came r^nnyng like a lioness / and
cried alas alas / drawyng her here in great sorrow cratchyng her pappes with
her nails saying / These pappes have given the sowke and when she myyht not
come to the corpse for the foyson of people that was come thither / She cried and
said make rome and way to me sorrowful mother / that I may see my desire and my
dear sone that I have engendryd and nourysshed / and as soon as she came to the
body of her sone / she fyl down on it pyteously and kyssed hit saying thus /
alas for sorrow my dear sone the light of mine eage / why have thou maad us
suffer so much sorrow / thou saw thy fader / and me thy sorrowful mother so
often weep for the / and would never make to us semblaunte of sone /

O all ye that have the heart of a mother / weep ye With me upon my dear sone
whom I have had in my hows seuentene year as a pour man / To whom my
servants have done much vylonye / a fair sone thou have suffered them right
swetely and debonayrlye / Alas thou that were my trust / my comfort and
solace in mine old eage how myghtest thou hyde the from me / that am thy
sorrowful mother / who shall give to mine eyes fro hens forth a fontayn of teerys
for to make pain unto the sorrow of my heart / and after this came the wife of
alexys in weeping throwyng her self upon the body / and with great syghes and
heaviness said Rygh^ sweet friend and spouse whom long I have desired to see
/ and chastely I have to the kept my self like a turtle / that allone Without

desired to see a live / and now I see him deed / Fro hensforth I wot not in
whom I shall have fy^unce ne hope / Certes my solace is deed / and in sorrow I
shall be unto the death / For now forthon I am the most unhappy emonge all
wymmen / And rekenyd emonge the sorrowful wydowes / And after these pyteous
compleyntes the people wept for the death of Alexys / The pope made the body
to be taken up and to be put in to a fye^ree / and borne unto the church And
when it was borne though the cite / right great foyson of people came against it
and said the man of god is founden that the cite sought / What someuer seek
body might touch the fyertre / he was anon helyd of his maladye /

There was a blind man that recouerd his syghte / and lame / and other helyd /
The Emperor made great foyson of gold and silver to be thrown emonge the
people for to make Way that the fyertre might pass / And thus by great
labor and reverence was borne the body of Saint alexys unto the church of
saint boneface the glorious marter / And there was the body put in to a shryne
much henourably made of gold and silver the seuentene day of Iuyl / and all
the people rendered thankynges and lawde to our lord god for his great miracles
/ unto whom ^e yeuen honor lawde and glory In sacula seculorum AMEN /

Thus ends the life of saint Alexys
Here follows the life of saint Elysabeth / And first of her name
ELysabeth is expowned and as much to say as my god knows her or she is
said the seventh of my god / or the fyllyng of my god / First god knows her /
for he knew her god will / and prouyd it / and he gave to her knowleche of
him self / Secondly she is said seventh of god / for she had seven things in
her / she had the seven workys of mercy / or by cause she is now in the vij age
of them that rest / and to come to the viij of the general resurrexyon / or
for the seven estates that were in her / she was in the estate of vyrgynyte /
in estate of marriage / In estate of wydow head / In estate of action / In
estate of contemplacion / In estate of relygyon and she is now in estate
glorious / And these seven estates ben appertelye contained in her legende /
So that it may be said of her / like as it is said of nabugodonosor / that is
to wete / vij times ben changed in her / and also she is said the fyllyng of
my god / for god has filled and replenysshed her with the resplendour of
truth / of sweet savor / and of the vygour of the trynyte / whereof saint
austyn says / she woke in the pardurabylite of god / she shone in the veryte
of god And she enjoyed in the bounte of god

Of saint elysabeth
ELisabeth was daughter of the noble king of hungarye and was of noble lignage
/ but she was more noble by her feyth and relygyon than by her right noble
lignag she was right noble by ensaumple / shshone by miracle / and she was
fair by grace of holiness / for thauctor of nature enchaunced her in a manner
above nature / when this holy maid was nourisshed in delyces royal / she
renounced al chyldysshenes / and set her self al in the service of god /
then it apperith clearly as her tender Infancye enforced in symplesse / and
began to use good customs fro than forthon / and to despise the plays of the
world and of vanytees / and flee the prosperytees of the world / and alwey to
prouffyte in the honor of god / for when she was yet but five year old she
abode so ententyfly in the church for to pray that her felawes or her
chamberers might uneath bring her thens / and when she met any of her
chamberers or felawes / she would follow them toward the chapel as it were for
to play / for to have cause to enter in to the church / and when she was
entered anon she knelyd down and lay down to the earth / how be it that she
knew not yet any letters / and she opened often the psaulter tofore her in the
church for to fayn that she read / by cause she should not be let and that
she should be seen ocupyed / and when she was with other maidens for to play /
she consyderyd well the manner of the game / for to give alwey honor to god
under occasyon / and in play of rings and other games / she set al her hope
in god / and of all that she wanne / and had of any part proffite when she was
a young maid / she gafe the x to pour maidens / and led them oftyme with
her for to say pater noster / or for to salewe our lady / and like as she grew
in age by time / so grew she by devotion / for she chaas the blessed vyrgyn
marye to be her lady / and her advocate / and saint Johan the evangelist to be
wardeyn of her virgynyte / and on a time there were so^ules layee on the altar
/ and in every cedule was wryton the name of apostle and each of the other
maidens took at all adventure such a cedule / as happyd to her / And she made
her oryson / and thryse she took the same that she desired / in which was
wryton the name of Saint Peter / To whom she had so great devotion that she
never warned thing to them that demanded hit in his name / And by cause that
the good adventures of the world should not preyse her over much / She
withdrewe every day sum thing of her prosperytees / And when she took in any
game any pleasure / anon she left it / and said she would play no more / but
she would say / I leave you the remenaunt for gods sake / She went not gladly
to karollys / but wythdrewe other maidens fro them / She doubted alweye to were
ioly clothing / but she vsyd alweye to have them honest / She had ordained to
say every day certain nombre of orysons and prayers / and if she were ocupyed
in any manner that she might not perform them / but that she was constrained
of her chamberers to goo to her bed / she would there say them wakyng / This
holy vyrgyn honored all the solemn festys of the year / with so great
reverence that she would not suffer his sleuys to be laced / till the solempnyte
of the mass was accomplysshed / and she herd the office of the mass with so
great reverence / that when the gospel was read or that the sacrament was
lift up / she would take of the broches of gold and the aournementes of her
heed as sercles or chappelettes / and leye them down / And when she kept in
Innocence / the degree of vyrgynyte she was constreyned to enter in to the
degree of marriage / For her fader constrained her thereto / by cause she should
bring forth fruit / And how be it that she would not have been married / yet
she durst not gaynsay the commandment of her fader / Then she auowed in the
hands of master conrade which was a good man / and her confessor and
promised that if her husbond deyed / and she over lived him / that she would
keep perpetuel contynence / Then was she married to the londgraue of thurynge
/ like as the deuyne pourueaunce had ordained / by cause she should bring much
people to the love of our lord / and teache the aid people / and how be hit she
changed her estate / yet she changed not her will in her thought / and she
was of great humylite and of great devotion to god / and was toward her self of
great abstynence and of great mercy / She was of so right ardaunte desire of
prayer / that she often went sonner to the church then her meyne to the end
that by her prayers secret she might Impetre and get grace of god / She aroos
often by night for to make her prayers / and her husbond would pray her that she
would lie and rest her a little / She had ordained that one of her wymmen which
was more famylyer with her then another that if peradventure she were
overtaken with sleep / that she should take her by the foot for to awake her /
and on a time / she supposed to have taken her lady by the foot / and took her
husbondes foot / which sodeynlye awoke and would know wherefore she did so /
and then she told to him all the caas / and when he knew / it he let it
pass / and suffered it pesybly / And by cause she would render good sacrefyse to
god of her prayers / she wette often her body with habundaunce of teris / and
let them flow out of her eyes gladly without chaungyng of semblaunte / so
that often she wept with great sorrow / and she yet enjoyed in god / She was
of so great humylyte / that for the love of god she laid in her lap a man
horrible seek Which had his vysage stynkyng like carayn / and she share of the
ordure and fylthe of his heed / and wysshe hit whereof her chamberers bothed and
loughe her to scorn / and she would in rogacion time follow the procession
barefote and without lynnen smock / and at the prechynge she would sytte emonge
the pour people / she would not array her with precious stones as other / The
day of purifycacyon of our lady ne were rich vesture of gold / but after the
ensaumple of the blessed vyrgyne marye / she bare her sone in her arms and a
lamb and a candel / and offered it up humbly / and by that she showed / that
the pomp and bo^anunce of the world should be eschewyd / And that she conformed
her unto the vyrgyne marye / and when she came home / she gafe to sum pour
woman the clothes in which she went to church She was of so great humylite /
that by the consentyng of her husbond / she submysed her self in the obedyence
of master conrade / a pour man and a small / but he was of noble science and
parfyte relygyon / and she did it with joy and reverence / that which he
commanded / for to have the merit of obedyence / like as god was obedyent
unto the death / ON a time it happed that she was called for to goo to prechyng
/ and the marquyse of messence came upon her / by whom she was let and might
not goo thither wherefore he held him evil apayed and would not relece her
obedyence / till that she was despoyled to her smock / with sum of her
chamberers which were culpable / and that he had strongely beten them / she
did so great abstynence / that at the table of her husbond emonge the diverse
metes that were there / she Would not ete but bread She took so great rygour on
her self / that she wexyd le^e / for master conrade deffendyd her that she
should not touch the metes of her husbond of which she should not have an hole
conscience / and she kept this commandment with so great dylygence / that
when other habounded in delyces / she ete with her chamberers gross metes / On
a time when she had sore traueyled in going / there were brought to her and to
her husbond diverse metys and were supposed not well gooten of good and Just
labor / wherefore she refused them / and took her refectyon of an hard broune
loof tempryd with water / and for this cause her husbond assygned a pencyon to
her / by which she and her chamherers consentyd for to live by / and her
husbond suffryd al in pacyence / and said he would gladly do so / if he
doubted not to anger his meyne / and she that was in souerayn glory / desired
thestate of sovereign pouerte / to the end that the world should have no thing
in her / and that she should be pour like as Ihesu Christ had been / and when
she was allone with her chamberers / she would clothe her with pour vestementes
/ and vile and set a pour veil upon her heed and said / thus shall I goo
when I shall come to the estate of pouerte / And though she did abstynence / yet
was she lyberal to the pour / so that she might not suffer that any had
mysease / but gave to them a^le largely She entented with all her power to
the seven werkys of mercy / she gave on a time to a pour woman a right good
vesture / and when this pour woman saw that she had so noble a yefte / she
had so great joy that she fyl down as deed / and when the blessed elysabeth
saw that / she was sorry that she had given to her so noble a yefte / and
doubted that she was cause of her death / and prayed for her / and anon she
aroos all hoole / And she spanne often wulle with her chamberers / and made
thereof clothe / so that of her propre labor that she gafe to the church / she
received glorious fruit / and gafe good ensaumple unto other / On a time when
her husbond landegraue was goon to the court of the emperor / which was
then at cremone / she assemblyd in a garnere all the whete of the year / and
admynystred part to eueryche that came from all parties / and that time was
great derthe in the contree / and often when her lacked money she sold of her
aournementes for to give to the pour people / but for all that she gave the
garners mynysshed not ne lassyd / She did do make an hows great under we
castle / where she received and nowrysshed great multitude (...) pour people /
and vysyted them every day and she left not to vysyte them for any sekenes ne
maladye that they had but she wesshe and wyped them with her own hands / how
be hit that her chamberers would not suffer it / And yet more over then she
did do nourysshe in her hows power wymmens children so swetely / that they
all called her mother /

She did do make sepultures for pour people and went deuoutely unto the death
of them / and would burye them with her own hands / in the clothes that she
had made / And often times brought the shete wherein she lay for to wind the
deed bodies therein / and was at the death of them much deuoutelye / and emonge
these things the devotion of her husbond was much to be preysed / for how well
he was ocupyed in his other things / Nevertheless he was devout in the
service of god / and by cause he might not him self entende personably unto his
things / he gave full power to his wife to all that should be to the honor or
to the health of their sowles / And the blessed saint elisabeth had great
desire / that her husbond should enploye his puyssaunce to deffende the feythe
of god / and aduysed him by debonayr admonestemens / that he should goo vysyte
the holy land / and thither he went / and when he was there this devout and
noble prince full of feyth and of devotion rendryd his spyrite unto almighty god
and so deyed / receyuyng the glorious fruit of his werkys / and then she
received with devotion the state of wydowed / and when the death of her husbond
was publysshed and known thorugh all thurynge / Sum of the vayssalles of
her husbond held her for a fool / and a wastresse of her goods / and threw
her out of her heritage / and by cause her pacyence were more clear / and that
she had the pouerte that she had long desired / She went then by night in
to the hows of a tauerner in the place where the pottes lay / and gave great
thankynges to god / and at the hour of matyns she came in to the hows of friar
menours / and prayed them that they would give lawde and than kings to god for
her trybulacyon / And the day following she came with her / little children to a
place / and in to the hows of one her enemy / and then was delyuerd to her a
strayte place for to dwell in / and when she saw that she was much greuyd of
the host and hoostesse / then she salewed the walls and said / I should
gladly salewe the men / but I find them not / and thus she being constraynte
by necessyte / she sent her small children here and there for to be nourisshed
in diverse places / and returned her self in to the first place / and as she
went there was a strayte weye upon stones / and a deep mire under and full of
fylthe / and as she passed she met an old woman / to whom she had done
much good tofore / and this old woman would give her no weye / so that she
fyl in the deep mire and fylth and then she aroos and scraped her vesture /
and lawghed / and after this / one her aunte had great pity of her / and sent
her wisely to her uncle bishop of banebergenence / Which received her much
honestlye and retained her in entente to marye her ageyn / and when her
chamberers herd thereof which had auowed contynence with her / were passing
wroth and wept / And she comforted them and said I trust in our lord for the
love of whom I have auowed contynence perdurable / that he shall keep me in my
purpeos / and shall take aweye all vyolence / and shall corompe all counceyl
humayn / and if mine uncle would marye me to any man / I shall wythstonde it to
my power / and shall gaynsay it with words / and if I may not so escape I shall
cut of my nose / so that every man shall hate me for my lothelynes / and
then the bishop did do led her in a castle against her will for to abide
there / till that sum man should demand to have her in marriage / And she
commanded to our lord her chastyte all weeping / and then our lord ordained
that the bones of her husbond should be brought from over see / And then the
bishop maad her to come and goo deuoutelye to mete the boones of her husbond /

And then the boones were received of the bishop with right great honor /
and of her with great devotion and weeping of teerys / And then she said to
our lord / Sir I render to the graces and thankynges / of this that I may
receive the bones of my sweet husbond / and that thou haste vouched sauf to
comfort me pour caytyf / Sir I loved him much / why^he louyd the / and lord
for the love of the I suffered well his presence / And I sent him unto the help
of the holy land / and I call the to wytnes that how be it that hit were a
delectable thing to me to live yet with him / so that he were pour / and I
also a pour beggar thorugh the world / but that ageynste thy will I would not
bye him ageyn with an here / ne I would not return ageyn to mortal life / lord
I command me and him in to thy grace / and then she cladde her with habyte
relygyous / and kept perpetuel contyne^ce after the death of her husbonde and
obedyence performed she took will full pouerte / and her clothyng was course and
vile / she ware a russet mantel / her gown of another foul color / The
sleuys of her cote were broken and amended with pyeces of other color / Her
fader king of hongarye when he herd that his daughter was comen to the estate
of pouerte / he sent an earl to her for to bring her to her fader / and when
the earl saw her sytte in such an habyte and spynnyng / he escryed for sorrow
and said there was never kings daughter that ware such an habit / ne seen
spynnyng wulle / and when he had done his message and desired to have brought
her to her fader / She in no wise would acoord^ to hit / but had lever to be
nedy emonge the pour people / thynne to abound in great rychesses / with rich
people / to the end that she should not be empesshed / but that her will and
mind should be all weye in our lord / And she prayed our lord that he would
give to her grace to despise al erthely things / and take aweye fro her heart
the love of her children / and to be ferme and constaunte against the
persecucions And when she had accomplysshed her prayer / she herd our lord
saying thy prayer is herd / and then said she to her chamberers / our lord
has herd my voys / For I repute all erthelye things as donge and fylthe /
And set no more by mine own children then I do by other men's and my
neighbors / ne I love none other thing but our lord / master conrade did to
her often / things contrary and grievous / and such things as he saw that she
louyd / that remeuyd he and took aweye fro her company / And took fro her two
maidens / her chamberers byloued emonge all other and had been nourisshed with
her fro her chyldehode / And this holy man did this for to break her will /
so that she should set al love in our lord and to the end that she should not
remember her first glory / In all these things she was hasty for to obey /
and constaunte to suffer / that ^y pacyence she might possess her soul / and
by obedyence to be maad fair and ennobled / She said if I only for gods
sake dread so much a man mortal / how much more ought I to dread and doubt
the heavenly Judge / Therefore I make obedyence to master conrade a pour man and
a beggar / and not to a rich bishop / by cause I would put aweye fro me all
occasyon of temporal comfort / On a time by cause she went in to a cloyst^e
of nonnes / which prayed her dyligently for to vysyte them / without license
of her master / he beat her so sore therefore / that the strokes apperyd in her
three wekes after by which she showed to our lord that her obedyence was more
plesyng / than the offering of a thousand hostyes / Better is obedyence then
sacrefyse She was of so great humylyte that she would suffer in no wise that
her chamberers should call her lady / but that they should speak and say to her
as to the lowest and lest of them / She wesshe otherwhyle the dysshes and the
vessel of the kechyn / and she hyd her otherwhyle that the chamberers should not
let her / and she Would say if I could find another life more despised I would
have taken it / she chase the best / she had a special grace to weep
habundantly teris for to see celestyal vysyons / and for to enflamme the hertes
of other to the love of god / On a day of the holy lent she was in the church
/ And she beheld ententyfly the altar like as she had been in the presence
deuyne / and there she was comforted by reuelacion deuyne / And then she
returned to her hows / and prophesied of her self / that she should see Ihesu
christ in heaven / and anon as she lay down for feebleness in the lap of her
chamberer / she began to look up in to heaven / and she was so glad / that she
began deboneyrlye to lawghe / and when she had been long ioyeful / she was
suddenly turned in to weeping / and then she looked up to heuenward ageyn / and
anon she returned in to her first joy / and when she closed her eyes she
began to weep / and in this manner she abode till complyn and had dyuyne vysyons
/ and then she was stylle a while and said thus after / lord will thou be with
me and I with the / ne I will not depart fro the / After these things the
chamberers desired her to tell to them why she had so lawghed and wept / and
she said I have seen heaven open / and Ihesu crist which enclyned him
debonayrlye to me / and I was glad of the vysyon and wept for to depart fro
hit / and he said to me if thou wylt be with me I shall be with the / and I
answered like as ye herd / Her prayer was of so great ardeur / that she drew
other to good living / On a time she saw a young man / and she called him to
her and said to him / thou lyuest dissolutely / and thou ought to serve god
/ wylt thou that I pray for the / I will well / and require it of you desyrously
/ and then she prayed for him / and the young man also prayed for him self /
and anon the young man began to cry / seece ye lady and leave of but she
prayed alweye more ententyfly / and he began to cry / ceace lady ceace / for I
begin to fail and am all burnt / and he was esprysed with so great hete that
he swette / and fled as he had been from him self / So that many ran which
despoyled him for his great hete / and they hem self might vunethe suffer the
hete of him / and when she had accomplysshed her prayer the young man left his
hete and came ageyn to him self / and by the grace that was given to him he
entryd in to the order of the friar menoures / and when he had taken habyte of
relygyon / she prayed for him so affectuously that by the fervent prayers /
made him that so brennyd to be cold / and left his dyssolute life / and took
upon him a ghoostly and spyritual life / and then this blessed elysabeth
received thabyte of relygyon and put her self dylygently to the werkys of mercy
/ for she received for her dowayr two hundred mark / whereof she gave a part
to pour people / and of that other part she made an hospytal / and therefore
she was called a wasteresse and sole / which all she suffered ioyously / and
when she had made this hospytal she became her self as an humble chamberer in
the service of the pour people / and she bare her so humbly in that service /
that by night she bare the seek men between her arms for to let them do
their necessytees / and brought them ageyn / and made clean their clothes and
shetes that were foul / She brought the meselles a bed and wysshe their
soores and wyped them / and did all that longed to an hospytaller / And when
she had no pour men / she would spynne wulle which was sent to her from an
abbey / and such as she gate thereof she gave to the pour people and when she
had be in much pouerte she received five hundred mark of her dowayr / which
she gave unto the pour much ordynately / and then she made an ordenaunce
that who someuer remeuyd his place in preiudyce of another when she gave her
alms / should have his heerys cut of or shoren Then came a maid named
Radegounde which shone by the beaulte of her heerys / and passyd by / not for
to have alms / but for to vysyte her suster which was seek / And she
commanded anon that her here should be cut of / and she wept and ageyn said it

And there was a man which said that she was Innocente / Then saint
elysabeth said / then at the least said she / she shall swear / that she shall
no more by cause of her here goo to dau^ces ne karollys / ne haunte such
vanytees / And saint elysabeth demanded of her if ever she was dysposyd or
were in purpoos to use the weye of health / and she answered / that if she had
not had that fair here / she had long sithe taken thabyte of relygyon / and
she said I had lever that thou sholdest lose thyn here / than my sone were made
emperor and then anon the maid took habyte of relygyon with saint
elysabeth and fynysshed her life lawdably / when the time approached that god had
ordained / that she which had despised the reygne mortal / should have the
reygne of aungellys / She lay seek of the fevers / and turned her to the wall
/ and they that were there herd her put out a sweet melodye / and when one of
the chamberers had inquired of her / what it was / she answered and said a bird
came between me and the wall / and sange so swetely / that it provoked me to
sing with hit / She was alweye in her maladye glad and iocounde / and ne
cessyd of prayer / The last day tofore her departing she said to her
chamberers / what will ye do if the devil come to you / and after a little while
she cried with an high voys / fle / fle / fle / like as she had chaced aweye
the devil / and after she said the mydnyght approaches / in which Ihesu christ
was borne / It is now time that god call his friends to his heavenly weddynges
/ and thus the year of our lord a thousand two hundred and xxvj she gafe up her
spyrite and slepte in our lord and though the body lay four days unburied /
yet came there no stynche fro hit / but a sweet odor aromatyke came which
refresshed all them that were there / Then there was herd and seen a
multitude of birds so many that there has not be seen like tofore over the
church / and began a song of right great melodye like as it had been the
obsequyes of her / and their song was Regnum mundi / which is song in the
preysyng of virgyns / There was a great cry of pour pe ple for her / and much
devotion of pe ople / so that sum took an here of her heed / and sum a
part of her clothes / which they kept for great relyques / and then her
body was put in a monumente / which after was founden to redounde in oil /
and many fair miracles were showed at her tomb after her death / It was well
showed in the deyeng of saint elisabeth of what holiness she was / as well in the
modulacion of the bird / as in the expulcyon of the devil / That bird that
was between her and the wall and prouokyd her to sing / is supposed to be her
good aungel / which was deputed to her / and brought her tidings that she
should goo to the everlasting joy / and in like wise is showed to cursyd men
otherwhyle their everlasting dampnacyon / In the parties of saxone there was a
monk that hyghte hemer which was fall in so great a sekenes that he cried /
and would suffer no creature to have rest about him in the hows / On a night
apperyd to him an honorable lady clad in whyt / which aduysed him / that he
should auowe him to saint elysabeth if he would have his health / and the next
night she appyeryd to him in like wise / And then by the counceyl of his
abbot he maad the auowe / The third night she apperyd to him ageyn / and made
the sign of the cross upon him / and he then received anon full health and
was parfytely hool / And when the abbot and the pryour came to him / they were
gretely admeruaylled / and doubted much the accomplysshemente of the auowe /
and the pryour said that oftymes under the lykenes of good comes Illusyon of
the fend / and counceylled him to be confessyd of his auowe / And the night
following the same person apperyd unto him and said / Thou shalt be alweye
seek till thou haste accomplysshed and fulfilled thyn auowe / and anon his
Infyrmyte took him ageyn and would not leave him / And afterward by the license
given of his abbot he accomplisshed ^is auow and was made al hool / There was a
maid demanded drink of a servant of her faders / and she gafe her drink /
and said the devil mote thou drink / and she drank / and her seemed that fire
entryd in to her body / Then began she to cry / and her belly to swelle like
to a barelle / so that each man saw that she was demonyake / and she was two
year in that estate / and after was brought to the tomb of saint elysabeth
and was made parfytely hool / and delyuerd of the fend / There was one herman
a man of the dyosyse of coloyn / which was holden in prison / and he called
with great devotion saint elysabeth unto his help and the night following she
apperyd to him and comforted him / and on the morn sentence was given against
him that he should be hanged / and the Judge gave license to his friends to take
him down of the galowes / and they bare him aweye al deed and began to pray
saint elysabeth for him / and anon he aroos fro death to life tofore them al / A
child of four year old was fallen in to a pytte and drowned / and a man came
for to take water and espied the deed child / and was drawn out / and then
they auowed him to saint Elysabeth / and he was anon restablysshed to his
first life and health There was one frederyk a maronner which was connyng in
swimming / and on a time baygned him in a water / and he mocaued a pour man
which saint elysabeth had enlumyned / and yeuen ageyn to him his sight / And
the pour man said / This holy lady which has helyd me will avenge me on the /
so that thou shall never come out of the water but deed / and anon the swymmer
lost al his strength and might not help him self / but sanke down to the
bottom like a stone and was drowned / and then was drawn out of the water /
and forthwith so^me of his friends auowed him to saint Elysabeth / and she gafe
to him his life ageyn / There was a man named dyeryk which was grievously vexyd
in his knees and in his thyes so that he might not goo / and he auowed that he
should goo to the tomb of saint elysabeth / and was viij days on going thither
/ and abode there a month and had no remedy and went ageyn to his hows / and
then he saw in his sleep a woman spring water upon him / and awoke wythal
and was angrye and said to her / wherefore have thou awaked me and cast water
on me / and then she said I have wette the / and this wetyng shall do to the
prouffyte and ease / and then anon he aroos al hool and gave thankynges to
god and to saint elysabeth / Then let us pray to her that she pray for us
/ for such things as shall be for the most prouffyte of our sowles / amen /

Thus ends the life of saint Elysabeth
Here follows the life of Saint edmunde confessor
Saint Edmunde the confessor and bishop which restyth at pounteney in
france was borne in england in the town of abendon / his mother was named
mabely the rich / she was ryt holy both wife and wydowe / and this said saint
edmond her sone was borne on Saint edmondes day the king and marter and in his
birth no clothe was fowled by him / and he was borne in the first spryngyng of
the day / and lay all that day till night / as he had been deed / so that the
mydwyf would have had him buried / but his mother said nay / and sone after he
reuyued / and was borne to church and crystenyd and named edmond by cause he
was borne on saint edmondes day / and as he grew in eage so encreced he in
virtues / He had a brother named robert / and the mother set them both to
scole / Also she had two daughters / that one was named marye / and that other
alyce / which were both made nonnes at cattesby in northamton shyre / by the
labor of their brother edmonde / And the mother gave to them gifts to fast the
friday / and drew them to virtuous and holy living by yeftes and fair
byhestys / so that when they came to more parfyte age / it greuyd them not /
Their mother ware hard heir for our ladies love / and ladde her life in great
penance / and daily labored / and on a time as she put out wulle for to
spynne / she delyuerd so much for the pound / that the spynners might not
live thereby / which compleyned thereof to her sone edmond / and he took the
yarne that was spo^ne (...) pound and rakyd it in the fire and a certain time
after he took hit out of the fire / and the Just pound was not hurt ne lassed
/ but as much as was more than a pound was wasted and burnt by the fire /
And when she saw this she repentyd her gretely / and did so never more after
After this she sent her two sons to pary^ to scole / and delyuerd to them
money for ^^eyr costs and scolehyre / and also two shyrtes of heir / and
prayed them for gods love and here is that they would were tho shyrtes ones or
twyes in the weke / and they should lack no thing nedeful to them / and they
granted gladly to do after their moders desire / in so much that within a
while of custom they ware the heyr every day / and lay therein every night
This was a blessed mother that so virtuously brought forth her children and in
short time saint edmond encreaced so gretely in virtue / that every man had
joy of him / gyuyng lawde to god thereof / And on a day as his felawes and he
went to play / He left their felawshyp and went allone in to a medowe / and
under an hedge he said his deuocions / and sodeynlye there apperyd tofore him a
fair child in white clothing / which said hayle felawe that go allone /
and Saint edmond being abashed meruaylled fro whens this child came / To whom
the child said / edmond know thou not me / and he said nay / I am thy
felawe in the scole / and in all where thou go I am ever on thy right side
and yet thou know me not / but leke in my forhede / and there thou shall
find my name wryton / and then edmonde looked in his forhede / and saw
wryton therein with letters of gold Ihesus nazarenus rex Iudeorum / and then
the child said dread the not edmond / for I am Ihesu Christ thy lord / and I
shall be thy deffendour here while thou lyuest / and then edmond fyl down
mekely thankyng him of his great mercy and goodness / And then our lord
taught him to say when he shall goo to his bed or arise / and bliss him with
this prayer / Ihesus nazarenus rex Iudeorum fili dei miserere mei / in
remembrance of my passion / and the devil shall never have power to overcome
the and then anon this child vanysshed aweye and saint edmond thankyd
humbly our lord / that it pleasyd to him to show him in this manner / and ever
after both euenyng and morning he used contynuelly to bless him with that
holy prayer to his lives end / and did much penance ever after for gods
sake / and when he had continued at scole a long time at paris / he came home
and went to oxenford to scole / and alweye in this time he was chaste in his
living and a clean vyrgyn in will and deed / and never consented to the sin
of the flesh / And on a day he made his prayers deuoutely before an image of
our lady and he put a ring upon her fyngre and promised to her feythfully
never to have other wife / but only her during his life / and humbly grette our
lady with these four words / Aue maria gracia plena / which words were
wryton on the said ring / and his host had a daughter that labored gretely
to make Saint edmond to sin with her flesshely / and long time he put her of
/ and she labored so sore / that at the last he granted her to come to his
bed / and then she was right glad / and she espied her time and came to his
chamber / and anon made her ready to come to his bed / and she stood naked
tofore him and then he took a sharp rod and beat the maid that the blood
ran down on every side of her body / and said to her / thus thou shalt learn
to lose thy soul / for the foul lusts of thy flesh / and so with betyng
he put aweye all her foul lust / and ever after she lived a clean vyrgyne
unto her lives end / And sone after the good mother sent for edmonde and her
other children / For she knew that she should shortly pass out of this world
/ and charged edmond to see that his brother and susters should be well guyded /
and after she gave to them her blessyng and departed out of this world / and is
buried at abendon in saint nycholas church in a tomb of marble before the
rode / where is writon / here lies mabely flower of wydowes / and after saint
edmond did do make a chapel at gatesby / in which both his susters were
buried / and one of them was pryoresse of the place or she deyed / and was an
holy woman for whom god showed many miracles / and saint edmond dwelled long
after at oxenford living an holy life and weryd a sherte of heir full of hard
knottes and a breche of the same / and the knottes stacke in the flesh that
it made his body to blede / and he bond the sherte to his body with a cord
so strayte that uneath he might bow his body / and on a time when his sherte
of heir was right foul / he took it to his servant for to brenne in the
fire / but the fire might not perysshe ne hurt hit / Then his servant took
it out of the fire and bond a stone thereto / and threw it in to a ponde / and
told his master that he had bren^e hit Saint edmond and his felawes on a day
as they came fro lewkenor to abendon saw in a valeye many black fowls like
crows or ravens / emonge whom was one which was al to rent and torn with
the other black birds / and threw him fro one to another / that it was a
pytous sight to see / and they that accompanied saint edmond were almost fro
them self for fere of the sight / but then saint edmond comforted them / and
said to them what it mente / he said that thy se been wicked fendes of hell /
that bear with them a mannys soul / which deyed right now at chalfgraue /
which soul is dampened for his wicked living / and then he and his felawes
went to chalfegraue and fond all thing as he had said / Saint edmond was
acustomed to say every day unto our lady and saint Johan theuangelyste the
prayer / o intemerata and on a day for certain business that he had he forgate
hit / and said it not / Wherefore saint Johan apperyd to him in a gastful manner
blamyng him gretely for that he had not said it / and after that he said it
every day unto his lives end / and after this as he satte in a night in his
study labouryng in diverse of the seven scyences the spirit of his mother
apperyd to him in a vysyon and charged him to leave to study in partyculer
sciences / but that he should fro than forthon labor in dyuynyte only / for
that was the will of god and has sent to the word by me / And this said she
vanysshed aweye / and ever after he labored in dyuynyte / so that he proffyted
therein merueyllously so that men wonderd of his connyng And when he radde in
scoles dyuynyte his scolers and herars prouffyted more in one day / then they
did of other mennys techyng an hole weke / And many of his scolers by his
techyng and ensau^ple of living forsook the world and became relygyous men /
and on a day he came to the scole for to dyspute of the blessed trynyte / and
was there or any of his scolers came / and fyl in slombryng syttyng in his
chayer / and a white dowue brought him the body of our lord and put it in to
his mowthe and the dowue assendyd up in to heaven ageyn / and ever after said
Edmond thought that the sweet savor of our lords flesh was in his mowthe /
by which he knew great pryuytees of our lord in heaven / For he passyd all
the doctors in oxenford in connyng / For he spoke more like an aungel than a
man / and in all his lessons he remembered ever our lords passion / and in a
night as he studied long in his books / suddenly he fyl a sleep and forgate
to bless him and to think on the passion of our lord / and anon the devil
lay so heavy on him / that he might not bless him with neither hand / and
wist not what to do / but thorugh the grace of god he remembrid his blessed
passion / and then the fend had no more power but fyl down from him anon /
and saint edmond then charged the fend by the virtue of our lords passion /
to tell to him how he should best deffende him / that he should have no power
over him / and then the fend answered and ^ said that the remembrance of the
passion of our lord Ihesu christ / for when any man remembryth the passion of
Ihesu christ / I have no power over them / and ever after saint edmond had full
great devotion to the passion of our lord Ih^u christ / and was contynuelly in
holy prayers and medytacions / for all the delytes of the world was but heaviness
to him / he was a man of great alms / and often preached and edefyed the people
/ and all the people had great devotion to here him /

In that time the pope sent out a croysye against the turks and mescreauntes
in to england / and this holy man edmond was chosen to publysshe it thorugh the
royame / and he styred much people to receive the croysye / and to goo to the
holy land to fight against the enemies of god / and as a young man came with
other for to receive the cross / a woman that louyd him let him of his
purpoos / and drew him aweye fro thens with her hondes and anon her hands
were made styff and hard as a lord and also crokyd / And then she made
great sorrow and cried god mercy full mekely and prayed saint edmond to pray
for her to ou^ lord / and he said to her woman will thou take the cross / and
she said ye sir full feign / and then she received it / and anon was made
parfytely hool / and she thanked god and saint edmonde / and for this miracle
much the more people took the cross / And in a time as this holy man preached
at oxenforde in the chyrcheyerde of al halowen and much people being there to
here him / Sodeynlye the weder changed and wexe all derke in such wise that
the people were aghast and aferde / and began fast to flee aweye fro the sermon
/ and this holy man said to the people / abide ye stylle here / For the power of
god is strenger then the fendes power / For this he does for envy to
dystrouble gods word / And then saint edmonde lift up his hands and his
mind to almighty god and besoughte him of his mercy and grace / and when he
had ended his oryson and his prayer / the weder began to with draw by that
other side of the church yerde / and al they that abode stylle and meuyd not /
but herd the prechyng / had not one drop of rain / and they that went
aweye fro the prechyng / were thorugh wette / for there fyl so much rain in
the high street / that men might not goo ne ride therein / Wherefore the people
thanked god and his holy saint for this miracle / And at wynchester another
time as he preched there was showed a like miracle / for there he chaced aweye
such a dark wether by his holy prayer /

After for his blessed living he was chosen to be an high chanon of Salys
burye / and by the chappyter was made common tresorer / where he lived full
blessydly in gyuyng alms largely unto the pour people in so much that
uneath he kept any thing for him self / for which cause he went to the
abbay of stanley / and soiourned there till his rentys came in / and the abbot
named master stephen laxton was sometime his scoler in oxenford / he was a man
of great abstynence and ete so little mete that men wondered whereby he lived he
ete but selde flesh / Fro shroftyde till ester he would ete no thing that
suffered death / ne in aduent he ete never but lent mete / and when
tharchebisshop of cau^terburye was deed / he was elect and chosen by all the
couente to be their bishop / which election was sent to him by three
messagers to salysburye^ / But then he was at calue which was a prebende of
his / and was solitarye in his chamber allone in his prayers / and one of his
chapeleyns came to him and told to him that he was chosen to be archebysshop
of caunterburye and that the messagers were comen to him for the same cause /
but saint edmonde was no thing glad of the tidings / and then the messagers
came and did their message / and delyuerd to him letters which he read and
understood and after said to the messagers I thank you of your labor and good
will / but I am no thing glad of these tidings / Notwythstondyng I will goo
to salysburye and take counceyl of my felawes in this matere / and anon as he
was come he leyde tofore the hole chappyter this matter and showed to them his
letters / and all the chapyter aduysed him to take it upon him / and he alweye
excusing him refused it to his power / but at last the bishop of salesburye
with the chappyter commanded him by virtue of obedyence that he should take it
on him / and then he humbly sore weeping agreyd to receive it / and forth with
they ladde him to the hye altar and sange deuoutely Te deum laudamus And all
the while this holy man wept full bytterly and shed many a tere / and prayed
deuoutely to our lord to have mercy on him / and besought our blessed lady and
saint Johan euangelyst / to pray for him / and to help him in his need / and
then after he was brought to caunterburye / and there in time and space was
consecrat and s^alled in to the sea of the archebysshop / And so rewlyd the
church of england / that al men spoke good of him / And he did great penance
and yaue great alms to pour people / And on a time a pour tenaunte of his
deyed / and the baylye took his best be for a mortuarye / and then the
pour wydowe which had lost her husbonde / and also her heste be / came to
this holy man saint edmonde / and compleyned to him af hye great pouerte / and
prayed him for the love of god yt he would give her ageyn her be / and he
said ye know well that the chyef lord must have the best be but if so be
that I deliver to the ageyn this be / wylt thou keep him well to my behoof
till I axe him ageyn another time / To whom she said ye sir with a good will
to your pleasure / or else god deffende / and pray for you also that ye
vouchesauf to do so much grace to me a pour wretch / and then he
commanded his bailey to deliver it to her / and she kept it after to her lives
end / This holy man was mercyful to pour people / and full trewely to his power
maynteyned all the right of holy church / and the devil having ever envy on
good werkys / set a debate between the king and him / which was henry the
third sone of king Johan / which desired certain points ageyn the lybertees
of holy church / but this good archebysshop wythstood him to his power and
prayed the king to spare holy church for the love of god / and mayntene them
/ as he was bounden and had promised / but the king would not here him but
expressly did certain things against the right of the church and menaced
gretely saint edmonde / and when saint edmonde saw the king so cruel against
the church / he spoke sharply unto the king / and at last executed the
sensures against them that vexyd it / and cursed them that took aweye the
lybertees of hit / and when the king herd of this cursyng he was gretely
moeuyd against saint edmonde / how be it this holy man was ferme and constaunte
in his holy purpoos / which was ready to put his life in ieopardye for the right

Here follows the life of Saint Edmonde King and marter
IN the prouynce of England of old time were diverse kings / for the land was
departed emonge whom / there was Saint edmond king of norfolk and Suffolk /
which took his birth of the noble and ancient lygnage of the saxons / and
was fro the beginning of his first age of blessed man soft / virtuous / and
full of mekenes and kept truly the very relygyon of christian feythe / and
governed his kingdom full well to the pleasure of almighty god / In his time it
happed that two wicked tyrauntes / that one named hynguar and that other hubba
/ camen out of denmark / and arrived in the contre of northumberlonde / and
robbed and destroyed the contre / and slew the people without mercy in every
place where they came / Then the one of hem named hynguar came in to the
contre where this most christian saint edmond reigned / and understood that he
was in his flowryng age / strong and mighty in battle / and demanded of the
people / where their king was resydente / and dwelled which that was most
abydyng in a town named then eglesdon / and now is called burye / Now the
danes had all weye acustom that they would never fight battle set ne
appointed / but ever lie in a wait how they might by sleyght and deceyte
prevented fall on good christian men / and so slay and destroy them / like as
theuys lie in awayte to rob and slay good true men / wherefore when he knew
where this holy king was / he adressyd one of his knights to him for to espy
what strength he had and what people about him / and hynguar him self followed
with al his host / to the end that suddenly he should fall upon this king /
unadvised / and that he might subdue him unto his laws and commandments /
Then this said knight came to this holy king saint edmonde and made his
legacion and message in this wise / Our most drad lord by land and by see
hynguar which has subdued diverse contrees and lands in this prouynce unto
his seygnorye by strength of arms / and purposes with all his ships and
army to winter him in these marches / sends to the his commandment / that
thou Incontynente come and make allyaunce and frendshyp with him / And that
thou depart to him thy paternal tresours and rychesses / in such wise that
thou may regne under him / Or certeynly thou shall deye by cruel death /

And when the blessed king Saint Edmonde had herd this message anon he
syghed / and called to him one of his bysshoppes / and demanded counceyl of
him what and how he should answer upon this demand that was axyd of him /
which bishop sore dredyng for the kings life / exhorted him by many exaumples
for to consent and agree to this tyraunte hynguar / and the king a while said
no thing / but remembryd him well / and after many devout words at last he
answered to the messager in this wise and said / This shall thou say to thy
lord / know thou for truth / that for the love of temporal life / the christian
king edmonde shall not subdue him to a paynym duc / Then uneath was the
messager gone out / but hynguar met him / and bad him use short words / and
tell him his answer / which message told unto hynguar / Anon the cruel
tyrau^te commanded to slay all the people that were with saint edmonde / and
destroy them / but they should hold and keep only the king / whom he knew
rebelle unto his wicked laws / Then this holy king was taken / and bounden
his hands behind him / and is brought tofore the duc / and after many
obprobryes words / at the last they ladde him forth unto a tree which was
thereby / To which tree his adversaries bond him / and then shot arowes at
him / so thycke / and many that he was thorugh wounded / and that one arowe
smote out another / and alweye this blessed king cessyd not for all his
wounds to give lawde and preysyng unto almighty god / Then this wicked
tyraunte commanded / that they should smite of his heed / which they so did he
alwey prayeng and saying his orysons to our lord god / Then the danes left
the body there lyeng / and took the head and bare it in to the thycke of the
wood and hyd it in the thyckest place emonge thorns and brerys / to the end
that it should not be founden of the christian men but by the purueaunce of
almighty god there came a wulfe / which dylygently kept the holy head fro
deuowryng of beestys and fowls / And after when the danes were departed the
christian men fond the body / but they could not find the heed wherefore they
sought it in the wood / and as one of them spoke to another / where art thou /
which were in the thycke of the (...) / and cried where art thou / (...) heed
answered and said here / here / here / and anon then all they came thither
and saw it / and also a great wulfe syttyng and enbracyng the heed between his
forleggys / keeping it fro all other beestys / and then anon they took the
heed and brought it unto the body / and set it to the place where it was
smyten of / and anon they joined to gyder / and then they bare this holy
body unto the place where it is now buried / and the wulfe followed humbly the
body till it was buried / and then he hurtyng no body returned ageyn to the
wood / and the blessed body and heed ben so joined to gyder / that there
apperyth no thing that it had be smyten of / saufe as hit were a reed shynyng
threde in the place of the departing where the heed was smyten of / and in that
place where he now lies so buried / is a noble monastarye made / and therein
monks of the order of saint benette / which been richely endowed / In which
place almighty god has showed many miracles for this holy king and marter

Thus ends the life and passion of saint edmond king and marter

like wise was she moeuyng by besy operacion / round by perseuerau^ce / and
brennyng by fyry charity /

Of saint Cecillye
Saint cecillye the holy vyrgyn was comen of the noble lygnage of the Romans /
and fro the time that she lay in her cradle she was fostrid and nourisshed in
the feythe of christ / and all weye bare in her breast the gospel hyd / and
never cessyd day ne night from holy prayers but recommaunded to god all weye
her vyrgynyte / and when this blessed vyrgyne should be spoused to a young man
named valeryan / and the day of weddyng was comen / and was cladde in ryal
clothes of gold / but under she ware the hair / and she heeryng the organes
making melodye she sange in her heart only to god saying O lord I beseech the
that mine heart and body may be vndefowled so that I be not confounded / and
every second and third day she fasted commendyng her self unto our lord whom
she dredde / the night came that she should goo to bed with her husbond as the
custom is / and when they were both in their chamber allone / she said to him
in this manner / O my best beloved and sweet husbond / I have a counceyll to
tell the / if so be that thou wylt keep it secret / and swear that ye shall
bewreye it to no man / to whom valeryan said / that he would gladly promise and
swear never to bewreye it / and then she said to him I have an aungel that
loves me / which ever keeps my body whether I sleep or wake and if he may
find that ye touch my body by vylonye or foul and pollute love / certeynly
he shall anon slay you and so should ye lose the flower of your yongthe / and if
so be that thou love me in holy love and clennesse / he shall love the as he
loves me and shall show to the his grace / Then valeryan corrected by the
will of god having dread said to her / if thou will that I believe that thou
say to me / show to me that aungel that thou spekest of and if I find
verytable that he be the aungel of god / I shall do that thou say / and if so
be that thou love another man than me / I shall slay both him and the with my
sword / Cecylle answered to him if thou wylt believe and baptyse the / thou
shall well now see him / goo then forth to via appia which is three mile out
of this town and there thou shall find pope urban with pour folks / and
tell him these words that I have said / and when he has purged you fro sin
by baptesme / then when ye come ageyn ye shall see the aungel / and forth
went valeryan and fond this holy man vrbane lowtyng emonge the buryellys / to
whom he reported the words that cecylle had said / and saint vrbane for joy
began hold up his hand and let the teerys fall out of his eyes / and said o
almighty god Ihesu crist sower of chaast counceylle and keeper of us all /
Receive the fruit of the seed / that thou have sown in cecyllye / For like a
besy be she seruyth the For the spouse whom she has taken which was like a
wode lion / She has sent him hither like as a meke lamb / and with that word
apperyd sodeynlye an old man y cladde in white clothes / holdyng a book written
with letters of gold / Whom Valeryan seeing for fere fyl (...) to the ground
as he had been deed / Whom the old man raised and took up and read in this
wise / One god one feythe / one baptesme / One god and fader of all / abouen
all / and in us all every where /

And when this old man had read this / he said byleuest thou this or dou test
thou it say ye or nay / Then valeryan cried saying / there is no thing trewer
under heaven / then vanysshed this old man aweye / Then valeryan received
baptesme of saint vrbane and returned home to saint cecyllye whom he fond
within / her chamber spekyng with an aungel / and this aungel had two crowns
of roses and lyles / which he held in his hand / of which he gafe one to
cecylle and that other to valeryen saying / keep ye these crowns with an
vndefowled and a clean body / for I have brought them to you fro paradyse / and
they shall never fade ne wydder / ne lose their savor / ne they may not be seen
but of them to whom chastyte pleasyth / and thou valeryan by cause thou have
used prouffytable counceyl / demand what thou wylt / To whom valeryan said
There is no thing in this world to me lever then my brother / whom I would
feign that he might know this very truth with me / to whom the aungel said
/ thy petycyon pleseth our lord / and ye both shall come to him by the palm of
marterdom / and anon tyburce his brother came and entryd in to this chamber /
and anon he felt the sweet odor of the roses and lylyes / and meruaylled fro
whens it came / Then valeryan said we have crowns which thyn eyes may not
see and like as by my prayers have felt the odor of them / so if thou wylt
believe / thou shall see the crowns of roses and lylyes that we have / Then
cecyllye and valeryan began to preche to tyburcyen of the joy of heaven / and
of the foul creaunce of paynyms / the abusyon of ydolles / and of the paynys
of hell which the dampened suffer and also they preached to him of the
Incarnacion of our lord and of his passion / and did so much that Tyburcyen
was converted and baptized of saint vrbane / and fro than forthon he had so
much grace of god that every day he saw aungellys / and all that ever he
required of our lord be opteyned / After almachyus prouoste of rome / which put
to death many christian men / herd say that tyburcyen and valeryen buried christian
men that were marterd / and gafe al their good to pour people / he called them
tofore him / and after long dysputacion he commanded that they should goo to
the statue or image of Iubyter for to do sacrefyse / or else they should be
byheded / and as they were led they preached the feyth of our lord to one
called maxyme / that they converted him to the christian feyth / and they
promised to him that if he had very repentance and ferme creau^ce that he
should see the glory of heaven / which their sowles should receive at hour of
their passions / and that he him self should have the same if he would believe /
Then maximus gate leave of the tormentours for to have them home to his hows /
and the said maxymus with all his howsholde / and all the tormentours were
turned to the feyth / then came saint cecyllye thither with preestys and
baptized them / and afterward when the morning came saint cecylye said to them
/ Now ye knights of crist / cast aweye fro you the works of derknes and
clothe you with the arms of light / and then they were led four mile out
of the town / and brought to fore thymage of Iupyter / but in no wise they
would do sacrefyse ne encence to thydolle / but humbly with great devotion
knelyd down and there were byheded / and saint cecylye took their bodies and
buried them then maxymus that saw this thing said that he saw in the hour
of their passion angels clear shynynge / and her sowles ascend in to heaven
which the angels bare up / wherefore many were converted to the christian feythe
/ and when almache herd that maxyme was cristened / he did do beat him with
plommettes of leed so long till be gave up his spyryte and deyed / whose body
Saint Cecyllye buried by valeryan and Tyburcyan / and after almache commanded
that cecylye should be brought unto his presence for to do sacrefyse to Iubyter
and she so preached to them that came for her that she converted them to the
fryth which wept sore / that so fair a maid and so noble should be put to death
/ then she said to them / o ye good young men it is no thing to lose the
yongthe / but to change hit / that is to give claye and take therefore gold /
To give a foul habytacle and take a precious / To give a little corner and to
take a right great place / God rewards for one simple / an hundred fold /
believe ye this that I have said And they said / we believe christ to be very
god which has such a servant / then saint vrbane was called and four
hundred and moo were baptized / Then almachyus calling tofore him saint
cecylye said to her / of what condycyon art thou / and she said that she was
of a noble kynrede / To whom almachyus said / I demand the of what relygyon
art thou / then cecyle said / then begannest thou thy demand folyly that
would have two answers in one demand / To whom almach^ said / Fro whens
comes thy rude answer / and she said / of good conscience and feyth not feigned
/ To whom almachyus said / know thou not of what power I am / and she said
thy power is little to dread / for it is like a bladder full of wind / which
with the pryckkyng of a nedle is anon goon aweye and come to naught / To whom
almache said / in wrong beganst thou and in wrong thou perseueryst / know
thou not how our princes have given me power to give life and to slay / and she
said now shall I prove the a liar against the very truth / Thou may well
take the life fro them that live / but to them that been deed thou may give no
life / Therefore thou art a mynystre / not of life / but of death / To whom
almachyus said now lay a part thy madness / and do sacrefyse to the gods /
To whom cecyllye said / I wot never where thou have lost thy sight / for
them that thou say hen gods / we see them stones put thyn hand / and by
touching thou shall learn that which thou may not see with thyn eyes /
Then almachyus was wroth and commanded her to be ladde in to her hows / and
there to be burnt in a brennyng bayne which her seemed was a place cold and
well attemperyd / then almachyus heryng that / commmaunded that she should be
byheded in the same bath / Then the tormentour smote at her three strokes /
and could not smite of her heed / and the fourth stroke he might not by the
law smite / and so left her there lyeng half a live / and half deed and she
lived three days after in that manner / and gave all that she had to pour people
/ and contynuelly preached the faith all that while / and all them that she
converted she sent to vrbane for to be baptized / and said I have axed respyte
three days that I might commend to you these sowles / And that ye should halowe
of mine hows a church / and then at the end of three days she slepte in our
lord and saint vrbane with his dekenes buried her body emonge the bysshoppes /
and hallowed her hows into a church / In which unto this day is said the
service unto our lord / She suffered her passion about the year of our lord two
hundred and xxiij in the time of alexaunder the emperor and it is read in
another place / that she suffered in the time of marcij aurelij which reigned
about the year of our lord two hundred and twenty Then let us deuoutelye
pray unto our lord that by the merytes of this holy vyrgyne and marter saint
cecyly we may come to his everlasting bliss in heaven amen /

Thus ends the life of Saint Cecillye virgyne and marter
Here follows the life of saint clemente Pope and marter and first of his name
CLemente is said of cleos / that is glory / and men's that is mind / as it
were a glorious mind he had a glorious mind purged fro al fylihe / ornate
with all virtue / and decorate with al felycyte or he is said of clemence /
which is mercyful / It is said in the glosarye that clemente is said rightwys
/ sweet ripe / and meke / rightwys in deed sweet in speech / ripe in
conuersacyon / and meke in Intencion / his life he him self set in his book
named Itynerarye / specially unto that place / which he succeeded to saint
peter in the papacye / The remenaunte of his acts that comynly been had / been
taken in diverse places /

Of saint clemente Pope
CLement the bishop was borne of the lignage of the romans / and his fader
was named faustyn and his mother matydyan / he had two brethern / of whom that
one was named faustyn and that other faustynyen / and mathydyane was of
meruayllous beauty / her husbondes brother brennyd in the love of her by the
dysordynate concupyscence of luxurye / and daily he vexyd her in desyryng her
to accord to his foul lust but she in no wise would consent to him / and she
doubted to show it to her husbond / by cause there should no debate ne enemyte
fall between the brethern / Then she thought to absente her by sum mean
fro him so long that he should forgete this dysordynate love / for the sight
of her presence set him a fire / and by cause she might have license of her
husbond she feigned a dreme subtylly / which she told to her husbond in this
wise saying / There is a vysyon comen to me this night / by which I am
commanded to depart out of this cytee of rome with my two sons faustyn and
faustynyen / and that I should abide out so long / till I were commanded to
return / and if I did not I should deye and my children also / and when her
husbond herd this he was sore abassled and aferde / and sent his wife and his
two sons to athenes with much other meyne / and that she should abide there /
and se^te her sons to scole / and the fader held clemente at home with him
which was the left and was but v year old for his solas / and as the mother
sailed on the sea with her sons there roos a great tempeste / and brought the
ship to wrack / and was all to broken / and the mother was thrown by the
waw^s of the sea upon a roche and escaped wenyng that her two sons had be
perisshed / and for sorrow and dyscomforte would have drowned her self in the sea / if she had not had hope to find her sons / and wha^ she saw that she
could not find them alive ne deed / she cried and brayed strongely and bote
her hands / and would not be comforted of no body / and then came to her many
wymmen / which told to her the fortunes that they had had / but she was
comforted by none / and emonge the other there came one that said that she had
lost her husbond a young man in the sea and that she would never after be
married for the love of him / and she comforted her / how it was and dwellid
with her / and gate daily their living with their hands / but anon after her
hands that she had beten becam so sore and braken out / that she might not
work and s^e that herberowed her had the palseye and might not rise out of her
bed / and thus was mathidyan constreyned to beg and axe her living fro door
to door / and of such as she could get she fed her self and her hostess
and when the year was passed that she was departed with her children / her
husbond sent messagers to athenes for to know how they did / but them that he
sent returned not / and he sent other messagers after Which returned and said
that they had found none / and then he left clemente his sone under the
keeping of certain tutours and went for to seek his wife and his children / and
took his shyppyng but he came not ageyn /

And thus clemente was xx year orphalyn / and never had tidings of fader ne
mother / ne of his bro^^ern / and he went to study / and became a souerayn
phylosophre / and desired / and inquired dylygently / in what manner he might
know the Inmortalyte of the soul / and therefore haunted he often the scoles of
phylosophye / and when he herd that it was concluded in the dysputacyon that
the soul was Inmortal he was glad and joyous / And when they said that it was
mortal / he went al heavy and confused / and at the last when barnabe came to
rome prechyng the feythe of Ih^u criste the phylosophres mocqued him as he had
been mad or out of his wit and as sum say clemente was the first
phylosophre that mocqued him and despised his predycacion / and in scorn put
to him this questyon saying / what is the cause that culex which is a little
be has vj feet / and two wings / and an olyphaunte which is a great be
has but four feet and no wings / To whom barnabas said / Fool I might
lyghtelye answer to thy questyon if thou demau^dest it to know the troth / but
it should be a rude and a deef thing to say to you any thing of creatures /
when ye know not the maker of the creatures and by cause ye know not the
creator of al / it is right that ye err in the creatures / This word went
much to the heart of clement the phylosophre in such wise that he was
informed of barnabe in the feythe of Ihesu christ / and went anon in to Iudee
to saint Peter / which taught him the feyth and showed to him clearly
thynmortalyte of the soul all clearly / and in that time simon thenchauntour
had two dysciples / that is to wete aquyle and nycete / and when they
understood and knew his fallaces / they forsook and left him / and fled to
Saint Peter and were his dyscyples / Then saint peter demanded of clemente
of what lygnage he was / and he told to him al by order what was happened to
his fader / to his mother / and to his brethern / and said that he supposed that
his mother with his brethern was drowned in the sea / and that his fader was
deed for sorrow or drowned also in the sea / and when saint Peter herd this he
might not keep him from weeping / On a time peter came in to the isle where
mathydyan the mother of clemente dwelled / in which isle were pylers of glass of
meruayllous length / and as saint peter beheld these pylers he saw mathydyan
beggyng / whom he blamed by cause she labored not with her hands / and she
answered and said sir I have no thing but the form and lykenes of my hands /
For they ben so febled by my bytynge that I feel them not / and me repents
that I drowned not my self in the sea / that I should no longer have lived / Tho
peter said what say thou woman / know thou not that the sowles of them
that slay them self been most grievously punysshed / To whom she said would god
that I were certain that sowles should live after the death / For then would I
slay my self / to the end that I might but one hour see my sweet children /
and when peter had demanded of her the cause and that she had told to him all the order of the things done / Then peter said there is a young man with us
named clemente which says like as thou say / that it so happed to his fader
and mother and to his brethern / and when she herd that / she was smyton with
so great wonder that she fyl / and when she was comen to her self / she said
weeping to saint Peter I am certeynlye mother of that young man / and knelyng
down tofore saint peter she prayed him that he would haste lie show to her her
sone / and peter said to her / / abide a while till we be out of this isle / and
when they were out of the isle / Peter took her by the hand / and brought her
to the ship where clemente was in / and when chement saw peter holdyng the
woman by the hand / he began to laughe / and anon as this woman was nyghe by
clemente / she might absteyne her no longer / but enbraced him about the neck
and kyssed him / and he put her a back / like as she had been frantyke / and
was much angrye against peter / And peter said to him what someuer thou do
/ put thou not aweye thy mother / and when c^emente herd that anon he began to
weep / and aduysed him and took up his mother which was fallen down a swowne /
and began to know her / and that thostesse that lay on the palseye was
brought forth by the commandment of Peter / and he helyd her anon / and
then the mother demanded clemente of his fader / and he said to her that he
went to seche her / and that he sithe never saw him / and when she herd that
she syghed and comforted her other sorrows by the great joy that she had of
her sone In the mean while nycete and aquylle came which were not there when
she came / and when they saw this woman / they inquired what she was / Then
clemente said she is my mother whom god has given to me by my lord Peter /
Then peter told to them al by order / and when nycete and aquylle herd that
/ they aroos and were al abashed and said / lord maker of al things / is this
true that we have herd or is it a dreme / Then Peter said to them / if ye
be not out of your mind / these things been all true / Then said they we
ben faustyn and faustynyen whom our mother had supposed had been perysshed in
the sea / and then the mother ran and enbraced them about the neck / and
said what may this be / and peter said these been thy sons faustyn and
faustynyen / whom thou supposedest had been perysshed in the sea / and when she
herd that she fyl donn a swowne for joy / And when she was comen ageyn to her
self she said to them say ye to me how ye escaped / and they said when our ship
was broken / we were borne upon a table / and other maronners fond us and took
us in to their ship / and changed our names / and sold us to a woman named
Iustyne / which has holden us as her sons / and has made us to learn the
arts lyberalle / and after we learned phylosophye / and sithe we joined us unto
simon an enchauntour / which has be nourisshed with us / and when we knew
his fallaces we left him all / and were maad dysciples of peter / and the
next day following peter with his three dysciples clemente / nycete and aquyle
went in to a more secret place for to pray / and a much ancient and
honorable man but night pour was there / and began to resonne and say to
them / I have pity on you brethern / For under the lykenes of pity I consider
you gretelye to err / for there is no god / ne none worshyppyng here / ne no
prouydence in the world / but fortune only of engendrure and hap does al /
like as I have founden expertely of my self in the sea / which was informed in
the dysciplyne of mathesys more than many other / then pray ye no more for
whether ye pray or pray no^ / that which is ordained to you by destyne shall
fall / and clemente beheld him and his heart iuged that he had seen him
tofore time / and when clemente aquyle and nycete had long disputed with him
by the commandment of peter / and they had showed to him what prouydence was
/ by open resons and for reverence called him o^te fader aquyle said what need
have we to call him fader / when we have in commandment / that we ought to
call no man fader upon earth / and he h^helde this ancient man and said /
thou hold the Iniuryed fader by cause I blamed my brother that called the
fader / We have in commandment / that we should call no man by such name /
and when he had said so al they of the company laughed / and he axed them why
they laughed / and clemente said thou do that / for which thou blamest
other / in calling this old man fader / And when they had enough dysputed of
prouydence / The old man said / I had well byleuyd prouydence / but mine own
conscience denies me it / that I may not believe it / I know my destyne and my
wives / and that which fortune has destyned is ordained to each body Now
harken ye what fortune happed to my wife / she had in her natyuyte mars with
Venus upon the center / and the moon wanynge in the hows of Mars / and ends of
saturn / And this adventure makes the aduoultrers to break their wedloke /
and to love their servants / and to goo with them in to strange contreyes /
and to be drowned in waters / and so is it fallen by my wife / for she fyl in
the love of her servant / and fled with him / and perysshed in the sea /
for as my brother has recounted to me / she loved him first / and he would not
consent to her / and then she turned her lecherous love in her servant /
and it ought not to be laid any blame in her / for her destynee has made her
to do so / And then he told how she feigned a dreme / and how in sayllyng
toward Athenes she perysshed / And then his sons would have run to him and
have dyscouerd the matere but Peter deffended them and said suffer ye till it
plese me / and then peter said to him / if I show to the this day thy wife
right chaast with thy three sons / wylt thou believe that destyne is no thing /
and he said like as it is a thing Impossyble to show that thou have promised
/ So Impossyble is it to do any thing above destynee / And then said Peter
/ this is Clemente thy sone / and these two been thy two sons faustyn and
faustynyen Then the old man fyl down for joy as he had been without soul /
Then his sons came unto him and kyssed him / and were aferde that he should
not have comen to him self ageyn / and when his swownyng was goon / he herd of
them all by order / how all thing had happened / Then his wife came
sodeynlye and began to cry / and weep strongely saying / O my husbond and my
lord / where is he / and this said she as she had been al fro her self / and
the old man that heeryng ran to her and enbracyd her straynyng with great
weeping and then as they thus were dwelling to gyder / there came a messager
that told how that apyon and anubyon which were great friends unto this old
man faustynyan / were lodgyd with Simon magus / of whom this old man was
much glad and went to vysyte them / and forthwyth came a messager / which
said that there was comen a mynystre of the^perours unto antyoche and sought
all the enchauntours for to punysshe them to death / Then simon magus by
cause he hated the sons of faustynyen by cause they forsook him / he enprynted
his symylytude and likeness in this old man faustynyan / in such wise that
of every man he was supposed to be Simon magus / and this did simon magus by
cause he should be taken of the mynystres of the emperor and be slain instead
of him / and simon then departed fro tho parties / and when this old
faustynyan came ageyn to saint peter and to his sons / The sons were abashed
which saw in him the symylitude and likeness of simon magus / and understood
the voys of their fader / but saint Peter saw the naturell likeness of him /
and his wife and his sons blamed and repreuyd him / and he said wherefore blame
ye me / and flee fro me / that am your fader / and they said we flee fro the /
by cause the lykenes of simon magus apperyth in the / Now this simon had
composed an oynemente / and enoynted him with al / and had enprynted the form
of him self by art magyke in this old man / which wept and said / what
myshappe alas is fallen to me / I have but one day be known of my wife and of
my children / and may not be ioyeful with them / and his wife and his children
wept sore and tare their here / and simon magus when he was in antyoche
deffamed strongely saint peter / and said that he was a cursed enchauntour and
an homycide / and had so moeuyd the people against peter / that they purposed to
slay him if they might ones hold him / and then said saint peter to this
old faustynyen by cause thou art like and semest simon magus / goo forth in
to antioche and excuse me tofore all the people of such things as simon him
self has said of me / and after I shall come in to antioche / and shall take
from the this strange likeness / and shall give to the ageyn thy propre and
naturel symylytude tofore all the people / but it is not to suppose that saint
peter bad him to lie / for god has no need of lesynges And then should the
book of clement called Iteneraryum be appocryphum as who says of none
auctorite / in which these things ben wryton / and ought not to be taken in
such things but as it pleases to sum men / Nevertheless it may be said /
if these words be dylygently consyderyd that he should say that he were simon
magus / but that he should show to the people the semblaunce of Simon magus
vysage showing saint peter in the person of simon and should revoke the words
that he had said / and if he said that he was simon / that was not as towchyng
the truth / But unto the appearance and likeness / Then fastynyen said I am
Simon as who says I am like unto Simon and was supposed to be simon of the
people / Then this old man faustynyen went in to antyoche and assemblyd she
people and said / I Simon show to you and confess that I have deceived you of
all that I have said of Peter thappostle / for he is no traytre ne enchauntour
but is sent for the health of the world / wherefore if ever I herafter shall say
any thing against him / that ye take me as a trayter and wicked and put me
aweye fro you for I do now penance for that I knowleche me to have said
falsely and evil of him / I warn you therefore that ye believe in him / that ye
ne your cite perysshe not / and when he had said this that peter had commanded
him and had styred the people in to the love of peter / saint peter came to him
and made his prayer / and after took aweye fro him the lykenes of simon / and
be came in his naturell likeness / Then all the people of antyoche received
debonayrlye saint Peter / and with great honor enhaunced him and set him in
a chayer as a bishop / And when simon magus herd this he came and gadred the
people to gyder and said I marvel when I have enseygned and taugkte you the
commandments of health / and have warned you that ye should keep you fro the
trayter Peter / and ye have not only herd him / but ye have enhaunced him and
have set him in the chayer of a bishop / Then all the people aroos in a
great furye against him and sayden Thou art no thing but a monstre / thou
saydest that other day / that thou repentedest of that thou had said
ageynste saint Peter / and now thou would overthrow us and thy self / And
al attones they roos against him and cast him out of the town / all these
things saint clemente tells of him self in his book / and has set in it
this hystorye / After this when saint peter came to rome / and saw that his
passion approached / he ordained clemente to be bishop after him / And when
saint peter prince of thappostles was deed / Clemente which was a man
pourueyed and t^ke head of the time to come / so that leest by his ensaumple
every bishop would chese a successor after him in the church of our lord /
and so possede the sea of god by heritage / he gave it over to live / and
afterward to clete / and after them clemente was chosen / and compellyd to
take it upon him / wherein he shone by virtuous living and good manners / that he
pleasyd well unto the Jews / christian men and paynyms / He had the pour people
wryton by name of eueryche relygyon / for to give to them their necessyte / he
louyd much pour people / and them that he sayntefyed by baptesme / he suffryd
them not to beg comynly / and when he had sacred a damoysel with a veylle
which was a vyrgyne and nece of domycien the emperor / and had converted to
the feyth Theodore wife of sysynne friend of the emperor / and she had promised
to be in purpose of chastyte / Sysynne had doubt of his wife / and entered after
her in to the church preuyly for to know what she used to do there / and
when saint clemente had said the orryson / and the people had answered amen /
Sysynne was made deef and blind / and he said to his servants bring me hens
and led me out / and they led him round about the church and could not
come to the doors ne gates / and when theodore saw them erryng so / she
went to the first door wenyng that her husbond had known her / and after she
axed of the servants / what they did / And they said to her / our master
would here and see that was not leeful / and therefore he is maad both blind
and deef / And then sle gafe her self to prayer and prayed god that her
husbonde might goo out fro thens / and after her prayers she said to the
servants goo ye hens and bring my lord home to his hows / and they went and
brought him thither / and theodore went unto saint clemente and told to him
what was happened / and then this holy man came to him / and fond his eyes
open / but he saw not ne herd no thing Then saint clemente prayed for him
and anon he received his sight and his heeryng / and when he saw clemente
stondyng by his wife he was wode / and supposed that he had been Illuded by art
magyke / and commanded his servants to hold fast Clemente / he has made
me blind by art magyke / for to come to my wife / and commanded to his
mynystres that they should bind clemente / and so draw him / and they bond
the pylors and stones / wenyng to sysynne that they had bounden saint clemente
and his werkys / and drawn them forth / Then clemente said to sysynne / by
cause thou worshyppest stones for gods and trees / therefore have thou
deseruyd to draw stones and trees / and he which supposed him to be bounden
verayly said I shall do slay the / and then clemente departed / and he prayed
theodore that she should not cesse to pray till that our lord had vysyted her
husbond / Then saint peter apperyd to theodore prayeng / ande said to her Thy
husbond shall be saved by the / for to accomplysshe that / that poule my brother
says / The man myscreaunte shall be saved by his true wife / And this saying he
vanysshed aweye and anon sysynne called his wife to him / and prayed her to
pray for him and that she should call to him saint clemente / and when he was
comen he was Instruct in the feythe and was baptized with three hundred and
xiij of his main / and many noble men and friends of the emperor byleueden in
our lord by this sysynne / Then the earl of the sacrefyses gave much money
and moeuyd great treson and dyscorde against saint clemente / Then mamertyn
prouoste of the cite of rome might not suffer this dyscorde but made saint
clemente to be brought tofore him / and as he repreuyd and assayed to draw him
to his law / clemente said to him I would well rather that thou would come to
reason For if many dogs have barked against us / and have byten us / yet they
may not take fro us but that we be men reasonable / and they ben hounds
dysresonable / This dyscencyon which is moeuyd it shewyth that it has no
certain ne truth / and then mamertyn wrote unto traian emperor of clemente
/ and he had answer that he should do sacrefyse / or to be exyled in to the
deserte that was beyond the cite over the sea / Then the prouoste said to
him weeping / thy god whom thou worshyppest purely / he help the / Then the
prouoste delyuerd to him a ship and all thing necessary to him / and many
clerks and lay people followed him in exyle / and the prouoste fond in that
isle moo than ij thousand people christian / which had been long there dampened
for to hew the marble / in the roches / and anon when they saw saint
clemente they began to weep and he comforted them and said Our lord has not
sent me hither by my merytes / but he has made me partyner of your crown /
And when he understood of them that they fette water six mile thens and bare
it upon their sholdres / he said to them let us al pray unto our lord that he
opene to us his confessors in this place here the veins of a fontayn or of a
well / and that he that smote the stone in deserte of Synay / and water flowed
haboundantlye / he give to us re^nyng water / so that we may be enjoyed of his
benefaytes / and when he had made his prayer he looked here and there and saw a
lamb stondyng which lift up his right foot and showed a place to the bishop
/ and he understanding that it was our lord Ihesu crist / whom he only saw /
and went to the place and said / In the name of the fader and of the sone /
and of the holy ghooste smite in this place / and when he saw that no man would
smite in the place where the lamb stood / he took a litel pykoys and smote one
stroke lightelye in the place under the foot of the lamb and anon a well or
a fontayn sprange up and grew in to a great flode / Then unto al them ioyeng
saint clemente said / the coming of the flode gladeth the cite of god / and for
the fame of this miracle much people came thither / and five hundred and moo
received baptesme of him in one day / and they destroyed the temples of
thydolles thorugh all that prouynce / and within one year they edefyed lxxv
chyrches / to the honor of our lord / and three year after Traiane the
emperor under stondyng this / which was the year of our lord lxvj / and sent
thither a duc and when this duc saw that al they would gladly deye for gods
love / he left the multitude and took only clemente and bond an ancre about
his neck / and threw him in to the sea / and said / Now they may not worship
him for a god / and all that great multitude of the people went to the ryuage of
the sea and beheld the cruelte of the tyraunte / and then cornelye and
phoebus dysciples of saint clemente commanded to all the other to pray to our
lord that he would show to them the body of his marter / and anon the sea
departed three mile weye far / So that all they might goo dry foot thither /
and there they fond an habytacle in a temple of marble which god had made and
ordained / and fond the body of saint clemente laid in an arc or a cheste /
and the ancre thereby / and it was showed to his dysciples that they should not
take aweye the body fro thens / Every year in the time of his passion the sea
departed by seven days during four mile far / which gafe dry weye to them
that came thither / In one of the solempnytees there was a woman went thither
with a litel child / and when the solempnyte of the feste was accomplysshed
the child slepte / and the noise and sown of the water was herd which came
and approached fast / and the woman was abashed and forgate her child and
fled unto the ryuage with the great multitude of people / and afterward she
remembrid her sone / and began strongely to cry and weep / and ran hither
and thither brayeng by the ryuage / for to know if by adventure the body of her
sone might be cast upon the ryuage / and when she saw no socour / ne no hope
/ she returned home and was all that year in weeping and in heaviness / and the
year after following when the sea was departed / and the weye opene / she ran
tofore all the other / and came to the place for to know if by adventure she
might have any knowleche or find any thing of her sone / and when she knelyd
down tofore the tomb of saint clemente / and had made her prayers she aroos up
and saw her sone in the place / where she had left him slepyng / Then she
supposed be had been deed / and went nerre for to have taken the body as it had
be without life / but when she saw him slepyng / she awook him and took him in
her arms tofore all the people al hool and saufe / and inquired of him where
he had been all that year / and he said that he wyste not / but that he had
slepte there but one night swetely Saint ambrose says in his preface in this
wise / when the most wicked persecutour was constrained of the devil for to
tormente by pains the blessed clemente / he gafe to him no pain but vyctorye /
The marter was cast in the flodde for to be drowned / and therefore came he to
a good reward / by which peter his master came in to heaven / Christ
approuyng the minds of them both in the flodes / he called clemente fro the
bottom of the sea to the palm of vyctorye / and he releuyd saint peter in the
same element that he should not be drowned unto the heavenly / royame / Lion the
bishop of hostyence recounteth that in the time that mychel the Emperor
governed the empire of rome / a priest named phylosophre came to tersone / and
demanded of them that dwelled in the contre of the things that been reherced
in the hystorye of saint clemente / and by cause they had not be of that time
but were strange they said that they knew no thing thereof / For for the
sin of them of the country that dwelled in that place the water had long
cessyd for to with draw as it was woned to do / In the time of martyn the
emperor the church had be destroyed of the barbaryns / and the arc with the
body of the marter was wrapped in the flodes of the sea for the sin of them
that dwelled there / and then the priest was al admeruaylled of these things
/ and came unto a litel cite named georgye / and went with the bishop and the
clerks with the people for to seche the holy relyques of the isle / where as
they supposed that the body of the holy marter had been / and there they dygged
and song ympnes and canticles and then by reuelacion deuyne they fond the
body of the holy saint / and the ancre by hit / which was cast in to the sea
with him / and then they bare it to tersone / and after this same priest came
to rome with the body of saint clement and there showed god many miracles for
this holy saint / and the body was laid in the church / which is now called
saint clemente / and it is read in a cronycle that the sea waxed dry in that
place / and that the blessed Cyrylle bishop of moryanne brought the holy body
unto Rome /

Then let us deuoutelye pray unto this blessed saint saint clemente that by
his merytes we may deserve to come to the bliss of heaven AMEN /

Thus ends the life of Saint Clemente
Here follows the life of saint Grysogone and first of his name
GRysogone may be said of gonos in Greek which is as much to say as aungel /
For he was without aungel of worldly malice / or he is said of gonos / which
is as much to say as a l^der / For he led much people to the way of a
truth by his ensaumple /

Of saint grisogone
GRisogone was taken and set in prison by the commandment of Dyoclesyan /
and saint anastase fed him and gave to him mete and drink to live by /
wherefore her husbond was put in to a strayte prison / and she sent to
grysogone which had informed her in the feythe of Ihesu crist in writing this
that follows / To the holy confessor of christ Grysogone I anastas^ have
taken the yoke of a wicked husbond / by the mercy of god I have eschewed his
bed by feigned and dyssymyled Infyrmyte / and have night and day embraced the
stappes of our lord Ihesu christ / and my husbond has taken aweye my
patrymonye / of which he is ennoblysshed / and sets it on foul ydolles /
and has put me in prison / as a cursed enchaunteresse for to make me to lose
my life temporel So there bleueth no more / but I that am servant to the
spyrite may lie down and deye / In which death I glorefye my self / but I am
gretely troubelyd in my mind / that my rychessls which I had ordained to god
/ been wasted and spente in foul things / fare well servant of god and
remember me / To whom saint grysogone answerde ageyn by writing / see that
thou be not angered ne troubled for any thing that is done to the foloneslye /
in thy life / though it be contrary unto the / thou may not be dysceyued if
thou be preuyd / a time paysyble shall come to the anon for after this derknes
thou shall see anon she florysshed light of god / and after this cold time of
froste and ice / there shall come to the the soft and sweet time / Fare well be
with god and pray for me / and as this blessed anastase was thus constreyned
in such wise that uneath any bread was given to her in four days and that
she supposed she should have deyed / She wrote a pystle to him in this wise / To
the confessor of crist grysogone / anastase / the end of my time is comen
remember me / So that when the soul shall depart from me that he receive it
for whose love I suffer these things / which thou shall here by the mowthe of
this old woman / To whom he wrote ageyn / It apperteyneth alwey that derkenes
goo tofore the light / In like wise after sekenes and Infyrmyte health shall
return and life is promised after death / All aduersytees and prosperytees of
this world been enclosed by one end / by cause desperacion should have no
domynacyon on the sorrowful / ne elacyon ne pride should not domyne on them that
been glad and ioyeful / There is but one see in which the ship of our lady
saylleth / and our sowles use the offyse of maronners under the governance of
the body / and the ships which ben fastenyd and bounden with strong chains
passen well without any brekyng thorugh the strong wawes of the sea / and sum
ships there been that have brutyl and feeble ioyntures of trees / and fall
often in peril to be drowned / but thou handmayde of Ihesu christ have in thy
mind the vyctorye of the cross / and make the ready to the work of god / and
then dyoclesyan which was in the parties of aquyle and slew other christian
men commanded that grysogone should be brought tofore him / to whom he said
Take the power of the prouoste / and the consulate of thy lygnage / and do
sacrefyse to the gods /

And he answered I adoure and worship one only god of heaven / and I despise thy
dygnytees as fylthe or mire / and then sentence was given upon him / and was
brought in to a place where he was byheded / about the year of our lord two
hundred lxxx and seven whose body saint Zeyle the priest buried and the heed
also /

Thus ends the life of Saint Grisogone
Here follows the life of saint Katheryne virgyn and marter. And first of her
name
KAtheryne is said of catha that is al / and ruyna that is falling / for all
the edefyce of the devil / fyl al fro her / for the edefyce of pride fyl fro
her by humylyte that she had / and thedefyce of flesshly desire fyl fro her by
her virgynyte / and worldly couetyse / for she despised al worldly things / Or
katheryne may be said as a little chain / for she made a chain of good werkys
/ by which she mounted in to heaven / and this chain or ladder had four grees
or stappes / which been / Innocence of work / clennesse of body / despysyng
of vanyte / and saying of truth / which the prophet puts by order /
where he says / Quis ascendet in mon tem domini / Innocens manibus / Who shall
ascend in to the montayn of our lord / that is heaven / and he answers The
Innocence of his hands / he that is clean in his heart / he that has not
taken in vain his soul / and he that has not sworen in fraud and deceyte to
his neighbor / And it apperyth in her legende how these four degrees were in
her /



KAtheryn by descent of line was of the noble lygnage of themperours of Rome /
as it shall be declared more playnelye herafter by a notable cronycle / whose
most blessed life and conuersacyon wrote the solemn doctor anathasius which
knew her lygnage and her life / For he was one of her masters in her tender
age or she was converted to the christian feythe / and after the said anathasius
by her prechyng and meruaillous werkys of our lord was converted also / Which
after her marterdom was made bishop of Alysaunder / And a glorious pyler of
the church by the grace of god and merytes of Saint katheryne / And as we
find by credyble chronicles / In the time of dyoclesyan and maxymyen / was
great and cruel tyranny showed in all the world as well to christian men as to
paynyms So that many that were subgette to Rome / put aweye the yocke of
seruage and rebellyd openly against thempyre Emonge whom the royame of
armonye was one that wythstood most the trybute of the romans / wherefore they
of Rome deputed a noble man of dygnyte named constancius which was tofore
other a valiant man in arms dyscrete and virtuous / the which lord after he
came in to ermonye / anon subdued them by his dyscrete prudence / and deseruyd
to have the love and favor of his enemies in so much that he was desired to
marye the daughter of the king which was sole heir of the royame / and he
consentyd and married her and sone after the king her fader deyed and then
constancius was enhaunced and crowned king / which sone after had a sone by
his wife named costus / at the birth of whom his mother deyed / after the death
of whom constancius returned to rome to see the emperor / and to know how
his lord ships were governed in tho parties and in the mean time tidings
came to rome how that great brytaygne which now is called england rebellyd
against the empire / wherefore by the aduys of the consulate it was concluded
that constancius king of ermonye should goo in to brytaygne to subdue them /
which adressyd him thither / and in short time after he entryd in to the land
/ by his prowess and wysdom he appeasyd the royame and subdued it ageyn to the
empire of Rome / And also he was so acceptable to the king of brytayne named
coel that he married his daughter heleyne / which afterward fond the holy
cross / And in short time he gate on her constantyn which after was Emperor
/ And then sone after deyed constancyus / and constantyn after the death of
king Coel / by his mother was crowned king of brytaygne / And costus the
first sone of constancyus wedded the kings daughter of cypre which was heir
/ of whom as shall be here after was engendered Saint katheryne / which came of
the lignage of constancyus /

Now follows the life of saint Katheryne
IN the year of our lord two hundred reigned in cypre a noble and prudent king
named costus / which was a noble and semely man / rich and of good condycyons
and had to his wife a queen like to him self in virtuous governance / which
lived to gyder prosperously but after the law of paynyms / and worshypped
ydolles / This king by cause he loved renomm^e and would have his name spradde
thorugh the world he founded a cite in which he edefyed a temple of his false
gods / and named that cite after his name costy / which after to encrece his
fame the people named it fama costi / and yet in to this day is called famagous
/ in which cytee he and the queen lived in great welthe and prosperyte / and
like as the fair rose spryngeth emonge the brerys and thorns / Right so
between these two paynyms was brought forth this blessed vyrgyn saint katheryne
/ and when this holy virgyn was borne she was so fair of vysage and so well
formed in her membrys / that all the people enjoyed in her beauty / and when
she came to vij year of age anon after she was set to scole / where she
prouffyted much more then any other of her age / and was informed in the
arts lyberal / wherein she drank plenteuously of the well of wysdom / for she
was chosen to be a techer and enformer of everlasting wysdom / The king costus
her fader had so great joy of the great towardnes and wysdom of his daughter
/ that he let ordeyne a toure in his paleys with diverse studyes and chambres /
in which she might be at her pleasure / and also at her will / and also he
ordained for to wait on her seven the best masters and wysest in connyng that
might be gotten as in tho parties / and within a while they that came to teache
her / they after that learned of her / and became her dyscyples / and when this
vyrgyne came to the age of xiiij year her fader king cos^us deyed / and then
she was left as queen and heir after him / and then the estates of the
land came to this young lady katheryne / / and desired her to make a
parlemente / in which she might be crowned and receive the homage of her
subgettes / and that such rule might be set in her beginning / that pees
and prosperyte might ensyewe in her royame / and this young maid granted to
them their asking / and when the parlamente was assemblyd / and the young
queen crowned with great solempnyte / and she syttyng on a day in her
parlamente / and her mother by her with all the lords each in his place a lord
aroos by thassente of her mother the other lords and comyns and knelid down
tofore her saying these words / Right high and mighty pryncesse / and our
most souerayn lady / please it you to wit / that I am commanded by the queen
your mother / by all the lords and comyns of this your royame / to require
your hyenes / that it may plese you to grant to them that they might provide
so^me noble king or prince to marye you / to the end that he might rule and
deffende your royame and subgettes / like as your fader did before you / and
also that of you might proceed noble lygnage / which after you may reygne upon
us / which thing we most desire / and hereof we desire your good answer /
This young queen katheryne heeryng this request was abashed / and troubled in
her courage how she might answer / to content her mother / the lords / and her
subgettes / and to keep her self chaste For she had concluded to keep her
virgynyte / and rather to suffer death than to defoule it / and then with a
sad chere and meke look she answered in this wise / Cosyn I have well
understand your request / and thank my mother / the lords / and my subgettys
/ of the gre^e love that they all have to me / and to my royame / and as
touching my marriage / I trust verayly there may be no peril / consyderyng the
great wysedom of my lady my mother / and of the lords / with the good
obeysau^ce of the comyns trustyng in their good contynuaunce / wherefore we need
not to seek a stranger for to rule us and our royame / for with your good
assystaunce and aid we hope to rule govern and keep this our royame in good
Justice / pees / and rest / in like wise as the king my fader held you in /
Wherefore at this time I pray you to be content and to cesse of this matere
and let us proceed to such matters as ben requesyte for the rule / governance
and universal well of this royame and when this young queen katheryn had
achyeued her answer / The queen her mother and all the lords were abashed of
her words and wist not what to say / for they consyderyd well by her words
that she had no will to be married / and then there aroos and stood up a duc
which was her uncle / and with due reverence said to her in this wise / My
souerayn lady saving your high and noble dyscrescion / this answer is full heavy
to my lady your mother / and to us al your humble lyege men / without ye take
better aduys to your noble courage / wherefore I shall moeue to you of four
notable things that the great god has endowed you before al other creatures
that we know which things ought to cause you to take a lord to your husbond /
to the end that tho plentyuous yeftes of nature and grace / may spring of you
by geeracion / which may sucorde by right lygne to reygne upon us to the great
comfort and joy of all your people and subgettes / and the contrary should
torn to great sorrow and heaviness / Now good uncle said she what been these
iiij notable things that so ye repute in us / madame said he / the first is
this that we be acerteyned that ye be comen of the most noble blood in the
world / the second that ye be a great enherytour / and the grettest that lives
of woman to our knowleche / the third that is that ye in science / connyng and
wysdom pass all other / and the fourth is in bodily shappe and beauty / there
is none like to you / wherefore madame us think that these four notable things
must nedys constreyne you to enclyne to our request / Then said this young
queen katheryne with a sad countenance / Now uncle sithe god and nature have
wrought so great virtues in us / we been so much more bounden to love and to
plese him / and we thank him humbly of his great and large yeftes / but sithe
ye desire so much that we should consent to be married / we let you playnelye
wit that like as ye have descryued us / so will we descryue him that we will
have to our lord and husbond / and if ye can get such one we will agree to
take him with all our heart / For he that shall be lord of mine heart and mine
husbond / shall have tho four notable things in him over al mesure / So
ferforthly that al creatures shall have need of him / and he needs of none /
and he that shall be my lord must be of so noble blood that al men shall do to
him worship / and therwyth so great a lord that I shall never think that I made
him a king / and so rich that he pass al other in rychesses / And so full of
beauty / that au^gellys have joy to behold him / and so pure that his mother
be a virgyne / and so meke and benygne / that he can gladly foryeue al
offenses do on unto him Now I have descryued to you him that I will have and
desire to my lord and to my husbond / goo ye and seek him / and if ye can find
such one / I will be his wife with all mine heart / if he vouche sauf to have me /
and finally but if ye find such one / I shall never take none / and take this
for a fynal answer / and with this she cast down her eyes mekelye and held her
stylle / and when the queen his mother and the lords herd this / they made
great sorrow and heaviness / for they saw well that there was no remedy in
that matere / Then said her mother to her with an angry voys / alas daughter
is this your great wysedom that is talked so far / much sorrow be ye like to
do to me and al youres / alas who saw ever woman forge to her such an
husbond with such virtues as ye done For such one as ye have devised (...)
was never none / ne never shall be / and therefore daughter leave this foly^ / and
do as your noble elders (...) done tofore you / and then said (...) young
Queen Katheryne unto (...) mother with a pieteous syghyng / Madame I wot well by
very reason that there is one much better than I can deuyse him / and but he
by his grace find me / I shall never have joy For I feel by great reason that
there is a weye that we ben clean out of / and we ben in derkenes / and till the
light of grace come / we may not see the clear way / and when hit pleases him
to come / he shall avoid all derkenes of the clouds of ygnoraunce / and show
him clearly to me whom my heart so feruentelye desires and loves / And if
it so be that he list not / that I find him / yet reason commands me to
keep hole that is unhurt / wherefore I beseech you mekely my lady mother / that
ye ne none other moeue me more of this matere / for I promise you plainly that
for to deye therefore / I shall never have other husbond / but only him that I
have descryued / To whom I shall trewely keep me with all the pure love of mine
heart / and with this she aroos and her mother / and all the lords of the
parlamente / with great sorrow and lamentacion / and taking their leave departed
/ and this noble young katheryne went to her paleys / whose heart was set a
fire upon this husbond that she had devised / that she could do no thing / but
al her mind and entente was set on him and contynuelly mused how she might
find him / but she could not find the mean / how well he was nyghe to her
heart / that she sought / For he had kyndled a brennyng love / which could
never after be quenched / for no pain ne trybulacyon as it apperyd in her
passion / But now I leave this young queen in her contemplacion / and shall say
you as far as god will give me grace / how that our lord by his specyal
miracle called her unto baptesme / in a specyal manner such as has not be
herd of before ne sithe / and also how she was vysybly married to our lord in
showing to her souerayn tokenes of synguler love / Then beside alysaunder a
certain space of miles dwelled an holy fader an hermyte in deserte named adryan
/ which had served our lord contynuelly by the space of thyrty year in great
penance / and on a day as he walked before his celle being in his holy
medytacions / there came against him / the most reverent lady that ever any
erthely creature might behold / and when this holy man beheld her high
estate and excellent beauty which was above nature / he was sore abashed and
so much astonyed that he fyl down as he had be deed / Then this blessed lady
seeing this / called him by his name goodly and said / brother adryan dread ye
no thing / for I am come to you for your good honor and prouffyte / and with
that she took him up mekelye comfortyng him and said in this wise / Adryan ye
must goo in a message for me in to the cite of alysaundre / and to the paleys
of the queen katheryne / and say to her that the lady saleweth her / whose sone
she has chosen to her lord and husbond syttyng in her parlamente with her
mother and lords about her / where she had a great conflycte and bataylle to
keep her vyrgynyte / and say to her that thylke same lord whom she chaas is my
sone / that am a pure vyrgyne and he desires her beauty and loves her
chastyte emonge all the virgynes on the earth / I command her without
taryeng / that she come with the allone unto this paleys / where as she shall be
new clothed / and then shall she see him / and have him to her ever lastyng
spouse / Then adryane heeryng this / said dredefully in this wise / a blessed
lady how shall I do this message / for I know not the cite ne the way thither
/ and who am I though I knew it / to do such a message to the queen / For
her meyne will not suffer me to comme to her presence / and though I came to her
/ she will not believe me / but put me in duresse as I were a faytour / Adryan
said this blessed lady dread ye not / for that my son has begone in her
must be performed / for she is a chosen vessel of specyal grace before all
wymmen that lyuen / but goo forth and ye shall find no lettyng / and enter in
to her chamber / for thaungel of my lord shall led you thither / and bring you
both hither saufelye / Then he mekely obeyeng went forth in to alisaundre
and entryd in to the paleys / and fond doors and closures openyng against him
/ and so passed fro chamber to chamber till he came in to her secret study
where as none came but her self allone / and there he fond her in her holy
contemplacion / and did to her his message like as ye have herd / according to
his charge / and when this blessed virgyne katheryne had herd his message and
understood by certain tokenes that he came for to fetch her to him / whom she
so fervently desired / anon aroos forgetyng her estate and meyne / and followed
this old man thorugh her paleys and the cite of alysaunder unknown of any
person / and so in to deserte / in which way as they walked she demanded of
him many an high questyon / and he answered to her suffyciently in all her
demaundes / and informed her in the feyth and she beuygnely received his
doctrine and as they thus went in the deserte this holy man had lost his way
/ and wist not where he was / and was all confused in him self / and said
secretlye alas I fere me I am deceived / and that this be an illusyon / alas
shall this virgyne here be perysshed emonge these wild beestys / now blessed
lady help me / that almost am in despayr / and save this maiden that has
forsaken for your love all that she had / and has obeyed your commandment /
and as he thus sorowed the blessed vyrgyne katheryne apperceyued / and
demanded him what him eyled and why he sorowed / and he said for you / by
cause I can not find my celle / ne wot not where I am / fader said she dread
ye not / For trust ye verayly that that good lady which sent you for me /
shall not suffer us to perisshe in this wilderness / and then she said to him
what monaster is yonder that I see / which is so rich and fair to behold /
and he demanded of her where she saw it / and she said yonder in the eest /
and then he wyped his eyes / and saw the most glorious monasterye that ever
he saw / whereof he was full of joy / and said to her now blessed be god that
has endowed you with so parfyte faith / for there is that place wherein ye
shall receive so great worship and joy / that there was never none like / sauf
only our blessed lady cristes own mother queen of all queen's / now good fader
adrya^ hye you fast that we were there / for there is al my desire and joy /
and sone after they approached that glorious place / and when they came to the
gate / there met them a glorious company al clothed in white and with
chappelettes of white lylyes on their heedes / whose beauty was so great and
bright that the vyrgyn katheryn ne the old man might not behold them / but
all rauysshed fyl down in great dread / then one more excellent than another
spoke first and said to this virgyne katheryne / stand up our dear suster /
for ye be right welcome / and ladde her ferther in / till they came to the
second gate / where another more glorious company met her / al clothed in
purpure with fresshe chappelettes of read rooses on their heedes / and the holy
virgyne seeing them fyl down for reverence and dread / and they benygnely
comfortyng her took her up and said to her dread ye no thing our dear suster
/ for there was never none more hertely welcome to our souerayn lord / then
ye be and to us all / for ye shall receive our clothyng and our crown with so
great honor that al saints shall joy in you / come forth for the lord
abides desyryng you / and then this blessed virgyn katheryne with tremblyng
joy passed forth with them like as she that was rauysshed with so meruayllous
joy that she could not speak / and when she was entered in to the body of the
church she herd a melodye of meruayllous swetnesse which passyd all hertes
to think it and there they beheld a ryal queen stondyng in her estate with a
great multitude of angels and saints whose beaulte and richesse might no
heart think / ne no pen write / for it excedeth every man's mind / Then
the noble company of marters with the felawshyp of vyrgynes / Which ladde the
vyrgyne katheryne fill down flat tofore this ryal Empress / with souerayn
reverence saying in this wise /

Our most souerayn lady queen of heaven / lady of all the world / emperesse of
hell / mother of almighty god king of bliss / To whose commandment obeyen al
heavenly creatures and erthly lyketh it you / that we here present to you our
dear suster whose name is wryton in the book of life / besechyng your benygne
grace to receive her as your daughter chosen / and humble handemayde / for to
accomplysshe the work which our blessid lord has begone in her / and with
that our blessed lady said bring ye me my well beloved daughter / and when the
holy virgyn herd our lady speak / she was so much replenysshed with heavenly
joy that she lay as she had been deed / Then the holy company took her up
and brought her tofore our blessed lady / to whom she said my dear daughter
ye be welcome to me / and ye be strong and of good comfort / for ye be
specially chosen of my sone for to be honored / remember ye not how syttyng in
your parlame^te ye descryued to you an husbonde where as ye had a great
conflycte and bataylle in deffendyng your chastyte / and then this holy
katheryne knelyng with most humble reverence and dread said O most blessed
lady blessed be ye emonge al wymmen / I remember how I chaas that lord / which
then was full far fro my knowleche / but now blessed lady by his mighty
mercy / and your specyal grace / he has opened the eyes of my blind
conscience and ygnoraunce / so that now I see the clear way of truth / and
humbly beseech you most blessed lady that I may have him whom mine heart
loves and desires above all thing / without whom I may not live and with
these words her spyrites were so fast closed that she lay as she had been deed
/ and then our lady in comfortyng her said / my dear daughter / It shall be as
ye desire / but yet ye lack one thing that ye must receive or ye come to the
presence of my sone / ye must be clothed with the sacrament of baptesme /
Wherefore come on my dear daughter for all thing is provided / for there was a
font solempnely apparaylled with al thing requesyte unto baptesme / And
then our blessed lady / called adryan the old fader to her and said brother
this office longs to you / for ye be a priest / therefore baptyse ye my
daughter / but change not her name for katheryne shall she be named / and I
shall be her godmoder / and then this holy man adryan baptized her / and after
our lady said to her / now mine own daughter be glad and ioyeful / for ye lack
no thing that longs to the wife of an heavenly spouse / And now I shall bring
you to my lord my sone which abides for you / and so our lady led her
forth unto the quere door / where as she saw our savior Ihesu christ / with a
great multitude of aungellys / whose beauty is Impossyble to be thought or
wryton of erthely creature / of whose sight this blessed vyrgyne was fulfilled
with so great sweetness / that it can not be expressyd / To whom our blessed
lady benygnely said / Most souerayn honor / joy and glory be to you king
of bliss / my lord / my god / and my sone / loo I have brought here unto your
blessed presence your humble servant and ancylle katheryne / which for your
love has refused al erthely things / and has at my sendyng obeyed to come
hither hopyng and trustyng to receive that I promised to her / Then our
blessed lord took up his mother / and said mother / that which pleseth you
pleseth me / and your desire is mine / For I desire that she be knytte to me by
marriage emonge all the virgynes of the earth / and said to her / katheryne come
hither to me / and as soon as she herd him nempne her name so great a swettenes
entered in to her soul that she was as al rauysshed / and therwyth our lord
yafe to her a new strength / which passyd nature and said to her come my
spouse and give to me your hand / and there our lord espoused her / in ioynyng
him self to her by spirituel marriage / promysyng ever to keep her in all her
life in this world / and after this life to regne perpetuelly in his bliss / and
in token of this set a ring on her fyngre / which he commanded her to keep in
remembrance of this / and said dread ye not my dear spouse / I shall not
depart fro you but al weye comfort and strength you / Then said this new
espouse o blessed lord I thank you with all mine heart of all your great
mercyes besechyng you souerayn lord / to make me dygne and worthy to be thy
servant and handmayde / and to plese you whom my heart loves and desires
above all things / and thus this glorious marriage was maad / whereof all the
celestyal court ioyed and songen this verce in heaven / Sponsus amat sponsam
saluator visitat illam / with so great melodye that no heart may express ne
think it / This was a glorious and synguler marriage to which was never none
like before in earth / wherefore this glorious virgyne katheryne ought to be
honowred / lawded and praised emonge all the vyrgynes that ever were in earth
/ and then our blessed lord after this marriage said unto the blessed
katheryne / Now the time is come that I must depart unto the place that I
came fro / wherefore what that ye will desire / I am ready to grant to you / and
after my departing ye must abide here with old adryan x days / till ye be
perfytely informed in all my laws and will / And when ye shall be comen home
/ ye shall find your mother deed / but dread ye not / for ye were never myssed
there / in all this time / For I ordained there one in your stead / that all
men wene it were your self / and when ye come home / she that is there in your
stead shall void / Now fare well my dear spouse / and then she cried with a
full pyteous voys / A my sovereign lord god / and all the joy of my soul have
ever mind on me / and with that he blessed her / and vanysshed aweye from her
sight / and then for sorrow of his departing she fyl in a swowne / so that
she lay stylle a large hour without any life / and then was adryan a sorry
man and cried upon her so long that at the last she came to her self and
reuyued / and lift up her eyes / and saw no thing about her saufe an old
celle / and the old man adryan by her weeping / For all the ryalte was voyded /
both monasterye and paleys and all the comfortable syghtes that she had seen /
And specially he which was cause of all her joy and comfort / and then she
sorowed morned and wept / unto the time that she saw the ring on her fyngre
/ and for joy thereof yet she swowned / and after she kyssed it a thousand
sythes with many a pyteous tere / and then adryan comforted her the best wise
he couthe / with many a blessed exortacion / and the blessed virgyne katheryne
took al his comfortes / and obeyed him as to her fader and dwelled with him the
time that our lord had assygned her / till she was suffycyently taught all that
was nedeful to her / and then she went home to her paleys / and governed her
holyly in conuertyng many creatures to the christian feythe of Ihesu christ / on
whom al her joy was holy set / and ever he was in her mind and so dwelled
stylle in her paleys never idle / but ever continued in the service of our lord
full of charity / where a while I let her dwell fulfilled of virtues and grace
/ as the dear and synguler sponse of almighty god / And then in this mean
time maxencyus that was then emperor and vycyous to gods law / and cruel
tyraunte consyderyd the noble and ryal cite of alysaunder and came thither and
assemblyd all the people rich and pour for to make sacrefise to thydolles and
the christian men that would not make sacrefyse he let slay / and this holy
virgyne was at that time xviij year of age / dwelling in her paleys full of
rychesses / and of servants / allone without parents and kynne / and herd
the brayeng and noise of beestys / and the joy that they made and song / and
meruaylled what it might be / and sent one of her servants hastelye to
inquire what it was / and when she knew it / she took so^me of the people of
her paleys / and garnysshed her with the sign of the cross / and went thither
/ and fond there many christian men to be led to do sacrefyse for fere of
death / then was she strongely troubeled for sorrow / and went forth
hardely to the emperor / and said in this wise / And then demanded they for
what cause they were called from so far parties / and ^he emperor answered
and said / (...) a maiden / none comparable to her in wit and wysdom / which
confounds all wise men / and she says that our gods ben deuylles / and if
ye surmounte hem by honor / I shall send you ageyn in to your contreye with
joy / And one of them had hereof despyte and said by dysdayn / this is a worthy
counceyl of an emperor / that for one maid young and fraylle / he has done
assemble so many sages and fro so far contrees / and one of our clerkys or
scolers may overcome her / and the king said to them / I may well by strength
constreygne her to sacrefyse / but I had lever that she were ouercomen by your
arguments / Then said they let her be brought tofore us / and when she
shall be ouercomen by folly / she may know that she never saw wise man / and
when the virgyn knew the stryffe of the dysputacion that she abode / She
commanded her al unto our lord / and an aungel came to her and said / that she
should keep her fermelye / for she should not be vaynquysshed / but she should
surmounte them and send them to marterdom / and when she was brought tofore
the masters and orators / she said to the emperor / what Judgment is this to
set fyfty orators and masters against one maid / and to promise to them
great rewards for their victory / and compellest me to duspute with them
without hope of any reward / and god Ih^u crist which is very guerdon of
them that stryuen for him shall be only with me / and he shall be my reward /
for he is the hope and crown of them that fight for him / and when the
masters had said that it was Impossyble that god was made man / ne that he had
suffered death / the vyrgyne showed to them that the paynyms had said it / tofore
that he was made / For plato said god to be all round / and to be slain /
and Sybylle said thus that the ylke god should be blessed and happy that should
hang on the cross and when the vyrgyne had right wisely dysputed with the
masters / and that she had confounded their gods by open reasons / they were
abashed and wyste not what to say / but were al stylle / And the emperor was
replenysshed with felonye against them / and began to blame them by cause
they were ouercomen so fowlly of one maid / and then one that was master
above all the other said to the emperor / know thou sir emperor that never
was there any that might stand against us / but that anon he was ouercomen /
But this maid in whom the spyryte of god speaks / has so converted us /
that we can not say any thing ageynste Ihesu christ / ne we may not ne dare
not wherefore sir emperor we knowleche that but if that thou may bring
forth a more prouable sentence of them that we have worshypped hitherto / that
al we be converted to Ihesu christ and when the tyrau^te herd this thing he
was esprysed with great wodenesse and commanded that they all should be burnt
in the mids of the cytee / And the holy vyrgyne comforted them / and maad
them constaunte to marterdom / and informed dylygentlye in the feythe / and by
cause they doubted that they should deye without baptesme / the vyrgyne said to
them Doubt ye no thing / for theffusyon of our blood shall be reputed to you
for baptesme / and garnysshe you with the sign of the cross / and ye shall be
crowned in heaven /

And when they were cast in to the flammes of fire / they rendryd their sowles
unto god / and neither here ne clothe of them had none harm / ne were hurt by
the fire / And when the christian men had buried them / the Tyraunte spoke unto
the vyrgyne / and said / a right noble lady vyrgyne have pity of thy yongthe /
and thou shalt be chyef in my paleys next the queen / and thyn image shall be
set up in the mids of the cite / and shall be adoured of all the people as
a goddess / To whom the virgyn said leave to say such things / For it is
evil to think hit / I am given and married to Ihesu christ / he is my spouse
he is my glory / he is my love and he is my swetnes / there may no fair
words ne no torments call me fro him / and then he being full of wodenesse
commanded that she should be despoyled naked / and beten with scorpyons / and
so beten to be (...) in a derke prison and there was tormented by hongre by the
space of twelve days and the emperor went out of the contreye for certain
causes / and the queen was esprysed with great love of the virgyne / and went
by night to the prison with porphyrye ye prince of knights and when the queen
entryd she saw the prison shynyng by great clerenesse / and aungellys
enoyntyng the wounds of the holy vyrgyne katheryne / and then Saint
katheryne began to preche to the queen the joys of paradys / and conuertyd her
to the feythe / and said to her that she should receive the crown of marterdom
/ and thus spoke they to gyder till mydnyt and when porphyrye had herd all that
she had said / he fyl down to her feet and received the feythe of Ihesu christ
with two hundred knights / and by cause the tyraunte had commanded that she
should be twelve days without mete and drink / Ihesu christ sent to her a
white dowue which fed her with mete celestyal / and after this Ihesu christ
apperyd to her with a great multitude of aungellis and virgynes and said to her
/ daughter know thy maker / for whom thou haste emprysed this trauayllous
bataylle / be thou constante / for I am with the / and when the emperor was
returned he commanded her to be brought tofore him / and when he saw her so
shynyng / whom he supposed to have been tormented by great famyne and fasting /
and supposed that sum had fed her in prison / and was fulfilled with furour
/ and commanded to tormente the kepars of the prison / and she said to him
veraylye I took never sithe mete of man / but Ihesu christ has fed me by his
aungel / I pray the said the emperor set at thyn heart this that I admoneste
the and answer not by doutable words / we will not hold the as a chamberer /
but thou shall tryumple as a queen in my royame / in beaulte enhaunced To whom
the blessed vyrgyne katheryne said / understand I pray the and Judge trewely /
whom ought I better to chese of these two / or the king puyssaunt pardurable
glorious and fair or one seek unsteadfast / not noble / and foul / and then
the emperor having dysdayne and angrye by felonye / of these two chese the one /
or do sacrefyse and live or suffer diverse torments and perysshe / and she said
tarry not to do what torments thou wylt / for I desire to offer to god my
blood and my flesh / like as he offryd for me / he is my god / my fader / my
friend / and mine only spouse and then a master warned and aduysed the king
being wode for anger that he should make four wheles of iron enuyronned with
sharp rasours cuttyng / so that she might be horrybly al detrenched and cut
in that torment so that he might fere the other christian people by ensau^ple of
that cruel torment and then was ordained that two wheles should torn against
the other ij by great force / so that they should break all that / that should be
between the wheles / and then the blessed vyrgyne prayed our lord that he
would break these engynes to the praysyng of his name / and for to convert the
people that were there / and anon as this blessed vyrgyne was set in this
tormente / the aungel of our lord brake tho wheles by so great force that it
slew four thousand paynyms / And the queen that beheld these things came
from above / and had hyd her feythe till then / descendyng anon / and began
to blame the emperor of so great cruelte / and then the king was
replenysshed with woodnes when he saw that the queen despised to do sacrefyse
and did do first do rent of her pappes / and after smite of her heed / and
as she was ladde unto marterdom she prayed katheryne to pray god for her / and
she said to her / ne doubt the no thing well beloved of god / For this day
thou shall have the royame perdurable /

For this transytorye royame / and an Inmortal spouse for a mortal / And she
was constaunte and ferme in the feythe / and bad the tormentours deo as was to
them commanded / And then the sergeauntes brought her out of the cite / and
araced of her pappes with tongues of iron / and after smote of her heed / whose
body porphyrye took aweye and buried it / the next day following was demanded
where the holy body of the queen was / and the emperor bad that many should be
put to tormente for to know where the body was / Porphyrye came then tofore
them al / and escryed saying I am he that buried the body of the ancylle / and
servant of Ihesu crist / and have received the feythe of god / and then
maxence began to rore and braye as a mad man and cried saying / O wretchyd
and caytyf / loo porpherye which was the only kepar of my soul / and
comfort of al mine euylles is deceived / which thing ^e told to his knights
/ to whom they said / and we also ben christian / and been ready for to suffer
death for Ihesu christ / and then the emperor dronken in wodenes commanded
that al should be byheded / and that their bodies should be cast to dogs / and
then called he katheryne and said to her / how be it that thou have made the
queen for to deye by thyn art magyke / if thou repent the thou shall be first
and chyef in my paleys / For thou shall this day do sacrefyse or thou shall
lose thyn heed / and she said to him do all that thou have thought / I am ready
to suffer al / and then he gafe sentence against her / and commanded to
smite of her heed / and when she was brought to the place ordained thereto / she
lift up her eyes to heaven prayeng said / o Ihesu criste hope and help of them
that believe in the / o beauty and glory of virgyns / good king I beseech and
pray the / that who someuer shall remember my passion be it at his death or in
any other necessyte / and call me / that he may have by thy mercy theffecte of
his request and prayer / and then came a voys to her saying / come unto me
my fair love and my spouse / loo behold the yate of heaven is opene to the /
and also to them that shall halowe thy pass^on I promise the comfort of heaven
of that they require / and when she was byheded there issued out of her body
milk in steed of blood / and aungellys took the body and bare it unto the
mou^te of Synay more then twenty iourneyes fro thens / and buried it there
honorably / and contynuelly oil rennyth out of her boones which heleth al
maladyes and sekenesses / and she suffered death under maxence the tyraunte /
about the year of our lord three hundred / how maxence was punysshed for this
felonye and for other it is contained in thystorye of thynuencyon of the holy
cross / but for as much as it was not known long after where this holy body
was becomen / there was great sorrow and lamentacion emonge christian men saying
alas the most clear light of our feyth / of wysdom and the temple of the holy
ghoost is goon from us / and besought god deuoutely that it might plese him to
show to them this holy relyque / which after came to knowleche in this manner
/

In the deserte a boute the mount of Synay there were many christian heremytes /
which were enflamed with great devotion toward this holy vyrgyne Saint
katheryne / Wherefore by common assente they ordained a chapel / In which this
holy vyrgyne should be specially remembryd / which chapel was by the mount of
Synay / not far from the hylle / fast by the place where as our lord apperyd
in the busshe to moses / In which place the holy heremytes lyueden in great
abstynence and devotion a glorious life / To whom on a time the angel of god
apperyd and said / God has be holden your affectuel devotion fro heaven /
Therefore he has granted to you this grace / that by you shall be founden (...)
known the holy body of the glorious virgyne Saint katheryne / to his souerayn
honor and glory and therefore arise ye up and follow me / and though it so
be that ye see me not / yet the shadow of the palm that I bear in mine hand
shall never depart fro your sight /

And then these Heremytes went forth and followed the aungel till they came to
the place / where uneath any creature might enter for straytenes of the way
and sharpness of the rocks / and when they came to the top of the hylle
they saw not thaungel / but they saw euydently the shadow of the palm that
it seemed all the place had be shadowed by the leuys of the palm / by which
they came unto the place where the body had layen a hundred and thyrty year in
a stone and her flesh was dried up for length of time / but the bones were
so compacte and pure that they seemed to be kept by the cure of aungellys /
Then they took up with great joy and reverence this holy body / and bare it
down in to the chapel / which they had made / and this was done by great
miracle / for the place where as she lay in was so stepe / thycke streyte and
so dangerous / that it seemed to man's reason Impossyble to come there to / and
these holy men after they had brought this body with solempnytee ordained the
feste of thynuencion of this holy body should be solempnysed which is yet there
kept / and is about the time of thynuencyon of the holy cross / which place
is gretely honored / and our lord shewith there many miracles / and out of the
bones flows out oil largelye / by which many maladyes been guarisshed / and
it is said that tofore the body was founden that a monk went to the mount of
synay / and dwelled there by the space of seven year much deuoutelye in the
service of saint katheryne / and on a time as he prayed with great devotion
that he might have sum thing of her body / Sodeynlye there came a ioynte of
one of her fyngres of her hand / which yefte he took ioyefully of our lord /
It is redd^ that there was a man much devout to saint katheryne / and often
called on her to his aid / and by length of time he fyl in foul thought /
and lost the devotion that he had to the saint and cessyd to pray to her /
and as he was on a time in prayer / he saw a great multitude of vyrgyns
passing by him / emonge whom there was one more replendysshaunte then the
other / and when she approached him she couerd her vysage / and passed to fore
him her face couerd / and he meruaylled much of the beauty of her / and
demanded what she was / and one of the virgyns said that it was katheryne /
whom thou were wont for to know / and by cause thou know ne remembryst
her not / she passed tofore the thith face couerd and without knowleche / It is
to be noted that this blessed vyrgyne saint katheryne seems and apperyth
meruaylous in v things / first in wysdom / secondly in eloquence / thyrdly in
constaunce / fourthly in clennesse of chastyte / and fyfthely in pryuylege of
dygnyte / First she apperyd meruayllous in wysdom / In her was all manner of
phylosophye / Phylosophye is divided in three / in theoryque / in practyque /
and in logyque / Theoryque is divided in three that is Intellectual / natural /
and mathematyke / The blessed katheryn had science Intellectual in knowleche
things deuyne / of which she vsyd ageynste the masters / to whom she proved
to be but one very god only and conuaynquysshed all the false gods /
Secondly she had science naturel / of which she used / in desputyng against
the emperor / Thyrdly she had science mathematyque that is a science that
beholds the forms and the manner of things / and this science had she in
despysyng the erthely things / For she wythdrewe her heart fro all erthely
matere / She showed to have this science when she answered to the emperor when
he demanded who she was / and said I am Katheryne daughter of king cost /
and how she had be nourysshed in purpre / And hereof vsyd she when she enbardyed
the queen to despise the world and her self and to desire the reygne pardurable
/ The practyque is divided in three manners / In ethyque / ycomonyke and
polytyque / the first techeth to inform manners / and enourne him with virtues
/ and that apperteyneth to all men / The second techeth to rule and govern well
his meyne / And that apperteyneth to them that have men to govern / The third
apperteyneth to the governors of cytees / for she techeth to govern the
peples / the cytees and the common / and these three scyences had the blessed
katheryne / First she had in her self al honest of manners Secondly she ruled
her meyne laudably which was left to her / thyrdly she informed wisely the
Emperor / Logyke is divided in three / in demonstratyf / in probable / and in
sophystycal / The first perteyneth to phylosophres / the second to rethours and
logycyens / and the third to sophistres and these three sciences had katheryne
in her / for she dysputed with the emperor / Secondly she was meruayllous in
eloquence / For she had fair speech in prechyng / as it apperyd in her
predycacious / she was rizt sharp in rendryng reason / as when she answered to
the emperor / She had sweet words in drawyng the people to the feythe / as it
apperyd in porphyrye and the queen whom she drew to the christian feyth / by
swetenes of her fair speech / She had right virtuous word in over coming / as
it apperyd in the masters whom she vaynquysshed so puyssauntlye / thyrdly she
was meruayllous in constaunce / for she was most constaunte against the
thretenynges and menaces / for she despised them all and answered to
the emperor / tarry not to do the torments that thou have purposed / for I
desire to offer to god my blood / and make an end of that thou have conceyuyd
in thy courage / I am ready to suffer al / Secondly she was ferme when great
yeftes were offered to her / For she refused all / and said to the emperor / when
he promised to hold her as second lady in his paleys and she said / leave to
say such things / It is felonnous to think it / Thyrdly she was constaunte
in the tormentys that were done to her / Fourthly she was constaunte in
clennesse of chastyte / for she kept chastyte emonge tho things that chastyte
is wont to perisshe / for there been five things in which chastyte may
perysshe / that is in plesaunce of rychesses / couenable oportunyte / flouryng
yongthe / fredom thythout constraynte / and souerayn beauty / and emonge al
these things the blessed katheryne kept her chastyte / for she had great
plente of rychesses / as she that was heir of rich parentys / She had
couenable leyser to do her will / as she that was lady of her self / and
conuersyd all day emonge her servants which were young of age / She had
fredom without any that governed her in her paleys / and of these four it is
said before / and she had beauty so much that every man meruaylled of her
beauty / Fyfthly she was meruayllous in preuylege of dygnyte / for certain
specyal preuylegys were in sum saints when they deyed / like as the
vysytacion of Ihesu christ was in saint Ioh^n theuangelyste / The flowyng of
oil in saint nycholas / theffusyon of milk for blood that was in saint Poule
/ the preperaco^n of the sepulcre that was in saint clemente / and the heeryng
and grauntyng of the petycyons that was in saint margarete when she prayed for
them remembryng her memory / Al thise things to gyder were in this blessed
vyrgyn saint katheryne / as it apperyth in her legende / Then let us
deuoutely worship this holy vyrgyne / and humbly pray her to be our
aduocatryce in all our needs bodily and ghoostly that by the merytes of her
prayers we may after this short and transytorye life come unto the everlasting
bliss and joy in heaven / where as is life pardurable / Quod ipse prestare
dignetur / qui cum patre et spiritu sancto viuit et regnat deus / Peromnia
secula seculorum amen /

Thus ends the life of Saint Katheryne
Here follows the life of saint Saturnyne and first of his name
SAturnyne is said of Saturare / that is to be filled / and of nux that is a
note / for ye paynyms were filled for to marter him / like as the squyrelle
that eteth the note / for when the squyrelle takes the note for to have it
out of the hulle / hit seems to him bitter / then he goes up on high on
the tree and let it fall / and then the hulle breketh and the note spryngeth
out / And thus were the paynyms filled in saint saturnyn / for he was bitter to
them by cause he would not do sacrefyse / and then they brought him up on
high of the capytoyl / and cast him down the stappes or grees / so that he
brake his heed and the brayn sprange out of it /

Of saint Saturnyne
SAturnyne was ordained bishop of the disciples of thappostles an was sent in
to the cytee of toulouse / and when he entryd in to the cite / the deuylles
cessyd to give answers / and then one of the paynyms said / but if they slew
saturnyne / they should have none answer of their gods / and they took
saturnyne / which would not do sacrefyse / and bond him to the feet of a
bulle and drew him unto the highest place of the capytoylle / and cast him
down the degrees and stappes to the ground / so that his heed was all to
broken / and the brain sprange out and so he accomplysshed his marterdom and
two wymmen took his body and buried it in a deep place for fere of the paynyms
/ and afterward his successors took up the body and transported it in to a
more honorable place / There was another saturnyne whom the prouoste of rome
held long in prison / and after he raised him in the tormente named eculee /
and did do let him with synewes / rods / and scorpyons / and after did do
brenne his sides / and then took him down and smote of his heed about the
year of our lord two hundred and lxxx under maxymyen And yet there was another
saturnyn in affryca / which was brother of saint satyr / saint renouele / and
saint felycyte his suster and saint perpetua which was of noble lygnage /
which al suffered death together / of whom the passion is holden another time /
and when the prouoste said to them that they should do sacrefyse to thydolles /
they refused it utterly / and he then put them in prison and when the fader
of saint perpetua herd that / he came to the prison weeping and said daughter
thou have dishonored al thy lygnage / For till now was never none of thy
lygnage put in (...) prison / and when he knew that she was christian / he ran
upon her and would have cratched out her eyes with his fyngres / and cryeng
loud and issued out / and the blessed perpetua saw a vysyon which in the
morning she said to her felawes / I saw said she a ladder of gold of a
meruaylous heyght erecte to heaven / and was so strayte that no man might goo
but one allone / and cultres and swerdes of iron sharp / were fixed on the
right side and lift side / so that he that went up might neither look here ne
there / but byhoued alweye to behold right up to heaven / and a dragon of
horrible great form lay under the ladder / which made every man to dread
and fere to mount up / and she saw satyr assendyng by the same unto a boue /
and lokyng to us ward and said / doubt ye no thing this dragon but come up
surely that ye may be with me / And when they herd this vysyon they al gave
thankynges to our lord ^od / for they knew then that they were called to
marterdom / and on the morn they were all presented to the Judge / and after
he said to them it behooves you to be presented to the gods and do sacrefyse
to them / but when they would do no sacrefyse / He maad saint saturnyne to be
take fro the wymmen / and to be put emonge the other men / and he said to saint
felycyte / have thou an husbond / she said I have one / but I set not by him
/ and then he said to her have mercy on thy self / woman and live / specially
sith thou have a child in thy belly / To whom she said do to me what thou
will / for thou may never draw me to thy will / The fader and mother of
saint perpetua and her husbond ran to her and brought her child to her /
Which yet sowked / and when her fader saw her stondyng tofore the prouoste /
he fyl down and said to her / my most sweet daughter have mercy on me / and on
thy sorrowful mother / and also of this most wretch thy husbonde / which may
not live after the / and she stood stylle without moeuyng / and then her
fader cast his arms about her neck / and he / her mother / and her husbond
kyssed her saying daughter have pity of us / and live with us / And then she
put the little child from her and them also saying / depart ye and goo ye fro
me mine enemies / for I know you not / and then when the prouoste saw her
constaunce he made her long to be beten / and afterward to be put in prison /
and then the other saints were sorrowful for saint felycyte / which had yet
months to come of her chyldyng / and prayed to god for her / and anon she
began to travail / and was delyuerd of a child a live and quycke / Then one
of her kepars said to her what shall thou do when thou come tofore the
prouoste / which art yet so grievously tormented / and felycyte answered / I
shall here suffer pain for my self / and god shall suffer there for me / and
then were these Saints drawn out of prison / and were despoyled and ladde
by the streets / and to them were let goon beestis and satyr and perpetue
were devoured of lions / and renouele and felycyte were slain of lupardes /
and saint saturnyne had his heed smyton of / And this was about the year of
our lord two hundred and lvj under valeryen and galyen emperors

Thus ends the life of Saint saturnine This feste is the last feste of the
year / for to begin at the feste of saint andrewe / and herafter shall follow
diverse feestys which been added and set in this said book called the golden
legende /

Of Saint James the marter
James the marter had to surname entersyce / and was of noble lygnage / but
more noble by his feyth / he was borne in the regyon of perse / in the cite of
lapene / he was comen of christian people / and had a good christian wife / and was
well known with the king of perse / and was chyef emonge the princes / and it
happed for the great love that he had to the king / he was deceived and
brought to adoure the ydolles / to whom he knelyd / and when his mother and his
wife herd that / anon they wrote to him a letter in this wise / thou have
forsake him that is life / in obeyeng to him that is mortal / and in plesyng him
that is but duste / thou have left thodour pardurable / thou have changed
truth in to lesynge / in oboyeng him that is mortal / and have forsaken the
Judge of them that been deed / and of them alive / and know thou that fro heue
forth we shall be to the strange / ne we shall not dwell with the in no manner
herafter / and when James had herd this letter / he wept bytterly and said if
my mother that bare me / and my wife be maad so strange to me / then how
much more should I be estraunged fro god / and when he had sore tormented him
self for this error There came a messager to the prince that said that James
was christian / and then the prince called him and said say to me if thou be
nazaryen / and james said ye verayly I am nazaryen / and the prince said then
art thou an enchauntour / and James said I am none and when the prince menaced
him with many torments / James said to him thy menaces trouble no thing me /
for it ne is but wind blowyng upon a stone / thy woodnes passes lightly
thorugh mine eerys / to whom the prince said demene the not dysordynatly lest
thou perysshe by grievous death / To whom James said / This ought not be called
a death / but a sleep for anon after we shall arise ageyn and the prince said /
let not the nazaryens deceive the / saying that death is no thing but a sleep
/ for the great emperors doubten it / and James said we doubt no thing the
death / for we hope for to goo fro death to life / And then the prince by
counceyl of his friends gafe this sentence upon James / that he should be cut
every membre from other / for to fere the other / and then sum had pity of
him and wept and he said to them weep not for me for I goo to life / but weep
on your self to whom torments perdurable be due unto / and the bouchyers
cut of the thombe of his right hand / and he cried and said / o thou
delyuerer or nazarenes / receive the branch of the tree of thy mercy / For
the overplus is cut of / of him that tylyeth the vine for to burgene and
bring forth fruit more plenteuously / and the boucher said to him / if thou
wylt consent to the prince I shall spare the and give to the medecyne / To
whom James said haste not thou seen the strock of the vygne / that when the
branches been cut of / the knotte that remains in his time / when the
earth achauffeth It germeth and brings forth new buddes in all the places of
the cuttyng then if the vygne be cut / by cause he should burgyne and bring
forth fruit in his time / how much more ought a man burgyne more plenteuously
in the feyth that he suffers for the love of Ihesu christ which is the very
vygne / and then the boucher cut of the forfyngre / Then said Saint James
lord receive two branches which thy right hand has planted / he cut of
the third / and James said I am delyuerd fro three temptacions / I shall bliss
the fader the sone and the holy ghoost / and lord I shall confess the with the
three children that thou sauedest fro the chymney of fire / and Ihesu christ I
shall sing to thy name in the quere of marters / and then the fourth was
cut of / and saint James said O protector of the children of Israhel /
which in the fourth blessyng were pronounced / receive of thy servant the
confession of the fourth fyngre / like as the benedyccion was in Judah / and
then the fyfthe fyngre was cut of / and he said my joy is accomplisshed /
and then the bouchers said to him spare thy life that thou perysshe not / and
anger the not though thou have lost one hand / for there ben many that have
but / one hand / that have much honor and rychesses / And the blessed James
said to them when the shepeherdes shere their sheep they take not only the
right side / (...) also the lift side / then if the lam^^ which is but a
brute be will lose his flese for his master / how much more then I that
am a man reasonable out to be smyton in pyeces for the love of god / and then
the felonne bouchers went to that other hand and cut of first the little
fyngre / and saint James said lord when thou were great thou would be made
little for us / and therefore I yield to the body and soul which thou made /
and redemyst with thy propre blood / Then the seventh fyngre was cut of /
and he said lord I have said to the seven times in the time preysynges / Then
they cut the viij fyngre / and he said Ihesu christ was circumcysed the eight
day / and thebrewes were circumcised the eight day for to accomplysshe the
commandments cerymonyalles of the feythe / and lord let the mind of thy
servant goo fro these Incircumcysed / and that I may have the prepucye
vndefouled / that I may come and behold thy face lord / Then the nynthe
fyngre was cut of / and he said the nynthe hour Ihesu christ rendryd his
spyryte in the cross to his fader / and therefore lord I confess me to the in
the sorrow of the ix fyngre / and thank the / Then the tenthe fyngre was
cut of / and he said the tenthe nombre is in the commandments of the law
/ Then sum of them that were there sayden right dear friend / confess thou
our gods tofore our prince so that thou may live / how be it that thy
hands be cut of / there ben right wise leches that shall well hele the and
ease the of thy pain / To whom saint James said / god forbede that in me
should be any false dyssymylacion / no man that put his hand to the ploughe and
looks bacwarde / is not couenable to come to the kingdom of heaven / Then the
bouchyers having despyte / and cut of the great too of the right foot / and
saint James said the foot of Ihesu christ was persyd / and blood issued out /
The second was cut of / and he said / this day is great to me tofore all
other days / this day I converted shall goo sothely to the strong god / then
they cut the third / and threwen it tofore him / and saint James said smylyng
/ goo thou third too to thy fellows / for like as the grain of whete rendryth
much fruit / so shalt thou do with thy felawes / and shall rest in the last
day / The fourth was then cut of / and he said my soul wherefore art thou
sorrowful / and why troublest me / hope in god / for I shall confess to him that
is the health of my chere / and my god / The fyfthe was cut of / and he said
I shall now begin to say to our lord dygne praysyng / for he has made me
worthy felawe to his servants / Then they came to his lift foot and cut
of the little too / and saint James said little too be comfort / for the great
and little shall have one resurrexyon / an here of the heed shall not perisshe /
and thou shalt not depart fro thy felawes / And after they cut of the
second too and he said destroy ye the old hows / for a more noble is maad
ready / The third was cut of / and he said by such kuttynges shall I be
pourged fro vices / and they cut of the fourth too / and he said comfort me
god of truth / for my soul trusts in the Then the fyfthe was cut of /
and he said / O lord loo I offer and sacrefyse to the twenty times / and then
they cut of his right foot / and saint James said / Now I shall offer a yefte
to god for whose love I suffer this Then they cut of the lift foot / and he
said / thou art he lord that make meruaylles / here thou me lord and save me
/ They cut of after his right hand / and he said lord thy mercyes help me /
they cut of his lift hand and he said lord thou art he that love the
ryghtful / and they cut of the right arm / and he said my soul praise the
our lord / I shall give lawde to our lord in my life / and shall sing to him as
long as I shall live / and then they cut of the lift arm and he said the
sorrows of death have enuyronned me / and I shall think against them / then
they cut of the right leg to the thye / Then saint James was grieved in
great pain / and said lord Ihesu christ help me / for the wayllynges of death
come about me / and he said to the bouchyers / our lord shall clothe me with
new flesh so that your wou^des shall never appear in me / and then the
bouchyers began to fail and were weary / fro the first hour of the day unto
the nynthe they had swette in cuttyng his membyrs / and after they came to them
self and cut of the lift leg unto the thye / and then the blessed James
escryed and said / o good lord here me half a live / thou lord of living men
and deed / lord I have no fyngres to lift up to the / ne hands that I may
enhaunce to the / my feet be cut of and my knees / so that I may not knele
to the and am like to an hows fallen / of whom the pylers ben taken aweye / by
which the hows was born up and sustained / here me lord Ihesu christ / and
take out my soul fro this prison / and when he had said this one of the
bouchyers smote of his heed Then the christian men came pryuelye and took aweye
the body and buried it honorably / and he suffered death the v kalendes of
decembre /

Thus ends the great passion Of Saint James the marter
Here follows the life of the holy and venerable priest bid
THe holy and venerable bede was borne in england / and when he was seven year
of his age / he was delyuerd to benette bishop of gyrwy for to learn / and
after his death / he was put to colfrydus abbot of the same place and learned
and prouffyted much in holy life and connyng / and the xix year of his age he
was made deken of Johan bishop of york / and in the thyrty year of his age he
was made priest / Then began he to write and to study to expowne holy writ
/ where upon he made many noble omelyes / and not withstondyng his great
business / was daily in the seruyse of relygyon as in syngyng and prayeng in
the church / he had great swetenes and lykyng / to learn / to teache / and to
write / he wrote lxxviij books / he acounted the books and years fro the
beygnnyng of the world in hystorya anglyeana / In the book of polycronycon is
reherced that is wonder / that a man that was so without use of scole made so
many noble volumes in so sobre words / in so little space of his life time /
It is said he went to Rome for to show there his books for to see them
according to holy writ / and to the lore of holy church / but hereof sum
doubt / and say that he never went to Rome / Also it is said that when he
was blind / he went about for to preche his servant that ladde him brought
him where as were many hupples of stones / to whom he maad a noble sermon /
and when he had al fynysshed his sermon / the stones answerden and sayden amen
/ Also it is said that he fond a writing of three R / and three F / over the
yate of rome / which he expowned thus / the first R betokened regna / the
second ruent / the iij rome that is regna ruent rome / and the first f
betokens ferro / the second flamma the third fame / that is ferro fla^ma
fameque / Also pope sergyus wrote a letter to thabbot colfrydus / and prayed
for to have beda come to Rome / for to assoyle certain questyons that were
there moeuyd / here is to be noted that how noble and worthy the court of rome
hel^e him / when so noble a court had need to have him for to declare and
assoyle the questyons that there were moeuyd / also we ought to hold noble and
holy by the manner of his living and his techyng / he must needs be virtuous
and eschew vices that was so well ocupyed in spendyng his wit and thought in
expownyng of holy write / and his clennesse was much seen at his last end /
For his stomach had Indygnacyon of mete seven wekes contynuelly / and of
drink so that uneath he might reteyne any mete / and was strayte and short
brethed / but for all that he spared not the travail of lecture and of books /
and every day emonge the detty trauaylle of seruyse and of psalms he taught
his dyscyples in lessons and in questyons / he translated saint Iohans gospel
in to english / and said to his scolers / learn ye my small children whiles I
am a live and with you / I wot not how long I shall abide with you / and alwey
emonge he said that saw of saint ambrose / I have not so lived emonge you /
that me shameth to live / neither me dredeth to deye for we have a good lord /
on nyghtes time when he had no man to teache / then would he deuoutely be in
yrayers and thankyng our lord of al his yeftes / The tewesday tofore assencyon
day his death approached and his began to swelle / he was howseld enoynted and
kyssed his brethern / and prayed them al to rememembre him / and he yaue to
diverse of his servants things that he had in pryuyte /

On the assencyon day the here was spredde / and he laid him down thereon and
prayed for the grace of the holy ghoost and said / O king of bliss and lord
of virtues that have the prys and art this day styed up above all heuenes /
leave thou us not faderlesse / but send thou in to us that byheste of the fader
/ the ghoost of sothfastnesse / And when he had ended that / he yaue up the
last brethe with a sweet odor and savor / and there he was then buried /
but the comune fame tellyth that he now lies at durham with saint cutberde /
There was a devout clerk which labored in his mind for to make his
epytaphye / and in no wise he could make true meter / wherefore on a time he
went to the church and prayed god to give him connyng to make a true verse /
And after came unto his tomb and saw there wryton by an aungel / Hic sunt in
fossa bid venerabilis ossa / Then let us pray to this holy man that he
pray for us / that after this life / we may come to everlasting life amen

Here ends the life of the holy Bid
And here follows the life of Saint Dorothe
THe glorious virgyn and marter saint dorathe was borne of the noble lygnage of
the senators of Rome / her fader hight Theodore / In that time the persecucion
of the christian people was great about rome / wherefore this holy vyrgyn saint
dorathe despysyng the worshyppyng of ydolles / counceylled her fader her mother
and her two susters christian / and calestyn to forsake their pocessyons / and so
they did / and fled in to the royame of capadoce / and came in to the cite of
cezarye / wherein they set saint dorathe to scole / and sone after she was
crystened of the holy bishop Saint appollynare / and he named her dorathe /
and she was fulfilled with the holy ghost / and in great beauty above all the
maidens of that royame / and she despised al worldly vanytees and brennyd in
the love of almighty god and loved pouerte / and was full of mekenes and
chastyte / Whereof the fend having envy at her blessed living provoked and
set a fire in her love the prouoste / so that he would have her to his wife /
and anon sent for her in all haste / and when she came he desired to have her
to his wife / and promised to her richesse or worldelye good without nombre /
and when this holy virgyne understood his desire and request / refused it and
denied it utterly / and all his rychesses setting at naught / and more over
she know leched her self to be christian / and that she had auowed her vyrgynyte
unto Ihesu christ whom she had chosen to her spouse / and would never have
other / and when the prouoste fabrycyus herd this he was nyghe fro him self
for anger / and commanded that she should be put in a tonne of bre^nyng oil
wherein she was preserved by the power of her spouse Ihesu criste / that she
felt none disease ne harm but with a precious oynemente of ^awme and when the
paynyms saw this grete^ miracle / many of them were thereby converted to the
feythe of Ihesu christ / and the tyraunte said that she did all this by
enchauntemente / and did do put her in a deep prison ix days long without
mete or drink / but she was that while fed by aungellys food of our lord /
so that at the end of ix days / she was no thing appayred / Then the Judge
sent for her / supposyng that she had been nyghe deed and feeble / but when she
came she was fayrer and bryghter to look on then ever she was before / whereof
all the people meruaylled gretely / Then the Judge said to her but if thou wylt
worship and do sacrefyse to thydolles thou shall not escape the tormente of
the gylette / Then she answered to the Judge / I worship almighty god that
made al things / and despise thy gods that been fendes / and then she fyl
down pla^te to the earth / and lift up her eyes to almighty god besechyng him
/ that he would show his power before the people / that he was only almighty
god and none other / Then fabrycius the Judge let set up a pyler on high
/ and thereon he set his god an ydolle / and anon there came a multitude of
angels fro heaven / and cast down this ydolle / and al to brake it / and anon
the people herd a great noise of fendes cryeng in thayer saying / O do rathe
why do thou destroy us and tormentest us so sore / and for this great
miracle many thousands of paynyms were turned to the feythe of Ihesu christ /
and were baptized / and after received the crown of marterdom / for the
knowlechynge of the name of Ihesu christ / Then the Judge commanded that this
holy vyrgyne should be hanged on the gybette / her feet upward and the heed
dounwarde / and then her body was al to rent with hooks of iron / and beten
with rods and scourges / and burnt her brestys with hot fyry brondes / and
as halse deed she was set ageyn in to prison / and after when she was
brought ageyn / she was al hole and strong without any disease or hurt /
whereof the Judge had great meruaylle / and said to her / O fair maid forsake
thy god / and believe on our gods / for thou may see how mercyful they be
unto the and preserve the / therefore have pity on thy tender body / for thou
have be tormented enough and then the prouoste sent for her two susters
which were named crystyne and calestyne / which for fere of death forsook the
feythe of Ihesu christ / and went to saint dorathe / and counceylled her to
obey to the prouostes desire / and forsake her feythe / But this holy vyrgyne
rebuked her susters and after informed them by so fair and sweet langage that
she withdrewe them fro their blind error / and establysshed them in the
feythe of christ / in such wise / that when they were comen to the Judge / they
said they were christian and byleuyd on Ihesu Christ / and when fabrycyus herd
that / he was mad for anger / and commanded that the tormentour should bind
their hands / and bind them both to gyde: back to back / and cast them in
the fire so bounden and burnt them / And then he said to the vyrgyne do
raihe / how long will thou trowble us with thy wytchecrafte / or do sacrefyse
to our gods / or else anon thy head shall be smyton of / and then said the
holy vyrgyne with a glad semblaun^e do to me what tormente thou will / for I
am al ready to suffer it / for the love of my spouse Ihesu christ / In whose
gardyn full of delyces I have gadred roses spyces and apples / and when the
tyraunte herd that he trembled for anger / And commanded that her fair
vysage should be beten with stones / so that there should appear no beauty in her
vysage / but al dysfygured so to be put in prison / till the next day / and on
the next day she came forth also hole and sound as though she had suffered
no disease / and was more fayrer for to look on then ever she was tofore /
by the grace of her blessed spouse Ihesu christ / For whose love she took on her
these great and sharp torments / and then this cursed Judge commanded to
smite of her heed / and as she was ladde to the place assygned where hit should
be done / a scrybe of the royame named theophylus said to her in scorn / I
pray the to send me sum of thy roses and appelis that thou have gaderyd in
the gardyne of thy spouse that thou praysest so much / and she granted to him
his desire / and this was in the cold winter time when there was both froste
and snow / and when she came to the place where she should be byheded / she
knelyd down on her knees and made her prayers to our lord Ihesu christ /
besechyng him that ^l they that worship her passion / that they might be kept
steadfast in the feythe / and to take their trybulacyon pacyently / and
specially to be delyuerd fro al shame great pouerte / and falls dysclaunder and
at their last end to have very contrycyon / confession / and remyssyon of al
their sins / and also wymmen with child that call to her for help to have
good delyueraunce / the children to be crystened / and the moders to be
purefyed / also she prayed to god that where her life were wryton or read in
any hows that it should be kept fro al peril of lightenynge and thonder / and
fro al perils of fire / fro perils of theuys / and fro sodeyn death / and to
receive the sacraments of holy church at their last end for their most
souerayn deffence against their ghoostly enemy the fend / and when she had
ended her prayer / there was a voys herd fro heaven / that said come to me my
dear spouse and true vyrgyn / for all thy bone is granted to the that thou
have prayed fore / and also whom thou prayest fore shall be saved / and when
thou have received the crown of marterdom / thou shall come to the bliss of
heaven without end for thy labor / and this holy virgyn bowed down her heed
/ and the cruel tyraunte smote it of / but a little before this apperyd before
her a fair child barefote clothed in purple with cryspe heerys / whose garmente
was set full of brighte sterres beryng in his hand a litel baskette shynyng as
gold with roses and apples / To whom the vyrgyn said I pray the bear this
baskette to theophyilus the scrybe / and thus she suffered death and passed to
our lord full of virtues / the vj day of feuerer / the year of our lord
CClxxxviij / by fabricius prouoste under dyoclesyan and maxymyan emperors of
rome / and as this said theophylus stood in the paleys of the emperor / this
child came to him and presented to him the baskette saying / These ben the
roses and apples that my suster do rathe has sent to the fro paradys the
gardyn of her spouse / and then this child vanysshed aweye / Then he
consyderyng the meruayllous work of god in this holy vyrgyne / said anon with
a stern voys praysyng the god of dorathe for that great miracle which was
showed to him of roses and apples that time that he that sent to me these
things is of great power / and therefore his name be blessed world wythouten
end amen / and then he was converted to the feyth of Ihesu christ / and the
most part of the people of the cite / and when fabrycyus knew this / anon
with great malice tormentyd theophylus the scrybe with many diverse torments /
and at last h^we him in to small pyeces / and the pyeces were cast to
birds and beestys to be devoured but he was first baptized and received the
ho^y sacrament / and followed the holy virgyne dorothea in to the bliss of
heaven / Then let us deuoutelye pray to this blessed saint dorathe that she
be our special protectryce ageynste al perils of fire / of lyyhtnyng / of
thondryng / and al other perils / and that at our end may receive the
sacraments of the church / that after this short life we may come unto bliss
in heaven where as is life and joy perdumble world withouten end amen /

Thus ends the life of Saint Dorathe
And here follows the life of Saint Brandon
Saint Brandon the holy man was a monk and borne in y^londe / and there he was
abbotte of an hows where in were a thousand monks / and there he had a full
strayte and holy life in great penance and abstynence / and he governed his
monks full virtuously / and then within short time after / there came to him
an holy abbot that hight beryne to vysyte him and each of them was ioyeful of
other and then saint brandon began to tell to thabbot beryn of many
wonders that he had seen in diverse lands / and when beryn herd that of saint
brahdon he began to syghe and sore wept / and saint brandon comforted him the
best wise he could saying / ye come hither for to be ioyeful with me / and
therefore for gods love leave your morning and tell me what meruaylles ye
have seen in the great see occean that compasses all the world about / and
all other waters comen out of him which renneth in all the parties of therthe
/ and then beryn began to tell to Saint brandon and to his monks the
meruaylles that he had seen full sore weeping / and said I have a sone his name
is meruoke / and he was a monk of great fame / which had great desire to seek
about by ship in diverse contres to find a solytarye place / wherein he my^
dwell secretelye out of the business of the world for to serve god quyetly
with more devotion / and I counceylled him to sail in to an ylonde far in
the sea besides the monteyn of stones which is full well known / and then he
made him ready and saylled thither with his monks / and when he came thy^^^ he
lyked that place full well / where he and his monks served our lord full
deuoutelye / and then beryn saw in a vysyon that this monk meruok was
saylled right far eestward in the sea more than the days sayllyng / and
sodeynlye to his semyng there came a derke cloud and ouercouerd them / that a
great part of the day they saw no light / and as our lord would the cloud
passed awey and they saw a full fair ylonde / and thyderward they drew / In
that ylonde was joy and myrthe enough / and the earth of that ylonde shyned as
bryghte as the son / and there were the fairest trees and herbs that ever
any man saw and there were many precious stones shynyng bright / and every
herke them was full of flouns / and every tree full of faiyte / so that it was a
glorious sight / and an heavenly joy tabyde there and then there came to them
a fair young man and full curtoysly he welcomed them al and called every monk
by his name / and said that they were much bound to preyse the name of our
lord Ihesu / that would of his grace show to them that glorious place / where
is ever day and never night / and this place is called paradys terrestre / but
by this ylonde is another ylonde wherein no man may come / and this young man
said to them ye have been here half a year without mete drink or sleep / and
they supposed that they had not ben there the s^ace of half an hour / so merry
and ioyeful they were there / and the young man told them that this is the
place that adam and eve dwelte in first / and ever should have dwelled here / if
that they had not broken the commandment of god / And then the young man
brought them to their ship ageyn / and said they might no bengyr abide there
/ and when they were al shypped / sodeynlye this young man vanysshed aweye out
of their sight / and then within short time after / by the purueaunce of our
lord Ihesu / they came to thabbey where Saint brandon dwelled / and then he
with his brethern received them godely / and demanded them where they had been
so long / and they said we have been in the land of byheest tofore the yates
of paradys / where as is ever day and never night / and they sayden all that the
place is full delectable / for yet al their clothes smellyd of that sweet and
ioyeful place / And then saint brandon purposed sone after for to seek that
place by gods belpe / and anon began to pourueye for a good ship and a
strong and vytaylled it for seven year / and then he took his leave of all
his brethern / and took twelve monks with him / but or they entered in to the
ship they fastyd forty days / and lived deuoutelye / and each of them
received the sacrament / and when saint brandon with his twelve monks were
entered in to the s^yppe / there came other two of his monks / and prayed him
that they might sail with him and then he said ye may sail with me / but
one of you shall goo to hell or ye come ageyn / but not for that they would goo
with him / and then Saint brandon bad the shypmen to wind up the saylle /
and forth they saylled in gods name / so that on the morrow they were out of
sight of any land / and forty days and forty nyghtes after they saylled
platte eest and then they saw an isle land far fro them / and they saylled
thyderward as fast as they could / and they saw a great rock of stone appear
above all the water / and three days they saylled about it or they could get
in to the place / but at the last by the pourueaunce of god they fond a little
haven and there went a land euerychone / and then sodeynlye came a fair
hounde and fyl down at the feet of saint brandon / and made him good chere in
his manner / and then he bad his brethern be of good chere / for our lord
has sent to us his messager to lead us in to sum good place / and the
hounde brought hem in to a fair halle where they fond the tables spredde /
ready set full of good mete and drink and then saint brandon said graces and
then he and his brethern satte down and ete and drank of such as they fond
/ and there were beds ready for them / wherein they took their rest after
their long labor / And on the morn they returned ageyn to their ship /
and saylled a long time in the sea after / or they could find any land / till
at last by the purueannce of god they saw far fro them a full fair ylonde
full of grene pasture / wherein were the why test and grettest sheep that ever
they saw / For every sheep was as great as an ox / and sone after came to
them a goodly old man / which welcomed them and maad to them good chere / and
said this is the ylonde of sheep / and here is never cold weder / but ever
summer / and that causes the sheep to be so great and white / they ete of the
best grass and herbys that is owhere / and then this old man took his leave
of them / and bad them saylle forth / right eest / and within short time by
gods grace they should come in to a place like paradys / wherein they should
keep their estertyde / and then they saylled forth / and came sone after to
that land / but by cause of little depthe in sum place / and in sum place
were great rocks / but at the last they went upon an ylonde wenyng to them
they had been saufe / and maad thereon a fire for to dress their dinner but
saint brandon abode stylle in the ship / and when the fire was right hot and
the mete nyghe soden / then this ylonde began to moeue / whereof the monks
were a ferde / and fled anon to ship and left the fire and mete behind
them / and meruaylled sore of the moeuyng / and saint brandon comforted them
and said that it was a great fysshe named Iasconye / which labors night and
day to put his tail in his mowthe / but for gretenes he may not / And then
anon they saylled weste three days and three nyghtes / or they saw any land /
wherefore they were right heavy / but sone after as god would they saw a fair
ylonde full of flowers herbs and trees / whereof they thanked god of his good
grace / and anon they went on land / and when they had goon long in this /
they fond a full fair well / and thereby stood a fair tree full of bows / and
on every boughe satte a fair bird / and they satte so thycke on the tree /
that uneath any leef of the tree might be seen / The nombre of them was so
great / and they sange so merely that it was an heavenly noise to here /
wherefore saint brandon knelyd down on his knees and wept for joy / and made
his prayers deuoutelye to our lord god to know what these birds mente / And
then anon one of the birds fled fro the tree to saint brandon / and he
with flykeryng of his wings made a full merry noise like a fydle / that him
seemed he herd never so ioyeful a melodye / and then saint brandon commanded
the bird to tell him the cause why they satte so thycke on the tree and sange
so meryly / and then the bird said sometime we were aungellys in heaven / but
when our master lucyfer fyl down in to hell for his high pride / and we fyl
with him for our offenses sum higher and so^me lower after the qualyte of the
trespaas and by cause our trespaas is but little / therefore our lord has set
us here out of al pain / in full great joy and myrthe after his plesyng / bear
to serve him on this tree in the best manner we can / the sunday is a day of
rest fro al worldly ocupacyon / and therefore that day all we be made as white
as any snow for to preyse our lord in the best wise we may / and then this
bird said to saint brandon / that it is twelve months passed that ye de
parted fro your abbey / and in the vij year herafter ye shall see the place that
ye desire to come to / and all this seven year ye shall keep your ester here with
us every year / and in the end of the seventh year ye shall come in to the
land of byheste / and this was on ester day that the bird said these words
to saint brandon / and then this foul flewe ageyn to his felawes that satte
on the tree / and then all the birds began to sing euensonge so meryly
that it was an heavenly noise to here / and after sowper saint brandon and his
felawes went to bed and slepte well / and on the morn they aroos by times /
and then those birds began matyns / pryme / and hours and al such
service as christian men use to sing / and saint brandon with his felawes abode
there viij wekes till trynyte sunday was paste / and they sailed ageyn to the
ylonde of sheep and there they vytaylled them well and sithe took their leave of
that old man and returned ageyn to ship / and then the bird of the tree
came ageyn to saint brandon / and said I am come to tell you that ye shall
sail fro hens in to an ylonde / where in is an abbey of xxiiij monks / which
is fro this place many a mile / and there ye shall hold your crystemasse / and
your ester with us like as I told you / and then this bird flewe to his
felawes ageyn / and then saint brandon and his fellows saylled forth in the
occyan / and sone after fyl a great tempeste on them / in which they were
gretely troubelyd long time / and sore forla^oured / and after that they fond
by the purueaunce of god an ylonde which was far fro them / and then they
full mekelye prayed our lord to send them thither in sauftee but it was forty
days after or they came thither / wherefore all the monks were so weary of that
trouble that they set little prys by their lives / and cried contynuelly to
our lord to have mercy on them / and bring them to that ylonde in saufte / and
by the purueaunce of god / they came at the last in to a little haven / but it
was so strayte that uneaths the ship might come in / and after they came to
an ancre / and anon the monks went to land / and when they had long walked
about / at the last they fond two fair we^lys / that one was fair and clear
water / and that other was somewhat trowbly and thycke / And then they thanked
our lord full humbly that had brought hem thither in saufete / and they would
feign have dronken of that water / but saint brandon charged them they should
not take without license / for if we absteyne us a while / our lord will
pourueye for us in the best wise / And anon after came to them a fair old
man with hoor here / and welcomed them full mekelye / and kyssed saint brandon /
and led them by many a fair well till they came to a fair abbey / where
they were receyuyd with great honor and solemn processyon with xxiiij monks
al in ryall copes of clothe of gold / and a ryal cross was before them / and
then the abbot welcomed saint brandon and his felawshyp and kyssed them full
mekely / and took saint brandon by the hand and led him with his monks in
to a fair halle / and set them down a rewe upon the benche / and the abbotte
of the place wysshe all their feet with fair water of the well that they
saw before / and after ladde them in to the fraytour and there set them
emonge his couente / and anon there came one by the purueaunce of god which
served them well of mete and drink / for every monk had set before him a
fair whyt loof and white rootys and herbys / Which were right delycyous / but
they wist not what rotes they were / and they drank of the water of the fair
clear well that they saw before when they came first a land / which saint
brandon forbadde them / and then thabbot came and chered saint brandon and
his monks / and prayed them ete and drink for charity / For every day our
lord sends a goodelye old man that coueryth this table and sets our mete
and drink tofore us / but we know not how it comes / ne we ordeyne never no
mete ne drink for us / and yet we have been lxxx year here / and ever our lord
worshypped mote he be fedeth us / we ben xxiiij monks in nombre / and every
feryal day of we weke he sends to us xij loves / and every sunday and
festeful day xxiiij loves / and the bread that we leave at dinner we ete at
sowper / and now at your coming our lord has sent to us xlviij loves for to
make you and us merry to gyder as brethern and alweye twelve of us goo to dinner
whiles other twelve keep the quere / and thus have we don this lxxx year for so
long have we dwelled here in this abbey / and we came hither out of thabbey of
saint patrikes in yrelonde and thus as ye see our lord has pourueyed for us /
but none of us knows how it comes but god allone / to whom be given honor
and law^e world withouten end / and here in this land is ever fair weder /
and non of us has been seek sithe we came hither and when we goo to mass or to
any other service of our lord in the church anon seven tapres of wax been
set in the quere and ben light at every time without man's hand / and so
brenne day and night at every hour of service / and never waste ne mynysshe as
long as we have been here which is lxxx year / and then saint brandon went
to the church with the abbotte of the place / and there they said euensonge to
gyder full deuontely and then saint brandon looked upward toward the
crucyfyxe / and saw our lord hangyng on the cross which was made of fyn
crystalle and curyously wroughte / And in the quere were xxiiij seetys for
xxiiij monks and the seven tapres brennyng / and thabbottes sete was made in
the mids of the quere / and then Saint brandon demanded of the abbotte how
long they had kept that scilence / that none of them spoke to other / and he
said this xxiiij year we spoke never one to another / and then saint brandon
wept for joy of their holy conversation / and then saint brandon desired of
the abbotte that he and his monks might dwell there stylle with him / to
whom thabbot said / sir that may ye not do in no wise / for our lord has
showed to you in what manner ye shall be guyded till the vij year be fulfilled and
after that term thou sbalt with thy monks return in to yrlonde in saufte but
one of the ij monks that came last to you shall dwell in ye ylonde of ankers and
that other shall goo quyck to hell and as Saint brandon knelyd in the church /
he saw a bryghte shynyng au^gel come in at the wyndowe and lyghted all the
lyghtes in the church / and then he flewghe out ageyn at the wyndowe unto
heaven / and then saint brandon meruaylled gretely how the light brennyd so
fair and wasted not / and then the abbotte said that it is wryton that moses
saw a busshe al on a fire and yet it brennyd not / and therefore meruaylle not
hereof / For the might of our lord is now as great as it ever thas / and when
saint brandon had dwelled there fro crystemasse even till the twelfthe day was
passed / Then he took his leave of the abbot and couente / and returned with
his monks to his ship and saylled fro thens with his monks toward the abbay
of saint Illaryes / but they had great tempestys in the sea fro that time till
palm sunday and then they came to the ylonde of sheep / and there were
received of the old man which brought them to a fair halle and served them
/ And on sherthursday after souper he wesshe their feet and kyssed them like as
our lord did to his dyscyples / and there abode till satyrday ester even and
then they departed and saylled to the place where the great fysshe lay and
anon they saw their cawdron upon the fysshes back / which they had left
there twelve month tofore / and there they kept the service of the
resurrexyon on the fysshes back / and fter they saylled that same day by the
morning to the ylonde where as the tree of birds was / and then the said
bird welcomed saint brandon and all his felawshyp / and went ageyn to the
tree / and sange full meryly / and there he and his monks dwelled fro ester till
trynyte sunday as they did the year before / in full great joy and myrthe /
And daily they herd the merry service of the birds syttyng on the tree / and
then the bird told to saint brandon that he should return ageyn at
crystemasse to the abbay of monks / and at ester thither ageyn / and the other
dele of the year labor in the occean in / full great perils / and fro year
to year / till the seven year be accomplysshed / And then sbal ye come to the
ioyeful place of paradys and dwell there ill days in full great joy and myrthe
and after ye shall return home in to your own abbey in saufete / and there
end your life and come to the bliss of heaven / to which our lord boughte you
with his precious blood / And then the aungel of our lord ordained all
thing that was nedeful to saint brandon and to his monks in vytaylles and al
other things necessary / and then they thanked our lord of his great
goodness that he had showed to them often in their great need and then saylled
forth in to the great see occyan abydyng the mercy of our lord in great trouble
and tempestys and sone after came to them an horrible fysshe which followed the
ship long time / castyng so much water out of his mowthe in to the ship
that they supposed to have been drowned / wherefore they deuoutelye prayed god to
deliver them of that great peril / and anon after came another fysshe
gretter then he / out of the west see and faughte with him / and at last
claue him in to three pyeces / and then returned ageyn / and then they
thanked mekelye our lord of their delyueraunce fro this great peril / but
they were in great heaviness by cause their vytaylles were nyghe spente / but
by the ordenaunce of our lord there came a bird and brought to them a great
branch of a vygne full of read grapes by which they loved fourtene days /
and then they came to a little ylonde / wherein were many vygnes full of grapes
/ and they there londed and thanked god / gadred as many grapes as they lived
by xl days after / alwey sayllyng in the sea in many storm and tempeste / and
as they thus sailed suddenly came fleyng toward them a great grype / which
assailed them / and was like to have destroyed them / Wherefore they deuoutelye
prayed for help and aid of our Lord Ihesu christ / And then the bird of
the tree of the isle land where they had holden their ester tofore / came to
the grype and smote out both his eyes / and after slew him / whereof they
thanked our lord / and then sailed forth contynuelly till saint peter's day /
and then songen they solempnely their service in thonour of the feste / and
in that place the water was so clear / that they myt see all the fysses that
were about them whereof they were full sore aghast / and the monks counceylled
saint brandon to sing no more / for all the fysshes lay then as they had
slepte / and then saint brandon said dread ye not for ye have kept by two
esters the feste of the resurrexyon upon the great fysshes back / and therefore
dread ye not of these little fysshes / and then saint brandon made him ready
and went to mass / and bad his monks to sing the best wise they could /
and then anon all the fysshes awoke / and came about the ship so thycke
that uneaths they might see the water / for the fysshes / and when the mass
was done all the fysshes departed so as they were no more seen / And seven days
they saylled alweye in that clear water / And then there came a south wind
and droof the ship ^ northward where as they saw an ylonde full derke and full
of stynche and smoke / and there they herd great blowyng and blastyng of
belowes / but they might see no thing / but herd great thonderyng whereof
they were sore aferde and blessed them often / and sone after there came one
stertyng out al brennyng in fire and stared full ghastlye on them with great
staryng eyes / of whom the monks were aghaste / and at his departing fro them
he made the horryblest cry that might be herd / and sone there came a great
nombre of fendes and assailed them with hokes and brennyng iron mallys / which
rannen on the water following their ship fast in such wise / that it seemed
all the see to be on a fire / but by the pleasure of our lord they had no power
to hurt ne grieve them ne their ship / wherefore the fendes began to rore and
cry / and threw their hooks and malles at them / And they then were sore
aferde and prayed to god for comforre and help for they saw the fendes al
about the ship / and them seemed then all the ylonde and the sea to be on a
fire / And with a sorrowful cry al tho fendes departed fro them and returned to
the place that they came fro / and then saint brandon told to them that this
was a part of hell / and therefore he charged them to be steadfast in the
feythe / for they should yet see many a dredeful place or they came home ageyn
and then came the south wind and droof them ferther in to the north /
where they saw an hylle al of fire / and a foul smoke and stynche coming fro
thens / and the fire stood on each side of the hylle like a wall al brennyng
and then one of his monks began to cry and weep full sore / and said that
his end was comen / and that he might abide no lengyr in the ship and anon
he lepte out of the ship in to the sea / and then he cried and rored full
pyteously / cursyng the time that he was borne / and also fader and mother that
bygate him by cause they saw no better to his correccion in his young age / for
now I must goo to perpetuel pain / and then the saying of saint brandon was
verefyed that he said to him when he entryd / Therefore it is good a man to do
penance and forsake sin / For the hour of death is incerteyn / and then
anon the wind turned in to the north and droof the ship in to the southe
which saylled seven days contynuelly / and they came to a great rock
stondynge in the sea / and thereon sat a naked man in full great myserye and
pain / for the wawes of the sea had so beten his body / that all the flesh
was gone of / and no thing left but synewes and bare bonys / And when the
wawes were goon / there was a canuas that hynge over his heed which beat his
body full sore with the blowyng of the wind / and also there were two ox
tongues / and a great stone that he satte on which did him full great ease / and
then Saint brandon chargyd him to tell him what he was / And he said my name
is Judas / that sold our lord Ihesu christ for xxx pens which sytteth here
thus wretchydlye / how be it I am worthy to be in the grettest pain that is /
but our lord is so mercyful / that he has rewarded me better then I have
deserved / For of right my place is in the brennyng hell but I am here but
certain times of the year / that is fro crystemasse to twelfth day / and fro
ester till whytsontyde be paste / and every festeful day of our lady / and every
satyrday none / till sunday that euensonge be done / but all other times I lie
stylle in hell in full brennyng fire with pylate / herod / and cayphas /
Therefore acursed be the time that ever I knew hem / and then Judas prayed
saint brandon to abide stylle there all that night / and that he would keep him
there stylle / that the fendes should not fetch him to hell / and he said with
gods help thou shalt abide here all this night / and then he asked Judas
what cloth that was that henge over his heed / and he said it was a clothe that
he gave to a lepre / which was boughte with the money that he stale fro our
lord / when I bare his purs / wherefore it does to me full great pain now / in
betyng my face with the blowyng of the wind / and these two ox tongues that
hang here above me / I gafe them sometime to two prestys to pray for me / them
I boughte with mine own money / and therefore they ease me by cause the fisshes
of the sea gnawe on them and spare me and this stone that I sytte on / lay
sometime in a desolate place where it eased no man / and I took it thens and
leyed it in a foul way / where it did much ease to them that went by that
way / and therefore it eases me now for every good deed shall be rewarded and
every evil deed shall be punyssled and the sunday against even there came a great
multitude of fendes blastyng and roryng / and bad saint brandon goo thens that
they might have their servant Judas / for we dare not come in the presence of
our master / but if we bring him to hell with us / and then said saint
brandon / I let not you to do your masters commandment / but by the power
of our lord Ihesu / I charge you to leave him this night till to morrow / how
dare thou help him that so sold his master for thyrty pens to the Jews /
and caused him also to deye the most shameful death upon the cross / and
then saint brandon charged the fendes by his passion / that they should not
noye him that night / and then the fendes went their weye roryng and cryeng
toward hell to their master the great devil and then Judas thanked saunt
brandon so ruthefully / thot it was pity to see / and on the morn the fendes
came with an horrible noise saying that they had that night suffered great pain
by cause they brought not Judas / and sayden that he should suffer double pain
the vj days following / and they took then Judas tremblyng for fere with them
to pain / and after saint brandon saylled southward three days and three
nyghtes / and on the friday they saw an isle land / and then Saint brandon
began to syghe and said / I see the ylonde wherein saint poule thermyte dwellyth
/ and has dwelled there xl year without mete and drink ordained by man's
hand / and when they came to the land / saint poule came and welcomed them
humbly / he was old and forgrowen so that no man might see his body / of whom
saint brandon said weeping / now I see a man that lives more like an aungel
then a man / wherefore we wretches may be ashamed that we live not better /
Then Saint Poule said to Saint brandon / thou art better then I / for our
lord has showed to the moo of his preuytes then he has done to me /
Wherefore thou ought to be more praised than I / To whom saint brandon said
we ben monks and must labor for our mete / but god has provided for the
such mete as thou hold the plesed / wherefore thou art much better than I
/ To whom Saint poule said sometime I was a monk of Saint patrykes abbey in
yrelonde / and was wardeyn of the place where as men enter in to saint patrykes
purgatory / and on a day there came one to me and I asked him what he was /
and he said I am your abbot Patryke / and charge the that thou depart from
hens to morn erly to the sea side / and there thou shall find a ship / in
to which thou must enter / which god has ordained for the / whose will thou
must accomplysshe / and so the next day I aroos / and went forth and fond
the ship / in which I entered / and by the purueaunce of god w I as brought
in to this ylonde the seventh day after / and then I left the ship and
went to land / and there I walked up and down a good while / and then by
the purueaunce of god there came an otter gooyng on his hyndre feet and brought
me a flynte stone and an iron to smite fire with / in his two fore claws of
his feet / and also he had about his neck great plente of fysshe which he
cast down before me / and went his way / and I smote fire and made a fire of
styckes / and did sethe the fysshe / by which I lived three dapes and then
the ottyr came ageyn / and brought to me fisshe for other iij days and thus he
has done this lj year thorugh the grace of god / and there was a great stone
out of which our lord made to spring fair water clear and sweet / whereof I
drink daily / and thus have I lived one and fyfty year / and I was forty year
old when I came hither / and am now an hundred and xj year old / and abide
till it please our lord to send for me / and if it plesyd him I would fayn be
dyschargyd of this wretched life / and then he bad saint brandon to take of
the water of the well and to carye in to his ship / for it is time that thou
depart for thou have a great iourneye to do / for thou shall sail to an
ylonde which is forty days sayllyng hens / where thou shalt hold thyn
ester / like as thou have done tofore where as the tree of birds is / and fro
thens thou shalt sail in to the land of byheest / and shalt abide there
forty days / and after return home in to thy contre in saufete / And then
these holy men took leave each of other / and they wept both full sore / and
kyssed each other / and then saint brandon entryd in to his ship and sailed
xl days even southe in full great tempeste / and on ester even came to their
procuratour which maad to them good chere / as he had before time / and from
thens they came to the great fysshe / whereon they said matyns and mass on
ester day / and when the mass was done the fysshe began to meue / and swa^me
forth fast in to the sea / whereof the monks were sore agaste / which stood
upon him / for it was a great meruayl to see such a fysshe as great as all a
contre for to swymme so fast in the water / but by the will of our lord this
fysshe set all the monks a land in the paradys of birds / all hole and
sound / and then retornyd to the place he came fro / and then Saint
brandon and his monks thankyd our lord of their delyueraunce of the great
fysshe / and kept their estertyde till trynyte sunday like as they had done
before time / and after this they took their ship and saylled eest xl days /
and at the forty days end it began to hayle right fast / and therwyth came
a derke myste / which lasted long after / which feryd Saint brandon and
(...) monks / and prayed to our lord to keep and help them / and then anon
came their procuratour and bad them to be of good chere for they were come in
to the land of byheest / and sone after that myste passed aweye / and anon
they saw the fairest contre eestward that any man might see / and was so clear
and bright that is was an heavenly sight to behold and all the trees were
charged with ripe fruit and herbs full of flowers In which land they walked
forty days / but they could see none end of that land / and there was
alweye day and never night / and the land attemperate / ne to hot / ne to
cold / and at the last they came to a fair river but they durst not goo over
/ and there came to them a fair young man / and welcomed them curtoysly / and
called each of them by his name / and did great reverence to saint brandon /
and said to them / be ye now ioyeful / for this is the land that ye have
sought / but our lord will yt ye depart hens hastelye and he will show to you
more of his secrets / when ye come ageyn in to the sea / and our lord will that
ye lade your ship with the fruit of this land / and hye you hens / for ye
may no longer abide here / but thou shalt sail ageyn in to thyn own contree
/ and sone after thou come home / thou shall deye / and this water that thou
see here departs the world a sondre / for on that other side of this water
may no man come that is in this life / and the fruit that ye see here is all
way thus ripe every time of the year and alwey it is here light as ye now see
/ and he that keeps our lords hestys / at al times shall see this land / or
he pass out of this world / And then saint brandon and his monks took of
that fruit as much as they would / and also took with them great plente of
precious stones / and then took their love and went to ship weeping sore by
cause they might no longer abide there / and then they took their ship and
came home in to yrelonde in saufete / whom their brethern received with greece
joy / gyuyng thankynges to our lord / which had kept them all that seven year
fro many a peril and brout them home in saufete / To whom be yeuen honor and
glory world without end amen / And sone after this holy man Saint brandon
wexe feeble and seek / and had but little joy of this world / But ever after his
joy and mind was in the joys of heaven / and in short time after he being
full of virtues departed out of this life to everlasting life / And was
worshypfully buried in a fair abbey which he him self founded Where our lord
shewyth for this holy saint many fair miracles / Wherefore let us deuoutely
pray to this holy saint that he pray for us to our lord that he have mercy on
us / to whom be given lawde honor / and empire world withouten end amen /

Thus ends the life of saint Brandon
And here follows the life of saint erkenwolde bishop
Saint erkenwolde was borne of noble lygnage / His fader was named offa / and
was king of eest england / and he had also a suster named alburgh / which
Erkenwolde and alburgh were of right parfyte life / and how be it that their
fader was a paynym / yet were these two children christian / and when erkenwolde
was in parfyte age he went in to relygyon / and was made first abbot of
chirchesey / where he lived an holy life / and after he was made bishop of
london / and his suster alburgh was his true follower in good werkys / and was
a woman of relygyon / and for her holy life she was made abbess of berkynge /
This holy man by the Informacion of saint Austyn and mellyte was informed in
the feythe in such wise that he utterly forsook the world / and ordained and
builded ij monasteryes / one for him self at chyrcheseye / and another for his
suster at barkyng / which after her baptesme was named ethelburga / and saint
erkenwolde counceylled his suster to flee worldely vanytees / and so he did him
self / and gave him in to deuyne contemplacyon / and gave gladly such goods /
as he had beside them that he spente in the fondacyon and buyldyng of the said
monasteryes to pour people and he changed his erthely heritage his worldly
dygnyte / and his great patrymonye in to the heritage and lyuelode of holy
church for to have his heritage in heaven / and he did al these expencis or he
was called to be bishop of london / and the holy theodore archebysshop of
caunterburye did do consecrate him bishop of london / and his suster was set
in berkyng with other vyrgynes for to be alweye ocupyd in the service of our
lord / and it happed on a time as thartyfycers that bylded the monasterye at
berkynge / were over seen in taking the mesure of a pryncipal beme / for it was
to short and would not accord to the place that it was ordained for /
wherefore they made much sorrow / Then this holy man saint erkenwolde and his
suster seeing this mysfortune / took the same beme between their hondes / and
drew it out in such wise that it had suffycyente length and accorded unto
the propre place that it was / ordained to / which miracle was anon known
openly to the people / and at that time were no nonnes in england / wherefore
saint erkenwolde sent over see / for a devout relygyous woman named hyldelyth
to whom he bytoke his suster for to be informed in the relygyon / as well in
connyng / as in good manners and virtuous doctrine / in which she prouffyted in
such wise that she passed all her felawes in connyng / and sone after she was
made abbess and chyef of all the monasterye / and it happed sone after that the
bishop of london deyed whose name was cedda / and by consent of the king and
all the people this holy man of god erkenwolde / was bishop of london / and
what someuer he taught in word / he fulfilled it in deed / for he was parfyte
in wysedom soft and dyscrete in word / bysy in prayer / chaast of body / and
holy yeuen to gods lore / and was planted in the rote of charity / and
afterward when he had suffered much trybulacion with many ghoostly bataylles /
he began to wax right seek / and then he commanded to make ready his chare
that he might goo and preche in the cytee the Word of god / wherefore it was
kept in custom long time after of his dyscyples and many other to touch him
and kiss him / and what someuer sickness that they had they were anon
delyuerd thereof / and were made parfytelye hool / In a day of somer as this
blessed saint / saint erkenwolde rode in his chare for to preche the word of
god / It fortuned that the one whele of the chare fyl of fro the axtre / and
that notwythstondyng the chare went forth right without falling / which was
ageyn nature and reason / and a fair miracle / for god guyded the chare / and
it was / meruaylle to all them that saw it / O mercyable god and meruayllous
above al thing to whom all brute beestys be made meke / and wild things been
obedyente / thou vouchesauf to call to thy mercy / thy blessed servant to
make him partable of thy excellent joy / thou give us grace by his prayer /
which knew by reuelacyon that his soul should be losed from the body by
temporal death to be preserved fro al manner evil and everlasting death / when
this blessed saint erkenwolde as god would came to berkyng he fyl in to a great
sickness in which he ended his temporalle life and for so much as he knew
it before he sent for his servants and such as were drawyng to him / and
yaue to them holsom and sweet lessons / and blessed them with great devotion /
and emonge them he yielded up his spyrite to almighty god / in whose passing was
felt a merueyllous sweet odor as the house had be full of sweet bawme And when
the high channons of Saint Powles at london herd this and the monkys of
chyrcheseye also anon they came to this holy body for to have it / and the
nonnes said they ought to have the body by cause he deyed there / and also by
cause he was her founder / and the monks said they ought rather to have him /
by caust he was both their abbot and founder / Then the chappytre of Powles
and the / people said they strove in vain / for / he should be brought to
london in to his own church / thus there was great stryffe / and at the last
they of london took up the holy body and bare it toward london / and as they
went there fyl a great tempeste and so much water that they might not pass /
but were constrained to set down the corpse / and in all the storm / the
tapers that were borne about the body were alweye bright brennyng / and then
the no^nes said that god showed well that they of london ought not to have him /
by cause of the tempeste / and at last after many words there was a clerk
which had be longyng to saint erkenwolde and saw this stryf / and stood up
and commanded scylence / and told to the people a great commendacyon of the
virtuous life of this holy saint / and said it was not honest ne according to
mysentrete the holy body by vyolente hondes / but let us byseche almighty god
with good devotion and meekness of heart for to show to us sum token by
reuelacyon / in what place this holy body shall rest / and all the people
consented thereto / and knelyd down and prayed deuoutelye / and whiles they were
in prayer / they saw that the water divided as it did to moses in the reed
see / and to the children going thorugh in to deserte / In like wise god gafe a
dry path to the people of london for to conueye this holy body thorugh the
water to the cytee / and anon they took up the body with great honor and
reverence / and by one assente they bare it thorugh the pathe / the water
stondyng up on every side / and the people not wetyng their feet / and so they
came to stratforde / and set down the bear in a fair mede full of flowers /
and anon after the wedder began to wexe fair and clear after the tempeste /
and the tapres were made to brenne / without puttyng to fire of any man's
hand / and thus it plesyd our lord for to multeplye miracles to thonour and
worship of this holy saint / wherefore the people were full of joy and gladness /
and gave lawde to almighty god / and then they took up the body and brought
it to poules / and as many seek folks as touched his bear were made hole /
anon as they touched the bear of al their sekenesses / by the merytes of the
holy bishop saint Erkenwolde / and after they leyed and buried the body
honorably in saint Poules church / where as our lord has showed many a fair
miracle / as in delyueryng of prisoners out of their yrons seek folk to their
health / blind to their sight / and lame men to their bodily strength / and
emonge al other he has been a special protector to the said church against
fire / where on a time the church was burnt / and his shryne which was
then but tree was sauyd thorugh his holy merytes / in so much that the clothe
that lay upon it was not perisshed / Another time when a great fire had burnt
a great part of the cite / and should have entered upon the church / saint
erkenwolde was seen on the church with a baner fyghtyng against the fire / and
so saved and kept his church fro brennyng / Then let us pray unto this
holy saint that he be a special advocate for us to almighty god that we may be
preserved from al perils of fire and water / and that he so govern us
between wealth and aduersyre in this present life / that we being assoyled from
sin and vices / may be brought unto heavenly joy where laud honor and
glory be given to the blessed trynyte word wythouten end amen /

Thus ends the life of saint Erkenwolde bishop
Here follows of the holy abbot Pastor and first of his name
PAstor is said of fedyng / by cause that he fedeth his shep / and this holy
man pastor fed his sheep spyrytuelly / and they were his brethern / by
spyrytuel words of doctrine and of manners of holy relygyon /

Of the holy abbot Pastor
THe abbotte Pastor was many yeris in great abstynence in deserte / and
tormented his flesh long time / and he shyned in great holiness of relygyon
/ and his mother desired much to see him and his brethern / and saw on a day
that he and his brethern went to the church they saw her / and anon they
fled fro her and entryd in to their celle / and shytte the door ageynste her
/ and she came to the door / and satte there sore cryeng and weeping / And
then pastor came to the door and said what cryest thou there thou old woman
/ and then she understood the voys of him and she cried louder and said / I
would see you my sons / why should I not see you / am I not your mother that
bare you and yaue you souke / and now am al hoar for age / To whom her sone
said / whethyr wylt thou see us in this world or in another / and then she
said if I see you not here shall I see you there / and he said to her if thou
may suffer / not for to see us here / without doubt thou shall see us there
/ which then departed ioyefully saying / if I shall see you there / I will not
see you here / and then the Judge would needs see the abbotte Pastor / but he
might not / and then he took his susters sone as though he had been a
malefactor and put him in prison and said / if pastor will come and pray for
him / I shall deliver him and let him goo / and then the mother of the child
came weeping to the door of pastor / and prayed him to help her sone and when
she could get none answer of him / then she said to him by great vyolence /
if thyn entraylles ben hard as iron / and have no pity of nothing / yet at
the least ought thou to be moeuyd and have pity of thyn own blood / which
is my sone / and then pastor sent to her and said that he had engendryd no
child / And then anon she departed for anger / and then said the Judge
at lest let him command by mowthe and I shall let him goo / and then
the abbotte pastor sent him word that he should examyne the cause according to
the law / and if he were worthy to deye / let him deye / and if not / do as
it shall plese the / He taught his brethern and said / for to keep him self /
to consydere and to have dyscrescyon ben werkys of the soul / pouerte /
trybulacion / and dyscrescyon ben werkys of solytarye life /

It is wryton / that these three men were so / Noe / Job / and danyel / Noe
represents the person that possedeth / Job them that been troubled / and
danyel them that been dyscrete / and if a monk hates two things / he may be
fre of this world / and one of his brethern asked him what they were / and he
said flesshly couetyse / and vain glory and he said if thou will find rest
in this world / and in that which is to come / say in every caas / who am I
and deem no man / On a time when a brother had offendyd of their congregation /
the abbotte by counceyl of one that was solytarye put him out which wept as
he had be in dyspayr Then the abbotte pastor maad him to be brought tofore
him / whom he comfortyng benygn elye / sent him to him that was solytarye
saying / I heryng of the desire to see the / labor therefore and come to me /
and when he was comen Pastor said to him / There were two men which their two
servants were deed / and that one of them left his own and went for to
bewail the deed servant of that others / and when the solytarye man herd
him / anon he understood him and wyste by his words what he mente and had
compuncyon / There was a brother which was sore trowbled / and would leave his
place by cause he had herd certain words of another brother that they
prouffyted not / and pastor said he should not believe tho words for they were
not true / he affermyd ageyn to him that they were true / for a true brother
had told him so To whom pastor said he is not true that said so to the / and
he said I have seen it with mine eyes / Then he demanded him of the festue /
and of the beme / and he answered / a festue is a festue / and a beme is a beme
/ And pastor said put in thyn heart all that / that been thy sins / and thou
shalt find them like a beme / and the small sins of him ben like a festue
There was a brother which had done a great sin / being in wyl^e to do
penance three year / and axed him if it were much / which said it is much
and then he axed if he would command him a year / and he said it was much /
They that stood by demanded of forty days / he said hit was much / And he
said to them / I trow that if a man repent him with all his heart / and will
return no more to his sin / and does penance three days / our lord shall
receive him to mercy / and then he was demanded of that word that angered
his brother without cause / and he said of all that ever thy brother greuyd the
/ be not angry with him / till that he put out thy right eye / and if thou be
wroth to him otherwise / thou art angrye without cause / but if any would
depart the fro god / then be wroth with him / and yet he said furthermore /
who so compleyneth is no monk / who that holds malice in his heart is no
monk / who that is wroth is no monk who does evil for evyl is no monk / who
that is proud and full of words is no monk / Who someuer is verayly a monk /
is alweye humble / meke / full of charity / and alweye to have tofore his eyes
the dread of god / in every place / that he sin not / and also he said if
there be three to gyder / of whom that one rests well / and that other is seek
/ and the third serves and admynystreth with pure will These three ben
semblable as it were of one work / There was one of his brethern which
compleyned him that he had many thoughts / and perisshed in them / and he
brought him in the air / and bad him hold up his lap and take the wind /
and he said I may not / and that other said in like wise may thou not forbede
thoughts to enter in to the / but it is thy part to wythstonde them / There
was a brother that demanded of him what he should do with the heritage that
was left him / and he bad him he should come ageyn within three days / and when
he came he said to him / if I said to the give them to thy parents or friends
/ thou sholdest have no mede thereof / and if I said give them to pour men /
thou shalt be sure / do what thou will / I have no caus^ thereof This is in
vitis patrum /

Here begins of the abbot Johan
Johan abbotte when he had dwelled forty year in deserte with ephesyen /
then ephesyen demanded how much he had prouffyted / and then he said as
long as I have been solytarye / there was never son that saw me etynge and
Johan said ne me being wroth this thing like almost I find / for when
epyphane the bishop gafe flessh to the abbotte hyllarye he said pardone me /
for sithe I took this habyte / I never ete flesh ne foul / To whom the
bishop said / and sithe I took mine habyte / I suffered never none to sleep that
had any thing against me ne I ne slepte also as long as I was contrary to
any other / To whom hyllarye said / fader foryeue it me / for thou art better
then I / Johan would have lived like unto aungellys / and intended alweye to
serve god without any other thing doing / and he despoyled him and was an hole
weke in deserte / and when he was almoost deed for hungre / and al stongen with
bees and waspys / he returned to the door of his brother and knocked / and he
axyd who art thou / and he said I am Ioh^n and that other said thou art not
he / for Johan is made an aungel / and is not emonge men / and Johan said
trewely I am he / but for all that he left him there till on the morn / And
then he opened the door to him and said to him if thou be a man it is need
that thou labor ageyn for to be fed / and if thou be an aungel wherefore
desyrest thou to enter here in / and Johan said / O brother foryeue it me / for
I have sinned / and when he should deye his brethern prayed him that he would
leave to them instead of heritage a word of health / and that short and then
he syghed and said / I did never yet mine own will / Ne I never did thing to
any other but I did it first my self / Hec in vitis patrum /

Here follows of the abbot Moses
Moses the Abbotte said to a brother of his which demanded of him a sermon /
to whom he said sit stylle in thy celle and it shall teache the all thing /
There was an old man being seek which would goo in to egipte by cause he would
not grieve his ^re^^ern / The abbotte moses said to him / goo not thither / for
if thou goo out / thou shall fall in to fornycacyon / and he was angry / and
said my body is deed / why say thou so / and when he was goon / it happed
that a maid served him for devotion and kept him in his maladye / and when he
was hool he defowled her / and gate on her a child / and when the child was
born the old man took the child in his arms / and came on a day of a great
feste in to the church of Syte to a great multitude of people / and when his
brothern wept he said / lo see ye this child this is the sone of Inobedyence
/ therefore beware ye brethern / for I have done this in mine old age / I pray
you pray ye for me / and then he returned in to his celle and came ageyn to
his first astate / and in like wise as another old man said to another I am as
a deed man / and that other said to him / trust never to thy self till thy
soul issue out of thy body / For if thou say that thou art deed /
nevertheless thyn enemy the fend is not deed / There was a brother which
had sinned / and was sent by his bre^hern to the abbot moses / And he took a
basket full of grauel / and came to them / and they demanded him what it was /
and he said these been my sins that run after me / and I see them not / and
I am this day comen to deem the sins of a stranger / They heryng this spared
their brother A like thing is read of the abbotte tofore him / For when the
brethern spoke of a brother that was culpable he held him stylle and spoke not
/ And after took a sack full of gravel and bare it behind him the most part
/ and a little tofore him / and they demanded him what it was / and he said /
the most part ben my sins which I bear behind me / them I consider not /
ne sorrow for them / And this little that I have before me / been the sins of
my brethern / which I consydere alday and Judge them / how be it I should alweye
bear mine own sins tofore me / and think on them and pray to god for them
that he would forgive me them / when thabbot moses was made clerk / and the
bishop had ordained thoffyce / he said to him now thou art made all white /
and moses said / wythinforth / or with outforth / Then the bishop would
prove him and said to his c^erkys that when he should come to the altar they
should wrongfully put him fro hit / and follow him / and here what he would say /
and anon they put him aweye and said lo him / goo out thou ethyopyen / and as
he went out he said / they have done well to the ^oule wretch for to defoule
and do dspyte to the / For sithe thou art no man / what presumest thou to be
/ emonge the men / this said he to him self / Hec in vitas patrum /

Here follows of Saint Arsenye
When arsenye was yet master in the paleys of a prince / he prayed unto god
that he would address him unto the weye of health / so that in a time he herd
a voys that said to him / arsenye flee the company of men / and thou shalt be
saved / then he went and took upon him the life of a monk / and as he prayed
there / he herd a voys saying arsenye / flee hens / speak not / and rest the
/ It is read in the same place as to coueyte this rest / that there were three
monks new made / and the first of them chaas for to bring men that were at
debate and in dyscorde / to rest and pees / The second for to vysyte seek men
/ and the third for to rest in wilderness and in deserte / The first man
that labored to set them at accord that were at debate / could not plese al
men / and was weary and greuyd and half overcome came to the second and fond
him al mate and fayllyng for werynesse / and myt not perform that he had
emprysed / and then by assente they two came to the third that was in deserte
/ and when they had told their trebulacions to him / he put water in a cup /
and said / look and behold this water / and they saw that it was thycke and
troubled / and sone after he said see hit now / how it is now fair and (...) /
and when they looked therein they saw their vysages therein / and then he said
who so ever dwell emonge the men / he may not for the multitude of people see
his sins / but when be rests / then he may see his sins / And on a time
there was a man fond another in deserte etyng herbys and grass all naked as a
be / and he ran after him / and that other fled and he that followed said
/ abide and tarry / for I follow the for the love of god / and that other said
I flee fro the for gods sake / and that other cast aweye his mantel fro him
/ and then he tarried / and said / by cause thou haste thrown the matere of
the world fro the / I have abyden the / And then he axyd of him how shall I be
saved / and he answered and said flee fro the company of men / and say no
thing / There was a noble lady which was old came for to see thabbot
arsenyen by devotion / and theophybe the archebysshop prayed him that he would
suffer that she might see him / ^ut he would not grant him in no^ wise / and
at the last she went unto his cell^ / and fond him without tofore his door /
and she fyl down to his feet / and he took her up with great Indygnacyon saying
to her / if thou will see my face / see / and she for great shame and
confusyon considered not his vysage / To whom he said how durst thou presume
upon the that art a woman to make such a vyage thou shalt now goo to Rome
and say to other wymmen / that thou have seen arsenyen / and they shall also
come for to see me / and she said to him / if god will that I return to Rome /
I shall never styre woman to come to the but only I pray the that thou pray
for me / and alweye remember me / and he said to her I pray to god that he put
out of my heart the rememberaunce of the / and when she herd that / she was
much angry / and came in to the cite / and began to tremble and shake for
sorrow in the fevers or access / and when the archebysshop knew it / he went
for to comfort her and she said I deye for sorrow and heaviness / and the
archebysshop said to her / know thou not that thou art a woman / and the
fend ouercometh holy men often times by wymmen / And therefore the old man said
to the those words / how be it he prayed alweye for thy soul / and then the
woman was comforted and was all hoole and returned home to her own hows /
Also it is read of another old fader / that when his dyscyple said to him /
Thou art woxen all old fader / let us now goo dwell nerre to the world /
and he said / let us goo thither where as no woman is and his dyscyple said /
where is any place but that wymmen been therein / saufe in deserte / to whom he
said / Then bring me in to that deserte / There was another brother which
wha^ he bare his mother over the water / he wonde his hondes in his mantell / To
whom she said wherefore have thou couerd thy hands so my sone / to whom he
answered / the body of a woman is as fire that brennyth / and by cause the mind
of other wymmen should not come in my remembrance / therefore I do it / And
arsenye all the days of his life / when he satte at the work of his hands /
he had a lynnen clothe in his bosom for to dry with the teerys that ran
fast from his eyes / and all the night he would not sleep / and in the
morning when he must sleep for werynesse of nature / He would say to sleep /
come wicked servant / and then would take a little sleep syttyng / and would
arise anon and said / It suffyseth to a monk / if he sleep an hour / if he
be a fyghter against vices / When the fader of saint arsenye which was a great
senator / and a right noble man should fynysshe his life / he left to arsenyen
by his testamente much heritage / and one magystryen brought unto him the
said testament and when he had received it he would have broken it / Then
magystryen fyl down at his feet prayeng him that he would not do so / for his
head then should he lose / for it should he smyton of To whom arsenyen said /
I was deed tofore him / he therefore that is but now deed / how may he make me
his heir / and sent ageyn the testamente / and would no thing have / On a
time there was a voys came to him / and said / come and I shall show to the
the werkys of the men / And ladde him in to a certain place and showed to him a
man of ethyope that is a black man / that hew wode and made a great fardel /
so great that he might not bear hit / and alweye be hew / and put to the
fardel / and thus he did long / and after he showed to him a man that drew
water out of a lake / and cast it in to a cesterne perced / by which the
water ran ageyn in to the lake / and he would fylle the cesterne and might not
/ And after he showed to him a temple and a man on horse back / which bare a
long tree thwarte / and would enter in to the temple / and be might not / by
cause the tree lay thwarte / Then he expawned him this thing and said / he
that bears the tree is / like the burden of Justice with pride and will not
meke him / therefore he abides without the royame of heaven / And he that
heweth the wood / is a man that is in sin / And puts none aweye by
penance / but puts alweye wickedness to wickedness / And he that draws
the water is a man that does good werkys here in this present world /

but by cause that his evil werkis ben medlyd with them / he loses his good
werkys / and when the euensonge time of the satyrday came / on the sunday he
left al his werkys behind him / and held up his hands to heaven till the
son aroos in the morning of the sunday tofore his face / and so abode all
the night in prayers and in orisons / and hec in vitis patrum /

Here follows of the abbotte Agathon
AGathon the abbotte bare iij year a stone in his mowthe / till that he had
lernyd to keep scylence / and there was another which entrid in to the
congregation that said within him self / thou and an ass been of one kind /
for like as an ass is beten and speaks not / and suffers wrong without
answeryng / right so do thou and another brother was put fro the table and he
answered nothing / and afterward he was axyd / and he said I have put in my
heart / that I am like to an hounde for when he is chastysed / he goes his
way out / and it was demanded of agathon what virtue was more than labor /
and he answered I trow there be no labor so great as to pray to god / for the
fend labors alweye to break his prayer / and in other labors a man has
sum rest / and he that prays has all weye need of great stryf / a brother
demanded of agathon how he ought to dwell with his brethern / to whom he
said / like as the first day / and take on the no trust / but suffraunce / for
suffraunce is not worse than trust / for suffraunce is mother of al passions /
and then keep the fro ire / for if the yrons raised deed men / it should not
plese god ne none other / for his ire / there was abrother that was angry said
to him self / if I were allone I should not be so sone angry / On a time as he
filled a pot with water / and he poured it out ageyn / and he filled it the
second time / and poured it out alweye / and then he was so moeuyd for anger
that he brake the pot / and then he aduysed him self and knew that he was
deceived of the devil of wrath and of ire / and said I am allone and yet I am
overcome by wrath / and therefore I shall return to my congregation / for oueral
is labor / and oueral is pacyence and need of the help of god / and two other
brethern were contrary which had long conuersed to gyder / and might not be
meued to wrath / and on a time that one sad to that other let us make
contencions to gyder like as men of ^he world do / and that other said I wot
not how contencyon is made / and that other said I shall lay this sack in the
myddel between us / and I shall say it is mine / and thou shalt say it is not
so / but it is mine / and thus shall the stryf be made / and then that one
laid the sack so / and said it is mine / and that other said nay / but it is
mine / and that other said then / thyn be it / take it and goo thy way / and
thus they departed and could not strive to gyder / Thabbot agathon was wise to
understand / not slow to labor / scarce in mete and clothyng / and said he
had never slepte at his will / having in my heart any sorrow against any other
/ or any other against me / when agathon should deye he held him three days
without moeuyng holdyng alweye his eyes open to heaven / And when his brethern
rored or styred him / He said I am tofore the Judgment of god / And they said
why / doubtest thou / And he said I have labored with all the virtue that I
might to keep the commandments of god / But I am a man and I wot not if my
werkys shall please our Lord / And they said ^u^stest not thou in thy werkys
which thou have done for god / and he said I shall not presume till I come tofore
him / For the Iugementes of god ben other than the Iugementes of men / And when
they would yet have axyd him sum thing he said show to me charity / and
speak no more to me for I am ocupyed / and when he had said this / he yielded up
his spirit with joy / and they saw our lord and his aungellys receyuyng his
spirit / and salewyng / like as a man saleweth his friends / all this is
wryton in vitis patrum /

Here follows of Balaam the Hermyte
BAlaam of whom saint Johan damascene made the hystorye with great dyligence /
In whom deuyne grace so wroughte that he convert to the feythe saint Iosaphat
/ and then as al ynde was full of christian people and of monks / there aroos a
puyssaunt king wiche was named anemyr which made great persecucion to christian
men and specially to monks / and it happed so that one which was friend of
the king and thyef in his paleys / by the Inspiracion of deuyne grace left
the halle ryal / for to enter in to the order of monks / and when the king
herd say that he was christian he was wode for anger / and did do seche him
thorugh every deserte til that he was found with great pain / and then he
was brought tofore him / and when he saw him in a vile cote and much le^e for
hungre / which was wont to be couerd with precious clothing and habounded in
much rechesse and said to him o thou fool and out of thy mind / why have thou
changed thyn honor in to vylonye / and art made the player of children / and
he said to him if thou wylt here of me reason / put fro the thyn enemies /
then the king demanded him who were his enemies / and he said to him ire and
couetyse / for they empesshe and let / that truth may not be seen / ne to
assaye prudence / and equity To whom the king said / let it be as thou say
/ and that other said / the foles despise the things that been / like as they
were not / and he that has not the taste of the things that been / he shall
not use the swetnesse of them / and may not learn the truth of them that been
not / and when he had showed many things of the mysterye of thyncarnacion /
the king said to him if I had not promised the at beginning that I should put
aweye ire fro my counceyl I should cast thy body in to the fire / Goo thy weye
and flee fro mine eyes that I see the no more / and that I now dystresse the not
/ and anon the man of god went his way al heuyly / by cause he had not
suffered marterdom / Thus then in this mean while it happyd that the king
which had no child / there was a fair sone borne of his wife / and was called
Iosaphat and then the king assemblyd a right great company of people for to
make sacrefyse to his gods for the natyuyte of his sone / and also assemblid
lv astronomyens / of whom he inquired what should befalle of his sone / and they
said to him that he should be great in power and in richesses / and one more
wise than another said / sir this child that is born shall not be in thy reygne
/ but he shall be in another much better without comparyson / and know thou
that I suppose that he shall be of christian relygyon / Which thou persecutest /
and that said not he of him self / but he said it by Inspyracyon of god / And
when the king herd that he doubted much and did do make without the cite a
ryt noble paleys / and therein set he his sone for to dwell and abide / and
set right fair yongelynges / and commanded them that they should not speak
to him of death / ne of old age / ne of sekenes / ne of pouerte ne of no thing
that may give him cause of heaviness but say to him all things that been joyous
/ so that his mind may be esprysed with gladness / and that he think on no
thing to come / and anon as any of his servants were seek / The king
commanded for to take hem aweye / and set another hool in his stead / and
commanded that no mencyon should be made to him of Ihesu christ / In that time
was with the king a man which was secretly christian / and was chyef emonge
all the noble princes of the king / and as he went on a time to hunte with
the king / he fond a pour man lyeng on the ground / which was hurt on the
foot of a be / which prayed that he would receive him / and that he might of
him be helped by sum mean / and the knight said I shall receive the gladly /
but I wot not how thou may do any prouffyte / And he said to him I am a
leche of words / and if any be hurt by words I can well give him a medecyne /
and the knight set it at naught all that he said / but he received him one
lie for gods sake / and helyd him and then sum princes enuyous and
malycyous saw that this prince was so great and gracyous with the king
accused him to the king / and said that he was not only turned to the
christian feythe / but enforced to with draw fro him his royame / and that he
moeuyd and solycyted the company and counceylled them thereto / And if thou
will know it said they / then call him secretelye / and say to him that
this life is sone done / and therefore thou will leave the glory of the world
and of thy royame and afferme that thou will take the habyte of monks / whom
thou haste so persecuted by ygnoraunce / and after thou shalt see what he
shall answer and when the king had done all like as they had said / the
knight that knew no thing of the treason began to weep and praised much
the counceyll of the king / and remembryd him of the vanytee of the world and
counceylled him to do it as soon as be might / and when the king herd him
say so / he supposed it had been true that the other had said to him how be
it he said no thing / and then he understood and apperceyued that the king
had taken his words in evil and went and told all this unto the leche of
words all by order / and he said to him / know thou for truth that the
king feryth that thou will assaylle his royame / arise thou to morrow / and
shave of thyn here and do of thy vestementes / and clothe the in hayr in
manner of a monk / and goo erlye to the king / when he shall demand the
what thou menest / thou shalt answer / my lord king I am ready to follow the /
For if the way by which thou desyrest to goo be hard if I be with the it
shall be the lyghter to the / and like as thou haste had me in prosperyte / so
shalt thou have me in aduersyte / I am al ready / wherefore taryest thou / and
when he had this done and said by order / the king was abashed and repreuyd
the false men / and did to him more honor then he did before / and after
this the kings sone that was nourysshed in the paleys came to age and grew
and was plainly taught in all wysdom / and he meruaylled wherefore his fader
had so enclosed him / and called one of his servants which was most
famylyer with him (...) / and demanded him of this thing / / and said to him
that he was in great heaviness that he might not goo out / And that his mete
ne drink sauerid him not ne did him no good / and when his fader herd this /
he was full of sorrow / and anon he let do make ready horses and ioyeful
felawshyp to accompanye him in such wise that no thing dyshoneste should
happen to him and on a time thus as the kings sone went he met a mesel and
a blind man / and when he saw them he was abashed / and inquired what them
ayled and his servants said these ben passions that comen to men / and he
demanded if tho passions comen to all men / and they said nay / Then said he
ben they known which men shall suffer these passions / without dyffynycion /
and they answered who is he that may know thaduentures of men / and he began to
be much anguysshous for the Incustomable thing hereof / and another time he
fond a man much aged which had his chere frounced / his teth fallen and was
al crooked for age / whereof he was abashed and said he desired to know the
miracle of this vysyon / and when he knew that this was by cause he had lived
many yerys / and then he demanded what should be the end / and they said
death / and he said / is then the death the end of all men or of sum and
they said for certain that all men must deye / And when he knew that all
should deye / he demanded them in how many yerys that should happene / and they
said in old age of four score year or an hundred / and after that age the
death follows / and this young man remembryd often in his heart these things /
and was in great dyscomforte / but he showed him much glad tofore his fader /
and he desired much to be informed and taught in these things / And then
there was a monk of parfyte life and good opinion that dwelled in the deserte
of the land of Sennaar named balaam / And this monk knew by the holy ghoost
what was done about this kings sone / and took the abbyte of a marchaunte /
and came unto the cytee and spoke to the gretest governor of the kings sone /
and said to him I am a marchaunte and have a precious stone to selle which
gives sight to blind men / and heryng to deef men Hit makes the dombe to
speak / and gives wysedom to fools / and therefore bring me to the kings
sone / and I shall deliver it to him / To whom he said thou semest a man of
prudente nature / but thy words accord no thing to wysedom / Nevertheless
if I had knowleche of that stone / show it me / and if it be such as thou
say / and so proved / thou shall have right great honors of the kings
sone / To whom balaam said / my stone has yet such virtue / that he that
sees it / and has none hool sight and keeps not entyer chastyte / if he
happelye saw it / the virtue vysyble that he has he should lose it / and I
that am a physycyen see well that thou have not thy sight hoole / but I
understand that the kings sone is chaste and has right fair eyes and hoole
/ And then the man said if it be so show it not to me / For mine eyes ben not
hoole / and am foul of sin / and balaam said this thing apperteyneth to the
kings sone / and therefore bring me to him anon / and he anon told this to
the kings sone / and brought him anon in / And he received him honorably /
and then balaam said to him / thou have done well / for thou have not taken
head of my lytelnesse that apperyth wythoutforth / but thou have done like unto
a noble king / which when he rood in his cha^r cladde with clothes of gold
and met with pour men which were c^adde with torn clothes / And anon he
sprange out of his chare / and fyl down to their feet and worshypped them /
And after aroos and kyssed them / and his barons took this evil / and were
aferde to repreue him thereof / but they said to his brother how the king had
done thing against his ryal magestee / and his brother repreuyd him thereof /
and the king had such a custom that when one should be delyuerd to death /
the king should send his cryar with his trompe that was ordained thereto /

And on the even he sent the cryar with the trompe tofore his brothers gate /
and made to sown the trompe and when the kings brother herd this / He was in
dyspayr of saving of his life / and could not sleep of all the night and made
his testamente / and on the morn erlye he cladde him in black / and came
weeping with his wife and children to the kings paleys / and the king made him
come tofore him and said to him / a fool that thou art / if thou haste herd
the messager of thy brother / to whom thou know well thou have not trespaced
and doubtest so much / How ought not I then doubt the messagers of our
lord / against whom I have so often sinned / which sygnefyed unto me more
clearly the death then the trompe / and showed to me ho^rible coming of the
Judge / and after this he did do make four chestys / and did do cover two of
them with gold without forth / and did do fylle them with boones of deed men
and of fylthe / And the other two he did do pytche / And did do fylle them
with precious stones and rich gemmys / And after this the king did do call
his great barons by cause he knew well that they compleyned of him to his
brother / and did do set these four chestys tofore them and demanded of
them which were most precious and they said that the two that were gylte /
were most of valewe / Then the king commanded that they should be opened /
and anon a great stenche issued out of them / and the king said they be like
them that be clothed with precious vestementes / and been full wythinforth of
ordure and of sin and after he made opene the other / and there issued a
meruayllous sweet odor / and after the king said / these ben semblable to the
pour men that I met and honored / for though they be cladde of foul
vestymetens / yet shine they wythinforth with good odor of good virtues / and
ye take none head but to that wythoutforthe / and consydere not what is within
/ and thou have done to me like as that king did / For thou haste well received
me / and after this balaam began to tell to him a long sermon of the
creacyon of the world / and of the day of Judgment / and of the reward of
good and evil / and began strongelye to blame them that worship ydolles / and
told to him of their folly such an exaumple as follows saying / That an
archer took a little bird called a nyghtyngale / and when he would have slain
this nyghtyngale there was a voys given to the nyghtyngale which said / O thou
man what should it avail the if thou slay me / thou may not fylle thy belly
with me / but and if thou will let me goo / I shall teache the three wysedoms /
that if thou keep them dylygentely / thou may have great prouffyte thereby /
Then he was abashed of his words / and promised that he would let him goo /
if he would tell him his wysdoms / Then the bird said / study never to take
that thing that thou may not take / and of thing lost / which may not be
recoueryd / sorrow never therefore / ne believe never thing that is Incredyble /
keep well these three things / and thou shalt do well / and then he let the
bird goo as he had promised / and then the nyghtyngale fleyng in the air
said to him / alas thou Wretched man thou haste had evil counceyl / for thou
have lost this day great tresour / For I have in my bowellys a precious
margaryte / which is gretter then the egg of an ostryche / and he herd
that / he was much wroth and sorowed sore by cause he had leten her goo / and
enforced him all that he could to take her again saying / Come ageyn to my hows
/ and I shall show to the al humanyte / and give to the all that shall need the
/ and after shall let the goo honorably / where as thou will Then said the
nyghtyngale to him Now I know well that thou art a fool / for thou have no
prouffyte in the wysedoms that I have said to the / For thou art right
sorouful for me whom thou have lost / which am Irrecuperable / and yet thou
wenest to take me / where thou may not come so high as I am / and
furthermore where thou byleuest to be in me a precious stone more then the
egg of an ostrytche / when all my body may not atteyne to the gretenesse of
such an egg / And in like wise be they foolys that adoure and trust in
ydolles / for they worship that which they have made / and call them whom
they have maad kepars of them / and after he began to dyspute ageynste the
fallace of the world and delight and vanyte thereof / and brought forth many
ensaumples and said / They that desire the delytes corporalle / and suffer
their sowles deye for hungre / ben like to a man that fled tofore an vnycorn
that he should not devour him / and in fleyng / he fyl in to a great pytte /
and as he fyl he caughte a branch of a tree with his hand / and set his
feet upon a slydyng place / and then two myse that one white / and that other
black which without cessyng gnewe the rote of the tree /

And had almost gnawen it a sondre And he saw in the bottom of this pytte an
horrible dragon castyng fire and had his mouth opene and desired to devour
him / upon the slydyng place on which his feet stood / he saw the heedes of
four serpents which yssueden there / and then he left up his eyes and
saw a little honey that henge in the bows of the tree / and forgate the peril
that he was in / and gave him al to the swetenes of that little honey / the
unicorn is the figure of death / which contynuelly follows man / and desires
to take him / The pytte is the world which is full of al wickedness / the tree
is the life of every man / which by the two myse that been the day and night and
the hours thereof Incessantly ben wasted and approached to the cuttyng or
gnawyng a sonder / the place where the iiij serpents were is the body ordained
by the four ebementes / by which the ioynture of the membrys is corupte in
bodies dyshordynate / The orrible dragon is the mouth of hell which desires
to devour al creatures / The swetenes of the honey in the bows of the tree /
is the false deceyuable delectacyon of the world / by which man is deceived /
so that he takes no head of the peril that he is in / and yet he said that
they that love the world ben semblable to a man that had three friends / of
which he loved the first as much as him self / and he louyd the second less
then him self / and louyd the third a little or naught / and it happed so that
this man was in great peril of his life / and was somoned tofore the king /
then he ran to his first friend and demanded of him his help / and told
to him how he had alweye louyd him / to whom he said / I have other friends
with whom I must be this day / and I wot not who thou art / therefore I may
not help the / yet nevertheless I shall give to the two sloppes with which
thou may cover the / and then he went aweye much sorouful / and went to
that other friend / and required also his aid / and he said to him I may not
attend to goo with the to this debate / for I have great charge / but I shall
yet felawshyp the unto the gate of the paleys / and then I shall return ageyn
and do mine own needs / and then he being heavy and as despayred went to the
third friend and said to him / I have no reason to speak to the / ne I have
not loved the as I ought / but I am in trybulacion and without friends / and
pray the that thou help me / and that other said with glad chere / certes I
confess to be thy dear friend / and have not foryeten the little benefayte that
thou haste done to me / and I shall goo right gladly with the tofore the king /
for to see what shall be demanded of the and I shall pray the king for the /
The first friend is possessyon of richesse For which man puts him in many
perils / and when the death comes / he has no more of hit but a cloth for to
wind him for to be buried / The second friend is his sons / his wife and kynne
/ which goo with him to his grane / and anon return for to entende to their
own ne des / The third friend is feythe hope and charity and other good werkys
/ Which we have done / that when w^yssue out of our bodies / they may well goo
tofore us and pray god for us / and they may well deliver us fro the deuylles
our enemies / and yet he said according to this / that in a certain cite is a
custom / that they of the cite shall chese every year a strange man and
unknown for to be their prince / and they shall give him puyssaunce to do what
someuer he will / And govern the contree without any other constytucion / and
he being thus in great delyces / and wenyng ever to continue / sodeynlye they
of the cytee should arise ageynste him / and led him naked thorugh the cite /
and after send him in to an isle in exyle / And there he should find neither
mete ne clothe / but should be constreyned to be perysshed for hungre and cold
/ And after that they would enhaunce another to the kingdom / and thus they
did long / At the last they took one which knew their custom And he sent
tofore him in to that isle great tresoure without nombre during all his year /

And when his year was accomplisplysshed and passed / he was put out and put to
exyle like the other / and where as the other that had been tofore him perysshed
for cold and hongre / he habounded in great rychesses and delyces / and this
cite is the world / and the cytezeyns ben the princes of derknesse / which
feed us with false delectacyon of the world / and then the death comes when
we take none head / and that we ben sent in exyle to the place of derkenesse /
and the rychesses that been tofore sent / ben don by the hands of pour men /
and when halaam had parfytely taught the kings sone / and would leave his fader
for to follow him balaam said to him if thou will do thus thou shall be
semblable to a young man / that when he should have wedd^d a noble wife / he
forsook her and fled aweye / and came in to a place where as he saw a virgyn
daughter of an old pour man that labored / and preysed god with her mowthe /
To whom he said what is that thou do daughter that art so pour and alweye
thou thankest god like as thou had received great things of him / To whom
she said / like as a little medecyne often delyuereth a great langour and pain /
right so for to give to god thankynges alweye of a little yefte / is made a
gyuer of great yeftes for the things that been withoutforth ben not ours / but
they that be within us ben ours / and therefore I have received great things
of god / for he has made me like to his image / He has given to me
understanding / He has called me to his glory / and has opened to me the
yate of his kingdom and therefore for these yeftes it is syttyng to me to give
him praysyng / This young man seeing her prudence axed of her fader to have her
to wife To whom the fader said thou may not have my daughter / for thou art
the sone of rich and noble kynne / and I am but a pour man / but when he sore
desired her / the old man said to him / I may not give her to the sith thou
wylt led her home in to the hows of thy fader / for she is mine only daughter
and have no moo / And he said / I shall dwell with the and shall accord with
the in all things / and then he did of his precious vestementes / and did on
him the habyte of an old man / and so dwelling with him took her unto his wife
and when the old man had long preuyd him / he ladde him in to his chamber /
and showed to him great plente of rychesses more than he ever had / and gave to
him al / and then Iosaphat said to him / this narracyon touches me couenably
/ and I trow thou have said this for me / Now say to me fader how many year
art thou old / and where conuersest thou / For fro the I will never depart /
To whom balaam said / I have dwelled xlv year in the deserte of the land of
Sennaar / To whom Iosaphat said / thou semest better to be lxx year / and he
said if thou demaundest all the years of my natyuyte / thou have well esteemed
them but I accounte not the nombre of my life / them specially that I have
dyspended in the vanytee of the world / For I was then deed toward god and I
nombre not the yerys of death / with the yerys of life / and when Iosaphat would
have followed him in to deserte balaam said to him / if thou do so / I shall not
have thy company / and I shall be then thauctor of persecucyon to my brethern
/ but when thou see time couenable / thou shall come to me / and then
balaam baptized the kings sone / and informed him well in the feythe / and
after returned in to his celle / and a little while after the king herd say
that his sone was crystened / wherefore he was much sorouful / and one that was
his friend named Arachys recomfortyng him said / Sir king I know right well
an old hermyte that resembles much balaam / and he is of our sect / He shall
feign him as he were balaam / and shall deffende first the feyth of christian men
/ and after shall leave and return fro it / and thus your sone shall return to
you / and then the king went in to deserte as it were to seche balaam and
took this hermyte and feigned that he had taken balaam / and when the kings
sone herd that balaam was taken he wept bytterlye / but afterward he knew
by reuelacyon deuyne that it was not he / Then the king went to his sone
and said to him thou have put me in great heaviness / thou have dishonored mine
old age / thou have derked the light of mine eyes / sone why have thou done so
/ thou have forsaken the honor of my gods and he answered to him I have
fled the derkenessys / and am comen to the light / I have fled error and
know truth / and therefore trauaylle the for naught / for thou may never
wythdrawe me fro Ihesu christ / For like as it is Impossyble to the to touch
the heaven with thy hand / or for to dry the great see / so is it to the for
to change me / Then the fader said / who is cause hereof / but I my self /
that so gloryously have do nourysshed the / that never fader nourisshed more
his sone / For which cause thyn evil will has made the wood against me / and
it is well right / For the astronomyens in thy natyuyte said / that thou
sholdest be proud and dyshobedyente to thy parents / but and thou now will
not obey me / thou shalt no more be my sone / and I shall be thyn enemy for a
fader / and shall do to the that I never did to mine enemies / To whom Iosaphat
said / fader wherefore art thou angry / by cause I am made a partyner of good
things / what fader was ever sorouful in the prosperyte of his sone / I shall
no more call the fader / but and if thou be contrary to me I shall flee the as
a serpente / Then the king departed from him in great anger / and said to
arache his friend all the hardness of his sone and he counceylled the king
that he should give him no sharp words / for a child is better reformed by
fair and sweet words / The day following the king came to his sone and began
to clyppe enbrace and kiss him / and said to him my right sweet sone honor
thou mine old age / sone dread thy fader / know thou not well that it is good
to obey thy fader and make him glad / and for to do contrary it is sin /
and they that anger them sin evil / to whom Iosaphat said there is time to
love / and time to hate time of pees / and time of bataylle / and we ought in
no wise love them / ne obey to them that would put us aweye fro god be it fader
or mother / And when his fader saw his steadfastness / he said to him / syche I
see thy folly and will not obey to me Come / and we shall know the troth For
balaam which has deceived the is bounden in my prison / and let us assemble
our people with balaam / and I shall send for all the galylees / that they may
saufly come without dread and dyspute / and if that ye with you balaam overcome
us / we shall believe and obey you / and if we overcome you ye shall consent to
us / and this plesyd well to we king / and to Iosaphat / and when they had
ordained that he that named him balaam should first deffende the feythe of
christ / And suffer him after to be ouercomen and so were all assemblyd /
Then Iosaphat turned him toward nachor which feigned him to be balaam / and
said balaam thou know well how thou haste taught me / and if thou deffende
the feyth that I have learned of the / I shall abide in thy doctrine to the end
of my life / and if thou be ouercomen I shall avenge me anon on the mine Iniurye
/ and shall pluck out the tongue out of thyn heed with mine hands / and give it
to dogs to the end that thou be not so hardy to put a kings sone in error /
And when nachor herd that he was in great fere and saw well that if he said
contrary he were but deed / and that he was taken in his own snare / and
then he aduysed that it were better to take and hold with the sone then
with the fader / For to eschew the peril of death / For the king had said to
him tofore them all / that he should deffende the feythe hardelye and without
dread / then one of the masters said to him thou art balaam / which have
deceived the sone of the king / and he said I am Balaam which have not put
the kings sone in any error / but I have brought him out of error / and
then the master said to him / right noble and mearuyllous men have
worshypped our gods / how dare thou then adresse the against them / and
he answered / they of caldee / of egypt / and of gre^e have erryd and sayden
that the creatures were gods / and the chaldees supposeden that the elements
had been gods which were created to the prouffyte of men / and the greeks
supposed that cursyd men and tyrauntes had be gods / as saturn / whom they
said ete his sone / and Iubyter which as they say gheldyd his fader and threw
his membrys in to the sea / whereof grew venus / and Iubyter to be king of the
other gods / by cause he transformed often him self in likeness of a be /
for to accomplysshe his aduoultrye / and also they say that venus is goddess
of aduoultrye / / and sometime mars is her husbond / and sometime adonydes / The
egypcyens worship the beestys / that is to wete a sheep / a calfe / a swyne /
or such other / and the christian men worship the sone of the right high
king / that descended fro heaven and took nature humayne / And then nachor
began clerelye to deffende the law of christian men / and garnysshed him with
many resons / so that the masters were al abashed and wyste not what to
answer / and then Iosaphat had great joy of that / which our lord had
deffended the truth / by him that was enemy of truth / and then the
king was full of wodenesse / and commanded that the counceyl should depart /
like as he would have tretyd ageyn on the morn of the same fayte / Then
Iosaphat said to his fader let my master be with me this night / to the end
that we may make our collacion to gyder / for to make to morrow our answers /
and thou shall led thy masters with the / and shall take counceyl with them /
and if thou led my master with the / thou do me no right wherefore he
granted to him nachor by cause he hoped that he should deceive him / and when
the kings sone was comen to his chamber / and nachor with him / Iosaphat said
to nachor / Ne wenest thou not that I know the / I wot well that thou art not
balaam / but thou art nachor the astronomyen / and Iosaphat preached then to
him the way of health / and conuertyd him to the feythe / and on the morn
sent him in to deserte / and there was baptized / and led the life of an
hermyte / Then there was an enchauntour named theodas / when he herd of this
thing / he came to the king and said that he should make his sone return and
believe in his gods / And the king said to him if thou do so / I shall make to
the an image of gold and offer sacrefyses thereto / like as to my gods / and
he said take aweye al them that been about thy sone and put to him fair wymmen
and well aourned / and command them all way to abide by him / and after I
shall send a wicked spyryte that shall enflamme him to luxurye / and there is
no thing that may so sone deceive the young men / as the beaulte of wymmen /
and he said yet more / there was a king which had with great pain a sone /
and the wise masters sayden that if he saw son or moan within ten year / he
should lose the syghte of his eyes /

Then hit was ordained that this child should be nourisshed within a pytte
made in a great roche / and when the ten year were passyd / The king
commmaunded that his sone should be brought forth and that all things should be
brought tofore him by cause he should know the names and tho things / and
then they brought to fore him Iewelles / horses and beestys of al manners /
and also gold / silver precious stones / and all other things and when he had
demanded the names of every thing / and that the mynystres had told him / he
set naught thereby / and when his fader saw that he retched not of such
things / then the king made to be brought tofore him wymmen quayntely
arrayed / and he demanded what they were / For they would not so lightly tell
him / whereof he was anoyed / and after the master squire of the king said
iapyng that they were deuylles that deceive men / Then the king demanded
him what he lyeuest had of all that he had seen / and he answered fader my soul
coueyteth no thing so much as the deuylles that deceive men / and therefore I
suppose that none other thing shall surmounte thy sone but wymmen which moeue
men all way to lecherye / then the king put out all his mynystres and
set therein to be about his sone rizt noble and fair maidens / which alweye
him admonested to play / and there were none other that might speak ne serve
him / and anon the enchauntour sent to him the devil for to inflame him which
brennyd the young man wythinforth / and the maidens wythoutforth / and when he
felt him so strongelye trauaylled he was much angry / and recommaunded him
self all to god / and he received deuyne comfort / in such wise that al
temptacyon departed from him / and after this that the king saw that the
devil had don no thing he sent to him a fair maiden a kings daughter which
was faderles / To whom this man of god preached and she answered if thou will
save me / and take me aweye fro worshyppyng of thydolles / conioyne the unto me
by couplyng of marriage / for the patryarkes / prophets / and peter the
appostle had wives / and he said to her / woman these words say thou now
for naught / It apperteyneth well to christian men to wedde wives / but not to
them that have promised to our lord to keep vyrgynyte /

And she said to him / now be it as thou will / but if thou will save my
soul / grant to me a little request / lie with me only this night and I
promise to the that to morn I shall be made christian / For as ye say the angels
have more joy in heaven of one synnar doing penance / then on many other /
There is great guerdon due to him that does penance / and conuerteth him /
therefore grant to me only this request / and so thou shalt save me / and
then she began strongely to assail the toure of his conscience / Then the
devil said to his felawes / loo see how this maid has strongely put forth
that we myt not moeue / Come then and let us knock strongely against him
sith we find now time couenable / And when the holy young man saw this thing
/ and that he was in that caytyfnes / That the couetyse of his flesh
admonested him to sin / and also that he desired the sauacyon of the maid /
by entysyng of the devil that moeuyd him / he then put him self to prayer in
weeping / and there fyl a sleep / and saw by a vysyon that he was brought in
to a medowe arrayed with fair flowers / there where the leuys of the trees
demened a sweet sound / which came by a wind agreeable / and thereut issued a
merueyllous odor / and the fruit was right fair to see / and right delectable
of taste / and there were setes of gold and silver and precious stones / and
the beds were noble and precyously aourned / and right clear water ran
there by / and after that he entered in to a cite of which the walls were of
fine gold / and shone by meruayllous clerenesse / and saw in the air sum
that sange a song / that never eer of mortal man herd like / and it was said
this is the place of blessed saints / and as they would have had him thens /
he prayed them that they would let him dwell there and they said to him / thou
shalt yet hereafter come hither with great travail if thou may suffer / and
after they led him in to a right horrible place full of al fylthe and stenche
/ and said to him this is the place of wicked people / and when he awoke him
seemed that the beauty of that damoysel was more foull and stynkyng then all
the other ordure / and then the wicked spyrytes came ageyn to theodose / and
he then blamyd them / to whom they said we ran upon him to fore he marked
with the sign of the cross / and troubled him strongelye and when he was
garnysshed with the sign of the cross / he persecuted us by great force /
Then theodose came to him with the king and had hoped that he should have
perverted him / But this enchauntour was taken of him / whom he supposed to
have taken and was converted and received baptesme / and lived after an holy
life and then the king was al despayred / and by counceyl of his friends he
delyuerd to him half his royame / and how be it that Iosaphat desired with
all his thought the deserte / yet for to encrece the feythe he received the
royame for a certain time / and maad chirches and raised crosses and converted
much people of his royame to the faith of Ihesu christ / and at last the
fader consented to the resons and predycacions of his sone and byleuyd on the
feythe of Ihesu christ / and received baptesme / and left his royame hole to
his sone / and intended to works of penance / and after fynysshed his life
laudably / and Iosaphat often warned the king barachye that he would goo in to
deserte / but he was retained of the people long time / but at last he
fled aweye in to deserte / and as he went in a deserte / he gafe to a pour
man his habyte ryal / and abode in a right pour gown / and the devil made to
him many assaults / for sometime he ran upon him with a sword drawn / and
menaced to smite if he left not the deserte / and another time he apperyd to
him in the form of a wild be / and fomed and ran on him as he would have
devoured him / and then Iosaphat said / Our Lord is mine helpar / I doubt no
thing that man may do to me / and thus Iosaphat was two year vagaunte and
erryd in deserte / and could not find balaam and at the last he fond a cave
in the earth and knockyd at the door and said / Fader bless me / and anon
balaam herd the voys of him / and roos up and went out / and then each
kyssed other and enbraced straytelye / and were glad of their assemblyng / and
after Iosaphat recounted to balaam al these things that were happened / And he
rendryd and gave thankynges to god therefore / and Iosaphat dwelled there many
years in great and meruayllous penance full of virtues / and when balaam had
accomplysshed his days / he restyd in pees about the year of our lord four
hundred and four score Iosaphat left his royame the xxv year of his age / and
led the life o^ an hermyte five and thyrty year / and then restyd in pees
full of virtues / and was buried by the body of balaam / and when the king
barachyas herd of this thing he came unto that same place with a great
company / and took the bodies and bare them with much great honor in to
his cytee where god has showed many fair miracles at the tomb of these two
precious bodies /

Thus ends the story of balaam and Iosaphat
Here follows the historye of Saint Pelagyen the Pope with many other
historyes and gestis of the Lombardes / and of Machomete with other chronicles /
PElagieu the Pope was of much great holiness / and demened him lawdably in
the sea of rome / and in his last end he ended in our lord full of virtues /
but this was not that pelagyen the predecessor of saint gregory / but another
tofore him / To this Pelagyen succeeded Johan the third / and to Johan benedycte
To benedycte Pelagyus / to Pelage Gregore / In the time of this Pelage came the
lombardes in to ytalye / and by cause many know not this hystorye / I have
ordained it to be set here / like as it is set in thystorye of the
lombardes which paul the hystoryagraphe of lombardes has compyled and
expowned in diverse chronicles / He says that there was a multitude of people of
germanye issued fro the ryuage of the sea occean and saylled toward the north
fro the isle of scandynare and enuyronned many contrees and made many bataylles
/ And at the last they came in to panonye / and durst not goo ferther / and
there astablysshed to hold their perpetuel habytacyon / These men were called
hunes / and afterward they were called lombardes / and yet as they were in
germanye / Agamon king of the lombardes fond seven children cast in to a
pyscyne for to be drowned / which were borne at one burden of a common woman /
and when the king had them founden by caas of adventure / he meruaylled much /
and with his spear he began to torn and moeue them and one of the children
took and held the spear with his hand / and when the king saw that he was
abashed and made him to be taken and nourisshed / and called him great
lamyssyon / and said that he should be of so great puyssaunce that after the
death of the king of the lombardes / he should be made king of them / about
that same time in the year of our lord four hundred and four score there was a
bishop of the heresye arryen as says Eutropyus which would have baptized one
named barnabe / and when he said barnabe I baptyse the in the name of the fader
/ by the sone with the holy ghoost / by which he would show / the sone and
holy ghoost to be less then the fader / and anon the water vanysshed aweye
/ and he that should have be baptized fled to the church for to be baptized /
In that time flouryd medarde and gyldarde brethern both of one burden and
borne in one day / and both made bysshoppes in one day / and in one day both
they deyden in our lord / and tofore this time it is said in a cronycle about
the year of our lord four hundred and one / as the heresye arryen grew in
france / The unity of the substance of three persons was showed by opene
miracle like as phylyberte reherseth / for as the bishop sange mass in the
cite of vssanence / he saw three dropes right clear al of one gretenesse which
were upon the altar / and all three ran to gyder in to a precious gemme /
and when they had set this gemme in a cross of gold / all the other
precious stones that were there fyllen out / and this gemme was clear to them
that were clean out of sin / and it was obscure and derke to sinners / and it
gave health to them that were seek / and encreaced them that worshypped the
cross / after this reygnyd a king upon the lombardes which was named albuyne
a strong man and a noble which had a bataylle with the king of the gebydayns
/ and destroyed their host / and slew their king / wherefore the sone of the
king that was sleyne succeeded his fader / and came with a great puyssaunte
army against albuyne for to venge his fader / And albuyne moeuyd his strength
ageynste him / and surmounted him and slew him / and ladde aweye with him
Rosamounde his wife in captyuyte / but after he took her to his wife / and he did
do make a cup of the skulle of that king and closed it in fine gold and
silver / and drank out of hit / In that time Iustynus the less gouernyd
thempyre / which had a prince chaast named Narses / which was a noble man and
strong / which went to bataylle against the ghothes that then had taken al
ytalye and he surmounted them and slew their king / and made pees in all
ytalye / and after yet for all his great vyctorye and weel he suffered great
envy of the romans / For he was falsely accused unto the emperor and the wife
of the emperor named Sophye did to him so great despyte that she sent him
word that she should make him to spynne and clyppe wulle with her chamberees /
to whom narses sent her answer saying / I shall so pourchaas to set such
a clothe in thy lommes / that during thy life thou shalt not fynysshe it ne
take it down / Then Narses went to Neopolyn / and sent to the lombardes /
that they should leave that pour land of panonnye / and that they should
poursyewe the right plentyuous land of ytalye / and when albuyne herd this
thing / he left panonnye and entryd with his lombardes in to ytalye the year
of our lord vj hundred lxviij / and they were acustomed to have long berdys /
wherefore on a time as it is said certain espyes came tespye them whereof albuyne
had know leche / and commanded that all the wymmen should unbind their here /
and bind it under their chynnes in such wise / that they should seem men / And
therefore were they called longebardes / and so after lombardes / and al by
cause of long berdes / and other say when they ought fight with the
wandelyens or wandellys / they went to a man that had a spyryte of prophecye
for to pray for them / and that he should bless them / and by counceyl of his
wife they should put them by the wyndowe where as he prayed toward thorryente /
and the wymmen put their here about their chynnes instead of berdes / and
when he opened his wyndowe and saw them / he escryeth and said / who ben these
longeberdes / and then his wife said to him / that he should give the vyctorye
to them that he had named / Then entryd they in to ytalye / and took almost
all the cytees / and slew al thynhabytans / and assyeged three year pauye /
and at the last they took it / and the king albuyn had swore that he should
slay all the christian men / and as he should enter in to pauye his horse knelyd
tofore the gate of the cite / and could not make him to arise with his spores /
ne in none other manner / till by the warning of a christian man he had changed
his oath / and fro thens came the lombardes to mylane / and in a little time
they subdued to them al ytalye saufe Rome and romanyole / which alweye was
adheraunte to rome / for it held alweye with rome / and when the king albuyne
came to verone / and had ordained a great feste / He commanded to bring
forth the cup that he had do make of the heed of the king / and did drink
thereof / and gave hit to Rosamounde his wife and said drink with thy fader /
and when rosamounde knew it / she had great desdayne / and hate toward the
king / and the king had a duc which held and lay by a damoysel of the
queen's / and on a time she was out / and the queen entryd in to her chamber
and sent for the duc in the name of the same damoyselle / And when he was come
and had done his will / she said to him wotest thou who I am / and he said ye
are my love and she said nay / I am rosamounde the queen / wherefore / my
husbonde shall be angry / but I pray the that thou wylt avenge me on him /
for he has slain my fader / and has do made a cup of his heed / and has
made me for to drink thereof / and he would not grant her / but promised to
her that he should find one that should do hit / Then when he should come she
took aweye the kings arms and bond fast his sword in the shethe / so that
he myt not draw it out / which henge at his beds head / and when the king
was a sleep in his bed / the homycyde enforced him to enter in to the chamber
and when the king felt him he sprange up and took his sword / but he might
not draw it out / and began strongely to deffende him with a stole / but that
other which was well armed preuaylled on the king and slew him / And took
all his tresoure / and went with rosamounde to rauenne / and when rosamounde
was in rauenne / she saw a fair young man which was prouoste of the town /
and desired to have him to her husbonde / and she gave to her husbonde to
drink / and anon he felt the bytternesse of the venym / and commanded to
Rosamounde for to drink the resydue / which she refused / and he took his
sword and constrained her to drink it / and thus they perysshed and deyed
both to gyder / and after this the lombardes made a king named adolaoth which
was baptized / and received the feythe of christ / and theodolyne queen of the
lombardes a devout and most christian lady ordained at melane a much fair
oratorye / To whom saint Gregory sent the books of dyaloges / and she
converted agysulphe her husbonde to the feythe / which had first been duc of
Taurynense / and after was king of the lombardys / and he maad pees to be had
with the Emperor / and with the church / and the pees was maad between the
Romans and the lombardes the day of the feste of saint Geruase and saint
prothase / and therefore establysshed saint gregory to sing the office in the
mass / Loquetur dominus pacem / And in the natyuyte of Saint Johan baptyst the
pees was al confermyd / and this Theodolyn had a specyal devotion to the
blessed saint Johan / and said that by the merit of him her people was
converted and to him she made the said oratorye at melane / and it was showed
by reuelacyon unto an holy man that saint Johan was patron and deffendour of
her people / and when gregory was deed sabyne succeeded after him / and to him
succeeded boneface the third / and to him boneface the fourth / at whose request
Focas the emperor gafe to the church of christ the temple of Pantheon /
about the year of our lord vj hundred and ten / and he at the request of the
third boneface establysshed the sea of Rome to be chyef and head of all the
church / For tofore the church of constantynople wrote her seef grettest of
all other chyrches / And when Focas was deed / Heracle reigned / and about
the year of our lord vj hundred and ten / machomete the false prophet and an
enchauntour deceived the agarenes or ysmaelytes / that is to say the sarazyns
in this maneee as it is read / in an hystorye of him in a certain cronycle /
There was a clerk much renomed at rome which could not come to the worship
that he desired / and in great desdayne departed thens in to the parties over
the sea / and drew to him by his symylacyon much people / and fond machomete
/ and said to him that he would make him lord and chyef of all the people / and
after he nourisshed a dowue and laid whete and other corn in the eerys of
Machomete / and set the dowue upon his sholdre / and fed him out of his eer
/ and was so used and acustomed that alwey when he saw machomete he flewe on
his sholdre / and put his bylle or beck in his eer / and then this clerk
called the people and said that he would make him lord over them all / On whom
the holy ghoost should descend in the likeness of a culuer or a dowue / And
then he le^^ the dowue flee secretelye / and he fled upon the sholdre of
machomete which was emonge the other / and put his beck in his eer / And when
the people saw this thing / they supposed that the holy ghoost had descendyd
on him / and had showed unto him in his eere the word of god / and thus
deceived machomete the sarasyns / which with his adherentes assaylled the
royalme of Perse / and all the parties of the orryente unto Alysaundre / Thus
it is said comy^lye / but this that shall here follow is had fro more trewer
hystorye / For then machomete made and feigned his laws to be made of the
holy ghoost which in the sight of the people often came unto him in the form
of a dowue / and in his laws he put sum things of the old and new
testamente / For when he was in his first eage he haunted egypt and Palestyne
and was a marchaunte and ladde camellys / and conuersyd of te with Jews and
with christian men of whom he had taken the old testamente and the new and
after the custom of the Jews the sarasyns ben circumcysed / and ete no swynes
flesh / And machomet^ told hem that the cause was / that the Swyne was made
of the donge of the camel after noes flode / and therefore it ought to be
eschewed / as an unclean be of clean people / and to christian men they accord
/ where as they believe on god almighty maker of all thing / And this false
prophet meddlid and affermyd sum true things with the false / he said that
moses was a great prophet / but christ was gretter and most souerayn of the
prophets / and was borne of the vyrgyne marye without seed of man / and he
says in his book that is called alcharon / that when christ was a child he
made birds of the slyme of the earth / but he meddlyd venym with his words /
For he said that Ihesu christ was not verayly deed / ne aroos not ageyn but
that it was another in likeness of him that he had put in his stead There was
a lady named Cadygam which was lady of a prouynce named cerotanye / and saw
that this machomete was kepar and governor of a great company of sarasyns and
Jews and supposed that deuyne mageste had be in him hid / and she was a
wydowe / and she took machomete to her husbonde / and thus was machomete prince
of all that prouynce / and after by false demonstraunces he deceived not
only this lady / but he deceived Jews and christian men / so that he said to
them openly that he was messyas that was promised in their law / and after
this machomete fyl often he thepylentycal passion / and when the lady his wife
^^we him often fall / she was much sorouful that she had wedded him / and he
thought to plese her / and appeased her in this wise and said that he saw
often the aungel gabryel which spoke to him / and that he might not suffer the
bryghtnesse of him / wherefore he must fall by cause he might not sustene him /
and his wife / and other supposed and byleuyd that it had been true / and in
another place it is read that a monk named sergyus an heretyke that
Introduced machomette / which monk by cause he fyl in to heresye of nestory
was expulsed fro his monasterye / and came in to arabye and abode with
machomete / how be it / it is said in another place that he was archedeken in
antyoche / and as sum say he was a Iacobyte / and preched the circumsycyon /
and said that christ was not god / but he was an holy man conceived only of
the holy god and borne of a vyrgyne / and that believe the sararyns / and the
said Sergyus taught to machomete many things of tholde and new testamente /

And when machomete was orphane of fader and mother he was under the governance
of his uncle / and by long time adoured thydolles with the people of arabye /
as he witnesses in his alcharon that god should say to him / Thou were an
orphelyn / and I have taken the / Thou abodest long in the error of ydolatrye
/ and I brought the out thereof / Thou were pour / and I have enryched the / All the people of arabye with machomete worshypped Venus for a goddess / and
thereof comes it / that the sarasyns hold the friday in great honor / like
as the Jews done the satyrday / and christian men the sunday / and when
Machomete was enryched with the rychesses of this wydowe cadygam / He mounted
in so great folly of thought / that he thought to usurp to him the royame of
arabye / and when he saw he might not do it by vyolence / and also that he
was despised of his felawes which had been alweye great with him / Then he
feigned him to be a prophet / and them that he might not draw to him by might
/ he drew to him by feigned holiness / and then he began to believe the
counceyl of that Sergyus / which was a much subtyl man / and inquired all
that he should do secretelye / and reported it to the people and called him
gabryel / and thus machomete in faynyng him self to be a prophet / held all
the seygnourye of all that peuple and all byleueden by their gremente / or
for fere / or for doubt of sword / that thing is no more true / then that
which is said of the dowue / and is more to be holden and by cause that this
Sergyus was a monk / he would that the sarasyns should use the habyte of a monk
/ that is to wete a gown without an hood and in / the gyse of monks they
should make many knelynges / and that they should adoure ordynatelye / And by
cause that the Iewys worship toward the weste / and the christian men toward the
eest / therefore he would that his people should adoure toward the southe / And so
do yet the sarazyns / and machomete publisshed to them many of the laws that
the said Sergyus taught him and took many of moses laws / for the sarasyns
wesshe them often and specially when they should pray / for then would they
wesshe al their members of the body / by cause they should pray the more cl^ne
and in their prayeng they confessyd one only god / to whom is none like and
they said that machomete is his prophet / and they fast every year an hole
month / and when they fast they ete no thing but in the night / and fast
all the day / and as soon as the day comes / as when they may dyscerne black
fro white / they begin to fast / and fast till the son be down and night /
and in that while none of them dare ete ne drink / ne have to do with his wife
/ but they that been seek be not constrained to this It is also commanded to
them that ones a year they should come unto the hows of god for to adoure / and
in vestementes without seem to goo about / and cast stones between their
thyes for to stone the devil therwyth / Which hows they say that adam made for
all his children for to pray in / and left it to habraham and Ismahel and
at last it was left to machomete and to all his people / They might ete
all manner of flesh saufe swynes flesh and blood / and flesh that had be
strangled or found deed / Each man might have four wives wedded attones and
refuse and repudye three times / and take them ageyn but not the fourth time /
and he might have no more than four wives lawfully / but he might have
concubynes and such wymmen as many as he may bye and as many as he might keep
and them he may selle but if she be with child / and it is granted to them
that they may have wives of their own lygnage / that their kynrede may be the
strenger emonge them in friend ship / and as to their possessions he that
demands must have witnesses to preue his demand / and the defendaunte shall
be byleuyd by his oath when they be found in aduoultrye they be stoned both
to gyder / and when they do fornycacion they shall have four score lasshes /
machomete said that thaungel gabryel had showed to him that it was granted to
him of our lord that he might goo to other men's wives / for to engendre men
of virtue and prophets / and one of his servants had a fair wife / and he
defended and forbadde his wife that she should not speak with his lord machomete
/ and on a day he fond her spekyng with him / and then anon he put her from
him / and machomete received her and set her emonge his other wives / and
then he doubted the murmr of the people and feigned that a writing was sent
to him fro heaven / in which was wryton if any man repudyed his wife / that he
that received her should have her to his wife / which thing the sarasyns keep
for a law unto this day /

A thief that is taken emonge them is beten the first and second time / The
third time his hand is cut of / The fourth time his foot is smyton of / hit
is forboden to hem to drink wine / and as they afferme our lord has promised
paradys to them that keep these laws and other / that is to wit a gardyn or a
place of delyces enuyronned with rennyng water / In which paradys they shall
have setys pardurable / ne they shall have neither / ouermoche hete ne cold /
and they shall use and ete al manner metes / what someuer they desire they shall
anon find ready tofore them / they shall be clad in clothes of sylke of al
colors / they shall be conjoined to right fair virgyns / and alwey they shall be
in delices / and thau^gels shall come as botyllers with vessels of gold and
silver / and shall give in them of gold milk / and in them of silver wyn / and
they shall say to them ete and drink in gladness / and machomete says they
shall have three flodes or ryuers in Paradyse that one of milk / that other of
honey and the third of right good wine with right precious espyces / And that
they shall see there right fair aungellys and so great that fro that one eye to
that other is the space of a day iourneye / unto them that believe not to god
and machomete as they afferme / is ordained the pain of hell without end /
and to them that in what someuer sin have sinned / and been bounden therein /
if in the honor of their death they believe in god and to Machomete / in the
day of dome when machomete shall come / they shall be sauyd / and the sarasyns
enuoluped in derkenesse afferme that machomete the false prophet to have had
the espyryte of prophecye above all other prophets / and they say that he
had ten aungellys obeyssaunte to him which kept him / And they say yet that
tofore god created heaven and earth / the name of machomete was tofore god / and
but if machomete should not have been / heaven ne earth ne paradys had never be
made Also they lie saying that the moon came to him / whom receyuyng in to his
bosom / he departed in to two parts and after joined them ageyn to gyder / And
they say that there was a lamb of flesh offryd to him / which spoke unto
him and said / be ware that thou ete me not / For there is venym within me /
and yet never / thelesse after certain yerys there was venym given by which he
deyed /

But now late us return to the historye of the lombardes / for then the
lombardes were much contrary to the church of Rome and to the empire how be
it they had received the feyth And then pepyn the grettest prince of the hows
of france was deed / and charles his sone succeeded him which was also named
Eutydes / and he did many bataylles and had many vyctoryes / and left two
sons princes of the ryall halle charles and Pepyn / but charles leuyng the
pomp of the world was maad a monk of cassynence / and Pepyn gouernyd much
nobly and worshypfully the hows of France / And for as much as Chylderyk the
king was not prouffytable / Pepyn came unto the Pope and axyd counceyl whether
he should be king that had but only the name of the king or he that gouernyd
the Royame / And then the Pope answerde / that he ought to have the name of
the king that gouernyd well the royaulme / And the frensshe men were enhardyed
with this answer / and made Pepyn king / and closed chylderyk in a monasterye
about the year vijC and l / And then when astulphus king of the Lombardes
had despoyled the church of Rome of her possessions and seygnorye / Stephen
the Pope which came after Zacharye required aid and help of Pepyn the king
of France ageynste the Lombardes / and came him self in to france / and
then pepyn assemblyd a much great host / and came in to ytalye / and
besyeged the king astulphus / and vaynquysshed him and took of him forty
hostages / that he should restore ageyn to the church of rome all that he had
taken aweye / and that he should no more tormente it / But when Pepyn was
departed he did no thing of that he had promised / and sone after as he went
on hontyng he deyed sodeynlye / and desydere succeeded him / about the year of
our lord v hundred and xliiij dagoberte king of france as it is contained in
a cronycle which had reigned long time tofore Pepyn began fro his chyldehode
to have saint denis in great reverence / for when he feryd the anger of his
fader lothare / he fled anon to the church of the blessed saint denis / and
after when he was maad king / he loved and honored him strongelye / and after
when he was deed / It was showed to an holy man in a vysyon that his soul was
brought to the Judgment / and many saints opposed against him that he had
robbyd her chyrches / and as the wicked spirits would have rauysshed and lad
him to pain / the blessed denis came and delyuerd him / or perauenture the soul
of him was restored to the body and did penance / the king clodoneus of
france vncouerd saint denis more dyshonestly / than he ought to do and brake
the boonys of his arm and bare hem aweye couetouslye / and anon he wexe mad
/ In that time was beda the honorable clerk in england / and how be it that
he is acounted in the cathologue of saints yet he is not called of holy
church saint bid / but worshypful bid / and this for double cause / The
first is for his old age he was blind / and he had one that led him by
towns and castellys where as he preached the word of our lord in every place /
and on a time he led him by a valeye full of great stones / and his leder
mockyng him said that there were assemblyd much people that were stylle for to
here his predycacion / And then began he to preche much ardantlye / and at
the last end he concluded with per omnia secula seculorum / and anon the
stones answerde with an hye voys amen our honorable fader / and by cause that
the stones called him honorable so the church may say well that he is
honorable / The second cause is that after his death a much devout clerk
desired to make a verse to set on his tomb / and began in this wise / Hac
sunt in fossa / and was ended with bid sancti ossa / but it was no true verse
/ and when he could not bring it to a true meter / he was full of thout all a
night / and on the morn he fond graven on his tomb by the hands of
aungellys the verse full maad in this manner / Hac sunt in fossa / bid
venerabilis ossa / whose body is worshypped by great devotion in gene / In the
time of about the year of our lord seven hundred / bachortus king of fryse
should have been baptized / and had then one foot in the fontstone / and that
other without / and demanded whether the more part of his predecessors were
in hell or in heaven / and when he herd that moo of them were in hell than in
heaven / he said it is more holy to follow the more part than the less / and
withdrewe his foot that was in the font / and so was he deceived of the devil
/ which promised unto him goods without nombre / and the fourth day after he
deyed sodeynlye / and perysshed perdurably / In the champayn of ytalye whete
barley and corn fill down fro heaven like rain / It is read that in the same
time the year of our lord seven hundred and forty / when the body of saint
benet was brought to the monasterye of floriacence / and the body of saint
scolastyca his suster was brought to ceromane / Charles the great would have
borne the body to the castle of camense / but by miracles that were showed it
was forboden / In that time was a great tremblyng of the earth / by which
cytees were turned and sonken / and other with montayns and hills were borne
and transported hole and sauf seven mile thens / The body of saint pernelle
daughter of saint Peter the appostle was transported fro thens where it was /
and was found wryton in marble by the hand of Saint Peter / this is the tomb
of the golden petronelle my daughter / and as sygeberte says they of thyre
tourmentyd them of armenye / and when the pestylence had been sometime in their
land / they of the contreye by the admonestemente of christian men shaued their
hedes in manner of a cross / and by cause that by that sign they received
their health they retained that manner of shauyng / At the last Pepyn after
many vyctoryes was deed / and charles the great his sone succeeded him in his
reygne / and in his time adryan the pope satte in his see at Rome / and sent
messagers to charles the great / and required him of help against desyderye
king of the lombardes / which tormented strongely the church like as
astulphe his fader did / and charles obeyed to the pope and assemblyd a great
host / and entryd by the montayns in to ytalye / and assyegyd puyssauntlye /
the ryal cytee of pauye / and took desyderye and his wife and his princes / and
sent hem in exyle in to france / and restablisshed to the church all the
droytes and ryghtes that had be taken from them / In that time were in the
hooste of charlemayne Amys and Amelyon which were two right noble knights of
our lord Ihesu Christ / Of whom ben read meruayllous acts / which fyl and
deyed at mortarye where as charles overcame the lombardes / and there then
faylled the regne of the lombardes / For after that time they had never king /
but such as the Emperors gafe to them / And then went charles to Rome /
and the pope assemblyd a synod of an hundred and three and fyfty bysshoppes /
In which synod the pope gafe to charles power to chese the pope and to
ordeyne the sea of rome / And also he granted to him the Inuestyture to give
to orchebysshoppes and bisshoppes tofore their consecracion / His sons were
made kings and were al enoynted at Rome / That is to wete Pepyn king of ytalye
/ and lowys king of acquytayne or guyene / and then florysshed alcuynus
master of charles and then pyppyne sone of charles began to rebelle against
his fader / whereof he was conuycte / and was shorn a monk / about the year
of our lord seven hundred four score and three in the time of heleyne emperesse
and of her sone constantyne / There was a man dyggyng in a long wall as it is
read in a certain cronycle / and he fond a cheste of stone / and fond therein
a man lyeng and letters conteynyng this following / Christ shall be borne of marye
the vyrgyne / and I believe in him under constantyn and heleyne the emperesse /
O son thou shall see me ageyn / and when adryan was deed leon was set upon
see of Rome / and was pope / and a man right honorable in all things / and the
kynnesmen of adryan had and bare heavy heart toward him / and on a time as he
read the gretter letanyes / they moeuyd the people against him / and drew out
his eyes and cut of his tongue / but god by miracle restablysshed ageyn his
tongue and his sight / and after he fled to charles / and he remysed him in
his sete / and punysshed the culpables / Then the Romans by admonestementes
of the pope the year of our lord seven hundred four sco^e and four / Charles
left the empire of constantynople / and they made him emperor and crowned him
/ and by the hand of lion the pope / and called him cezar augustus / and anon
after constantyn the great / The sea Imperyal was in constantynople / and by
cause the foresaid constantyn had given and left Rome to the vycayres of Saint
peter thappostle / and had ordained the same for their see / Nevertheless for
the dygnyte they be called emperors of Rome / and so were they till the
empire of rome came to the kings of frannce / and after that the other were
called emperors of Constantynoble / or emperor of the greeks / and the other
ben called emperors of Rome / and it was much marvel of this emperor
charles / for as ^longe as he lived / he would never marye none of his daughters
/ and said he might in no wise forbere their company / and alcuyne his master
wrote unto him upon this thing and said / how be it that thou be blessed in
other things yet in this thou art unhappy in fortune / and declared to him
what he would say upon that matere / And nevertheless the emperor did by
dyssymplacyon so as there should be no suspecyon thereof / but nevertheless it
was much spoken emonge the people / and where someuer he went / he led them
with him / In the time of this charles thoffyce of saint ambrose was much
left / and thoffyce of saint gregorye was solempnelye publysshed / and
thauctoryte of the emperor help much thereto / for as saint austyn reherceth
in his book of confession / Saint ambrose had many persecucyons of Iustyna the
emperesse / which was of the heresye arryen / and was awayted in the church
both he and his folk catholyque / and therefore establysshed he to sing the
ympnes and the psalms after the custom of them of thorryent lest the people
should abide in the sloth of error / and afterward it was ordained thorugh all the church / and then gregory come afterward and changed many things / and
added so^me there to / and sum he took aweye / The holy faders might not see
all that ^onc^^d at beginning to the beauty of thoffice but diverse faders
ordained diverse things / for there has iij begynnynges For it began sometime
at the lesson as it is done on the holy satyrday on ester even / Celestyne the
pope ordained to sing a psalm at thyntroyte of the mass / and saint gregory
ordained thyntroyte of the mass to be songen / and a verse of the psalm that
was songen / and sometime they sange psalms about the altar / and was
enuyronned of clerkys in manner of a crown / and sange by accord to gyde^ and
thereof was said chorus / a quyer or a company / Bus Flauianus and theodorus
establysshed that there should be song on one side one verse / and another on
that other side / and this held they of ygnacye which was dyuynelye taught /
Saint Iherome ordained psalms epystles and gospellys / and for the more part
the daily service and office and nyghtly sauf the song / Gelasyus and Gregory
added thereto colettis / and sange to the lessons and gospellys graylles tracte
and alleluya / ambrose Gelase and gregorye establysshed song at the mass
Hylaryus added to / gloria in excelsis deo laudamus te / and so forth as
follows / Notheryus abbot of saint galle made the sequences psalms instead
of pneuma of alleluyas / and pope nychole ordained that they should be song at
mass / Permannus of almayn maad Sancti spiritus assit nobis gracia / Aue maria
/ and alma redemptoris matter and simon baryona peter bishop of compostelle
made Salve regyna / and as sygebert says robert king of france made the
sequence of sancti spiritus assit nobis gracia / and as Turpyn reherceth
charles was fair of body / cruel of sight / viij foot long of his stature /
his face a palm and an half long / his ^erde a palm long / his forhede a
foot large / he smote with one stroke a man armed on horsbacke fro the top of
his heed unto the s^nglys or gyrthes of the horse / he drew and stretchyd out
of length lightly four horse shone of iron / he would lift up fro the earth
with his one hand an armed man right up to his heed / He would ete an hare al
hole / or two hennys or an hole ghoos / he drank by tell or no thing /

And that was wine with water / he drank so little at his dinner that he would
drink but three time / he founded many abbayes and monasteryes / And at the
last he made Ihesu christ heir of all his goods / and fynyshed his life
laudably / And lowys his sone succeeded him in the empire which was a man right
debonayre about the years of our lord viij hundred and xv / In whose time the
bysshoppes and the clerks left their gyrdellys tyssued with gold / and their
oultrageous and dysguysed clothing and array they put of and laid it a part
/ and theodulphe bishop of orlyaunce was falselye accused to the emperor /
and was sent to augyers to prison / and as it is contained in a cronycle / on
palm sunday as the processyon passed tofore the hows where he Was in prison /
he opened the wyndowe / and when he herd that they were in pees and sange not
/ he began to sing the fair verses that he had made / that is to wete /
Gloria laus and honor sit tibi rex xpe^ / and the emperor was present / and
hit plesyd so m^che to the emperor that he took him out of prison / and
restablysshed him in to his see / The messagers of mychel the emperor of
constantynople brought yeftes to lowys the sone of charles / and emonge al
other they brout the books of saint denis of the Ierarchye of aungellys
translated out of greek in to latin / and he received them with great joy /
And then were there about a twenty seek men of diverse maladyes / which al
were helyd that night in the church of saint denis / And when lowys was deed
Lothayr held thempyre / and lowys and charles his brethern made a bataylle
ageynste him / where there was so great occysion of one and other / that there
had never tofore ben such in no time in france and at last it was accorded
that charles should regne in france / and Lowys in almayne / and lothayr in
ytalye / and in the part of france which is named Lorayne / and after that
he left the empire to Lowys his sone which was emperor after him / and he
took the habyte of a monk / And it is said in a cronycle that serge was then
pope / which tofore was named / os porcy / that is to say the mowth of aswyn /
but his name was changed and was called Sergyus and fro than forthon it was
ordained that all the popes should change their names / by cause our lord
changed the name of him that he chaas to be prince of thappostles / For as
they be changed in name / so should they be changed in perfeccion of life /
and by cause that this man was chosen in to a noble office / he should not be
defouled by a dyshoneste name / In the time of this lowys in the year of our
lord viij hundred and xvj as it is said in a cronycle / in the paroche of
magonce a wicked spyrite smote on the walls of the howses as it had be with
hamers / and spoke openly in sowyng dyscordes / and tormented so the people
that in what hows he entrid anon the hows brennyd / and when the priests said
the letanyes / he cast at them stones / and greuyd them cruelly / and at
last he confessyd that when holy water was cast he hid him under the cope
of a certain priest as his famylyar / accusyng him that he had sinned with the
daughter of the procurour / In that time the king of bulgarys was converted
unto the feythe / and was of so great perfectyon that he made his oldest sone
king / and he him self took thabyte of a monk / but his sone governed him so
yongely the he took ageyn the ryte and law of the paynyms / and then his
fader reprised his knyghthode / and pursyewyd his sone / and took him and put
him in prison / and then he ordained his other sone to be king / and
reprised his habyte ageyn / It was said that in ytalye that time in the cite of
bryxe it rayned blood three days / and that same time came in to france brezes
or locustes Innumerable which had vj wings / six long feet / and two teeth
harder than any stone / and fled by companyes as armed men by the space of a
day iourneye / stratchyng a four mile / or five mile broad / and they devoured
al thing that was grene in trees and in herbys / and came / unto the sea of
brytaygne but in the end they were drowned in the sea by force of the wind /
but the hete of thoccean see threw them to the ryuage / and the air was
corumped of their rotyng / and thereof ensewed a great famyne and great
mortalyte / that almost the third part of the people perysshed and deyed / And
after this the first otto was emperor in the year of our lord ixC and xxxviij
/ and as this otto on an ester day had ordained a great feste to his princes /
tofore they were set / a sone of one of the princes in the manner of a child
took one of the messys of mete fro the board / and the keruar smote the child
with his fyste and slew him / And he that had the child in keeping saw that /
and slew him anon that had slain the child / and when the emperor would have
dampened him without audyence / he took the emperor and threw him to the ground
and would have strangled him / and with great pain he was taken from his hands
/ and after the emperor made him to be kept / and said that he him self was
culpable and to blame / and for the honor of the feste / he let the man goo
freely his way / and after this first otto / the second otto succeeded / and
when the ytalyens had often times broken the pees between them and the romans /
he came and made a great comune feste to all the barons / bysshoppes and great
lords / and when they were al set at dinner he enuyronned them al with men of
arms / and then he made his compleynte / and did do name them that were
culpable by writing / and anon did do smite of her heedes there /

And unto all the other be made good chere / and much honored them / And
Otto the third came after him the year of our Lord ix hundred four score and
ten / And he had to surname the meruaylle of the world / And as it is said in a
cronycle he had a wife / which would have been love or lemman unto an earl / And
he would not consent to her / Wherefore she had so great malice unto him that
she dyffamed him in such wise unto her husbond the Emperor / that he
commanded to smite of his heed without having any audyence / But tofore he was
byheded he prayed his good wife that she should show him Innocent and not gylty
by the preef of hot yren / and then after came a day that the emperor should
do right to wydowes and to orphans / And then this wydowe came and brought
the heed of her husbond between her arms / and demanded of what death he
ought to have that had slain a man wrongefully / And he said that he ought to
have his heed smyton of / and then she said thou art he that have slain my
husbonde / by the false entysemente of thy wife Innocentlye / and that I shall
preue that I saw truth by the beryng of this brennyng iron /

And when the emperor saw that he was al abashed / and gave him self to be
punysshed in to the hands of the woman / Nevertheless by the prayer of the
bysshoppes and of the barons / the emperor took term of ten days / and after
of viij / and after of seven / and after of vj / till the cause was examyned /
and the truth known / Then the emperor the cause examyned and the truth
known / did do brenne his wife al quycke / and gave to the wydowe four
castellys for his redempcyon / which castellys been in the bysshopryche of
lymencis / and been called the termys of the days / And after this emperor
reigned Henry which was duc of lauyer in the year a M and ij / and gave his
suster named Geysyle to the king of hungarye in marriage / and that same king
and al his people she converted to the fey^he / and the king was named stephen
/ which was of so great holiness that god ennoblisshed him by many miracles
and this henry the emperor and his wife kunygundys Were both clean virgyns / and
lived an holy life / and restyd after in pees / and him succeeded conrade a duc
of france which had wedded the nece of saint henry / In that time was seen a
beme in heaven full of fire brennyng / and was much great / and was above the
son / which was seen falling to the earth / This emperor put sum of the
bysshoppes in prison / and burnt the subarbes of melane by cause the
archebysshop of melane fled out of prison / and on Whytsonday as the emperor
was crowned in a little church / there was so great thondre and so horrible
that sum issued out of their wit and other deyed for fere / and brune the
bishop that sange the mass / and the secretarye of the emperor sayden that
they had seen saint ambrose right in the secret of the mass which menaced
and thretenyd the emperor / In the time of this conrade the year a thousand xxv
as it is said in a cronycle that therle lympolde and his Wife fled in to a
foreste dredyng the ire of the king / and there hid them in a little hows /
and as the emperor went for to hunte in the same foreste / the night came
upon him / and must need abide there in that little hows al night / and the lady
being great with child as well as she might admynystred such thing as was
necessary the best wise that she might / and that night she was delyuerd af a
sone / and a voys came to the emperor / which said to him / conrade the child
that is now borne shall he thyn heir and gendre / that is sone in law / and
when he aroos in the morning he called to him ij of his squyers / and said to
them goo ye and take awey this child fro the mother by force and hew it in
pyeces and bring them to me / and anon they went hastelye and took aweye the
child fro the moders lap / and when they saw the child of so fair a form
/ they had pity and were moeuyd with mercy / and laid him upon a tree that he
should not be devoured of wild beestys / and they took an hare and slyt him and
took out his heart and brought it to the emperor / and ye same day a duc passyd
by that forest and herd the child cry and did it to be brought to him / and
by cause he had no sone / he made it to be borne to his wife / and made it to be
nourysshed / and feigned that he had engendered it and named him henry / and
after when he was nourisshed he grew and was of right fair form and well
bespoken and gracious and curtoys to every body / and when the emperor saw him
that he was so fair and wise / he required him of his fader and maad him to
dwell in his court / and when he saw that this child was so gracious and
curtoys / that he was praised of every man / he doubted that he should reygne
after him / and it were he whom he had commanded to have be slain and wrote
letters to his wife with his owen hand / and they contained these words
following / as much as thou love thy life / as soon as thou haste received
this letter that thou slay this child / and as he went he was lodged in a
church / and he being weary restyd him upon a benche / and his purs henge down
in which his letters were / Then there was a priest there which desired
much to see what was in his purs / and opened it / and saw the letters sealyd
with the kings seal and without brekyng of the seal he opened them / and
redyng the felonnye he abhorred it / and subtylly he rased it / and where as
hit said thou shalt slay him / he wrote thou shalt give our daughter to this
child for to be his wife / and when the queen saw these letters sealyd with
the kings seal / and that they were wryton with his own hand / she called
the princes and solempnysed the matrymonye and gafe her daughter to him to be
his wife / and the marriage was done at acon / and when it was told to the
emperor that the marriage of his daughter had been solempnelye maad / he was
much abashed / and when he knew the truth of the two esquyers and of the
duc that fond the child / and of the priest that had set in the letter the
things abouesayd / he apperceyued well that the ordenaunce of god ought not to
be contraryed / and anon he sent for the child / and retained him as his
sone / and establisshed him for to be his heir / and to reygne after him / and
in the place where this child was borne / he founded a noble monasterye which
is at this day named vrsyne / This henry put out of his court all the
iougelers / and gave to pour men all that was wont to be given to
mynstrellys / In that time was so great dyscorde in the church / that there
were three chosen to be pope / and a priest named gracyen gafe to the other
much money / and they left the sea to him / and he was pope / and as henry
the emperor came to Rome for tappease the stryues / Gracion came against him /
and offryd to him a crown of gold for to be to him debonayr / and he passed
forth by and feigned all these things / and did do hold a seen / in which
he condempnyd gracyen of symonye / and set another in his place / how be it
it is said in another place in a letter that he sent to mathylde the countess
/ that the said priest was much simple / and that he had by money gotten to him
the papacye / and that after he knew his error and by the mean of the
emperor he deposed him self / and after this henry was Emperor the third
henry / and in his time bruno was chosen to be pope / and was called leo / and
as he went to Rome for to take the sea / he herd the voys of aungellys
syngyng Our lord says / I am he that knows the thoughts of pees /

This pope made the life of many saints / In that time the church was troubled
by berenger which affermed the body and blood of our lord not to be verayly in
the altar / but fyguratyfly / against whom wrote lanfranke pryour of beccense
/ and ancelme came to him out of bourgoyne for his doctrine / which was much
aournyd with virtue and wysedom / and was there pryour after him / In this time
was Iherusalem taken of the sarasyns / and after was recouerd by christian men /
and the bones of saint nycholas were brought in to baar / thereof it is said
when there should be song a new hystorye of saint nycholas in a church which
was of the holy cross and was subgette to the church of our lady of Tarentyne
/ The brethern prayed much Instauntelye their pryour that they might sing
this new hystorye / which in no wise would grant to them / and said they
ought not change their old for no new / and yet the brethern prayed him
more Instauntelye / and he in despyte said / goo your way / For in no manner
shall ye never have license of me that this new song shall be song / and when
the feste of saint nycholas come / The brethern said their matyns all in
heaviness and their vygylles / and when they were all in their beds / Saint
nycholas apperyd vysybly and much ferfully to the pryour / and drew him out
by the here / and smote him down on the pamente of the dortour / and began to
sing the hystorye / O pastor eterne and at every note he smote him with a
rod that he held in his hand right grievously on his back / and sange
melodyously this antheme unto the end / and then the pryour cried so loud /
that he awoke al his brethern and was borne to his bed / as half deed / and
when he came to him self he said / goo ye and sing the new hystorye of saint
nycholas from hens forth / In that same time the abbotte of the couente of
molesyne and xxj monks with him went for to dwell in deserte / for to keep
more straytelye the professyon of their pale / and there establysshed a new
order out of the order / Hyldebrande pryour of clugny was made pope / and was
called gregory / and when he was in the less ordres and was sent as a legate
/ he conuaynquysshed meruayllously at lions the archebysshop of ebronycence of
symonye / For this archebysshop had corrumped all his accusers so that he
might not be conuaynquysshed / And then the legate commanded him that he
should say / In nomine patris et filij / and he might not say / et spiritus
sancti / by cause he had sinned in the holy ghoost / and then he confessyd
his sin / and was deposed / and name then the holy ghoost with clear voys /
and this miracle reherceth bruno in his book that he made to mathewe the
emperor / and when this henry was deed / it was wryton on his tomb where as
he was buried with other kings / Here lies henry the sone of henry the fader
/ henry the belfader / henry the old belfader / and after this henry / reigned
henry the fyfthe in the year of our lord a thousand C and one which took the
pope with the cadynallys / and left hem in the habyte of bysshoppes and of
abhottes / and took the ring and the staff pastoralle / In that time bernarde
and his brethern ^ook the relygyon of cysteaulx / in the paroche of lyege a
sow bare a pygge having the vysage of a man / and an hen had a chykyn with
four feet and after this henry succeeded Lothayre in whose time a woman in
spain chylded a monstre which had double body and that one joined to that
other by the backs / and tofore had the semblaunce of a man hole of body and
membrys ordynatelye / and behind was the semblaunce of a woman hole in all
propertees /

After Lothayr reigned Conrade the year a thousand an hundred and xxxviij That
time deyed hughe of saint vyctor which was a right excellent doctor in all
science and devout in relygyon / of whom it is said that when he was in his
last Infyrmyte / and that he might reteyne no mete / yet he required alweye to
have the body of our lord with great devotion / and then his brethern would
please him / and brought to him a simple host vnsacred in manner of the body
of our lord and he knew it well in spyryte / and said / God forgive you
brethern / wherefore would ye deceive me / This is not my lord that ye bring to
me and anon they were abashed and ran and fette to him the body of our lord
/ and then he saw him whom he might not receive / and lift up his hands
to heaven and said now I see the sone ascend to the fader / and the spyryte to
god that maad him / And with these words he gafe up his spyryte / and the body
of our lord vanysshed aweye fro them that held him / Eugene abbotte of saint
anastase was establysshed pope / But he was put out of the cite / by cause the
senators had maad another pope / And then he come in to france / and sent
saint bernarde tofore him which preached the way of our lord / and did many
miracles / And then floured Gylbarte the patryarke / Frederyke neuewe of
conrade was emperor in the year of our lord a thousand C liij And that time
flouryd master pieter lombard bishop of paris / Which compyled the book / of
sentences / The gloss of the sawter and of the epystles of paul much
prouffytably / and in that time were seen three mones in heaven and in the mids
of the three was the sign of the cross / and it was not long after that three
sons were seen also / And then was Alysaunder chosen ryghtfully for to be
pope / and ageynste him were chosen octauyan Johannes cremensis of the title of
saint calyxte / and Johannes perscrumetencis successyfly to the papacye / and
were ennoblysshed by the favor of the emperor to the sea / and this discord
and scysme endured eyghtene year / Within wyich time the almayns which dwelled
in toscane for the emperor assaylled the Romans which were at mountpourt / and
slew fro none to euensonge so much people / that there were never so many
romans slain how be it that in the time of Hanybal there were so many slain
that three busshellys were filled with gold rings that were taken of their
fyngres / which hanyhal did do send to cartage and many of them were buried at
saint stephens / and saint laurences / and it was wryton upon their sepulture /
that they were ten time a thousand and ten thousand / and x times xvj hundred
and an half / and when the emperor frederyk vysyted the holy land and wysshe
him in a river / and there he perysshed and deyed / and as other say he waterd
his horse and his horse fyl down in the water / and so he deyed / Henry was
emperor after him in the year a thousand an hundred four score and ten / In
that time were so great raynes thondres and lyghtnynges and tempests that
never had been so great that any man might remember / For stones fyl as great
as eggs / and were square which were medlyd with the rain / and destroyed
the vygnes trees and the corn / and slew men beestys / crowys and other
birds / and sum fowls were seen fleyng by the air in that tempeste which
bare coals brennyng in their bylles and beckes and set fire on howses / and
this henry was alweye a tyraunte ageynste the church of Rome / and therefore
when he was deed Innocente the pope opposed against phylyp his sone that he
should not be emperor / and held with the party of otto sone of the duc of
Saxone / and made him to be crowned king af Almayne at acone / In that time
many barons of france went over the sea for the delyueraunce of the holy land
/ and they took Constantynoble / In that time began thordre of freres prechours
and of the menours / Innocent the third sent messagers to phelyp king of
france for to assail the land of albygeoys for to take fro hem the heresies
/ and he took them all and did do brenne them / and after this Innocente the
third crowned Otto emperor / and took of him an oath that he should keep the
right of holy church / and anon he did ageynste his oath that same day / and
did do rob and despoyle them that came to rome on pylgremage / wherefore the
pope cursyd him and deposed him fro the empire / In that time was saint
elysabeth daughter of the king of hongary which was wife to the lantgraue of
thurynge and hessyn / which emonge other Innumerable miracles / she raised xvj
deed men / and gave sight to one that was borne blind / Out of whose body oylle
flows unto this day / When otto was deposed Frederyke sone of henry was
chosen / and was crowned of honorye the pope / And this man made right noble
laws for the lybertee of the church and against heretykes / and this emperor
habounded above all other in glory and in rychesses / but he abused them
evil by pride / and was a tyraunte ageynste the church / and set two
cardynalles in prison / and such prelates as pope gregory had do be assemblyd
at the counceyl / he took them / and therefore he was acursed of the same pope /
And after gregory deyed which was oppressyd with many grievous trybulacyons /
And then was Innocente the fourth made pope / which was of the nacyon of
Iene / and he assemblyd a counceyl at lions where he deposed the emperor / and
then was thempyre void /

Thus ends the storye of the lombardes
Here follows of Saint Symeon
SAint Symeon was borne in antyoche and was much virtuous / and fro the time
that he was in his moders belly / he was chosen of god / and when he was xij
year old / he kept his faders sheep / and on a time he beheld the church /
and anon as he that was replenysshed with the holy ghoost left his sheep and
went to the church / and he accompanied him with a good ancient man and said
to him in this manner / Fair fader what thing is that / that is here read /
I pray you enseygne and teache it me for I am simple and ygnoraunte / Then
this good aunciente man began to speak of the virtues of the soul / and how
this pour present life ought to be despised / and not with stondyng that the
virtues ben accomplysshed of many truly and laudably and by the help of god in
relygyon they ben accomplisshed more lightlye / Then saint Symeon fyl to the
feet of this good old man and said to him verayly from hens forthon thou
shalt be my fader and my mother / For thou art master of good werkys / and
after this good counceyl I shall goo in to the church / where as good shall
ordeyn for me / and then he expowned to him the rule and thordre of relygyon
and told him how he must have much pain and afflictyon / and him behooves to
have much pacyence and perseueraunce / Then anon he took love of him / and
went to the church of saint Tymothe / and laid him tofore the gate / and
abode there three days and three nyghtes without mete or drink Then the abbot
came and lift him up / and demanded wherefore he was comen thither / Then
Saint Symeon answered to him and said / I desire much to be servant of our
lord / I pray the that thou receive me in to thy monasterye / and that thou
commau^ce me to serve al thy brethern / he was received of the abbotte / and
was there syx months obeyeng to the brethern humbly / When the other fastyd
fro morn to euensonge time / he after vij days took his refeccion / and the
other days he gave his prouende to pour people / On a time he came to the
pytte of the place and fond there a co^^e / which he took and bond fast
about his body fro his reins to his sholdres he strayned so sore and fast
that his flesh roted under the cord so much that the cord went to the
bones / and uneath might the cord be seen / On a day one of the brethern
apperceyued that he gafe his mete unto the pour people / he and the other told
it to the abbotte / and also they said that so great stynche issued out of his
body that none might abide by him / and that the vermyne that came out of it
had filled all his bed / The abbotte was much angrye and bad despoyle him
naked / and when he saw the cord he escryed saying / O man fro whens come
thou / me seems that thou will destroy the rule of our relygyon / when thou
will not serve god by dyscrescion as other do / I pray the depart hens and
goo where thou will / with great pain they took of the cord with which he
was bounden and helyd him / after he departed fro the place without wytyng of
any of hem / and entered in to a pytte in deserte without water / where as
wicked spyrytes dwelled / That night the abbotte had a reuelacion / that a
great multitude of men of arms had enuyronned the abbay / and said with an
high voys / give to us the man of god / or else we shall bre^ne the and all
the abbay / for thou haste driven aweye the man Just and debonayr / Thabbot
told this to his brethern / and the next night came the semblable vysyon / he
was al abashed and sent his monks for to search and fetch him / and they
fond him not / then the abbot went with them / and they came to the pytte
and there maad their prayers and descendyd therein / and brought him ageyn by
force to thabbey / The brethern of thabbay knelyd tofore him and axyd him
foryeuenesse / and after he abode an hole year and after secretelye he departed
ageyn and went unto a montayne fast by a cloystre of stones and dwelled so
three year / Then his neighbors came thither by devotion / and enhannced his
celle four cubytes of heyghte / and there he dwelled seven year after / and
after they made to him another of twelve cubytes of heyght in which he dwelled
and after they made another of twenty cubytes / and after that another of xxx
and there he abode four year / and by side him he did do make ij chapellys /
and many seek men were heled by his virtue / and he conuertyd many sarasyns to
the feythe / after this his thye roted an hole year and all that year he held
him on that other foot / but the vermyn fyl to the ground from his thye / he
had a fellow which was called anthonye / which wrote his life and held him
company / which gadred up the vermyn / and delyueryd them to him / and he
took them and laid them upon his sore saying / ete ye this that god has given
you / There was a king a sarasyn named balyssyke that herd the fame and
renome of him / and came to him in very feythe / and whiles the holy man
prayed / one of the vermyn fyl out of his thye / and the hethen king took it up
and when he looked on it hit was a precious stone / Then said to him this holy
man / O man this is not happed ne made by my merit / but it is made by thy
feythe / and then he thankyd god and departed / Seven year after his mother
came and would vysyte him but it was forboden her / for no woman might enter in
to that place / Then the holy man said to his mother abide a little and we shall
see you if it plese god / and she weeping iij days and four nyghtes received
her sone / and then it happed that she slepte / and the holy man prayed for
her / and she deyed / After this there was made to him another celle of forty
cubytes wherein he dwelled seven year after / that is to wete unto his death /
In which time there was a dragon right venomous which was in a cave nyghe to
him / which enfected so the place that nothing grew about him In whose right
eye it happed that a stake entryd / and he came all blind to the door of the
monasterye / and lay there as to axe help / he set his ryt eye by a pyler /
and Was there iij days without doing any harm to any body / Then commanded
saint Symeon that they should take earth and lay water on hit / and lay it
there upon / and when they had so done / anon issued out of his eyes a stake
of a cubyte long / and when the people saw this miracle / they glorefyed god /
But notwythstondyng they fled for dread that they had of the dragon / and the
dragon abode there stylle till all the people were goon / Then he aroos and
adoured at the yate of the monasterye almost two hours / and after went in
to his cave without doing harm to any body / another time a woman drank out
of a cruse by night wherein was a little serpente / and hit aualed down in to her
body / wherefore she went to diverse medecynes and physycyens / but it auaylled
to her no thing / many yerys after she was brought to this holy man the
which commanded to take of the earth and water and lay it on the mowthe of
the woman / and anon the serpente issued out / which was three cubytes long /
and anon clefte a sondre which was hanged up there the space of vij days /
many men seeing it / On another time many folk and bestys deyed for defaute of
water / and at his prayer sodeynlye therthe opened / and there was found a
pytte of right good water for to drink / which endures unto this day /
Another time other people abode long whiles he was in his prayer and went a
litel a back under the shadow of a tree / and they saw an heart pass by /
whom they commanded thus saying / we conjure the by the prayers of saint
symeon that thou tarry a while / and so he did / and they took him and slew
him / and as they ete of him they became lepres and mesellys / Then they
went with the skin unto saint symeon / and were there ij year / and uneath
might they be helyd and for witness thereof they henge up the skin of the
heart / There was a lyeparte there aboutes which destroyed the people of the
contre / then this holy man commanded to take of the water of that
monasterye / and to spring it on the ground al about where as he went / and
when they had so do / anon after they fond the lyeparte deed / he exorted
all them that he knew / that they should not swear by him humble synnar / and
nevertheless al they of thorryent / and the barbaryns of that contre swear by
him There was a thief named Ionatha which was chaced of many knights and he
entered in to the monasterye and enbraced a pyler and began to weep / Then
saint symeon demanded what he was / and he answered I am Ionathas the thief
that am comen hither to do my penance / and anon came thither the officers of
antyoche and said to this holy man give us this evil man / for the beestys been
ready to devour him / Then saint Symeon answered I may not / For I doubt that
he that sent him to me / which is gretter then ye be / will be wroth / and
seven days long he enbraced the pyler / and after said to the holy man if
thou will I will goo my way / Then he said to him wylt thou goo yet for to
do harm / he answered nay sir but my time is accomplysshed / And so saying he
gafe up his soul and deyed and saint Symeon enclyned down to make his prayer
like as he had be accustomed / and the people abode him three days for to have
his blessyng / Then anthonye came to him saying arise up sir and give us thy
blessyng and he went and herd him not drawyng his brethe / but as an odor of
a precious oynemente issued out of his body / Then he began to weep
strongelye kyssyng his eyes and his berde / and said alas sir why have thou
forsaken me / I never herd thy doctrine angelyke / what answer shall I give to
the seek people / that shall require thene of what coueryng shall I cover thy body
/ and there by force of heaviness he fyl a sleep / Then apperyd to him this
holy man saying / I shall not leave this hows ne this holy montaygne / In which
I have been enlumyned / but goo down and sanctefye and appease the people / and
show in antyoche that I am in rest / and cesse not thou to serve god in this
place here / and god shall render and give to the a good reward /

Then he awoke and began strongelye to weep ageyn / in saying what relyques
shall I take of the sir in remembrance of the / Then he remeuyd the body
much strongelye / and then had anthonye much more dread / and durst not
touch him / but went dou^ anon and went unto antyoche to the bishop and
told him of the death of this holy man / and anon he came with three other
bysshoppes and the master of the knights of the town and henge courteyns
about the celle and bare his body by thaulter tofore a pyler / and anon the
birds assemblyd about the celle and flewe like as they would have axyd their
mete / and cried so strongely / that men and beestes enforced them to cry and
weep at the wys of the birds / The montaygnes and the feldes showed sign of
heaviness so that the compleynte was herd seven mile / and there came there
about a cloud black and derke / and anthonye saw an aungel come from heaven
for to vysyte / which had his face clear as fire / and his vestementes white
as snow / and about ten of the clock he saw vij auncyente men that spoke to
him / but he knew not the mysterye that they said / The prelate of antyoche
would have had his berde to put in his relyques / and as soon as he put his
hand for to take it / Anon his hand was dryr / but they maad there so many
prayers for him / that he was helyd / Then bare they the body in to antyoche
/ and the bishop swear that never person should have no thing of his body /
when they were comen in to a street / that was called merce five mile fro
antyoche / the body abode there so that no man might moeue it / a man that had
been deef and dombe the space of forty year by cause he had defowled a woman
in his hows / which woman loved him not / he came and fyl down tofore the
byere sodeynlye / and began to cry and say / A man / and servant of god /
thou art well come to point for me / for thy coming has guarysshed me and
given to me health / Then he aroos and took one of the staves that bare the
byere / and anon was al hool / and served him all the days of his life / anon
issued out of the town all the people of antyoche / and received the body
much solempnelye in syngyng / psalmonysyng / and glorefyeng god / and with
great plente of lyghtes brennyng bare the body in to the great church which is
called the church of penance /

Many other miracles has our Lord showed at his sepulture / and moo were
showed after than tofore by his life / Then let us pray to this holy saint
Symeon that he pray for us unto our lord that he have mercy on us amen /

Thus ends the life of Saint Symeon
Here follows the life of Saint Polycarpe marter
SAint policarpe was dyscyple of saint Johan theuangelyst / and Saint Johan
ordained him bishop of suuere / and there were at rome then two heretykes /
that one was called marsyon / and that other valentyn / the which had deceived
much people by their falls doctrine / Then saint polycarpe went to Rome on
ester day / and there by his predycacion he brought ageyn to the feythe them
that they had deceived He wrote to the phylypenses a much fair epistle and
much prouffytable / the which is yet read in asye unto this day / Hit
happened that in the time that marcus anthonyus and lucins aurelyus reigned
which was the year of grace an hundred three score and two was made the fourth
persecucyon on christian people after the emperor New thorugh al asye / Saint
Polycarpe herd how the people cried and was moeued / he therefore was never
moeuyd but abode without dread / and he was gracious and curtoys in manners and
playsant in regard / and tarried alweye in the cite as an hardy champyon of god
/ he was so much required of the people that he departed fro the cite with
their famylyer friends / that he went to the field nyghe unto the cite / and
there he prayed all the night for the pees of all holy church / and thereof
had he a custom all the days of his life / It happed that three days before
that he was taken / as he prayed in a night / he had a vysyon that him seemed
that his here was burnt / and when he awoke he told to them that were with
him the vysyon / and expowned it to them saying / that for certain he should be
burnt for the love of god / when he saw that they approached him that would
have taken him / he went to mete with hem / and right gladly received hem /
whereof they Were much abashed that they were commanded to take so good a man
/ and anon he laid the table to his enemies / and made to them as good chere
as they had been his friends / and gafe to them largely wine and mete / and gate
of them leave to pray an hour / and all that hour he prayed much deuoutelye
for all the state of holy church / When the hour was passed he mounted upon
an ass / and was brought in to the cite / and as they led him Herodys came
which was prouoste of the contree / and his fader with him and they took him
ni to a charyotte with them / and said to him much swetelye / wherefore do ye
not sacrefyse as the other do / what harm is it to call cezar his lord / and
to do sacrefyse to the gods for to live surely / and when they saw that it
auaylled not / and that alweye he was ferme and constaunte in the law of god /
They were much wroth with him and did to him much harm in the charyotte /
and as he approached the cite great multitude of people began to murmr against
him / anon a voys descenoyd from heaven saying unto him Polycarpe be strong
and constaunte / That voys was herd of many / butnone saw it / Then anon
hit was told to the prouoste all openly / that polycarpe had three times
confessyd to be christian / when these tidings were herd / all the people of the
cite of suure paynyms and Jews began to cry in great ire / This is the
master and doctor of all the christian people that been in asye / and has
destroyed all our gods / we require that he be burnt a^le quycke / Then
the people assemblyd much wood and brought him to a stake / and when they
brought him to the stake / they would have bounden him to the stake and naylyd
the bonds with great nails / Then he said to them let me allone for he
that has ordained me to suffer this tormente of fire / shall give to me virtue
of pacyence / without moeuyng me from this place for to endure and suffer the
flamme of the fire / Then the tyrauntes left the naylles and bond him with
cords to the stake and his hands bounden behind him And as in his passion he
praised and blessed our lord and the fire was brennyng and a great flamme
shynyng / a much notable miracle was showed righ there to much people / which
god showed to the end that it should be showed unto all other / And the miracle
was this / that the flamme departed all about him in manner of a chamber / by
virtue of a sweet mind that came from heaven / and the body of the marter was
not as flesh burnt in the flamme / but as fair as it had he purefyed in a
fourneys / and they that were about him self an odor to sweet as it had been
entence or precious oynemente / When the tyrauntes saw tht the fire might not
consume the body of the glorious marter / they maad the mynystres to approach /
and did him to smite him thorugh the body with a spear / and then issued out
of his glorious body so great haboundaunce of blood that it quenchyd the fire
/ and when the people saw the miracle they departed having much meruaylle
that they did so much cruelte to the friends of god / and with this glorious
marter were twelve other marters marterd for to get the joy of heaven / the
which grant us the fader the sone and the holy ghoost amen /

Thus ends the life of saint Polycarpe marter
Here follows the passion of Saint quyryace
IN the time that Iulyan thappostata went for to fight ageynste them of perse
he came in to Iherusalem and did do seche saint quyryache the bishop which
of his friends was called Judas / but the queen Saint Helayne after he was
baptized did do call him quyryace / And when he was brought tofore Iulyan /
he promised to him many rychesses and honors so that he would do sacrefyse
unto the ydole of Iubyter / and by cause quyriace would not do it / Iulyan
commanded to strain him on a bank^ and with a (...) of iron he m^de to opene
his mowthe / and put in molten leed brennyng / For to brenne his entraylles /
quyryache suffered it much pacyently without making of any cry lokyng alweye
up toward heaven and about two hours after / when they that were there
supposed he had been deed / he lift up his voys / saying / Ihesus fader
eternal / resplendaunte light which never may be extyncte / I bless the /
for thou have made me worthy to have partycypacyon with thy friends / Therefore
I require the that the pride and elacion of this evil tyraunte may not overcome
me / but that thy puyssaunce alweye conferme me in steadfast constaunce of
feythe / and when he had accomplysshed his oryson / Iulyan said to him /
Quyryace loo how I let the Iangle / I have herd often such words / Do
sacrefyse to our Lord Iubyter / and then thou shalt do wisely / Then
Quyryace answered to him / I believe / and have byleued him that is very god
that shall destroy the and the pride / Then Iulyan did do bring a crabat of
copper / and did do lay and stratche out the body thereon / and put under it
brennyng coals / and did do straw salt on the body / and above that did do
beat him with rods / to the end that his belly and entraylles should have the
more pain and trauaylle / and after they turned his belly toward the fire / and
beat his back with rods / and then he with an high wys began to pray
in hebrewe / The tyraunte Was much admeruaylled of the great pacyence that he
had and did do shytte him in a litel hows unto the time that he had devised of
what death he might make him to deye and about two year after / saint anne the
mother of saint quyryace came to him and exorted him to suffer pacyently for the
love of god / Anon the mynystres / of the devil went and told to the
tyraunte / the which commanded that she should be brought to him / and when he
saw that she would in no wise do sacrefyse to thydolles / he commanded that
she should be hanged by the hereys / and as she henge he made to tere of all
her nails or vngles / and in this torment she was four hours without spekyng
Then Iulyen said to her / what is this that they do to thyn vngles / and
then she answered to him / O hounde out of thy wit / werkar of al I^yquyte /
if thou have any gretrer torments / give them to me / for I am al ready to
fight / against thy fader the devil / over whom I have hope to have vyctorye
moyenaunt on him the name of Ihesu christ Then the tyraunte commanded to take
great laumpes brennyng and setting to her sides / The holy woman cried unto god
and making her prayers she rendered up her spyryte unto our Lord / The christian
people that were there buried her / after this Iulyan commanded that Quyryace
should be brought tofore him / and said to him quyriace say to me of what
enchauntementes and what evil craft have thou used by which it seems that
thou felest no tormente / and therefore thou will not sacrefyse to the ydolles
/ Then Quyriace answered to him o cursyd fool / and Indygne hounde that
peruertest the might of god to enchauntementes and evil werkys / Wherefore thou
shalt be beat by wound celestyal / Then commanded Iulyan to make a great
pytte / and by enchauntours did do assemble all manner of serpents and
venomous beestys / and did do put them in to the pytte / And after he made to
cast the holy man in the mids of them / and as they threw him therein / he
began to say / right sweet Ihesus I yield to the graces and thankynges / for
not only in the / would thou verefye and apply the prophecye of dauyd / but
in us that been thy little creatures which thou have created have wylled to
have thy grace / for loo here it pleases the / that we goo upon the serpents
/ and that we march and trede on the lion and on the dragon / and as he said
so / Iulyan commanded to brenne all the beestys / Then a knight called Amon
said to the Emperor Iulyan O king out of thy wit and wood how have thou the
will to put this man to death / thyn enchauntours and thy gods which ben
deceyuable may not make the mernaylles that he does and in truth / now forth
on I am certain that the god of christian men is much mighty / For which words
Iulyan commanded to smite of his heed / and as he was led unto the place for
to be byheded / he began to say / Ihesu christ which art the god of
quyryace receive my soul in pees / and so saying he stratched forth his neck
and was byheded / and thus fynysshed his marterdom / Iulyan called quyryace and
prayed him and exhorted that he should renye the crucyfyxe / Then quyryace
answered him / O heart peruertyd / evil and without pity that see no thing
that would that I should leave my god which gives to me and to other
creatures so many goods / and that I should become myschaunte and semblable to
the / Then Iulyan was much angrye / and commanded to hang a great cawdron
of oil upon the fire / which oil was so hot that they that were there
about / uneath might endure the fume that issued / And he commanded to set
Saint quyryace therein / which entered therein in making the sign of the cross
/ and said / lord Ihesu christ which have sayntefyed the flome jordan / and
have given to me the holy sacrament of baptesme by water / See now where I
shall be yet baptized in oylle / Yet have I the third marterdom to do by the
Wesshyng of effusyon of blood which I have long tarried fore / Then the
tyraunte replenysshed of wrath and of ire more than tofore / commanded that
he should be smyton with a sharp darte in to the breast / and as he was so
smyton he prayed god that he might depart out of the world / and then gafe
up his soul unto our lord / which was the fourth nonas of may / This saint
quyryace of whom we speak was the same Judas proprely / by whom saint Helayne
fond the very holy cross / And after that he was baptized saint helayne
recommaunded him unto the bishop of Iherusalem which was at that time / when
the said bishop was deed / Helayne that then was in Iherusalem went to Rome
to the Pope Eusebyus / which ordained Judas to be bishop of Iherusalem in
chaungyng his name and called him quyryace / To whom god gafe so much grace
/ that he enchaced awey the fendes by his prayer / Saint helayne delyuerd to
him many fair yeftes for to dystrybute and depart to the pour and at the
prayer and request also of her was made a fair feste of the Inuencyon of the
holy cross / And ye ought to know that When the very cross was founden /
and by virtue thereof a deed man was reysyd / The devil which is of all good
enuyous was herd cryeng in the air / O Judas by the I am chaced out and
dymynysshed / but I know well that I shall be aduengyd against the / I shall
reyse another king that shall renye the crucyfyxe / the which by my counceyll
and by mine enhortemente shall make the to suffer so many tourmentes / that thou
thy self shall renye the crucyfyxe / Then said Judas to him / He that
proprely has power to reyse deed men / put the in the deep bottom of hell in
fire perdurable / Saint Quyryace suffered marterdom as said is for the love of
our Lord / By which he has gotten the glory perdurable / the which he
grant to us / that for us suffryd death and passion AMEN /

Thus ends the passion of Saint Quyriace
Here follows the life of saint Thomas dalquyne
SAint thomas Dalquyne of thordre of the freres prechours was a right souerayn
doctor high and of noble lygnage / which was borne in the royame of Sesylle
/ and tofore that he was borne / He was showed by dyuyne pourueaunce / For in
tho parties there was an holy man in work and in renommee which with many
other her mytes ladde a right holy life / and all the people had him in great
reverence / this holy man replenysshed of the holy ghoost / came to the lady
and mother of this holy child not yet borne / and with great joy said to her /
that she had conceived a sone / and she supposed that she had not conceived /
Then the holy man said to her / lady be thou glad for thou shalt bring
forth a child which shall be called Thomas / and shall have a great name and
renomee / thorugh all the world in science and in holy life / and he shall be of
thordre of the friar prechours / all which things like as the holy hermyte
had said were accomplysshed in the name of the savior of the world and to the
glory of his glorious saint / when the child was borne he was called Thomas
by his right name / He had the world and the vanyte thereof in despyte and for
to live in the more holy and clean life / he entered in to the order of the friar
prechours / and after he was drawn out thereof by his brethern / and was closed
up in a chamber in a toure two year / and by cause that by menaces ne fair
words his brethern might not change his good purpoos ne revoke it in no manner
/ they put in to his chamber a young damoysel to the Innocente child for to
subuerte his good courage / and anon he took a bronde of fire and droof the
damoysel out of the chamber which was come for to deceive him / and after that
he put him in humble prayers deuoutely besechyng our lord that by his benygne
grace he would alweye mayntene his chastyte / Anon as he had made his prayers
ij angels in meruayllous habyte appeayd to him saying that his prayer was
herd of god / and they dystreyned him by the raynes saying / Thomas we ben
sent to the by the commandment of god / and in his name we gyrde the with
the gyrdle of chastyte which shall never depart fro the / ne shall be broken /
the which gift was given to him of specyal grace / and was in him so fast
and ferme / that he never after felt prickyng of his flesh and so kept him
as long as he lived / as it apperyth here after in his life / when he
surmounted one of his adversaries with his mynystres / his good mother
consyderyng and having mind of that which the good man had told to her / and
showed how he should be of thordre of the freres prechours / and let him to be
led to them pesably / not wythstondyng that tofore his brethern would have
empesshed him of thentryng in to the order and of his study / For when he was
returned in to the order by consent of his good mother / he began to study
which was as sweet to him as is to the be to make the honey / and like as of
the be the honey is multeplyed right so in like wise was by this glorious
doctor the honey of holy scripture / whereof he made meruayllous books in
theologye / logyke / phylosophye naturel / and moralle upon the euangelyes in
so much that the holy church thorugh out all the world of his holy science is
replenysshed /

And as he thus prouffyted he was sent to paris / then his brethern herd
that he should depart anon came after him saying / that it apperteyned not
that a child of so great lignage as he was should be in thordre of mendycants
ne of trewantes / and al to rent his cote and cope / and would have taken him
aweye from his good purpoos / and wha^ he was restored to thordre to se^ue and
give preysyng to our lord / he set al his entente to study in thynkyng on
god when he was in contemplacion that his thout was replenysshed with great
joy / For many times were as he was in a secret place / and set al his
entente in pra^^^ he / was seen lift up many times / without aid of any
thing corporelle This then is well an holy doctor For thus as he set not
his thought in this world / he set all his heart and his thought toward
god / and was enhaunced as he that had not had no flesh ne bone ne any
weyghte We read that the blessed doctor dysputed / read / or wrote / or
argued / or did sum other virtuous thing / and after when his prayer was
paste anon he had in his mowthe that which he should dyspute or write / as if
he had tofore long estudyed in many books / all which things he showed
secretelye to his felawe named friar raynolde / To whom pryuelye he showed al
his other secrets as long as he lived / and would that none other should know
it / to the end that the vaynglorye of the world should not surpryse him / For
the science that he had was not of humayne study / but was of the
admynystracion deuyne by the prayers and service that he did to our lord / This
holy man is then as Moses was / which was given to the daughter of pharao /

For like as he was taken out of the sea and saved and rendryd unto the said
daughter / Right so the said blessed doctor / not wythstondyng that he was
borne of the great lignage of the earl of alquyn was by the pourueaunce of god
rendryd to his mother holy church / and cast out of the flode of this World /
and enhaunced and nourysshed by the pappes and mamellys of the scripture of
holy church / And like as moses made many meruayllous signs tofore the
children of Israhel / In like wise has this blessed doctor and his science
and blessed doctrine in destroyeng errors has all weye preached veryte and
truth / And his holy life witnesses as on a night this glorious doctor was
in his orysons and prayers / the blessed appostles Peter and poule apperyd to
him and endured him in holy scripture / in especyally of the prophecye of
prophets all entyerly and holy / This then is an holy doctor to whom the
chauncelyer of heaven / and the doctor of deuyne scripture have opened the gate
/ and he that was rauysshed to heaven / has showed to him the secret of a^e
the veryte / and thus this blessed doctor is taken from the world / and made
bourgeys of heaven / he being yet in the earth / On another time as he was in
the couente of his order at naples being in the church in devout prayers / he
was enhaunced up and lift up from the ground / the heyghte of two cubytes and
more / Then a friar that saw him was much abashed and admeruaylled / and
after was herd a clear voys of the image of the crucyfyxe / tofore whom the
holy man was turned and made his prayer / the which voys said unto him / O
Thomas thou have wryton of me / what reward will thou have for thy labor /
Saint thomas answered to him / lord I will none other reward but thy self / for
he him self wrote in his time and made the service and office of the precious
sacrament of the altar / and for as much as on a time a questyon was moeuyd
emonge the scolyers of paris / how the accydens might by right be without
subgette / And hereof maad they doubt / and determined all holy unto that /
which the glorious doctor should say / which thing he cl^rely showed to them
/ and for so much as said is that the demand or questyon was moouyd of our
lord / it was given to understand of the end of his life / which was nyghe /
and as he was sent fore of the pope gregory the tenthe / he went by champayne
in the royame of cezylle / he began to be seek in such wise / that he lost
entyerly his appetyte / And in passing by the abbay called Fosse neuue of the
order of the Cysteaux / He was prayed gretelye of the monks that it would
please him to come to their abbaye /

His sickness began for to encreace from day to day / And yet
notwythstondyng his maladye / he cessyd not to sow and sprede his holy
doctrine of deuyne scripture and sapyence / and then he was prayed of the
monks for texpowne to them the canticles And that time it happed that in that
monasterye was seen a sterre three days tofore his death in manner of a son /
whereof they were abashed what it might sygnefye / but certain it sygnefyed
that the holy man should depart out of this world within three days / and that
apperyd well / for when the holy man was deed the sterre was no more seen / and
it was in the year of our lord a thousand two hundred and four and fyfty / and
anon brother raynolde his felawe witnessyd in truth / part saying and
openly prechyng in this wise / I friar raynolde have herd many times / and
now the confession of this glorious doctor / and have alweye found him clean
and net as a child of five year of eage For he never consented ne had will
in mortal ne dedely sin / and it is not to be forgoten what meruayllous
tokenes were showed / when the blessed doctor should depart out of this world
/ and of the enter / of the perdurable felycyte which was granted to him /
For a friar much devout saw in the hour of his death the holy doctor
redyng in the scole / and saint Powle entryng in to him / and saint Thomas
demanded him / if he had had good and crewe understanding in his epystles /
Then saint poule answered to him ye / as good as any creature living might
have / And above that saint poule said to him I will that thou come with me /
and I shall led the to a place where thou shalt have of all things more
clear vndestondyng / and it semyd to the friar that saint powle drew saint
Thomas out of the scole by his cope / Then this friar began to cry saying
/ Help brethern / for friar Thomas is taken from us / and by the voys of this
friar the other freres awook / and demanded that friar what he had / Then he
told to them and expowned this said vysyon / and the freres made Inquysycyon
of the truth / and fond that it was so as the friar had said / for in the
same hour that the f^ere had so cried / the holy doctor departed out of this
world / and like as he had / had in deuyne sapyence and science a doctor and
techar / Right so in his passing he had a ledar unto the glory perdurable /
and long after that he was put in his sepulture / the monks doubted that the
holy corpse should have been taken aweye against their will / for the glorious
doctoure had commanded that his body should be borne to naples for as much as
he was of that place wherefore the monks translated his body from one place to
another / wherefore the pryour of the abbay was in the night grievously repreuyd
in a vysyon of saint Thomas / The pryour which doubted the Judgment and
sentence deuyne / commanded that the body of the saint should be remysed in the
place that they had taken it fro / and as soon as the sepulture was opened /
there issued so great and sweet an odor / that all the cloystre was
replenysshed therwyth / and it semyd not that any body had been buried there but
it seemed that there had been all manner of spyces / which body they fond
all hoole in all his membrys / The habyte of his order / his cope / his
scapulayre and cote were all without any evil corupcyon / and the odoure of his
precious bedy and his habyte were sweet smellyng by euydent witness seven year
after that he was translated / and the body was translated al hole / Our
blessed lord has honored his blessed saint with many meruayllous signs and
miracles / by his benefetes and merytes he has raised sum fro death / and
sum fro wicked spyrytes and fro the puyssaunce of the fend / And many from
diverse maladyes have been brought to health by the grace of god and the
merytes of this glorious saint / We read also that there was a friar much
devout called brother alberte / which on a day was much deuoutelye in prayers
tofore thaulter of the virgyn marye / and ij reverend persons merueyllously
shynyng apperyd to him / that one of tho tweyn was in thabyte of a bishop /
and the other in^thabite of friar prechours which had a crown on his heed round
byset with precious stones / and about his neck two colyers one of silver
the other of gold / And on his breast he had a great stone which of his
bryghtenesse cast out many rays of clerenesse / and ^nlumyned all the
church / his cope that he had on was full of precious stones / His cote and
scapulayr were all shynynge of whytenesse / When the friar saw this sight he
meruaylled much / Then he that was in the habyte of a bishop said to him I
am austyn that am sent to the / to the end that I show the glory of brother
Thomas of alquyne / which is in heaven in glory like unto me / But he
proceeds me in the order of vyrgynyte / and I him in dygnytee pontyfycal /
Many other signs and miracles has our lord / shweyd unto the honor and
glory of his glorious saint / Saint Thomas / Whose merytes be unto us aydaunte
and helpyng AMEN /

Thus ends the life of Saint Thomas Dalquyne
And here follows the life of Saint Gayus
THat time when dyoclesyan and maxymy en reigned emperors Gayus that was pope
of Rome called and made to assemble all the christian people to gyder and said
to them / our Lord has ordained two degrees or states to them that believe on
him / that is to wit confessors and marters / And therefore if sum of you be
fereful and in doubt that they shall not mow suffer marterdom / let them
ever have true and very confession and steadfast in the feythe / and goo must
they with cromacyen and Tyburcyen for to save them self / And they that are
wyllyng for to abide with me within this cyt^e / in the name of god let them
abide / For the seperacyon of the persons in far contrees / may not separe
that the deuyne charity has assemblyd / Then escryed to him Tyburcyen /
saying holy fader I beseech the that thou leave me not to turn my bac^eferyng
the persecutours / For to me it shall be great joy and comfort to suffer
bodylye death for to get and enjoy life eternal / When Saint Gayus saw the
feythe of Tyburcyen and his constaunte courage / he began to weep for joy /

There abode ^ey^h him Marcellyen / Mark their fader Transquylyn / Sebastyen /
Tyburcyen / and Saint Nychostrate / with him his brother Castore and his wife
Zoe / also claudyn and vyctoryn his brother / with them his sone Symphoryen /
the bishop ordained unto deakens Saint mark and marcellyen / and maad priest
transquylyn / he did ordeygne saint sebastyen deffensour of the church and the
other he ordained and maad subdeakens / night and day they were contynuelly in
great devotion / fasting weeping / and saying their prayers and orysons / and
deuoutelye prayed our lord that of his benygne grace he would make them able and
worthy to be accompanied with the marters by very pacyence / and there by
their prayers many one were helyd of their sickness / many of blind person
was restoryd of sight / and many enemies or deuylles were put out fro many a
creature / so as tiburcien yede thorugh the town / he saw a man that was
fallen from hye unto low / in so much that he was al to bursten and broken of
al his membris / and men would have made his grave for to burye him / Soon
tyburcien approached and began to say pater noster over him fair and soft / and
Incontynente after he was hole / and rendered him in to good health to his
parents / and sone after he had him a side fro the people and conuertysed and
baptized him / So as zoe was deuoutelye in oryson and at her prayers she was
taken and led by the paynyms unto a statue of marterdom for to have
constra^ned her to sacrefye thydolles / She then answered / ye will constrayn a
woman for to sacrefye unto the statue of mars for to show that your mars
delyteth and takes his plesau^ce in wymmen / and how be it that he may do his
will of the shameful venus / Neuerthelatter he shall not have the vyctorye of
me / For I b^re the vyctorye of me at my forhede / Then she was taken and
led in to a prison right derke and much obscure and there she was five days
without syghte of any light / without drink and without mete and without the
sight and heeryng of any body / but only of him that had closed or shytte her
therein / who often said to her / by famyne or by fawte and lack of mete thou
shalt deye here in tenebres or derkenesse if thou sacrefye not unto our mighty
gods / The syxte day she was had out of prison / and hangyd she was by her
heerys to an high tree and under her they made a smoke of donge and of ordure
or fylthe which rendered an horrible stenche / and by this tormente of materdom
she expyred and rendryd her soul unto our lord / confessyng ever his right
holy name / After the tirau^tes took the holy corpse and at the neck of hit
they henge a great stone / and cast hit within the river of tybre / to the end
that the cristens should not take it to make of hit a goddess / and after that
she thus had received her marterdom / she apparysshed before saint sebastyen
and recounted to him how she had suffryd marterdom for the love of our Lord /
The which thing as saint sebastyen reherced hit to his felawes / transquylyn
escryed and said / the wymmen proceden us to the crown of glory / Why live we
so long / On the seventh day after this transquylyn allone bye and publyke
began to denounce the name of god / and anon he was taken and cast with
stones / and when he had rendryd his soul to god he was cast in to the watre
of tybre / And as nycostrate and claudyn with them castorye / vyctoryn and
symphoryen were about to have out of the river of tybre the bodies of the
marters / they were taken and led unto the prefecte or Judge Fabyen which
Inuyted them to sacrefye unto thydolles by the space of ten days / One time by
manaces / that other time by fair words wenyng to have brought them to this
ydolatrye / but ever they were steadfast and constaunte in the feyth which
Fabyen when he saw them so constaunte / he yede and told it to the emperor
/ and the emperor commanded that they should be forthwyth tourmented by diverse
torments / But when he saw their steadfast believe he commanded that without
delay they should be cast in to the mids of the sea / anon fabyen for to
accomplysshe the commandment of the emperor made to be hanged at the neck
of each one of them a great stone / and thrown they were unto the bottom of
the sea / There were consommed or ended their marterdoms florysshyng as lylyes
before god / In sempiterna secula where we al may have part amen /

Thus ends the life of Saint Gayus
Here follows the life of saint Arnolde
Saint Arnolde was fader of Pepyn / and grant fader of charles the great as a
doctoure recounteth named pyeter Damyen and held a duchye in lorayne / which
did put fro him all worldly affeccions / as rychesses wife and children / and
haunted the deserts for to lead best solytarye life /

On a day so as he passed over the river of meuse / and that he was about the
mids of the bridge where the water was more depper than in any other place /
he took a ring that he had and cast hit within the water / Saying when
someuer I shall receyu^ and have ageyn this ring / then shall I believe that I
shall be assoyled of al my sins / and after from thens he departed and went
in to a deserte / Where he was long time as deed to the world and living with
god / In that time deyed the bishop of mets and happed that saint arnolde was
chosen for to be bishop there / So then on a time as he absteyned him fro
etyng of any flesh / as he euyr did while that he was in the deserte or wode
/ was presented unto him a fysshe / and as his cook dressyd and slytted it / he
found within his belly the said ring / and yede and showed it to the holy
bishop / whereof he was right ioyeful and glad / and ye ought to wit that fro
the place where the holy man had cast the said ring in to the water / unto
the place where the said fysshe was presented to him was four and twenty mile
by water / And when the holy man aduysed him / and that well he knew for
certain the said ring / he thanked god of hit that he gave to him knowledge of
the remyssyon of his sins / From thens forthou ever fro better unto better
deuoutelye and by holy perseueraunce he entendyd to serve our Lord and yet as
now is the said ring within the paleys of mets / men may be meruaylled and
meruayllyng to magnefye and preyse god / How in this present life they may not
live without perils / but he is borne in a good hour that acquyreth graces
of god / and that makes Justice on his own flesh as long as he is living
in hit / I say this by cause of this holy man that was at so good an hour borne
/ that so much of graces he gate and acquyred toward our lord / That he was
certefyed and ensured of the remyssyon and pardon of al his sins as tofore ye
herd say / Soon when he was possessyng his bysshoyryche / he did dystrybue
and departed to the pour so much and so largely of his own goods / that
the pour folk came thither fro far countrees and cytees for to be counceyled
and helped by alms / He was also besely tendyng to all good werkys / and in
specyal to receive relygyous folks / monks and pour pylgrymmes / He him
self wesshed their feet / he clothed them of new / and to them gave silver
enough to pass on their weye / as soon as other of new came / he was as ready
for to help them / as he tofore was / for the honor and reverence of god / In
watchyng / in fasting / in devout prayers and in orysons / he employed ever
the time / none might not duly reherce ne tell the great abstynences that he
made / For when he had fasted the space of three days he was content to have a
little breed maad of barleye and a little water / and ever most secretelye that
he could he ware under his clothes the hair / in so much / that by force of
abstynence he right gretelye had maad lene his flesh / On a time during the
three days which he fasted he did do make a processyon / whereat many creatures
were / which much deuoutelye prayed / and so as the processyon was in doing
/ there was a woman tourmented and sore vexyd by the devil that began to cry
loud and hye / when the holy man saw this woman he made the sign of the
cross ever her / and sone after she was delyuerd fro the enemy that so
tourmented her / In the time of dagoberte king of france / so as he was
within his palace / a leper came there that began to cry after the holy man
/ and demanded mete and clothyng / Sone commanded the holy man that he should
be led home / and so as he mynystred and tool^ to him that was nedeful and
necessary to him / he did demand of him if he were baptized / for he was of
barbarye Then answered the leper to the holy man allas sir nay / For I that am
a pour creature have not found none that has given to me the precious gift
of baptesme / and anon the holy man baptized him / and Incontynente after that
his sickness left him and departed fro his body / and so he that before had
be a sinner and sore seek by the merit of the holy man / was left and made
hole both of body and of foul / On another time a man named noddo which was
drunk and full of wine began to mocque and dyspreysed the holy man saying
that he was not the man of god / but that he was full lusty and ready to al
delyces wherefore it happed that so as he and his sone went to bed /
sodaynlye by the will of god their clothing were all about on a fire and
began to brenne Then they cried and called for water / but the water did
naught to hit so that the fire took on their shertes toward the genytoryes /
and from them they might not have of their clothes and When they saw that no
remedy they might put to it they yede out of their chamber and began to lay
them self as swynes down in to the ordure or fylthe and in to foul and
stynkyng waters / but all this auayled them naught / For fro more in to more
their genytoryes did brenne / And so as I believe at that same hour was
verefyed that / that our lord said by the mowthe of dauyd the prophet / saying
/ Detrahentem secreto proximo su^ / huuc persequebar / That is to say in
english / thoo that secretelye blamen and despreysen their neighbors them I
shall persecute / that same noddo deyed in this estate and knowleched his sin
/ and so did his sone by the said sentence / So as the holy man was perseueryng
in virtues for to keep and eschew the vaynglorye of this World / he departed
fro the cite and went unto a place not far fro hit / where he did do make a
litel hows and made him self to be closed and shytte therein / and there he was
contynuelly in prayers and orysons lyftyng his hands toward heaven / It happed
by adventure that the fire took the hows of the king / and so much it grew
that the howses there about began to brenne fast / Sodaynlye the people were
moeuyd when they saw that all the cite was esprysed on a fire and flamme / and
they yede forth with to the celle of the said holy man where he was deuoutelye
in his orisons and prayers thus as he was acustomed to be / Anon one that was
called Romancyus took him by the hand and said / rise thou fro hens man of god
to the end that this fire consume ne dommage the not with the cytee / Then
the holy man answered I will not depart / but led me nygh the fire and if god
will that I shall be burnt I am in his hands here as I am / Then they of the
cite came with him hand in hand unto the fire / and after commanded that each
one of them should fall in prayers / and when the holy man had made his
prayers they rose up all / and then he lift up his hands and made the
sign of the cross / and then anon the fire ouenchyd and made after no
manner of dommage / and after that hour one of his brethern saw in a vysyon
toward heaven the sign of the very cross in a manner as flamme / and at
the other side he herd a voys that said / see thou this cross / by that has
the bishop arnolde delyuerd the cytee fro fire this night / After this Saint
arnolde relynquysshed and left the world al entyerly and went in to a deserte
emonge the wild beestys where he maad a little hows with sum monks that were
dwelling there / where he held him ever in holy medytacion and deuyne
praysynges / and when any pour people came there / he frendely received and
served them their hoosen he did pulle of / their feet he wesshed / and made
clean their shone / and also much benygnelye he maad their beds / and made
their mete ready and so he was both cook and bishop to gyder / hongre and
thyrste suffryd he many times / so that he might of his own mete feed his
felawes / he set a part all precious raymentes and much dear he held the
hair that was roughe and hard /

In these two good deeds doing the good man rendered his soul to god / and
after his obsequye done / the bishop his successor that had to name g^erycus
assemblyd to gyder a great company of people / two bysshoppes and many clerkys
also / and all together they went in to the deserte / and when they came unto
the place there as the corpse was / saying vygyles much solempnelye / and after
they took the corpse and bare it aweye with great honor and reverence unto the
cytee / And as they came to a ruysel or chanel and would have passyd it / hit
happed that they which bare the corpse behind fyl down / but as I suppose the
angels sustained the corpse in the air for they that bare hit before yede ever
and le^ted not / and they that were fallen had no harm / but stood up anon
and bare the corpse ageyn as they did before / In the time that this holy man
was on live / there was a man that lived much lecherously / the holy man
repreuyd him / many times thereof / and prayed him that he would leave that life /
and do penytence or that he should deye in that state / It happed so that as
the holy corpse was borne to the cite / and as they passyd thorugh the said
man's ground / the same holy corpse at thentre of the said man's ground /
stood stylle / in so much that they that bare it could not moeue it from thens
/ Wherefore the bysshoppes / the preestys / the clerks and all the people that
were there / were much meruaylled and sore troubled / also by cause that the
night was nyghe and they wist not where they might be lodgyd / Then a duc
that was in the company named nod do / said thus to them / ye see how he
refuses to enter Wythm the ground of this synnar / my town is here nigh I
counceyl that we return thither / for to abide and rest us there all night
For also we ne have here what to feed this people wythal / for of al prouysyons
or store / I ne have but a little byer within a little vessel / and a little bread
if it pleased to god and to the holy corpse that we might be there or the night
come / and how be it that far aweye it was thens / Nevertheless by the will
of god they were there right soon / and them semyd that the holy corpse bare
him self / and namely that they were borne thither / where they came by day
light / And then said noddo to them I pray to saint arnolde that by his
grace he will feed us all this night / For well I wot that at his prayer we
shall have all that to us needs / and soon with that little drink and bread
that they had by the grace of god and of the saint they were all fed and
rassassyed that night / and yet much remained of hit both of drink and of
bread / ^ On the morn next with great joy they walked and bare the holy
corpse in to the cite / They of the cite also came to mete the corpse in
processyon with great reverence / as he that had been their pastor or gyde of
their sowles / which of long time they had not seen / and much reuerentelys
they buried the holy corpse in the church of the appostles / A woman that Iule
had to name which of long time had lost her sight / came to the sepulture of
saint arnolde / and ferue^lye her prayer there made by him recouerd her sight /

Another woman on a sunday wrought god punysshed her / for her ij hands were
styffe and contrefayte / she came in to the church Where the holy corpse lay /
besought the saint with feythful heart sore weeping and anon recouerd health /
The solempnyte of this glorious saint is celebred the xvij day of the kalendys
of auguste in the honor of god that lives / and without end regneth In
seculorum secula amen

Thus ends the life of Saint Arnolde
Here follows the life of saint Turyen
SAint Turyen was archebysshop of dol in little bretaygne / and was borne in a
town nygh to the said cite / where was a church of / His fader and his mother
were issued of noble lygnage In that time a man of holy life / confessor and
friend of god was archebysshop of the said cite and was named Sampson / So
then as the vessel of holiness / that is to wete turyen / that yet was but a
child of age / but he was by virtue of the holy ghoost filled with grace /
relenquysshed and left for love of our lord all his parents which were of
great estate and the fair lyuelode also that he should have / and came in to
the cite of dol toward saint sampson / When Saint sampson saw him / he
ordained and set him to keep his kyen and his other beestys? / This
prefygured be to him gladly / sygnefyeng that he should be in time to come
pastor or gyde of the sheep of our lord when he should receive the dygnyte of
archebysshop / And in this estate keeping the beestys esprysed of the love of
god and not of no thing humayn / he did call every clerk that passed before
him / and prayed him that he would write sum letters within a little pair of
tables that he had for to learn and know them / when he began to know well
enough his letters it plesed our lord that he should learn and know tharte of
gramayr / and so much of grace gafe god to him that he had a melodyous and
fair voys at church more then any of his other felawes / and so as by many
a time his voys pleased much to the archebysshop / he retained and took him
stylle with him / and of him he made as of his own adopted sone / and much
endeuoyred him to make him to learn the deuyne scripture / and swetely governed
him / So much grew and fructefyed the child in resplendour or light of all
good veertues / by good doctrynes and exaumples / that the said archebysshop
ordained him master of the clerks of his chapel / The well of this child
turyen multeplyed ever fro better to b^tter in the love and grace of our lord /
The archebysshop saint sampson that as then was old / considering the holy
life that turyen led / the good virtues of which he was filled / and that he
was in age parfyte / ordained him arch^bysshop in his place / and namely he yet
living would see him to be possessour of the dygnyte of the archebysshop / and
so when by the consecracion dyuyne he was chosen to the said dygnyte / all the
people made joy thereof / For well they perceived that he was full of the grace of
god / On a time as he lift up his eyes toward heaven he saw a wyndowe wide
open and the angels in paradyse that bare the arche of the testamente of god
and then he said to all the people I see heaven opene / and the aungelles
beryng the arche of god / and yet I see our lord Ihesu christ syttyng on his
trybunal / and when the people had herd him / they al together both more and
less / began of one voys of one heart and / of one mowthe to preyse / to
glorefye / and to magnefye the name of our lord / and fro that time forth on /
they honored more the holy man then they had done before / The holy man
then commanded that a cross should be made of Wode / dressed and set in
the same place where he saw the foresaid vysyon / On another time as he preached
nyghe to a church / called carnyfr^t / before a cross made of stone / where
as much people was assemblyd to here his predycacion / the which cross had be
sometime made in the honor and reverence of our lord Ihesu christ / and of the
glorious archaungel Saint Myc^^l on which cross sometime he descendyd fro the
sholdres of the said archebysshop / It happed that a young maid deed Was
brought thither for to be buried / the which by his prayer at the request of
the people was raised to life / Of thystorye of this glorious saint I ne may
find more of it but we al shall pray to him that toward our lord he will be our
good Intercessour and friend AMEN

Thus ends the life of Saint Turyen
And here follows the life of Saint Fyacre
SAint F^acre ^the glorious hermyte made many virtuous deeds in the terrytorye
or countreye of meaulx in the proteccion of saint pharon that time bishop of
the cite of meaulx / many miracles nedeful and necessary as then / He made
in this world as the legende of the lessons of his faytes shown clearly enough
/ and to the end that this present narracion that makes of hit mencyon be
not to much prolonged / and that the life of saint Fyacre and of saint pharon
assemblyd to gyder may appear to them that shall read hit / It is good as to me
seems / that at this beginning I make mention of the excellence of saint
fyacre / how for the love of our lord he left his contree both fader and
mother and all his goods / and came in to the parties of france / On that
time that the glorious saint pharon left and relynquysshed the worldly
knyghthode / and that he was ordained and made bishop of meaulx / the same
monk named fyacre / of the nacyon of scotts being in his contreye and meued
by devotion to serve our lord more streytelye / departed with such felawshyp
as fortune gafe to him and came unto meaulx in france / where he prayed the
holy bishop there / that he might dwell under his proteccion / when Pharon
had herd his demand right gladly he accorded to it / and as a pyteous
pastor granted that Fyacre should dwell with him / after his own pleasure /
as long as he would / when the hermyte fyacre had Impetred his petycyon or
demand / he yede and cast his sight low toward the earth and only with all
his heart and thoute and without spekyng made his prayer to god / that of his
grace he wo^^ have pity on him / and so feruentelye he besought and prayed that
his face rendryd great droppys of water / and was over read and sore chauffed /
And when the blessed saint pharon saw him in such estate he began to be
meruaylled and wend that he was agreuyd of sum thing / and anon he called
to him one of his servants and said to him goo to yonder man and make him
come secretelye to speak with me / The messager did as to him was commanded /
and led saint fyacre unto the bishop / when he was before his presence / the
holy man pharon full of virtuous thoughts to the end that better he might
declare his entencion / said to fyacre in this manner / My brother I require
the / that thou will put fro the this sorrow and heaviness which is in thyn
heart / to the end that thou may better receive my words / Then said saint
fyacre to him / Fair fader reverend / if thou will have pity and compassyon
on me / thou shalt mow make me to cesse this heaviness at thy commandment
/ But to the end that thou may the better understand mine answer / proceed
forth on thy demand / Then the right reverend bishop pharon beholding on
phyacre said to him / First my right dear brother I require of ye to tell me
in what land thou were borne / and the cause why thou departedest fro the
contreye / also where thou art bound for to g^o and what thy name is /
Ferthermore if thou have need of counceyl / of words / or of other thing that
I may do I call god to my record that right gladly I shall endeuoyre me to
su^^yl it / Saint fyacre then knelynge rendered to him thanks and mercyes and
after said to him / my fader and my mother engendered or begat me in an isle of
scotland named Hyrlande / and for as much that I desire to lead my life
solytaryly / I have relynqued and left my land and my parents / and I do
seek a place for to lead my life hermytyke and solytarylye / and by my right
name I am called fyacre / and therefore mekelye I beseech thyn high and
Ineffable paternyte that if there be in sum part of thy bysshopryche / a
little place within a wode where I might vsen and employe my life in prayers and
in orysons / that thou wylt not differ to me the grant of it / When saint
pharon herd this he was thereof ioyeful and glad / and said to saint fyacre / I
have a Wode far enough fro hens / which is with in our own heritage / and
is called by the folk of the contreye brodyle the which wode as I suppose is
couenable for to lead life solytarye / and if it be so that thy desire is to see
it / let us two goo thither to gyder for to behold and see the place / Then
answerde saint fyacre / So as thy paternyte commands / I desire that it be
done anon / Then the pyteous and holy bishop as soon as he might led
fyacre unto the right desired place / and when they were come thither / Saint
pharon said to saint fyacre / My brother this place is belongyng to me by mine
own heritage coming fro mine auncestrye / and if it seem to the good and
plesaunte for to dwell and abide in / as much of hit behooves to the /
deuoutelye and With good heart I present it to the / and full gladly I give it
to the for to do Wythal thy good pleasure / and when thus he had granted and
said / fyacre fyl to his feet and for great joy / weeping rendered to him graces
and thankynges / saying O right blessed fader the same place only of sight
pleseth me and delyteth right gretelye / for it is an holy place and far fro
abydyng of any folk after these words they took their refeccion or food of
nourriture dyuyne / and sone after returned to gyder unto the cite of meaulx /
and on the morn next saint fyacre took his leave of saint pharon which gafe
to him his blessyng / and when saint fyacre had received it / he departed and
went to the place beforesayd / where he founded a church in thonour and
reverence of our blessed lady / and beyond it a little weye thens he bylded a
little hows wherein he dwelled / and there herberowed he the pour that passed
fore by / when then he had done and accomplysshed all that to him seemed
necessary for the time / this very friend of god fyacre contynuelly without
cesse labored and watched in to the service of our lord Ihesu christ / and
ever in good virtues fro better to better multeplyed and much vyctoryously
ageynste his aduersarye thenemye resysted / and ageynste his flesh / and that
that he had right hertelye to the pour gafe and dystrybued / if sum were
that time that had lost their strength / or that were dombe / deef /
countrefeyted / blynd^ or vexyd with the enemy / or of what someuer sickness
that it had be / they al came or made them to be borne unto this holy man / and
anon after that he had laid his hand on them / by the grace of our lord and
by his prayers / they returned homewarde as hole as ever they were / and in
such wise flouryd thodour of the renomee of the miracles that our lord showed
by him thorugh all the bysshopryche of meoulx that they began al to have g^ete
hope in his suffrages and prayers / Emonge al other things it happed that an
holy man named chyllenus borne in scotlonde / that was come fro rome as a
pilgrim / and was arrived within the terrytorye or countreye of meaulx / when
he herd speak of the good renomee of the holy man fyacre he anon went toward
him / and saint fyacre much benygnelye received him and when he understood
that they were both of one land / and by affynyte of blood nyghe parents /
Instauntelye prayed him that he would abide with him certain days / which
chyllenus accorded to it / and as they were together / and that they had
reherced the extraccion of their parents / and spoke of the sweet sentences of
the holy scryptures / wherwyth they nourisshed and fed them self by the
great joy that they took when they spoke of hit They recommaunded each other
to our lord and took leave to depart one fro other / And for certain the
renomee of him grew so much and flewe so far / that from far countries
much people came daily to him for to recover their health in so much that the
holy man saw that of needs he must make his habytacyon or howsyng more spacious
and gretter than hit was and thout to him good and necessary to make a great
gardyn wherein he should have all manner of herbs good for to make potage with
for to feed the pour when they should return toward him / and so he did / and
how be it that saint Pharon before that time gafe to him leave to take as much
of his wode as to him neded / nevertheless he durst not take on him the
hardynesse for to make his hows gretter ne more than it was tofore till he had
spoke ageyn with saint pharon for to demand leave of him to throw down the
trees and other things growyng about his hows / to whom the venerable and
curtoys bishop / gafe of his wode as much as he might pyke and delue and
throw down with his own hands to do with all as of his own lyuelode / saint
fyacre then enclyned his heed and rendered thanks to saint pharon and took
his leave of him and returned in to his hermytage / and when he had made his
prayer he drew his staff over therthe / now may ye understand thing much
meruayllous and of great miracle / for by the will of our lord / where someuer
the holy hermyte fyacre drew his staff the trees fyl down both on one side
and on other / and round about where he drew his staff was a dyche sodaynlye
made / and in the mean While that he drew so his staff there came a Woman
which meruaylled much how therthe claue and dyched by hit self only by the
couchyng of the holy man's staff / and with great haste she ran toward
meaux and denou^ced this thing to the bishop pharon / testefyeng and ensuryng
that the holy man fiacre was full of wicked and evil art / and not seruau^te of
the souerayn god / and when she thus had said returned forthwyth toward the
holy man / and with an evil presumpcion yede and said many Iniuryes and
vylonyes to fyacre contumeleyng and blasphemyng him / and commanded him by the
bishop that he should cesse of his work and that he were not so hardy to be
any more about it / and that for the same cause the bishop should come there
when the holy man saw that he was thus accused to the bishop by a woman he
cessyd his work that he had begone and made no more if it / and satte on a stone
much thoughtful and wroth / wherefore if our lord had before showed great
miracles by him / yet gretter and more meruayllous miracle was made for him /
for the stone whereon he sat / by the will of god wexyd and became soft as a
pylowe to the end that hit should be more able and easy for him to sit on / and
it was caued somewhat as a pyt there as he sat on / and for testyfycacion and
preef of this miracle / ye said stone is as yet kept within his church / and
many seek folk have been and are daily helyd there of diverse sekenesses only
to touch and to have touched the said stone / The bishop then by the
prouocacion of the said woman's words towar^ the holy man fyacre / and when he
saw^ the meruaylles that god showed by him / as well of the trees that by them
self were thrown down to the earth of either part / also how therthe only
by frayeng of his staff / was dyched about / as of the stone that was thus
caued and made soft like a pylowe he knew well that he was a man of great
merit toward our lord / and fro than forthon he loved the hermyte saint fyacre
more then before and honored him much / the dyches before said ben yet as
now showed to them that goo to vysyte his church / When then fyacre as is
above said satte on the stone full sorry and wroth that the woman had so accused
and blasphemyd him to the bishop / also for thyniuryes and vylonyes that she
had said to him / he made his prayer to our lord / that no woman should never
enter in to his church / without she be punysshed by sum manner of
sickness / Whereof it happed on a time / that a woman of much noble and rich
estate / desired to know what thereof should befalle if a woman had entryd in to
his church /

The which women took her maiden or servant and shoued her suddenly with in
the chapel / And anon seeing all they that were there / the said woman lost
one of her eyes / and the maid Innocente as to the deed / came out ageyn with
her plain health On another time / another woman of Latynynak put one of her
feet within the said chapel or church / but her foot swellyd by such manner
that all the leg / knee / and thye of hit was greuyd with sickness / and
many other miracles has been thereof showed / wherefore the wymmen shall ne ought
not enter in to it / The good and holy saint fyacre in his life time
resplendysshed by miracles and virtues / and after rendryd right gloryously his
soul unto our lord / and sithe after his temporal death at his own grave by
his merytes and prayers / our lord showed and as yet now shows many myraches
/ as to restore in good health the pour seek folk languysshyng of their
membris of what someuer sickness or langoure that it be / who with good and
contryted heart comes to the church where the said grave or tomb is / and
deuoutelye besecheth and prays god and the good and holy saint fyacre / the
which by his glorious merits may be unto us good friend toward our said Lord
and god amen /

Here follows the life of saint Iustyn
SAint Iustyn was born in the cite of naples and his fader was called
cryspobachye and was a right great phylosophre which labored strongelye for
the christian relygyon / in so much that he composed many fair books much
prouffytable / as recounteth saint Jerome and hugo / He betoke to the emperor
anthonyn a book which he composed of the christian relygyon / and so much he
labored toward the said emperor that he had pity and compassyyn of the
christian people / and not only the emperor him self / but also al his children
/ and all the senators of rome / and the said emperor made sithe a
commandment that no paynym should not be so hardy to have in despyte the
sign of the very cross / Item pompee the troyen which was of the spaynysshe
nacyon composed in to xliiij books / al thystoryes that were thorugh all the
world from the time and regne of mynym / that Was king of assyrye / unto the
time and regne of the emperor caesar / and Wrote them in latin / the which
hystorye saint Iustyn abreuyed or shorted / and also composed many other books
/ which were to long to reherce / to him was deuynely reveled or told / that
much he should suffer before his death for to mayntene truth / as it apperith
by a writ or letter which he sent to the emperor anthonyn / where he says
thus / I shall have enough of persecucyons of staves of iron by them / ageynste
whom I bataylle or fight for to mayntene the estate of truth / but when that
shall be I then shall have knowledge that they be not phylosophres / that is to
Wete / loving art and science / but that they be lovers of all vanytees / for
he is not worthy to be called a phylosophre / which publyklye affermeth and
testefyeth that / which he knows not / and that says that the christian are
without a god / and putten in gretter error / tho that al ready are in error /
all the which thing was thus accomplisshed / so as saint Iherome recounteth
and euschyus also / for when the said emperor was passed to god from this
world / after him reigned ij other emperors / the which were named anthonyn and
aurelyen that were great persecutours of christian people / and so as Iustyn
perseuerd in holy living and in holy doctrine he composed the second book for
to deffende with the religyon christian It happed so that many other phylosophres
were that great envy had at iustyn as much for his holy life and honest
condycions whereof he was filled / as for his great science / accused him to the
emperor saying he was christian and yt he would destroy their law / then was
Iustyn taken / and made him to suffer many tourmentes and diverse pains / in
which by cause that he constauntelye reclamed ever the name of god / they
spryncled and shadde his blood by such manner that he rendered and yaue his
soul to our lord Ihesu crist with whom he restyth in pees and shall rest
without end In seculorum secula amen /

Here folowtth the life of saint demetryen
WHile that the emperor maxymyen had the lordshyp of thessalony cense / he made
all the audytours of the christian feyth to be put to death / emonge which was
demetryen that made him self to be manyfestyd and known of al without any fere
or dread for since the time of his yongthe he had ever ben steadfast and
constaunte in good operacions or werkys / and ever endoctryned and taught
the other / how the deuyne sapyence was descended in therthe / who by his own
blood had quyckened or raised fro death the man / which by his sin was put to
death / and as he preched sum of the mynystres and sergeauntes of the emperor
that were committed and ordained for to take the christian men / took saint
demetryen and would have presented him unto the emperor maxymyen but it happed so
that the emperor was goon to see a battle that should be done for much he
del^ted him to see shedyng of blood humayn / in the same bataylle was a man
named lyneus / which by cause of the victoryes that he in his days had had /
was much loved of the emperor / but as fortune changes often it happed that
this lyneus was there wounded to death / and when the emperor was returned in
to his paleys sorouful and angry of the death of the said lyneus mention of
demetryon was made unto him / then was the emperor sore moeuyd against him /
in so much that in the same prison where he was sore fetheryd and hard holden
/ he made him to be stycked thorugh and thorugh his body with sharp sperys /
the which saint demetryen / thus / ever wytnessyng the name of Ihesu consumed
there his marterdom / Many miracles were made by his merytes and by his good
virtues / on al them that with good feyth deuoutely reclamed him / a man that
was called lemycyus / who hertelye loved and served god / gafe much of his
goods to the hows where the holy corpse of Saint demetryen was buried / and
maad the place more gretter than it was tofore and bylded there an oratorye or
chapel in thonour of the said marter saint demetrien / One of the prefectes
or Iuges of thessalonytence that named was manam was much agreeable to god and
to the world / on which thenemye had great envy for his good werky^ and began
to tempte him sore and strong / and first he tempted him of the seven dedely
sins / but god would that he never should overcome him / when the devil saw
that he might not deceive him he took from him al his temporal goods and
finally smote him with such a sickness / that he had no membre wherwyth he
might help him / saufe only his tu^ge / with the which he praised and
thanked ever our lord / after this the enemy apprryd to one of his servants
in likeness of a man and showed to him a cedule / saying thus to him / if thy
master did put ones this cedule or scrowe on him / he should be anon al hole
of his sickness / for it conteyneth within written the names both of the
gods and of thau^gels / anon yede forth the seruau^te and told it to his
master which answered to him / god that made me may save me if it plese him /
and without his pleasure no thing may be done / al is his / and al thing lies
in his hand / he may well take that is his / therefore let^ his will be done /
Soon after these words he fyl in a sleep / and as he would sleep he herd the
voys of saint demetryen that commanded him that he should make him self to be
borne within his church / and that he should there recover his health / and
when he was borne thither he fyl yet ageyn on sleep and herd saint demetryen
that said / god that created the and that restores to the folk their health /
when he will send to the comfort and help / when he was awaked fro sleep / he
reherced how saint demetrien told him in his sleep god that heleth seek folk
send to the comfort and help / and how at tho words our lord sent to him
health and rendryd to him the force and strength of all his membris and stood
upon his feet / and forthwith knelid and thanked our lord and the glorious
marter also / the solempnyte of this glorious marter Saint demetrien that many
virtues has made is celebred the viij ydus of the month of octobre and his life
was translated out of greek in to latin by saint anastaysye and sent it to
charles the emperor to the preysyng and reverence of god whom by the merytes
of the said glorious marter saint demetrien heleth us of all our sins amen /

Here follows the life of saint rigoberte
Saint rigoberte was archebisshop of raynes / ever filled with holiness and
reigned in that time / in which two noble kings did regne in france / that is
to wete childebert and daugsberte / and was extract or come out of the most
excellent lygnage that was in all the regyon / His fader had to name constantyn
/ and his mother was called francigene / which was of the contreye of porcyen /
Saint rygoberte fro the time of his yongthe gafe and habandoned him self to
heavenly and celestyal dysciplyne / he loved chastyte / he was ready in
watchynges and prayers / true both in word and in deed charitable / full of
abstynence / founded in humylite / aourned of sapyence / In Justice true and
Just / prudent and wise in counceyl / and honest in all condycions al in good
virtues he proceeded / thus as he grew and perseuerd ever fro better to better
in spyritual deeds and that he was of age parfyte / by eleccion celesty al he
was chosen and enhaunced in to the dygnyte of archebssyhop of raynes in which
dygnyte by the grace of our lord he mayntened and gouernyd him so / that he was
both louyd and dradde of al folk / It was no meruaylle if the good people
loved him / for much they desired to here his good doctrines and monycyons
spiritual / and humbly to serve him / Ne no meruayl it was if the evil folk
doubted him / which for their sins doubted much to be repreuyd of him /
Saint remy writes that by him was / as it was by saint peter / that did appear
to them that thought to do well much debonayrlye / And as saint poule that to
the synnars showed him Increpatybly / for he promised mysericorde to them that
were in sin / to the end that they should amend them self / and to the good
folk he promised pain without end / if they fyl from their good werkys / He
feryd the good folk / to the end that they should take no vaynglorye within
them self for their good deeds and the synnars he recomforted / to the end that
for their sins and malice they should not be dyspeyred / but that they should
be dyligent for to put fro them their sins / and to fall in penance /
therefore / by his good and dylygente predycacyon he Inuyted many one to do
good werkys /

By the multyplycacion also of his good doctrynes many one led a life of holy
conuersacyon / by his good ensaumples many one he wythdrewe unto his holy
company / thus he gave him self to all folk / trauayllyng alweye for their
salvation / He was archebysshop of raynes after a man that was full of great
virtues that men called reole / which was nyghe / cosyn to him as sum folk
say / when the foresaid reole was deed the syege of rayns vacaunte and was
void by many yerys for cause of many things that were destroyed which by
long process of time had be gotten and with great devotion and dylygence
founded / all the which things the same glorious saint Rygoberte repaired
and restored in to their first estate for he ordained a relygyon of chanonnes
and clerks after the nombre that they had be in time before passyd / and
suffysauntlye ordained for their living / to the end that they should tend and
wait bysyly and dyligentelye to the deuyne service / They took not the
canonyke breed / for the chanonnes that were at ye time / were not of such
reule as the chanonnes be in time present / but they governed them self after
the reule of saint austyn / Nevertheless he gafe to them many things which
they kept as their own good / to the end that perpetuelly they might help
them with at their need / He was also the first / archebysshop of raynes that
first ordained a common tresour in their church and general to al their vsages
/ necessary in time to come / these werkys he made and many moo Innumerable
virtues and miracles / and he filled with benewred auncyente of days by holy
perseueracion rendered his soul unto our lord cui honor et Imperium /

Here follows the lif of saint laudry
SAint laudri of whom herafter we ioyefully shall make memory and solempnyte /
was right glorious bishop of paris / we read in the cathologe that is made and
writon of the succession and of the nombre of bysshoppes in paris / how saint
denis was received by saint clemente / the which saint denis waited ever for to
goo there as he wist the error of the paynyms reigned most / god that guyded
him brought him to paris and there he was the first bishop / and there he
ordained clerks and officers for to serve the church / after saint denis was
they ix bishop saint marcel / after saint marcel the ix was saint germayn /
and saint laudry was the ix bishop after saint germayn / and thus it apperyth
that he was the xxvij bishop after saint denis / he sat in the chayer of the
church cathedral of paris in that time that the noble clouys reigned king in
ffraunce / which by the great and fervent leave that he had to the church of
saint denis gafe tothe same many yeftes and made the said church much rich
as the preuyleges of the religyous there testefyen to this day / xxv bisshoppes
were in the chayer of the church of paris before saint laudri as above is said
/ of whom the names ben writon in the pryuyleges of the said church / and
nevertheless none of them al was made archebysshop / all the entencion of saint
laudry whiles that he lived in this world was tacomplisshe myseri^orde / and he
him self departed or dalte the almoses to the pour at al times / we have seen
and known that a man which men called Raoulgraca^d was smyton sodaynlye and
had the heed much great and swollen and was so read in ye face of him that al
folk that saw him demed and held him for a leper / which man with great
haste came to the presence of saint laudri and there he confessyd hyn much
deuoutlye receyung benygnelye his penance / and after he came to the sudayr of
the saint and with great devotion kyssed it / and when he had done his offryng
and vow with much great feyth and hope he returned / and uneath he was
comen to his hows when he became as hole as ever be was / be therefore the name
of god preysed / who for his good friend saint laudry he helyd so promptelye
the forsaid pacient / Upon a another time a squire full of pa^sye so much that
he could not help him self with foot ne with hands / his friends seeing him so
oppressyd of this seeknesse made a bargeyn with a physicyen for to help him It
happed so that on a day as this pour saw him self so oppressyd with the said
sickness / and no remedy myt be found to it / he began for to weep and to
reclame saint laudry / sayng o blessed saint laudry vouchesaufe to behold on
my myserye / and then he prayed to his friends that they would bear him unto
the sepulcre of Saint laudry / which did as he prayed them Then the bishop
of Paris named mauryce that was there / seeing the devotion of the said seek
man / prayed to saint laudry that health he would Impetre unto god for him by
his glorious merytes / and with one of the teeth of the saint touched the
places on his body that most greuyd him making the sign of the cross / and
anon he became al hoole / Item it is read of a knight named gyberte that had
a thorn within his knee / whereto he found no remedy by no manner of medecyne
/ and was as dysperate / not only for the doloure and pain that he suffered /
but also for fawte of hope to be heelyd / The which knight made him to be borne
in to the church of saint laudry / and with his sudarye did to be made over
him the sign of the cross / and anon after the thorn issued out fro his
knee / and Was al hoole helyd by the merytes of the saint / whom we beseech to
pray god for us AMEN

Here follows the life of saint mellonyn
IN the time of the emperor valeryen / saint Mellonyn / which was borne in
the great bretayn came to rome to pay / the trybute of his land and / for to

in prayers / in watchyng / and in fastings he perseueryd / on a time as he
said his mass / both the pope and he to gyder saw at the right syce of
thaulter an aungel that took to him a staff pastoral saying in this manner /
melonyn take this staff / under the which thou shall rewle and govern the
city of Roen / For all the people there is of god and al ready to thy service and

Here follows of Saint yues
SAint yues was borne in litel britayn in the dyocyse of Triguyer engendryd or
begoten of parents noble and catholyke and was reuelyd to his mother in her
sleep that he should be sayntefyed / In his first eage he was of right good
condycyons / and right humbly and deuoutelye frequented the chyrches / Heeryng
ententyfly the masses and the sermons / Much of his time he employed to study
bysyly the holy letters / and read much curyously the life of the saints and
peyned him self much withal his power for tensyewe them / the which by
process of time was aourned of right great wysedom and renommed full of great
science / both in right cyuyl and in Cannon / and also in theologye well
letterd / as it apperyd sithe / as well in contemp^ions Judgment / as gyuyng
counceyll to the sowles upon the fayte of their conscience / For after that he
had ocupyed and excerced much holyly and deuoutelye the fayte of aduocacye in
the bysshoppes court of Tryguyer / ever pletyng without taking any salarye /
the causes of the miserable and pour persons / exposyng him self to it with
his good gree / and not required by them for to deffende their questyons and
dyfferences / he was chosen in to the office of the offycial / first in the
court of the archedeaken of Resnes / and afterward in the said court of the
bishop of Tryguyer / which lawfully / Iustlye / and dylygentlye accomplysshed
all such things that been parteynyng to the said office / He socoured them
that were oppressyd and that had wrong / and to euerichone rendryd his own /
by right without any accepcion or taking of money nor none other god / The
which then called to the gouernemente and gydyng of souls / bare ever with
him the bible and his breuyary or portoes / and so he made and ordained in the
order of preesthode / celebred as every day / and herd much humbly deuoutelye
and dyligently the confessyons of his parysshens / he vysyted the seek folk
without dyfference / and recomforted them right wisely and taught to them the
way of their saiuacion / and deuoutelye admynystred unto them the precious and
blessed body of our lord Ihesu crist / and for certain in all things
apperteynyng to the cure of the people of our lord Ihesu crist / committed to
him / he in all and oueral accomplisshed duly and right worthily his mysterye /
he prouffyted ever gooyng bysyly fro virtues in to virtue / and was plesaunte
both to god and to the world / in so much that the folk were full loathe to
depart fro his words and fro his felawshyp / and much abashed Were they ye
saw him for cause of his friendly manner and for wonderful holiness / what
meruaylle / he was of admyrable or wonderful humylite / which he showed oueral
/ in habit or clothyng in deed / in words / gooyng coming and being in dyners
companyes / he spoke ever to the folk both more and less swetelye and full
mekelye lokyng on the earth / his hode before his face / that he should not be
preysed of the folk / and teschewe al vanytres / and by the space of xv year
before his death he ne ware but course clothe russet or white / such as pour
folk of the contreye ben acustomed to were / he held the eywer and also the
towel while the pour wesshed her hands / and after with his own hand
admynystred to them the mete that they should ete / and setting him self on the
ground ete with them of the said mete that is to wete broun bread / and
sometime a little podage / and emonge them that ete with him he had no
prerogatyue / but the most dysfourmed and most miserable he sat nyghe him /
he lay al night on the ground and had for his beddyng for shetes / for
couerlet / and for hangyng only a little straw / Ever before the celebracion
of his mass or he reuestyd him / he knelyd down before thaulter and deuoutelye
made his prayer weeping and pyteously syghyng / and oftymes as he celebred his
mass plente of teerys fyl fro his eyes allonge his face / the humylite of whom
plesed much unto out lord as ones it apperid by a colombe or dowue of
merueyllous resple^dour which openly was seen fleing within the church of
Tryguer about the altar where this holy saint yues said mass and certeynly
full pacyently he suffered all Iniuryes and blasphemies / For when men did
mocque him or said evil to him / he answered no thing but having his thought /
on god sussteyned their evil words pacyentelye and with great joy / A man he
was of transquylyte for he louyd pees / and never he was moeuyd to no stryffe
/ Indygnacion or ire for no thing that ever was done to him / He said no
words tumelous ne contumelious / ne other dyshordynate words / He was
deffensour without dread of the lybertres of the church / whereof it happed
that as a sergeau^te of the kings had taken and led with him the bysshoppes
horse of triguyer for thencheson of the centysme of the goods of the foresaid
bishop / saint yues then being in the office of offycyal / virtuously took
the said horse fro the said sergeaunte and led him ageyn unto the bysshoppes
place / and how be it that men demed and wend that great evil or dommage should
fall therefore / as well to saint yues as to the church / se^yng that the
sergeaunte was about to have procured it / Nevertheless no manner of dommage
came never thereof neither to the Saint nor to the church / Which thing was
holden and reputed for a miracle / and not without cause attrybued to the
merytes of the said saint yues / for it is bybeuyd and testefyed that he was
chaste / both of flesh and in thought all the time of his life / and also
chaste both in words and of eyes / and lived alweye so honestlye and so
chastlye that never no tokens of worldly manners apperidd on him / but
certeynlye ever he abhorred and cursyd the sin of lecherye / and he
accustomed to preche against the said sin made many a person to flee from
hit /

He was never found sloweful ne neglygente / but ever ready to oryson or
predycacion / or else he was studyeng in the holy scryptures / or doing werkys
of charity and pity / Ever he ocupyed him self in well after the doctrine of
the appostles / He proufferyd him to god in all things pryuables and without
confusyon in his werkys / He treated to right the word of virtue and of
truth / and ever eschewyng all vain words / spoke but little and with pain
/ saufe the words of god and of salvation pardurable / and he prechyng the
word of god right well and boldelye brought often them that herd him to
compuncyon of heart and evermore unto teerys / and he excercytyng and ocupyeng
him in this holy operacion or work there as he might be herd by the leave of
the bysshoppes and dyoceseyns ever going on foot / preached sometime upon a day
in four chyrches much far one from another / and to the end that he should
not leave the custom of his abstynence he after this great labor returned
fasting unto his hows / and would never accord with no man to dyne with him /
He had the spyryte of prophecye / for he prophetysed that a re^luse should be
seen emonge men by the vice of couetyse / The which thing happed not long
after / For the myschaunte recluse / leuyng the weye of salvation and of
penytence / yede out fro his celle and took a worldly and dampnable way /
This holy saint yues labored ever to pease all dyscordaunce and stryf after
his power / and the folk which might not accord by his persuasyon / and
admonestynges / called soon to concord after his oryson by him made to god /

It may not be recounted ne never it was seen in our time / the great charity /
pity / and myserycorde that he had toward the pour Indygente and suffretous /
toward the wydowes and to the pour children both fader and moderlesse / all
the time of his life / all that he received or might have / as well of the
church as of his patrymonye he gave to them before said without any
dyfference / when he was dwelling at resues and promoted to thoffyce of
offycyal there at the court of tharchedeaken / also or he chaunayd his manner
of living / he made upon the great and solemn holidays / plente of mete to
be dressyd and red^ for to ete / and at dinner time he called and made to be
called the pour folk to dinner / and to them admynystred mete with his own
hands / and after he ete with two pour children which for the love of our lord
Ihesu Christ he sustained at scole / for ever he was right curtoys to help
children / both fader and moderlesse / and as their fader sent them to scole
/ and with his own sustained them / paid also the sallarye to their masters
/ He reuestyd right curtoysly the pour naked of our lord / It happed ones that
a gown and an hode both of like clothe which he had do make for himself to
were / and so he taking gretter cure of the pour naked then of his own
body / gave the said gown and hode to a pour man / He held hospytalyte
Indyfferently for the pour pylgrymmes in an hows which he did make for the
nones / to the which he admynystred both mete and drink / bed / and fire
for to warm them in winter / In where someuer a place that he went / the
suffretous and pour that ran to him fro al sides / followed him / for all that
he had was ready to their behofe as their own / He gave sudaryes for to burye
with the deed bodies / and with his own hands help to burye them / a pour
man ones came against him / and he having as then no thing ready to give him
/ took his hode and gafe it to the said pour man and yede home bare head / He
chastysed his flesh much sharply / for he was so accustomed to be in
orysons and in prayers and to study that the most part of the time he passyd
without sleep both day and night / if he ne were sore trauaylled by ^tudye

Here follows the life of saint Morante
THe king theodorik commanded to Saint morant of dowey which was in paris /
sone of aldebaulte a noble ffrenssheman and of saint Rotrud of marchyennes /
the which had three daughters vyrgynes and saints / that is to wete clotende /
eusebe / and ellysente / Saint rotr^d dwelled at marchyennes in a nonnerye with
clotente and elyssente her daughters / by the ordenaunce of saint amand and
with many other and there she passyd fro this world and eusebe her other
daughter dwelled in an abbay of nonnes in haynegowe with the grant mother of
saint aldebaulte her fader the which was called gertrude / and the abbey
nyuelle / of the yefte and foundacyon of saint amand and in the same contreye
were many abbayes of monks / whereof as co^^ to our purpoos / Saint morante
(...) rotrud his mother did bylde and (...) an abbey on their own ground (...)
monks therein and gafe to them rentes and possessions for to live on / and
called the place bruell /

The king theodoryk that well wyste of it / commanded to saint morante that he
should make saint amer to be led as prysonner fro peronne unto the said new
abbay / and to do him to be kept / that he should not scare fro thens and goo
somwhere in other place Saint morante came to peronne and fro thens brought
with him Saint amer thorugh cambray / and saint amer whiles that they made the
dinner ready there / he went to our lady of cambray and made there his prayers
knelyng he took of both his gloves and his habyte and cast them nyghe to a
glass wyndowe / but the rays or bemys of the son sustained them fro the
ground as they had hanged upon a staff / And the holy man which ever looked
humbly dounward perceived it not / Saint morant followed him sone after to the
church / and when he came there and saw the miracle / he was al abashed and
prayed him of mercy of that he had brought him thither like as a prysonner /
and besought him that fro thens forthon he would become his fader in god and
that to his commandments he would obey / Saint amer then which retched
not for that / lift him self up and reuestyd on him his habyte and gloves /
and thanked much saint morant and said to him that he should obey the king /
for thereto he was holden / and that as for him he should obey to our lord and
should bear in all pacyence his aduersytres / and that gladly he would goo with
him there as he was ordained for to goo / saint morante then led saint amer
at bruel in haynegow where many holy mynsters or abbayes were separed and
gouernyd by the dyscyples of Saint amande / which were all saints / There
was Saint amer like as he were in paradys terrestre / all the contree there
about resplendysshed with saints both men and wymmen in great penaunces /
servants and frendys of god euerychone forced him self to pass his felawe in
well without evil and wicked envy and with great charity one gafe ensaumple to
another for to do well / when saint morante and saint Rotrud his mother knew and
enough wyste the devotion / humylite / pacyence and doctrine of saint amer /
they prayed him that he would empryse or undertake the cure or gouernemente of
the abbey of bruel which they had founded on their patrymonye / they gafe
their own self / their abbay / and al their good to him / and saint amer
received them mekelye and dwelled there together pesablye /

All the other holy men there desired much to here his doctrine / saint amer
enorted and taught so much Saint morante that he made him clerk and ordained
him unto deaken / and maad him abbotte of his own hows founded in the honor
of god our lord and of saint Peter / Saint Amer did do make a chamber ioynyng
to the church for his oratorye wherein he restyd him with our lord / not
slepyng / but watchyng / fasting / and contynuelly prayeng / There made the
holy man his holy penytence as long as he lived / And when our lord would call
him unto his company / he received his ryghtes and took leave of saint morante
and of the other freres and so deyed there / and was buried within the church
of saint Peter of doway / and rendered and yaue his soul to our lord about the
year of grace seven hundred / I have said before that which I now say / the
life of saints were nyghe lost and all their legendes by the normans / which
wasted and spylte the land with ij hundred and two and fyf^y ships of men of
arms which aryued and came in that same land / and walked thorugh france
unto Romanye / gooyng and coming by the space of forty year and began about
the year viij hundred and one and fyfty / if one escaped there were ^weyne lost
/ and yet oner all other diverse werrys were that merueylle it is / how we
know of none / Therefore we shall pray to our lord Ihesu christ /

Thus ends the life of saint Morante
Here follow the life of saint Lowys king of France
Saint Lowes sometime the noble king of france / had to his fader a king right
christian named lowys / this lowys fader bataylled and fought against the
heretykes and ablygoys and of the contre of toulouse and extyrped their here is
ye / and as he returned in to France he passyd unto our Lord / Then the
child of holy chyldehode faderlesse / abode and dwelled under the keeping of
the queen blaunche his mother sometime daughter to the king of castylle / and as
she that louyd him tenderlye / betoke him for to be lernyd and taught under
the cure and governance of a special master in condycyons and in lettres /
and he also as the young salamon / child wise and dysposed to have a good
soul / prouffyted right gretelye in all things more than any child of his age
/ of which good life and chyldehode his debonayr mother enioysyng her self /
said often times to him in this manner / Right deresone rather I would see the
death coming on the / then to see the fall in to a dedely sin ageynste thy
creator / the which word the devout child took and shette it so within
his courage that by the grace of god which deffended and kept him / it is not
found that ever he felt any a^ouchemente / ^atche or spotte of mortal crysme
/ In the end by the pourueaunce of his mother and of the barons of the land to
the end that so noble a royaulme ne should not faylle of suc^essyon ryalle / the
holy man took a wife / of the which he received and gate on her fair children /
which by souerayn cure le made to be nourysshed / endoctrined and taught to
the love of god / and despyte of the world / and to know them self by holy
admonestyng and ensaumples / and when he might tend secretelye to them /
vysytyng them and requyryng of their prouffyte / as the auncyente thobye / gave
to them admonestyng of salut / techyng them over all things to dread god and
to keep and absteyne them assyduelly from all sin / Garlondes made of Roses
and of other flowers / he forbade and deffended them to were on the friday /
for the crown of thorn that was on such a day put on the heed of our lord /
and by cause that he wyste well and knew that chastyt^e in delyces / pity in
rychees / and humnlyte in honor / often peryshen / betoke and gave his courage
to sobryete and good dyete / to humylite and my sericorde / keeping him self
right curyously fro the pryckyng / sawtes and watch of the world / the flesh
and the devil / chastysed his body and brought it to seruytude by the
ensaumple of the appostles / he forced him self to serve his spyryte by diverse
castygacion or chastysyng / he used the hair many times next his flesh /
and when he left it for cause of over feblenesse of his body at the Instaunce
of his own confessor / he ordained the said confessor to give to the pour
folk / as for recompensacion of every day that he faylled of hit / forty
shyllynges / he fastyd alweye the friday / and namelye in time of lent and
aduentes he absteyned him in tho days from al manner of fysshe and fro fruytes
/ and contynuelly trauayll^d and paynyd his body by watchynges / orysons and
other secrets abstynences and dyscyplynes / humylite beauty of all virtues
resplendysshed so strong in him / that the more better he wexyd / so as dauyd
the more he showed him self meke and humble / and more foul he reputed him
before god / For he was acustomed on every satyrday to wosshe with his own
hands in a secret place / the feet of sum pour folk / and after dried
them with a fair towel and kyssed much humbly and semblahly their hands
dystrybuyng or desyng to every one of them a certain of silver / also to seven
score pour men which daily came to his court / he admynystred mete and
drink with his own hands / and were fed habonndantlye on the vygyles
solemn / and on sum certain days in the year to two hundred pour before
that he ete or drank / with his own hands admynystred and served them both
of mete and of drink / He ever had both at his dyuer and sowper three
auncyente pour which ete nyghe to him / to whom he charitably sent of such
metes as were brought before him / and sometime the dysshes and metes that the
pour of our Lord had touched with their hands / and specialle the soppes of
which he feign ete made their remenaunte or relyef to be brought before him /
to the end that he should ete it / and yet ageyn to honor and worship the name
of our Lord on the pour folk / he was not ashamed to ete their relyef /

Also he Would not use scarlate ne gowns of rich clothe / ne also furryng of
over great pryse and cost / and namelye sithe he came fro the parties of
beyond see the first time ageyn / he coueytyd by great desire the growyng up
of the feyth / wherefore he as very lover of the feyth / and covetous for to
enhaunce it / as he yet that of late con^allesshed and issued out of a grievous
seeknesse / lyeng at pontoyse took the cross with great devotion fro the hand
of the bishop of paris / led with him three of his brethern with the grettest
lords and barons in his royalme and many a knight and other people with him /
applykd on his way and with right great host arrived in to egypt / the
which setting foot on ground / ocupyed and took by force of men of arms that
same cytee renommed which is called damette and all the regyon about /
Then after the christian oost esprysed and beat with a much great and
wonderful sickness by the Just Judgment of god / many christian men deyed
there / in so much that of the nombre of two and thyrty thousand fyghtyng men
ne was there left on live but syx thousand men / and god fader of myserycorde
/ wyllyng him self showed wonderful and meruaylable on his saint / gafe and
betoke the said king champyon or deffensour of the feythe / in to the hands of
the evil paynyms to the end that he should appear more meruaylable / and as the
debonayr king might have escaped by the next ship nygh thens / always he
yielded him self with his good gree to the end that he might deliver his people
thorugh the encheson of him / He was put to great raunsom which paid / would
yet abide prysonner for the payemente or raunsom of other his lords and barons
/ and then after he put and left so as Joseph / out of the chartre or
prison of egypt / not as fleeyng or dredeful returned anon unto the propre or
own parties / but first abode contynuelly by the space of five year in syrye
where he conuertysed many paynyms to the feythe / and he being there / the
christian out of the paynyms hands / dyched and fortefyed many towns and
castellys with strong walls / He found then about sydoyne many deed
bodies of christian men of which many one was dysmembryd and eten with beestys /
and stanke over much / the which he gadred and assemblid with his own hands
With thayde and help of his which uneath might endure ne suffer the stenche
of them / humbly and deuoutelye betook them to the buryeng of holy church /
and after this understanding the sickness of the queen his mother / by the
counceyl of his barons assented / to return in to france / and as he was
upon the sea on the third night after nygh the rysyng of aurora / the ship
where the king was in / hurted and smote twyes against the roche so strongelye
/ that the maronners and other there wend that the ship should have broken
and be plonged in the sea / And then the preestys clerkys and the other folk
there abashed with so great hurtyng of the said ship / found the holy king
deuoutelye prayeng before the body of our lord wherefore they fermelye believed
that god almighty by the merytes and prayers of this holy king / had saved
them from the foresaid peril of death / Then the said saint so returned
into france / was received of all there with great joy / and the more ardant
lie or brennynglye prouffytyng from virtue in to virtue / became to al manner
perfeccion of life / and how be it that myseracion and pity was growyng in him
from his yongthe / Nevertheless he showed then more euydentelye his
charytable deeds on the pour folk socouryng them prouffytably / so as he
might at their need /

He began then to bylde and found hospytalles or howses for pour people to
lie in / edefyed mynstres of relygyon / and gave yearly to other pour
suffretours in diverse places in the royame much money pecunyes or silver He
founded many couentes of thordre of freres prechours / and to many other pour
relygyous / bylded chyrches / cloisters / dortoyrs / and other edefyces
couenables / gafe for god largelye almoses to ye blind / begynes / daughters
of god / and releuyd the mynstre of many a pour nonnerye / He enryched many a
church founded by him with great revenues and rentes in which he many times
excercyted thoffice of charity and of meruayllous humylyte / humbly and
deuontelye seruyng the pour with his own hands by great myserycorde when he
came in paris or in other cytees / vysyted the hospytalles and other small
howses / where pour people lay in / and without abhomynacion of dyfformyte ne
of ordure or fylthe of sum pacyente or seek / admynystred many times knelyng
/ gyuyng mete to the pour with his own hands / In the abbay of royalmonte
which he founded and dowed with great reuenewe and rentes is showed notoryly /
that such and semblable almoses he made there many times / and yet gretter
meruaylle a monk of the said abbay / a leper an / abhomynable and as then
proved both of nose and eyes by corupcyon of the said seeknesse / the blessed
saint lowys admynystred humbly puttyng knelyng / with his own hands both
mete and drink within the mowthe of the said leper / without any abhomynacion
/ The abbotte there present wyche uneath might see that / wept and syghed
pyteously / and how be it that to al Indygente he opened the bosom of
myserycorde / Nevertheless to them that watched in deuyne seruyces and that
prayed for sowles / he maad gretter almoses and ofter / And by the great almose
that he dalte every year to the couentes in paris / both of the freres
predycatours / and mynours / said sometime to his famylyers / O god how this
almose is well set or bestowed on so much and so great nombre of freres
affluyng and coming to paris out fro all lands for to learn the deuyne
scryptures and to the end they might show and utter them thorugh all the world
to the cure and salvation of sowles / Other almoses that he did thorugh the
year / no tunge should suffyse for to reherce it / He worshypped the holy
relyques with much great devotion / and assyduelly grew the cultyuyng of god
and thonour of the saints / He bylded in paris a fair chapel within the paleys
ryalle / in which he purposed and put right dylygently the holy crown of
thorn of our lord with a great part of the holy cross / Also the iron or
heed of the spear wherwyth the side of our lord was opened / with many other
relyques which he received of the emperor of constantynoble / He would speak
to no body while that he was at church heryng the deuyne service / without it
were for great need or great vtylyte of the common well / And then with short
and substauncyous words vtteryd that he would say / to the end that his devotion
should not be let / He might not here ne forbere the reproaches or blasphemies
done to the christian feythe / but he ennamoured of the love of god / as phynees
/ punysshed them right grievously / whereof it hefyl that a cytezeyn of paris who
lothely sweryng had blasphemxed Ihesu Christ against the act or statute ryal /
which saint lowys by the counceyl of the prelates and princes / had ordained
and made for the swerars and blasphematours / at the commandment of the said
saint / he was marked or tokened at the lyppes of him with an hot and brennyng
iron / in sign of punycyon of his sin and terror / and dredefulnesse to
all other / And how for cause of that he heryng sum say and cast in on him
many cursings said I would feign susteyn on my lyppes such laydure or shame as
long as I shall live / so that all the evil vice of sweryng were left and
cast out from all our royame / He had the sygnacle or figure of the holy
cross in so right great reverence that he eschewed to trede on hit / and
required of many relygyous / that within their chyrcheyerde and tombs they ne
should fro thens forthon pourtraye nor pycte the form or figure of the cross /
and that the crosses so portrayed and fygured they should make to be ^laned / O
how great reverence he (...) / He also went every year on the good friday to
the chapel within the paleys ryal / for to worship there the holy cross
knelyng / both feet and heed bare / O dylygente dyscutyng of causes and matters
/ he rendered or yielded Just Judgment / O very dy^^ccyon or love / he
doubtyng that the stryf / a^^ions and pletynges of the pour / should come only
to the presence and knowledge of his counceyllours he went and presyded emonge
them / at the least twyes in a weke / for to here the playntes / which
lightely he made to be dyscuted / and sone after Iustelye Iuged / He
stablysshed also for to have aweye the brennyng couetyse of the vserers / that
no Iustycer should compelle ne constrayne them that were bounden to the Jews or
to other publyke usurers / by letters ne by none other manner to pay or yield
to them their usure or growyng / in the end / after the course or rennyng of
many yerys / understanding and by true report knowing the desolacyon and
perplexyte and the perils of the holy land as another / machabeus / with his
sons not wyllyng that the christian folk and holy persons should susteyn ne
bear any longer evil or pain / enspyred with the holy ghoost / passed and
saylled ageyn over the high see unto the holy land accompanied with the
nobles and much comynaltee of his royame / and when / the ships were ready
for to saylle / saint lowys beholding his three sons and specially dressyng his
words toward theldest / said sone consider thou must / how as now I am
ferforth in age / and that ones I have passed over the sea / also how the queen
thy mother is of great age procedyng nygh her last days / how now blessed be
god we possessen pesably our royame without any werre / in delyces rechesses
and honors as much as plesyth to us or apperteyneth / look then that for
the love of Ihesu christ and his church I ne spare mine old age / and have no
pity of thy dyscomforted and wooful mother / but I leave both delyces and
honors / and expose mine own self to peril for Ihesu christ / which
things I will thou here and know to the end that when thou come to the
succession of the royalme thou do so / The ships then ready saylled on the sea so long that the host areyued at the haven of cartage in auffryke / where
by force of arms the christian men took the castle / and enjoyed the land there
about / and betwyxte thunes and cartage they dressyd their tents for to
dwell there a little time / and in this mean while saint lowys after so many
virtuous werkys / after so many pains and labors which he had suffered for
the feythe of Ihesu christ / god that would benewrely consume his life for to
yield to him fruit glorious for his labors and benefaytes / sent to him an
axes contynuel / and then the holy enseygnementes or techynges which before
he had written in frensshe exposed dylygently to phelyp his eldest sone / and
commanded that soon they should be accomplysshed / and then he being of
thought sight and heeryng hoole / saying his seven psalms and calling all the
saints deuoutelye took all the sacraments of the church / and at the last he
coming to the last hour stratchyng his arms in manner of a cross / and
profferyng the last words / I commend my soul in to thyn hands / deyed and
passyd unto our lord / the year a thousand ij hundred lxx / The corpse of the
glorious saint lowes was transported unto the sepulcres of his faders and
predecessors at saint denis in france there to be buried / In which place /
also in diverse other this glorious saint resplendyssheth of many miracles / On
that day that saint lowes was buried a Woman of the dyocyse of Sees recouerd
her sight which she had lost and saw no thing / by the merytes and prayers
of the said debonayr and medeful king / Not long after a young child of
burgoyne / both dombe and deef of kind / coming with other to the sepulture
or grave of the saint / besechyng him of help knelyng / as he saw that the
other did / and after a little while that he thus knelyd were his eerys opened
and herd / and his tongue redressyd and spoke well / In the same year a woman
blind was led to the said sepulture / and by the merytes of the saint
recoueryd her syghte / Also that same year ij men and five Wymmen / besechyng
saint loyes of help / recouerd the use of gooyng / which they had lost by
diverse sickness and langours / In the year that saint loyes was put or written
in the cathologe of the holy confessors / many miracles worthy to be prrysed
befyl in diverse parties of the world at thynuo^acyon of him by his merytes and
by his prayers / Another time at Eureux a child fyl under the whele of a water
mylle / great multitude of people came thither and supposyng to have kept him
fro drownyng / Inuoked god / our lady / and his saints to help the said
child / but our lord wyllyng his saint to be enhaunced emonge so great
multitude of people / was there herd a voys saying that the said child named
Johan should be vowed unto Saint Lowys He then taken out of the water wa^ by
his mother borne to the grave of the saint / and after her prayer done to saint
Lowys / her sone began to syghe and was raised on live / It befyl the same
time in the dyocyse of beauuays / that ten men were broken within a quarrye /
there as they did fetch out great stones for to by^^e wythal / For on them fyl
a great quantyt^e of earth / in so much that they were couerd with hit / A
clerk then that passyd there foreby / he^^e their syghyng / and having pity

much that by the merytes of the Saint to whom they trusted much / they had

as hoole as ever they were before / how be it that in certain they were deed /
It happed on another time that a great wall fyl on a child which was reputed

Thus ends the life, of saint lowes king of france
And here follows the life of Saint lowes, bishop of marsaylle
SAint Lowes of marseylle was borne of ryal lygnage and had to his fader
charles king of cecylle / and to mother marie queen of cecyle / and loving
humylite he refused and forsook the highness of regalyte and his noble lygnage
/ and how be it that all the worthy faytes of his holy life with few words may
not al be recou^ted / Nevertheless sum we shall reherce to the prouffyte and
techyng of them that shall read or here them / This glorious saint then as
testefyed it is of many dygne of feythe or worthy to be byleuyd / being of
young age / was with his brethern holden and kept under the cure and religyous
dyligence of his master / and how be it that he was tender and young of eage
yet semyd to be aunciente in manners / condycions and courage / and when he was
led in to catheloygne a prouynce of the royame of arragon / with his two
brethern in ostage or pledge for the delyueraunce of the said king their fader
/ he gave him self so fermelye to the study / that in seven year while he was
pledge he prouffyted so much in the feuen sciences and in holy scripture /
that the same gods man / resplendysshyng in wit / might not not only
dispute subtylly in publyke and a part of the said sciences / but also durst
and could propose the word of god solempnelye unto the people and before
clerks / In so much that men supposed and byleued better that god had sent
and enspyred him with such science / than hit had be gotten by him humaynlye /
he confessed him often and dylygentelye and herd the deuyne service deuoutelye
/ and on the solemn and high holy days with great preparacion he received
the body of our lord / and when he was priest he celebred as daily / and
herkened much ententyfly the word of god / and for the nourysshyng of his
soul he gladly and often studied the holy and devout scriptures / fro the time
of his chyldehode he loved chastyte / so that for the most sure keeping of him
self he fled and eschewed the company of al wymmen / in so much that he spoke
to none sauf only to his mother and with his susters and yet selde / He
chastysed his body by abstynence of mete and drink / and made it lene and
dyscyplyned it / as another saint paul / with chains of iron right often with
his own hands / and he puttyng his flesh under the seruytude of the spyryte
/ ware for a shyrte a stamyn or streyner clothe / and for gyrdel he gyrded him
on his bare flesh with a cord / This holy man then remembryng his vow to
enter in to thordre of the friar menours / by him maad ^^yng in ostage as it is
said / in the prouynce of catheloygne / purposed to accomplysshe it / but he
seeing that for fere of the said king his fader / the freres durst not receive
him / he solempnelye renewed the said vow / and by no manner of persuacion and
admonestyng ne for any prouysion that pope boneface had made and given to him
he would not assente to forsake it / which devotion consyderyd / by thassente
of the said pope this holy saint bows took thabyte of religyon of the said
freres menours and knelyng made express professyon in the prefe^ce of Ioh^n
bishop of portuence which as then was mynyster general of the same order /
Meruayllous and much wonderful thing it is and not acustomed to be seen / for
the same holy saint filled with virtues renounced to the right of the first
borne / and defpyted the pomp or worship of the syege rayl and for the wyame
temporal and corruptyble changed and gate the royame pardurable and full of al
manner delyces / He had meeuayllous / / compassyon on the pour people / to
whom largelye he dalte his almoses / This holy saint Loyes as gods pleasure
was (...) pope bonyface promoted him to the dygnyte of bishop / and not
wythstondyng he never changed his habyte / but dylygentelye excerced the
office of bishop / He celebred deuoutelye the ordres examyned dylygently in
life / in condycyons / and in the artycles of the feythe / and he loving
feruentelye the feythe / wyllyng and ever ready to enhaunce it / persuaded and
admonested ententyfly the Jews and paynyms to baptesme / and at the last t^ys
glorious saint / tendyng to god fonteyn quycke and living / nyghe the term of
his days / lyeng on his bed seek with his last sickness / took and
deuoutelye received the precious body of our lord / and how be it that he was
right feeble / he issued from his bed against his creator / and anon after
he passed right gloryously out of this world to the glory of paradyse /
wherefore it was well behoueful and reasonable thing / that he / in whose life
during god aourned with so many virtues and good condycyons should be ennobled
and honored of many miracles after his death / the which miracles are
approved and testefyed by the worthy people of the feyth / and are declared
herafter to the honor and glory of the said Saint /

A maiden of two year of age / the which was agreuyd with a strong axes
which she had suffered by the space of two year / deyed and passyd fro this
world / her fader besoughte the saint for her life / and anon by the merytes of
the saint she was raised and restoryd on live / A child of five year of age by
over great force of an axes deyed / vow by his fader made for him to the saint
was restoryd ageyn unto life / A maiden of seven year of eage / which had
suffered an axes contynuel deyed / and vow made unto the same saint / by her
parents / recoueryd the spyryte of life and lived long after / A woman
conceyuyng two daughters one of the which for cause of a fall that her mother
received against her belly / deyed within the womb of her mother / time came
that the mother should be delyuerd of her bry^he / this child deed and as then
a^^e roten by help and mysterye of mydwyuee was had out one pyece after
another / and vow maad by the fader to the saint / The child so dysmembryd
was restoryd to life and lived after seven mone^hes Another child which under
a bed was found deed / vow maad to the same Saint / was the child restoryd
to life / A woman which by great sickness was passed out of this world vow
maad for her by hy parents unto the saint / recouerd the spyryte of life / and
sy^hen lived long / with these miracles and many other would god his saint to
be magnefyed and rendered honorable to all the world / Therefore let us pray
the holy saint loyes of marcelle that he will pray god for us AMEN /

Thus ends the life of saint Loyes of marcelle bishop
And here follows the life of saint audegonde virgyne
IN the thyme of dagoberte king of France which reigned about the year syx
hundred / was borne saint audegonde of lygnage ryalle / This holy audegonde was
nourysshed in the service of gods / and yet I may say that our lord him self
nourysshed her in his service and endoctryned her as well him self present by
noble vysyons and wonderful as by his aungellys / men and wymmen relygyous and
holy / as w^l by her own holy suster as by other / as it apperyth in her
legende / none ought not then to be meruaylled if she lived holyly / that
was scoler of such a scole / when then this holy audegonde was of eage
competente / her fader and mother would have married her / to a noble man rich
and mighty / but in conclusyon she answered that none other she would take to
her lord and spouse / but our lord Ihesu christ / to whom / of bounte / beauty
/ noblesse puyssannce / richesse and wit may none be compared /

Saint wantrud of mouns which after the decesse of her husbonde Saint vyncente
of Songnyes made her professyon in thabbay of nonnes at mou^s which she had
founded / and wrote and prayed to her mother / that she might have audegonde her
suster with her / for her dysporte / comfort and company in very love and
charytee / audegonde the holy virgyne was sent thither and was taught and
endoctryned by her suster in the manner holdyng of relygyon / Few days after
her mother yet supposyng to have married her / went there where both her
daughters were / and to Audegonde gave a pyete of lynnen clothe / such as
princes weren / and commanded to her that therwyth she should make shertes /
shetys and kerchyers for her paramours / The good virgyn wenyng that her mother
had mente her spouse Ihesu christ / took the said clothe and thereof she made
crysmes / which are put on new borne chyldrens heedes when they be borne to
the fontes there to be baptized / to whom the priest says / take thou this
white clothing which thou shalt bear tofore the syege trybunal of our lord /
wherefore the said holy vyrgyne / to the end that the shyrtes of her own
shapyng and making should be borne to her spouse Ihesu christ / she made crysmes
with her moders clothe / and when she had made them much fair and rich as
for kings sons / she with a merry countenance gave them to her mother / saying
that she had done it in the best wise that she could / when her mother saw the
crysmes and her lynnen cloth thus employed / she was much wroth and evil
apayed / and fette a rod for to beat her daughter wythal / But the blessed
saint fled unto the foreste of mau^euge that was there nyghe / and there she
made her penytence with the comfort and help of our lord / It is said that he
which by thassente and grant of her mother should have had her to his wife came
in to the said foreste for to have rauysshed her by force / but he could never
find ne see her / all went he nyghe her / There she abode unto the time that
her mother was deed / and after she went to moune where she was sacred unto a
nonne by the hands of Saint obyer and of saint amande / and anon after she
bylded and founded her abbay of mauleuge / There was once brouhte to this holy
vyrgyne a great fysshe which she put in to a fountayn for to be kept there /
It happed as such great fysshes ben acustomed to do / that he lepte so high
fro the water that he fyl on the ground and could not return in to the
fontayn / On him came a great raven which would have ete of hit / but there came
a lamb that kept the fysshe fro harm and fought against the raven / so
long that the ladies / nonnes of the place perceived the bataylle / Sum of
them came to the fontayn / and took the fysshe and brought it with them the said
lamb ever followed them unto time the fysshe was before the presence of saint
audego^de and never would depart till ye holy vyrgyn said to him ye have do
right well goo to your herd ageyn / On a nyt as saint audegonde with her suster
together spekyng secretly of their spouse our Lord Ihesu Christ / their candyl
fyl fro the candel stycke and was put out / Saint audegonde took it / and as
god would it lyghted by it self ageyn / Item as on a time they two went to
gyder toward the church of saint Peter / about the hour of sexte / the yates
that as then were shytte / sodaynlye opened before them / at the Instaunce of
their orysons and prayers /

Item ones as she had thyrste / was water brought to her / which was turned
in to wine / by the grace of him that in galylee did turn the water in to
wine / Saint Wandrud saw in a vysyon five days before the death of the holy
audegonde her suster / the blessed vyrgyn marye / both saint Peter and saint
powle princes of the appostles / accompanied with many saints and a great
legyon of aungellys / which led her suster audegonde in to paradyse / She
therefore came to the place where her suster lay seek and was pres^nte when she
rendered her soul to her spouse our lord Ihesu christ / to whom we shall pray
that thorugh the merytes of the blessed vyrgyne audegonde / of which the
miracles both in her life and after her death been without nombre / we may
come there as she is in glory without end Amen /

Thus ends the life of saint audegonde virgyne
And here follows the life of saint Aulbyne bishop
Saint aulbyne was borne of noble lygnage in the partyrs of ytaly^ In his
chydehode he loved and served god ententyfly / and with so great will that he
left both his fader and his mother his parentys and friends / land and all
worldely richesse / and became a monk in an abbay / called in latin
Tincillacense monasterium / where he nedyd show of his noblesse / but only
the good condycyons / He was humble and seruysable unto all / and was ever in
contynuel prayers / and replenysshed with all virtues / ready and apparaylled
to flee and eschew all vices / When saint aulbyne came to the eage of thyrty
year he was maad abbotte of the said abbay / which he governed both
temporelle and spryrituel by the space of five and twenty year so that our lord
was at al times well and deuotelye served / and al goods temporalle daily
grewen there / The bishop of angers deyed that time and then this holy saint
aulbyne by the grace and will of our Lord and by the comune and concordable
assente of all the chappytre was promoted to the dygnyte of bishop there /
where as he was afterward known so parfyte and so charytable that doubtelesse
his promocyon Was cause of the salvation of many sowles / A Woman there was in
the cytee of angyers which had her hands as lame and counterfeyted for cause
of a sickness that men call the gowte / wherwyth she was sore vexyd / and she
made her prayer and demanded help of the saint / and soon she was helped and
releuyd from that sickness / only by that he handelyd three times her hands
/ and on a time as saint aulbyn went thorugh a dowue within his dyocyse he saw
the fader and mother weeping over their child deed / took on them pity / made
his prayer unto our lord / and sodaynlye their child was raised to life / Item
a blind man demanded help of saint aulbyn / and the holy bishop made the
sign of the cross over ^ym and anon he was enlumyned ageyn Item as saint
aulbyn did pass on a time before the prison hows at angers the prysonners
cried and besought him for help / the holy bishop having on them great
compassyon / yede unto the baylye / prayed him for them / but naught auayled
there his prayer / wherefore he went to his church / and soon after his
prayer made to god knelyng before the high altar / a great part of the prison
wall fylle down / and so scapyd every prysonner there / A woman vexyd with a
wicked spirit / was brought before this holy bishop / and as soon as the
enemy perceived the holy man he put him self in to the woman's eye in form
of a litel whelk read as any blood / to whom saint aulbyn making the sign of
the cross / said thou wicked spyryte thou shalt not destroy the eye / which
thou made not nor cannest make / And anon the same little whelke began to
blede as one had flymed hit the enemy then Went from her / which in good
health was left and of her wit restoryd

After our english tunge albinus is as much for to say as / primo / as he
white / quia albinus dicitur quasi albus / and thus this holy saint was al
white by purete of clean living / secundo / as he that in him self has bountee
or goodness / Sic albinus dicitur / quasi bonus / and veraylye this holy bishop
was good / tercio / as he that by vygour or force flies to the spirytualte /
Sic albinus dicitur / alas by nas habens / that is to wete hope / and feyth /
therwyth this holy saint was replenysshed / It is read that saint aulbyn had
ij wives / that is to Wete two nourysses / Whicbe did nourysshe him / whereof
the process or taale is such saint aulbyn lyeng in his cradel was left allone
doubtyng none Inconuenyente in a gardyn / a she wolf came and rauysshed the
child and bare it in to the feldes / two maidens then passed that way /
perceived the child and came thither as he lay on therthe / and having pity on
him / one of them two said / would to god I had milk to foustre the wythal /
and these words thus said she saw her pappes that grew / roos up and were
filled with milk / she then took the child and gafe gym sowke / semblably
said and prayed the other maid / and anon she had milk as her felawe had /
and so they two nourysshed the holy child aulbyn / It happed on a time as the
normans in great nombre of men of arms came in to the contreye Where the holy
corpse of saint aulbyn restyd / and the people there so sore they trauaylled /
that they ne wyste where to become and flee / and a man armed all in white
came emonge the said people and said / why doubt you to sawte and befyghte your
enemy / so that ye have saint aulbyn to your help and deffence / and that
said he vanysshed away / wherefore the people took courage and armyd them and
went against their enemies and dyscomfyted them / Saint Aulbyne was buried at
angers / and when his successor would have / translated him in to a gretter
chapel in the presence of saint germayn and many other moo came thither four
men counterfeted and lame in all their membris / also two blind men / which
all vj were there by the merits of saint aulbyn releuyd in to their good
health / that is to wete the countrefayted redressyd of their membris / and the
blind enlumyned / This holy saint aulbyn Was bishop of angers by the space of
twenty year and vj months / whose soul took his syege in paradyse / the year
of his natyuyte four score / there as by the merytes of him / may led us the
fader / the sone and the holy ghoost AMEN /

Thus ends the life of saint Aulbyne
Here begins the noble historye of thexposicion of the mass
FOr heart devout to understand what it is to say mass / also to consecrate
the body of our lord the precious sacrament of thaulter / It is to know that
ye mass may be comprysed in four parties principal / the first part dureth
from the beginning of the mass unto thofferyng the second dureth from
thoffryng to the pater noster said / the third part dureth fro the pater
noster unto the persepcion / and the fourth part dureth fro the percepcion
unto the end of the mass / as towchyng the first part that is the beginning of
the mass unto thoffrynge / It is to understand that the priest which is as
he that shows the way of god to the people / or he reuesteth him with the
chezuble he begins and says a psalm that is in the third nocturne of the
psaulter the which psalm begins / Iudica me deus and discern / and in the
same psalm he asks iiij things the first is that he may be parted from al
evil company / the second is that he may be delyuerd fro al evil temptacio^ /
the third is that he may be of the holy ghoost enlumyned / and the fourth is
that Ihesu crist give him self to be consecrate by him / and to the entente he
may the more surely and deuoutely consecrate the said sacrament / he
confesses him self generally of al his sins / saying his confiteor / by the
which confiteor he shows four things / first he shows him self worthy of
redargucion or rebuke / secondly he shows him self plain of contricion /
thirdly he requires aid of them that are about him / that he may have
remyssyon of his sins / and fourthly he demau^deth of our lord very
absolucyon / the priest after kysseth thaulter / the which kyssyng sygnefyeth
unity and dyleccion in showing how our lord would vnye or Join our humanyte to
his dyuynytee by great love and take the church for his own spouse / wherefore
the holy church may say thus / Quasi sponsam decorauit me corona / et quasi
sponsam ornauit me monilibus / That is to say that our lord as his propre
spouse / has aourned or cladde me with things precious /

The priest after that draws him to the right part or side of the altar /
sygnefyeng / how god When he had taken our humanyte / after his passion by the
virtue of his resurrexyon / he translated him on the right hand of the fader /
and there the priest begins thyntroyte of the mass / the which sygnefyeth
the coming of our lord Ihesu christ how he would come in to the world / the
which coming thauncient faders prophets and patryarkes and the feythful people
of our lord / desired much ardantlye / and for that they cried with an high
voys and said / Emitte agnum domine dominatorem terre / Syeng thus to god the
fader / Sir we pray the that thou wylt send the sweet lamb having domynacion
in all earth / and to god the sone they said thus / Veni domine and noli tardare
/ That is for to say we pray the / that thou wylt come hastelye and tarry not
Secondly the said Introyte signefyeth how the priest owes to enter the service
of god / and for this follows a verse of the psaulter after the said Introyte
such as apperteyneth to the day the which verse sygnefyeth how we ought to
put our hands ioyntelye prayeng to him deuoutelye / for he is made as our
propre brother in taking our humanytee for to show us the way of truth /
After follows Gloria patri / the which sygnefyeth preysyng and lawde to the
fader / the sone and the holy ghoost / For after good works / ought to follow
lawdyng and preysyng / after that the priest repeteth the Introyte of the mass
/ to the end that the desires of the ancient faders / prophets and /
patryarkes may the better be showed / After the priest begins and says three
times kyryeleyson / that is to / understand to the fader / and three times
xpe^leyson to the sone / and three times kyryeleyson to the holy ghoost calling
upon the mercy of god / to the end that holy church be accompanied with ix
ordres of angels regnyng in the company of god and this shows the
sygnyfycacion of these words before said / For when men say kyryeleyson / that
is / lord have thou mercy on us / and that is to understand the fader the sone
and the holy ghoost are called by this word only kyryeleyson / for cause that
they been of one nature / and the myserycorde of god / the sone is called by
this other word here xpe^leyson / For how be it that the sone / as touching
the dyuynyte be of one naturei with the fader and the holy ghoost / and not that
wythstondyng he would take with this nature / another nature / that is / our
humanyte for us to give the life pardurable / After that the priest begins
Gloria in excelcis / the which gives witness of the natyuyte of our lord /
For When the aungellys of god had knowleged that god was born / then they al
together enjoyed thereof / cryeng with an high voys / Glory and laud is in
heaven to the trynyte / and also pees is in earth to all creatures that are of
good will / For before that al creatures Were in no pees / for this that
then war was betwyxte god and creatures / betwyxte thaungels and creatures
/ betwyxte creature and creature / The Inobedyence of adam caused the first
werre of that he had offended god / whereof followed the ij other werres /
Therefore he that is very pees would be borne in therthe for to show and set
emonge us very pees / and therefore all the company of aungellys of paradys
sange with an high voys Gloria in excelsis / sit inter angelos / that is to
say glory and lawdyng be emonge the aungellys in heaven / pees and concord be
in earth betwyxte creatures and god / For therforehe would take nature of god
and man for to render us pees and to him be reconcyled / Therefore creature may
and owes to say of good heart to the ensaumple of aungelles of paradyse these
words following / Laudamus te / benedicimus te / glorifi^amus te / that is to
say / we lawde the / we bliss the / we glorefye the / and for thy great glory
we yield to the graces and thanks / Lord god / lamb of god / sone of god the
fader / thou that take aweye the sins of the world have mercy on us / Thou
that take the sins fro the World will receive our prayers / thou that
syttest on the right hand of the fader have mercy us / thou that art holy /
thou allone art lord / thou only art highest Ihesu christ in the glory of
god the fader with the holy ghoost / and al ^hese lawdynges does the priest
with this prayers in saying Gloria in ^xcelsis etc^ / for all holy church /
After when the priest has said Gloria in excelsis / he tourneth him toward the
people and saleweth them saying Dominus vobiscum / and that sygnefyeth salut
which our lord gafe to his appostles / after his blessed resurrexyon / when he
apperyd to them and said / pax vobis / that is to say / pees be with you / and
for this / in that representyng he saleweth the people saying dominus vobiscum
/ to the end that the creature have his thoute toward god and the people answered
/ et cum spiritu tuo / sygnefyng that we ought for to pray for him that has
to say the oryson / and that prays for us / To the end that his oryson may
be herd of god and enhaunced /

Then retorneth the priest toward the altar and says oremus / that
sygnefyeth how yet ageyn he Incyteth us to pray / For in such manner did our
lord to his dyscyples saying / Orate / ne intretis in temptacionem / that is to
say honor and pray to god the fader / to the end that ye enter not in evil
temptacyon / and after the priest goes and prays / saying the oryson for all
creatures / for the which he entendeth and has in memory to pray for / and
for this that our lord has said in the holy euangylle / all that ye shall ask
of my fader in my name / ye shall have / and after the priest says at the end
of his oryson / Per dominu^ nosttrum Ihesum xpristum as he would say / this that
we pray the of we pray in the name of our lord Ihesu christ / reygnyng with
the fader and the holy ghoost / And it is to wete that sometime the priest also
says an oryson the which sygnefyeth unity of feythe or unity of sacrament /
Sometime the priest says three orysons to sygnefye the holy trynyte / or else
for this that our lord in his passion honored and prayed to god the fader three
times / Sometime he says five orysons in sygnefyeng the / v / wounds of our
lord / sometime he says seven in sygnefyeng the seven yeftes of the holy ghoost
/ and owes every one to wete and know / that as many as the priest says of
orysons at the beginning of the mass / as many he says in his secret / and
as many at the end of the mass / and for this same cause as it shall appear more
playnelye at second part / After these orysons the epistle follows / the
which is as much worth / as a message sent to sum other by letter / and it
sygnefyeth the doctrine of the appostles of our lord / the which were sent of
our lord for to teache and endoctryne the people unto the way of truth / It
may be said also that this epistle sygnefyeth the predycacion of saint Johan
baptyste / the which was sent of god for to anounce the coming and doctrine
of him / In Which lore he says thus Penitenciam agite / appropinquabit enim
regnum celorum / That is to say do you penytence / for the royalme of heaven
shall come nyghe to you / and of his sweet coming says yet saint Johan / Ecce
agnus dei etc^

That is to say here is the lamb of god here is he that takes aweye the
sins fro the world / this same epistle may also give us testymonage / that
our lord will descend unto the precious sacrament of the altar for to
sacrefise / as it shall appear in the second part of the mass / after for this
that saint Johan had taught in his predycacion that we should do penytence for
to acquyre and have the royalme of heaven / follows the grayel / that may
sygnefye lamentacion and enbracemente of penance / and after that the creature
devout has herd the predycacion of god he owes to put the hand to the
werkys and do after his power For this grayel here came out of greek tunge / and
sygnefyeth how a creature owes to mount or goo up before god fro degree to
degree by virtue of humylyte / And it is to wete that betwyxe the octaues of
ester / and penthecoste the grayel is not said / For this that the grayel
sygnefyeth penance and lamentacyon or morning / And in this time of pasque
our mother holy church ne does / but joy and makes solacyon for the
resurrexyon of Ihesu christ / and therefore is then said / alleluya / which
sygnefyeth joy and consolacion / for after that creature has done penance by
virtue of humylite in wepynges and lamentacions / he must led after joy and
very consolacion / For our lord says thus / beati qui lugent / quoniam ipsi
consolabuntur / that is to say / blessed been thoo / that wepyn by contrycyon /
For they shall have very consolacion / And it is to Wete that his word /
alleluya is expowned in four manners after four doctors / the first is saint
austyn which exposes it thus / alleluya / Id est / saluum me fac domine that
is to say / sir save thou me / Saint Iherome exposes hit thus / all id est /
cantate / lu / id est / laudem / ya / id est / deum vel dominum / that is to
say / sing you laudyng to our lord Ihesu christ / Saint gregore exposes it
thus / all / id est / pater / lu / id est / filius / ya / id est spiritus
sanctus / That is to say / the fader the sone and the holy ghoost / Or thus /
he him self exposes it / All / id est / lux / lu / id est vita / ya / id est
salus / alleluya then by the same exposycyon is as much for to say / as
light life and health / Fourthly master peter ansydotoyr expowneth it much well
and says thus All / id est altissimus leuatus est in cruce / lu / id est
lugebant appostoli / ya id est / iam surrexit / It is as much for to say / the
right high is lift on the cross / for the which thing the appostles have
wept / and sone after he is risen / In the which exposycyon three things are
showed to us / The first is the cruel passion of our lord Ihesu christ / The
second is the sorrow and anguysshe of thappostles / And the third is the myrthe
and joy of us / for he says that our lord is risen / and in tokenyng of that
/ men syngen alleluya / after this Alleluya he says the verse / which
sygnefyeth all sweetness and virtuous work by the which men retournen to
very Iubylacion / and therefore he repeteth the alleluya after that the verse
is said For by good work men return ageyn to very consolacion / and it is
to wete that fro the septuagesme unto ester day / men owe not to say alleluya
and instead of it they say the tracte / the which tracte sygnefyeth weeping
and lamentacyon for the passion of our lord Ihesu christ that comes nygh that
time / that is to wete / the holy time of lent / and therefore a creature
devout with all his heart owes to draw / to think on that same holy
passion / and during that time men say no sequence / for the sequence
sygnefyeth joy and consolacyon / And that time of lent ne sygnefyeth but
mournynges / and it is to wete that the sequence is said after / alleluya / and
it is said specially on holidays and solemn / In sygnefyeng the plente and
the multitude of myrthes and consolacyon that is sygnefyed by the said alleluya
and Sequence / For in as much that the day is more solemn then other days
/ the more owes creature to lead and make gretter joy in lawdyng the holy
trynyte / After al these things the priest translateth his book to the
synyster part of the altar for to say the euangylle / in sygnefyeng how our
lord when he came down in earth for to expose the holy euangylle to al creatures
/ he drew him to the senyster part / that was toward the Jews for to anounce
to them the holy euangylle / for at that time the Jews had drawn them self to
the lift side / and for this / the priest in that place may represente our
lord pr^chyng and anouncyng the law / And to the end that he may excerce or
do that office more parfytelye / at the beginning of it he says softelye an
oryson / that begins thus / munda cor meum etc^ / In the which oryson he
prays our lord that he will make clean his heart for to anounce his
predycacion / after that he demands the blessyng of our lord / saying / Iube
domine benedicere / that is as much to say / lord command thou that I may
have thy blessyng / and anon he as leuetenaunte of our lord answers and
says thus / our lord be in my heart and in my lyppes / so that I may worthily
and competently anounce the holy euangylle of god / in the name of the fader
the sone and the holy ghoost / and after the priest saleweth the people /
saying / dominus vobiscum / for ij causes / the first cause is to thentente
that the people be the more Incited to here the word of god / and therefore the
people draws toward the euangylle and stands on their feet after
thordenaunce of anathasy then pope / and sygnefyeth that the people ought to
be ready and apparaylled to sustain the feyth of god and very love / after for
this that yet the people be more Incyted to here the euangylle of god / the
priest represents the place of god and says / Sequencia sancti euangelij
etc^ / in making the sign of the cross / to the end that the enemy may not
empeche him / Then the clerks and the people answeryn gloria tibi domine / in
glorefyeng god that has sent to them the word of salute saying / to the lord
be lawdyng yeuen by thy Word to us showed Then the priest says the
euangylle the which sygnefyeth as said is / the predycacyon of our lord god /
the which fynysshed and said / the priest warns him self with the sign of
the cross / to thentente that the enemy may not take aweye fro the creatures
hertes the word of god / After follows the creed that is as the testymonage
and confyrmacyon of the foresaid euangylle / the Which was made and composed by
the appostles of our lord Ihesu christ / in sygnefyeng that this that the
appostles said / fermelye they believed / and byleuyng anounced it / and it is
to wete that the creed is said on the holy days of them that composed it /
that is the appostles of our lord Ihesu christ / and on the holy days of which
mencyon is made within the same creed / that is to wete all sondayes of the
year / Crystemasse day Epyphanye or xiij day / sherethorsday / Ester day /
whytsonday / trynyte sunday / and also in all holy days of our lady / and of
many other / of which men makes mencyon / and this may suffyse as to the
first part of the mass /

Here ends the first part of the mass
And here folowtth the second part
AS for the Second part of the mass that is fro the offryng unto the pater
noster / Every one owes to understand that after the creature has herd the
word of god / that is the holy euangylle / and he adiousteth to it ferme or
steadfast feythe which is fygured / by the creed he owes then to offer or
give his heart to god / for therefore follows the offrynge / And to the end
that the people be the more Incyted / the priest retourneth him toward the folk
and says / Dominus vobiscum / that is to say / our lord be with you / Even so
as he would say / if our lord be not with you / ye can do no good work / ne
good offering toward him / and after the priest says Oremus / Incytyng us to
honor and to pray god then he says the offrytorye / After the priest
takes the lydde of the chalys on which is the host / which owes to be
conuertyd to the body of our lord / and offreth it to god the fader / saying /
Suscipe sancte pater etc^ / Fader will thou receive this hoostye without
tatche or spotte / the which I thy servant unworthy offer to the as to my
god very and certain for all the sins that I have do without nombre / and
also for all them that are here about me / and for all the fyables of god that
are on live / and for all them that are passed out of this world / to
thentente that this oblacion may be prouffytable to me and to them to the
salvation of our sowles in the life parmanable or everlasting / After the priest
makes comyxcyon of wine and water to gyder / and here it is to wete that by
the said water is understand the people / and the wine represents our lord
in sygnefyeng that the said Water and wine shown to us humylyte and also the
comyxyon that the people owes to have with god It may be said also that this
water is medlyd with the said wine / for this that both blood and water issued
out of the side of our lord / and for this he says / Deus qui humane
substancie etc^ / In the which oryson he prays for all / to the end that
by the virtue of the same myxyon / the people may be united to god by very love
and dyleccion / after the priest offeryth the chalys to god saying / offerrimus
tibi In sygnefyeng how our lord Ihesu christ offeryd him self to god the fader
crucefyed on thaulter of the cross for our health / after the priest covers
the chalyce for this that none ordure should touch to that holy sacrefyse / and
after makes a cross over the hoostye and over the chalys saying /
Venisanctificator etc^ / that is as much to say as king almighty I pray the
that thou will bless or halowe this sacrefise in thy sweet name for heart
devout to have pardon / after the priest draws him self to the right side of
the altar in representyng our lord / and there he receives the offrynges of
the creatures / then the people by devotion come and offreth to the ensaumple
of the people of god / which people offryd within the temple of salamon to god
One offryd gold / the other silver / other offeryd bread and other offeryd
wine / and other diverse manners of offrynges / after the priest wessheth his
hands / For it apperteyneth that so precious a sacrament be worthily and
clenely made / after he draws him self even in the mids of the altar and
there he makes a deep enclynacion saying / Suscipe sancta rinitas etc^ And the
same Inclynacion may sign fie the Inclynacyon of god Which enclyned him after
the sacrament to the feet of the appostles and prayed to god the fader / After
he kysseth the altar in sygnefyeng that the virtue of the passion peaseth the
creatures to him After the priest retourneth him self toward the folk and
says / Orate pro me fratres etc^ / and in this he prays the people that they
will pray god for him / For that is none other thing to say / but right dear
brethern pray you god that I may make this sacrefyse worthily / so that I may
see god ioyously / after the priest retourneth him toward the altar and
begins his orysons secret / the which are said for the same cause / for
which the first orysons ben said and as many in nombre / and it is to wete
that these orysons are said softely and secretelye for this that the priest is
nyghe the sacrament / and therefore he will have none empesshemente or lettyng
neither by wys ne by manner / For our lord to the entente he might more
secretelye honor and pray / he went from his dyscyples as far as a stone
might he thrown / These orysons here ben also said low or secretelye for this
that when our lord had raised lazarus the Jews would have sleyne him / Wherefore
he drew him self in to the cite of effraym in a place al allone / and fro that
time he cessyd his predycacion unto palm sunday even / Then he came to the
hows of Simon and openly began to preche / and for this the preeste at the end
of his orysons in dressyng his hands up on hye says / Per omnia secula
seculoram / and for this that he is as messager to god for the people / the
people heeryng this message answers amen / and there the priest begins the
preface / the which is so called / for that it is the preparacion or first
apparayl that gooeth before the sacrefyse pryncypal / and therefore he saleweth
in saying / dominus vobiscum / in saying that We prepare or make us ready so
that our lord may be and dwell with us / and the people answeryth / et cum
spiritu tuo / And thus the people and the priest both prayen each for other /
after the priest Incytyng us / says Sursum corda / that is to say that the
people have her heart upon hye toward god / then answers the people Habemus
ad dominum / that is to say we have them to god / And therefore the people that
there in such hour or in that time has not set her heart to god may of
light lie / after the priest says / Gracias agamus domino deo nostro / that is
to say / yield we graces and thankynges to god / For if the people in that time
has sum devotion they ought to lawde and thank god therefore / and for this
the clerk for all the people answers dignum et iustum est / Right even so
as we would say / worthy and lawful thing is to lawde god / Just thing is to
honor him / and there the priest makes mencyon how the angels and
archaungellys and all the court of heaven preysen and lawden god / and for
this / at the end he prays that with that foresaid company we all may praise
and lawde god / saying with ferme devotion / sanctus sanctus sanctus / the
which words folowen after the preface / for right even there / the priest
representyng our mother holy church / having hope to be accompanied with both
angels and archaungels / confermyth him self to them / and says sanctus etc^
/ and it is to wete that this sanctus is divided in two parties / the first
part conteyneth the lawdyng of the aungellys / and the second conteyneth the
lawdyng of the people / The priest then as to the first part he may
represente thaungellys of heaven / of the which it is read in the book of
ysaye the prophet / that the seraphyns cried with an high wys one to another /
sanctus sanctus sanctus etc^ / In prayeng to the trynyte / saying holy fader /
holy sone / and holy spyryte / all earth is replenysshed with thy glory /

As to the second part he may represente the people of Israel / of the which
we read / that when our lord descended fro the montayne of olyuette and he came
to the cite of Iherusalem / they cried with an high wys / Benedictus qui venit
in nomine domini etc^ / that is as much to say / blessed be he that comes in
the name of god / of him we require pardon / and for this benediccion or
blessyng which is so sweet / the priest makes a cross the which represents
to us / that it is our lord that comes to be sacrefysed on the holy cross /
and there he descends and will be consecrate / to the end that men may see
him presentelye / and therefore verayly the devout people that hereth the mass
right there owes to draw them self within the chamber of her conscience / to
the end that he may cherysshe therein that sweet lamb by devout oryson /
prayeng him that his goodelye coming be consolacion and joy unto every
creature / and there also they owe to think and consydere on her evil deeds
and offenses / to the end that they may show and declare them by ferme and
steadfast contrycyon to him that presentlye comes there / and thus the creature
shall mow thank and regracye god by devout contemplacion After all these
things follows the canon which is so named canon / for the mysterye of the
precious sacrament that is made and consecrate / and this same canon is said
low or secretelye for the virtue of the words / to the end that they be not
hold in fylthe / For auncyently they were profferryd and said hye / wherefore
it was known of the most part of the folk and they sange it thorugh the
streets / whereof we find that sometime shepherdes took sum breed and put it
on a stone and on it they said the words that are wryton in the canone and
that same breed was turned and conuertyd in to a pyece of flesh / and sone
after by he will of god fire descendyd fro heaven upon them and were al
combusted and burnt / and therefore the holy faders stablysshed these werdes to
be said low / also that none should say them without he were a priest / That
same canon conteyneth ix parties as to the first part the priest enclyneth him
self before the altar / the which enclynacion sygnefyeth or beto^keneth the
humylite of our lord which he showed when he enclyned him self at the cross /
and there the priest spekyng to our lord says thus / Tei gitur clementissime
etc^ / that is to say fader right debonayr / we the pray thou will accept
and bless these sweet oblacyons and these holy sacrefyses without corupcyon /
And there the pressed kysseth the altar / sygnefyeng the compassyon that he has
of the passion of our Lord Ihele christ / and after he makes three times the
sign of the cross both over the breed and over the wine / and these iij
crosses sygnefyen how our lord was given and offered in three manners /

First of god the fader for our redempcyon / Secondly of Judas to the Jews by
great treson / Thyrdly of the Jews to pylate by great detraccion / After in
the second part the priest prays for all holy church universally saying
Offerrimus etc^ / that is to say / we offeren / and therefore the priest
speaks not in his own person / but in the person of holy church / There
nys none so wicked and evil after that he is priest but he may consecrate the
precious body of our lord Ihesu christ / After in the third part the priest
has in a specyal mind all the subgettes of holy church / and specially in
that paas he says Ioynynge his hands / Memento eciam domine famuborum etc^
that is to say sir have thou mind on thy servants / and there the priest
rests and has specyal memory of all the creatures / for whom he entendeth
for to pray / and he has also mind partyculer on the persons whom he is
bound to pray for / and it is to wete / that this memory is for the persons
that been on live / after he prays for all them that heren his mass with
feythe and devotion / after in the fourth part / to the end that he him self /
they also which he has had memory of / may have partycypacyon in the glory
of paradyse with thaungels holy appostles and marters / he says a devout
oryson / that begins thus Communicantes etc^ / In the which oryson the
priest makes specyal commemoracyon of the vyrgyne marye / of twelve appostles
of Ihesu christ and of many marters / after in the fyfthe part / the priest
enclyneth him and says an oryson that begins thus / Hanc igitur oblacionem
etc^ / In which oryson he does four things / First he prays to god that
he will receive our service / the second is that we may have very pees in god /
the third is that he fro dampnacion will keep us / The fourth is / that with his
chosen he will led us / And after the priest coming nygh to the pryncypal
consecracion he says / Quam oblacionem / and there the priest makes five
times the sign of the cross over the breed and over the wine / in the
remembrance and tokenyng of the v wounds of our lord / and of his prayer the
sentence may be such / Sir with heart we the pray that of the same this
oblacion be made and consecrate / aproued and confermed in an hoostye ryt
reasonable / and in sacrefyse acceptable so that this breed be transferred in to
thy body / and this wine translated in to the blood of thy right dear sone that
for us suffered great tormente / And therefore he says after in the vj part of
the canon of the mass / as here after follows / and here it is to wete that
all that the priest does / as to the consecracyon / represents or betokens
all that our lord did to his dysciples the day of the cene / that is on
sherethorsday / where he took breed and yeldyng graces to god the fader /
brosyd and gave it to his dyscyples / saying / take and ete / here is mine own
propre body and in the same manner does the priest in this syxte part /
except that right there he bruseth not the breed / But to that signyficacion
or tokenyng the priest enclyneth it both to one side and to other / then the
priest wypeth first these three fyngres on the corporal to the entente that the
more clenlye he may take the precious hoostye / And after he takes it lokyng
upward on hye for to render graces to god / in techyng and tokenyng / that when
we enterprise a good work for to do / we ought to lift upward to god the eyes
of our heart / as to him that is beginning and pryncypal of all good werkys /
after he blesses the breed making the sign of the cross / which sygnefyeth
the blessed passion of our lord on the holy cross /

And after the priest says the words that our lord said take you and ete this
is mine own body / saying five words sacramentel / and soon therwyth is the
breed converted in to the propre and own body of Ihesu Christ that upon the
cross deyed for us / After our lord in his souper took the wine before his
drscyples / and yeldyng graces to god the fader / he blessed and gave it to his
dyscyples saying / take you and drink / for this is the chalys of my propre
and own blood / that is the confyrmacyon both of the new and old testamente
and mysterye of feythe / which shall be spylte for you and for my people in
remyssyon of your sins / and as many times ye shall do this that I show you
here / ye shall do it in the memory of me and therefore in the seventh part of
the canon of the mass / the priest when he has laid down the body of our
lord he takes the chalys / and after lokyng upward he blessyth it / and says
take you and drink / for here is the chalyce of mine own propre blood / and
right soon after the priest has said these foresaid words in latin in mind
of our lord / the wine is converted in to the propre and own blood of Ihesu
christ / that same Which he spylte for us on the rood tree /

And here it is to wete that in this precious sacrament we may consider ix
miracles much meruayllous / the which may be aprouyd by sum semblaunce or
likeness of nature / The first is that the substance of the breed and of the
wine is changed in to the substance of the body and precious blood of christ
/ and this is showed to us by such a symylytude or likeness naturally / that
is / that of food of bread and wine / both flesh and blood are engendryd in
creature / much more stronger / our lord that is sovereign nature / may do by
virtue of his words / that the bred and the wine is converted in to his own
body / and in to his precious blood /

The second miracle is that every day often and many times the breed is
converted in to the propre and own body of our lord / and not withstondyng
none augmentacyon or encrees is don in god / ensaumple of nature / For if I
wot a thing secret I may vttere and reherce hit in many and diverse places /
and notwythstondyng I ne wot it the more ne better than I did toforne / The
third is that every day our lord is parted and eten / and has no dymynysshyng
/ that is to say that god nor the sacrament is not less therefore / reason
naturalle / For if I have a candel light / every one may take of the light of
it / without it be lessyd or dymynysshed therefore Also every one may take that
holy sacrament without dymynysshyng of hit / but who that takes it
unworthily he dymynyssheth him self / The fourth miracle is that when the
hoostye is parted god is in each part entyerly / Ensaumple of the glass / For
when the glass is parted or broken in to pyeces / in every part of hit
apperyth the figure of the thing that is presented before in hit / The fyfthe
miracle is / that if this precious sacrament be taken of an evil and synful
creature / the sacrament of hit self is not fowled therefore / For we see that
the beemes of the son passes thorugh and over ordure and fylthe / and the
son is nothing foul therefore / but rather thordure or fylthe is made clean
thereof / Thus it is that sometime when the creature has received the body of
our lord unworthily / consyderyng that he has mysdoon to have received his
savior in to so great ordure or fylth of sin he conceyueth by bytternesse or
smartyng so great a contrycyon / that he therefore retourneth to grace / and
thus he is pourged or made clean of his sin The syxth miracle is / that the
body of our lord Ihesu christ is sode of death to the synnars / For Saint paul
the appostle says / that he that eteth it unworthily / he eteth it to his
dampnable Judgment / For right even so as strong wynes and strong metes is
vnprouffytable or lettyng to seek people / right so is the body of our lord
Ihesu christ nuysable and lettyng to the synnars / The seventh miracle is /
that so great a thing Which all the World may not comprehend / is contained
in so little an hoostye / For we see that a great hylle may be comprysed and
perceived with an eye / much more stronger / is that the virtue deuyne may be
by his puyssau^ce comprysed and contained in a little hoostye / The viij miracle
is / that our lord al entyerly in diverse places attones is perceived of diverse
persons In such manner We see and perceive that the word of a creature is
known and perceived in dyu ers places attones of many and diverse creatures /
The ix miracle is / when the breed is converted in to the precious body of our
lord the accidents abyden / that is to wete whytnesse / roundenesse and
sauoure / and not therefore it is no breed / but it is the body of Ih^u christ
the which is yeuen under the likeness of breed for this that that might be
great horror a priest to ete raw flessh and also to drink blood / After this
consecracion these miracles are contained / and says the priest in the viij
part of the canon / an oryson that begins thus / Vnde vt memores etc^ / In
the which oryson the priest Incyteth us to have mind of the passion of our
lord Ihesu christ / of his resurrexyon and of his glorious ascencyon / to
the end that by his passion we be Incyted to charity / by his holy resurrexyon
we be Incyted to feythe / and by his glorious ascencion to hope of our health /
ffor his passion shows to us charity / for this that by his charity he would
suffer death for us / And therefore the priest in that oryson he makes five
times the sign of the cross in the memory and mind of the five wounds that
our lord received on the cross / and there that time every creature ought to
set his heart to think on the passion of christ / And thus doing the
creature shall acquyre very feythe by the knowleche of the holy resurrexyon /
and very hope by his glorious ascencyon / after in this same party / the
priest prays that our lord will accept the sacrefyse in such manner as he
did of abel / of abraham and of melchysedech / For specially these three were
accepted of god / as specyal friends / After in the ix part of the canon of
the mass the priest Inclyneth him / which Inclynacion represents or
betokens this that our lord after his souper went to the montayn of olyuete
/ and there he enclyned him self prayeng to god the fader / saying Sir I the
pray if it may be that thou transfer fro me this bitter chalyce and therefore
he says an oryson / that thus begins / Supplices to rogamus In the which
the priest remembers and makes mencyon of the for the foresaid prayer / and
when he comes to say a word that is / Ex hac altaris perticipacione etc^ /
he kysseth the altar / the which kyssyng betokens this that Judas made wha^
he betrayed his master our lord Ihesu christ / and caused him to be taken /
after in this same orison the priest makes three times the syyne of the cross
/ for this that our lord prayed in the said mountaygne of olyuete / he swette
blood allonge his body / and therefore he makes the first cross over the body
of our lord Ihesu christ / and the second cross over the blood for the swetyng
of blood / and the third before his own face for this that our lord prayeng /
had his face enclyned / and therefore the priest makes hit before his face /

This is then the end of the oryson where he prays that We be blessed of
al blessings / and that We be also replenysshed of all grace / After in the
tenthe part / the priest with Joined hands says / Memento domine famulorum
etc^ / the which memento is princypally ordained for them that are passed out
of this world / and for that even there the priest rests and has a general
memory for deed folk / and in especyal for the creatures for whom he is
bound o^ entendeth to pray for / to the end that by the mysecorde of god
they may have very light and very pees in the glory of paradyse / After in
the xj part of the canon of the mass the priest beteth his breast / saying /
nobis quo peccatoribus etc^ / and that sygnefyeth the contrycyon and
repentance that the thief that henge on the cross at the right hand of god
had when he said / Memento mei domine dum veneris in regnum tuum / that is to
say / lord I pray the that thou be remembered of me when thou come in to the
royalme / Then answered god to him / Amen dico tibi / hodie mecum eris in
paradiso that is to say / I tell the / thou shalt this day be with me in
paradyse / And therefore the priest in this oryson spekyng for all synnars /
having hope on the myserycorde and mercy of god he prays that we may have the
pardurable or everlasting life with the company of the appostles / of marters /
and with all the holy saints in heaven / And in this oryson the priest makes
three crosses over the breed and over the wine / the which crosses betoken this
that the Jews cryden three times to pylate spekyng of the blessed sone of god /
crucefye / crucefye / crucefye him for he is death worthy / and therefore makes
the priest these three first crosses / and after he takes the precious body of
our lord and makes five times the sign of the cross / the three on the
chalyce over the blood / and the other tweyne betwyxte the chalyce and him self
/ the three crosses maad over the chalyce may sygnefye the three pryncypal
torments or despysynges that our lord suffered in his passion / The first is
that before he was put on the cross he had much pain and suffered many
spyttynges / and many other grievous marterdoms and tormentys that the proud
and fell Jews did to him / The second is / the despyte and the tormente that
he for us suffered on the cross for to bye us fro the pains and torments of
hell / and the third is / that when he was deed on the cross Longyn thrested
the spear heed in to his precious side / and therefore the priest makes the
three other crosses over the precious blood / Or else it may be said that these
three crosses betokene the holy trynyte / saying / by the fader / by the sone /
and by the holy spirit al honor and glory / the priest makes ij crosses /
and these ij crosses made betwixt the chalyce and ye priest may betoken ye ij
/ licours that issued out of the side of our lord yt was blood and water that
is to wete blood of redempcyon / and water of regeneracyon / After the priest
says Per omnia secula seculorum / and that says he on high / that may
represente or sygnefye to us this that our lord cryeng with an high wys
rendered his soul to god the fader / Or it may be so said / that the priest
says on high / to the end that the folk know the end of the canone and
answer amen / lamentyng and sorowyng the death of our lord / to the ensaumple
of the wymmen that nyghe the cross lamentably and pyteously sorowed and wept
sore for Ihesu christ that they louyd so much / After the priest says oremus
/ precepti salutaribus moniti etc^ / and here he Incyteth us to honor and
prayer after thensaumple of our lord / that taught his appostles / and
therefore he says / precepti / that is to say / we Incyte or admoneste the
commandments of salute / and in form of deuyne Instruccyon worship we /
and hertelye pray we / saying Pater noster etc^ / And so ensyeweth the Pater
noster which was made and Instytued by our lord Ihesu christ / for that same
he commanded his appostles to say / and therefore it is called oracio dominica
/ that is to say oryson of our lord / and therefore ve^^tably here owes ye
creature to say deuoutely this same oryson pater nr^ / and how be it that our
lord knows well what is best for us and what we Will have / Notwythstondyng he
will that both with heart and mowthe we pray him for many reasons / First for
to Incyte us to devotion / For all even so as the bloweng enbraceth or fyreth
the cool / right so the oryson said with heart and mowthe enflameth the
devotion / Secondly for to give good ensaumple to other / for our lord says /
Luceat lux vestra coram hominibus vt videatur etc^ / that is to say / (...)
your light be shynyng tofore the men / so that they may perceive and see your
good werkys / not by ypocresye ne s^mylyng / but by right Ialousye of devotion
/ Thirdly for this that al even so as we by the tongue synnen / rizt so the
devout oryson ought to be made and said with tongue / to the end we may make
satysfaccion to the king of heaven / for the scripture says / Sicut exhibuistis
me^bra vra^ seruire Iniquitati / exibeatis seruire iust^cie and satisfaccioni /
that is to say / as ye have yeuen your me^bris to felonye and wickedness or
corupcion / ye must so obey both to justice and satisfaccion / Fourthly ye
thing which is demanded with good heart is of light granted Of this petycyon
or askyng here speaks our sweet savior Ihesu christ in the holy euangylle
that says thus / Petite and accipietis etc^ / that is to say My frendys ask
you / and ye shall have / And for this verytably every creature ought well to
pray deuoutelye with good heart / saying this devout oryson Pater noster /
for the great mysterye that hit conteyneth /

The mysterye of this devout oryson pater noster is / that it conteyneth seven
petycyons or asking / The first is of the eternal goods / that we may have
them / and therefore says he Pater noster qui es in celis sanctificetur no men
tuum / that is as much for to say Fader that art reygnyng in heaven / thy
sweet name be blessed / The second petycyon is of the goods spyrytuel / that
we may receive them and therefore says he / adueniat regnum tuum / that is to
say / thy royame may become to us / where as We may see the / The third
petycyon is / fiat voluntas tua sicut in celo et in terra / that is to say /
over all be thy will fulfilled and done / so that in to heaven my soul be
led / The fourth petycyon is / panem nostrum c^tidianum da nobis hodie / and
this petycyon here is demanded of the name of fortune which / is a gift of
the holy ghoost / and the askyng is this / Lord give us this day fode so that
of thyn we have cure / that is to say that our lord god will give us our living
/ So that for lack of hit we leave not the service of god / whereof also we may
part and dele to the pour folk membrys of god / The fyfthe petycyon is
Dimitte nobis debita nostra / sicut et nos dimittimus debitoribus nostris /
that is to say / pardone thou to us our misdeeds and fawtes / as we forgive
other the misdeeds by them don to us / The vj petycyon is / Et ne nos inducas
in temptacionem / That is to say / and led us not in to temptacyon / and here
is to be known yt we be tempted pryncypally of three things / the first is god
for to approve our power / Secondly our flesh for to have our appetyte and
lust / Thyrdly is the enemy for to deceive us / Of the first says our lord /
Beatus vir qui suffert temptacionem etc^ / Blessed is he that suffers
temptacion in the trybulaon that god sends / for if he be approuyd / in heaven
he shall be crowned /

Of the second temptacion speaks saint James and says / Vnusquisque temptatur
aconcupiscencia sua etc^ / Every one is often tempted for to poursewe his
desires / Of the third says the scripture / Sathanas temptauit cor tuum etc^ /
Satan has made the to fall in vylonye / The seventh petycyon is / Sed libera
nos a malo / that is as much for to say / deliver us fro all evil that
lets us for to love the / After follows amen / hoc est fiat / that is to
say / the petycyons before demanded been confermyd and granted / and here
says the priest amen / a low for this that they that pray know not that
they be herd and enhaunced / whereby they leave not to pray to god / For
creature devout ought ever to persevere in her prayers and orysons / To the
end they may have their petycyons and askynges / which are contained in the
Pater noster as before is said /

Thus ends the second part of the mass
And here follows the third part of the mass
AFter follows the third part pryncypal of the mass / after that the priest
has said the Pater noster / where as these petycyons before said are contained
/ he says an oryson that thus begins / Libera nos quesumus domine ab
omnibus malis preteritis presentibus et futuris etc^ / And this oryson the
priest says on low / for this sygnefyeth that our lord Was buried in the
sepulcre at complyn time / and how be it that the body restyd in the sepulcre /
notwythstondyng he descended in to hell / wherout he had his friends / and
delyueryd them of all euylles passed / present and to come /

And therefore in this sygnyfycacyon or betokenyng the priest says this oryson
/ Libera nos quesumus vts^ / The which oryson is as thexposycyon of his last
petycyon of the pater nr^ / that is / libera nos a malo / that is as much for
to say / Lord deliver thou us fro al evil / and in this oryson the priest
shows fro what evil he will be delyuerd / that is / of the evil passed now
being and to come / and therefore he says / libera nos quesumus domine ab
omnibus ma^s preteritis presentibus et futuris / that is to say / Lord we the
pray that thou will deliver us fro al evil passed / present / and to come /
and by the mean of thy blessed mother the vyrgyne marye / and of all appostles
/ saint peter / saint / paul and saint andrewe / and of al saints in heaven /
give us pees / to the end that we may be helped of thy myserycorde and mercy /
fro al sins delyuerd and of all torments ensured fro / The priest takes
then the chalyce lydde and kysseth it / and that sygnefyeth to the entente he
may receive that precious sacrament in pees and in charity / and after the
priest takes the precious body of our lord Ihesu christ and parts it over
the chalyce / and this may to us be sygnefyed that our lord parted him self to
his dysciples upon sherethorsday as before is said and is that holy hoostye
parted in three which three parts may betokene three manners of folk / the first
part may sygnefye the creatures that are in paradyse / and this first part
the priest lays on the chalyce lydde / in betokenynge that these ben thoo
that are set in pees With god / the second part may sygnefye the creatures
that are in purgatory / the which are ensured and certain that ones they shall
have paradyse / therefore is this other part set with the first / The third
part may sygnefye the creatures that be in this life mortal / and this third
part the priest holds over the chalyce and says on high / Per omnia secula
seculorum and that he says with an high voys for this that the people heeryng
the pressed who as vycarye of god owes to anounce pees / and the people answeryth
amen / and there the priest enhauncyng his voys says / Pax domini sit semper
vobiscum / that is to say / the pees of god be ever with you / For so said our
lord after his holy resurrexyon to his appostles pax vobis pees be with you /
and there the priest makes three times the sign of the cross / saying Pax
domini sit semper vobiscum / and these three crosses may betokene the three days
that our Lord lay in the sepulcre / or these three crosses may sygnefye the
three maryes sekyng our lord / and when the priest has said Pax domini sit etc^
/ the people answers / Et cum spiritu tuo / prayeng that in such manner wise
the people desires pees / the priest may have it / and anon the priest says /
Fiat commixtio etc^ / and that commyxyon betokens two things / that one is
that the body of Ihesu Christ was not without blood / ne the blood was not
without the body /

She second is that the sacrament is consecrate under likeness of breed and
of Wine / The third thing may be that the third part of the hoostye
sygnefyeth the creatures that are in this world as said is / And therefore it is
lawful to them or they come to god that they have mind and be remembered of the
blessed passion / And of the precious body of our lord Ihesu christ / to the
end that they be medlyd and joined unto his precious sufferaunce / and of his
precious blood aroused by virtue and vnytee of soul / And thus creature
devout shall mow arouse his heart with that precious blood keeping him self fro
evil thought / and his five wits natural for to keep him fro al evil
beholding / fro light heeryng / fro folysshe and vayn spekyng fro plesaunte
smellyng / his hands fro evil Work and his feet f^o all evil place / and
thus doing creature devout shall mow feel the sweet dawnyng of this precious
blood and blessed body meddled to gyder / and it apperith by these verses
following that the three parts of the hoostye sygnefyen the three manners of
creatures before said / Tres parts signant de xpristi corpore sancto / Prima
suam carnem sco^sque secu^da sepultos / Tercia viuentes hec est in sanguine
tincta / martirij calicem gus tant in carne fideles / After follows agnus dei
/ and here it is to wete that the priest says three times agnus dei / and at
the third time at the end of it he says / Dona nobis pacem / And it nys none
other thing to say / Lamb of god that takes aweye the sins of the world
have mercy on us / and this is said two times / to thentente that our lord be
understand gooyng on earth for to have us fro our sins and restyng in the
sepulcre for to deliver us fro the pains of hell / and therefore in these two
first / agnus dei / the priest says miserere nobis / and the third agnus dei /
betokenyth this that our lord be understand being in heaven for to give parfyte
pees / and therefore says the priest at the end of the agnus dona nobis pacem /
Lord give us pees Saying agnus dei the priest enclyneth him self betyng his
br^st at every time sygnefyeng that with humylyte and compassyon he says that
same ornson / After it is to know that at a mass of requiem / the priest
says not at the two first agnus dei miserere nobis / ne at the third agnus he
says not / dona nobis pacem / but the priest says instead of that / dona eis
requiem / For this that three manners of rest ben worthy for the fyables of god
deed / First that all pain he had aweye fro them Secondly that glory with
god be given to them / Thyrdly that the soul with the body together be crownyd
/ And therefore says the priest at the last agnus / dona eis requiem
sempiternam / After this the priest deuoutelye enclyneth him and says a
devout oryson that begins thus / Domine Ihesu xpriste etc^ / and that is as
much for to say / Lord Ihesu christ that said to thyn appostles / I give you
my pees I leave you my pees / therefore I the pray Instauntelye / that thou
will not consider my misdeeds and sins but consider thou the feyth of the
holy church and will it vnye and peease after thy will / thou that reygnest
with the fader in the royame of heaven / and after the priest takes pees
kyssyng the corporalle or the lydde of the chalys / or the body of our lord
Ihesu christ / and that is to teache and show to us / that thorugh the holy
passion of our lord very pees is yeuen to us of god / and also to all humayn
lygne And the priest gives pees to the mynystre or clerk that helps to say
the mass / And that same mynystre or clerk bears it thorugh the church to
the folk / and there the creacares kiss it each after other in token of love
and concord / to the end that even so as flesh joins it self to flesh
/ and spyryte to spyryte / right so we be alyed to gyder by virtue of love /
And here it is to wete that for this that our lord said to his dyscyples / take
ye all of this breed and ete it it is mine own body / therefore in this manner
every one was wont in time passed to be howselyd every day / And for this that
many one took it Indyscretelye and few reuerentelye / for that it semyd to
them that it was not for to do so / therefore hit was ordained to be taken but
one time in a wyke / that is / to wete on the sunday Or to / take it three times
in the year / Or at the least one time in the year / And in that place where
this should be done / should be the pees given every day in token of love and of
very steadfast alyaunce /

And it is to wete that When men say mass for the deed men beren not the pees
/ for this that the fyables of god ben out fro all the trybulacyons of this
world /

Thus ends the third part of the mass
Here after follows the fourth part of the mass
AFter follows the fourth part of ye mass pryncypal / and first the
percepcyons / and here is to wete / that after the priest has taken pees / and
sent pees to the people / to thentente he may receive more deuoutelye the body
of our lord / he says bowyng his knees ij orysons Instytued by the ancient
faders / the first oryson begins / Domine Ihesu criste qui ex voluntate
patris etc^ / And is as much for to say / Ihesu crist that by the will of god
the fader / and wit of the holy ghoost / would redeem the world by thyn
own death / and them to have ageyn in joy and bliss with the / wylt my body
deliver fro al evil / have aweye al my sins fro me and that I may so keep thy
commandments / that I may be and dwell with the in heaven / where thou may
reygne as god with the fader and holy ghoost amen / The second orison that the
priest says in his percepcion is this Percepcio corporis tui etc^ / and may be
the understanding of this oryson such Ihesu christ that parfyte life have in
heaven / with heart I the pray that the sweet percepcyon of thy precious body
which by Ialousye of love I do take be to me eschewyng of dampnacion / and
that by thy compassion hit may be compunccion to my soul / that in such place
he may come where he may be accepted and granted amen / After the priest
medytyng and thynkyng on the passion of our lord Ihesu christ says / Panem
celestem accipiam / and nomen domini Inuocabo etc^ / That is to say / I shall
take the heavenly breed / and I shall call the name of our Lord / After al these
forsaid things the priest holdyng the precious body of our lord says three
times / Domine non sum dignus vt Incres sub tectum meum / sed tantum dic verbo
and sanabitur anima mea / It is as much for to say / Lord I am not worthy
that thou entrest my hows / but say thou the word and my soul shall be heelyd
/ and there the priest beteth at every time his breast betokenyng that with
right very contrycyon and in steadfast devotion / he will receive his salvation
/ After the priest making the sign of the cross of the body of our lord says
/ Corpus domini nostri Ihesu cristi custodiat animam meam in vitam eternam etc^
It is none other thing to say / The precious body of our lord Ihesu christ will
keep my soul in life pardurable or everlasting / that is to wete in the
company of our lord / and sithe the priest with joined hands takes the body
of our lord and uses it the most deuoutelye he can / after the priest
enclyneth him self and takes the chalys wherein is the precious blood of our
lord and says / Quid retribuam domino pro omnibus que retribuit michi /
cali^em salutaris accipium / and nomen domini Inuocabo / and al nys other
thing to say / what shall I retribu^ or yield to our lord of all his
benefaytes and goods by him done and given to me after he takes the chalys
saying / ca^icem etc^ / I shall take the chalys of my health / and shall call
the name of god lawdyng him / and calling our lord I shall be delyuerd and kept
from all mine enemies / that is to wete fro all my sins and evil temptacions
of the devil After the priest making the sign of the cross says over the
chalice Sanguis domini nostri Ihesu cristi custodiat animam mea^ in vitam
eternam amen / that is to say / the precious body and blood of our lord will
keep my soul in everlasting life amen / and sithe deuoutely and reuerentelye
the priest takes the blood of Ihesu Christ / And after he draws him self to
the corner of the altar where he takes wine wetyng his fyngres over the
chalys / to the entente that no thing ne may remain of that precious
sacrament / and that doing the priest says two orysons / the first begins
thus Quod ore sumpsimus domine etc^ / that is to say / Lord this that we have
taken with mowthe / Wit that we feel it with heart / to the end hit may be
remedy to us against all temporalle and wicked thoughts / The second oryson
is / Corpus tuum quod ego Indignus etc^ / That is as much for to say / Lord I
pray the that the precious body and precious blood that I have taken as
unworthy / me will in such manner clarefye / that none ordure or fylthe / ne no
fawte may remain or abide within me / after these two orysons fynysshed that
are before said / the priest enclyneth him and renders graces to god / saying
/ Agimus tibi gr^cias etc^ / that is to say thus / Lord that art reygnyng in
heaven We render and yield to the graces and lawdynges of al thy benefaytes
received of us / After he wessheth his hands at the pyscyne or lauer for this
yt no thing of the sacrament ne may abide at his hands / and therefore that
water there ought to be cast in the pyscyne or in to sum clean place where
men may not trede on it / and it is to wete that the priest wessheth his hands
three times at mass / that is to Wete / at the beginning of hit / the second at
mids of the mass / that is to wete at offering / and the last is after the
percepcyon of the mass / And this purgemente or wasshyng may sygnefye the
purete and clennesse that the priest ought to have / In heart by good
thoughts / in mowthe by good and / honest spekyng / and in his needs or
business to work trewely and well / And after the priest says the
postcommunyon / which is so named postcommunyon / For this that it is said
after the priest has received the precious sacrament of the altar / And that
sygnefyeth the joy that our lord gave to his dyscyples / For the appostles and
dyscyples of god had great joy of the holy resurrexyon / whereof it is said in
the holy euangylle / Gauisi sunt discipuli viso domino etc^ / that as much is
to say / the dyscyples of god be feign and glad by cause they have seen our
lord / After the percepcion the priest kysseth the altar / in betokenyng that
in very love / he assenteth and consents to believe fermelye all the mysterye
of that precious sacrament / and right there he retourneth him self and
salueth the people / saying Dominus vobiscum / to the end that the people be
Incyted to make devout oryson / and therefore he says Oremus / and there the
priest says as many orysons as he said at the beginning of the mass / and for
that same cause / betokenyng that in all good work / oryson ought to be
beginning / myddel and end of hit / And at the end of these orysons the
priest concludes saying / Per dominum nostrum etc^ / In betokenyng that this
that we ask is in the sweet name of our lord / reygnyng with the fader and
with the holy ghoost / and there the people answers amen / After the priest
kysseth yet ageyn the altar / and sythen retourneth him and salueth the people
saying / Dominus vobiscum / and these two last salutes may represente and
sygnefye this that our lord after his resurrexyon salued his appostles two
times / saying thus Pax vobis / and iterum pax vobis / pees be with you by
unity of great love / and yet ageyn pees be with you sweet and good in the
glory and bliss of paradyse / After al these orysons beforesayd / ensoweth
Ite missa est / and here is to wete that the mass fynyssheth in three manners /
first the mass fynyssheth by Ite missa est / and that is at all times that
Gloria in excelcis is said / and the understanding may be such saying /
creature goo after our lord / and ensyewe him by good werkys / It may be said
also / that this Ite missa est / betokens this that when the aungel had
anounced the shepherdes the joy and myrthe of the holy natyuyte of our lord
Ihesu christ / they went to the place where our lord Ihesu christ was / right
even so as they had understand Ite missa est / goo ye / for our lord is sent
for your redemption / and therefore the shepherdes regracyed and lawded god With
al their virtue and force / and therefore the people answers and says deo
gracias / that is to say / god be lawded and regracyed of it / Secondly the
mass fynyssheth by benedicamus domino / Right so as the priest would say /
bless we god of al his goods and with heart lawde and preyse we him / and
upon this the people answers deo gracias / god be gracyed and thanked /
Thyrdly the mass fynyssheth with requiescant in pace / and that is at a mass
said for the deed / to the end that the sowles for whom the priest has said
the mass may have rest in life pardurable / and therefore the people answers
amen / that is to say thy prayer be herd and enhaunced / after that the priest
blessyth the people / the which blessyng may sygnefye this that the holy ghoost
was sent to the appostles for the promise of god that he had done to them
saying / Accepietis virtutem spiritus sancti venientis in vos etc^ / That is to
say / ye shall take the virtue of the holy ghoost coming in you / and by cause
that the holy / ghoost was sent by the trynyte / Therefore makes the priest
that same blessyng in the name of the fader / of the sone and of the holy
ghoost Secondly that blessyng whereof our lord spekyth to his appostles and
says / Venite benedicti patris mei percipite regnum etc^ / that is to say come
after me the blessed of god my fader and take the possessyon of my royalme /
Thyrdly the said blessyng may sygnefye / that blessyng that our lord made when
he would ascend unto heaven / to the end that by devout oryson he may ascend
after him in to the bliss of paradyse / and therefore he sone enclyneth him
self and says an oryson that thus begins / Placeat tibi sancta trinitas /
That is as much for to say

Holy trynyte I pray you that ye vouchesauf to take this holy sacrefyse
acceptable for me and also for them for whom I have consecrate the body of
our lerd Per xpristum dominum nostrum amen / and here is the end of the mass
/ but sum preestys while they take fro them the vestementes they say saint
Iohans gospel / and sum say the office of our lady / Saint Iohans gospel is
said for (...) mysterye in hit conteynyng / for in (...) tenor of it saint
Johan makes me^cyon / how our humanyte was ioyne^ and united to the dyuynyte /
and how he was sent for to be testymonage or witness of the deuyne light / of
the which light al creatures was enlumyned / after the priest says his graces
lawdyng and thankyng god of all his benefaytes / Who someuer will know and
understand well and parfytely the noble virtue and noble mysterye that in the
exposycnon of the mass is / let him well consydere and enprynte right
parfytelye within his heart all tho things that here beforne are contained /
and the creature thus doing shall mow have certain knowledge of god / and shall
mow ordeyne and dress his conscience / after that before is said / and so we
pray god that he give to us grace to do such service and so good prayers
that we therwyth may acquyre and get the holy bliss of paradyse AMEN /

Here ends the noble historye of the exposicion of the mass
