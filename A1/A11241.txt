To the Readers,
HEre I present you with this little Novel (courteous Readers) which though in
it self it be nothing, yet helped by a favorable construction, and applied to
the right use of such toies, may prove something, though of small moment,
whether it be worth the reading or no, I must leave to your censures after the
perusal: yet thus much let me hearten you forward to view it over, as a
travailer, having but a little way to go, though it be none of the best,
comforts himself with the soon coming to the end, so, if when you begin to
read, you find not those flowers of art, and excellencies of discourse, that
you may find in others of the same nature, yet consider it is but short, and
with these thoughts you shall find an end, before you think of weariness. Take
it therefore as the first Fruits of his brains, that if this please, will be
more industrious to content you.

Yours, as you like him, I. S.

To the Reader.
REad over this little book, and in it see,
What pains the Author has bestowed for thee
And thy delight, for it is alone compiled
For virtues luster, and not meanly styled
For if all Poets which this land does yield,
Could bring Mars armed in a bloody field,
Or paint the violence of the waters king,
Or with blind Cupid in his Courts thus sing,
This land (as erst the Italian bounds) mighe be
Famed for the nursing of true Poetry.
H. I.

Upon the AVTHOR and his Work.
Worthy I call you, for I find you so,
Reveiwing this your work, many may know,
And soon conjecture of thy industry,
Both wit, and learning, and thy Poetry.
But there are many, who are subject still,
Invectively to talk even what they will.
And now of late, I Have known a silly drudge,
Offer to censure, wanting wit to judge.
But go you forward in what you intend,
There Is many will detract, but few can mend.
This is the first, I Will wonder at the sequel,
If you proceed, there is few will be your equal.
It Is so complete compact in every thing,
That it must needs praise to the author bring.
Yours, and a true favourer of learning and virtue. I. P.

CLJDAMAS, OR THE SICILJAN TALE.
THere dwelt in the Isle of Sicily, an old Gentleman, reverent for his years,
wise in Counsel, virtuous in life, and rich in possessions, named Clidamas,
yet was not fortune so much his friend in giving him wealth, as nature in
enriching him with two Daughters, the elder whereof was named Calanthia, and
the younger Florella.

Not far from the dwelling of old Clidamas, there lived two young Gentlemen,
not brothers by birth, yet as much or more then brothers by affection, the
elder named Cleanthes, and the younger Polidore; equal they were in all things
save in age, of equal height, of equal wit, of equal beauty, of equal
strength; their valor such, that Cleanthes never found a match for himself
before he tried Polidore, neither could Polidore be ever paralleled by any
other then Cleanthes: often had they tried their forces against strangers, and as
often had they come off to their adversaries disgrace, and their own glory; often
had they tried their own strengths together, and as often given over without any
disadvantage on either side: so that perceiving neither to be the better, they
gave over further proofs, and concluded, that since neither could brag of
others overthrow, they would from thence forth perticipate of each others
honors.

In this sort long they lived, haunting all places where honor was to be
purchased, and where ever they came, doing such admirable deeds of arms, that
their fame spead it self, not only over Sicily, but also over the greatest
part of Greece and Italy, so that Cleanthes and Polidore were generally reputed
the only Chevaliers in those parts.

Long it was ere these famous Martialists (not yet weaned from the sweates of
warlike honors) tasted the bitter-sweets of Cupids Artillery, till it fortuned
that Callanthia and Florella (who were as famous for beauty as they for valor)
passed by their Castle, when both at one instant saw them, both at one instant
liked them, both at one instant loved them, both at one instant protested they
were Goddesses, both at one instant vowed to enjoy them; both at one instant
were about to run out of the Castle and seize on them, and yet both at one
instant accounting it a dishonor to offer violence to weak women, and wisely
pondering the danger that might arise thereof, desisted from such an
enterprise; yet still continued they gazing, extolling above measure the
excellency of their faces, and the sparkling luster of their radient eyes,
calling them (by overstrain'd hyperboles) Stars, Suns, Angels, or indeed
any thing that love-sicke imagination fancieth, till by their continued motion
their eyes were denied the sight of their faces; but then fell they to admiring
of their back-parts, praising (beyound measure) the decency of their garments,
setting down for an absolute conclusion, that never could garments be so
extraordinarily well fashioned, unless an extraordinary excellent mould were
under them, thus by things seen, they gathered the perfection of things not
seen, making their eyes bear them company till they were quite out of sight.

But then their eyes being robbed of their felicity, imagination fell harder
to work; yet in all this time did neither take heed to the others passions,
each were so busied in his own particular contemplation, so being both weary
of eithers company (it being the nature of love to affect loneliness) they
agreed without any motion made to either, to depart asunder, yet remembering
their ancient friendship, they were once about to return to take leave of one
another, but the remembrance of their new love drowned this part of good
manners, yet did each marvel at the others strangeness, and still imputed
the cause to himself, determining when occasion should serve to find an
excuse, which took away all cause of debate between them, neither dreaming
that the other was taken as well as himself, but either steadfastly persuaded
that himself was the only aim of Cupids archery, in these imaginations
either departed from the other to their private Chambers.

Twice had the Sun run his diurnall race, and still these lovers continued
in their solitariness, not talking at meat as they were wont to do aforetime,
but both would fit silent and still, thinking more of the beauty of their
mistrisses, then either of meat or table-talke, yet remembering themselves they
would sometimes cast forth a stealing look, to spy whether the one perceived
the others manner of carriage, when if these their stolen glaunces happened to be
at one instant (as sometimes they were,) Cleanthes would blush, as a shamed to
be seen by Polidore, and Polidore would change color, as loath to have his
passion noted by his dear Cleanthes.

At length solitariness (to which they had not formerly been used) grew
wearisome to them, and either desired to make his friend pertaker of his secret
thoughts; in this Sympathy of affection, one day, when the Sun was descending
to his western habitation, they grew more familiar, and after some unncessary
chat, they resolved to walk into the fresh air of the fragrent fields, to
which they had now these two days been strangers; a long time for them that
had been brought up abroad in the fields, and taught to rouse the savage lion
from his den, and to follow deeds of arms, and not to spend their time within
doors, in a private chamber crossing their arms, and crying heyho to see the
strangeness of loves labyrinths.

Not far from this castle, there was a spacious and thick wood, so
frequently beset with aged oaks, and straight upreared pines, as if Lady
Nature had intended to make that place as a common arbor for the neighboring
region; and so indeed it was used, for thither resorted the chiefest persons
of the land, women and lovers to hear the ravished Philomel lament the cruelty
of her false brother in law, others (that were not lovers) came thither to hunt
the fearful stagge or brisling bore; the ground of the wood was strowed with
the richest of natures tapistery, there grew the sweetbrier, and the white
rose, the dazy, the yellow cowslip, the honisuckle, and the lovely violet, of
which fair Ladies use to make themselves sweet garlands, thither it was that
Callanthia and Florella were walking, when these two friends first happened to
see them, and thither they themselves were now going, as if love had guided
them to that place of purpose, to make it more famous by being private to the
loves of so true a pair.

With one consent they walked on till they came to a thicket of pine trees,
whose overgrowne tops were so thickly spread, and so interchangably entangled
each in other, that they made a most solitary shade, utterly denying the
tell-tale Phoebus any prospect to the place, that else would be too familiar in
love^s secrets; this place they thought the fittest for their purpose, and
therefore sitting both down upon the grass, they remained a good while
silent, as desiring one should know the others secrets, and yet either loath to
disclose his secrets, because they were love; Thus long they sat, till at the
last Cleanthes trusting to the gentleness of Polydore, thus began.

If what I speak, sound harsh in thine ears, or if when I have told thee my
greifes, thou intendest to reproove my folly, as I know thou will, I pray thee
Polidore do it gently, and remember (I beseech thee) that howsoever faulty,
yet I am thy friend, trust me (my Polidore) had not fate, unevitable fate, laid
this mischance upon me, I think I had been still as free as thou.

Soon was Polydore wrought to be kind to Cleanthes, because he made no
question but that he should have need of the same from him, and (therefore
with a forced smile) he told him, he should find a kind tutor of him, and so
bad him proceed; which he, (after a volly of sighs) thus did.

I know not Polidore, whether ever thou have heard tell of a Diety (unknown I
must confess to soldiers, and therefore I think not known to thee) called
Love, for mine own part, I have often heard tell of him, but never gave credit
to the report, but always imagined it to be the idle imagination of a
frantic brain, till of late I think, himself, knowing himself despised,
is come to revenge himself on me for so neglecting him, for my Polydore (and
then he blushed) not long since it was my chance leaning out of the castle
window, to behold two gentlewomen exceeding beautiful both, especially one,
whose eyes (me thought) shot fiery arrows at my heart and wounded it, so that
from that time thy poor Cleanthes, has been in such an agony of distress,
that I hope thy heart (dear Polidore) will never feel the like, whether she
were a human creature, or a celestial goddess come of purpose to delude me
I know not, for since I never saw her; imagine my dear Polidore, but alas to
what purpose? for thou can never immagine what continual fires, what
perpetual frosts, what everlasting tortures, harbor in a lovers breast, thou
can not Polydore, no, thou can not amongst all the legends of afflicting
torments find out one to parallel a lovers anguish, thou will tell me of
Ixions wheel, alas, that is a rest to the perpetual circumvolutions in a
lovers heart, thou will tell me of Prometheus vulture, alas, what vulture can
gnaw so fiercely as the griffin care does on my poor heart (for I am now a
lover) thou will tell me of the fifty daughters of false Danaus and their
bottomless tubs, alas what are they to the bottomless pit of my affections,
which a whole sea of fancies cannot fill; I expect now that thou should
chide me, but thy word is past, and thou have rather cause to pity me;
howsoever if thou be angry with me (as thou have cause enough) I prithee
keep thy word, and chide me gently, else thou will add more to a soul that
is already pressed with two heavy a burden.

Glad was Polydore when he heard him name love, yet that joy was not lasting,
for he imagined, his friend had perceived some thing by him, and therefore
might use this as a way to sound him, but perceiving by the continuance of his
speech, that what he spoke, he spoke heartily; a new fear possessed him, who
this gentlewoman should be, extremely fearing it should be his mistress,
thinking (as every lover does) that she was the only woman in the world,
worthy to be loved; yet some what glad that his friend Cleanthes was caught as
well as himself, he made this reply.

Is it possible that Cleanthes should be entangled in loves net? can it be
that he should be hit with Cupids bird bolt? nay, then I see it is no shame
for such fools as I to love, when so wise a man as Cleanthes is overtaken,
think not I speak this in derision friend, for heaven knows, and my
conscience knows, that Polydore feels as much torture for love, as Cleanthes
possibly can; only in this I am happy, that having so good a president, I
need not be ashamed to love, nor afraid of rebuke from you, that are caught in
the same ginne: Trust me Cleanthes, Cupid was politic in this for had he
smote one only, surely your strong persuasions and enforcing arguments, would
have so much prevailed, that I should have shaken off all thoughts of love, and
rather have smothered my affection, though it might have cost me the hazard of
my life, then have entertained any thing that might have been distastefull to
Cleanthes, and by mine own thoughts I measure thine, but now since we are both
so stricken, that the one cannot rebuke the other, unless he will of necessity
blame himself, let us in stead of chiding, cherish one another, and with our
best endeavors aid each other, in the attaining, of our desires; it could not
choose but exceedingly glad Cleanthes to hear with what a congruity, love had
endued both their affections; but then the same fear came upon him that had
before invaded Polydore, least perchance, his friend should be in love with
his mistress, but that fear soon after vanished too, for by sundry
inquiries, and diverse marks, which either had imprinted in their memory, they
truly perceived that Callanthia was Cleanthes his mistress, and Florella
Polydores; so that not knowing now, why either should be offended at other, or
have any cause to grieve, if so be their mistresses would prove gratio^s, they
resolved that, to put that in trial, was their next task, in which they were
mutually to aid one another, and in this resolution, they left the wood, and
went home to their castle.

Long it was not, ere they learned who, and what their sweethearts were,
whereupon they grew into acquaintance with old Clydamas, which was not hard for
them to do, they being men of so great note, and he a man of so affable a
nature, that he willingly entertained the acquaintance of any, that were
virtuously given, howsoever strangers, so that he thought himself to be highly
graced, to be familiar with two such men as Cleanthes and Polydore: and they
thought themselves no less happy, in being entertained into the friendship of
Clydamas.

Thus past they some time only in mutual hospitality, without any speech of
love on either side, till on a time Clydamas inviting them home to his house to
a banquet, after the feast was ended, he had them into a goodly garden
inbroidered with the chiefest of Floras jewels, in the midst whereof, was a
most curious arbor of sweetbrier, into which leading the two friends, and
seating them on either side himself, he thus spoke unto them.

Gentlemen, before I was acquainted with you, and knew you only by report, I
loved you, esteeming you to be men worthy to be beloved, but since growing into
more familiarity with you, that love is so much more nicreased, by how much the
more my knowledge of you is bettered: I love not to flatter, neither would I
have you to grow proud at my speeches, (and therewith he smiled,) but this I
will boldly say, that if the gods would promise to give me two sons, endued
with such qualities as I would wish the^, you should be ye patterns, that I
would set the gods to work by; did I want valiant men to defend my just cause,
I would send the whole world over to find out you; did I want boon companio^s
to pass away the time with, I would pick out you; did I want a friend to
entrust my secrets with, it should be one of you: you may wonder perhaps, to
what end tends this preamble, why trust me worthy friends, to such an end that
if it hit with your humors, (as I would wish it) it may be to the good of us
all.

I cannot tell whether you have heard reported, how in former times, the gods
had blessed me with a pair of sons, whom I cannot praise, because it was my
hard fortune to loose them, before either themselves could tell what honor
meant, or I, or indeed any man tell, to what end the fates had reserved them,
yet was their expectation great with all men: for being but nine years old,
they gave forth such evident signs of a hopeful valor, that it amazed
strangers, and joyed me exceedingly, to hear how they were generally praised,
even in their childish exercises; but now begins the tragedy (and with that the
tears trickled down his fair white beard) for as they were playing together
on the Seashore, certain Sea-rovers espying them, took them and forcibly
carried them abourd their gally, presently hoisting up their sails and getting
away, maugre all our endeavors, who presently made after them with what speed
we might, but to no purpose, for they laboring with sail and oar, so far
outstripped us that it was impossible for us to overtake them, and therefore
seeing that we labored in vain, with sorrowful hearts we turned back
again, leaving my dear children behind, of whom since then I never heard any
tidings; This sorrow coming to the mothers ear, who was then great with child
and near her time, it so wrought on her, that she presently fell in travile,
and in travile died, yet did she leave (to comfort my old age) these two
daughters whom you know, and indeed they have been hitherto a comfort to me,
I will not say too much of them, because they are mine own: yet thus much I
may say, that they are virtuous, and since the gods have bereft me of my
sons, I suppose they have in some sort made me a recompense, in bestowing on
me such daughters, as may by their fortunate marriages enrich me with two
noble sons in law, and those I have determined to be you, if you can like of
them, or if your affections be not settled otherwhere; think them not the worse
because they are proffered, but think rather, that it is a sure presage of a
following good, to have a full assent on all parts, for how ever I give you my
consent, yet do I limit it to your and their liking; for I will not be the
maker of inforst matches; therefore if you have heretofore, or do now newly,
entertain any liking to my daughters, here you have my consent, as esteeming
you worthy sons in law, whom I have found to be such worthy friends; on
therefore freely, and if you like them, woe them, for mine own part, now I
have given you thus much way, I will be neither a hindrance, nor a furtherer to
your attempts, but either betake himself to his best cunning.

You may imagine, it was some comfort to the poor lovers to have such a way
laid open to them, for well they knew that it was requisite to get the fathers
good will, if they would have the match pleasing and fortunate, therefore
without any further circumstances, Cleanthes in the name of himself, and his
friend Polidore thus spoke.

For the love worthy sir which you have had to us, we are rather to thank
your goodness, then any deserts in our selves, your age being more apt to
fancy where you find the least occasion of liking, then our youth able to
merit any thing to make you fancy us, howsoever we are the more bound to you,
for enriching us with your love, that have no title to lay claim to it by. Of
the unhappy loss of your hopeful sons, some glimmering of knowledge we have
had heretofore, but never the truth till now from your self, in which you have
related such a continued race of sorrow, knit up with so admirable a period of
joy, that if your report urged tears from us, your conclusion was of
sufficiency to dry them; the loss of your sons was much, the loss of your
wife much, and indeed I know not which we should esteem the greater loss,
but for these two losses, the Gods have returned you a large recompense, four
for three, two daughters (whom I know not whether the earth can parallel) for
one wife, which (besides their own inherent excellencyes) bring with them two
husbands, which though they cannot equal your own children, yet may they in
some sort bring a comfort to your aged years. Now since it has pleased you,
to nominate us two for your sons in law, we should be much ingrate in
refusing so goodly a profer, and much more then vain, to deny that, because
it is offered, for which we would give whole worlds (were they ours) for the
purchase, for believe me sir, no sooner did our eyes behold your beauteous
daughters, but our hearts loved the^, determining for certain either to have
them, or to die for them; how happy then may you imagine we esteem our
selves, when you that are the wakefull dragon to guard these golden apples,
shut your eyes while we two Herculesses come to rob your orchard, or rather
not shut your eyes, but look on us with delight; encouraging us on with such
persuasions, as would make a coward valient in the wars of Love, having no
enemy to war against him, save a gracious Virgin, and knowing besides that
she cannot be hard hearted, coming of so kind a father. To answer you
therefore with what a sympathy our affection meet, you cannot be so willing to
have us your sons, as we (if your fair daughters be but gracious as I hope
they will) are desirous to call you father.

What Cleanthes had uttered in words, Polydore failed not to testify for
himself, by the pleasing gesture of his countenance, which the good old man
perceiving, it did so wrap him in joy, that the tears ran trickling down
his white beard, his overgladded heart not being able to contain in it self
so sudden an ecstasy of joy, at so great a felicity (as he esteemed it) to
have Cleanthes and Polydore for his sons in law, which they taking for a sure
presage of a fortunate event, it made them sympathize with him in delight,
though their eyes did not testify it with such tears of joy as his did, their
youthful fire being better able to dry up those floods of overflowing passion
then the frost of age; wherefore without more a do, they desired him only to
aid them thus far, as to help them to the speech of the maids, and they did
not doubt of a happy success, which he willingly agreeing unto, promised to
perform accordingly. But because it was then to late, the sun being almost
gone to hide himself in the boosome of Tethis, he invited them to a course
supper and a hard bed (as he termed it) and there for that night the lovers
took up their Inn.

All supper time did they sit gazing on their mistresses, feeding on their eyes
more then on the Cates that was before them, that it was a meriment to old
Clidamas to see them so attentive, and to hear them answer so impertinently to
every question he asked of them, yet would he find out pleasant discourse to
beguile the time, and thus supper was passed over; after with music and
dancing, and other delightful pleasures, they wore away the hours till bed
time, and then lights being brought they were conducted to their chambers.
Feign would the youths have been practicing their skill in Venus warfare, but
the company of guests then present denied them opportunity, therefore awaiting
for a fitter hour, they betook them to their lodging; for rest I cannot call
it, their minds being so distracted between joy and fear; joy for the fathers
willingness, fear for the daughters mislike if it should happen; that they
debard their eyes from the least slumber, yet was the fancy of joy the
stronger, as having the surer ground, which so filled their heads with pleasing
immaginations, that themselves I think (had they been asked the question)
could not have recounted them.

The burning hoofes of Apollowes firce-breathing steeds, had not as yet
attained the lower pavement of the vaulted hemisphere, and rosy fingerd Aurora
had but newly strewed the way for the King of lights, when the two lovers
(weary of their restless beds) perceiving the mornings blush through the
chamber window, arose, and apparrelling themselves went down to receive the
fresh mornings air in the garden; but all their earliness could not
outstrippe the wakefull Clydamas, who was the continual morning cock to the
whole house, who seeing the two lovers coming toward him, with a merry
countenance gave them the bonjour thus.

So early up, nay then I see, you will be sure speeders that are so early
risers; See, how the sun comes stealing over yon hill, dying his cheeks with
blushes as ashamd to be outstript by mortals; Rather he teaches us (said
Polydore) to blush for suffering our selves to be surpast by you, that should
rather be at rest, then thus abroad so soon before the day, young bloods may
better endure watching then weak age: Indeed (said Clydamas young men that
have the same watchbel that you have, can worse endure their beds then others
that want it, and commenly where there is a lover in the house there needs no
other cock to call up the rest, but otherwise youth loves their ease, and to
nourish themselves with a morning nap, when old men rather desire to feed (as
it were) on the fresh air without doors; yet the case goes ill of our sides
(says Cleanthes) for though we have the watchbell which you talk of, yet
either it went false, or we minded it not, for me thinks for all our larum,
you are got up before us.

With such like pleasing conference they passed on the time till Clydamas
perceived his daughters were come into the garden, whereupon taking the two
friends by the hands he thus encouraged them: Yonder is the game, and you are
skillful huntsmen, upon them then, and if you miss them, blame not me for
negligence, but your selves for slothfulness, that had the game in view, and
yet lost it: and therewith he parted from them.

Who then had looked on the lovers, might have perceived a maidenly blush
overspread their cheeks, as afraid of themselves having never been trained in
Cupids military discipline, yet gathering their spirits together, and arming
themselves with their greatest resolution, they approached nigh and taking them
by the hands kindly gave them the good morrow, which they with a modest blush
returned. Whereupon Cleanthes taking his fair Calanthia by the hand, whilst
Polydore did the like to his dear Florella thus accosted her.

If what I speak (beauteous Calanthia) be not so powdered with art, as may
befit the tender tympane of a Ladies ear, impute it to the fault of war, that
teaches her scholars no better language: yet thus much may my simpleness in
that kind gain me, that wanting color to daube my meaning over with, my
truth will appear the more naked and clear. I love thee dear Callanthia; nay
start not sweet, love is not such a bugbeare to affright a Lady with, time was
when I my self would have laughed at the name of Cupid, as if he had been as
lame as he is blind: but since, his piercing shaft has made so large a wound,
that I fear it never will be healed, unless you prove the gracious physician
and cure me; It was the wisdom of the gods (divine Calanthia) to make man and
woman, so framing them, that it is almost impossible for them to live asunder;
for if either had been made alone, how should the spacious fabric of the
world have been supplied with inhabitants? or if when both had been made,
they might have lived asunder, to what end had served man's affibility? or those
excellencies that are in women? they ordained therefore that man and woman
should be joined together, that man's natural harshnesse might be molified
with woman's tenderness, and woman's weakness might be upheld by man's
strength. Now since this is the pleasure of the gods, (my dear) be not you
displeasing to them, by obstinate refusing to submit your self to their
decree: but agree to be my woman, and I (more then willingly) will consent to
be thy man, give me thy love as freely, as I ask it honestly, for far from
me, be the thought of villainy; I know it is the fashion of maidens to be coy,
and hard to be won at first, and some fools I know there are, that esteem
a woman light if she be won at the first onset, but trust me Calanthia, I am
of another opinion, for never could a thousand years of growth, nourish a
truer love in any lovers breast, then a minutes sight has bred in mine: for no
sooner did your eyes sparkle on mine, but from those eyes of yours, Cupid let
fly his golden headed arrow at my heart, and why then may not a minutes talk,
breed as true a love as a minutes sight: delay not then my dear Calanthia, but
yield thy self without any further circumstance, for by thy love, (which is an
oath that I would sooner die then break) I shall account thee more wise and
constant, as wanting those arts which cunning women have, by fained refusalls
to draw poor besotted youths into a fools paradise, my request is fair and
honest, thy gracious love, to be consummated by a happy marriage. And
therewith he ceased, griping her fair hand within his so hard, as if he would
have her feel his meaning as well as hear it.

But the excellent Calanthia (who was as fair as any that the sun ere looked
on, and yet more gracious then fair, and as wise as gracious) after a little
musing made him an answer thus.

Worthy Sir, if war teach her Scholars no worse language then she has
taught you, she need not be ashamed of them; for believe me sir, (and let
these blushes testify for me) I know not how, but your words have so wrought
with me, that I never felt the like passions in my self, as I do at this
time, if you deceive me be it on your own head, I am the silly fish easily
caught with a fair bait, I must confess I could have held off longer, and
would have done, (though I imagine what torments I should have undergone) but
your protestations have so far prevailed with me, that you see how easily I
am won to yield you up the fort of my chaste love, almost without the least
battery; which if it be a fault; (as I know not how you may esteem it,) blame
your own tongue for having so much power to overcome me.

Blessed be my tongue said Cleanthes, for having so much power, and blessed be
love for making thy heart so pliable; but more then blessed be thy dear self,
(excellent Calanthia) for enriching me with so excellent and enstimable a
treasure as thy love; when I am false or once think a thought of deceiving
thee, may all the plagues of love and jealousy light on this heart, and never
be removed. O happy presage of a most fortunate end, in so blessed a beginning;
what man can have more cause of joy then Cleanthes, when he shall fold in his
arms so delicate a bride as is Callanthia; for ever will I consecrate this day
to pleasure, and the sprightly Cupid, dull bloody war, when did I ever feel
such an ecstasy of joy in all thy service, when I came home laden with the
spoils of foes, crowned with tryumphant bays, and all the soldiers crying
out Cleanthes, the mortal Mars that leads victory bound in an iron chain,
that she dares not but attend on him, victory, victory to the great Cleanthes;
yet have I rid one drowsy and dull, no more stird with these glorious
acclamations, then if they had not belonged to me; yet here for the glory of
one cumbate in the field of Love, my heart dances to the music of Callanthias
voice, chaunt on my dear Callanthia and never give over, that my poor heart
may never give over dancing.

Callanthia seeing into what an extremity of joy imagination had led him,
thought to give him a kind of cooling card, and therefore spoke to this effect.

Let not my words Cleanthes make you to loose your self, for my position was
general, in regard of mine own will, yet is it not without a lemitation; you
know that besides the liberty of my free will, I have the obedience of a child
imposed on me, and believe me, that howsoever I fare (as indeed I think I
shall not live without you) his will shall be the limits of my affection,
beyond which I will on no terms wander; get therefore his goodwill and you
have mine.

This was so far from abating any thing of Celanthes his joy, that it
augmented it rather, which he was about to utter, and tell her that he had her
fathers good will already, but that Clidamas (who all this while hard all their
talk) perceiving already that Polydore had wrought his Lady Florella to the
same point, stepped out, and put them together with these or the like
benidictions.

If my good will be the only stop, here I remove that let gentleman, here I
give you my daughters, and may the Gods bless this fair conjunction, may you
live long and happy together, may the children which the Gods will bestow on
you, grow up to a greater perfection of virtue then their parents, and when the
fates shall cut your threads of life, may ye have the fortune of Philemon and
Baucis, to end all your lives in one period of time. To which the lovely
couples said Amen.

The next care was in providing necessary things for the wedding, and
appointing the day, which for the convenient decency of the celebration, was
deferred till a month after: till when let us leave them, and in the mean go
a while to sea, to hear (if we can) some tidings of Martuvio and Roderigo, the
lost sons of old Clydamas who as you heard himself report it, were stolen
away in their childhood by sea rovers; but before we enter into the discourse
of their fortunes, it is requisite that we look into the passage of an age, or
two before.

Upon the sea coast of Barbary, there stands an ancient and renowned city,
generally known to Merchants, called Tunis, in which sometime their reigned a
King (or a tyrant rather) named Mariabdela: This monster (for so we may call
him more justly then a man) not content to wallow, and glut himself in such
sins as might have some excuse, or agreed something with the course of nature,
went on yet further, letting loose the reins to his voluptuous appetite,
jesting at the majesty of the Gods, and thinking them to be idle fictions of
witles heads, to make fools afraid of doing that, which might content their
sensuality.

So far proceeded his enormous wickedness, as to the deflowring of his own
daughter, a maiden so exceedingly beautiful, and so excellently virtuous, that
she seemed as a fair rose sprung from a crooked brier; yet neither her
excellent beauty, (which would have molified a tiger) nor her admirable virtues
(which would have moved any but a devil) could purchase any remorse in this
hellish tyrant; thrice did she conjure him by the name of father, to desist
from so unhumaine a villainy, and yet thrice did the feind reject the name of
father and would not hear; thrice did she provoke him by the pains of her
careful mother, that he would not let those many labors employed to bring her
up virtuously, to perish and come to nothing by his beastliness, and yet
thrice did the barbarous wretch withstand those exccellent provocations;
because they would persuade him from his beastliness: thrice did she stir
him by the sense of manhood, telling him how unmanly it was to offer violence
to a tender virgin, much more for a father to offer villainy to his own child,
and yet thrice did he refuse these motions, setting more by the fruition of his
incestuous lust, then by the credit of manhood, so that (perforce) taking her
in his arms he carried her into his chamber, whilst she poor soul with
bitter cries, and many a brine-salt tear, implored aid from the Gods; but all
in vain, for the insatiate devil having her there in his power, villanously
ravished her; but then his lustful liking turned to a mortal hate, loathing
the person but not the fact, so that throwing off all pity of a man, as before
he had done of a father, he drew his sword, and while the sweet angellike
creature sat bewailing her lost honor, the cruel devil most unhumainely
murdered her, and commanding presently to raise a rumor of her sudden
death, in most pompious manner he solemnized her funeral, where the
dissembling crocadile shed such a multitude of false tears, that he made the
most hearts present to condole with him, his infinite loss in so precious a
daughter.

Yet could not all his cunning clooke his wickedness from the all-seeing eyes
of the divine powers, for though he escaped corporal plagues, yet was his
mind so distracted with hideous thoughts, and the everlasting gripes of a
guilty conscience, as if a thousand devils had taken up their habitation in
his bosom, nor could the comfort of sleep any thing benefit him, for no
sooner were his eyes closed, but his imagination presented him with ghastly
visions and horred dreams; amongst the rest, one night he dreamt that he saw
his daughter coming toward him with her hair disheveled about her ears, and
her eyes flaming like fire, in her hand a burning whip, with which she lasht
him in most cruel manner, with horror whereof crying out amain, spare me
Carapresa he waked; and yet still was his imagination so thoroughly possessed with
terror of those burning lashes, that he ran about the chamber like a mad
man, crying continually on Carapresa to hold her hands, which the guard (that
ordinarily watched about the chamber) hearing, they presently rushed in upon
him, and by violence held him, till being something come to himself, they left
him, and he went to bed again.

In such like tortures did he spend his time, so that growing weary of his
life, and indeed desperate, not caring what should happen to him, he gave
himself over to delights, and such pastime as were of most likelihood to drive
away such troublesome thoughts; at last (by what means I know not) it came
into his head to have a great desire to know to what end the fates had reserved
him, this fancy growing stronger and stronger, he sent two of his trustiest
servants to the oracle of Jupiter Ammon to know his destiny, who coming before
the Alter, and offering their gifts according to the custom, they received
from the oracle this answer.

The man that Tunis does command,
Shall fall by a Sicilian hand.
With this short answer they returned home again, where delivering the King
their scroule, he read it, and plainly perceiving how evidently his destiny
was figured out, he presently gave command, that all Sicilians should within a
months space, void the country on pain of death, if any were found after the
months end; he himself in the mean time walking strongly guarded, admitting
none into his company or service, until he had thoroughly examined him, what,
and of whence he was, not caring of what country they were, so they were not
Sicilians.

Besides this he sent out his galleys and other ships of war to surprise al
Sicilians, without respect of age, sex, or degree, so that by these means the
Mediteranian sea was so haunted, as no one durst venture, unless he went
extraordinarily strongly provided for the assault, for under color of
surprising Sicilians, these rovers set on all that they saw, ransacking ship
and goods, slaying some of the men, and sending the others to the shore naked
and comfortless.

One of these galleys it was, that stole away the two children as they were
playing by the sea shore, for espying them, and supposing that the King would
give them an extraordinary reward, for adventuring to fetch them out of their
country, when so largely he recompensed those that took any on the sea, they
put it to the venture, and swiftly rushing out of their gally, they carried
them away, maugre all that the inhabitants could do.

Thus with their rich booty (as they accounted it) they sailed on, being
carried with a merry gale of wind, till they came within the sight of Tunis,
but then, on a sudden the wind changed quite contrary, so that it was
impossible for them to approach to the shore, and presenly upon it, arose so
vehement a tempest, as if heaven and earth would have met together, to the
confusion of the weather beaten gally, the winds stormed, the seas roared, the
ship cracked, and the men howled for anguish, making a most confused and
hideous noise, the day grew dark, and the Sun wrapped up his face in his
clowded mantle, as loath to see the confusion of mankind, the moon and the
stars, looked gazing out of their spheres, wondering to see the cruelty of
enraged Aeolus, to the general amazement of all the distracted beholders, to
see the Moon usurp the Suns office, and the signs of midnight, when it
should be noone.

To add to the horred noise of the raging waters, sometimes were heard the
sudden crackes of furious thunderbolts, which compared with the harsh
grumbling of the turbulent sea, seemed like the discharging of some great piece
of ordinance amongst a volly of small shot. The ship in the mean time
violently tumbled up and down, by the continual agitation of the troubled
ocean, now mounted upward, as if it would never leave ascending, till it had
touched the clouds, and by and by down again, as if it would never leave
falling till it came to the lowest hell, the amazed saylors, not knowing which
way to turn them in so urgent an extremity, were enforced to commit ship,
lives, goods, and all, to the mercy of the winds and sea, therefore taking
down all their sails they lay hulling up and down, as the tempest drove,
carefully expecting a more prosperous gale; but in vain expected they any
comfort, for on the second night after the tempest began, they were set a
ground on the coast of Spain.

Who had then seen the distracted mariners, would have thought them mortal
foes, rather then combined friends, so did every one bestirre himself in this
danger, snatching out of his fellows hand that which he thought would save
himself, not caring who perished so himself escaped: amongst the rest the
young lads shifted for themselves, as well as their tender age would give them
leave, for seeing how every one provided for himself, no man regarding them,
they thought that they should do the like too, and therefore getting up into
the upper deck, (because that place was only free from water,) they remained
there till that also began to be possessed by the incroaching ocean, but then,
as it were inspired with a riper wit, which it may be the sight of the present
danger had lent them, they supposed that to stay longer in the ship, nothing
was to be expected but most certain ruin, and therefore espying a chest which
by good fortune was in the place (as they had seen others do) they threw
themselves and it into the sea, entreating Neptune to be gentle to them,
because they were but children and had never done him wrong.

It seemed that Neptune heard their prayers, for ere break of day they were
cast on shore half dead hard by Tarragona, where an old fisherman (who about
some business was come so early to the sea side) found them, and being moved
with tender commiseration of their misfortunes, he ran to them, and used
such diligence that he recovered life in them, yet long it was ere they could
call to mind how they came there, but at last remembering the ship and the
storm at sea, they asked the old man what was become of the ship; but he
perceiving them to be faint, carried them home with him, and told them that the
ship would come again one day, and till then they should dwell with him, which
they according to their childish simplicity presently conscented to.

Thus were these two children saved from the swords tyranny by the cruel mercy
of the angry sea, the other that were in the ship were either drowned, or if
they escaped to the land they fell into the hands of the inhabitants, who hated
them deadly, as being subjects to the tyrant Mariabdela.

The good old Sancho (for so was the fisherman called) perciving by diverse
questions, who and what his orphans were, regarded them the more charily,
intending when occasion should serve to carry them home again to Sicily, which
he hoped might be a means of bettering his estate, by a good recompense which
he made account to obtain, by presenting their father with so worthy a gift.

It fortuned, that about some two or three years after, the Duke of Medina
Sidonia Lord Admiral of Spain, having been upon a service to scour the Sea
of pirates, for want of water and fresh victuals, happened to put into that
haven, where coming himself ashore, he chanced to epsy Martuvio and
Roderigo as they were coming from school, when presently he took such a
liking to them that he demanded of them whose children they were, they (as they
were taught by old Sancho) made answer they were his, whereupon the Duke
commanding him to be sent for, requested him to let him have his two children,
which the good old man hearing, and glad to prefer them to so honorable a
man, (because he knew not when his own estate would be sufficient to carry
them to Sicily) willingly condesended unto, and therefore taking them aside
thus spoke unto them.

My sons (said he) for so I may justly call you, as having given you a second
life from the seas cruelty, and my care of you since that time, has been
little less then that of a father, you are old enough to entertain my
counsel, and of understanding sufficient to put it in practice, you see how
the means that the Gods have lent me is so small, that it is only sufficient
to keep us, so that I know not whether ever I shall be able, to convey you
home to your own father or no; see therefore my dear children how the Gods
have provided for you, in moving the heart of the great Duke of Medina Sidonia
to fancy you, a man mighty in power, and great in authority, under whom you may
sooner get means of transportation to your country, then by staying here with
me, go with him my boys, and I beseech the Gods to give you as many
blessings, as there are sorrows in my poor heart to part with you, were it
not that I know it is for your greater good: yet whersoever you shall go, or
howsoever the fates shall dispose of you, remember old Sancho your poor foster
father; lastly, it will not be amiss for you to entertain my counsel in this
to, whenever folks shall ask you what or whose sons you are, you may
answer, a poor fishermans on the coast of Spain, for if you be known to be
Sicilians it will go hard, but the tyrant Mariabdela of whom you have heard
tell, will work some means to get you into his clutches for the whole sea is
full of his warlike ships, and he accounts not the loss of his ships, equal
to the purchase of one Sicilian, so monstrously does he hate your nation: but
by terming your selves my children, you may go for Spaniards, and so escape the
fear of any such danger, besides going under my name, you may much benefit
me, for whosoever shall take a liking to you, cannot choose but favor the
father of such children, go one therefore on Gods name, and whatsoever become
of you, remember to show your selves to be nobly borne, rather by your
virtuous and noble acts, then by your own report.

When he made an end of his counsel he kissed their tender cheeks, the
tears standing in his eyes, as loath to part with his pretty children, and they
also crying ripe, not willing to leave their loving father; in this sort he
delivered them to the Duke, who gave him a great reward for them, which nothing
displeased the old man: Sometime they lived with the Duke at sea, till the sea
being sufficiently scoured as he thought, he returned home to Biscay, where the
two children grew up so beyond expectation in beauty, stature, and strength,
that it much delighted the good Duke to see them, their greatest delight wa^ to
bestride great horses, and when their age began to be able to endure it, they
gave themselves wholly to deeds of arms, haunting justs and tournaments, which
were something frequent, where continually they carried themselves so well,
that they still came off with honor, to the exceeding comfort of the Duke, and
admiration of all that beheld them, to see such admirable worth in so young
years.

Thus sometime they lived in this fashion of life, till it was rumord in
Biscay, that a certain Pyrat name Martoll, went roving up and down the
Levant, seizing on all the ships that came in his way, but especially on the
Spanish ships, that came from Candy, laden with wines: These tidings were
beyound measure welcome to bold Martuvio and Roderigo, as hoping now to put in
practice, what they had all this while been learning, so that no sooner had the
Duke given commandment for the providing of the gallyes to be set out against
the pirates, but they came to him, and with humble earnestnes besought him to
let them wait on him in this expedition, which he seeing their forwardness
consented to.

The winds blew fair, and all things were prepared for the purpose, whereupon
they presently went aboard, leaving the shore full of people praying for their
good success; with pleasant gaile they sailed on, till they came over against
Zante where one from the top discerned sails, and thereupon gave warning to
the men below, to make ready for the fight, for he had now evidently discried
that they were Martolls gallyes, whereupon every man fell closely to his
business, some to fitting the sails, others to raise up defense, against
their enemies, others to rear their engines of battery, wherewith they would
send whole showers of stones and arrows amongst the foes, others making ready
their grapling to lay hold of the adverse ships, if peradventure they came to
boarding, who had then seen, the two young Sicilians, would have thought they
had been going to a feast, rather then to a dismal and unusual fight; their
greatest care was to see, whether their sword were sharp enough, as for their
armor they did not so much regarded it, yet knowing by their little
experience, that it was not the least duty of a valient man, to look well to
his own defense, they provided for that too, making every thing as sure as
they might, that the enemy might not have too much advantage against them;
thus being armed in complete harness they came before the Admiral, who
seeing and praising their courage assigned them their places.

No less were the Pirates busied, for Martoll being a man of great experience,
and having been in many sea fights, knew that now he was to use an other
manner of proceeding, and a greater care then in the ordinary surprisall of a
weak Merchant, and therefore with as great care and expedition as was
possible, providing all things either for offense or defense, he encouraged his
men with these or the like speeches.

I should do you too much wrong worthy friends and fellows in arms, if I
should now doubt of your worth, that I have had so many most absolute and
apparent proofs off, only thus much I am to tell you, that that worth of
yours is now to be so much the more augmented, by how much the quality of your
now approaching foes, is far surpassing that of those, with whom you have
hitherto dealt, for they were only merchants, men of small or no force, easily
won to yield themselves to your victorious swords: but now you are to
encounter with soldiers, men inured to sea fight, and brought up all their
life time to traverse the fields of Neptune, remember that you are to fight
against Alonzo the great Admiral of Spain, who not many years since so
bestird himself, that not a rover durst peep out of the harbor; remember
that they are your borne enemies, men sworn to your destruction, and account
your selves as men sent by the Gods to whip them for their overdaring, remember
that how famous soever the enemy is, so much the more glory is it to overcome:
remember the great fight you had with Andrea Admiral of Sicily, and how many
Sicilian slaves you carried to Tunie to the great Mariabdela, are not you the
men? who when the great Navy of Malta scoured the Levant, durst range at
pleasure and board the proud foe, mangre all his might: are not you the men
that made the Candy fleet stoop to yours, whilst you ransackt them of those
excellent wines, in despite of those men of war, sent of purpose to waft them
over; are not you the men that brought the ships of Tripoli under your lee,
whilst the braggart Thebaldo governor of Rhodes for all his vaunting stood
looking on, but durst not help them? you are, you are; and I know that you are
still the men, that will add the overthrow of these haughty Spaniards to your
former victories, you have the same Martoll to be your captain that you had
then, you have the same ships that you had then, you have the same Gods to
protect you, that you had then, and you shall have the same fortune to attend
on you, that you had then; take courage then, and if the potency of your
enemies dismay you, think what a glory you shall get by overcoming of them.

The soldiers were so tickled with this speech, that casting off all thought
of fear, they began to take into their thoughts the full imagination of an
assured victory, and therefore with an unanimous consent they cried out
Victoria Victoria, which the Duke of Medina hearing, he took ocasion
thereupon to encourage his soldiers, in these or the like speeches.

Hark how yon dogs bark at the Moon, like cocks crowing on their own
dunghill, hark what account they make of our destruction, it is therefore your
parts my worthy friends and valiant soldiers, to bestirre your selves like
men, that they may have the greater overthrow, in being overcome by those men
whom they esteem already vanquished. It is not possible that these villains
can entertain the least delight, unless it be like the Swans carolling, a
sure presage of an instant ruin: consider my friends with what advantage you
war against them, you have the Gods on your sides, the winds to help you,
the shore for your safety, and Fortune for your friend, when as all these are
against them; for how can the Gods help them that are professed enemies to those
celestial Dieties, how can the winds favor them that imprison them to so bad
purpose, how can the shore yield them succor that are enemies to all men, and
how can fortune be their friend, that make so ill use of their prosperity,
these are such like men as not many years ago you vanquished on the coast of
Barbary, and it may be, they are the relikes of those dispersed fleetes, newly
gathered to a head and venturing again to sea, that they may the second time
be overcome by you; the power of a just cause is on your side, and what can be
a greater motive to whet on valor, you have honest minds and settled
resolutions, and what can be a greater rampire against the fear of
approaching danger. you have the glory of former victories in the like kind,
and what greater spur to animate resolution: you have all things necessary
and convenient for the fight, far off, or near at hand, and what more could
you wish? courage then, and what advantage honest and true men have against
thieves and robbers, the same assure your selves to be on your sides; aquit
your selves like valiant men, and hearts rather then tongues, witness to your
the selves full assurance of a happy victory.

No sooner had he made an end of speaking, but he commanded to give the
signal to the fight, which was done accordingly, and was answered with the
like from the enemies; whereupon both fleetes moved forward by the help of
their oars each bearing the sea before them, till the mounting bellows
meeting one another seemed to fight together as if they would presage whether
side should have the victory by their distraction, the Pirates had the greater
multitude, but the Spaniards had the stronger vessels, so that there was small
odds on either side, the ones multitude serving to resist the others strength,
and their strength serving as a maine bulwark to defend them from the others
multitude, now was the battle begun with whole showers of darts, arrows,
and stones, sent from either side, now began all things to be in a hurly
burly, the sails grew to be full of holes, as if they would let the wind
loose from their hollow prisons; the masts began to totter, the upper works of
the galleys began to crack, and the men began to drop down, washing the
hatches with their dearest blood, the sea began to change color, blushing to
be the supporter of such massacres, horror was figured in her proper colors,
and the fierce God of war armed himself in blood and griefly wounds: cruelty
ranged up and down the fleetes, leaving no squadron unvisited, fierce balls of
wildfire were thrown about, to set fire on the moving houses: at last, as if
they had agreed upon it, they resolved to board each other, and therefore
casting forth the grapling hooks, they fastened their ships together; but then
began as it were a new battle, for the manner of the fight, though nothing
differing from the former in cruelty, unles in that, it was more bloody and
deadly: now began they to use their swords and pikes* sometimes assailing the
others, and striveing to get into their enemies ships, sometimes defending
themselves and repulsing the others from entering into theirs, shivered pikes
flew into the air, and sword that once glistered like to polished glass now
lost their color and dyed themselves in a bloody scarlet; here might you see a
head tumbling on the floor with the tongue still moving (as it were) cursing
the sword that parted it from the beloved body; here an arm lopt off griping a
sword, as it were threatening his enemies to the death; here a helmet cleft in
two, there a target broken in pieces; so that it was a wonder to behold the
several effects of bloody war.

Amongst all this confusion the two Sicilians behaved themselves beyond wonder,
as if Mars, and his sister Bellona had assumed the shapes of youths and come to
aid the Spaniards, and not as if they had been but pupills in the feats of
chivalry, all the while before it came to boording they stood still,
encouraging on those that wrought in the engines, but no sooner were the
grapling yrons cast out, and the ships entangled together, but they leapt both
together into the Admiral of the Pirates, and in spite of all opposition, with
their swords they laid about them lustily, quickly scouring the hatches and
making a way for others to follow them: which Martoll seeing, perceiving that
now or never he was to use his uttermost valor, like a chafed bore, he leapt
to him that was next him, which happened to be Martuvio, who feeling such
weighty blows fall so thick on his helmet, he bethought himself, that such
wares were not to be hoorded up without repayment, he leapt a little back,
and bravely meet him. So have I seen two angry bulls devide the way between
them in an equal distance, and then that their meeting might be the less
friendly, run at each with their utmost might, that with the fury of their
boystrous shocke, the earth has resounde, dand the fearful heard stand
amazedly gazing at eithers savagene. With the like fury did these two valiant
combatants behave themselves, making as much fire start out of their steely
helmes, as Vulcan when he^ beats new thunderbolts on his hardened anvill, the
grace of the combat was lost for want of beholders, only the Sun stood
still, wondering that the ones strength could resist the others fury, or his
fury support the others strength, despair and rage whetted on the furious
Martoll, honor and fame animated the bold Martuvio, so that long it was ere
either could get the better of other, but both held up with an equal courage.

The like combat was between Roderigo and the fierce Folco the Pirates bold
visea-dmirall, so that the bravary of these two fights, far surpassed the
fury of the other fight, strong assaults, and as strong wards were not wanting
on either side, huge blows and nimble avoidances were so frequent, that after
some time of fight they grew well experienced in each others manner of
fighting, stiff Martoll and strong Folco used down right blows, which o
huge, and guided with so strong arms, as would have cloven oaks had they
stood in their way: nimble Martuvio and sprightly Rodorigo, rather used light
avoidances, continually traversing the ground, that they might both the better
avoid the huge blows of their adversaries, and have also the more advantage
against them. So have I seen a nimble mastiue about to seize on a savage bull,
how he comes creeping on the ground, to get if he can under power of his
enemies horns, well knowing the danger of his headstrong adversary, till
finding oppertunity he fiercely leapes at his ears or nose, and having gotten
hold, gives not over till he have brought the bellower on his knees: in this
manner this combat continued between them a long time, till at last Martoll
(not being able longer to abide the force of his puissant enemy) fell down
dead at his feet, as Folco did also at the victorious Roderigoes.

Till this time had the fight continued in an equal balance, Fortune her
self scarce knowing on which side the dice would run; but no sooner did the
Pirates see their chief Captains fall (like huge towers) on the bloody hatches,
but their hearts died within them, and they stood still and unmou'd, like those
men that Medusa's head transformed into stones, upon this advantage the
Spaniards took fresh courage, and afresh boording them, they entered almost
without resistance, and being whetted on with rage, they made such havocke as
would have moov'd hard rocks to pity. What pen is able to relate the extreme
confusion of that hour, the Pirates cried out mercy, the Spaniards cried out
Victoria; yet could not the ones cries obtain mercy, nor was the others
victory without excess of blood: the sea chafes to see that his waters were
not sufficient to wash away their blood, and the heavens dropped down tears to
see the cruelty of the others, who no entreaties could persuade to pity, at
length the retreat was sounded; and they that escaped the fury of the
slaughter were presently put to the oars, that it was had to judge whither had
the harder fortune, they that were slain in battle, or they that after the
battle, were reserved to slavery.

Due thanks being rendered unto the Gods for so great a victory, the Duke who
by chance had seen the latter end of the fight, between the four brave
combatants, called Martuvio and Roderigo before him, and after a multitude of
excessive praises for their admirable valor, he rewarded their worths with
the honor of knighthood, whether he joyed more that victory was won, or
won by them, I know not; once his joy was so super-exceeding, that he clasped
them about the necks, and welcomed them with so natural a love, as if he had
been their own father; so did their noble acts work on his pliant nature.

Afterward every thing being set in order, they returned home again; where
the good Duke, not contented with the honor that himself had done them,
presented them to the King, as two inestimable jewels which the whole world
could not out valor; relating to him what they were, and how he came by them,
with the course of their life since he had them; but above all the rest, he
reported the manner of their combat, above measure extolling their courage and
skill, recounting what blows, what wards, had passed as if he had not only
been an eye witness, but had also taken true notise, of all the blows that
passed between them; which the King hearing, he highly commended them, and
that he might nourish valor in them, he bestowed on them places of command,
where we will leave them and return back to Sicily to see how the wedding
goes forward.

The day drew nigh, and every thing was in a forwardness, when it fortuned
(such is the frailety of humane estates) that it was crossed by an unlucky
accident. Not far off their lived two brothers, famous for nothing but
infamy, the one named Hormisda, and the other Pollipus, who were so commonly
noted for lewd livers, and licentious libertines, that every man of any good
condition hated their company, yet were they strong and hardy, as sometime we
see, nature gives her good gifts to bad men, and keeps them from those that
would employ them to better purposes; so was it with them, for their force they
employed in oppressing the weak, and if they were valiant, it was only in the
executing of some villainy, rapes and murders were common with them, oppression
and wrong were their daily lessons that they never left practicing: abundance
of wealth they had, partly by inheritance from their ancestors, and partly
gotten by extorting usury.

These pair of excellent creatures happened to epsy Callanthia and Florella
as they walked in the fields, and were presently stricken with their love, with
violence whereof (their lustful desire not being able to comprise it self in
any reasonable limits) they grew almost mad, for the obtaining of their
longings, love or lust rather had so possessed their brains that whatsoever
Hormisda fancied it was still concerning Calanthia, and all Pollipus
imaginations were set on work to admire the excellencies of Florella: To
speak to them they thought it vain, because they knew themselves hated, and
it had been dangerous for them, in regard of many injuries that they had done
old Clidamas, therefore smothering their affections, till they might find a
time to vent them, and therefore they awaited an opportunity which thus offered
it self unto them.

One day ere the morn expected the return of Apollo from the bed of the seas
Queen, old Clidamas roused up the lovers from their early beds, to hunt the
stagge in the neighboring forest, the huntsmen quaintly attired all in
green, with their horns about their necks, and their javelins in their
hands, stood at the entering of the wood to welcome them with the sound of their
merry bugles, their eager bloodhounds longing for the pray, stood whining as
angry to be kept so short: the two gentlewomen mounted on a couple of swift
palfries rode like a pair of Diana's nymphs, gaurded with a troop of lusty
Sylvanes: the game was a foot, and the following dogs with a gallant cry, made
the shrill Ecco babble to the woods, a language that she undestood not, poor
silly wat frighted with the noise, stretched out his small legs to their utmost
length, and with a pace outstripping Boreas, he taught the lazy curres to pass
themselves in swift careeres, the merry huntsmen with their loud hallowes
encouraged on the eager persuers.

Whilst thus the sport grew hot and every one attended the game, the false
Hormisda and treacherous Polipus, watching their time when all the rest were
out of sight, and the two maidens only in their viewes, of whom on purpose
they set a watchful eye to mark what way they took, before themselves could
tell what danger was near them, they violently seized on them, and stopping
their mouths least their cries should bewray them, they carried them straight
to their castle; for they durst not stay longer in the wood for fear of being
spied: when they had them there in their own power, they fell to comforting
them, telling them great stories of their loves, what continual torments they
had endured for their sakes, and how much they feared death, if they did not
prove gracious, with many other such dissembling insinuations, which sounded to
the poor gentlewomens ears, like the harsh clattering of weapons provided to
murder them; yet knowing in whose power they were, and hoping for sudden
help from their two lovers, whom they knew would never leave seeking till they
had found them, and knowing moreover, the nature of their jaylors, that they
would either by fair means or foul, by consent or force, obtain their
desires, wherefore they still framed such answers, as still put the suitors in
good hope, without any certainty of speeding, which they perceiving, and
understanding the difference between a willing and a forced love, as having
tried both, were the more willing to give way too; at length wearied with their
often delays, they urged them to give consent, or else they should be forced
to it. Which when the gentle creatures heard, with weeping eyes and sorrowful
hearts, considering the desperateness of their estate, Calanthia in the name
of her self and her sister made this answer.

Blame us not (great Horsmisda and you renowned Polipus) if what we account so
dear, we are so loath to part with, consider there is nothing so precious to a
woman, as her virginity: neither is there any thing that she can call her own
after she has lost that, then condemn us not if self love make us so chary
of that which is our only treasure: yet for your sakes (if blushes would give
me leave) I would part with it, upon one condition, and it is but a small one,
that you will grant us time to bewail the loss of our honor, and afterward
we will yield our selves up to your pleasure: if you refuse to grant us this
poor request, know, this knife shall sooner end my days, rather then you
shall enjoy the least favor from us, and of this resolve your selves.

This answer was so pleasing to them who believed she had spoken as she
thought, and therefore kissing them over and over, they granted four days
space, (which was the time of their own request, and in which they looked for
help) but the brothers bewitch't with joy and delight, thought verily that not
any man had seen them, or if they were descried, trusting to the strength of
their castle, with hearts overcharged with delightful fancies, they left the
sisters together; who being now alone, and looking more narrowly into the
certainety of their approaching danger, it made the salt tears trickle down
their fair cheeks, sad silence locked up their ruby lips, and imprisoned
their griefs in the delicate prison of their hollow breasts, till at last the
sweet Florella (whose sweetness surpassed the fairness of the morning)
uttered her grief in this doleful manner.

Can it be that I should endure all this and live? O then I see the fates have
destined me to too much misery, O Polydore, why have the Gods laid such a
plague on thee, (for I know thou so esteem'st it) to be robbed of thy Florella?
but more then miserable Florella, to be thus stolen from thy Polydore; if for
any fault of mine, ye Gods, ye have laid this misery on me, o take a virgins
heart, and let them be an expi^ation for my sin, but howsoever let not your
anger light on him, but grant that if it be my fortune to dye here in this
accursed Castle, he may remember Florella, as one that loved him dearly, but
no otherwise. Let him not pine himself away for me, and whenever he shall
happen to set his affection on any other, o let her be as true as I was, but
more fortunate; Callanthia hearing her laments, sought to comfort her in this
manner. Such is the nature of our misery, that to utter our laments is
dangerous, having so many spies to watch our doings, and so many scoutes to
overthrow our talk; let us therefore wisely smother up our passions in our
breasts, till time shall serve that we may in more happy days have occasion
to forget them; for if my heart presage not amiss, it will not be long ere
we shall find comfort, it cannot be but our loves hearing of our loss, will
without delay make search for us, and my father I know will soonest suspect
this place, as harboring such men, as are aptest for such a mischief:
therefore have I chosen so long a time, that we might be the more sure of
comfort. But what if they come not in that time (said Florella?) why than we
must resolve to dye nobly (said Callanthia) for never will I consent to
dishonor my self, for fear of death. Truly (said Florella) I am yet of that
mind to, but I know mine own weakness to be such, that I am not certain how
the terror of death will shake me, and therefore if it be your pleasure to
put me to so fierce a trial, I do beseech you o ye gods, to give me
strength and patience to endure it. Keep thee in that mind still (said
Callanthia) and thou will do well enough, with these like discourses they
passed away the time, till the four days of their limitation were out; and
the morning was the fatal day, either of their death or delivery: this put the
poor virgins to their utmost plunges, yet resolving themselves not to fly
from that their virtuous determination, they expected the sentence of their
deaths.

The night vanished, and the early cock (the true herald of the day) showed the
approaching of the rosy morrow, when lustful Hornisda and his compeere
Polipus arose, and doing (more than usual) devotions to the rising sun, they
went to the chamber of the sorrowful sisters, whom they found up and ready, as
loath to be taken a bed, by such as they, though they wished it had been
otherwise, yet not caring much for it, the lustful brothers fell to dallying
with them, which they, because they would not give them the least pleasure,
being determined to dye, rudely repulsed, yet still new batteries were laid to
their fortes of chastity, which were still beat back as violently as they
were presented shamelesly; at last growing past patience by so many (as they
called them) injuries, Hornisda in a great chase thus thundered. It Is true I
say, that too much familiarity begets contempt, else had not our gentle loves
been refused, if we had used such means as was becoming us, but since fair
means can work nothing with such waspes as you, we will try our own way,
and see if we can get that by force, which we could not by entreaty. Foul
devil (replied Callanthia) do thy worst, it is not thy terrifying threats that
can dismay us or alter our determinations, for know that we are resolved to
dye rather than to yield to thy villainy. Yet you shall dye (said he) but
first will I have my fill of you, then perchance, my sword shall be so
merciful as to rid you out of the world, in the mean time let you and I
strive for masterie, and therewith he violently took her by the hair, as
Polipus did the like to the tender Florella, forcibly dragging them to the beds
side, whilst thus (poor souls) made what shift they could to defend
themselves: and praying to the just God to lend them strength sufficient to
resist those tyrants.

Now was their forces lost, and the cruel wretches had almost laid them on the
lothed beds, when on a sudden they were scared with the noise of a hideous
outcry, the castle was up in an uproare, and every man cried arm, arm;
whereupon, the brothers fearing what might happen, and making account that
another time might serve for their mischeivous purpose, they went to see what
this sudden outcry pretended, when presently mounting on the castle walls,
they might descry a troop of armed men, coming in all have toward them,
whereupon, presently suspecting who they were, they provided for their defense:
but we must of necessity a while, look back to them that we left hunting
in the wood.

Every man was so earnest at the sport, that no one took heed to the two
sisters, so they were seized on, and carried away not being seen of any, save a
poor shepherd, who knew the man best, not the woman.

The fearful stagge wearied with the continual motion of so swift a pace,
began to despair of any longer safety by his legs, and therefore turning his
tail to a tree, he laid about him with his fair branch of weapons, so that
he made the cruel bloodhounds pause upon the fight, and as it were to take
counsel whether it were better to rebegin, or quite give over the battle:
which the hunts-man perceiving, and finding by the change of the cry, that he
was at a bay, they came in, and with their horns encouraged them, who thereby
taking fresh heart, never gave over till they had brought the vaunting champion
on his knees, than would it have moved remorse to see the gentle beast lament
his death in many a brine salt tear, as it were blaming man's cruelty, for
whetting on his enemies to kill him.

The sport was done and every one returned homeward, when (and not before)
Callanthia and Florella were mist, these news stroke a cold fear to the heart
of Clianthis and Polydore, presaging the danger that was like to fall unto
them, present search was made, every one taking a several way, and traversing
the whole wood, yet all returning without any news of any thing, but that they
were not to be found. Clianthis like a frantic man ran about calling on
Callanthia, and Polydore rid as he had lost his wits, crying nothing but
Florella, yet neither could Clianthis receive any answer from Callanthia, nor
Polydore from Florella. Echo condoling these true lovers miseries, help them
to call, for no sooner could Clianthis call Callanthia, but the echo would
take the word and call Callanthia, no sooner could Polydore cry out Florella,
but echo would second him, and cry out Florella, as if she would have
summoned all the powers in heaven and earth, to the search of Callanthia and
Florella.

Thus long in vain they sought, yet would not be persuaded that they sought in
vain, every sound they heard seemed the answers of their dearest loves,
flattering their ears with these imaginations, so long, till at the last they
knew that they were only flattered, and therefore plainly perceiving that they
were not there to be found, with careful hearts, and sorrowful thoughts,
they returned home again: where contrary to their expectation, they heard
news of them; for Clidamas as the rest, wandering up and down the wood, happened
to meet with the Shepherd, of whom inquiring if he saw any such, he made
him answer plainly, that they were perforce carried away, by Hormisda and
Polipus; glad he was that he had heard news of his daughters, yet was he
greived extremely to hear they were in such a place; but making necessity a
virtue, he went home, and telling these news to the lovers, and others that
were present, they forthwith consulted to regaine them by force, for by
entreaty they knew it was in vain to try, to this end they made provision of
men, and convenient armor, with what speed possibly they might. All things
heing provided, they marched forward, and coming near the Castle, they were
descried by the watch, they were no sooner under the walls, but they summoned a
parley, whereupon they within asked them what they came for, answer was made,
that they came to redeem the two fair sisters, Callanthia and Florella, whom
Hormisda and Polipus, had most villanously stolen away, which Hornisda hearing,
with a countenance threatening death and destruction, he made answer thus.

The girls are mine, fairly won by the force of arms, and I will keep them
maugre the proudest he amongst ye that dares say nay: I would I had thee in
the openest field in Sicily, (said Clianthis) I would make that boasting tongue
of thine give thy self the lie, I would make thee confess thy self to be a
villain. What in words (said Polipus) we have them, and will keep them if we
can, if not we will loose them, let them that sight best take them: agreed (said
Polydore,) and so the signal being given, the assault began, the ladders were
set up to the walls, and the soldiers mounted up to the top of them, from
whence they were thrust down headlong by the defendants, to receive their
deaths kiss at the ground; but the two lovers burning in rage, and thinking
the delay of victory a kind of overthrow, guarding themselves with their broad
sheilds, and taking their trusty swords in their hands, they valiantly got
footing on the walls, maugre all the resistance that could possibly be made,
where with their swords they made havocke of all that were nigh them, making
way for their soldiers to follow them, who without delay did so, and so became
masters of the wall: which Hormisda and Polypus perceiving, and not daring to
encounter them for all their vaunting, they fled by a posterne to Palermo, the
men of the Castle seeing their Captains were fled, presently threw away their
weapons, and craved mercy: which was as soon granted them.

Things being thus ovdered, Clianthis and Polydore, leaving the other business
to be managed by Clidamas, ran into the Castle from chamber to chamber,
seeking their loves, whom when they found, you may imagine what joy, what
kisses, what embraces passed between them, for so blessed a meeting; hand in
hand they went out of the chamber, till they came to the sight of old Clidamas,
who (overcome with excess of joy) ran and took them about the necks,
kissing them, and welcomming as if he had not seen them in a long time
before, but when they had recounting in what danger they had been, and how
nearly they had escaped ravishing, wonder and joy stopped up their speech, and
they stood like men confounded with excess of passion, out of which they were
no sooner awaked, but yielding due praise to the celestial powers, that
continually guard the virtuous, and setting all things in order, they left that
lothed place, and returned home again to their own habitations, attending the
day of marriage, till when, we will once again leave and return our Sicilians
in the court of Scaine.

Long time they lived there, daily increasing their fame with new deeds of
arms, yet known to be no other than the poor fishermans sons of Tarracona.
Till at the last Fortune offered them a glorious occasion, to build an ever
dying statue to eternize them to all succeeding generations, and thus it was.

It fortuned (besides the general greifes which were before taken) there
sprang up a new particular occasion of debate; between the King of Spain and
Tunis: for as before time, there had been a league for intercourse of
merchants between the two kingdoms. It fell out that upon some occasion of
mislike, false Mariabdela on a sudden, when they dreamed of no such
treachery, caused all the Spanish ships that were in his dominions, to be
seized on, and the goods to be confiscated: as for the men, some he caused
cruelly to be slain, others he made slaves, to tugge at the oars in his
galleys; this indignity seemed so grievous, that the King of Spain hearing of
it, sent his Ambassadors to Tunis, to demand restitution of those things that
were so spoiled, or else to denounce war against him; restitution was denied,
and their defiance was laughed at, as if the denouncers had bin children, or
boys not worthy to be answered, or regarded: for the fell tyrant strong
persuaded of the truth of the Oracle, feared not any danger, but what came from
Sicily, and therefore (with a scornful smile) he made answer to the
Ambassadors, in these or the like words.

You have spoke well, and to a good purpose, and I cannot but commend the
elegancie of your style, but let me tell you, that you want the chiefest part
of rhetoric persuasion: your oration in some other man (I must confess) might
have begat a kind of alteration, but in me, it works no more than if I had
been deaf when yon were speaking; for think not my nature can be changd by
words, or that what I have once but determined to do, much less what I have
already done, can be altered either by fair persuasions or your bitterest
menaces; what I have done, I mean not to repent of, your merchants have
offended me, and therefore have I punished them according to mine own will, as
being an absolute King in mine own dominions: What I have got. I Will keep, and
sooner shall he have this head from these shoulders, than I willl consent to
the restitution of our poor device: Go therefore, and tell your King, that I
neither mind his flatteries, nor fear his threats, when he comes he shall be
welcome, but I doubt he will be so long coming, that his mind will be
altered before he set forward on his voyage.

With this answer, the Ambassadors being dismissed with as much honor as was
to be expected in so barbarous a place, returned home again, where they
reported the effect of their embassage; which the King hearing, his heart was
filled with so just an anger, that he forthwith proclaimed open wars,
presently giving commandment for the preparation of galleyes, and other navall
furniture, fit for so weighty an expedition, as for the leving of men, both
mariners and soldiers: the managing of the whole business he committed to
the Duke of Midnia Sidonia, who was no way slack in performing his duty,
every thing being in readiness, they set forward, but they had not gone half
the way, ere they met with the huge fleet of bold Mariabdela, who as soon as
the Ambassadors were departed, provided every thing fitting, as loath to be
taken tardie in such a business, and therefore choosing rather to meet the
enemy, than to be enclosed in his city walls, he went out to encounter them
in the midway, no sooner had the fleetes descried each other, but they made
defiance, and the battle began, wherein Fortune (according to her blind
wisdom guided) gave the victory to the barbarians, for the good Duke being
overcloied with odds, perceiving he had lost the greater number of his ships,
with a heavy heart he sounded the retreat, and fled.

Two such other fleetes were set out from Spain, that returned home again,
these misfortunes greatly stird the resolution of the King of Spain, so that
ignorant in himself what to do, he called his counsel together to hear
their advise, what course he should take in this extremity; the counsel being
assembled, and every man commanded to speak his mind. The Marquess of Santa
Crux (who was a man that never from his youth affected the wars) stood up,
and spoke to this effect.

Had this order been taken before this unhappy difference was begun, it might
have saved the effusion of much innocent blood, and the expense of many
millions of crowns: which now are vainly wasted in these bloody broiles; then
it should not have been needful to inquire whether it were better to proceed
any further in this unfortunate war, or quite to give it over with dishonor
and disadvantage: but since it pleased your Majesty then to proceed according
to your own mind, without the advice of your counsel, (which I wish to the
Gods you had not) I will not urge that point any further, but come to the maine
matter that is in question. I am not such an enemy to war, that I should
utterly banish it, nor do I think so degenerately of soldiers, as to esteem
them of no use, or service in a Kingdom; for I know that war is the arm of
a country, and soldiers are the sinews of a commonwealth; but if this arm be
broke with unnecessarie toil, if the sinews be stretched past their natural
length, marvel not if the whole body be not out of joint: the chief end of
war is to defend our selves, not to offend others, and therefore peace is said
to be the child of war, which could not be, if for every light occasion we
should move unnecessarie debates, but to the purpose. Mariabdela has offered
injury to our merchants, revenge has been sought, and still we have come
home by the worst, and yet we inquire, what is to be done? alas, what do we
aile to move such a needless question? Ask the merchant that has lost his
venture, whether he had rather keep that he has together, or hazard more to
a certain ruin? can we expect any hope of victory, now our strengths are
weakened? the best of our ships are sunk and spoiled, the greatest part of our
treasures wasted, and the most of our soldiers slain, that could not obtain
it when all these were whole; but you may say, the fortune of the fight may
change, and what we could not get by force, we may obtain by some cunning
stratagem: a weak confidence God knows, to trust to fortunes favor now, that
have hitherto had her frowns, and a vain toy to think to entrap Mariabdela
by a policy, that has been all his life time a master in wars discipline.
I knew Midnia, to be a wise and prudent cheifetaine, and his soldiers to be
men of excellent valor, yet this same Midnia has been overreach't by
Mariabdela, and his soldiers have been vanquished by the other barbarians:
it is true, that chance carries a great stroke in military affairs, yet it is a
cold comfort, to hope for a happy chance, where there is no likelihood to
bear off the shocke: and little cause have we to trust to fortunes ficklenes,
that lost her in so good a cause, but fortune is blind; and therefore I will
speak no more of her, as not esteeming her worthy to be accounted of in man's
affairs, rather I judge that the divine providence, for some grievous offenses
of ours, have laid this plague upon us: and therefore, to strive further
against the gods, I think you will say 'twere madness. What should we say, the
Commons cry out, for the grievous taxations raised upon them, to maintain the
war, which sorting to so unwelcome an end, cannot choose but be a great grief
to all, the treasuries are drawn dry, the navy is unfurnished, widows in
every place lament the loss of their husbands, fathers, and mothers sit
weeping and wailing for the untimely loss of their dear children. Mariabdela
laughes at our tears, and make the misery of our losses, the trophies to
renown his victory; and for all these expenses, not only the first indignity
is not revenged, but also it is made greater by many new and latter
misfortunes: they being enriched with our losses, and making provision for
themselves of our stores. My advise therefore to your Majesty is, that you
would find out some honorable conditions of peace to be offered the
barbarians, rather than to continue the war, that has hitherto sorted so
unluckily on our sides, and therewith he ceased. Whereupon the Duke of Midnia,
whose valor, fortune could never diminish, though she might frown upon his
actions, hearing he rose, and making due reverence, he spoke to this purpose.

What honorable peace can the King of Spain make with Mariabdela, when he was
the first that provoked the Tunisian to fight? I grant this had been good
counsel at first, before the majesty of a Kingdom had been engaged upon the
enterprise, but now, since it has proceeded so far, as to the stern deciding
of the sword; I hold it no way honorable, for a little loss, to hazard the
perpetual honor of a mighty Kingdom, which cannot be avoided, if we give
over now so faintly, what we begun with such alacrity; what though we have
lost the fortune of a day or two, is that of force to impoverish a whole
Kingdom? (as you my Lord of Santa Crux would make us believe) can the expense
of a million, were it two, empty the coffers of this Spain? you much
undervalew the revenews of this rich Kingdom, to think so poorly of it; but
if it were true, that these wars have so exhausted the treasuries, that the
remainder will not suffice to furnish another fleet, is Spain (I pray you)
grown so desolate, that it has no friend to help her in an extremity so
urgent? what is become of Italy, the ancient friend of Spain? where is
spacious France? is Sicily vanished? is Rhodes perish't? is Malta drowned in
the sea? or is the famous Greece sunk into the earth? can it be that none of
these should yield us succor? Is it possible, that Mariabdela should have done
no wrong to any of them? did not the fierce Martoll (waged by the King of
Tunis) rescue the ships of Candy? force the fleet of Malta, spoil the navy of
Rhodes, and ransom certain Sirians bound for Greece, never sparing to do any
villainy, till my self with the help of the brave brothers, overcame him; and
since his death, have not whole fleetes of rovers bin set forth from Tunis, to
rob and spoil, so that no merchants dare pass to and fro in any part of the
straits, and do you think that all these injuries can be put in silence, as
would be, if these petty kings and princes had but the countenance of the
great King of Spain to animate them, perhaps you would have them come and
offer their service unto you, unsent for, small reason for that, when you have
not sent them any notice of your purposes, which if you neglected (as scorning
to use the power of your inferiors) it was ill done, if as trusting to your
own force, to go through with the enterprise, you see you are too fond in
that: but never can it be too late to learn wisdom, and to put in practice
any honorable action, it cannot be, that if your Majesty send your Ambassadors
to these Princes, to crave their aid, they should be denied, nay rather it
seems to me, that they will (more than willingly) embrace the motion, whereby,
they shall not only redeem their own particular losses, but also bind the
great king of Spain to be their friend; with the aid of them, you may furnish
out another army, which shall not only beat the proud Barbarian, but also
fully redeem the dishonor, and the loss of the former battle: you urge the
tears of orphans, the cries of widows, the laments of parents, and the
wailing of friends, as if they were not incident to the wars, can it be (I
pray you) that a battle should be fought, and not one slain? and if some be
slain? can it be there should be none to bemoane them? or do ye think
there be no wet eyes in Barbary, as well as here in Spain.? Mariabdela I am
sure bought not his victory so cheap, nor am I a man so noted for cowardice,
to give over the fight for nothing; I never fled before I met with Mariabdela,
and then, I think I was vanquished, merely and solely, by the overpresse of
multitudes: almost two for one were slain on their party, yet still they were
supplied with fresh ones, that it amazed me, to see them spring up so fast
(like Hydraes-heads) when one was lopt off, two arose in their places, so that
(if I may speak it without being taxed of boasting) I think we were overcome
only by being weary of conquering; and I suppose, that the conqueror lost
more, than we that were vanquished: and well might they say with their
countrie-man Hanniball, many such victories would undo them. Consider I pray,
we went (as you know) not past fifty galleys strong, when as Mariabdela, met
us with about two hundred, and yet against such, we held out fight for the
space of five years, without any sign of disadvantage: imagine what we could
have done, had we been of any equality. These things considered, (my gracious
Lord) it is my opinion, that it were best for your majesty, to send your
messengers to the mighty young Princes for aid, wherewith you may raise such
an army, as may quell the vaunting foe, and bring him down in spite of his
sunburned Moors: for my self I shall be ready as I have been heretofore, to
spend my best endeavors in your graces service, so he ceased; when presently
Martuvio arose, and making all humble reverence, he spoke on this manner.

If it shall not seem too much arrogance (my noble Lords) for such younglings
verdites amongst so many Nestors, or if we be not overhasty in speaking
already, that should rather be seven years in hearing, I shall with
confidence reveal a secret, which has long time been hammering in my head.
What you my Lords of Midnia, and Santa Crux have worthily spoken, has its
time, but not now; (pardon me if I reject such worthy counsel) for if what I
have thought, may be put in action, neither needs his Majesty to seek to
the Barbarian for peace, nor to continue the war, which has already been so
unfortunate, and are both so unluckily to succeed any thing well: for what
peace, how little soever honor it may carry with it is to be exqected from
Mariabdela? whose nature seems to be bloudily desirous of war, that I
suppose he did this injury to the merchants, as only weary of an idle peace,
and thirsting greedily after death and spoil, and therefore it makes me
think, that he will be so far from accepting a league of amity, now he
has once been flesh't in victory, that he will rather come to seek us at
our own homes, if we once give him over; he will with whole worlds of Moors,
come up and spoil the country, and when your Ambassadors shall be heard to
treat for peace, he will be thereby the more animated, as thinking it to be
done for fear. He is no child, to think that we would let him rest if we
could choose, besides, no honorable conditions of peace can be concluded on,
without requiring restitutitution of the wrongs done to the Merchants, and do
you think that he will hear it once spoken of, now he is puffed up with fame
and victory, that was so far off from consenting to it before the war?
never think that he that dares do a villainy, when he knows not his own
strength, will make any amends for it, when he knows he can defend himself:
so for any further proceeding in the wars, I hold that to be as unprofitable
too, not because I think we have no soldiers left, that dare not fight, or no
commanders that dare valiantly lead them on, or that I despair of the help
of the neighboring Princes, but that I am verily persuaded, that all these
together cannot make an army potent enough to meet him with two hundred sail;
as he met our fleet of fifty: and do you think he can make no more, now he
has taken so many of ours, and has had so much time to provide more of his
own? He has all Africa at his command, a country large and wide, sufficiently
provided of timber, to make many fleetes of galleys, bigger than all our
kingdom is able to make, and wonderfully replenished with a world of nations:
it is true as my Lord Admiral has said, that the only advantage he has had
against us, has been by overpresse of multitude, and shall we think that he
will at any time want that advantage, having such an innumerable company of
people that yet never saw the sea? who though they be not so experient in
fights, yet will they stand a blow, and so (as my Lord said) we shall be
again vanquished, with weariness of overcoming. I am no coward, that I dare
not fight (for be it spoken without boasting) were it put upon the point, my
self would encounter with the whole host of Mariabdela, came he in his
greatest power, but what good success I should have, your Lordships may
imagine: but I speak this, to save the great effusion of humane blood, that
must of necessity be spilt in these bloody actions, howsoever they speed. I
speak it to dry up the tears of women and children, for the loss of their
husbands and fathers; I speak it to stop the clamorous grumbling of the
greived commons, that have been, and still must be, if the war continue,
taxed and oppressed with subsidies and toles, that of necessity they must be
drawn dry, or else fall to flat rebellion against his majesty, which might
beget another danger greater than the former. Yet would I not have your majesty
wholly to give over the enterprise, for I would not be thought to think so
basely and poorly of the majesty of the kingdom of Spain, but a way is to
be found out, which may make amends for all injuries, yet neither by seeking
to the Tyrant for peace, nor by vexing our selves with any further broiles; but
the matter needs not much conference, for my self with the assistance of my
brother (and therewith Roderigo stood up too) have found out a way (which if it
shall please your Majesty, and you my noble Lords to countenance,) I doubt not,
but will bring the Tyrant Mariabdela to make you such recompense as you shall
ask of him, or else he shall forfeite his head to your Majesty's clemency.
The attempt in it self is dangerous, but what danger can appall a mind greedy
of honor? nor shall you think, that we have invented a thing, wherein we
shall have the glory of the counsel, and some other the danger of the action;
for as we have been the first founders, so do we also offer our selves (if
it stand with your Majesty's good liking) to put in execution our own devices.
I have heard it reported that the only men in the world that Mariabdela fears,
are Sicilians, moved thereto by a certain oracle (how true, I know not) that a
Sicilian and none else, shall be his overthrow: and to this end, does he use
all the means he can to get all Sicilians into his clutches, and having them,
he cruelly butchers them, as for other nations, he entertaines men of all
sorts into his service, without respect of any whatsoever. I will not dispute
of the truth of this oracle, least I might seem to question the knowledge of
the divine powers; rather I think, this oracle delivered in such plain words,
does as al oracles use to do, carry a double meaning, so wrapped and clouded
in ambiguous obscurity, that only the event of all must make it apparent: for
seldom do the gods give forth their oracles, but the same implies a quite
contrary thing, than is propounded by the bare words, which is always
manifested by the event; howsoever, it is not my purpose, to enter into any
men's discourse, only my intent is by deeds, to make proof whether the words
of the oracle, and the meaning of it do concur together. But to come to the
point, my brother and my self, according to a settled determination (which we
still submit to be fashioned on the anvile of your grave wisdom) will as it
were in secret depart from hence to Tunis, where by some means or other, we
will get admittance into the Kings service, when if the meaning of the oracle
deceive me not, we shall use such means, as to bring the Tyrant away with us
to Spain, else let us dye forgot and unregarded; this if it happen according
to our intentions, as the willing forwardness of my heart makes me presage it
will, you may then use your own pleasure, whilst you have him in your power:
but if it please the Gods that we miscarry in the action, it cannot greatly
hurt the state, but you may at your pleasure either conclude all, with what
honorable peace you can, or else if that be refused, you may proceed in the
war, in either of which two businesses, our two lives can smally shade you;
this is our advise, which if it please your Majesty to assent to, shall before
to morrow morning be put in practice: and I beseech the Gods, that the event
may be as fortunate, to the good of Spain and you, as we with wishing
hearts, and more wills to go forward, than to give it over, do undergo the
enterprise.

No sooner had he made an end of speaking, but a general silence was over the
whole house, every man above measure, wondering at the great courages of the
noble youths, thinking a thing almost incredible, that such young years
should harbor so much valor, at last the Marquess of Biscay, who was a man
singularly reputed for wisdom and courage, and had all this while attentively
listened to the words of the young man, marking with what confidence he spoke,
as if the thing had been done already, and not still to do, rose up and spoke
thus.

For evetmore blessed be the gracious Gods of Spain, for sending hither two
such excellent men in so great a danger, and happy may that man be, that first
brought them into this assemhly. With favcur of your Majesty and the honorable
convent, it may please your Majesty and you my Lords to consider, that there
can be no more said in this business, than what has been already delivered,
for either you must as my Lord Marquess counsels, seek out for some
honorable conditions of peace, which are as hard to find, as they are
unlikely to speed, or you must as my Lord of Midnia advises, continue the
war, and send for aid to the neighboring Princes, which way as it cannot
choose but be chargeable, so it is uncertain to what end it will sort: or if
neither of these please you, you must of necessity take hold of the device of
young Martuvio, which as it is in it self, a matter dangerous, and hopeless
ever to come to good, so being managed by men of such excellent wisdom and
approved, it binds in my breast a settled hope of a success, worthy the men
that undertake it. Mariabdela we know is secure of his fate, fearing none but
Sicilians, and who knows but (as Martuvio urged) the oracle may aim at some
thing that is specified by the words, besides how easy a thing will it be for
men brought up and exercised in wisdom, to work upon the nature of a rude
Barbarian? whose only wisdom is to feast and revell, giving himself over to
drunkenness and sensuality, not fearing any thing that may befall him, because
he only fears Sicilians, of whom he has none in all his kingdom, they
have all things on their side that may animate them, excellent shapes to
procure admittance, excellent eloquence to persuade, excellent wisdom to
insinuate into the secrets of the Barbarian, excellent valor to undertake any
danger, that has the least show of likelihood, and excellent fortune I hope,
to second their just undertakings. Stay not then for second thoughts, but if my
counsel, which heretofore has prevailed with you, may now also be of force
to persuade you; you shall without delay put this attempt in execution, and
with your continual prayers, obtain a happy end to so courageous an
adventure, which howsoever, it may advantage the state, by bringing into your
hands the man that has so annoyd it, yet cannot it much hinder your
proceedings, if it fall contrary to your expectation: I am not so urgent in
this business, as annoying the glory of the men, and therefore willing to put
them upon an adventure, that if it succeed amiss, may be their inevitable
destruction, for the Gods be my witnesses that my soul loves them, and I
rather bite this tongue out, than it should be such a traitor to the state, to
give such counsel as might rob the kingdom of two such precious jewels: but
my heart is (I know not how) so fully persuaded of the good success of this so
honorable action, that I imagine, I should do much wrong to such excellent
valor, if I should be a means to starve it, by giving counsel to deprive it
of such honorable food to nourish. On therefore most noble youths, and may
your hand be as ready to put in execution, speed in your success, and you
may return home crowned with glory, honor, and victory.

This speech so wrought with the whole assembly, that presently without any
more debating on the matter, every man gave his assent, and the king highly
commending their worth, gave his consent also. Now to avoid all fear of
revealing of the matter, by means of spies, or else by treacherous and
malecontented people, (as is too commonly seen in such businesses) every thing
was carried in most admirable secrecy: The two brothers getting on a sudden
on horseback, and riding in all post-haste to the seaside, where finding a
fisher-boate, they presently went into it, such was their confidence in their
just cause, and with it they crossed the seas to Tunis. In the mean, time the
king of Spain, provided every thing for a new army, as if he would presently
have gone on another voyage in his own person, and in this preparation we
will leave them.

Our two Sicilians rowed so long, till at last they came to their journeyes
end, and were no sooner landed, but they were presently set upon by the guard
of the place, and strict inquiry was made; who, what, and of whence they were,
they made answer, that they were Spaniards, and were come to offer up their
service to the King of Tunis, hereupon, presently they were carried before the
king, who being set in his Majestic state, with a stern countenance, asked
who they were? whereupon, Martuvio (nothing daunted with his great looks)
boldly made this reply.

The time has been great king of Tunis, when he that should have said, we
two should have come to offer thee our service, might have perchance received
the lie for his labor, for we were once thy professed enemies, nay that if we
could, and would have cut thy head off, had it been in the midst of this
royal palace; we are the men, that slew Martoll and Folco, the two swords
of Barbary, and have besides done thee no small mischeife: but now it so falls,
that we that have been thy professed foes, are now become votaries, we that
have done thee so much outrage, are come hither to seek shelter under thy
wings, for the ungrateful king of Spain, not content to leave our virtue
unrewarded, (which he ought to have cherished with the best of his
endeavors,) has gone further, even to the seeking of our lives, and yet (good
Gods) how many ways is that man beholding to us! what had become of the poor
Duke of Midnia, and his weather-beaten fleet, when they encountered with
courageous Martoll, before Zanto, if our swords had not ended the
controversy, by the death of those brave men; for whom, I could weep, to
think that such excellent soldiers, should end their lives to benefit
thereby, so ungrateful a person, and that by our hands, to make us so much
more miserable: by how much it is more wretched, to be enforced to ask
releife of an enemy, than to remain at home, in ease and tranquillity,
besides, in those latter fights in which it pleased the Gods to favor me,
what had become of his whole people, if our breasts had not been the bulwarks
to their safe entreaty? in which though it was our fortune to loose the day,
yet I may speak it withaut boasting, they that escaped alive, may thank our
valors for their safeties, and yet for these things (for I take the Gods to
be my witnesses that we never injured him,) this ungrateful king, this king
(said I) this any thing, this indeed nothing, laid wait to entrap our lives,
but that by speedy flight we prevented it. We come therefore to thy imperial
Majesty, as the Roman Coriolanus, did to his enemies the Volscians, and if it
shall please thy Majesty, to commit any charge of trust to us, we make no
doubt, but as Coriolanus was the sorest enemy to Rome, so Martuvio and Roderigo
shall prove the greatest opposites to ungrateful Spain.

These words so bewitched the tyrants affection, that he was on fire to
entertain them, he saw no cause to fear, they were not Sicilians, their
speech, their garments, their looks, and all their gestures, openly proclaimed
them Spaniards: their sparkling eyes full of revengefull fire, their menacing
speeches, repleate with deadly threatening, their constant and unmoved gesture
answering to their looks and speeches, did evidently manifest a deadly hatred
to their native country: their bold adventuring in so small a vessel, argued
the necessity of their flight. Valiant he knew they were, for he himself had
had experience of their force, and he esteemed them to be wondrous wise, as
choosing rather to put in hazard the clemency of their enemy, than to tarry at
home with a certain assurance of destruction, nor did he want presidents of
the like kind to warrant his acceptance of them, til he had heard of
Coriolanus the Roman, and his flight to the Volscians, and what followed
thereupon; he remembered Themiostcles the Athenian, and his escape to the king
of Persia, as also Alcibiades the Athenian, and his departure to the
Lacedaemonians: and why should not the revolt of these two brave Spaniards, be
as fortunate to him, as that of Coriolanus to the Volscians, of Themistocles to
the Persians, and of Alcibiades to the Lacedaemonians? Upon these
considerations, and withal building upon his oracle, he bade them heartily
welcome, telling them they should enjoy as much safety in his court, as they
had found treachery in the court of Spain, and that they should find, when
occasion served to employ them, in the mean time, they should be dear to him,
and always near about his person.

The good fortune at the entrance of their enterprise, put our two gallants in
an assured hope of an absolute conclusion; and therefore, with attractive
greedines they expected opportunity to put something of their business in
practice, much honor was done them by the rude Barbarian, and highly respected
were they of all men, because every body knew it was the kings pleasure they
should be so respected: the king himself exceedingly favoring them, as being
bewitched with their insinuating speeches, not knowing that he hatched
serpents to sting himself to death, yet did they not want enemies, who
labored what they could to bring them into displeasure with the king, some
envying that strangers should be so highly advanced above the native people,
others emulating their glory in deeds of arms, hating all worthiness in
others, because they had none to brag off in themselves, but others of a more
subtle and acute ingenuitie, deeply suspected that this might be some subtle
practice from the cunning Spaniard, and therefore they used all diligence, to
pry into their actions, if perchance, they could learn any thing, to make
their suspicion seem a certainty. But our supposed Spaniards used themselves
so warily, that they failed of their purpose, yet nevertheless, they ceased
not to observe them more narrowly, not sticking at last to unfold their
suspicion to the king, using many reasons to persuade him to look more nearly
to himself, than to trust his safety to the faith of them, that were borne his
enemies, but he lulled in security by their pleasing his humors, would not
listen to any such complaints.

This could not be so closely carried, but the two strangers understood it,
and therefore wisely considering, that though now they were fully possessed of
the kings favor, yet the tide might turn, and he might be wrought to injure
them, they resolved between themselves, that it was time to put in practice
their adventure, to which effect, the surest way (as they thought) was, that an
army should be brought from Spain thither, but than they wanted means to
certify the king of Spain of their purpose, but fortune that would not suffer
such designs to perish in the blossom, provided them of a means for that
too. It fortuned that a merchant of Genoa, at that time residing in Tunis, was
at that time providing to return home to his own country, with him they agreed
to carry a letter for them, and to convay it to Spain, which he readily
consented to, and accordingly performed.

These news being on this manner brought to the king of Spain, without any
the least suspicion in the Barbarian of any such practice, an army was
forthwith levied, and set forth under the conduct of the Duke of Midnia, in the
mean time, the two brothers, so wrought with the king of Tunis, that he had
promised them the conduct of an army, to be lead against Spain, but this
news of this new army, quite put out such determinations for now it was fitter
to look to his own defense, than to the assayling of others: and therefore
with all speed possibly he prepared his navy to meet them, some there were,
that counseled him to leave the Spaniards at home, (as it seemed) presaging
what afterward proved to be true, but he would not by any means hear of any
such thing, yet did he (for the more security as he thought) take them into
his own gally, because he would be sure always to have an eye on.

In this manner, they met with the enemy, who presently gave them battle, and
the sigstht was fierce on both sides; in the heat whereof, and when the ships
of either party had boorded each other, and were fast grapled together, the
two brothers (who were placed as I said before, in the kings own ship)
thinking now or never, to be the time they had so long looked for: on a
sudden, they took the Barbarian in their arms, and violently threw him into
the ship that was next them, where before he could rise again, he was taken
and carried under hatches, the brothers in the mean time, showing what they
were, violently set upon the Barbarians in that ship, making a way for the
Spaniards, who presently boorded her.

This chance so terrified the poor Africans, that they knew neither what to
say or do; and the cry went in an instant, that the king was taken: whereupon,
being infinitely amazed, and in this amazement* the Spaniards furiously
assaulting them, they lost all courage, and therefore, with what speed they
could, ungrapling themselves, in a most confused order they fled, and were as
fast pursued by the enemy, who took and killed as many as they overtooke, in
this sort, they rested not, the one party flying, and the other following, till
they came to the haven of Tunis, where the Barbarians, presently getting a
shore, made a fresh resistance, to stop all the Spaniards from landing, but
smally had it advantaged them, being already beaten, and their enemies the
conquerours, had not presently a flagge been put out: for the Lords of the
country, who were left as governors of the place, while the king was at the
wars, hearing of the overthrow, and of the captivity of the king, and now
fearing the surprizall of the town, they chose rather, to stand to such
conditions of peace, as the enemy should propose to them, than by their further
obstinacies to procure an inevitable destruction, to themselves, and to their
whole country. Upon these considerations, the flagge of truce was put forth,
which was answered with the like from the enemy, whereupon, it came to a
treaty, and conditions were made, that the Barbarians should make such
satisfaction, both for the wrong done to the merchants, and for the charges the
Spaniard had been at in these present wars, and for the redemption of their
king, as the king of Spain should impose: and to that end, their Ambassadors
should forthwith go with them to Spain, and for security of this, they should
entertain into the city, till the conditions were performed, such a company of
soldiers, as the Lord admiral should think sufficient, for the guard of the
place; this if they would not agree to, they should stand to the hazard of the
fight, necessity so urged them, that of force these conditions were excepted:
only they desired that they might be no more troubled with their king, who was
so fell a tyrant, that they were not able longer to endure him, and therefore,
they requested the Duke, that since it was his fortune to have him in his
hands, he would be pleased to use such means with the king, as that the
tyrant might no more trouble them, and if he would take such an order, they
would wholly submit themselves to his government, rather choosing to be
commanded by a stranger, than such a monster.

Every thing being ordered, in a most convenient manner, and a garrison of
soldiers put into the town; the Duke of Midnia, with the two noble youths,
and the prisoner king of Tunis, and the Ambassadors of the town returned
homeward, where they were received with the loud clamours and shoutes of joy,
of the overgladded people, every where they came, shows and triumphs were
presented them, and all of them, some in one sort, and some in another, setting
forth the honorable actions of the noble Sicilians: in this pompous manner,
they came at last to the court at Sivill, where they were entertained by the
king in most loving manner, especially the two brothers, whom with the arms of
love he embraced, calling them his protectours and defenders, imputing those
things to their honor and fame, that they of duty ought to have performed.
Thus lived these two in honor and credit, every man highly esteeming them, as
the only mirrours of admirable valor, and singular wisdom in that age.

This honor done to the overthrowers made the Barbarian beyond measure mad,
and his fortune so contrary to his expectation, made him to doubt of his
oracle, yet did he not absolutely despair of it, till the Ambassadors being
dismissed, and every thing being agreed upon, and he seeing no hope of escape,
he began then utterly to tax the Gods of falsehood, impiously blaspheming
those powers for so deluding him. After some time (at the request of the
brothers) he was brought to the kings presence (where to vindicate the Gods of
such injury as he had offered them) they told him plainly that they were
Sicilians, relating to the king, and the rest of those that were present, their
country, kindred, and family, and how they were stolen from Sicily by the
Pirates, and afterward with them cast away upon the coast of Spain, where they
were found by fisherman of Tarragona, this news as on the one side, it amazed
the king, with such an accident, so on the other side, it much more madded the
Barbarian, cursing himself for neglect, for being overreach't in such manner,
and therefore, what with shame of his overthrow, and with new torment of
conscience, for his old wickedness, he desperately abstained from food, and
so dyed by famine, nor was his death lamented of any, but rather it much joyed
the heart of the Tunisians, to hear that he was sure enough for ever
troubling them any more.

In the mean time, the two famous youths, burning in desire to see their
native country, their parents, and kindred, humbly requested the king to grant
them his Majesty's license to depart for a time to Sicily, to see whether their
father and mother were alive or no, and afterward they would return, and spend
their lives in his graces service. This so reasonable request, the king soon
consented to, and therefore willingly, he gave them license to depart at their
pleasure, and withal gave them his commendatory letters to the governors of
Sicily, to receive them as men whom he highly favored. Humbly therefore,
taking their leaves, (after due provision of every thing for their journey)
they departed to Tarragona, where they inquired for old Sancho their
foster-father, whom having found, they rewarded with rich gifts, which did not
so much glad the good old man, as it did joy him to see them, whose lives he
had saved, in such honor and dignity; there they took shipping, and departed
to Sicily, in which journey, we will for a while leave them, and return once
again to our wedding, which we left in so good forwardness.

But fortune, as it seemed willing to show what authority she had in lovers
proceedings, once more laid a stumbling block to cross their happiness;
Hormisda and Polypus, (those two brothers in mischeife) who (as you heard
before) left the Castle to the conquering lovers, never left their flight, till
they came to Palermo, a city not far off, where there dwelt an aunt of
theirs, named Andriana, a woman so well skilled in ill, that she was the
tutresse to her forward nephews: aged she was about fifty, but of crabbed
conditions, and testy of nature, that the pettish favor of her angry wrinckled
face, showed her to be far older than indeed she was. Her continual
practice was to entise youth to any evil, and when she failed of her intents,
she would sit feeding herself with despite and anguish, other men's adversity
was as a cordial to her, but their prosperity poisoned her: she practiced
physic, but to what purpose I know not, for there were few that knew her,
that would venture under her hands for a cure; so that generally she was
despised and contemned, as a woman of the most wretched conditions of the whole
city.

To this gracious mistress, did these two (striplings in her art) come for
shelter, who though she were crabbed to others, ye^ did she love them
entirely, moved thereto perhaps by the congruitie of their conditions: and
therefore welcoming them, she inquired of their estate, and what chance had
driven them to Palermo? but when she knew the cause, her heart was so full of
revengefull anger, that she could not speak in a good while, her teeth
chattered in her head, and her eyes stared, as if they would have leapt out, to
seek those over-happy couples: at last anger gave place to words, and
therefore taking her kinsmen by the hands, and seating them by her, she thus
spoke unto them.

Since the death of your good uncle (my dear nephews) I have not entertained
news that was so displeasing to me, to see that fortune should so much fool
you, as to bring you to the goal of happiness, and then to leave you, and
turn to your enemies. Trust me nephews, I could be angry with you, for
loving, for what is love? that he should have power over you, that are men of
a more austere condition, then those that are Cupids Votarists; but more angry
I am, in that being so deeply in love, as you were, you would suffer your
selves to be so gulled by a couple of wenches: had you them not in your own
power, to do with them what you pleased? and yet must you needs stand to
their courtesy, that would not yield to your prswasion, now by the crisped
locks of stern Hecate, you were too blame, too childish; you should rather
have showed your selves like men, and as you surprised them well and cunningly,
so you should have proceeded accordingly, and not used such entreaties to such
peevish sluts: who now that they are free, will laugh at your folly, and boast
themselves in your indiscretion, vaunting of their wits in beguiling two men so
well skilled in Venus art, as Hormisda and Polipus. It was not well nephews, it
was not well, and I could chide you for it, but that I see you penitent and
ashamed of your own weakness, but shall these roysters boast themselves thus?
shall they say Hormisda and Polypus are overcome? and Andriana cannot help
them? no, rather will I move hell, and call all those powers to my aid, rather
will I send the furies with their whips of steel to scourge them, till they
fall to despair, and hang themselves, were not that a sweet revenge, nephews?
trust me, were I to choose; no other way would I revenge my self, but by
their deaths: but I see unwonted pity appear in your eyes, and you that were
wont to delight in nothing so much as blood, now me thinks started at the name
of death. O then I see, love has such mastery over you, that nothing but the
fruition of those sweetes of love can satisfy you, and is it so indeed? well
then, though I hate this foolish compassionate love in you, whom in my mind,
it fitted rather to laugh at their downfall, than to desire their company, yet
since I hope, that after you have had your wills on them, your selves will be
their fatal executioners, I am contented for this once, to mollify my hardened
nature, and to beat my brains for a way to work your desires.

These kind words so fired their hearts, that they thanked their aunt,
promising if she would perform this, that afterward they would be wholly at
her commandment, whereupon, she thus began again.

It is a hard matter nephews, to compass your desires, it being a thing
altogether impossible, for man or devil to change the will of any, and
therefore you must not expect that they can be wrought to love you, but you
must determine, that when you have them in your power again, (which is all I
can perform for you) you must banish al lenity from you, and be nothing moved
with their tears or entreaties; now to work this, a new way must be
invented, because I think they will not be so foolish hereafter, to trust
themselves so without company, and to attempt to take them perforce, were a
matter of much difficulty, if not impossibility. I have therefore invented a
means, whereby in spite of all the world you shall enjoy Callanthia and
Florella; get me presently without delay, two pair of gloves, rich and
costly, such as you think may fit their hands, these will I so charm with
magic spells, and forcible incantations, that whosoever draws them on, shall
suddenly fall into so deep a sleep, that all sign of life shall be
extinguished in them, till they are pulled off again. These enchanted gloves,
shall one of you in some disguise, present to the two wenches, as from their
sweet-hearts (but see you choose your time wisely, that you be not intrapped
in your own subtility) which they shall no sooner have pulled on, but drowsy
sleep will take possession on their eyes, and then I hope I shall not need to
instruct you how you should use them: this (if you play your parts as well as I
will mine) cannot choose but be a plot thriving and fortunate.

This plot was so pleasing to the nephews, that thanking their aunt
exceedingly for her good counsel, they presently fetched the gloves, with
which the devil and she wrought so thoroughly, that somnivolent power, was
transfused into them; which was no sooner done, but Hormisda having by diligent
inquiry, found a time when the two lovers were at their own castle, in the
disguise of a serving-man, went to present their gifts to the beauteous
sisters. Fortune so favored him, that he found them walking together, all
alone, in a little grove, which as it was out of sight of their fathers house,
yet was it within hearing, and therefore they feared no treachery there, the
false Hormisda, finding them so conveniently, applauding highly his good
fortune, went boldly to them, and with an humble reverence, presented them with
the gloves, with these speeches.

My noble masters Cleanthes and Polydore, humbly kiss the hands of their
beauteous mistresses, and by me their servant, present your Ladyships with
these gloves, though far too mean to be worn upon such delicate hands,
earnestly requesting you, to pardon their whole days absence, from your wished
presence: protesting it has been, as a tedious winter of perpetual frost, to
be kept so long from the comfortable sun of your fair beauties, such is the
urgency of their present business, that they must of necessity endure this
torment, till to morrow morning, and then they will delay no longer, to tender
you their service, in the mean time, not to be thought altogether unmindefull
of you, they have sent me their unskillfull messenger, to make their excuse:
but least my unlikely presence, might work no belief in your easy nature,
they have entrusted me with the delivery of these gloves, as an instance that
I came from them, kissing them before they parted with them, and desiring you
to put them on, that those gloves that kissed their lips, might be so happy as
to kiss your hands.

The gentlewomen, could not choose but smile to see, with what a shamefac't
bashfulnesse, the fellow delivered his message, as seeming to be an
unskillfull rhetorician in the art of love; and therefore taking the gloves of
him, they bade him return their thanks to their masters, and tell them, that
had they not sent a good orator to make their way, they should surely have
been well chidden for their negligence, but now they would pardon them, if
they would keep their words, and not fail to see them on the morrow, and
therewith they drew on the gloves, which were so fit for them, that they much
commended their skill in choosing them, the transformed servingman, having done
his message, humbly taking his leave, told them he would carry their answers
to his masters.

He had not gone far, but looking behind him, he might perceive them to
be laid down on the grass, the virtue of the charm having so wrought on
them, that they were not able to go any further, and therefore yielding to
necessity, they laid them down: which he well seeing, called forth his aunt
and brother, (who stood not far off in a thicket) requiring their aid to
bear them away, but the wretched Audriana, excellently well skilled in
mischeife, feeling their breath and pulse, and perceiving all to be quiet as
she wished, stayed them with this gracious counsel.

Rash beginnings (nephews) make as untoward an ending, and a hasty bitch you
know brings but blind puppies: wise men should consider of their actions,
before they undertake them, and see what success or fear of danger they carry
with them, and not run headlong on without discretion, as if fortune must
needs favor you, howsoever you order your proceedings. I speak this
(nephews) as taxing your overhasty forwardness, in a matter of so great
moment; for what could you get by thus conveying them away, but an assured
destruction? for you would be the first that would be suspected for stealing
them, as having done it before: therefore my counsel is, that you stay till
they are buried, and then you may at pleasure take them out of the tomb, and
use them without suspicion; besides, how would my heart leap within me, if
we could by some quaint means, accuse their sweethearts of their death, and
bring them to death for it. O it would make me young again, which me thinks
were easy to be brought o pass, would you follow my counsel, and behave
your selves resolutely and like men! Not far off the two lovers are coming
hitherwards, I descried them now against they come hither, go you and raise
the officers and the people to apprehend them, as guilty of poisoning them,
which you must constantly avouch; as for my self I will not be seen in it,
that it may carry the more show of truth, and when they come to see their
sweete-heartes, they shall not only find them (as they will suppose) dead,
but also they shall be apprehended, arraigned, condemned, and executed for
their deaths, whilst you two, void of all manner of fear, may freely enjoy
the sweet embraces of your loves, and I may fat my self with joy for the happy
overthrow of two such couples.

This counsel was so well liked, that it was presently put in practice, for
the two brothers perceiving the gentlemen to be near at hand, ran in all
haste to the town, with a loud outcry, strongly accusing Cleanthes and
Polydore, for the poisoning of Callanthia and Florella, which they constantly
avouched themselves to have seen, as they went that way by chance; this
strange accident amazed all men, especially such as knew the persons that were
so taxed, yet their constant accusation of them, upon their own knowledge,
moved a belief in them, yet mixed with admiration for so rare a chance:
officers therefore and a guard being appointed, then they went directly to the
place where they found the two gentlemen, and old Clidamas (whom their outcry
had called forth) woefully lamenting the loss of two such excellent creatures,
blaming the cruelty of death and fortune, for crossing so happy a marriage, as
would have been in the conjunction of so excellent paires: seldom is it
seen, that grief goes alone, but commonly one falls upon the neck of another,
and so it was here, for the guard upon the sight of the Gentlemen, presently
apprehended them on suspicion of murder, for poisoning the two gentlewomen:
which Hormisda and Polipus (being disguised) constantly maintained to be true,
as having themselves seen the deed done.

This was strange news to the distracted lovers, and as strange it was to old
Clidamas, for though he was strongly persuaded of the integrity, and virtue
of his sons, and knew by experience, that they loved his daughters
exceedingly, yet the unmoved gesture of the accusers, his ignorance of them, as
not knowing them, made him wonder, yet could he not be persuaded; but that
they were false, and therefore he told the officers, that they were mistaken,
and took wrong persons, that the accusers eyes had deceived them, taking one
for another, that the gentlemen and his daughters were contracted together, and
within three or four days should have been married, had not this untimely
chance happened, and therefore it was not to be credited, that they should so
sudainely be changed from dying for their loves, if it should have been
denied them, to flat poisoning them, which could not be done but for a mortal
hate: but all would not do, for the accusers were instant and urge their
assertion; and the officers believed, and therefore without any more reply,
they carried them away to Palermo to prison, yet before they went, they desired
Clidamas not to believe any such report, protesting that they were, as clear
of the fact, as they were grieved for the loss of their espoused wives:
requesting moreover, that he would for their sakes, whom ever he had affected,
keep the bodies unburial, till the truth of the whole matter, should be made
manifest, this he promised to perform, so with tears on eitherside, they
departed, they to prison, and he home, with his supposed dead daughters to his
own house.

The day of trial was within two days after, which being come, and the Judges
seated according to the custom, the prisoners were placed at the bar, where
pleading not guilty, and putting themselves to the trial of the law, the
accusers were commanded to stand forth and speak, whereupon, Hormisda stood
forth, and spoke thus.

It may seem a strange matter (reverent Judges) for us, that are mere
strangers in this place, to accuse them of such eminent note as these two are
reported to be, and of a crime so monstrous and heinous, but our consciences
told us, that if we kept such a deed of darkness privy to our selves, we
should make our selves also guilty of the fact, and therefore we thought it
better to accuse them, then to carry about with our selves the tedious gripings
of a guilty conscience; for alas, what else would it have benefited us, to have
them perish? they being men so far from doing us any injury, that I know not
whether we have seen them heretofore or no, and therefore far be it from
you, to imagine that we should accuse them out of spleen or anger, whom now
first of all we know: and I would to God it had not been our hap so to have
known them, then should we perchance have been safer, and avoided the envy of
the over-affectionate multitude, for accusing them great in their favor: for
you are not ignorant my Lords, what a burden we have brought upon our selves,
we incur the malice of the people, what more violent? we adventure rude and
simple, against men of excellent eloquence and attracting rhetoric, and what
more hopeless? we undergo the sharp censure of the law, if we should be
overthrown, and what more dangerous? yet such is our settled confidence, in the
justice of our own cause, and the trust we have in your uprightness, that we
dare adventure all these, and as many more, in the discharging our souls of so
heavy a weight, as the concealing of so impious a murder

May it please your Lordships, therefore to understand, that upon the day of
this bloody deed, my friend here and my self, travailing toward Palermo, and
passing through a little grove, suddenly heard a cry, and the nearer we
appoached to it, the more perfectly we perceived it to be a woman's voice, and
therefore making have, we might sometimes by fits, hear these or some like
speeches, as gentle loves have pity on us, be not so unmercifull, to stain
your fair hands, in our innocent bloods, these words made us mend our pace, to
see if we could (as manhood willed us) save the lives of the women, from such
bloody butchers; we were no sooner come into sight, but we might behold, the
two gentlewomen (that are now dead) kneeling at the feet of these two, (men I
cannot call them) who with their daggers in one hand, and a cup of poison in
the other, stood over them with menacing looks and threatening gesture, offering
them deadly poison, or they should feel the sharpness of their merciles
daggers, which we seeing, presently cried out to them to hold their hands, and
desist from so unmercifull a deed, withal with our swords drawn offering to
enforce them, if they would not give over, but they (as we then proved, and
since have heard) being men approved in war and fights, presently grew too
hard for us, and would have charmed our tongues for ever babbling, if our legs
had been no better than our hands: but the Gods be thanked we outranne them,
and so saved our selves, they had no sooner chased us, but they returned again
to their former business; we being now safe from their swords, willing to
save the Gentlewomen, and yet not daring to come into their sight any more,
resolved that my friend should run to the town to fetch help, whilst I
getting as nere as I could, observed their actions: so we parted, and I
closely creeping along a bank, came within hearing of them, when I might hear
one of the Gentlewomen, thus speak.

Alas dear love! what chance has so suddenly converted thy earnest love, to
so deadly hate? what has poor Callanthia done, to incite Cleanthes to this
tyranny? alas my love, tell me my fault, that before I dye (if I must needs
dye) I may repent me of it if I can, if not, I may the more willingly receive
my death, as having done a fault which Cleanthes cannot forgive, To which, he
made this answer, Plague of my heart (said he) thy life is the only fault
that I find in thee, and of that I would feign purge thee, either by this
precious potion, or letting thee blood with this daggers point, and why is my
life become a fault (said she?) because whilst I live (said he) I shall
never be happy, for mine eyes have beheld so tempting a beauty, that I am dead
till thy death release me of that fond contract, that formerly I made with
thee. Nay then it is time that I were dead, (said she) that am a hinderer of
Cleanthes happiness, and is this your doom too (said the other gentlewoman to
her false friend) it is (said he) and therefore dispatch, and either drink
this poison, or feel the sharpness of my daggers point, and therewith they
thrust the cups to their mouths, holding their daggers at their breasts, but
the poor gentlewomen not knowing which to choose, and enforced to choose one;
drank the poison, and so died: often did my heart bid me to go and rescue, yet
I durst not adventure mine own life to save an others. No sooner were the two
gentlewomen cold and dead, but my friend returned with officers from the town,
but too late, for they were past all help, the two murderers no sooner
perceived them coming, but thinking no body had seen the deed done; they fell
upon the dead bodies, lamenting their deaths with many a fained sigh, and many
a tear forcibly wrung from their relentlesse eyes. Thus my Lords you have
heard the truth of all, which how strange soever it seems, yet if you consider
the force of prevailing lust, what power it has over man's affection, it will
not seem a thing impossible, for two such youg men to be overcome with lust,
and being overcome, to be drawn by it to work such outrage. Consider my Lords,
that they which could do such a villainy, could dissemble it, and they that
could so well dissemble, can as stiffely deny the fact, it being now their
only safety; for I do not think they are so fond to hope for mercy, after the
doing of an act so foul, and consider that when we would have saved them, and
could not, we do now our best endeavors to bring the actours to due
punishment, that such a vile and inhumane deed, may not want a deserved
recompense.

This he spoke with so settled and unmoved a countenance, that he possessed the
hearts of the whole bench, with a full belief of what he spoke: yet that the
custom of the law might proceed according to the custom, the prisoners were
commanded to speak for themselves, what they could, whereupon Cleanthes thus
spoke.

Were thy sword as valiant as thy tongue, I would desire these Lords that the
justice of the cause might only be decided by our swords, then would I make
thy false tongue unsay, what it has now spoken, or send thy black soul to
the lowest hell to teach those lying spirits a new way to falsehood: but since
thou have cunningly confessed thy self too weak, I scorn to offer thee a
combat, rather will I fight with thee at thine own weapon; and though my
tongue be not so voluble as thine, yet shall thee pure sincerity of my hearty
innocence, out balance the fair colors of thy slanderous rhetoric. What
ere thou art, thou art as far from my knowledge, as thy spotted soul is from
goodness, only I know thee to be false and wretched, hired it may be for
some bribe, to accuse innocent men, or if thou do it of thy self, thou art
so far below me, that I cannot imagine an occasion why thou should do
it, nor know I how to answer thee as thou deservest. To answer to his
accusation with an absolute negation, (though it were sufficient in respect of
the clearness of our consciences) yet in respect of your satisfaction (worthy
Lords) it might seem lame, as wanting due proofs to make it go upright. To
answer therefore, to this false accusation, I absolutely deny it to be false,
for consider reverent Judges, the persons accusing, men of no note, insomuch
that I think there is no man in this whole assembly, that has any knowledge of
them, so that for ought I or any man else know, they may be men of so wicked
conversation, that they are not to be believed, but of that I am not now to
dispute, next consider my Lords the persons accused, men (that if it may be
lawful for us to speak in our own praise) have also been reputed virtuous
and honest, never before tainted with the least crime, but esteemed among the
best and most virtuous people of this country, and among them not as the
underlings of all, but as men of chief note and reckoning, but that is not now
to avail us, for we are accused, and these are our accusers, but of what do
they accuse us? of the deaths of Callanthia and Florella, good Gods! how
miserable are we two of a sudden become, not only to be deprived of the
lives of our life's, our dearest spouses, but to be also accused as men so
void of grace and pity, nay of valor and manly constancy, as not only on a
sudden to hate, but also so cruelly to murder those our so dear spouses,
good Gods what should I say if this be believed! who shall be free from
slanderous accusations? whom will not desperate villains for gain or malice
dare to accuse? if it be believed that Cleanthes and Polydore were the deaths
of Callanthia and Florella, who will not fear to love, least his love should
miscarry, and he be condemned for the fault, for were they not our dearest
treasures? could we live one day from their sight? were they not our selves?
and how say you then? that Callanthia kneeled at Cleanthes his feet, begging
for mercy and could not obtain it: as if Cleanthes should have sought for
pity from himself, and been denied it, how say you that Cleanthes preferred
the beauty of another before Callanthia's, as if Cleanthes should love any ones
face more then his own, how will you persuade that Cleanthes should poison
Callanthia, as if Cleanthes should be drawn to poison himself, and how will
you make any one believe, that Polydore was of that mind too, as if Polydore
should be as mad as Cleanthes to poison himself, if you can believe this?
what will you not believe? or if you will not believe this to be false? I can
only foresee what will follow, but know not how to avoid: for we can say no
more in our defense then this, that none loved any better then we did them,
and therefore none so unlikely as we to murder them.

This speech though it were in it self true; and bred a like working in the
hearts of many, yet weighed with the others vehement asseverations, and
reproves, it seemed of small force to them that were of indifferent affection
to either, which the Judges pondring and overwaighing of the plaintiffes truth,
he proceeded to sentence in this manner.

It is a hard matter in so difficult a cause, to give a right sentence, it is
therefore the duty of the accusers, to bring in a true evidence, else it will
redound to their own shame and ignominy: consider therefore, you that are the
plaintiffes, that if you falsely accuse these gentlemen, their bloods will be
required at your hands, and you shall dearly pay for it, you also that are
here accused, if you be guilty of the crime? I would advise you openly to
confess it, and disburthen your souls of so cumbersome a trouble, as I know
the smoothering of such a sin will be, but if you know your selves innocent?
you shall be sure of an unspeakeable joy at your deaths, and that is all the
comfort I can give: for we have not eyes that can pierce into the bottomes of
men's hearts, we are to judge by the outward appearance, and according to the
evidence that is brought against you, now therefore considering, your accusers,
do here accuse you of this murder, not by mere probability, by plain
demonstration, as having themselves seen the deed done, which you do not
clear your self off, but only by certain likelihoods, as how unlikely it is
for men of your rank and quality, to do such mischeifes to persons whom you
so dearly affected, indeed it is something unlikely, but not a matter of
impossibility, and therefore hearing what either side has or can say, I think
it the safest way to judge according to the great appearance of truth.

Since therefore, you two Cleanthes and Polydore, have been here accused,
arraigned, and convicted, of the murder of Callanthia and Florella, I then
pronounce your sentence, that you be had from hence, to the great market place,
and there a scaffold being erected, you shall upon it lose your heads, and the
Gods show mercy on your souls.

The sentence was forthwith put in execution, for a scaffold being errected in
the market place, the two condemned gentlemen (with a sufficient guard) were
brought unto it, where being mounted up, they desired the officer that was
appointed to see the execution done, that he would grant them so much respite,
till they might send to the house of old Clidamas, to bring thither the bodies
of his dead daughters, that they might take their last farewell of them: to
this the officer willingly consented, and one was sent to fetch them.

Old Clidamas, who all this time had kept his house, as in suspense what should
become of his two friends, now that he heard of their condemnation, and the
message they had sent unto him, rising up and saying nothing but, O justice,
how are thy blind eyes abused! he took the dead bodies, and laid them both
upon one beer, apparrelled still as they were at first, and with them went to
the city, and coming to the scaffold, and taking his friends about the necks,
it was a good while ere tears would let him speak, at last speech made an
eruption to this purpose.

How is it, O ye Gods! that ye have no way to defend the innocent? must it
needs be that a guiltless life must be lost for a deed that some other
blondy villain has committed? if it be so then? at least grant me this boon,
that the truth of this mystery, may at one time or other be more evidently
known to all the world, that though they lose their lives, yet their fames may
live in everlasting memory: for thinks my dear Cleanthes and Polydore that I
believe this accusation? no, no, my heart is as free from any such suspicion,
as your hands and hearts I know were far from doing a deed so misbecoming
you, and may your souls take as much comfort after death, as mine is far
from thinking any harm in you. These words were spoken by him so
affectionately, that it moved all his hearers to pity and compassion, but the
gentlemen with undaunted hearts, testifying that his thoughts did not deceive
him, thanked him for his good opinion of them, nothing doubting but time would
make it more clear to be a truth infallible. And therewith they went to take
their last leaves of their dead mistresses, and therefore approaching near the
beer, and discovering their faces (which death could not rob of those innate
perfections, that liberal nature had bestowed on them in their births,
Cleanthes (while Polydore did the like to Florella) took his farewell of his
senseless Callanthia in these laments.

Could that dead tongue of thine, (O lovely corpse of my once dear Callanthia)
relate the story of thine own destruction I know it would pronounce me as
guiltless of thy death, as thou in death art beautiful, but since it has so
pleased the Gods, that those pleasing oracles are silenc't, by whose
mischievous hands I know not, let thy soul freely pardon thy Cleanthes, for
leaving thee alone when this wretched deed was done, which else my presence
might have prevented, and therefore have the Gods laid this just plague up-mee,
and I acknowledge my self, worthily to endure this shame for such a
negligence. Yet I beseech thee by those chaste kisses that often have past
between us, by those firm troth-plights, which have unfeignedly been
registered in the books of our true hearts, pardon me this fault, that when
our two souls shall meet in the happy shade of fair Elysium, mine may not be
chidden away from thine, but we may with eternity of joy, renew those loves
never to have ending there, which here are abnoxious to so many casualties,
that we may sit together hand in hand, and with a fullness of joy, recount the
laborinth of our hapless love. In the mean time, O give me leave to dew thy
cold hands, with these warm drops of love, the only tribute of my dying
constancy, and therewith he pulled of her gloves, and putting her hands to his
eyes moistened the^ with his true tears, and thus proceeded: now may you close
your selves in peace my happy eyes, having imbalm'd those precious hands of
hers, that inrich't every thing that touched her: and you pale lips of my
Callanthia, O give me leave to kiss you, and though I expect not the like
comfort from you, that I was wont to have, when (like a bold thief) I have
stolen that odoriferous breath, silently creeping through your ruby doors,
whilst mine eyes were gazing in hers, to see if they perceived me, yet let me
take of you the last kiss that I am likely ever to take from you; and
therewith laying his lips to hers, he might sensibly perceive the warm
breath come stealing forth, whereat not a little amazed, he felt again, and
still he felt it more fresh and warm, therefore calling suddenly to old
Clidamas, he bade try if he could feel nothing.

By this time the charm being removed, the vital spirits became to get the
mastry over drowsy sleep, and she began to open the fair windows of her
eyes: when looking round about her, not knowing where she was, or how she came
thither, seeing her father by her almost distracted with amazement, and her
lover standing bound before her, and herself lying dead, so the wonder had
almost made her to dye in earnest, that was before but dead in show.

You may better imagine (gentle reader) then I can any way express the
overflow of joy, that was then on all sides, but still the wonder remained, when
the gentlewomen being asked, how she came into that case? could answer
nothing, but that on such a day, a servant of Cleanthes and Polydore brought to
either of them a pair of gloves, which they had no sooner put on, but they
fell asleep, but what happened since, they knew not, this was as strange as the
rest to the two gentlemen, neither could they imagine who it should be, that
should deliver such a present in their names, yet by her words gathering that
the sleeping power lay in the gloves, they went and pulled off the gloves from
the hands of Florella, which was no sooner done, but she also awaked, to the
no little comfort of the father and the lovers, and the wonderful amazement of
all the beholders.

This sudden accident happening so contrary to their expectation, wrought as
strange an effect in Hormisda and Polipus, for seeing the exceeding affection,
and extremity of joy these lovers welcomed one another with, as if they had
been raised indeed from death to life, they presently turned from their
malicions purposes, not only resolutely determining never to use any more ways
to hinder their happiness, but also angry with themselves for having done such
a deed, as denied them any part in this generallity of joy, and therefore that
they might testify their penitence, by an open cnofession of so open a crime,
they came before them upon the scaffold, and discovered themselves, and
earnestly entreated their pardons, truly discovering the whole course of their
proceedings, desiring them, that as they themselves had tasted the effects of
love, they would so consider the like in them, and judge of them with what
lenity and charity they could, this news coming to the governors ear, who
presently coming to the place, and hearing the story related again, set the
two gentlemen at liberty, and committed Hormisda and Polipus, and the
mischeivous Audriana to close prison, till it should be known what should
further be done with them.

These things being finished, Clidamas with his lovely company returned home,
and as soon as the appointed day came, the two couples consumated their joys
in a happy marriage, all the day was spent in variety of delight and pleasure,
and the most part also of the night, which being ended, every one prepared to
bed-ward, when presently they were stayed by a gallant sound of cornets, but we
must return a while to our Sicilians on the sea.

So long they sailed, till they arrived at Sicily, not long before this
marriage, they went presently to the governor, and showing their letters, they
were according as their dignity required, entertained with him, they stayed
till they had learned as much as they desired, wherefore hearing their father
lived, and their sisters were shortly to be married to such worthy men, they
determined to reveal themselves at the wedding in some grateful manner, for
which purpose they thought a masque to be the fittest means, and therefore
discovering to the governor what they were, and their whole determination,
they requested him to furnish them with gentlemen fit for such a business,
which he both for their own sakes, whom by this little acquaintance he
began to affect, as also for the express commandment of the king to use them
nobly, as also for his own liking of the plot performed accordingly.

In the mean time, diverse firm reports had been brought to the governor, by
the keepers of the prison, that Hormisda and Polipus were wonderful penitent
for their former offenses, never ceasing night and day to punish themselves,
with abstinence and tears, so that it was wonderful to see those men, that
were but a little before, so obdurate in wickedness, to be now so penitent for
their obdurateness. These news made the Governor much compassionate them, and
considering that their fact, howsoever heinous, could not in law find with
death, and willing to nourish virtue in so good beginnings, and if it might
be, to beget a friendship between them and the other, he thought it would
not be amiss, to prefer them to be actours in the masque, as knowing them to
be men not unskilful in such qualities, and therefore first revealing his
intents to the brothers, who readily consented to it, he sent for them, and
told them of his determination, which they with a multitude of thank embraced,
as a most gracious favor.

Every thing being prepared for the purpose, they came into the bride-house,
with a noise of cornets in this manner. First entered, bearing torches four
water-nimphs in long garments of blue silk, fringed with silver, and wrought
about the borders with green weeds growing in the water, after the followed
Triton, in a garment of silverplate, wrought like unto fishes scales, his bases
were of blue taffata powdered with scolap-shells, on his head he wore a cap
made after the fashion of a scolap-shell, the rest whereof was a dolphin,
bearing the great musition Arion on his back, to show that fish has delight in
music, in his hand he carried a trumpet, made of a rams-horn, after him came a
set of cornets, apparelled in scales, and blue silk bases, after them more
torch-bearers like the former, after them two pages, attired in watchet satin,
curiously embroidered with gold and pearls, upon their legs, buskins of white
spanish leather, spotted with gold, and tied together with white riband,
between them they bore a little table, wherein was curiously painted the whole
story of the two gentlemen, from their shipwreck, to their return to Spain
from Tunis, that which went before as their stealing by Pirates they left out,
least the thing might be too soon known, and the fullness of joy might be
anticipated, after them followed Neptune in a garment of seagreen, curiously
set with rubies and diamonds, so that they seemed like the shining of the
start, when one beholds them in the water, the skirts of his garment was
embroidered with white, prettily resembling the foame which the sea makes, when
it meets with the resisting shore, upon his head hoe wore a silver crescent, to
show his obedience to that planet, on his shoulder, he bare his tride^t of
silver, set with saphires and jaspires, and others gems of the the like value,
on either side of him came two gentlemen, alike attired in crimson velvet
cunningly embroidered with blue silk, in the fashion of a net, and here and
there intermixed with little fishes, in which the workman had showed such
skill, that as the garment moved, the fishes seemed to dance and lea pin the
net, showing the wearers to be gallant fishermen, and posing the beholders, to
judge whether the richnes of the robe, or the excellency of the work were to
be prefered, after them followed two sea-gods, in garments of skie-coloured
satin, embroidered with silver and pearl, last of all followed four
torch-bearers like the former, in this manner they came into the room, where
the Pages delivering up their tablet to the brides The masquers prepared
themselves for the first measure, which was performed in most exquisite manner
to the sound of cornets, that being done certain loose dances passed between
the masquers and the gentlewomen, and they being finished, they addressed
themselves to the second measures, at the end whereof, sorting themselves as
they were at their entrance, Triton spoke in this manner.

Lo from the watery bed of Amphitrite,
Neptune himself comes to adorn this night,
Attended by his sea- Gods, and relates,
By me his herald Triton, the strange fates
Of these two gallants, hither come to know,
Whether they may be entertained or no.
Two children erst stolen from the Italian shore
Were shipwrackt on the waters, but before
The angry waves could bring relentles death.
Neptune commands the Winds with gentle breath,
To waft them to the land, where they were found
By a poor fisher, walking on the ground,
Who kept them with him, till in tract of time
The King sent for them, where their youthful prime
Was spent in virtuous actions, doing things
Worthy such men, as are observed by Kings.
But after many noble deeds of fame,
They now return to Italy again,
But first they came to honor this fair night,
And beauteous brides, preferring their delight
Before their private purposes, but yet
Their father here beholds them, which may get
A milder censure for them, but before
We proceed further. You whose aged boar
Crowns your fair head with silver, must be wrought
To answer to a question. These have brought
Neptune and we to wait on them tonight,
Before they glad their father with their sight.
The question is, whether in doing so,
They have deserved a reproof or no?
All this while Clidamas at musing on the manner of this story, entertaining
thoughts of his lost sons, he knew it was not impossible for the Gods to
preserve them, and the words of the speech lively pointed out their history,
only their country danted him, but that he thought might be a trick of poetry
to say one thing and mean another, yet would he not give too much to his
fancy, least proving contrary, it might prove to his greater grief, and
perceiving Triton to have finished with that request, he thus returned his
answer,

To answer you in your own Poetical strain, (trust me gentle Triton) is more
then my tired brain can perform, such fancies rather fits young heads, then
such frostbitten trees as I am, but yet not to send you away without your
answer, thus in plain dunstable prose I give my verdit, that if the gentleme^s
father be here in presence (as you say he is) they do not only deserve no
reproof, but also commendations, in choosing a time to reveal themselves in,
which will make the fullness of joy the more, by how much the company of
participators will be greater.

This judgment given, they all forthwith unmask't themselves, and Hormisda (who
had with his vizar put off Neptune) taking the two gentlemen in his hands, came
with them before old Clidamas, and kneeling before him, spoke in his own
person thus.

I cannot blame you to wonder to see us, that were but a little before your
deadly enemies, so rudely to press into your presence, but we trust that as
our penitent tears have made our peace in heaven with those powers above, so
this gift which we here present to you, will beget a friendly league of amity
between us, that were once such mortal foes. Know then that Italy is turned
to Sicily, and these two Italian gentlemen, are become to be Martuvio and
Roderigo, the two lost sons of Sicilian Clidamas, stolen in their nonage by
Pirates, and since passing such fortunes, as they themselves can better then I
relate unto you, and therefore if you mean to stand to your own judgment, it
is your part to welcome, as their wisdom in so fit a time electing deserves.

The good old man hearing this, and perceiving plainly, that his former
thoughts proved true prophets of what ensued, he arose presently and running to
them, he caught them about the necks, crying out are ye come, more he would
have spoke, but his overflowing joy, breaking into whole floods of tears,
stopped his utterance, long it was ere he revived out of this ecstasy, at last
remembering himself, and giving them his blessing, he turned to Hormisda and
Polipus, greatly rejoicing at their good conversion, and thanking them for so
gracious a present, and entertaining them most willingly into his friendship,
whilst in the mean time the new come strangers, were welcomed of their
sisters and their new brothers in law, and by course of the whole assembly, a
firm league also of never dying amity was concluded betwixt the bridegromes
and the two converted brothers,

All this joy was poison to the envious Audriana, who seeing the good success
of her enemies, and that her nephews also had forsaken her, and lothed her for
her wickedness, malice and envious spleen so wrought on her, that of mere
spite she died, her death was not only not lamented of any, but also came as a
happy news to the whole company, especially to her nephews, as not knowing
the strength of their new resolution, if it should be battred by the force of
her inveterate malice.

In this fashion they lived together sometime, til their urge^t affairs called
Martuvio and Roderigo to keep promise with the king, taking leave of father,
brothers, and sisters, and returning into Spain, where they lived in much
renown and glory. Whilst old Clidamas lived among his sons and daughters,
till he saw himself made a grandfather by them, and then paying his due debt
to extorting nature, he left many weeping eyes for his death, and was in much
honor buried by his sons in law, who long after with their fair wives, lived
in joy and felicity, making of an involved laborinth of growing love, a most
happy and fortunate conclusion.
