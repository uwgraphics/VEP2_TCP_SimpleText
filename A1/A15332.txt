XIX.
^ALas, what a wretched life is this, Nay, what a death, Where the tyrant ^Loue
commands? My flouring days are in their prime declining, All my proud

are fly- ing, And leave me dying, For her that skornes my crying: ^O she from
hence departs, *My Love refraining, For whom all ^hartles, A- las, I dye
complaining.

me glad and sorry, and sorry, Out of thy golden quiver: take thou thy
^strongest arrow, *That will through bone and marrow, * ^And me and thee, *And

From hills and ^dales, From hills and dales in my dull ears still ringing.

The second part. XXVII.
^MY throat is sore, my voice is horse with skriking: with skriking, ^ *My
rests, are sighs, *Deep from the heart root fetched: My song runs ^all on

^stretched: *out stretched: Thus still, and still I sing, And near am
^linning: Thus still, and still I sing, and near am linning: * ^For still the
close, points to my first beginning. Thus still and still I sing, * ^and near

you wrought, See, what you wrought, by your disdaining, * ^See what you wrought
by your dis- dayning, Causeless I die, Love ^still attending, Your hopeles
pity, pity of my complaining: Your hopeles pity of my ^complaining, Suffer
those eyes which thus have slain me, *With ^speed, to end their killing
power: So shall you prove how Love does pain me: ^And see me dye, And see
me dye still yower.

time while thou mai'st, Least when thou would thou mai'st not* ^O take time
while thou mai'st, *Least when thou would, thou mai'st ^not. If love shall

me, that I were young a- ^gaine; And so repent thee. O me, that I were young

you wrought, by your disday-ning, See, what you wrought, by your dis- ^dayning,
See what you wrought by your disday- ning, Causeless I die, Love ^still
attending, Your hopeles pity of my complaining: Suffer those eyes which thus

JOHN WILBYE.

AT LONDON: Printed by Thomas Este. 1598.

TO THE RIGHT Worshipful and vallerous Knight Sir Charles Cauendish.
RIGHT Worshipful and renoumed Knight: It has happened of late, I know not
how; whether by my folly, or fortune, to commit some of my labors to the
press. Which (the weaker the work is) have more need of an Honorable Patron.
Every thing persuades me, (though they seem not absolute) that your
Countenance is a sufficient warrant for them against sharp tongues and
unfriendly censures; Knowing your rare virtues, and honorable accomplishments
to be such: as may justly challenge their better regard and opinion, whom it
shall please you to Patronize. If perchance they shall prove worthy your
patronage: My affection, duty, and good will, bind me rather to Dedicate them
to you, then to any other: both for the reverence, and honor I owe to all
other your most singular virtues; and especially also for your excellent skill
in Music, and your great love and favor of Music. There remains only
your favorable acceptance, which humbly craving at your hands, with
protestation of all duty, and service: I humbly take my leave. From the
Augustine Friars the XII. of April. 1598.

Your Worships: ever most bounden and dutiful in all humility. John Wilbye.

TO THE RIGHT Worshipful and vallerous Knight Sir Charles Cauendish.
RIGHT Worshipful and renoumed Knight: It has happened of late, I know not
how; whether by my folly, or fortune, to commit some of my labors to the
press. Which (the weaker the work is) have more need of an Honorable Patron.
Every thing persuades me, (though they seem not absolute) that your
Countenance is a sufficient warrant for them against sharp tongues and
unfriendly censures; Knowing your rare virtues, and honorable accomplishments
to be such: as may justly challenge their better regard and opinion, whom it
shall please you to Patronize. If perchance they shall prove worthy your
patronage: My affection, duty, and good will, bind me rather to Dedicate them
to you, then to any other: both for the reverence, and honor I owe to all
other your most singular virtues; and especially also for your excellent skill
in Music, and your great love and favor of Music. There remains only
your favorable acceptance, which humbly craving at your hands, with
protestation of all duty, and service: I humbly take my leave. From the
Augustine Friars the XII. of April. 1598.

Your Worships: ever most bounden and dutiful in all humility. John Wilbye.

Out of thy golden qui- uer: Take thou thy strongest arrow, That ^will through

^care, and me, Kill care, and me, Kill care and me, Kill care, and me,

^MY throat is sore, my voice is horse, *with ^skriking, My rests, are sighs,
*Deep from the heart root fetched: My song runs ^all on sharps, and with often
striking, time on my breast, *I shrink, I ^shrink, I shrink with hands out
stretched: *Thus still, and still I ^sing, And near am linning: *And near am

sweetly her importune, That I from my Ca- ^listo best beloved, As you and she
set down, be never moved, As you and she set down, ^ *be never moved, And
love, to Carimel see you commend me, * ^Fortune for his sweet sake, *may
chance befriend ^mee. Fortune for his sweet sake, may chance befriend me.

So shall my love seem greater, And I shall love the better, So shall my ^loue
seem greater, And I shall love the better, And I shall love, And I shall love

then I know you love ^mee, you love me, That so you may disprove me. Nay then
I know you love ^mee, you love me, Nay then I know you love me, you love me,
That so you may ^disproue me.

III.
^AY me, Can every rumor, Thus start my Ladies humor? Aye me, ^Can every
rumor, Thus start, *my Ladies humor? Name ye some gallant to ^her; why
straight forsooth I woe her, then burst she forth in passion, You men love but
for ^fashion, You men love but for fashion, Yet sure I am that no man, Yet sure

women be con- ^tra-ry. Yet sure I am that no man, Yet sure I am that no man,

^WHat needs all this travail and turmoyling, Shortning the ^lyfes sweet
pleasure, Shortning the lyfes sweet pleasure. To seek this far fetched
^treasure, this far fetched treasure, To seek this far fetched treasure, * ^In
those hot clymates, In those hot cly- mates, ^Vn-der Phoebus broyling.

The second part. VIII.
^O Fools, can you not see a traffic nearer, In my sweet Ladies ^face, *Where
Nature shows, what ever treasure eye sees, or heart ^knoweth? Rubies and
Diamonds dainty, Rubies and Diamonds dainty, And orient ^Perles such plenty,
Corrall and Ambergris, sweeter and deerer, Corrall and Amber- ^gris, sweeter
and deerer, Then which the South seas or Moluccas lend us, Then ^which the
South seas or Moluccas lend us, or either Indies, East or West, do send us*

IX.
^ALas, what hope of speeding, Where hope beguild lies bleeding; She bad ^come,
when she spide me: And when I came she flide me, she flyde me, Thus ^when
I was beguiled, *She at my sighing smiled. But if you take ^such pleasure, of
hope and joy my treasure, *By deceit to bereave ^me, *By deceit to bereave
me, *Love me and so deceive ^mee. Love me and so deceive me.

X.
^LA-dy, when I behold, the Roses sprouting, La-dy, when I be- ^hold, the To-

sprite, ^a walking sprite, And Love is this and that, *And O I wot not what, ^
*And comes and goes again, I wot not whether, And comes and ^goes again, I

^DYE hapless man, *Since she denies thee grace. Dye hap- ^lesse man, *Dye and
despair, since she does scorn to love thee: Fare- ^well most fayer, though
thou do fayer deface, *Since for my ^duteous love, thou do reprove me: Since
for my duteous love, thou do reprove ^mee. Those smiling eyes, that sometimes
me revived, Those smiling eyes, that sometimes ^mee reui- ued, Clowded with
frowns, have me of life de- priued.

^I Fall, I fall, O stay me, *Dear love with ^ioyes ye slay me, *Of life
your lips deprive me, de- ^priue me, Sweet, let your lips revive me, Sweet
let your lips revive me: O ^whether are you ha- sting, and leave my life thus
wasting? My health on you re- ^lyeing, on you relyeing, It Were sin to leave
me dyeing. My health on you re- ^lyeing, on you relyeing, It Were sin to leave
me dyeing, to leave me dyeing.

The second part. XV.
^AND though my love abou^ding, did make me fall a sounding, ^ ^Yet I am well
contented, Still so to be tormented: Still ^so to be tormented: Yet am I well
contented, still so to be tormented: ^And death can ne-uer fear me, As long
as you are near me. And ^death can ne- uer fear me, As long as you are
near me.

The first part. XVI.
^I Allwaies beg, Yet ne- uer am relieved: I always beg, I al- ^waies beg, Yet
never am relieved: I grieve, because my griefs are not believed: ^I grieve,
because my griefs are not believed: I cry aloud in vain, My voice out
^stretched, my voice out stretched, And get but this, Mine Ecco calls me
wretched. ^ *Mine Ecco calls me wretched.

The second part. XVII.
^THus Love commands, That I in vain complain me, That I in ^vaine
complain me: In vain complain me: And sorrow will, That she shall ^still
disdain me: That she shall still disdain me: Yet did I hope, Which hope my
^life prolonged, To hear her say A-las, Alas his Love was wronged.

XVIII.
^LAdy, your words do spite me, your words do spite me, Yet ^your sweet
lips, so soft, kiss and delight me: kiss and delight me, Your deeds my heart
sur- ^charg'd with ouerioying: Your taunts my life destroy- ing. * ^Since both
have force to spill me, Let kisses sweet, Sweet kill me, * ^Knights fight
with swords and lances, Fight you with smiling glaun- ces: So like ^Swans of
Leander, my ghost from hence shall wander, Singing and dying. Singing and dying.

XIX.
^ALas, what a wretched life is this? Nay, what a death, Where the tyrant ^Loue
commands? My flouring days are in their prime decli- ning, All my proud
^hope, quite fallen, and life vntwining: My joys each after other, *In ^hast
are fly- ing, And leave me dying, For her that skornes my crying: O ^she from
hence departs, *My Love refraining, For whom all hartles, A- ^las, I dye
complaining.

XX.
^VNkinde, O stay thy flying, Unkind, And if I needs must dye, ^pitty me
dying: But in thee, my heart, my heart, my heart is lying, And no death, ^can
assail me, Alas till life does fail thee, till life does fail thee, O
therefore, If the ^Fates, bid thee be fleeting, Stay for me, whose poor heart,
thou have in keeping. O there- ^fore, If the Fates bid thee be fleeting, Stay
for me, whose poor heart thou have ^in kee-ping.

XXI.
^I Soung sometimes my thoughts and fancies pleasure, Where then I ^list, or
time served best and leisure, While Daphne did inuit me, To supper once, And
^dranck to me to spite me. I smild yet still did doubt her, And dranck where
^she had dranck before, *to flout her. But o while I did eye her, ^ *But o
while I did eye her, Mine eyes dranck Love, my lips dranck ^burning fi-er. My
lips dranck burning fi-er. But o while I did eye her, * ^But o while I did eye
her, Mine eyes dranck Love, my lips dranck burning ^fi-er. My lips dranck
burning fi-er.

XXII.
^FLo-ra gave me fairest flowers, none so fayer, * *In ^Floras treasure, none
so faier, * *In Floras treasure: These I plast on ^Phillis Bowers, She was
pleased, She was pleased, And she my pleasure: Smiling ^meadowes seem to say,
Come ye wantons, here to play. Come ye wantons, ^heere to play, Come ye
wantons, here to play, Come ye wantons, here to ^play. Come here to play.
Come ye wantons, here to play, *Come ^Come ye wantons, here to play.

^SWeet Love: If thou will gain a Monarchs glory, Subdue her heart, who ^makes
me glad and sorry. Out of thy golden quiver, Take thou thy strongest ar- ^row,
That will through bone and marrow: *And me and thee, ^And me and thee, * *of

A-las poor Love, Then thou art ^woe begone thee.

From ^hills and dales in my dull ears still ringing.

The second part. XXVII.
^MY throat is sore, my voice is horse with skriking: My rests, are ^sighes,

beginning. Thus ^still and still I sing, and near am linning: For still, the

end their killing power: So shall you prove, how love does pain me: ^And see
me dye, me dye, still yower.
