David's Psalter / diligently and faithfully translated by George Joy / with
brief Arguments before every Psalm / declaringe the effect thereof.

Psalm.cxx. Lord / deliver me from lyinge lips and from a deceaitful tongue



The Argument.
The description and praise of the Godly: the ungodly setforthe agenst him.

OH / how blessed is the man / that goith not to counsel with the ungodly:
nor abides not in the way of the wiked / nether sits not down in the
chaier with the perverse pestelent skorners.

But delyteth in the law of the Lord: and in it / has his meditacion day
and night.

This man is like the tree planted by the river side: which yildeth forth her
fruit in her time.

Whose leaves fall not down: all her fruit plentuously prospers But contrary
wise it comes unto the ungodly: for they be like the duste dispersed of the
wind.

Wherefore / the sinful ungodly: may not live in the fellowship and
congregation of the just.

For as the way of the just pleases the Lord: even so does the way of the
ungodly perish.

The Argument.
A prophecye of Criste to be anointed king over the Gentilis: But first the
furiouse uproar and vain enforcements of his enymes both of Gentyles and Iwes
is described.

SE how the gentiles grinne? se how the people enforce al in vain.

The kings of the world run together: and the cheiftens swarm on heapis
agenst the lord and his anointed.

Sainge / let us break their bonds and cast of their yokis from us.

But he that dwells in heaven derideth them: it is the lord that skorneth
them.

In his furiouse wrath therefore: thus he troubles and speaks unto them.

I shall verily anoint my king: over zion my holy hill

I shall enstruck him in the law of the lord: and even thus do I affirm of
him / Thou art my son / this day have I begoten the.

Ask of me / and I shall give the the gentiles for thine enheritaunce: and even
the vttermoste coostes of the world shall be thy nowne possession.

Whom thou shall correcke with an yerne staff: and break like an erthen vessel.

Wherefore ye kings se that ye be wise: and receive disciplyne / O iuges of the
earth.

That ye may give the lord his honor: and serve him ioyously with reverent
fear.

And that ye may embrase the son / lest he being wrath / ye perish for
your mischief.

For his anger shall be shortly kindled: and then / oh how blessed are they that
trust in him.

The Title of the Psalm. The song of David as touching the fleinge from his
son Absalon.ii. Reg. xv.xvi. etc.
Domine quid.

Psalm. 3.
WHat a multitude are they (oh Lord) that trouble me? what a mayney make
insurreccion agenst me?

What a multitude are they / that thus say by me? God will never help nor
save him. No More he will
Sela.

When it is thou lord that fightest for me: even my glory which liftest up my
head.

I cry therefore loud unto thel orde: and he hereth me from his holy hill.

And now I lay my self down to sleep: and the lord sustayninge me / I rise
agene.

I fere not thousandis of the people / although they close me in rownd about.

For thou lord my god shall stepe sorthe to save me: thou shall smite the
chawnes of all my enemes and break to pouldre the tethe of the ungodly.

Health and salvation are thine oh Lord: power forth therefore thy goodness upon
thy people.

The Title of the Psalm. 4. David's song adhortatorye played upon the musik
instruments.
The Argument.
An exhortacion unto godlynes and innoce^cye / the ungodly are blamed / and the
felicite of the godly is declared.

OH god my rightwisnes which herest me cryinge unto the: and being in
distress thou set me forth at large / have mercy upon me and here my
prayer.

O men mortal / how long (my gloriouse majesty co^tempned) will ye love lies
and seek vanite? ever:
Sela Whem will ye acknowledge that the Lord delyuerth whom he loves? the lord
/ when I cry upon him he hereth me.

Trimble for fere and sin not: be take your selves to sweet meditacions in
your beddys with silence.

Offer up the sacrifices of innocencye: and trust unto the Lord. This
multitude was wont to say / who will do us good? when it is even thou Lord /
which have expressed the light of thy presence upon us.

Whereby thou have powered a greter gladness into my heart / then they can have in
all the rich encrese of their wheat and wine.

In sauegarde therefore and peace shall I lie down and sleep: for thou lord
only geuest me a suer habitacion.

The Title of the Psalm. David his song adhortatorye / concerning the
heretages.
The Argument.
The description of two heretages / and the end of either of them.

Hear my wordis lord: and understand my thought.

Attend unto the voice of my cryinge / oh king and my God: For before the I
make my supplicacion.

Erly in the morninge here my voice Lord: for erly dress I my self unto the
in my contemplacion.

For thou art God / whom no ungodliness plesethe: with who^ the malign
dwells not.

In thy presens the violent abides not: thou hate al workers of myscheif.

Thou destroyest liars: blodye and fraudelent thou aborrest oh lord But I /
animated with thy manyfolde goodness / am comen unto thy housse: I adoure in thy
holy temple / reverently feringe the.

Led me Lord in thy rightewisenes defensed from my adversaries: and prepare
thy way before me.

For the trwthe is not in their mouths / they are corrupted within: their
throat is an open grave / but with their tongue they flater.

Dampne them o god / let them fall at their own counsails / cast them out for
their own manifold myscheif / for they are rebellious agenst the.

But contrary wise / al men might rejoice that trust in the: they might
evermore be glad / thou being their defender.

They might rejoice all in the: which worship thy name.

For thou lord art gracious unto the just: and with thy favor defendest him
as with a bukler.

The Title of the Psalm 6. The song adhortatorye of David played of the ten
stringed instrument.
The Argument.
Longanimite prayth / complayninge her desire to be differred / but at the last
she gives thankis for that she is herd / and that her enimes begin to be
confounded

Lord / rebuke me not I pray the in thy wrath: nether chastise me not in
thine anger.

Have mercy on me Lord / for I am sike: hele me / Lord / for I am al in
despair.

For even my soul is grievously tempted: but thou lord / how long ceassest?

Turn the Lord to deliver my soul: and save me for thy goodness. For among
the dampened / there is none that remember the: in hell who is he (thinkeste thou)
that ca^ praise the?

I labor in wailinge / I wasshe my bed every night: and wet my pillowe with my
teris.

My sight is lost with heuye moorninge: I am witherd up among so many mine
enymes.

But now ye shall avoid fro me / o al ye sinful: for it is the Lord that
has herd the noise of my wepinge.

The lord has herd me his suppliaunt: the Lord has received my prayer.

They shall be shamed and sore troubled all that are my enemies: they shall be
turned back and confounded suddenly.

The Title of the Psalm. Thindignacion of David / which he sange upon the fact
of Chus the son of Iemini.
The Argument.
Hetestifieth his innocencye / he commytteth his iniurye unto the rightwyse
judge / and shows him not to sleep.

Lord my god / in the do I trust: save me from all that persecute me / and
deliver me.

Lest they rauessh and tere me in pesis like a lyo^: for there is none else to
deliver me.

Lord my god / if I did this thing: if this fault be found in me:

If I have hurted them again that hurted me: If I have unjustly spoiled mine
enemy:

Then let my enemy persuwe me and take me / and trede me down under his fete:
ye let him thruste my glory in to the dirte. Let him so do
Sela. Arise and be borne up lord with thy wrath and indignacion agenste my
adversaries / and perform that vengeance that thou have promised.

That the congregation of the people might be gathered together: even for their
sakes / yet be thou exalted agene.

Oh lord the aue^ger of the people aue^ge me according to mine innocencye and
pure lyuinge.

Leasse (I prayethe) the malignite of the ungodly: vndersette the just / oh
rightwyse god enseer of hertis and raynes.

As for my suernes I refer it to god / of whom I receive it: which
preserves the right in heart.

God thauenger is just: god threteneth at al times.

If we turn not / lo / he shakes his sword: he bends his bow redye to
shote.

He recheth him his weapens redye to slaye: he heateth his arowe headis the
more grievously to wound.

Lo / this aduersarye traueleth groninge forth a monster: for he has conceived
labourouse affliccion / and will be delivered of a lie.

He has cutforth and dug up a dyke: and is fallen into his own pit.

For his own miserable mischief shall fall into his own neck / and his heuye
miserye shall light upon his own head.

I thank the Lord for his rightwisnes: and I shall praise the name of the
lord which of al is the highest.

The Title of the Psalm. 8. The song adhortatorye of David to give thankys at
their wine pressinge or grapes gatheringe
Lord / our lord / how marvelous is thy majesty thorowout all the earth:
which extolleth thy praise unto the stars.

Which praise and strength with all / thou have put even into the mouths of
soukinge infantis: in that thou ledest away captyue thy enymes and take
vengeance of thy adversaries.

When I consider the heuens the work of thy fingers: the moon and starris
which thou haste made:

Then think I / oh what a creature is man that thou thus rememberst him? what
thing is man mortal that thou thus regardest him?

Thou have made him but little inferior unto god: thou have crowned him with
glory and honor. Thou have made him Lord over the works of thy handis: and
subdewed al things unto his fete.

Both sheep and al oxen: with all the beasts of the field.

Fowlis of the air / fisshes of the sea: and what soever swymmeth there in.

Oh lord / our lord / how meruelouse is thy gloriouse majesty through out all the earth.

The Title of the Psalm. The song adhortatorye of David / called the increase
of the son
The Argument.
The thankis geuinge of David which here for his exaltacion and restoringe unto
his seat royal prayseth god.

I Shall praise the (Oh Lord) with all my heart: and preche forth thy
meruelouse factis.

I shall be glad and rejoice in the / magnifyinge thy name right highelye.

Because mine enemy is fled back: he is fallen and destroyed by thy power.

For thou have delivered me and give sentence with me / settinge me at last in
my seat royal / oh just judge.

Thou hold down the haithen thou destroyest the wicked / and que^chest
their name for ever.

Thou take away clean the hard and sharp weape^s of our enimys / thou
cuttest away cytes: that with their fall their name be forgoten.

But the Lord reigns everlasting: which has prepared his seat roial to
observe equite.

He tempereth the world with rightwisnes: and ministers trwe judgment unto
the people.

The lord is a salfe sanctuary to the oppressed / and a refugye in the time of
distress.

And for this cause / all that know thy name cleave unto the: for thou
forsakest the^ not that seek the (oh lord.

Praise the Lord which dwells in zion: put the people in mind of his
counsels.

For he holds in mind the blood of the oppressed: he enquirethe for it / he
forgeteth not their cry^ge Lord thou art merciful / and intent unto the
trouble done to me of my enemies: and thou delyuerest me from the power of death.

That I might layeforth thy high praise in zion: and rejoice in thy sauinge
health.

When even contrary / the heithen be drowned in their own mischief / which
they invented: and their fete taken in their own net which they have bente.

The lord makes his judgment known: in that he trappeth the sinner taken in
his own snare. So he does.
Sela. Oh / praise worthy perpetual.

The ungodly go their way unto hell / and all heithen that forget god. But the
poor adflicte shall never be fo^goten: nether shall the expectacion of these
poor forsaken be frustrate.

Arise lord that this man prevail not: let these haithen be condemned before
the.

Smite them with soden fear / that they might know them selves to be but men
mortal. So do.
Selah.

Psalm. x. after the Hebrws
HOw now happens it oh lord that thou art gone away so far from us? will thou be hid in time of anxte and affliccion?

The poor perissheth at the wealy pride of the ungodly: Oh would god they were
once taken in their own conspyrisons which they so craftily conspire.

The ungodly makes a gaude at the fulfillinge of his mischeuous intent: the
thief and he that blasphemeth the lord are praised.

This ungodly is so proud that he regards nether his theft nor blasphemy:
for in all his myscheuous deuyses / he thinks not once of god.

Al his ways at all time are profane / thy iugementes are taken out of his
sight / all his enemies he contempneth.

For eue^ thus has he determined with him self: I will pass over no time
without malice and myscheif.

His execrable mouth is full of cursinge / fr^ude and desaite: under his tongue
there sits miserable affliccion and heuey miserye.

He laith awayte ever with out for land and town / he hunteth preuely to
slaye the innocent / his eyes are set fast upon the goers fore bye.

He lays awayte bente like a lyo^ at the mouth of his den / he waytethe to
rob the poor / to souke him up drawn into his net.

He smyteth him / he makes him full feeble and weak: and casts down with his
tyranny the goers forebye.

For thus thinks he: god knows it not / for he tourneth away his face and
will never se it.

But Lord god therefore arise: stretche forth thy hand / and forget not these
poor oppressed.

Wherefore shall the ungodly contempne god: and think in his heart that thou
carest not / nor regardest not our affliccion?

Se therefore and look upon it: for thou art he that consyderest our heuye and
sorrowful affliccion

Our enemies with our grievous iniurye might be taken up into thy hand: unto
thy soucour is left the poor sely forsaken / thou helpest the soucourlesse.

Break the strength of the maliciouse ungodly: that he might perisshe together
with his own ungodliness.

It is the lord that abides king for ever: when al heithen perisshe from
out of the earth.

Here (Lord) the desyer of the pore afflicte: give ear unto their breasts.

Avenge the pore sely forsaken: lest this mortal man here after be so bold as
thus cruellye again to oppress him.

The Title of the Psalm. The exhortacion of David.
The Argument.
As constant faith is never without temptacion / so is it never overcome.

My confidence is in the lord. How then now shall ye say unto me / get the
hence anon swyftlyer then the bird into the hills?

For lo / the ungodly bend their bow and set their arows theryn preuely to
smite the pure in heart Utterly to destroy them: and who there shall the just
turn him self to go?

The lord that is in his holy temple: the lord whose seat royal is in heaven
looks upon this: he sercheth and beholds narowly the sons of men.

The lord beholds the rightuouse / but the sinful ungodly he utterly hates.

He rayneth snaris upon sinners: fire / brimstone / storm and tempeste are the
cup that he geuethe them to drink.

For the rightwyse Lord louethe rightwisnes: his chere is intent and given to
equite.

The Title of the Psalm. 12. The song of David adhortatorye to be sunge at the
musik instrument.
The Argument
He complains of the open unfaithful delinge. He prays for the destruction
of the unfaithful and fal^e chirch / because that where so reign these vain
ungodly / there ^re all full of myscheyf / and wyc^ednes.

Lord help: for holiness is lost: faithfulness is gone from the chylderne of
men.

They be but vain lies that one ^elleth another: it is but flaterye and
^lauerye speech that every heart ^magineth.

The lord might cut al these flateringe tongues out of their proud mouths:

Which say / let us stablyssh with ^utorite our own tongues: let us steke to
our own lips: and then who shall be lordis over us?

For the calamite of the oppressed and wailinge of the poor / I will arise
says the lord / I shall restore him to health and renyue him. The speches of
the Lord are pure speches / purified and purged by fire from the earth /
melted and tried unto the uttermost.

Thou Lord therefore hold them from us: keep us for ever from this kind of
men.

For all are full of the ungodly / where vanite is exalted among the children of
men.

The Title of the Psalm. 13. The song of David adhortatorye.
The Argument.
The prayer of a pacyently long sufferer

Vsquequo domine.

Psalm. 13.
How long will thou forget me (lord? will thou forget me for ever? how
long will thou hyd thy face from me?

How long shall I reuolue thoughtis in my mind? how long shall this
laborouse heaviness waaste my heart? how long shall this enemy be exalted over
me?

Behold and help lord god: illumine my eyes / lest I sleep in death. And let
not mine enemy say / I prevailed agenst him: lest if I be moved from my place
/ my troublouse adversaries rejoice.

For I will cleue unto thy merciable goodness / my heart hoppeth for joy at the
coming of thy sauinge health / that I might praise the when thou have given it
me.

The Title of the Psalm. 14. An exhortatorye song of Dauyd.
The Argument.
He complayneth of al men to be sinners and that the time shall come that the
ungodly shall dye for fere / but unto the godly there shall come a plentuouse
joy from that heavenly zyon.

THe vain folysshe think in their hertis / that god is not god: they follow
corrupt and execrable studyes / there is none that does good.

When the Lord should look forth from heaven upon the children of men to see
whether there were any that understood or regarded God:

He saw that all were gone from him / al alyke together were corrupted / there
was none that did good no not won.

Have they understanding which are al given unto mischief? which devour my
people like meat? yea / which call not upon the lord?

Then therefore shall they tremble: when god standinge on the just mennis side
/ shall say unto them. ye made but a mock at the counsayl of the pore: but yet
is the lord his hope.

Who shall give Israel his sauinge health from zion? When the Lord shall bring
home again his people: Jacob shall rejoice and Israel shall be right glad

The Title of the Psalm. 15. The song of David.
The Argument.
The heretage and life of the godly in this world.

Lord who may dwell in thy tabernacle? who may continwe in thy holy hill?

Even he that lives innocently / doing that at just is / whose heart is ever
in meditacion upon the trwthe.

He that deceives not nor hurts with his tongue / nether does none evil to
his neghbour / nor reuileth not his fellow.

But sets naught by the ungodly / and has them in price that fere the
lord: which keeps his oath and promise with his neighbor. And lends not
his money for a vauntage: nether receives gift agenst the innocent.

He that does these things / abides and dwells there still for ever

The Title of the Psalm. 16. David's delicat and sweet prays
The Argument.
The variable state of this world considered / he confesses nothing to be
stable. Wherefore there is nothing more holy and certain then to cleue to the
lord with all confidence.

BEpe me (oh God) for in the do I trust. I confess unto the lord / saying
thou art my Lord / my goodis are nothing for the.

I gave my self therefore sometime to help the saints / which are upon the
earth.

But when their aduersite with incommodities begane to grow / they went back.

I shall not offer up none of their blodye drink offeraunces / nether yet once
take the names of them into my lips.

For the lord is the portion of my heretage and my cup: thou hold up my
lotte.

My lotte fill upon a fayer place / and my heretage pleases me well I thank
the lord for his monicion: for even by night my conscience correcketh me.

I look up evermore beholdinge the Lord present at mine eyes / for even at my
right hand is he present / lest I should slide.

Wherefore my heart ioythe and my greatness reioyseth / that my flesh at last
may rest suerlye.

For thou will not leave me in my grave: nor suffere thy dear beloved holy one
to be corrupted.

But thou shall show me the pathe of life / thou shall make me glad with thy
presence / for there is perpetual joy in thy power.

The Title of the Psalm. 17. The prayer of David.
The Argument
He contendeth in a manner with god / because he so grievously tempts him
studyinge to do well. And he prays to be delivered of the lord from his
enymrs.

HEre (lord) mine innocencye / attend unto my cryinge: give ear unto my
unfeigned prayer spoken with all my heart.

Let thy judgment declare mine innocencye: let thy eyes behold equite.

Prove my heart / and search it by night / try me with fire / and yet shall
thou not find me a dissembler: for I decreed with my self not to offend /
no not in word

I tempered me from the works of m^n / and from the ways of the perverse: for
the word of thy lips.

keep my stepis within thy paths lest my fete turn into any contrary way.

For I cry unto the (oh God) for soucoure: give ear to me and here my words.

Assign me thy wonderful mercyes / thou which with thy right hand kepest the
faithful from their adversaries.

keep me as one would keep the apple of his eye: hyde me under the shadewe of
thy wings.

From the ungodly which trouble me / even fro my enemies which close in my life.

Which with their riches tyrannously oppress: and with their mouths cry out
proudlye.

They lay awayte at our fete: turninge down their eyes to the earth They ar
like the ho^gry lyo^ gredy of his proye: even the young lion laid bente in his
preuye den.

Arise lord / and prevent him / cast him down grouelinge / and redeem me from
the ungodly with thy sword.

Deliver me by thy power from the mortal / even from the men of this world /
which in this life enjoy their part.

For even thou out of thy store house fillest their bellies / that when they be
satisfied with children / they may yet leave the rest of their goodis to their
infants.

But I / when I shall apere before the in my innocencye / shall be satisfied: I
shall be well filled when thy glory shall be declared in the day of apperaunce.

The Title of the Psalm. 18 The song adhortatorye of David the servant of the
Lord / which sunge this song unto him when he delivered him both from the
power of Saul and also from al his enemies.
The Argument.
He gives thankis: he tells into what perel he was brought / he describes
like a poet the divine power / and praises his benefittis.

I Shall love the (oh Lord) my strength / lord thou art my ferme rock / my
bulwark / and my refugie. My god / my defense unto whom I cleave. My buckler /
my mighty sauinge health / and my saynctuarye. When I praise and loaue the
lord: then am I salfe from mine enemies.

Bondis of death compassed me about / the roringe flowdis of Belial swelled up
agenste me.

The snares of hell closed me in: in the nettis of death was I masshed But yet
being in these distresses I called upon and worshipped the Lord / and cried
unto my god.

And he herd my voice / even from his holy hill.

And as soon as my cryinge came unto his earis: the earth trembled and shoke /
the foundacions of the hills staggarde and were smyten together: for it was he
that was wrath.

Fume ascended out of his nostrelles / and deuoueringe fire out of his mouth /
so that coals were kindled there at.

He made the heue^s to stowpe while he came down / having a derke cloud
under his fete.

He was carried upon the Cherubims / and did flee / he came fleinge with the
wings of the wind.

He closed him self in derknes sittinge therein as in his tabernacle he was hid
in black waters even in clouds full of rain.

But at the brightness of his lokingeforth: clouds proceeded / hayle and fyerye
beams.

And then the Lord thondred from above / and the most high god sent forth
his noise: here feldown hail and boltis of fire.

He shet forth and scatred his darts / he smote forth mightily mich
lighteninge over al.

The veins of springes were ope^ned / the foundacions of the round earth were
laid wide open at thy chydinge / Oh lord / they lay naked at thy breath and
stomak of thy wrath.

Then he did put down his hand from an high and took me up quickly: and
drew me forth of the vehement waters.

He delivered me from the violence of my enemies / and my haters which had
overcome me.

Which had taken their pleasure upon me in time of my aduersite: but it was the
Lord that helped me:

And led me forth at large / he delivered me / because he had chosen me.

The lord gave me after my innocencye / and rewarded me according to my pure
lyuinge.

For I did diligently wait upon the ways of the lord / nether did I fle from
my god unto any wother.

For I hold fast al his laws before mine eyes / nether do I thruste his
ordinances from me.

I order my self perfaitly and purely toward him / and I take good heed lest
I fall into any sin.

The Lord might reward me after my innocencye and pure lyuinge / for his
benign liberalite.

With the holy man thou art holy / and pure with the pure.

With the elect thou art chosen: and with perverse thou doist frowardelye.

For thou sauest the pore oppressed: and layst full low the high lokes of the
proud.

Thou lightest my candle / Lord my god: thou dispellest my derkenes with thy
light.

Thou being my goyd / I break through the hole raye in battle: through thy
help / my god / I leap the wallis.

The way of the lord is immaculate / the speech of the Lord is pure: he is
the shilde to all that trust in him.

For who is it that is god but the lord? or who is it that is almightye besyds
our god?

It is God that girdeth me with strength / it is he that keeps my way pure
and good.

Which makes my fete as swifte as are the fete of an heart: and sets me up
in an high place.

Which enstructeth my ha^dis unto batail: and techeth my arms to break bows
of stele.

Thou stretchest forth for my defense thy sauinge buckler / with thy
righthande thou sustayneste me / and encreasest me with thy ie^tle familiarite.

Thou spredist my way under me / lest my helis slide away

I follow upon mine enemies and take them: never tourninge again until they be
al slain.

I smite them down / so that they rise not age^: they fall under my fete Thou
girdeste me with strength unto batell: and throest them down under me which
rise against me Thou (mine enemies backs turned) set me in their neckis /
thou scaterest my enemies al away They called upon / but none herd them: even
upon the lord they called / but he helped them not.

But I beit them as small as dust scatred with the wide / and made no more of
them then of the dirte in the streatis.

Thou delyuerst me from the co^te^ciouse people: and set me to be the head
over the ge^tils / a nacio^ which I knew not / and yet they serve me As soon as
they herd me they obayd me: but my nowne known people fall fro me.

They aborred and yrked the knowledge of me: they swarued away from their
wont pathe.

The Lord lives / and blessed be he even my very rock of stone / God be
exalted and praised which is my sauinge health.

Even god which gives me power to avenge me / and casts this people under my
fete.

It is he that delyuereth me from my enymye / he gives me victory upon them
that rise agenst me / sauinge me from every evil.

Wherefore I shall praise the among the gentiles oh lord: and I shall magnify
thy name.

Which enrichest thy king with miche health / thou endewest David thy anointed
with great benefits / and his sead also for ever.

The Title of the Psalm. 19. The song of David adhortatorie.
The Argument.
He compares the brightness of the word of god unto the light of the son /
expressinge the wholesome virtue thereof.

THe heuens declare the almightye majesty off god / and the firmament shows
forth the work of his handis.

Every day precheth the same: and every night lays forth the same also unto
our knowledge.

There is nether speech nor tongue but among them are the voices of these al
herd.

Into all the world goethforth the speech of them / and their wordis unto the
worldis end.

He has set in them a tabernacle for the son: whence he proceeds like a
bridegroom out of his chamber / and like a geaunt he dresseth him self to
peruse his coursse:

From the one side of the heuens he goth forth myghtely to the the other: and
there is noman that may hyde him from his heat.

And even so is the law of the lord perfayt / restoringe the mind / the
testimonye of the lord is true techinge children wysedom.

The chastisinges of the lord are right / making glad the heart: the precepte
of the lord is pure / illumininge the eyes.

The fere of the lord is clean and ferme for ever / the iugementes of ^he
lord are egal and just.

More pleasant the^ gold or any ^reciouse stone: and sweter then e^her honey
or the honey comb.

Which / who so is thy servant / he ^epeth them: for in kepinge them here
follows great reward.

Who takes head unto his fau^s? absolve me from those sins which I know not:

And also from them which I have boldly committed that they have no dominion
over me / for so shall I be pourged and absolved fro^^ full great sin.

Let the wordis of my mouth ple^se the: let the meditacion of my ^erte be

He promyseth as it were in the person of a master / that he will be benign
and Ientle over all to his servant.

The lord shall here the in tharticle of thy distress the majesty of the God
of Jacob shall defendethe.

He shall send the help from the holy place: and from zion he shall defend
the.

He shall remember al thy sacrifice and accept thy brent offeraunce. So he shall

He shall give the thy hertis desy^ and accomplesshe thy mind.

We shall rejoice in thy health and triumph gloriously upon the majesty of our
god / for the lord shall grant the al thy peticions.

Now know I that the lord will preserve his anointed: the Lord will bring him
help from his holy heaven with the sauinge power of his righthande.

Some trust in chariets and some in their horses: but we will remember the name
of the lord our god. They shall fall grouelinge when we shall arise and stand
upright.

The Argument.
He gives God thankis for his innumerable benefits / which he partelye
recites.

Lord / se how the king reioyseth in thy strength? how exceeding glad is he
of thy victoriouse help?

Thou haste given him the desire of his own heart: and granted him the
peticions of his lyppes. So thou haste
Selah.

Thou have prevented him with thy benign liberalite: and have set the golden
crown upon his head.

He asked life of the / and thou gave him long life / ye a perpetual life.

Hts glory excedeth / but yet through thy help: honor and clea^ fame have
thou laid upon him.

And thou shall also endewe him with perpetual felicite / and make him glad
with thy ioyouse presence.

For the king trusts in the lord / and in the goodness of the most hygheste:
wherefore he can not slide.

Let all thy enimyes feel thy power / all thy adversaries might have
experience of thy righthande. Set fire on them as it were in an oouen in the
time of thy indignacion: Lord let the fire deuower and swelowe them up in
thy wrath.

Destroy their ysswe out of the earth: and pluck their progeny out of the
sort of men.

For they enforce myscheif agenst the: they conceayue shrewd counsails which
they may not bring to pass.

But thou shall turn them into flight: and with thy bow smite them in their
faces.

Be thou exalted (lord) in thy nowne strength / that we may praise and preche
thy power.

The Argument.
He desierthe depely the help of God / being now in extreme anxte and
distress: which he expresses with meruelouse co^parysons. He felith help /
and gives thanks. In which al he figureth Christ goodly / and at last he
sets to the prophecy of the calling of the gentyls.

My God / my god: wherefore have thou forsaken me? the words of my out cryinge
are full far from health.

I call upon the / the hole day Oh my god / and yet thou herist not: ye I
cease not cryinge the hole night.

Verily thou art he that dwelleste in the holy temple / oh the glory of
Israel: thou wast the hope off our fathers / in the they trusted / and thou
delyuerdst them.

Unto the they cried and were delivered / in the they trusted and were not
confounded.

But I am a worm and no more a man / a fable / a iestinge stoke for men / a
vile abiecte in ignominye of the comen people.

All that se me contempne me / they wryue their lips at me / and nodde their
headis. (Saying).

He trusted in the Lord / let him redeem him / let him deliver him if he love
him.

But thou receyuedst me cominge forth even of my mothers womb: and wast my
hope even at my mothers brestis.

Into thy lap was I laid from my birthe / as soon as I was borne thou wast
and art my god.

Go not therefore fro me / this my perellous anxte being now present: for I
have no man to help. Many fyerce bull is cloose me about / ye great far steris
compass me in.

They gape upon me with their mouths: even as roringe rampaunt lions.

But I was powerd forth like water / my bones shaken out of joint and my heart
in the myddis of me melted away like wax.

My strength was dried up like a potsherde / my tongue cleued to my chaues /
for thou have brought me unto the dead dust.

ye there were yet very dogs co^passinge me about: eue^ the counsel of the
most myscheuouse digginge and breakinge my handis and fete full cruelly.

All my bones racked / were laid open to be told of all that looked upon me.

They divide my cote emonge the^ selves: and cast lottis for my garment.

Thou Lord therefore tarry not thou art my strength / haste the to help me.

Deliver my life from the sword and my only dear soul from these doggis.

Save me from the open mouths of these lions / deliver me from the horns of
these unicorns.

And I shall declare thy gloriouse majesty unto my brethern / even in the
mids of the congregation shall I praise the.

ye that fere the lord praise him / thou the hole sead of Jacob magnify him:
and thou that art the populose sead of Israel reverence him.

For he despisethe not / nor turns not away his face from the pore afflicte
/ nether hides he his face from him / but he hereth him when he cries.

I shall preche praise of the before the hole congregation / and pay my vows
before them that fere the.

The lowely shall ete and be satisfied / they shall praise the Lord and seek him
/ they might live for ever.

They shall be converted unto the lord and all the coostis of the earth shall
preche him / and all the kynredes of the gentiles shall fall down before him.

For the kingdom of the gentiles is the lordis / and he shall be lord over them.

And all the rich of the earth shall ete and worship him / they shall bow their
knees before him / and al men shall go down to the ground / orels their soul
shall not live. This sead shall serve him / and shall singe praise unto the Lord
for ever.

They shall come and shewethe for me of his rightwysmaking / unto the gentyls
yet to be borne / who^ the Lord shall create.

The Title of the Psalm.23. The song of David.
The Argument.
He syngeth thinnumerable benefits of God under the similirude of an herdeman
faithfully fedinge his flock of sheep.

lusty pasture: and retcheth me for the unto sweet still runninge waters.

He refressheth my soul / and directs me in the right way / for his names
sake.

For albe it I should go unto the valye of the dedely shadewe / yet fere I none
evil / for thou art with me: ye thy staff and shepehoke ar my counforte.

Thou spredest me a table in the presence of my adversaries / thou sowplest my
head with oyntme^t and fillest my cup.

Thy goodness therefore and thy benign mercy ar with me through all my life
that I might dwell in thy house for ever.

The title of the Psalm. 24. The song of David.
The Argument.
He sings / god to be lord over al things: but yet only innocent^ to dwell
with him / and the king of glory to come unto us.

THe earth and whatsoever is in it / is the lordis: both the round world and
thinhabiters thereof.

For he has laid her foundation upon the seas / and set her fast upon the
flowdis.

Who then may ascend into the hill of the lord? or who may abide still in
his holy place?

An innocent in his dedis and pure in heart: which extoll^th not his mind
unto vain hope / nether swereth not to deceive.

This man shall be lyberally endewed of the Lord: receyuinge rightwisnes of god
his savior.

This is the generation that gets him: it is Jacob that finds thy
presence. Sela. So it is


Open your gates o ye princes / and let these everlasting gatis be opened
that the great king might enter in.

Who is this great king? the strong and mighty Lord / even the lord that
strong warryer.

that the great king might enter in:

Who is this great king? it is the lord of powers / that is this great king.
So he is.

The Title of the Psalm. 25 The song of David.
The Argument.
It is a common prayer and acknowleginge of his sins.

Unto the (oh Lord) do I lyftvp my mind.

In the (oh my god) do I trust: let me not (I beseech the) be shamed / nether
let mine enemies run upon me.

For as many as trust in the are not shamed: but they be shamed that are vain
transgressors.

Thy ways lord show thou me and thy paths teache me.

Induce and teache me thy truth for thou art my god and my health / in the do
I trust at all times.

Remember thy mercy and goodness: which thou of ever vseste.

But the sins and trespases of my yougth remember them not / but for thy
benignite and goodness remember me oh lord.

Full good and just is the lord / and therefore he reduces sinners into the
way.

He ledeth the homble and mylde / as it behooves with discrecion / and the
afflicte he techeth his way.

All the ways of the lord ar mercy and faithfulness / unto them that keep
promise ^n^o covenant with him.

For thy names sake Lord have mercy on my sin / oh lord / for it is great.

Who so fereth the lord / him he directs in that way which is unto him
acceptable.

possess the land.

The lord techeth his secrets and his covenant unto the^ that fere him.

My eyes are ever inte^te unto the lord: for he plucketh my fete out of the

Turn unto me Lord and have mercy on me: for I am forsaken and sorrowful.

The ang^ysshe of my sorrowful heart encreseth: led me forth therefore of my
distress.

Behold ^y affliccion and heavy ladour: and take away al my sins.

Consider my en^myes for they be full many: and they persewe me with a

I trust / and waver not.

Prove and search me oh lord / sees and try out my raynes and my heart.

For thy merciable goodness do I hold before my eyes: and in thy trowthe do I
walk.

I dwell not with vain men: nether go I in unto these idle and craftye
deceyuers.

I hate the church of the myscheuous malign / nether sit I among these
ungodly.

I wasshe my handis with innocencye / and so go I (oh lord) unto thy altar.

To preche forth with a loud voice thy praise / and to show forth al thy
meruellouse workis.

I love (oh lord) the habitacle off thy house: and the place where thy glory
dwells.

Join thou not my soul with sinners / nether my life with these blodye men.

In whose handis myscheife is found / their right hand is full off brybes.

I verily walk innocently: redeem me and have mercy on me.

My foot stands fast in the right. In the mids of the congregacions I
shall loaue the lord.

The Title of the Psalm. 27. The Psalm of David.
The Argument.
The proof and experience of faith / which in any perel imminent / receyneth
consolacion at the help of the lord.

THe Lord is my light and my health: whom then shall I fear? the lord is the
strength of my life / of whom then shall I be afraid? While there comeforth
against me the malign myscheuouse / and even my enemies to deuower me hole / lo
they fall down al to smite^ When their te^tis ar pitched against me / yet I fere
not: when they be ince^sed to batail against me / then am I most suer.

For one thing I desyer of the Lord / one thing do I seek / even to dwell in
the house of the Lord for ever / that I might se the majesty royal of the
Lord and behold his temple.

For he has hyd me in a perellouse time / he did hyd me in the secret place
of his tabernacle / and lifted me up into a rock of sto^ne. And at last he
gave me victory over my enemies which had compassed me about.

Wherefore I offer in his tabernacle thofferaunce of thankis geuinge / I praise
and sing unto the Lord.

Here (oh Lord) my voice wherewith I call upon the / have mercy on me / and
help me.

My heart acknowlegeth the / my countenance seeks the / Lord I desyer thy face.

Hyd not thy face fro me / repel not thy servant in thy wrath.

Thou art my strength / leave me not / nether forsake me oh God my savior.

For my father and my mother have forsaken me: but yet the Lord shall take me
up to nouresshe.

Teache me (lord) thy way / and led me in a right pathe from my a wait
layers.

Let not my enimes take their pleasure upon me / for perjured witnesses ar risen
up agenst me imagening a mischief for me.

But this thing is my counfort: I am suer to se the benign goodness of the
Lord in the land of the lyuinge.

Trust thou therefore in the lord (who so ever thou be) for it is he that shall
counfort and strengthen thy heart: se therefore thou trust in the lord.

The Title of the Psalm. 28 The Psalm of David.
The Argument.
Suddenly and incessantly he callethe upon the lord / to be delivered from the
fraudulent. He is herd / and gives thankis.

Unto the (oh lord my rock) do I cry: repel me not I beseech the / frustrat
not my hope / lest I be like me^ descendinge into their graves.

Here the voice of thy suppliaun^ criynge upon the: which lift up my handis
towerde thy holy temple.

Repute me not I beseech the emo^ge the ungodly or the myscheuous / spekinge
friendly to their neighbor / but myscheuously thinkinge in their hertis.

Reward them according to their myscheif and maliciouse thoughts: give them
after their deades / requite the^ as they be worthy Even as they regard not
the lord through the workis made with his hand: so let him destroy them
never to be restored.

I thank the lord for he has he^de the voice of his suppliaunt The lord is
my strength and shilde unto him my heart cleueth / of him feel I help / and
therefore my heart reioyseth magnifyinge him with my song.

The lord is our strength: he is the sauinge power of his anointed.

Save thou therefore thy people / be merciful and good unto thy heretage: feed
and bear them up continually and ever.

The Title of the Psalm. 29. The song of David.
The Argument.
He exciceth the mighty unto the worship of one alone for all sufficient / god
almighty: Whose almighty power he precheth / sings / and magnifieth
eycedingly.

Give ye unto the lord / o ye mighty princes: give him (I say) his glory and
the praise of his power.

Acknowledge this name of the lord to be omnipotent: worship the holy majesty
of the lord.

For it is the lord that by his only commandment rules the waters: god
almighty prepares the thonder / the Lord commands the seas.

The voice of the lord takes effect / the voice of the lord is full of
majesty.

At the lordis biddinge the Cedre trees be al to broken / ye the Lord verily
will break even the Cedre trees of Lybani.

He shall trede down the mount Libanum like a strong bull: and Saron like a
unicorn.

The commandment of the lord scatereth forth flames of fire. The voice of
the Lord makethe the deserte to tremble / he shakes even the deserte of Cades.

The voice of the Lord makethe the hearts and hyndes sick / and makes naked
even the thick wodis.

In his temple therefore / every man speaks his glory.

The Lord ceasseth the dil^^ye: the lord obteineth still his everlasting
kingdom.

The lord gives strength to his people with goodness and peace

The Title of the Psalm. 30 David's song of thankis geuinge for the foundation
and reasinge up of his house.
The Argument
It is a thankis geuinge / whereby the godly are taught al things to be suer
committed unto god. It appears it to be written after some syknes.

WIth high praises (oh lord) shall I extol the / for that thou have taken me
up to preserve me: nether haste thou suffered my enemies to triumph over me.

Lord my god / unto the have I c^yed: and thou have healed me.

Lord thou have called me agene fro my grave / thou have restored my soul
from going* down into the pit.

Singe ye unto the lord / you that be his sayntis / give tha^kis in the holy
remembrance of him.

For while he is wrath for a little space / through his favor yet gives he
life: although the eueninge be turned into wepinge / yet is gladness restored
in the morninge.

Verily / when I said in my flowers: I shall never fall nor suffer hurt.

(For thou Lord of thy goodness had given strength unto my hill) anon as thou
had hyden thy face I was troubled.

But here / unto the / oh lord I cried: unto the my lord made I my prayer.

What (I say) profits my blood if I be corrupt? shall my duste magnifye the?
shall it praise thy trowthe?

Hear me therefore lord and have mercy on me: Oh Lord help me.

Then thou turnedest my moornynge into joy / thou vnlacedest my sake and
gyrdedste me with gladness.

Wherefore thy glory shall be songe^ incessantly: for I / lord my god shall
magnify the for ever.

The Title of the Psalm. 31. David's song adhortatorye.
The Argument
It is a prayer in great tribulacion / a gra^youse hearing / and
than^esgeuinge.

IN the (oh lord) do I trust let me never I beseech the be shamed / but for
thy mercyes sake deliver me.

Bow down thy ear unto me / speed the to deliver me / be my strong rock /
and well defenced house wheryn thou will save me.

For thou art my stonney rock and my castle: for thy names sake therefore be
my goyd and nourysshe me.

Led me forth of the net which they have hyd for me: for thou art my
defender.

Into thy handis I comme^de my spirit: redeem me / Lord god which art so trwe.

For I hate them that embrase vanite: but in the (Oh Lord) do I trust.

I shall be glad and rejoice in thy mercy: for thou will look upon my adfliccion
when thou espieste my soul in distress.

Nether will thou yild it into the power of my aduersarye / but wilt set my
fete at large.

Have mercy upon me (lord) for I am in trouble: my eyes rimple and wax dim
for heaviness / my soul / my bellye.

My life is consumed with sorrow / and my yearis in sighinge: my strength is
fallen away in calamite / and my bones are consumed.

I was obprobriously defamed of al my enimyes: unto my neighbors and siche as
knew me I was great fear. Who so saw m^ they fled out away fro me.

Out of mind I fyl forgoten as ^ dead man: I was gone like a ^rye broken
potsherde.

For my self herd the obloquye / and threatis of the multitude ga^hered about
me: they consented al agenst me / they conspired to take away my life.

But in the (oh lord) do I trust / and I say / thou art my god.

In thy hand are my destenes / deliver me from the power of my e^imes and
persuers.

Show thy graciouse countenance unto thy servant: and save me for thy mercys
sake.

Lord let me not be confounded / for unto the do I call: but let the ungodly
be shamed and laid a sleep in their graves.

Let lyinge lips be sewed up together / which craftily prowdly / and
spightfully speak agenste the just.

Oh how great goods say thou up for the fearers of the? which good thou
doist unto the^ that trust in the / even in the presence of al mortal men.

Thou hiddest these men preuelye in thy sight from the proud me^ thou hiddest
them in thy tabernacle from virulent tongues.

Tha^kis be unto the Lord for his high goodness toward me / defended as I
were in the most strong cite.

For I / some time without al hope said: I am cast out of thy sight and yet
thou herdest thy supplyaunt cryinge unto the.

Love ye the lord therefore all his saints: for the lord defends his
faithful / but these proud doers he rewards plentuously.

Be constant / and the lord will confirm and stablysshe your hertys as many
as trust in him.

The Title of the Psalm. 32. David's admonicion.
The Argument.
He techeth it to be a ioyouse thing / to be eased quyt from the burden of
sin / and contrary wise: a miserable thing to have an obstinat conscience
clogged and depressed with sin / And at last he shows by what ways sins
be forgeuen.

OH how blessed is he that is eased of his transgression / whose sin is
kouered?

Oh happy man / unto whom the lord rekeneth not his sin: in whose mind
there is nothing desaitfully hyd.

For I verily / while I held my tongue / my bones aked with my daily out cryinge.

For day and night thy heavy hand pressed me down / my succulent moister was
turned into a so^mer drought. So it was
Selah.

But my sin / after that I had confessed it unto the / and vnkouered before
the / my wikednes:

When I said / accusinge my self: I acknowledge and confess my tra^sgression
unto the lord / even anon thou forgauest the crime of my sin. So thou
did.
Sela.

Wherefore whatsoever saint he be / let him pray unto the as soon as he feleth
the same distress / and then shall not the inundacion of swellinge waters
touch him.

Thou art my refugye in my tribulacion closinge me about / and now thou
closest me about with the joy of delyueraunce. So thou doist.
Selah.

I shall enstructe the (saiste thou) and show the what way thou must go / I
shall fasten mine eyes upon the.

Except ye will be horse and mules clean with out understanding.

Whose mouths and headis unless they be with snaffle and bridle refrayned /
they will not obaye the.

Let the ungodly look for many plages: but who so trusts in the lord shall
be closed about with mercy.

Be glad in the Lord and rejoice ye rightwyse / be io^unde and merry ye all
that be off an vpryghte heart.

The Argument. of the.33. Psalm.
It is a praise wherein the almighty power of god is praised

Rejoice ye rightwyse in loauinge the lord: for his praise becomes well the
just.

Loaue ye therefore the lord / sing unto him with harp / lute / and ten
stringed instrument.

Sing unto him a new song / smite up your instruments with a loud melodye.

For the word of the Lord is right holy / and al his workis ferme and fast.

He loves equite and right / the earth is replenysshed with the goodness of
the lord.

By the word of the lord heuens were made / and al their ornowerment at the
brethe of his mouth.

He gathers up the waters together on heap: and agene / he hydeth them in the
botome of the sea.

All the earth might fear the lord / al thinhabiters of the world might
worship him.

For at his commandment al things have their being: as soon as he spoke the
word / al things were done.

The lord scaterth the counsel of the haithen: and the thoughtis of people he
frustrateth.

But his counsel dureth for ever / the thoughts of his heart contynwe through
al generacions.

Oh happy nation which holds the lord for their god / whom he has chosen
to him for his heretage.

The lord looks forth from heaven to consider all the children of men: even
from his suer seat royal he beholds al thinhabitours of the world.

For he only has made the hertis of them / it is he alone that knows all the
dedis of them.

It is not the puissaunce of an innumerable host that saves a king / nether
is the geaunt delivered by his great strength.

The horsman deceyueth thy salfgarde: noman is delyuerde by the multitude of
horsemen.

But behold / they are the eyes of the lord that be set upon them which fere
him reverently / and cleue unto his mercy.

That he would preserve their souls from pestelence / and nouressh them in
famyn.

Let our soul therefore cleue to the lord / for it is he that is our shilde
and defender

In him therefore shall our hertis rejoice / as long as we trust in his holy
name.

Let thy mercy (oh lord) shine upon us / even as we trust upon the.

The Title of the Psalm. 34. The song of David concerning the fayninge of
his madness / mutacion of his mouth / and wit / before Abimelech / of whom
when he was castout he fled his way.i. Reg. xxi.
The Argument.
It is a thankis geuynge: in the which he testifies that god never forsakes
his beloved.

I Shall praise the lord at al time: his praise shall be ever in my mouth.

In the laud of the lord my soul delyghteth her self / as the ho^ble
oppressed here this / so may they be glad.

Magnify ye the lord with me / and let us together extol his name.

For I asked counsel of the Lord and he answerde me / and he delyuerd me out
of al my fere.

Whosoever look up unto him are made fresshe and bright / and their faces are not
confounded.

Whosoever in his adfliccion call upon the lord / he is herd: and he
delyuerthe him out off all distress.

Even the angel of the Lord pitcheth castles and lies rowndabout them that
fere him / and delyuerth them.

Taste and se how good is the lord: blessed is he whosoever trusts in him.

Reverence the Lord ye that are his saints: for they lack nothing that
reverently fere him.

But the cruel shall want and be famysshed: when the fearers of the Lord shall
want nothing.

Come hither oh children and give ear unto me: the fear of the lord shall I
teache you.

Who so coueteth to live long / and desierth also to have good days. Let him
refrain his tongue from euel / and his lips lest they speak desayte.

Let him estiwe ill / and do good / study for peace and follow it.

For the eyes of the lord are inte^te unto innocents / and his ears bente
unto their prayers

But he looks grymme upon them: that do ill: to cut away their memorial out
of the earth.

Those men / when they krye / the lord hereth them / and delyuerth the^ out of
al their distress.

The lord is present with the contrite heart: and preserves the deiecte mind.

Many incommodites fall upon the just: but from them al / the Lord delyuerth
them.

He keeps al their bones: so that not one of them be broken.

But full miserable is the death of the ungodly / for they that hate the just
shall be plucked up by the rote The lord redemeth the soul off his servant /
nether are they banesshed who so trust in him.

The Argument.
David makes his inuocacio^ to god in his greuouse oppression of his enymes:
which persecute us for our well deserving of them.

Lord take up my cause in my strife: and fight agenst them that fight agenst
me. Take up buckler and spear / and stand up to help me.

Draw forth thy sword and run upon them that pursue me / tell my soul. lo /
I am here by the / eue^ I which am thy saving health. Let them be shamed and
counfounded that prease upon my soul let them turn their backs with shame
that think me evil.

Make them like duste laid forth for the wind / the angel of the lord
scateringe them.

Let their ways be derke and slyber: the angel of the Lord persuynge them.

For they have bent preuely their dedely net for me an innocent / they have
dug up a pit for me gyltles.

Let their own calamyte come upon themself vnwaris: let the^ be taken in
their own preuey net: let them fall into their own myscheyfe.

But my soul might rejoice in the Lord / and be glad of his salvation.

Al my bones shall say: lord who is like unto the? which delyuerst the weak
dejected from his stronger / and the poor nedy on from his robbers.

There arose against me false witnesses / imputinge thingis to me which I never
knew.

They requited me ill for good / leuinge me poorly al alone.

But they / when they were full syke then was my vesture a sack: I macerated my
self with fast / and my prayer rolled in my bosom.

I went as one moorninge for his fellow or brother / I hombled my self being
sorye as one had buried his own mother.

But contrarywyse / they (when I was full syke) made full merry / they ran
together / ye even the laame came runninge upon me vnwaris they kit their
clothes nether omitted they any token off moorninge.

But all was but ypocrisye / ye even their cotes strewed with ashes: for in
the mean ceason they grinned and gnasshed their tethe upon me.

Lord when will thou look upon this? restore me from the shameful rebukes of
them / deliver my dear soul from the tyrants.

That I might give the thankis in the most full congregation / and ^rayse the
when the most people ^e present.

Nether let these liars my enemies triumph over me: let the^ wynke in vain
one upon another which thus deadly hate me

For they think nothing peceably but when the land is in tranquilite / then
take they fraudelent counsails.

They spoke agenst me with open mouth: saying / o well well / now we se it
with our eyes.

And thou lord also have seen it / tarry not therefore / lord go not far fro
me.

Awake and rise up / that thou migh^st aue^ge my cause / o lord my god Avenge
me for thy rightwisnes ^ake lord my god / that they reioy^e not upon me.

Nether let them say in their hertis it gothe on our side / let them not say
/ we have convicted him. Let them be shamed and altogyther confounded that thus
rejoice upon my trouble / let them b^ cled with shame and ignomynye that thus
triumph over me

Let them be glad and rejoice tha^ favor my innocencye / so that they affirm
at al time / great is the lord which loves the health and peace of his
servant.

But my tongue might be contynually spekinge off the form off thy rightwyse
making / and let this loaue and praise never go out of my mind.

The Title of the Psalm 36. The song adhortatory of David the servant of the
lord.
The Argument.
The naughty nature and arro^ant boldness of the ungodly is he ^e descrybed / yt
is here also as^ed / that the godly might enjoy ^he fruicion of the goodness
of god

THus thinks my heart of the audacite of the ungodly / that he has not god
before his eyes For albe it he flatereth god vtwar^ly / yet he aborreth not
execrable myscheyfe / declaringe his inward hatered.

The wordis of his mouth are de^ayte and mere myscheife / he refu^eth to be
taught to do well.

In his bed he studeth myscheif / he joins him self to what so ever way is
not good / and that at evil is he estiweth not.

When thy goodness oh Lord recheth up unto the heavens / and unto the clouds
thy trewthe is spread.

Thy rightwisnes is like a mighty hill / and thy equite like the deep sea
unable to be mesured.

When it is thou which preserueste both men and beastis Oh Lord.

How precyouse and rich is thy goodness oh God? wherwithe the childern of men
animated / are bold to trust unto the shadew of thy wings.

They are satisfied with the plentuouse encrese of thy house / and drink of
thy delyciouse sweet flowde.

For with the / is that lively perpetual spring / and in thy light we se
light.

Setforth thy goodness unto those that know the / and thy rightwisnes unto the
right herted.

Let not the foot of pride over take me: let not the hand of the ungodly move
me.

But let them fall that work myscheif / cast them down that they never more
rise agene.

The Title of the Psalm. 37. The song of David.
The Argument.
It is an admonicion and warninge that we follow not the sinful / allected and
allwered of their feigned felicite / heal so paynteth the nature and the end
both of the godly and ungodly.

Noli emulari.

Psalm. 37.
Follow not the stepis of the euel: nether inuye thou the prosperity off ill
doers.

For suddenly like heye are they kut down / and like the green grass be they
witherd.

But thou / se thou trust in the lord / and do good: that thou may dwell
upon the earth and he may well feed the.

And thou shall delight in the Lord / which shall give the thy hertis desyer.

Layeforth thy way before the lord and trust unto him / for he shall setforth
thy good dedis like the morninge / and thy just dealinge like the middaye.

Give thy self hole unto the lord / and abide his pleasure / let not his life
move the whom all thingis prosperously succeed: even that man which lives all
in sin.

Remitte wrath / swage anger / let not their evil ensample provoke the to do
ill.

For euel doers shall be cut away: but they that patiently abide the Lordis
pleasure shall possess the land.

Suffer a little while / and the ungodly shall be clean gone / when thou shall
look for his place he shall not apere:

But the meke spryted shall possess the land / and enjoy myche peace.

The ungodly lays awayte for the just / and grinneth upon him with his tethe.

But the lord laugheth him to scorn: for he seith when his day shall come.

The ungodly draw forth their sword and bend their bow to throdowne the
poor afflicte / and to kill them that go the right way.

But their own sword shall perse their own heart: and their bows shall be
broken.

That litel of the rightwise is better / then the great goodis of the ungodly.

For the arms of the ungodly are consumed: but the just men / the lord
strengthens.

The lord also knows the day of the innocents / for their heretage is
perpetual.

They shalnot be shamed in the p^rellouse time / but in honger they shall be
sated.

But the ungodly shall perisshe: and the enimyes of the Lord shall be consumed
with fire / their smoke fleing up like the smoke of fate brent wethers.

The ungodly borowth and gathers his goods by usury never to repaye nor give
/ but the just gives forth lyberally.

Who so approve this liberalite they shall possess the land / but they that
abhor it shall be rent up by the rotes.

Of the lord are the stepis of a good man directed: and he loves his way.

When he fallith he shall not be hurt: for the lord susteyneth him with his
hand.

I was a child and now am I old / and yet never saw I the just forsaken /
nor his sead seek his breed.

Although he would be ever geuinge forth almose: and for this cause his sead
enjoyed his good prosperously.

He flees ill and folowth good / and he dwells here many days For the Lord
loves just dealinge / nether forsakes he his sayntis but they are kept for
ever / but the sede of the ungodly shall be cut away.

But the just shall possede the lord / and shall dwell long thereupon Wysedom
is ever in the mouth of the just: and his tongue speaks equite.

For the law of his god is in his heart: wherefore his ways ar ferme and fast.

The ungodly looks narowly of the just: and honteth to slaye hi^. But the
Lord leueth him not in to his power / nether will not let hi^ dampne him when he
iugeth hi^. Trust in the Lord and keep his way / and he shall exalt the to
possede the land / and that thou may se the destruction of the ungodly. I
saw on a time the ungodly rootinge and strongly setteling himself and rising
up flourisshing like the grene baye tree / but lo / in the twinclinge of an eye
he was gone / and when I looked for his place / it coud not be fownde.

keep innocencye / and behold the right / for these thingis at last shall
procure a man peace

When the trangressours shall be banesshed away together: for the end of the
ungodly is death and destruction.

But the health of the just comes from the lord: for it is he that is their
strength in the article of distress.

The Lord bringethe them help and delyuerth them / he defends and saves
them from the ungodly / for because they trust in him.

The Title of the Psalm. 38. The song of David wheryn he remembers his
affliccion.
The Argument.
It is a faithful enserchinge of hi^ self and confession of his crime / his
fre^dis forsake him / his enimes stand agenst him. In the lord ther^ore only
/ health is laid up.

Lord I beseech the reprove me not in thy furye / nether correcke me not in
thy wrath.

For thy arowes are set fast in me ^hy hand is laid sore upon me.

Thy wrath has left nothing hole in my flesh / nothing hole in my bones
for my sin.

For my sins are risen over my head / being as it were a great burden miche
heuyer then I am able to bear.

My secret soris stynke and fester / for my nowne folysshnes.

I am adflycte / and deyected so far / that I am werye off my life.

My loins are full off mysery^ there is no health in all my body* I am sore
febled and broken / the anguyssh of my heart breketh forth into loud cryinge.

Lord thou know all my desie^ and my waylinge is not hyd from the.

My heart pants / my strength has left me / and my eye sight goes fro me.

My frendis and neighbors stood agenst me when I was smiten and my very
kinsfolk fled far fro me.

But they flew upon me that laid awayt for my life / and they that forged
myscheyf for me / invented and sought frauds and gyle at al time.

But I as a deffe man herd not: for I am as the domme that ope^eth not his
mouth.

I am as one that here not / and therefore cannot rebuke agene.

For in the (oh lord) do I trust / thou will not frustrate my hope / oh lord
my god.

For this thing do I ask / that they rejoice not upon my hurt / nether make
a gaude at the slidinge of my fete.

For I am verily redye to the scourge / and my blewe strypes do I never forget.

For I my self confess my ungodliness / and my sin ge^dreth sorrow in me.

But my enimes are salfe and strong / and they increase which hate me
wrongfully.

Which also requite me evil for good / they vex me injuriously because I
follow that at good is.

Forsake me not therefore lord my god / go not far fro me.

Haste the to help me / Oh lord / my sauinge health.

The Title of the Psalm 39. The song of David adhortatorye committed unto
Idithum^ course.
The Argument.
A common prayer / wherein when he confesses all men for their daily sins
worthy beatinges / he desierth god of his meecy.

I Had decreed with my self so to keep my ways / that I would not offend in
word I kept my mouth with bridle / for the ungodly observed me.

I refrayned / I held my tongue / I was domme: ye and that for a good purpose /
but yet it encresed and ^asperated my sorrow.

My heart brent with in me / and ^hyle I thus reuolued with my ^^lfe / this
fire encresed more and ^ore.

Thus therefore I begane to speak ^hewe me my end oh lord / and that is the
length of my days: ^^t me know I beseech the when ^ shall make an end.

^o thou haste brought my day^s into an handful long / and my ^ge is as
nothing before the: And suerlye all the state of man ^s not else but vanite.
No More it is.
Selah For mannys life is but a shadewe: he embusieth him self in vain / he
heapeth unto him and knows not for whom he gatherethe yt.

Now therefore what thing may I lokefore oh lord? My hope is fastined in the.

Deliver me therefore from al my transgressions: and make me not the reuylinge
stock of the vaynelyers.

I shall be still and not once open my mouth: if thou will do this thing.

Take away thy strypes fro me / for I am consumed of thy heuye hand.

When thou rebukest and correckst man for his ungodliness / then (be he never so
great) he is wasted away as it were of a motte so friuole and vain a thing
is man. So he is.
Sela.

Lord here my prayer / receive my cryinge at thy ears / turn the not ^waye
fro my teres: although I ^e but a stranger with the and a ^ilgryme as were al
my fathers.

Spare me yet a little (some pardon obtained) ere I go hence / and no more be
seen.

The Title of the Psalm. 40 The song adhortatorie of Dauyd.
The Argument.
A confession whereby god is praised / how he ought to be worshipped and only
called upon in tribulacion with ferme hope.

WHen I had long tarried and waited upon the lord / at last he attended unto
me and herd my kryinge.

He drew me forth of the deep pit and toughe mudde / he did set fast my
fete upon the rock and directed my journey.

Then he did put a new song in to my mouth / even the song off thankis
geuinge unto our god / that al men might consider / fere / and trust in the
lord.

Oh happy man that puts his confidence in the lord / and turns not
himself unto pride / but turns away from vanite.

For thou / lord my god do meruels innumerable / and thy counsels are with
us peerlesse.

When I would remember and tell them forth: they ar innumerable And as for
offrance and sacrifice thou loueste them not / but by my ears thou twitchest
me: bre^t sacrifice nor pourginge sacrifice thou requirest not: wherefore then I
said: lo here am I comen my nowne self.

In the first side of the book it is written of me / that I must do that
thing that pleases the / oh my god: which thing also I do it gladly / for
thy law is written in the mids of my breast.

I preche the form of thy rightwysmakinge before the hole congregation / lo my
lyppes cease not oh Lord / as thou see.

Thy rightwysmakinge / even from the myddys of my heart do I declare / thy
troth and salvation I do speak: I dissemble not thy goodness and faith before
all the hole church.

Wherefore a lord cease thou not to be merciful unto me / let thy goodness and
thy faith always defend me.

For troubles innumerable oue^whelmed me / my sins so co^bre^ me that I might
not decerne the^ for they are moo then the hears of my head / wherefore even my
heart failed me.

Haste the lord to deliver me: speed the to help me.

Let them be sone shamed and confounded that seek my soul to destroy it / let
them fall bake with shame that rejoice upon my hurt. Let them at last be
destroyed after their confusion / which bark agenst me with spite saying /
Ohe / ohe.

Let them rejoice and be glad in the all that seek the / and who so love thy
sauinge health might say contynually: The Lord be magnified.

^ am a pore afflicte abiecte / lord ^elpe me / for thou art my delyue^er / oh
my god tarry not.

The Argument. of this Psalm. 41.
David now being in a sykenes whether it be of body or soul: pra^eth the
lord to have mercy upon him / moving him to pity the pore

BLessed is he that consydereth thestate of the pore: for in time of perell the
Lord shall deliver him.

The lord shall keep him and make him salfe and blessed upon the earth / nether
shall he betake him into the handis of his enymes

The Lord shall restore him when he lie syke / oh lord thou changest al his
siknes.

For this cause I say oh lord have mercy on me / heal my soul / for I am a
sinner agenst the.

My enimes speak evil upon me / saying when shall he dye? that his name may
perisshe.

And whether he came in to se / or went forth: thus speaks his heart /
heapynge myscheyfe upon him self.

Al my enimes come runninge together agenst me / and they take evil counsel
agenst me.

An enmyouse word is blown abroad emonge them: saying / there he lies
neuermore to rise.

ye and even my nowne famyliare whom above al I trusted / which eit my bread /
laid awayte suerlye for me.

Thou therefore lord have mercy on me: and restore me that I may requyte them.

By this thing shall I know that thou love me / if my enemy run not upon
me.

For mine innocencye / I beseech the sustain me / and set me before the for
ever.

Praised be the Lord god of Israel / from age to age for ever. Ame^ Amen.

The Title of the Psalm. 42. An admonicion or exhortacion of the children of
Chore
The Argument.
A complaint before god of the rebuke of his enymes / and of the trouble of
mind spronge thereof: but yet fast and ferme hope counforteth her own self.

AS the thirsty heart pants and gapethe cryinge at the fresshe rivers / so
cries my soul unto the / oh god.

My soul thirsts for God / even the lyuinge god / when shall I once come and
apere before the face of god?

My teris which I shed night and day are turned into my mete / whiles daily it
is said to me / where is thy god?

These things I reuolue with my self / poweringe forth before me the
heuinesses of my mind.

When shall I goforth freshly arrayed to go with my felows ioyouslye with thankis
into the house of the Lord with so goodly a great company?

How deiecte art thou o my soul / and wherefore doist thou thus tro^ble me?
trust in God / for the time shall come that I shall give him tha^kis in his
presence for my health given me agene.

My soul is deiecte and vexed within me oh God when I eft anon remember what
thou did in the land by Iordane at the little hill hermonim.

One deep water calls in another / thy water courses rored: thy great showers
and floudes ran over me.

Daily the lord encreseth his goodness / wherefore I shall praise the lyuinge god
every night.

And I shall say unto god my rock of stone: wherefore forgetest me? wherefore go
I so heuely my enymes vexing me? and brekynge my bones?

My enimes cast me in the teth daily saying unto me / where is thy god?

But oh my soul / thou art sone dejected: and wherefore troublest me? trust in
god / for the time shall come that I shall give thankis agene unto my God for
health restored.

This Psalm folowinge is off the same Argument and matter before.
Give sentence with me / oh god / and defend my cause from the godless / from
the fraudelent myscheuouse deliver me.

For thou (o god) art my strength wherefore repellest me? wherefore go I thus
heuyly my enymes ve^inge me?

^endeforth thy light and troth / ^et them led me forth and set me ^ thy holy
hill thy dwelling place That I might go unto the altar ^f god / even god my
joy and glad^es / and singe thankis unto the ^ith harp oh God my God.

Oh my soul wherefore art thou ^eiected / and wherefore make me ^o heuey?
trust in god / for the ty^e shall come that I shall give th^nkis agene for my
health restored

The Title of the Psalm. 44 is al one with the foresaid psalm.
The Argument.
He complayneth unto god / askinge that according unto the covenant made with
the fathers / he would help us for that we be adflicte enough.

With our ears we have herd / O god / our fathers puttinge us in mind off
the workis (which while their selves lived / thou wroughtst in time past.

For thou with thy nowne hand (the gentiles cast out) did grief them in:
thou destroydst and did cast out miche people.

For they got not that land with their sword / nether did their own arm
save them / but it was thy righthande / thy arm and the light of thy chere /
for thy favor went with them.

For thou art that king and our god / which sendist thy sauinge health unto
Jacob.

Thou being our capitain / we blewe out our enimes as it were with horns: we
acouraged with thy strength / trod them down / as many as rose agenst us.

For our trust consisted not in our bows / nether was it our o^ne sword that
saved us.

But it was thou that sauedst us from our enymes / and confoundedst our
adversaries.

Let us therefore continually praise the our god / and evermore give thankis
unto thy majesty. So let us do.
Selah.

But now thou forsakeste us and castest us their laughinge stoke agenst them to
be reuyled / nether goist thou forth with our army Into flight thou turnest
us before our enymes / and our adversaries trede us under their fete.

Thou have made us like a flock of sheep alto torn and wiried / and even
emonge the gentiles thou scateredst us.

Thou soldeste thy people for nothing / nether dideste thou steke styffely
co^tendinge for their price Thou laydst us forth to be a iestinge stoke unto
our neighbors to be a laughinge and mockinge stoke to the^ that dwelt about
us. Thou madist us but a fable unto the gentiles / and in derision emonge the
people.

Our ignominye is ever before our eyes: and the shame of our face kouereth us.

For the noise of the rebuker and chyder / and enimes inuadinge us All these
things are comen upon us / netheles yet we forget the not nether break we thy
covenant.

Our heart turns not back / but thou declinedst our steapis from thy pathe.

Thou beitist us to powder where dragons dennis were: and kouerdst us with a
deadly shadewe

If we had forgoten the name off our God / and stretched forth our handis
unto any strange g^d:

God might worthily have enquered upon this thing / for it is he that knows
the hid thoughtis of the heart.

But for thy sake are we killed d^ylye / we be esteemed as sheep appointed unto
the bochers stalle.

Arise up therefore / wherefore slepest thou so fast / oh Lord? Awake and
forsake us not utterly.

Wherefore hideste thou thy face? wherefore forgetest thou both our affliccion
and oppression.

For our soul is depressed unto the duste / our bellye steketh fast to the
ground.

Arise therefore and help us / and deliver us for thy great goodness.

The Title of the Psalm. 45 A lovely song adhortorye to be song of the sons
of Chore.
The Argument.
A praise under the laud of the king and queen / that is to were of the very
king christ and his spouse the church.

LEt my heart powerforthe a pure oracion: that I might render my work unto the
king.

Thou my tongue / se that thou beist the pen of a prompte redyescribe.

Of al men thou art the fayereste a great grace fleethforth of thy lips / ye
and that because god has blessed the for ever.

Begyrde thy loins with thy sword / oh most mighty prince: stepe forth in thy
honor / glory / and magnificence.

Ascend and be carried up with these thingis as it were in thy chariet: that
is to wite / with verite / faith / myldenes and justice and above al / thy
meruellouse right hand shall direct the.

Thy sharp arows might perse the hertis of the kings enymes: the great
multitude be throne down of the.

Thy seat royal / oh God / is perpetual the scepter of thy kingdom is the
scepter of equite.

Thou love rightwisnes and hate iniurye / wherefore god thy god has
anointed the with the ointement of gladness above all thy felows.

Thy clothes be redole^t with mirthe / musk / and aumber / so goodly thou
come forth off thy yuerye palaces wherein thou lyueste so plesauntly: kyngis
daughters also do dwell in these thy so goodlye places.

The queen stands at thy right hand / in the most rich and noble golden
aparel.

Unto her thus do I turn my oracion / hear o daughter behold and give ear /
forgete thy people and the house of thy father.

For the king is taken with thy incomparable bewtye / it is he that is thy
lord and thou shall fald^wne before him.

The daughters of Tyri / and the richest of the people / shall bring gifts
before the as thy suppliau^ts The goodly bewtye of the queen shows al within
forth / and all her robis are clothes of tysswe broydred with gold and made
with nedle work.

She is led unto the king / and virgins of her nyghe kynne come after her unto

They are brought with gladness and great joy / they ar brought into thy kings
palace.

For thy parents left (o queen) thou shall have children whom thou shall
setforth to be princes over all the world.

I shall remember thy name unto all thy posterite / that even that populose
nation might praise the forever and ever.

The title of this Psalm. 46. The song adhortatorye of the childerne of Chore.
The Argument.
The church compared by an allegory unto a defensed cite / cannot be hurt:
because the lord is present with it.

GOd is our refuge and strength: he is found also to be our help unable to be
expressed in time of tribulacion.

Wherefore we fere not although the earth be moved / and hills be tombled
down into the botome of the sea.

ye if her waters swel and rise age^ste us: if the proud mountains grinne
upon us. Let them not spare
Selah.

For it is the sweet flowde with her ryuers that make glad the cite of god
which is the holy tabernacle of the most highest.

God is in the myddis off her / she shall not be hurt / for god will sone help
her in time.

Let the sediciouse haithen swell / let the kingdom stere up strife / and all the earth crake and shake.

yet is the lord of powers with us and our refuge is the god off Jacob. so he
is
Selah.

Come and se the workis of the lord / what desolacions he has made upon the
earth.

He has banesshed batel unto the farthest costis of the earth / he has broke
bow / shafte and spear / and their chariets has he brent in the fire.

Attend therefore and knowledge that I am the high God even over the gentiles
am I above al through all the earth.

The lord of powers is with us / and our refuge is the God of Jacob. so he is
Selah.

The Title of the Psalm. 47 The song adhortatory of the sons of Chore.
The Argument.
A thankis geuinge for some victory / co^taininge the figure of crist

CLappe your handis al people / singe ye unto god ioyously.

For the lord is high / and marvelous / he is the great king over all the
earth

He has suddewed the people unto us / and cast the gentyls under our fete.

He has chosen our heretage / even the beutye of Jacob whom he loves. So he

Selah.

God is lyfted up with great tryumphe: the lord is exalted with the noise of
trompet.

Singe ye to god singe / singe ye to our king / sing.

For god is the king of the universal earth: singe ye with wisdom.

God is king over the ge^tils / god sits in his seat royal.

The chief rulers of the people ar gatherd together before the God of Abraham:

For he is miche more excellent and above the goddis which are the defenders of
the earth.

The title of the Psalm. 48. The song of praise of the sons of Chore.
The Argument.
It is a praise of Jerusalem / which is a figure of the church and of every
faithful soul.

THe lord be magnified and highly praised / for the cite of our god / his
holy hill.

The mount zion / in whose northsyde the cite of the great king is situate /
is a beutyful lady / and the flower of the hole land.

God is well known in her / by the defense of her houses.

For lo / when kings either came thither or passed forebye it:

When they now behold it / they be so astonyed / amassed / and so wonder there
at:

They be so afraid there at and sorrow as it were women in time of their trauele.

They be in like fere / as though a soden storm should blow from the southe
and alto break the ships of the sea.

These things have we herd and seen in the cite of the lord of powers / even
in the cite of our God god might preserve her for ever. so he might
Selah.

We express thy goodness oh god in the middis of thy temple.

Eu^n as thy majesty / so is thy praise spread unto the uttermost ends of the
world: for thy rightha^de is full of justice.

The mount zion might be glad the daughters off Judah moughte rejoice for thy
iugementes.

Walk ye round about zion / vewe and tell her towers.

Consider well her wallis / and buyld up her howses / that she may be a
memorial for them to come.

For here is god / ye our god for ever into everlasting: he will be our goyde
as long as we live

The Title The song adhori^torye of the sons of Chore.
The Argument.
A contemninge of worldely things.

Hear this thing al people / give ear al ye that inhabit the hole world.

As well the lowest and highest / as rich and pore.

My mouth shall speak wisdom / and my heart shall express trwe intelligence.

I shall diuerte unto parables / and propowne my derke allegories in meter.

Wherefore should I fere any myschaunce at any time / and so wrap my self in an
heap of troubles? For as for them that trust in their goodis / and glory in
the multitude of their riches: none of them in any manner off wise may redeem
his brother from death nor bye his life of god.

No man may give the price of his life here to live ever / never to feel
corrupcion: for this perpetuyte is denied him.

For ye may se as well the wise as the fool both alyke dye and perissh / and
leave their riches to other.

Although yet they had decreed to have dwelt ever in their own closettis and
howses / and to magnify their names upon the earth / ever to endure in their
posterite.

When it may not be given to man / that he should rest with his riches / but
in this thing he is like the beastis.

Siche is the pathe of foles / and their posterite go in unto the same. so they
do.
Selah.

Whom redacte into their grave / death lies fedinge upon them / as the flok
upon their pasture.

But the just shall be in light / when the tresure of these ungodly shall be
consumed / and hell shall be their hospital.

^ut god shall redeem my soul from the power of hell / and counforte me. so he
shall.
Selah.

Be not afraid when thou seist a man made rich / and the glory of his house
encresed.

For at his death he shall / of al nothing receive / nether his glory shall not
follow him.

But while he lives his soul is called happy / he is praised while he is in
prosperity.

But when he shall pass away to his fathers kynnered / he shall neuermore se
light.

Man when he is in price and honor / he is without consideracion he is
compared and like the brute beastis.

The Title of the Psalm. 50 The song of Asaph.
The Argument.
Here he threteneth / god to come and to rebuke our vnrightwisnes whereby we
worship him contrary to his mind / and those things wherein he would chiefly
be worshyped / we leave utterly undone.

THe lord god so strong (the earth called up from the east unto the weste
and from that goodly zion) shall speak / comi^ge in his majesty.

For our god shall come and not tarry / a deuoueringe fire shall go before him /
and rownd about him a vehement whirlewinde.

He shall call to him heaven above / and the earth beneth / to co^tende with his
people in judgment.

Sainge / be you gatherd together before me my faithful / joined to my
covenant concerning trwe sacrifices.

Here the heuens shall preche his rightwismakinge / for god him self will be
judge. so he will
Selah.

Hear my people / for I shall speak / o Israel be thou thy self witness /
whither I be not god: yea and that even thy god.

Did I ever rebuke the for thy sacrifices? or for thy daily brent offeraunces
to be offered before me?

Did I ask either bull of thy house or got out of thy fold?

For / mine are all the beastis of the wodes / and thousandis beasts upon the
mountains.

The birds of the hills ar well known to me: and of the foulis of the field
am not I ignorant.

If I have lust to ete / I need not tell the / for all the world is mine and
whatsoever is in it.

Do I ete o ye flesh? or dri^ke I gotis blood? Slaye thankis geuinge unto the
lord: and pay thy promises unto the most high god

And then call upon me in time off tribulacion / and I shall deliver the: to
thentent thou shuldst magnify me.

But contraryewyse / thus speaks god unto the ungodly: wherefore prechest thou
my law / and take my covenant into thy mouth?

When yet thou hate my discipline / and castest my words at thy tail?

When thou have gotten a thief thou runnest with him: and laist in thy lotte
with aduouterers.

Thou openneste thy mouth unto myscheif: and thy tongue painteth forth desaytes.

Thou sit and spekest agenste thy nowne brother / and vexest unjustly thy
mothers son.

These things thou doist / and yet do I wynke thereat / besyds all this as
though this were not enough / thou think me but like thy self: but I
shall reason and conuynce the / and set my self in thy sight.

Considere these things I pray you / whereby the rememberaunce of god is
fallen away: lest when I pluck you away / there be none to deliver you.

Who so slays laud and thankis geuinge / he magnifieth me / and by this way
shall I show him that sauinge health that comethe from god.

The Title of the Psalm. 51. The song adhortatory of David / concerning the
co^mi^ge of the prophet Nathan unto him after that he had had ado with
Bathsaba.ij. Reg. xij.
The Argument.
A mind knowleginge her self gylty of aduoutry and murder / prays
fervently that the lord would restore her / her former faith and confidence
and tranquilite of mind

Have mercy upon me oh god / according unto thy goodness: for thy great
infinite mercyes do away my transgressions.

Now and yet agene wash me from my wikednes / and pourge me fro my sin.

For my transgressions do I knowledge / and my sin never gothe out of my mind.

Agenst the only to have so sinned it beruweth me and it repe^teth me to have
had done this greuouse sin in thy sight: wherefore justify me acordinge to
thy promise and make me clean according to thy equite.

Behold / with sorrow and pain was I borne: and with sin my mother
conceived me.

Bespreigne me with ysope and I shall be clean: wash me / and so shall I be
whyter than snow:

Show me joy and gladness / and my bones shall rejoice / which thou have b^oken.

Auerte thy face fro my sins / and do away al my iniquites.

Create a clean heart in me oh god and a stable spirit renew with in me.

Cast me not out of thy sight: and thy holy spirit take not fro me Restore me
the gladness of thy sauinge health: and sustain me with thy fre benign spirit.

And I shall direct transgressors into thy way: and sinners shall be converted
unto the.

Deliver me from that blody sin oh god / oh god my savior / that my tongue
might magnify the form of thy rightwysmakinge.

Open my lips / Oh Lord / that my mouth might sheweforthe thy praise.

For if thou louedst any slain sacrifice / I would pay it unto the: but brent
sacrifices delyght not the.

The sacrifice that god desierth / is a contrite spirit / a broken and hombled
heart / these things (oh god) thou despises not.

Be thou good and merciful therefore unto zion / that the wallis off Jerusalem
might be edified and preserved.

For thus will thou be pleased with the slain sacrifices of rightwisnes / with
offraunce and brent sacrifice / thus shall the very bullocks be put upon thy
autare.

The Title of the Psalm. 52. An admonicion adhortatorye of David as touching
the trecharye of Doeg the Idumey telling Saul that David was come into the
house of Abimelech.
The Argument.
He rebukes proud temerariouse tongued and shows what vengeance abides
them

Wherefore thus arrogantlye magnifiest thou thy self at al times / o myscheuous
geaunt?

Wherefore enforces thy tongue myscheife forginge desayte like a new set
raser?

Wherefore love thou malice rather then honestye / rather to lie then to say
the troth? As thou doist.
Selah. For thou delytest in all manner off perniciouse speech / oh fraudulent
tongue.

Wherefore / even god shall utterly rende thevp by the rootis / and destroy
the: he shall throo the down alto broken out of thy tabernacle / and pluck
up thy rootis out off the land off the living men. So he shall.
Selah.

Which thing / the just saying they shall be astonned / saying thus with scorn
upon him.

Lo this geaunt / which took not god for his strength / but trusted in the
multitude of his riches / cleuinge unto his own myscheif and desayte.

But I my self being off the familye of God flouresshinge like the grene
olyue / shall trust in the goodness of god for ever and ever I shall give the
perpetual tha^kis for thy goodness done unto me / I shall worship thy name / for
because it is right accept unto thy faithful.

The Title of the psalm. 53 An admonicion adhortatorye of David concerning the
heretage.
The Argument.
It affirms al men to be ungodly and very sinners / and the ungodly rather to
feign / then to have the fere of god: and the salvation of the godly to come of
the lord.

THe vayn liars say in their hertes / that god is not god: for they are
corrupt with sin and are become abominable / there is none that will do good.

God lokedforth off heaven upon the children of Adam / to se whither any man
favored and sought god.

And here every man was gone from him / they were altogether corrupt / none
did good / no not won. Is it not manifest that they commit sin? that they
devour my people like meat? and that they call not upon god?

That they fere things not to be fered? but god shall shake the bones in sondre
of them that fight agenst the (oh Christ)

Thou shall confound them / for god aborreth them.

Oh / would God that the sauinge health were once sent from zion unto Israel?
that when God restore the captivity of his people / Jacob might be glad and
Israhel rejoice.

The Title of the Psalm. 54. The admonicion adhortatorye of David / sunge at the
orgains / when the zepheis went and told Saul that David was hyde and lay
preuely among them.i. Reg. xxiij. and.xxvi.
The Argument.
An inuocacion of one being in great distress / and aknowleginge of goddis
benefits.

GOd / for thy namis sake save me / and deliver me by thy power.

Oh God here my prayer / give ear unto the wordis off my mouth.

For strange enimes are risen age^ste me: and cruel tyraunts having no
respect unto God / seek my life. so they do.
Selah.

But lo / God brings me help / the lord sustaineth my soul.

He shall requite evil unto my enymes / and for his trow this sake destroy them.

Lyberally therefore shall I sacrifye unto the: and shall praise thy name oh
lord / for it is good.

For he has delivered me out off al tribulacion / so that now mine eye se her
pleasure upon mine enymes.

orgayns.
The Argument.
A fervent prayer / whiles our fre^dis aliened from us / ar become more cruel

OH god here my prayer and turn not away my desire.

Attend unto me and here me beginning and kryinge with great noise.

For the yellinge out of my enymes / for the fierce incursion off the ungodly:
obiectinge great crimes agenst me which now in a furye are bent to run upon
me:

My herre faints in me / and deadly fear is east upon me.

Fear and tremblinge are fallen into me / and horrible dread overwhelmed me.

And I thought with my self / would god I had dowues wings that I might fle
away to have rest.

Lo / then would I fle full far hence / and diuerte into the wilderness so I
would
Selah.

I would speed me to escape more swiftly then any great soden whirlewynde.

Skater them lord and dyuyde their tongues: for I saw the cite full of
iniurye and sedicion.

Which myscheif / day and night walked about the wallis of it / and in the
mids thereof was there miserable affliccion and heuye heapis of miserye.

In the middis thereof wiked fraud: usury and desayte go never ou^ of her
streatis.

But and if it had been mine enemy that thus reuyled and vexed me / I coud
have borne it: and if my haters had thus oppressed me / I could have had
avoided them.

But it was thou oh my nowne fellow / my companion / my familiare / so well
known: unto whom I committed so lovingly my secretis / with whom gladly I
went in to the house of god.

Fle thou upon them oh death / and let them go quick into their graves / for
malice reigns in their hous^s / and myscheife dwells secretly in their
hertis.

But I cried unto god / and the lord saved me.

Have mercy upon me / o god / for there is one that tredeth me down and with
continual war vexes me.

My daily enymes trede me under their fete / for there are many that proudly
fight agenste me.

But yet when so ever any fear assayleth me / then in the (o lord) do I
trust.

In the promise of god do I glory in god do I trust: nether do I fere what man
can do to me.

They malign and vex me in all that I do or say / they take al their
counsails to myscheue me.

They dissemble and keep themself closse / they observe my stepis and wait
how they might take my soul.

But yet al in vain / for it shall escape from them: for it is thou Oh god
which in thy wrath castest down the multitude of the people.

Thou tellest my flightis / and my teres thou put up into thy botell / are
they not al in thy rekeninge book?

What day so ever I call upon the / anon my enymes turn their backs /
whereby I am certified verily that thou art my god.

In goddis word do I glory / in the promise of the Lord do I rejoice.

In God is my trust / I fere not what so ever man can do to me.

Unto the (oh god) shall I hole commit my self / unto the shall I give thankis.

For it is thou that haste delyuerd my soul from death: ye and my fete from
slydinge / that I might walk before god in the light off the lyuinge.

The Title of the psalm. 57 The song adhortatory of David Called / Destroy me
not / and called also the delicate. When he fled from Saul into the Den.i.
regum.xxij. and.xxiiij.
The Argument.
A thankis geuinge for the marvelous delyueraunce from his so great perels.

Have mercy upon me (oh god) have mercy upon me / for in the do my soul
trust and under the shadew of thy wings is my confidence until this malice
be passed over.

I cry unto the high God / even God which finesheth all that he has begun
in me.

He shall send from heaven and deliver me: he shall cast him into shame and
obprobrye that ceasseth not to trede me under his fete / he shall send me help
I say for his goodness and trouthes sake.

He will deliver my soul lyinge in the mids of these wode lions that is to
say emonge the sons of Adam / whose tethe are speres and darts / but their
tongue is a sharp sword.

Be thou exalted o god above the heuens / and liftvp thy glory and majesty
above all the earth.

For they have prepared a net for my fete to take my soul / they have dug
up a pit before me into the which / their selves shall fall. So they shall.
Selah.

My heart is ready oh god / my heart is redye to singe and praise the Awake my
soul awake with harp and Lute / and I my self shall awake right erlye.

That I might magnify the Oh lord emonge the people / and praise the among
the gentiles.

For thy great goodness recheth up unto the sky / and thy faithfulness unto the
clouds:

Be thou exalted o God above the sky and lift up thy gloriouse majesty above
all the earth.

The title of the Psalm. 58. The song of David adhortatorye called Destroy me
not.
The Argument.
The audacite of the ungodly even from their mothers womb is described / and
what end abidethe them.

IF ye think trwly upon justice: judge then that at right is / ye sons of
Adam.

But ye rather conceive sin and myscheif in your hertis / your hands be
stretched forth unto robery and rauine upon the earth.

The ungodly are naught even from their mothers womb / they err anon as they
be borne / speking lies.

They boil in them selue as hot in venom as edders / they stop their
ears like the wylye deffe serpent called aspis.

Which wilnot here the voice off the charmere / charm he never so wyselye.

Oh god alto break their tethes in their mouths / break them in peses / even
the very wange tethe of these lions whelpis oh Lord

Make them melte and so sink away like water: when they bend to shote their
arowes / break them in pesis with their own shaftis. Dry them up like
snailis / and consume them like the child borne before the time ere it ever
see son.

Pluck them up like an hawthorne / before their thorns be sharp / let a
soden whirlewinde with great violence take them away quycke.

So that then the rightwise may well rejoice / when he see this vengeance /
and bathe his fete in the blood of the ungodly.

For even then shall it be said / verily / the reward abides the rightwyse:
douteles it is God that yet delyuerethe us upon the earth.

closed his house about / to haueslayne him.

For lo / they lay awayte for my life / horribly they run upon me giltlesse

They are bente and comen upon me fautlesse: arise and behold / and help me.

But thou therefore oh lord god of powers the god of Israel / arise and
punysshe all these haithen: pitye not al these wiked transgressors No do not
Selah.

Let them run wanderinge about the cite until euentyde howlinge like hounds.

Lo they lay agenste me with their mouths / swerdis are in their lips /
thinkinge that none shall punesshe them.

But thou lord skornest them / and despysest al these haithen.

From the / do I acknowledge my strength to have come to me: for thou (oh god)
art my castle.

Oh God / it is thy goodness that preuenteth me / it is god that techeth me how
to handle my enimes Slaye them not (says he) lest my people be made negligent:
but skater them away by thy nowne power and cast them down / oh lord our
shilde.

For the sin of their own mouth / for the speech off their own lips /
and their own pride.

Let them be trapped and taken: for their periurye and lies / let each of them
al be fables in mennis mouths.

Consume them in thy wrath consume them that they nowhere apere / that men may
se unto the uttermost coostis off the earth that it is the lord that reigns
over Jacob. So it is.
Selah.

Let them wander and run about the cite until night / howlinge like hounds.

Even so let these men be skatered abroad to seek their meat / but let them
sleep with emptye belles

But I shall praise thy strength given me / and erely preche thy mercy / for
thou haste been my defender and my refuge in time off my distress.

Unto the (oh my strength) shall I singe / for thou (oh God) thou art my
protector / my God / my tresure.

Ioas / whence he returninge slew in the vale of Salis above.xij thousand of
the Idumeys.ij. Regum.viij. and.x. and.j. Paralipo.xviij.
The Argument.
After the Phyliste^s had sore assawred him / he praid the lord for his
promises sake to restore and make perfect his kingdom.

OH god thou had repelled and broken us: thou disdaynest and thrustest us
from the.

Thou have smiten together and broken our land / heal her breaches for she
reeleth like to fall.

Thou shewdst thy people sore and heavy chances / thou gave us a cup off
wine full off fear and dread.

But give a token (I pray the) to them that fere the / that they may take
heart again at the cominge of thy rightwisnes and equite. So they may
Selah.

That thy well-beloved might be delivered: hear and save us with thy right
hand.

God has promised it in his holy temple / which promise makes me glad: I shall
diuyde Sichem / and meat out the vale of Suchoth Galaad is mine / and Manasses
is mine / Ephraim is the strength of my head / Judah is my leader.

Moab is my goodly pot / unto Idumea shall I stretche forth my shoes / the
Philistens shall come to me with joy.

Who directed me unto the defensed cite? Who led me unto Idumeam?

Was it not thou (oh god) which had once forsaken us / and did not goforth
with our hooste?

Which helpest us in our need / for vain is mannis help.

But by the power of god we shall do great thingis right well: for it is he that
tredeth down our enymes.

For thou art my hope / my strong tower to defend me from my enymes.

Let me dwell in thy tabernacle for ever / let me be suer under the koueringe

fearers of thy name.

Thou shall add mo days unto the kings age / that his yeris may endure
through every generation.

preserve him

And thus shall I praise thy name for ever / that I might daily perform my
promyses.

The Title of the psalm. 62. The song adhortatory of David.
The Argument.
A soden prayer which proceeds out of a pure faith.

ANd yet shall my soul observe and wait upon god alone / for of him depends
my salvation.

And yet is he only my stonney rock / and sauinge health / he is my proppe
that I shall not greatly reele.

How long lay ye awayte for whom ye list all you together / and slaye down
right / as a relynge wall or roten hedge is cast down?

your counsel is only of his state and to cast him down / ye delight in lies
/ ye praise with your mouth and curse with your heart. So ye do.
Selah.

But yet shall my soul observe and wait upon god only / for of him depends
my abydinge.

And yet is he only my rock and my salvation / he is my proppe that I slide
not.

Unto god cleuethe my salvation and all that I have / my trwe glory / my
strength and my hope is in god Trust in him ye people at al times / power forth
your hertis before him / it is god which is our hope everlasting.

But yet full vain are the childerne of Adam: they be so vain liers that if
thou layest them in a payer of bylaunces against vanite / yet will vanite way
the^ al done together Put not your trust in injury and robery / give not your
selves to vanite / riches if they flow unto you / set not your heart upon them

Once did god speak a certain thing which I herd more then once or twyse /

And that thou lord art all good and mercyful / and that thou lord geuest
unto every man after his deadis.

if I were in thy holy temple to behold thy strength and glory.

For thy goodness is miche better to me then this life / and my lips praise
the.

Wherefore al days of my life do I magnify the: and in thy name lift I up my
handis.

My soul is satisfied as it were with fate delicates / when my mouth with glad
lips praise the. Even in my bed do I think upon the / and in the watchis
of the night I remember the.

For it is thou that helpest me / and in the shadewe of thy wings do I rejoice.

My soul cleueth fast unto the / thy righthonde sustayneth me

In vain therefore do these men seek my soul: for under the earth sone shall

Defend me from the preuye enginnes of the maliciouse / and from the wodnes
off them that work myscheif.

Which whette their tongues like a sword / and bend their bows to shote
forth their dedly arowes.

Preuely to smite the innocent and suddenly to tache him / for they are without

They have decreed a myscheife among themselves / they have counseled
together of snares preuely to be bente / saying: who shall se them?

They seek ungracious counsails they be al given to invent myscheif every man
in his own bosom and breast.

But god shall smite them vnwaris with his arowe / where with they shall be
plaged.

Then shall their own tongues so wound them selves / that who so see them shall
tremble.

Then shall every man understand and sheweforth the work off god / and say it
was wisely done. The just shall in the mean ceaso^ be glad in the lord / and
trust in him / and al men shall rejoice which are right in heart.

flowresshe into thy praise Thou visitest the earth / thou watereste it and

Which by his power raignethe from everlasting / his eyes behold the gentiles
/ who so forsake him shall not exalte them selves. No they shall not
Selah.

Loaue our God O ye people / and putforth a loud / the voice off his praise.

Which endeweth us with life / and suffers not our fete once to slide Although
yet thou prouest us (oh God) to try us even as silver is tried: Bringinge us
into the stockis and gyrdynge our loins with chains.

Thou layest sore men upon our headis as burdens upon beastis / we go through
fire and water / but thou ledest us out into great refresshinge.

I am come therefore unto thy house with burnt sacrifices to pay unto the my
vows which I promised with my lips and expressed with my mouth when I was in

his way / which is carried unto us as the son unto the west Whose name is
The Lord
Jehovah. rejoice ye before him.

For he will be father to the fatherless / delyuerer off the pore wedewes / even

As thou did in deed
Selah.

The earth was shaken together / the heue^s did sweat at thy presence (o god)
which apperedst in Sinai / eue^ at thy presens (oh god) which art the god of
Israel.

Even god which of thy liberalite sendest showers unto thy heretage / and when
it is syke and pore thou restorest and refresshest it agene.

And efte sone thy droues and heerdes of beastis graaze in it / which thing
(oh God) thou procureste unto the poor / off thy nowne goodness.

Lord it is thou which committest it unto those women to show thy
commandment from the great hooste.

That kings with their hoostis be fled and slipped away / and the pore
homely divided the spoil. Then shall ye rest like the river between the ba^kes
/ as it were betwixt the wy^ges of the dove whyter then silver / whose yel^w
back shyneth above any gold / which dove hangs in the air.

Whiles the almighty god / which rules and commands eue^ the kings / had

snow.

And that Basan should be the hill of God / ye Basan should be that hill which
should be pale for the abundance of cheese.

holy temple.

Thou ascendest on high / the captivity captiued / giftis received emonge men:
ye thou receiuedst thy very enimes that they might dwell with the lord god.

Thankis be unto the Lord God through every age / which has laden us with
his wholesome benefits. so he has.
Selah.

Even unto god which is unto us a savior: ye unto the Lord God by whom we
escape the death.

Even unto God which on the the other side smyteth his enemies: he smyteth of the
crown of the hearye obstinat head off the forlorn man perseueringe in his
myscheife.

For the lord said / I shall restore my beloved from Bassan / I shall restore
him from the deep sea

So that thy foot and the tongue of thy houndis shall be dipped in the blood of
thy enimes.

Al men shall behold the po^pe off thy triumph (oh God) the going of my god
and my king which art in the secret holy place

Singers shall comeforth agenste the with musyk instruments / and with maidens
playnge upon their virginals.

ye and even the hole congregation shall praise god / they shall loaue the even
at the wellis o lord of israel Here shall litel Benjamin go before the princes
of Judah / as zabulo^ and Nephtalim and shall judge them Thus has thy God
stablesshed thy strength: Confirm (o god) that thing which thou have done for
us upon thy temple and upon Jerusalem.

Unto the / even kings shall bring gifts.

Thou shall drive beasts with a reed / the droues and herdis with their
calves / that is to say the gentiles kickinge agenst the / and gouen unto
riches / thou shall skater the people which delight in battle.

There shall come ambassiadours from Egypt / a marvelous great power off
india shall run unto God.

The kingdoms of the earth shall singe unto god / they shall singe unto the
Lord. So they shall.
Selah.

Which sits rydinge from the beginning upon the heuens / and puts forth
his voice / ye and that a mighty voice.

Attribute power and strength unto the god of Israel / whose magnificence and
might recheth unto the clouds.

God is to be dreaded from his secret sanctuary / even the God off Israel
which gives unto his people power and strength. Glory be unto god.

The Title of the psalm. 69. The song of David adhortatorye called Liles /
Roses / or Violets.
The Argument.
A prayer of one in great and long distress which is the figure of the
sufferaunce of Christ and of his members.

Save me god / for waters are entered and pearse me unto my soul.

I steke in the deep claye where is no botome I am come in to the deep sea /
and the violent streme ouerwhelmeth me.

I am weary of cryinge / my throat is hoorse / my eyes are wasted with lokinge
up unto my god.

They that hate me are far mo then the hears of my head.

My enymes wex strong and oppress me with out a cause / ye falsely they
persecute me: and those things which I never took / now am I constrained to
repaye.

God / thou knoweste my simplicite / and my fawtes are not hid from the.

Let them not (I beseech the) be shamed for my sake which trust in the (oh
lord god of powers) let them not (I pray the) be confounded through me /
which seek the (oh god of Israel.

For / for thy sake I am both reuyled / and shame covers my face. I am
become a stranger unto my nowne brethren / and a way farer to my mothers
childerne.

For / the zele that I bear to thy house has procured me sorrow / the
spightful rebukes of men reuylinge the / fyl upon me.

I wept and febled my self with fast: but al was turned into my shame and
obprobrye.

I did upon me sack / but for so doing they iested upon me.

They made me their laughing stok that sat in the gate / and the dronkerds in
tauerns made songs upon me.

But here in good time I offer my prayer unto the (oh lord god) help me for
thy infinite mercy / with thy present and assuered salvation Take me up out
off this toughe claye / and let me no longer steke in it / deliver me from my
haters and from the depth off this sea.

Let not / I beseech the / these swellinge waters ouerwhelme me / nor this
whirlepitte swelowe me in / and shut up her mouth over me.

Here me (oh Lord) for thy sweet goodness / for thy infinite mercy look upon me.

And turn not thy face from thy servant / for I am in distress / haste the
to help me.

Draw nighe to redeem me / deliver me / for because my enymes blaspheme the.

Thou know my obprobrye / rebukes / shame / and ignomynye / all my enymes
are in thy sight.

My heart is broken and overcome with obprobryes and rebukes / I look for some
to pity me / but there is non: I waited for some counforters / but I find non.

They did put gall into my meat and when I thirsted they gave me to drink
vinaiger.

Let their own table before them be turned into their own snare / requyte
them with like meat and drink into their own fall.

Let their eyes be derkened that they se not / and their loins weak
continually to slide.

Power forth upon them thy indignacion / and let the furye off thy wrath take
them.

Let their houses be desolate / and in their tabernacles no man to dwell.

For whom thou had smiten they yet persecuted: and wounded him who^ thou
had plaged.

Lay upon heapis off myscheife for them selves / and let them never be
partakers of thy rightwysmakinge.

Blot them out of the book of the living men / And let them not be written
emonge the just.

But me / both pore and sorrowful let thy sauinge health defend oh god.

That I might magnifye the name of god in meter / and extol it highely with
thankis geuinge.

Where in the lord miche more delyteth then in bullis and calves armed with
horn and houue.

Hereto have ye respect oh ye ho^ble and rejoice / seek god and your soul
shall live.

For the lord hereth the pore afflicte / and his presoners he despises not.

Heaven and earth might praise him / the sea and what so ever crepith in it
loaue him.

For god shall save zion / and the cytes of Judah shall be preserved / inhabited
and possessed.

For the sead of his servants shall possede it: and who so love his name shall
dwell in it.

This Psalm is off the same Argument with the former.
OH god speed the to deliver me / oh lord haste the into my help.

Ashamed and confounded might they be / that seek my soul / let them be
turned bakwarde with shame which covet to hurt me. Let them be put to flight
with confusion which with a gaude cry at me / ohe ohe.

But they al might joy and be glad in the / which seek the and love that
sauinge health which is of the / they might say contynually / god be highly
praised.

I am careful and pore (oh God): but thou lord haste the to help / and
deliver me / and tarry not.

The Argument.
A prayer and thankis geuinge that the Lord voichsaueth to be present as well
in our age / as yougth / because there is no age with out tribulacion

IN the / oh lord / do I trust let me never be confounded for thou delyuerest
and take me unto the for thy mercyes sake / thou hear me and thou sauest
me.

Thou art my strong rock unto whom I ever flee / thou haste decreed to save
me / for thou art my rock and my buswerke.

My god deliver me from the hand of the ungodly / and from the power off the
unjust and cruel man.

For thou (Lord God) art my expectacion and my hope even from my youghth.

Unto the do I cleue even from my mothers womb / thou pluckedst me out of my
mothers bellye / wherefore all my praise I do spend upon the.

I am become a prodigiouse monster unto many men / but thou art my trust.

Wherefore I praise the with full mouth / my mouth is full of thy glory at al
time.

Cast me not away in mine old age / and when now my strength fails me /
se that thou yet forsakest me not.

For my enymes conspyre agenste me / and they that lay awayte for my soul
counsel together saying.

God has forsaken him / perswe and take him / for there is none to help him.

God / be not far fro me / my God haste the to help me.

They might be ashamed and perissh that are agenst my soul / let them be
kouered with obprobrye and ignominye which study to hurt me.

But let me be ever constant / and encrese only all thy gloriouse praise.

Let my mouth magnify thy rightwysmakinge and thy saving health at al time /
whereof I know non end.

Let me entreyn lord to remember thy power and thy rightwismakinge only.

For thou (god) even fro my chyldehede unto this present day techest me to
preche thy marvelous acts.

Forsake me not now in mine old age and hoar head (oh god) that I might yet
preche thy power unto this posterite and declare thy arm unto all men to come.

And also extolle highly thy rightwisnes (oh god) whereby thou have finesshed
great things / (oh God) who is like the?

Which haste showed me tribulacions and many grievous affliccions / and efte
sone thou restoredst me and lyftedst me up agene / eue^ out of the deep earth.

Thou encreasedst me with honor and dignite / and after my trouble did
counforte me.

Wherefore I do magnify the and thy truth (oh my god) with Lute and Orgains /
I singe unto the with harp o holy maker of israel My lips desyer to praise
the / ye my soul which thou have redeemed desiereth to loaue the.

My tongue is evermore talkinge of thy just dealinge: for they are confounded
and shamed that honte to do me myscheife.

The title of the Psalm. 72. The prayer of Solomon
The Argument.
A prayer for himself / and his people: whereby christ and his chirch is
signified.

OH god / endewe the king with equite / give the son of the king grace to
ministre justice.

That he might rule the people with justice / and govern thy pore with equite.

Let the mountains bring peace unto the people / and the hille tops
rightwisnes.

That he might in judgment delyuere the most pore emonge the people / and
preserve the nedions / but the violent extorsioner utterly destroy.

That they might the more fear the through al generacions as long as the
son and moan shall walk round about the earth.

Let equite and justice come down unto the earth like rain into a new mowen
medewe / and like the sweet honey dropes standing upon the grass.

Let justice flourish in his time / and myche peace endure as long as the moon
keeps her course.

And let him rule from the one sea unto the the other / and from the floude
Euphrates unto the worlds end.

Before him the Ethiopes shall fall down / and his enymes lik the earth.

The kings of the sea and eylandes shall bring him gifts / the kings of
Arabye and Sabe shall bring him presents.

Al kings might worship him all gentyles might serve him

That he might deliver the complayninge pore supplyaunt / and help the
careful socourlesse.

That he might have compassion on the pore need one / and preserve the lives
off the homble oppressed.

Redeminge them from danger and iniurye and esteminge their blood so
precyouse.

He might live and have given him of the gold of Arabye / be he worshipped
with out end and magnifyed for ever.

There might be so great plenty of wheat in the earth through out the hille
tops / that they might wave and smite them together like the trees of
Libanus: they might groweforth before the cite like the grass of the earth.

His name might endewre foreeuer / his name might wex fresshe and young like
the son.

Al nations be blessed in him / all folk might preche him blessed.

Praised be the lord god / the God of Israel / which alone does marvelous
things.

And praised be the name off his majesty for ever / and the earth universal be
fulfilled with his majesty. Amen. Amen.

The end of the prayers of David the son of Iesse.
The title of this Psalm. 73. The song of Asaph
The Argument.
The e^ercyse and increase of faith which is greatly offended at the prosperity
of the ungodly: but when she espyeth the unlike end of the good and badde: she
comes agene to her self with great consolacyon.

OH how sweet is the God of Israel unto them which are pure in heart.

My fete verily were almost gone my fotinge had almost failed me. When I fill
into a fond anger mind to se al things prosperously succeed with the ungodly.

They bear no burdens / but be in al ease and riches.

They be not oppressed with mortal myserye of men / nether beaten like other
men.

Wherefore they are so pufte up with pride that they be drowned in myscheife
and iniurye.

So that for their wealy riches they be given unto al lusts / and follow the
desyers off their own hertis.

Al things do they abhor / save those only which they them selves speak /
ye and that so proudly They stretcheforth their mouth up into heaven / but
their tongue wandreth through the world.

Wherefore they have their flok here folowinge them: and here comes forth their
so great auau^tage. yea / and they dare say also / how should god know it /
and how should the high god weit it?

Wherefore thus considered I with my self: lo these ungodly and rich men
possess riches perpetually.

In vain therefore do I purify my heart: in vain do I wash my hands with
innocencye.

In vain am I beaten all the day and chastened all the hole night.

Whiles I thus (I say) co^sydered with my self / I had almost reproved the
fellowship of thy childern. And I thought then to know that thing which was
right hard and heuye for me to know.

Until I was entered into the secret holy place of god / and considered the
end of these men.

That is to wete / that thou had set them in a slybery place / to cast them
down hedelinge.

Lord how suddenly are they baneshed and destroyed / consumed with sundry
myseheifes?

Nonotherwyse the^ a dream after a man is a wake / for even so lord thou
doist away their image out of the cite.

But on this manner in the mean time my heart consumed in bitterness / and my
raynes were grievously tormented.

Thus I brent and glowed in foleshnes / and in my nowne consaight was I but a
beast.

Whiles thou yet never fayledste me but heldest me up by my right hand.

Thou ledst me by thy counsel and efte sone tokest me up honorably.

Oh how great glory is laid up for me in heuenreversed? for as fore erthely
things / when I compare them unto the / I contempne them.

My flesh / my heart and all fail me / for god is the strength off my heart
and my part for ever.

For lo / who so go far from the / they are but lost / thou destroyest al
them which (thy majesty contempned) play the herlets.

But I thought it best for me to cl^ne unto God / to trust unto the Lord God
and preche al his noble actis.

The Title of the psalm. 74. The admonicion of Asaph.
The Argument.
A prayer of them being in the captivity of Babylon / liftinge up their minds
to God / that he suffer them not long therein to be plaged.

Wherefore (o god) put us away for ever? wherefore is thy wrath thus kyndled
agenste the flok of thy pasture?

Remember thy congregation whom thou had gotten the off a long time paste /
forgete not the scepter of thy heretage whom thou haste redeemed / even this
hill off zion wherein thou dwell.

Lift up thy fete quickly agenst these destruccions / for thy adversary has
destroyed al things in thy holy place.

Thy enymes singe and rore in thy solemn feste days / they set up tokens off
victory the pinnacles.

So that men thought they had herd axes hewi^ge of the timber above / a great
noyfe came upon them like thonder.

All then graven work of the temple is shaken and smyten down with twibits
and hamers.

Thy holy temple is set on fire / the house of the glory of God is profaned
and said smothe with the grownde.

And they say with them selves / let us destroy them all at once / let all
the solemn festis off God be banesshed out off the earth.

The tokens which thou sometime shewdst our fathers now we se them not / there
is no prophet more / there is not one that can se be it never so litel.

How long (O God) shall thy enimye reuyle? Shall thy aduersarye blaspheme thy
name thus ever?

Wherefore haste thou utterly plucked in thy hand / wherefore haste thou put
thy right hand into thy bosom?

O God / thou art my gouerner even from the beginning / and what so ever
salvation is in the world it is thy work.

Thou skaterest the waters of the sea / thou brekest the headis of the great
dragons which dwell in the waters.

Thou brekest the hard scale off this Leuiathan / and geuest him into meat
unto the people of indye Thou cuttest forth spring and floude / thou dryest
up the main seas.

The day is thine / the night is thine / thou set forth the light and
son in their bright aparel.

Thou have set fast the coostes off the earth / somer and winter thou have made
them.

Wherefore remember (o lord) the rebukes of thy aduersarye / and of this
stockisshe people which blasph^meth thy name.

Betake not thy turtle dove unto the cruel beast / forgete not thy pore
afflicte for ever.

Behold thy covenant / for the derke howses of the earth are al full of
myscheif.

Let not the pore contrite and ashamed be repelled / nether the homble adflicte
which loaue thy name.

Arise God / defend thy cause / remember the obprobrye wherewith the folysshe
man blasphemeth the daily.

Forgete not the proud voice off thy enymes / for ye pride of the^ that make
insurrection agenst ye / increases vehemently.

The song of Asaph adhortatorye / called / Ne perdas / the Hymn of thanks
geuinge.
The Argument.
The cold negligent prayth to be restored unto his office / and promyseth to
do it worthily / for the time stands upon that the Lord will puneshe the
World

WE shall praise the (oh god) we shall praise thy present name / and thy noble
and clear factis we will declare forth.

When the time appointed shall come / I shall judge that at good and right is.

Although the earth and all that inhabit it / be syke and feeble / yet will I
sustain her pylers. So I will
Selah.

I shall say to the foles / se that ye do not folyshly: and unto the ungodly /
se that ye extol not your power.

Lift not up your horns over high to think stiefly perverse thingis For
nether from the east nor from the weste nor yet from deserte or from the
hills / shall there come any to defend you.

But God is the delyuerer / this man he casts down and him he lifts up.

For there is a goodly cup full of read wine in his hand which shall be powered
forth / but the dreggis thereof shall all the ungodly off the earth souke and
drink up.

But I shall evermore preche and praise the god of Jacob.

And all the horns of the ungodly shall I break / but the power off the just
shall be exalted.

The song of Asaph adhortatorye and thankful / to be played at the orgains.
The Argument.
A praise and tha^kis for some great victory.

GOd is known in Judah / and great is his name in Israel For in Salem is his
tabernacle and his habitacion in zion.

There has he broken the swyfte arows / bows bucklers swerdes and all the hole
bataile. So he has.
Selah.

Clearer and more to be magifyed art thou then the hills of thieves. For they
their selves shall be robbed / and be they never so bold minded / yet shall they
sleep their deed dream and be brought to naught with all their riches / were
they never so mighty.

For at thy rebuke (o god of Jacob) both carte and horse are overwhelmed.

Thou art to be dreaded / for who may abide in thy sight when thou art angrye?

When thou pronouncest judgment from heaven / then the earth trembles and is
still.

That is to weit / Even when god aryseth unto judgment to deliver all the pore
afflicte of the earth. As he shall ve^ely.
Selah.

For because of this vengeance / men acknowledge and praise ye / to ye intent
thou shuldst bend thy self agene to avenge them.

Dowe ye and pay them unto your lord god all that be here in this company:
bring forth your gyftis unto the most dreadful.

Which interceptith ye breath off princes / he is to be dreaded of the kings
of ye earth.

The title of the Psalm. 77 The song of Asaph committed unto the quere of
Idithum.
The Argument.
Faith is tempted / but she defends her self with the contemplacion of god
and his deadis / but yet is she still tempted / but at last she has the
victory / when she setleth her self in the deep consideracyon of the almighty
power and providence of god.

WIth my voice when I cried unto god / unto god when I cried with my voice / he
gave ear unto me.

When I was troubled / I sought ye lord / my strength wasted every night and
rested not / my soul refused al counfort

When god came into my remembrance / I was in great distress: when I should
begin / my breath failed me. So it did
Selah.

Thou heldst my eye liddes / I was so astoned that I could not speak Then I
remembered ye times past and the worlds over slyden.

I called to mind my songs in the night / I spoke unto my heart and discussed
my mind / saying. Shall ye Lord repel me for ever? shall he never more be
apeased?

Will he with draw his goodness for ever? will he no more speak to our posterite?

Has god forgote^ to have mercy? will he shit up his mercy with his wrath? ye
will he?
Selah.

And at last I was brought unto this saying. Art thou not well in thy mind?

It is (I tell the) the right ho^de of the high God / that makes this mutacion.

I shall remember the workis off the Lord: and gladly call to mind thy old
miracles.

And I shall preche thy excellent dedis / and speak upon thy counsails.

Oh god / thy way lies in thy holy temple / who is so mighty god / as God is?

Thou art god which doist so meruelouse thingis / which makes thy strength
known emo^ge the multitude:

Which have redeemed ye people with thy power / even the sons off Jacob and
Joseph. S^ thou have.
Selah.

Even the waters know the (Oh God) the waters know the and fere the / the
deep seas tremble at the.

The clouds powerforth waters the clouds cast forth thonder / and eft sone
thy arows fle forth on every side.

Thy thondre clappis ar herd rownde about / lighteninges ar smiten forth into
the world / the earth trembles and quaketh.

In the sea thy way lyethe / and thy pathe upon the deep waters / so that no
man can espy thy steps.

Thou leddest forth thy people like a flock of sheep under the governance of
Moses and Aharon.

The enstruccion of Asaph.
The Argument.
An oracion spoken unto the people / money shinge them to be taught by then
samples of their elders / to return into the way.

Hear my law / my people: give ear unto the words of my mouth.

I shall open my mouth to speak parables / and declare the old hard speches.

Which we have both herd and have certeynly known / our fathers so tellinge
us.

Let us not hid them from their childerne in ye world to come / but let us al
preche ye glory of ye lord / his power and strength / and marvelous actis
which he has done For he made a covenant with Jacob / and gave a law unto
Israel / commaundinge our fathers to d^lyuer it forth and teach it they^
childerne.

That their posterite and chylderne to come should both know yt / and also
expowne it unto their childerne.

To thentent they should set fast their hope in god / never to forget his
councils / but keep his precepts And not to be like their fathers a nation
unfaithful / fallinge from god unto false worship / a nacyon that would not be
certyfied in heart / whose spirit and mind was not trwe towerd god.

As were the sons of Ephraim / which for all their featis of war being
never so good archers: yet in time of battle were they scatered and fled.

And all for because they kept not covenant with god: and in his law they
would not walk.

But forgote his counsails / and also his great wondrefull workis / which he
showed them.

Before their fathers he did meruelouse thyngys in the land off Egypt / even
in their plain field called Tanys.

He divided the sea and led them over: and set up the waters of each side like
wallis.

Under the cloud he led them be day: and all the night with clear light.

He cloue in sondre the stonney rocks in the deserte / and gave the^ to drink
there of / as out off a great deep sea.

He dreweforth waters of the stonne / so that they gusshed forth like ryuers.

And yet for all this they sinned agenst him: and exaspera^ed the high god in
that wilderness.

Temptinge god in their hertis requiring mete after their own lust For they
replied agenst god / saying: may god orden be mete in this deserte?

Lo / he smote ye stonne and there flowed forth waters plenteously: but
whither may he not also give mete and prepare flesh as well for his people?

These things herd / ye lord was angrye / and like fire was he kyndled
agenst Jacob / and his indignacion increased agenst Israel:

Because they had not kept promise with god / nether trusted in his wholesome
help.

Over all this / yet he commanded the clouds above / and opened ye gates of
the sky.

To rain them down Manna to eat it / because he would give them heavenly fode.

Here did every man ete that angels fode / for he sent them thereof enough.

He turned about the east wind with ye clowdis / and by his power induced a
south wind.

And so reigned them down flesh upon them as thick as duste and fetherd
fowls as plentye as the sea sandis.

Which he threw into ye middys of their tentis / and rownd about their
tabernacles.

Then they deuowered them up / and were filled above mesure: for he gave them
their own desyer.

They wanted nothing off their apetite: and yet their mete being in their
mouths:

Lo / the wrath of god was kindled over them / and slew the most strongest
of them / and even the picked out of Israel did he cut away But yet above all this they sinned agenste him / for they believed not these so many his miracles.

Wherefore he finesshed their days and not with out a cause / suddenly their
yeris were gone.

Whiles he slew them / they sought him: and suddenly they returned to god.

And remembered that god was their stoney rok: and the high God their redemer.

Al be it with their mouths they flatered him: yet with their tongue they lied.

For their heart was not wholl toward him / nether kept they promise in
covenant with him.

But yet (for all this) full mercyfully did he forgive them / because he would
not destroy them / and full often revoked he his wrath because he would not al
kindle it.

For he considered that they were but flesh / and wind that gothe away
never to return.

How often did they exasperate him in the deserte / and provoked him to anger in
the wilderness?

Oh / how did these bakslyders te^pte god / and mocked ye holy God of Israel?

Forgetinge his power / and also the day wherein he had delivered the^ from
thoppressour:

How he had wroght his miracles agenst the gipcions / and his woundres in the
field of Tanys:

How he changed their ryuers into blood / and also their waters that they could
not drink.

How he sent them lyse to ete them up / and frogs to destroy them He
destroyed their corn and grass with hot worms / and wasted their labor
with locustis.

He beit down their vynes with hayle stones / and did froste bight they
moreburyes.

He destroid their catel with hayle storms / and smyt down their flockis with
hot thondre boltis

For in the hot furye off his fyerce indignacion he sent into emonge them great
tribulacions and incursions of euel sprites.

He laid open ye way of his wrath to invade both those men their selves and
their beastis to.

For he smote every first begoten off Egypt: even all the chief labors / in
the tabernacles off Ham.

But his people he led them forth like a flock of sheep / and drove them into
the deserte like a drove of neat.

He led them so suerly that they neded nothing to have feared: for their
enimes he overwhelmed with the sea.

And brought them into the coostes of his holy place / even unto that hill
which he got them with his righthande

He expelled the ge^tils before their faces / and divided them that heretage
metforth with lines / set^li^g ye tribis of Israel even in the tabernacles of
their enymes.

But they did tempt and anger the most high god / and observed not his
covenant.

They fill bak from him like their fathers / they rebelled like a naughty bow.

They angered him with their images erected on high: and provoked him to wrath
with their Idols.

Which once herd / god was sore amoued / and gretely detested and abhorred
Israel.

And then he forsook the tabernacle which was first in Silo: even his
habitacion where he dwelt among men.

And betoke their strength into captivity: and their gloriouse beutye he
delyuerd into the handis of their enymes.

He casted his people agenst ye sword / he was so sore angrye with his
heretage.

Fire deuowred his young men / and none mourned the state off his maidens.

His priests were smytendowne with sword / and there were no widewes to
lament them.

And the lord start up as one waken from sleep / even like a soldyere
refresshed and animated with wine.

And beit their enymes on the nether aftir partis / and made them a perpetual
ignomye.

He turned himself away from the tentis of Joseph / and repudiated ye tribe
of Ephraim.

But he chose ye tribe of Judah / and also the hill of zion who^ he loves. There
he builded (as rychely and honorably as might be) his holy temple: and laid ye
foundation as fast as the earth it self long to endewer.

He chose also his servant David / and took him up from ye shepcote He led him
away from ye folowinge his flok great with young / to feed Jacob his people and
Israel his own heretage.

He fed them therefore puerly after thinnocency of his own heart / and
according to his high prudent virtue he led them forth.

The song of Asaph.
The Argument.
A complainte of the godly / upon the destruction of Jerusalem and miserable
captivity thereof.

OH god / the gentiles have invaded thy heretage / they have polluted thy holy
temple / and brought Jerusalem into an heap of stones. They have made the
carkases of thy servants meat for ye fowls of ye air / and ye flesh of thy

We are an obprobrye unto our neighbors: a laughinge stok derided of them

utterly kindle thy wrath to burn us thus up for ever? Powerforth thy wrath
upon these haithe^ ge^tils yt have not known ye / and upon ye kyngdoms which
call not upon thy name.

Which have deuowred Jacob / and cut away his habitacion.

Remember not our sins of old committed: but let thy mercyes suddenly
preuente us: for we be made very pore.

Help us / oh god our savior for thy gloriouse name / and deliver us: be
peased and pardon our sins for thy names sake.

Wherefore should ye gentiles say / where is their god? let ye blood shed of thy
seruantis be avenged upon the gentyls / in our sight.

Let the sorrowful sighs off them that ly bound in presone enter into thy
presence / and for thy mighty power save them that be iuged to dye.

These men which have us now in their daungere / have reuyled ye excedingly /
but Lord / turn this contumeliouse reuylinge into their own bosoms.

And let us thy people and ye flok of thy pasture give ye thankis for ever / and
preche thy praise unto every age to come.

OH pastor and ruler off Israel atte^de unto us which ledist Joseph like a

Show thy self before Ephraim / Benjamin and Manasse: stere up thy strength
and come and save us. Turn the unto us (Oh God): show us thy face and we

Oh lord god of powers / how long will thou repel the prayer off thy people?

Instead of bodily food / thou feddest us with teres / thou madeste us
drink plentuously our own teres.

Thou made us a chydyng stok unto our neighbors / and our enymes emonge

Turn the unto us (oh god) of powers / show us thy face and we shall be salfe.

Thou calledst to the a vyneyarde out of Egypt / which (the gentiles cast out)
thou did plant it.

And her rootis purged / thou preparedst her a fat and fast place: so that her
branches spread over the hole region.

Even the hills were kouered with her shadewe / for his bows were like the
strong Cedre trees.

She stretched forth her branches unto the sea: and her bows unto the flowde.

And wherefore then brokeste thou up her hedges / that all that passed there
forebye might snatche of her grapes?

A wild bore came in and destroyed her / and the wild beastis of the field
feed upon her.

Oh god of powers turn ye unto us we beseech ye / lokeforth from heaven
behold / and consydre this vyneyarde:

Even that plant which with thy nowne righthande has been planted / that is
to weit / even thy son whom thou have thus manified for thy nowne glory.

For it is now brent up with fire / and lies al to wroted up.

Let them therefore perish at thy mighty rebuke / which have done this deed.

And let thy power be present with ye man of thy righthande / even with ye sone

And we shall not go back from the / restore us that we might call upon thy
name.

Oh my people / hear: for I shall douteles promise ye (oh Israel:

That if thou will obaye me / thou shall have no strange god / nor fall down

For it is I that am the Lord thy god which have led the out of ye land of
Egypt: open thy mouth and I shall fill it.

But my people received not my voice / and even Israel forsook me.

Wherefore I forsook them and left them unto the shrewdnes of their own heart:
and then they followed their own devices.

Oh yt my people would hear me / I would that Israel had walked in my ways.

For then should I have myneshed their enymes and turned my hand agenst their
adversaries.

They had frustrated ye haters off ye lord in Israel / and had had there a

And he should have fed them with the flower of wheat / and satisfied them with
honey / even out of the very rock.

The Argument.
This Psalm / is an inuocacion and co^solacion of the mercy of god promised
unto the faithful / by the covenant smyten with our fathers Abraham and David /
never to be broken with the godly.

THe mercyes of the lord shall I evermore sing and praise: unto all the
posterite to come / I shall declare his trowthe with my mouth.

For I know that thy goodness shall endure for ever: and thy faith and troth
was present even with the heuens when they were made.

Whereby thou thus saydst: I have smyten up a covenant with my chosen: and
sworn unto Dauyd my servant.

I shall set fast thy sead for ever: and stablyshe thy seat royal unto al

Selah

Even the heuens do magnify thy clear acts oh lord: and ye congregation of
ye faithful preche thy faith and troth.

For who is there even in ye clouds yt may be compared unto the lord? or
emonge ye gods like unto the lord?

God is to be dreaded in ye great company of ye faithful / and gretely to be
reverenced above al yt are about him.

Oh lord God of powers who is like unto ye / in majesty / faith and troth?
where with thou art assisted on each side.

Thou co^mandest the proud sea thou presseste down her waves when they begin
to rise.

Thou brekest and woundeste the proud: and with thy power scaterest thine
enymes.

The heuens ar thine / the earth is thine / the world rownd about and
whatsoever is in it / al ar thine: for thou have first made them.

The north and south thou have made them: thabor and Hermon glory of thy name.

Thy arm is exceeding strong / thy hand is most mighty: and thy righthande
is most highest of all. With justice and equite thy seat royal is gloriously
stablesshed / mercy and trowthe are thy before goers.

Oh how blessed is that people which can blow up thy praise o lord: which
walk in the light off thy presence.

Which at all times rejoice in thy name: and leap and spring at the manner
off thy rightwysmakinge.

For thou art ye brightness of their strength: and through thy favor our power
is listed up.

Thou lord art our shilde / oh holy maker of Israel our king.

Thou spakest some time prechinge to thy faithful / saying: I shall give
strength unto my mighty one / and exalte my chosen man over the people.

I shall get David to be my servant and with my holy ointment anoynte him.

My hand shall stay him / and mine arm shall strengthen him.

His enemy shall not overcome hi^: nether ye myscheuous shall not oppress him.

I shall smite down his enymes before him: and destroy them that hate him.

My troth and mercy shall never fail him: and through my power his power
shall be exalted.

I shall stretcheforthe his majesty emperial unto the weste sea / and his
kingdom unto ye floude Euphrates.

He shall call me / saying: oh my father: my god / and the rock off my sauinge
health.

For I shall make him thouerm ost and higheste of the kings of the earth.

I shall keep my mercy for him ever: and my covenant shall stand fast with him.

For his sead shall I continue for ever / and his seat royal shall be as ferme as
the day that springethe out of the sky.

But and if his childern forsake my law: and walk not in my just plesures.

If they defyle my ceremones: and keep not my commandments:

Then with a rod shall I viset their transgressions / and look upon their sins
with beatinges.

But yet my mercy shall I not take from him / nor never break promise to
deceive him.

My covenant shall not be frustrate: but what so ever went forth of my mouth / I
will not change it.

In the sacrament of mine of the I swore by my holiness: If I deceive David. *
Never trust me

His sead shall stand for ever / and his seat royal shall endure in my presence

But now se / thou contempnest and castest him away / thou makeste thy

Thou turneste bake thy promise with thy servant / thou prophanest his
gloriouse crown casten down upon ye earth.

Thou haste cloven down al his wall is: and broken down all his strong
defenses.

They trede him under their fete all that there go forbye / he is an obprobrye

The right hand off his enemy thou lyftest up / and all his adversaries
thou makeste to rejoice.

The power off his sword thou have writhen it back: thou geuest him no

Thou have obscured his glory / and smiten his seat royal casten agenste the

Thou have cut of the days of his yougth: and covered his face with shame. So

How long lord will thou be hid? will thou be hid for ever? how long shall

Remember how short is my time: have thou made al me^ mortal in vain?

May any man so live that he never dye? or may he deliver himself from the

Where is that thy so aunciant mercy / oh lord: which by so holy an oath thou
promysedst to David by thy truth?

Wherewith thy enymes lord rebuke and deteste the stepis off thy anointed.

Thankis be unto the Lord for ever: Amen / amen.

The prayer of Moses the man of god.
The Argument.
A praise and magnifyinge of god / and a deiection of man / and recourse unto
god.

Lord thou art our refugye / to receive us at all time.

Before the mountayns or the earth were brought forth: before the round
world was made: from ever unto everlasting thou art god.

Thou bring man into duste / and again / thou say return into your
perfyt state ye childerne off Adam.

For a thousand years ar before ye / even as yisterdaye past: and like the
watches of the night.

Whiles thou scaterest them / they be but a dream / suddenly they are changed
like grass.

The grass flouressheth and grows in the morninge / but at the eueninge it
is cut down and withered.

Even so / thou being wrath / we be consumed / and in thy anger we are troubled.

Thou hold our sins before ye our secret deadis are open in thy clear
presence.

Thou being anger / al our days are slyden away: our years ar gone in a
thought.

The days of our yearis yt we live are almost seuentye year / and they yt be
more lustye / live four score: of which even ye best be sawced with labor
and sorrow: and even suddenly are we fallen and flone away.

Who regards thy mighty wrath: and also the furye off thy indignacyon?

Teache us thus to compte our days / and to consydere them wisely.

Turn the Lord now at last: and be thou merciful unto thy servants.

Let us be sone satisfied with thy mercy that we might rejoice and be glad
all the days of our life

Let us have gladness for the days of our affliccion / even for those yeris
whereyn we suffered tribulation.

Deuyde thy clear actis emonge thy servants: and thy noble magnificence unto
their childerne

And the gloriouse majesty of our lord god be with us / he might acomplisshe

The Argument.
This Psalm declares / the faithful to be fre from al fear

Whosoever dwell in the preuey closet of the most highest: and abides under the
shadewe off him that is almyghtye:

He says unto the Lord / my God is my adsuered hope / and unto him do I cleue.

For it is he that will deliver the from the honters snare / and from their
pestelent myscheif.

He will kouer the with his wings to be suer under his feathers / his faith and
truth shall be thy shilde and bukler.

So that nether by night thou shall not be afraid of night bugges / nor yet by
day fear their fleing arows.

No not once to fear their poyso^ that krepeth and encreseth in derkenes / nor
yet that noyouse devil yt destroith at none days.

A thousand shall be smyten down at thy liftsyde / and ten thousand at thy
rightside / so yt no hurt shall come nighe the.

But ye punishment of ye ungodly thou shall se it / and behold it eue^ with
thy nowne eyes.

For thou lord / art my adsuered hope: in an high place have thou set thy
habitacion to be our refugie.

There shall no hurt lightely come at ye / there comes no plage unto thy
dwellinge place.

For / for thy pleasure he shall co^ma^de his angels to keep the in all thy
ways.

To bear the in their handis / yt thou hurtest not thy fete at ye stones Thou
shall go upon cruel beastis and venomes serpents: and trede down lions and
dragons.

Because he trusted in me I will deliver him / says ye lord: I shall defend
him because he knowlegeth my name.

When he shall call upon me / I will hear him / in his distress I will be bye
him: I shall deliver and magnify him.

I shall satisfy hi^ with long life: and at last show him the salvation yt
comes fro me.

A thanful song for the Sabat day.
A general praise of all the people together and a knowleginge of the faith.

IT is a goodly thing / with praise to magnify the lord and to sing unto
thy name oh most highest.

To preche thy mercy in the morninge and thy trowthe at the evening.

And that upon the ten stringed instrument upon the lute / singinge also upon
the harp.

For thou Lord / makeste me glad with thy workis / and for the dedis of thy
handis I rejoice.

Oh Lord how clear ar thy dedis? thy counsels are deep and unsearchable.

An vn^y^^ man perceyueth not / nor the (...) understands not this thing.

Tha^ (...) ^^scheuos growvp like (...) ungodly synful shall flouresshe unto
this end / ^ they might be cut away for ever.

But thou lord / abydest fast for ever even the most highest.

For / lo / lord / thy enymes / thy enymes (I say) perisshe and al these
ungodly men are scatered.

But my power shall redascende like ye horn of the unicorn / and mine old age
shall be moist and flouresshe.

For that mine eye shall se / and mine ear perceive the myscheif hapened unto
my enymes / which arose agenst me.

The just shall floureshe like the palm tree / and sprede his branches like the
Cedres of ^ibanus.

For they planted in ye house of ye Lord / shall flouresshe in the court of
our god.

yea / in their old age shall they flouresshe and budde / made lustye and full
of sap.

That al men might know / how just and trwe is the lord my rock / and no
wrong to be in him.

andThe Argument.
What perel / be it never so great / stands upon / yet shall faith avoid it
in god.

OH lord king / which art clearly endewed / oh lord which art clothed and
girte with strength thou have so fast set ye round world that it can not be
moved Even now from the beginning has thy seat royal be constituted from
everlasting thou haste thy being.

Behold lord the floudis extol them self: the floudis extol their noise /
the floudis lyftvppe their streams.

But yet myghtyer is the lord that dwells on high: then the sown of the
maigne sea and streams of water / be they never so vehement.

What thingis so ever thou haste testified and promised upon thy fayer holy
house: they shall abide trwe and fast (lord) perpetually.

The Argument.
An inuocacion of the judgment of god agenst the ungodly / and consolacion of
the good for the favor of god.

OH Lord god the very auenger / oh god avenge openly and be glorified.

Be thou exalted oh judge of world: requyte ye proud as they be worthy.

How long Lord / how long do the ungodly triumph?

How praare they their own fables? how long shall al these wicked persons
dispute of vain things?

How long shall they grynde thy people together / and vex thy heretage?

The pore destitute and ye strangers they sleye: and torment ye fatherless.

Saying / ye lord knows not off it / and ye God of Jacob perceyuethe
nothing of this.

Take heed therefore ye unwise emonge ye people / and ye foles be once wise.

Shall not he hear that did few on ye earee? shall he not se ye / yt made the
eyes?

Shall not he that nourterethe the gentiles correcke the^? shall not he chastise
/ that techeth men knowledge?

Unto ye lord verily are mennis devices well known / he knows the^ for vain
and naught.

Oh how happy is that man whom thou techest oh lord: and whom thou
enstructest in thy law? That he might be suer in time of perell: while in ye
mean time the pit is dug for the ungodly. For the lord shall not repel
his people / nether forsake his heretage But he shall restore judgment unto the
rule off ryghtwysnes: and him shall there follow all that are pure in heart.

Who may help against these malign men? or who may stand by me agenst these
wyked?

Except the lord had been my helper / I had ere now been in my grave.

For when I thought yt my fete was slyden: yet was it thy mercy lord that
sustained me.

In my many fold inward sorrowful vexacions: thy consolations yet refresshed my
soul.

Have thou any thing to do with the seat of the ungodly / which under the
cloak of the law forgeth al myscheife and pain?

They run together agenst ye life of the just / and condemn innocent blood.

But the lord shall be my refugye: and my god shall be my strong ferme confidence.

And he shall requite them their own malice / and destroy them for their own
wikednes / ye lord our god shall utterly destroy them.

The Argument of the Psalm. 95
Which is an excytinge and steringe up of the faithful to praise god faithfully.

COme and let us leap for joy before the lord / let us sing unto the rock
of our sauinge health.

Let us come before him with tha^kis geuinge / and in the Psalms singe unto him.

For he is the lord / both god and king / most mighty above al goddis. In his
handis ar the deep secretis of the earth / and also the strength of the
mountains.

The sea is his / for he has made it / all the dry land ioyninge thereto /
his handis have facioned it

Come and let us faldowne before him / let us bow down our knees and beseech
the Lord our maker.

For he is our god / and we be the people of his pasture / and the flok off his
hand / so long as we cease not to obaye his voice.

Be not hard herted as were they that chode and rebelled agenste him in the
wilderness.

Where your fathers casted me of / they proved me and saw my workis.

Fourtye years it yrked me of that nation / in so myche that I said: this
peples heart is gone fro me / for they knowledge not my ways. In my great wrath
therefore made I my oath agenst them / yt they should not come into my rest.

The Argument of this Psalm.
Wherein al things / and even the gentiles be excited to loaue god which is to
come unto judgment.

SInge ye to ye lord a new song / singe ye unto the lord all the hole land

Sing ye to the Lord / and loaue his name / prechinge his sauinge health at
al time.

Put the gentiles in mind off his glory / and al people of his miracles.

For great is the Lord and excedeth al praise / he is to be dreaded above al
gods.

For all the gods of the gentiles are but stocks / it is the lord yt made the
heuens.

Thankis and high magnifice^ce is with him: power and majesty are in his holy
place.

Give unto the lord ye kinreds of the gentiles / give the lord his power and
strength.

Give ye power almightye unto the name of the lord / takevp your offeraunce
and come into his holy court.

Praise ye the lord with holy po^pe / all the earth might reverence his face.

Publesshe it emonge the gentiles / yt the lord reigns / even the lord which
has setfaste the world yt it cannot be moved / even the lord (I say) yt
iugeth al folk justly.

The heuens might rejoice and the earth be ioyouse / the sea might sown and
be moved with all yt is in her.

The feldis might be glad with whatsoever is in them / all the strength of the
wodis might leap for joy:

Before the lord / when he shall come: for he shall come to judge the earth / he
shall come to judge the rownde world with rightwisnes / and the people with
truth.

It is the very almighty god / which is worshipped in Israel / and all other to
be no goddis / and the worshipers of god to magnify the very form os our
rightwismakinge.
Dominus regna. exul.

Psalm. 97.
THe lord reigns / the earth might rejoice / and those manifold eylandis
might be glad.

He is closed about with derke clouds rightwisnes and equite ar the pylers of
his seat royal

Fire proceeds before him / to burn up his enymes rownde about him.

His lighteninges show us clearly the world rownde about / at ye which the
earth trembles and quakethe.

The hills melt away like wax at the presence of the lord / ye all the earth
sinketh away at the presence of the lord.

The heuens preche forth his rightwisnes: and al people shall se his majesty.

Confounded moughr they be / all that worship images and glory in their goddis
/ and let all the goddis worship him.

zion shall rejoice when she hear these things: and the daughters of Judah shall
dance for joy when they se thy iugementes / oh lord. For thou lord art the
most highest over all the earth / thou art excedingly exalted above al gods.

Whosoever love the lord / se that ye hate malice: for he keeps the soulis of
his servants / and delyuereth them from the hand of the ungodly.

Through hi^ / light is powered into the innocent: and joy is set fast in ye
pure herted.

Be glad ye rightwyse in the Lord and be thankful in his holy rememberance.

:An excitinge of al things to praise god / for favor given through crist /
the judge of the world to come / like unto the psalm. xcvi
SInge ve unto the lord a new song: for he has done marvelous thingis with
his sauinge right hand and holy arm.

The lord has made known his sauinge health / and reveled his form of
rightwyse making in the eyes of the gentiles.

He remembered his mercy and troth for ye house of Israel: yt all the coostis of
the earth might se ye salvation sent us from our god.

Let all the earth make melody unto ye lord: be glad / rejoice and singe. Singe
ye unto ye lord with harp play ye psalms upon your harpes Sing with
trompets and claryers: make ye melody before the lord and king.

Let the sea and al yt is in her sownd forth her melodye / al ye world with
her inhabitors.

The ryuers might clappe their handis / and the mountayns leap for joy:

Before ye lord / when he shall come to judge the earth / for he shall judge ye
world / taking justice to counsel / and ye people / calling equite to assiste
him.

The Argument.
God is here preased for his goodness / in that he ever hears his people.

Dominus regna. iras.

Psalm. 99
THe lord reigns and makes the people to tremble / he sits upon the
Cherubims and moves the earth.

The lord which is worshipped in zion is great: and high above all people.

Let them extol thy great name / so terrible and so holy.

Thy power royal loves equite / thou hold mercy in thy hand / and that at
just and right is / thou doist it unto Jacob.

Extol ye the lord our god / and fall down before his fotestole / for he is
holy.

Moses and Aro^ were ordined his preistes / and Samuel off the noumber of them
that call upon his name / called unto the Lord / and he answerde them.

Out of the clowdy pyler he spoke unto them: for they kept ye testimonies and
law which he had given them.

Lord our God / it was thou that herdest them / thou waste unto them / both
their mercyful god and also the auenger of their vain deuyses.

Magnify ye the lord our god / and worship him in his holy hill: for right
holy is the lord our god.

A Psalm of thankis geuinge in the hole congregation.
MAke ye mirthe unto the Lord through out all the land / worshipe the lord
in gladness / come into his presens joyfully.

Acknowledge ye that the lord is god: he made us / and not we our self which are his people and ye sheep of his pasture.

Go ye into his gates with thankis geuinge / and into his vtwarde court with
praise / loaue and preche his name.

For the lord is benign / his mercy is everlasting / and his troth endures
unto al generacions.

Here are princes and rulers taught how they should live their selves: and
entreat other.
MErcy and equite shall I praise in my song / unto the (oh lord) shall I singe.

I shall endeavor to attain ye pure way until thou metest me / I shall walk in
the innocencye off my heart within my nowne house I shall not set before me any
shrewd counsel: the ungodly dishonest I so hate them / yt they shall not in
nowyse cleue unto me.

Wyked minded I abhor / him yt forgeth myscheif in nowyse will I know.

Him that secretly detracteth his neighbor I will oppress / the proud and
arrogant I may not away with.

My eyes shall be intent in this world unto ye very faithful to dwell with me:
and who so walk in ye way of innocencye / he shall be my servant.

No deceitful person shall dwell in my house / no liar shall tarry in my sight.

Al wiked persons will I cast forth in time out off the land / so that al
workers of myscheif shall be cut out of the cite of the lord.

A prayer of the pore afflicte being in distress / poweringe forth his
complaint before the lord.
Lord hear my prayer and let my crying come unto the.

Hyde not thy face from in time of my tribulacion / but lysten unto me when I
call / and haste the to help me.

For my days vanishe away like smoke / and my bones are consumed like a fire
brande.

My heart is cut down and dried up like hay / for I forsook to take my nowne
meat.

For the noise of my sorrowful wailinge my bones skant cleue unto my flesh.

I am like ye pellycane in ye wyldernes / and like ye night foul in ye old
broken celinges.

I wake and am like ye little sparowe which sits solytary with out his mate
in ye rofe of ye house. My enymes reuyle me continually: and they that ieste
upon me conspire my death.

So that I eat my bread like ashes and mengle my drink with tears.

And that even for thy indignacion and wrath / for thou tokest me up to cast
me agenste the grownde.

My days are like the eueninge cloud: for I am witherd away like hay.

But thou lord endurest for ever and thy mention is through out all ages.

Arise thou therefore and have compassion on zion / for time it is to pitye it:
her appointed time is now come.

For thy seruantis dyed for ye love of the stones thereof / and it berued them
to se her broken into poulder. Have pity lord yt the gentiles might fere thy
name / and all the kings of the world might reverence thy majesty.

Even when they shall se the (oh lord) preserve zion / and appear in thy
gloriouse power.

When thou lystenest unto the prayer of the pore destitute / and contempnest
not his desyeres.

For this thing shall be left written unto our posterite / yt the people to come
might praise the lord.

Because he has looked forth from his high holy place / even from heaven into
the earth.

To hear the sorrowful wailinge of the bound in presone / to loose them
appointed unto death.

That in zion the name of the lord might be preched / and his glory in
Jerusalem.

In the most full congregation / eue^ when the kingdoms shall be there gathered
together to worship the lord. Although in yt same viage he minesshed my
strength / and shortened my days.

Even while I thus prayed / oh my god take me not away in the midde course of
my age / for thy yeris are everlasting.

Thou laydst the foundacio^ of the earth from ye beginning: and the heuens are
the work of thy handis.

They shall perish / but thou shall stond fast: and all things shall be
consumed in time / like a vesture: thou shall change them like a garment / and
they shall be changed.

But thou shall abide ever one and the same / and thy years shall never have
end.

The childerne of thy servants and their sead / shall abide and dwell together
with the.

A praise with thankis for the benefits os our creacion / preseruacion / and
iustrification
Praise ye lord my soul: and all the secret powers of my heart moughte praise
his holy name.

My soul / thank thou the lord / and forget not so many his great benefits.

Which forgeueth ye al thy trespases / and heals al thy infirmytes Which
redemeth thy life from death / and crowns ye with his benign mercy and
ientlenes.

Which satisfies thy desire with al manner goodness / and preserves thy youghth
evermore flouresshinge like the egle.

In ministringe his justice and equite / ye lord auengeth al ye suffer wrong.

Unto Moses he showed his ways / and his counsels unto ye chyldern of Israel.

Right mylde and merciful is the lord: slow unto wrath / but ready to
forgeuenes.

He chydeth not ever / another is he angry always.

He deals not with us after our sins: nor rewards us not acordinge to
our wikednes.

The heyghth of the heuens is not so present over the earth / as is his
merciable goodness over them that worship him.

He sets out sins as far from us / as is the east from the west

Never was there any parente so tender unto his childerne / as is ye lord unto
them that worship hi^. For it is he that knows our making / he remembers yt
we are but of dust.

That ye age of man mortal is like grass: yt he flouressheth like a flower of
the field.

Which as soon as any sharp wind touch it: it is gone / no more found in his
place.

But the merciable goodness of the lord / is from ever and ever preseruinge his
worshipers / and the form of his rightwismakinge is prsent with their childers
childern. Solonge as they keep his covenant / and hold his commaundments in
mind to do them.

The lord has set fast his seat royal in heaven: and with his majesty
emperial he governs al things.

Praise ye the Lord his angels / which excel in power to fulfill his
plesures / and to obaye the voice of his word.

Praise ye the lord al his mighty host / his ministers / and ye yt do his
plesures.

Praise ye the lord / al his workis in every place of his dominion.

Praise thou the lord my soul.

In this Psalm the providence of god agenst al creatures / is praised.
Praise ye lord my soul: oh lord my god / it cannot be expressed with how
great might / majesty and glory thou art ornowerned.

Thou art decked with light as with thy garment / thou stretchest forth ye
heuens like a cortayne.

Thy dwellinge place is volted over fast with waters / ye clouds thou framest
into thy chariets / carried with ye swyft wings of the wind.

Thou make ye wyndes thy messengers / and ye flames of fire to be thy
ministres.

Thou have laid ye earth upon her own fast foundation / s^ yt she shall never
fall / nor rele.

Thou have wrapped her in with ye sea as it were with her vesture.

And even when over ye mountai^s ye waters ascend: yet at thy rebukinge they
flee: at ye noise of thy thondringe they faldowne.

Then ye hills are seen a lofte / and ye vales beneth in their place which
thou have appointed them

Thou have limited ye waters their bowndes which they may not pass / nether
yet turn again to over flow ye earth.

Thou ledest forth ye springes in yt vales / which go through between ye
hills.

To give drink unto al thy beasts of ye field / yt ye wild asses might break
their thirste.

Above in the hills the fowls off the air have their habitacions: and singe
out of the thik branches.

Thou waterest the hills from thy high places / through thy dilligent work
the earth is replenisshed with yearly increase.

Thou bring forth grass for catel / and herbs to serve man

Out of the earth thou bring forth both fode to sustain and refresshe man:
wine to make glad ma^nis heart / and oil to make him a merry chere.

The trees are made fat off thy lordeship / and also the Cedres off Libanus
which thou have planted That the fowls might there nestle / as is the furtre
an house for the storke.

That the high hills might be soucour for the hartis / and the rocks a
refuge for the kones.

Thou have made ye moan to wexe and wanse / the sun knows his down fallinge.

Than bring thou in derkenes to make the night / in yt which all ye beastis
of ye forestis crepeforth. As ye yo^ge lyo^s roringe for their proye / to seek
their meat appointed them of god.

But the sun arysinge / they conuaye them self in again / and leye them down
in their dens.

And then comes forth man unto his work / and to till his land until eueninge.

Oh how great ar thy workis o lord? which al so wisely thou have made / right
full is ye earth of thy goods.

The sea also is great and wide every ways / wheryn are things crepinge
innumerable / as fisshes and beasts / some small and some exceeding great.

Whereupon sail the ships / and there is the great whalefisshe whom thou
have made to mock and play therein.

Al these creatures depend upon ye / yt thou shuldst give them their meat at
their time.

For / thou geuinge it them / they take it: and thou openinge thy hand / they
are well satisfied.

But thou / hydinge thy face / they are sorrowful: and thou taking away their
breath / they are but dead and turned into the earth yt they came of.

And again / when thou put forth thy brethe / anon there are things
created agene: and thus thou renewest the face of the earth.

The gloriouse majesty of the lord might reign for ever / the lord might
rejoice in his workis. At whose look the earth trembles at whose touching the
hills smoke.

I shall singe unto ye lord while I live / while I have my being I shall singe
unto my god.

My prayer be plesaunt before hi^: for I rejoice in the lord.

Sinners might be consumed out of the earth / and the ungodly neuermore to be
seen: but thou / oh my soul / praise thou the lord.

Halleluia.
In this psalm / we be taught the providence of god / and how fatherly he
tendreth the faithful.
Thank ye the lord / magnify his name: and preche his woundrefull counsels
to the people.

Sing and make melody unto hi^ common together upon his clear actis.

Praise his holy name / the hertis of the sekers of the lord might rejoice.

Seek ye the lord incessauntly / seek his presence and cease not.

Remember his great deadis and miracles which he has done / and also his
iugements which he pronounced with his mouth.

Oh ye sead of Abraham his servants: oh children of Jacob his chose^ It is he
yt is ye lord our god / whose ensamples are known through all the world.

He never forgeteth his covenant and promise / which he has shewde unto
infinite generacions:

Even the same covenant which he smote with Abraham / and his holy oath made
unto Isaac:

Which he decreed for a law with Jacob: and confirmed it with Israel into a
perpetual testament. Saying: unto the shall I give the land of Canaan / to be
the lot off thy heretage.

When they were yet but few in noumber / and strang^rs therein.

Going from nation to nacio^ / from one kingdom to another people.

yet suffered he noman to hurt them / but chastened even kings for their
pleasure.

Saying: touch not my anointed and unto my prophets / se that ye do no harm.

After this when he had called a famyn upon yt land / and broken al their
sustinance.

Then sent he before them a man / even Joseph / which was sold to be a bond
servant.

Whose fete were sore bownde with feters / a bar of yerne went over his
breast.

But by ye counsel of ye lord was he thus proved / until the time yt he had
set / should come.

And then sent ye king commandinge him to be losed: ye prince off ye people
commanded him to be delivered.

And made him ruler of his house and lord over al his goodis.

That he should enstructe his nobles at his pleasure / and teache his sage rulers
prudence.

And at last came Israel also into Egypt / and Jacob became a stranger in ye
land of Ham.

And ye Lord increased his people there so gretely / yt they were at last
stronger then their adversaries

And then thegipcions hertes changed / they persecuted his people / and sought
occasions deceitfully to trappe his servants.

Wherefore he sent Moses his servant / and Aaron his chosen.

And gave them power to show wondres / and to do miracles in ye land of Ham.

He casted derkenes upon them / and it was midnight over al / for it could not
avoid his commandment. He turned their waters into blood / and killed their
fisshe.

Their land crewiled full of froggis / yea and that even in the kings preuey
chambers.

He commanded it / and anon there came forth swarms off al manner flies /
gnattis / and lyse / were in all their coostis.

For showers of rain / he gave them hayle storms / and lighteninges into
their land.

Wherewith he smote their vynes and figtrees / and blasted their trees through
out al their coostis

At his word / there were present venomese hot flies / and caterpylers
innumerable.

And eit up all that grene was in their land / and deuowered al their fruit.

Also he smote every first begoten in their land / even their chief things of
al their labor.

And at last he led them forth with silver and gold / nether was there any
syke in all their tribs.

Egypt was glad of their going forth: for they begane to be afraid of them.

And here / ye lord stretched the^ forth a cloud to shadewe the^ / and
ministered fire to lighte^ the^ by night When they asked it / he sent the^ great
ple^tye of quails / and filled them with fode sent down out of ye air He
opened the rock / and there flowed forth waters and made them ryuers in the
dry deserte.

And al because he would not forgete ye sacrament of his holy promise made to
Abraham his servant. He led forth therefore his people with great gladness / and
his chosen with great joy.

And delyuerd them ye provinces of the gentyles / and whatsoever ye people had
gote^ with their labor they now posseded it.

To thentent they should observe his just plesures / and keep diligently his
law.

Halleluia.
This psalm is a thankis geuinge for the old benefits of god / and an
obtaininge of gods favor. Halleluia.
Give ye thankis unto ye lord / for he is evermore benign and merciful.

Who may worthily treat his noble actio / and preche his full praise?

Oh how blessed be they that observe equite / and do right at al time.

Remember us lord for thy graciouse goodness towerd thy people: and vysyte us
with thy sauinge health That thy elect might se thy goodness / yt thy folk
might be glad and thy nowne peculiare people might clap their handis for joy.

We have offended with our fathers / we be sinners and have done wykedly.

Our fathers yet in Egipte considered not thy meruelouse actis / they regarded
not thy great goodness but rebelled even at the red sea.

But yet the lord saved them for his names sake / to declare his almighty
power.

For anon as he rebuked ye red sea it was dried up / and he led them over
through the depeth as through the dry land.

He delivered them from the hand of their haters / and preserved the^ from the
power of their enymes. The waters overwhelmed their adversaries: so that not
one of them remained.

And then they believed his wordis / and sunge him yt gloriouse song But full
sone after forgote they his workis / nether would they abide his pleasure.

And they offended him with their impacient desiers in the deserte / they
provoked god unto anger in the wilderness.

And yet he gave them their desire and did put away their penurye of which it
yrked them so sore.

Then they angered Moses in their tentis / and enuyed Aron ye lordis holy man.

But the ground gaped and swalowd in Dathan / and closed over the church of
Abiram:

Fire first kindled and set upon their congregation / and many off ye ungodly
brent up.

They had also made them a calfe in horeb / and fildowne before the graven
image.

And they casted away their glory for ye image of a calfe eating hay
Forgetinge god their savior / which had done so great things in Egipte.

So great miracles in the lord of Ha^ / so dreadful thi^gis in ye red sea
Wherefore the lord had decreed to destroy the^ / had not Moses his elect man
steptforth in yt article into his presence to sustain and bear his furye /
lest he should have casten them away.

Over this yet despised they some time y^ desiderable land / in so miche that
they would not believe his wordis.

Then they murmured and swelled in their tabernacles / nether would they obey
the commandment of the lord.

Wherefore he lifted up his hand agenste them / to have smyten them down in ye
deserte.

To disperse their sead into among ye gentiles: and to scater them among ye
harthen.

Besydis this they married the^ selves unto Baal peor / and eite ye sacrifices
offered to dead stockis.

And thus they offended him witheir own inuencyons / wherefore the pestelence
fellyn upon them. Then was Pinhas the auenger anon present: and the pestelence
swaged.

Which thing was rekened him for a good deed / for evermore among his
posterite.

They yet exasperated him at the waters of strife / which thing made Moses to
be punyshed for their sakis.

For they so angered ye spirit of god that he spoke it plainly with his lyppes.

That they should not clean cast out the gentyles / whom the Lord had
promised them to pluck up.

Wherefore they were mengled with the gentiles / and learned the workis of them.

And they worshipped their images which brought the^ to their fall:

As to slay their own sons and daughters / and offere them up unto deuillis.

To shed the innocent blood of their own sons and daughters / whom they
offered unto the images of the Cananites / polluti^ge the earth with their blood.

And that they their selves should also be profaned and polluted with their
own workis / playnge the harlettis with their own devises and inuencions. A
greuouse fall from God their glory.


Then the lordis wrath was set on fire agenst his people / and he abhorred his
heretage.

He gave them up into the power of the gentiles / and they yt hated them were
their lordis.

Their enymes oppressed them / they were subiectis unto them

Often times he delivered them / and they as often rebelled with their own
devises / For their own sins therefore were they oppressed But yet when he
beheld their distress / and herd their complaints He remembered his covenant
with them / and for his great infinite mercy he pytied them.

And gave them favor with all that had taken them.

Save us lord our god / and gather us out of the gentiles / that we might loaue
thy holy name and preche thy glory.

Praised be the lord god of Israel from ever into everlasting / and al people
might say Amen

Halleluya.
Thankis for the benefits of the providence of god.
Give ye thankis unto the lord: for he is evermore mylde and mercyful.

Let them give thankis which are redeemed off the Lord / ye and that even from
the power off their enymes.

And has gathered them from the gentiles / from the este and weste / from the
north and south

When they wandered in the wilderness in a way not trodden / findinge no cite to
rest in.

So hongry and thirsty that their lives failed them:

They cried unto the lord in their distress / and he delivered the^ out of
their anxte.

And brought them into the right way / that they might come unto the cite
which they should inhabit.

Let them therefore praise the goodness of the lord / and his clear workis
showed unto the childerne of men.

For he satisfies the hongry soul / and the thirstye he fills right well.

For when they sat in derknes and shadew of death / being bownde and grieved
with yerne:

Because they had cast away the commandmentis of god / and provoked the mind
of the most highest.

When he had brought their hertis fullowe with labor / when they lay noman
to help the^ up. They cried unto the lord in their affliccion / and he
delivered them from their distress.

He led the^ forth of the derkenes of that deadly shadew / and broke of their
bondis.

Let them therefore praise the goodness of the Lord / and his clear actis done
unto the chylderne of men.

For it is he that brake the brason gates / and smote the bars of yerne in
sondre.

For when the unwise had gone a wrong way / and should be scourged for their
own wykednes.

And when their appetyte abhorred al naner meat / and they were now even at
dethes door.

They cried unto the Lord in their anxt / and he delivered the^ out of their
distress.

He sent his rightwyse one / and healed them / and delivered them from their
death.

Let the^ therefore praise the goodness of the Lord / and his woundrese deadis
done unto the chyldern of men.

And offer him up the sacrifyce of thankis / and preche his workis ioyously.

Who so clyme the seas with ship: and expede their busynes on the sea.

They know the workis of the Lord and his marvelous actis which he does in
the depthe.

For at his commandment the wyndye storms arise / and lift up her waves.

Now are they lyfted up unto heaven / anon are they down as deep as hell /
which perel vexes their minds sore.

They rele and stagger like dronken men / and are all at their wits end:

But when they cry unto the lord in their anxt / he delyuereth them from
their distress.

He ceasseth the tempest / and brings in the caulme after that he has swaged
the swellinge waves.

And then they rejoice for their quietness given them again / and efte sone he
brings them unto their desyered haven.

Let them therefore praise the goodness of the Lord / and extol his woundreful
workis done for the children of men.

Let them extol him ^n the congregation of the people / and praise hi^ in the
presence of the elders:

Which turns ryuers into dry land / and the veins of quyke springes into
thirstye sand.

He makes the fat and fruteful region al barayn / for the malice of the
dwellers theryn.

Which contrarywyse also turns the dry deserte into sweet waters: and the
dry stouburne clottes into lively fountains

And sets there the hongrye to bylde them cytes to dwell in:

To sow the feldis / and plant vyneyardes / which might yilde them their
yearly increase.

He nouressheth and encreseth them excedingly / and suffers no their catell
to minisshe.

But when he minissheth and makes them full poor and low / b^ violence /
affliccion and sorrow. When he casts the^ bond to the rulers for a proye /
when he ledeth them al about by vain and void placis where is no way.

yet at last he eases the pore from his heuye need / and gives him an
howsholde like a flock of hepe.

These things might the just behold / and be glad / and let every
maliciouse stop his mouth.

Who so ever thou be and art wise / mark thou well these thingis that the
benefits of god might be known.

A Prayer unto God agenste ungodly enemes / and for tranquillite and peace.
My mind is full bente (oh god) both to sing and play thy praise with all my
heart.

A wake thou my lute / and my harp to / that I might begin spedely a none.

And praise the among the people oh Lord / and loaue the among the gentyls.

Because thy goodness is higher then the heuens / and thy tr^uthe and
faithfulness is above the clouds.

Be thou exalted above heuens oh God / and above all the earth in thy majesty.

That thy dear beloved might be delyuerd: save with thy righthande and help.

God promised it by his own holiness (which thing the mean reason is my
felicite) saying that I should divide unto my self Siche^ / and the vale of
Suchoth should I meat out.

Galaad is mine / Manasse is mine / Ephraim is my chief strength and Judah is my
leder.

Moab is my special pot / unto Idumea shall I stretche forth my shoes / upon
Palestyne will I blow up trompets.

But who is it that ledeth me forth unto these defenced cytes? who directs me
unto Idumea?

Is it not thou (o god) which had repelled us and woldst not go forth with
our host?

And tokest away our help at our most need? full vain therefore is the
health and help which is hoped for / of men.

In god therefore shall we reken our present victory / for it is he that tredeth
down our adversaries.

In this psalm is contained the vengeance of god agenste the persuers of his
word / and thankis be given him for our delyuerance and their confusion.
OH god my glory / dissemble not.

For the mouth of the ungodly / and the mouth of the deceytful are openned
agenst me / and with a lyinge tongue they speak agenst me.

They circumuent me with tale^ forged of odiouse malice / and lay agenste me
with out a cause.

For my entire love / they were clean agenste me / and that eue^ while I prayed
for them

Thus they requyted me hurt for my good doing / and hatered for my love.

Set some cruel tyrant upon him to be his master / and set his enimye at his
right hand.

When he is presented in judgment let him be conde^pned / and let his own
defense make his crime more grievous.

Let his time be short / and another ready to take his office.

Let his chylderne be soucourlesse and his wife destitute al help.

Let his chylderne be runagates / beggars / seki^g their meat in their hard
exile.

Let the extorcioner lay hand upon al his goodis / and his enymye pluk away
his labors.

Let there be none to pytie him nor none to favor his fatherless.

Let death make an end of his ysswe / so that in the next generacio^ is name
be clean extincte.

But as for the great sins of his father / let them be by tale told before
the lord / and let not the sins of his mother be forgoten.

Let the^ be ever present before the lord / but as for ye memorial of siche
me^ / let it be plucked clean out of the earth.

Because he never remembered to do mercy / but persecuted the deiecte man /
redye to kill the pore sorrowful in heart.

He loved execrable cursinge / let it therefore fall upon him self: he never
sought favor / let it therefore be far from him.

He wrapped him self in execracion as in his clothinge / let it therefore pearse
through him like water / and synke into his bones like oil Let it cleue upon
him like his cloak wherewith he is kouered / and sit to his sydis like his
girdle where with he is ever girte

Let this work chance to mine enymes from the lord / and upon them that
perniciously conspire my death.

But thou lord God deal otherwise with me / for thy names sake for by thy
mercy art thou ready to deliver me.

For I am a pore afflicte abiecte! and my heart is wounded with in me.

I go forth like the eueninge shadewe / and am taken away like ye locustes.

My knees fold under me for fayntnes and sorrow / and my flesh is so dried
up / that there is no moystenes left in me.

I am made a reuylinge stok for them when they se me / they shake their headis
at me.

Help me lord my God and save me for thy mercyable goodness.

That they might know thissame to be thy hand / and that thou haste done it.

Let them curse blasphemously / so that thou beist benign and ie^tle unto me:
let them rise agenste me and be confounded / but thy servant shall be glad.

Let my adversaries be cled with ignomyny and shame / and be kouered with their
own confusion as with a cloak.

I shall as intyerlye as I can speak forth thanks unto the lord / and in the
myd multitude loaue him. For it is he that standethe at the righthande of the
pore afflicte: to deliver him from his condempners.

A prophecy of the birth of christ / and of his kingdom both here in his
church / and also in heaven.
THe lord seid unto my lord sit thou on my righthande / until I make thine
enymyes thy footstool.

The septre of thy power / the lord shall send it forth from zion / that thou
might be emperor in the mids of thine enimes.

In the day of thy triumph / thy people shall bring forth their well willing
oblacions with an holy pomp: for the dew of thy natiuite is spronge out of
the womb of the morninge.

The Lord has sworn / and it shall not repent him: Thou art the preiste for

The lord is present at thy right hand / which when he is angrye he smyteth
even the kings

He takes vengeance upon the ge^tyls / and fills all with their kario^s and
smytethe the head of the hole world.

In his journey shall he drink off the river / and then shall he lyftvp his head.

Praise ye the lord.
This Psalm is a praise and thankis geuinge.
I Shall praise the lord with all my heart / both priuatelye with his faithful /

Great are the workis of the lord and gretely desyered of all that embrase them.

His wurk is worthy laud and glory / and his rightwisnes endures for ever.

He has so done his woundrefull clear actis / that they be worthy to be
remembered: mylde and mercyful is the lord.

He gives meat to them that fear him / remembringe for ever his covenant.

The vertw and strength of his dedis he showed unto his people / when he gave
them the possessions of the gentyls.

The workis of his handis ar ferme and right / fast and trwe ar al his
precepts.

Confirmed into every age / as thingis decreed and set upon trwthe and equite.

Redemption has he sent unto his people / he has commanded his covenant to
stand for ever: holy and reverent is his name.

The head of wysdom is the fear of the Lord / oh right and hole mind which
moderath her wurkis aftir him / the praise of them shall endure for ever.

also way his wordis with judgment.

For he abides ever one unmoved: the memorial of the just endurethe ever.

At euel tydinges he fereth not / for ferme and fast is his heart by faith in
the lord.

So constant is his heart that he dreadeth not / until he se the fall off his
enymes.

He deuideth and gives unto the pore / his justice endures for ever his
victoriouse power shall be gloriously exalted.

Which thingis al / the ungodly beholdinge / he shall frete himself with inuye
/ grinne and whett his tethe / and be consumed: and the desire of the ungodly
shall be frustrate. Halleluia.

God is praised here for his allmightynes.
LOaue ye o servant of the Lord / loaue the name of the Lord.

Praised be the name of the Lord / from hence forth for evermore.

From the sone rising unto the down falling / loaued be the name of the Lord.

The Lord is excellent high above al nations / and his glory above the
heuens.

Who is to be compared unto the Lord our God? which has se^eled himself to
dwell so high / and yet so humbles himself agene / that he will behold what
so ever is in heaven and earth.

He lyfted up the nedye one out of the duste: and erectith the pore out of the
donghil.

To set him among the rulers / even emonge the Princes of his people.

He makes ye barayn / to be a glad mother of the householde / at home among
her childern. Praise ye the Lord.

A praise with thankis where in the hope of the faithful is confirmed
WHen Israel should come forth out of Egypt / and ye house of Jacob from that
strange people.

Thou wast (oh god) reverent holy unto Judah / and unto Israel their mighty
emperowr.

Which when the sea had espied / she did flee* and Iordane gave bak The
mountains skipt like rams / and the little hill tops like lombes.

What ailed ye (oh sea) to flee? and thou iordane whi wentest thoubak? What
made ye / you mountains to leap like wethers? and ye hills to play like
lombes?

At the presence of the lord thou tremblest oh earth / especially at the

and the stonney rock into a plentuouse spring.

Lord deliver my soul from lyinge lips / and from a desaytful tongue.

What have thou or what geuest thou / oh fraudulent tongue?

Verily even strong and sharp arows / and also hot burninge colles.

Ah less for that my banyshment is prolonged / I dwell in exyle among the

It irketh my soul to dwell among these haters of peace.

For while I thought upon and studied for peace / they bente themself to

nether roughteth not in his sleep / nor yet slomberth not.

For the lord is thy keeper / thy shadow / even he that ledethe the by thy

So that be day the sun burn the not / nor yet the moon be night

The lord keeps the from al evil he keeps even thy soul.

The Lord keeps thy outgoyng and thy incomynge / from now and ever.

Thankis geuinge for the prosperouse state of the church

trybs of the lord / the church of Israel to aknowlege praise unto the name
off the Lord.

For there is the seat of judgment even the seat royal of the house of David.

Pray ye for the peace of Jerusalem / happy be they that love her.

Al things might be false which thou possedest: plentuousnes be in thy houses.

For my brethren and kinsfolks sakis / I shall pray for thy health. For the
house off the Lord our God / I shall endeuower to do the good.

An expectation for the help of God.
Unto the / lift I up my eyes / oh inhabitour off the heuens.

For like as the servants eyes wait at the handis of their masters / and as
the eyes of maidens at the handis of their mistres / so depend our eyes upon
the Lord our God until he has mercy upon us.

Have mercy on us lord have mercy upon us / for we are filled with miche
contempt.

Our soul is over mich filled with the obprobriouse scorns of the proud /
and with the reuilings off the disdaynfull.

Thankis for thauoydinge of perel

Except the lord had stood of our side / when men rose agenst us: They had
now swalowed us up quyk: when their wrath was kindled agenst us / they had ere
now overwhelmed us like waters / like a swift strong streme they had taken us
away.

Even now had the waters of the proud persed unto our soul.

Thanked be the lord which has not cast us a proye into their tethe.

Our life is escaped like the little bryd out of the fowlers snare / for the
snare is broken and we be escaped.

Our help consists in the name of the lord / which has made heaven and earth.

The consolacion of the faithful of the rightwisnes of god.
THey that trust unto the lord are like the mount zion which moves not
from his place / but sits fast for ever As Jerusalem is closed rowndaboute
with mountayns / even so does the Lord close about his people now and ever.

Lest the tyrannouse power of the ungodly prease upon the lot of ye just / and
make the just to extend their handis unto sin

Be thou benign and ientle (o lord) unto good men / which are upright in heart.

But those men which are auerted unto their own malice / the lord ledeth
among the wyked. When Israel shall have peace and health

Thankis for deliverance out of anxte or captivity.
WHen the Lord returned the captivity of zio^: we were restored unto rest.

Then were our mouths filled with laughter / and our tongues with joy.

Then was it reported even emonge the gentiles / The lord has done marvelous
great actis for these men.

And in very deed the lord wrought marvelous great things with us / which
gretely deliteth us

Thou have turned (oh lord) our captivity / no another wise then as at the
southe wind the ryuers increase.

They that had sown with teres have reped with joy.

He that sometime went his way spedely / and wepinge took up his sead to cast
it forth / retourneth now merelye and iocounde bringinge home his hands full
off corn.

Al help and defense is of god.
Except the Lord sustain the house / they sweet in vain yt labor to hold
it up and ye cite also except the lord keep it / ^he watch men do but wake in
vain.

It is but vayn / after your rest to arise erly and eat your bread in swet and
sorrow: except he give sleep to his dear beloved.

Lo / these are their heretage / sons / well gotten goods / and the childerne
of the lord.

Oh blessed man that he is / which has filled his quiver with these arows: for
they shall not be ashamed to speak to their enymye eue^ in the open gates.

What goodness folowethe fearers of God.
OH blessed men all that worship ye lord / and walk in his For so shall thou
en (wais joy ye labors of thy nowns ha^dis / o how blessed and happy art thou
Thy wife is like a fruteful vine that cleueth unto thy house side / and thy
chyldern stand in order a boute thy table / as men ar wont orderly to set
their yo^ge olyue trees.

Behold thus is that man blessed / which worshipith the lord. Thus shall the
lord from zion enryche the / that thou might se Jerusalem to prospere al thy
life.

And that thou moughtst also se thy chylders chyldern / and peace in Israel.

Israelis ever troubled / and ever delivered.
OFten times have they faughten agenst me / eue^ fro my yougth: let Israel (I
pray you) tell it.

Often time have they faughten agenst me / even fro my yougthe / but yet did
they not overcome me.

They drove their ploughe upon my bak at their pleasure / and did cutforth their
vorows.

But the rightwyse Lord did cut in sondre their trayses / that al yt hate zion
/ should go home again whith shame and confusion.

They be made like sedge to thek howses / which is witherd ere ye syithe be
redye.

Of the which / nether the mower fill his hand / nor yet the gatherer his
bosom with the handefuls.

Where the goers fore by bid them not once god speed / sayng / the lord send
you increase / the name of the Lord be your fortherance.

A fervent prayer for the remission of sins.
OWte of the botomlesse pit of my heavy trouble I call unto the / oh Lord:
Lord hear my prayer.

Let thy ears be atttent unto the voice of my complaynt.

For if thou Lord / imputest mennis sons unto them / Lord who shall not
fall?

But thou art mercyful and easy to entreat: that we might reverence and fear
the.

The Lord is my hope unto who^ my soull cleaves / and I believe his word.

My soull is set upon the lord / from the one morning watch unto the the other

Let Israel trust unto the Lord / for with the Lord is there both infinite
mercy and plentuouse redemption.

For it is he that redemeth Israel from al their sins.

The faitheful studieth to be meek
Lord I exalt not my heart / nether extolle I my eyes I take not upon me great
and stout thingis to be woundred at. But I repress and refrain my mind as
the weaned child towerd his mother: I am a weanlinge in very deed.

But Israel trusts in the Lord from now and ever.

A deliberacion of thedifying of the temple.
Lord / remember David / with all his affliccions.

How he has sworn and vowed unto the Lord God of Jacob.

Saying / I will not enter into the tabernacle of my house / nether clyme up
into my bed:

I will not sleep with my eyes / nether yet once slomber with my eye liddis:

Until I prepare a place for ye lord / eue^ a tabernacle for the mighty God of
Jacob.

This place lo / we have herd in Ephrata / we have fownde it in ye busshy
field.

Let us therefore enter into his tabernacles / let us fall down before his footstool.

Arise Lord unto thy mansion / thou and the arc of thy strength.

Let thy preistis do on rightwisnes / and thy faithful rejoice.

For thy servant david's sake / differ not ye coming of thy anointed For the
Lord has made a faithful oath unto David himself / which he will not change
/ Of the sead of thy bellye shall I set one in thy seat royal.

If thy childern will keep my covenant and my ordinances which I shall teache
them / then shall the sons of them sit in thy seat roial from age to age.

For ye Lord has chosen zion / he has chosen her for his habitacio^ This
quiet place shall be my perpetual rest / here will I dwell / for she delyghteth me.

I will augment her yearly fruits and satisfye her pore me^ with fode enough.

I shall clothe her preistis with health / and her faithful shall rejoice
incessauntly.

There shall I first setforthe the flouresshing empire of David / and prepare
the lantern for my anointed.

His enimes shall I clothe with confusion: but upon him shall I set his
flouresshing corone.

An exhortacion unto charity.
Behold how honest and ioyouse a thing it is / brethern to dwell together
being of one mind.

It is like that preciouse oyntme^t powered upon the head and berde of Aaron /
running down unto the skirtes of his vesture.

It is like the dew of the hill of Hermon which descends into the hills of
zion.

For there has the Lord promised abundance / and long life to continewe.

An exhortation to watch and pray
Attend ye al / oh seruau^ts of the Lord which stand be night in the house
of the Lord / and praise the Lord.

Lift up your hands before that secret holy place / and loaue ye the Lord.

And the Lord shall enryche you from zion / which has made heaven and earth.
Halleluia.

LOaue ye o servants of ye lord / loaue ye the name of the Lord.

Which minister in the house of the Lord / and in the vtwarde court of the
temple of our God.

Praise the Lord / for the Lord is good: sing ye unto his name / for it is
plesaunt.

For the Lord has chosen him Jacob: and Israel to be his own special people.

For I know that great is the Lord / and our Lord is above al ye gods What
soever it plesed the Lord / he has made it in heaven and earth / both in ye
sea and in all deep places He brings the clouds from the coostis of the
earth / he turns lightenings into rain / and brings forth the winds from
their secret place.

Which smote the first begote^ of Egypt / both of man and beast.

He sent miracles and woundres into the mids of the / o Egypt: he wrought
them upon Pharao and al his servants.

Which smote the mighty nations / and killed strong kings.

As Sihon the king of Thamorrhes / Og king of Basan / and all the kingdoms of
Chanaan.

And gave up their land into the possession / and heretage unto Israel his
people.

Lord thy name is everlasting / Lord thy memorial stretches unto every
posterite.

For it is the Lord that auengeth his people / and is graciouse unto his
servants.

The images of the ge^tyls ar but silver and gold / even the work of mennis
handis.

They have mouths / but they speak not: and eyes / but they se not: ears have
they and hear not / and nostrel also / but yet comes their no breath out of
their mouths.

They be like unto them that make them / and all that trust in the^. But thou /
o house of Israel / loaue thou the Lord / o house of Aaron preise the Lord.

Oh house of Leui praise the Lord / ye that worship the Lord / loaue the
Lord.

The Lord which dwells in Jerusalem / be praised in zion.

Praise ye the Lord.
An open thankis geuinge.
Give ye thankis unto the Lord / for he is good / and his mercy endurethe for
ever.

Give ye thankis unto the God of al goddis / for his mercy endures for ever.

Give thankis unto the Lord of Lordis / for his mercy endures for ever.

The lamentacion of the captives in Babylon with a thretening of the vengeance
of god.
WE dwelt at the flowds of Babylon / and wept when we remembered zion.

There had we hanged up our harpes on the salow treis.

And when they that held us captyue required of us our songs and thankful
psalms / sayng / sing us of your songs of zion: we answerde.

How should we singe the songs of the Lord in a strange land?

Not with stonding yet sooner shall I forget my nown right hand / then Jerusalem
should fall fro my mind.

Let my tongue lose her use / if I forget the / let it cleue to my chawnes if I
prefer not Jerusalem in my mirthe.

But Lord remember the Idumes how they dealt with us in yt miserable calamite
of Jerusalem / how they said / Subuerte it / and turn it up sodowne.

Oh Babylon / thou shall come unto as miserable a destruction thy self: happy
shall he be that shall requyte the worthily / serui^g the as thou seruedst us.

Oh happy man which shall take up thy infantis / and cast them agenst the
stones.

Tgankis for our daily benefits
I Shall thank the with all my heart / and preise the eue^ among the highest.

I shall faldowne prostrate in thy holy temple / and magnifye thy name / both
thy mercy and truth / for thy word thou magnifyest according to thy name.

When I call upon the / thou answerest / and enrichest my soul with thy
strength.

All the kings of the earth / when they shall hear the wordis of thy mouth /
they shall magnifye the / Oh lord.

And shall singe aftir the ordinance of the lord / because ye right great is
the majesty of the lord.

For the lord / although he be excellent high / yet he seith low thingis /
and knowth high thingis a far.

If I walk in the mids of tribulacio^ / thou refresshest me / thou sendest
thy power into the furiouse wodenes of my enimes / and sauest me with thy right
hand.

The lord makes me suer on every side / lord thy goodness is everlasting /
the workis therefore of thy hondis suffer thou not to fall.

The clear goodness of the dyuyne wysedom is described / with a prayer agenst
the ungodly.
Lord / thou enserchest me depely / and ensiest me perfitly Thou know how I
must sit down / and how I shall rise agene / thou prouidest me my lyui^g a far
of.

My journey and my sitting down thou disposest / and seist al my ways.

ye there is not one so little a word upon my tongue / but lo Lord thou / thou
knowist it before.

Before and aftir thou have fasshioned me / and have put to thy nowne hand And
that with a craft more marvelous and high the^ I can know or comprehend.

Whother should I flee from thy spirit? or from thy presence / whother may I
avoid?

If I should clyme into heaven / there thou art: if I should ru^downe to hell /
lo there art thou not abse^te If I should take me the wings of the morninge /
and dwell in the fardest costs of the sea.

Eue^ there yet is thy hand ready to take me / and thy rightha^de has m^ yet
when I thus decre with my sylf paradue^ture derkenes may hyde me / so yt the
night may be my light Now / another is the derkenes so thick but that thou
seist through them / ye the night is as bright to the / as is the light / night
and day to the be both one.

For it is thou that possedest my raynes / thou inuoluedst me in my mothers
womb,

I thank ye / for I am meruelously made / meruelouse ar thy workis / as my
mind vehemently aknowlegeth.

My bones are not yet hyd from ye / in how secret soever a place I am made /
even with in the secrets of the grownde.

Thy eyes ensee my fawtes / and in they book ar their al written / my days were
fasshioned / when as yet there was not one of them.

Oh God / how preciouse ar thy friends unto me? how great is the nowmber of the
chief of the^: When I go about to tell the^ / the excede the sands of ye
sea: I am a wake yet / and present with the Oh god / will thou not slaye these
sinners / that the wiked me^ might once avoid from the?

Which so boldly rebel agens^ the: even thy enimes which set up their
bristles so temerariousl^ agenst the.

Do I not hate the^ that hate the oh Lord / and am hangry with the adversaries?

I hate them verily and that excedingly / for that now they ar also be come my
enimes to.

Try me oh god / and search my heart / prove me and know my thoughts And if
thou seist me in any laborouse wyked way / reduce and turn me into ye way
euerlasti^ge

A prayer for the delyurance from the evil sayers and a wait layers /
threteninge a sharp end unto the ungodly and ioyouse success unto the good.
Deliver me lord from the wiked man / keep me from the cruel man.

Which conceive shrewed counsels in their hertis / and stere up strife
continually.

They whette their tongues like serpe^ts: they nourish edders veno^ with in
their lips. so theide.
Sela.

Preserve me lord / from the hands of the ungodly / save me from the cruel
tyraunts whose mind is to supplant my steapes

For the proud have hyde^ preuely a snare for me / they have bent for me a
net: and which way so ever my way lies / they have laid me stombling
blokes. So they have.
Sela. Wherefore I say unto the Lord / thou art my God / lord hear the voice
of my prayer.

Lerde be thou my mighty salvation / kouer my head i^ time of batail Lean thou
not oh lord unto the desyers of ye ongodly / finissh not his enforceme^ts /
lest he be to prowed. No do not
Sela

Let their own laborouse devices be whelmed on their own hendis / which
circumuent me.

Let burning coals fall upon the^ / let them be cast into the fire and pit /
so that they may not rise.

A man full of wordis let hi^ not stand fast upon ye earth / a violent and evil
man let the^ be honted unto death For I know suerly that the Lord auengeth the
pore afflicte: and delyuereth the destitute al help. But yet shall the
rightwise magnify thy name / and the just shall walk in thy presence.

David praith that his mouth be kept / that he chances not into ill company /
nether fall not into the handis of the wyked.
Lord / the do I call upon: haast ye unto me / atte^de unto my noise crying
unto the. Let my prayer be ence^se asce^ding before ye / and theleuacio^ of my
handis be the evening sacrifyce.

Set a keeper oh lord unto my mouth / and watchers at the gate of my lips.

Suffer not my heart to slide unto any euel thing / so yt I follow not ye
cou^sail either of ye ungodly / or of any sinful men / lest I be partaker of
their pleasant proyes.

Let the just man beat me / and so shall it be accept unto me / let him correk
me / vnd so shall he anoint my head / and not hurt it / but yet for the evil
deadis of these men shall I pray.

Their iuges sto^bled at the stone / but yet gave they heed to my wordis / for
they were right glad to the^ Our bones lie scatred before the grave: no another
wise the^ while one kutteth and diggeth up ye grownde But upon ye oh lord my
god / ar my eyes set / in ye do I trust / draw thou not out my soul.
Preserve me from the snare which they have bent for me / and from the stombling
stones of these mischeuouse doers.

Let the ungodly fall into their own nettis / whiles I in the mea^ time pass
over them.

A prae of one in distress.
Unto the Lord do I cry full loud: unto ye Lord I make my supplicacio^. I
powerforth my complaint before him / and my trouble before him do I lay forth:
while my mind is almost in dispayer.

For unto the is my way well known / but yet in this way where in I go they
have set preuy snares for me.

Consider at my right hand and behold / and thou shall not find one that will
know me / all refugy is taken fro me / nether is there any that helps to save
my life.

Unto the therefore do I cry oh lord / and I say / thou art my hope and my
portion in the land of the lyuinge.

Attend unto my prayer for I am very pore and feeble / deliver me fro my
persuers / for they prevail agenst me.

Led my soul forth of preson yt I might magnify thy name / which thing if
thou grauntest me / the just shall associat themself with me.

A prayer of one in distress.
Lord hear my prayer / understand my desyer for thy truth and rightwysnes.

But yet enter not into judgment with thy servant / for thou being thaccuser /
no man mortal is absolved For the enemy is present at my life / to trede it
under his fete / and to lay me in the perpetual derkenes of the deadmen.

Wherefore my mind with in me is uncertain / and my heart with in me despaireth.

yet remember I the old time / I forgete not all thy workis / and the workis
of thy handis I call unto mind.

I stretch forth my handis unto the / my soul cries unto the from the
theirsty land. Sela. so it does

Haste the Lord to help me / for my spryte fails me / hyde not thy chere
fro me / lest I be like men going down into their graves.

Show me swiftly thy merciable goodness / for in the do I trust / show me in
what way I may go / for unto yt I direct my mind Deliver me Lord / fro my
enimes / for unto the do I fle.

Teache me to work thy pleasure / for thou art my God.

Thy beninge spirit might lead me forth into the land of innocencye.

Refresh me Lord for thy names sake / and for thy rightwisnes lead my soul
out of distress.

Also / for thy mercys sake scater my enimes / and destroy all that molest my
soul / for I am thy servant.

Thankis giving / and a prayer for the delyuerance from our enimyes.
THankis be unto the Lord my refugy: which enstructeth my ha^dis unto batail
and my fyngers to fight.

My expectacio^ / my bolwerck / my castle / my redemer / my shylde / in whom I
trust / which governs my subject people.

Lord what is man that thou acknowlegest him? what is man mortal yt thou thus
regardest him? Man is like a thing of naught / his days pass over like a
shadewe. Lord / when thou bowest down thy heuens to descend thou touchest the
hills / and they smoke. When thou lightenest / thou scaterest them / thou
shotest forth thy dartis and destroyst them.

Put down therefore thy hand from above / deliver and take me up from these
vehement great waters / even from the violence of the ungodly Whose mouths
speak lies / and their right hond is full of deceait. That I might singe unto
the / oh God / a new song: that I might sing unto the with a ten stringed lute.

Which enrichest kings with health: which have delyuerd David thy servant from
the dent of sword.

Deliver me from the hand of aleau^ts: whose mouth speak vanites / and their
righthand full of deceait.

That our sons / from their yougth might grow like plants / and our
daughters might shine like the polisshed pylers in ye temple Let our garners
and store houses be full and well stored with all thi^gis: and our flockis in our
villages increase into thousa^dys and hundred thousandts.

Let our oxen be strong to labor / let there be no ruin / no breach / no
complaynt crying out in our streatis.

Oh happy people whose goodis stand in this state / Oh happy people unto who^ ye
lord is their god

God is praised for his omnipotency / goodness / providence / and justice
I Shall extol the / oh god my king: I shall praise thy name for ever.

At al time shall I magnify the / and praise thy name for ever and ever Great
is the Lord / and above al praise / nether may his gretenes be serched.

One posterite shall show thy workis to another: and prechforth thy power.

I shall speak forth / thy honor / they clear fame / thy magnifyce^ce / and thy
actis never to be forgote^. The memorial of thy infinite mercy shall be preched
/ and ye form of thy iustificacion shall be sunge^. Mylde and mercifulis ye
Lord / slow unto wrath and ready to forgive The lord is benign to al me^ /
his mercy shyneth in all his workis. Wherefore / al thy workis / oh lord /
preche ye / and thy faithful thank ye They preche ye glory of thy kingdom / ad
declare thy power.

That they might tell forth thy power / thy clerenes / and thy gloriouse
kingdom unto other men. Thy kingdom is through out al wordis thy empery
endures through al ages.

The lord holds up al yt should fall: and lifts up age^ the^ yt be down Al
eyes wait upon the / and thou geuest the^ their meat in their time

Thou openest thy hand / and fillest every beast plentuously.

Rightwise is ye lord in all his ways: and holy in all his workis The lord is
present with all that call upon him / so long as they call on him of faith.

He acomplessheth the desire of them that reuere^tly fere him: he hereth their
cryinge / and helps the^ The lord defe^deth al ye love him but all the
ungodly he scatereth

My mouth might speak his praise / and every thing living might celebrate
his holy name for ever and ey. Alleluia.

Only god is to be trusted unto
LOaue the lord / my soul.

While I live shall I loaue the lord: I shall singe unto my god whyl I shall have
my being. Trust not unto princes / nor unto any other man / in who^ there is
no For when ye breath goes out (health of man / he retourneth unto his earth and
the^ are al his thoughtis gone Oh happy man whose strength is ye god of Jacob /
whose hope is in ye lord his god.

Which has made heaven / the earth the sea / and whatsoever is in them: which
keeps promise for ever.

Which auengeth me^ violently oppressed / and gives meat to the hongry: happy
is he yt calls unto ye lord / which loses me^ bound in preson.

Onto the lord (I say) which gives sight unto the blind / and lifts up
men fallen: unto the lord / which loves the just men.

Which takes up to him / the strangers: and defends the fatherless and the
wedowe / but the way off the ungodly he dampneth.

The lord thy God / o zion / raygneth for ever / world without end. Alleluia.

LOaue ye the lord / for good it is to singe unto our God: a glad and fayer
thing is it to loaue him altogether.

For the lord restores Jerusalem and gathers together the dispersed people
of Israel.

He heleth the contrite in heart / and binds up their woundis.

He tells ye innumerable stars and calls them al by their name Great is
our lord / and infinite is his power / and i^co^prehe^sible is his wisdom The
lord easith thafflicte / and throith down the wyked to the earth. Singe ye in
course to ye lord his praise / sing to our god with harp Which couerth ye
sky with cloudis to prepare rain for ye earth: which decketh ye hills with
grene Which gives our catel (flowers their fode / and even the ravens that call
upon him / he fedeth.

He delyteth not in the strength of horsemen / nether in the armed leggis of
soudyers.

But he reioyseth in the^ ye reverence him / and trust unto his mercy.

PRaise thou the lord o Jerusalem: loaue thy god / o zio^ Which strengthens
the bars of thy gatis / and gives thy citezens prosperouse success.

He settith peace with in thy coostes: and fills the with the flower Which

his word.

He gives ye snow like wul / and scatereth ye frosty ryme like ashes He
casts forth hisyise lyk smoth shyuers / who may abide his cold? Agene / at

He expowneth his word to Jacob: his pleasures and godly actis unto Israel.
