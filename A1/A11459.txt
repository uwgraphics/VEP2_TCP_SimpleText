One in nature and substance, but distinguished into three persons, namely the
Father, the Son, and the holy Ghost.

Q. Why did God make all things?

A. For his own glory.

Q. Why for his glory?

A. Because he is most worthy to be glorified, that only was and is able to
give glory to all things.

Q How does man glorify God?

A. By believing in him, and keeping his Commandments. John 15.1.


Q. What is to be believed of God?

A. The Articles of the Christian Fath comprehended in the Apostles Creed,
which is, I believe in God, etc.

Q. Which are Gods Commandments, Exodus 20.1. Deuteronomy. 5.6.
and how many be they?

Chapter of Exodus, saying, I. I am the Lord thy God, etc.

Q. Can you keep these Commandments?

Romans 2.9. Gal. 3.22.

Q. What is due unto them that do not keep Gods Commandments?

Deuteronomy. 25.26. Romans 4.15. Deuteronomy. 23.22.

Q. How will you then escape these things? Gal. 3.13. 1 These. 1.10. Ephesians. 1.7.
Acts 4.1.2.


A. By Jesus Christ, mine only Redeemer and Savior.

Q. Why, what did Christ for you?

A. He dyed for my sins, and rose again for my justification. Romans 4.25.


Q. What is Christ?

A. The Son of God. Mat. 16.16. and 17.5. Luke 4.14. Heb. 1.5. 1 Pet. 3.18.


Q. Why, how could the Son of God suffer death?

A. He suffered in his Manhood: for he is both God and Man in one person.

Q. How can that be? Romans 1.3.4. Phil. 2.6, 7.


A. Yes very well: for as the body and the soul do make but one Man: so God
and man are but one Christ. A^hanas. Symb.


Q. How do you know that Christ dyed and rose again for you?

A. By Faith, because I verily believe it.

Q. Whence comes faith?

A. It is the gift and work of God, Phil. 1.29. John 6.29.
wrought in my heart by the Holy Ghost, who sanctifies me and all GODS chosen
Children. John 12.13. Romans 8.11. 1 Cor. 6.11. 2 These. 2.13.


Q. By what means does the Holy Ghost work faith in you?

A. By the Word of GOD, called the Old Testament and the New.

Q. How by the Word of God?

Iosu. 2.8. Job 5.19. Acts 17.11. Esaias 1.2.
A. By reading and meditating, and conferring upon it: But most especially by
hearing it preached and expounded unto me: as Saint Paul says in the tenth
Chapter to the Romans: Faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the Word of
God. Romans 10.17.


Q. How is Faith strengthened and increased?

A. By the same Word, and by the Sacraments. Acts 2.42.


Q What is a Sacrament?

A. It is an outward sign ordained by Christ, to signify an inward and
invisible Grace.

Q. How many Sacraments be there?

2 Cor. 11.12. John 5.6. 1 Cor. 11.23. Mat. 28.16. Acts 8.38. and 10.47.
A. Two: Baptism, and the Lords Supper.

Q. What is Baptism?

A. It is both an eternal or outward washing of the body with water: and also
an inward and spiritual washing of our souls and bodies from sin in the
bloodshed and merits of our Lord JESUS Christ. 1 Cor. 12.13. Ephesians. 5.26.
Titus 3.5.


Q. So then the sign in Baptism is Water: and the invisible Grace, is
Regeneration or New birth, which we have of Jesus Christ. Is it not so?

A. It is so. For by Jesus Christ we have both remission of our sins, and
Sanctification from them, Col. 1.14. 1 John 1.7. 1 Cor. 1.30.
and that is Regeneration or New Birth.

Q. What is the Lords Supper?

A. It is the representation of his death and passion, under the visible signs
of Bread and Wine. Luke 22.19. 1 Cor. 11.24.25.


Q. Why is it called the Lords Supper?

A. Because it was ordained by the Lord immediately after Supper, as a second
banquet or spiritual Supper: Luke 22.29. 1 Cor. 11.25.
For as our bodies do feed upon natural food: So our souls and bodies both
are spiritually nourished with the spiritual Manna that came down from
heaven, which is our Lord Jesus Christ. John 6.41. 1 Cor. 10.3.4.


Q. What is then received by you in this Supper?

A. Outwardly by the Mouth, Bread and Wine: But inwardly by faith in my heart,
Mat. 26.2. 1 Cor. 10.21. Verse 16.
the Body and Blood of Christ: and therefore it is also called the Lords Table,
and the holy Communion.

Q. How can you do this?

Mat. 26.27. and 27.26.29. John. 19.34. Heb. 9.28. and 1.10.
A. Thus: I do steadfastly believe, that Jesus Christ the Son of God, is God
and Man, and that his Body was broken, that is to say, whipped, scourged, and
buffetted, and crucified, and pierced with a spear, and many ways afflicted:
and that his Blood gushed out, and flowed from him, to make a sacrifice to God,
and satisfaction for my sins: and so feeding upon my Lord and Savior
spiritually by faith, I eat and drink his body and blood.

Q. Then do you not think that in this Bread and Wine there is present the
very natural Body and Blood of Christ, as he was borne of the Virgin Mary?

A. No. God forbid. For his natural Body is now ascended up into Heaven, and
is glorified, Acts 1.9.
and ^itteth at the right hand of GOD the Father, Ephesians. 7.55. Ephesians. 1.10.
Colos. 3. Acts 3.25.
and from thence he shall not come till the end of the world.

Q. Is not Christ then present in the Sacrament?

A. Yes: He is truly and indeed represented unto our says. For the breaking
of the Bread signifies his tormented body, and the pouring out of the Wine,
the shedding of his most precious Blood. 1 Cor. 10.16.


Q. Then me thinks there is a difference between our common bread and wine
which we receive for our daily sustenance, and this Bread and Wine?

A. No doubt there is.

Q. What is that?

A. The Bread and Wine which we commonly receive, do nothing differ from
these in substance, but only in the use and end.

Q. How so?

A. For these we take and use, to the end that our bodies only may be
nourished: But these we receive, to signify the great mystery of our
Redemption purchased by Jesus Christ. And therefore they are called holy
mysteries, because they lively set forth and seal the same unto us.

Q. Do all that receive the Bread and Wine, also partake the Body and Blood of
Christ?

A. No verily: For they that receive unworthily, eat and drink their own
damnation, as Saint Paul says. Cor. 12.9.


Q. How then shall we be worth^ receivers, and come to this Table a^ we
ought to come?

A. If we examine and prepare ou^ selves. Ibid verse 28.


Q. How shall we come prepared?

A. Observing four things. First If we have true repentance for ou^ sins
past. Secondly, If we have a lively Faith in the death of ou^ Lord Jesus
Christ. 1 Repentance. 2 Faith.
Thirdly, I^ we be in love and charity with all ^uen, Fourthly, 3 Charity. 4
Thankfulness.
If we be thankful to our Almighty Savior, for his great goodness declared
in his holy Supper, as a sure pledge of his love: In respect of which duty of
ours, it is called the Eucharist or Sacrament of thanksgiving.

Q. What is required in true Repentance?

A. Chiefly four things: Confession, Contrition, Faith, and purpose of
amendment. First, That we acknowledge our selves sinners. Secondly, Psalm.
32.5. 1 John 1.9. Joel 2.13. 2 Cor. 7.10.
that we be heartily and sincerely sorry for our sins. Thirdly, that we
beleevee steadfastly for the merits Jesus Christ, they shall be forgiven.
Fourthly, Acts 10.13.
that we fully resolve, and purpose with our selves, never to commit them nor
the like again, but to lead the rest of our lives according to Gods holy will
and commandments. Mat. 3.8.11. and 4.17. Ephesians. 4.28. 2 Pet. 1.20. Heb. 10.26.


Q. What faith is here required of you?

A. A special and peculiar faith, th^^ applies to my soul and conscien^^ the
Body and Blood of Jesus Christ crucified and shed for me as truly (...) my
mouth receives the Bread that broken* John 6.47.48. etc.
and the Wine that is powr^^ out.

Q Why is charity so necessary?

A. For these causes: first, because our Savior Christ commands it secondly,
Mat. 5.13.
because if we do not from our hearts forgive one another, n^ more will our
heavenly Father fo^give us: thirdly, because the Supper does signify unto us,
Mat. 61.8.5. and 18.35.
first the unspeakeable love of Christ toward us, that gave himself for us.
Gal. 1.4.
Secondly, the uniting of u^ all that are Gods Children, bot^ with him our
Head, and amon^ our selves: And for that reason it i^ called by the Apostle
Paul, John 1.3. 1 Cor. 10.16.17. Ibid.
the Communion.

Q. Well, how shall we be thankful

A. If we worship and serve God.

Q How ought GOD to be worshipped?

A. In spirit and truth. John 4.25.


Q. How must we serve him?

^. With all our heart, and all our ^^ule, and all our mind, and all our
^trength, and that not so much for ^are as for love. Deuteronomy. 6.5. Mat. 22.27.
Luke 1.74. Romans 8.15.


Q. Are we able of our selves to per^^rme these things?

^. No truly: But only by the ^ree Grace of GOD in Jesus Christ our Lord,
without whom ^ee can do nothing: for whose ^^ke, 1 John 15.5.
whatsoever is done amiss (...) pardoned, and whatsoever is ^eft undone, is
supplied: 2 Cor. 5.22.
For when we have done all that we can ^oe, we are but unprofitable ser^ants.
Luke 17.10.


Q. How will you obtain the grace ^f God?

A. By true and hearty prayer in the ^ame and mediation of his Son Jesus
Christ. Mat. 7.7. Luke 11.9. John 14.13. and 16.23. Mat. 21.22. Mark 11.24.
James. 1.6. Luke 1.81. James 5.16.


Q. How ought we to pray that we may obtain?

A. First, faithfully, with an assured trust in GODS mercies. Secondly,
fervently, with an earnest desire and zeal to obtain^ Thirdly, Romans 12.12.
Ephesians. 5.18. 2 Thessalonians. 5.17.
continually, with godly perseverance and importunity, never fainting till we
be heard.

Q. What is the best form of Prayer?

A. The same which is called the Lords Prayer, because the Lord him self
devised and delivered it t^ his Disciples in the Gospel, saying When ye pray,
pray thus:

Mat. 6.4. Luke* 11.2.
Our Father which art in heaven hallowed be thy name, etc.

A Prayer.
ALmighty God, most gracious and loving Father, vouchsafe we beseech thee, to
lighten our minds with the knowledge of thy Truth, to mollify our hearts with
the dew of thy grace, to subdue our affections to the obedience of thy heavenly
will: Forgiving our sins, and making us thankful for all thy benefits, that
we may live and dye in thy faith, fear, and love, through Jesus Christ our
Lord and only Savior, Amen.

Laus Deo semper.
