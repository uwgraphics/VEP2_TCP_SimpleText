TO THE RIGHT HONORABEL, ALLEN COTTON, Lord Mayor of the City of London, all
comfort in Christ.
Right Honorable:

By Christ, Gods justice is satisfied, Ephesians. 5.2. his wrath appeased, 1 The.

the curse of the Law abolished, Gal. 3.13 Sin, 1 Cor. 15.55, 56, 57.
Death, and Hell, vanquished, the Devil subdued, Heb. 2.14. and our selves,
and souls, only by Christ eternally saved. 2 Timothy 1.10.
Seeing Christ then is not ashamed to own us, Heb. 2.11. we should not be
ashamed to own him, no not if need be, Mar. 8.38.
before an adulterous and sinful generation. But as in heart to believe in
him, Romans 10.10.
so with mouth and tongue to confess him: with our soul to magnify him, Luke
1.46.47.
and with our spirit within us evermore to be uttering forth of his most
worthy praises. To this end, I presumed some years since, with the poor
widow, to cast into the Lords Treasury, this small Mite, called None but
Christ: the which howsoever it has been often imprinted, yet hitherto
dedicated to none but unto your Honorable Self. The causes moving me
hereunto, are not a few. Especially when I call to remembrance that unfeigned
love, which at the first sprang toward me, from your dear Brethren, and my
faithful and worshipful good friends, Mr William and Master Roger Cotton
(both well reported of for good works) and ever since their decease, has been
most freely and firmly rooted and settled toward me in your worthy self.
And not only so, but for many years really expressed; to the no little
comfort of me and mine. In lieu whereof, Right Honorable, Lo here, by way of

be famous in this our London, a plentiful storehouse, as of corporal, so of
spiritual bread.
Bethelem, there shall not be wanting his poor prayers, who ever rests

Your Honors humbly at commandment, CLEMENT COTTON.

TO THE READER.
AMongst the many miseries that have light upon us by the fall of our first
parents, those of the soul are chiefest; and amongst them, this is not the
least, that though we be convinced by the Word and Spirit, to be forlorn
creatures, yet we naturally shun to take any knowledge thereof.

No man is rocked so fast asleep in the cradle of security, but at one time
or another, this alarm rings in his ears: Romans 3.19, 2^. Eccle 11 9. and
12.14.
Thou have sinned, and therefore must come to judgment. But who trembles in
himself at the sound thereof, that he might find rest in the day of trouble?
Hab. 3.16.


It cannot be, but these troubled thoughts will now and then fasten upon the
most hard-hearted and impenitent sinner; Dan 5.6.
Act. 24.26.
surely all things are not well between God and me; and, what will become of me
another day? 1 Pet. 4.10.
And yet where is he for all that, who will presently fall to searching and
judging of himself, Lam. 3.40.
1 Cor. 11.3.
that he might not be judged of the Lord? No, the heart of man is naturally
swollen with such a devilish pride, Romans 8.7, 8.
Isai, 65.2.
that though he know God is, and will be, his Judge, Romans 2.16.
yet will he not make supplication to his Judge. Job 9.15. 1 Pet. 5.5, 6
And albeit we know that GOD resists the proud, and has decreed in himself
to stain all the glory thereof; Isa. 23.9. Dan. 4.34.
yet walk we on still in our pride, against him. But who was ever fierce
against him and prospered? 1 Cor. 10.22. Job 9.4.


Thou then that art as yet in thy natural estate, I wish thee in the name of
GOD, speedily to examine thy self upon thy bed: Psalm. 6.4. Zeph. 2.1.
and between the Lord and thee, propound these questions to thy soul; Soul,
what say thou to the guilt of Adams sin? Romans 5.12.
It is imputed to thee, I pray thee how shall we answer it? Thou know that
this guilt binds us over to eternal death, Romans 5.16. and 6.23. Psalm. 139.7. 2.
Cor. 5.10.
there is no fleeing for us, from the face of the Judge, what shall become of
thee and me, Act. 17.31.
in the day of the Lords wrath? Thou know, that all our righteousness is but
as filthy clouts, Isai. 64.6. Job 14.4. Psalm. 67.7.
and how shall we be able to stand before the Lords pure eyes, Hab. 1.13.
which can behold no impurity? Thou know also that our sins are above
measure sinful, yea, Ezra 9.6.
far exceeding the sands of the sea, Rom 7.13.
both for weight and number; Psalm. 40.11. Psalm. 38.4.
must they not needs then sink us to hell, without recovery? For Gods sake (O
my soul) let us look about us, and whilst space, Revel. 221.
place, and means are allotted us, Isai. 55.6.
ponder we seriously these things in time. Let us, I pray thee, take unto us
words, and now, Hos. 14.2.
even now turn again unto the LORD, from whom we have too too long, Isa.
53.6.
most woefully erred: Beseech we him, that he would take away all iniquity and
receive us graciously, that we may eu^r hereafter render him the calves of our
lips.

Thus or in the like manner, should every one that mean to escape the
judgment of GOD, Rom 2.30
and the just damnation of hell, Mat. 23.33.
question and reason with his own soul. For it is not the guiltless, Luke
15.18, 19. and 18.13.
but the guilty, that prizeth a pardon; it is not the whole, but the sick,
Mat 9.2.
that is glad of the Physician: So, if sin make thee not sick at the very
heart, Act. 2.37.4.38.
thou will not esteem of Christ, nor of the salvation which he has brought
for all brokenhearted sinners, Luke 4.18.
no more than of a rush. Math. 22.5.


A little to help thee then, that have not yet felt the spiritual sickness
(and also somewhat to refresh the memory of th^se who have) here is in a short
sum discovered unto thee, some of the maladies of thy soul, showing thee how
Christ is both the Physician, and medicine of them severally, as the title
given to the Book, None but Christ, none but Christ, gives thee to understand.

Touching the which, if thou would I should yield thee a reason; then know,
that I took it not up at random; but as I found them the words, and those the
last words of a constant Martyr of Christ, John Lambert by name; which (as I
conceive) being uttered by him, as the triumphant voice of faith, after that
he had, through the power of Christ, put to flight the fear of Hell, Sin,
and Death, etc. (as by doubling of them may appear) So by way of imitation, I
think them (not tying any to sillables) well beseeming the thoughts, and
speeches also of every Christian, upon safe and sure grounds, as in their
daily, so even in their last conflicts to be taken up and used. Not as if
hereby it were my meaning to exclude, See Ioh. 3.16. Titus 3.5.
or shut out either the Father, or the holy Ghost, from having an hand in the
work of our salvation, as well as Christ: but attributing the same to him
only, Romans 8.34
as to the sole meritorious cause thereof: And so I bid thee heartily farewell.

Thine in Christ, C.C.

NONE BUT CHRIST.
1 Fall.
I Am fallen in Romans 5.12. Amos 7.2.5
Adam, I am fallen, I am fallen, Oh! who shall raise me?

None but Christ, who as he is set for thy vprising, Lke 2.34. so is he Heb.
7.25
perfectly able to Ioh. 10.28, 29.
keep thee, that thou fall not again, from thine own steadfastness, Iud. 24.

2 Guilt.
By my fall I have offended au Ier. 23.24. Psa. 139.7.
infinite Majesty: and who shall plead for me? 1 Samuel 2.25.

None but Christ, who being also an Isai. 63.1. Act. ^0.28. Isai. 53.5, 6
infinite Majesty, Romans 9.5. has by his own blood, fully satisfied the
justice of his Father for thy offense this way committed against him, 1 Pet.
2.24. Ephesians 5.2. Iam. 4.3. Romans 5.10. and 8.7.


3 Enmity.
This offense has bred enmity between God and me, Col. 1.20, 21. who is
meet to reconcile us?

None but Christ, 2 Cor 5.19.
who by his Romans 3.25. Col. 1.20.21.
blood has not only made perfect peace between God and thee, but has so
ratified and confirmed the same, Ephesians 2.^6, 17.
that nothing shall be ever able to disolue it.

4 Strangeness.
This enmity has bred Ephesians. 4.18.
strangeness between God and me, Coloss. 1.21 and who shall bring me into
fellowship with him again? Ioh. 1.3, 5, ^, 7.


1 Cor. 1.9. 1 Pet. 3.18.
None but Christ, has who suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, not
only that he might bring thee to God, but has also so Romans 5.2.
settled this fellowship between him and thee, (who art by faith ingrafted into
him) that none shall be ever able to break it off again, Ioh. 1.12. Gal.
3.26, 27.
Ier. 32.40. Rom 8.35.


5 Filth.
But alas, Job 15.16. Leu. 13.45. Psalm. 51.5.
I am unclean, I am unclean. For behold, I was borne in iniquity, and in
sin has my mother conceived me, and who now shall cleanse me? Job 14.4.

Zac. 13.1.
None but Christ, who not only is that Lamb of God, who takes away the
Signifying that original sin, which is the fountain of all. sin. See Luke
2.23.
sin or the world, Ioh. 1.29. but was also borne holy, and conceived by the
And thus we find in our nature that holiness which by nature we want.
holy Ghost, Luke 1.35. to cover the impurity of thy conception and birth, Heb.
2.10.

6 Darkness.
And thus as a woeful wight, Isai. 60.2. Mat. 4.16. Ioh. 1.5. 1 Ioh. 5.19.
sit I in double darkness, having justly lost by this my sorrowful downfall
with the 2 Cor. 44. Deu. 29 20
light of Gods Image, Ephesians. 4.18. the light of Gods countenance; and who now
shall be a light unto me.

Luke 1.79
None but Christ, who is come a light into this world, to the end that
whosoever believes in him, should not only not abide in darkness, Ioh. 12.46.
but might also have the light of life, Ioh. 8.12.

7 Dead.
Not only am I Ioh. 1.5.8. Ephesians. 5.8.
drenched in this woeful darkness, but therein by nature I lie Ephe. 2.5.
Mat. 4.16.
stark dead in trespasses and sins, who shall now quicken me?

Ioh. 5.25.
None but Christ, who is not only come, that thou might have life, 2 Timothy
1.1.
and that also in abundance, Ioh. 10.10.
but so to confirm thee in this life, (if thou believe in him) that thou shall
never dye, Ioh. 11.25. and 14, 19. Beleeuest thou this?

8 Corrupt.
But I sensibly feel (to my utter undoing I fear) that the devil has shed
in to my whole man, Romans 6.6. Col. 2.11.
the venom and poison of his cursed nature, Ioh, 8.44. Romans 7.24.
who shall cure me of it?

None but Christ, who came not only to lose the works of the devil, in thee,
1 Ioh 3.8.
but which more is, to make thee partaker of the divine Not of the substance,
but of the divine qualities.
nature, 2. Pet. 1.4. Heb. 12.10.

9 Bondage.
And to this vile corruption, am I by nature a servant and Ioh. 8.34.
wretched bondman, who shall free me from so woeful a slavery.

Romans 7.15.
None but Christ, who came not only to preach deliverance to such miserable
captives as thou art, Luke 4.18.
but that in setting thee free, thou might be That is, that we might have
not a fained, ^^t a true liberty and freedom from all infernal foes.
free indeed, Ioh. 8.36.

10 Penury.
A man may have light, life, and liberty, and yet perish for lack of food,
who shall furnish my poor Psa 106.15.
affammished soul with that? Revel. 3.17.

None but Christ, who first (if thou be athirst) bids thee come to him and
drink of the water of life, Ioh. 7.37.
and that Isa. 55.1. Reu. 22.17.
freely, not for a while to quench thy thirst; but that in drinking of the
water which he shall give thee, thou might That is, such shall never be so
thirsty, but the spirit of grace, (as an everliving fountain) will be at hand
to satisfy their thirst, See Ioh. 7.38.
never be more athirst, seeing it shall be in thee a well of water springing up
into everlasting life, Ioh. 4.13.14. and 7.38.

And he also is that bread of life, which came down from heaven, Ioh. 6.48,
51. of which, if by faith thou spiritually eatest, it shall not only preserve
thy soul from famishing and death, but shall cause it to live for ever, Ioh.
6.50.
Ioh. 6.51.

11 Naked.
But yet my Isai. 64.6. Genesis 3.7. Reu. 3.17.18.
filthy nakedness will appear, who shall cover that?

None but Christ, Reu. 3.17
whose white raiment shall not only Romans 4.6, 7.
cover the shame of thy nakedness, that the Hab. 1.13
pure eyes of God shall not Number 23 21.
behold it, Reu. 3.17, 18. but therein also (he having granted thee to be
arrayed therewith) will present thee therein glorious to himself without Reu.
19.8.
Jude 24.
spot or wrinckle, or any such thing, Col. ^.22.
Ephesians. 5.27.

11 Curse.
Me thinks I Hab. 3.16.
tremble and quake for fear, in my self, when I hear that terrible
thunderbolt of the Law, Cursed is Gal. 3.10.
every man that continues not in Deuteronomy. 27.26. and 29.21
all things which are written in the book of the Law to do them. Who shall
free me from it?

Isai. 53.4, 5, 6.
None but Christ, who has not only redeemed thee from the curse of the Law,
Gal. 3.13.
being made a curse for thee, but has brought thee also within compass of
that promised true Ephesians. 1.3
blessedness, made to faithful Abraham, Gal. 3.9.14.

13 Terror.
Now whilst I remain thus held (as it were at Gods suite) under this terrible
arest, Cursed is every one, etc. me thinks I see how all the creatures in
heaven and earth, Genesis 7.11. stand ready armed at his only beck to revenge
the quarrel of his covenant upon me, Leu. 26.25.
Psalm. 76.7.
who is there in heaven or earth, that can set them again at one with me?

None but Christ, who having by his own blood reconciled God himself (who is
the Lord of Hosts, Col. 1.20. Romans 3.25.
and so of all creatures) unto thee he has much more reconciled every
creature in heaven and earth unto thee. Isai. 11.6. Hose. 2.18.19.20.


14 Loss.
Moreover, whilst in this case, a daily, Pro. 16.26.
and (in a manner) hourly necessity lies upon me to use the benefit of
food, raiment, recreation, sleep, etc. yea of breathing in the very air, I
am often thus secretly checked in conscience for the same, as if the Lord
should on this wise speak unto me; Hos. 2.8, 9. Mal. 2.2.
Friend, who gave you leave and liberty to use these my benefits, or by what
right or title do you enjoy them, seeing you have by your disobedience
forfeited back again to me the true and lawful use I once gave you of them?
Deuteronomy. 28. from 15. to 20. Genesis 1.29, 30.
In whom now, or by whom may I recover the free, and so a comfortable use of
them again?

By none, but in, and by Christ, who being come a second Adam and the very
true, 1 Cor. 15.47.
and lawful heir of all things, Hab. 1.2. and 2.8.
has by the merit of his sufferings and obedience, Romans 5.19.
recovered unto thee (being once a member of his mystical body) a just right
and title as to God himself, Romans 8.16, 17.
Ioh. 20.17.
who is the Lord of all creatures, 1 Cor. 3.22 1 Timothy 4.4. Tit. 1.1^.
so a lawful and sanctified use of the creatures themselves: Read Hosea 2.
from verse. 18. to 23.

15 Wrath to come.
But it much astonisheth me, when I read what Isi. 30.27.28.
fearful attributes are given unto God; as that he is called a consuming
fire, Heb. 12.29.
Everlasting burnings, Isai. 33.14.
and that when fire is kindled in his wrath, it shall burn to the bottom of
hell, Deuteronomy. 32.22. Alas, if his wrath be kindled but a litile, Psalm. 2.12.
Psa. 76.7.
who shall fence me from it?

Heb. 5.7. Mat. 26.38
None but Christ, who not only saves and delivers thee from the wrath to
come, 1 The. 1.10.
Romans 5.9. but more then that, gives thee eternal life. Ioh. 10.20.


16 Deaths sting.
Yet death has a 1 Cor. 15.56.
deadly sting wherewith to stab me to the heart, which is sin; who shall
free me from deaths Reu. 21.8
deadly blow? Romans 6.23.

Re. 20 14.
None but Christ, in whom thou have not only conquest over sin and death, 1
Cor. 15.57
he having through death, Heb. 2.14.
destroyed him that had the power of death, which is the devil; bu^ has now
brought imm^^tality and life (for thee) to light by the Gospel. 2 Timothy 1.10


17 Unbelief.
Besides all this, my conscience conuinceth me of sin, Ioh. 16.8.9.
in that I believe not in Christ: Oh for one grain of that precious faith!
Luke 17.6.
that faith of of Gods elect; who shall work it in me?

None but Christ, who is therefore said to be both the Author and finisher Heb.
12.2.
of our faith. As also it is he by whom we believe in God, 1 Pet. 1.21.
who raised him from the dead.

18 Impenitency.
But I have an heart (the Lord knows) which cannot repent. Romans 2.5.
Who shall give me that repentance unto salvation, 2 Cor. 7.11.
never to be repented of?

None but Christ, for to this end has God exalted him a prince and a Savior,
Act. 5.31.
to give repentance to Israel, and forgiveness of sins. See 2 Timothy 2.25.

19 Hardness of heart.
Zach. 7.12.
Oh but I have an heart hard as the adamant stone: who can soften it?

None but Christ, Ezekiel. 11.19 and chap. 36.26.
in whom this faithful promise shall ever be yea, and Amen, namely, that God
will take away thy stony heart out of thy flesh, and in stead thereof will give
thee an heart of flesh. Soake thy heart thoroughly in this free and precious
promise, and expect the fruit with patience.

20 Infirmity.
Much corruption will cleave still even to my best actions: Romans 7.21.
In whom may I find the remedy of this?

1 Timothy 2.5 1 Ioh. 2.2.
In none but in Christ, who not only reconciles the iniquity even of thy holy
offerings, Exo. 28.38. Leu. 16.33.
but has (for thee) brought in also To make both thy person and Actions for
ever acceptable before God.
everlasting righteousness, Dan. 9.24. See 1 Cor. 1.30. 2 Cor. 5.21.

21 Doubtings.
But Ps. 88 15 Iam. 1.2.
new fears and doubtings through diverse temptations, arising through Job. 2.3.
Satan's malice, shall never be wanting Job 7.13.15.
daily to vex and Psalm. 42.5.11.
disquiet me: alas who shall support me under so manifold and different
trials?

None but Christ, who in that he suffered and Heb. 2.18. and 4.15.16. and ^.25.
was tempted, not only is able sufficiently to succor thee in all thy
temptations, Heb. 2.18. chapter 4.15.16
Psa. 34.19.
but in the end also to free thee out of them all, 2 Pet. 2.9.

22 Access.
Oftentimes when I pray, it seems that God shuts his Mercy-gate both against
me and my prayers; Lam. 3.8.
who shall give me access to the throne of Grace?

None but Christ thy only mediator, 1 Ioh. 2.2. 1 Timothy 2.5.
who by the veil of his flesh, having made thee a new and living way into the
holy place, Heb. 1^.19, 20.
sits at the right hand of God the Romans 8.34.
Father, Romans 8.24.
making request for thee, so as in stead of fearing to have free access; thou
may with reverence be bold to go to the Throne of grace, Heb 4.16.
with confidence to have all thy lawful suits granted, Heb. 10 19.
for thy Mediators sake, 1 Ioh. 5.14.
Ioh. 14.13.

23 Conscience.
But for all this, I yet feel secret griping of conscience, continually
affrighting me with a world of accusing thoughts: Romans 2.15
who now shall, be as able, so willingly, to appease and quiet them?

None but Christ, who being styled the Prince of Isai. 9.6.
peace, and therefore our peacemaker in heaven and in earth; Luke 19.38. and
2.14.
became first in his own person a preacher and publisher of peace both to them
that were affarre off: Act. 10.36.
Ephe. 2.13.14.
and to them that were near, yea and as if that had been to little; did at the
last by the blood of his Cross purchase for thee that peace of conscience
which passes all understanding, Col. 1.20.2
Act. 20.28.
of which that none might deprive or strip thee off: Ioh. 14.27 and 16.33.
Look into his last Will and Testament, where thou have this legacy by
himself bequeathed thee to have and to hold as thine own for ever. Therefore
now comfort thy self with these words.


Here the afflicted began a little to pause: and having received much
refreshing, and good satisfaction from those several answers which a good
conscience hitherto framed to his several demands and doubtings: ^ Pet. 3.21.
ceased from further obiectings: and began thus to be a little cheared and
revived.

Well, then I find and feel, to my no little joy, and contentment, that there
is None indeed but Christ (in heaven or earth) according as thou (O good
conscience have still affirmed) that can fully set me (a poor captive) free
from my fearful downfall and misery, Mat. 1.21. Psalm. 73.25.
1 Pet. 3.21
Luke 4.18. 1 Timothy 1.15.


And then, after some further pantings, and breathings (faith having put, as it
were, a new life into him) he brake forth into this passion, 2 Cor. 4.13.
of admiration and thankfulness.

And it is true indeed, O thou lover of men! Pro. 8.31. Job. 7.20.
O thou preserver of men! ^^b 7.20
that thou have set thine eyes, and thy heart upon such an one?

Job. 14.3. and 7.17.
Was thy love to me so ardent, and thy compassion so exceeding abundant, that
from thy seat of Majesty and glory, ^oh. 17.5. Pro. 8.22.
thou would for my sake, bow the heavens, yea, (after a sort) even thence,
Isai. 64.1.
break through (the fullness of time being come) in thine own person to visit
me; Gal. 4.4.
Luk 1.78.
and to expose thine holy self to shame, Isai 50.6. Luke 22.^4. Ioh. 19.34
and spitting, to sweating, blee^ing; and last of all to dying, that thou
might preserve such an one as I, from everlastingly perishing? Ioh. 3.14,
15. Lord, Psalm. 116.1.
that I knew what (by way way of thankfulness) now to render thee!

Thou far excellest above all the praise, Nehe. 9.5. Psalm. 106.2.
that a poor creature on earth can give thee. And yet, for as much as thou
have said, that who so offers thee praise, glorifieth thee. Psalm. 50.23


O let my poor soul, (which from deadly thrall thou have redeemed) magnify
thee. Luke 1.46, 47. Psalm. 103.5.


Let my spirit also (which by the savor of thy good oitnments thou have so
cheered and revived) rejoice, Cant. 1.2.
Isa. 61.10.
and always make her songs of thee. Let my tongue, mouth, Isai. 45.23.
and uncircumcised lips confess thee.

Sweetly (O Lord Jesus) have thou, Cant. 1.^.
with the kisses of thy mouth kissed me; therefore shall my knees ever be
bowed unto thee. Phil 2.9.10.


Psalm. 119.106. Tit. 2.14. Romans 12.1. 2 Cor. 7.1.
Yet I have sworn, and will also perform it, that my self, soul, body,
life, liberty, etc. and all, shall (thy grace assisting) be^ vowed and
consecrated to thy honor and glory, 1 Cor. 10.31. For thou Lord art holy, Isai.
57.15.
and inhabitest the eternity; and yet dwell with the contrite and humble
spirit, and with such an one as trembles at thy word. So as in me (sweet
Lord) is now fulfilled the saying that is written, the sacrifices of a contrite
spirit and a broken heart thou neither have nor never wilt despise. Psalm. 51.17.


Well may I now say, that thy name to me (a desolate wretch) has been as an
ointment poured out; Cant. 1.3.
and therefore has thy servant out of the abundance of his heart, found in his
heart; after this sort, 2 Samuel 7.27.
to express and pour forth the love and thankfulness of his soul, Luke
7.47.
unto thee.

To thee therefore O Father of mercies, and God of all comfort and consolation,
2 Cor. 1.3.
who have so loved me unworthy, Ioh. 3.16. and 1.18.
as out of thine own bosom to send thy only begotten Son, for me and all
mankind lost, into the world, Gal. 4.4.
made of a woman, that thus he might become our true and very Immanuel, Mat.
1.23.

And to thee O Lord Jesus Christ, Ioh. 10.18.
who voluntatily laidest down thy life for me to preserve me from eternal
death.

And to thee also O holy Spirit, by whose divine light my blind eyes have
been illuminated to see (as by the Law, Ephesians. 1.17, 18.
Romans 3.23. 1 Ioh. 3.1. Ephesians. 2.4. and 3.19.
my woeful misery) so comfortably by the Gospel, to behold this
superexcellent, and surpassing love and mercy of the Father, and the Son;
and thereto have wrought that wonderful grace of Faith in my heart, Romans 10.17
to believe that all this love is and has bin extended to me as well as to any
other, Gal. 2.20.
yea that it has bin by thee, O blessed Spirit shed abroad abundantly in my
heart, Romans 5.5.
and have so sealed me up to the day of redemption, that I shall not so
uncomfortably, Ephe. 1.13. and 4.30.
as formerly I have done, call into question the certainty and assurance of my
free adoption. Gal. 4.6.


To Father, Son, and holy Ghost (I say) one divine Essence, three distinct
persons, be ascribed in heaven and earth, by Angels and men, as is most due,
all wisdom. power, praise, and glory, eternally, Amen, and Amen.

A NECESSARY advertisement to the Reader.
AS it is an infallible truth, that neither a man's person, Gen 4.4. Rom 8.8.
Heb. 11.4. Ioh. 14.6.
nor actions, can please God, till himself be in Christ; so it is as true, 2
Cor. 3.5.
that a man has neither ability of himself to do good, or abstain from
evil aright, unless he be assisted by the power of Christ: and this
appears, both by the testimony of Christ himself, Ioh. 15.5. For without me^
ye can do nothing; (as also by the testimony of Paul, who says, that by the
power of Christ, he was able to do all things, Phil 4.13. Implying (according
to that place of John) that without Christ's power, Ioh. 15.5.
he could do nothing.

Does the power and strength of corruption then any way annoy thee, Romans 7.23.
and would thou feign get the masterie over the same? fly then forthwith
out of thy self, and get thee directly unto Christ, Romans 7.24, 25.
and say thus unto him; Lord, thou biddest me mortify al inordinate lusts and
affections, as wrath, Col. 3.5.
uncleanness, covetousness, etc. But thou know there is no strength in me to
mortify these, nor any corruption of nature besides, See 2 C^^. 20.12.
further forth than I have assistance from thee: Phil. 4.13. and 2.13. Romans
6.6.
apply therefore to this viciousness of my sinful nature, the virtue of thy
precious death and burial, by the work of thy holy spirit, Romans 8.13.
which alone is able to kill sin in me, that sin and corruption (of what
nature soever) may not as heretofore rule nor reign over me, Romans 6.12.
but that wageing battle still by thy strength ther-against, I may yet
therein have peace, 1 Ioh. 5.^.5
and expect the full victory, in the time thou have appointed.

Also, would thou hear, read, meditate, or pray profitably; think how
insufficient thou art, 2 Cor. 3.5.
as of thy self, to perform these holy exercises, or any the like, with out
Whose power, in this case, must be perfected in thy weakness, or it will not
be. 2 Cor. 12.9.
Christ; but hasten immediately to him, and say, It is meet (Lord) that I do
these duties at thy command, Isai. 55 3. Reu. 1.3. 1 The. 5.17
for in mercy thou have appointed them for my good: but without thee, Ioh. 15.5
thou know I can do nothing: Oh let me therefore feel power and virtue (by
the work of thy spirit) as from thy death to mortify and kill all sin in
me, Rom 6.5.6 Col. 2 12.
so from thy resurrection, both to quicken and enable me aright to perform
all such duties as thou requirest of me, that the power of effecting all good,
may always be of thee, and not from me, 2 Cor. 4.7.

And yet even in this regard thou requirest of me as in other things, that as
a poor frail vesssell I should put forth all the powers of body and soul,
Eccle. 9.10 2 Cor. 7.1. 2 Pet. 1.2.10. Mat. 25 14. 10 30.
wherewith thou have endowed me; the better hereby to serve thy divine
providence. Phil. 2.12, 13.

Now (good Reader) if thou approuest of this advertisement in thy judgment, I
pray thee give thy diligence to bring it by degrees but unto a daily practice
(for thou shall have need of it daily) and by goo^ experience, thou shall in
the end find, I hope, that the gain will counteruaile the pain. 1 Cor.
15.58. Gal. 6.9.


HEREUNTO IS added, three steps to sound conversion.
1
Act. 26.17.18.
FIrst, God by his word and spirit, enlighteneth the understanding of a sinner
truly to conceive the doctrine of man's misery, and of his full recovery by
Christ.

2
Secondly, by the same means he works in his heart both such sound sorrow for
his misery, and fervent desire after Christ the remedy, Act. 2.^7.
that he can never be at quiet, till he enjoy Christ.

3
Thirdly, GOD so manifests his love in freely offering Christ with all his
benefits, Ioh. 3.16.
unto him a poor sinner lost, that thereby he draws him in such wise to give
credit unto God herein, that he gladly accepts of Christ offered unto him.

These three works of God, whosoever finds to have bin truly wrought in
himself; may thereby know certainly, 1 Ioh. 5.10
that he has true faith, Act. 15.9.
and therefore sound conversion.

Now having obtained this mercy at the hands of Almighty God for the merit of
Christ; Col. 1.12. Ephesians. ^.5. Luke 1.74.
he ought in thankfulness to him therefore endeavor daily ever after, Tit.
2.11, 12.
in his whole conversation, to express and show forth the virtues of him that
has thus called him out of darkness, 2 Pet. 2.9.
into his marvelous light.

THE SECOND PART: CONTAINING A PASSIONATE Prayer to Christ: With his gracious
answer thereto.
ISAI. 65.24. Before they call, I will answer.


O Christ, who art my Lord, and my God: Ioh. 20.28.
thou who art the promised seed, Genesis 3.15. Genesis 22.18
in whom all the Nations of the earth should be blessed: Mich. 5.2
thou, whose goings forth have been of old from everlasting: Ier. 23.6.
Thou, who art called the Lord our righteousness, and Son of righteousness,
Mal. 4.2. and art worthily styled. Wonderful, Isai 9.6.
Counselor, The mighty God, the everlasting Father, the Prince of Peace. Thou
in whom the Father is well pleased: Mat. 3.17.
and in whom his soul delights: Isai. 42.1.
Thou who art the blessed, ^ Tim. 6.15.
and only Potentate, the King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, Thou who art the
Prince of life, Act. 3.15. 1 Cor 2.8.
and Lord of Glory: who art saved thy self, Zache. 9.9. and art mighty to
save. Isai. 63.1. O thou who, who art white and ruddie, Cant. 5.10.
the fairest among ten thousand: who art that Immanuel, even God with us, Isai.
7.14. who art given to me, Isai. 9.6.
were borne for me: who have loved me, Gal 1 20.
and given thy self for me. Oh when will thou draw me, Cant. 1.4.
that I may run after thee? When shall I see thee? Isai 64.1. Ioh. 14.23.
Oh when will thou come unto me; abide, Ver. 21.
and show thine own self unto me? When O good Christ, will thou give me an
heart to know thee? Ier. 24.17.
Oh that thou would once circumcise mine heart to love thee, Deuteronomy. 30.6.
that in love it might ever and in all things, 1 The. 5.18
be praising of thee! When shall I feel thee, Col. 3.11.
to be all in all unto me? my Husband, Hosea. 2.19. my Head, Ephesians. 5.23. my
Surety, Heb. 7.22. my Savior, Luke 1.47. my light, John 8.12. and my life?
Col. 3.4. Shall I never have an heart to believe in thee, To. 10.10.
and as to love, 2 Timothy 4.8.
so to look and long for thy blessed appearing? 2 Pet. 3.12. Col. 2.3.
In thee, Lord, are hid, all the treasures of wisdom, and knowledge. When
shall I feel thee to be to me, as thou art to all thine, 1 Cor. 1.30
my wisdom, righteousness, sanctification and redemption? It pleased the
Father, that in thee, Col. 1.19.
my Lord and my God, should all fullness dwell: Oh when will thou then, fill me
with all joy and peace in believing? Romans 15.13
Thou rellest me Lord, that all power is given thee in heaven and in earth.
Mat. 8.18.
Oh that thou then would give me such a powerful faith, 2 These. 1.11
as by deriuing and drawing virtue from thee, might be of power to purify my
heart to work by love, Act. 15.9. Gal. 5.6.
and to overcome the world, 1 Ioh. 5.4. When shall I feel thee my Lord and my
God; dwelling in my heart by faith? Ephesians. 3.17.
Then should I hate the evil and love the good. Amos 5.15.
Then should I fear thee for thy goodness, Hos. 3.5.
and sing aloud of thy righteousness. Psalm. 145.7.
Then should I not suffer sin so to reign in my mortal body, Romans 6.12.
that at any time I should obey it in the lusts thereof. Then should I lament,
that I can lament no more the self-love, diffidence, Ier. 31.18.
and impenitency, of my self-louing, unbelieving, Heb. 3.12.
and impenitent heart, Romans 2.5. Thou Lord have done, Isai. 26.12.
and yet do all my works in me, and for me. Give me then, Romans 8.26.
the spirit of Prayer, of power, of love, 2 Timothy 1.1.7
and of a sound mind: Even the Spirit of Adoption, Romans 8.15.
by which I may cry Father, Gal. 4 6. Ephe. 4.30.
and so be sealed up unto the day of redemption. Thy pure and precious blood, O
blessed Lord Jesus, once shed, has a justifying, Romans 5.9. a purifying, Heb.
9.14. and sanctifying virtue, Heb. 12.12. By the merit thereof then, 1 These.
^.10.
sweet Lord, do thou save me from the wrath to come. Through it purge my
conscience defiled, Heb. 9.4.
from dead works to serve thee the living and the True God: and through it, so
consecrate and set me apart as a vessel unto honor sanctified, 1 Timothy 2.21.
that it may be meet for thee my Lord and Masters use, as also ready and
prepared unto every good work. Tit: 3.1.
Give me to be wise unto that which is good, Romans 16.19
and simple concerning evil. 1 Cor. 14.20.
In malice give me to be child-like; but in understanding to be of a ripe age.
And now, my Lord and my God, Isai. 66 8.
who is like unto thee forgiving iniquity, transgression, and sin, Exodus
34.7. And therefore my soul pants after thee; Psalm. 42.2.
my soul thirsts for thee: and 63 1.
and flesh longs for thee in a dry and thirsty la^d, where no water is. Psalm.
101.2 Psalm. 73.25.
Oh when, when will thou come unto me? I have none in heaven but thee, and
there is none upon earth that I desire besides thee. Psalm. 13.1.
Will thou, O Lord, forget me for ever? And will thou hence forth show me no
more favor? Psalm. 77.7.
Psalm. 89.47
Oh remember how short my time is. Thou will at length, I know, return and
revive me; Psalm. 71.20
thou will come again, Psalm. 138.7.
and bring me from the depth of the earth. O Lamb of God, Ioh. 1.29. Son of
God, Ioh. 3. 18. O my Mercy seat, Exodus 25.17. my Mediator, 1 Timothy 2.5. and
Advocate, 1 Ioh. 2.1. When shall I with the residue of thy lovers, possess and
enjoy thee? How long, Lord, shall it be, before with thine elected and
betrothed Spouse I shall be able to say, 1 Pet. 2.^. Hos. 2.^9.
that thou my beloved art mine, and I thine. Cant. ^^.^.
Then, then should thou as a bundle of sweet smelling Myrrh, Cant. 1.13
lie even all the night long between my breasts, and dwell between my shoulders,
Deuteronom. 32.12. Thou came into the world, 1 Timothy 1.15
Lord, to save sinners: And wilt not thou save me? 1 Ioh. 3.5.
Thou wast made manifest, that thou might take away sins: And wilt not thou,
O Lamb of God, take away mine? Thou were manifest to that end, 1 John 3.8.
that thou might destroy the works of the Devil: And wilt not thou Lord,
now destroy all his works in me? Thou did in the days of thy flesh once
suffer for sins, 1 Pet. 3.18
that thou might bring mankind lost unto God: And wilt not thou, my dear
Christ, bring me now to thy heavenly Father washed, Reu. 1.5. justified, Romans
5.1. reconciled, 1 Ioh. 4.10. sanctified, 1 Corinthians. 6.11. and eternally saved?
Heb. 5.9. Yes, Lord, I believe it. Mar. 9.24.
But Lord help thou mine unbelief. I read in the Evangelists how often thy
compassions were moved, Mat. 9.30.14.14. and 15.32. Mar. 1.41. and 5.19. Luke
7.13.
over the miseries of men and women. Are they not the same now, they were then?
Had thou compassions for them, and have thou none for me? was thy soul
troubled for them, Ioh. 12.27.
and not likewise for me? was thy so^^ exceeding sorrowful (...) to death for
them, Mar. 14.34 Mat. 4.5.
and wa^ it not so for me? Did thou fast, Luke 21 4^ Heb. ^5.7.
swear, weep, cry, and pray? and were not all these thy p^ssio^ for me? Oh
thou that a^^ holy, harmless, undefiled, Heb. 7.25, 26.
separate from sinners, and made highe^ then the heavens; who art able to save
to the uttermost all them that come unto God by thee how long, oh how long
shall it be, yer I feel and find in my self the virtue and efficacy (from
the throne of grace) of Heb. 4.14, 15, 16.
thine intercess on for me! Which though for the present, I believe not as I
should, yet Lord, give me to believe it when thou will. Psalm. 34 5.
Who ever trusted in thee, and was ashamed? Psalm. 22.5.
who ever hoped in thee, and was confounded?

No, no, Psalm. 22.3.
thou inhabitest the praises of Israel. It is thou, Lord, Psalm. 65.2.
that hear prayer, unto thee therefore shall all flesh come. Did not
thou, my Lord and my God, in the days of thy flesh, testify, that if thou
were lifted up from the earth, Ioh. 12.32, 33
thou would draw a^ men unto thee. Oh cause the coards and bands of this thy
infinite and surpassing love in dying for me, Hos. 11.4.
effectually to draw my whole soul and affections unto thee. Oh when shall I be
with thee where thou art, Ioh. 17.24.
that I man see that thy glory. In the mean while, Cant. 2.5, 6
O my dear heavenly husband, stay me with flagons, comfort me with apples,
for I am sick of love. Le^ thy left hand be under my head, and let thy right
hand embrace me: Cant. 1.3.
kiss thou me, O my Christ, with the kisses of my mouth, for thy loves are
better then wine.

1 CHRIST his gracious Answer.
Pro. 8.17.
I Love them that love me, and those that seek me early, shall find: whosoever
finds me, Verse. 35.
finds life, and shall obtain favor of the Lord. Be of good cheer then,
thou fainting soul, for I have heard thee, Hos. 14.8.
and observed thee. And though I be the high and lofty one, Isai. 57.15.
that inhabiteth the eternity, whose Name is Holy, dwelling in the high and
holy place, yet do I also dwell with them that are of a contrite and humble
spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the
contrite ones. Isai. 30.1^
I will be gracious unto thee at the voice of thy cry, I have heard thee, and
will answer thee. Because thou have set thy love upon me, Psalm. 98.14.
therefore I will deliver thee, I will set thee on high, because thou have
known my Name. Yea, he that loves me, Ioh. 14.21.
shall be also loved of my Father, and I, according to thy request, will
manifest mine own self unto thee: very meet it is that all men should honor
the Son, Isai. 49.14.
even as they honor the Father; for he that honors not the Son,
honors not the Faeher which sent him, John 5.23. And though to thy seeming,
thou art now and then neglected of me; yet can I not forget thee ouer-long,
Isai. 54.7.
it is but for a moment; for, for a small moment have I forsaken thee, but with
everlasting compassions will I have mercy upon thee, says the Lord thy
Redeemer. Psalm. 84.11.
I will be both Sun and shield unto thee, I will give grace and glory; nor
shall any good thing at any time be wanting at all unto thee: 1 Pet. 1.13.
only hope to the end, for that grace which is brought unto thee. Humble thy
self daily to walk in all the exercises of piety and true charity. Mich. 6.8.
Take up the cross cheerfully which I shall (it may be) daily lay upon thee.
Luke 9.13.
And when thou art ready to sink, come unto me: Mat. 14.30.
For I will assure thee on my faith full word, they shall not for ever be
ashamed, Is^i. 49 ^4.
who have the grace to wait for me. Cast not away then thy confidence which
has promise of great reward. Heb. 10.35.
Poor soul, wherefore did thou doubt? Mat. 14.31.
But I see thou have need of patience, Heb. 10.36
that after thou have endeavored to do my will here on earth, thou might
receive the promise. Luke 21.2.
By patience therefore possess thy soul. I will stand by thee, I will neither
leave thee, nor forsake thee, Hebrews 13.5. Thou art as dear unto me, Zech.
2.8.
as the apple of mine eye. Thou shall be covered in the shadow of mine hand.
Mine Angels shall attend thee, Psalm. 91.11. Isai. 51.16.
my grace shall be sufficient for thee, my presence shall go with thee, Exo.
33.14
neither shall my Spirit nor Word depart away from thee, Isaiah 59.21. When
thou art tempted, I will succor thee, Hebrew. 2.18. Isai. 40.29.
when thou faintest, I will sustain thee. If thou offend against my heavenly
Father, 1 Ioh. 2.1. Romans 8.34.
the merit of my satisfaction, and intercession shall evermore plead thy cause
at the throne of grace for thee. I am returned unto thee, Zech. 8.3. I will no
more be terrible unto thee, Ier. 17.17. Isai. 57.16.
for so the Spirit should fail before me, and the soul which I have made.
Wherefore comfort thy self with these words: 1 These 4.19.
Go eat thy bread with joy, and drink thy wine with a merry heart, Eccles. 9.7
for God now accepts thy works. Nor shall it be long yer thou (with the
residue of those who love and long for my appearing) enter into thy Masters
joy, Mat. 25.21.
where is fullness of joy, and life for evermore. So says Amen, Reu. 3 14.
the faithful and true witness, Amen and Amen.

PSALM. 94.12. Blessed is the man whom thou chastisest. O Lord, and teach him
in thy Law.

LONDON Printed by Io. Beale for Na. Newbery, and are to be sold at the Star in
Popes head Alley. 1629.

To the Christian Reader.
THe hand of the Lord has been long stretched out against us in this City, by
sending sundry sorts of diseases and sicknesses amongst us, where of my self
of late have had some experience. To ma^y, these have proved mortal and
deadly: and this it is that has moved me to pen these few lines following. I
grant they are appropriated especiall^ to the person of the sick* yet so, that
the whole should not be excluded from reaping benefit thereby, which if by Gods
grace they attain; th^n have I the end of my labor. And so I ever rest,

Thy faithful welwiller in Christ, C. C.

The Sick Man's A B C.
Q. WHat art thou by nature?

A. Oh Sir, a Romans 5 12
sinner, a Psalm. 51.5
sinner; a Job 40.4.
vile and an abominable sinner, Job 1^.6.

Q The soul that sins, must Ezekiel. 18.20.
die. Thou know there is no escaping for thee.

A. I will not hide my sin as Job 31.33
Adam did, but with David I will Psalm. 32.5.
confess it; and with Job, I will repent in dust and ashes for it. Job 42.6.


Q. Say thou do so, thou art not ignorant, that sin and death will still be
dogging of thee at the heels?

A. I do not greatly fear what sin and death can do against me. Heb. 2.14,
15.


Q. Why, I pray thee?

A. Because I have to deal with a gracious God.

Q. Who told thee that?

Exodus 34.6
A. Even his own self.

Q. He is also a devouring fire. Isai. 33.14.


Heb. 10 27
A. He is so, but it is to his enemies, and to them that perish.

Q. May thou not also perish?

A No, I cannot believe it.

Q. Wherefore?

A. Because Jesus Christ by his blood, has Romans 3.25.
pacified Gods anger toward me.

Q. How could the blood of Christ effect it?

A. Because he was Act. 20 2^
God that shed it.

Q. But he shed it not for thee?

A. Oh, yes, yes. 1 Timothy 1.15


Q. Why for thee?

A. Because Sir, I do from the very heart root, Psa. 51.2 Luke 18.13.
long after the saving and healing virtue of it, Ephesians. 1.7. 1 John 1.7.

Luke 8.13.
Q. Possible this thy longing will not be lasting?

A. Yes, by Gods grace, Phil. 3.12.
whilst I have any breathing.

Q. Well, I must needs thus far (for thy comfort) yield unto thee, that
Christ, by his death, has given sin and death their doom; so as resting
upon that thou have professed, they cannot hurt thee. But yet thou art not
restored (for all that) into Gods favor, wherein alone consists life, and
true happiness, Psalm. 30.5.

A. I expect and look for that, only by his 2 Cor. 5.21. Romans 8.33. and 10.4.
imputing unto me, Christ's perfect righteousness.

Q. Thou talkest of great matters; had thou faith to believe it?

A. Mar. 9.2^
I believe: Now, Lord, help my unbelief.

Q. I blame thee not in seeking thy Justification from Christ but may not an
hypocrite do this as well as thou?

A. I do from my soul, as earnestly long to have him made unto me, 1 Cor.
1.30.
Sanctification also. See Psalm. 51.10.

Q. How expectest thou sanctification from Christ?

A. By the work of his Spirit, 1 Cor. 6.11.

Q. How does the Spirit effect it?

A. By applying unto my whole man, the power of his death and resurrection,
Romans 6.5, 6. by the one killing by degrees all sin in me; Col. 2.11, 12, 13.
by the other, quickening me unto new obedience.

Q. It seems then, thou not only beleeuest, that Christ will save thee from
the guilt and condemnation of sin, but will also Tit. 2.14.
deliver thee from the power and bondage of sin.

A. That is my belief indeed, 1 Pet. 2.9.

Q. Thou beleeuest truly: for what God has coupled together, that ought no man
to put asunder, 1 Cor. 1.30. But could thou not be content only to have
sanctification in thy tongue, that thou might be able freely to talk of
religion? 1 John 3.18.

A. No, not so: let it be 1 These. 5.23.
thorowout, or not at all, 2 Cor. 7.1. 1 Cor. 6.20.

Q. Sanctification is a long way to walk in, many difficulties accompanying
it. Romans 7.
May not the tediousness of the way cause thee in the end to break off thy
course, and finally to give it over?

A. I confess, I find in my self but too much weakness this way; yet my
sure hope is, that he who has begun a good work in me, 1 These. 5.23, 24.
will not now leave it unperfected, Phil. 1.6.

Q. Some having made a long progress in profession, have grown at the length
to loath those 2 Timothy 4.10.
means of salvation, which once they seemed to love; and so have separated the
means from the end.

A. But God by his Word and Spirit, Psalm 8.4.1, 2.3, 4.
has taught me otherwise, Psalm 27.4. that is, not to expect for Salvation
from Him, as the end; without a constant endeavoring to use all those helps,
Psalm. 26.8. 2 Pet. ^.5. and verse 10.
which he has sanctified, to lead me thereunto.

Q. I am glad it has been my hap, to hear these good things from thee; I wish
thee therefore to be of good comfort in the Lord: for, for ought I yet see,
thou art in the way to be saved. Only a word or two, concerning thy present
condition. How take thou this thy visitation?

A. I take it as sent unto me, from the hand of a very gracious and loving
Father. Heb. 12.5.


Q. But commonly calamities in this kind, are tokens of Gods displeasure, Lam.
3.39.
Leuit. 26.15.

A. In themselves they are so, lighting upon the wicked: but I believe they are
sent unto me in favor, and for my good.

Q. What is the ground of this thy persuasion?

A. Only the Romans 8.18.
word of truth, which assures my conscience through the holy Ghost that it is
so, Reu. 3.19.
Heb. 12.5, 6.

Q. And yet it may be long, Psalm. 13.1, 2.
ere God send deliverance.

A. Be it so, Psalm. 62.1, 5.
yet I have determined, that my soul shall wait on God, in hope and silence,
till his appointed time come: yea, so I may come better out of this affliction,
than I went into it, Job 23.10. Isai. 28.16.
I shall not much hasten to be freed out of it.

Psalm. 86.17
Q. But if God should show a token of his goodness upon thee, and presently
turn thy sickness into health?

A. If he should do so, my greatest fear is, lest I should prove unthankful,
2 Chronicles. 32.25.

Q. On the other side, what if this sickness should be unto death, that is, to
the separating of the soul from the body?

A Psalm. 23.4
Though I should walk through the valley of the shadow of death, yet would I
fear none evil: See Revel. 14.13.

Q. Do thou not apprehend the Grave (into which thou must descend) to be an
Ps. 49.14
yrkesome and loathsome prison?

A. Yes, considered out of Christ: The grave (says one) shall not grieve me,
because it was my Lords bed. Mr. H.S. Pr.
but looking upon it through his burial (whereby he has perfumed it for me)
it shall be much sweeter to me, than a bed of Roses, Isai. 57.1, 2.

Q. Thy flesh, it may be, shall lie rotting a long time in the grave?

A. And yet, even there shall my flesh Ps^. 16.
rest in hope.

Q. Thy dead bones (seeming to be neglected of God, and therefore neglected of
men) must (as thou know) be regardlesly tumbled hither and thither, Psalm.
141.7.
as if they were no better than unprofitable rubbish?

Psa. 139.14 15, 16.
A. My God that kept a register of them, before they were, will much more be
careful of them, Psalm. 34.20. Job 19 26, 27.
now they are, so that at the last day, not the smallest shankbone, or piece of
a shiuer thereof, no not the least pick of dust shall be wanting, Ezech. 37.7.

Q. What think thou shall become of thy dead body in the end?

A. My Lord Jesus Christ (who is the resurrection Ioh. 11.25.
and the life) will (according to his faithful word) raise it up at the last
day, John 6.54.

Q. Shall thy dead body then be only raised up at the last day. See Mat. 27,
52, 53. Act. 3.21. See Beza Ser. upon Mat. 27.52, 53.


A. No, I verily believe, that though this body be turned into dust, yet it
shall be reunited again to this soul, which now inhabiteth in it.

Q. And shall this be all? Job 19.27.


A Not so: for being thus really united by the unspeakable power of God, Romans
8.23.
1 Ioh. 3.2. Col. 3.3, 4.
I shall see Christ coming in the clouds for my full redemption out of all
miseries, and woe; and no sooner shall I get a sight of him, but I shall
forthwith be changed in a moment, 1 Cor. 15.52.
and in the twinkling of an eye; after which, being (with the rest of the
Saints) caught up in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air, 1 The. 4.17
I shall thenceforth be ever with the Lord, in whose presence is the fullness
of joy, Psalm. 16.11.
and at whose right hand are pleasures for evermore.

Conclusion.
Be it unto thee as thou have said: and seeing we look for such things as
these, 1 Ioh. 3.3.
the Lord give thee and me grace to be diligent, 2 Pet. 3.14.
that we may be found of him in peace, without spot, and blameless before him
at his coming, Amen, Amen.
