To the Courteous Reader.
COurteous, Kind, and indifferent Readers, whose willingness to read and
hear this following discourse, does explain to the world your hearty
affection, to the prosecuting and furtherance of so worthy an action: so it is,
that like to an unskillful actor, who having by misconstruction of his right
Cue, ouer-slipt himself, in beginning of a contrary part, and fearing the
hateful hiss of the captious multitude, with a modest blush retires himself
in private; as doubting the reprehension of his whole audience in public, and
yet again upon further deliberation, thinking it better to know their censures
at the first, and upon submission to reap pardon, then by seeking to smother
it, to incur the danger of a secret scandal: Imboldening himself upon the
courteous kindness of the best, and not greatly respecting the worst, comes
fourth again, makes an Apollogie for himself, shows the cause of his error,
craves pardon for his rashness, and in fine, receives a general applauditie of
the whole assembly: so I gentle Readers, happening upon this relation by
chance (as I take it, at the second or third hand) induced thereunto by diverse
well willers of the action, and none wishing better toward it then my self,
so far forth as my poor ability can or may stretch too, I thought good to
publish it: but the Author being absent from the press, it cannot be doubted
but that some faults have escaped in the printing, especially in the names of
Countries, Towns, and People, which are somewhat strange unto us: but most of
all, and which is the chief error, (for want of knowledge of the Writer) some
of the books were printed under the name of Thomas Watson, by whose occasion I
know not, unless it were the over rashness, or mistaking of the workmen, but
since having learned that the said discourse was written by Captain Smith,
who is one of the Counsel there in Virginia: I thought good to make the like
Apollogie, by showing the true Author so far as my self could learn, not
doubting, but that the wise noting it as an error of ignorance, will pass it
over with patience, and if worthy an applauditie, to reserve it to the Author,
whose pains in my judgment deserves commendations; somewhat more was by him
written, which being as I thought (fit to be private) I would not adventure to
make it public what more may be expected concerning the situation of the
Country, the nature, of the clime, number of our people there resident, the
manner of their government, and living, the commodities to be produced, and the
end and effect it maycome too, I can say nothing more then is here written,
only what I have learned and gathered from the general consent of all (that I
have conuersed withal) as well mariners as others, which have had imployme^t
that way; is that the Country is ex^celle^t and pleasant, the clime temperate
and healthful, the ground fertile and good, the commodities to be expected (if
well followed) many, for our people, the worst being already past, these former
having endured the heat of the day, whereby those that shall succeed, may at
ease labor for their profit, in the most sweet, cool, and temperate shade:
the action most honorable, and the end to the high glory of God, to the
erecting of true religion among Infidells, to the overthrow of superstition and
idolatry, to the winning of many thousands of wandering sheep, unto Christ's
fold, who now, and till now, have strayed in the unknown paths of Paganism,
Idolatry, and susperstition: yea, I say the Action being well followed, as by
the grave Senators, and worthy aduenturors, it has been worthily begun:
will tend to the everlasting renown of our Nation, and to the exceeding good
and benefit of our Weal public in general: whose Counsels, labors, godly
and industrious endeavors, I beseech the mighty Jehovah to bless, prosper,
and further, with his heavenly aid, and holy assistance.

Farewell. I. H.

A True relation of such occurrences and accidents of note, as has happened in
Virginia, since the first planting of that Collony, which is now resident in
the South part thereof, till the last return.
Kind Sir, commendations remembered, etc. You shall understand that after many
crosses in the downs by tempests we arrived safely upon the Southwest part
of the great Canaries: within four or five days after we set sail for
Dominica, the 26. of April: the first land we made, we fell with Cape Henry,
the very mouth of the Bay of Chissiapiacke, which at that present we little
expected, having by a cruel storm been put to the Northward: anchoring in
this Bay twenty or thirty went a shore with the Captain* and in coming
aboard, they were assalted with certain Indians, which charged them within
Pistol shot: in which conflict, Captain Archer and Matthew Morton were shot:
whereupon, Captain Newport seconding them, made a shot at them, which the
Indians little respected, but having spent their arrows retired without harm
and in that place was the Bar opened, wherein the Counsel for Virginia was
nonnnated: and arriving at the place where we are now seated, the Counsel was
sworn, the President elected, which for that year was Master Edm. Maria
Wingfield, where was made choice for our situation, a very fit place for the
erecting of a great city, about which some contention passed betwixt Captain
Wingfield and Captain Gosnold, not-withstanding all out provision was brought
a shore, and with as much speed as might be we went about our fortification.

The two and twenty day of April, Captain Newport and my self with diverse
others, to the number of twenty two persons, set forward to discover the River,
some fifty or sixty miles, finding it in some places broader, and in some
narrower, the Country (for the most part) on each side plain high ground,
with many fresh Springes, the people in all places kindly entreating us,
daunsing and feasting us with strawberries, Mulberies, Bread, Fish, and other
their Country provisions whereof we had plenty: for which Captain Newport
kindly requited their least favors with Bells Pinnes, Needles, beads or
Glasses, which so contented them that his liberallitie made them follow us from
place to place, and ever kindly to respect us. In the midway staying to
refresh our selves in a little I Will four or five savages came unto us which
described unto us the course of the River, and after in our journey, they often
met us, trading with us for such provision as we had, and ariuing at
Ar^atecke, he whom we supposed to be the chief King of all the rest, most
kindly entertained us, giving us in a guide to go with us up the River to
Powhatan, of which place their great Emperor takes his name, where he that
they honored for King used us kindly. But to finish this discovery, we passed
on further, where within an i will we were interrepted with great craggy stones yt
in midst of the river, where the water falls so rudely, and with such a
violence, as not any boat can possibly pass, and so broad disperseth the
stream, as there is not past flue or sire Foot at a low water, and to the
shore scarce passage with a barge, the water flows four foot, and the
freshes by reason of the Rocks have left marks of the inundations 8. or 9.
foot: The sooth side is plain low ground, and the north side high mountains,
the rocks being of a grauelly nature, interlace^ with many vains of glistring
spangles That night we returned to Powhatan: the next day (being Whitsunday
after dinner) we returned to the false, leaving a mariner in pawn with the
Indians for a guide of theirs, he that they honored for King followed us by
the river. That afternoon we trifled in looking upon the Rocks and river
(further he would not go) so there we erected acrosse, and that night taking
our man at Powhatans, Cap. Newport congratulated his kindenes with a Gown and a
Hatchet: returning to Arsetecke, and stayed there the next day to observe the
height thereof, and so with many slgnes of love we departed. The next day the
Queen of Agamatack kindly entreated us, her people being no less contented
then the rest, and from thence we went to another place, (the name whereof I
do not remember) where the people showed us the manner of their diuing for
Mussels, in which they find Pearls.

That night passing by Weanock some twenty miles from our Fort, they according
to their former churlish condition, seemed little to affect us, but as we
departed and lodged at the point of Weanocke, the people the next morning
seemed kindly to content us, yet we might perceive many signs of a more
Jealousy in them then before, and also the Hind that the King of Arseteck had
given us, altered his resolution in going to our Fort, and with many kind
circumstances left us there. This gave us some occasion to doubt some mischief
at the Fort, yet Capt. Newport intended to have visited Paspahegh and
Tappahanocke, but the instant change of the wind being fair for our return,
we repaired to the fort withal speed, where the first we heard was that 400.
Indians the day before had assalted the fort, and supprised it, had not God
(beyond al their expectations) by means of the ships at whom they shot with
their Ordinances and Muskets, caused them to retire, they had entered the fort
with our own men, which were then busied in setting Corn, their arms being
then in driesats and few ready but certain Gentlemen of their own, in which
conflict, most of the Counsel was hurt, a boy slain in the Pinnas, and
thirteen or fourteen more hurt Withal speed we pallisadeed our Fort: (each
other day) for six or seven days we had alarums by ambuscadoes, and four or
five cruelly wounded by being abroad: the Indians loss we know not, but as
they report three were slain and diverse hurt.

Captain Newport having set things in order, set sail for England the 22 of
June, leaving provision for 13. or 14 weeks. The day before the Ships
departure, the King of Pamaun^e sent the Indian that had met us before in our
discovery, to assure us peace, our fort being then palisadoed round, and all
our men in good health and comfort, albeit, that through some discentented
humors, it did not so long continue, for the President and Captain Gosnold,
with the rest of the Counsel, being for the most part discontented with one
another in so much, that things were neither carried with that discretion nor
any business effected in such good sort as wisdom would, nor our own good and
safety required thereby, and through the hard dealing of our President, the
rest of the counsel being diversely affected through his audarious command,
and for Captain Martin, (albeit very honest) and wishing the best good, yet
so sick and weak, and my self so disgraced through others malice, through
which disorder God (being angry with us) plagued us with such famine and
sickness, that the living were scarce able so bury the dead: our want of
sufficient and good victuals, with continual watching, four or five each
night at three Bulwarks, being the chief cause: only of Sturgion we had
great store, whereon our men would so greedily surfeit, as it cost many their
lives: the Sack, Aquauitie, and other preservatives for our health, being kept
only in the Presidents hands, for his own diet, and his few associates:
shortly after Captain Gosnold fell sick, and within three weeks died,
Captain Ratcliffe being then also very sick and weak, and my self having
also tasted of the extremity thereof, but by Gods assistance being well
recovered. Kendall about this time, for diverse reasons deposed from being of
the Council: and shortly after it pleased God (in our extremity) to move the
Indians to bring us Corn, ere it was half ripe, to refresh us, when we rather
expected when they would destroy us: about the tenth of September there was
about 46. of our men dead, at which time Captain Wingefield having ordered the
affairs in such sort that he was generally hated of all, in which respect with
one consent he was deposed from his presidencie, and Captain Ratcliffe
according to his course was elected.

Our provision being now within twenty days spent, the Indians brought us
great store both of Corn and bread ready made: and also there came such
abundance of Fowls into the Rivers as greatly refreshed our weak estates,
whereupon many of our weak men were presently able to go abroad. As yet we
had no houses to cover us, our Tents were rotten, and our Cabbins worse then
naught: our best commodity was Iron which we made into little chissels, the
president, and Captain Martins sickness, constrained me to be Cape Merchant,
and yet to spare no pains in making houses for the company, who
notwithstanding our misery, little ceased their malice, grudging and
mattering. As at this time were most of our chiefest men either sick or
discontented, the rest being in such despair, as they would rather starve and
rot with idleness, then be persuaded to do any thing for their own relief
without constraint: our victualles being now within eighteen days spent, and
the Indians trade decreasing, I was sent to the mouth of y^ river, to
Kegquouhtan an Indian Town, to trade for Corn, and try the river for Fish,
but our fishing we could not effect by reason of the stormy weather. The
Indians thinking us near famished, with careless kindness, offered us little
pieces of bread, and small handfulls of beans or wheat, for a hatchet or a
piece of copper: In the like manner I entertained their kindness, and in like
scorn offered them like commodities, but the Children, or any that showed
extraordinary kindenes, I liberally contented with free gift, such trifles as
well contented them* finding this co^^e comfort, I anchored before the Town,
and the next day returned to trade, but God (the absolute disposer of all
hearts) altered their conceits, for now they were no less desirous of cut
commodities then we of their Corn: under color to fetch fresh water, I sent a
man to discover the Town, their Corn, and force, to try their intent, in
that they desired me up to their houses: which well understanding, with four
shot I visited them, with fish, oysters, bread and dear, they kindly trades
with me and my men, being no less in doubt of my intent, then I of theirs,
for well I might with twenty men have fraighted a Ship with Corn: The Town
contains eighteen houses, pleasantly seated upon three acres of ground,
upon a plain, half environed with a great Bay of the great River, the other
part with a Baye of the other River falling into the great Baye, with a little
I Will fit for a Castle in the mouth thereof, the Town adjoining to the mains by
a neck of Land of sixty yardes. With sixteen bushells of Corn I returned
toward our Forte: by the way I encountered with two Canowes of Indians, who
came ab^ord me, being the inhabitants of waroskoyack, a kingdom on the south
side of the river, which is in breadth 5. miles and 20 mile or near from the
mouth: with these I traded, who having but their hunting provision, requested
me to return to their Town, where I should load my boat with corn, and with
near thirty bushells I returned to the fort, the very name whereof gave great
comfort to our desparing company: time thus passing away, and having not above
14. days vituals left, some motions were made about our presidents and Capt.
Archeri going for England, to procure a supply, in which mean time we had
reasonablly fitted us with houses, and our President and Capt. Martin being
able to walk abroad, with much ado do it was concluded, that the pinnace and
barge should go toward Powhatan, to trade for corn: Letts were cast who
should go in her, the chance was mine, and while she was arigging. I made a
voyage to Topohanack, where ariuing, there was but certain women and children
who fled from their houses, yet at last I drew them to draw near, truck they
durst not, corn they had plenty, and to spoil I had no commission: In my
resume to Paspahegh, I traded with that churlish and treacherous nation: having
loaded 10 or 12 bushels of corn, they offered to take our pieces and swords,
yet by stelth, but seeming to dislike it, they were ready to assault us, yet
standing upon our guard in coasting the shore, diverse out of the woods would
meet with us with corn and trade, but least we should be constrained, either to
endure overmuch wrong or directly fall to revenge, seeing them dog us, from
place to place, it being night, and our necessity not fit for wars, we took
occasion to return with 10 bushells of corn: Cap. Martin after made 2
iournies to that nation of Paspahegh but each tune returned with 8. or 10.
bushells. All things being now ready for my journey to Powhatan, for the
performance thereof, I had 8. men and my self for the barge, as well for
discovery, as trading, the Pinnace, 5. Mariners, and 2. landmen to take in
out ladings at convenient places. The 9 of November I set forward for the
discovery of the country of Chikhamania, leaving the pinnace the next tide to
follow and stay for my coming at Point weanock, 20 miles from our fort: the
mouth of this river falls into the great river at Paspahegh, 8 miles above
our fort: that afternoon I stayed the eb, in the bay of Paspahegh with the
India^s: toward the evening certain Indians haled me, one of them being of
Chikahamania, offered to conduct me to his country, the Paspabegheans grudged
thereat: along we went by moonelight, at midnight he brought us before his
Town, desiring one of our men to go up with him, whom he kindly entertained,
and returned back to the barge: the next morning I went up to the town, and
showed them what copper and hatchets they should have for corn, each family
seeking to give me most content: so long they caused me to stay yt 100 at least
was expecting my coming by the river with corn, what I liked I bought, and
least they should perceive my too great want I went higher up the river: this
place is called Manosquosick a quarter of a mile from the river, containing
thirty or forty houses, upon an exceeding high land: at the foot of the
hill toward the river, is a plain wood, watered with many springes, which
fall twenty yardes right down into the river: right against yt same is a
great marsh, of 4. or 5. miles circuit, divided in 2 Islands, by the parting of
the river, abounding with fish and fouls all sorts a mile from thence is a
Town called Oraniocke, I further discovered the Towns of M^nsa, Apahaock,
Werawahone, and Mamanahu^t at each place kindly used, especially at the last,
being the heart of the Country, where were assembled 200. people with such
abou^da^ce of corn, as having laded our barge, as also I might have laded a
ship: I returned to Paspahhegh, and considering yt want of Corn at our Fort,
it being night, with yt ebb, by midnight I arrived at our fort, where I found
our Pinnis run aground: the next morning I vnladed seaue^ hogsheds into our
store, the next morning I returned again: the second day I arrived at
Mamanahu^t, where y^ people having heard of my coming, were ready with 3 or
400. baskets little and great, of which having laded my barge, with many signs
of great kindness I returned: at my departure they requested me to hear our
pieces, being in the midst of the river, which in regard of y^ echo seemed a
peale of ordnance, many birds and fowls they see us daily kill that much feared
them, so desirous of trade were they, yt they would follow me with their
canowes, and for any thing give it me, rather then return it back: so I
vnladed again 7 or 8. hogsheads at our fort. Having thus by Gods assistance
gotten good store of corn, notwithstanding some bad spirrits not content with
Gods providence, still grew ^^^tinous, in so much, that our president having
ocasion to chide the s^ith for his misdeamenor, he not only gave him bad
language, but also offered to strike him with some of his tools, for which
rebellious act, the smith was by a Jury condemned to be hanged, but being upon
the ladder continuing verry obstinate, as hoping upon a rescue: when he saw no
other way but death with him, he became penitent, and declared a dangerous
conspiracy, for which Captains Kendall as principal, was by a Jury conde^^ed
and shot to death. This conspiracy appeased, I set forward for the discovery of
the River of Checka Hamania: this third time I discovered y^ Towns of
Matapamient, Morinogh, Ascacap, moysenock Righkahauck, Nechanichock, Mattalu^t,
Attamuspincke, and diverse others, their plenty of corn I found decreased, yet
lading the barge, I returned to our fort: our store being now indifferently well
provided with corn, there was much ado for to have the pinace go for
England, against which Captain Martin and my self, standing chiefly against
it, and in fine after many debatings, pro and contra, it was reolued to stay a
^urther resolution: this matter also quieted, I set forward to finish this
discovery, which as yet I had neglected in regard of y^ necessity we had to
take in provision whilst it was to be had: 4^. miles I passed up yt river,
which for the most part is a quarter of a mile broad, and 3. fatham and a half
deep, exceeding vsey, many great low marshes, and many high lands, especially
about yt midst at a place called Moysonicke, a Peninsule of 4. miles cicuit,
betwixt two rivers joined to the main, by a neck of 40. or 50. yards, and 40.
or 50 yards from the high water mark: on both sides in the very neck of the
maine, are high hills and dales, yet much inhabited, the I Will declining in a
plain fertile corn^ field, the lower end a low marsh, more plenty of swannes,
cranes, geese, duckes, and mallards, and diverse sorts of fowls none would
desire: more plain fertile planted ground, in such great proportions as there
I had not seen, of a light black sandy mould, the cliffes commonly red, white
and yellowe colored sand, and under red and white clay, fish great plenty, and
people abundance, the most of their inhabitants, in view of yt neck of Land,
where a better seat for a town cannot be desired: at the end of forty miles
this river inuironeth many low Islands, at each high water drowned for a mile,
where it unites it self, at a place called. Apokant the highest Towns
inhabited. 10. miles higher I discovered with the barge; in the mid way, a
great tree hindered my passage which I cut in two: here the river became
narrower, 8. 9 or 10. foot at a high water, and 6. or 7. at a low: the
stream exceeding swift, and the bottom hard channel, the ground most part of
a low plain, sandy soil, this occasioned me to suppose it might issue from
some lake or some broad ford, for it could not be far the head, but rather then
I would endanger the barge, yet to have been able to resolve this doubt, and
to discharge the imputation of malicious tungs, that half suspected I durst
not for so long delaying, some of the company as desirous as my self, we
resolved to bier a Canow, and return with the barge to Apocant, there to leave
the barge secute, and put our selves upon the aduenturs: the country only a
vast and wild wilderness, and but only that Town: within three or four mile
we hired a Canow, and 2. Indians to row us yt next day a fowling: having made
such provision for the barge as was needful, I let her there to ride, with
express th^rge not any to go ashore til my return. Though some wise men may
condemn this too bold attempt of too much indiscretion, yet if they well
consider the friendship of the Indians, inconducting me, the desolatenes of the
country, the propabilitie of some lack, and the malicious judges of my actions
at home^as also to have some matters of worth to encourage our adventurers in
england, might well have caused any honest (...) to have done the like, as well
for his own discharge as for the public g^d: having 2 Indians for my guide and
2 of our own company, I set forward, leaving 7 in the bargs: having disco^ered
20 miles further in this desert, the river still kept his depth and breadth, but
much more combred with trees: here we went ashore (being some 12 miles higher
then yt barge had been) to refresh our selves, during the boiling of our
vituals: one of the Indians I to^ke with me, to see the nature of the soil,
and to cross the bought^ of the river, the other Indian I lest with M.
Robbinson and Thomas Emry, with their matches light and order to discharge a
peace, for my retreat at the first sight of any Indian, but within a quarter of
an hour I heard a lewd cry, and hollowing of Indians, but no warning piece,
supposing them surprised, and that the Indians had betrayed us, presently I
seized him and bound his arm fast to my hand in a garter, with my pistol
ready bent to be revenged on him: he advised me to fly, and seemed dignorant of
what was done, but as we went discoursing, I was struck with an arrow an the
right thigh, but without harm: upon this occasion I espied 2 Indians drawing
their bows, which I prevented in discharging a french pistol: by that I had
charged again 3 or 4 more did the like, for the first fell down and fled: at
my discharge they did the like, my hind I made my barricado who offeced not to
strive, 20. or 30. arrows were shot at me but short, 3 or 4 times I had
discharged my pistol ^re the king of Pamau^ck called Opecka^kenough with 200
men, inuironed^e, each drawing their bow, which d^^e they laid them upon the
ground, yet without shot, my hind treated betwixt them and me of conditions of
peace, he discovered me to be the Captain, my request was to retire to yt
boat, they demanded my arms, the rest they said were slain, only me they
would reserve: the Indian importuned me not to that. In retiring being in the
midst of allow quagmire, and minding them more then my steps, I slept fast into
the quagmire, and also the Indian in drawing me forth: thus surprised, I
resolved to try their mercies, my arms I casts from me, till which none durst
approach me: being ceazed on me, they drew me out and led me to the King, I
presented him with a compass dial, describing by my best (...) the use
thereof, whereat he so amazedly admired, as he suffered me to proceed in a
discourse of the roundnes of the earth, the course of the sun, moon, stars
and plannets, with kind speeches and bread he requited me, conducting me where
the Canow lay and John Robbinson slain, with 20 or 30. arrows in him. Emry I
saw not, I perceived by the abundance of fires all over the woods, at each
place I expected when they would execute me, yet they used me with what kindness
they could: approaching their Town, which was within 6 miles where I was
taken, only made as arbors and covered with mats, which they remove as
occasion requires: all the women and children, being advertised of this
accident, came forth to meet them, the King well guarded with 20 bowmen 5
flanck and rear, and each flanck before him asword and a piece, and after him
the like, then a bowman, then I on each hand a boweman, the rest in file in the
rear, which rear led forth amongst the trees in a vishion, each his bow
and a handful of arrows, a quiner at his back gumly paintes: on each fl^nck
a sargeant, the one running always toward the front the other toward the
rear, each a true pace and in exceeding good order, this being a good time
continued, they (...) themselves in a ring with a dance, and (...) each man
departed to his lodging, the Captain conducting me to his lodging a quarter of
Venison and some ten pound of bread I had for supper, what I left was reserved
for me, and sent with me to my l^dging: each morning 3. women (...) me three
great platters of fine bread, more venison then ten men could devour I had, my
gown, points and garters, my compass and a tablet they gave me again, though 8
ordinarily guarded me, I wanted not what they could devise to content me: and
still our longer acquaintance increased our ^etter affection: much they
threatened to assault our forts, as they were solicited by the King of
Paspahegh, who showed at our fort great signs of sorrow for this mischance:
the King too he great delight in understanding the manner of our ships and
sailing the seas, the earth and skies and of our God: what he knew of the
dominious he spared not to acquaint me with, as of certain men clothed at a
place called Ocanahonan, clothed like me, the course of our river, and that
within 4 or 5 days journey of the falls, was a great turning of salt water: I
desired he would send a messenger to Paspahegh, with a letter I would write, by
which they should understand, how kindly they used me, and that I was well least
they should revenge my death: this he granted and sent three men, in such
weather, as in reason were impossible, by any naked to be endured: their cruel
minds toward the fort I had deuerted, in describing the ordinance and the
mines in the fields, as also the revenge Captain Newport would take of them at
his return, their intent, I incerted the fort, the people of Ocanahonum and
the back sea, this report they after found diverse Indians that c^nfirmed the
next day after my letter, came a saluage to my lodging, with his sword to have
slain me, but being by my guard intercepted, with abowe and arrow he offered to
have effected his purpose: the cause I knew not, till the King understanding
thereof came and told me of a man a dying, wounded with my pistol: he told me
also of another I had slain, yet the most concealed they had any hurt: this
was the father of him I had slain, whose fury to pre^ent, the King presently
conducted me to another Kingdom, upon the top of the next northerly river,
called Youghtanan, having feasted me, he further led me to another branch of
the river, called Mattapament, to swo other hunting towns they led me, and to
each of these Countries, a house of the great Emperor of Pewhakan, whom as yet
I supposed to be at the False, to him I told him I must go, and to return to
Paspahegh, after this four or five days marsh, we returned to Rasawrack, the
first town they brought me too, where binding the Mats in bundels, they
marched two days journey, and crossed the River of Youghtanan, where it was as
broad as Thames: so conducting me to a place called Menapacute in Pamaunke,
where ye King inhabited: the next day another King of that nation called
Kekataugh, having received some kindness of me at the Fort, kindly invited me to
feast at his house, the people from all places flocked to see me, each showing
to content me. By this the great King has four or five houses, each
containing fourscore or an hundred foot in length, pleasantly seated upon an
high sandy hill, from whence you may see westerly a goodly low Country, the
river before the which his crooked course causes many great Marshes of
exceeding good ground. An hundred houses, and many large plains are here
together inhabited more abundance of fish foul, and a pleasanter seat cannot
be imagined: the King with forty Bowmen to guard me, entreated me to discharge
my Pistol, which they there presented me with a mark at six score to strike
therewith but to spoil the pr^ctise I broke the cock, whereat they were much
discontented though a chance supposed.

From hence this kind King conducted me to a place called Topahanocke, a
kingdom upon another River northward: the cause of this was, that the year
before, a ship had been in the River of Pamaunke, who having been kindly
entertained by Powhatan their Emperor, they returned thence, and discovered
the River of Topahanocke, where being received with like kindness, yet he slew
the King, and looks of his people, and they supposed I were he, but the people
reported him a great man that was Captain, and using me kindly, the next day
we departed.

This River of Topahanock, seems in breadth not much less then that we dwell
upon. (...) the (...) of the River is a Country called Cuttata women upwards
is Ma^rough tacum Tapohanock, Appamatuck, and Nantengs ^acum; at Topmanahocks,
the head issuing from many Mountains, the next night I lodged at a hunting
town of Powha^ams, and the next day arrived at Waran^comoco upon the river of
Pama^ncke, where the great king is resident: by the way we passed by the top of
another little river, which is betwixt the two called Payankatank. The most of
this Country though Desert, yet exceeding fertile, good timber, most hills and
dales, in each valley a cristall spring.

Arrioing at Weramocomoco their Emperor, proudly lying upon a Bedstead a
foot high upon seune or twelve Mattes, richly hung with many Chains of great
Pearls about his neck, and covered with a great Coucring of Rahaughcums: At
head sat a woman, at his feet another, on each side sitting upon a Matte
upon the ground were raunged his chief men on each side the fire, ten in a
rank, and behind them as many young women, each a great Chain of white Beads
over their shoulders: their heads painted in rid and with such a grave and
Maiesticall countenance, as drove me into admiration to see such state in a
naked Saluage, he kindly welcomed me with good words, and great Platters of
sondrie V^ctuals, assuring me his friendship, and my liberty within four
days, he much delighted in Opechan Comoughs relation of what I ha^ described
to him, and often examined me upon the same. He asked me the cause of our
coming, I told him being in fight with the Spaniards our enemy, being over
powered near put to retreat, and by extreme weather put to this shore, where
landing at Chesipiack, the people shall us, but at Ke^u^ughtan they kindly used
us, we by signs demanded fresh water, they described us up the River was all
fresh water, at P^spahegh, also they kindly used us, one Pinnsse being leake
we were enforced to stay to mend her, till Captain Newport my father came to
conduct us away. He demanded why we went further with our Boa^e, I told him,
in that I would have occasion to talk of the back Sea, that on the other side
the maine, where was salt water, my father had a child flaine, which we
supposed M^nocan his enemy, whose death we intended to revenge.

After good deliberation, he began to describe me the Countries beyond the
Falls, with many of the rest, confirming what not only Opechancanoyes, and an
Indian which had been prosoner to Pewhatan had before told me, but some
called it five days, some six, some eight, where the said water dashed
amongst many stones and rocks, each storm which caused off times the head
of the River to be brackish: Anchanachuck he described to be the people that
had slain my brother, whose death he would revenge. He described also upon
the same Sea, a mighty Nation called Pocoughtronack, a fierce Nation that did
eat men, and warred with the people of Moyaoncer, and Pataromerke, Nations
upon the top or the head of the Bay, under his territories, where the year
before they had slein an hundred, he signified their crowns were shaven, long
hair in the neck, tied on a knot, Swords like Polla^es.

Beyond them he described people with short Coats, and Sleeves to the Elbowes,
that passed that way in Ships like ours. Many Kingdoms he described me to
the head of the Bay, which seemed to be a mighty River, issuing from mighty
Mountains betwixt the two Seas, the people clothed at Ocamahowan. He also
confirmed, and the Southerly Countries also, as the rest, that reported us to
be within a day and a half of Mangoge, two days of Chawwonock, 6. from
Roo^ock, to the south part of the back sea: he described a country called
Anon, where they have abundance of Brass, and houses walled as outs. I
required his discourse, seeing what pride he had in his great and spacious
Dominions, seeing that all he knew were under his Territories.

In describing to him the territorles of Europe, which was subject to our great
King whose subject I was, the innumerable multitude of his ships, I gave him to
understand the noise of Trumpets, and terrible manner of fighting were under
captain Newport my father, whom I entitled the Meworames which they call King
of all the waters, at his greatness he admired, and not a little feared: he
desired me to forsake Paspaliegh, and to live with him upon his River, a
Country called Capa Howasicke: he promised to give me Corn, Venison, or what
I wanted to feed us, Hatchets and Copper we should make him, and none should
disturb us. This request I promised to perform: and thus having with all the
kindness he could devise, sought to content me: he sent me home with 4. men,
one that usually carried my Gown and Knapsacke after me, two other loded with
bread, and one to accompany me.

This River of Pamaunke is not past twelve mile from that we dwell on, his
course northwest, and westerly, as the other. Weraocomoco, is upon salt water,
in breadth two miles, and to keeps his course without any tarrying some twenty
miles, where at the parting of the fresh water and the salt, if divides it
self into two parts, the one part to Goughland, as broad as Thames, and
^auigable, with a Boats threescore or four score miles, and with a Ship
(...), exceeding crooked, and many low grounds and marshes, but inhabited
with abundance of warlike and tall people. The Country of Youghtomam, of no
less worth, only it is lower, but all the soil, a fat, fertile, sandy
ground. Above Manapacumter, many high sandy Mountains. By the River is many
Rocks, seeming if not of several Mines: The other branch a little less in
breadth, yet extends not near so far, nor so well inbabited, somewhat
lower, and a white sandle, and a white clay soil: here is their best Terra
Sigillata: The month of the River, as I see in the discovery thereof with
captain Newport, is half a wile broad, and within four miles not above a
Musket shot: the channel exceeding good and dee^s, the River straight to the
(...). Kiskirk the nearest Nation to the entrances.

Their religion and Ceremony I observed was thus: three or four days after
my taking seven of them in the house where I lay, each with a rattle began at
ten a clock in the morning to sing about the fire, which they environed with a
Circle of meal, and after a foot or two from that, at the end of each song,
laid down two or three grains of wheat, continuing this order till they
have included six or seven hundred in a half Circle, and after that two or
three more Circles in like manner, a hand breadth from other: that done, at each
song, they put betwixt every three, two or five grains, a little slicke, so
counting as an old woman her Pater noster.

One disguised with a great Skin, his bead ^ung round with little Skins of
Weasels, and other vermin, with a Crownel of feathers on his head, painted as
ugly as the devil, at the end of each song will make many signs and
demonstrations, with strange and vehement actions, great cakes of Dear suet,
Dear, and Tobacco he casts in the fire, till six a clock in the Evening,
their howling would continue ere they would depart. Each morning in the coldest
frost, the principal to the number of twenty or thirty, assembled themselves
in a round circle, a good distance from the town, where they told me they
there consulted where to hunt the next day: so fat they fed nice, that I much
doubted they intended to have sacrificed me to the Quiyoughquosicke, which is
a superior power they worship, a more vglier thing cannot be described: one
they have for chief sacrifices, which also they call Quiyoughquosick: to cure
the sick, a man with a Rattle, and extreme howling, showting, singing, and
such violent gestures, and Anticke actions over the patient will suck out
blood and phlegm from the patient out of their unable stomach, or any diseased
place, as no labor will more tire them, Tobacco they offer the water in
passing in foul weather. The death of any they lament with great sorrow and
weeping: their Kings they bury betwixt two mattes within their houses, with
all his beads, tewels, hatchets, and copper: the other in graves like ours.
They acknowledge no resurrection. Powhatan has three brethren, and two
sisters, each of his brethren succeeded other.

For the Crown, their heirs inverite not, but the first heirs of the
Sisters, and so successively the weomens heirs: For the Kings have as many
weomen as they will, his Subjects two, and most but one.

From Weramocomoco is but 12. miles, yet the Indians trifled away that day, and
would not go to our Forte by any persuasions: but to certain old hunting
houses of Paspahegh we lodged all night. The next morning ere Sun rise, we
set forward for our Fort, where we arrived within an hour, where each man with
the truest signs of joy they could express welcomed me, except M. Archer,
and some 2. or 3. of his, who was then in my absence, sworn Counselor,
though not with the consent of Captain Martin: great blame and imputation was
laid upon me by them, for the loss of our two men which the Indians slew:
inso much that they purposed to depose me, but in the midst of my miseries, it
pleased God to send Captain Nuport, who arriving there the same night, so
tripled our joy, as for a while these plots against me were deferred though
with much malies against me, which captain Newport in short time did plainly
see. Now was master Scriuener, captain Martin, and my self, called
Couns^llers.

Within five or six days after the arrival of the Ship, by a mischaunce our
Fort was burned and the most of our apparel, lodging and private provision,
many of our old men diseased, and of our new for want of lodging perished. The
Empercur Powhatan each week once or twice sent me many presents of Dear,
bread Raugroughcuns, half always for my father, whom he much desired to see,
and half for me: and so continually importuned by messengers and presents,
that I would come to fetch the corn, and take the Country their King had
given me, as at last Captain Newport resolved to go see him. Such acquaintance
I had amongst the Indians, ^and such confidence they had in me, as near the
Fort they would not come till I came to them, every of them calling me by my
name, would not sell any thing till I had first received their presents, and
what they had that I liked, they deferred so my discresion: but after
acquaintance, they usually came into the Fort at their pleasure: The President,
and the rest of the Council, they kenew not, but Captain Newports greatness
I had so described, as they conceived him the chief, the rest his children,
Officers, and servants. We had agreed with yt king of Paspahegh to conduct two
of our men to a place called Panawicke beyond R^onok, where he reported many
men to be apparelled. We lended him at Warraskoyack, where playing the
villain, and deluding us for rewards, returned within three or four days
after without going further. Captain Newport, master Scrinener, and my self,
found the mouth of Pamauncks river, some 25. or 30. miles northward from Cape
Henricke, the channel good as before expressed.

Arriving at Weramocomoca, being jealous of the intent of this politic
saluage, to discover his intent the better, I with 20. shot armed in Jacks went
a shore, the Bay where he dwells has in it 3. cricks, and a^ile and a half
from the chanel all est, being conducter to the town, I found my self
mistaken in the cr^eke, for they al there were within less then a mile, the
Emperors son called Naukaquawis, the captain that look me, and diverse
others of his chief men conducted me to their kings habitation, but in the mid
way I was intercepted by a great creek over which they had made a bridge of
grained stakes and ratles, the king of Kiskieck, and Namontack, who all the
journey the king had sent to guide us, had conducted us this passage, which
caused me to suspect some mischief: the barge I had sent to meet me at the
right lanting, when I found my self first deceived, and knowing by experience
the most of their courages to proceed from others fear, though few lyked the
passage, I intermingled the Kings son, our conductors, and his chief men
amongst ours, and led forward, leaving half at the one end to make a guard
for the passage of the Front. The Indians seeing the weakness of the Bridge,
came with a Canow, and took me in of the midst with four or flue more,
bring landed we made a guard for the rest till all were passed, two in a rank
we marched to the Emperors house. Before his house stood forty or fifty great
Platters of fine bread, being entered the house, with loud tunes they all made
signs of great joy. This proud saluags, having his finest women, and the
principal of his chief men assemble^, sat in ranks as before is expressed,
himself as upon a Throne at the upper end of the house, with such a Majesty
as I cannot express, nor yet have often seen, either in Pagan or Christian,
with a kind countenance he has ^^ce welcome, and caused a place to be made
by himself to sit, I presented him a suit of red cloth, a white Greyhound,
and a Hatte, as Jewels he esteemed them, and with a great Oration made by three
of his Nobles, if there be any amongst Saluages, kindly accepted them, with a
public confirmation of a perpetual league and friendship.

After that, he commanded the Queen^ of Apamatuc, a comely young Saluage, to
give ^water^ water, a Turkie-cocke, and bread to eat: being thus feasted, he
began his discourse to this purpose. Your kind visitation does much content
me, but where is your father whom I much desire to see, is he not with you. I
told him he remained aboard, but the next day he would come unto him, with a
merry countenance he asked me for certain pieces I which promised him, when I
went to Paspahegh, I told according to my promise, that I proffered the man
that went with me four (...) Coluerings, in that he so desired a great Gunne,
but they re^^sed to take them, whereat with alowde laughter, he desired to give
him some of less burden, as for the other I gave him them, being sure that
none could carry them: but where are these men you promised to come with you,
I told him without, who thereupon gave order to hau^ them brought in, two after
two, ever mainteining the guard without. And as they presented themselves ever
with thanks, he would saint me, and caused each of them to have four or five
pound of bread given them. This done, I asked him for the corn and ground he
promised me He told me I should have it, but he expected to have all these men
lay their arms at his feet, as did his subjects. I told him that was a
ceremony our enemies desired, but never our Friends, as we presented our
selves unto him, yet that he should (...) doubt of our friendship: the next day
my Father would give him a child of ^is, in full assurance of our loves, and
not only that, but when he should think it convenient, we would deliver under
his subjection the Country of Manacam and Pocough^aonack his enemies.

This so contented him, as immediately with attentive silence, with a loud
oration he proclaimed me Awerowanes of Powhaton, and that all his subjects
should so esteem us, and no man account us strangers nor Paspaheghans, but
Powhatans, and that the Corn, weomen and Country, should be to us as to his
own people: this proffered kindness for many reasons we contemned not, but with
the best Languages and signs of thanks I could express, I took my leave.

The King rising from his seat, conducted me forth, and caused each of my men
to have as much more bread as he could bear: giving me some in a basket, and
as much he sent a board for a present to my Father: victuals you must know is
all there wealth, and the greatest kindness they could show us: arriving at the
River, the Barge was fallen so low with the ebb, though I had given order and
often sent to prevent the same, yet the messengers deceived me, the Skies being
very thick and rainie, the King understanding this mischance, sent his Son
and Mamontacke, to conduct me to a great house sufficient to lodge me, where
entering I saw it hung round with bows and arrows.

The Indians used all diligence to make us fires, and give us content: the
kings Orators presently entertained us with a kind oration, with express
charge that not any should steal, or take out bows or arrows, or offer any
injury.

Presently after he sent me a quarter of Venizon to slay my stomach: in the
evening he sent for me to come only with two shot with me: the company I
g^ue order to stand upon their guard, and to maintain two sentries at the
ports all night. To my supper he set before me meat for twenty men, and seeing
I could not eat, he caused it to be given to my men: for this is a general
custom, that what they give, not to take again, but you most either eat it,
give it away, or carry it with you: two or three hours we spent in our a^^ent
discourses, which done, I was with a fire stick lighted to my lodging.

The next day the King conducting me to the River, showed me his Canawes, and
described unto me how he sent them over the Baye, for tribute Beads: and also
what Countries paid him Beads, Copper or (...). But seeing Captain Nuport,
and Master Scriuener, coming a shore, the King retu^ned to his house, and I
went to meet him, with a trumpet before him, we marched to the King: who
after his old manner kindly received him, especially a Boy of thirteen years
old, called Thomas Saluage, whom he gave him as his Sanne: he requited this
kindness with each of us a great basket of Beans, and entertaining him with the
former discourse, we passed away that day, and agreed to bargain the next day,
and so returned to our Pinnis: the next day comming^ shore in like order, the
king having kindly entertained us with a breakfast, questioned with us in this
manner.

Why we came armed in that sort, seeing he was our friend, and had neither
bows nor arrows, what did we doubt? I told him it was the custom of our
Country, not doubting of his kindness any ways, wherewith though he seemed
satisfied, yet Captain Nuport caused all our men to retire to the water side,
which was some thirty score from thence: but to prevent the worst, Master
Scriuener or I were either the one or other by the Barge, experience had w^ll
taught me to believe his friendship, till convenient opportunity suff^ed him to
betrey us, but quickly this politician had perceived my absence, and ^unningly
sent for me; I sent for Master Scriuener to supply my place, the King would
demand for him, I would again relee^^ him, and they sought to satisfy our
suspicion with kind Language, and not being agreed to trade for corn, he
desired to see all our Hatchets and Copper together, for which he would give us
corn, with that ancient trick^ the Chick ahamaniens had often acquainted me:
his offer I refused, offering first to see what he would give for one piece,
he seeming to despise the nature of a Merchant, did scorn to sell, but we
freely should give him, and he liberally would requite us.

Captain Nuport would not with less then twelve great Coppers try his
kindness, which he liberally requited with as much corn as of Chickah^mania, I
had for one of less proportion: our Hatchets he would also have at his own
rate, for which kindness ^ee much seemed to affect Captain Nuport, some few
bunches of blew Beads I had, which he much desired, and seeing so few, he
off^^d me a basket of two pecks, and that which I drew to be three pecks at the
least, and yet seemed contented and desired more: I agreed with him the next
day for two bushells, for y^ ebb now constrained us to return to our Boat,
although he earnestly vesi^ed us to stay dinner which was a providing, and
being ready he sent aboard after us, which was bread and venizon, sufficient
for fifty or sixty persons.

The next day he sent his Son in the morning not to bring a shore with us
any pieces, least his weomen and children should fears. Captain Nuports good
belief would have satisfied that request, yet twenty or twenty five shot we
got a shore: the King in portuning me to leave my arms aboard, much misliking
my sword, pistol and target, I told him the man that slew my Brother with the
like terms had persuaded me, and being unarmed shot at us, and so betraide us.

He often entreated Captain Nuport that his men might lean their arms, which
still he commanded to the water side, this day we spent in trading for blew
Beads, and having near straighted our Barge.

Captain Nuport returned with them that came abord, having me and Master
Scriuener a shore, to follow in Canowes; into one I got with six of our men,
which being lan^hed a stones cast from the shore stuck fast in the Ose:
Master Scriuener seeing this example, with seven or eight more passed the
dreadful bridge, thinking to have found deeper water on the other cr^^ke, but
they were in forced to stay with such entertainment as a saluage, being forced
ashore with wind and rain, having in his Canow, as commonly they have, his
house and household, instantly seeing (...) up a house of mats which succored
them from the storm. (...)

The Indians seeing (...) pestred in the Ose, called to me, six or seven of
the Kings chiefs men threw off their skins, and to the middle in Ose came to
bear me out on their heads, their import^^acie caused me better to like the
Canow then their curtes^e, excusing my denial for fear to fall into the Ose,
desiring them to bring me some w^^d, fire, and mats, to cover me, and I would
content them: each presently gave his help to satisfy my request, which
pains a horse would scarce have endured, yet a couple of bells richly
contented them.

The Emperors sent his Seaman Mantiuas in the evening with bread and victual
for me and my men, he no more scrip^^^s then the rest seemed to take a pride in
showing how (...) he regarded that miserable cold and d^rty passage, though a
d^ggs would scarce have endured it, this kindness I found, when I little expected
less then a mischiefs, but the black^ night parting our companies, ere
midnight the (...) served to carry us aboard: the next day we came ashore, the
King with a solemn discourse causing all to depart, but his principal men,
and this was the effect, when as he perceived that we had a desire to invade
Monacum, against whom he was no professed enemy, yet thus far he would
assist us in this enterprise: First he would send his spies, perfectly to
understand their strength and ability ^o fight, with which he would acquaint us
himself.

Captain Nuport would not be seen in it himself, being great Werowances,
they would stay at home, but I, Master Scriuener, and two of his Sons, and
Opechankanough. The King of Pamaunke should have 100. of his men to go before
as though they were hunting, they giving us notise where was the advantage we
should kill them, the wcomen and young children he wished we should spare, and
bring them to him, only 100. or 150. of our men he held sufficient for this
exploit: our boats should stay at the falls, where we might hew timber, which
we might convey each man a piece till we were past the stones, and there join
them, to pass our men by water, if any were shot, his men should bring them
back to our boats, this fair tale had almost made Captain Nuport undertake,
by this means to discover the South sea, which will not be without treachery,
if we ground our intent upon his constancy.

This day we spent in trading, dancing, and much mirth, the King of Pamaunke
sent his messenger, as yet not knowing Captain Nuport, to come unto him: who
had long expected me, desiring also my Father to visit him: the messenger
stayed to conduct us, but Powhatan understanding that we had Hatchets lately
come from Paspahegh, desired the next day to trade with us, and not to go
further.

This new trick he cunningly pot upon him, but only to have what he listed,
and to try whether we would go or stay, Opechanke^oughs messenger returned that
we would not come: the next day his Daughter came to entreat me, showing her
Father had hurt his leg, and much sorrowed he could not see me.

Captain Nuport being not to be persuaded to go in, that Powhatan had
desired us to stay: sent her away with the like answer, yet the next day upon
better consideration entreaty pre^ailed, and we anchored at Cinquoateck, the
first ^waine above the parting of the river, where dwelled two Kings of
Pamaunke, Brothers to Powhatan: the one called Opitchapam, the other Katatough,
to these I went a shore, who kindly entreated me and Master Scriuener,
sending some presents aboard to Captain^ Nuport, whilst we were trucking with
these Kings.

Opechankanough his wife, weomen, and children came to meet me with a natural
kind affection, he seemed to rejoice to see me.

Captain Nuport came a shore, with many kind discourses we passed that
foren^^ne: and after di^^er, Captain Nuport went about with the Pinnis to
Menapacant which is twenty miles by water, and not one by land: Opechankanough,
conducted me and Master Scriuener by land, where having built a feasting house
a purpose to entertain us with a kind Orali^n, after their manner and his best
provision, kindly welcomed us, that day he would not trucks, but did his best
to delight us with content: Captain Nuport arrived toward evening, whom the
King presented with six great platters of five bread, and Pansa^owm^^a, the
next day till none we traded: the King feasted all the company, and the
afternoon was spent in playing, dancing, and delight, by no means he would
have us depart till the next day, he had feasted us with veni^on, for which he
had sent, having spent his first and second provision in expecting out coming:
the next day he performed his promise, giving more to us three, then would have
sufficed 30. and in that we carried not away what we le^^, he sent it after us
to the Pinnis, with what words or signs of love he could express, we departed.

Captain. Nuport in the Pinnis, leaving me in the Barge to dig a rock,
where we supposed a Mine at Cinquaoreck, which done, ere midnight I arrived at
Werac^m^co, where our Pinnis anchored, b^ing 20. miles from Cinquao^ecke, the
next day we took leave of Powhatan, who in regard of his kindness gave him an
Indian, he will affected to go with him for England in steed of his Son, y^
cause I assure me was to know our strength and Countries condition: y^ next day
we arrived at Kiskiack, the people so scornefully entertained us, as with what
signs of scorn and discontent we could, we departed and returned to our Fort
with 250. bushells of Corn, our president being not wholly recovered of his
sickness, in discharging, his Piece brake and split his hand off, which he is
not yet well recovered.

At Captain Nuports arrival, we were victualled for tw^lue weeks, and
having furnished him of what he thought good, he set sail for England the
tenth of April: Master Scriuener and my self with our shallop, accompanied
him to Captain Hendrick.

Powhatan having for a farrewell, sent him five or six men's loadings, with
Torkeyes for swords, which he sent him in our return to y^ ^ort: we discovered
the (...) of Nausamd, a proud warlike Nation, as well we may testified, at our
first arrival at Chesiapiack: but that injury Captain Nuport well revenged at
his return, where some of them in^i^^ng him to their (...) by a da^nce, he
perceiving their intent, with a valley of musket that, slew one, and shot one or
two more, as themselves confess, the King at our ariuall sent for me to come
unto him: I sent him word what commodities I had to exchange for wheat, and if
he would as had the rest of his Neighbors, conclude a Peace, we were
contented, at last he came down before the Boat which rid at anchor some
forty yards from y^ shore, he signified to me to come a shore, and sent a
Canow with four or five of his men, two whereof I desired to come aboard and
to stay, and I would send two to talk with their King a shore, to this he
agreed: the King we presented with a piece of Copper, which he kindly
excepted, and sent for victuals to entertain the messengers.

Master Scriuener and my self also, after that went a shore: the King kindly
feasted us, requesting us to stay to trade till the next day, which having
done, we returned to the Fort, this river is a musket shot broad, each side
being should bays, a narrow channel but three f^dom, his course for eighteen
miles, almost directly South, and by West, where begins the first
inhabitants, for a mile it turns directly East, toward the West, a great bay
and a white chaukie Island, convenient for a Fort: his next course South, where
within a quarter of a mile, the river divides in two, the neck a plain high
Corn field, the wester bought a high plain likewise, the Northeast answerable
in all respects: in these plains are planted abundance of houses and people,
they may contain 1000. Acres of most excellent fertile ground, so sweeete, so
pleasant, so beautiful, and so strong a prospect, for an invincible strong
City, with so many commodities, that I know as yet I have not seen: This is
within one deies journey of Chawwonocke, the river falls into the Kings
river, within twelve miles of Cape-hendicke.

At our Fort, the ^ooles we had were so ordinarily stolen by the Indians, as
necessity enforced us to correct their brauing theeuerie: for he that stol^ to
day, durst came again the next day. One amongst the rest, having stolen two
swords, I got the Counsels consent to set in the bilboes: the next day with
three more, he came with their wooden swords in the midst of our men to
steal, their custom is to take any thing they can ceaze off, only the people
of Pamaunke, we have not found stealing: but what others can steal, their
King receives.

I had them depart, but flourishing their swords, they seemed to defend what
they could catch but out of our hands, his pride urged me to turn him from
amongst us, whereat he offered to strike me with his sword, which I prevented,
striking him first: the rest eff^ing to revenge the blow, received suck an
encounter, and sled; the better to affright them, I pursued them with five or
six shot, and so chased them out of the Island: the beginning of this broyle,
little expecting by his carriage, we durst have resisted, having even till that
present, not been contradicted, especially them of Paspahegh: these Indians
within one hour, having by other Saluages, then in the Fort, understood that I
threatened to be revenged, came presently of themselves, and fell to working
upon our wears, which were then in hand by other Saluages, who seeing their
pride so incountred, were so so submissiue, and willing to do any thing as
might be, and with trembling fear, desired to be friends within three days
after: From Nawsamond which is 30. miles from us, the King sent us a Hatchet,
which they had stolen from us at our being there: the messenger as is the
custom, also we well rewarded and contented.

The twenty of April, being at work, in hewing down Trees, and setting
Corn, an alarm caused us with all speed to take our arms, each expecting a
new assault of the Saluages: but understanding it a Boat under sail, our
doubts were pr^^ently satisfied, with the happy sight of Master Nelson, his
many perrills of extreme storms and tempests. His ship well, as his company
could testify his care in sparing our provision, was well: but the providence
thereof, as also of our stones, Hatchets, and other fools, only ours
excepted, which of all the rest was most necessary, which might enforce us, to
think either a seditious traitor to our action, or a most unconscionable
deceiuer of our treasures. This happy arrival of Master Nelson in the Phoenix,
having been then about three months missing, after Captain Nuports
arrival, being to all our expectations lost: albeit, that now at the last,
having been long crossed with tempest^ous weather, and contrary winds, his so
unexpected coming, did so ravish us with exceeding joy, that now we thought
our selves as well filled, as our hearts could wish, both with a competent
number of men, as also for all other needful provisions, till a further supply
should come unto us: whereupon the first thing that was concluded, was, that my
self, and Master Scriuener, should with 70. men go with the best means we
could provide, to discover beyond the Falls, as in our judgments conveniently
we might: six or seven days we spent only in trayning, our men to march,
fight, and scirwish in the woods, their willing minds to this action, so
quickened their understanding in this exercise, as in all judgments we were
better able to fight with Powhatans whole force: in our order of battle amongst
the Trees, (for Thicks there is few) then the Fort was to rep^^s^ 400. at the
first ass^ult, with some ten or twenty shot, not knowing what to do, nor how
to use a Piece: our warrant being s^aled, Master Nelson refused to (...) us
with the voluntary Mariners, and himself as be promised, unless we would
stand bound to pay the hire for ship, and Mariners, for the time they
stayed: and further there was some controversy, through the diversity of
Contrary opinions, some alleging, that how profitable, and to what good
purpose soever our journey should portend, yet our commission, commanding no
certain design, we should be taxed for the most indiscreete men in the world,
besides the wrong we should do to Captain Nuport, to whom only all
discoueries did belong, and (...) no other: the means for guides, beside the
uncertain courses of the river, from which we could not err much, each night
would fortify us in two hours, better then that they first called the Fort,
their Towns upon the river, each within one days journey of other, besides
our ordinary provision, might well be supp^sed to add relief: for truck and
dealing only, but in love and peace, as with the rest; if they assalted us, their
Towns they cannot defend, nor their lnggage to convey, that we should not
share, but admit the worst, 16. days provision we had of Ch^^se, O^tmeale, and
b^^ket besides our rand^nous, we could and might have hid in the ground. With
six men, Captain Martin, would have undertaken it himself, leaving the rest
to defend the Fort, and plant our Corn: yet no reason could be reason, to
proceed^ forward, though we were going aboard to set sail: These discontents
caused so many doubts to some, and discouragement to others, as our journey
ended: yet some of us procured petitions to set us forward, only with hope o^
our own confusions, our next course was to turn husbandmen, to fell Trees and
set Corn. Fifty of our men, we employed in this service, the rest kept the
Fort, to do the command of the president, and Captain Martin, 30. days the
ship lay expecting yt trial of certain matters, which for some cause I keep
private: yt next exploit was an Indian having stolen an Are was so pursued by
Master Scriuener, and them next him, as he threw it down, and flying, drew
his how at any that durst encounter him: within four or five days alter,
Master Scr^uener and I, being a little from the Fort, among the Corn, two
Indiants, each with a codgell, and all newly painted with T^rrasigillate, came
circling about me, as though they would have clubed me like a hare: I knew
their faining love is toward me, not withort a deadly hatred, but to prevent
the worst, I calling master Scriuener retired to the Fort: the Indians seeing
me suspect them, with good (...), asked me for some of their men, whom they
would beat, and went with me into our Fort, ^^nding one that lay ordinarily
with us, only for a spy: they offered to beat him, I in persuading them to
forbear, they offered to begin with me being now four for two other arrayed
in like manner, came in on the other side the Fort: whereupon I caused to shut
the Ports, and apprehend them. The president and Counsel, being presently
acquainted, remembering at the first assault, they came in like manner, and
never else but against some villauie, concluded to commit them to prison, and
expect the event, eight more we ceazed at that present, an hour after came
three or four other strangers, extraordinarily fited with arrows, s^innes,
and shooting glo^es, their jealousy and fear, bewrayed their bad intent, as
also their suspicious departure.

The next day came first an Indian, then another as Embassa^ors for their men,
they desired to speak with me, our discourse was, that what Spades, Shouells,
swords, or fools they had stain, to bring home (if not the next day, they
should hang) the next news was, they had taken two of our men, ranging in the
woods, which mischief no punishment will prevent bat hanging, and these they
would should redeem their own 16. or 18. thus brauing us to our doors, we
desired the president, and Captain Martin, that afternoon to sally upon them,
that, they might but know, what we durst to do, and al night mand our Barge,
and burnt their Towns, and spoiled, and destroys, what we could, but they
brought our men, and freely delivered them: the president released one, the
rest we brought well guarded, to Morning and Evening prayers Our men all in
arms, their trembling fear, then caused them to much sorrow, which till then
scoffed, and scorned at what we durst do, the Counsel concluded, that I
should terrifle them with some torture, to know if I co^ld know their intent
the next day I bound one in hold, to the maint Mast, and presenting fire
Muskets with match in the cocks, forced him to desire life, to answer my
demands he could not, but one of his Comouodos was of the counsel of
Paspahegh, that could satisfy me: I releasing him out of sight, I affrighted
the other, first with the rack, then with Muskets, which seeing, he desired me
to stay, and he would confess to this execution Master Scriuener came, his
discourse was to this effect, that Paspehegh, the Chickahamaniar, Youghtanum,
Pamaunka, Mattapanient, and Kiskiack. These Nations were altogether a hunting
that took me, Paspahegh, and Chicahamanya, had intended to surprise us at
work, to have had our tools: Powhatan, and al his would some friends, till
Captain Nuports return, that he had again his men, which he called
Namontack, where with a great feast he would so enamor Captain Nuport and his
men, as they should ceaze on him, and the like traps would be laid for (...).

This trap for our fools, we suspected the chief occasion was four days
before Powhatan (...) sent the boy he had to us, with many Turkies to Master
Scriuener, and me, understanding I would go up into his Countries to destroy
them, and he doubled it the more, in that I so often practiced my men, whose
shooting he heard to his own lodging, that much feared his wives, and
children; we sent him word, we intended no such thing, but only to go to
Powhatan, to seek stones to make Hatchets, except his men shoot at us, as
Paspahegh had told us they would, which if they did shoot but one arrowe, we
would destroy them, and least this mischief might happen, sent the boy to
acquaint him thus much, and request him to send us Weanock, one of his subjects
for a guide, yt boy he returned back with his Chest, and apparel, which then
we had given him, desiring another for him, y^ cause was, he was practicing
with the Chikahamanias, as the boy suspected some vnlanie, by their
extraordinary resort, and secret conference (...): whence they would send him.
The boy we keep, now we would send him many men's; sengers, and presents, the
guide we desired be sent us and withal requested us to return him, either the
boy or some order, but none he could have, and that day these Indians were
apprehended, his son with others yt had loaded at our Fort, returned and
being out of the Fart, rayl^d on me, to (...) our (...) enemies to (...) and to
y^ (...) after W^anock yt had (...) with (...) kept to have (...) returned, and
secretly after him, Amocis toe Paspaheyan, who always they kept amongst us
for, (...), whom the better to avoid suspicion, presently after they came to
bea^e away: these presumptions induced me to take any occasion, not only to
try the honesty of Amocis, the spy but also the meaning o^ these cunning
crickes of their Emperor of Powhatan; whose true (...) Captain Ma^^^n most
confidently pleades.

(...) of M^cano^, which was the counselor of Pasp^^^gh: first I then Master
(...), upon their several examinations, ^ound by them all confirmed, that
Paspahegh, and C^^^kahammania did hate us, and intended some mischief, and who
they were that took me, the names of them that stole our tools, and swords,
and that Powhatan received them, they all agreed: certain vo^^lies of shot we
caused to be discharged, which caused each other to think that their fellows
had been slain.

Powhatan understanding we detained certain Saluages, seat his Daughter, a
child al ten years old, which not only for feature, countenance, and
proportion much exceeds any of the rest of his people, but for wit, and
spirit, the only Nonpariel of his Country: this he sent by his most trusty
messenger, called Rawhunt, as much exceeding in (...) person, but of a subtle
wit, and crafty understanding, he with a long circumstance, told me, how well
Powhatan, loved and respected me, and in that I should not doubt any way of
his kindness, ^e had sent his child, which he most esteemed, to see me, a
Dear, and bread, besides for a present: desiring me that the Boy might come
again, which he loved exceedingly, his little Daughter he had taught this
lesson also: not taking notice at all of the Ind^ans that had been prisoners
three days, till that morning that she saw their fathers are friends come
quietly, and in good ^earmes to entreat their liberty.

Opechaukanough, sent also unto us, that for his sake, we would release two
that were his friends, and for a token sent me his shooting Glove, and Bracer,
which the day our men was taken upon, (...) himself from the rest a long time,
entreated to speak with me, where in token of peace, he had preferred me the
same: now all of them having found their perempsorie conditions, but to
increase our malice, which they seeing us begin to threaten to destroy them, as
familiarly as before, without suspicion, or fear, came amongst us, to beg
liberty for their men: In the afternoon they being gone, we guarded them as
before to the Church, and after prayer, gave them to Pocahuntas, the Kings
Daughter, in regard of her fathers kindness in sending her: after having well
fed them, as all the time of their imprisonment, we gave them their bows,
arrows, or what else they had, and with much content, sent them packing:
Pocahuntas, also we requited, with such trifles as contented her, to tell that
we had used yt Paspaheyans very kindly in so releasing them. The next day we
had suspicion of some other practice for an Ambuscado, but perfectly we could
not discover it, two days after a Paspheyan, came to show us a glistering
Mineral stone: and with signs demonstrating it to be in great abundance,
like unto Rocks, with some dozen more, I was sent to seek to dig some
quantity, and the Indean to conduct me: but suspecting this some trick to
delude us, for to get some Copper of us, or with some ambuscado to betray us,
seeing him falter in his tale, being two miles on our way, led him ashore,
where abusing us from place to place, and so seeking either to have drawn us
with him into the (...), or to have given us the s^ppe: I showed him Copper,
which I promised to have given him, if he had performed his promise, but for
his scoffing and abusing us, I gave him twenty lashes with a Rope, and his
bows and arrows, bidding him (...) if he durst, and so let him go.

In all this time, our men being all or the most part well recovered, and we
not willing to trifle away more time then necessity enforced us unto, we
thought good for the better content of the adventurers, in some reasonable sort
to ^raight home Master Nelson with Cedar wood, about which, our men going with
willing minds, was in very good time effected, and the ship sent for England;
we now remaining being in good health, all our men well co^tended, free from
mutinies, in love one with another, and as we hope in a continual peace with
the Indians, where we doubt not but by Gods gracious assistance, and the
adventurers willing minds, and speedy furtherance to so honorable an action in
after times, to see our Nation to enjoy a Country, not only exceeding pleasant
for habitation, but also very profitable for comerce in general, no doubt
pleasing to almighty God, honorable to our gracio^s Sovereign, and
commodious generally to the whole Kingdom.

FINIS.
