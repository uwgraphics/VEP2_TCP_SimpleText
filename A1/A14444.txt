Then who so will comprise and understand the substance of this present
volume. for to learn and know specially the creacion. of this world the
gretenes of the firmament and lytylnes of therthe in regard of heaven how ye
vij. sciences were founden and what they be / by which he may the better
auaylle in knowleche all ye days of his lif Then late him read this said
volume treatably auisedly and ordynatly that in such thing as he shall read /
he suffer nothing to pass. but that he understand it right well / And so may
he know and understand verytably the declaracion of this said volume. And he
then that so will obey this commandment / May by the content of the same
learn great party of the form and condycio^ of this world And how by the will
of our lord it was by him created made and complysshed. And the cause wherefore
it was establysshid. whereof the debonayr lord has don to us so great grace.
that we ever ben bounden to give him lawde and worship. or else we had not ben
of any value / ne worth any thing. no more than vnersonable beestis / Then
late us pray the maker and creator. of al creatures god almyhty that at the
beginning of this book it list him of his most bou^teuous grace to depart
with us of the same that we may learn / And that learned to reteyne / and that
retained so teache. that we may have so parfyght science and knowleche of god /
that we may get thereby the health of our sowles. and to be partyners of his
glory permanent and without end in heaven Amen /

Hier begins the book called the Myrrour of the world. And treats first
of the power and puyssaunce of god / Capitulo primo.
WE ought to know that when our lord god made the world And that he had made
all things of naught / he had no need of it. For as much had he before / as
he had afterward certainly god was to fore. And shall be incessantly after
without end / and without beginning / Then he shall nothing amend ne be
better For him faylled never any thing he sees all hereth all knows all /
And holds all thing in his hand. He had never hunger. ne thirst. ne time
/ ne day / ne hour / but abides contynuelly in all good. For to him ne
aperteyneth soon ne late / And of all them that ever were / that been / and
shall be have always ben and shall be to fore his eyes as well the far as the
nyghe / And the evil as the good he saw as well the world er it was made and
fourmed as he does now at this day / And if he had never made the world / as
much had he ben then worth. and of as great valewe as he ever might have be.
For other wise he might not be god. If he knew not saw and herd all that
might be. And if he were not so he should be lackyng and not mighty of every
thing. And of so much he was and should be a mortal man / but his nature was
not such / For he is god entierly and hooll without beginning and without end
/ Nothing is to him new ne old / All weel and good thyngis ben his by
right. And by nature goon. and return ageyn to him. For fro him all things
proceed and meue. And retornyng to him in holdyng the right way / He retcheth
never of any harm. For his bounte is all pure / clean hool / and clear
without any espece of evil / Certes all evil is ben to him contraryes / And
therefore it is pure necessite that they wythdrawe them under him and fro all his
goodness for it is / nothing but donge and ordure / which must needs d^scende
in to the deppest / And the good thyngis must needs goo upward to fore the
souerayn creator which is clear net / and pure. And the sins which ben
obscure. horrible and derke above all other thing seven the good which is
about god and auale and goo down / For so behooves it to be by rayson and
nature / All in like wise as we see the ordure of the wyn that is put in the
vessel. and the ^oule departs fro the clear / In such wise as the good and
clear abides above / And the lie which is thordure abides byneth in the
bottom as infecte and not good / And the good wyn that is above abides always
clear and fyn / And that which is not good that is benethe in the bottom
abides always obscure / foul. and black / And so much the more as the wyn is
good and more clear / so much more reteyneth the lie more of fylthe and
obscure / thus is it of the good and evil / For the evil must descend in to
places derke and horrible / and full of all sorrow and bitterness / And so
much more as the good shyneth to fore god and the more it Ioyeth / so much
the more sorrow and derkenesse is in hell. where it is contynuell and shall be
as long as god shall be in heaven / Where as god has all goodness to fore him
and alleway shall have without pain. without trauayll / and without grief or
Ennoye he has all / and all he enlumyneth without any defaulte and without
any term / God may make all thing. and all deffete or unmake without
changyng him self in any thing that may be / For he may all and conceyueth
all. There is nothing that may hurt him / he is establed without any meuyng.
And all meuynges m^ue of him / An hundred thousand year mount not to him so
much as the thousand part of one only hour of this world. ne to all them
that be in heaven / of which the least that abides there has more Joy in an
hour only. and of deduyte soulace gladness and of honor of which he shall never
be weary ne full / than any man may think ne know ne esteem in this world in
an hundred thousand year if he might so long live and endure. thaugh he were
the most subtle of all the men that ever were born or ever shall be though he
thought the best he might / Of this so great and Inestymable glory is god
the very and souerayn lord without any other. as god that all knows and
all sees. all that ever that has been all that is / and all that ever shall
be / and all that belongs to him / Him faylled never any thing that is good
/ he has hem allew^y to fore him / Ner there was never any good thing ne
never shall be / But that it was pourtrayed to fore him. before the creacion of
the world / Now ye shall here why and wherefore god created and made the world /

Wherefore god made and created the world / Capitulo. ij.
GOd made and created all the world of his only will by cause that he might
have some thing that might be such as might deserve of his well and goodness
if it were not in his defaulte / And therefore he establysshid this world.
Nothing for yt he should be the better ne yt he had any need / But he did it
for charity and by his great debonayrte / For as right charytable / he would
that other should part with him of his well and goodness. And that all other
creatures euerich after his nature should feel of his puyssau^ce after that it
might apperteyne to him. Thus would god establissh this world. that such things
should Issue yt might understand and know the noblesse of his power and of his
sapyence / and also of the good that he made for the man erthely / that he
might serve him in such manner. yt by him he might deserve the great well and
good that he had made for him / then ne ought we above all other thing to
love him and thank him that made and fourmed us / When we have such power and
such auctoryte by him. That if we will love him we shall be lords of all
goods. Now love we him then with all our might. and then shall we do as
wise men And if we do not we shall have great harm and damage / For if we by
our cause lose such goods as our lord has made for us / Yet for all that
god shall lose nothing / Certainly he made them to the end that we should have
them sith that by our good deeds we might conne deserve them and that he of his
grace has given to us the wit. thentendement and the power /

Wherefore god fourmed man like unto his image and to his semblaunce / Caplo.
iij.
When god fourm^ed man he would make and create him like unto his image and
semblamce / to the end that he should have remembranuce of the goods that he had
lent him / And that he might deserve them all by right and rayson / For he
shewde to him so great love / that above all other treasures he fourmed him to
his figure and semblaunce / And gaf to him naturelly right parfyght
understanding for to love and know him more than any other thing / to the end
that he might part more largely of his goods than any other creature / Ne god
did nene^ ne made for other creature so many good things / as he has made
for man / But who is he that will deserve them And if he do not it is reason
that he sorrow. For he does to god no bounte. that does well for to have his
grace and his love / For he does it more for his owen prouffyt / than he does
it for other / And there for he does well that loves and seruyth him. For much
may he call him self caytyff and meschaunt / that by his folly leseth so hye.
so noble and so excellent glory. For his sin that prouffyteth him naught.
And has not in the end but shame and blame And draws him in to such a place
where is no thing but pain. y^e. sorrow. and heaviness. of which he shall
never see him delyuerd as long as helyueth / Thus has heloste the great Joy
that was given to him / which is taken away by his sin. And might have been
a lord if he had would / If he had mayntened him self in doing always good
works. and would have absteyned and kept him fro doing evil / For who that
does well in this world he has so much good and honor that thangels of heaven
make him their lord and maystre / by fore god king of all kings. Then he
may well hold him for ewrous and happy that does so much good in earth
during his lyff that may conquer and have this honor / And that may every
person do all for him self if it pleseth him / Now late euerych do as him
good shall seem. and take which that he will / For he may win by doing well
and also lose by doing evil /

Wherefore god made not the man / such as he might not sin / Capitulo. iiij.
When our lord god created the man / he gaf to him power to do his fre will.
That is to wete to do good or evil which he would / For if god had made the
man such as he might not have sinned ne to have done nothing but well. he
should have take from him somewhat of his power / For he might not then have
done evil when it had plesyd him / And then it should have followed / that
would he or not / he should always have done well without reason / And thus he
should not have been cause of the good that he should have done / but it should
have proceeded of another which by force should have caused him and have given
him the will / And he by the moyen of that he so should do / should deserve
the gwerdon / and not only he / For lytyl deserves he that by force of other
does seruyse / who that to morrow should put me in a strong prison against my
will for to do good / I should not hold him for wise / For he should do me
wrong / Nevertheless it was well in our lords power if it had plesed him to
have made man such that he should not have sinned ne have don any harm ne
evil / But he had not deseruyd yet such merit ne reward as he now does in
no time of the world / And therefore god gaf to man plain frewylle to do well
or evil to the end that in well doing and leuyng the evil he might have more
merit / For otherwise he might not deserve so much / if god had made thangels
such as might not have sinned dedly / ne have don evil / For that yet should
not they deserve so noble a yefte as the men / And who that will deserve these
hye merytes / he ought gladly with entyer heart and parfyght serve by great
love and great reverence him that has made him for to conquer and come to the
most hye honor. And our lord god would that man were such / that by right he
might deserve as much good a boute him as he him self has. And therefore he
gaf to him wit and r^son for to have entencion to him / For by right he ought
well to serve him / Then is he a much fooll that pourueyeth not to do well
whiles he is here living / For all the good that every man shall do. shall be
for him self / and all the evil also. And each man shall have for one good
thing / an hondreed good things / and for one evil an hundred euellis / For
he is a much fool that weneth to do god any bounte of his goodys in any
maniere that it be / And when he absteneth him fro doing evil. so much our
lord holds him the derrer. and loves him the better. For if he lost all
the world. Our lord should never be the less worth. ne none of the goodys that been in his power / if all the saints that ever here to fore in the world or
ever shall be / had never don good / And that all by her demerytes were
perpetuelly dampened in hell. yet for all that our lord god should never have
the less Joy ne consolacion. And should not be the less worth. ne no thing
that is in heaven / But the saints were wise prudent. and constaunt for to do
well and prouffyt / as they that plainly knew that this world is not but a
vayn thing and transsitoyre. And had much lever to suffer pains and
trauaylles / and offer their bodies to tourment and martirdom and to have
shames / blasphemies and other Iniuryes for the love of our lord in this
miserable world that so lytyl while endures / And to have the goods of heaven
everlasting. than to have ease chaungeable to the body / for to have pain
perdurable / They retched not ne had no charge of such goodys that at last
should be of no value / But they took the bridle by the teeth for to get the
right hye wit and understanding of heaven. And there ben many of them that
hol^e them for foolys in this world / the which now at this time have their
neekys charged. of which the other be deliueryd. For they ben herberowed in
heaven / And yet hold they many a wise man for fool that preyse not much their
words. There ben plente of wise people in heaven now / that if they had preysed
the foolissh dictes or sayngis And the folishe werkys of the people that so
much coueyte the honouyr and loos of this world for the word of foles. that
they had left the commandments of god / In which the saints in heaven did
gretely their deuoyr / For they left not for the delytes of the world to serve
their maker and creator for to get heaven where they have Joy and all honor
as they that been lords and shall ben without end / And if they had done
otherwise they should have perpetuelly shame fylthe and tourmentis of hell
where as ben all the euyllys that man can deuyse. It is much great marvel
of this world how that it is so. that there ben so much people that will suffer
pain and trauaylle more for to get loos of the people or for to amasse great
tresours. the which so lytyl time abide with hem / that in an one hour fayll /
than they will do for to conquer the goods of our lord the which shall
never fayll. which the blyssyd saints have gotten by a lytyl hard life that
they have endured in this world that me seems but a right delight to them that
of good heart do it / And in thend^it seems to them. that for litil or naught
they have gotten heaven / and all thus may every person get it. and be common
of the goods of our lord and have the Joys and glory of heaven / if the
defaulte be not in hem self. But they that desire the Joys the glory and
henours of this world / they empayre them self so much that they may not learn
no good ne entende to their sauacion / And had much lever the ease and
consolations of the body of which they ben so sone put out. and brought to
sorrow and pain than they do the ease of the soul which endures without
end / Ne they preyse not the wit ne entendeme^t of the man if he can not well
have him in the world and have plente of temporal goods. by which he may be
enhaunsed and lift up in the world / but say he is nyce and folissh by cause
he can not know their malyces and cawteles But all they ben cursed of god by
the mouth of david the prophet that so pain them to plese the world by all
the ways that they can do / For such pride is vain thing by which ye
soul is enpayred / of whom david says in the psaulter accursid be all they
and confused / as people of exyle that playse the world / For of all goods
they extend them and discord fro god and fro his love / Sith they have given
them and that they accord them to the world to his vanytees and delytes. For
god has them all in despyte / and put them fro his grace / by cause they seche
ye loos and the glory. of the world / In which he was put out and set a
back and in the end crucyfyed and helden for a fool. Thus says our lord god in
his gospel / that all they shall be blyssyd that have the world in despyte /
And shall be as people hated defowled and cast out as foles for the love of me
and of my name / For they shall have in heaven their reward and guerdon / And
this may every man see if god him self lie not / And truth may not be false /
that they which plese the world / and will have and take the loos and glory
of the world / it may not be but they after have sorrow. Therefore he is a fool
that secheth to have it by cause all they that weeshe or pourchace it. be evil
counseyled / For all such manner of people ben by the devil led in to hell
where they have a right sorouful guerdon / And there is nowher so valiant a
king ne so puyssau^te prince / duk. earl. knight. or noble man to whom the
devil has regard but that he do to him as much gryef to his power / as to
the most vile and most pour that comes into hell / when he has so used his
days and life that he is fallen in his hands / For all they that been dampened
for to goo theder of what estat that they be. ben called rybauldis For he might
have conquered in heaven more noble and more worthy Royamme than is in this world
/ For who that in this world serves our lord unto the death / he is more
honored in heaven than all the kings that ever were in this world that so
lityl endures with us / Now serve we him then and leave we the evil / the
glory and ye vanyte of this world / Sith then that hereto fore we have
devised how and wherefore god has created the world and wherefore he made man /
we shall deuyse to you herafter the form of ye world and the facyon after that
it conteyneth and compryseth / and how it is made and composed round about.
But it is expedyent that to fore this we speak of the vij Arts lyberal and of
their resons. And how they were founden by them that apperceyued the sciences
and virtues. For by the vij. Arts ben known the faytes of the world / And how
it is set. And therefore we owe now to speak thereof for to understand the
better that we shall say here after.

Wherefore and how the seven Arts liberal were fou^den and of their order /
Capitulo / vo.
NOw declared this book which is drawn out of Astronomye how sometime the
notable and wise philosophers would enquere of the manner of the world / and how
hit had been created and made of god. whereof much people meruaylled / And
then when the world was made and compassed / there was people ynowhe / of
which many beheld the firmament / that turned round about the world and
meuyd they had great meruaylle how it might be made / And they waked and
studied many nyghtes and many days. Then began they to behold the sterres
that roos in the eest. and meuyd about over their hedes Certainly these
philosophers apetyted not these great mangeryes ne. delycyous wynes ne for to
fylle their belyes as don beestis that seche nothing but their pasture like as
this day do they that retche of nothing but to fylle their pau^che with good
wynes and good vitaylles and after to have a fair bed / white shetes and
soft / And there to sleep as the swyne / but those were wakyng and studienge
many nyghtes and it grieved them not. but they were embelysshid much of that
they saw the fyrmament thus turn and so nobly to hold his course and terms
/ Thus saw they the sterres meue till they went down in the weste. sum on
that one side. and sum on that other side / And sum sonner than the other /
Thus beheld the prudent me^ philosophers and other about the firmament till it
was day yt they saw the son show and reyse in the morning read and clear
which ascended and mounted half the day / And that other half descended so
long till he went under which made the night tapproche / and then came again
the sterres in the night in their course till the son came again and enlumyned
the day / and held his way and course till that he repaired on ye morn in to
his pryncypal place. After they beheld the moon. which was a comune thing
and apered to the world dyuersely. One time she mas round. another time half.
and after horned / and so went and becam such as noman might see her / And
after she appeared horned and sith half as she had been to fore / and also round
and full. Then knew they well by their entendement that she approached the
son till she was even against him. and after departed / And after she wythdrewe
her more and more till that she was under the son as she had been to fore. And
then she went and came again every night and tornyng and making her course
about the firmament. right as she now does with out any thing changyng the
contrary. But now as said is the people that been now think more / And ben
much more curyous of their great and fat paunches for to fylle / and to make
them fat. by which they come the sonner to their end and to carayn^ and by
their over much norysshyng and vylaynous. which delyuereth them first to
trauaylle and after to shame and dampnacyon. The ancient faders governed them
not in this wise / For they setted not by mete and drink / but for to taledge
their hungre and thirst for to sustain their bodies and tobolee hem in health
in such wise as they might help them self by their wits / as they ought to
do for to come to the glory of our lord / And that time they lived xx or xxx
year longer than they do now of an honderd one / And that proceeds of their
folissh and outrageous governance / Certainly such people understand not well
the word of our lord when he said to the devil wha^ he came to tempte him and
said that he should make of the stones bread and that he should ete / Then
Ihesu Christ answered. that man lived not only by bread / but by the word that
proceeds fro the mouth of god if the men in these days understood well this
word / they would reteyne more gladly the doctrynes that proceed and come fro
the mouth of our creator and maker But the great rentes that they have. and
the great tresours of their coffres ben cause of shortyng and abredgyng of
their days. by their disordynat mangeries that ouermoche noye and grieve them.
so that nature may not well bear ne sustain / whereof the must needs the
sonner render their soul and deye. Thus their rentes / their tresours or other
thing wherein they delight them / take away their life their heart / and their
wit all attones. In such wise that when death comes and must needs dye /
they have lost wit and understanding / of whom many ben deed and dampened /
which at their need may not be cou^seylled ne can not help them self / wha^
they have most need / they live not like them that for to keep them fro
perilles studied in sciences and used their life in such manner that they would
but sustain their body only as long as they should be in this world. as they
that well knew that this life should not to them long endure / And had envy at
none other thing. but only for to learn such science by which they might
know the souerayn king allmyghty that all has created of naught and made it
with his hand. Then they thought in their entendement as people that was of
noble and virtuous entencio^ that they should never have knowleche of our lord
god ne of so hye might but if they intended and serched in his works which
they fond so excellent. And as great as they might enquere and know. For men
shall never well know the maystre. but if before me^ know par^yghtly his estate
and what his works ben / For by the werkys is the werkeman known. and how he
may be such one / And therefore the ancient faders would employe them and assaye
the werkys of our lord / And first for to have knowleche of his power and his
virtue. Considering that they might not ocupye them self in a more digne ne
worthy science ne more diffycyle. And when the more that they knew of his
werkys and of his wysedom / somoche more had they the better will to love her
creator and maker / and to honor him consyderyng that he had made so noble a
thing and so worthy as is the heaven in which ben ye sterres that shine bright
therein / and his other meruayllous virtues which they preysed much. For how
much more they presed him / somoche with good will they served him. For it
was all their affeccion. Intencion and reason to know god / for as much as
they knew certainli that god had given to them with nature wit and rayson
for to search and compryse of things of therthe. and of them of heaven as much
as they might know. For otherwise they might never have thought it / Thus a
man be he never so wise ne discrete / may never come for to understand the hye
secrets of god ne of his miracles / but by him for by right he knows al But
of them that by nature be made and ordained in heaven and in earth / man may well
enquere sum resons if it be given him and that he be garnisshed of good quyk
wit And that be have set and employed his time to study and to learn / And
since they had gotten understanding and rayson by their great estudye labor and
trauayll / somoche that they might compryse wherefore and how all the world was
made and compassed as ye have herd here to fore / So thought they then / that
they might well know and have reason of sum things since they had the
understanding of him that is almighty to know in party or at lest of such
as they might se with their eyes. how well that they were far. Thus would they
know the reason of that. that they saw so meue the sterres of the firmament
and of them that shone so clear. Certainly this was the princyial cause whi
first they put them to study for tenquere the science that they knew not. And
knew well that they should enquere sonner of things that they saw than of them
that they saw not / And therefore were they meuyd for to know and tenquere the
science which they knew not of that they had often seen ye firmament to meue /
and would know the troth And said it was right good to know it / If it
pleasyd god / and to know of his naturel works. for the more parfightly to
believe and know how he was god all mighty / for men could not know ne find
no resons of god but only by his werkis / The good ancient wise men / which
dylygenly would understand this matter / had no cure for to amasse none other
goods / but only to learn the pure science. they were not covetous / ne set
not to gadre tresours / and there were plente of them that apperceyued as wise
men yt it was a great charge to them oftymes as well to keep it / as to spend
it by mesure as in other ways to get it and bring it to gydre / And that
all this was a lettyng to them for to learn. And they delyberyd emonge them
and concluded that sum cast and threw their tresour in to the sea. The
other gaf it away and abandonned to them that would take it. and went as
heremytes. And the other departed it to pour people. And other there were that
left their good in such wise as them seemed that they should hauelasse cause to
think thereon. and retained nothing but only for their use / And held with hem
certain folk to serve them to the end only that they should entende to nothing
but to study and to learn / They did do edefye their houses fro the people
like as relygeous people and set them in such places that thries or four
times the weke they might assemble and come to gydre for to solace them and
sport / and there each rendered his reason of that he had found and learned /
And so long did they thus till they had experymented which was true. and who
knew most and that they had found who had most grettest entendement / And
him they chose by consent of them all for maystre. And he recorded their
resons heryng all the felawys / and reherced to them all to gydre that every
man had said / In this manner were ye clergyes first fou^den contryued and
auau^ced. and so much trauaylled and studied that they knew by the help of
our lord of whom all science grows and haboundeth great party of that it
is. But this was not in lytyl time. For they were long in study and
understood much / And they that were first. all that they understood and
knew. they put it in writing the best wise they could. to the end that they
that should come after them. and would entremete in conning might have their
wrytynges and trauaylle allway in the science as they had don before All that
they found and saw / they set in compylacyons / And did so much each in
his time that they were more than.ij.M. and CCCC. year er they by their labors
and contynuel studyes had gotten the vij. arts or sciences liberal and put to
gydre. but they held their labor well employed and the pain that they put
thereto / For they knew by their wit and by their clergy / all that was
come on earth by nature / when they would set there cure thereon. And also were
not abashed when a merueyllous caas happed on heaven or on earth / for they
could well enquere the reason wherefore it was and since that it happed by nature /
And so loved god much ye more when they saw such meruayllous werkis. And
watched many nyghtes with right great Joy and great study of this that they
saw fond so hye works by which they amended them self against our lord that
they knew troth. and left the vanyte of this world / that so lytyl is worth
for to come to ye Joy that never shall faylle / Of whom plente of wise
philosophers that were in the world deyde wrongfully and without reason / by
cause they shewde rightfully to the great lords / and gaf them fair examples
in repreuyng and myspreysyng their evil tyrannyes and thextorsions that they
did to much people. And preched to them right and troth. and thoo that would
not believe them and had shame of that they were of them blamed / they made them
to be put in their prysons / where they made them to deye by grievous tourmentes
by cause they showed to them ye troth whereof they were certain / like as was
don to holy saints that suffered death and passion for the love of Ihu crist
whom they would enhaunse. so were there such philosophers that by their wit
and understanding prophesied the holy time of the coming of Ihu crist like as
virgyle said which was in the time of Cezar at rome / by which plente of
people have been better sith / than they were before / For he said that a new
lygnage was enjoyed fro heaven on high that should do virtues in earth by whom
the devil should be ouercomen / Upon which saint poul that saw this scripture
which he much preysed / said with a sorrowful heart for so much as he had
not ben christian. Ha that I should have ren / dred and yelden yt to god if thou
had lived / and that I had come to the. Other philosophers there were of
whom euerich said good words and meruayllous. But we may not now reherce
all the good things that they said For they were prudent all and valyant.
seen that they set to fore all other things clergy / For if it were not by
clergy / men should not know that god were / And if they had not ben so
prudent men as they were there had never be so great clergy as is now / And if
there were now such as they were then that found first clergy / It should
be other wise than it now is / But clergy goth now all to noght that almost it
is perysshid. For in thise days ye people sees not by cause that they that
ought understand virtues and to teache other and enseyne and give example to
do well they ben they that recule and wythdrawe fro it. And all this proceeds
by their folly / For noman holds clergy for virtue. ne he loves it not ne
applies it in all points. But many there ben that sechen the lies and drestys
/ and leave the clear wyn / For noman lerneth ne secheth now / but for to conne
so much that he might conquer and get the money / And when they have gotten
and largely assemblyd thereof / then ben they werse than they were a fore /
For the money has so surprysed them that they may entende to none other
thing. There ben plente of pour clerks that gladly would learn if they had the
power / But they may not entende thereto. by cause they have not whereof for to
furnysshe them of their necessytees as well for to have books as mete drink
and clothes But ben constrained for to get their living other wise / for the
rich have now in thise days seized somoche / that the pour abide naked and
must suffer. yet ben there plente of rich clerkis that have books without
nombre of one and other richely adoubed and couerd to the end that they ben
holden for wise and good clerks / For they seche to have no more. but only the
loos and preysing of the people / And dooo in like wise as the Cock that
shrapeth in the duste for to find pasture. he shrapeth so long in the duste
and mulle till he find a gemme rich and precious which shines clear / then
he be gynneth to look thereon and beholds it / and does no more but late it
lie / For he demands not after the ouche or gemme / but had leueyr have sum
corn to ete / In like wise is it of many of these not wise clerkys covetous
that have the precious books richely lymned storyed and well adoubed. that do
nothing but look and behold them without forth while they be new by cause
them seem that they ben fair / and so they behold them gladly and pass
therwyth / and after they torn on that other side and think for to fylle
their belyes. and to come to their folyssh desires / and they might learn
enough if they would entende it. For they have well the power. and might do as
the wise men did herto fore / the which by their trauayl study and dylyge^ce
fond first the clergyes. but they have their entendeme^t folyssh and out of
the way / And therefore the sciences and arts perysshe in such wise that
uneath and with great pain know they their parts of reason which is the
first book of gramayre. the which is the first of the seven sciences / But
put their arts in their males / and goo learn anon the laws or decretals /
and become advocates and iuristes for to amasse and gadre always money wherein
the devil conforteth hem / and yet do they not somoche for to learn / as they
do for to fylle their purses / In Paris / Oxenford and Cambrydge is there
such manner of clerks that been acustomed to will have the renomme and fame to
be called maystres for to be the more preysed and honored / And have lever to
conne little and to have the name of maystre. than they should be good clerks
without having the degree and name of maystre. But they be called maystres
wrongfully / For vanyte maystryeth them in such wise that they can but lytyl
truth. because that they have so sone the name of maystre they leave the
clergy / And take them to the wynnyng / like as merchants do and brokers /
And in this wise ben many in the world that have the name of maystre. that
know right lytyl of good and reason / For they that now desire this ben not
maystres after right. for they ordeyne them otherwise to the sciences than they
did that fond them first. They entered first in to gramayre for to draw reason
in their ordinance and after logique for to preue and show the troth fro the
false. After they fond rethorique for to speak fair in judgment and right
which they much loved and after arsmetrique for to be expert in all things
After they found geometrye for to mesure and compass all maistrye and after
the found they science of musyque for to set al things in co^cordau^ce /
after they had ye understanding of astronomye. for thereby were they meuyd to
have science and virtue. In this manner ye may understand how they ye first
found science ordained the vij arts or vij sciences. and they ben in such
wise entrelaced that they may not be auctorised that one without that other ne
entierly preysed. And also the first may not be perfyghtly co^ned without the
last / ne the last without the first / and he that will learn one a right and
understand it. him behooves to learn all the other / ffor other wise may not
be known apertly the certain / ne the incertayn / For that one is so comune to
that other that it behooves to know of all. but now men seche to learn no more
but the art for to get the money / and ben to blame of that the other were
preysed that first so trauaylled of which it is to us so great need / For
lytyl should we have known if we had not seen it by writing / For as it is to
fore said / if clergy had be lost we had known nothing ne who had be god / ne
men should never have known / what thing had been best to do. and so should all
ye world have been dampened then had we ben born in an evil hour For the men
had known no more than dombe beestis / and all the good things ben now known
and all comen of ye seven sciences that the philosophers fond sometime by
their wits / For thereby had they understanding to love god and his virtues /
And ye god is always and shall be wythouten end. and so byleued they in great
faith truly in the ancient law / But in these days the sciences perisshe by
our enuyes detractions and other euylles in such wise that right lytyl is
retained of one and other / For now dar no man entende but for richesse / For
^^yssayers felons and enuyous men that will learn no good. and if they see any
entende to sciences and clergyes. and they be not rich and mighty for to
furnysse hem / the rich men will anon scorn and mocque them / and thus will the
devil exhort them yt is their master and their lord and to whom it pleseth
that they myssaye in so much as he shall reward them with great hyre that they
shall be sure to have all evil adventures in hell that stynketh where they shall
mock them self and shall say that they were born in an evil hour wha^ they
have not learned yt they ought to learn / there shall they have more prouffyt of
their sciences / ye loved better to co^quere clergy tha^ the fool to co^ne
know to assemble ye great tresours and ye great richesses / and know ye that
all they that for to get wordely goods left their time for to learn good /
ben all assured to have evil and pain after their death. for by their auaryce
and cheuau^ce the sciences come to naught. so that almost they be perisshid.
and that which now is known. comes and grows of the vnyusitees of paris
oxenford and cambrige and other etc

Of three manner of people and how clergy came first in to the royamme of
ffraunce / Capitulo vjo.
NOw regneth clergy much strongely in ffraunce in the cite of paris as
sometime was in ye ^yte of athenes which then was much noble and puyssau^t /
The philosophers that then were / and which that ought to teache and learn
other / acompted but three manner of people in the world after their
understanding / and that were clerks. knights and laborers. The laborers
ought to pourueye for ye clerks and knights such things as were nedeful for
them to live by in the world honestly / and the knights ought to defend the
clerkis and the laborers that there were no wrong don to them. And the clerkis
ought to enseygne and teache these two manner of people / and to adresse them in
their werkis in such wise that none do thing by which he should displese god
ne lose his grace. Thus setted sometime the wise philosophers three manner of
people in ye world / as they that knew / That no man might set his courage in
that he might be wise a right in two manners or three / For it happed never day
of ye world that clergy cheualrye and laborers of therthe might be well
known by one only man in all his life ne learned ne retained / therefore he that
would learn byhoueth him / only to learn one of the three. and therefore ye
philosophers set three manner of people without moo in the earth. for they
would seche the very truth / And sought a cite in the world. where they might
best be and dwell for tenquere thestate of the clergy. and thus the better
for tadresse them / and to teache other they chees the cite of athenes which
was noble and sometime one where they had their common resydence and assemble.
And there reigned first chiualrye with clergy / and after fro thens it went to
rome / which now is of great renomme. And there cheualrye continued long / And
frothens after it remeuyd into ffraunce / where chyualrye has more power than
any other place in the world. And thus haboundeth there that one and that other
/ For chiualrye sieweth always clergy where she goth. then the king of
france and of England may be joyous that there is in his royames such
seignourye as is science of clergy where every man may draw out wit and
connyng humayn. and there abides never the less. For it is as a fontayn that
contynuelly sourdeth and springs. And the more it renneth and the ferther.
the more it is holsom. and how more the spring of the fontayn renneth and
ferther somoche is the more of the water. and the more may be taken fro it for
need / In like wise may I say to you / that paris Oxenford and Cambryge ben
the fontayns where men may draw out most science and more in paris than in
other places / and sith it is so that clergy is so much auaunced in
france. Then ought to know by reason in especyall if the heirs of ffraunce
daygne to conne it. For like as the son is moist fair of all the sterres.
and causes most good things to grow in the world by the bounte that
habou^deth in him. so ought the king be of more valewe than any other. and to
have more understanding and clergy / that so by his valyaunce and suffysaunce
he might shine emo^ge other people / and by thexemple of his well doing that
they see in him they might by right conduyte draw them to our lord and in
such wise should he be king by right in this world / and in heaven / so then
should it be well right and rayson that they do their dyligence to learn such
clergy and science. that after this mortal life they lose not the seignorye of
heaven. For by nature and lyg^age ought they all to love clergy and always to
learn it certes the emperor of almaygne louyd with al his heart clergy / And
auau^ced it to his power in ffraunce / And all the good clerkys that he could
find he retained them to his court. and sent for them oueral where he knew
any. he had in his time many a trauayll / many a pain / and many a danger and
ennoye for to mayntene and enhau^ce christian faith. And therefore he never left
/ but held the

THe first of the vij sciences is gramayre / of which for ye time that is now.
is not known the fourth part without which science sykerly all other
sciences in especial ben of lytyl recomme^dacion by cause without gramayre there
may none prouffyte. For gram^yre is the fondement and the beginning of
clergy. and it is the yate by the which in thenfancye is begone and in
contynnyng men come and atteyne to sapience of clergy. this is the science to
form the speech be it in latin frenshe or englissh or in any other langage ye
me^ speak with. and who that could all gramayre he couthe make and construe
eueri word. and pronounce it by exemple god made the world by wor^e / and the
word is to ye world sentence

Here follows of logyke ca. viij
THe second science is logike which is called dyaletyque This science proves
the. pro. and the. contra / That is to say the veryte or truth / and other
wise / And it preueth whereby shall be known the true fro the false / and the
good fro the evil. So verily that for the good was created heaven and maad. and
on the contrary wise for the evil was hell maad and establysshyd which is
horrible stynkyng and redoubtable /

Hier speaks of Rethoryque. Capitulo / ixo.
THe therde of the vij. sciences is callid rethoryque which co^teineth in
substance / rightwysnes rayson and ordinance of words / and ought not to be
holden for folly / For the droytes and laws by which the Iugeme^ts be made
and that by rayson and after right ben kept and mayntened in the court of
kings of princes and of barons come and proceed of rethoryque / Of this
science were extrayt and drawn the laws and decrees which by need serve in
all causes / and in all rightes and droytes / Who well knew the science of
rethoryque. he should know the right and the wrong / For to do wrong to
another who so does it / is lost and dampened / and for to do right and reason
to every man. he is saved and geteth the love of god his creator /

Here follows arsmetryque and whereof it proceeds / ca / xo.
THe fourth science is called arsmetrique this science comes after rethoryque
/ and is set in the myddle of the vij sciences / And without her may none of
the vij sciences parfyghtly ne weel and entierly be known wherefore it is
expedyent that it be well known and conned For all the sciences take of it
their substance in such wise that without her they may not be / And for this
reason was she set in the myddle of the vij sciences. and there holds her
nombre. For fro her proceed al manners of nombres And in all things run
comme and goo. And no thing is without nombre / But few perceive how this may
be. but if he have be maystre of the vij Arts so long that he can truly say
the truth / But we may not now recompte ne declare all the causes wherefore /
For who that would dispute upon such works him behooved despute and know many
things and much of the gloss who that knew well the science of arsmetryque
he might see thordynaunce of all thynesby ordynaunceg was the world made and
created. And by ordinance of the souerayn it shall be deffeted /

Next follows the science of Geometrye / Capitulo / xjo.
THe fifthe is called geometry the which more avails to astronomye than any
of the vij other. For by her is compassed and mesured Astronomye Thus is by
geometrye mesured all thyngis where there is mesure by geometrye / may be known
the course of ye sterres which alleway go and meue / And the gretenes of the
firmament of the son of the moon and of the earth. By geometrye may be known
all things and also the quantyte they may not be so far if they may be sen
or espied with eye but it may be known / who well understood geometrye he might
mesure in all maystryes. for by mesure was the world made and all things hye*
low and deep /

here followed of musyque. Capitulo / xijo.
THe syxthe of the vij sciences is called musyque. the which fourmeth him of
arsmetryque / Of this science of musyque comes all attemperaunce / And of
this art proceeds sum phsisyque / For like as music accords all things
that dycorde in them / and remain them to co^cordau^ce. right so in like wise
trauaylleth phisyque to bring nature to point that disnatureth in man's body
/ when any maladye or sekenes encombreth hit. But phisique is not of the nombre
of the vij sciences of philosophy / But it is a maestier or a craft that
ente^deth to ye health of man's body and for to preserve it fro all maladyes
and sickness as long as the life is in the body. and therefore it is not
liberal / For it serves to hele man's body / which else oftentimes might
lightly perysshe. and there is nothing liberal ne free that grows of therthe /
and for as much as science that serves to man's body leseth his franchise.
but science that serves to the soul deserves in the world to have name
liberal. for ye soul ought to be liberal as thing that is of noble being as
she that comes of god / and to god will and ought return. and therefore ben
the vij sciences liberal / for they make the soul al free. and on that other
part / they teache and enseygne all that in every thing ought proprely to be don
/ and this is the very reason why these arts all vij ben called vij sciences
liberal / For they make the soul liberal / and deliver it fro all evil / Of
this art is musyque thus comune / that she accords her to euerich so well
that by her the vij sciences were set in concord that they yet endure / by
this science of musyque ben extrayt and drawn all the songs that been songen
in holy church and all the accordau^ces of all ye instruments that have
diverse accordes and dyuse sownes. and where there is reason and entendement of
sum things / Certes who can well the science of musyque / he knows the
accordaunce of all things / And all the creatures that pain them to do
well remain them to concordaunce /

Here speaks of Astronomye. Capitulo. xiijo.
The vij and the last of the vij sciences lyberall is astronomy Which is of
all clergy the end by this science may and ought to be inquired of things
of heaven and of therthe / and in especyall of them that been made by nature /
how far that they be / And who knows well and understands astronomye / he
can set reason in all things. For our creator made all things by reason
and gaf his name to every thing / By this art and science were first emprysed
and gotten all other sciences of decrees and of dyuinyte / by which all
crystiante is co^uted to the right faith of our lord god to love him / and to
serve ye king almighty. fro whom all goods come and to whom they return /
which made all astronomye. and heaven and earth / the son / ye moan and the
sterres. as he that is the very rewler and governor of all the world / and he
that is the very reffuge of all creatures. For without his playsir nothing may
endure. Certes he is the very Astronomyer. For he knows all the good and the
badde as he him self that composed astronomye. that sometime was so strongly
freque^ted and was holden for a right hye work. for it is a science of so
noble being. that who ye might have ye parfayt science thereof he might well
know how ye world was compassed and plente of their parcyal sciences / for it
is ye science above all other by which all manner of things ben known the
better / by the science of astronomye only. were fou^den all the other.vj. to
fore named / and without them may none know a right astronomye / be he neu so
sage ne mighty / In like wise as an hamer or an other tool of a mason ben the
instruments by which he forms his work. and by which he does his craft /
In like wise by right maistrye ben the other / the instruments and fondements
of astronomye. and the ancient wysemen as kings / princes. dukes / earls
knights and other great lords by their understanding great trauayl / estudye.
and by the hye co^duyte that was in them set by good manner al their pain
and labor to learn and know ye sciences and arts of clergy for to
understood the science of astronomye / and so long they trauaylled that by the
will of our lord they learned and knew enough. for they knew plente of great
affairs and works that happened in ye world. and they preysed nothing tho
things that were erthely. as they that knew well the resons thereof / And that
time was the custom that if a man were bond / to one or moo. or if he were
comen of litil extraction. and were rich and full of great goods. yet durst
he not estudye in the vij sciences liberal / For the nobles and hye men that
in all points would reteyne them pryncypal and to the end that they were free
and liberal / and by this reason they put thereto for name the vij arts or
sciences liberal / for they ben so fre / that they ^endre to god the soul all
free / and they ben so well to point that there may nothing be taken away. ne
nothing put to. how well if any would or could meddle therewith thaugh he were a
good clerk and expert / For if they were turned or changed any thing that
might be. all should be disfygured by cause they ben so resonabli and truly
composed / that that there is noma^ living in the world. be he never of so much
and profou^de science / be he paynem Jew or christian that may any thing or can
change torn / ne take away ne defowle it in any manner. and who that parfyghtly
knew the vij arts. he should be byleuid in all laws / for there is noma^ yt
could interrupte him of any thing that he would preue. were it true or otherwise
/ by cause he should preue by quyck reason all that he would were it wrong or
right Then is he a fool that thinks to know perfyghtly any thing that
appeteyneth to clergy / By what mestere or craft that may come to him but if
it be by miracle of god that all may do. if he can none of the vij sciences /
for otherwise all his trauaylle should be of no valewe ne he should not conne
show thing of recomme^dacio^ ne preue by right the pro. and contra. Therefore
the vij sciences ben byleued in all the laws. there as they ben red / And there
is noman be he never of so diverse a law ne of diuse langage that if he
converse with people that can nothing of the vij sciences ne preue of their
vsages ne of their parts that shall be bileuyd for expert and wise / Ne there
shall never be Paynem ne sarasyn so much diverse / that a Criste^ man or a Jew
may wythsaye him of things that he will aledge or preue / And the decretals ne
the laws be not evil / thaugh sum people hold evil the co^stitucions that been emonge them because that other do them and holden / For all the laws
depend of the vij sciences / And all men believe them and reteyne them. there
where as people know them. And all resons that proceed of the vij sciences
ben true in all causes and in all places. Thus ben not the sciences muable /
but allewaye ben estable and true Herwyth I deporte me to speak more to you
hereof / For there is enough here of tofore made ample mention / And now I shall
reherce to you here after of thaccidentes and of the faytes of nature and that
shall be short / for god created nature altherfirst. and tofore he created any
other thing that apperteyned to the world. and we ought to fore all other
work say and declare what she is / for to deuyse after and descryue of the
world / For the firmament torneth and meueth by nature / and in like wise do
all ye things that have meuyng / Nature meueth the sterres and makes them to
shine and grow and also may anoye and grieve as much as she will. and by
cause all men understand not well what this follows in substance / we shall
declare a lytyl our matere a long / for to give the better vndestondyng what
nature is / and how she werketh to the end that more fully ye may compryse the
facion of the world by this that herafter shall be to you declared. if ye will
well understand the resons / And therefore give ye dylygence for to compryse
them and well to reteyne them /

Here follows of nature / how she werketh and what she is Capitulo / xiiijo.
OVre lord god created alther first nature / for she is the thing by which
all creatures and other works have dured and live what someuer they be
ordained of god under ye heaven / without nature may nothing grow / And by her
have all things created life / and therefore behooves nature to be the first /
For she noryssheth and entertieneth all creatures. and habondonneth her self
where it pleseth the creator or maker / Nature werkyth in like wise when she is
employed. as does the axe of a carpenter. when he employeth it in his work.
For the axe does nothing but cut. And he that holds it addressyth it to
what part he will so that in the end by the axe the work is achieuyd and made
after thentente of the werker. right so nature makes ready and habandonneth
where as god will For all things ben made by her. and entiertiened as god
will make them / and she werketh after this in such manner. that if she lack
on one side she recouerith it on that other nature forms nothing in vayn /
But she werketh in such manner that she takes away fro nothing his plain / For
her work is always hool after that she fyndeth matere / be i^ in persons or in
beestes / Then ben her works above all other to be recomended as she that
does nothing that in any wise may be contrary to god / But where as ma^er
lac^keth she leueth to work / and alleway somoche there is more of matter
somoche more she werketh. as men see of sum beestis. of which sum have two
heedes and vj feet / or it has a member less than he ought to have. of which
he abides without very form naturell / and many be called therefore a
mo^stre. also men see otherwhile some that almost lack all and other that have
plente and habondau^ce in their faites all in like wise falls often and is
seen happen upon some men the which when they ben born / they have vj fyngres
on one hand / and other that have one or ij or iij less than they should have /
or them lacks an hole membre / by which they be of less valewe of that /
that apperteyneth to the world and in an other shall be so great habondau^ce of
nature or matere in body or in member that he has other thing than form
humayn sets / for him lacks a foot or a hand / Or he shall be born sometime
more or less / or he shall have a leg more longer or shorter or an arm than
ye other. yet there is another thing which ought not to be forgoten. For that
one shall be born black or broun. and that other white. one great and another
little. that one shall happen to be wise and dyscrete and that other folissh or
shrewyssh so^me be wise and sad in their yongthe. and in their age ben often
folissh so^me be soles young and old / And other ben wise all their lyff young
and old sum be fat / and so^me be lene. sum ben se^k and so^me ben hoole
some be sklendre. and so^me be thyk so^me be hard and rude / and so^me be
soft and tender so^me be slow and so^me be hasty so^me be hardy and so^me be
cowardys. so^me be lame. haltyng and crooked so^me ben well fourmed in all
rightis and points / A great man is often evil made / and a lytyl man is often
well made and auenau^t / for there is no membre but it be well made and
aperteynyng to his body / A fair child oftymes in his growyng becomes fowl /
So^me will have their wylles / and other desire it but lytyl. euerich has his
talente and his apetyte. a lytyl man enge^dreth often a great man / and a great
man often getyth a lityl one* a lytyl man otherwhile empriseth to do a great
thing that right a great man will not emprise / So^me deye lightly and other
live long / and so^me live aslonge till age make them to give over the world /
after that / that nature endures to them by ye will of god. also it is seen
often emo^gemen that so^me entende to clergy. and other give them to other
style of science and craft as of carpenter mason smyth or any other craft in
which he employed his time. For euy man gives him self gladly to that which
his ente^deme^t is enclyned to and to other craft or science than nature and
understanding gives him to / he shall never perfyghtly understand ne so well
meddle with all as he should to that which his propre nature gives him to /
there ben yet other manner of people that set and give them self to do many
things that other may not ne can not do. for asmoche as their nature has not
given it to them / for so^me prete^de to hye estates and great richesses / and
other ben content with lityl estate. and it happeth often that a man comes to
that where he prete^deth and other can not come thereto. but torneth contrary
to them and to their dommage / and often with great pain may they come to their
above / of ye thing yt they would acco^plysshe. and other do and make plente of
things. that so^me can not ne may not do ne make / For in the persons ben so
many dyuersetees and facions not like and of wylles that men shall not find in
any contree of the world two men that parfyghtly be like / who far they can
seche / but that they be diverse in so^me cas. or of body or of members or of
entendement or of the vysage or of their sayngis or of their faytes or deeds /
For the puyssau^ce of nature is so diverse / that there is nothing that has
growyng but that she has upon it might in such wise that she gives to one
sum thing that another has not in him / how be it that noman can perceive
any dystau^ce / Such is the virtue of nature where plente of clerks have
sometime set their entendement and cure and have strongely labored to the end
that they might better declare the fayte and puissance of nature / And first of
all says Plato which was a man of great renomme / that nature is an over
puyssau^ce or might in things that she makes to grow like by like after that
/ that euerych may be. and this may be understand by one man that engenders
another. and by beestes by plants and by seeds the which after their
semblaunces grow and aftyr their facion. And lo this is that that the wise
platon says which was a great clerk / After him says aristole / that this
was a yefte comen fro the hye prince. When he gaf virtue to the firmament and to
the sterres for to meue and to be / And that without god such power ne might
not be given / as the things that have power to remeue to be and to meue /
Aristotle that says this studied in many a book treatyng of nature. Many
other philosophers there were that said that nature proceeded of virtues of hete
which causes all things to grow and nourisshe. But for this present time I
pass over for to speak of other matere Tho philosophers ensiewen better plato
than Arystotle. Thus said they that them seems. and they spack so hye like as
before is said. that few clerks might atteyne to come thereto / and for to
abredge it. he is not that might parfyghtly know what it is / sauf god that al
knows and that all sees / And that first would establysshe for taccomplyssh
all things / herby may well be known that god is of much great puyssau^ce /
And it is of him a right great thing when he of naught and without trauayll
created and fourmed so excellent a thing and so hye and noble awerke. And
therefore would he him self create and make man to ye end that he might be so
mighty and have such wit and understanding in him self that he knew by
nature that which might grieve him in his soul. and live unto our lord. for if
he will Justly and rightfully conduyte him self. he may well bring his heart
to that. that nature shall not mow grieve him in no manner. And therefore were
fou^den the vij sciences or arts. For to take away the evil thoughts that
might bring a man to the death. which they may destroy by the sciences. And
thus may one change his evil estate / by the techynges of a good maystre. and
therefore it is good for to haunte emonge the virtuous men / For there men may
learn and prouffyte in diverse manners. Thus then is he wise that is prudent
in such manner that after his death he has the better / and that god receives
him in gree Thus than he shall have done more for his owen prouffyt than for an
other. This knew all men certainly. For he shall resseyue all the weel. And
much is he a fooll that somoche louy^ his body that he forgeteth to save his
soul. Which god has lent to him pure and clean to the end that he should
render it such again at his death. And that he govern him not in such wise
that by his culpe and defawte defowle him in sins / he that so conduyteth him
self does in like wise as the evil servant did / to whom the maystre
delyuerd his besau^tes for to multyplye in good But he did not justly as he
that was of evil faith wherefore the maystre seeing the untruth of him chaced
him away fro him And ever after he had shame and reproach like as the gospel
witnesses and to us wherceth / All in likewise shall it be of them that leave
the good grayn / for the chaff / these ben they that suffer their souls to
perisshe for ye playsance of their bodies / of which all euylles come to them
herwyth for this present I leave the declaracion of the vij sciences and of
nature / and purpose by the grace of god to deuyse the facion of the world how
it is by nature made and pourtrayed of god / which of one only will created
and formed the world and all that is thereof appendant. Now entende ye to this
that we say to you /

Of the form of the firmament Capitulo / xvo.
GOd fourmed the world all round. like as is a pelette / the which is all
round. and he made the heaven all round which enuyroneth and goth round
about the earth on all parties holy without any defaulte all in like wise
as the shelle of an egg that enuyronneth the whytte all about. And so the
heaven goth round about an air / which is above thayer the which in latin
is called Hester / this is as much to say as pure air and clean / For it was
made of pure and of clear purete / This air shyneth night and day of
resplenduer perpetuel / And is so clear and shynyng that if a man were abydyng
in that part / he should see all one thing and other And all that is fro on
end to the other also lightly or more as a man should do here byneth upon the
earth there only length of a foot or less yet if he had need. All in like
wise I say to you. who that were there he might see al about him as well far
as nyghe. the air is so clear and net / Of this hester thangels taken their
bodies and their wings / when our lord god sends them in message hither low
in to therthe to his friends. When he will show to them any thing. And
therefore seem they to be so clear to sinful men in this world / that their
eyes may not suffer the resplendour ne behold the great clerenes as they that been full of obscurte and derknes / that is to say of sins and of inyquytees
of which they ben replenesshid / And it happeth oftymes. that when angels ben
comen to any man in any place by the will of god for to say and show their
messaye / that whiles thangele speaks to him He falls to ground as he were
a sleep or in a trau^ce / and him seems he hereth not the word of thangele
but as he dremed / And is muet without spekyng / unto the time that thangele
repayreth again. Then when he is awaked / and comen again to him self / he
remembryd well the saying of thangele / and what he had showed to him. Thus I
say you for truth that no bodyly man. may not sustain for to see him in no
manner / for so much as a man is made of heavy matere / Ne no bird ne foul be
he never so strong ne so well fleyng may not suffer to be there. but that him
behooves to come down as soon as a stone. till that he come in to thayer where
he may repryse his fleyng / if he were not abashed to descend. for there may
nothing abide. but if it be thing espirytuell / ne may not live there / For
no more than the fysshe may live in this air where we ben in ne sustain him /
but right soon must dye / and shortly perysshe. but if he be contynuelly
nouryssed in the water. All in likewise I say you of us / For we may not meue
in this air perpetuell ne live ne dwell there as long as we have the body
mortal /

How the four Elements ben set / Capitulo / xvjo.
THis clerenesse of which we have spoken. which is called air spyrytuell /
And where the angels take their array and atourement enuyronneth all about the
world / the four elementis which god created and set that one with in that
other / Of which that one is the ffyre / The second is thayer. The third is
the water. And the fourth is therthe / Of which that one is fastened in that
other. And that one sustained that other in such manner as therthe holds him
in the myddle. The fire which is the first / encloseth this air / in which
we be / And this air encloseth the water after the which holds him all
about the earth. All in like wise as is seen of an egg and as the white
encloseth the yolke / And in the myddle of the yolke is also as it were a drope
of greece which holds on no part / And the drope of greece which is in the
myddle / holds on neither part / By such and semblable regard is the earth
set in the myddle of heaven so just and so egally. that as fer is the earth
fro heaven fro above as fro bynethe For whersomeuer thou be upon therthe thou
art like far fro heaven. like as ye may see the point of a compass which is
set in the myddle of the cercle / that is to say. that it is set in the
lowest place / For of all fourmes that be made in the compaas / always the
point is lowest in the myddle / And thus ben the four Elements set that one
within that other so that the earth is always in the myddle / For as much space
is always the heaven from under earth as it appiereth from a boue This figure
following on that other side of the leef shows ye understanding thereof. and
deuyseth it plainly / and therefore ye may take heed thereto /

How the earth holds her right in the myddle of the world Capitulo. xvijo.
FOr as much as therthe is heavy more than any other of thelementis / therefore
she holds her more in the myddle. and that / which is most heavy abides
about her / for the thing / which most weyeth. draws most lowest / And
all that is heavy draws thereto / And therefore behooves us to Join to the
earth / and all that is extrayt of therthe / if so were / and might so happene
/ that there were nothing upon therthe / watre ne other thing that let and
trobled the way. what someuer pate that a man would he might goo round about
therthe / were it man or beeste above and under. which part that he would like
as a fly goth round about a round apple In like wise might a man goo round
about therthe as far as therthe dureth by nature. all about so that he
sheld come under us / And it should seem to him that we were under him / like as
to us he should seem under us for he should hold his feet against our / And the
heed towad heaven / no more ne less as we do here and the feet toward therthe.
And if he went always forth his way to fore him he should goo so far that he
should come again to the place fro whens he first departed. And if it were so
that by adventure two men departed that one fro that other And that one went
alleway toward the eest / and that other toward the weste / so that both two
went egally / it behooved that they should mete again in the opposite place fro
where as they departed. And both two should come again to the place. fro whens
they meued first / For then had that one and that other go on round about
the earth above and under / like round about a whele that were stylle on
therthe in like wise should they goo about therthe. as they that contynuelly
drew them right toward ye myddle of therthe for she fastneth all heavy thing
toward her / and that most weyeth most draws and most ner holds toward the
myddle / For who much depper one delueth in therthe. so much heuyer shall he
find it and for to understand this that j have devised to you here to fore of
the goynges of the flies about thapple. and of the me^ about therthe In like
wise may ye see all the manner and facion by these two figures y^ which ben
here to you represented and shewde all entierly / dij.

BBut for to understand the better and more clerly conceive / ye may
understand by another ensample if the earth were departed right in the myddle
in such wise that the heaven might be seen through / And if one threw a stone
or an heavy plomette of leed that well weyed when it should come in the myddle and
half way through of therthe / there right should it abide and hold him for it
might nether goo lower ne arise hyer. But if it were that by the force of the
great heyght it might by the might of the weight in falling fall more depper
than the myddle. but anon / it should arise again in such wise that it should
abide in the myddle of therthe / ne never after should meue thens / For then
should it be egally ouerall under the firmament which torneth night and day /
And by the virtue and might of his tornyng nothing may approach to it that is
poysant and heavy / But wythdraweth always under it / of which ye may see the
nature and understanding by this present figure. on that other side /

ANd if there the were perced through in ij places of which that one hole were
cut i^ to ye other like a cross and four me^ stoden right at the four
hedes of thise ij hooles one / above / and a another bineth. and in like wise on
both sides and that each of them threw a stone in to the hoole whether it
were great or lytyl each stone should come in to the myddle of therthe. without
ever to be remeuyd fro thens. But if it were drawn away by force / and they
should holden them one about another for to take place eueryche in the myddle
of therthe and if the stones were of like weight. they should come thereto all
at one time as soon ye one as that other / For nature would suffer it none other
wise. and that one should come against another as ye may ANd if their weight and
plainly see by this figure powers were not egall fro the place fro whens they
should fall / that which were most heavy / yt should sonnest come to the myddle
of therthe. and other should be al about her as this second figure shows
plainly on that other side / ANd so much may be cast therein that the hooles
may be full like as they were to fore / as ye may playnli see in this figure.
which shows to you the plain troth now this suffyseth ynouh hereof / and
here after we shall speak of other things /

What ye rou^denes of the earth is. ca. xviijo.
NOw then ne plese it you to here for to deuyse plainly to you how the earth is
round. Who that might mou^te on hye in thayer and how that might behold by
valeyes and by playnes the hyenes of the great montaynes / and the great and
deep valeyes ye great wawes of the Sea and ye great flodes they should seem
less tappere unto the gretnes of the earth than should an here of a man do
upon an apple. or under his figure / For nether montayne ne valeye. how someuer
hye ne deep it be takes not away fro therthe his roundenesse no more than the
galle leueth to be round for his prickys / For it behooves the earth to be
round. For to amasse the more people. and we shall say to you here after how
the world must needs be round /

Wherefore god made the world al round. Caplo. xixo.
GOd fourmed the world al round / For of all the fourmes that be / of what
diverse manners they be / may none be so plenere ne resseyue so much by nature.
as may ye figure round. For that is the most ample of all fygures that ye may
take example by. For there is none so wise ne so subtle in all things ne
somoche can understand that may for any thing make a vessel be it of wood or
of stone / or of metal that may be so ample ne that may hold within it so
much i^ right quantite as shall do the round / Ne figure that any may make may
so sone meue ne so lightly make his torn to goo about. that any man can
understand. but that it must take other place than this to fore / sauf only
the round which may meue round without taking other place / for she may have
non other than the first. Ne pass one only ligne or ray fro the place where
she holds her in whereof ye may see the nature by a figure squared set
within a round or another which is not round And make them both to torn. the
corners of them that been not round shall take dyuerce places that the round
secheth not / And that may ye see by these iij. fygures in one which ben here
/ of which that one is round all about and that other tweyne ye may see
squared /

YEt is there another thing that there is no thing under heaven enclosed of what
diverse facion it be / that may so lightly meue by nature as may the round /
And therefore god made the world round. to this end that it might best be
filled on all parties For he will leave nothing void / and will that it torn
day and night For it behooves to have meuyng on the heaven. which makes all
to meue For all meuynges come fro heaven. therefore it behooves lightly and
swyftly to meue. And without it there is nothing may meue /

Of the meuynges of heaven and of the vij planetes and of the lytylnes of
therthe unto the regard of heaven. Caplo. xx
OWr lord god gaf meuyng unto the heaven / which goth so swyftly and so
appertly / that noman can co^pryse in his thought. but it seems not to us for
his gretenes / no more than it should seem to a man. if he saw fro far an
horse rennyng upon a great montayne it should not seem to him that he went ne
only paas / And for somoche as he should be most far fro him somoche the
less / should he seem to goo / And the heaven is so much hye and far above
us that if a stone were in thayer as hye as the sterres be / And were the most
heuyest of all the world of leed or of metal / And began to fall fro an hye
above this thing is proved and known. That it should not come to therthe till
the end of an hundred year so much and far is the heaven fro us. The which is
so great. that all the earth round about has nothing of gretenes ayest ye
heaven no more than has the point or prick in the myddle of the most great
co^paas that may be ne to the grettest cercle that may be made on therthe / And
if a man were above in heaven / and beheld and looked here down in the earth /
And that all the earth were brennynge all in cooles flammyng and lyghted. it
should seem to him more little / than the lest sterre / that is above seems to
us here in therthe / thawh we were on a montayne or in a valeye / and therefore
it may well be known. that the heaven must lightly meue. when it makes his
torn and goth round about therthe in a day and a night / like as we may
apperceyue by the son / that men see in the morning arise in thoryent or in
the eest / and goth down in the west / and on the morn erly we see him come
again in the eest / For then he has performed his course round about
therth. which we call a day naturel / the which conteyneth in him day and
night Thus goth and comes the son the which never shall have rest / ne
never shall fynysshe to goo with the heaven. like as the nail that is fyxed in
the whele. the which torneth when she torneth. But by cause that it has
meuyng against the course or tornynge of the fyrmament / We shall say to you
another reason / if a fly went round about a whele that went round itself.
And that the fly went against it / The whele should bring the fly with her /
And so should it fall that the whele should have made many tornes / whylis that
the fly should make one torn. and er she had gone round about the whele unto
the first point / So ye must understand that in such manner gone the moon and
the son. by away that is comune to the vij planetes that been on the heaven /
which all goo by the same way alleway toward the eest / and the heaven torneth
toward the weste. like as nature ledeth him / Thus and herwyth the first party
takes his end of this present book. And shall follow for to deuyse of the
second party of therthe and of the form of the firmament /

Thus ends the first party of this present book /
Here after bygynneth the second party of this present book. and declares
how therthe is divided and what party she is enhabyted / Capitulo primo.
Sith that the earth is so lytyl as ye have herd here to fore devised lytyl
may we preyse the goods thereof unto the regard of heaven. less than men do
donge against fin gold. or against precious stones / how well that in the end that
one and that other shall be of no walewe. but for somoche as we being in this
world us seems that the earth is much great we have declared to you as well
the rou^denesse as the gretenes to our power and that shortly. sith we have
understand how the earth is round on all parts as an apple. Nevertheless it
is not enhabyted in all parties which is well known. of no people of the
world / And it is not enhabyted but in one quarter only like as the
philosophers have enserched / which put for to know it great trauayll and
estudye and therefore we shall deuyse it al about in four parties / of which
ye may take ensample by an apple / which shall be parted by the myddle in four
parties right of length and of bread by the core / and pare a quarter. and
stratche the parell for to se and understood the facion in plain earth or in
your hand /

ANd in ye end of this line / Like as she gooth right by line / We may see a
cite which is called Aron it is set in ye myddle of ye world. and was made
all round there was fou^de^ first astronomye by great study / by great
maistrye / and by great dylyge^ce / This place Aaron is named ye right mydday
as she that is set in ye myddle of ye world that other heed of this line.
which gooth right toward the lift side. is called septentrion that is to say
north and takes his name of the vij sterres / and torneth toward another
sterre that ledeth the maronners by the sea / In that other line that is ye
myddle / which the south cutteth in the end toward the eest as the auctours
say is paradis terrestre. where adam was in sometime This place is called
oryent that is to say eest For fro thens comes the son which makes the
day about ye world. And that other heed is called occydent that is to say
weste. For there the day faylleth and wexith derke when the son goth down
there. thus and by this reason be nam^d the four parties of the world of which
the first co^teineth the eest. The second the west The therde the south. And
the fourth the north. and this that we ens^ygne you ye may see by this figure
to fore on that other side

These four parties that I have declared to you. which ben set in a quarter
of all the earth of the world ought to have a round form / For rayson and
nature give that all the world be round / And therefore understand ye of
this quarter as it were all round Now make we then of this quarter a cercle
that is al round and al h^ol / and late us set in ye middle of this line yt
shows ye eest and ye west for to set the parties in her right as this
prese^te figure yt here is represe^teth shows to you plainli

AFter late each party be turned toward his name in therthe / of which each
shall be the fourth part / and this present figure is enseygnement and
demonstrau^ce certain and true without any varyacyon ne doubtaunce.

What part of therthe is in hahyted Caplo. ijo.
All the earth yt is the world enhabyted is divided in three parties. and
therefore it behooves by this reason to make an other dyuysion. Of which ye
party toward orient is called Asia ye great And takes the name of a queen
that sometime was lady of this regyon and was called asia this party named asia
holds and conteyneth as much space as doethe other tweyne. And therefore it is
called Asia the great and dureth fro the north unto ye south like as this
figure shewyth /

That other part is called europe. and takes his name of akynge called europes
/ the which was lord of this contre / and therefore it was so called. And it
endures fro the weste unto the north. and marches unto Asie the great / that
other part is affryque which stratcheth fro the south unto ye west and
affryque has his name of helbe / and is as much to say as born away like as
this figure deuyseth in iij. parties of which figure this is the demonstrance
/

OF these three parties of the world here tofore named holden euerych many
regyons and many coutreees / of which or at the least of ye most noble party
we shall declare the names / and how the bestes that been there ben most comynly
called. Thus we shall say to you the condycions and fourmes of sum / and in
especial of them that been most seen by men / And first we shall speak of the
people of the contrees / And after of the bestes and fisshes like as the book
dyuyseth to us out of which is drawn this Map mundi /

First of paradis terrestre. and of the four great flodes that depart fro
thens / Capitulo / iijo.
THe first regyon of Asia the great is paradys terrestre. This is a place
which is full of solace / of playsances and of delyces / so that none that is
therein may be greuyd ne have none evil in no manner of the world. In this
paradys is the tree of life / and who that had eten of the fruit. he should not
deye as long as the world endures. But noman living may come theder / but if
our lord god or his angele conduyted and brought him theder. For all round
about / it is enclosed wyw fire brennyng the which goth flammyng unto ye
clouds There wythinne sourdeth and spryngeth a fontayne or well which is
divided in to four flodes / Of whom that one is called vngages that renneth a
long through the royame of Inde And departs in to many arms or braces. It
sourdeth of the mount that is called Ortobares / the which is toward thorient
/ and falls in to the sea Occyan / The second of ye four flodes is named
gyon. or nylus / Which enters in to therthe by an hool. and renneth under the
earth so far that it resourdeth in to the long see / which enuyronneth all
Ethiope so that it departs in to vij parties / and goth rennyng by egypt so
long that it comes and falls in to ye great see / The other two flodes of
which that one is callid Tygris. and that other eufrates sourden in hermenye
nygh unto amoche great montayne which is named partheacus And these two flodes
trauerse many great contrees so lon till they mete in the sea moyen where both
two fall inn like as their nature requires On this side paradys terrestre
all about ben ^^ny diverse places without any resort For none may dwell
there ne find place to live in / But there be plente of evil beestis which
ben fires and crymynel and of many guyses there ben. There ben geau^tes rowh and
heery which devour and ete all thing as wulues don. And many other wild
beestes.

Here speaks of ynde and of things that be found therein / Capitulo iiijo.
AFter comen the contrees of Inde which take their name of a water that is
called Inde / which sourdeth in the north. The Indes ben closed with the great
see that enuyronneth them round about. In Inde is an isle named Probane wherein
ben founded ten cytees and plente of other towns. where as every year ben two
summers and two wynters / And ben so attemprid that there is always verdure / and
upon the trees ben contynuelly flowers l^euis and fruit And it is much
plentuous of gold and silver and much fertyle of other things / There be the
great montaynes of gold and of precious stones and other richesses plente / but
noman dar approach it for the dragons and for the gryffons wild which have
bodies of lions / fleyng which easily bear a man away armed and syttyng upon
his horse When he may sease him with his claws and vngles there ben yet plente
of other places so delectable so sweet and so spirituel that if a man were there
in / he should say / that it were a very paradys /

Here follows the dyuersitees being in ye land of Inde Capitulo / vo.
THere is in the land of Inde a right great montayne that men call mount
capyen / and it is a much grette regyon / There ben a manner of people without
wit and without discrescyon / Which the king Alysander enclosed therein /
And ben named goths and magoths or gog or magog / they ete flessh all raw be
it men or wymyn or beestes as men wood / mad or demonyacks / This Inde of
which I you reheree conteyneth xiiij regyons / and in euerich of thise regyons
ben much people / And also there is therein great trees and so hye that they
towche the clouds / And there dwells people that been horned / and ar but two
cubits hye / And they goon to gydre in great companyes For often they fight
against the cranes / which them assaylle / But with in vij year they become
aged and old that they deye for age / This people is called pygmans / and ben
as lytyl as dwarfes / right nygh unto this contree grows pepre all whytte /
But the vermyne is there so great that when thyy would gadre and take it they
must set fire therein for to drive away the vermyne / And when it is so brent
/ the pepre is founden al black soorchid and crispe / ye ben there other
people which ben called groyne and bragman which ben fayrer than they to fore
named / that for to save another life. will put them in to a brennyng fire /
There is yet another manner of people / ye which when their faders and moders or
their other friends ben passing old and eaged. they slay them and sacryfye
them / be it wrong or right and eten their flesh and hold them for meschau^t
and nygardis that so do not to their friends / For they hold this manner among
them for great well great worship / and for great largess / And therefore each
of them use it / Toward ye ^est is another manner of people that worship the
son only and takes it for their god for the great goods that come there by.
And by cause that in all the world they see none so fair a thing to their
semyng / they believe in it as their god. Yet ben there other people that been all
rough / which eten fysshe all raw and drink water of the salt see / Toward
this same contre is a manner of people that been half beestes and half men / yet
ben there in that party other people which have on one foot viij toes. In
these contrees is great nombre of beestes right dreadful and terryble / which
have bodies of men and heedes of dogs. And have so great vngles or claws
that areste all that they can hold and clothe them with the hydes and skynnes
of bestes. And have such manner of voys as barkyng of dogs. Yet ben there
other called Cyclopyens which pass by rennyng the wind. and have only but
one foot / of which the pla^te is so right long and so broad. that they
couere them there with fro the shadow. when the hete comes over sharp on them
/ Another manner people there is / which have only but one eye. and that
stands right in the myddys of the front or forhede which is so reed and so
clear that it seems properly fire brennyng. And there also ben found another
manner of people that have the vysage and the mouth in the myddle of their
breast / and have one eye in every sholdre. and their nose hangs down to
their mouth / And have brestles about their mosell like swyne. yet ben there
founden toward the river of ganges a manner of strange people and curtoys.
which have the right figure of a man. which live only by the odor and
smellyng of an apple only / And if they goo far in to any place. they have
need to have the apple with them / For if they feel any stenche evil and
stynekyng and have not thapple / they deye incontinent /

Of the serpents and of the beestes of Inde / Ca. vjo.
IN Inde ben plente of serpents. which ben of such force and might / that
they devour and take by strength the hertes and buckes. Yet there is another
manner beeste which is called Centyoore which has ye horn of an heart in the
myddle of his face / And has the breast and thyes like a lion / and has great
^eris and feet like an horse / And has a round mouth / his mosel is like the
heed of a Bear And his eyes ben nyghe that one that other / and his voys is
much like the voys of a man / Another beeste men find there much fyers.
which has the body of an horse / the heed of a wild boor. and the tayll of an
Olyphaunt. And he has two horns which eueriche is as long as a cubyte Of
which he set that one upon his back whiles he fights with that other. he
is black and a much terryble beeste and meruyellous delyuere / And is both in
watre and on the land / There ben also seen bollys which ben al white / They
have great hedes. and their throat is as wide and broad that it endures from
that one eere to that other and have horns that remeue about him so that
noma^ may tame ne dau^te them Another manner of beestes there is in Inde that been
called mantycora / and has visage of a man / and three huge great teeth in his
throat / he has eyes like a goot and body of a lion tayll of a Scorpyon and
voys of a serpente in such wise that by his sweet song he draws to him the
people and deuoureth them / And is more delyuerer to goo / than is a foul to
flee / There is also a manner of Oxen or buefs that have their feet all round and
have in the myddle of their front iij horns / Yet is there auother beeste of
much fair corsage or shappe of body which is called monotheres / which has
the body of an horse / and feet of an Olyfant / heed of an heart and voys clear
and hye and a great tail / And has but one horn / which is in the myddle of
his forhede. which is four foot long right and sharp like a sw^rd and
cuttyng like a rasour / And all that he atteyneth to fore him and towcheth is
broken and cut / for truth this beeste is of such condition that by what
someuer engyne he is taken / of great desdayn he suffers to be slain and deyd
/ But he may not be taken but by a pure vyrgyne which is set to fore him
where as he shall pass / the which must be well and gentely arrayed / Then
comes the beast unto the maid much symply / and slepeth in her lap / and
so he is taken slepyng / In Inde ben there other beestes great and fyers which
ben of blew colowr / and have clear spots on the body / and ben so right
strong and crymynel that no men dar approach them / and ben named tygris. and
they run so swyftly. and by so great might that the hunters may not escape
fro them in no wise. but if they take myrrours of glass and cast them in the
way where they shall run For the tygris ben of such nature / that wha^ they
see their semblaunce they wene that it be their fawnes then goon they about
the myrrours so long till they break the glass and see no more. in which while
the hunters escape fro them that been there. And sometime it happeth so of these
tygres that they think so long and behold their fygures that otherwhile they
ben taken so lokyng all quick and living Yet ben there other beestes which ben
called castours which have this nature in them. yt wha^ they ben honted for to
be taken. they byte with their teeth their own genytours or ballocks / and
let them fall / and thus they ghelde them self / For they well know. that for
none other thing they be hunted. Also the^ grows another be like a Mous /
and has a lytyl mouth and is named musk or muskaliet / In this contree ben
the dry trees that spoke to Alysa undre the puyssaunt king / Another beeste
there is that men call Salemandre which is fed and nourysshed in the fire /
This Salemandre bears wulle / of which is made cloth and gyrdles that may not
brenne in the fire There ben yet myes the which ben as great as cattes and also
swyft in rennyng / Toward thoryent ben the lions which have more strength and
might. in their breasts to fore and in all their members than any other beeste
have. And they come to feed their fawnes the iij day after they have fawned. as
they that were deed and ben as raised again from death and when they sleep they
hold their eyes open and when the hunters hunte them they cover the traas of
their feet with their taylle / They shall never do harm ne grief to man / but
if they ben angered / And when they be assaylled they deffende them / And when
he that keeps them beat and chastyseth a lytyl dog to fore them / they fere
and doubt him like as they knew him well and the lioness has the first year
five fawnes and every year after following one less unto her end so declynyng.
There is another beeste which is lytyl / and is so terryble and redoubted. that
no best dar approach it. and by nature the Lion doubts and flees from it /
For of it sleeth the lion / In this party conuerseth and repayreth another
best which is of diverse colors by spots whytte black. grene. blewe. and
Ielow like as it were painted / and is much propre and is called Panthere /
and there comes out of his mouth so sweet a savor and breeth / that the
beestes goo following after it for the swetenes of his body / sauf the serpent.
to whom the sweet smelle greueth in such wise that often the serpent deyeth /
and when this beeste is otherwhyle so filled and full of venyson that he has
taken and eten / He slepeth iij days hool without a wakyng / And when he
awaketh. he gives out of his mouth so sweet a savor and smelle / that anon
the bestes that feel it seche him / This be has but ones young fawnes / And
when she shall fawn. she has such destresse and anguyssh that she breketh
with her nails and renteth her matryce in such wise that her fawnes come out.
And never after when the matryce is rent and broken they engendre ne brenge
forth fawnes. There is a manner of mares that conceive of the wind / and ben in
a contre that is named Capydoce / but they endure not but iij year / In this
contre ben the Olyphaunts which is a be great strong and fyghtyng. And
when the sea their blodshedde to fore them. they be most corageous and most
strong and fight in all places and all bataylles upon this olyphaunts were
wont to fight the people of Inde and of perse / For an olyphaunt berett, well
a tour of wood upon his back fulle of men of arms when it is well set on and
fermely / And they have to fore them in manner of boyell great and large /
which they ete. by which they run on men / and have anon devoured them.
king alysandre which was a good clerk and prince of great recommendacion and
that went in to many contrees for to search and inquire ye adventures more
than he did to conquer then when he should fight against them that had taught
and learned tholyfauntes to fight in plain land / he did do make vessels of
copper in form of men / and did do fylle them with fire brennyng / and set
them to fore him to fight against them that were upon tholyfauntes / And when
tholyphauntes cast their boyel by which they slew the people upon the men of
copper / feelyng that they were so hoot that they brenned them / Then they
that were so taught would no more approach tho men for doubt of the fire / For
they thought / that all men had been as hoot. as they were of copper. which
were full of fire / And thus king Alysander as a sage prince eschewed the
paryll and danger of these olyphauntes. And conquered this wild people / and
in such wise dompted tholyophauntes that they durst do no more harm unto the
men. The olyphauntes goo much symply and accordyngly to gydre. And when they
mete and encountre each other They bow their hedes that one to that other like
as they entresalewed each other. They be right cold of nature / whereof it is
so that when one puts upon the tooth of yuorye a lynnen cloth and brennyng
cooles there upon the lynnen cloth shall not brenne / for as soon as the cool
feleth the cold he quenches the yuorye is so coold. the tooth of an olyfant is
yuorye / Tholyphaunts have never young fawnes but ones in long time / and they
bear them two year in their flanks / an olyphaunt lives ^CC year / He
doubts and fereth the wesel and the culeuure and dredeth vermyne / if the
culeuure clyue and be on ye olyphau^t. it departs not till it has slain him.
she fawneth her fawnes and hydeth them where is no wood and fawneth in the
water / For if she lay on therthe she should never arise ne releue / for as
much their bones ben al hool without Joints from the belly unto the feet / and
when tholyphaunt will sleep / he leneth unto a tree and there slepeth stondyng
/ And hunters that seche them and know the trees to which they lene when they
sleep / Then when they have founden them / they saw them low by the ground
almost a sondre / that when the olyphaunt comes and knows nothing thereof and
would sleep and leneth to the tree. and anon he falls with the tree unto the
ground and may not releue him self / Then he begins for to braye cry and
waylle. that sometime there come many olyphauntes to him for to help him / And
wha^ they may not redress and reyse him they cry and braye and make a
merueyllous sorrow / And they that been most lytyl and small goo about for to
lift and reyse him to their power in such wise that other while they lift
and reyse him up / but when they may not reyse ne releue him. they go on their
way wayllyng and making great sorrow and leave him / And the honters that been
embusshed by. come and by their engyns that they have propyce for the same take
him thus by this subtylte ben tholyphaunts taken / within the river and flode
of Inde named Ganges goon the eeles by great renges which ben CCC feet long
and ben good mete to ete at need Many other bestes peryllous and terryble ben
there in inde as dragons serpents and other diverse beestes which have feet
heedes / and taylles diverse / There ben the basylycocks which have the fight
so venymous that they slay all men And in like wise do they all fowls and
bestes. he has the heed like a cock and body of a serpent / he is king of
all serpents. like as the lion is king above all beestes. he is whytte rayed
here and there. There is neither herb ne fruit on the earth whereby he shall
pass / ne the trees yt ben planted but they shall perisshe. if he have byte or
slain beeste or other thing. Never other best dar approach it / There is in
this regyon another manner of serpents that have horns like a sheep / There
grows a be named aspis that may not be deceyuyd ne taken but by charmyng /
for he heeryth gladly y^ sown / But as soon as he heeryth the charm he puts
his tayll in his one eere / and that other leyeth to the gronude doubtyng to be
deceyuyd by ye charm / Other serpents there be named Tygrys which ben taken
all quyck by force of engyns. And of them men make triacle / Which deffeteth
and takes away other venym / Other worms there grow there which have two
arms so long and so diverse that they beat and slay the Olyphaunts This worm
lives right long / And when he is old and feleth him feeble / he consumes
him self by fasting / And suffers to be enfamyned so over much that lytyl
abides of his body / Then he goth in to a little hooll of sum stone which
is well strayt and then he puts him self out with so right great distress
/ that his shynne remains all hooll. And there grows and comes on him
another skin / And thus renews his age as a wise beeste that he is / There
ben plente of other serpents that have many precious stones in the hedes and in
the eyes / the which ben of right great virtue for them that might have them
and ^ere them / Now we shall deuyse to you of stones that grow in Inde and ben
there founden /

Here follows of precious stones and of their virtue which grow in Inde /
Capitulo vij
IN Inde grows the admond stone / which is a stone charged with many great
virtues / she by her nature draws to her iron and makes it to cleue to it so
fast that it may uneath be taken fro it for the virtue that is in it The dyamond
grows also in Inde al hool / and it may not be broken in pieces ne used / but
it be by ye virtue of the blod of a ghoot all hoot / yet grow there other
stones of many diverse facions and virtues the which ben of much noble
recomendacion reno^mee and of much fair virtue / and first I shall speak of the
Emerawde which is so playsaunt to the eye / that it reconforteth all the sight
of him that it beholds In like wise grows in Inde an other stone the which
is called carboncle. the which by night or if it be in derke place and obscure
/ it shyneth as a cole brennyng / Also there grow Sapphires which by their
virtue take away the swellyng and redenes of the eyes / There grows also a
stone called topace which is of color like unto fyn gold and also is of hye
virtue / yet also there grow there rubyes / which is a stone much preysed and
loved among the people / and is also of right more great valewre and virtue
than is the topace / he rejoices the sight and conforteth it much and
specially to them that bear it yet ben there also in Inde plente of other manner
stones which have in them much fair virtues and bountes / And who that will
more know of their virtues and bountes may read in the book called lapydare
in which he shall know the names and virtues / For now at this time we shall
make an end of this matter / for to recou^te you the contrees and royoames of
Inde /

Here follows of the contrees and Royames of Inde Capitulo / viijo.
IN Inde is plente of great contres merueyllously. which ben peopled with
diverse manners of people and of great plente of bestes of many diverse facions
and conditions / Emonge all other there is a contree named Perse and conteyneth
xxxiij regyons of which the first is the royame of Perse. where as a science
called. Nygromancye was first founden which science constrayneth the enemy
the fend to be taken and hold prisoner / In this contree grows a pese
which is so hoot it skaldeth the hands of them that hold it / and it growyth
with encresyng of the moon and with wanyng is descreceth at each time of his
^ours / It helps well to them that been nygromancyers After this royame is
another which is called Mesopotamye / wherein Nynyue a cite of great seynourye
and mighty is set and establysshid which is iij days Iourneyes of length
and is much large and brood. In babylone is a tour that sometime was made by
great pride of which the wallys ben meruayllously great strong / and hye and
is called the tour of babell / It is of heyght round about.iiij.M. paas unto
the highest / In the regyon of Caldee was first founden Astronomye / In this
regyon is the land of Saba / and thereby is the regyon of tharse / And after is
that of Arabie of these iij Regyons were lords and princes the three kings
that offryd to our lord savior Ihesu Christ gold / encence / and Myrre / That
time when he lay in the Crybbe after his blessed Natyuyte as he that was the
sone of god. And this knew they by their great wit and understanding of
Astronomye in which they were endowed and founded. In this regyon of Arabe
grows thencence and the myrre / And there ben therein many peoles and diverse
folk / There is also in Egypt a Regyon which is called assyrye / And the
regyon of fenyce is there which takes his name of a bird called fenyx / of
which in all the world is on this day but only one a live. and when he deyeth
anon grows another of him self. He is great and much fair of Corsage and
has a creste on his heed / like as the pecok has. The breast and the gorge of
him shyneth and draws toward the propre color of fyn gold / And he is
alonge the back also reed as a rose / And toward the tayll he is of the color
of asure like unto the heaven when it is pure and clear / and when he is old
and eaged he wythdraweth him unto an hye and merueyllous fair place / or
montaygne where as sourdeth a fontayne right great and large. and the water
fair and clear. and over the well grows a fair tree and great / which may
be seen fro ferce. and he makes upon this tree his neste and his sepulture
right in the myddle of the tree / But he makes it of spices of so right great
odor that there may be fou^den no better / And after he adressyth him in his
neste when he has all performed it. he then begins to meue and to beat
his wings against the son so fast and so long / that a great hete comes in
his feathers in such wise that it quykeneth of fire and brenneth al round
about his body that he is on a clear fire / And thus the fire brenneth and
consumes him all in to ashes / and out of theyse ashes and poulder grows
again another bird all living semblable to him After this regyon of fenyce is
the royame of Damas where as good truytes grow / And after Damas is founden
the regyon of Anthyoche where as be founden great plente of Camels / After
comes the contree of Palatyne / and after that Samarye. then sebaste. and
then Pentapolye where sometime were founded two mighty cytees that one called
Sodom and that other Gomor / the which god would they should perysshe for the
great and enorme sins that they commysed / on this parteis the deed see in
which is nothing that bears life / there is a contree that men call Ismaelyte
/ which is enhabyted by xij manner of people. and after this then is Egypt
the great where it never reyneth and conteyneth xxiiij peoples / another regyon
there is yt which comes toward the north in which there dwells noman / but
wymmen which ben as fyers as lions / And when need is they fight freely against
the men They go armed as knights in bataylle / and bring down their enemies
without sparynge / they have fair tresses of their here which hang down
byhynde them / And they be garnysshed with great prouesses in all their works
and affairs / And ben called Amazones / But they have men nyghe to their
contre dwelling / Whom they every year fetch for to be in their company viij
or xv days long and suffer them to know them carnelly so long that they
suppose that they have conceyuyd / and then depart the men fro that contre
And goon again thedyr that they come fro / and when these wymmen have childed.
if it be a daughter they reteyne her with them / And if it be a sone they
nourysshe it five or six year / and after send it out of the contree yet in
other places ben many fair ladies which in bataylles / and in estowes use all
their Arms of silver for lack of iron and of steell. of which they have not.
In the woods of Inde ben other wymmen the which have their berdes so long
that they come down to their pappes / They live by wild beestys / and clothe
them with the skynnes of the wyld beestis / and clothe them with the skynnes of
the same beestis / And there ben men and wymmen all naked and also rowhe as
beeres and ben dwelling in caves in the earth. And when they see other men they
hyde them in the caves so that they appear not out / Other people there ben
that been also rowhe as swyne and whynyng / And there ben other wymmen rowh also
like unto the men / but they ben much bestyall and white as snow / their
teeth ben more like unto hounds than to other and dwell and abide well in the
water / Another great regyon there is in which dwell xliij peoples. there ben
the birds which ben full of deduyte / of whom the pens shine by night like
unto fire. There ben popen gayes which ben grene and shynyng like pecoks which
ben but lytyl more than a Iaye / of whom as men say. they that have on each
foot five claws ben gentyl and the vylayns have but three. he has a tail
longer than a foot / and abecke courbed and a great tongue and forked / who
that might have one he might well learn him to speak in the space of ij year /
Another bird there is in this contre is named pellycane / and all hoor when he
leueth his chekens and comes again to find them as is of need / him seems
that they ben all deed / then he smyteth him self with his bylle in his
breast till that the blood spring out. whereof he reyseth again to life his
birds / In armenye is a manner of people that have al their here whytte. In
these parties is a much hye montayne where upon the ark of Noah abood and
rested after the flood was passed / After comes the prouynce of Inde the less
which is all enuyronned with the sea wherein ben many regions of whom for this
present time we will not declare the names / In this prouynce of Asie is the
Regyon of dardane. And the contre of ffrygye in to which paris when he had
rauisshed helayne brought her to wherefore the puyssaunte cite of Troy the great
was at thempryse of the greeks destroyed by fire and glayue / This cite was
set at one of thendes of greece / In thise party is set the noble cite of
lychaonye / And nyghe to the same stondeth another Cite called Cayer by which
renneth the great flood name herme of which the grauel is of gold all shynyng
/ Fro this part toward the end of egypt comes to us the payllole which is of
fyn gold. There is toward thoryent on that other side a manner of people that
sometime descended fro the Jews. and ben people of their condycion vile. fowl /
and stynkyng. they have no wives wedded ne hold no concubynes ne other for as
much as they may not believe that wymmen may hold them to one man only without
to double them with other / And therefore they set no store by wymmen / but
only yt they may have generation / Another manner of peoole there ben in this
prouynce which ben called barbaryns / and ben also called Iacobyns. For Jacob
was au^cyenly their maystre and ben Christian men corrumped by the maryages and
alyau^ces that they do and make with the sarasyns which on that one side
march on them / These barbaryns pourpryse well xl. royames / In no wise they
believe that confession be vayllable to show it to any man sauf to god only /
when they confess them to god they set by them fire and encence. And they
wene certainly that their thoughts goo up unto our lord in this fumee but it
is not so as they believe / but they mysbyleue saint Johan baptyste the which
first baptized them / For to fore all things they behooved to say their ^ynnes
to him self / And after they received of him baptesme / For saint Johan baptest
says him self that when one tells his sins to another that may be a sinner
as he is / this shame that he has to say his sins is turned to him instead
of penytence. and is to him allegiance of his sins / and him ought by reason
the sonner to absteyne him fro synnyng / seen that he must show them to
another man / By which he may have of our lord remyssyon and pardon of his
sins and inyquitees / this witnesses to us saint Johan baptist / the which
by the holy and blessed sacrament of baptism renders us quyte against our lord
god of our sins / And that we may be purged by very confession / good
contricion and full satisfaction euerich after his power / therefore these
Iacobyns ben grettely deceived / For they have evil retained the wholesome
doctrine that saint John baptist taught them / In this regyon is another manner
of people Christian that believe a lytyl better in god and ben strong and mighty
in bataylle / The sarasyns doubt them much And dar not mysdoo them / but ben
to them sweet and amyable. these people be named Georgyens / and ben good
christian men. And ben enclosed round about with feloun and mysbyleuyd people.
And they ben called as a fo^e is said georgyens. by cause they cry always on
saint george in battle in estours and in recountres against the sarasyns. And
also they worshipe and love him above all other seyntes / They have all
crowns shaven on their heedes / But the clerks have them round / and the
lay people have them square / when they go to Iherusalem for to worshipe the
holly sepulture of our lord Ihesus / The sarrasyns dar not take of them any
toll ne nothing hurt them by cause they doubt that when they come and
repair again they should abye it dear / The gentyl ladies of the contree /
Arm them and ride upon good horses rennyng and swyfte. and fight asprely in
the company of the knights of Georgye against ye sarasyns They use like laws
/ and like terms of speech as done the greeks /

Hier speaks of the fysshes that be founden in Inde. Capitulo / ixo.
IN the sea of Inde is a manner of fysshes that on their skynnes grow here so
long that the people make thereof robes mantellis and other vestimentys which
they were when they have taken and made them. Yet there is another manner of
fysshe in this see which ben named escimuz which ben no lengre that a foot
long / but they have such stre^gthe that in contyne^t that they touch a ship
one of them only reteyneth him stylle that he may not goo forward ne afterward
/ There is also another manner of fysshe that be comynly called dolphins. they
have acustome that wha^ they feel that the tempest shall come. and that the
ships ben in danger for to be lost and perisshid / they warn them out of
the watre and show and play on the wawes of the sea in such wise that
sometime they be plainly seen In this see of Inde is another fysshe so huge and
great that on his back growrth earth and grass. And seems proprely that it
is a great I Will / whereof it happeth sometime that the maronners sayllyng by this
see ben greatly deceived and abused / For they wene certainly that it be ferme
land. Wherefore they goo out of their ships thereon / and when they have made
their preparacions and their logys thereon and lyghted their fire and made it to
brenne after their need wenyng to be on a ferme land. but incontinent as this
merueyllous fysshe feleth the hete of the fire. he meueth him suddenly and
deualeth down in to the water as deep as he may / And thus all that is upon
him is lost in the sea And by this moyen. many ships ben drowned and
perisshid. and the people. when they supposed to have be in sauete / There is in
this see plente of other fysshe the which have heedes and bodies like unto a
maid / and have fair tresses made of their here / the shapp of their bodies
unto ye nauel is like a maid And the remenaunt is like the body and tayll of a
fysshe And sum have wings like fowls / And their song is so sweet and so
melodyous that it is meruaylle to here and they be called seraynes or
mermaydens. Of whom sum say that they be fisshes and other say that they be
fowls which flee by the sea. But take it a worth. For at this time I shall
deporte to speak more of this matter For to tell and recou^te to you of ye
meruayllous trees that grow in Inde / of which ben many diverse and bear
sondrely fruit / as here after al a long shall be declared to you /

Here follows of the trees that been in Inde and of their fruytes / Capitulo /
xo.
IN Inde grows a tree much great and right fair / and is much sweet
smellyng and is called palmyer / and bears dates / This fruit is good and
holsom / There ben also applet^^es the which ben full of long apples / which
ben of merueyllous good savor /

And they entretiene and cleue to gydre well an hundred in a clustre / and the
leaves that grow on this apple trees ben well two foot long / and a foot broad
/ Other apples there grow much great / wherein appiereth the bytte of a man
with his teeth / And ben called thapples of Adam by cause of ye bytte that
apiereth in them / there ben other trees which bear apples / that been right
fair without forth / And within it is as it were ashes. The vygnes bear there
grapes / of which wyn^ is maade. they ben so habondaunt of fruit / And ye
clustres of grapes ben so great and so full of must. that two men ben greatly
charged to bear one of them only upon acolestaf / Also there grow lytyl small
trees that be remeuyd every year the which bear cotoun. also there grow in
many places canes great and long which ben within forth full of sugre. so
much and especial that there grow none like in all the world / At one of
the heedes of the Royame of babylone grows the bame which is much dear /
and christian men that been prysonners there delue and labor the earth / And
sarasyns say that they hane often preuyd it / that when they do delue and
labor that earth with people of other nations than christian men that it bears
no fruit ne bame that year / And upon the field where the bame grows / some
say that there spryngeth a fontayne where the blessed vyrgyne Marie bayned her
sone Ihesus / And with the watre of this fontayne is the bame watered. and of
this water may not be employed ne born in to other place / For in substance it
does no more than other water. In this contre ben other trees the which instead of leaves bear wulle / of which is made cloth right fair and subtle / of
which thynhabytauns of the contree make them robes and mantellis for their
weryng / Yet ben there other trees that bear a fruit right sweet smellyng / But
this tree takes his fruit by night in him / and in the morning it comes out
again when the son is risen / There grow there plente of other trees / Of
whom the cooles when they ben a fire duryn in their ashes an hool year without
going out / or quenchyng or mynnyssyng / Also there grow plente of Cedres and
of lybans / the which as men say may not rote / other trees there grow much
glorious and right good which bear clowes / And other that bear notemygges /
And of the rynde and scorce is the canell or synamon / And also there grows
gynger / In this party grow the g^ode espyces of all manner haboundantly /
Also there grow notes great plente / which ben also great as great apples.
And other that been as great as the head of a man. To the regard of the trees
that been in paradys terrestre we know not what fruit they bring forth But it
is well known of ye tree / that / Eve had so great desire to ete above the
commandment of our lord god / and of which she deceived Adam our first fader
and in like wise is there the tree of life / of which we have spoken to fore
more largely. There ben in this noble paradis so many other tres bering fruit so
good and so delicyous that it seems that the glory of our lord be therein
ouerall / But there is a meruayllous watch and kepar / For the Angele of god is
kepar of thentre with a nakyd sword in his hand contynuelly brennyng to
the end that nomen ne bestes ne evil spirytes approach ne Auau^ce them for to
take in any wise there their delytes and playsaunces. and taccomplissh them
there within / And here with we make an end of this prupoos for to speak of the
contrees of europe and of the conditions /

Now follows of Europe and of his contrees. Ca. xjo.
Sith we have devised to you of Asye and of his contrees and regyons / I shall
say to you of Europe and his conditions shortly / For as much as we may often
here speak thereof / The first party of Europe is romanye and a part of
Constantynoble / Trapesonde / macedone / Thesalye / Boheme. Saxonye / Pyrre /
and a much holsom contre named Archade. In this contre sourdeth and springs
a fontayne in which men may not quench bre^nyng brondes / ne cooles on fire
and brennyng / In archade is a stone which in no wise may be quenchyd after it
is set a fire till it be all brent in to ashes. After archade is the Royame
of denmark. and then Hongrye. and sithe hosterich And then follows
germanye which we call Almayne which conteyneth a great pourprys toward
thocciden. In which pourprys ben many great and puyssaunt Royames / In
Allemayne sourdeth a great flood and ryuere named dunoe. the which stratcheth
unto in Constantynople. and there enters in to the sea / But erst it
trauerseth vij great floodes by his radour and rennyng / And as I have herd
say the head of this dunoe begins on one side of a montayne. and that other
side of the same montayne sourdeth another gtete river / Which is named the
Ryn and renneth through almayne by Basyle. strasburgh Magounce / Couelence
Coleyn / and nemyng / where fast by it departs in to iiij ryuers and renneth
through the lands of Cleue. ghelres. and holande and so in to the sea. And yet
er this river enter in to to see. he enters in to another river named the
Mase. and than loses he his name. and is called the mase / and xl mile long
in the sea / In europe is also swauen. basse Almayn. France / England /
scotland and Irlonde. And above thise many other contrees which endure unto
the mount Ius. and thus much space holds the party of Europe. Now shall we
deuyse to you how much Affryke conteyneth.

Here follows of affryke and of his regyons and contrees. Capitulo xijo.
AFter europe is Affryke of which the regyon of lybe is the first / This is a
land much rich. well pepled and strongly garnysshid. After comes the royamme
of Surrye. Iherusalem and the country about. This is the holy land where our
lord Ihu Christ receyuyd our humanyte and passion. and where he roos fro death to
life. after thoppynyon of sum is that this holy land longs to asye / After
then comes greece. cypres. cecyle / toscane / naples. lombardye. gascoyen /
spain. cateloyne / galyce. navarre. portyngal. and arago^ And how be it that
the auctour of this book say that thise contrees ben in Affryke / yet as I
understand all thise ben within the lymytes and bounds of europe / Also there
ben sum of these regyons and contrees that take their name of sum beestes
that dwell in the same lands / and the cytees have taken the fourmes / as
rome has the form of a lion / And troy the great of an horse etc. All
barbarye is in affryke and alysandre / and ethiope stratcheth unto the end of
affryke / In this contre of ethyope the people ben black for hete of the son.
For it is so hoot in this contre. that it seems that the earth should brenne.
beyond ethyope is no land but deserte / and land without bryngyng forth of
any fruit / but it is full of serpents of vermyne and of wild beestis which
land ends at the great see /

Here shall we speak of diverse Isles of the sea / Ca / xiij
Sith we have descryuid and uydesed the land. It is reason that we enqure of
the Isles of the sea. And in especial of them that we know the names of which
there ben plente in the sea. There is a much great isle called andos which is
toward europe / and sith is the isle of colchos. where the flies of gold was
found like as to us reherseth thystorye of Jason / There is another isle called
Maron In this isle was born the holy man saint denis which receyuid martirdom
in france / Toward asye the great ben the nombre of xliiij. There is one isle
named delos / this isle appiered first after noes flood / There is another which
is called meloth. and it is so called for the right great melodye that is herd
therein of sweet song of birds that been in this isle contynuelly in this I Will
grows plente of white marble / There is another isle in this contre that is
called psalmos in which the queen sebylle was born / the which prophesied of
many things of our lord Ihu christ long time before he was born of the virgyne
Marie / and she prophesied thise things at rome / where she was sent fore. In
this isle was first fou^den the manner to make pottes of earth / which ben yet
used in many contrees / In this isle was born a great phylosophre and a good
clercke named pictogoras / the which by his great entendement fond the
points and the difference or musyque. In affryke is also an isle in the sea
which is called sardayne. where an herb grows which is of such virtue
that if one ete of it he deyeth anon forth with all lawhing. Another isle there
is named bosut wherein is no serpent ne vermyne / And there is another which is
called colombyne. where as is great plente and foyson of vermyne and
meruayllous serpents / Yet there is another isle that is much long and right
broad that is called alleares / In this isle was first founden the manner of
meltyng of metals / Also there is the isle of Meroes the which at the myddle of
the day has no shadow. yet there is a pytte in this isle that by right nombre
and mesure is vij foot broad and an hundred foot deep / And the son shines
in to the bottom. Also there is another isle which is called Cylla where the
Cyclopyens were sometime. Another isle is in this contree so great as the wise
plato witnesses the which in his time was a clercke of right great renomme /
which has more of purpris and space than all europe and affryke conteynen /
But since the time of plato it was in such wise destroyed and broken like as it
ples^d our lord / that it sanke down in to Abisme for the great sins that
they commysed that were dwellers and habytau^ts therein / and is now the sea
right that is called bethee. Another isle is there the which may not be seen
when men would goo thereto / but some goo theder as men say / and it is called
the isle lost / This isle fond saint Brandon the which being therein on ferme
land saw and fond many meruaylles like as his legende conteyneth / and who
that will know it may vysite his legende and read it / In the marches
hetherward ben found many good yles / The isle of Cypre and of secyle there ben
and other plente that be founden in the sea / of which I now speak not / And
be not admeruaylled of such things as ye have founden w^eton in this boocke /
the which may seem to you much strange diverse and much dyffycyle to believe
/ for our lord god which is almighty maker and creator of all things And in
whom all goods and virtues ben. has made by his only will and playsir in
the earth many meruaylles and many works to be meruaylled on by cause that
noman knows by no way the resons wherefore / and therefore we ought not to
mysbyleue in no wise that we here read ne told of the meruaylles of the world
unto the time we know it be so or no. For ye works of our lord ben so hye and
to the men so diffycile and hard that every man may report him to that / that
it is / how well that a man does not much amys sometime to give no believe to
sum things wha^ he knows not the truth so that it be not in erryng
against the faith / For it is a good and proffytable thing to every man to
understand and reteyne to the end that he may learn / of which he be not
abashed when he hereth speak of such things. and can answer to the truth
/ For in like wise as to us seem great meruaylle of things that I here reherce
In like wise seems it to them that been fer fro us. that those things of these
contrees ben much diverse and strange / and meruaylle greatly by cause they
have lytyl seen of it. And therefore a man ought not to meruaylle if he bear
sometime any thing though he can not understand the reason / for alleway a man
ought to learn /

And there is noman that knows all sanf only god which all sees and all
knows / The geaunts that been in some place have right great meruaylle of this
that we be so lytyl against them / Like as we meruaylle of them that been half
less than we be / As it is tofore said / and they ben ye Pygmans which ben
but iij foot long. And in like wise meruaylle they of us* of that we ben so
great / and repute us also for geaunts / They that have but one eye and one
foot. have great meruaylle that we have tweyue / like as we do of them that
have but one / And also as we deuyse their bestis and name them by their names
in like wise deuyse they ours / by theires / both of body and of members / If
the centyoore have an foot of an horse / In like wise has the horse the foot of
a centyoore / Also we may well say that ye horse has the body of monotheros.
For they ben like corsayge. And thus their bestes resemble unto ours which
ben diverse of hedes of bodies and of members / as ours ben contrary to
theires /

Of dyuersitees that been in europe and in affryke / ca. xiiij
WE have in thise parties many things that they of Asye and of affryke have
none. There is toward Irlonde on the one side a manner of birds that flee and
they growe^ on trees and on old ship sides by the bylles / and when they be
nygh ripe / they that fall in the water live. and the other not they ben
called bernacles. Irla^d is a great Ilonde in which is no serpent ne venymous
beeste / and who that bears with him the earth of this isle in to another
contre and leyeth it where as venymous vermyne is. there anon it deyeth /
another ylonde is in Irlonde which stondeth far in the sea / where no wymmen
may dwell / and also the birds that been femalles may not abide there / There
is another isle wherein noma^ may dye in no time of the world. but when they ben
so old and feeble that their members faylle and ache and live with pain that
they may not help ne sustain them self / and that they had lever dye than
live. they do them to be born in to another isle and over the water for to dye.
and the trees that been in this isle keep their leaves grieve and in verdure all
times winter and somer. In another isle in Islonde the night endures vj
months. and then comes the day that dureth other vj months shynyng fair
and clear. Another place is in the same ylonde which brenneth night and day.
There is also in Irlonde a place called saint Patryks purgatory / which place
is perilous if any men goon therein and be not confessed and repentau^t of
their sins / They be anon rauysshid and lost in such wise that noman can
tell where they be come / And if they be confessyd and repentau^t / and that
they have done satisfaction and penance for their sins without that all be
cleansed and full satisfied thereafter shall they suffer pain and greef the
tormentis in passing this crymynel passage / And when he is returned again fro
this purgatory / Never shall no thing in this world plese him that he shall see
ner he shall never be Joyous ne glad ne shall not be seen lawhe. but shall be
contynuelly in wayllynges and wepynges for the sins that he has commysed.
hit may well be that of ancient time it has been thus as before is wreton as the
storye of Tundale and other witness / but I have spoken with diverse men that
have been therein / And that one of them was an hye chanon of waterford which
told me that he had been therein v. or vj times and he saw ne suffered no such
things he says that with processyon the relygyous men that been there bring
him in to the hool and shette the door after him. and than he walks groping
in to it where as he said ben places and manner of cowches to rest on / And
there he was all the night in co^templacion and prayer / and also slepte there
/ and on the morn he came out again / other while in their sleep so^me men have
meruayllous dremes and other thing saw he not / And in like wise told to me
a worshipful knight of brudgis named sir John / de banste that he had been
therein in like wise and see none other thing but as before is said / In
brytaygne that now is called England as is said is a fontaygne and a pyller or
a perron thereby / And when men take water of this well and cast it upon the
perron / anon it begins to rain and blow / thondre and lyghtne
meruayllously Also in france has been seen sometime a manner of people that have
be horned / toward the mou^tes of mount Ius / ye shall find plente of wymmen yt
have botches under the chyn^ which ha^ge down of some down to the pappes. and
they that have grettest ben holden for fairest / Other folk there ben that have
botches on their backs and ben crooked as crochettes. and they that see all
thise things often meruaylle but lytyl / also it is often seen that in this
contre ben born children deef and dombe. and also of them that have both
nature of man and woman yet ben there often seen so^me children comen in to this
world sum without hands and sum without arms /

Of the manner and condycion of beestes of these contrees / Capitulo. xvo.
THe fox is of such a condition that when he departs fro the wood and gooth
in to the feldes / there he lies down and stratcheth him on the ground as he
were deed for to take birds / When the heart will renew his age he eteth of
some venymous beeste / If the tode Crapault or spyn^^^ byte a man or woman /
they be in danger for to dye / It has be often seen / The spyttle of a man
fasting sleeth comynly the spyncoppe and the tode if it touch them if a wulf
and a man see that one that other fro far / He that is first seen becomes
anon a ferd / the wulf bears the sheep without hurtynge or greuyng of him
doubtyng that he would cry / and that he should not be followed / And after
deuoureth him when he has brought him to the wode / and if he be constrained
to leave him in his berynge He destrayneth him with all his might at his
departing The spyther or spyncop of his propre nature spynneth and weueth of
his entraylles the threde / of which he makes his nets for to take flies
which he eteth / when the she ape has two whelps or fawnes she loves that
one much better than that other / She beryth him that she loves best in her
arms / and that other she leteth goo / which wha^ she is hunted lepeth on the
moders back and holds her fast / And that other that she bears in her
arms / she leteth fall and is often constrained to save her self / Also it is
so that the hounde keeps the goods of his lord and maystre. And ben by him
warantes against men and bestes. And above all other he knows his lord and
maystre by his smellyng. and loves him of so right good love that often it
happeth be it right or wrong he will not forsake / his maystre unto the death.
And also he is so sorrowful for the death of his maystre / that other while he
loses his lyff In england in some place is there a manner of hounds that go on
and seche out the theuys. and brynge^ them fro thens where they fond them /
The muskele is a right lytyl beeste and sleeth the basylycock / and in long
fyghtyng byteth him out of mesure / She of her nature remeueth so often her
fawnes fro one place to another that with great pain they may uneath be
founden / The hyrchon when he fyndeth apples beten or blown down of a tree /
he waloweth on them till he. be chargyd and laden with the fruit styckyng on his
pryckes / And when he feleth him self laden as much as he may bear he gooth
his way with them syngyng and make his deduyt / And if he mete any beeste that
would do him harm. he reduyseth him self as round as a bowl / and hydeth his
groyne and his feet / and armeth him with his pryckes about his skin in
such wise that no beeste dar approach him doubtyng his pryckes The lamb
which never saw wulf / of his propre nature doubts and flees him / But he
doubts nothing other bestes but gooth hardyly emonge them /

Of the manner of birds of these foresaid contrees Capitulo / xvjo.
THe Egle of his nature takes his birds by the vngles or claws with his
bylle. And him that holds fastest he loves best and keeps them next by him
/ And them that holden but febly / he leteth hem goo / and takes none head of
them / when the Egle is much aged he flees so hye that he passes the clouds
/ And holds there his sight so long against the son / that he has all
lost it and burnt all his feathers / Then he falls down on a montayn in
the water that he has to fore chosen / and in this manner he renews his byl
/ And wha^ his bylle is over long he breketh and bruseth it against an hard
stone and sharpeth it when the Turtle has lost her make whom she has first
known / Never after will she have make ne sytte upon grene tree. But flees
emonge the trees contynuelly bewayllyng her love. The hostryche by his nature
eteth well iron. and greueth him not / when the heyron sees the tempest come /
he flees up so hye till he be above the clouds for teschewe the rayn and
tempeste / The Chowe when she fyndeth gold or silver of her nature she hydeth
and bears it away. And who sometime heereth her voys. It seems proprely that
she speaks / The crow weneth that he is the fairest bird of all other / and
the best syngyng / If her birds be white in any part / she will never do
them good till they be all black. The pecok when he byholdeth his feathers he
sets up his tayll as Round as a wheell all about him / by cause his
beaulte should be allowed and preysed / and is much proud of his fair fethrrs
and plumage / But when he beholds toward his feet / which ben fowl to look
on / then he leteth his tayll fall wenyng to cover his feet. The goshawke
and sperhawk taken their prays by the ryuers / But they that been tame and
reclaymed bring that they take to their lord which has so taught them. The
culuuer or the down is a simple bird / and of her nature nourysshith well the
pigeons of another douue / And apperceyuyth well in the water by the shadow
and sees therein when the hawke would take her / The huppe or lapwynche is a
bird crested / which is much in mareys and fylthes / and abides lever
therein than out thereof / who someuer ennoynteth him self with the blood of the
huppe. and hap that after leyde him down to sleep him should seem anon in his
sleep dreming that all the deuyllys of hell should come to him and would
stra^gle him / The nyghtyngal of her propre nature syngyth well and louge and
otherwhyle so long that she deyeth syngyng / And the lark like wise deyeth
often syngeng / The swanne syngeth often to fore her death / In like wise do ofto
many men / Of these things and of many other. Much people meruaylle that
never herd of such things to fore. ne know not thereof as we do here that
daily. find it. For in this book we find many things and resons / whereof
men meruaylle strongly that never have seen learned ne herd of them /

Of dyuersytes of sum comyne things / Caplo. xvij
PLente and many things there ben at eye / of which the resons ben convert and
hyd fro us / of which the people meruaylle but lytil / by cause they see it so
often / The quick silver is of such nature and manner that it susteyneth a
stone upon it where as water and oil may not. for the stone in them goth to
the bottom. the lyme or brent chal^e / in cold water anon it chauffeth and is
hoot that noma^ may suffer his hand on it / The rays of the son make the
here of a man abourne or blou^de / and it makes the flessh of a man broun or
black / And it whyteth the lynnen cloth / And the earth that is moist and
soft. makes dry and hard. and wax that is dry / it relenteth and makes
soft. Also it makes cold water in a vessel warm Also out of a gla^ against
the son men make fire / and out of Crystal in like wise also with smytyng of
a stone against iron comes fire and flammeth / The breeth of a man which is
hoot coleth hoot thing / And it chauffeth cold / and air / by me^yng. The
earth which is peysant and right heavy by nature holds hit in the myddle of
thayer without pyler and foundement only but by nature. And therefore he is a
fooll that merueylleth of things that god makes / For no creature has ye
power to show reason whefore they ben or not For there is nothing how lytyl it
be that the gloss may be known unto the truth sauf only that which pleseth
to our lord god / For to be well founded in clergy may men know and
understand the reason of sum things / and also by nature such thing as by
reason can not be comprehended. Thawh a man inquire never so long of that is
wrought in therthe by nature / he shall not mow come to ye knowelege wherefore
ne how they be made. This may noman certainly know / sauf god only which
knows the reason and understands it /

For to know where hell stondeth. and what thing it is Capitulo / xviijo.
WE have declared to you and devised the earth without forth the best wise that
we can / But now it is expedyent after that this that is said to know and
inquire what places and what mansyons there may be within therthe / and whether
it be paradys. hell purgatory. lymbo or other thing / And which of them is
best / and which of them all is worste / As to the regard of me and as me
seems that / that which is informed and closed in the earth is hell. I say
this for as much as hell may in no wise be in thayer which is one so noble a
place. Also I may freely mayntene that it is not in heaven. For that place is so
right excellent pure and net / that hell may not endure there / For as much
as hell is so horrible stynkyng fowl / and obscure / Also it is more poysaunt
and heavy than any thing may be / wherefore it may be clerly understood that
hell is being in the most lowest place. most derke / and most vile of the
earth / And as I have here said to you the causes why / In truth it may not
be in thayer. and yet less in heaven for it is in all points contrary to
heaven above. for as much as these two ben contrary one to another of which
places in that one is founden but all glory and consolacion / that is heaven.
In that other is nothing but of all trybulacyon. that is hell / And therefore
it is wythdrawen all under fro that other as far as it may. and that is in
the myddle of therthe. I say not that hell is not in none other place where
it be / For after the death he has pain and sorrow that has deserved it / And
when such one shall have his pain above / so much has he the worse. All
thus as it should be of sum man that had a great maladye so much that he
should deye. And that he were brought in to a fair place and plesaunt for to

saw that he could ne might help him self ne take thereby no spoort ne releef

dampened in hell / whereof we shall now herafter to you more ample and largely
declare / for to fynysshe the bettre our book / Now if ye will take heed and
understand. we shall deuyse how hell is in the myddle of therthe / and of what
nature it is of / And of the inestymable tormentis which they have that been
therein put and condemned. ye have well vndestanden how by nature the iiij
elements hold them that one within that other so that therthe is in the
myddle and holds him in the myddle of the firmament all in like wise is there
in the myddle of therthe a place which is called Abisme or swolowe / and earth
of perdycion / Thus much say I to you of this place that it is full of fire
and of brennyng sulfre / And it is over hydows stynkyng full of ordure and of
all evil adventure. hit is much large within. and bynethe it is strayt. All
that falls therein anon the sulph^e contynuelly bre^neth destroys and
consumes / And that thing that comes therein shall never fynysshe ne have end.
but alleway shall brenne without end / Alleway it brennth. and alleway renews
/ And all that come therein may never deye For this place is of such nature
that the more it brenneth the longer it endures. This place of hell has
within him all the euylles of his party / There death holds his standard.
which sends out through all the world for to fetch them that been his / Who
that has Joy of heaviness Thither come all euylles and all the evil aportes /
this place is called the earth of death / For the sowles that been brought thither
/ they abide and dwell there without end / Certainly they deye living / And
alleway live deyeng / The death is there their life and their vyande and mete The
death holds them there at his commandment / This is the right pytte of fire
that brennyth. And all in like wise as the stone is drewned in the sea when it
is thrown and sonken / and never shall be after seen right so ben the sowles
sonken in to the bottom which contynuelly brenne and be drowned there / but for all that they dymynysshe not ne have end. But in such myserye abye their
folyes night and day. and so shall endure perpetuelly and without end. For what
someuer thing that is spyrituel may never dye in such wise that it be all
deed / but the death would they have and weesshe after it incessauntly / the
soul may never deye after that it is out of the body. But when it is there /
It shall alleway languysshe / And ever after that it is in hell it shall have
nothing but evil / this is the contre and the land of oblyuyon and forgetyng.
For all they that been there shall be forgoten. Like as they forgate in this
world their maker which is full of pity and of mysericorde / And therefore he
has leyd them there in forgetyng where they shall never have mercy ne pardon in
this land so tenebrouse hydouse and full of all stenche / and of sorrows.

Joy thise ben the terryble gehynes stynknyge / And there is fire so over much
ardaunt hot and anguysshous that our fire and the hete is no more unto the
regard of that fire of hell than a fire painted on a wall is in conparyson
and to the regard of our fire / There ben the flodes perylla^us which ben of
fire and of ye so hydows / horrible / full of venyme and of foul beestes that
make so great noise and so great grief pain and ennoye unto the dolorouse
souls that been in the said abysme / that nys creature that can or may recounte
or tell the hundred part / In this contre there is plente of other places
which ben peryllous and horrible. And of them ben sum in the sea as well as
within therthe / In many yles that been by the sea is terryble stenche of
sulphre ardau^t in great fire which is much paynfull. There ben many great
montaynes of sulphre that brenne night and day where as many sowles ben
encombred and brenne contynuelly for to purge their sins and inyquitees /
This may then well suffyse as touching to speak any more of this matere. For
there is no creature that can tell the great torments and inestymable pains
that a man of evil life receives for his demeryte when he is departed fro this
world. For he gooth evil to werse here we shall cesse for this present time /
and now say no more hereof / And seen that we have spoken well a long of one of
the four Elementis which is therthe / we shall now speak of the second / and
that is of the water that always renneth. And after we shall speak of thayer and
after of the fire euerych in his right order /

How the watre renneth by and thurghe therthe / Ca xixo.
THe water that is the deep see the which enuyronneth and goth round about
the world / and of this see / meuen all the flodes and ryuers that run
through the earth / And run so far their course / and that they return and
come again thedyr from whens they departed / and that is the sea / And thus
goth the sea contynuelly tornyng and making his course that for so much as the
water is more light than the earth / so much is it above and is most next to
therthe / She departs and deuydeth the contrees / and she spredeth her through
out all therthe. she falls again in to the sea / And spredeth again by the
flodes and ryuers and goth sourdyng and spryngyng in the earth from one place
to another by veins / all in like wise as the blood of a man goth and rennth
by the veins of the body. and goth out and yssueth in sum place / all in
like wise renneth the water by the veins of therthe and sourdeth and springs
out by the fontaynes and wells / fro which it gooth al about. that when one
delueth in therthe deep in medowe or in montaygne or in valeye men find water
salt or sweet or of sum other manner /

How the water sweet or salt / hoot or enuenymed sourdeth out of the earth.
Capitulo xxo.
All watres come of the sea as well the sweet as the salt. what someuer they be
/ all come out of the sea. and theder again all return. vherupon sum may
demand / sith the sea is salt. how is it that sum water is fresshe and
sweet / Herto answerth one of thauctours and says that the water that has his
course by the sweet earth is fresshe and sweet / and becomes sweet by the
swetenes of therthe. which takes away from it his saltnes and his bytternes
by her nature. For the water which is salt and bitter when it renneth through
the sweet earth. The swetnes of therthe receyneth his bytternes and saltnes /
And thus becomes the water sweet and fresshe which to fore was salt and
byttre Other waters sourden and spryngen bitter and black. which sum men
drink for to be heled of their maladyes instede of poison / the which oftymes
make great purgacio^s to sum people / This is a water that spryngeth black
and clear and renneth in therthe which is bitter and black / and it is full of
much fylthe / wherefore men have great meruaylle / how it may be holsom to the
body of a man. In another place sourdeth water which is hoot. and that there
might be scal^ed therein a pygge or a ghoos / which ben called bathes or baynes
naturell. Of such manner bathes ben there in almayne in the cite of Acon. and in
England at bathe / In lorayne another at thabbay of plounners / and at Ays in
Gascoygne another / This proceeds for as much as within therthe ben many
caves which ben hoot and brennyng as fire / And therthe has plente of veins
which ben all full of sulphre / And there comes other while a wind great and
strong the which comes by the water that sourdeth. And that it put forth so
strongly that the sulphre catches fire and brenneth. like as a fornayce all
brennyng should do / And the water that has his course by these veins become
also hoot as fire / And if it happed that the water right there should spring
out of earth / It should issue sourdyng all enflammed and all boylyng as it
were on a fire / But fro as feere as his course renneth fro thens so much
wexeth it less brennyng. and it may run so long and so far that in the end
it becomes again all cold / For there is nothing so hoot but that it koleth /
sauf only the fire of hell which contynuelly brenneth / and shall brenne
without end within therthe is plente of other places which ben full of foul
bestes and venymous in such wise that the water that renneth thereby is all
enfeeted and sourdeth in sum places on therthe. But who that drynketh thereof
secheth his death /

Of diverse fontaynes and wells that sourde on therthe / Capitulo / xxj
There ben plente of fontaynes in other places that much often change their
color And other of whom come miracles / but it is not well known whereof this
proceeds / In the land of Samarye is a well that changes and differenceth
his color four times in a year. Hit is first grene / and after it changes in
to Sangwyne and after it becomes trowble / And after all this it becomes
clear net / and right fine. in such wise that men delight them in beholding
of it / but no person dar drink of it In this party is yet another fontayne
which springs three or four days the weke good and holsomme / And the other
three days it springs not / but is all dry / There is also a great River
that renneth six days during in the weke / And on the sabotte day it renneth
not / For as soon as the sabbotte day approaches / he rebouteth and goth into
therthe again / By acres the Cite is founden a manner of sand. And there is
founden also of the glayre of the sea / Which ben meddled to gydre / And of
these two myxtyons is made good glass and clear / In Egypt is the read see /
where the children of Israhel passed over dry foot for to come in to the
land of byheste. This see takes his name of therthe / For therthe is all
read in the bottom and on the sides in such wise that the water of this see
seemed all reed / In perse is a river long and broad which in the night is so
hard frozen. that people may goo over a foot and trauerse it / And on day time
it is clear and rennyng / there is in Espyre a well of which the nature is
meruayllous yt which quenches brondes of fire all brennyng / and after it
sets them a fire again In ethyope is another which by night has so great
hete that no creature may then drink thereof / And all the day it is so
cold that it is frorn all hard / In lorayne nygh unto metm the cite is a
water that renneth there / the which is soden in great payelles of copper. and
it becomes falt fair and good / And this water furnyssheth all the contre of
salt / And this water sourdeth of a pit which is the pit of Dauyd / In
this contre ben other fontaynes that been so hoot that it brenneth all that is
touches / In the same place sourde and spring other that been as cold as ice.
There ben baynes well attempryd and medlyd with cold water and hoot / And they
that bayne them in these baynes / their scables and soores become all hool. Yet
there be of other fontaynes right black which ben holden right holsom / and
people drink of them instead of medecynes / And they make oftyme great
purgacyons / and gretter than of a medycyne or a laxatysf / Another fontayne
there is toward the Oryent whereof is made fire grekyssh with other myxtyons that
is put thereto the which fire when it is taken and light is so hoot / that it
can not be quenchid with water / But with aysel / vryne. or with sonde only.
The sarasyns selle this water right dear and derrer than they do good wine.
Other fontaynes sourden in many other places that hele sore eyes and many
soores and wounds / Other fontaynes there be that render to a man his mind and
memory. Other make men to forgete Other that refrain people fro lecherye.
other that meue them thereto. Other there be that make wymmen to conceive and
bear children. And other that make them bareyne and may bear none / There ben
sum ryuers that make sheep black / And other that make them white as the
lylye. On that other side the^ ben many pondes or stagnes in which may nothing
swymme man ne hounde ne other best but anon it synketh down to the bottom /
There ben other in which nothing may synke. but contynuelly flote above / There
ben yet other fontaynes hoot. that blind the thieves when they forswere them of
the trespaas that they have commysed touching their theft. And if they be
charged and born wrongly on hand without reason and then drink of this
water. certainly they shall have better sight than tofore Of all these things
can noman render the reason / but that we ought to understand that all this
proceeds by miracle / Yet ben there other fontaynes which ben still and clear
/ Which that when men pleye over them with harp or other instrumentis that
resowne in manner of consolacion by their sown / The water of those wellys
spring up with great bobles and spring over in the way / Other fontaynes ben
in other places which ben right peryllous / But for this present we shall rest
her with all. For to tell of this that comes by the waters. which hold
their course within therthe and also above. of which it happeth other while so
great a quauyng that the earth meueth so strongly / that it behooves to fall
all that which is thereon thaugh it were a massyue tour /

Wherefore and how the earth quaueth and trembles Capitulo xxijo.
NOw understand ye then / what it is of the meuyng of the earth / And how
the earth quaueth and shakes that sum people call an earth quaue / by cause
they feel therthe meue and quaue under their feet. And oftymes it quaueth so
terrybly and meueth that sometime Cytees ben sonken in to therthe that never
after be seen / And this comes of the great waters that come within therthe.
so that by the puttyng out of the great flodes and waters grow sum time
cauernes under therthe / And the air that is shette fast within / the which
is enclosed in great distress. If therthe be there feeble so that it may not
reteyne it all within. then is it constrained to opene and cleue. For air
enforces to issue out / whereof it happeth often that towns cytees and
castellys ben sonken down into the abysme. And if therthe be of such force and
strength that it opens not ne cleueth by the shouynge or heuynge of the
wyndes that been within / Then therthe meueth and quaueth so meruayllously
that the great walls and hye towers that been thereon fall down so suddenly in
therthe that it destroys and sleeth the people that been therein which ben not
aduysed ne pourueyed of such dangers. Which is a great sorrow for the pour
people that dwell where such meschief happeth / when they be not aduertysed at
what time such tempeste shall come for teschewe it. But wise men that doubt
for to deye arm them and make them ready against the death / And give all
dylygence for to seche to have accordaunce unto the souerayn Judge / of their
sins and defaultes after their law and believe that they have / as they that
have none hour ne space to live where as / they ben hool and well at ease /
Thus the water and the wind maken the right meuyng and quauyng by which the
earth cleueth and quaueth /

How the water of the sea becomes salt. Capitulo. xxiij
NOw I will recounte and tell to you how the water of the sea becomes salt.
which is so bittre that no person may drink ne the bestys in like wise hit
comes by the son on hye / For it makes so great hete in sum place / that
the sea is chauffed so strongly that therthe which is under draws to him a
moisture byttre / which takes away all savor / For in the sea ben right
great and hye montaynes and deep valeyes which ben full of bitternesses grievous
and infected / And the earth which is in the bottom of these valeyes scumeth
for the heete of the son upward / Which medleth with the water in the deep
in such wise that it draws the saltnes up by the hete of the son so long
till it be medlyd with that other / And thus is the water of the sea salt with
that other / Then we shall here fynysshe to speak any more of the watres
fressh or salt / And shall recounte to you of the Air which is one of the iiij
Elementis and of his propretees /

Here follows of Air and of his nature / Ca xxiiij
THe Air is set above the water / and is much more subtyl than the water or
the earth / and enuyronneth therthe on all parties / and domyneth also hye as
the clouds mou^te / This air which enuyronneth us on all sides is much
thycke / But we live thereby in like wise as the fysshe lives by the water.
which he draws in and after casts it out again. In such manner the air
prouffyteth to us / For we draw it in / and after we put it out again And thus
it holds the life within the body / For a man should sonner deye without air
than a fysshe should do with out water to whom the life is sone fynysshid when
it is out of the water / Thayer maynteneth in us the life by the moisture that
is in him / And by the thycknes that is in him he susteyneth the birds fleeyng
that so play with their wings and meue them so much al about therein that
they disporte them ledyng their Joy therein and their deduyt* Thus goon the
birds by thayer fleyng / syngyng and preysyng their maker and creator / like
as the fysshes that goon swimming in the water / And ye may apperceyue in this
manner. take a rod and meue it in thayer / and if ye meue it fast and roydly
it shall bow anon / And if it fond not thayer thycke it should not bow ne
ploye / but should hold him straight and right / how fast someuer ye meued it.
of this Air the evil esperytes take their habyte / and their bodies which in
sometime put them in the semblaunce of sum things as when they may appear in
some place for to deceive some person man or woman. or for to make them to issue
out of their mind / whereof they have sometime you might Or when by the art of
nygromancye he puts him in sum semblaunce or in such a figure as he will
/ But this is a science that who that gives him thereto to do evil. hit gives
him the death. For if he takes not head thereof. he shall be dampened body and
soul. But we shall inquire here after what comes fro thayer in to therthe.

How the clouds and rayn come comynly. Ca. xxv
NOw we shall speak of the clouds for to know what it is and of the rain
also. The son is the foundement of all hete and of all time. all in such
wise as the heart of a man is the fou^dement by his valor that is in him of
all natural hete. For by him he has life. and all lives by him that grows on
therthe as it pleseth to our lord / as here after shall be declared if ye will
here and well reteyne the matter and substance of this present beoke / for the
son makes the clouds to mount on hye. and after it makes the rain and to
auale down. And I shall show to you how it is done and shortly / by his force /
and understand ye in what manner when the son spredeth his rays upon
therthe and upon the mareys. he dreyeth them strongely And draws up the
moisture which he enhaunseth on hye / But this is a moisture subtyl which
appears but lytyl and is named vapor / and it mounteth unto the myddle of
thayer and there is assembled and comes to gydre and abides there / And lytyl
and lytyl it encreceth that it comes thycke and derke in such wise that it
takes fro us the sight of the son / And this thing is the cloud / But it
has not so much obscurete that it takes fro us the clerenes of the day / And
when it grows over thycke it becomes water which falls on the earth / and
the cloud abides white. then shyneth the son / which is on hye through
the cloud / If it be not over black. like as through aglasse / Also like a
candel within a lantern. which gives us light without forth. and yet we see
not the candel / Thus shyneth the son through the cloud which is under him
and renders to us the clerenesse of the day / as long as he makes his turn
above therthe. And the cloud that always so long abides and takes more
moisture / so long after / that it becomes black and moist / Then yssueth
out the water which comes to therthe / and thus grows the rain. And when
it is all fallen to therthe. and the great moisture is staunched the cloud
has lost his broun color that he before held and the derkenesse of which
she empesshid the day. Then aperith the cloud clear and white which then
is light and mounteth on hye somoche that in the end she falls and is deffeted
by the hete of the son on hye which al dreyeth up / Then thayer wexeth
again pure and clear / and the heaven as blew as azure / Of therthe grows the
rayn and the clouds also / as of cloth that is weet / and should be dreyed by
the fire. then yssueth thereof a moisture like a smoke or fumee and gooth
upward. who then held his hand over the fumee / he should feel a vapor
which should make his hand moist and weet / If it dured long he should
appertly know that his hand were all weet / and that water should drop and
fall thereof / And thus I say to you that in this manner grow often the clouds
and raynes / and our lord god multyplyeth well them when it pleseth him for to
make the seeds and fruytes grow that been on therthe /

Of frostes and snowes / Capitulo. xxvj
THe great snowes and the great frostes comen by the great coldes of thayer
which is cold in the myddle more than it is on any other part. like as ye
may see of the montaynes which ben in hye place. like as the montaynes of
sauoye. of pyemont or in wales. and in thise other montaynes. where there is of
custom more snow. than is in places that been in plain ground. All this
comes of ye coldness of thayer. which has less hete above. than benethe by
cause it is more subtyl / than that which is bynethe / and when the more
subtyl is on hye so much reteyneth he less of hete. But the more that thayer
is thycke somoche more it chauffeth. and the sonner where the son may come /
Of which comes that iron and steel wexe more hoot by the son than does the
stone. For of so much as the thing is more hard and of more thyck matter / so
much takes it the fire more asprely and sonner than they that been of less
force / Thus say I to you of thayer that is above on hye. which is more c^lde
than this is bynethe / For as much as it is not so thycke as that is which is
nyghe therthe / And for the wind that often grows. Which makes it often to
be in meuyng / For the water that renneth fast eschausfeth less than that
does that holds him stylle / So does thayer which is an hye / And thereby
grows the cold that freseth this moisture anon as it is goon up on hye / And
falls down again y frorn /

Of haylle and of tempests / Capitulo. xxvij
BY this manner comen in the somer the great haylleso. and the great tempests
/ For in thayer they grow / whereof oftyme comes great cold so that the
moisture that is in thayer brought up / is drawn to be frorn. And it is in
thayer assembled and amassed / For the hete that chaceth after it / And the
son causes it to lose and to fall on therthe / But it falls not so great
to the ground as it is frorn above an hye / For it comes down brekyng and
amenuysyng in the falling / And this is the tempest which falls often in the
somer / the which is grievous and ennoyous to many things /

Of lyghtnynges and of thondres / Capitulo / xxviijo.
IN thayer happen many things of which the people speak not gladly / For they
retche not much of such things of which they can not well come to the
knowleche / This that makes therthe to quaue. And this that makes the clouds
to thondre / that which makes the earth to opene / And this that makes the
clouds to sparkle and lyghtne when the thondre is herd / For thondres and
lyghtnynges ben deboutemens and brekyng out of wyndes that mete above the
clouds so asprely and shdrply / that in their coming grows often a great fire
in thayer / And this thondre that falls in many places which the wyndes
constrayne so terrybly that the clouds cleue and break and makes to thondre
and lyghtne and falls down in so great rage by the wind that destrayneth it
so asprely that it confounds all that it atteyneth in such wise that
nothing endures against it / And it is of so heavy nature that sometime it
perseth therthe unto the myddle. And sometime it quenches er it comes to the
ground after that it is of poyse / and that is not of over strong nature. For
when the cloud is much derke / and thycke and that there is great plente of
water / the fire passes not so soon. but it is quenchid in the cloud by the
great qua^tyte of the water that is therein before it may perse through so that
it may not approach therthe / but in the straynyng and brekyng that hit makes
then in the cloud. grows a sown so great and strong / that it is
meruayllous to here I declare to you for certain that this is the thondre.
which is much to be doubted and drad / In like wise as of an hoot and
brennyng iron that is put in a tubbe of water thereof grows a noise and a
great sown and also when cooles ben quenchid / But the lyghtnyng of the
thondre appears and is seen er ye here the voys or sown. for as much as the
sight of a man is more subtyl than the heeryng like as men see fro far over a
water betyng of clothes or smytyng of marteaulx or hamers / the strokes ben
seen of them that smite. or the soun be herd of the stroke. All in like wise
may I say to you of the thondre / the which men see to fore and er they here
it / and so much the ferther it is above us. so much the ferther is the soun
of the lyghtnyng after it is seen / er the soun be herd / and the sonner after
the lyghtnyng is seen and the yons herd somoche is the thondre more nygh unto
us /

For to know how the wyndes grow and come. ca. xxixo
OF the wyndes may men enquire reason of them that use the sees / And the wyndes
run round above therthe oftymes / and entrecounte and mete in some place so
asprely / that they rise upon heyght in such wise that they lift up thayer on
hye And thayer that is so lift and taken fro his place / remeueth other air in
such facion that it retorneth as it were afterward and gooth cryeng and
brayeng as water rennyng / For wind is none other thing but air that is meuyd
so long till his force be beten down with the stroke / Thus come often clouds
ray^es thondres and lyghtnynges / and the things tofo^^ said / There ben yet
other resons how these works comen / But these that best serve to knowelege
and lightly to be understand we have drawn out shortly. and now we shall cesse
of this matter for to speak of the fire which is above the air on hye /

Of the fire and of the sterres that seem to fall / Capitulo. xxxo.
YE ought to know that above thayer is the fire / this is an air which is of
much great resplendour and shynyng and of much great noblesse / and by his
right great subtylte he has no moisture in him. And is much more clear than
the fire that we use / and of more subtyl nature / than thayer is against ye
water, or also the water against the earth / This air in which is no manner
moisture / It stratcheth unto the moon / And there is seen often under this air
sum sparkles of fire / and seem that they were sterres of which men say
they be sterres. which goon rennyng / and that they remeue fro their places.
But they be none / but it is a manner of fire that grows in thayer of sum
dry vapor. which* has no moisture within it / which is of therthe and
thereof grows by the son which draws it upon hye / and when it is over
hye it falls and is set a fire like as a candel brennyng as us seems. and
after falls in thayer moist and there is quenchid by the moystnes of thayer /
And when it is great and the air dry it comes al brennyng unto therthe /
whereof it happeth often that they that saylle by the sea or they that goon by
land have many times founden and seen them al shynyng and brennyng fall unto
therthe. and when they come where it is fallen they find none other thing but
a lytyl ass^es or like thing or like some leef of a tree roten. that were weet /
Then apperceyue they well and believe that it is no sterre. For the sterres
may not fall / but they must all in their cercle meue ordynatly and
contynuelly night and day egally /

Of the pure Air and how the seven planetes ben set / Capitulo. xxxjo.
THe pure air is above the fire which purpryseth and takes his place unto
the heaven / In this air is no obscurte ne derknes / For it was made of clear
purete it resplendissheth and shyneth so clerly that it may to nothing be
compared / in this air ben vij sterres which make their course al about
therthe / The which be much clean and clear and be named ye vij planetes / of
whom that one is set above that other and in such wise ordained that there
is more space fro that one to ye other / Than there is from the earth to the moon which is ferther fyften times than all the earth is great and euerich
renneth by miracle on the firmament and makes his cercle that one great and
that other lytyl after that it is and sits more low / For af somoche that
it makes his course more nyghe therthe / so much is it more short / and sonner
has performed his course / than that which is ferthest / that is to say that
who that made a point in a wall and with a compaas made diverse cercles
about. always that one more large than another / That which should be next ye
point should be lest of the other and less should be his course / for he should
sonner have don his course than the grettest / so that they went both egally as
ye may see by this figure to fore /

THus we may understand of the vij planetes of which I have spoken that /
that one is under that other / in such wise that she that is lowest of all
the other is leest of all and that is the moon / but by cause that it is next
to therthe / it seems grettest and most apparaunt of all the other. and for
thapprochement of therthe and because it goth so nygh. it has not pure
clerenes that comes of him self proprely by cause therthe is so obscure / but
the clernes and light that it renders to us / she takes always of the son /
like as should a myrrour when the rays of ye son smyteth therein and of the
reflexyon the myrrour smyteth on the wall and shyneth thereon as long as the
rays of the son endure in the glass / In like manner shows and lyghteth to
us the light of the moon / and in the moon is a body polysshyd and fair like a
pommell right well burnysshed. Which reflaumbeth and rendryth light and
clerenes wha^ the rays of the son smyteth therein / The lytyl clouds or
derkenes that is seen therein. sum say that it is therthe that appears
within / And that which is water appears white like as against a myrrour
which receives diverse colors / when she is turned thereto. other think
other wise and say that it happed and byfelle wha^ adam was deceived by
thapple that he ete. which grieved all humanye lygnage / And that then the moon was empesshed and his clerenesse lassed and mynuysshed. Of these vij
sterres or planetes that been there and make their course on the firmament of
whom we have here to fore spoken. First were no moo known but the tweyne /
that is to wete the son and the moon. thr other were not known but by
Astronomye / Nevertheless yet shall I name them for as we have spoken of them to
you / of these there ben tweyne above the moon and byneth the son and that one
above that other of whom each has on therthe propre virtues / And they named
mercurye and venus / Then above the moon and these tweyne. is the son /
which is so clear fair and pure / that it renders light and clerenesse unto
all the world and the son is set so hye above / that his cercle is gretter
and more spacyouse tha^ the cercle of the moon. which makes his course in xxx
days xij sithes so much / For the son which gooth more ferther fro the
earth than the moon makes his course / has CCClxv days. this is xij time
somoche and more over as the calender enseigneth / and yet more the fourth part
of a day / that be vj hours. but for this that the year has dyuersly his
beginning that one begins on the day and another on the night which is
great ennoye to much people this part of a day is set by cause alleway in
iiij year is a day consumed which is above in that space the which year is
named bysexte or lepe year which in iiij year falls ones / and so is set
fro four year to four year always more a day. and then is the son comen
again in his first point / And that is in the myd march / when the new time
recomenceth / and that all things draw to love by the virtue of the return of
the son / for in this season had the world first his beginning / and therefore
then all thing renews and comes in verdure by right nature / of the time
and none otherwise / Above the son there be three sterres clear and shynyng /
and one above another / That is to wete mars jupiter and saturnus / Saturn is
highest of the seven which has in his course xxx year er he has all goon his
cercle / and these iij sterres reteyne their virtues in things here bynethe
and ye may see if ye behold this figure how they be in order each above other
which figure shows it well /

How the vij planetes give the names to the vij days / Capitulo / xxxijo.
Thise vij planetes ben such that they have power on things that grow on
therthe and habou^de their virtues more than all the other that been on ye
firmament and more appertli work like as thau^cie^t sage philosophers have
enserched by their wits of these vij planetes taken the days of the weke
their names as ye shall here / The moon has the monday / and mars the tewsday /
mercurye the wednesday / Jupiter the thursday. venus the friday saturnus ye
saturday. and the holy sunday has his name of the son / which is the most
fair. and therefore the sunday is better than any of the other days of the weke
/ For this day is set and reseruyd from all pain and labor / And on this
day should men do thyngis that should playse our lord / but sith in this
chapter we have touched of the firmament we shall speak after of sum caas
that come on the heaven and therthe. The sunday is as much to say as the day
of pees and of praysinge / For the creator of all things cessed this day /
the which made and created all /

Of the meuyng and going about of the firmament and of the sterres that been
therein / Capitulo. xxxii^o.
Above saturn which is the last planete / and highest from us of all the vij
planetes is the heaven that men see so full of sterres as it were sown. when it
is clear time and weder / This heaven that is so sterryd is the firmament which
meueth and goth round of which meuyng is so great Joy so great melodye and so
sweet / that there is noma^ that if he might here it that never after should have
talente ne will to do thing that were contrary unto our lord in any thing
that might be. so much should he desire to come theder where he might alleway
here so sweet melodyes and be always with them wherrof sum were sometime that
said that lytyl young children herd this melodye when they lawghed in their
sleep / For it is said that then they here the angels of our lord in heaven
sing whereof they have such Joy in their sleep / But hereof knows noman the
truth sauf god that knows all / Which setted the sterres on the heaven and
made them to have such power. For there is nothing within the earth ne within
the sea / how diverse it be. but it is on the heaven fygured and compassed by
the sterres. of which none knows ye nombre sauf god only / which at his
playsir nombreth them and knows the name of eueriche of them as he that all
knows and all created by good reason at the regard of the sterres that may
be seen they may be well nombred and inquired by Astronomye. but it is a much
maystryse. For there ne is sterre so lytyl. But that it has in him hole his
virtue / In herb. in flour / or in fruit be it in facion / in color or
otherwise / There is nothing in earth that ought to be. ne therein has growyng
but sum sterre has strength and puyssaunce by nature / is it good or
otherwise such as god has given to it / And for the firmament and for the
planetes take this figure to fore on that other side / and ye shall see therein
the sytuacyon of them /

But sith we have descriued and spoken of the firmament in this second party
of this volume / we shall speak of sum caases that come and happen on hye and
also low. And shall speak of the mesure of the firmament. For to under stand
the better the facion and how it is made and proporcioned and of that which is
above / And also we shall speak of heaven /

Thus fynyssheth the second party of this present volume /
Here begins the third part of this present volume and declares first how
the day and the night come / Ca. primo
IN this third and last party of this present book we shall fynysshe it with
speaking of the faytes of Astronomye. And I will declare to you first how the
day comes and the night and for to make you understand of the Ecplises / And
also for to understand other things / the which may much prouffyte to them
that will do pain to know them / For to govern them the better after the
disposicyon of the time /

Here declares how the day and night comen.

Truth it is that the son makes his torn and course about therthe in the
day and night and gooth egally every hour. And also long as he abides above
therthe so long have we the deduyt of the day / and when he is under therthe
then have we the night / like as ye went tornyng abrennyng candel about your
heed or as ye should here it a lytyl ferther of / Round about an apple / And
that the candel were always bre^nyng / then the party that were always against
the candel should alleway be light And that other party that is ferthest fro it
should be obscure and derke / Thus in like wise does the son by his propre
nature for to be day and night about therthe. he makes the day to grow
before him / And on that other part the earth is vmbreuse and derke by hynde
him and where as he may not shine. And this is the shadow of the night which
ye deduyt of the day takes away from us / But for as much as the son is
much gretter that therthe. the shadow goth little and lytyl till at the end it
comes to naught / like the sown of a clock endures after the stroke / But if
the son and therthe were of one like gretenesse. this shadow should have none
end / but should be all egal without declynyng. and if therthe were gretter
than the son then the shadow oe the son should goo enlargyng and be more
as ye may see the form by these three fygures following. and also ye may preue
it otherwise without fygures / Take sum derke thing that may reteyne light
within it as of tree or of stone or other thing what it be that may be sen
through then set that to fore your eyes / against that thing that ye would see
is it the heaven or earth or any other thing / if that thing that ye hold is
more bredder and larger that your two eyes be a sondre / it shall take away ye
sight against that which is no brodder / And if the thing be all egale in
length as much as ye may stratche your two eyes* as much shall it be taken
fro you as ye thing shall have of gretnes / as ye may see by this figure byneth
an that other side / And if ye thing have less of gretnes than the length is
between your both eyes. it shall take fro you less for to see / as well nyghe
as far that it is of largenes of that which ye would see / And when ye put the
thing ferther fro your eyes. somoche much the more may ye see of that other
part over and above you. so that ye may see all. In like wise is it of the
son without any doubtau^ce or varyacion. For it passes therthe in gretnesse
so that it sees the heaven al about the sterres and all that is on the
firmament /

Why the sterres ben not seen by-day as well as ay night Capitulo. ijo.
THe sterres of the firmament on which the son renders clernes make
contynuelly night and day their tornyng and course with n firmament about round
above as byneth But them that been over us we may not see by day / For the
son by his great clernes and light takes from us the sight of them / In like
wise as ye should do of candelis that were far brennyng from you / And if there
were a great fire brennyng between you and the ca^dellis. and had great flawme
and light / It should take away fro you your sight that ye should not see the
candellis / and if the fire were take away and put byhynde you / ye should
incontinent see the / candellis to fore you brennyng / Thus in like wise I say
you of ye sterres that may not be seen by day as long as the son makes his
torn and course above therthe / And when the son is under therthe the sterres
ben seen by us / But tho sterres that been over us in the somer on the day time
/ in winter they be over us in the night. for tho sterres that we see in ye
somer by night we may not see them on the day / for the son that goth round
about us takes fro tho sterres their clernes that been on the day time where
the son is unto the time that he draws him under / but all they be light
what someuer part they torn as well by day as by night. as long as ye son
goth about hye and low shynyng sauf ye which ben hyd by therthe fro us / For
as long at the shadow may comprise it. the son may give them no light that
ye may understand by the figure thus the shadow discreaceth by the son
which is much gretter than therthe / and fynysheth in lassyng And it endures
ferther fro therthe. than the moon is hye. but it faylleth aboueu the moon /

Wherefore the son is not seen by night as it is by day Capitulo iijo.
THe earth is such that she deffendeth the day which the son gives us If
therthe were so clear that men might see through then might ye sone be seen
co^tynuelly as well under therthe as above. But it is so obscure and derke that
it takes away the sight fro us. and it makes ye shadow to go always torning
after the son whih makes as many tornynges about therthe as the son does
which alleway is against it for wha^ the son arises in the morning in theest
/ the shadow is in the west and when it is right over and a^^ue us a^ mydday.
then is therthe shadowed under her And when the son goth down in the west
the shadow of it is in the eest and then when the son is under we have
then the shadow over us which goth drawyng to the west / long till the
son arises and shyneth and rendrith to us the day / And this may ye see by
these two fygures to fore on that other side.

How the moon receives dyuersly her light and clerenesse Capitulo. iiijo.
Sith that ye have understand what it is of the day and of the night / will
ye then after see the fayt of the moon / and how she receives light of the
son / She receives light in such manner that she is contynuelly half full in
what someuer place she be / and when we see her round / then we call her full
/ but how much the ferther she is fro the sone so much the more we see of her
apparayl. and wha^ she is right under the son / then she apperithe not to
us. For then she is between therthe and the son and then she shyneth
toward the son and toward us she is all derke / and therefore we see her not /
But when she is passed the point and is remeuyd fro the sone / Then begins
her clerenesse to appear to us as she were horned / and so much as she
wythdraweth her fro the son somoche more apperith she shynyng And then when
she apperith to be half full of light then has she gone a quarter of her
cercle. which is the fourth part of her torn and course that she goes every
month and thus alleway her clernesse encreacyng and growyng she goth till she
be all round fair and clear in semblaunce of a roll. And that we call the
full moan / Then is she right under the son as she may be right against the
sight in such wise that all her light is turned toward us / Then is therthe
between ye son and the moon so that we may not se them both upon therthe.
but right lityl / but one of them may be seen. For when that one goth down in
the west that other arises in the eest / and so at even or morn may both be
seen but not long / For that one goth under therthe and that other comes
above Then ye moan which has been opposite of the son and has gone half
her course then she goth on that other side approaching the son. and
begins to less her light and mynusshe it till it be but half again and
then has she gone three quarters of her cercle and is then as nygh the son
on that side. as she was at the first quarter on that other side / and so
approaches ner and ner till she appear horned as to fore / and thus she goth till
she be al fails that we may se no more then of her / For then is she under
the son as ye may see by this present figure and I say no more hereof. but
that she is then bitwene the son and therthe /

How the eclipses of the moon happen / Capitulo. vo.
IT happeth often times that the moon must needs lose her light / And that
happeth when she apperith most full / And she becomes as vanysshed away / and
derketh lytyl and lytyl / Till she be all faylled ye have herd here to fore how
the moon takes light of the son / that always she has half her light hole /
But when it is so that she is in eclipse. then has she no light in no part
/ and this happeth never but when she is turned right so that ye son gives
her full light. For the moon goth not always so right as does the son. For
sometime she passes in her course by such away that therthe shadoweth her all
/ For therthe is gretter than the moon is / and therefore when therthe is just
between the son and the moon then she thus shadoweth her / For between the
son and the moon is a lygne which declyneth so much to the moon by which
the son smyteth his rays in her as long as there is no letting by therthe /
For the more that there is between them the more is ye moan shadowed / And the
less that it is between somoche less is the shadow / and the moon leseth the
less of her light that she receives of the son / when she is so shadowed /
Thus ye may understand / if a lygne passed through therthe by the point of the
myddle of it / and stratched that one end unto the body of the son in such
wise by right sight that it endured on that other end unto the moon / which
every month goth here and there. hyer and lower / if she were se even against
the son / then should ^he fall every month in that shadow whi^he on all
parts should empesshe her light / which then might not come to her for
therthe in no wise / For the ferther she is fro the right lygne. so much has
and receives she the more of light / And when she is so that therthe is ex
opposito between them than loses the moon her light / Thus is seen sometime the moon in the myddle of his month lose his light and derk / when she is most full
/ And her light turned unto derkenesse which we call eclypse of the moon. as
ye may well see and understand by this figure if ye behold it well /

How the Eclypse of the Son comes / Ca. vio.
Yt happeth sometime that the son leseth his clerenes and the light in ye
plain day. For it gooth as to decline. and is called in latin eclipsis / This
eclipse proceeds by cause of defaulte of light / and it happeth in this manner
that when the moon which is under the son comes right between us and the
son / then in the right lygne it behooves ye toward us ye moan takes and
reteyneth the light of ye son on hye / so that it seems to us that is
defaylled / for the moon is not so pure that the son may shine over her / and
through her as through an other sterre / all like as a ca^del / which is set
far fro your sight / and after ye held your hand right to fore the candel.
then ye should not see nothing thereof / and the more right ye hold your hand
between / the more less should ye see this candel / and so much ye may set
your hand right to fore your eyes and so far that ye should see nothing
thereof. In this manner I tell you of the Eclypse that between the Son and the Moon is not one way comune / But the moon gooth an other way which
destourneth her a lytyl from the Son. Wherefore us behooves to understand
that the moon gooth oftymes when she is between us and the son sometime above
and otherwhile bynethe / here and there as she ryseth and declyneth / But when
she passyth in the right lygne even between us and the son then takes the moon fro us the light and clernes of the son in such wise as we may not
clerly see her in that paas / For then shadoweth she therthe / And keeps the
raynes of the son that they may not shine on therthe / And they that been in
this part / have in their sight the shadow behind them / But it apperyth not
comunely to all men through all the world For the moon is not so great nowher
nygh as all therthe therefore she shadoweth not all but only where she is in the
right lygne between therthe and the son / And thither the philosophers were
wont to goo where as they knew it / For by their wit and study they had
learned for to approve the day and time when such things should hap By
which they preuyd plente of things wherefore they preysed much our lord /
Thu^ see we here byneth the eclypse of the son above us when the moon is
right under the son for as much as she is bynethe son and above us. And
then the son passes the right lygne and gooth departing and wythdrawyng so
much / that she apperyth as she did before / And then the moon departed is
horned three days after this Eclypse / And by this figure ye may understand
plainly this that ye have herd here tofore /

Of the Eclypse that happed at death of our lord god Capitulo / vijo.
THus as the moon takes away fro us the light of the son / So it happeth
oftyme that therthe takes away the light of the moon as to fore is declared /
But the Eclipse of the moon may not be in no wise but when she apperith most
full ne theclipse of the son may not be but when the moon is all waned and
faylled and that we call the coniuncio^ but if god which made all thing
change and deffete at his plaisir make it to come or happene otherwise / like
as it happed at such time as our savior Ihesu Christ was on the cross / at
which time the light and bryghtnesse of the day faylled fro mydday unto the ix
hour of the day and then was the moon under therthe at the fulle as much as
she might be / which then in no wise might empesshe the light of the son /
and the day at that time was as derke and obscure as it had been propre night /
which by nature at that time should have be bright and pure / For which cause
saint Dyonyse which at this time is schryned in France and then being an
estudyau^t in greece a paynem like a great clercke as he was. For he knew much
of astronomye. when he apperceyued this great obscurte and derknes / he had
right great meruaylle / and fond by astroonmye that this might not be by
nature ne by reason. that the eclipse of the son should hap and fall in
such season / then said he a derke word in this manner or the god of nature
suffers great torment by wrong / or all the world discordeth and shall desolue
and faylle / as it that must take an end / and though in him self that he was
a great god that so susfred /

And that he had power and might above all other gods / as he that byleuyd
on many gods. after his law. Then this holy dyonyse made an altar in his
oratorye all above the other aulters and also a part where as no person
repaired but he him self only / by cause he would not be reputed in mysbyleue.
and when it was made and he had seen it. he called it the altar of the god
unknown and worshipped and adoured him. and held him for a right dear and
great god / It was not long after this / that the holy doctor Saint poul came
to this place where saint dionyse was / as he that knew him for a right great
clerck / And by commynycacion and preching of saint Poul. he was sone converted
by the help of our lord which wrought so therein / that then he had very
knowleche how our lord had suffered his passion For they were both good clerks
as is more plainly contained in their legendes. And thus was the noble clerk
saint dyonyse bycomen a good and very christian man which all his life to fore
had be a paynem and he so employed his science and his time / fro that day
forthon that it auaylled him greatly to ye health of his soul / this eclipse
deceyuid him not ne this that he knew astronomye. but he bycam after a man of
so good and holy life. that he gate for his reward the bliss of heaven. ye have
herd the fayt of Eclypses if ye will understand them well. And ye shall not fare
the werse ne ye less auaylle you / For to know it may much prouffyte to
every person. for such demonstrau^ces ben signefycacions of great works and
things that often after happen and fall / This find well astronomyers by
Astronomye as somtym scarcete and defaulte of goods / of a great derthe of
war / or death of kings or princes that falls in the world / as they may
inquire and search by their science and reason / This eclipse that was so great
signefyed the death of Ihesu Christ / And it ought well to come otherwise for him
than for another / For he was and is by right lord and king of all the world.
And may deffete and desolue it / and ordeyne at his good playsyr the other
eclypses comen by nature which reteyne on therthe their virtues of things
that been come / for it byhoueth all to fynysshe and come to naught to all yt is
on therthe / and that shortly / god made not ye firmament ne the sterres for
noght which as said is goth tornyng over and above us / and gives to the
sterres names and virtues in heaven and in earth / each after his might on all
things that has growyng. For there is nothing but it has sum power for as
much as it has growyng / such as it ought to have by nature and by resen we
shall now for this present leave for to speak any more of the eclipses / and shall
recompte and declare of the virtue of the firmament and of the sterres / For
who so well knew the virtue of them / he should know the truth of all such
thing that is bynethe here on therthe by reason of nature / whether the thing
were obscure and derke or not /

Of the virtue of heaven and of the sterres / Caplo. viijo.
NOw will ye here of the science by the which men get sapience for to know
and inquire the things that may happen in therthe by the werker of right
nature which is fygured by the world / The heuenes and the sterres ben the
very instruments of nature to the world by which she werketh all as god will
as well nygh as far. and who that could know her might / he had knowledge of
all thing that said is / as well of the sterres that been on heaven which have
vertueson therthe which god has given and granted to euerich and specially
to the son and to the moon which give light unto the world and without whom
nothing living may be / For by them grow all things that be in this world
and which have end and beginning / this consents and permyseth he that is
almighty. All dyuersitees that be in persons and which have dyuersitees of
making and of corsage and all that happeth by nature / be it in herbs / in
plants or in beestes. this happeth by the virtue celestyal which god gaf to
the sterres. When he first created the world / And that he set them and
endowed them with such nature that he ordained them to goo round about the
world against the tornyng of the firmament / And by their tornyng and by their
virtue which lies in heaven. live all things that been under it / And if it
pleasyd our lord that he would hold the heaven all stylle in such wise that it
turned not about. there is nothing in all the world / that might meue him. In
him should be no understanding no more than in a deed body. which feleth nothing
ne therein is no wit ne understanding ne moeuyng as he that has no life / in
such point / shall every thing be when the heaven shall leave his moeuyng. All
thus should they be and never moeue / till that the heaven had again his moeuyng /
And then should they be otherwise but who that then might use his wit and
se what he shall be. much might he see of semblau^ces and of diverse
contenau^ces in other men that might not remeue them / For if there were no
meuyng on the heaven / there is nothing that might live on earth. Also god will
that it so be that all thing has establysshid by right / Thus was the will of
god in whom all virtues habounde for to form the world / For he made ne
created never thing but that he gaf to it such virtue as it ought to have /
ellis he had made somthyng for naught and without reason / but he did not so
for he never faylled in no thing / he made and created all the sterres and
gaf to euerich his virtue and who yt will not believe. thus In him is nether
memoyre ne reason / For we see openly that the moon takes light when we see her
all full. for the man has then neither membre ne vain / but that it is full
when it is in the course of humors and such things and in like wise it
happeth on all bestes. For they have then their hedes and other members more
garnysshid of margh and of humeurs / And the sea also flows and ebbeth in his
course every month whereof it happeth that they that been nygh ye see when they
know that the moon is full they wythdrawe them fro the sea on hye. And save
them and their meynage. and in this point they wythdrawe them and hold them
in hye places unto the time that the sea wythdraweth and lasseth again. And
thus do they every month. But all this happeth by the moon which is one of
the seven planetes / In like wise is it seen of the son. that after the
winter when he begins to mount / he causes the fruit to be brought forth
of therthe / and appparylleth the trees with leaves. and all verdure to come
again. And the birds begin again their song for the swetenes of the new
time. And when he rebasshith and declyneth / he makes the winter to begin
and causes flowers and leuis to fall and fall so long till he begin to
mount again as to fore is said. Sith that these two sterres have such virtues
/ and cause such things to be don / The other which ben pourtrayed on the
heaven / were not made to serve of naught / But to eueriche is ordained his
virtue and his right after his nature. Wherefore they make dyuersitees in
things that been on therthe / And the moeuynges of time / of which that one
comes soon and that other late / And the fruytes that come on therthe. Sum
come sone and erly and the other late and ben otherwhyle sooner ripe in one
year that in an other. And more assured of tempests and other greuaunces / And
thus change in sundry manners. For one somer is soft and moist / And another
is dry and wyndy / Of the winter it happeth oftymes that they change / so
that one is cold / rayny and more desplaysaunt than ye other / And another
shall be more Joyous and less damageable / Thus is seen that the one is dear of
sum vytaylle or other things And that other shall be plentyuous And also it
is often that there is plente and good chepe in one year / In another year it is
had in great chierte / and is of great scarset^ this fallyth sometime and often.
All these dyuersytees cause the sterres which ben on the heaven / But all
this is by the will of our lord that has set eeueriche in his propre place
/ where he makes naturelly his course / and euerich dyuersly / For if none
other thing had his use in times sauf the son only without moo / as he that
goth swyftly by the firmament every year / And mounteth as much and as hye in
one somer as in another And as much descends in one winter as in another
every day egally till that he come in to / his right point / And Joins that
other after him where he was to fore / this know well Astronomyers that he
gooth every year about the heaven one torn. And where he is this day in the
same place he shall be this day a year. There by is it known that if none other
has no power then should every year be like other. and every year always should
be like as the year to fore was / and every month should be like the same as
eueriche should come / that is to wit / one Ianyuer like another Ianyuer / and
feuerer like another feuerer / and in like wise all the other x. months / For
the son gooth all like in one month / As he shall the next year in the same
month. And this day should reassemble and be like unto this day a year in all
manner thing that is to wete of hete / of cold of fair wether. of rain and of
other things euerich after their coming all the year during. Then should it
fall by right nature that in all the summers and all the wynters that ever have been and shall be should not come no dyuersytees. And all the times should be like
as they that by the. son should be always demened / eschauffed and contynuelly
governed. For he goth egally always and ends his course every year and holds
his right way in one estate as he that goth not out of his way. Thus is he the
right veyle and patron of all the other sterres. For it is the most fyn of all
the other by the great clerenesse that is in him / and in all things by him /
and he has on therthe more power on things of which may be inquired of
nature reason and right than all the other sterres / yet sometime they restrain
his heetes and after they enlarge the^m after that they be fer or nygh / as he
otherwhyle has need / like unto a king which is the gretter lord and the
more mighty in him self for his highness than any other of the people /
Nevertheless he has sometime need of them for to be helped and served of them /
For how much the nerer he is to his people / so much more is he strong and
puissaunt / And the ferther he wythdraweth fro his folk / so much the less
he exployteth of his work / In like wise I say to you of the son which is
as ye may understood. the grettest. the most mighty / And the most virtuous /
of which he has gretter power in earth / than any other sterre may have. but
the other have their power euerich in his degree. But sith we have recounted to
you the shortest wise we may of the virtue of the firmament. we shall declare to
you herafter in short how the world was mesured as well in heyght as in
depnesse. And on all sides of length and bread by them that k^ewe the resons
of the seven sciences / Of which geometry is one. by which the son / the moon. therthe / and the firmament ben mesured as well within as without / how
much it is of gretenes / And how much it is fro therthe to the firmament /
and all the gretenes of the sterres / For this is preuyd by right byholdyng.
And they that found this science perceived that it might not be known truly
by astronomye ne the nature of the sterres without knowing of their mesures /
Therefore would they mesure them and preue all their gretenesse /

Wherefore and how they mesured the world / Caplo. ix
First of all the ancient philosophers would mesure the gretnes of the world
all round above therthe tofore any other work. by which they preuyd the
heyght of the sterres. and the gretnes of the firmament all about / And they
could not find more gretter mesure to be mesured / and when they had mesured
therthe how much it had of largenes all about / and how much it had of
thycknes thourgh they inquired after of the moon by cause it was lest hye fro
therthe. and most nyhest thereto. And after they inquired of the son. how
far it was fro therthe / And how much the body thereof had of gretnes / And
they fond it more tha^ all therthe was* And when they had mesured these three
things the Son / the Moon and therthe. They might lightly after inquire of
the other sterres / how much eueriche is nygh or far. And the gretenes of
euerich / Of which they fond none. but his body were of more gretenes than
all therthe is except only three of the planetes without more which ben
Venus. Mercurye. and the Moon / which is the third / and every man may
inquire this. if he know the science of geometrye and the science of
astronomye with all / For that must he know first to fore he may find and
know the truth. But for as much as all be not good clerkis ne maystres of
Astronomye that may prove this. we will recounte here after how much the earth
is long. And how thycke it is through. And also how much the moon is above
therthe. And the son also which is above the moon / And how much each of
them has of gretenes like as the king Tholomeus has prened / And also we
shall speak after that of the sterres and of the firmament / Of all this we
shall say to you / but first tofore all I shall recounte to you of the faytes
and deeds of the king Tholomeus. which knew so many demonstraunces of
apparicions. and so much loved Astronomye that he would search all these
things / And we shall say to you of sum things. which ben not contrary to
you / if ye will well understand and reteyne them by which ye may learn some
good. And then after we shall mesure to you the world the best wise we may /
Now entende ye of the king tholomeus and of the works of sum other
philophers for your own prouffyt.

Of the king Tholomeus and of sum other philosophers / Capitulo xo.
THolomeus was a king much subtyl in Astronomye. This tholomeus was king of
egipte which held the contree long time / There were sometime many kings that
were named Tholomeus / But emonge the other this was he that knew most of
Astronomye and that most enserched of the sterres / and more understood of them
than the other / of which he composed and made plente of right fair volumes
and books / And many diverse instruments by which was found appertly all
the gretenes of therthe / And the heyght of the firmament / And how the sterres
make their course both by night and by day / By him were founden first the
oryloges of the chirches which begin the hours of the days and of the
nyghtes / The days pass fast on wherefore the chirches have great need to have
good orloges. for to do thereby always the seruyse of our lord at hour competent
and due as well by day as by night. For god loves much for to be adoured and
served entyerly and ordynatly every day / For the Orysons that been said and
receyted every day in the chirches playse more to our lord than do they that been said in many other places / And therefore the oryloges ben necessary in
every church. And men serve god the better in due time and fare the better /
and live the longer. For if they ruled so them self to pray at a certain hour
/ And at an other hour in like wise to ete. and other things in his right hour
/ it should be a light thing to do and plese god If men would apply them as
well to such things. as they do to do that which confou^deth and sleeth them
that is to wete that they be al enclyned to conquer the richesses / of which
they cesse not night ne day. And wenen to prolonge their life thereby / But they
amasse and get great tresours / and pourchasse their death / For by ye great
goods that they assemble on all sides / they put them in such thought and
pain that they lose often their wit and understanding. and also their mind
so that they may not enclyne and think on thoo works that towche their
salvation as they ought to do / and by such works should they be in more ease
and live longer and plese better our lord. And should also have more health of
body and of soul / but they love somoche the wynnyng of the goods of the
world / that they leave that which should more avail and prouffyte them. I wot
never wherefore they get this hauoir and good. For they lose thereby the ease of
the world / because when they wene to set them in ease and to be in pees /
Then comes death and makes them to deye with right great sorrow. For the
great couetyse of the good and the pain that they have made all way to get
it without ordinance and mesure has much the more hastelyer brought them to
their death And so ben many men deed / that if they had ordained their affairs
and business as they ought to do at every hour competently and by order /
which yet had been a live and in good health / And lo thus ye may see how they
abredge their days and auaunce their death / For at long nature may not suffer
diverse mayntenes unreasonable ne the sodeyn agrauacions ne griefs / of which
by their folyes they trauaylle nature. and it displesyth much unto god. And
also no good may come thereof / But gladlyer and with better will they traueylle
and more dylygently for to win and get the worldly goods. than the love of
god / And never do they thing by order. One day goon they erly to the church.
and another day late or at such an hour / as they wene that it shall not hurt
them to auaunce their gain and wynnyng / Thus go they never to church for to
pray unto god unto the time that they wene that they shall win no more worldly
goods. But they win the less / For they serve god in vayn / And god shall
render to them their reward. and they shall bye right dear that they leave to
serve him / For he may render to them more merit in one day. than they may
get in a thousand year. Such people ben foles and evil aduysed. when of
naught they wene to serve him that all knows and all sees. ye the lest
thought that they think yet ben there sum / when they go to church they goo
not in entencion to pray god but only for to get the loos and goods of the
world. And pray more for their richesses. that god should keep and multyplye
them than they do for the salvation of their sowles which ben in great parylle
to be perysshed. And it is a great meruaylle of such manner of people / that
think well in their hertes and know well that it is evil that they do / yet for all that they amend them not* of which it is great pity when they so follow
the devil which is so feeble a thing fro whom all euyllis sourden Truly ye
devil is full of inyquyte and without power and strength over any person of
him self / For he may not vainquysshe ne overcome / but him that consents to
his will / For who that will conduyte and rule him self well The inyquytees of
him may not noye ne grieve / ne in nothing trauaylle him / of which he has
cause to sorrow fore / as long as he will dispose him to do well / Then may
well be said / fie. For they ben more than faylled when he ouercometh them so
febly and takes them in their evil deeds and sins and ledeth them to
perdycion / where they never shall be without pain / ne never shall have Joy ne
in no wise have hope of mercy of this purpos we shall say no more now / but
recou^te of king tholomeus / The which employed his time / in the works of
our lord god / out of his books were drawn the nombres of which the years
ben ordained / And of the same is found the course of the moon / By which is
seen when she is new / of such Julius Cezar which of rome was emperor made
a book called the somes / the so^mes / the which is full necessary in holy
church / and it declares the golden nombre of the calendar / For by the
calendar is known the course of the moon / and of all the year / by which is
also known how we ought to live after reason every day / That is to wete in
etyng and drynkyng / and in worshipyng our lord on hye days and simple / and
for to solempnyse such days as holy church has ordained and by blessed
saints establysshed / By the calendar we know the holy times as the ymbre
days / The lent / aduente / And the hye days and festes thet we ben most
bound to serve god / For to get his Inestimable Joy and glory / Which our
lord has promised unto his good and true friends which with good heart serve
him / All this lerneth us the calender / the which was drawn out of
Astronomye which the good king Tholomeus louyd so much and he knew more
than any other man sauf adam which was the first man / For adam knew all the
seven sciences lyberall entyerly without fayllyng of a word / as he that the
creator made and fourmed with his propre hands / And so would our lord have
him souerayn in beauty. in wit and strength. over all them that should be
born after him unto the coming of Ihesu Christ sone of god / The which had
given to him such virtues. Ne never after Adam gaf he so much to one man. ne
never shall. But anon as he had consented and commysed the sin deffended. he
lost so much of his wit and power. that anon he becam a man mortal / And he
was such to fore er he had sinned. that he should never have felt death / Ne
all we descended of him should not have less merit than he / In Joy in
solaas and in deduyt of paradys terrestre all to gydre and born and nouryshed
without sins / And after in heaven gloryfyed. But sith they tasted of the
fruit* which god deffended them his wit and his entendement were so
destroyed and corumped by his sin. that all we abide entetched and foylled
there by / Ne there is nothing under the firmament. but it is werse sythen than
to fore and of less value. Ye the sterres give less light / than they did to
fore / Thus all things empayred of their goodness and virtues by the sin of
Adam / which god had made for man / as he that would make him maystre of all
the goods that he had made / But anon as he had commysed the sin / he felt
him so bare of his wit and entendement strength and of his beauty / that him
seemed he was al naked. and that he had lost all goods as a man put in exyle /
But notwythstondyng this yet abode with him more wit stre^gthe and beauty /
than ever any man had sithe^ And to the regard of these three virtues that adam
had / The king dauyd that was so virtuous and wise had two sons which might
be compared ye one to the beaulte of adam. and that other to his wysedom /
absolon might be compared to his beaulte and salamon unto his wit and wysedom
/ And sampson the forte unto his strength / Thus were these three virtues in
adam so parfyghtly that noman sith might compare with him. Ne the two sons of
david ne sampson / ne none other. For as it is said tofore he knew the vij
sciences liberal better than all the men that been descended of him / as he to
whom his god and maker had taught them to him and erseygned. and after that
they were sought by many a man which rendered great pain / for to find them.
and to save them for cause of the flood / knowing that it should come to the
world by fire or by water.

How the scryptures and sciences were saved ayenft the flood / Capitulo / xjo.
Sith Adam was deed there were many men which learned the sciences of the vij
arts lyberall / which god had sent to them in therthe / Of whom sum there
were that would inquire what should bycome of ye world or ever it should have an
end / And they fond verily / that it should be destroyed and take end twyes.
At the first time by the flood of water / But our lord would not they should
know whether it should be first destroyed by water or by fire. Then had they
great pity for their sciences that they had gotten which they knew / and so
should perisshe But if it were kept and ordained fore by their wysedoms / Then
they aduysed them of a great wit and bounte / as they that well wise / that
after the first destruxcion of the world there should be other people / wherefore
they did do make great pylers of stone in such wise that they might pourtraye
/ and grave in every stone at lest one of the vij sciences entierly in such
wise that they might be known to other Of which sum say that one of thise
pylers was of a stone as hard as. marble / and of such nature that water might
not empayre it ne defface ne mynysshe it / And they made other in a strong
manner of tyles all hole with out any Ioyntures that fire might not hurt it in
no wise. In these great colompnes or pylers as said is were entaylled and
graven the vij sciences in such wise / that they that should come after them /
should find and learn them /

Of them that fond the science and the clergy after the flood / Capitulo xijo.
AS ye may vnrerstonde the seven scyences lyberall were fouuden by ancient
wise men out of which all other sciences proceed. These were they to whom our
lord has given them and enseygned doubtyng the deluuye that god sent in to
therthe / the which drowned all creatures reseruyd Noe and them that he took
in to the arc with him. And after this the world was repeoplyd and made again
by them that descended of them For after the time of noe ye people began to
make again howses and mansions. and to make ready other werkis. but this was
much rudely as they that could but right lytyl unto the time that these
sciences were founden again and then could they better make and do that was
nedeful and propyce to them / And find remedy for their euellys. the first
that applied him and entermeted for to inquire and search these sciences after
the flood was Sem one of the sons of Noe / which had given his corage-therto.
and in such wise he did therein such dylygence and so continued. that by his
wit he fond apartye of astronomye. after him was abraham which also fond a
great party and after him were other that used their lyff the best wise they
might so much that they had the pryncyples and resons of the seven scyences.
And after came Plato the sage and right souerayn in philosophye / and his clerk
named / Aristotle the wise clercke / This plato was the man above all them of
the world in clergy the most expert of them that were to fore or after him.
he preuyd first that there was but one that was only souerayn / which all made
and of whom all good thing comes / yet his lokes approve hyely that there ne
is but one souerayn which all made. And of whom all good thing comes / yet
his books approve hyely that there ne is but one souerayn good. that is our
lord god which made all things. and in this only veryte. he preuyd the right
trouth^ / For he preued his power. his wysedom. and his goodness Theyse thee
bouu^tees reclayme all christian men. that is the fader. the sone / and the holy
ghost. Of the fader he said the power and puyssaunce / Of the sone sapyence /
and of the holy ghost the benyuolence / And arystotle which came after him
holds plente of things nyghe to him / and knew the things that he had said
/ And ordained right well the science of logyke. For he knew more thereof than
of other sciences / These ij. notable clerks fond by their wysedom and
connyng / three persons in one essence / and preuyd it. but they put it not in
latin For both two were paynems. as they that were more tha^ three hundred year
to fore the coming of oue lord Ihu crist And all the books there in grekyssh
lettres / After came boece which was a great philosophre and right wise clerk /
the which could byhelpe him with diverse langages / and louyd much rigtwysnes
/ This boece translated of their books the most party. and set them in
latin / But he deyde er he had all translated them / whereof was great dommage
for us all / Sith have other clerks translated. but this boece translated
more than any other / The which we have yet in usage / And compiled in his
lyff plente of fair volumes aourned of hye and noble philosophye / of which we
have yet great need for tadresse us toward our lord god And many other good
clerks have been in this world of greet auctoryte which have learned and
studied all their time upon the sciences of the seven arts / Of which heue
ben sum that in their time have do meruaylles by Astronomye. But above all
them that most entremeted and traueylled upon the science of astronomye. was
virgile which compyled many merueyllous works. and therefore we shall recounte a
lytyl here following of the meruaylles he did /

Here follow in substance of the meruaylles that virgyle wrought by Astronomye
in his time by his wit Capitulo. xiijo.
UIrgyle the wise philosophre born in Italy was to fore the coming of our
lord Ihesu Christ he set not lytyl by the vij sciences / For he trauaylled
and studied in them ye most part of his time somoche that by a astronomye he
made many great meruaylles / For he made in Naples a fly of copper / Which
when he had set it up in a place / That fly enchaced and hunted away all
other flies. so that abide none in any place ne durst not approach nyghe to
that fly by the space of two bow shote round a bowte / And if any fly
passed the bound that Vyrgyle had compassed. Incontinent he should deye / and
might no longer live He had also an horse of bras / the which guarysshed and
heled all horses of all their maladyes and sekenesses of which they were
entetched. also soon as the seek horse looked on the horse of brass / Also he
founded a merueyllouse cite upon an egg by such force and power / that when
the egg was moved. all the cite quaued and shoke. And the more the egg was
moved / the more the cite quaued and trembred / The cite in hie and low and
plain / The fly of copper. and horse of brass that Vyrgyi^e thus made ben in
Raples. And the cage where the egg is in. all ben there seen. This has be
said to us of them / that be comen fro thens* that many times has seen them.
Also he made that in one day all the fire thrughe out Rome failled. and was
quenched / in such wise that no person might have none. But if he went and
fette it at the nature of a woman with a candell or otherwise. And she was
daughter of the emperor and a great lady / which to fore had done to him a
gre^e sclaundre and dysplaysure. and all they that had fette fire at her /
might not adresse it to other. but eueryche that would have fire must needs
goo fette it there as the other had fette it. And thus avenged he him on her.
for the dysplaysure that she had done to him / And he made a bridge upon a
water. the greteste that ever was made in the world / And is not known of
what matter it is made / whether it is of stone or of wode. But there was never
w^rkman so subtle ne carpenter ne mason / ne other that cowde somoche know ne
enserche within the earth / ne within the water. that they might know and
find how that bridge was there set ne how it was sustyned in no manner / ne
at ends. ne in the mids. and men passed over freely / And all without
lettynge / He made also a garden all a boute round closed with thayer.
without any other closure / which was as thycke as a cloud. And this gardyne
was right hye fro therthe / He made also two tapres and a lau^pe light and
brennynge in such wise that it contynuelly brenned without quenchyng. and
mynushed ne lessed no thing / Thise three things he enclosed within the earth
in such wise that no man can find it / For all the craft they can do / Yet
made he an head to speak / Which answered of all that which he was demanded
of. And of that which should happen and (...) in the earth / So on a day he
demanded of the head how he should do unto in a certain work where as he
sh^lde goo unto. But the head answered to him in such wise that he understood
it not well. For it said that if he keped well the head / he should come again
all hole / and with this answer he went his way well assured / But the son
which that day gaaf great hete smote him on the head and chauffed his brain
/ of which he took no head / that he gate thereby a sekenes and malady / whereof
he deyed. For when he had the answer of the head that he understood not that
he spoke of his head / but he understood of the head that spak to him / but it
had be better that he had kept well his own head And when he felt him self
agreued with sickness. he made him to be borne out of rome. For to be buried
in a castle. being toward Sezyle / and a mile nyghe the sea / Yet ben there
his bones / which ben better kept than others ben And when the bones of him
ben remeued / The sea begins to encreace and swell so greatly that it comes
to the castle. And the hyer they ben raised up. The hyer grows the sea in
such wise that the castle should be drowned if they were not anon remysed and
set in their place but then when they be set again in their place anon
the sea aualeth. and gooth away there as it was to fore / And this has be
oftymes proved / and yet endure the virtues of him as they say that have been
there / Virgyle was a much sage and subtyl clerk and full of great engyne /
For unto his power he would preue all the vsages of clerks / as much as was
possible for him to know / He was a man of lytyl stature / alytyl courbed was
he on the back by right nature. And went his heed hangyng down and beholydyng
the ground / Virgyle did and made many great meruaylles / which the herers
should hold for lesynges if they herd them recounted / For they would not
believe that a another could do such thing / as they could not meddle with. And
when they here speak of such matters or of other that they see at their eyes.
And that they / can not understand ne know not thereof / Anon they say that
it is by thelpe of the fend that werketh in such manner. as they that gladly
myssaye of people of recommendacion. And also say it is good not to conne
such things. but if they knew the science and manner. they would hold it for
a much noble and right work of nature. and without any other espece of evil
/ And when they know not ne understand the thing / they say much more
evil than well. Certainly who that knew well Astronomye there is nothing in the
world. of which he could inquire by reason / but he should have knowledge thereof.
And many things should he do. that should seem miracles to the people which
that knew nothing of the science / I say not but there might be well don
evil by him that could it. For there is none so good science. but that might be
intended therein sum malice. and that he might use it in evil thar would so
apply him thereto God made neuerso good a gospel. but sum might tonrne it
contrary to truth / and there is no thing so true / but sum might so gloss
that it might be to his dampnac^on who that would pain him to do evil / how
well it is no maystrye to do ill. Eueri man has the power to draw him sylf to
do well. or to do evil / which that he will / as he that has fre liberte of
that one and of that other / if he give him sylfe to virtues. this goodness
comes to him fro our lord and if he be enclyned to do evil. that brings him
at the end to sorrow and to pain p^erpetuell / Never shall the evil disposed man
say well / of that he can not well understand and know / There is no craft.
ar^e ne science / but it is good to be known when a / man wol give and apply
/ him self thereto / But late him do no thing against god by which he leseth
his grace All thing is known by Astronomye sauf such thing as god will
that it he not known. And so it is better to learn that than to learn to
amasse and gader to gyder great tresours / For who that could / Astronomye
properly. he should have all that he would have on earth / For him should faill
no thing what someuer he would. and yet more / But they had lever have the
money / And they know not that it is of Astronomye ne wherefore money was
founden. how well that they apply all their entendement for to have it* But
they retche not for to learn. sauf that which they know shall redou^de to
their singular prouffyt / And yet for all that we shall not leave / but that we
shall recyte sum caas for them that have talente for to learn / And late him
herkyn and take heed that will understand it /

Here declares for what cause monoye was first establisshid. Capitulo. xiiijo.
THe monoyes were establysshed / first for as much as they had not of all
things necessary to gydre That one had whete / another had wyn / and another
cloth or other wares / he that had whete / had not wyn without he changed one
for another. and so must they daily change one for another. For to have that
they had not. as they that knew none other mean. When the philosophers saw
this / they did so much that they establisshed with the lords sometime
regnyng / a lytyl light thing which eueri man might bear with him to bye that
was nedeful to him and behoefful for his life. and so ordained by advise to
gydre a thing which was not over dear ne holden for over vile. And that it
were of sum valor for to bye and use with all true marchandyse one with
another. by virtue of such enseygne / And that it were comune ouerall and in
all manner / And establed then a lytyl money which should go^ and have course
through the world / And by cause it lad me^ by the way and mynystred to them
that was necessary it was called monoye. That is as much to say. as to give
to aman all that him be houeth for his living. Monos in grekyssh langage is as
much to say. as one thing only / For then was but one manner of monoye in
all ye world But now every man makes monoye at his playsir by which they
desuoye and goo out of the way more than if there were but one coin only / For
by this cause is seen often plente of diverse monoyes. Thus establysshed not the
philosophers / For they establysshed for to save the state of the world. And I
say it for as much if the monoye were out of grotes and pens of silver so
then it should be of less weight and less of valewe / and that should be
better for to bear by the way for pour folk / and better should be easid for
the help of their needs to their living / And for none other cause it was
ordained first. For the monoyes be not preysed but for the gold and silver that
is therein / And they that establisshed it first / made it right lytyl and light
/ For the more ease to be born al about. where men would goo. for now In late
days as in the beginning of the regne of king Edward and long after was no
monoye curraunt in England but pens and half pens and ferthynges. And be
ordained first the grote and half grote of silver / And noble half noble and
ferthyng in gold /

Here follows of philosophers that went through the world Capitulo / xvo.
THus the philosophers by the moyen of their monoye went where they would
through the world. And the marchantes / in their marchandyses. or in pylgremages
/ o^ in pourchacyng and enquyryng sum places that they would know of* whom
there were many which were philosophers / and that would have experyence of all
things and they went by see and by land for tenserche the very truth of
the secret things of heaven and of earth / They rested them not by the great
fyres ne brassed not as some do now in these days in the world the which
give them to do no good ne apply to no virtues / but if it be to have the
loos and preysyng of the world. But they went serchyng by the sea and the
land on all parties for to know the better the good and the evil. and for
to conne discerue that one fro that other / by which they endured many great
trauaylles for to get the saving of their sowles. and at this day all men
seche to get rychesses and tresour. and the name to be called maystre for to
get loving and honor of the world / which so hastily faylleth / Certainly an
evil man may not think on hye things. For who that is of earth to therthe
entendeth. And who pretends to god. God attends to him / for god him self
says who that is of therthe speaks of therthe / And who that comes fro heaven
unto heaven pretends he without other. The philosophers that well could
understood this word. had much lever to suffer trauaylles and mesayses for
to learn / tha^ tendende to worldly honors / For they held for more dear and
worthy the sciences and the clergyes. than all the seygnoryes of the world
Plato which was a puissaunt and a reco^mended maystre of Athenes left his
noble estate and his place by cause he would of such renommee live / that he
serched many lands and contrees / And had lever have pain. mesayse and
trauayll for tenserche truth / and for to learn science than for to have

and the world / Which he loved better than any other worldly thing and he
went so far that he fond syttyng in a Trone of gold an hye philosophre and
of great renommee / the which enseygned and taught his disciples within his
trone where he satte / and learned them of the faytes of nature of good mauers /
the course of the days and of the sterres And the reason and sygnefiaunce of
things touching of sapience and wysedom. This philosophre was named hyarchas.
Affter appolynes serched by many contrees so far that he fond the table of
fyn gold which was of great renommee / that it was named the table of the
son. wherein all the world was pourtrayed Therein saw he and learned many
faytes and many meruaylles. Which he loved more than any Royamme / he erred so
far by strange lands that he passed the flood of Ganges and all Inde / and
in the end so far. that he might find no more way. and where someuer he came
he fond and learned alleway. such as might auaylle and prouffyte to him self
and other for tauau^ce him tofore god / Thus the king alysaunder also suffered
trauaylles without nombre for to learn / But he went fro place to place in
estate ryall / And with puyssance of people / wherefor he might not so well
learn ne inquire the truth of things / Virgyle also went through many
contrees for to inquire and search the truth of all things / Tholomeus
which of Egypt was king was not all quyte of his part. but went by many
contrees and Royammes for to learn. experymente and see all the good clerks
that he might find. Saint Brandon never left for to labor by see and by
land / For only to see and learn / And he saw plente of great meruaylles. For
he came in to an isle of the sea / Where he saw certain birds which spoke as
spyrites. which said to him somtchyng which he demanded of them the
understanding / And so far he erred that he fond one so perylous a place and
so full of spirits in so terryble tormentys / that they could not be nombred

Judas that betrayed Ihu christ which every day was tormented an hundred times

recou^ted in the legende of his life / There were many other philosophers that
serched ye world as was possible for them to do for to know the better the
good and the evil and spared for nothing / For they byleued not lightly a
thing till they knew it well by experience Ne all that they fond in their
books. to fore they had preuid it for to know god the better and to love him
But they serched by see and by land / till they had enserched all / and then
after returned again to their studyes alleway for to learn the virtues and good
manners / And thus loved so much philosophye / For to know them self the
better in good and just life. But by cause that many times we have spoken of
philosophye and that somoche good comes thereof that a man have thereby
understanding to know and love god / therefore we shall tell to you what it
signefyeth /

What thing is philosophye / and of thanswer that plato made thereof. Capitulo.
xvjo.
UEray Phylosophye is to have knowleche of god and fyn love of sapience. And to
know the secrets and ordynaunces of dyuyne things. and of humayne / For to
know god and his power. and what a man ought to be. So that he might conduyte
him that it might be to god agreeable. Who that well knew god and his mysteryes
/ he should well conne entyerly philosophye / All they ben good philosophers
that of them self have knowleche. Of whom plato answered to sum that demanded
him in comune / and said to him that he had learned ynowh and needs no more. For
he had estudyed all his time for to learn. And it was said to him. Maystre it
is well in you for to say to us. sum good word proceeding of hye entendement.
as ye have don other times / Then plato how well that he was the most
experymented of other answered saying as in his heart troubled. that he had
no more learned sauf as much as he that felt him self like unto a vessel that
day and night is all void and empty / Thus much answered Plato and no more. how
well he was at that time the most great clerk that was known in all ye world
and of much perfou^de science. they that on these days will meddle. take non
head to answer thus. but make semblaunt to be much great clerkis and expert
/ for to get the loos and preysyng of the world which le^eth them to
dampnacyon And brings their folly in to their hedes so that they entende
no more to virtues than do bestis. For they be not all clerks that have short
typettis. For there be many that have the Array of a clerk. that can not well
understand that he redeth. ne yet sum that be prestis can notwele and truly
read neither. And when such know any thing that them seem be of value.
Then wene they to know all But much remains of their folyshe consayte /
They be of the nature of proud foolis that been surquydrous. that seche
nothing but loos and preysyng of the people / And traueylle them self for to
deceive the world. This shall they abye dear ones. It were better for them to
learn such science / that should make them to understand truth and right /
Like as these Ancient wise men did / the which so little preysed the world
/ that all their time they ocupyed in lernyng of philosophye. Thus estudyed
auncyently the philosophers to fore their death for tadresse them and other to
their maker and creator / And in deed traueylled much for to adresse all
people to wertue / They ordained the monyes that they bare for to have their
lyuelode in byenge and payeng / For men give not always And for couetyse of the
people that / have fere of their dyspentes. it corumpeth right and nature / For
by reason and right eueryche ought to take his living / And therefore was money
establisshed for to susteyn to eueryche his living when they went by the way.
But they love their caraynes and bodies much more than need is / And reteyne
and keep more goods and richesse than they shall need for their ordynary /
which they let rote and fail by them / And see that many pour persons
have great need thereof / The monyes were not found for this cause. but for to
have their living unto the time that death comes and takes all that he ought
to take at the playsur of god / And thus they shol^e be more eased. than they
now be and eueryche should have that him lacked / and they should leave to do so
many sins. But they ben not so wise as were they / that by their wit
found again Astronomye / of whom Tholomeus was on^. And traueylled so much /
that he knew and proved the course of the sterres that been on the heaven. and
mesured them all on hie / whereof we have spoken here to fore / And now we
shall recounte from hens forth the gretnes of the earth. and of heaven. of the Moon / of the Son. of the Sterres and of the planetes. Which things ben not
comune to every man: Like as the king Tholomeus him self mesured them unto
the Abysme. And preued by reason in a book that he compyled named Almageste.
which ye as much to say as an hye work / Then will ye here what he says
herto. Which many a another has also proved after him by his book / In
whichehe gaaf the craft and science to prove and see it by reyson.

How much the earth is of heyght round about and of thickenes by the myddle
/ Capitulo xvij
THe anncyent philosophers mesured the world on all parties / by their science
/ art and wit unto the ste^res all on hie / of which they would know the
mesure. For to know the better their nature / but first they would mesure the
earth and preue his gretnes / And then when they had mesured there all a bout
by a craft that they knew. and proved by right reyson / they mesured it
round about. like as they should have compassed it all about with a gyrdle.
And then^e they stratched out the gyrdle all a long And then that which
went out of length of the gyrdle. they fond it in length xx M.CCCC. and xx
vij. miles / Of which every mile conteyneth a thousand paas and eueri paas v.
foot / and eueri foot xiiij inches / So much has the earth in length round
a boute / by this fond they after how thycke therthe is in the myddle. And
they fond the thycknes thereof like as it should be clefte in the mids from
the hieste to the loweste / Or from that one side to that other vj.M. and v.C
miles / By this last mesure / which is after nature right they mesured justly
the heyghte of the firmament / For they could nowhere find a gretter mesure
for to extend the gretnesse of all things which ben enclosed within the
heaven /

How the moon and the son have each of them their propre heyghte. Capitulo

THerthe as the ancient philosophers say / after they had mesured it / there
mesured the sterres / the planetes and the firmamente / And first they mesured
the moon and preuyd his gretnesse / And they fond the body of therthe without
and wythinne / that after their comune mesure it was more great / than the body
of the moon was / by xxix times and a lityl more / And they fond that it was
in heyght above the earth xxiiij times and an half as much as therthe has of
thycknes. Also in like wise preuyd they touching the son by very
demonstraunce and by reason / that the son is gretter than all therthe is. by
an hundred syxty and six sythes. But they that know nothing hereof / uneath
and with great pain will believe it / And yet it is suffysantly preuyd / as well
by maystryse of science / as by verray connyng of geometrye Of which have been
many sith the philosophers that fond this first / that have studied and
traualled for to know the truth / If it were so as is said / or not /
Somoche that by quyck reason they have preuyd that thauncyent Philosophers had
said truth as well of the quantyte of the Son as of the heyght / And as to
the regard of him that compyled this work / he set all his intent and time.
By cause he had so great meruaylle thereof. Till he had perceived plainly that
of which he was in doubt / For he saw appertly that the Son was gretter
than all therthe without any defaulte by an.C.lxvj. times. And three parties of
the xx. part of therthe / with all this that thauncyent philosophers said And
then byleuyd he that / which was give him to understood / And he had never
put this in writing. if he had not certainly known the truth / and that he
plainly had proved it And it may well be known that it is of great quantyte
When it is so much far fro us / and seems to us so lytyl / Ne he shall never
be so far aloue us. But in like wise he shall be as far when he is under or
on that other said of us And for truth it is fro therthe unto the son life
as the king Tholomeus has prouyd it / five hundred lxxx. and v times as much
as therthe may have of gretenes and thycknes through /

Here follows of the heyght of the sterres and of their gretenesse / Capitulo.
xixo.
NOw will I recounte to you briefly / of the sterres of the firmament of which
there is a right great nombre / And they ben all of one heyghte / but they ben
not all of one gretenes. And it behooves over long narracio^ that of all
them would descryue the gretenes / And therefore we pass lightly over and
shortly / how well I aduertyse you and certefye. that there is none so lytyl of
them that ye may see on the firmament / but that it is gretter than all therthe
is / But there is none of them so great ne so shynyng as is the son. For he
enlumyneth all the other by his beaulte / which is so much noble / Fro
therthe unto the heaven wherein the sterres ben set in a much great espace /
for it is tenthousand and lv. sythes as much and more as is all therthe of
thycknes / And who that could ^ccou^te after the nombre and form / he might
know how many inches it is of the hand of a man. And how many feet / how many
miles. and how many Iourneyes. It is from hens to the firmament or heaven. For
it is as much way unto the heaven / As if a man might goo the right way without
lettyng. and that he might goo every day xxv mile of france. which is.I.
englisshe mile. and that he tarried not on the way / Yet should he goo the time
of seven M.j.C. and lvij year and an half. er he had goon somoche way as fro
hens unto the heaven where the sterres be in. If the first man that god fourmed
uer. which was Adam. had goon fro the first day that he was made and created
xxv miles every day / yet should he not have comen thither / But should have yet
the space of vij.C.xiij year to goo at the time when this volume was performed
by the very auctour. And this was at Epyphanye in the year of grace.i M.ij*C.
and xlvj. that time should he have had so much to goo / Er he should come theder
/ Or if there were there a great stone which should fall fro thens unto therthe
/ it should be an hundred year er it came to the ground / And in the falling it
should defcende in every hour of which the^ be xxiiij in a day complete.xliij
mile and an half Yet should it be so long er it came to therthe. This thing
has be proved by him that compiled this present volume er he came thus far in
this work / this is well xl. times more than an h^rs may goo. which alleway
should goo. with outrestynge /

Here follows of the nombre of sterres. Capitulo. xxo.
TO the regard of the sterres we shall say to you the nombre like as the noble
king Tholomeus nombred them in his. Almageste / to whom he gaf the propre
names. And said that there were a thousand and xxij. clear. and that might be
all seen. without the vij planetes. and may be well acounted without any paryll.
In all there be j M. and xxix / which may well be seen without many other
which may not well be seen ne espied / There may not well moo be espied but so
many as said is ne appertly be known / Now late him behold that will see it /
For noman trauaylle he never so much ne study / may find no more.
Nevertheless there is no man living that may or can compte. so much. or can so
hye mou^te in any place / though hebe garnysshid of a much gentyl instrument /
and right subtyl that should find moo / than the king tholomeus fond by
which he knew and might nombre them. and where eueryche sits / and how
far it is from one to an other / be it of one or other or nygh or far. And
the knowledge of the images of them. the which by their semblaunce fourmed them
For the sterres which be named. ben of figures on the heuone and compassed by
images. and that all have diverse beynges. And eueriche has his form and his
name / Of which ben known pryncypally xlvij within the firmament. And of them
ben taken xij of the most worthy which ben called the xij. Signs. And they
make a cercle round about the vij planetes where as they make their torn /
we ben much far from heaven merueyllously. And late every man know that he
that deyeth in dedly sin. shall never come theder. And the blyssyd soul
which is departed fro the body in good estate. not wythstondyng the long way
is sone come thither / ye truly in less than half an hour / and unto the most
hye place to fore the souerayn judge which sits on the right side of god the
fader in his blessed heaven / the which is so full of delites of all glory and
of all consolacyon. that there is no man in this world living that may ne can
esteem or think the Joy and the glory where this blessed souls enters / And
there is no man that can esteem ne think the capacyte and gretnes of heaven / ne
may compare it ne valewe it to the capacyte and gretnes of all therthe / or so
much as may comprise fro therth to the firmament. As to the regard of the
estymabyl gretnes above the firmament. ffor the gretnes is inestymable with
out end and with out mesure. Certes the firmame^te on hye is so so spacyus
so nobyl and so large. that of all his wit may not a man uneath think or
esteem. the number of like masses as all therthe is / that should fylle yt. if
they were all in one mass / Who is he that could or might co^prehende or
compryse the grenes of them. When they all be assembled And euerich as great as
all therth. Nevertheless we shall say to you thereof. as much as we may well
ymagyne.

Of the gretenes of the firmament. and of the heuene which is a boue yt.
Capitulo. xxjo.
IF the earth were so great and so spacyous. and so much more for to reseyue
an hundred thousand times as much pepyl as ever were in this world / and every
man of them were so mighty for to engender a another man every day during / an
hondreth thousand year / and that every man were as great as a Geaunt / and
every man had his hows as great as ever had any king. and woods ryuers
cha^panyes gardyns medowe and pastures and vyneyerdes. eueych a boute his
castle or place for to live with / and that each had so great foyson / that
euerych might hold / an hondreth servants for to serve him. and euerych of
this seruau^te held xx other. and had thereto great room and pourpris in their
manner / All these might much plenty^usly be reseruyd in the firmament and yet
should there be much place void* more tha^ all they might purprise and take
for to play and disporte them therein if they would / Then ought we well to
know / that our lord god is much mighty. and of right hye affayre / when he
can make of naught so noble a thing / as the heaven / and the son / and
all other things that been on the heaven in thayer. on therth and in the Sea /
Such a lord and such a master ought well to be good that can make so noble
things / of which we have very knowleche. and we ought parfytli to love him
/ And well we may every man think that the thing that is a boue is much
gentyl and much nobyl / when it that is under is so subtyl / ffor that which
is above is more great an hundred thousand times than it which is benethe /
and over much more than can be known or may be compted by any nombre / or may
be thought / For this is a thing that in no manner shall have end ne term /
Therefore I may well understand / that theris nothing that may pourpryse / ne
esteem in gretenes ne other wise this which is above the firmament / where the
heuene takes his place ne may be replenysshid ne filled with nothing that may
be / but if it be with the goods of our lord god fyllyd / but the right
debonayre lord is so much full of all goods that be fylleth all other
things / which ought to have part and merit in goods / And the evil
departs fro the good in such wise that it is void and disgarnysshed from
all goods what someuer it be / and that it shall be like as it were naught
whereof it is read hereof. that sin is naught / for as much as it is void
and disgarnysshid of all goods and rendrid ye body and the soul somoche feeble
and disgarnysed of all goods of all virtues / and of all graces that / that
one is totally dystroyed and perysshed with that other / ffor all way the
evil comes to naught / And contrary the good goth always growyng and in
amendyng / And therefore there is none evil but sin which is naught / For ye
may understand that it comes to naught as donge / The is nothing that ought
to be made right / But be only this that ought to be permanent / And therefore it
is good aman to hold him nyghe the good. For the good amendeth al ways / And
who that customly does gladly the good works / they ben the cause to lead him
to heuene / as he that has none other wythdraughte ne other dwelling place /
And therefore he must enhabyte there / him behooves to come in to heuene for to
reteyne there his place / and also for to fylle it There is noman in the world
that can do so much good but that he shall always find his place / and his
repair propyce after his merits. ffor as much as this so much noble a place
is without end and without term in such wise that no goods what someuer
they be shall never have term ne end. ne never shall have defaulte. but it is
contynuelly full of all consolacion / of all delices of all goods of all
Joy and of all gladness / without having any thing void. Of which they
that deserve it of our lord shall have full possession of all the inestimable
goods. Of hell I may freely say to you. that there is nothing sauf sorrow and
martyrdom / truly the most anguysshous the most horrible and so much sorrowful
that there is no like And if so were that the children that have been sith. Adam
were all dampened yet it might not be filled by them / though they were twyes so
many more / and they that be theryn perisshed* shall be dampened and perpetuelly
tormented. ffor after that they be dampened they shall abide ever as long as god
shall be which is without beginning and without endyng And there they shall
brenne in fire eternel without hope of alegeaunce of any mercy of any hope to
have any better but alleway werse fro time. to time / as it is so that the
saved sowles desire ye day of dome and of judgment for to be gloryfied in body
and soul / The dampened sowles redoubte and dread it thinking that after that
day they shall be perpetuelly tormented in body and in soul. And to that
dredeful day they be not tormented in the body / but in the soul / And I have
recyted this thing shortly to this end that it may be known certainly that
there is no good deed but it shall be rewarded ne none evil deed but that it
shall be punysshed This is the will of the creator And maker of all things
without whom there is none that in any manner has any power / and heis so much
a debonayer lord full of souerayn puissau^ce and of great and of infynyt goods
that there is no comparyson to him. And he that all thing created / made and
establisshid of naught at his playsyr and will / But sith we have spoken to you
of the inestimable gretenesse of the firmament wherein the sterres be set
which alleway is in moeuyig / so shall ye understand that there is an heaven
above Where they that been there moeue nothing. but ben contynuelly in one
estate. like as so^me man remeuyth him from some place to another. the first
place meuyd him not / But he that should goo so al about like round about a
circle. should often goo fro place to place er he come to his place. and so long
he might goo that he should come right to the place fro whens he departed first
/ But that place should not meue / but hold him always in a point. now will ye
thus understood of this heaven / that there is no manner place that is remeuyd
fro the sterres ne fro the firmament. but they hold them. also fermly all. as
they most may. this heaven must be understand by them which ben
Astronomyers. This is that gives to us his color blew. the which estendeth
above thayer. the which we see when thayer is pure and clear all about / And
it is of so great attemperaunce / that it may have no violence. this is the
heaven that encloseth the firmament / Now I shall say you all appertly* that
this that ye may understand here tofore. by heeryng. may not be taken ne
known / ne be proved if it be truth or non. ne may not be by any art of
demonstraunce. like as may be seen by eyes. For the wit of a man has not the
power. But nevertheless we shall say to you this that we truly may find by
writing in certain places like as so^me Ancient philosophers have ymagyned and
thought / of which they fond certain resons /

Here after follows of the heaven crystalyn and of the heuene imperyall /
Capitulo. xxij
Above this heaven that we may see blew as said is / after that thau^cient
clerks say / there is another heuene all round about that above and bynethe
/ like as it were of the color of white cristall. clear. pure. and much
noble. and is called the heaven crystalyn. and above this heaven cristalyn. all
round about that / is an other heaven of the color of purple. like as the
deuynes say and that is called the heaven imperyal / This heuene is garnysshid
and full of all beaultees / more than any of ye other that we have named / and
there is thayer seven times more fair and more clear than is the son. Fro
this heaven Imperyall fylle the evil angeles by their pride yt which were
disgarnysshid of all glory and of all goods / And there ben the blessed
Angeles of our lord /

Here follows of the Celestyall heuene. Capitulo xxiij
IF ye will understand for to know of this heuene celestyall / which is above
all the other / ye shall understand that this place is right worthy and blyssyd
in all things / wherefore there may nothing grow / but all goodenesse and
swetnesse by reason and right / This is the propre place of the holy trynyte
where as god the fader sytteth in his right worthy mageste. but in that place
faylleth thentendeme^t of any erthely man / for there is nowher so good a
clercke that may think the x. part of the glory that is there / and if our
lord pourpryseth any place / him behooves to have that by right / but he is so
comune oueral / that he sees every man that has deseruyd it against him and
sees all things here and there / He sees all about as he that has all
things in his keeping / of which ye may take ensample / by so^me wha^ ye here
them speak / that all they of whom they here the tale they here his word. many
men understood al attones / and in one time here every man hereth al ye word
/ In like wise may ye understand that god is oueral and regnyng oueral in
every place / and is in all places anon and attones / And the light and
clerenes that grows of him enlumyneth all things both here and there and
also soon that one as ye other example if ye set above many things a light.
also soon shall ye resplendour go on the side by yonde it. as on the side on
this side it. when such things have like virtue. over much more ought he to
have / that al thing made and created. and that all goods has within him his
heaven stratched oueral as he* which of all is lord and maistre In heaven ben
all thangeles all tharcha^geles and all the saints which sing all to gydre
to for god glory and lawde with right great Joy and co^solacion. There is none
that may compryse. ne heart of man mortal may understand what thing is
heuene. and how much great Joy they have to whom he has given and granted
it the best clerk of the world the most subtyl. and the best spekyng with all
yt ever was living in earth or ever shall be in any time of ye world and thaugh
he had a thousand tongues speaking. and euerich of the tongues spack by him
self. and also had a thousand hertes within his body the most subtyle and the

might be to gydre in the body of a man and after might think always the best
wise that they could descryue and deuyse thestate of heaven. And that every
tongue might say and declare the intencion of every heart. yet might they
never in no manner of the world say ne recounte the thousand part of the great
Joy that the pourest and leest of them that shall be there shall have. and foul
be he that shall not be there. ffor they that shall be in heuene would not be all
the days of ye world lords and kings of all ye Monarchye of the world
erthly thaugh all their comma^dements might be observed and don not for to ben
one only hour out of heaven. ffor there is the life perdurable / and there is the
parfyght / and inestimable Joy that ever was and ever shall be / There in every
thing is establysshed and ^tayn for evermore without end and without
beginning ne never shall faille. ne there shall never be any doubtannce of death
ne of maladye of sorrow of anguysshe ne of dread of anger of trauayll of pain
ne of poute of caytifnes ne of any tribulacio^ that ever may hap in any
manner of the world to him that shall have his ma^syon in heuene. But he shall be
continuelly in Joy in solace. in all delices and in all goods perdurable and
without end. and he shall have more consolacion than any man can think ne
esteem thaugh he employe all his engyen for to understand it. Now for to know
what it is of heuene. and of hell after our declaracion to fore said / and
with this the firmame^te the sterres and the seven planetes I present them to
you here on that other syte. of this leef by a figure / by which ye may much
prouffyte. if ye will well apply and employe thereto your entendemente.

Her follows the recapitulacio^ of the things tofore said Capitulo. xxiiij.
With this we shall make an end of our book. the which at his beginning
speaks of our lord god wherefore he fourmed the world. and why he loved man so
well that he fourmed him to his semblau^ce / and gaf him power to do well and
evil / After why he made him not such. that he might not sin dedely. and how
first were founden the vij. sciences and the arts / Sith it speaks of three
manner of people ye thau^cyent philosophres put in the world / how nature werketh
and what she is and how she diuersefyeth in euerich of her works / also ye
have herd of the facion of the world and of ye division of the four eleme^tes.
which ben round about. and hold them on the firmament / And how the earth
heldeth him withyn the firmament. Also ye have herd of the lytylues of therthe
unto the regard of heaven. And also how son makes his course all about
therthe / And the other planetes in like wise / all this have ye herd in the
first party: In the second party is declared to you / which part of
therthe is Inhabyted and of the dyuysion of mappa Mundi / And first it speaks
of paradys terrestre / and of the contrees and regyons of Inde. and of the
dyuersytees that been there of men. of beestes. of trees / of stones / of birds
/ and of sum fysshes that been there. And who so hell the dolourous place is

flodes and of the fontaynes hoot and cold. holsom and evil which ben in dyuse
co^trees / and how ye see bycometh salt how the earth quaueth and synketh. and
after of ye air how it blows and rayneth. of tempests and of thondres. of
fire of layte / and of the sterres which seem as they fylle. of pure air and
of ye vij planetes. how the bysexte comes. of ye firmament and of his tornyng.
and of the sterres that been round about therein / In the third party ye have
herd how the day and night come / and of the moon and of the son how they
render their light / and how each of them leseth their clerenes by night and by
day sometime and of the eclipse yt then hap whereby the day bycometh derke.
and of ye great eclipse that fylle at death of our lord Ihu christ. by which
saint dionis was afterward con^ted. and of the virtue of ye firmament and of
the sterres. and how ye world was mesured and the heaven and therthe Of the
king tholomeus and of his prudence of Adam and of some other and how clergy
and the un sciences were kept against the flood and how all this was founden
again after the flood / and of the meruaylles that virgyle made by his wit
and clergy. and for what cause monoye was so named and establysshed and of the
philosophers that went through the world for to learn what thing is
philosophye and what plato answerde thereto / how much ye earth. ye moan and
the son have of gretenes euerich of him self and thestages of the sterres of
their nombre and of there images yt heyght and gretenes of the firmament and of
ye blew heaven which is above that and of the heuene crystalyn and of the heaven
imperial and as ye have herd in the end of the heuene celestyal and of his
estate and of god which may be over all by his glory and his bou^^e of all
thise things ye have herd us recounte and tell and rendrid to you many fair
resons bryefly / For the princes and other people ben nothing curyous to here
lo^^^ gloses without great entendeme^t but love better short things. as they
yt ben not of long time. but pass bryefly / ffor in a short time they be
fynisshed and end. And all we shall come more shortly than we would to naught
/ ffor this world passes fro time to time like as the wind and faylleth fro
day to day and makyth to euerych a lityl seiournyng. ffor it is so full of
vanyte / that there nys but lityl truth theryn / and it happeth oftymes that
he that weneth lengest to soiourne here is he that leest while abides and that
sonnest takes his e^de and therefore for I counseille every man that each pain
and trauaylle him self to live well and truly for the lityl time that he has
for to abide in this world full of tribulacio^s and miseries. ffor there is none
that knows what hour or time the death shall come run on him and it often
happeth that he or she that weneth yet to live and play in this world.vj /
or.viij. or.x / year / that he deyeth in less than five days and fyndeth him
self dampened and cast down in to the brennyng fornays of hell. and then is
he in a good hour born and well aduysed when at his end he is taken in the
seruyse of our lord. and nothing in the worldly voluptuositees and dampnable.
and that his maker has lent^ to him to understand him and that he have time
and space / ffor god shall render to him so rich a yefte and so fair that he
shall have all goods at his abandon with the Joy perdurable of heuene The
which to us be granted by the creator and redemptour of the world in whom
all pity and mercy haboundeth. and in whom be all goods and virtues what
someuer have been. ben. and shall ben perdurably without end.

Thus fynysshith the book called thymage or myrrour of the world the which in
speaking of god and of his works in estimable has bygonne to enter in matter
speaking of him and of his hye puyssances and dominacions / and takes here an
end: ffor in all begynnynges and in all^ operacions the name of god ought to
be called. As on him without whom all things ben naught / Then he so
ottroye and grant to us so to begin / persevere. and fynysshe that we may
be brought and receyuyd in to his blessed glory in heuene unto the blessed
Trynyte / Fader / Sone / and holy ghost / Which lives and regneth without end
in secula seculorum Amen /

ANd where it is so. that I have presumed and emprysed this foresaid translacyon
in to our englisshe and maternall tongue / In which I am not well parfyght /
And yet less in frensshe / Yet I have endeuourd me therein / at request and
desire cost and dispense of the honorable and worshipful man / Hughe Bryce
Cytezeyn and Alderman of london / Which has said to me that he entendeth to
present it / unto the puissaunt noble and virtuous lord My lord hastynges.
Chamberlayn unto our souerayn lord the King / And his lyeutenaunt of the town
of Calays and marches there / In which translacion I knowleche my self simple

pardonne me of this rude and simple translacion. how be it / I l^^e for mine
excuse / that I have to my power followed my copye / And as nygh as to me is
possible. I have made it so plain that every man reasonable may understand it /
If he aduysedly and ententyfly read or here it / And if there be fault in
mesuryng of the firmament / Son / Moan / or of therthe. or in any other
meruaylles herin contained I beseech you not tarette the fault in me but in
him that made my copye. which bock I began first to translate the second day
of Ianyuer the year of our lord / M.CCCC.^xxx. And fynysshyd the viij day of
March the same year / And the xxj year of the Regne of the most Christian king.
King Edward the fourth. Under the shadow of whose noble proteccion I have
emprysed and fynysshed this said lytyl work and book. Besechynge Almighty god
to be his protector and defendour again all his Enemies and give him grace to
sudue them / And inespeciall them that have late enterprysed again right and
reason to make war within his Royamme. And also to preserve and mayntene him
in long life and prosperous health. And after this short and transytorye life he
bring him and us in to his celestyall bliss in heuene AMEN /
