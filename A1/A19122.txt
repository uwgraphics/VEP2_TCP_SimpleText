The Spectacle to Repentance.

Matthew. xviii. Woe to the world because of offenses, for it must needs be that
offenses shall come, but woe be to that man by whom thoffence comes.
Imprynted at London in Fletstreete, at the sign of S. John Evangelist by
Thomas Colwell.

1571.

To the Right Worshypfull* most virtuous, and my very good Uncle: Mr. Anthony
Colclough Esquire: G. Colclough his well-beloved kinsman wishes health and
prosperity* and in the law of God a perfect knowledge.
Considering (Right well-beloved) that since ye first age of our forefather Adam
and his posterity, great was the iniquitye which daylle more and more
increased in the heart of man: again vewyng what a vice is Idleness the moother
of Devotion, joined with her handmayd Ignorance: I thought it convenient to
keep my self unblameable and excused of these two, so great, so wicked and
detestable mischiefs, lest ye in any one jot I should be reproved in leaning
to these two so notorious vices. Pondring again, the great unfeigned friendship,
which I have received at your hands, I could not but show mine endeavor in
requitynge the same, although not by outward gift, yet by the inward
affection, which lies and has always remained in me, to the intent to
recompense (though as it is in deed but slackly) your good will manifestly
showed unto me. But now as touching the matter from the time of our first
Progenitoure, to the years of Noah that faithful servant of God, such was the
diffused condition of all estates, in followynge their wanton lusts and
froward devises, that God was sore displeased and his anger was vehemently
kindled against them, so that were it not that his fatherly wisdom had said I
will not always strive with man seeing he is but dust, yea and repented him
that he had made him, were it not I say for this he had been destroyed for
evermore.

Yet still did he lean to his own way neglectinge his maker, so merciful
and sauourable a God, so that justly he sent a Flood which covered the whole
face of the earth, in which inundation only Noah and his posterytie was
saved, being preserved in the Arc, Since which Flood and the fire of Sodoma
and Gomorrha, man's corrupted nature was such, that yet he seized not to
offend that now in the last age and iron world, manifold be thoffences which
are daily committed, to the grief of Gods elect. Yea since the two former
worlds, the Golden, and Brazen, which were both naught, and yet the one worse
then the other, there remains yet this iron obstinat world, in wickedness
exceeding both. And yet undoubtedly gods word (God be praised therefore) is as
much preached now as was then, but few be right followers thereof. Wherefore
because I have inuayed against it, I pray you judge not amiss of me because
here by you may perceive which be the selye sheep, and which the rauenynge
Wolves, and how to make a separation between them both. Desiring you to accept
my good will in this my small and barbarous endeavor and hereafter I shall be
encourage to attemt a greater enterprise. And thus fare ye well.

Your Well-beloved cousin, George Colclough.

TO THE READER.
GOod Reader yield thy listing ear
let heart and mind be pressed,
For things right wondrous thou shall hear
and learn to choose the best.
Of every thing which nature wrought
with in man's ^ortall brain,
A Mirror clear is hither brought,
of his conditions plain.
O^ each misdeede which in him lurkes,
and how he does them use:
And thou shall see how all his works
Gods precepts do abuse.
And if that ought be done amiss,
then let me bear the blame
But if the truth expressed is,
do thou maintain the same.
For sure as near as I could guess
the truth herein is set,
And that which I do here express,
from scriptures is it fet.
Wherefore judge as it is in deed,
no other thing I crave:
And this a greater gift shall breed,
Which thou shall surely have.
Finis.
Woe to the world because of offenses. Man. xviii.
IF Care does cause men cry
when sorrows do abound,
And if in doleful misery
small solace may be found:
If Woe does make men wayle
when they be in distress,
If joyful mirth may not prevail
nor make their woes the less,
Well may I then complain,
since each man lives in care,
Well may I show my careful pain,
and inward grefe declare.
Since all men live in woe,
and sorrow is there food,
Now let my mourninge life be so,
such be my daily mood.
For why I find and prove,
experience teaches still,
Men do not as them should behoue
Gods precepts to fulfill.
For mark and you shall see,
a buses daily wrought,
I fear me this the cause will be,
that all do come to naught.
First look upon the place,
where rich men do remain:
Then will you say in little space,
thear mischief has his reign.
And shall I truly say,
as true it is in deed,
The greatest mischiefs day by day,
from thence they do proceed.
Like Sepulchers with out,
full costly in their kind,
But inwardly even all a bout,
much filth there may you find.
For why in outward show,
like Sots they do appear,
There inward parts you may well know
great filthiness does bear,
Like Hawks so is their sight,
in couetinge of gain,
Continually with maine and might,
they strive this to abtaine.
Where good may have increase,
and riches may abound,
Whereas before they lived in peace,
now care does keep the ground.
And though yea with the best,
their Tabernacles flow,
Though their estate above the rest,
in happiness does grow,
And though in all his works,
God frames all to the best,
Yet rooted in the heart there lurkes,
an enemy of rest.
For daily is it shown,
as all men may declare,
The wealthier the man is known,
the greater is his care.
I mean in seeking good,
though all I do not blame,
Yet many do refuse their food,
in searchinge for the same.
But where that may be wrought,
which goodness may pretend,
Experience has plainly tought,
few do thereon depend.
Like Owls in mids of night,
which may not see by day,
So darkened is these bussardes sight
the truth I truly say.
O man where is thy mind,
who bids thee live in woe,
Or else why art thou thus unkind,
to serve thy maker so.
O think that he which wrought,
the clouds, the sea, the land,
And each thing to his order brought,
still mighty is his hand.
Which made the foul, the fish, the beast
according to his mind:
And each thing else reposde in rest,
agreeing to their kind.
Which to the crepinge creature,
for food did make the field,
And likewise other forniture,
the foul and fish to shield.
Which made the mouth to speak,
the hand to work his will,
If men his laws do ever break:
may not he plague them still.
Which made the eye to see,
the feet likewise to wend,
Shall not he plague and punish thee:
if ever thou offend.
And wherefore is thy mind,
but these things still to ponder,
It should be sure thy proper kind,
upon these things to wonder.
The Auther of the heart,
which lies in thy breast,
May not the same thy sins conuart,
as it does like him best.
For why thus has he said:
although thy sins do show,
As scarlet, yet they shall be made,
as white as any snow.
But out alas the time,
I think it over past:
To call us to repent our crime,
in sackecloth mourninge fast.
Behold I view and see:
Gods wrath is fully bent,
And if it may possible be,
to call us to repent.
The Drunked cares not,
how ever he has sped,
And if so be the biblinge pot,
be settled to his head.
So that it happen shall,
as I do think no less,
I think the same shall surely fall,
which Ioell did express.
Ye Drunkardes now lament, Ioell. 1.

bewail ye night and day,
For God is now even surely bent,
to take your cup a way.
The wine so sweet in taste,
which made your senses dull.
The lord a way shall surely cast,
and from your lips it pull.
And if he did it speak,
unto his own elect,
What shall we do his laws which break
in much more ill respect.
If wepinge may prevail,
we have sufficient cause,
To houle and morn, to weep and wail,
which still do break his laws.
So that I greatly fear,
if we do not repent,
God will not still his wrath forbear,
unless our hearts relent.
I fear the just shall speed,
far worse for ill men's sake,
And God will as I think in deed,
a way his blessinge take.
For where the word is tought,
in most abundant wise.
Small goodness seems to be wroght,
small fructes of many rise.
Yea even the greatest vice,
which Heathens did abuse,
As though it were of worthy price,
the Christians daily use.
Yet Christ they do profess
still boastinge of his name
Whereas the truth for to confess,
it is but ^o cloak their shame.
In coveting for good.
was never more delight,
Such hastines in sheedinge blood,
was never set in sight.
Such falsehoode all for gain,
as was not seen before,
Such carping care such toyling pain,
in heapinge worldly store.
Such care for filthy mucke,
such toylinge hear and thear,
I fear me ill will be the luck,
which all this care does bear.
And sure I doubt it sore,
it was not said in vain,
Which Christ pronounced long before,
in Luke his Gospel plain.
A certain man full rich there was, Luke 12

whose ground gave much increase,
And thus in time it came to pass,
when as he lived in peace.
His barnes being well repleat,
with treasures of his ground,
A bounding with all substance great,
as ever could be found.
Unto his soul thus does he say,
be glad and take thine ease,
For thou art blessed for many a day:
with goods of great increase.
But oh thou fool says God the Lord,
thou know not what shall fall,
The goods where with thou now art stord
shall be consumed all.
And in the self same night,
his goods of so great power,
And he him self of such a might,
were parted in an hour.
This is the end of such,
as never are content,
Of Gods good gifts which had so much,
till all was quickly spent.
Because in all their joy,
there maker they forget,
Therefore he does them clean destroy,
and catch them in his net.
And are not such in deed,
apparent at this time.
Who^se great unthankfulness does breed
a scourge just for there crime,
Yes if it were well known,
where wealth does much abound,
I fear such seed is depely sown,
al most in every ground,
But what or who they be,
or how their life they lead,
I wish with all my heart to see,
such vices turned to dread.
For in our fathers time,
though sin did somewhat grow,
Yet never was se rite the crime,
which now a days does flow.
For why in every place,
whereas you list to walk,
Which way so ever you shall pass,
a bounds such filthy talk.
Such swearing here and theare,
a busing God his name,
Which causes as I greatly fear,
his word to bear the blame.
Yet do his preachers speak,
rebukinge sharply still,
Those which his holy laws do break
regardinge not his will.
But oh man's fickle state,
oh his corrupted age,
Oh miserble runnagate,
who shall thy pains aswage.
Unless thou do repent,
and that in little space,
Unless thy stubborn heart relent,
and call to God for grace.
Leave of and that with speed,
thy brother to oppress,
And rather help him at his need:
his sorrows to redress.
Turn not a way thine ear,
when he shall sighe and groan,
But with a loving countnance hear,
and listen to his moan.
But who is fully bent,
the careful to consider,
Such one does sure a good intent,
the nedy to remember.
But out alas the grief,
which their poor heart sustain,
Full little sure is the relief,
which may appease their pain.
Right doleful is the songs,
which comes from the poor,
With empty womb yea all day long
they cry at every door,
The scripture does declare,
that man shall not be hard,
When as he cries, his brothers care,
which does no whit regard.
Full bitter is the sore,
which greues the simpl^ heart,
And when likewise was ever more,
Such puttinge poor to smart.
But oh who dare once move,
when rich men do not right,
Or who is he which dare reprove,
a man so great of might.
And when he shall appear,
before the judgment seat,
And eke the judge shall plainly hear^
his faults to be so great.
Good Lord how in his cause,
his quarrel to maintain,
Shall then be hard intionted laws,
to rid him out of pain.
And shall I say the trothe,
that his should be the right,
The judges many times forsooth,
for money make him quite.
Yea though each man might se,
his cause was nothing just,
Yet is he now both frank and fre,
to serve his wonted lust.
Yet may each man be bold,
when poor men do amiss,
Of many men they are controld
If once they do but hysse.
Yea and the sely poor,
though small be his offense,
He shall be thrust out of his door,
to seek his own defense.
And if he move his lips,
his quarrel to maintain,
He shall have many tanting nips
And prisone is his gain.
And though his goods be small,
and little be his store,
Although it may release his thrall,
He has it not therefore.
Though little be his fault,
to come before the judge,
Good Lord how great is the assault
of those which bear him grudge.
And that like tigers ferce,
they should behold his blood,
And see the sword his heart to perce,
which all ways did them good.
Yet Christ is their defense,
of whom they bear there name,
Whereas it is but a pretense,
to cloak there filthy shame.
For Christ does plainly say
those same which be of me,
They follow my precepts always,
and with my laws agree.
Therefore says God the Lord, Esdras. xvi.

I will no sins maintain,
And they shall feel my heavy sword,
which put my sheep to pain.
Woe unto those which lay. Esaias. v.

one field unto another,
And house to house join every day,
displacinge still there brother.
This same is in mine ear,
the Lord of hosts has said,
The lamentacions I do hear,
which innocents have made.
Therefore there houses fair,
they shall be desolate.
And likewise none shall them repair,
there to in habitate.
These be Eramples lo,
of things which were before,
But oh the world does them forgo,
and vice increases sore.
Such pride has never ben,
in such abundant wise,
I think the time was never seen,
that pride did so arise.
And that to good men's grieffe,
as each man may well know,
For little sure is the relief,
which there upon does grow.
Some proud be in there mind,
and some be proud in heart,
And sundry kinds you may well find,
of pride in every part,
Some proud in dainty cheer,
where in men do delight,
Presumtuous many do appear,
in boasting of there might.
And proud of their misdedes,
full many may be found,
Thus filthy foul corrupting weeds,
do grow in every ground.
Some proud of skillful brains,
where with God has them blessed,
And some be proud if that there gains,
increase above the rest.
Some proud of hauty looks:
and some to work there spite,
And some again in skillful books,
have great and proud delight.
And though that books do yield,
some fructes to willinge brains,
Yet is the Lord the steadfast shield,
whereby to bring them gains.
Some proud in their attire.
ordeind to cover shame,
Yet many have a great desire,
and glory in the same.
And though their lands be base,
perchance yea none in deed,
They think it is no comely grace,
gay vestimentes to need.
The vesture must be brave,
though other things be scante
Though in his purse small good he have,
to satisfy his want.
That when as he should walk,
before the peoples sight,
The ingnorant might say and talk,
lo there a man of might.
But God which made the heart,
an instrument of praise,
He seethe when thou do depart,
out of his holy ways.
Therefore the Lord which said, Esaias. iii.

to Sion long ago,
Thy Daughters heads bald shall be made
sith me they do forgo.
By cause there pride is much,
there necks in stretchinge out,
There minsinge in the streat is such
when as they walk about.
Therefore there costly calls,
and other ornaments,
There braceletes, and perfuming balls,
with such like instruments.
There Tabletes and there Kings,
with other of there goods,
There earinges vailes and other things
And eke there costly hoodes.
There mufflers with the rest,
there crispinges fair in sight
There launes and all things of the best,
they shall forget them quite.
And where the sauoure sweet,
did first so trimly smell,
The stink shall be exceeding great,
as Esaias does it tell.
There beauty shall be void,
and burninge be in stead:
There young men eke shall be destroid,
and none shall wail the dead.
These things expreste before,
may not they now be seen?
Are not such things still more and more
as ryfe as they have been.
No not the lest of all,
but now is to be found
And that which then was very small,
Now do they most abound.
And though one in degree,
another do exceed,
Althought she may maintained be,
in costly state in deed.
Though she wear rich attire,
if so it be her will,
And eke in all things her desire,
may be accomplished still.
Yet if another may,
this woman see so brave,
Why might not I straight will she say,
Such costly garments have.
Where women still should be, Titus. 2.

not given unto strife,
That men might say when them they see
they lead a Godly life.
And that they be discret,
not runninge to and fro,
But that there chastnes should be great,
as does become them so.
But now twixt man and wife,
as many do well know,
What great debate, what daily strife,
incessantly does grow.
Likewise the younger sort,
do run a wantan race,
Whereby they gain such misreport
as may there name disgrace.
But who does live in peace,
Rejoicing in his rest,
Or say his heart is well at ease,
such one I think is blessed,
But that he must consider,
what things he did before,
And carefully his sins remember,
and sorry be therefore.
The heart it is in deed,
a member somewhat small,
Yet has it surely greatest need,
of mendinge first of all.
For all thy former sin,
wherewith they days are spent,
First at the heart thou must begyne,
thy frailty to repent.
And if thou could once see,
the heart with in thy breast,
Full many things there placed be,
which spoyleth thee of rest.
But man does rune his course,
to have his last reward;
And worldly things do make him worse
to take so small regard.
I mean by worldly things,
the sins which therein flow:
Which man to such corruption bringes,
whereby contempt may grow.
For look and you shall see,
such mischieues daily breed:
So that the world might called be,
the vale of woes in deed.
Such hatred does arise
betwixt each other still:
The rich man does the poor despise
according to his will.
And if that one exceed
his neighbor in degree,
Contemned is the man of need,
as commonly we see.
But Joseph did not still, Genesis. xxxvii.

within the pit remain:
Nor God did not so frame his will
to keep him still in pain.
And though he bare the smart,
even at his brothers hands,
Though he through their despiteful heart*
was sold to foreign lands:
Though Israel wrought him woe,
and much dispite in deed:
In Egypt was he loved tho,
and helped at his need.
And when the dearth was great
and vitayles very scant,
He gave his brethren food to eat,
and satesfied their want.
Thus God does still provide
to set his own at ease,
Although the world cannot abide,
to see their wealth increase.
For many are the pains Psalm. 34.

which just men do endure,
But God does loose their yrou chains,
and wondrous joys procure.
For he which was so kind* Acts. xii.

to Peter in his hands:
So that the chayns which did him bind.
were shaken from his hands.
And he which made a way, Daniell. vi.

for Daniell in the den:
Does guide as it is seen all way,
the just from wicked men.
But very seldom sure,
the Godly live at ease,
Whereas the wicked still procure,
the cause of their disease.
For surely such misdedes,
did never so a bound,
Such myschiefe as now daily bredes,
I think was never found.
Such hatred hear and there:
so many worldly wife,
Such witty brains as never were,
to nourish wicked vice.
Such Envy all about,
such Glottony in feasts,
And finally the world through out,
mankind more like to beasts.
Such Bacchus belly cheer,
increased never more,
Such vices as does now appear,
the Heathens hated sore.
Yet Christians is our name,
although not so in deed,
For known we be even by the same,
which does with in us breed.
Like as the tree is known,
by fructes yea every wheare,
And as the fruct right well is shown,
by trees which does it bear.
So may the man be spide,
what is his daily life:
And by the thing he may be tried,
which in him is most ryfe.
As by the stately man,
his pride is set in sight:
And as the Dronkard by his can,
wherein he does delight.
As Glottons by their cheer,
when as it does exceed,
And as the poor man does appear,
by pouertye in deed.
As rich men by their wealth,
which daily does increase,
As sound men likewise by there health,
as sick men by disease.
As each thing to be brief,
which Nature first did find:
Which brings either joy or grief,
according to there kind.
Thus by the out ward show
in things which most are used,
The inward heart you may well know
Where in it is abused.
And if that each misdeede,
my pen should jointly touch
Although it were no more then need,
yet might I think it much.
And that above the rest,
which makes man so blind:
Of all the mischiues in his breast,
which Nature wrought by kind.
One thing there does remain,
a Vice exceeding great:
Whereof I think will be no pain
in breuity to treat.
Such whordome so maintaind,
the like was never seen,
Such lusts which may not be refrai^d,
I think has never been.
Yea and so closely wrought
that it may not be spide,
Yet will it surely come to naught:
for long it may not bide.
And if it chances so
that rich men do the deed,
They shall be suffered free to go:
since money helps need.
Yea? and which is a pain,
who may once move his lip.
Although he might, yea very plain
him take in such a trip.
But those whom harlots train Pro. 2.

unto their wicked ways:
They never do return again,
and shortened be their days.
Yea what vice may you tell
which whordome does exceed,
For surely Theft it does excel: Pro. ^

and worse it is in deed.
For Theft may Pardon have,
since it is done for need:
But Whordome leads souls to grave
whence they shall not proceed.
For thither they descend
from whence they may not rise,
Whose pains shhall never have a^l end
for such their enterprise.
Though Ammon did defile, Sam. 11. 13.

his sister Thamras bed:
Yet was it but a little while
until his blood was shed.
Since that he was so bold,
to do so great offense
Therefore did Absalon behold,
his sin with recompense.
For Absalon which had
this vice in him abhorde,
His servants by commandment bad
to smite him with the sword.
Thus though with his own kin,
this vice he did commit:
Yet recompensed was his sin
by sword, which ponisht it.
What then is his reward
which others does defile?
Will God think you with small regard
at his offenses smile?
Who so does think the same
he is deceived sure,
For God rewards with open shame
those which his wrath procure.
Though David was upright Sam. 2. *11. cha.

in doing Gods good will,
Though God in him had great delight,
and well did love him still:
Yet when his heart was set
vypon Vriahs wife,
Whose love did cause him to forget,
his former godly life.
So that she then did reign,
with David in his seat:
Vriah guiltless being slain,
when as the war was great.
This thing displeased sore,
the mighty lord above
And David blamed was therefore,
for this his wicked love.
And Nathan then was sent,
his faults to show him plain:
But earnestly he did repent,
and turned to God again.
Thus just men go astray,
when God is not their guide:
Yet never be they cast away,
although they walk aside.
But how do many sin,
in doing such offense,
When they be catched in the grin
then seek they some pretense.
Whereby to escape the smart
for such a mischief due:
Although they say within their heart,
this thing is surely true.
How many to be brief?
do stand in David's case:
But few do show their inward grief,
and call to God for grace.
Yea, and how many know,
such deeds deserves shame:
And that likewise thereby may grow
Gods vengeance for the same.
Yet do it not for go,
but use it more and more:
Until they feel the endless woe
which shall them-greeue therefore.
And not without a cause,
since it they do procure:
Because they break Gods holy laws
this certain is and sure.
Wherefore this was the mind,
of Heathens long before,
That what Adulterar they might find
should die the death therefore.
But we do thine it meet,
for such an huge offense:
Thoffendours to stand in a sheet,
in open audience.
While thus they think in heart,
(though all I do not blame:)
This is nothing of any smart
to turn me from the same.
And then they do afreshe,
their former vice begin:
Thus do they serve their wicked flesh,
in working deadly sin.
And where perhaps before
not much they did offend,
Now be they sure encouraged more,
to Whordome to intend.
Yet do thou still refrain Pro. 7.

as does the wise man say,
For many strong men have bin slain,
By turning to her way.
For sure it is a vice,
as no good ears may hear
For daily thereof does arise,
small fructes, as does appears.
Likewise Ambicion:
does bear such open sway
Whose filthy disposicion
is honors to assay.
In whom where it does bide,
it brings forth disdain:
For such one seeks on every side
to bring his friend to pain.
So that he may aspire
to honor by the same,
And satesfied be his desire,
in matters touching Fame,
Not being well content,
to live in his degree:
Although he have sufficient
as commonly we see.
But Absalon which thought Sam. 2. 15. chap.

to honors to attain,
And by his subtle mischief sought,
the kingdom to obtain.
Yea, and such crafty skill
did daily put in ure,
Whereby he thought to work his will,
to slay his father sure.
Ill council did not lack
in such a wicked thing:
To secke his father David's wrack,
and he to be the king.
But God, which saw his heart
his purpose did prevent,
So that he felt the greater smart,
for this his ill intent.
So that it did beside,
Gods plague he did provoke
And as in bataile he did ride,
was hanged on an Oak.
Even by the very hear
wherein he did delight:
For why? it was exceedinge fair,
well facioned in sight.
Thus God does turn the though^es,
of wicked worldlinges still:
And brynges their counsels clean to noughtes
according to his will.
Yet was there doble crime
in Absalon to see.
The one because he sought to clime,
to higher dignity.
The other that he wrought
his father wondrous grief,
Since disobediently he sought,
To work him such mischief.
So that I judge it so,
Death did him justly smite:
Who sought to breed his fathers woe,
with such extreme dispite.
How many now be found,
like Absalon in deed:
How many do deserve the wound
which his offense did breed.
But if the heart were spide,
as is the outward eye,
I think Ambicion should be tried,
if it there in did lie.
But God which made the heart
and eke the eye did frame,
May well revenge with cruel smart
the sekers of the same.
Yet may we well declare,
as touching outward sight
That many men Ambicious are,
and in that vice delight.
For why? when they shall see
a man of great estate,
That moved is both cap and knee:
to such a Potentate.
Their hearts do much delight
still thursting after fame,
And never are they well in plight,
till like they be of name.
And thus they do despise,
their neighbors low degree:
Right joyful when they shall arise
to higher dignity.
But when they have a place,
within the Princes gate:
They make a fair pretenced face
to help their friends estate.
So that them selves before
be placed in their seat,
Then be they licensed the more
for poor men to entreat.
Thus all men make a shift
to glory to attain,
Till they have made an handsome dri^t
whereby to get them gain.
But how do pooremen fare
when such men live at ease,
Their food shall seem to be but bar^
their sorrows to appease.
And when such Glottons now,
even thoroughly are sped:
I pray you show the manner how,
poor Lazarus is fed.
To speak the truth in deed
his cheer it is but small.
And in respect of his great need,
is surely none at all.
And well we may behold
his clothes be little sure,
Which may preserve him from the cold
which his poor limbs endure.
O shepeheardes to unkind
your sheep thus to forgo:
To drive them thus to wave and wind
did Christ instruct you so?
Ney so you should them love, John. 10.

as for them yield your life:
For faithful shepheardes does behoue,
to keep their sheep from strife.
And always them to feed,
with food yea of the best
And cherish them in time of need,
and still provide them rest.
And still to have an eye
to keep them with your sheeld,
And when the Wolf ye shall epsy,
to drive him from the feeld.
But who does feed the lean
but still the sat does spoil:
Yea, and does push the other clean,
out of their pleasant soil.
Therefore the Lord our God Es^c^. 34.

even he himself does say,
My sheep no more shall run abroad,
nor ever go a stray.
And they which did them train,
unto contrary costs,
I come to visit them with payn^,
thus says the Lord of hosts.
And they shall not be fed,
like as they were before,
Which of my Sheep the blood have shed
and still did grieve them sore.
But as for my poor flock,
their pasture shall be good,
And likewise David's royal stock,
with care shall give them food.
Thus God does hear the cry,
of poor men in distress,
And does aswage their misery,
and make their pains the less.
But while this lump of clay,
does rule yea all a bout,
And bears such out ragious sway,
the open world throughout.
How can the^r steadfast peace,
In any place endure,
When as such mischief does increase,
thus daily put in ure.
Such vsurye in good,
as was not seen before,
Such suckinge still of poor men's blood,
I think was never more.
For if a poor man shall,
require the rich man's aid,
To lend him money where with all,
to see his debtes be paid
The rich man will not stay,
to seek his doble gain,
For where a penny he did pay.
he will require twain.
Regardinge not the pain,
which nedy men shall take,
Although with care they would be feign,
good payment for to make.
Yea such one oftentime,
so deals with his brother,
Although he daily such a crime,
commiteth with another:
Yet can not God for bear,
such mischief to be sought,
And that unto thy brother dear,
such trespass to be wrought.
This thing thou shall not do, Deuteronomy. 23

in money or in meat,
The love of God ordaind it so,
for Moses to repeat.
But now as all men see,
each one deceaueth other
And lyeng weightes maintained be,
for to beguile their brother.
Whereas Gods Law has said, Deuteronomy. 25

and Moses shows plain.
Let no false balances be made,
whereby to gather gain.
Thou shall not in thy door,
have weightes both great and small,
Whereby thou may beguile the poor,
to further thee with all.
But let thy weightes be right,
and measures justly made,
So God in thee will have delight,
as he him self has said.
But as full true it is,
I need not for to feign,
What man is he regards this,
which does such crafts maintain.
For if it were his use,
in scriptures for to read
False balances he would refuse,
and leave them clean in deed.
There might he view and see,
such craft deserves shame,
And God his hatred known should be,
and vengeance for the same.
But as I said before,
who does consider this,
Else surely would he morn full sore,
for that he does amiss.
Unless his eyes were blind,
as I do think it so,
For else it should be sure his kind,
to wail his hidden woe.
But oh this clayish clod,
by nature apt to fall,
It does not see there is a God,
whose wisdom rules all.
Therefore our flesh so frail,
from sin does never cease,
And nothing sure it does prevail,
to say on earth is peace.
For thus the Prophet spoke, Lere. viii.

and did with grief complain:
Both Priest and Prophet God forsake,
and follow after gain.
Yet still they cry of peace,
where is no peace in deed:
But rather mischief does increase
and war-doth daily breed.
So surely is it now,
As it appeared then,
There is no peace I may auowe
on earth with worldly men.
Although not in the feeld,
God have the praise therefore:
(For he it is that does us sheeld,
and keeps ever more.)
Yet in each private place
some discord does arise,
Contencious strife does breed a pace
as is the worldly guyse.
And what was else the cause
that Rome did so decay,
But for the breach of civil laws
and discord every day.
For when contentious strife,
was not with foreign lands:
Internal mischief brought their life
as it were into bands.
And as it came to pass,
it had no further stay:
For this the most occasion was
that it fell to decay.
Consider now by this
the sins that daily flow,
And likewise, as full true it is
the strife which still does grow.
Mark well each thing therefore,
reposed in his kind:
Then vewe how vice does go before
poor Virtue stands behind.
Then may it well be said,
of things which London spoil:
Such deadly sins were never bred
within the Romayne soil.
And though perhaps as much
in Rome did once abound,
Perchance again was never such
upon the Roman ground.
Yet be we warned still
such vices to avoid
And well we know it is Gods will,
to have such things destroyde.
And knowing well the way
which leads unto shame,
Yet seek we ever day by day
to walk upon the same.
Where as the Romans then,
were not instructed so:
Nor had likewise such godly men
to teach them where to go.
Then less is their offense,
which could not walk aright:
Nor having guides for their defense
to bring them to the light.
Less surely is their sin,
then those which do offend
Yet do they daily walk therein,
unto their lives end.
Great are the stripes therefore
which that man shall sustain,
Who as gods will he knows the more,
the less do it maintain.
And sure the world is so,
such things therein be set,
Which bringes to man an endless woe:
since God they do forget.
Wherefore this caused Paul, Romans 6.

that faithful man to wayle
When as his sprite could naught at all
within his flesh prevail.
So that with tears he said
who shall this death hence take,
Or from this sin within me laid
shall full deliverance make.
Thanks therefore do I yield,
through Christ to God alone:
For he it is that does me sheeld
when I shall make my moan.
Now therefore in my mind,
Gods law I do fulfill:
But in my flesh as I well find,
I serve my wicked will.
How many now do sin
far worse then Paul in deed,
Yet do they still delight there in
and cause it more to breed.
How many serve their lust,
as swine delight in in^^e:
So do they wallowe in the ^ust
which they do most desire.
But in the Law of God,
their study is but small
For why? they think it is a Rod
to plague their sins with all.
And so it is in deed
to those which do offen^,
But to the godly it does breed:
such joys as have no end.
Wherefore in Moses law Deuteronomy. 11.

God straightly did command,
Let Parents keep their youth in awe,
my Laws to understand.
So that when they shall know,
what is my will thereby,
The^ they with care the same may show,
to their posterity.
And likewise they again
may teach it to their seed,
That it right steadfast may remain
for evermore in deed.
But who does this fulfill?
not all I may well say,
But for to do mischeuous ill:
are bent yea every day.
And though they do not know
nor thereon frame their taulke,
Yet will they not their children show
which way aright to waulke.
But as the proverb says
if both be blind a like,
They walk not on the common path,
but fall into the dike.
Less greater be the stay
which God shall show in deed.
Unless he ^^ direct the way,
to help man at his need.
Yet all I do not blame:
which so their children lead,
Percha^ce sum know not how to fram^
the path where they should tread.
And some perhaps again
they have not wherewith all
For to release their childrens pain
when they shall be in th^all*
And what is else the grief,
Which many do endure:
Then when they leese the same relief
which labors did procure.
I mean when Gods good gifts
within them does remain,
They shall be driven to their shifts
their living to maintain.
And true it is in deed,
who can the same deny:
They are molested with great need,
and live in misery.
Though other serve their lust,
and do their wanton will
And in there treasure put their trust
which shall not tarry still.
Thus Christ's aflicted flock
does run from cost to cost,
And constantly resist the Rock
or else then life were lost.
And thus in greuing poor^
what do we else at all:
But thrust our Savior out of door,
increasing still his thrall.
For if we shall it do
unto his own elect,
As he has said it greueth him to
and that in each respect.
And surely wisdoms grace
which once did so exceed,
I think was never made so base
as it is now in deed.
Such learning set at naught
the time was never so,
Such things unto confusion brought
which teach to flee from w^.
And ga^ing so for gain
as was not seen before,
Although we think it breedth no pain
we are deceived sore.
For though we do not see,
that now it does appear
I think the pain will shortly be:
for now it draws near.
So that if you well know
the time that you shall see,
When in the world good ^ruct will grow
I think will never be.
Unless such sins decay,
which now are daily wrought,
And such misdeedes done every day
do surely come to naught.
When Avarice shall cease
and be no more in deed,
And Dronkennes shall have decrease
which now does daily breed.
When Pride shall have an end
and from the world depart,
And Usury which does offend,
the godly faithful heart.
When as external strife,
shall be no more in feeld:
Then will I say a godly life,
the faithful sort does sheeld.
When whordome has no place,
to frame her ill intent
And wicked worldly men a pace
to Gods laws shall be bent.
And when deceit shall fade
and dealing shall be true:
And subtle weyghtes no more be made,
the simple to subdue.
When Bribery shall fall,
which Judges does defile
And subtletie be brought in thrall,
which poor men does beguile.
And when Extorcion great
shall cease for to be done,
And each sin which I may repeat
no more shall be begone.
When Virtue shall increase
and Justice be maintaind,
When Wisdom shall abound in peace
and be no more disdaind.
When poor men shall be eased
of pains which green them sore:
And godly men which be diseased,
shall be oppressed no more.
When each thing to be brief
which goodness does pretend,
Shall cease from pains and have relief
unto the worlds end.
Then shall the world in deed,
be changed from his kind:
And each sin which in it does breed,
be clean worn out of mind.
And then shall bale to bliss,
returned be again,
And each thing which is done amiss,
it shall not so remain.
Then shall be joy to them,
which lived in woeful chance,
And likewise new Jerusalem,
be their enheritance.
And they shall live in rest,
their joy shall then a bound,
And every thing shall sure be blessed,
which grows on their ground.
But how shall this betide,
and to an end be brought,
When such misdedes on earth abide,
and are thus daily wrought.
Since such is the complainte,
almost in every streat,
Of those whose hearts ar wondrous faint
with pains exceeding great.
So that I fear it sore,
it shall not so be fall,
Like as I did express be fore,
of joys perpetual.
But as in Noehs time,
the world was much infect,
And each man did commit his crime,
in every ill respect.
Just thought they was their life,
and all things did enerease,
And daily foynd was man to wife,
and pleasures did not cease.
Great were the vices then,
which daily did proceed,
So that corruption grew in men,
as in the ground the weed.
So that in each thing sure,
which I expressed before;
Gods heavy wrath they did procure,
and vengeance far therefore.
They served their filthy lust,
in doing things a (...)
But few in God did plit their trust,
for so the truth it i^:
God therefore saw tire i^ heart,
that ill was their in tent;
By cause from him they did depart,
and to their lost were bent.
Therefore he sent a blood,
which covered every part,
Both house and feld and every wood,
for their malicious heart.
Thus God did them confound,
contrary to their mind,
and all the world through out was droun^
as we in* scriptures find.
And as David declares,
when as their food they eat,
Gods plague came on them unawares,
as they were eatinge meat.
Lo this is the reward,
of those which do offend,
Which still do take so small regard,
not lookinge to the end.
For if we would remember,
the sins which we have done,
And with great diligence consider,
the things which are to come.
It should be sure our kind,
incessantly to pray,
And all ways have our sins in mind,
and drive ill thoughts a way.
But who does this fore see,
but few I think in deed,
Yea every one will careful be,
to shift in time of need.
But how is all their shift,
assuredly for gain,
And where they thought to find some thrift
alas it is in vain.
For each man has his will,
to do his own intent,
But few Gods precepts to fulfill,
with heart and mind ar bent.
So that I think it sure,
the flood shall come no more,
But fiery flames which shall endure,
alas for evermore.
And as in Sod^ma,
a wondrous spark was sent,
Which kindled fire in Gomorrha,
and all their cities brent.
Because they would not hear,
to Gods most holly word,
They were constraind as did appear,
to feel his fiery sword.
Thus while they surely thought,
their heart was set at ease,
Into their land a plague was brought,
their stoutnes to appease.
So when Balthazar king,
did make a sumptuous feast, Dan. 5.

And thought his heart in every thing,
was set in quiet rest.
The vessels of the Lord,
they served to his use,
Yet did he the most precious word,
of God the Lord abuse.
And in his royal cheer,
he pray so his Gods of Gold,
As it in scriptures does appear,
right plainly to behold.
But God could not sustain,
his blasphemous despite,
For on the wall was showed plain,
A hand which these did write.
Thye kingdom God has tried,
and took it from thy hands,
For why thy power he will divide,
among the Persian lands.
And in the self same night,
with in a little space,
King Balthazar was s^ain in fight,
Darius taking place.
Thus God does still ordain,
great Kings his flock to feed,
But when they will not them sustain
he plagueth Kings in deed.
So Asshure which did boast,
him self above the stars, Cro. 2. Chap. 32

God did subvert his wicked host,
discomfitinge his wars.
And many thousands then,
were slain with in the feeld,
Yea noble and right skillfull men,
well tried in the sheeld.
So that as he did pray,
unto his blockish Lord,
Even his own children did him slay,
and smote him with the sword.
For thus it came to pass,
and God appointed so,
By those his life bereued was,
which should have heald his woe.
So that where I did speak,
of Sodom burnt with fire,
By cause Gods precptes they did break
they felt his flaming ire.
Now do I think it sure,
the same shall us befall,
Which Sodomites did then endure,
by fire which brent them all.
For such iniquity,
which then did much abound,
I think as great impiety,
in us may now be found.
Wherefore the souls upright, Reave. 6.

whom wicked men had slain,
By cause in God was their delight,
unto him did complain.
Now long o lord most high,
will thou thy wrath for bear,
Of those which make us thus to cry,
and put us so in fear.
To whom was said again,
a bide a little space,
Until that those which shall be slain,
do come to you in place.
And now the truth is so,
some be already past,
And by the Pope that furious foe,
to death are daily cast.
And sure I think the end,
will now be sone at hand,
By cause of those which do offend,
through out both sea and land.
All Visions now be past,
and Prophecies be done,
And nothing surely long shall last,
which is or was begone.
For unto all men's sight,
the Scripture shows plain,
The father with the son shall fight
the son with him again.
And so it is in deed,
with other sins beside,
That Drunkenness shall daily bread,
and eke presumtuous Pride.
And every other thing,
which makes man to offend,
When in his fulness it shall spring
then shall be seen a^ end.
Then shall the world decrease,
and each thing be prepared,
And be that spent his time in peace
shall have a just reward.
If Godly was his life,
his recompense is such,
And if he spent his days in strife,
his anguish shall be much.
And now thoffences all,
which I before expressed,
They rather rise, then seem to fall,
out of our mortal breast,
Wherefore most mighty Lord,
dyrect us in thy way,
And cause us all with one accord,
incessantly to pray.
For thou have promised,
he shall be blessed in deed,
Whom thou shall find well occupide,
thy sely sheep to feed.
And now consider well,
thy Saints and thine elect,
And those which on the earth do dwell,
good Lord do thou protect.
Bow down thy listing ear,
unto thy Marters cry:
And with a loving countenance hear
and swage their misery.
And since our flesh is frail:
Lord help us with thy might,
That sin no more with us prevail
but still be put to flight.
That we may live in peace
if so it be thy will,
And that likewise we never ceace,
thy precepts to fulfill.
That Christ being our head
our captain and our guide,
Under his power we may be lead:
and from him never slide.
And as the branches grow
and cleave unto the tree,
Good Lord do grant that even so
in Christ we rooted be.
And since we promise have:
that prayer should us lead,
To every thing which we shall crave
of Christ our only head.
Therefore we come to thee
with prayer mourning sore,
Requiring of thy Majesty,
that sin grieve us no more,
And now O England now,
repent thy former crime
And make a steadfast faithful vow
to mend thy sins in time.
And now my pen shall frame,
even hear to make her stay
Wishing that all withouten blame:
may run a Godly way.
And for our Queen her grace
let pray all faithful men,
That she may reign Methushelas space,
let England say Amen.
