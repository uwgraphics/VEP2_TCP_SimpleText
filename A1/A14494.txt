TO THE RIGHT NOBLE AND WORTHY KNIGHT SIR GEORGE HASTINGS, brother to the right
Honorable the Earl of Huntingdon.
SIR,
BOoks have ever sought out the fittest Patrons. Thinking seriously with my
self, who might most justly challenge the dedication of this labor at my
hands, which I trust shall ever bring some light and comfort to our Grammar
Schools, I could find none to have thereunto a better title then your self.
Since God has indeed made you a worthy light, for the sound love and true
advancement of virtue and good learning, and that even from your tender years.
In as much as you (contrary to the course of the greatest part of the flower of
the Nobility and Gentry of our age) have addicted your self unto your
studies, for the good (I trust) both of the Church and Commonwealth, in stead
of following the excessive pleasures of the time; and have moreover in a
singular manner manifested your affection toward them both, and toward all
good learning to that end. Whenas out of that maintenance, which in regard of
your high birth and noble line might seem far too little for your self; you
have yet separated and consecrated, as your first fruits, a portion thereof
unto the Lord, toward the maintaining of sundry poor scholars in the
University, by whom his glory may be advanced, and the good of his people
perpetually procured. Concerning which, let me crave pardon of you (good Sir)
and bear the blame, that (though contrary to your mind) I yet still desire,
as I ought, that memorable love of yours to be known, for the good ensample
and provoking of many others to the like: wherein one day they should find a
thousand times more comfort, doing it with upright hearts, then in all that
they shall bestow, not only in the ouerhote pursuit of their vain pleasures
and delights, but even in sundry other kinds, which make the fairest show. As
my self am ever bound in all places to acknowledge those great respects, which
I justly owe unto your self and that right noble house for my self and mine,
so I hope our God will enable us to seek evermore to be answerable thereunto,
as his Majesty shall vouchsafe us fit opportunities. What is wanting in us, his
goodness (I trust) will fully recompense, that you may be ever honored,
walking with him in this world, and living with him in blessedness for ever in
the heavens. And in this earnest desire, with my hearty prayers incessantly
for you, that God may make you to increase daily in all true honor, I commend
you to his heavenly grace, resting

Yours ever most bounden, JOHN BRINSLEY.

A plain Direction to the painful Schoolemaister and others, for the most
profitable use of this and the like Grammatical translations.
TO the end that all Scholars may find the several benefits of these
translations mentioned in my Grammar-schoole, not only for sound
understanding, true construing, parsing, getting without book, making and
proving the same Latin, speedy turning either into prose or verse, but also for
growth in our English tongue together with the Latin; and principally for
causing Scholars to study of themselves, and to prepare their lectures at
home, to bring them more perfectly, and keep them more surely; and all this
with very much certainty, pleasure and ease both to master and scholar, I
find this course most ready.

1. Cause every one to be well acquainted with their Grammar rules, and
especially to be perfect in the rule of construing, that they may ever follow
that direction.

2. Because the greatest part in every Form are commonly of the duller sort of
wits and more negligent, and also hardlier drawn to take pains at home,
unless they evidently see the way how they may do it with some delight; cause
some pregnant scholar of their own Form, or of some higher, to read them
their lecture ouernight, only construing it over once or twice, and showing
them the hard words and phrases briefly.

3. Direct them either to try first how they are able to construe of
themselves, and find out a reason of every thing, why it must be so construed;
and after to compare and try that which they have done, by the translation. On
else if they have not sufficient leisure, and that they would do it speedily,
or be not so well able to do it of themselves, direct them to read over the
translation once or twice; first, that they may fully understand the matter
whereby all the construing will be made most easy, and then advise them to
examine carefully by themselves the reason of the whole construction. And so
for parsing every thing in the same order as they construe: for these two so
depend one upon another, that they cannot be separated. In a word, cause them
so to study their lectures out of the Latin books and the translation
together, that they may be able with their book under their arm, to deliver
and pronounce the whole lecture either Latin or English alone, so also to
construe and parse without book to deliver their lectures either in the plain
Grammar order, or more elegantly, and so to give variety of phrase, and
whatsoever is observed in the translation.

4. Be careful that they take not overmuch at a time, and then so many of them
as are apt and painful, will the next day at any time, within an hours space
given them to meditate, be able to deliver their lecture (so as I said) viz.
pronouncing it without book both in Latin and English* construe and parse
without book, give variety of English phrase, and whatsoever can be required
for the understanding and knowledge of every word. Hereby also they will be
able to keep all that they have learned, not only to repeat each weeks
work most perfectly upon the friday, but also their whole quarters work at
each quarters end, if they use to repeat it now and then, and so to keep
their authors for every use, far more perfectly then by any other means.

For these Eclogues and the book de Apibus, I have made choice of them to
translate thus, as being the most familiar of all Virgils works, and fittest
for childrens capacities: and in some of them I have made a plain Analysis or
resolution, for the more easy and full understanding thereof, as namely of the
first and last Eclogues, and so of that excellent book of the government and
ordering of Bees, which is able to draw the very wisest into an admiration, for
their policy, and the rare works of God apparent in them. The resolution of
the rest I have omitted, as being for the most part but heardmens talk, or the
matter not so fit, and so the translation of the latter part of the sixi
Eclogue. In the first Eclogue I have given a little taste of the Rhetoric in
Tropes and figures: for the rest I refer to M. Butlers Rhetoric, M.
Far^abies tropes and figures, and to R^mus Commentary. The Eclogues being
select Poemes, I would have pronounced most exactly, as namely the 1. 3. 5. 7.
etc. (like as Tullies Paradoxes, and some choice Orations for patterns of
Theames and Orations) for that they may be most not able helps to an excellent
pro^ciation, which is a principal ornament to all learning, and will bring the
scholars much estimation with others, and delight in themselves.

I have only proceeded thus far in translating, being fully assured upon
certain experience, that children first entered well in Grammar, and having
gone through but those parts of the authors which I have thus translated, will
be able by Gods blessing (if they proceed in a right order) to take their
lectures of themselves, at least with very little assistance, in all the rest of
Virgil and the higher Latin authors; by the means of the worthy Commentaries
and other helps, which the Lord has in this last age provided above all
former times.

As for that fear of making truants by these translations, which conceit arose
merely upon the abuse of other translations, never intended for this end; I
hope that happy experience in this kind, will in time drive it, and all like
to it, utterly out of schools and out of the minds of all. Since for my self,
by the means hereof I find the clean contrary, in causing my scholars to
give a reason of every thing why it must be so, and also almost double profit
to that which I could otherwise. And finally for that I can hereby teach many^
then I could without, and cause every one of them which are any thing diligent
and apt, to render an account of that which he learnes from quarter to quarter
continually; and all with much ease and pleasure to my self, delight and
contention among themselves, and great contentation to their friends. Try
aright, and then give your sentence. The comforts which my self have found
herein, without any of the furnised inconveniences, and the same approved and
confirmed by many learned, do make me confident to desire to commend them to
all. For all other objections I have answered the^ at (...) in my Grammar
school. Experience, I trust, will fully satisfy all sorts in time. Though the
slips in this as in the rest, be very many, the difficulty of the labor to
observe duly all the directions, both for Gra^mar, propriety, purity and
otherwise, (as whos^euer makes trial will soon perceive) and also my
continual employment may plead for me, desiring, if the Lord vouchsafe that
favor, to refine them all; like as I hope that he who has thus far proceeded,
will for his own glory and the good of his people, perfect the whole work in
his due time. Whereunto craving thy love and prayers, I (...) thee (...) his
grace, and rest thi^, in what his goodness shall v^chsafe unto me*

Tit. Tit.] Tityrus answers him, rejoicing that the Emperor Augustus, whom
he called God, had granted him all that happy peace.

Melib. Reed or straw, viz. on my country oaten pipe.
Melib. Replying, tells him that he did not envy him, but rather admireth
his felicity, considering what troubles were at Cremona and Mantua and in all
the country about, by the Roman soldiers, to whom their lands were given:
whereby the poor inhabitants were driven out. And he himself become very
feeble, yet was feign to drive his goats far off whither he could, to find
pasture for them, having nothing else left him; and had one of them so weak as
he could hardly drag her after him.

I admire it rather. It is troubled so very greatly, viz. there are so very

Afterward he complayneth of their foolishness, that they could not be warned
to pre^ent these mischiefs by so many prodigious signs: As having seen the

unto them by the displeasure of the Emperor, as by the thunderbolt of Jupiter
himself.

sundry interpreters, as none of Virgils, for that it seems contrary to the
diuinations of those times, wherein they took this sign to be luckie: unless
it be attributed to the sheepheards rudeness.


Yet seeing there was now no remedy, ^e desires to know who this god was.
But Nevertheless.
notwithstanding Tityrus Give us [viz. show us.]
tell us who this god is.


Tit. Tit. Tityrus in stead of answering directly, begins shepherd* like
to extol the city where that god dwelt: describing it both by the name, and
also the greatness and state of it, which he amplifieth by his own
foolishness: That he was wont to imagine it to be like their city Mantua,
whither they used to drive their lambs to sell, but only that he thought it
somewhat bigger.
Oh Melibeus I foolish shepherd
I fool Imagined that, that city which men call Rome, was like this our city

others in state and greatness,

him so desirous to see Rome.
( Ecquae pro quaenam, more antiquo.
) And what so great A cause of seeing Rome has been to thee.
a cause had thou of seeing Rome?


Tit. Tit.] Whereunto Tityrus answers, that desire of freedom was the cause,
and also hope of recovering his lands, which he there obtained though long
before.
Even liberty [viz. a desire of liberty.

had left Mantua altogether.

Melib. Melibeus again applauding his happiness, tells him that he wondered
why his love Amaryl, so called upon the gods in such pensive manner for him.

Tit. Tityrus answering, shows him the cause of his going to Rome, and of his
tarrying there so long.

THE FOVRTH ECLOGVE [named] Pollio.
THE ARGUMENT.
A son is borne to Asinius Pollio Captain of the German army, the same
year in which he conquered Salone a city of Dalmatia, whom he called
Saloninus, from the name of the city taken.
ASinius Pollio Leader of the German army had a son borne the same year
in which he won Salone a city of Dalmatia; which son he called Saloninus by
the name of the city which he had taken.

Those things which Sibyl prophesied concerning Christ, Virgil turns and
applies to Saloninus Pollios son now borne; and to the felicity of Augustus
government.
The Poet sings a Genethliacum to him [viz. makes a Poem of his nativity
and future hopes,] in this Eclogue, wresting thither those things which Sibyl
had sung of the future felicity of the golden age.
Unto this [ Saloninus] the Poet in this Eclogue sings a Genethliacum,
detorting to that purpose those things which Sibyl had prophesied of the future
felicity of the golden age: yet Incidently or upon occasion.
by the way, he Intermingleth or puts between here and there.
mixeth the praises of Pollio [ Father of Salonicus.

argument somewhat more stately or lofty then our Pasiorals, and so written in
a style somewhat more lofty, as two other Eclogues are.

feign, was the last of these, which went to heaven, being placed among the hea

Men. Thus far (...) the Epitaph of Daphnis: now follows the commendation
thereof by Menalcas: and then his deifying or canonization, viz his referring
of him into the number of the Gods, which Menalcas undertakes.

THE NINTH ECLOGVE [ Whereunto the name [is] Meris.

THE ARGUMENT.
WHen after the victory at Philippi a city in Thessalie, where Caesar and
Pompey fought, and also Augustus with ^rutus and Cassius, as says Seruius.
Philippi, in the distribution of the lands, which were divided by the
commandment of the Trium viri were magistrates in Rome, which being three
together, had equal authority.

Arrius, to whom by chance Virgils grounds had fallen for his portion, taking
that grievously, It was away [but] a little, [viz. he had been in danger to be
slain.]
it wanted but a little, but that he had been slain by the angry soldier.
Therefore being to go again to Rome, he commanded [his] Him to whom he had
committed the charge of all his business.

very least his detriment he could, [viz. with as little hurt to Virgil.
with as little damage as he could. He therefore, viz Meris, Virgils bayliffe
or o^erseer of his goods.
He therefore goes to Mantua, by the Commandment.
appointment Of his patron.
* of his master to offer Some little gift.
some little present of kids to Arrius. Lycidas a shepherd follows Meris,
inquiring the cause of his journey. There Meris Having gotten occasion, laments
for the calamity [or misery of those times.]
taking occasion, bewaileth the calamity of those times. And then going to
Mantua, they ease the weariness of their journey by diverse songs.

The speakers are Lycidas and Meris. Lyc. Oh Meris, whither [do] thy feet
[carry] thee? whether whither the way leads, into the city, [viz. to Mantua]
Meris, whither go thou? [Goest thou] whither [this] way Directs.
leads, into the city?


Mer. O Lycidas, we have come alive, that the stranger being the possessor of
our little field (which we never feared) should say, These [goods] are mine: ye
old inhabitants flit ye.
O Lycidas, we have lived unto this unhappy day, That strangers possessing our
lands, should drive us out, [viz. the Roman soldiers.
that the stranger (which we never feared) being made the possessor of Our
farms or fields.
our little land, should say: These things are mine, ye Ancient husbandmen [or
farmers]
old inhabitants Get ye out.
pack ye hence.

Now we being overcome [and] sad (because chance turns all things vpside
down) do send these kids unto him, (which present) let not [God] turn well,
[viz. God grant he may have no good of.]
Now quite overcome, full sad (since fortune turns all things vpside down)

which yet we pray that he may have no great good of.


Lyc. In truth [or certainly] I had heard reported.
I in very deed had heard Your Menalcas [viz. Virgil] to have kept all things
by his verses.
that your Menalcas had preserved all by his verses, From what [part] the hills

Of this prediction by the chough on the left hand, see the first Eclogue. The
chough at the left hand, and the crow at the right hand, are said to be luckie,
forewarning dangers to avoid them.
That unless I had bin admonished by a happy divination [or prediction] by the
chough sitting on my left hand, foreshewing some danger toward me, and
therefore to cut off all new occasions of contention, etc.
That unless the chough sitting on my left hand had admonished me before from
the hollow holme tree, to cut off new contentions by any means whatsoever I
could,

Neither this thy [old friend] Meris [should liue] nor Menalcas himself [viz.
Virgil my maister] should live [could have escaped the soldiers hands.]
Neither this thy Meris nor Menalcas himself had lived.


Lyc. Alas, does so great a wickedness [or so foul a deed] fall upon any man
[viz. that he should intend to kill Virgil, or think of such a matter?]
Alack, can so great a wickedness fall on any man? Alack, Menalcas thy Joys

THE TENTH ECLOGVE [intituled] Gallus.
THE ARGUMENT.
Cornelius Gallus was A choice Poet.
an excellent Poet, and the first President or Lieutenant.
governor of Egypt, who when as He was even mad with the love of Cytheris an
harlot or where.
he Desperately or outragiously loved.
out of measure affected an harlot called Cytheris, One who was lately a
servant, now set free.
late servant of Voluminous, whom the Poet here calls Lycoris: Neither she
answered his mutual love, [viz. loved him not again.
and she answered not [his] mutual love, But he being despised* she had
followed Anthony into France, [viz. Anthonies army.
but despising him followed Anthony into France; He is believed, or credibly
reported.
is thought to have taken that repulse most grievously. Whereupon.
Therefore Virgil comforts him in this Eclogue, but yet so, as that he does not
depart from pastoral persons and Vplandish, rural, homely, or taken from
matters of the country.
rusticall comparisons. And also this whole.
All this argument likewise is almost taken out of The first Idy^ion of
Theocritus called Thyrsis.
Thyrsis of Theocritus, where he Follows or sets out.
prosecutes the like love of Daphnis.

In this Eclogue the Poet himself is the only speaker, though he after seem
to bring in Gallus comforting himself that the Arcadians should sing of his
loves. The Poet in this last pastoral being to celebrate the memory of another
famous Poet called Cornelius Gallus, inuocates the Nymphs of Syracusa to help
him
Oh Arethusa.
ONymph of the fountain Arethusa is a fountain of sweet water of Syracusa,
where Theocritus lived. Whereby he means the Muses of Syracusa and of
Theocritus, whom he inuocates to help him therein.]
Arethuse, grant me this last labor.

A few verses are to be said [or sung] to my Gallus [or of my Gallus] [viz. of
the loves of my Gallus toward Cytheris, whom here he calls Lycoris.]
I am to utter a few verses to my Gallus, but which Lycoris her self may
read. Can any one deny verses unto Gellus?

The fountain Arethuse is numbered among the wonders of waters, that it having
the head in Peloponnesus is thought to run marvelous far under the sea, and
to break soorth again at this fountain.
So bitter Doris [viz. the bitter or brackie sea] let her not intermingle [or
mixe] her wave [viz her water] to thee [viz. with thy sweet water] whenas thou
shall slide under the Sicanian floods [or streames] [viz. the waves of the sea
of Sicily.
As thou shall favor and help us, so let thy sweet^ waters be kept pure from
the salt waters of the sea, which the ru^st under.
So let not bitter Doris a Goddess of the sea, daughter to Oceanus, and wife
of Nere^ mother of the Nymphs, put for the sea by a Me^. (...).
Doris intermixe her streams with thee, when thou shall run under the Sicani
people of Spain or Sicily, which came from Spain, from whom the sea is
so-named.
Sicanian waves.

Here first begins the proposition of the Eclogue, wherein the Poet stirs up
himself and his Muse to sing some songs of Gallus and his careful loves. And
this from the time and his leisure, and also from the audience which they
should have.
[O Nymph] begin, let us speak of [or report] the careful loves of Gallus.
Begin, let us record the careful loves of Gallus.

Whilst that the little flat noz'd goats Do nip or brouze the young shootes, or
twigs, or new sprouts.
do crop the tender sprigs.

We sing not to the deaf, the woods Do answer all things [by their echo, or
by other shepherds.]
do answer every thing.

Secondly, he accuses the Muses that they were so careless of Gallus, to let
him so to leave his studies, and to perish in such unbeseeming love, that they
could not be found to reclaim or pity him, no not in any hill, nor about any
fountain.
O ye girls [called] Naiades, [viz. ye Nymphs of the fountains. [These were
Fairies haunting about such places.]
O Naiades, ye Nymphs, what Groves.

Muses.

When all things seemed to mourn for him, both bay trees, shrubs.
Even the laurel trees [haue wept for] him, and also the tamaruke [or beath]

Yea the very laurel trees [bewailed] him, and even the low shrubs wept for

wondered at this mad love of Gallus, enquiring whence it was.


All of them ask how Gallus should fall into this frantic love.
All ask, from whence this love [should be?] Yea the Gods themselves who had
had experience of the power of love, came to comfort him; as Apollo, who in
rebuking wise asks him, why he did so torment himself, seeing Lycoris was
run after another man, viz. after M. Antonius a Captain into France.
[and euen] Apollo came to thee:

[And] said, Gallus, why art thou mad?

Pan the God of Arcadia Thirdly, Pan the God of shepherds music came
likewise to comfort him, who is set out also by his Adjuncts: how he was
painted all red with elder berries and with vermilion.

Who comforts Gallus as Apollo did, rebuking him lovingly: That sorrow was no
means to cure love, but the more he wept, the more he might. And this he
illustrates by three similitudes or arguments a pari. That as grass cannot be
satisfied by rivers running by, nor bees with the flower of Cythisus, nor
goats with tender sprigs of trees, so nor love with tears.

Hither to has Virgil spoken in his own person: now is Gallus brought in
answering, and comforting himself.

First, that the Arcadians the only skillful musicians of the world, should
record his loves, and then how sweetly his bones should rest thereby.


But he [viz. Gallus] being sad [or pensiu^] said, ye Arcadians, etc.
But yet, quoth he, [though] very pensive* ye Arcadians shall sing these
[songs] in your mountains; ye Arcadians [I say] Being alone skillful to sing

shall my bones rest [in my grave.]

that your Song.

in future times?

I would to God.
And I do wish I had Secondly, that Gallus detesting his own estate, wishes
that he had been a countreyman, either a shepherd or a dresser of vines, for
the delights and company which such have to sport withal, as of Phillis and
Amyntas. That although Amyntas was black, yet so are violets and bramble
berries also.

Phillis should make him garlands, Amyntas should sing.


Phillis should gather garlands for me, [viz. flowers to make garlands for me.]
Phillis should gather me garlands, Amyntas should sing [me songs.] Thirdly, he
in a new and sudden passion of love, turns his speech to Lycoris, whom he
seeks to call back by the pleasantuesse of the places where he was. As cool
fountains, sweet meadows and woods.


O Lycoris [my loue] here [are] cold springs.
Here, O Lycoris, [are] Cold as ice.

Nunc insanus, etc.] Here Gallus breaks ou^ to bewail the misery both of
himself and of Lycoris his love. That as she was now, so his heart was with
her in the midst of the enemies and wars: and thus he falls into
exclamations, commiserating her hard heart and woeful case, by an Apostrophe,
turning his speech unto her.

In the 12 next verses Gall^ propounds unto himself the remedies which he will
use for the ^uring of his love, by contrary studies.
I will go, and will tune [or play] the songs which are made of me in Calcidian
verse, with an oaten pipe of a Sicilian shepherd.
I will be gone, and will tune With an oate.

It is determined [of me] to will rather to suffer [any misery.]
I am determined rather As first by giving his mind to the study of Poetry,
wherein he propounds to imitate Euphorion and Theocritus. And so to live
solitary in woods, there to write his songs of love, and to ca^e them in
trees, that they may grow up with the trees.
to endure [any miserie] in the woods amongst the dens of wild beasts, and To

of trees.]
to write my loves in tender trees: the [trees] will grow, [and so ye my] loves
shall grow. The second remedy of his love, should be by his traveling, and
seeking new loves.


In the mean while I will view the hills called Menalus, the Nymphs being mixed,
[or frequent there.]
In the mean time I will view the mountain Menalus, where the Nymphs frequent.
The third remedy, by giving himself to hunting, and by enduring therein
whatsoever annoyance; and this is set out by the places and delights which he
seemed to enjoy in the very conceit thereof.

and [therefore] let us [likewise] yield to love.

Here Virgil speaks himself, and concludes this Eclogue with an Apostrophe
and invocation of the Muses, that Gallus might accept of his homely verse; that
the Muses themselves would make these verses meet for Gallus, whilst ^e is
still making up his wicker stuff, viz. perfecting his other Pastorals.
Oh Ye Muses.
ye Goddesses, It shall suffice that your Poet [Virgil] has sung these songs
[viz. verses.]
it shall [now] be enough for your Poet to have sung these [sonnets.]

Whilst he sits and weaues [or plats] a little pannier [or maund] with a

Whilst he sits still, and makes a little basket of small limber twigs.

Pierius, ye shall make these [my] Greatest [verses] viz. fit and meet for
Gallus, [viz. that he may receive them with the like affection as I have
written them.]
chiefest [songs] [most acceptable] unto Gallus.

And thence he labors to express his love to Gallus, how his love toward
him did increase continually; and this by an argument a pari. That is increased
as much each hour, as the alder trees shootes forth in the prime of the
Spring.
To Gallus [I say] The love of whom increases so much to me in hours, [viz.
every hour.]
whose love grows so much in me every hour,

How much the green alder tree subjects it self [viz. grows spreading abroad
downward and each way] in the new spring [or in the beginning of the spring,
or in the flourishing spring.]
As the green alder tree spreads it self abroad in the prime of the Spring.

Afterward takes occasion to end this Eclogue from the danger of the place
where he sat, viz. under a juniper tree, the shadow whereof is especially
hurtful, as the shadows of all trees are to things growing under them, and
therefore he should arise.
Let us arise: the shade is wont to be Grievous to [men] singing, [viz. to
shepherds when they sing, lying under the shadows of trees.]
noisome unto them that sing;

The shadow of the juniper tree is Noisome [or hurtful, [viz. is especially
hurtful.
grievous: shadows [of trees] do hurt The fruits also, [viz. corn or
whatsoever grows under them.]

And finally he shuts up all by turning his speech unto his goats, that they
might now go home, both being full, and the evening star now showing it self.
[Oh ye my little goates] Being full.

Hitherto the Poet has described the beegarden, viz. the place fit for the
standing of bees: now he comes to a second precept concerning the hiues, to
show what ones they must be, both for the matter and fashion.
And also the hiues themselves, Whether [they shall be] sowed to them with
hollowed barks, [viz. whether you shall make them of barks of trees sewed
together,] or whether they shall be wouen with a limber twig [or ozier] viz.

After he proceeds to give warning of such things as are noisome to the
hiues, like as he had before for the bee-gardens: as that the good husband

Here now follows a third precept concerning the work of the Bees in the
Spring and in the Summer time. Where first the Poet describes the Spring by the
efficient cause of it, to wit, the Sun, viz. when the Sun coming nearer
unto us, has with his light chased away the Winter, and begins to bring the
Summer; that then the bees travel forthwith far and near thorough forests
and woods, and all other places where they may gather their provision.
That which remains [is this] [that] when the golden Sun has chased away the
Winter driven Unto the Antipodes, where it is Winter when it is Summer with us.

Afterward upon this occasion of their flying abroad, he comes to a fourth
precept, for the retaining of their swarms with sweet smells of herbs, and
with sounds.
Hence whenas Behold, [or mark it well:] for] they.
you shall behold a swarm sent forth even now out of their hiues unto the
skies, to wave through the clear Summer air; That when the keepers of them
see a great swarm of them gathered like a cloud, and wauing in the sky, they
then seek waters, and a new house amongst the boughs of trees.

and houses among the boughs of trees. Therefore to the end that they may
settle, they are to sprinkle the places with the usual iuyces of certain
herbs, as of balm, honysuccles, and the like; or to rub them with those
herbs, and withal to ring or tinkle with basins, cimbals, and other such like
sounding things, to keep them from flying quite away.

And hence he proceeds to a fifth precept, concerning the battles of the
bees, which he sets out by a principal cause thereof, and by signs. The
chief cause is discord arising between the kings or maisterbees.
But if they shall go forth to fight (for discord oftentimes Has gone with a
stately pace as in kings [viz. marched or crept] to two kings with a great
motion [or stir,] for that their kingdom is impatient of any consort, or

is the worst kind.

Upon this occasion the Poet makes a profitable digression to the
pleasantness and commodity of orchards and gardens, which he professes that
he would have prosecuted more fully, had be not purposed to be very brief in
this treatise, which he expresses by an allegory taken from mariner^
approaching near unto the ha^.

concerning the original or their first receiving of their excellent qualities,
which they are said to have had from Jupiter, for a reward of feeding him when
he was new born.

bees; where their whole work is expressed in diverse parts.

Here he still goes along, and to declare by the way what a com munitie they
have in laboring and resting together, and so likewise in sleep and watching:
That all of them rest together, and all of them labor together, that there
seems to be but one rest and one work unto them all.
[There is] one rest Of works to all, [viz. they all rest from their labor
together, and they all work together.

They rush forth of the gates early in the morning: delay [is] no where:
again, when as the evening star has admonished, the same [bees] depart at
length.
In the morning they rush out of [their] gates: How in the morning they rush

Then do they care for [their] bodies.
then do they cherish [their] weary bodies. How at that time when they are got
into the hiue, there is made a great humming noise by one of them flying about
the hiue; who by her sound commands all to take their rest.

Here is repeated their foreknowledge of the weather, and what they do therein.
That if it be like to be rainie or windy, they will not fly far from their
hiues.
But they do not depart or fly abroad far.
Nor yet indeed do they Go back longer from [their] stalls, [viz. go far
off from home,

And they try [or assay] short excursions, [flights, walks or iourneys] [viz.
to go no further then they may get home before the storm.]
And they adventure but short courses; and Or if they be overtaken by the
winds, they use to take up little stones to peize and carry themselves even and
steadily: like as floating boats do take up balasse, [viz. do l^ade themselves
with land or grauell] in a rough water, to preserve them safe, and to go the
better; even so do they take up these little stones to bear themselves even
through the empty air.
often times do they take up little stones, as Unstable [or wauering] boats [or

Next hereunto the Poet declares the manner of the breeding of bees.
You will wonder That manner to have pleased, [viz. that that custom has so

They have so great a love of flowers, and [such a] glory of making honey.

Here likewise is interposed the age of bees, and how long they live.
Therefore albeit the term of a narrow age receive them, [viz. although the
age of bees be but short.]
Therefore although That they live but a small time, not above seven years
commonly, (which is much too, considering their industry,) yet their stock
(if they be well looked to) and so the prosperous state and honor of their
houses remains almost immortal [viz. for many yeares] that the owners of them
may reckon the grandfathers and great grandsires of them.
the compass of a small age entertaines them, ( For neither more then a
seventh Summer is led of them.
for they do not live above seven years,)

Yet [ Their race and progeny do not decay utterly.

carefully looked into, abides very long.
the fortune of [their] house Stands by many years.
abides for many years; A man may number their progeny for many descents.
and the grandsires of their grandfathers are numbered [amongst them.]

Unto the natures of the bees, the Poet adds here their observance and honor
toward their kings: which he illustrates by comparisons from some
dissimilitudes and sundry effects. The dissimilitudes are these: that neither
the Egyptians, Lydians, Parthians, Medes, nor Indians, are so obseruant and
careful for their king, as the bees are for theirs.
Moreover The people of Egypt and of Lydia.

observe [their] king, [as bees do theirs.]

So long as their king be is safe.
The king being safe, One mind is to all, [viz. they are all of one mind.]
the same mind [is] in them all.

[But their king] being lost, they have broken their fidelity, and they
themselves have plucked as under their honey built up [viz. laid or hoorded up
in the honey combs.]
[But he] being lost, they break their faith, and they themselves spoil

Hence the Poet shows, that by these observations of their government, and
these former signs of their wisdom, some have thought that bees have reason
and some part of divine understanding.
Certain men have said by these signs, and following these examples, there to
be a part of the divine mind and airie breaths in bees.
Some by these signs, and following these examples, have said that there is a
part of the divine understanding and Draughts from the firmament [or divine
draughts] viz. such spirits as they draw from heaven.
also heavenly spirits in bees: for why [they say] God to go through all, [viz.
that God is a spirit, and i^ in all the elements, and every where, as the Poet
said before, Iouis omnia plena.

And from hence he proceeds to an eight precept, concerning the time of
emptying their hiues.

Hitberto the Poet has set out the nature of bees, by their causes, works,
subjects, adiu^cts: now he comes to the evils and dangers belonging to them.
Anger is to them, [viz to the bees.]
The bees have anger As first, that they will be angry without measure, and
being hurt, they will bite and sting.

wound, [viz leaving often their stings in the wound, and then they die presently

yea and lay down [their] lives in the [verie] wound. A second evil, is their
poverty, through the lack of honey in the Winter time, and by reason of
robbers, against which he teaches the remedy: That if you fear a hard
Winter, and have pity on your bees, and care to preserve them:


But if you fear Hard, because the bees get nothing that time, but only spend.

The Poet having thus described Aristaeus and his complaint, descends to the
Nymph Cyrene the mother of Aristeus, and her answer: wherein first he shows
how she perceived a doleful voice, and then describes her both by the place
where she was, viz. in her bedchamber, under the deep river Peneus; and also by
her attendants, the Nymphs round about her. Which Nymphs are again set out by
their work, that they toosed Milesian wool of a deep glassie color; and by

But here the Poet returns to declare the effect of Aristeus moan, that though

Then follows a second part of the na^ration of the manner of his receiving
into his mothers house, and entertainment there; and also his sending unto Pro^
for his entertainment. How after he was entered into his mothers house, (which

she knew that the cause of her sons weeping might easily be remedied* the
Nymphs which attended upon her (each in their order,) some of them brought him

After she shows him the manner how he must consult with this Proteus: That
first he must bind him before he ask any question of him, to the end that he
might the more speedily make known unto him the causes of the diseases of his
bees.
My son, this [Prophet Proteus] is to be catched of thee before with bonds,

And here she rehearses again the manner how her son should enforce him, when

that it was the beginning of the dogdays, viz when the dogstar burns in the

But yet how Orpheus himself though exceedingly bewailing his dear wife, yet
labored to assuage his sorrowful love with doleful songs and with his hollow
Iute. Which harmony of his is set out both by the places and times, and things
on which it wrought, and how far it did avail. That he sang of his sweet
wife, both by himself all alone in the desert shore, and also how he sang of
her in the morning, at the breaking of the day and in the eurning likewise at
the departure of the same, still sounding out E^ridice in most (...) sort.

And finally the Prophet shows, that his music so far prevailed, as that
he had recovered his Euridice again, upon this condition and law, that he
look ^ot behind him unto her, until they were both quite forth of hell:
whereunto they had proceeded, which is thus set forth by the Poet. That he was
returning back from hell, had escaped al dangers, with his wife restored unto
him, and was coming out of the infernal darkness into the light of this
world; and yet even there overthrew all his labors and hopes again, only
forgetting that law of Proserpina the Queen of hell, in looking back unto his
Euridice.

Proserpina [the Queen of hell] had given this law.)

Which is also further amplified by the causes and manner thereof. That a
sudden madness through the vehemency of his affection, caught away his unwary
mind to look back unto his Euridice (which though it was a great fault
against such a law and upon such a peril, yet was it a fault that in that case
might well have bin pardoned if the infernal spirits could pardon any thing.
