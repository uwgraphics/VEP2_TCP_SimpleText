An exposition after the manner of a co^templacyon upon ye.li. psalm called
Miserere mei Deus.
ALas wretch ye I am / confortlesse and forsaken of all men / which have
offended both heaven and earth. Whether shall I go? or whether shall I turn me?
To who shall I fly for socoure? Who shall have pytye or compassion on me? unto
heaven dare I not lift up mine eyes / for I have grievously sinned against it.
And in the earth can I find no place of defense / for I have been noysom unto
it. What shall I now do? shall I despair? God forbid. full merciful is god /
and my savior is meke and loving / therefore only god is my refuge he will not
despise his creature neither forsake his own image. Unto the therefore most
meke and merciful god come I all sad and sorrowful for thou only art my hope /
and thou art only the toure of my defense. But what shall I say unto ye / sith
I dare not lift up mine eyes? I will pour out the words of sorrow / I will
hartelye beseech the for mercy and will say. Have mercy upon me (oh god)
according to thy great mercy.

God which dwell in light that no man can attain / God which art hid and
can not be seen with bodily eyes / nor comprehended with any understanding
that ever was made / nether expressed with the tongues of men or angels. My
god, the / which art incomprehensible do I seek, the which can not be
expressed do I call upon what thing so ever thou art, which art in every place.
I know that thou art ye most hye and excellent thing, if thou be a thing /
and not rather the cause of all thing, if I may so call the, for I find no
name by the which I may name or express thine in enarrable majesty. God (I
say) which art all things that are in the, for thou art even thine own
wysdom, thy power and thy most gloriouse felycyte. Seeing therefore that thou
art mercyful, what art thou but even the very mercy it self? And what am I /
but very myserye? Behold therefore a god which art mercy, behold myserye is
before the, what shall thou do mercy? truly thy work, can thou do
otherwise then thy nature is? And what is thy work verily to take away
mysery, and to lift up them yt are in wretched condicyon, therefore have mercy
on me oh god. God I say which art mercy take away my misery / take away my
sins, for they are mine extreme miserye. Lift up me which am so miserable /
show thy work in me and exersyse thy power upon me. One depth requires
another, the depthe of myserye requires the depthe of mercy. The depthe of
sin axeth the depthe of grace and favor. Greater is ye depthe of mercy then
ye depth of mserye. Let therefore the one depth swalow up the other. Let ye
botomlesse depthe of mercy swalow up the profounde depth of myserye.

Have mercy on me oh god according to thy great mercy. Not after the mercy
of men which is but small, but after thine own mercy which is great, which
is unmeasurable, which is inco^prehe^sible, which passes all sins without
comparison.

According to that thy great mercy with the which thou have so loved the
world, yt thou would give thine only son. What mercy can be greater? What
love can be more. Who can despair? Who should not have good confidence? God
was made man and crucyfied for men. Therefore have mercy on me oh God
according to this thy great mercy by the which thou have given thy son
for us, by which (through him) thou haste taken away the sin of the
world, by which (through his cross) thou haste lyghtened all men, by which
(through him) thou have redressed all things in heaven and earth. Wash me (oh
lord) in his blood, lyghten me in his humilite / redress me in his
resurreccion. Have mercy on me oh god not after thy small mercy for that is but
thy small mercy (in comparison) when thou helpest men of their bodily euylles,
but it is great when thou forgeuest sins, and do eleuate men by thy
favor, above the top of the earth. Even so Lord have mercy on me
according to this thy great mercy, that thou turn me unto the, yt thou put
out my sins, and that thou iustefie me by thy grace and favor.

And according to the multitude of thy compassions wype away mine iniquite.

Thy mercy lord is the habundaunce of thy pytye, by the which thou lokest
gentely on ye poor and wretched. Thy compassions are the works, and processes
of thy mercy. Marie Magdalene came unto thy fete (good Jesus) she washed the^
with her tears and wyped the^ with her here, thou forgauest her and sentest
her away in peace, this was (Lord) one of thy compassions. Petre denied the
and forsook the with an oath / thou lokedste upon him and he wept bitterly /
thou forgaueste him and madeste him one of the chyef among thine Apostles this
was (lord) a another of thy co^passions. The these on the cross was saved with
one word. Paul in ye furious wodnes of his persecution was called and by and
by fulfilled with the holy ghost, these are lord thy compassions. The time
should fail me if I should number all thy merciable co^passions, for look how
many ryghtwyse men there be, and so many at thy godly compassions. There is
none that can glory in him self. Let them all come that at ryghtwyse other in
earth, or in heaven and let us axe them before the whether they be saved by
their own power and virtue.

And surely all they will answer with one heart and one mouth saying. Not
unto us (Lord) not unto us, but unto thy name give all the praise / for thy
mercy and for thy truths sake. For they in their own sword possessed not ye
land, and their own arm or power saved the^ not, but thy right hand and
thine arm, and the lyghte^ing of thy cou^tenau^ce for thou delytedste in the^
(yt is) they are not saved for their own deservings lest any man should boste
him self / but because it pleased the so to be. which thing the prophet does
also more expreslye witness of the when he says: he saved me because he would
have me. Since therefore that thou art the same god with who^ is no alteration or
variableness, neither art thou changed unto darkness: and we thy creatures
as well as our fathers which were borne under concupiscence sinners as well as
we / and sith there is but one mediator and atonemente between god and man that
is Christ Jesus which endures for ever / why doste thou not pour on thy
plentuous compassyons upon us / as well as thou did upon our fathers? have
thou forgoten us? or are we only sinners? did not Christ dye for us? Are all
thy mercies spent and none left?

Lord our god I desire and hertely beseech the / to put out mine iniquite
according unto the multitude of thy compassions. For many ye and infinite ar
thy compassions / that according (I say) to the multitude of thy co^passions
thou vouchsafe to quench my sin: that as thou have drawn and received
i^numerable sinners and haste made them ryghtuous / even so that thou will
draw and take me and make me ryghtwyse through thy grace and favor /
therefore according to the multitude of thy co^passions wype away mine iniquite.
Cleanse and purity mine heart yt (after all mine iniquite is put out and all my
uncleanness cleansed) it may be as a clean table in the which the finger of
god may write ye law of his love and charity with the which can none iniquite
continue.

Yet wash me more from mine iniquite and cleanse me from my sin.

I grant and knowledge oh lord thou have ones put out mine iniquite thou have
put it out again and haste washed me a thousand times / how be it yet wash
me from mine iniquite / for I am fallen again. Doste thou use to spare a
sinful man until a certain number of his sin / which when Peter inquired
/ how often shall my brother offend against me / and I shall forgive him /
whether seven times? thou answeredste: I say not seven times but seuentye
times seven times taking that certain nu^bre / for an infinite nu^bre. Since
then that a man must forgive so often shall thou in pardonyng and forgeuenes be
passed of a man? is not God more then man? is he not better then man? ye rather
God is the great lord and every man living is nothing thing but all vanite.
And only god is good and every man a liar, have thou not said. In what hour
so ever the sinner does repent I will not remember any of his iniquities?
Behold I a sinner do repete and morn for mine old preuy sores festred
within, and now at they broken forth for mine own folyshnesse. I am depressed
and sore broken I walk in continual morninge / I am feeble and very weak / I
roored for ye sorrow of mine heart. Lord all my desires are before the and my
sorrowful syghes at not unknown unto the. Mine heart tre^bleth and pants for
sorrow / my strength sayleth me and even the very syghte of mine ties cease from
their office. Wherefore then oh lord doste thou not put away mine iniquity?
And if thou put it out according to the multitude of thy mercyes / yet wash
me from mine iniquite. For yet am I not perfeytly purefyed, funished thy work,
take away the hole offense and also the pain that is due unto ye crune,
encreate thy light with in me. Kendle mine heart with thy love and cherite put
out al fear / for perfayte love sends away fear. Let the love of the
world, ye love of the flesh, the love of vain glory, and the love of my
self utterly depart fro me / yet fryll more and more wash me from mine
iniquite by ye which I have offended against my neighbor, and cleanse me from
my sin that I have committed against god. I would have the put away not only
the fault and pain that follows it, but also the occasion and nouryshment of
sin. Wash me I say with the water of thy gracyous favor, with water of
which he that drinks shall not thyrst for ever, but it shall be made in him a
fontayne of living water runnynge in to ever lasting life. Wash me with the
comfortable waters of thy holy scriptures that I may be nu^bred among them
unto whom thou saydest. Now are ye clean for my words which I have spoken unto
you Io. xiij.

For I knowledge mine inyquyte, and my sin is ever before mine iyes.

Although through the beholding of thy mercy and compassions I may be bold to
fly unto the (oh lord) yet will I not come as the Pharise which prayed not,
but rather there praised him self, and despised his neigh boure, but I come
unto the, as ye publican Lu. xviij. which durst not lift up his iyes unto
Heaven. For I also do knowledge mine inyquyte / and whiles I pondre my sins I
dare not lift up mine ties / but humbelynge my self with the Publicane I
say: God be merciful to me a sinner. My soul wauereth between hope and fear
and sometime for ye fear of my sins (which I feale and knowledge to be in me)
I am ready to despair / sometime through the hope of thy mercy / I am lyfted
up and conforted. Nevertheless because that thy mercy is greater the^ my
misery I will ever lord trust in the and will sing out thy plentuous
compassyons for ever. For I know that thou desyrest not the death of a sinner
/ but rather that he were converted and that he would knowledge his iniquite and
forsake his sin / and so come to the that he may live.

My god grant me that I may live in the / for I knowledge my wickedness / I
know what a grievous burden it is, how copious / and how ieoperdious. I am not
ignorant of it / I hide it not but set it eue^ before mine eyes / that I may
wash it with my tears and knowledge unto the Lord mine vnryghtwysnesse
against my self. And also my sin which I have proudly done against the /
is ever against me / and therefore it is against me / because I have sinned
against the: and it is truly against me / for it is eue^ against my soul / and
accuses me ever before the my judge and conde^pneth me ever and in every
place: and it is so against me that it is ever before my face and stondeth but
against me that my prayer may not perce through unto the / that it might take
thy mercy fro me and hinder thy mercy yt it can not come at me: therefore do I
tremble and therefore do I morn besechyng thy mercy. Therefore (oh lord) as
thou have given this grace unto me to know my wickedness and to bewail my
sin: eue^ so accomplysh this thy benevolence gyuynge me a perfayte faith /
and drawyng me unto thy son which has made a full satisfaction for all my
sins. Give me lord this precious gift for every good gift and every
parfeyte gift is from above coming from the father of light. Against the only
have I sinned: and have done that which is evil in thy sight: yt thou may be
justified in thy words: and may have ye victory when thou art judged. I
have ouermoch sinned unto the alone / for thou co^maundedst me ye I should love
ye for thy self / and should love al creatures for thy sake. But I have loved a
creature more then ye / loving it even for it self. What is sin, but to
love a creature for it self? and what is that / but to do against the? Surely
he ye loves a creature for it self makes that creature his God. And therefore
have I sinned against the only / for I have made a creature my god. So have I
cast the away / and have been miurious only to the / for I have not offen ded
against any creature in that I have set my trust or confidence in it. For it
was not commanded me that I should love any creature for it self. If thou
had commanded me that I should have loved an angel only for him self /
and I had loved money for it self / then no doubt I had offended against the
angel. But since yt thou only art to be loved for thy self (that is to say
without any respect other of good or evil) and every creature is to be loved
in the and for thy sake. Therefore have I surely offended only against the /
for I have loved a creature for it self.

But yet have I worse done / for I have sinned even i^ thy sight. I was nothig
asshamed to sin before thy face. Oh merciful god / how many sins have I
done in thy sight which I would in no wise have done before mortal me^ / yea yt
I would not in any case ye men should know I feared men more then ye / for I
was blind and loved blyndnes / and so did I nether se nor ones consider the. I
had only fleshly eyes / therefore did I only fear and look on men which ar
flesh. But thou lokedst on al my sins and numbered them / therefore I can
nether hyde them from the / nether turn my back and fly from thy face.

Whether shall I go from thy spirit and whether shall I fly from thy face?
What shall I then do? whether shall I turn me? whom shall I find to be my
defender? whom I pray you but the my god? who is so good? who is so gentle?
who is so merciful? for thou passest without comparion al creatures in
gentleness. It is one of thy chyefest propertyes to forgive and be merciful /
for through mercy and forgiveness thou do most declare thy almyhgtynesse. I
grant lord that I have offended only against the / and have done that which
is evil in thy sight. Have mercy therefore on me and express thy puysaunce in
me / yt thou may be justified i^ thy words / for thou have said: yt thou
came not to call ye rightwise / but fynners unto repentance. Justefie me
lord according to thy words: call me / receive me / and give me grace to do
true works of repentance. For this cause wast thou crucyfied / dead and
buried. Thou saydest also: John^. iij. when I am lyfted up from of the earth /
I will draw al unto my self / verefie thy words, draw me after yt let us
ru^ne to gether in ye sweetness of thine oyntmentes. Besides that thou
saydeste: Math. xi. Lome unto me all ye yt labor / and are laden, and I will
case you. Loo I come unto the laden with sins / laboryng day and night in the
sorrow of mine heart refresh and ease me lord that thou may be iustefied and
proved true in thy words / and may overcome when thou art judged / for
there are many that say: he shall have no so coure of his god. God has
forsaken him. Overcome lord these parsones when thou art thus judged of them
and forsake me not at any time. Give me thy mercy and wholesome socoure / and
then are they vaynqueshed.

They say / that thou wylt have no mercy on me / and that thou will cast me
clean out of thy fanoure and no more receive me. thus art thou judged of men /
and thus do men speak of ye / and these are their determynacyons / but thou
which art meke and merciful have mercy on me and overcome their judgments /
show thy mercy on me and let thy godly pytye be praised in me. Make me a
vessel of thy mercy / yt thou may be iustefied in thy words and have the
vyctorye when men do judge the / for men do judge the to be firce and
inflexible. Overcome their judgment with mekenes and benevolence / so yt men
may learn to have compassion on sinners / and that malefatours may be enflamed
unto repentance, seeing in me / thy pytye and mercy.

To I was fasshoned i^ wyckednes and my mother conceived me poluted with sin.

Behold not lord the greuousnes of my sins / consider not the multitude /
but look mercifully on me which am thy creature. Remember yt I am dust / and
that al flesh is as wytherd hay / for lo I am fasshoned in wickedness and in
sin has my mother conceived me. My natural mother (I say) has conceived me
of co^cupisce^ce / and in hit am I volluted with original sin. What is
original sin / but ye lack of original justice and of the right and pure
innocency which man had at his creacyon? therefore a man conceived and borne in
such sin is hole crooked and out of frame. The flesh coueteth against ye
spirit. Reason is slender / ye will is weak / man is frail and like vanity /
his senses deceive him, his ymagynacyon fails him his ignorance leads him
out of the right way / and he has infinite i^pedimentes which pluck him from
goodness and drive him in to evil. Therefore oryginall sin is the rote of all
sins and the nurse of all wickedness. for all be it ye in every man of sheyr
owue nature it is but one sin yet in powet it is all sins. Thou seiste
therefore Lord what I am, and of whence I am, for in orgynall sin (which
conteyneth al sins and iniquites in it) am I fashoned / and in it has my
mother conceived me, sith then I am hole in sins, and enuyroned with snares
on every side, how shall I escape? for what I would that do I not / but the
evil that I would not that do I. For I find a another law in my members
rebellynge agayneste the law of my mind / and subduynge me unto the law of
sin and death. Therefore the more frail and entang led thy godly beneuolece
sees me, so much the more let it lift up and confort me, who would not pytye
one ye is syke? who would not have compassion on him that is dysea sed? Come
come sweet Samaritane and take up the wounded and half dead / cure my wounds
/ pour in wine and oil, set me upon thy be, bring me into the houry /
committee me unto the host, take out two pence and say unto him, what so ever
thou spendest above this, when I come again I will recompense ye. To thou
have, loved truth / ye unknown and secret tgyngs of thy wisdom, haste thou
uttered unto me.

Come most sweet Samaritane / for behold thou haste loved truth / the truth
(I say) of thy promyses which thou have made unto mankind / them haste thou
truly loved: for thou haste made and kept them / so that thy love is nothing
else but even to do good for in thy self thou art inuartable and immutable /
thou vseste not now to love and anon not to love (as me^ do) neither does thy
love so come and go. But thou art such a lover as do the never change for thy
love is very god. Thy love therefore wherewith thou love a creature / is to do
it good, and whom thou most truest / to them art thou most beneficyall.
Therefore what means / that thou love truth / but that of thy gracious
mercy thou make us promyses / and fulfyllest them for thy truths sake? Thou
dydest promise unto Abraham a son when he was aged / thou fulfilledst thy
promise in old and ba^reyn Sara / because thou louedst truth. Thou promisedst
unto the children of Israel a land that flowed with milk and honye / and at
the last did give it the^ / for thy truths sake.

Thou made a promise to David saying: I shall set up thy seat regal one of
the fruit of thy body. and it came even to pass / because thou would be
found true. There are other iunumerable promystes in which thou have ever been
faithful because thou louedst truth. Thou haste promised to sinners which will
come unto the / forgyuenesse and favor / and thou have neues defrauded man for
thou have loved truth. That vnthryftye Son Luce. xv. that took his journey
in to a farte country and wasted all his goods with royatous living / when he
came to him self / he returned unto the saying: father I have sinned against
heaven and before the / now am I not worthy to be called thy son / make me as
one of thy hired servants. When he was yet a great way of / thou saw him
and had compassion on him / and rannest unto him / falling upon his neck
and kissing him / thou broughtest forth the best garment and put a ring
on his finger and shows on his fete / thou kylledst that fatted calfe and
made all the house merry saying let us eat and be merry / for this my son
was dead and is alive again / he was lost and is now found.

Why did thou all this lord god? surely because thou louedst truth. Love
therefore (o father of mercies) this truth in me / which return unto ye from a
far cu^tre run (...) wards me and give me a kys of thy mouth / give me those
chief garments / draw me i^ to thy house / kill ye fatted calfe that all which
trust in the may rejoice in me / and let us eat together in spyrytuall
feasts. On lord will thou exclude me alone and will thou not keep this
truth unto me? if thou should look narowly on our wickedness a lord: Lord
who might abide the? But lord thou will not be so strayte unto us / for thou
love truth: ye and that with a fervent and incomprehensyble love.

Which is the truth that thou so love? is it not thy son that said
Johan.xiiij. I am the way / truth / and life? he is the very truth of whom
all truth is named in heaven and in earth / this is it that thou haste loved
and in it only haste thou delyted for thou dydeste find it pure and with out
spotte and woldeste that it should dye for sinners. Keep therefore (Oh god) this
truth / behold I am a great sinner in whom thou may keep it / to whom
thou may forgive many sins / whom thou may purifye in the blood of thy
Christ / and whom thou may redeem through his passion why (Oh Lord) have
thou given me this knowledge of thy son / and this says of him? Because I
should se my redempcyon and not to attain it that I might by that means be
the more vexed with sorrow? God forbid. But rather that I may perceive the
remission of my sins purchased by Christ's blood / and so by his grace may
obtain it. Purge me therefore and redeem me oh lord (for thou have uttered
unto me the unknown and secret points of thy wisdom) that this knowledge may
help me and bring me unto health / for truly the Philosophers never knew
these things they were unknown unto them / yea and utterly hyd from them. And
no man knew these things (except a few whom thou louedste entyrelye) before
thy sons incarnacyon.

The most curious serchers of ye world (I meanet the wise men of this world)
lifted up their eyes above heaven and yet could not find this thy wysdom / for
thou haste hyd these things from the wise and prudente / and haste opened them
unto babes / that is / to humble fysshers and thy holy propehtes which also
have vittered them unto us. And so have thou uttered ye unknown and secret
things of thy wysdom and of thy scryptures unto me / why do I know them in
vain? I know them surely in vain if they profyt me not unto my health and
salvation. For the philosophers when they knew god by his marvelous creatures
they gloryfied him not as god neither were thankful / but vexed full of
vanities in their imaginacyons and their folysshe hertes were blinded. When
they counted them selves wise / they became toles. Wylt thou suffer me lord to
be or their number? God forbid. For thou art even mercy it self which does
never utterly forsake any man. Favor therefore lord / favor and spare thy
servant / and command him to be of the number of thy babes / that the
unknown secrets of thy wisdom which is an hye / that thou may be praised
in the work of thy mercy which thou doste exercise toward thy seruante
(Lord) which never forsakest them that trust in the.

Sprynkle me Lord with ysope and so shall I be clean / thou shall wash me /
and then shall I be whytter then snow.

Because lord that thou haste loved the truth and haste opened unto me the
unknown secrets of thy wisdom / I am well counforted and I trust that thou
wylt not cast me out of thy favor / but thou will sprynkle me with ysope and
so shall I be etensed. Ysope is a low herb / it is hoar and of a good savor
/ which sygnyfyeth nothing else / but thy only sone our lord Jesus christ /
which humbled him self unto death: even unto ye death of the cross. Which with
the hete of his fervent charity loved us / and washed us from our sins in his
blood. Which with the redolent sauoure of his benevolence and ryghtuousnes
replenyshed the hole world. Therefore with this ysope shalt thou spryncle me /
when thou poureste upon me the virtue of his blood: when Christ thrughe faith
shall dwell in me: when thrughe love I am joined with him: when I shall
countrefayte his humylyte and passion / then shall I be cleansed from all mine
uncleanness. Then shalt thou wash me with mine own tears which flow out of
ye love of christ / then shall I syghe until I be weeye / I shall water my bed
every night with my tears / so that it shall swymme in them / and then shalt
thou wasshe me and I shall be whytter then snow.

Snow is white and cold / but lord if thou spryncle me with ysope, I shall
be more whyter then snow / for I shall be thrughly endued with thy splendent
light which passes all bodily witness. And when I am enflamed with ye light
I shall forsake all my carnal co^cupiscences / cold unto worldly things /
and e^flamed unto heavenly

Unto my hearing shalt thou give joy and gladness and my brosed bones shall
be refreshed. Then lord shall I pray unto the / erly (that is in the begynnyge
of thy light) shall thou hear my voice and I shall hear what ye lord god
shall speak in me for he shall speak peace for his people and shall give me
peace. Lord thou shalt give me peace for I have trusted in the / unto my
hearing shall thou give joy and glagdnesse / When I shall hear that
confortable words that marie herd. And what herd marie (I speak of that
marye which sat at the fere of Jesus mat.xxvj.) what herd she? Thy faith has
saved the to thy ways in peace. Let me also hear that the these herd: this
day shalt thou be with me in paradyse / then shall I have joy for the
remyssyon of my sins / and gladness for thy bounteous and lyberall promyses
/ shall I not rejoice and be glad / when thou shall give me two fold for all
my sins? then shall I begin to taste how sweet the lord is / then shall I
learn to be co^uersant in heavenly thiges and shall say with the prophet: how
great and copious is that sweetness lord which thom haste laid up for they
in that fear the Then shall I rejoice and be glad and my brosed bones shall be
refresshed. What are the bones which sustain the flesh but the powers of
our soul and reason that bear up the fraylte of our flesh that he run
not hedlonge in to all vices / that a man fall not hole in to vanite and so
consume away? These bones I say are sore brosed / for the reason is very
weak / and the will is prone and ready to all myschyef / for even now the
flesh obeys not reason / but reason must obaye the flesh / so that I can
not resist vice / for my bones at brosed. And why are they brosed? for they
have forsaken the / the fountain of living water / and have dygged for them
selves cesterns full of chynnes which can hold no waters / for they are not
filled with thy grace without which no man can live well / for without the we
can do nothing. They trusted in their own power which is no power and therefore
decayed they in their own folysshnesses. Therefore let thy power come (oh
lord) and then shall these brosed bones be refresshed / let thy grace come and
that faith which works through love. Let thy powers and gifts assist me /
and then my brosed bones shall be refreshed / for my reason shall be mercy / my
memory glad and my will full of joy. And thus shall they all rejoice / for
above their own natural strenghte / when they goo about any good work they
shall proceed and prospere well / neither shall they leave it vnperfeyte but
through thy help shall they bring it to good pass and effect.

Turn thy face from of my sins and wype away all my wyckednes.

Why lokest thou lord upon my sins? why nu^brest thou them? why considerest
them so dilyge^tlye? doste thou not know that man is even as a flower of the
field. why doste thou not rather look in the face of thy Christ? Alas wretch
that I am. why se I the angry against me? I grant I have sinned / how be it
for thy gentleness have mercy on me. Turn thy face from of my sins. Thy
face is nothing but thy knowledge / turn away therefore thy knowledge wherewith
thou scest and perceyuest all things / but that whereby thou approuest and
disalowest al things / wherbye thou alowest the works of the ryghtwyse and
condemp^^st the reprouable sins of the wicked / know not my sins on that
manner that thou would impute them unto me and lay them to my charge. But
rather turn away thy face from my sins that through thy mercy they may be
quenched / look lord on the creature whom thou haste wroughte / look upon thine
own image / for I poor wrethe have put upon me the image or ye devil (that
is sin) turn away thy face from the image of the devil and be not angry
with me / and behold thine own image that thou may have mercy on me. O
merciful lord / remember that thou lokedste upon Zacheum which did clym up
in to a wild fig tree to se the. Lu.xix. And thou entredst in to his house
which thou would never have done if thou had looked on the image of the
devil which he had put on him / but because thou saw thine own image on
him / thou had compassion on him and heledst him. He promised to give yt
half of his goods to the poor / and if he had falsely deceived any man to
restore it four fold and he obtained mercy and health. And I bequeth my
self even hole unto ye nothing reserved. And promise to serve ye for ever
with a pure heart and will fulfill my promise al days of my life wherefore then
Lord do thou not look in thine image in me also? Why do thou yet cons^d^^
my sins? Turn, I beseech the thy face from my sins and wipe away al my
wickedness / wype away a: I pray ye that none remain. For it is written he ye
keeps the hole law and offends in one point is gyltye in the hole / yt is
to say, has desetued damonatio^ / which is the pain of all sins that lead
unto death. Put out therefore all my wickedness / that none offend the /
which should bring me to condempnacyon.

A pure herre create in me oh god and an vpryghte spirit make a new within me.

For my heart has forsaken me and goes astraye utterly forgettyng his owe
health: it is wandered in to strange cuntres and ensues vanities / and his
eyes / are in ye vtmust costs of the world. I called it again / but it
aswerd me not. It is gone / lost / and sold under sin. what now lord? what
shall I say? A pure heart create i^ me go / an humble heart / a courteous heart /
a peaceable heart / a ge^rie heart / a devout heart / such an heart as will
nether do an other man hurt / nether yet avenge him self when he is offended
/ but rather do good against evil, and such an heart as will love yt above all
thing / which will think of yt, speak of the, and thank yt. which will delight
in hymynes and spiritual songs and be hole conuersaunt in heavenly things
Treat this heart in me (oh God) create is of nothing / that it may be of such
effecacite through grace / as nature is never able to make it. This grace
comes only from the in to the soul through thy creacyon / it is the beautye
of a pure heart / it draws unto him al virtue and expels all vice /
therefore create in me Oh god a pure heart through thy grace and make a new an
vpryght spirit in my bowels.

For thy spyryte shall lead me in to a right way / which shall purge me
from all erthy affectes and shall lift me up unto heuenlye things. The lover
and the thing that is loved are both of one nature. He that loves bodily
things is worldly / but he yt loves spiritual things is spiritual. Beue me
aspirite that may love the and worship the / the most hye spirit / for god
is a spirit and they which worship him, must worship him in the spirit and
verite. Beue me an vpryghte spirit not sekyng his own spirit profyt and
glory / but the will and glory of god renew an vpryghte spirit within me /
renew it / for my sins have quenched the first that thou gave me. Beue me
now a new spirit that it may redress that thing which is inueterate / my
soul is also a spirit and so made of the that of her self she is right /
for of her own nature she loves the above her self and desires all things
for thy glory / so that her own natural love is right / for it comes of the
but of her own froward will it is inueterate and polluted causing her natural
love to decay. Make new therefore this spirit and this love through thy grace
that it may walk in the right way according to his nature renew it (I say)
that it may ever inflame me with heavenly love / that it may ever cause me to
sighe unto the / to enbrace the contynually and never to forsake the.

Cast me not away from thy face / and thy holy ghost take not from me.

Behold lord I stand before thy face that I may find mercy I stand before
thy benign goodness lokynge for thy favorable answer / cast me not confused
from thy face. who came ever lord unto the / and went away confused? who
ever desired thy favor / and went without it. Surely thou passeste in thy
aboundamte pytye both the deservings and also the desires of them that pray
unto ye / for thou gyuest more then men can desire ye or understand when they
have it. It was never herd that thou dydest cast away from thy face any man
that ever came unto the Shall I oh lord be the first that shall be cast away
from thy face and utterly confounded? wylt thou begin at me to co^founde
them yt come unto the? wylt thou never more have mercy and compassyon? god
forbydde. The woman of canane followed the / she cried and made piteous noise
she moved the dyscyples unto co^passyon / and thou hyldest thy peace / she
continued knocking / she worshypped the and said: Lord help me / neither yet
would thou answer. Thy dyscyples entreated for her saying: let her go for
she cries after us. But what was thyn answer lord I pray the / what dydst
thou answer: forsoothe y^ she wept in vain and labored for naught for thou
saydst that thou wast not sent but unto the sheep that were peryshed of the
house of Israel. What should this woman do when she herd these words? verelye
even dyspeyre as concerning the grace yt she required: and yet dispeyred she
not / but trusting in thy meercye prayed yet again saying: Lord help me /
unto whose importunyte (Lord) thou answeredst / it is not good to take the
chyldrens breed and cast it to hounds as though thou sholdest have given
her a full answer and said depart from me / you Canaanites at w^ges / ye are
Idolatres / the precious gifts of heavenly favor perteyne not unto you / I
ought not to take them away from the jews which worship tho true and living
god / and to give them to such dogs as ye are which worship ydols and
deuyls. What shall thou now do thou woman of Canaan? thou may now be a
shamed and get the away / for the lord is angry not with the alone / but
also thy hole nacyon. Oh lord god / who would not have been co^founde and have
pyked him away at these thy words? who would not have mumbled and grudged
agaygst the? who would not have judged the to be cruel? And yet did this woman
continue still in prayer. She cast not away her confydence / she took not these
hard words heuelye / she was not angry / but she humbled her self the more
and abode still in her petycyon and said with good fyaunce: It is truth lord
that thou say / but I axe no breed / I axe not the favor that the
children should have. I am a little whelpe and desire the cromes which fall from
the childrens table. Let them floryshe and aboundde with miracles and other
gracious favors / but let not me be destitute of the cru^me of grace, yt my
daughter may be delyuerd from the fendes possessyon for the whelps do eat
of ye cru^mes which fall from their masters tables / Behold what faith / what
trust, and what humylyte was in this woman / therefore thou not dyspleased with
her importunate instaunce / but reioysynge in her excellent co^stauncye dydst
say. O woman great is thy faith / be it unto the as thou will. Why are these
things written lord god? that we may learn to trust in the, that we may humbly
and deuoutlye contynew in prayer / for thou will give it if men be greadye.
But the kingdom of heaven suffers vyolence / and they ye make vyolence unto
it catch it / for what things so ever are written are written for our learning
ye thrughe patience and confort of the scryptures we may have hope. Last me
not therefore lord from thy face / which stand weeping and waylynge day and
night before thy face / not that thou sholdest deliver me from the bodily
oppressyon of deuylles / but that thou will deliver my soul from his
spyrytuall power and domynyon. Let me not be shamed (O swear Jesus) for in ye
only have I trusted I have no health nor confort but in the o lord: for all
have forsaken me / even my brethren and children have cast me of / and mine own
bowels abhor me. I have none othee helper / but only ye / Last me not
therefore away from thy face / and take not thy holy spirit fro me. There is
no man which can say ye Jesus is ye lord but the holy ghost / therefore if I
call upon the lord Jesus / that do I in the holy ghost. If I be sorye for my
sins which are passed / if I are forgyuenesse / this do I verily by the holy
ghost. Therefore I beseech the take not fro me thy holy ghost / but that it
may be with me / and labor with me / for we wore not what to desire as we
ought to do. But the spirit helps our infirmiries and makes intercession
for us / that is, makes us to pray with such sorrowful groninges as can not
be expressed with tungue therefore take not away this thy holy spirit fro me
/ that he may teach me to pray / and help me in my labor and may cause
me to continue in prayers and reares / that at the length I may find favor
before thy face / and may serve the all days of my life.

Make me again, to rejoice in thy saving health / and strengthen me with a
pryncypall spirit.

It is a great thing that I desire o lord / how be it since thou art god a great
Lord / and king over all gods / he does the injury which asks small
things of the. All transytory and corruptible things at but small in thy
syghte: but spiritual and everlasting things are great and precious. Take
away the spirit and soul from the body / and what remains but most vile
dunge / duste and a vain shadow? therefore even so much dyfference there is
between the spirit and the body / as it is between the body and his shaw we /
so may I conclude that he which asks bodily things asks but vain
tryfles but he that desires spiritual things does surely desire great
things / but specallye he that desires thy saving health. What is thy
saving health but Jesus thy son? which is very god and everlasting life /
why shall I not then ask of the this thy savior / sith thou art a mighty and
most lyberall father / which gave him unto the death of the cross for me.
Now sith thou have so offered him for me / why should I be a shamed to ask him
of the? It is a great and noble present, neither am I worthy to have such a
gift / how be it, it becomes thy worthy lyberalite to give such noble
gifts / for this therefore thine inestable gentleness I dare p^ro;sum to come
boldly unto the and to desire thy saving health in whom I might fully
rejoice. For if of his carnal father any son ask fyshe / will he reach him
a serpente? And if he ask an egg / will he give him a scorpion? or if he ask
breed / will he give him a stone? Now if carnal fathers being evil and
sinners / will give unto their chyldre good gifts which they have received of
the: how much more thou heuenlye father which of thine own substance art
good / and will give a good spirit to them ye desire it of the? Behold thy
son which is returned from a far country sorowyng and repentyng / asks
of the, the fyshe of faith / for as the fyshe lies secret under the water /
even so is faith of such things as are not seen / he asks I say a true
faith yt he may rejoice in thy saving health: will thou reach him a serpent?
will thou give him ye venom of unfaithfulness which proceeds from yt old and
crooked serpent ye devil? I desire of the o lord the egg of hope ye eue^ as
out of an egg we hope for a chyke^ / so through hope / that thou will grant
me to come unto the syghte of thy saving health / that out of my hope may
come this wholesome sight / as the chycke does out of the egg. I desire the egg
of hope / that my soul through hope may be sustained in this vale of tears
and may rejoice in thy saving health: wylt thou give me the scorpyon of
desperacio^? ye as a scorpyon has poison in the end of her tail / so I in
the last end of my life should reserve sin / delyrynge my self and taking
my pleasure with ye entysementes of this world / which seem beautyful and
flateryng / even as a scorpyon does in the face? I desire of the also (o lord)
the breed of Christ's charity by the which he does comunycate him self (even
as breed) unto all men / that I may ever rejoice in thy saving health / will
thou give me a stone / that is to say hardness of heart? God forbid. Why shall
I then mystrust for to desire and obtain great things of the o lord, seeing
thou sturryst me up and byddest me ask and knock / even till I seem
importunate? And what thing can I ask which thou shall be better co^tente
with all / or else that should be more wholesome for me then ye thou sholdest make
me rejoice in thy son our saving health? Now have I tasted how sweet the lord
is how easy and pleasant his burden is. I remember what peace and tranquilite
of mind I was in / when I ioyed in god / and reioysed in Christ my Lord and
savior / therefore am I now in more sorrow / for I know what goodness and
commodicye I have lost / therefore will I cry more importunatlye: Make me
again to rejoice in thy saving health / restore me again ye thing which my
sins have lost. Restore me that which through my faure is perisshed in me.
Restore me (I beseech the for his sake that ever is on thy right hand and
makes intercession for us) thy gracyous favor / that I may perceive that
through him thou art pacefyed toward me that it may be as a seal upon my
heart / and that I may say with the Apostle Paul Galath.ij. I am crucyfyed
with Christ / I live verily / yet now not I / but Christ lives in me. But
because my frailtye is great / strength me with a princypall spirit that no
troubles or afflyctions may separate me from Christ that no fear may cause
me to renye the / and that no pains may make me flyde from the. My strengt is
not suffycyent to resist and fight with that old serpent and to prevail
against him. Peter has taught me how great our infyrmitye is / he saw ye with
his bodily iyes (Lord Jesus) and was most famylyarlye conuersaunt with the he
tasted of thy glory in the mountain / when thou wast transfigured: he herd
the fathers voice: he saw thy manyfolde and wondrous works / yea and through
thy power did him self many miracles. He walked on his feate upon the waters
/ and herd daily thy mighty and sweet words: he thought him self most
fervent and hot in ye faith and said that he was ready to go with the both in
to preso^ and unto very death. And when thou toldest him yt he sholdest deny
the he believed the not: he trusted in his own strenght / and trusted more unto
him self being but a man / then unto the being very god. But when the hand
maiden said unto him. Thou art of the same company / he was afraid by and by
and denied it. There came an other maid and said: Surcly thou art of the same
folk: And he denied the again.

He could not stand before women, how should he then have stand before
kings and tyrauntes? And when he was yet ones more inquired of the by standers
and was accused to be one of his disyples / he began to curse and to swear that
he knew the not / what think you he said I suppose yt he swear by god and by
the law of Moses yt he knew the not / adding such words. Think you that I
am the disciple of this Samaritane which / deceyueth the people which is
inspyred with the devil / and destroys our law? I am the discyple of Moses
/ and know not from whence this fellow is. Blyssed be God that they ceased
enquiryng any further / for else would he never have ceased denyenge the / so
that a thousand interogacyons would have made a thousand flat negations:
yea a thousand curses and periuryes / yet were these interogations but words.
What would he have done (I pray the) if they had scourged him and buffeted him
well? Truly he would have sought and proved all means / denyenge / for
swerynge / cursyng and blasphemyng until that he had escaped their hands. But
thou most meke Lord lokedst back upon him and by and by he knowleged his
offense: Neither yet durst he leap in to the mids of they in and confess
the to be the son of God / for he was not yet strengthed with power from
above / so that without doubt he would have denied the again if he had seen
any ieoperdye at band / therefore as it was woste mete for him / he went forth
and wept bytterly. But thou after thy resurrecio^ appearedst unto him and
co^fortedst him and yet hyd he him self for fear of ye jews? he saw the so
gloryously ascendyng unto heaven and was strengthed by the syghte and and
comfort of angels / and yet durst he not go abroad / for he had learned by
experience to know his own fragylite and had proved his weakness. Therefore
did he tarry and wait for the holy ghost which was promised. When he was come
and had ^uled Peter's heart with grace / then siep^e he forth: then began he to
speak / and then with great power and signs bare he witness of thy
resurrection. The^ feared he neither the hye priests nether yet kings / but
reioysed in tribulacions and received the cross with all myrthe and gladness.
Therefore strengthen me lord with a principal spirit that I may contynually
rejoice in thy saving health / or else can I not bear so many assautes against
me. The flesh coueteth contrary to the spirit. The world assayleth me on
every side. The devil siepeth not. Give me the strenghte of thy spirit yt
there may fall by my side a thousand and ten thousand by my right hand
that I may be a sure and strong witness of thy faith / for if Peter whom
thou enduedste with so many favorable gifts / did fall so wretchelye / what
should I do lord which have nether seen thy natural presens: nether have
tastede of thy glory in the mountain: nether have seen thy gracyous miracles:
yea and have scarsely perceived thy marvelous works / and have never herd thy
voice / but have been ever subdued under* sin therefore strength me with a
pryncypall spirit that I may persevere / in thy scruyce and give my life for
thy sake.

I will instruct the wicked that they may know thy ways: and the ungodly
shall be converted unto the.

Ascribe not this oh Lord unto presumsio^ / if I go about to teach the
ungodly thy ways for I desire not to teach them as I now am wicked /
ungodly and under ye bonds of syfie / but if thou make me again to rejoice
in thy saving health: if thou strengthen me with a prynecip al spirits and if
also thou set me free / then shall I teach the ungodly thy ways. Neither is
this hard unto the / which of very stones can raise up chldren unto Abraham
/ neither can my sins be impediment unto the if thou will do this / but
rather where sin is so aboundaunte / there abounds grace Paul yet
brethynge out threatenings and slaughter agayyste the dyscyples of the lord
received co^myssyon that if he found any whether thy were men or women which
followed the and professed thy faith / he should bring them presoners to
Jerusalem. And forth was he going like a mad harebrayn and as a rauenyng
wolf / for to stray a broad / rauysh and kill thy sheep. But whylles he was
yet in his journey even in the heat of his persecucion / and in actual doing
of his fynne / whiles he was persecuting the and would have slain thy chosen /
having no manner of preparatyue unto grace / neither yet knowledge of his syn^e /
when with heart and will he was thine aduersarte / blasphe med and cursed the.
Behold the voice of thy mercyable pytye unto hi saying: saul saul why
perscuteste me? by the which voice he was immedyatlye both laid a long and
raised up: he was laid a long and overthrown as concerning his body / but he
was taysed up with ye mynnd / thou raysedste him up that was in the sleep of
dark ignorauncie and pouredst in thy glorious light in those yets which were
oppressed with this blind sleep: thou shewedst hun thy favorable face and
endued him with thy gracious mercy. Then was he reyfed as it had been from
death / he opened his yeis / he saw the and said: lord what wylt thou that I
do? and after dydest thou send a sheep to this wolf / for thou co^maundest
Ananias to go unto him: And then was he baptized and anon was he replenyshed
with the holy ghost / and was made a chosen vessel to bear thy name before
kings / nations and the chylder of Israel. And without delay he entered in to
the synagoges and preached thy name stoutlye / affyrmynge that thou art
christ / He dysputed / prevailed and confounded ye Jues. Behold lord even
straight of a persecutoure / thou made him a preacher and such a preacher
that labored more then all the other Appostles. O how great is thy powere /
if thou wylt of a wicked man make a ryghtwyse / or of a persecurtoure a
preacher / who shall forbid the? Who shall rysyst the? who may say unto the,
why do thou so? All things that thou would have thou made in heaven and in
earth / in the sea and in all bottomless depth. Therefore impute it not to
arrogancye if I coueyte thrughe thy power and not through mine own to teache the
wicked thy ways / for I know that I can offer nothing which can be so
acceptable in thy godly syghte / this is the most pleasant sacryfyce / and
also for my for my singular profit / now if thou chafige me in to an other man
/ then will I teach the wicked thy ways / not the ways of Plato and Aristole
/ not the intricate and sotle proposicyons of man's wit / not the
iustructions of phylosophye / not the painted words and vain colors of ye
rethorycans. Not worldly matters and policyes / not unfruitfully ways of vanue /
not ways that lead men in to death: But thy ways and thy precepts which
lead unto life / nether will I teach them only one way but many ways for
many are thy commandments / how be it all these ways end in one / that is
in love and charity / which does so combynde the faithful hertes / that they
have one mind and one will in god. Or else may we understand by thy many
ways / the diverse manner of living / wherein every man walks according to his
vocacyon: some married / some living chaste in wedowhod / some vyrgyns and so
forth / these walk after diverse ways in to their heuenlye inherytaunce he
may best subdue his rebellyous me^bres. Thus will I teach the wicked thy ways
according to their capacite and co^dicyon: And the ungodly shall be converted
unto the / for I will preach unto them not my self / but Christ crucified:
and they shall be converted not unto my praise / but unto the / geuyng the all
honor and praise / they shall leave their own ways and come unto thine / that
they may walk in them and so consequently attain unto the.

Deliver me from bloudes (oh god) the god of my health / and my tongue shall
tryumphe upon thy ryghtwysnes.

I am styfled in much blood / and from the depth of it shall I cry unto the
lord / Lord harken unto my voice. Tarry not lord for I am even at the very
point of death / this blood that I speak of ar my sins / for as the
bodily life consysteth in blood / even so is the life of a sinner in his
sin: pour out the blood / and the beast dies: pour out the sin
knowlegynge it unto god / and the sinner dies and is made ryghtwyse. Neither
am I wrapped in blood / but overwhelmed and drowned in bloudes / full stremes
of blood do drive me in to hell / help me lord less I peryshe. Oh God which
gouernest all things / which only can deliver me / in whose hand is the
spirit of al life / ryd and purge me from these bloudes. Deliver me from
bloudes (Oh God) the auctor of my health / God in whom only consysteth my
salvation. Deliver me Lord / as thou delyueredst Noe from the waters of the
floude. Deliver me as thou delyueredst Loathe from the fire of Sodom. Deliver
me as thou delyueredst the children of Israel from the depthe of the red see /
deliver me as thou delyuerdst Jonas from the belly of ye whale / deliver me as
thou delyueredst the three children from the furnace of burning fire. Deliver me
as thou delyueredst Peter from the peril of the sea. Deliver me as thou
deliueredst Paul from the depthe of the sea. Deliver me as thou have delivered
infinyte sinners from the power of death and from the gates of hell. And then
shall my tongue tryumphe thy ryghtwysnes / that is, for thy ryghtwysnes which
I shall feale ane perceive in me through thy gracyous favor. For thy
ryghtwysnes (as thapostle say the To. iij.) comes by the faith of Jesus
Christ unto all and upon all them that believe in him / then shall my tongue
tryumphe in praysyng this thy ryghtwysnes / co^mendynge thy favor /
magnifieng thy pyty / knowlegynge my sins / that thy mercy may be declared
in me which would vouch safe to iustefye such a great sinner / and that all
men may know that thou sauest them which trust in the and delyuerest them
from extreme anguysshe and aduersite o lord our god. (...) Lord open thou my
lips: and then my mouth shall show forth thy praise. (...) Thy praise is a
great thing o lord / for it proceadeth out of thy fountain whereof no sinner
drynketh. It is no glorious praise that comes of a sinners mouth / deliver me
therefore from blood (oh lord) ye god of my health and my tongue shall
magnify thy ryghtwysnes. And then shalt thou lord open my lyppes and my
mouth shall show forth thy praise / for thou have ye kaye of David which
shettest and no man opens / and openest and no man shetteth / therefore open
thou my lyppes as thou openest the mouths of infantes and sucktlynges / out of
whose mouths thou have stablisshed thy praise. These truly were thy Prophets
/ Apostels and other saints which have praised the with a syngle and pure
heart and mouth / and not the Philosophers and orators which have said / we
will magnyfie our tongue / our lyppes be in our own power / who is our god?
They opened their own mouths / and thou openedst them not / neither yet
stablysshed thy praise out of thyr mouths. Thy infauntes lord praised the and
despised the^ selves: The philosophers went about to praise them selves and
magnifye their own name. Thy suckelynges extolied thy fame and glory which
they knew through heuenlye fa^oure. The philosophers knowing the only by
natural creatures / could never perfeytlye exproue thy renown. Thy saints
magnified the with their heart / mouth and good works. The philosophers only
with words and their own sotle imaginations, thy children have spread thy
glory throughout all the world: The philosophers have instruct but a few of
their own adherentes. Thy fredes wi^h spredyng thy glory have converted
innumerable men from sin unto virtue and unto true felicyte: The Philosophers
nether knew true virtues neither yet true felycyte. Thy well-beloved have
preached openly thy bounteous gentleness and mercyable favor / which thou
shewedst in thy dear son unto all the world. But the philosophers could
never attain to know it. Therefore out of the mouth of infauntes and
suckelynges haste thou stablysshed thy praise / for it have ever pleased the to
exalte the humble and bring low the proud / now seeing thou do ever
resist fyst the proud / give me true humilite that thou may stablysshe thy
praise by my mouth. Give me a chyldes heart / for excepre I turn back and
become as a child I can not enter in to the kingdom of heaven / make me as one
of thy infauntes or suckelynges / that I may ever hang on the teates of thy
wisdom for thy teates are better then wine / and thy wisdom better then all
richesse / so that nothing can be compared unto it / for it is to me^ an
infinite treasure which they that use are made pertetakers of the frendshyp of
god / therefore if thou make me a child the^ shall thou stablyshe thy praise in
my mouth. for then shalt thou open my lyppes and my mouth shall show forth
thy praise and shall perfeytly declare it even as thou have publyshed it by the
mouth of thine infantes and suckelinges. If thou had desired sacrifices I had
surely offered them but thou delyghtedst nor in burnt sacryfices.

My mouth lord shall show forth thy glorious fame / for I know ye this thing
is most acceptable unto the since thou say by ye prophet Psalm.xlix. ye
sacrifice of praise shall glorify me / and by ye means shall I be entised to
show him my saving health / therefore will I offer praise unto ye eue^ ye praise
of infauntes and suckelynges for my symies. And why shall I offer for my sins
rather praise the^ sacryfice? for if thou had desired sacryfices I had
surely offed them / but thou delyghtest not in burnt sacryfices / can thou
be pacefied with the blood of calves or gootes? will thou eat ye flesh of
bulls / or drink the blood of gootes? Other do thou desire gold which
possessest heaven and earth? other wylt thou that I sacryfice my body unto the
which desyrest not the death of a sinner / but rather that he were converted
and live?

Nevertheless I will chasten my flesh in a measure that through thy grace it
may be subdued unto reason and obey it / for in this point also if I pass
measure and bring my body so low that it is un apt to serve my neighbor and
to do that office which is appointed me of god / it shall be imputed unto me
for sin. Let your serving of god be reasonable says ye apostle To. xij. And
thou haste said also by the prophet I require mercy and not sacrifice Osee.
vi. Therefore shall my mouth show forth thy praise / for this oblacion does
honor the / and shows us the way unto thy saving health. My heart is ready
(oh god) my heart is ready / it is ready through thy grace to do all things
which are pleasant unto the: this one thing have I found most acceptable
unto the / that will I offer unto the / that shall ever be in my heart / on that
shall my lyppes ever be harpynge / if thou had desired a bodily sacryfyce I
would surely have given it the / for my heart is ready through thy grace to
fulfill thy will: but in such burnt sacryfyce haste thou no delyght / thou
made the body for ye spirit / therefore seakest thou spiritual things and
not bodily / for thou sayste in a certain place Proverb.xxiij. My son give
thine heart unto me / this is the heart yt pleases the. Let us offer unto the
an heart repenting with sorrow of our fynnes and enflamed with the love of
heuenlye things and then will thou desire no more / for with such a
sacryfyce will thou be content.

A sacryfyce to god is a broken spyryte: a contrite and humble heart thou
shalt not despise (oh god)

A broken spirit and not broken flesh pleases the (o Lord) for the flesh
is broken and vexed because he has not the carnal things that he desires /
or else fealeth in him self such things as he hates. But the spyrite is
broken and vnquyeted for his fault / because he has offended against god whom
he loves. He soroweth ye he has sinned against his maker and redeemer / yt
he has despised his blood / that he has not regarded such a good and
loving father: this broken and sorowynge spryte is unto the a sacryfyce of
most sweet sauoure which notwithstondynge has his confeccyon of most bitter
spyces / even of the remembrance of our sins, for whiles our sins are
gathered together in to the mortar of the heart / and beaten with the pestle of
conpunccyon / and made in to poudre and watered with tears / thereof is made an
oyntemente and sacryfyce most sweet which redolent offrynge thou wylt not
despise / for thou wylt not despise a co^tryte and humble heart. Therefore he
that breaks his stonye heart which is made with the most hard stones of
sin / that he may thereof prepare an oyntmente of repentance in abou^daunce
of tears / not despayrynge of the multitude and greuousnes of his sins / but
humblye offering this sacryfyce unto the: he shall in no wise be despised of
the / for a broken and humble her^ wylt thou not despise oh god. Marye magdalyn
which was a notable sinner made such an ointment: and put it in the
allablaster bore of her heart: she feared not to enter i^to ye Pharesees house,
she humbled her self flat^e before thy fete / she was not a shamed to weep at
thy mele tide / she could not speak for inward sorrow / but her heart melted
in to tears / with the which she washed thy fete / she wypyd them with her
here immedyatlye / ye and anointed them with ointment and ceased not kissing
them. Who ever saw such another thing? ye or who has ever herd of a thing
like unto this? Surely her sacryfyce pleased the well, and was so acceptable
that thou prefarredst it above the Pharise which in his own sight was
ryghtwyse / for it may be gathered of thy words. Luce.vij. that there was so
much dyfference between the ryghtwysnes of marye and the pharesee as there was
dyfference between these: to wash the fete with water / and to wash them with
tears: to kiss one on ye face / and not to cease to kiss the feet: to
anoint the head with oil / and to anoint the fete: with most precious ointment:
ye much more precelled she the pharesee / for he neither gave the water /
kiss nor oil. O great is thy power Lord / great is thy might which declares
it self most cheeflye in sparynge and having compassyon. Now se I well that a
contryte and meke heart thou shall not despise oh lord. And therefore endeavor
I my self to offer such an heart unto y^. Nether is it enough that I say so
outwardely / for thou art a god which searchest our hertes and raynes.
Accept therefore this my sacryfyce: and if it be imperfect / amend thou the
defaulte which only art of power that to do: that it may be a brent sacryfyce
/ all hole enflamed with the heat of thy bounteous cheryte that it may be
acceptable unto the / or at the leest that thou despise it not / for if thou
despise it not / I know well that I shall find favor before the, and then
shall none of thy saints other in heaven or earth despise me.

Deal gentlye of thy favorable benevolence with syon, Let the walls of
Jerusalem be bylte again.

Because it is wreten Psalm.xviij. unto the holy man thou shalt be holy / and
with the innocen shalt thou deal innocenlye, with the pure and chosen shalt
thou do purelye / and with the wicked shalt thou play ouertwarte: I am very
desirous ye all men were saved / and that they should come unto ye knowledge of
the truth: which thing were very necessary for them and also for my profit /
for by their prayers, exortations and examples I might rise from this filthy
sin and be provoked daily to proceed unto better. I beseech the therefore Oh
Lord although I be a sinner / that thou of thy favorable benevolence would
deal gentlye with syon: that the walls of Jerusalem might be bilt again.
Syon is thy church / for syon by interpretacyon sygnyfyeth a tootehyll / or a
place where a man may se far about him. And even so thy church thrughe the
grace of the holy ghost beholds a far of the glory of god according to
the capacyte of this life / and therefore said the apostle. ij. Corynth.iij.
all we with an uncovered face beholding as in a glass the glory of the lord
/ after the same image ar transformed from glory to glory as by the sprete of
the lord.

Lord god how small is thy Church at this day? almost the hole world is
fallen from the, for there are many mo myscreauntes then christen / and yet
among the chryste^ how many are there which forsake worldly things and seek
the glory of the lord? surely ye shall find very few, in co^paryson of them
which are addycte to worldye things / whose god is thyr belie and glory to
their shame and confusyon. Deal gentelye Lord of thy favorable benevolence
with Syon: that it may be increased both in multitude and also in good
living. Behold from heaven and deal gentelye as thou art wont to do: that
thou will send among us the fire of thy charity / which may consume all
our sins. Deal lord according to thy favorable benevolence / and do not
with us after our deseruyng / nether yield thou us again according to our
iniquities / but order us according to thy great mercy. Thou art Lord our
father and redemer / thou art our hope and everlasting helche. Every man
desires goodness of the / if thou give it them / then shall they gather it: if
thou open thy hand all shall be filled with plenty / when thou turnest away
thy face / then are they astonyed: when thou gatherest in their breath then are
they dead and return in to earth. And again when thou brethedst on them /
then are they created anew: and thus renuest thou the face of the earth
Psalm.C. iiij. Lord I pray the what profyt is there in the dampnacyon of so
many thousand men: Hell is filled and thy church does daily decrease. Arise
Lord / why sleapest thou so long? Arise / and dyffer not unto the end /
Deal gently of thy favorable beneuole^ce with Syon / that the walls of
Jerusalem may be builded again / what is Jerusalem (which by interpretacyon
signyfyeth the vysyon of peace) but the holy congregacyon and city of the
blessed which is our mother? Her walls were decayed when Lucyfer with his
angels fell / in to whose places are the ryghtwyse men received. Deal therefore
gentlye (Oh Lord) with Syon / that the number of thy chosen may shortly be
fulfilled / and that the walls of Jerusalem may be edefied and fynisshed with
new stones which shall ever praise the and endure euerlastynglye.

Then shalt thou accept the sacryfyce of ryghtwysnes / oblacyons and burnt
offerynges: then shall they lay upon thine altar wanton calves.

When thou haste dealt gentlye of thy favorable will and benevolence with Syon
/ then shalt thou accept the sacryfyce of ryghtwysnes / for thou shalt
consume it with burning fire of thy love and charity / and so acceptedst thou
the sacrifices of Woyses and Helyas. And then acceptest thou the sacryfices of
ryghtwysnes / when thou fattenest with thy grace the souls which endeavor
them selves to line rightwisly. What profits to offer sacryfices unto the
when thou acceptest them not oh Lord? How many sacryfyces offer we now a
days which are not pleasant unto the but rather abhomynable? for we offer
not the sacryfyces of ryghtwysnes / but our own ceremonies: and therefore are
they not accepted, nor regarded of the, where is now the glory of the
Apostles? where is the valiant perseueraunce of martyrs? where is the fruit of
preachers? where is that holy symplicyte of them that used to live solitarye?
where are now the virtues and works of the christen which were in old time?
Then shall thou except their sacryfices / when thou shall deck and garnyshe
them with thy grace and virtues.

Also if thou deal gently with Syon of thy favorable benevolence / then
shalt thou delyght in sacryfyces of ryghtwisnes / for the people shall begin
to live well / to keep thy commandments and to deal iustlye and so shall
thy people be endued with thy benefytes and blessing. Then shall the oblacyons
of the priests and of the clargie be acceptable unto the / for they shall
forsake their carnal affection and endeavor them selves unto a more perfeyte
life / and so shall the ointment of thy blyssynge descend upon their heads.
Then shall the burnt offerynges of the relygyous be pleasant to the / for
they shall cast out all drousye sluggyshnes and false confydence / and be holy
enflamed and made perfayte with the burning fire of gods love. Then shall
the bysshoppes and preachers put calves upon thyn altar / for after they at
co^summate in all kind of virtue and replenysshed with the holy spirit / they
shall not fear to give their lives for their sheep. What is thine altar sweet
Jesus / but thy cross where upon thou wast offered? What signifies a want on
calfe / but our body? Therefore / then shall they put calves on thine altar /
when they shall offer their own bodies unto the cross / that is, unto all
afflyctions and even unto the very death for thy names sake.

Then shall the church flory she and dilate her coostes / then shall thy
praise be noysed from the last end of the world / then shall joy and gladness
fulfill the hole world. Then shall thy saints rejoice in glory and shall make
mirth in their mancyons waiting for us in the land of the living.
Accomplish in me even now Lord that / then / which I so often name that thou
may have compassion on me according to thy great mercy / ye thou may
receive me for a sacryfice of ryghtwysnes / for a holy oblacyon: for a burnt
sacryfyce of good living / and for a calfe to be offered on thine altar or
cross / by the which

I may pass from this vale of miserye unto that joy which thou have
prepared for them that love the.

Amen.
To fill up the lefe we have touched certain places which we thought most
necessary to edefye the congregation of Christ.
Of faith.
FIrst dear dretherne ye ought to give dylygent head that you may purelye
understand what faith is and what fruits proceed out of her / And to conclude
the sum in few words / faith is a sure perswasyon and full knowledge that
god for his truth and ryghtwysnes sake will fulfill such promyses / as he
has made unto us of his mercy and favor / which sure persuasion must be
given from god. i. Corin.xij. For it can neither be gotten by man's power /
nether yet retained / therefore with fear and trembling perform that health
which is begone in you / for it is god that works in you both the will and
also the deed / even at his own pleasure. And se that with all mekenes ye
submyt your selves unto the vocacion of god / not seking the lyberty of the
flesh / nether yet despysyng good works / for faith does mortefye the flesh
and her works / and the spirit of god which rests in a faithful man
helps our insurmitie and fyghteth without intermission against sin / the
devil and the world.

The power of faith.
THe power of faith is to iustefye us: that is / to dispoyle us from all our
vices and lay them on Christ's back which has pacefyed the fathers wrath
toward us: and to endue us with an others ryhtwysnes / that is Christ's / so
that I and all my sins are Christ's / and Christ with all his virtues are
mine / for he was borne for us and given unto us. Esaye. ix. Roma.viii. To
obtain this ryghtwisnes god the father requires nothing of us but that we
believe in him and make him no liar. He that believes that god of his mercy
has made us these promises and that for his truths sake he will fulfill them /
he sets to his seal ye god is true. But he that believes not or doubts of
this (as much as in him is) he makes him a liar.i. John^ v. for why sholdest
thou doubt in him except thou thoughtest yt he were a liar and would not keep
his pro;mess which he made? Now if thou count God (which is the very
truth) to be a liar / art thou not worthy a thousand dampnacyones.

The work of faith.
Faith works by charity / for when my ragyng conscience which fealeth her
syn^e is pacefied and set at one with God thrughe faith / then remembrynge the
fervent love of god toward me I can not but love my neighbor again / for
there is no man that hertelye loves the father and can hate the sone / and
although the son be naught and vnthriftye yet for his fathers sake he will
help to better him and even lament and be sorye for ye sons wickedness.
Likewise if we hertely love god for his infinyte benefytes done unto us / then
can we not hate yt creature which he has made after his own lykenes / who^ god
the father loves so tenderly yt he gave his own son unto the death to
redeem him / yea and whom he has adopted (through Christ) to be his son and
heir. Now all be it we se no kyndenes in this man for which we should love
him yet has god showed us kyndnes enough for the which we ought to love him
and so coure him at al times. Let us therefore love him for ye love that god his
creatoure has showed us / and bear his infyrmitye / if he faule let us lift
him up again / and endue him with our mysdome and all our works even as
Christ has done with us / and this is an euydent token that thou love god /
when thou love thy brother.i. John^.iiij. and seakest al means to help him
/ these are the good works that follow faith / and are euydent tokens that thy
faith is right and pure. Thus see thou how good works / flow out of faith
through charity / and charity or love is ye fulfilling of yt hole law. To.xiij.

Good works.
Among good works the chyef are: to be obedyente in all things unto kings /
princes / Judges / and such other officers as far as they command ciuyle
things that is to say such things as are indyfferente / and not contrary
unto the commandments of god / for then must we rather obaye God then men /
acts in the first chapitre although we should lose both our substance and life
thereto: To honor rulers: To promote peace: To pray for all comynaltyes. And
to apply al our studyes to profit them.

The next are: to be obedyent unto father and mother: To provide for our
householde both nouryshyng our famylye with bodily sustenaunce / and also to
enstructe them with the word of god / and so to be their governor carnal and
spiritual.

Then must we look how we ought to behave our selves toward our neygh
boures knowlegynge yt all the gifts which are given us of god / are not given
us for our own self but for the edefyenge of the co^gregacyo^.j. Corynth.xij.
and if we bestow them not on that manner we shall surely give a rekenyng for
them before the lord. Emonge these ought we to have respect unto the
preachers and mynesters of the word / that they may be had in honor and
well provided for. And above all things good brethren address your selves
unto that necessary work prayer. Remember to pray for all estates / for yt is
a work that Christ and his apostles full dylygently exhorted all men unto /
promising them that they should obtain their perycyons John^.xvj. also.j.
John^.iij. if they be according to the will of god and for his glory.j.
John^.v.
