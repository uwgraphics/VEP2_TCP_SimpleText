TO THE RIGHT HONORABLE, SIR ROBERT BERTIE, KNIGHT, Lord Willughby, Lord of
Willughby, Berke and Erisby; my most honorable good Patron; all increase of
honor in this life, and eternal happiness in the life to come.
INfinite are the benefits (right Honorable) that God has provided for man;
but amongst them all, the word of God has the preeminence. For howsoever the
fruition of the rest may seem to make a man happy in this life; this, and
only this, does make a man 2. Tim. 3.17

keeping hereof does add Prou. 3.12.

confession of Christ, and faith in him. But that which strikes the veriest
Atheist with greatest consternation; the false worshipper with most
astonishment; and the looker on with deepest admiration, is Isai. 45.21. and
41.21. etc. and 43.12. and 44.7.
the prophetical spirit here to be found, and no where else, truly, plainly
and perfitly setting down before hand, what shall be accomplished afterward
in his due time. Hereby the erroneous have bin often Mat. 22.40. etc.
convicted; and they which Dan. 9.2. etc.
waited upon the Lord singularly directed Est. 4.1^.
and comforted. This spirit which has bin always in the word of God, does
fully show it self in the Revelation. For in it the Lord has written up
before hand, the steps of his providence, by which he would rule the Christian
world, cap. 1.19.
from the time of the Apostles to the last day. Here cap. 13.

that sought to be further satisfied in a scripture of so great use. That which
I have attained unto (seeing the importunity of many godly men has prevailed
with me to publish) upon good reasons, I do humbly present unto your
Lordship. For first, the Lord has so mercifully disposed for me, that both I,
and mine, do live under your Lordships patronage: wherefore I was bound to
make some remonstrance of my thankfulness; and wanting other means I took this
opportunity. Again, I was not only set on work to study this book; but
also much encouraged and holped herein, by your most honorable, wise, learned,
and godly Father my dearest Lord; and therefore was to return the fruits of
my labor to his house. And further, I giving it abroad in the language of my
nation, as a counterpoyson against the shameless frauds of popish seducers;
your Lordships experience affoording you greater satisfaction of the times than
can be known by books, will be a strong retentiue to wauerers, when they see
the relation of the present popish impieties, to be patronized by your good
Lordship. Great and many were the benefits which the Church of God obtained by
the sincere and godly profession of the Gospel, which your Lordships most
honorable ancestors did make. Your Lordships The Duchess of Suffolk.

reported to pray unto God, with lifted hands and eyes unto heaven, that the
Lord would continue her house in honor, to the glory of God, and of the
Gospel of Christ for ever. Your most honorable father, with the blessed sword
of Gedeon, did fight in the defense of the Gospel; and in a sickness, thought
insuperable, stood so resolved in the truth, that he desired none other grave,
than to die in the defense of the Gospel, and of his Queen. Both of them
regarded the Lords Prophets, and them that feared his name, both small and
great. Their virtues have a part in the book of life, in the holy city, and
in the things which are written in this book. Honorable Lord, the love you
bear to the Gospel, and your wisdom in taking to wife a daughter of the true
God, do make demonstration that your Lordship does inherit the virtues of your
most Christian ancestrie. To your Lordship therefore I presume to dedicate this
Treatise. The subject is Scripture, and therefore worthy your hands; the manner
of explaining is somewhat new, a thing that is wont to be desired; the maine
is history, which gives contentment and instruction to the studious. Let the
faithfulness and dutiful affection of the giver, counterpoise the homelines of
the handling. And so I do most humbly take my leave; praying unto God, that
we which honored your Lordships most honorable ancestrie, may still increase
our thankfulness to God, and the joy we take to see your Lordship and all yours
ever abounding in all the blessings of almighty God; and that still of your
Lordship also Christ may say (as now he does) Cant. 6.11.
My soul has set me in the chariots of my noble people.

From my poor house at Halton-Holgate. Your Lordships in all duty and good
affection most humble, William Symonds.

TO THE CHRISTIAN READER.
Dear Christian Reader. As the Prophet Esaias in a case not altogether
different, so may I justly exclaim, Esai. 53.1.
Who will believe our report? and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed* In
the Old Testament the Prophets foretold of MESSIAH, describing the time, place
and manner of his birth, life, passion, death, resurrection and ascension, and
foreshewing that the Builders or chief Rulers of the Church should refuse him
being the head corner stone. The learned Priests, Pharisees and Princes of the
Jews read and studied these Prophecies, having as good means for
understanding them (in all likelihood) as wit and learning could afford: and
yet, as the Apostle says, they fulfilled the voices of the Prophets by putting
Christ to death. And why? they were worldly minded, proud, ambicious, Act. 3.18.
and puffed up with the opinion of their own knowledge, they had corrupted the
truth with their own devices, and in their blind imagination framed unto
themselves such a Messiah, that when the true Christ was come they could not
know him: they expected a great Monarch, that should restore unto them their
earthly kingdom and the pleasures of the world; mean while, they crucified
the true Savior, and fulfilled all things that were written of him. Only a
few fishermen, and certain poor and abject women followed Christ and
believed in him: Psalm. 25.14.
for the secret of the Lord was revealed to them that feared him.

In the New Testament in like manner, Christ and his Apostles foreshew the
coming of the Great ANTICHRIST, they paint him out in his colors, what manner
of one he should be; declaring the time, place and manner of his birth, life,
tyranny, pride, ruin and condemnation; and showing that such as make greatest
show to the contrary, should be the chiefest actors in this tragedy. The
Pope, his Cardinals, his great Prelates and Doctors of all sorts read and
study these Scriptures, and are (to a natural man's conceit) as likely to
attain the true sense of them, as any other: they talk much of the coming of
this Monster, and yet themselves play all the parts in this Tragedy. And why
so? they are as proud as the Pharisees, selfe-louers, ambicious, they have
corrupted the holy Scriptures with the leven of their own doctrine, they have
their fabulous inventions touching Antichrist, so that they cannot know him:
They look for an individual Tyrant, a Jew borne, of the Tribe of Dan, who
shall reign but three years and a half in Jerusalem, and work I know not
what wonders: mean time themselves indeed are that true Antichrist, and have
almost fulfilled whatsoever is written of him. O Lord how unsearchable are thy
judgments, that have sent them strong delusion, Romans 11.33. 2 Thessalonians. 2.11.12.
Revel. 3.10.
that they should believe lies! That all they might be damned which believe
not the truth. Only a few poor and contemned people, which have kept the
word of patience, have been delivered from that hour of temptation.

The Papists wonder at our confidence in this point, and think the Revelation
to be so mystical, that no certainty can be concluded thence. But we wish them,
Revel. 1.3. Matthew. 24.15.
if ever they will enjoy the blessing promised unto the reader of that Book,
that once again they would read and consider; then happily may they learn
that those things are hid from carnal and wicked men, Revel. 1.1. Coloss.
1.26.27.
which are shevved unto the Saints and servants of God: whereupon they may
accuse their own blindness, and examine whether themselves be the servants of
God that see not the hidden mysteries revealed unto the Saints, and cease to
make their gross understanding the rule and square of other men's knowledge.

For my own part, what elsewhere I have written concerning the certainty of
my knowledge herein, I am so far from acknowledging to be rashly spoken, as
that (I thank God) every day I am more and more confirmed therein, as by
sundry other means, so especially by reading this ensuing-Tractate, and often
conference with the Author thereof my loving friend, of whose holy life, grave
and moderate carriage, painfulnes in his ministry, manifold learning and rare
understanding of Prophetical Scriptures, I shall not need to speak any thing
here, least I be thought too partial; N B.
only for thy sake (Christian Reader) I willingly acknowledge that I have
profited and learned more by reading one sheere of this GOLDEN-BOOKE, than ever
I could by all the Interpreters that I read on the Revelation; as thou may
also do, if thou will vouchsafe attentively to read over but the Authors
Preface only with a single eye and docile mind. The Lord direct all thy
studies to the glory of his holy name, and thy own souls health. Farewell.

Thine ever in the Lord, Gabriel Powel.

THE PREFACE, OR INTRODVCTION: WHEREIN THE AVTHOR DOES HVMBLY SVBMIT THESE his
labors unto the godly, and most judicious censure of the right Reverend Father
in God, RICHARD VAVGHAN, Doctor of Divinity and Lord Bishop of London, his
very honorable good Lord.
HOnorable, and right reverend Father, as the mercy of God has alvvaies
abounded toward his Church, in giving her Prophetical Scriptures, as a light
that shines in a dark place: so very seldom have there been wanting godly
Prophets, who by diligent search have so dressed these lights, that they have
shined to all that were about them, for their directions in the greatest
mutations and difficulties. For the most part, until the time of the Apostles,
this kind of study was so frequent and familiar, not only to the good, but
also to the bad; that many times it seemed Elisha was not dead, 2. King. 6.12.
that told the words which the King spoke in his privy chamber. Howbeit,
though never Church had prophecies so particular and plain, as this of Christ
has under the Gospel; yet am I persuaded (I speak at your Lordships
correction) that no age has been so ignorant in the true understanding of such
as concerned their times, as (for of long after the Apostles) the Christian
Church has been. For as all the Prophecies of the New Testament, which are
many, have been esteemed difficult: so this book of the Revelation has been
held impregnable.

Now it is a part of S. Paul's apology to the Elders of Ephesus: Act. 20.27.
I have showed you all the counsel of God. The diduction from thence, binds
all the Ministry to endeavor the like, as well in Prophetical, as Dogmaticall
Scriptures. I have therefore somewhat labored in this kind, but principally
in this book; and that (all praise be given to the Father of lights) to mine
own satisfaction in such sort, as that many godly men have desired to
communicate in my contentment herein.

1. Cor. 14.32.
But the Scripture commands, that the Spirit of the Prophets be subject to the
Prophets; forbidding all to believe, or teach any thing, that will not endure
the censure of the Prophets. The rather ought I to subject that which I have
done herein, unto your Lordships godly and learned censure, as a Father among
the Prophets, because I have labored in this kind, in a different manner from
the rest of the Interpreters. If your Lordship like it, I have enough. If you
correct me, Psalm. 141.5.
where I err, though you smite me I will take it kindly, and when any shall
say unto me, What are these wounds in thy hands? Zach. 13.6.
I will answer, Thus was I wounded in the house of my friends.

For the better direction of your Lordships grave and learned censure, I will
communicate some part of my thoughts herein: for mine affectation of brevity,
and other reasons of consequence, have caused me to suppress many things of
good importance.

When I first took the Book in hand to study it, I saw it was generally
accused by friend and foe, for inextricable hardness. But when I read the text,
and saw the title to be a cap. 1.1.
Revelation, which is the 1. Sam. 2.17.
cleerest and plainest kind of teaching, the cap. 1.2.
Reader to be blessed, and the Book to be cap. 22.10.
unsealed, I durst not object any difficulty to the Book; but began to
inquire how it came to pass, that it was accounted so hard.

The phrase, though strange in appearance, is merely prophetical. The method,
though closely couched, is very Logical. Wherefore the fault must be laid
elsewhere, and not upon the Book, that it seems so dark and difficult.

The reasons of the hardness, upon diligent consideration, I resolved were
these, amongst others.

First, the judgments of men have been of long so forestalled with the
doctrine, that the signs of the latter day Christ's last coming, besides that
they obscure this book, they would have us to break the commandment of
Christ, when many shall say, Luke 21.8.
The time draws near, does enjoin us thus: Follow ye not them therefore. As
also to violate the rule of the Apostle, which is, not to be troubled by any
deceit, 2 Thessalonians. 2.1.2
as if the day of Christ were at hand, till Antichrist have all things
fulfilled upon him, which are written in this Revelation. S. Peter seems to
give the reason, when he shows that the untimely urging of the last coming
of Christ, 2. Pet. 2.3.4.
would be the mother of Atheism.

Dogmaticall, containing certain points of doctrine, handled before more
largely and more plainly in the rest of the Scriptures: which cannot be
affirmed without some advantage to the enemies of the truth; nor without some
misbeseeming imputations to the holy Ghost, by whose direction the book is
written.

Christ: but mistaking the time when to begin, they put the whole story clean
out of joint. Besides, by that project, they commit this absurdity, to say,
that the things which were spoken and done in the ears and eyes of all men in
the time of Christ and his Apostles, were in the time of S. John so closely
sealed, Cap. 5.3.
as that none in heaven, nor in earth, nor under the earth was able to open
them, nor look thereon.



and corruptions of the Church of Rome, are lively described in some parts of
the book, they have also labored to apply all the texts to Rome, which do
contain the description and properties of the enemies of the Church. But
because in the book is also handled of other enemies; besides that the book
is obscured by this course, the enemy is aduantaged that espieth our weakness,
and the prophetical spirit is very much prejudiced; which being more general,
is wronged by restraint.

Sixthly, the Historians, who in the judgments of all men S. John for the heads
of their observations. For the most of them do labor rather to magnify their
Patrones, and to set a glass upon a faction, than to deliver the truth. Hereby
it comes to pass, that he that reads most of them, shall be sure to find
much wearines to the flesh; howsoever he may happily here and there find a
wise and upright sentence.

Seventhly, there has been found no age, till of late, so

Eighthly, some also have not let to blaspheme this kind God has put in his
own and only power; and that no doctrine can be enforced out of Scriptures of
this kind.

Lastly, these things, together with the multitude of books to be read, (which
neither poverty can provide, nor weakness study) and the want of due
conference of this book with the former prophecies, to whom it sends his
reader, I take to be some of the effectual reasons, which have impeached the
labors of many herein.

It remains now that I give an account how I am persuaded that the project,
which I have laid, is the only true and easy means of understanding the
book.

to show the things, cap. 1.1.
which must shortly be done. Whereupon I conclude, THE THINGS DONE ARE THE
BOOK. Wherefore of force it does follow, that the visions may, and only must,
be enlightened, by the careful application of ALL the Ecclesiastical
histories unto them.

to the servants of God. Then must the servants of God tell us what they have
seen, if we mean to know them. And so we despise the judgments of them in
this book, which persecute the servants of God, be they otherwise for learning
as profound as the devil.

the time was at hand of the prophecy. For S. John was to write the things
which were in action, cap. 1.9. cap. 1.19.
at the time of his writing, and the things which were to come afterward.
Wherefore, without all question, the book was to begin when it was first
published.

Upon these three grounds I am bold to conclude, that The book is a perfect
Ecclesiastical history, NB. The argument of the Revelation.
showed to the servants of God, containing whatsoever is material in the
Church, from the time of the being of S. John in Patmos, to the end of the
world. So that nothing of importance can be found in the Christian world,
which may not be referred to some part of this book, as to his proper head;
from whence it is to receive testimony whether it be true or false; and also
such due consideration and censure, that it must be esteemed to be good or bad,
according as the book does judge.

Of which my assertion, I find not any of the Interpreters greatly to doubt;
yet none of the^ (that I know) has attempted to see, how he can make the text,
and all stories of importance so to agree, that the collection of the
mutations, with their causes and effects, may seem worthy the holy Ghost.
Wherefore, though I do acknowledge my self every way the most unfit of all
others; yet rather than it should be undone, I have thought good to guess at
it, as well as God has enabled me, with the small Library, and other mean
helps, which my poor estate would afford me.

Your Lordship may not look here for a perfect Analysis and interpretation of
the whole book; for that is a work for a just and full Commentary, which
here I promise not: but have only minded a general disposing of the text for
the story: and therefore was not to be diligent, either in the preparations to
the visions, or in the Scriptures not yet accomplished. What I think of the
rest not greatly touched here, (as of the first five Chapters, containing the
things which were in hand in the time of S. John, and a preparation to that
which was to follow; what of the sixth and seventh Phials, etc. which import the
confederacy of both religions, against the incursions of the Turks; the great
incredible and fearful stirs that are yet to be between the Romanists and
the godly; and of the division of the Papists among themselves; and what of the
rest of the prophecy, which contains the golden and happy days of the
Church, and the new troubles which shall arise when Antichrist is cast into
hell; of the precise computation of the time, of as many of these things as is
to be made by the power of the text:) I hope it will not be looked for here,
because the nature of this Treatise does not require it: yet happily, by the
blessing of God, may hereafter appear, if none do better prevent me; which I
much desire. That which I say my self, is, that by this project I have bin
able readily to reduce all stories of importance, to their certain heads of
the Revelation: and to see the drifts and devices of many writers, and some
other persons, before I saw the particulars in themselves. And also to guess
truly before hand of the future effects of some things, which, for any thing I
could perceive, were in man's reason to fall out otherwise.

That which I have done, I submit in the fear of God, not only unto your
Lordship, but also unto all such godly Fathers and brethren of the Ministry,
who in the fear of God do handle or regard his word. For the ignorant, as I
do much desire their edification; so I neglect their censures. The scornful
reiections of the malicious and enemy that neglects, and with scoffing
cauils and railings maligneth whatsoever does not make for his fantasy and
partiality, I esteem as such reproves, as I will wear for a garland. As for
the harsh phrase and haste in translations, seeing I seek matter, whether
digested, or congested, the godly will excuse.

That which I would first admonish the diligent Reader of, is this. The book
has a double method. First is set down the drift of God, in disposing the
things of the Church, in the manner which he has done; and this reaches from
the beginning, to the end of the eleventh chapter. Secondly is showed the drift
of the Devil in his proceedings against the Church, in the twelfth and
thirteenth chapters, and part of the twentieth chapter. The rest, to the end, is
an interpretation of such things, as were briefly touched in some former
chapters. In my Treatise I have for shortness and cleerenes joined both the
methods in one, and put the interpretations into the places for which they
serve.

The next thing I would admonish, is, that I have divided this Treatise into
several periods and chapters; not according to the chapters of the book, but
according to the diversity of the mutations. Thirdly, that in gathering of the
stories, I have not tied my self to the whole discourse word for word, for it
would have grown to too great a volume, but have briefed them for case. And
where I think the Authors censure of the times does agree with the text, I
keep it. Where the writer, by ignorance or partiality, does miss in his
discerning, I take the brief of the story, and pass by his opinion,
excepting in some very few places plain enough to be discerned. Furthermore,
where the Historians in their books do follow the succession of years and
persons, I hold it sufficient to name the author, committing the reader to the
easy direction of the year and person: but where any thing might seem
combersome to find, I have bin more plain, giving ready help to such as
have books of the same edition which I followed. Thus leaving my labor not
only to the touchstone, but also to the test, I pray for your Lordships
happiness, and the edification of the Church of God.

Your Lordships most humble in all Christian obedience, William Symonds.

FINIS.
PISGAH EVANGELICA. BY THE METHOD OF THE REVELATION, PRESENting to the public
view, those Canaanites, over whom our Lord Jesus Christ, and his holy Church,
shall triumph after several Battles.
CHAP. I.
The first period containing a Battle in heaven between the Dragon and the
Woman.

THE Revelation contains a cap. 1.1.^. etc.
demonstration of the most glorious and eternal presence of Christ, the
Almighty one, in his Church, by his continual cap. 12.1. etc.
war with the Dragon, the devil, cap. 1.19.
both in the present time, when S. John did write, and also in the time that
succeeded afterward.

In the time of S. John, this fight is said to be in cap. 12.1. etc
heaven, that is, Mat. 13.24. and 25.1.14.
in the Church of Christ, and manifest assembly of the Saints; when the
persecution is directly stirred up against Christ. And this war is described
in the same Genesis 3.15.
words, in which it was first denounced. In this wonderful war we are to
consider, the Battle, and Success. And of the battle, the Enemies and
their Manner of fight; the Enemies, are the party Offendent, and Defendent.

The Defendent, is the universal Church of Christ, shadowed under cap. 1.12.20
the mystery of seven golden candlestickes: For the Church is the Math. 5.14.
light of the world; as the Exodus 25.37.
golden candlestickes in the law, were the light of the Tabernacle. It is also
called new cap. 3.12.
Jerusalem, and the cap. 1.4 11.
seven Churches of Asia. For in the time of S. John, the Churches of Asia, in
a manner, alone did publicly support the profession of the Christian faith.
Wherefore S. John is required to write to them, and in them, to all other
Churches wheresoever. This universal Church is also called a cap. 12.1.
woman, after the Psalm. 45. Cant.
usual metaphor of the scripture.

In her description, we are to consider her ornaments, and childbearing. Her
first ornament is of her apparel, which is said to be glorious as the cap.
12.1.
Sun, having put on the Lord Malac. 4. 2. Esaias, 60.1. Phil. 2.15.
Jesus the son of righteousness. For the Christians did publicly profess
themselves Eusebius. 3. 17. and alibi passim.
to be Christians, which was the only cause of the persecutions.

The next ornament, is her Footestoole, which is said to be the cap. 12.1.
Moon, that is, all mutable and corruptible things; these she trod under
foot, being cap. 2.9.
rich even in poverty. Eusebius. 4. 15. and 8.5, 6, etc.
For the Christians refused life, honor, and riches being offered unto them;
and which some of them inioyed, rather than that they would deny Christ, or
conceal the profession of him.

Her third ornament, is her cap. 12.1. cap. 3.8.10.11
crown, which is said to be twelve stars, that is, the doctrine of the
Lambs twelve Apostles: not Peter's only authority. Eusebius. 4. 14. 21. and 3.
34. and 5. 14.
For the Bishops continually taught those things which they had received of the
Apostles: which also they delivered to the Church, as only true. Sabel. E. 7.
lib. 4.
The manner of the ceremonies was bare and naked, having in them more piety
than pomp. Eusebius. 4. 21.
Then was the Church a virgin; for as yet she was not corrupted with vain
doctrines.

As concerning her childe-bearing, it is said, she was fruitful in the
greatest afflictions. cap. 12.^. and 2.13.
For she was with child; the faithful taking care, to hold fast that only
faith, which they had received and heard, and to spread it abroad by all good
means.

She cap. 12.2.
cries in her travel, by the extremity of her pains, as a woman ready to be
delivered. Eusebius. 4. 3.
For when the persecutions grew extreme, certain learned and godly
Christians, by their Apologies labored to pacify the minds of the Emperors.
Yea the very Eusebius. 3. 30. and 4. 8.
Gentiles, as Pliny and Serenius, wrote in the defense of the innocence of
the Christians, unto the Emperors Traian and Adrian.

The party offendent, is a cap. 12.3.9.
wonderful enemy, the Devil, Satan that old Serpent; or rather a monster
compounded of diverse Serpents; but for the neerenesse of his shape; he is
called a Dragon, meaning the Roman heathen Empire, which by their idolatry
worshipped the Devil. And it is here called a Dragon, that there might be an
allusion to the temples of idols; in Gesner. bib. 5 Volat. lib. 25. f. 300.
which were Dragons worshipped. Eusebius. 5. 1. p. 62. b.
And so the heathen idolatry of the Romans, is here the enemy unto the Church
of Christ. Moreover, because these persecutions were a spiritual Ephesians. 6.12.
warfare, in which the Romans did march against the Christians with spiritual
armies; by a speech taken from their temporal armies, in which the Cohorts
were led by ensigns, Vege^. 2. c. 3.
in which were pictured Dragons, this enemy is said to be the Dragon.

This Dragon is said to be first cap. 12.3.9.
Great, more terrible than those of whom Strabo speaks, which were Strab.
15. p. 479.
80. yea 140. cubits, which may be by reason of his age, which at first was but
a Genesis 3.1.
Serpent. And whereas there is a proverb, Eras. chil. centu. 3.
Except a serpent do devour a serpent, he does not become a Dragon; the
serpent of the Roman Empire, had subdued in a manner, all these countries,
which were held by the former Monarchs, and so became very great. Then, this
Empire being as Ezech. 29.3. and 32.2.
a Dragon amongst other nations, and the Dragon being Isid. etym. 12. cap. 14.
far the greatest of any serpents or beasts, this Dragon must needs be
terrible; both for his nature, and greatness. His color is cap. 12.3. Gesner.
l. 5.
Red; which comes of choler, and the ouerflowing of the gall; to signify his
unappeasable fury and rage in shedding much blood; of which bloody policy and
those which succeeded there, it is said in her cap. 18.24.
was found the blood of the Prophets, and of the Saints, and of all that were
slain upon the earth. For besides the great slaughters the Romans made to
become the Lords of all; and the persecutions by Nero; in the year of our Lord
Anno 74. Carrion. f. 114. Eusebius. 3. 5. 6.
74. Jerusalem was destroyed by Titus. In which, Geneb. p. 490.
eleven hundred thousand perished by sword and famine; one hundred thousand
were openly sold; six hundred were executed. Domitian also, in the year Anno
94.
94. Geneb. p. 492. Abb. Vrsper.
who first of any, commanded himself to be called Lord, and God, required all
of the line Eus. 3.17.
of David to be diligently sought up, and killed; and he put many Christians to
death, persecuting them after the example of Nero. Eusebius. 4. 2. 6.
Traian slew many millians of the Jaws; as also did Adrian.

He has cap. 12.3.
seven heads, Isid. etym. lib. 2. 2.
somewhat representing the Hydra, of which the Poets speak. In all the seven
Churches having Isay 9.15. Deuteronomy. 28.13.
Magistrates to devour the Saints. But they are also said to be seven, cap.
17.9.
because Rome their City was built upon Virg. Georg. 2.
seven hills, Chron. chro.
which were Palatinus, Auentinus, Ianiculus, Caelius, Aesquilinus, Viminalis,
Quirinalis. And also, because it seven times changed the form of government.
Fulke in 17. Apo. f. 99.
First ruled by Kings, 2. Consuls, 3. Decemuiri, 4. Dictators, 5. Triumuiri, 6.
Emperors, 7. Popes and Emperors:

He is crowned with cap. 12.3.
seven crowns upon his heads, like herein unto the Isid. etym. l. 12.
Cockatrice. For every policy had the sovereignty of Kings; the regal power
being in their own hands. Wherefore it is said to the Church, thou cap. 2.13.
dwell where Satan's throne is.

And as the Serpent Isid. etym. l. 12.
Cerastes has eight, so this Dragon has cap. 12.3. Eusebius. 5. 1.
ten horns, both to allure his pray; and also to push the seven Churches,
and all other that stand in his way. But they are ten; because the Roman
Legion consisted of Veg. l. 7.
ten Cohorts. And in the Apostles time, the countries subject to the Romans
were ruled by ten Strab. Geog. 17.
Princes, which were called Decharchae. The manner of the fight is diverse, as
are the enemies.

The Church does fight with cap. 2. and 3.
patience, with tears, and prayers, for the Eusebius. 3. 33. and 4. 15.
Saints did very willingly both manifest themselves, and offer themselves to
all exquisit torments, which were devised by the persecutors.

The manner of the fight of the Dragon is, first with his tail, for with cap.
12.4.
his tail he drew the third part of the Stars, and cast them unto the earth,
that the Job. 3.6.
night might be black and cursed, wherein the child of the woman should be
borne. And here has this Serpent, the property of the true Dragons, who have
more force in Isid. Etym. l. 12. cap. 4.
their tails, than in their jaws. By the tail, is signified the false Esaias
9.15.
prophet that speaks lies: and they which do turn other to righteousness,
do Dan. 12.3.
shine as the Stars in the firmament. Now in these times, partly by the
instigation of the devil, partly by ambition or fear of persecution, Eusebius.
3. 23. 24. 25. 26. and 4. 7. etc.
very many became heretics; and these were so much esteemed of the Romans,
that they set up Eusebius. 2. 13. 14.
a pillar in Rome, in honor of Simon Magus, the most impious and abominable
father of all heretics, with this inscription, To Simon the holy God. These
heresies principally sprang up in the East, the third part of the Empire, and
poisoned it with the heresies of Menander, that more pestilently continued Aug.
de hares^ cap. 1.2.
the blasphemies of Simon Magus: against the creation of the world, incarnation
and passion of Christ for idolatry etc. Ebion, Cerinthus, Nicholaus, Basilides
etc. which increased the former heresies, with new impieties Eusebius 4. 11. 14.
even at Rome. Besides, there were many that devised Eusebius. 3. 22. and 4. 11.
books, which they called, and obtruded to their hearers, as Scriptures, full
of vain and perverse, and ungodly doctrines. As also they forged books, under
the names of godly men, as of Eused. 3.35.
Clement, to induce the world to think, that such also favored their heresies.
Moreover, Epistola. Plini. apud. Foxum. Martyrologio. p. 39.
by the persecutions, many returned to idolatry, these did very seruilely
follow the Princes, that persecuted the Christians. For the Eusebius. 3. 29. and
4. 15.
Jews, heretics, and priests of the Gentiles, did continually accuse the
Bishops, and called importunately to have them sought up and martyred. For
(said they) they are the fathers of the Christians. These were always ready to
provide matter for their torment, and execute whatsoever might bring the
Bishops and other Christians to their martyrdom. Yet did there step up two for
one, so that but a third part were cast down.

He cap. 12.4.
stood before the woman, which was ready to be delivered; that she might
keep in her birth, or miscarry in her delivery.

He gapeth, to devour her child, when she had brought it forth. A very
fearful sight, he being of that sort of Dragons, which Gesn. li. 5.
gape the widest of any kind of beast, and has three orders of teeth in a
iawe, the more easily to devour his pray. And as he is fearful to behold, so
is he rauenouse, as the Dragons of India, which lie in wait for their cattle
coming from their feeding, and do much harm, oftentimes they kill the
Heardsmen, and thence provide themselves of a large meal; Yea, it sometimes
comes to pass, that a Dragon does draw the Indian, that hunteth him, into
his den, with his weapons and all, and deuoureth him; shaking in a manner the
whole mountain, in which he lodges, with his force and noise. Unto these
sorts of Dragons are these tyrants compared. Eusebius. passim.
For the Emperors proclaimed severe, fearful, and bloody laws against the
Christians; commanding that none should profess Christ; and if any were
converted he should be killed, yea, Eusebius. 5 19.
that whosoever of the Christians were brought to the judgment seat, he
should not be let go, except he changed his mind. Domitian, after the example
of Vespasian, hunted after all that were of the line of David, and persecuted
the Christians; Fox Mar. ex Epistolis Traiani. and plinij.
Traian commanded the Christians to be killed; which was done, without
distinction of age, or sex; Bergom. lib. 8.
so that daily innumerable thousands were slain: Adrian resolved to root out
the Christians, under whom suffered very many. In Rome were martyred ten
thousand, two hundredth and three, etc.

Notwithstanding the success is prosperous on the woman's behalf, as it was
cap. 2.7.11.17.28. and 3.5.10.12.21.
promised, for her fruit is borne and preserved.

She brought forth a cap. 12.5.
man child: These latter Churches, as far excelling the former in courage,
and strength, and masculine vigor, as a man excels a woman.

Of this child it is said, he shall rule all nations with a rod of iron,
prevailing in the end; and ruling with justice till all things be put in
subjection under his feet.

For upon the death of Domitian, Eusebius. 3. 18. 20.
Narna called home al exiles. S. John coming from Pat^tes, planted new
Churches, and strengthened the old. As also upon the intermission of Traian,
Eusebius. 3. 34.
many godly men went abroad, and did the work of Evangelists, preached to such
as never heard of Christ. They laid the foundation of faith in new and strange
places, and appointed Pastors there, etc.

And that her child was taken up unto God, and to his throne, The Lord causing
the Prou. 8.15.
Princes to decree justice, for the preservation of his people, himself being
Psalm. 82.1.
judge amongst the Gods. For Eusebius. 4. 9.
Adrian decreed, that those of every Province should accuse the Christians, if
they did commit any thing against the Empire; but if any did traduce them
without cause, the accuser should be punished with just revenge. As also Anno.
149.
Antoninus Pius Eusebius. 4. 12. 13.
moved by the Apology of Iustine, wrote about the year 149. that the
Christians are not to be molested, except they attempted any thing against the
Empire; and that he that did otherwise trouble them, should bear the
punishment, which he would have inflicted on the Christian; but he that was
accused should go free.

And as for the woman, the Church, she escaped the danger by flight, cap. 12.6.
for she fled into the wilderness, and Isay 43.20. and 44.3.
was mingled among the heathen Eusebius. 5. 19. and 8.1.
Princes, and Gentiles, and heretics, where she has a place prepared of God,
as the Church of the Jews, was directed to her place in the wilderness, by a
pillar of fire, etc. both for her safety and that they should feed her there
1260. days: that is 1260. years. Soc. 1. 17.
For a little before the times of Constantine, a counterfeit religion,
shadowing the rites of the gentiles, was mixed with true christian religion;
not otherwise then false prophets that arise amongst the Prophets, and false
Apostles among the Apostles. So that from hence, 1260. years, the Church is
mingled with the wicked; and is safe amongst them; and lives at their costs.
Besides that, Isid. Etym. lib. 8. cap. 5.
upon those persecutions, many fled into the Mountains, separated from the
wicked, where they were safe and fed the Lord knows how.

The end of the first period, and battle in heaven, which was in hand when
Saint John did write.
CHAP. II.
The second period, containing a second battle in heaven, between the man
Child of the woman, and the Dragon.

WHen the troubles of the Church were over, which were in hand when Saint John
did write; the Lord did cap. 4.2. Psalm. 156.1. and 76.2.
erect his throne openly in heaven, by a manifest government of his Church in
the world. So that now the truth of that Tabernacle is amongst the Christians,
whereof the Jews in the wilderness Heb. 9.8.9.
had the type, and figure for the present time; Heb. 8.2.
even that true Tabernacle which God has pitched and not man. Then the
Christian Churches have Mount cap. 14.1.
Sion, the Heb. 12.22. 1. Cor. 3.17.
Temple, and in it cap. 7.15. Heb. 4.16.
the throne of grace, or mercies-seate; and hereupon cap. 4.4.
the Lord sitting, having Psalm. 93.1.

also are the thrones of the house of David, even the thrones of judgment Heb.

Here also are the seven Lamps, the holy Ghost; which enlightneth every one

shadows; and therefore our Tabernacle has neither veil nor covering, nor
boardes to enclose it, but stands erected openly in the world, under heaven.

Hereupon the cap. 12.7.3.
Dragon, the devil begins new wars, in heaven and in earth:

There was a great battle in heaven, that is, in those places of the world
where the Gospel of the Matthew. 13.19.24.
kingdom of heaven was publicly professed.

Of this battle, we are to consider the enemies, their manner of fight, and
the success.

The enemies in this battle cap. 12.7.
are Michael, and his Angels, which fight against the Dragon and his Angels:

By Michael is meant the cap. 14.1. Dan. 12.1.
lamb Jesus Christ, fighting by the man child which the woman brought forth;
that is, the godly learned and valiant Christians, which sprung up of the
doctrine of the Apostles, when the Church had peace after the first troubles.

The first seal.
The cap. 6.1.
manner of the fight is so wonderful, that one of the Cherubines does call, as
with the voice of thunder, to all men to come and see both him and his
furniture, to this war.

Wherefore first Saint John does cap. 6.2.
behold, and lo a white horse, Psalm. 68.13.14
white for honor, and a horse for Zach. 1.10.
speed.

He cap. 6.2.
that sat on him had a bow with Psalm. 45.5.
sharp arrows, to pearce the hearts of men, by the preaching of the Gospel,
and spreading of it by word and writing. For the learned men of that time did
labor Eusebius. 4. 14. 18. 20. 21. and 26. 28. and. 5. 9. etc.
by preaching, and wrote diverse treatises: some of instruction in the points of
religion; others of confutation, both of the gentiles and heretics.

cap. 6.2. Psalm
A crown is given unto him to reign in the world. For when Eusebius. 8. 1.
as by the grant of Adrian, and the royal commandment of Antoninus Pius, the
crown was set upon the head of Christ, the Gospel spread abroad very speedily,
and with much glory getting honor and estimation amongst all men; as well
Greeks as Barbarians. The Christians governed in principal offices amongst
the nations. They with their families most familiarly did triumph of the
profession of their faith, even in the palaces of Princes. Bishops were in most
high estimation and price amongst all men. Very populous were the assemblies of
the professors, and every day the places for their congregations were made more
large; all things prospered and increased; in a word, they were happy days.

And being thus furnished, cap. 6.2.
he rides forth conquering that he might overcome. Eusebius. 5. 19.
For the doctrine of salvation, did subdue the minds of all sorts of men, unto
Ibm.
the holy religion of one the God of all.

Now these things were intolerable to the devil; by nature enemy to every good
thing, and envious thereat. cap. 12.7.
And the Dragon, by the Roman Empire as yet heathen; and his Angels both
Princes or Proconsuls, with the people and heretics, etc. did war against
him that sat upon the horse.

The Emperors like the bloody Dragon the devil, did often times move very
extreme persecutions. Geneb. p. 508. p 519. Eusebius. l. 4. and Carrion.
For after Marcus Aurelius the philosopher; monsters held the Empire to
Constantines time. This Marcus with his colleague Verus, moved persecution.
After them Seuerus, and Aurelius opposed themselves against Christ, commanding
that none should become a Christian under a grievous pain. Maximinus
persecuted the Doctors, Bishops, and other chief professors: Decius was a most
cruel firebrand: Valerius a bloody persecutor: Aurelianus a grievous
adversary: Dioclesian in the East, and Maxentius in the West, stirred up most
barbarous persecutions against the Church, which sincerely professed Christ:
Eusebius. 4. 15. and 5. 1.
For after innumerable torments and kinds of death, they would not suffer the
godly to be buried; but after their bodies had lain for every body to gaze
upon, some were eaten with dogs; some burned, and their ashes cast into
rivers, etc.

There sprung up also innumerable heretics, b as false Eusebius. 4. 21. 27. and
5. 15. 13. etc.
Christ's, false Prophets, false Apostles; whom the enemy of the Church of God,
hating good and loving evil, omitting no means or opportunity to lie in
wait to hurt man, raised up. These, not only divided the unity of the
Church, with perverse doctrines, against God, his Christ, and all godinesse:
but also were violent, and double diligent to bring the godly into persecution,
and to execute torments up on them. Among these was Eusebius. 4. 37. and 5. 2.
Tatianus, a violent enemy of the scriptures. His Disciples at Rome teach,
that the scriptures are dark and hidden. They despise the Prophesies, etc. and
believe a maid that was possessed with the devil; they teach that every one
is to be left to himself, and believe as he list. Montanus also, whose
doctrine was spread at Rome, Eusebius. 5. 13. 14. 16.
ambitious of the Primacie, esteemed certain women prophetesses, which
prophesied lies. He taught to dissolve marriages, prescribed laws of fasting,
called Pepuza Jerusalem, to cause all to depend on his Synagogue there; under
the name of oblations, exacted money to feed the bellies of his preachers;
wrote a catholic epistle after the example of the Apostle, striving for new
doctrine. The August. de haeres. cap. 16.
Herecleonites, which are reported, as it were to redeem such as were dying

Virgin Mary.

Eusebius. 7. cap. 30.
Manes took upon him to represent Christ, when he was of a barbarous speech
and condition; he Socra. 1. 17.
abrogated the law and prophets, and called himself the holy Ghost. He
published a book called the Gospel; in his epistles writes himself Apostle,
D. Ponet. apol. p. 103.
digesteth his new doctrine in a book which he calls Epistola fundamenti,
where unto he requires like credit to be given as to the Gospel.

His Aug. de haere. cap. 46.
Electi, or principal teachers, were forbidden flesh, eggs and milk; he
condemns marriages, use the women for lust, not conception, etc. S^cra. 1. 17.
The arguments of his books in word pretend the Christian religion; but
indeed it smells of gentilisme. He used many impostures of sorcery. Such
like were many others.

As Michael, unto whom none can be compared, had Angels or godly ministers,
that soundly and painefully confuted the heretics: so did he cap. 6.3.
wonderfully war against the civil Princes. For he sent Ezech. 5.16. and
14.21.
forth his four great plagues as occasion best served, to avenge himself by
them, of his enemies: namely, the sword, famine, pestilence, and beasts.

For the better effusion of blood, The second seal. cap. 63 4.
he sent forth so wonderful means, that another Cherub says, come and see,
which is a red horse. A horse for speed, and red for bloodshed; so that there
were very ready occasions for effusion of blood.

This horse had a rider, unto whom power was given to take peace from the
earth; to bring in war, sedition, and dissension, that they should kill one
another.

Unto this rider was given a great sword; that is very effectual instruments,
for the more speedy and cruel effusion of blood; by mutual murders and
wars. For only Geneb. p. 505. and 513.
Antoninus Pius of the Emperors, was without civil blood. But from the time of
Comodus his son, treasons, and seditions were always among the Princes; when
as from Augustus to that time the Empire had been free from sedition. The
armies or legions, which before time Polyb. l. 6.
were gathered of the chiefest sort of people; even of Rome; were Melanct. l.
3. in Comodo.
now taken of barbarous nations. The ancient military discipline was
extinguished; the rapine and lust of the Magistrates and soldiers grew
extreme, in all the provinces.

And besides this civil sedition, some of them were slain by war. For
Decius Geneb. Carrion. etc.
was killed by the Goths; Valerius was slain by Sapor King of Persia, yea
some had their bane otherwise. For Aurelianus was stricken dead with lightning.

The third seal. cap. 6. 5. 6.
He also pursued them, as opportunity best served, with so wonderful famine;
that another Cherub cries come and see. To this purpose he sends forth A
black horse, a horse for speed, and black for unseasonable times, and for
blastings, and mildewes, which make the corn of a black color.

His rider delights in famine. For he that sat on him had balances in his
hand: Leuit. 26.26.
not only to deliver out i bread by weight according to the curse in the law;
but also to sell that corn by small waights which was wont to be sold by
measures.

The price also grows excessive. A Weckerus Ant. speci.
Choenix, which contains about thirty six ounces, and was a man's allowance
for a day; is sold by the commandment of God and his Christ, by a voice in
the midst of the four beasts, or Cherubins, for a Roman penny, answering
Budaeus.
to the Atticke of Ephesus, which was the sixth part of an ounce, near tenno
pence sterling. For when the Eusebius. 9. 7.
tyrants in their decrees for persecutions, did triumph in the fruitfulness of
the earth, God sent his plague: for the accustomed winter showers did not water
the ground, and so there came an unlooked for and sudden famine. Eusebius. 8. 19.
When Maxentius played the tyrant at Rome, his subjects did suffer most
extreme penury of necessary sustenance: and that so great as never was in
Rome before. Eusebius. 9. 8.
And when Maximinus made havoc of the Churches in the East, the inhabitants
of his cities were in manner consumed with famine. One measure of wheat was
sold for 2500. Atticke, that is Roman pence; but we read of no dearth of
cap. 6.6.
wine or oil.

The fourth seal.
Moreover as occasion served, the lamb sent forth against his enemies, that
would not have him reign over them, the plague of pestilence, and beasts; and
this so cap. 6.7.
wonderful, that the fourth beast or Cherub does say, come and see. To this
purpose is seen cap. 6.8.
A pale horse. A horse for speed, and pale for the discoloring of such as
were smitten by it, with palenes and wannes of face.

His name that sat upon him was death, so Ierem. 9.21.
that death came up into the windows, and entered into the palaces by
pestilent aires, to destroy the children without, and the young men in the
streets. There being help to be found, no not in friends or kinsefolkes.

Hell, or the grave followed after as footmen, and showed his severity in
refusing to give harbor, or lodging to the dead. Ierem 9.22.
The carcasses of men lying as the dunge upon the field. For under Galienus
Eusebius. 7. 21.
there was an universal plague over the world; but especially about
Alexandria; insomuch that every man refused to help his friend.

Under Dioclesian, the Eusebius. 8. 7.
Lions, Panthers, Bears, etc. unto whom the Christians were cast to be
devoured, left the Christians, and ramped on them which stood without,
provoking them to seize upon the Christians, and slew many of them. But Eusebius.
9. 8.
under Maximinus was the greatest pestilence of all; the people died in the
streets in great multitudes; the dogs eat many of them half dead; their
carcasses lay naked, open, and unburied; a most lamentable spectacle to those
that beheld it.

And as Michael the lamb with his Angels do fight, that he might overcome; so
did the Dragon and his cap. 12.7.8.
Angels fight that they might prevail, and keep their places of idolatry and
superstition.

The Dragon does war cap. 12.10.11.
first by accusing the brethren, and then by shedding their blood.

Many grievous accusations were laid to the charge of the Christians; first
that Eusebius. 3. 17.
Christ was King, and so would dispossess Princes. Then Epiphanius.
where as some heretics did use women in common, eating horrible meats (as
young children and women's menstrues, etc.) the Eusebius. 4. 7^.
same things were objected to the faithful Christians. Yea the tyrants in
their edicts published Eusebius. 9. 5. 7.
very blasphemous accusations against Christ and Christians. They slaundered
the Christians, that when they assembled to their Sabbaths, under the color of
serving God, they polluted themselves with promiscuous whoredoms. That the
iniquity of the Christians was the cause of the famine, earthquakes, war,
and mortalities, and that the heathen gods did thereby revenge the indulgence
of the Princes toward the Christians. Of these, and such like slanders they
write books, which they give to the schoolmasters, to teach their scholars.
As also they hang them up upon pillars in all public places, to be read of all
men. Yea they forbade Polychro. lib. 4. f. 169.
any man that would not sacrifice to their idols, to buie, or sell, or take up
water.

Besides their slanders and disgraces, they added hereunto most barbarous
persecutions, Massaeus 10. P.p. 131. 133.
determining and commanding to root out the Christians. The Churches in many
places were Eusebius. 8. 2.
pulled down, and the scriptures burnt and destroyed. Yea, Geneb. p. 543
Polych. 4. c. 25.
in one night, twenty thousand Christians were burned, as they were assembled
in the Church: seauenteene thousand died of most horrible and unnatural
torments, in the space of thirty days. Every Eusebius. 8. 6. 7. 10. 12. and in
alijs suis libris.
one was the more esteemed for his wisdom and observance to his Prince, by how
much he was able to devise and execute torments most barbarous, unnatural,
horrible, and painful: they spared no sex, nor age, nor regarded any persons
of honor, nor affinity, nor consanguinitie. Then was there no place of
refuge, The fifth seal. cap. 6.9 11.
nor time of resting from these tyrannies.

Yet is the success happy for the Saints, who got the victory, and triumph:
and Cap. 12.8.9.
miserable to the Dragon and his angels, whose place was no more found in
heaven, but he was cast out even into the earth, and his angels were cast out
with him.

The victory is first begged of God, and then executed. Those which obtain
the victory, get it by deprecation, and are said to be the cap 6.9.
souls, that is, Genesis 9.4. Numb. 9.4. Leuit. 17.14.
the persons and carcasses, of them that had been killed for the word of God,
and for the testimony which they maintained; to wit, the martyrs which 2. Tim.
4.6.
were killed, or offered, so that Leuit. 4.34.
their blood seemed to be poured at the foot of cap. 11.2. Exodus 21.14.
the Altar, being slain in the place of Gods most immediate and sincere
worship, for the Gospel and profession of Jesus Christ; of whom is spoken
before.

They cry Genesis 4.10. Heb. 11.4.
aloud for vengeance, being slain, as Abels blood did cry against his
brother Caine.

They are honored with white robes; which were given them: every Eusebius. 5. 2.
godly man esteeming honorably of them, that they were counted worthy to
suffer rebuke for the Lord Jesus Christ. Yea they also were honored with the
victory over their persecutors. For howsoever the estate of the Christians in
the former troubles was very desperate; yet the Martyrs by the power of Christ,
did so constantly endure all the torments of their persecutors, that they
overcame them cap. 12.11.
by that word of their testimony, in that they loved not their lives unto the
death. Eusebius. 8. 12. 13
For when the tyrants had made proof of all kind of torments, and were not
able to augment their tortures, they dispaired in themselves, as not hoping to
prevail by that course. Then grew they weary with killing them, and were
glutted with blood. They also, by reason of certain wise and just Apologies,
which the Christians published in the defense of the flock of Christ; feared
least the Princes should justly incur a publik note of infamy for the
barbarous effusion of innocent blood. And so the persecution did slack.

Thus the victory being obtained at the hands of God, The sixth seal. cap.
6.12. etc.
it was presently pursued with diligent execution, by the Lamb now thoroughly
angered.

To which purpose there was a great earthquake, that is a Isai, 24.17.18.19.20.
Joel, 2.20.
general doubtful tottering in the minds of men, not knowing what to settle
upon. Which grew by reason that Ann. 311.
Constantinus the son of Constantius, who favored the Christians, was
saluted Emperor. Then Abb. Vrsp.
was there a great motion in the Christian world. The common wealth was held by
four new Emperors, which had every one their drift to be the chiefest; which
caused the people to be infinitely distracted. Besides that, others Mussaeus.
p. 132.
sought partly by treason to take away Constantine, as Maximinianus; partly by
the soldiers to place themselves, as Valens in the East, and Alexander at
Carthage: yea the Romans Vrsp. p. 79. Massaeus.
were so perplexed with the tyranny of Maxentius, that they called to
Constantine for relief.

By the stirring of Constantine, the Princes were distressed and confounded, as
if the Sun were cap. 6.12.
as black as sackecloth of hair, and the Moon was all made like blood: so
Amos. 8.5. Joel. 3.15.
that their days were uncomfortable, and in the night they were in fear to be
slain. For his Eusebius. 8. 14. and 9.9.
coming offended Maximinianus much, and his proceedings made Maximinus sad;
Maxentius was also in exceeding fear, that he durst not go out of Rome gates.

The Nobles and Isai. 13.10.13. and 7.2.
principal ministers of estate, such as loved the works of darkness, fell
from their places of eminency, as cap. 6.13.
if the stars of heaven fell to the earth, and so violently were they moved
out of their places, as a fig tree casts her green figs, when it was
shaken of a mighty wind.

The public face of Isa. 34.4. Agg. 2.22.
religion was altered; as if the heaven departed away like a scroll, when it is
rolled. For Constantine Eus 9.9. and de vita Constable. passim.
restored liberty to the Church, and by his edicts with Licinius assent,
decreed a most perfect law for the Christians, commanded all nations to become
Christians, and shut up the temples of idols.

The civil policy was also changed, as if the cap. 6.14.15 16.17.
mountains and Isles were moved out of their places; whereupon all sorts of
men hid themselves, and grew desperate; fearing that the Christians would
revenge the persecutions which were formerly inflicted on them. For in Melanct.
li. 3.
Constantines time was one of the greatest and most principal mutations, that
have been in mankind. He Geneb. p. 547.
extinguished Dioclesian, who called himself the brother of the Sun and
Moon, and would be worshipped as a God, and Poly. Inue. 4. 9.
caused the commons to stoop to kiss his feet. He destroyed Maximinianus,
Maximinus, Maxentius, all tyrants. He Eusebius. 9. 9. 10. 11.
rendered due vengeance upon the heads of such great men, who were the
principal agents in the persecutions of the Christians. As upon Pencetius,
whom they called Honorable; Culcianus, whom they styled Worthy; Theotecnus,
whom they named Glorious. He also plagued with infamous torments, the kinsemen
and children of the tyrants; but especially the inchaunters and priests of the
idols. Yea, he subjected Eusebius. vit. Constable. lib. 1. 4.
unto his Empire all the west countries, to the great ocean; all Scythia, even
to the very north; Aethiopia, toward the south; and the Lords and Earls, as
far into the east as the Indians. He restored good Melanct. li. 3.
laws and judgments; decreed that the Christians should not only not be
hurt, but also that they should be admitted to honors.

Thus the victory being gotten and pursued, there follow great triumphs in
cap. 12.10.
heaven, that is openly. The Saints did Eusebius. 10. 1. 2. 3. 4.
publicly rejoice in the Lord their redeemer; and did sing new songs unto God
of thanks giving. And Constantine Eusebius. vit. Constable. 1. 33.
entered Rome with great triumph, presently giving thanks to the author of his
victory, and by famous inscriptions upon pillars in the principal places of
Rome, published unto all men the sign of Christ his salvation. Yea, Geneb. p.
556.
he required all nations to forsake idols, and embrace the profession of Jesus
Christ by his edicts; whereupon was fulfilled that in the Apocalypse. Now is
come salvation in heaven:

And thus was the Dragon and his Angels, that is, the devil and his ministers
cap. 12 9.10.
cast into the earth, so that his place was found no more in heaven; that is,
he does persecute Christ no more openly; but is constrained to oppose himself
by earthly policies, by the pretense of godliness. This fall of the Dragon did
Eusebius. vit. Con. l. 3. cap. 3.
Constantine express in a picture which was hanged up at the entry of his
palace, for every man to behold. His own picture was made, over his head the
sign of the Lords passion; the enemy and hostile beast, which by the tyranny
of wicked men had persecuted the Church of God; was pictured, cast into a deep
sea in the shape of a Dragon, and winding serpent (meaning the devil) which
Esaias. 27.1.
was thrust through with a great sword.

The end of the second period and battle in heaven, which was the first after
the time of the return of Saint John from Patmos.
CHAP III.
The third period and first battle on earth, between the Roman Empire
corrupted with heresy, and the Woman the Church.

NOw when cap. 12.9, 12.13.
the Dragon saw that he was cast down into the earth, and his Angels with him;
he is full of wrath, knowing that he has but a short time, Wherefore he
disposes himself, to bring woeful calamities, both upon the earth and the sea
(in which he had many of his Angels) if by that means he might also further
the execution of his wrath against the woman. For he drifteth the destruction
of the Church. In the story whereof, Saint John does show his purpose and
endeavor.

His purpose is by four of cap. 7.1.
his Angels, to stay the four winds, that they should not blow on the earth,
nor on the sea, nor on the trees: that is, to restrain Can. 4.16.
the inspiration of the holy Ghost, that men, neither Genesis 6.12.
near nor Isocr. 42.10.
far off, neither such as be worldly, nor such as seem Luc. 23.30.
by their vocation and profession to be godly, might be led into all truth. By
which means he would bring in That cap. 3.10.
hour of temptation, which should come upon all the earth; to try them that
dwell upon the earth, whether (now that the Princes were converted to the Lord)
the Princes and people Deuteronomy. 13.3.
would love the Lord their God, with all their heart, and with all their soul.
For about this time many Eusebius. vita. Constable. lib. 3. cap. 62. and 2. 61. 64.
Socr. 1. 4. Ruf. 1. 5. etc.
damnable heresies were powered into the world; namely the Arians, Maniches,
Nouatians, Valentinians, Marcionires, Paulians, Cataphrigians, etc. These Berg.
in Milchiad. etc.
rent in pieces the Churches in Rome, Africa, in the sea coaste, yea every
where.

This purpose of the Dragon is stayed a while; but the visions of this first
battle are seen afterward. The person that does cause the stay to be made,
is an cap. 7.2.
Angel which came up from the east, that is, the recalling of the doctrine,
which first was declared in the East; namely the promise made to Abraham,
whereunto the law was a schoolmaster; which was taught by the prophets,
exhihited to the Jews in Christ, and spread abroad in the world by the
Apostles. For salvation is of the John 4.22.
Jews. For when the Empire was torn in pieces, by diverse heresies, and
contararie factions; the Emperor Eusebius. de vit. Constable. 2. 65.
Constantine sent abroad his edicts, to stay any further contention; declaring
that the true light of discipline, and holy religion, by the mercy of
almighty God, did come out of the East; the professors whereof he respected,
as captains of the nations, unto salvation. The end of the stay, is till the
cap. 7.3.9.
servants of God be marked; some openly, as in their foreheads; others by the
doctrine they do maintain. For Constantine required all men to surcease from
strife; Till by a general Council all things might be determined according to
the word of God, which came out of the East.

Those which are marked in their foreheads are such which are known and noted
to come forth into public action; and are called cap. 7.4.
the twelve tribes of Israel, being resembled unto them which contended with
the Cananites for the land of promise. For these also contend with these
unchristian Cananites, for the true doctrine and means of salvation promised
by Jesus Christ.

Those who are sealed according to the doctrine which they keep; and with
which they worship the Lord in the secret of the Almighty, Psalm. 91.1.
are a cap. 7.9.10.
multitude which no man could number of all nations, and kindreds and people,
and tongues; like holy, and these ascribe all salvation unto our God that
sits upon the throne; and to the Lamb. Eusebius. 10. 4. and de vi. Con. 2. 19.
For the people lately redeemed from the former persecutions, praised God the
King, and Christ the only Savior. Yea, the Emperors did acknowledge thus
much, writing it on pillars to be read.

The seventh scale open.
After the sealing of the servants of God, followed the emotions which are
comprehended in the seventh seal, which the Lamb opens. In the declaration
whereof, first is set down the universal disposition of all, to bring into
action, and to behold the visions. And this is a cap. 8.1. Eusebius. vit. Con. 3.
10. 11.
grave silence, both in the preparation and expectation of that which should
follow.

Secondly, the instruments which are to bring about these troubles are seen;
and are said to be cap. 8.2.
seven Angels with seven trumpets. For the future alterations were to be
wrought by the diversity of doctrine and persuasions which should induce men
to stirs.

In the third place is showed the principal matter which is to be the argument
of the troubles, that these trumpeters should sound, which is concerning the
doctrine of the mediation of Christ, which while some should labor to
maintain precisely according to the doctrine of the East, and others should
corrupt; much trouble would arise in the world.

The mediation of Jesus Christ, is presented by an cap. 8.3.
other Angel differing from the four Angels which were to hold the winds, as
also from the seven trumpeting Angels. The thing he presents, is the readiness
of Jesus Christ, to make reconciliation between God and man. For he stoods
before the altar of incense which was before the throne; having a golden
censor, as the Leuit. 16.
priest in the law was prepared to make reconciliation between God and the
people. By this is signified the readiness Eusebius. vit. Con. 3. 13.
of Constantine, and all godly Bishops at the Council of Nicea, to hear with
patience, and to understand in sincerity, and to judge with truth the
questions and differences which were made in that time.

Hereof, first the godly make a good and religious use; for by them much cap.
8.3.
odors was given unto him, Romans 12.1. Psalm. 141.2.
that is, reasonable services and petitions; to offer with the prayers of all
Saints; that is, that every man labored for an Eusebius. vi. and 3. 16. 18. and
4.36.
unity and to be made members of the universal Church, as it was required
according to the prescript of the word of God.

The effect hereof is an universal reconciliation and peace both in heaven
with God, and in earth amongst men, the cap. 8.4. Leuit. 16.2.13.
smoke of the odors going up out of the Angels hand, before the presence of
God. For in the Council of Nicea (which Caranza.
was held, Constantine being Augustus, and Licinius Caesar) there was Eusebius. de
vit. Con. 3. 16.
diligent inquiry into all things, till there was pronounced a sentence,
pleasing and acceptable to God, that beholds all things, for the concord and
consent of the minds of men. And that so, that there was nothing (that seemed)
leaft to breed any matter of discord, or controversy of faith. In this
Council was Caranza f. 37. b. and 39. ^.
acknowledged the necessity of confessing the Godhead of Christ, against
Arius. As also the heresies of Photinus, Sabellius, etc. were condemned.

Again, when new contentions did arise, cap. 8.5.
this Angel fills his censor full of coals of the altar, ready to make an
atonement; but because men now do not bring odors, but hypocrisy, he casts
the coals into the earth, Romans 1.21.
that is, rejects their service, and delivers them over into a reprobate
mind, to do things not convenient. For when as the peace of the Church was
not sought, but men gave themselves only to pretextes of good things; there
was great corruption. Socr. 1. 10. 18. 19. 20.
For Constantine having recalled the Arians, who had made a very hypocritical
submission; he so far trusted them, that he committed the hearing and
determining of the questions of the time to the discretion of such, which
pretended to be Catholics, but were Arians in heart. And then Eusebius. vit.
Con. 4. 40. 43. Massaeus 10. p. 136. 137. Soc. 1. 9. 22. and 4. 18.
began it to be esteemed more religion to build certain places and to pray in
them, rather than in others, and to live by some prescriptions, and
willworships of Monks, Eremites, etc. than to walk by Gods word.

The effect is, that hereupon are cap. 8.5.
made voices and thundrings, and lightnings, and earthquakes; that is, great
and very fearful emotions; both for the matter and manner of them.

Here therefore does the Dragon take the opportunity to make his purpose
appear. For his Angels do hold now the four winds; that is, do bring in an
^. These. 1.11.
universal strong delusion, that men should believe lies; that they might be
damned which love not the truth; which is done by the restraint of the spirit
of the truth.

By this delusion, he first makes war cap. 12.13.
against the woman, the Church, which had brought forth a man child, and after
against her seed. In his war against the woman, by strong delusion he at
once persecuteth some, and corrupts others. In his persecution, he first
labors to destroy the Church peecemeale, and failing of his purpose, the
second time endeuoreth to drown it altogether.

In this first battle we are to consider the enemies with their several
manner of fight; and the success. The enemies are the woman, the Church; and
the Dragon on earth, that is, the devil by his deputy.

The woman is the self same before described in the first battle which was in
heaven; namely those Christians which came out of the former cap. 7.14.
tribulations, and great persecutions, under the heathen Emperors, continuing
the faith which was persecuted in the first battle in Saint John's time,
whereof some had been marked with an eye put forth, and their hamme cut, to
have stood against Arius before, and in the Nicene Council.

These are said to be of the twelve Tribes of Israel, that is, by their true
profession of the Christian faith, and circumcision of the heart, to be Romans
2.29.
truly Jews. In whom the children of Israel are multiplied exceedingly. For
first the twelve tribes are multiplied into themselves, and so are 144. and
enjoying the blessing of thousands, cap. 7.4. etc.
are 144,000. Isai. 49.5.18.
though Israel according to the flesh be not gathered, but scattered abroad.
Now these lie open to affliction, as it was foreshewed cap. 6.11.
unto their brethren. For though Constantine did Sozo. 1. 7. Eusebius. and 10.
vit. Con. c. 1. 44.
much favor and honor them that were with him; yet in other provinces many
did bear the brunt of bitter persecution.

The Dragons deputy, is the Roman Empire corrupted with heresy, and is cap.
13.1. etc.
described by the place from whence he should arise by his monstrous shape and
dignity.

He is said to arise cap. 13.1.
out of the sea, that is, from amongst people, cap. 17.15.
and multitudes, and nations, and tongues; namely all those several nations,
over whom Constantine did govern. As concerning his shape, he is first said to
cap. 13.1.
have seven heads, that is, those seven hills, and seven forms of government,
every one blasphemous; of which is Supra. cap. 1. page 3.
spoken in the description of the Dragon.

He has also cap. 13.1.
ten horns like the Dragon, not only for the decharchie, etc. as before;
but also for ten kingdoms which cap. 17.12.
should arise afterward.

And whereas the Dragon was crowned on his heads, this beast has ten crowns
upon his horns, to signify that these horns should be several kingdoms,
having regal power in their own hands.

He is bodied cap. 13.2.
like the Pantheresse, which Isid. Etym. 12.2.
is a beast very swift, venturing all dangers, Plini. 8.17.
white, spotted with little eyes of black, ravenous, beautiful, luxurious,
and with her smell, which is odoriferous, she Gerar. dial. crea. 104.
allureth other beast unto her.

Footed cap. 13.2.
like a Bear; for Plin. 8.15.
whereas the Pantheresse, as also the Lions, do hide their talants, as they
go or run, never putting them forth, but when they make at their pray; this
wild beast has Isid. Etym. 12. 2.
bears feet, which have their greatest force in their loins, and legs, and
do tear the ground as they go.

His cap. 13.2.
mouth or face is as the mouth of a Lion; whose majesty is in Cron. 12. 8.
Plin. 8.15.
his face, taking scorn to look upon his enemies or their snares; his mouth
Isidor. 12.2. Plin. 8.36.
of such force, that where he touches with his teeth, he draws goare blood.

For Rome Brought. in Concente.
having subdued the countries, which in Daniel were figured by a Lion, a
Libbard, and a beast with ten horns; thereafter is a beast which is a Lion
in mouth, a Libbard in body, and a beast with ten horns. He has also this
shape, because the heathen Eus. 8.4. etc.
Emperors, whom this beast succeeds in cruelty, used especially Lions,
Bears, Libbards and horned beasts, to torment and devour the Christian
martyrs. Now that this wild beast does signify the Emperors, which do
pretend themselves to be Christians, but oppose themselves against the Gobel.
aet. 6. cap. 64. p. 233.
Church; Pope Gregory the ninth is witness in his bull against Frederick the
second Emperor. So that now Prou. 28.15.
the wicked ruler is as a roaring Lion, and hungry Bear amongst the people.
Yea, as a Hoseah, 13.7.8.
Leopard in the way that breaks the kall of the heart.

His Dignity is the same, which the heathen Roman Empire had, first cap. 13.2.
Power, and ability to do. Secondly, Throne, that is, Iere. 45.10.
jurisdiction to give laws. Thirdly, Authority, that is, reputation, or
estimation. For there stepped up an Empire of Arians, etc pretending to be
obedient to Christ, with which all the world was enamoured and followed it, as
other beasts do the Pantheresse, hoping for great comfort by it. It was strong
and sure in marching against his enemies; as a Bear robbed of her whelps. It
was maiesticall in countenance like a Lion, seeming to deserve much honor and
reverence. But it proved a mere pretext to kill and to devour, luxurious for
idolatry, and other false worships, covetous and tearing where it went; most
cruel and bloody where it did bite; so that it was like the beast of which
Dan. 7.7, 23.
Daniel speaks, that devoured, brake in pieces, and stamped the residue under
feet. In a word it became a monster, compounded of three fierce and wild
beasts, whom no art can tame. And although it were in appearance something
different from the heathen Empire; yet for Geneb. p. 567.
persecution, it was nothing inferior to it.

The manner of the fight is diverse, as are the enemies. The Dragons deputy,
the Roman Empire corrupted with heresy; does four several times charge the
Church, as with the sound of a trumpet.

Upon the sound of the first trumpet, The first trumpet.
he charge the Church as with a tempest, in cap. 8.7. Esaias 28.2. Psalm.
18.22. Joel. 2.30.
which there was hail and fire mingled with blood, cast into the earth: that
is, with bloody persecutions, in which earthly minded men had the execution of
such punishments which were called the judgments of God; but were indeed very
painful and uncharitable persecutions. Eusebius. 10. 8. Socra. 1. ^. Melancton.
Eusebius. vit. Cor. 2.2.
For the devil through envy and wrath, with which he was enraged for the
peace of the Church: stirred up Licinius Caesar to persecute the Church. He
pretended that the Christians prayed for Constantine and not for him; but
giving himself to heathen idolatry, sorcery, murder, etc. to avenge the
cause of the old Roman gods, he with a cruel storm and tempest persecuted
the Saints, and kindled a more lamentable flame than the former persecutors
did. Hail.
He raged against the Christians, soldiers, people, and Bishops. He proclaimed
that it was very unlawful for any subject, by humanity and pity to relieve
those whom the Prince had imprisoned. By these uncharitable courses many poor
Christian prisoners were famished. He also caused many of the Christians to be
hewn in pieces, and (as butchers use their meat) to be hanged up in the
shambles, and after this horrible and unnatural spectacle, to be cast into the
sea for fishes to feed upon. But these Sozo. 1. 2.
persecutions were only about Lybia and Aegypte, and not in the rest of the
Empire. Constantine also recalled certain Socrat. 1. 10. etc.
Arians from banishment, and received them into favor, when they pretended to
repent them of that opinion. And he committed to them the hearing and
determining of the judgments of God, which were supposed to be deservedly
inflicted upon men, who indeed were unjustly accused.

The second Trumpet.
When the second cap. 8.8.
Angel had sounded his trumpet, there arises a persecution, as if a great
mountain burning with fire, were cast into the sea, that is, Iere. 51.25.
the monarchy of the world became enraged Isaiah. 17.12.
against his subjects, and a persecutor of the people of God inhabiting near
the sea coasts. This was accomplished when as Constantine by the suggestion of
his sister Licinius widow (who was deluded by an Arian priest) called a
Council at Tyrus (a city standing in the sea) against Athenasius that defended
the faith of the Nicene Creed. Him had the pretended Arian Conuerts, accused
to the Emperor of many crimes; and here against him and Macarius were diverse
matters objected, not pertaining to the Nicene Council, but of supposed
murder, sorcery, etc. purposing by those collateral accusations and
calumniations to destroy the professors of the truth, and that together with
them, the truth it self might be abolished. Ann. 33^.
This Counsel was assembled by the crafty seducements of the Arians Eus. v.
c. 4. 43.
and thither came certain from Macedonia, Panonia, Mysia, Persia, Bithynia,
Thracia, Cilicia, Cappodocia, Syria, Mesopotamia, Phaenicia, Arabia, Palestina,
Aegyptus, Africa, Thebais, and nobles of the Emperors Court.

In Ruff 1. 11. Soc. 1. 21, 22, 23. Theod. 1. 25, 27, 29, 30.
this Council was Athanasius, etc. falsely accused, in hazard, by the fury of
them which were assembled, to be torn in pieces; he was there condemned
without cause, and by the Emperor was banished, and Arius restored. Yea the
V^lat. 23. f. 270.
Emperor Constantine himself became an Arian; and as soon as Constantine was
dead, Sapor Ann. 342. Sec. 2. 12.
king of Persia persecuted the Christians, he with martyrdom crowned above
150. Bishops, besides those of the common people. Presently Constantine the
Mass. l. 11.
Emperor favoring the blast of Arius heresy, vowed, and labored violently
to bring all the world to Arianisme. To which purpose he held diverse Councels
against them which maintained the doctrine of the godhead of Christ, agreed
upon at the Nicene Council. Namely, Mass. Soc. 2. 5. 22. 23. 26. 30.
at Constantinople, Antiochia, Syrmia, Nicomedia, Theod. 2. 14. 26. Sozo. 4.
15. 18.
Nicea, Ariminum, Millaine, Seleucia, and Constantinople: He also enforced his
commandment for Arianisme by bloody persecutions, imprisonments, massacres,
treasons, by diverse kinds of torments and crafty wiles, yea the bodies of the
slain were not suffered to be put into their graves in some places. By his
means many Bishops b^came Arians, as did Theod 4. 37.
Vlphilas the Bishop of the Goths, who infected that nation with that heresy.
But this persecution was m^st about Ruff. 1. Soc. 2. 12. Soz. 6. 37. The third
tr^^pet. cap. 8. 10. 1^.
Alexandria, and the rest of the sea coasts in the East.

Again, the Dragon causes his deputy to sound a third trumpet, and to charge
the Church afresh. To this purpose, A star falls from heaven: that is, some
Isai. 14.12.
principal person falls from the profession of the Christian faith to
heresy, or infidelity. By this star, or person enraged, is stirred up
persecution, burning like a torch, that is, cruel and tormenting. The effect
whereof is, that the waters are made wormwood, whereby many do die: that is,
Amos. 5.7. and 6 12.
he did corrupt and make abhorred all Isai. 41.17 18.
the comforts of this life, and by name the scriptures and holy writings,
making them unsavory. This was accomplished Ann. 365.
in Julian the Apostata. For he Genebr. Socr. 3. 10, 11. etc. Theod. 3. 1. etc.
Soz 5. 3. and 16. etc.
had been a public professor and teacher of the Christian faith; but he became
an Apostata and Witch, naming himself the Bishop of the Pagans. Though his
persecutions were cruel and bloody, yet was the mischief that came by his
craft far greater. For he defiled the waters, bread, meat, fruit, herbs,
and whatsoever men should eat; yea his money, and statues with such filthy
idolatry, that none could partake in them, but seemed to commit idolatry. And
as he corrupted their outward comforts, so did he the knowledge with which me^
should feed and refresh their minds and souls. He forbad the Christians to
keep any schools, to bear any arms, and to possess any Ecclesiastical
goods. He Soc. 3. 19.
also labored to make the scriptures vile and ridiculous, by imputing unto
them foolish precepts. Namely, that they Carrion.
taught voluntary poverty and baseness, in suffering wrongs without revenge;
both which he said were prejudicial to a well ordered commonwealth. The godly
and learned men of the time did answer him by writing, Carrion.
but with more diligence, than sound confutation. He began in France, and
persecuted Eastward.

Yet once more he foundeth the The fourth trumpet. cap. 8.12.
fourth trumpet, and charge the Church again. And now the third part of the
Sun was smitten, and of the moon, and of the stars, so that the third part
of the day did not shine, and likewise the night. That is, Ier. 51.35. with
Mat. 5.14. Ruffa. 1. 9. Theod. 4.13.
the Bishops and Ministers, and other principal persons, who were called the
Lights of the time, were smitten with persecution. For when the Goths had
gotten aid against their enemies of the Emperor Valens, they became Arians in
token of their thankfulness to Valens. But afterward they harried booties out
of the Empire, to the great molestation of the imperials. Whereupon Valens
resolving Ann. 368.
to make war upon them, thought good to fortify himself against those
infidels, by receiving the sacrament of baptism. By Ruff. 25. 6.
the entreaties and inticements of his wife, he was baptized by an Arian, and
took a solemn oath to root out all that professed Christ any other way than
the Arians did. Wherefore he spoiled Antiochia, Samosetenses, Laodicea, Edessa,
Alexandria, Cappadocia, and Constantinople, of their Pastors (that gave them
light) sending them to prisons, or to banishment. Socr. 4. 27. Sozo. 6. 14.
Theod. 4 12. 13. 16. 19. 22. 24.
And in rooms of the Pastors, he sent wolves into the assemblies of the sheep
of Christ. He also sent soldiers with cudgels and clubs to beat the people
away from the places of their meetings. This persecution began at
Constantinople, and from thence was continued Southwards. This Soc. 4. 15.
Ruff. 2. 9.
Valens consulted with the Devil, to know his successor.

These persecutions were specially but in the East; and by the Emperors that
were but as third men in the Empire, Julian excepted, who yet did only afflict
the East; and therefore the mischief is said to light but upon the third part.
Theod. 5. 6.
The East was only pestered with the pestilence of Arius, when as the West was
in a manner always free from it. And the East seems the third part of the
Empire, by Soc. 1. 26. and alii.
the dividing of the Empire in three by Constantine amongst his three sons,
Constantius, Constans, and Constantine.

The manner of the fight of the woman which had brought forth the man child,
is diverse, by her self, and child.

Her Ruff. 2. 5. Soc. 3. 11.
self keeps her garments of the profession of Christ. She also treads
still the moon under foot. For when Julian deprived all that would not
forsake the Christian religion of their honor in his palace, those which with
an upright heart did profess the Christian faith, with a ready mind did put
off their ornaments of civil honor, and submitted themselves to most cruel
torments, rather than they would deny Christ.

She kept also her crown. For whereas liberty was often granted to all
others, only Theod. 4. 24.
those which professed the doctrine of the Apostles were persecuted. Now the
godly would not devise Soc. 3. 5. 1. Ioh. 1.1.2.
any new religion, nor bring any such into the Church; but only confirm that
which from the beginning was prescribed by Ecclesiastical tradition (that is,
was delivered by the Theod. 2. 22.
Apostles) and wise Christians had sought out by infallible reasons.

Yea she still is fruitful by the Ruff. 2. 4. 6. Socrat. 4. 19.
conversion of more people, where Christ was not known.

Her man child also Michael the cap. 14 1.
Lamb, who now is amongst his 144, 000. at Mount Zijon, does wonderfully war
against these enemies by cap. 6.2. etc.
his horsemen that ride on red horses, etc. For Arius Socr. 1. 25.
the father of the mischief died miserably, his bowels running out, and the
and 2.20.27.37. Massaeus. 11. p. 141.
Empire was full of sedition. The Persians, Magnentius Britanio, Nepotianus,
Siluanus the French, Jews in the East, Gallus Caesar, and Iulianus Caesar,
stirred up wars and seditions against Constantius, and the Emperor himself
through anguish of mind died of an Apoplexy. Soc. 3. 18.
The Persians proclaim open war upon Julian, in which war oppressed Mass.

with famine he died being slain. Soc. 435.
Procopius makes insurrection against Valens; yea the earth does quake, and
inundations of the sea are many in diverse places, shaking down many countries,
and drowning diverse cities. Muania the Queen of Soc. 4. 29.

was.

The cap. 14.1. cum cap. 7.4.
144,000, which are the number of these valiant Christians which oppose
themselves against the Arians, with as true fortitude as the tribes of Israel
did oppose themselves against the Cananites, do all this while accompany the
Lamb on Mount Zijon. Here are they known to be, by having their fathers name
written in their foreheads; that is, they are marked to defend that Ioh. 1.12.
Jesus Christ is the son of God, and in Christ themselves to be the sons of
God. By this are signified, the many Councels which the Catholics held against
the Arians which denied the godhead of Christ; as Soc. 2. 16. 19.
at Sardis, Jerusalem, and 3.5.
Alexandria, Sozo. 6. 12.
Tyanis. And also under Iouianus at Antiochia, where the Soc. 3. 24.
most contentious Arians did subscribe to the clause of the Nicene Creed, that
says that Christ is of one substance with the Father. There was also one which
was an Arian that denied the Godhead of Christ, and a Macedonian that opposed
the doctrine of the Holy Ghost, by Soc. 2. 33. 35.
name Eustathius, who attempted many things besides the Ecclesiastical rites
and customs. For he forbad marriage, he taught to abstain from meats and
marriage, whereupon he separated many from wedlock that had contracted
matrimony; The ground of private mass.
and he persuaded them that detested to come to Church, to have Communion in
their houses. He drew servants from their masters under the pretext of
godliness; he ware the apparel of a Philosopher, and compelled his followers
to use a strange kind of apparel; he forbad any prayers to be made in the
houses of such as were married. He commanded the public prayers (or blessings)
and Communion of a Minister that had a wife (which he lawfully married when he
was a lay person) to be avoided as a horrible sin, etc. But by a Council
held at Gangris he was deprived of his Episcopal dignity, and his opinions
were accursed. (Yet hence do the Papists suck many conclusions.)

The woman also the Church cap 12.14.
does betake her self to flight from these dangers, and to the woman were
given two wings of a great Eagle, that she might fly from the presence of
(the monstrous beast the deputy) of the Serpent. For during the time Eusebius.
10. 8. Soz. 1. 2.
of Licinius tyranny, the godly were constrained to fly into the
wildernesses, and the fields, woods, and mountains were their best harbor.
Melan. l. 3.
Constantine reedified Constantinople, and translated the seat of the Empire
and purity of religion thither.

In the time of Ruff. 1. 7. 8. 10 20. 21. 22. 24. Carrion.
Constantius, Athanasius is a fugitive all the world over, there were banished
Dionysius, Eusebius, Paulinus Rhodanus, Lucifer, Liberius Bishop of Rome, and
Miletus Bishop of Antiochia, whom much people followed. At that time the face
of the Church was ougly to behold, she was wasted of her own, one chased,
another fled.

In the time of Carrion.
Julian, Athanasius and others fled again. The godly and learned fathers fled
from answering of the cauils which Julian devised and objected against the
scriptures, etc. and betook themselves to prayers unto God, to deliver the
Church from so dangerous an enemy.

In the time of Valens the Ministers and people were banished, and did fly.
From Ruff. 2. 3.
Alexandria 3000. fled into the wilderness, and their Pastor Peter fled to
Rome, Barza Theod. 4. 16. 18. 21. 24.
Pastor of Edessa being banished, an infinite number followed him and flocked
to him on all sides; they all forsake the towns and meet in the fields:
Eleven Egyptian Bishops were banished, etc. Those of Constantinople were
constrained to meet without the city, where they were beaten with the
weather, with storms, frost, and snow, and sometimes with excessive heat.
The like was the condition of the Churches in other places.

The success is the safety of the Church, cap. 12.14.
who fled for a time, times, and half a time; flying not only now, but also
for the most part, till the time of Antichrist. The godly and valiant champions
called 144, 000: are also safe, because cap. 7.17.
the Lamb in the midst of the throne of God does wipe all tears from their
eyes, that is, godly Princes are a comfort unto them; as was Iouianus, and
Valentinian, who, as in the time of Soc. 3. 11.
Julian they refused all honors for the love of the Gospel, insomuch that
Theod. 3. 16. 19.
Valentinian when a holy-water-clarke of the gentiles would have cast water on
him, he took him a box on the care for fowling his clothes (and that in the
presence of the Emperor) so Soc. 3. 19. 20.
when they came to be Emperors, they much favored the truth. For Iouianus
Theod. 4. 1.
refused the Empire, saying he was a Christian; but the soldiers required him
not to refuse the Empire, for they would be Christians and he should be the
Emperor of Christians. And after the persecutor Valens, Gratian, Soc. 5. 2.
etc.
and Theodosius, Emperors recalled the Christian exiles, and by laws
authorized the truth. There was also by Theodosius a Council held at Caranza.

which the Arians made to the contrary.

And whereas the wicked inhabitants of the earth, the heretics had often felt
such distress by the Goths, Saracens, and the professors of the truth; that
they were feign to make their peace by composition; these things were as an

The end of the third period, and first battle on earth.
CHAP. IIII.
The fourth period and second battle on earth, in which the Dragon casts a
flood out of his mouth, after the woman flying, and is also the first woe to
the inhabitants of the earth.

WHen the Dragon had failed in his hope to destroy the Church by his former
trumpeters, peecemeale; (for the Church did rather increase than was
diminished) he now takes a new course. For being enraged, he labors to
drown the Church altogether, albeit with all he bring a lamentable woe upon
such, which are his own instruments of mischief.

Of this attempt or battle, are showed the enemies, their several manner of
fight, and the success.

The enemies are the Dragon the Devil, by foreign and heathen people; which
make incursion upon the countries of the Church, even both the imperials, and
the visible Church. Of these strangers, is set down: First, the means by
which they come abroad; then the kind of the mischief which they do, and
lastly the manner how they hurt.

The means by which they come abroad, is the Devil. For the Serpent cap.
12.13.
cast out of his mouth water like a flood; that is, by his words sent forth
infinite nations Isai. 59.19. Ezech. 26.3. Amos. 8.8.
after the woman, the Christian Church, that he might cause her to be carried
away of the flood, being drowned by Gentilisme or other corruption.

To this purpose he The fifth trumpet. cap 9.1.
blows the fifth Trumpet against the Church; whereupon a star falls from
heaven unto the earth, bringing in such Apostasy into the world, that some
principal Christian falls from the care of heaven, to the love of the earth;
so desiring to possess the earth, that he is contented to loose heaven, if
that might any thing further his ambition.

This was accomplished at the death of Anno 395.
Theodosius the good Emperor; who had Massaus 21. p. 154.
appointed three principal Generals of his wars to help his sons,
faithfully to administer the commonwealth. Ruffinus in the East, Gildo in
Africa, and Stilico in the West. For these three persons upon the death of
their Lord Theodosius, fell from their Christian duty; and sought for the
Empire. Ruffinus Abb. vrsp. 117.
resolved to displace his Lord Arcaedius Emperor of the East, and to take the
room himself. Stilico sought to wring the Empire from his master Honorius
Emperor of the West; and to advance his son Eucherius to that dignity. And
Gildo usurped the Empire in Africa.

Their absolute authority is said to be that the cap. 9.1. Isai. 22.22.
key of the bottomless pit was given them as a means to induce them to this
apostasy. The persons having power in their hands to let loose as dangerous
persons as the devil himself is, if they would. For all the barbarians were
to be disposed of by their direction.

When they had resolved of this apostasy, which was a sin never heard of
before among Christian Princes, they labored to cover their Isa. 29.15. and
28.15.
drifts with damnable policy, as opening the cap. 9.2.
bottomless pit, so that there came smoke from thence as the smoke of a great
furnace, even the craft of the Devil.

By their secret and close carriage of things; they did not only conceal their
purpose from men, but also the sun and the air were darkened by the smoke of
the pit. That is, Christ and his holy Gospel were so obscured, as if the fault
had been to be laid upon the Christian faith, that the times were so
troublesome.

For when Lud. Viues praef. in Aug. de ciuit. dei.
Ruffinus sought for the Empire for himself, and Stilico for his son, they
both resolved on this advice, that for perfecting of their ambitions, it was
behouefull to raise up war; that all things being in confusion by that kind
of tempest, their desires might be the more secret and easilier compassed; the
Princes being amassed with the terror of war, granting any thing to that
principal Governor, that was next to them. For they knew that in peace as in a
clear sky and open weather, the darkness of their minds might easily be
discovered and punished.

Yea, there Amb. lib. 5. epist. 31. Aug. de cuit. dei lib. 1. etc.
was for this trouble a general murmuring against Christ and the Gospel, as
if these afflictions did befall the Empire, because the heathen gods were
abolished, and Christ only worshipped.

Now, out of the smoke came these dangerous Geneb. p. 590. Abb. vrsp. p. 117.
118.
enemies. For these protectors by their speeches and letters, powered as a flood
all barbarous nations into the Empire.

The persons against whom they are brought forth, are first the woman the
Church, formerly described, with her man child, the 144,000. which attend the
Lamb on mount Sion. And these are cap. 9.4. Luc. 21.18.19. Ezech. 17.24.
called the grass of the earth, every green thing, and trees, for the
glorious royal apparel which they did wear, having put on Christ Jesus, and
for the fruitfulness of them, their lips being as a tree of life. Against
these did the devil bring them forth. For Stilico labored to inuest his son
Eucherius into the Empire, who Abb. vrsp. 118.
ever of a child did lay traps to ensnare the Christians.

Secondly they were sent forth by the Lord to be a woe to the cap. 3.13. and.
9.4.
imperials, which sought to inhabit the earth, though they felt from heaven, to
get the possession of it. And these because of their earthly ambitions, etc.
are said to be such, which have not the seal of God in their foreheads, that
is, did not openly show any testimony that they were the servants or sons of
God.

The manner of the fight of these strangers is cap. 9.3.
fearful, they being as a monstrous kind of vermi^e, compounded of Locustes
and Scorpions, at first in their inundation vexing the world like Locustes, but
afterward those which followed hurt men as Scorpions. For unto them is given
power, such as the Scorpions of the earth have, to hurt. But in their manner of
fight, we must mark diligently their diverse procceedings against the Church
and imperials; and that as they are compared to Locustes and to Scorpions.

The form cap. 9.7.
of them as Locustes, is that they be innumerable armies of horsemen prepared
to battle. Strab. Geog. l. 7. quod. G^og. l. 2.
For these nations of the Goths, as all people in the North were altogether
horsemen, none of them goes on foot; but both great and small did use to ride.

Their martial discipline is to serve under Cabellicus.
Kings, which it meant by that which is said, that on their cap. 9.7.
heads were set as it were crowns. For howsoever they had no kingdom, yet
their heads were called Abb. vrs. p. 100.
Kings. They also are said to have crowns, because that in the end of cap.
17.12.
these troubles diverse Kings did arise of them. Luc. 9.52.
For the fair pretexts which they set upon their actions, they are said to
cap. 9.7.
have faces like the faces of men. For besides that they were Abb. vrs.
of a manly countenance, they were of a singular humanity toward all men;
insomuch that they were called Strab. Geo. l. 7.
iustissimi populorum, the iustest nation in the world. And Lud. Viues in
praefat. Aug. de ciuit. dei.
when they came into the Empire they showed themselves willing to entertain
any reasonable condition of peace, discovering the treasons (of Stilico) which
they knew; neither did they violate the peace once concluded, but upon extreme
necessities.

And they had cap 9.8.
hair as the hair of women. For the Goths were called Gens Visperg. p. 96.
Gent^^.
capillata, The nation with the long hair. For the most part of that country
people do wear long hair; and do Quad. G^^g. 2.
use to poll their heads behind; but before of their hair they make two long
(trica^) tresses, or locks like unto our women; which they cast behind their
ears very amorously. By this kind of dressing is Strab. 7. p. 205. etc.
also meant their effeminate and enticing conditions, and common use of women.
It is further said, that their cap. 9.8. Joel. 1.6.
teeth were as the teeth of Lions, for the horrible waste that these Locustes
do make. Plin. l. 11. 19.
For as the natural Locustes do gnaw with their teeth whatsoever they light
upon; even the doors of men's houses sometimes; so did these Abb. vrs. page 102.
barbarians, they devoured all things, as the manner of Locusts is.

Their courage is unconquerable, as cap. 9.9.
if they had habergiont or curets like to curets of iron, of the best proof.
Viues praes. in Aug.
For they have a certain religion, that their souls do return to others
when they be slain, after the doctrine of Pythagoras; or else are placed in a
better room; or at least that death is better than life; wherefore they are
said in their wars to come up close to the swords length. It is reported
Strab. Geo. 7.
that when their Orators were asked of Alexander the Great what they feared
most; they answered, Least the sky should fall upon their heads. The cause of
their audacious resolution is Abb. vrsp. p. 100.
attributed to the patronage of Mars, whom they honor. When a Heardsman had
found a sword in the ground, with which a beast was wounded as he was grasing;
he brought it to Attilas; with this Present he grew so courageous as if he were
made by this sword, supposed to be the sword of Mars, the Prince of the whole
world.

These people make a fearful incursion into the Empire, as terribly as the
Plin. 11.29.
Locustes, that make a noise with their wings like other fowls, do seem to
those whose fields they are feared to light upon. cap. 9.9. Judge. 4.3.13. Hab.
1.7.8.
For the sound of their wings was like the sound of many chariots when many
horses run to battle. They were Viues vbi sup.
so many that no one land was able to find them food, for Abb. vrsp.
their country is called the shop of nations. And as they were always known
to be a fierce people (for Alexander would not meddle with them, Caesar avoided
himself of them; Pyrrhus abhorred them) so was their coming into the Empire
terrible, both Bergomensi^.
for the multitude of wagons and horses which they brought with them. For the
people did tremble and quake at their coming. These first Anno. 405. Carian.
came into Italy under the leading of Rhadagasus in the year of the Lord 405.

As for the persons against whom they came, they proceeded diversely; namely the
Church and imperials.

As for the Church (God so commanding) these strangers proclaimed a very Aug.
Ciuit. dei lib. 1. cap. 1. Viues sup.
strange law. Namely that the soldiers should spare the Churches, and all
whosoever fled to the Churches; and upon pain of death hurt none of them; as
if it had cap. 94.5.
been commanded that they should not hurt the grass, etc. but only those men
which have not the seal of God in their foreheads. They Geneb. p. 592. 594.
testified that they warred with the Romans, but not with the Saints, and
Apostles of God. For there was in this nation a certain religion, to respect
the worship of God as far as their knowledge would serve, for which they were
called Strab. 7. p. 205.
Godworshippers.

Toward the imperials and such which have not the seal of God in their
foreheads, they are permitted to use more violence, yet with a strange
limitation, that they should not cap. 9.5.
kill them, but that they should be vexed. For these barbarians proclaimed a
Berg. in Alarico. Viues vbi s^p.
law amongst their soldiers, that as much as was possible, they should
abstain from blood. But as they were, so did some of them acknowledge
themselves to be the scourge of God, wherefore they harried booties out of all
places of the Empire. They Anno 410. Carrion.
besieged Rome, Vis. p. 102.
took it and spoiled it, scraped all away that could be gotten, like Locustes.
This vexation was to the Empire, as the pain that comes by a Scorpion when
Weckerus Aut. spic. lib. 1. sect. 20.
he has stung a man. For it bread in them diverse afflictions of hope and
fear. For they oftentimes intermitted their fury, and renewed it again
unlooked for. Whiles Sab. E. 7. l. 4.
the Goths vexed Italy, the Vandales, Sucues, Alani, with fire and sword, and
rapine do make ougly waste in France and Spain. After the Goths, the Hunnes
waste Germany, France and Italy. After them the Bugiani, Vandales, Eruli, etc.

The cap 9.3.10.
manner of their fight as they are Scorpions is with their tails, their false
prophets and wicked religion. For they transfuse their wicked doctrine into the
hearts of Christians; as Plin. 11.^5.
Scorpions do their gall or poison into them whom they hurt. For whereas they
held that Stra. 7.
religious persons should not marry, and that it was not lawful to eat flesh;
the Christians were willing to make that to be good divinity. And whereas they
worshipped, not only as Kings, but also as gods, such religious persons as
kept themselves in inaccessible celles; and pretended to be able to show them
the secrets of the gods; so that they held Ab. vrs. p. 96.
that only to be safe, that only to be profitable, that only to be the
matter of their vows, which was commanded them by such; the Popes fitted
their turns. For they arrogated to themselves, and persuaded these strangers
that the Popes and their monkish and other clergy, were the only counselors
with God. Hereby were the Popes terrible to the fiercest of them, and
reverenced as Goths priests by that nation. For when Attilas Chro. Chro.
came to destroy Rome, the Romans etc. did tremble with horrible fear. But
Leo the Geneb. Beugem.
Pope affrighted him by a miracle, so that the tyrant obeyed the Pope; whereby
both Rome and Italy was saved. When Attilas A. Michon. cap. 14. Viues sup.
soldiers scoffed at him, and said that Attilas feared none but a Lion and a
wolf (meaning Pope Leo and Lupus Bishop of Trecas, who likewise prevailed with
him to spare that city) he answered that one in the habit of a clergy man,
stood by Pope Leo with a drawn two edged sword, and shaking it at him,
threatened to kill him and to destroy his army, except he did agree to the
Popes request.

And Geneb. p. 608.
when Gensericus with his Vandales, came resolved to burn Rome, the same Pope
prevailed with him to spare it. Totilas Greg. dial. lib. 2. 14. 15.
also the King of the Goths went to Benedict the Monk, to try whether the
fame of his being a prophet were true or no. This Benedict does report many
stories of the dead, etc. and had rules for his order, to forbear flesh etc.
When Totilas came before the cell, he cast himself upon the ground, and durst
not come near. But when he had heard the reproof and prediction of Benedict,
he was exceedingly affrighted. And when this Totilas besieged Rome, at the
instance of Pelagius the first, who Caranza.
first brought into the mass prayer for the dead (a thing that these
barbarians did much hearken after) he Geneb. p. 6^4.
obeyed, and Cario. fo. 138.
caused both virgins and men's lives, and Church goods to be spared.

Again they are said to hurt with their tails, because many of those which
came afterward became tyrants, as Sabellicus. Abb. vrs. p. 109.
( Theodoricus cruelly enforced the faith of Ariu^, Gensericus, Hunericus,
Gundebundus in Africa destroyed the Church etc. vide Geneb. p. 615. 616.

The manner of the fight of the woman, the Church, and of her man child is, by
voice, and flight. Her voice is first as the sound cap. 14.2.
of many waters, next as the sound of a great thunder, and lastly as the voice
of harpers harping on their harpes.

The sound of many waters, is a confused and vndistinct murmuring. Cari^n.
Upon the incursion of the Goths by Rhadagasus, and Alaricus etc. there was an
exceeding great murmuring, and complaining even against Christ the son of
righteousness. For diverse objected that these calamities befell the Empire
because they rejected their ancient heathen gods, and had received the doctrine
of Christ. Insomuch that Symachus the Lieftenant Amb. l. 5. epist. 30.31.
of Rome was Legate from the Senate to the Emperor to crave the heathen rites to
be restored. Whereunto Ambrose made answer in the name of the Church and
Christian Senators. With this error also Aug. de ciui. dei lib. 1. c. 12. 27.
many Christians were infected, which upon better deliberation were brought to
repentance. Many for fear they should fall into sin, by the terror or
inticements of those tyrants, did stagger in their judgments, whether they were
not best to kill themselves, and so prevent the mischief of sinning. As for
Hist. ant. ex Paulo Diaco. p. 434.
example one Dagna a noble woman of Aquileia, when the city was taken by the
barbarians, cast herself out of a turret into the river; least she should be
made a scorn by the barbarians and loose her chastity. Aug. de Ciuit. Dei.
But against such did Augustine write in his book de Ciuitate Dei, and stayed
many. Some also ran to the Churches hoping there to be martyred. But what by
the law proclaimed, to spare such as escaped to Churches, and what by the godly
persuasions cap. 9.6.
of learned men, in those days men did seek death and did not find it, and
did desire to die, but death did fly from them.

The next voice which was heard of the Church was terrible as thunder, against
her heretical enemies, which were at this time very many. Augustine De ciuit.
dei lib. 1.
confuted them that said that Christ and his Gospel was the cause of these
troubles; and proved by good demonstration, that the Empire was spared for
Christ's sake. The Melanct. 3. Geneb. p. 589. etc.
Arians, Maniches, Nestorians, and Pelagians, were vehemently and publicly
confuted, some by Augustine, some by Jerome, and others; the Eutychians by
Cyril etc.

The third voice was as of harpers harping on their harpes, that is, a most
heavenly harmony, of those which consented together, in the true doctrine of
the Christian faith, singing as it were a cap. 14.3.
new song.

Of this song is observed the place where it was sung, and what manner of
understanding it required.

The place is said to be before cap. 14.3.
the throne, and before the four beasts, and before the Elders, that is, in
the Church before God the father, the son, and the holy Ghost, before the
glorious Cherubins, and before the faithful and holy governors of the Church.
This does signify the good and most Christian Councels which were held before
the Lord and his Angels by the authority of godly and religious Princes, and by
the assistance of the faithful Bishops and Ministers of the word. For Caranza.
under Theodosius was held a Council against the Nestorians. And also the
Carthaginian, Mileuitan, and Aurasican Councels were held against the
Pelagians. The Affrican Melan. 3. Epist. Aug.
Council wrote unto Innocentius the Bishop of Rome, and exhorted him that he
would also disallow the errors sprung up at Rome, and would not suffer them to
spread any further. Under Martianus was held a Council at Chalcedonia against
the Eutychians. Geneb. p. 64^.
In the year of Christ 552. was held a Council at Constantinople against
certain heretics, and to confirm the four general Councels. A heavenly
harmony of holy harpers.

The song which those Fathers and Councels did sing is somewhat dark to be
understood. For no man cap. 14.3.
could learn the song but the 144,000, which were bought from the earth: to
wit, those faithful witnesses which are not earthly minded. For as it is said
of some of Augustines latter books, that he has sometimes improper Melan. 3.
de Eccl post. Vol. 3.
speeches, but if they be well and favorably judged of, they contain the very
truth: so may it be said of the rest, because the iniquity of the time
enforced them to speak with as little offense to the impiety of men, as
possibly might be, etc.

The flight of the woman in these troublesome times was by flying to carry her
self clean out of the cap. 12.14.
sight of the Serpent. For the countries now Geneb. p. 5^^.
made newely kingdoms were converted afterward. Sabel.
In Africa in the time of Gensericus the Church was clean extinguished, the
Bishops which maintained the truth being fled and banished for ever: and so
by other tyrants in other places. From hence the Church is fled from the
presence of the Serpent, and is mingled for a time, times, and half a time,
that is, 1260. years, there being many godly men amongst the devilish
tyrants and heretics, which they do not see not know of: yet there is the
Church.

The success is diverse in the Church and Empire, and also concerning these
strangers.

By this inundation of these barbarous cap. 13.3.
nations, that one head of the beast was as wounded to death by the sword: that
is, the Roman Empire in the West was clean overthrown, rent, and torn.
Geneb. p. 609

In the space of 142. (or rather 150) years, 642.
Rome the tamer of mankind, and castle of all nations, did sustain many
casualties by the judgment of God, that it might seriously slide to the hands
of the Church, whose head (as some think) it ought to be, and to that use
should be built again from the foundation. For after that Rome was spoiled by
Alaricus army in the age of Augustine and Hierome, anon it was wasted by the
Vandals within 44. years. After that 22. years by Odoacer, and his Heruli.
Again after 14. years by Theodoricus and his Ostrogothes. Furthermore after
50. years it was taken by Belifarius. At last it came into extreme misery by
Totilas and the relics of the Goths after 12. years. And Hist. ant. ex

overthrown: that as she was wont to triumph over the whole world, so now
there is no nation so fierce and barbarous which does not repaie the injury
done to them or their auncestrie. For in Augustulus Carrion. f. 143.
the Empire of the Augusti in Italy perished and ended. They lost their Sab.

language at Rome. The Roman civil laws were as exiles Geneb. p. 914
from hence for the space of 600. years, etc.

But the earth help the woman, and the earth cap. 12.16.
opened her mouth and swallowed up the flood which the Dragon had cast out of
his mouth: that is, the countries into which these strangers made incursion
swallowed them us. For these strangers did content themselves to be mixed with
the natural inhabitants Sa^el. ^n. ^. l. 5.
of the countries into which they came. The Goths which remained in Italy
degenerating into the name of Italians, in Spain into Spaniards, leaving only
in diverse places some places of their names which keep their memory. And of
them arose certain kingdoms, bearing the names of the places where they were
for the most part.

The success that these strangers found was first that their power was
limited. For cap. 9.5.^.
their power was to hurt five months, that is, an hundred and fifty year. For
a month Erasm. Rem^. in tab. Pr^t.
according to the account of the Hebrews, Egyptians, and Astronomers
contains 30. days, and so five months amount to 150. days, which counting
a Ezech. 4.6.
day for a year after the manner of the scripture, comes to 150. year. For
from the time that Rhadagasus first entered, which was in Carrion.
the year 405. unto the Sabel.
death of Teias the last of these strangers that afflicted the Empire, which
was Geneb. p. 643
in the year 555. is precisely 150. year. And though the people did still
continue, yet the kingdom, name, power, and Empire of the Goths were rooted
out of Italy. And so in other places this number of 150. years is in a manner
a fatal limit to such as make incursions into the countries of others.

Secondly, they that for 150. year could be brought under no man's power, were
in the end afterward made the subjects of Antichrist. Strab. 7.
And as before they came they were subject unto their Priest which lived in an
inaccessible cell, as an angel of the bottomless pit, who did ever set them to
make incursion upon their neighbors, as Abaddon, or Apollyon, a destroyer; so
cap. 9.11.
now they had a King set over them, which is that Angel of the bottomless pit,
whose Dan. 7.
name in Hebrew is Abaddon, and in Greek is 2 Thessalonians. 2.
named Apollyon: namely that Angel, or false Prophets whom the Hebrews and
Greeks do call the son of perdition, that is, Antichrist.

Of the corruption and delusion which Satan wrought in others, in the time of
these two last battles.

IN the two last Chapters has been showed how the Dragon by his cap. 7.1.

For only the East was pestered with the pestilence of the Arians. Now are we
to proceed to show what became of the cap. 9.20.
remnant; that is, the other two thirds of the Empire. For even amongst them
also was the cap. 7.3.
earth hurt, after the servants of God were sealed.

That which is here to be considered, is the cap. 13.11.
story of another beast, or kingdom, or principality, which is said to arise
out of the earth; into which cap 12.9.
the Dragon was cast, and where he deceives cap. 20.3.
the world.

In the story hereof is set down the rising of the beast, the opposition of
the Saints, and the success.

This beast though in many things it be like the other beast; yet in some does
it differ from that which presented the Roman Empire corrupted with heresy.

First, whereas that beast arose cap. 13.1.11.
out of the water, to wit, from amongst many nations, this other arises out of
the earth. Now they are said to be of the earth, which are so m earthie, as
earthly is opposed to heavenly. So that this beast arises out of earthly
aduancements, etc. For the West by the protection of Constantine was freed from
the persecution of Licinius, and also honored by him. For first he Ruff. 1. 2.
refused to cen^ure them, esteeming them as gods. And Geneb. p. ^5.
after enriched the Church with silver and gold, departed to Constantinople,
and (as some say) gave the city of Rome, etc. and princely ornaments to Pope
Siluester and his successors. Which (amongst other testimonies) Genebrard does
prove by two Rabbines. The Jdem p. 555.
first Abraham Leuita, thus: He (vz. Constantine) went out of Rome and gave it
to the Idu^^ean Priests, meaning the Popes. The other is Aben Ezra, who
testifies thus, He (vz. Constantine) beautified Rome, which was the place of
his seat, and left it to that iniquity which now is called Peter. It seems
somewhat was done this way, but nothing so much as is pretended. For besides
that Valla, a Valla contra den. Constable.
man of singular knowledge, writes against that treatise which bears the
name of The Donation of Constantine; Volateran the Volat. 23. f. 270.
keeper of the Vatican library, and so best acquainted with the antiquities of
the city of Rome, does deny any such donation to be made by Constantine,
showing that it is to be found in no old author, but only in the Decrees, and
that not in their ancient copies. Crantzius Crantz. Met. l. 11. c. 24. p 772
says the Pope was great, not by the forged donation of Constantine, which
never was made, but by the bounty of other Princes. But such as it was, the
humanity of Eus. vit. Con. 4. 5^.
Constantine was abused by the insatiable covetousness and unspeakable
dissimulation of such as pretended themselves to be Christians. Polychr. 4.26.
f. 171.
From that time forward, because of the great riches that the Church of Rome
had, it was made the more secular, and had more secular business than
spiritual devotion; and more pomp and boast outward, than holiness within, as
it is supposed. It is written that when Constantine had made this gift to the
Church, the old enemy cried openly in the air, This day is venom powered
into the holy Church. Therefore Jerome in vitis Patrum says, since the holy
Church increased in possessions, it is decreased in virtues. And so the beast
rises out of the earth. He is also said to rise out of the earth for his
insensible manner of growing. For the things which grow out of the earth are
well discerned to have grown, but the manner how no man sees. And this is it
that the scripture calls privily 2. Pet. 2.1.
bringing of damnable heresies, contrary to the declaring of the Gospel, which
is seen upon an instant, not only like a swift horseman, but like Math. 24.27
lightning, etc.

Secondly, he differs from the other monster by his horns, which are not
ten, but cap. 13.1.11. cap. 5.6.
two, and those like the Lamb which had eyes, arrogating to himself to be like
unto Christ, representing N.D. Warneword. En. 1. c. 2. 11. 6. 7. 8.
his power and wisdom upon earth as his Vicar or Viceroy. So that in matters
of jurisdiction and spiritual authority for government of his Church upon
earth (he presumes that) Christ has left so great power unto his
substitutes, Peter's successor (the Pope of Rome) as he may do thereby, and in
his name and virtue in a certain sort, whatsoever his master and Lord might
do in his Church, if he were now conversant amongst us upon earth.

Thirdly, he differs in voice. cap. 13.11.
For he speaks like the Dragon; whereas the other did roar but as a Bear,
or Pantheresse, or Lion. He is said to speak like the Dragon for his terror.
For it is reported that about the Gesu. lib. 5.
tower of Babel there dwell great Dragons, whose voice and yelling does
terrify men. And when Alexander went into India a Dragon with his terrible
noise and hissing did terrify his whole army. By this is meant that the
Church of Rome, or the Pope should from henceforth labor to rule by 2. Tim.
3.2.
cursed speaking and execrations: as also by as bloody and cruel laws and
interdictions, as ever the heathen persecutors did tyrannize with. For in Nero
the Aug. de Ciu. Dei. 20. 19.
facts of Antichrist were seen. So that by those courses he should not only
fright other men, but also be terrible to Monarchs and their valiant armies.

He is also said to speak like the Dragon, because by the spirit of error he
1. Tim. 4.1.3
brings in doctrines of devils forbidding to marry, and commanding to
abstain from meats, etc. and diverse superstitions, telling men that they Genesis
3.4.
shall not die if they transgress Gods commandments, and have his pardon.
That for their skin Job. 2.4.
men will blaspheme God. Mat. 4.9.
Offering to give preferments to such as will fall down and worship him,
being a 1. Kin. 22.22
lying spirit in the mouths of the Prophets of Kings, etc. cap. 19.20.
And for these and such like causes he is called The false prophet that
prophesies lies, etc.

But he is like unto the first monstrous beast in this, that he does cap. 13.12.
exercise the power of the first beast before him, taking upon him as an
Emperor in the time and presence of the Emperor: laboring to be as absolute
over the Clergy as the Emperor is over the temporaltie; exempting his Clergy
from civil jurisdiction. 2 Thessalonians. 5.2.
Yea exalting himself above all.

Yea he proposes to himself to be Monarch of all, and therefore what ever be
his pretext, he in his private drift causes the cap. 13.12.
earth and them that dwell therein to worship the first beast, whose deadly
wound was healed: that is, to worship an Ecclesiastical Monarch which he
labors to establish in the room of the former civil Monarchy which was
overthrown in the West by the former incursions of strangers, and only healed
by the Popes.

The cap. 13.13.14
means which he uses to further these ambitions are great wonders, and
deceiptfull in the fight of men, and of the beast; that is, seeming miracles to
the Prince and people; howeuer there may be a better and truer construction
made of them to be deceipts. These his miracles therefore are cap. 18.23.
called inchauntments wherewith all nations are deceived. 2. These. 2.9.10.
And this is that of which S. Paul speaks when he says of the adversary of
Christ, Whose coming is by the effectual working of Satan with all power and
signs of lying wonders, and in all Aug. Ciu. Dei. 20. 19.
deceiuablenes of unrighteousness. Which are wonders either so seeming when they
be but impostures; or else if true, they be the works of the devil to gain
credit to the great enemy of the Gospel. Particularly for instance it is said
that he cap. 13.13.
caused fire to come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men; that
is, he seems to men to cause God Isa. 9.5. and 37 36.
to send down vengeance from heaven upon men that do not respect him,
applying all the calamities that befall them that love him not, to be
judgments of God to revenge the contempt offered to this beast. The Popes were
famous far Chro. Chr.
miracles when they had once gotten purple.

The opposition of the Saints is something, though very small, contenting
themselves that cap. 14.3.
they were bought from the earth, having nothing to do with the ambition of
this beast, that only minded how to possess the earth, wincking at much
corruption when they saw it. About Fasc. Tem. f. 47 b. Frising. Chro. 4. cap. 3.
the possessions of the Church, which the Prelates at this time began to have,
there was often a great contention among the Doctors. Some said it was just and
profitable that the Church should abound in temporalties, and have earthly
honors, others thought not. But the Bishops of Rome accepted of these honors.
And they of that Church do think that Geneb. p. 552 553.
it much concerned God in some place to have a visible Ecclesiastical
Monarchy, which by divine authority (by causing fire to come down from
heaven upon men) might restrain, terrify, smite with lightning, and bring
into obedience tyrants, heretics, schismatics, etc. Wherefore the Bishops of
Rome, which was the chief city in the world, endeavored to attain unto that
dignity, and to enrich the Church by all means possible. These things will
appear more particularly in the stories of the Popes, whereof do follow some
brief collections.

miracles (or great wonders.) For he is reported to Pet. de Not.
have cleansed Constantine of a leprosy. But Volat. 23. f. 270.
the book of that miracle is Apocrypha, manifestly dissenting from the
Doctors, and altogether to be rejected ( as a 2. These. 2.9. cap. 13.14.
lying sign.) He is said to have revived a dead Pet de Not.
Ball, to bind a Dragon that killed men with his breath, (a false miracle).
Gesn. l. 5.
For Dragons do not hurt with their breath: hereby he labored to gain
reputation to his profession. He forbad Caranz. f. 4^. 37. a.
Subdeacons to marry (hear the voice of the Dragon.) He devised the Chrisme,
with which the Bishops should sign them that were baptized, to confirm them
against the persuasion of Heretics. The manner is this, Poly. invent. 5. 3.
the Bishop makes the sign of the cross in the forehead of the party to be
confirmed, and says, I sign thee with the character or token of the cross,
and confirm thee with the chrisme of salvation. Berg. 9.
He commanded that no lay man should presume to call a Clergy man into a
civil court; nor that any Clergy man should sue before a secular Judge: and
decreed that Caranz. f. 46. a.
neither Emperor, nor Kings, nor all the Clergy may judge the Pope
(exercising the power of the first beast even before him, etc.)

Marcus appointed Berg. 9.
that no Clergy man might by any means be drawn unto secular business. Ann.
334.
He built two Churches in Rome. Constantine enriched him with many gifts. (The
beast does rise out of the earth.)

Julius reprehended the Anno 341. Chr. Chro.
Arians, especially that they called a Council at Antiochia without the
authority of the Pope of Rome, when as without his authority (he said) it
neither ought nor could be. He decreed that whosoever suspected his judge,
might appeal to the seat of Rome, (the Pope)

Liberius was Po^ ^^r.
banished for standing against the Arians: Ann. 35^.
in the mean while by his Counsel the Clergy of Rome ordained Felix Pope.

This Felix proceeded severely against the Arians. Wherefore Constantius the
Emperor reconciled Liberius; for he seemed more easy to the Arians. Liberius
then being overcome with the grief of exile, and glad that he was Pope again,
assented and fell into heresy, and subscribed Massaus, 11.
thereto. But Felix and the Fasc. Temp. s. 48. b.
Catholics having admonished him, and finding him to be contumacious, cast
him out of the Church as an heretic: wherefore Liberius cast Felix out of the
Papacy; held the Churches violently, and by strength; so that there was a
great persecution of the faithful, and the Clergy and priests that favored
Felix were slain in the Churches, and Liberius forbad it not. Vol. 22.
And Felix himself was slain as defending the truth. This Felix was Geneb. p.
574.
also reported guilty of heresy. But such is the force of the Apostolical
chair (says Genebrard) that it would rather make a martyr than hear an
heretic. Here wants some help to reconcile these popish Chronologers.

wrote to Caranza. f. 85. b.
Stephanus, and an Archbishop, and to the three Councels of Africa, that the
judgment of the causes of Bishops, and all matters of great-importance, may
not be determined, but by the authority of the Apostolic seat. (Thus did the
beast rise out of the earth.) But in 1. Conc. Constable. can. 1.2. Caranza.
his time it was contrarily decreed, that no Bishop should confound the
authority of bishoprics, by intermedling in another diocese, to dispose of
Ecclesiastical causes. He also decreed that none should Did. 17. huic. sedi.
presume to usurp the things which were granted to that seat. cap. 24.9.1.

It is said, that to him Ierom wrote, that whosoever should blame the faith

He abolished the ancient translation of the Bible, which was made by the
Septuagin^; and then was in great estimation; and brought into the Church the
writings of Jerome and many songs (as having the horn of the eye of wisdom

decreed, that no Psalms or songs made by vulgar persons should be used in
the Church; nor any books read in the Church which are not of the Canonical
Scriptures of the old and new testament. In this Popes time was decreed, that

down the pride of such, it was decreed that Ibid. can. 26.

sacerdos, but only the Bishop of the first seat.

This Pope Plat. Berg.

and superstition of the Goths, that Stra. 7. p. 205. 206.
would have their religious persons without wives. But this his decree is
contrary to the Gangrene Council, which accuses such as D. 30. si qui^

accuse the marriage bed, as a let to the kingdom of heaven.

Innocentius the first, (is said to have) excommunicated the Geneb.
Emperor Archadius, Anno. 406.
and by his Epistle to have deprived Eudoxia the Empress from her dignity. He
as an Heracleonite decreed that Caran. f. 15^
all persons in their deadly and extreme sicknesses, should be anointed with
oil hallowed by Bishops. That priests should judge of the quality of the
offense, and penitence of men, and at their discretion dismiss them. He
instituted the kissing of the Pax, that all men might declare their consent to
that which was done. He, after the heresy of the Ponet Apol. page 105.
Cataphrygians and Montanus, who feigned himself to be the holy Ghost,
ordained that the custom of no Church is to be followed in divine mysteries,
or doing of things, but only the Church of Rome. It seems he would have
Rome say, as sometimes Babylon said, I Isai. 47.10.
am etc. none else; unto whom may be said, as to the Cataphrygians, came 1.
Cor. 14.36. See epist. Ath. 1. in Soc. 2. 29.
the word of God from you, or came it to you alone? In his time, Rome was taken
by the Goths. At the instance of the African Council, he condemned the
heresy of Pelagius.

ought to be done publicly without the Bishop of Rome. He absolved Fox Marty.

Apiarius an Aphrican without any examination, when he stood excommunicate by
an Aphrican Council. And wrote to the Bishops of Aphrica, commanding them to
receive this Apiarius, by him so absolved, into their communion. Pretending
that the Bishop of Rome had authority to command, granted unto him by the
Council of Nicea. (Thus far was the beast risen out of the earth.) The
African Bishops sent into the East for the original copies of the Niceau
Council; by which they found the Pope to be an impostor. Whereupon they do
decree, that he that is Caranza, Com. Mileuit. Can. 18.22.
excommunicate, may appeal to the Primates and Councels of his own province;
but he that appealeth beyond the seas, shall be received into no communion.
Council. Aphr.
And the African Council wrote to Caelestine who succeeded Zosimus, requiring
him to bring into the Church no such foggie types of the world.

Bonifacius the first got and possessed the seat by Volat.
schism. Anno 423.
In his time are cited the stories of Chro. Chro.
Euphrosina, and Marina, women, who took on them men's apparel, and entered
into monasteries amongst men; which though it were contrary to the D. 30. si
qua mulier.
Gangrene Council, yet are they called Pet. de Not. Anno 426.
Saints.

Calestinus commanded all Clergy men to study the Volat.
Canon law. As yet it seems it was not commanded, that the Clergy should
have diverse apparel from the people; but that it began by some to be brought
in. For thus writes Caelestinus of the Clergy. They are to Caranza. f. 130. a.
be distinguished from the people by doctrine, not by apparel, by
conversation, not by attires, by purity of mind, not by clothing, etc. which
I see not how it stands with that which Genebrarde says, Geneb. p. 530.
that Stephanus the first, instituted priests garments, etc. Anno 257.

Sixtus the third deposed Polytronius Gobel. at. 6. cap. 25. p. 169.
Bishop of Jerusalem, because he affirmed himself to be universal Bishop.
Anno 434.
(to depose in these days signified to pronounce deposed.) Caranz. f. 137.
This Sixtus required that every Bishop accused, and appealing to the
Apostolic seat, all men should stand to that which that seat should
determine. In his time it was Idem. Con. Agath. c. 38.
decreed, that if the lay people did not come to the city to applaude the
Bishops in great solemnities; they are to be excommunicated. The beast rises
out of the earth.

Leo the first was of such reputation, Anno 442.
that what he Fasc. Tem. f. 51.
spoke was so approved, that it was not lawful for any to dissent in the least
thing. He first Geneb. p. 558.
brought in auricular confession, as he writes in an Epistle. viz. It shall be
sufficient henceforth, to show by secret confession unto the priest, the guilt
of the conscience. (Thus rises the beast.) He decreed that reverence Caranz.
f. 143. a.
should be given to the images or statues of the Saints, in pain of a curse
(making way to idolatry.) He much furthered his affairs by (supposed)
miracles, for which he was famous. It is said, that to Pe. de Not.
further the credit of his letters which he sent to the Council of Calcedon,
Saint Peter corrected them in all places, by the prayer, and fasting of the
Pope, contrary to the commandment of God, which very severely forbids and
condemns consultation with the dead. He is also said to cut off his own
hand, because when a woman kissed it as he was ministering, he fell into
temptation. But the virgin Mary, at his prayers brought it again, and recured
him; as he himself did often report. He also miraculously terrified Attilas
with his fierce Hunnes; under him Rome Mass. 12. p. 164. Anno 463.
was taken and spoiled by the Vandals.

Hilarious decreed that no Caranz. f. 168. b. Anno 470.
Bishop should choose his successor; and that no Bishop should be ordained
without the consent of the Metropolitan Bishop.

Simplicius decreed that no Clerk should receive a benefice at a lay man's
hand. Polychr. Mass. 12. p. 166.
In his time Odoacer won Italy, and possessed Rome. Then Augustulus cast away
his purple and fled fearfully. In him the glorious name of Augusti, and
Caesar's of the Roman nation ended Buchlo.

extinguished.

mountain for his worship; contrary to Saint John's cap. 19.10. and 22.8. Anno

Gelasius decreed, that no De Cons. did. 1. Omnes.
Church should be consecrated, but by the authority of the sea Apostolic. He
held, Sab. En. 8. 2. Caranz. f. 171. 172.
that Councels are subject to the Pope, (a point not yet decided amongst the
Papists) and that all should appeal to him, but none from him. And showed that
Emperors ought to put their necks under the feet of the Prelates. So greedy
is Gratian the Canonist, to show that in this Gelasius was to be seen, how the
Pope (the beast) was risen up to greatness, that he brings in Gelasius, in his
letters to Ca^s. 159. 6. Alius.
Anastasius the Emperor, to cite the story of one of his successors that lived
after him, near 249. years, as if he had been his predecessor. Either Gratian
lies, or this Pope wrought a wondrous miracle herein. It appears that about
this time, some would have brought in the communion under one kind. For
Gelasius writes against such, in these words in a manner. We have De cons. d
2. comperimus.
found that some taking only the portion of the holy body, do abstain from
the cup of the hallowed blood; who without all doubt (because I know not by
what superstition they are taught to be thralled) either let them receive the
whole sacraments or be put from the whole. In his Massaus 12.
time Theodoricus with the Osirogothes, possessed Italy and Rome.

Anastasius the second communicated D. 19. Anast. Volat, etc.

In these times was great dissension at Rome, some chose Paurentius, others
this Symachus to be Pope. By reason whereof were committed murders and rapines
at Rome of the Citisens, Clergy, and Priests; for about three years long
together. Paschasius a Greg. dial. lib. 4.
principal Deacon, and a godly man, took part with Laurentius. But (it is
fabled that) he was seen after his death by the Bishop of Capua, in the pain
of purgatory for that cause (a lying wonder to deceive.) cap. 9. q. 3. Aliorum.
This Symachus decreed that the Pope is subject to none but God (thus rises
the beast.) He held a Synod at Rome against Caranz f. 174.
such as invaded the Church goods. He decreed that those wounds are to be 169.

for Abaddon.)

Anno 515.
Hormisda was very much enriched by the Kings of France and of the Goths. He
sent Bergm. hist. ant. Ex Paul. Diac.
Ambassadors to Anastasius the Emperor, admonishing him to depart from the
heresy of Acacius. The Emperor being angry, presently thrust the Popes Legates
out of the city, saying he would command the Pope and others, and not be
commanded. And (as it is understood) therefore a little after, all his
Princes standing by, that he might be plagued for his wickedness and pride, he
was killed with a stroke of lightening (thus the beast makes fire to come
down from heaven in the seeming of men.)

Anno 524.
John the first was sent by Pet. de Not.
Theodoricus King of the Goths to Iustine the Emperor; to persuade him to
restore the Arians, whom Iustine had removed for their heresy. In his way to
Constantinople, lie rode upon a Ladies horse which was gentle and easy of
pace, but after so great a Bishop had sat upon him, he would never endure a
woman upon his back. (a foolish miracle) When he came to Constantinople, at
the gate in the presence of the Emperor and people, he (is said to have)
restored sight to a blind man that begged. Wherefore the Emperor and people
received him with great reverence. The Pope Ab. vrs. p. 109.
with many tears craved the Emperor to restore the Arians. The Emperor moved
with his tears, granted his request, and restored the Arians to their
authority again. Thus the beast deceives them that dwell upon the earth by
reason of the signs which were given him to do in the sight of the beast. He
at Constantinople crowned Geneb. p. 629.

Bonifacus 2. gat the seat by schism, he decreed that in the time of divine
service the Massaeus.
Clergy should be in a distinct place (as the quire) from the people. He
called a Synod and decreed Gobelinus.

instituted the order of the Benedictines. He despised the study of Greg. dial.

reported to master devils, to absolve the dead, etc. He is compared for

the Emperor sent gifts, and honored him with new dignities, acknowledging
him to be in the seat of Christ's only Vicar upon earth. (The Emperor sees
the Pope to have horns like the Lamb.) Ann. 535.


Agapetus was Greg. dial. 3. 3.
sent by Theodatus king of Goths to the Emperor Justinian, to reconcile him
whom he had displeased for killing of his Queen; who was committed by her
father to this Justinians tuition. In his way in the parts of Greece he healed
a man that was brought unto him dumb and lame, who never could speak nor go
(as they say). When his neighbors brought him he asked if they did believe
that he could cure him: who answered that they hoped he could, by the power of
God, and authority of Saint Peter. When the Pope had prayed and celebrated
Mass, he stretched forth his hand unto the lame man, who presently arose in
the sight of the people. And putting the Host into his mouth, had present use
of his tongue by the power of God, and help of Saint Peter. Coming therefore
to the Pet. de Not. Sabel. f. 152. Ann. 536.
Emperor, he was received with reverence and glory. (Thus is the world
deceived by her enchantments.)

Siluerius Massaeus.
was caused to be chosen by Theodotus King of Goths, wherefore he presently
sent his Chancellor Vigilius to the Emperor to excuse him that he could not
wait the Emperors pleasure. The Empress dealt with Vigilius for the
restoring of her friend Authemius an Eutychian. Vigilius answered, that Pope
Siluerius would in no wise consent thereto; but as for himself, he would
easily agree, had he power in his hands ( vz. if he were Pope.) The Empress
caused Siluerius to be removed, which was done by the subornation of witnesses
that affirmed that Siluerius would deliver the city of Rome, and Belifarius
the Emperors General into the hands of the Goths. Pet. de Not. Ann. 537.
In his banishment he miraculously healed many.

Vigilius upon Massaeus.
the banishment of Siluerius was thrust into the Papacy: he decreed that Mass
should be celebrated toward the East. This manner of turning the Polyd. Inuen.

commandment of God. In the time Geneb.

followed a pestilence. (Thus Michael warreth when the word of God by the
Benedictines was refused, and the inventions of men were adored. After the

Narses is made General of the wars in Italy, who brings with him an army
of 12,000. Lombards.

Pelagius 1. Ann. 555.
was Caran. f. 201
the first that brought into the Mass prayer for the dead (as an angel of the
bottomless pit.) And the Pope is like Liuid. 1. lib. 1
the Pont. Max. of Numa his devising, to whom is committed the order to pacify
the Spirits in the behalf of the dead. So that now it is with the Church of
Rome, as the Poet says: Virg. Eu. 5. 1. p. 230.
Vinaque fundebant pateris animamque vocabant
Anchisa magni, manesque Acheronte remisses.


This Pope also Pet. de Not.
decreed that those whom he calls heretics or schismatics should be
punished by the secular power (as Abaddon or Apollyon.) Geneb. p. 643.
In his time Narses the first Exarche of Rauenna finished the wars of the
Goths, who brought the Lombards into Italy.

The success is, that cap. 13.11.
the beast does rise out of the earth, that is, that the Popes by means of
earthly riches and honors, as also by earthly wisdom, do rise to the state of
such a Prince, as has the reputation to have two horns like the Lamb, that
is, to seem to represent Christ upon earth, for power and wisdom.

The nations also which came in by the former incursions, do begin cap.

heathen or Arians. These ten cap. 17.12.
principalities which in S. John's time had not received the kingdom, Dan. 7.8.
did receive power as kings, at an hour, with the beast, the Pope. Amongst
whom, the Popes came up another little horn, or kingdom at this time. Lactan.

For Lacta^tius and Hierome upon Daniel, do say that all writers affirm this,

that about the end of the world shall be ten kings which shall divide
amongst them the Roman world: and among them Antichrist shall be added the
eleventh, as witnesses Valla.

CHAP VI.
The fifth Period. Of the recured beast, the true Antichrist; which presents
himself in the beast which comes out of the bottomless pit; of the respect
and dependence which he got, and of the worship of the Dragon, etc.

THe Empire beyond all hope was cap. 13.3.
wonderfully cured of the wound it received by the sword of the barbarous
nations that made inundation thereinto as a flood. And the Church which before
had cap. 12.1.

consider the enemies, their several manner of fight, the continuance, and the

enemies are the Dragon, and the seed of the woman. The Dragon being now upon

people and nations, etc. does war by his deputy: The beast which was
wounded by the sword, and did live by means of Popes, who are that beast which
had two horns like the Lamb. The recured beast is the politic governor of
the public face of the Christian world. This external face is compared to the
courts which is cap. 11.2.
without the Temple, whither the Kings, the Priests, the whole multitude and
people of all sorts resorted in the time of the Law. This multitude is now
left to be governed by him which is commonly called Antichrist; who was to be
revealed unto the world presently upon the taking away of the Empire out of the
West; which did withhold the Gospel in the times of the Apostles. As the
Apostle says, He 2 Thessalonians. 2.7.8.
which now withholdeth (the Gospel) shall let (the disclosing of Antichrist)
till he^ be taken out of the way. And then shall the wicked man be revealed,
etc. Chrysostom. in 2 Thessalonians. 2. Hom. 4 Nic. Orem. ex Hierom. q. vlt. ad inquisi.
Januarii, apud Foxum Martyr p. 412.
For when as the Roman (or West) Empire shall be taken away, then shall
Antichrist come. And not without cause: for while the fear of the Empire shall
be, none shall presently be subject to Antichrist. But when the Empire shall be
destroyed, he shall invade the principalities of the Empire being void; and
shall endeavor to take unto himself by force the Empire both of God and man.

This recured beast (which is called Antichrist) is described to be A woman
sitting on a scarlet colored beast. cap. 17.3.


The woman Ca. 17.18. Lactant. Justit. 7.15.
is (Rome) that great city, which in (S. John's time) had dominion over the
Kings of the earth: upon which cap. 17.13.
also, the kingdoms which did afterward arise did depend. She is described
by her place, apparel, profession, and name. Her place is said to be The cap.
17.3.
wilderness in the spirit, that is, in matters concerning the spirit, a
forlorn and desolate place, a wilderness, spiritually so called; in which all
things are Auenar. dict. hebr. in Mid^bar and Shememah.
so confounded that a man cannot look upon it without sighing for grief. A
place of Isay, 13.20. Psalm. 44.19.
Dragons and Ostriges, and wild people, etc. Howsoever ungodly and ignorant
men commend her for holiness and civility: So barbarous in the times
following did that city or policy prove; The place is also called a
wilderness for cap 18.8.21. etc.
the desolation which the city is to come unto in the end.

As touching her apparel, it is said to be much unlike the true Church, which
was clothed in heavenly apparel: This woman was cap. 17.4.
arraied in purple and scarlet, the Poly. Jau. 5. 3
colors of the robes by which the Emperors were known, and with Dan 5.7.
which Princes did use to honor them whom they would advance; which was often
also put for the Martial.
Magistracy and the Magistrates. The signification is, that that city should
by honors given unto it by Princes rise unto no less than imperial
sovereignty in the time of Antichrist. As also teaching that riches, external
glory, princely immunitie, and authority should be the only thing that she
principally labors for. For Hist ant. ex Egn. p. 426.
the Bishops of Rome were from this time of an ambition more tha^ immoderate;
and so are men of corrupt minds destitute of the truth, which think 1. Tim.
6.5. etc.
that gain is godliness. And so much unlike the true Church, that trod the
moon under foot, because she knows that Godliness is great gain, etc.
She is further said to be gilded with gold, and precious stones, and pearls,
trimming her self as a bride, or rather a curtezan for the greatest Prince.

Her profession is cap. 17.1.4.5.
whordome, in the sense of both the tables; spiritual, for idolatry, and
Psalm. 106.29
inventions of men; and carnal for adulteries, which grew to be very common,
when men and women were seduced to lead a single life: wherefore this woman is
called cap. 17.1.
The great whore, even spiritually cap. 11.8.
Sodom.

For the more easy enticing of Kings and Princes of the earth to commit
fornication with her she cap. 17.4.
had a cup of gold in her hand; a fit vessel for Princes to drink in. This cup
is said to be full of abominations and filthiness of her fornications: like
such harlots as make amatorie potions of their filthiness, causing Princes and
people to receive at her hands most filthy idolatry, even to worship the
Dragon the devil in idols which are masked under the names of Saints, and
other beastly life contrary to the Can. 8.2. Prou. 9.5.
Church of Christ, which gives spiced wine, and new wine of Pomegranets. She
is also said to have a cup in her hand full of abominations, because she
cap. 14.8. cap. 18.3.
made all nations to drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornications,
contrary to God, who Psalm. 75.8.
causes all the wicked of the earth to wring out, and drink the dregs of
his cup of wrath. So cap. 18.23.
that with her enchantments were deceived all nations.

That the things here spoken are understood of Fulkes sermon at Hampton Court.
Rome, Tertullian, Hierome, Ambrose, Primasius, are witnesses: yea Genebrard

speaking of the dilaceration and wounding of the Empire, and of the sacking
and burning of Rome by the Goths, etc. (which was when Rome was Christian)
says, so was fulfilled that in 17. Apocalypse, v. 16. And the ten horns are
ten Kings, they shall hate the where, etc. Confessing Christianed Rome to be
the where truly, though he missed in the application of the place to that time.

As concerning her name, it is said that it was written in her cap. 17.5.
forehead, that is, openly that every man may read it.

Her first name is A mystery, which word Mysterious is written in the fore
part of the Popes Miter or Crown, to signify that Popery was like the
learning of the Eusebius.
Gnostocks, some great mystery for spiritual signification: as if the (Regna
mundi) kingdoms of the world were set upon his holy head.

Her second name is cap. 47.5.
Great Babylon, which is a name very properly given, being Otho. Frism. l. 6.
c. 22. Rhemenses in 1. Pet. 4. Babylon. Lact^^.
so like for the beginning and progress as might be to Babylon. For not only
after Ramulus hither under civil Princes, but also from hence under the Popes
for magnificence, Monarchy, amplitude of dominions, etc. Rome may justly be
compared to Babylon.

But this Ecclesiastical Monarchy beginning here is compared to Babel in her
first building. For as at the beginning when Babel was built, the Lord
confounded the Genesis 11.7.
language of the builders, that every one perceived not another languages so
was this policy of Romes greatness built up in the time of Antichrist by
people of diverse languages, whereof the one understood not the other: namely,
the people under the ten kingdoms which did arise upon the inundation of
these strangers. Yea Rome understood not the language of her own religion.

For they Sabel. En. 8. lib. 5.
left off to speak latin at Rome upon the coming of the Lombards. And the
Greek and the Hebrew grew clean out of knowledge in a small time: and Caesar
bell. Gal. lib. 6.
like the Druides they would not suffer their religion to be known to the
vulgar people. And herein she is contrary to the Christian Church, which was
built up by the Act. 2.
gift of tongues, whereby the Teachers speak unto every one in his own
language. Again it is called Babylon by comparison of the cruelty which the
Babylonians used in captiuing the Christians, Deuteronomy. 28.49.
speaking to them and Isa. 28.11.
teaching them in a strange language, as they did the Jews. Therefore it is
also called cap. 11.8.
Egypt.

Thirdly, she is called That mother, by excellency the mother of all other
Churches, like unto the Cataphrygians; arrogating to herself to be the only
conceiuer and bringer forth of the children of the Church. This is a name in
which the Church of Rome does glory in, wherefore they that follow the Church
do call her Sab. En. 8.6. in Bonifa. 3. c. Decr. tit. 3. c. 23.
the mother, and queen, and mistress. The Volat. l. 22. f. 255. a.
Bishop of Rome was wont to write himself the Bishop of the Church of Rome;
much better than now (as Volateran thinks) when he writes himself The
Bishop of the Catholic Church. For if the Roman be the Catholic, they then
seem to take the honor from that famous city.

But whatsoever she thinks of herself, Saint John says cap. 17.5.
that she is the mother of the whoredoms and abominations of the earth. Which
Saint Paul expresses by the name of 2. These. 2.3.
the man of sin. For all the heads of the government of Rome were
blasphemous, none truly religious, (howsoever now and then, very rarely, some
godly man was in authority.) And in the time of Saint John, See Ruff. Soc.
Eusebius. etc.
all the abomination and idolatry, which was enforced upon the Christians,
came from Rome. So also from this time forth, Rome stands cheefely upon this
point, that all nations must receive the ordinances of the Church, as she has
conceived them. Which yet (for the most part) are whoredoms, for superstition,
idolatry, and abominable treasons, murders, adulteries, etc. which she has
conceived of heretics, tyrants, and other ungodly persons. Insomuch that there
is nothing so abominable in all the earth, formerly condemned in ancient
heretics, but she is willing to conceive it, and bring it forth; if it may any
wise help to further her greatness. So that Rome is henceforth, an Epitome of
all abominable heresies. The beast that she sits upon, and does bear her
up in this wonderful pride, is described by his original, name, and form.

As concerning the place of his original, he is said to cap. 11.7. and cap.
17.8.
ascend out of the bottomless pit; that is, to arise to the greatness of
Babylon, by the opinion which the world had of him, that as he boasted, so he
had great authority in the bottomless pit, and power (like the Liui. dec. 1.
lib. 1.
pontifex Maximus of Numa his inuenting) to pacify the spirits in the behalf
of those which were dead.

For whereas Pelagius the Pope had brought into the Mass prayer for the dead,
out of the corruptions of some former ages; especially seeing the world to
stand so much affected with the Monks of See Gregor. Draba. l. 2. etc.
Benedicts institution, tha took much upon them, as though they were able to
profit the dead; this kind of doctrine of the power that priests had, to do
the dead much good, was brought into the Church; and taught very diligently;
and enforced by the lying signs of the apparition of souls that were
departed; and diverse pretended revelations, which the dead coming from the
bottomless pit should show unto the living, etc. whereupon the ignorant and
foolish world was led captive to this beast, to make it great by the subjection
of many unto this his doctrine of the bottomless pit. It may also be said to
rise out of the bottomless pit, N.D. ans. S. F.H.
for the dark and deep schoole-learning, cap. 2.24.
or profoundnes of Satan which it teaches; leaving the plain and easy
doctrine of the Scriptures, the more easily to delude the world with
difficulties and subtilties.

The name of this beast, is cap. 13.14.
an image of the beast which was wounded with the sword, and did live again;
namely the image of the civil monarchy or Empire which was wounded with the
sword of the Goths, and other strangers; but did live by means of the
Papacy. Now because the sins of the Arian Princes, Constantine, Constantius,
Julian, and Valens, were the cause why God in his just judgment, did make the
Empire in the West, and especially in Rome of which they gloried, to be
abolished; this beast is the image of the Empire, as it was corrupted with
heresy: wherefore this is Geneb. 552. 553.
a Monarchy, not civil in the hands of Emperors, but Ecclesiastical, under
him who has horns like the Lamb. For the government of the Church of Rome is
called an Ecclesiastical Monarchy. For Hist. ant. ex Pom. laet. p. 347
Rome, the very goddess of all lands, and queen of all nations, does seem
to require the seats and Empire both of God and of mankind.

And this is the cap. 17.9.10.11.
seventh head, or form of kingdom or government of Rome. For in the time of
Saint John, the Sovereignty, first of Kings, second Consuls, third Decemuiri,
fourth Dictators, fifth Triumuiri, were fallen; one was, namely the Emperors
being the sixth; and now the Empire being wounded to death, steppeth up this
beast, the seventh. Whereof the Pope standing a while, as a Prince, is an
eight, and is one of the seven, being a member of this beast.

As touching the form of this beast, he is said to have cap. 17.3.
seven heads and ten horns; herein, both like unto the Dragon, which
represented the heathen Empire; and also like the other monstrous beast which
represented the pretended Christian Empire, which was corrupted with heresy.
And because this is said to be the image of the latter beast, as that was of
the Dragon, it is implied that this beast has also mouths as Lions for force
and majesty; body like the Pantheresse, for swiftnes, inamouring, deceiving,
and inchaunting such which are to be deluded by her; and feet like unto Bears
feet, for strong and sure marching, and covetousness etc. And as into the
description of the cap. 17.1.
other beast, so into this is to be supplied out of Dan. 7.1.7.19.
Daniel, that his teeth were of iron and his nails of brass, which devoured
brake in pieces, and stampeth the residue under feet, even cap. 9.11.
Abaddon and Apollyan, and therefore is called by Saint Paul 2. These. 2.3.
the son of perdition; wherefore this beast does bear the image of that
which signified the corrupted Empire. So that, See Ruff. Soc. Soz^m. Theod.
what shifting, perjury, dissimulation, Soc. 8. 13.
spreading of false rumors, cruelty, etc. to be found in the stories of the
Arian Princes and Bishops: the same is revived in this beast. And whereas this
beast, by reason of the number of heads and horns, is likewise in a manner
compared to the Dragon; what superstition, tyranny, and persecution is found
in the stories of the heathen persecutors, the same in his time is revived by
this beast. And this is the cause, that this beast is called by the k name of
the Gentiles. Wherefore the Pope is the Liui. det. 1. l. 4.
Pont. Max. of Numaes devising unto whom were committed the ceremonies of
divine services and of funerals, with the order to pacify the spirits, in the
behalf of them which were dead. And so at this time men cap. 17.8.
wondered at the beast that was in the time Numa, and is not in the time of
Saint John, and yet is and was in the time of Saint John, in title, in the
Emperors; who called themselves Pontifices Maximi. The rest of the Clergy,
represent the other magistrates and people, which did in the time of the
Gentiles govern the policy of Rome.

civil and Ecclesiastical, are altogether borrowed of the Gentiles, Jews,
Barbarians, Arians, etc. Lud. Viues test. Chemnicio in examine.
There can no difference be showed, but that only the names of the things be
changed. His cap. 17.9.10.
seven heads are those seven policies, by which Rome was governed; and those
seven hills, upon which it was built; of which has been spoken in the
description of the Dragon before. Cap. 1.

His cap. 17.12.
ten horns are ten Kings, or principalities, which in John's time had not
received the kingdom; but did receive power as Kings at one hour with the
beast; this Monarchical dignity of the Church of Rome, that is, those ten
kingdoms, or commonwealths, which arose out of the former inundation of
strangers.

Furthermore this beast is said to cap. 17.3.
be scarlet colored, herein differing from the other which was white spotted,
little eyes of black. For this is red like the Panthers of Syria, and Africa,
or rather like the red Dragon; signifying that this beast has more authority,
and is more bloody then were the Arians. For cap. 18.24.
in her is found all the blood that is shed upon the earth.

This cap. 17.3.
beast is full of names of blasphemies, as a Pantheresse is full of spots. For
all manner of persons in this hierarchy, from the greatest to the least, do
open their mouths to blaspheme, curse, slander, lie, scoff, etc. And as they
be ever blasphemous, more or less; so they spare no persons nor things. For
they blaspheme cap. 13.6.
God, his name his tabernacle, and them that dwell in heaven, yet were the
Arians not so bad; for the beast representing them, cap. 13.1.
had names of blasphemies on his heads, only the Princes, and some chief
persons being blasphemous; the rest ignorantly religious or not so blasphemous.

The other enemy is cap. 12.7.
Michael with cap. 6.2.
his horsemen; and as he is the cap. 17.14.
Lamb; and they that are on his side, called and chose, and faithful. By
these the Lamb brings a double woe upon the inhabitants of the earth, and
the sea, which are subject to the Roman Ecclesiastical Empire.

The first woe is three fould, which the Lamb Jesus Christ inflicteth as he is
the Priest, the King, and Prophet of his Church.

As he is the Priest of the Church, he causes cap. 9.13.
four Angels, or fierce and irresistable nations, to be loosed against them
that dwell upon the earth.

To this purpose first is sounded the cap. 9.13. The sixth Trumpet.
sixth Trumpet, that is, a sixth kind of doctrine is brought forth into the
world; to wit the doctrine of the bottomless pit, which was never heard of in
the Church of God before. A doctrine of the Gentiles; henceforth, in some sort
common to the papacy with the Mahumetans. But the former heresies they share
between them thus. What has been heretically taught against the Trinity, the
Mahumetanes take up. What against piety, or holiness, the popish beast does
embrace.

Hereupon is heard a commandment to loose these Angels; and then the
execution of the commandment does follow.

Of the commandment, first is showed the place from whence it came, and then
the matter commanded.

As for the place, Saint John says cap. 9.13.
I heard a certain voice from the four horns of the golden Altar which is
before God; meaning that he heard the voice from Christ Jesus, as he is the
high Priest; the Mediator to make reconciliation between God and man. For that
was signified by the Leuit. 16.16. Heb. 9.24.
goulden Altar in the Tabernacle. Now because that from hence comes not an
assurance of reconciliation; but a curse; It is an argument that the world had
corrupted the doctrine of the reconciliation of Christ, either in his person;
or otherwise by offering their prayers by Leuit. 10.1.
strange fire, with the affections of men; as did Nadab and Abihu; or arrogated
the Numb. 16.21.
priests office, as Chorah, Dathan and Abiram; or making themselves mediators
by the merit of their prayers. See Ruff. Soc. Soz. Theod. etc.
The doctrine of the person of Christ, had been horribly corrupted in the East,
by the Arians, Acatians, Eutychians, Nestorians, etc. by reason of which
blasphemy, they were so far from obtaining reconciliation by Jesus Christ;
as that contrariwise they had procured a curse and judgment. So likewise in
the West he was made intercessor for the dead; and others also were joined with
him in the office of intercession, as the virgin Mary, Peter, Paul, etc. as if
he himself were insufficient, etc. which also caused this fearful curse to
be sent upon the Empire in the West, to vex it etc.

The matter of the commandment is, cap. 9.14.
that the sixth Angel which had the Trumpet, should loose the four Angels which
were bound at the great river Euphrates, that is, that those four nations of
the Persians, Saracens, Turks, or Parthians, and Tartars, or Sarmatians, which
were bound, either by league, or affinity, or the strength of the waters, or
rocks; near to the head stream, or fall of the great river Euphrates; should
be loosed from their bond, by the ministry of Angels, bringing in new
doctrine, so that of friends they should become foes.

The execution of this commandment does follow, by those four nations; both
ready and fierce.

They are said to be ready prepared at cap. 9.15.
an hour, at a day, at a month, and at a year; to wit at every moment; short
and long.

Their fiercenes is this, that cap. 9.16.17.18.19.
coming with millions of horsemen, they both by their Generals, and also by
their Prophets or teachers, command as horrible waste as was made at Genesis
19.24. etc
Sodom, and G^m^rrah, when is was destroyed with fire and brimstone.

Their commission is both cap. 9.15.
to kill the third part of the men, and to bring cap. 8.13.
a woe upon cap. 9.12.20.
the remnant.

The third part of men, is the third part of the Empire, as it was divided
amongst three Princes, the sons of Constantine. And because in the four
first Trumpets, was mention made of a cap. 8.
third part, and that in the second Trumpets interpretation there is set down
by name, a catalogue of a third part; the same is to be repeated here.
Wherefore it is to be thought, that the Turks, etc. must abolish the Christian
faith, in these, and these only countries of the Empire; Eusebius. vita Constan.
4. 43.
Macedonia, Panomia, and in it Soc. 1. 20.
Singidnum, and the cities of them which were called Ma^si, Mysia, Persia,
Bythinia, Thracia, Cilicia, Capadocia, Syria, Mesopotamia, Phaenicia, Arabia,
Palestina, Aegyptus, Africa, Thebani, which the nobles of the Emperors court,
viz. Constantinople. All these are constrained to blaspheme the trinity, under
tyrants, in the same countries, where they sinned against the trinity under
the Gospel.

The other two thirds of the Empire, called the cap. 9.20.21.
remnant must not be killed; but afflicted, for their idolatry, murder,
socery, fornication, and theft.

As Jesus Christ, the Lamb, is cap. 10.1.
King of his Church, he warreth by civil Princes, in whom is a lively type of
the glorious kingdom of Christ, possessing both land and sea, in such sort as
none can take it from him, his feet being pillars of fire.

These civil Princes cap. 10.2.
have in their hand the little book open, that is, they do keep open the
Scriptures, which Antichrist does labor to shut.

By these Christ Jesus, both takes possession of the land and sea; and also
delivers the word of God, to poor afflicted preachers; who renew the
preaching of the Gospel, to people, and nations, and tongues, and many kings of
the ten, etc.

As Christ is Prophet of the Church, he does, as Ezech. 40.3. Zach. 1. 16. and
2.
at the buildings of the Temple, measure the Church of this new building, after
this inundation of the strangers. To this purpose, to these of the spirit of
Saint John, who was in tribulation, cap. 11.1.
is given a reed an ordinary instrument to measure with. But this reed is
said to be like unto a rod, which is an 2. Cor. 11.25.
instrument for the punishment of malefactors, and not like the ordinary
measuring line; to signify, that such as would truly measure the Church,
should do it with the rods with which they had been scourged, as malefactors;
the true Prophets, from hence being commonly esteemed wicked, and therefore
often exposed to tribulation. For now comes the time, of which Christ spoke
when he said, Io. 16.8.
they that kill you shall think they do God good service. cap. 11.1.2.
In this measure he meateth the Temple of God, and the Altar, and them that
worship therein; but casts out the utter court, which also the scripture
calls The temple in which Antichrist does reign.

The speech is taken from the Temple which 1. King. 6.1. etc.
king Solomon built, which was divided into three parts. First the holy, and
holiest places, called by excellency The temple, and contained the Arc, the
Altar of incense, the lamps, and tables of show bread; all which were covered.
Secondly there was the open place, in which was placed the lauer or sea, and
the altar of burnt offerings. The third part was called the 2. Chro. 4.9.
Courts, and was divided into 2. Chr. 6.13. Ezech. 44.19.
the inner court, which was for the Priests; and the utter court where the
King, and Priests, and Prophets, and people did assemble for the service of
God, for instruction, Psalm. 122.4.5 Deuteronomy. 17.8.
and for judgment in doubtful causes; civil and divine.

The doctrine figured cap. 11.2.
in the Temple and altar, which are continued in the profession of the Gospel,
are to be measured and esteemed holy and good, though by Antichrist shut up,
and blasphemed. But that which was represented by the utter Court, namely the
public assemblies, for that which is called the service of God; their courts
of jurisdiction, as far as concerns the causes of the Lord; the Angel
commands S. John to cast out, and all holy men to count them common and
unclean. The reason whereof is, that Joseph. anti. lib 12. c. 6. 1. Macc. 1.
as the temple of the Jews was delivered into the hands of Antiochus Epiphanes;
so by the temeritie and ignorance of Princes, the courts are given to such as
for their manner of rites are but cap. 11.2.
the Gentiles in effect, though in appearance like the Soc. 1. 17.
Maniches, they seem Christians. The manner of their behavior here, is not to
rule with the key of knowledge, Dan. 8.
but to devour, break in pieces, stamp and tread the residue of the holy city
under foot, as Abaddo^ the son of perdition. And although the Papacy from
hence forth corrupts all assemblies with the tyrannies and superstitions of
the Gentiles, and abominations of condemned heretics; yet does 2 Thessalonians.
2.4. August. de ciu. lib. 20. cap. 19.
this Man of Sin here exalt himself, as (if) himself were the temple of
God, and take to himself whatsoever was figured by the temple of Solomon, and
his kingly palace. Howbeit in these courts shall be ever found two witnesses
raised up by the Lord, even a competent number to stablish a truth; who shall
prophecy, by teaching, and co^mination, clothed in sackecloath, poor,
humble, 2. Macc. 2.7.14.
and sorrowful to see the abominations and blasphemies in the Church, by the
Gentiles, etc. Among such therefore is now the Church to be sought for.

These by their cap. 11.4. etc. 10.
testimony must vex the inhabitants of the earth, both by bringing the graces
of the spirit of God upon good men; and therefore are said to be two Olive
trees, and also to give holy light unto them to direct them to the Lord; and
therefore are called two golden candlesticks standing before the God of the
earth: and by bringing heavy affliction upon such as will injury them in
their prophecy. (For their word shall be as fire out of their mouths to
devour their adversaries. And being equal in the power of their ministry
with Elias shall be able to shut the heavens, that it rain not in the days of
their prophecy; and being like unto Moses in Egypt, have power to smite the
earth with all manner of plagues, as often as they will: so that the earth is
plagued because the witnesses of Christ are despised and persecuted.

Yea those two witnesses (called also 144, 000. of those which have the
testimony of Jesus Christ and keep the commandments of God) oppose themselves
in the open courts of the temple, called now the visible Monarchy of the
Church, against the beast; by cap. 14.4.6.8.9.15.18.
innocence, preaching, judgments, and prayer.

The manner of the woman's sitting upon this scarlet colored beast, is, to
tread the holy city under foot. Yea she excels her self in cruelty. For
while she was borne up by heathen Emperors, she was furious and bloody, and
therein as terrible and odious as a red Dragon. But now she cloatheth her
self with blood as with cap. 17.4.6.
purple and scarlet, thinking it her honor, for the service of God to kill the
godly. And herein she is so insatiable, that she is drunken with the blood of
the Saints, and with the blood of the Martyrs of Jesus, and that in admirable
manner. For she does not content her self to kill those that stand against
her, but also condemns their memory, cap. 11.7.9.
not suffering them to be put in monuments.

And though these things, to such as are of the spirit of S. John, do ever
appear; yet outwardly she seems first to make plentiful provision for this
kind of war: and then she joins battle with the Lamb cap. 11.7.9.
and those that follow him. And these things does this beast accomplish with
his wonted lying signs and miracles, with false prophecy and other impostures.

For the more effectual executing of the cap. 12.17.
wrath of the Dragon (which affection he puts on in all his oppositions)
the beast provides himself with the cap. 13.3. etc.
wonderful favor and dependence of the whole earth, which is called by the
name of Christian; as also studieth out a most secure discipline.

The world is said cap. 13.3.
to wonder, greatly admiring the beast, the Papacy, by whose means the
wounded head of Rome recovered life in the Hierarchy.

And also they followed the beast, which was like the Pantheresse. For as when
Gerard. dial. creas. 114.
the Panther which is a beautiful and gentle beast, amongst other wild and
ravenous beasts, does wake, and come out of his den and roar; other beasts
which hear his voice, do gather themselves together and follow the sweetness
of his odor which comes forth of his mouth: so also when this Papacy, who
is beautiful as an harlot, and gentle as Absalom amongst men, does speak
(though it be like the Dragon) all men do gather themselves together, and
follow the words of his mouth, which seem pleasant to those which are
deluded. For from this time, those which before were called cap. 9.3.11.
Locust-scorpions, have set over them a king, the Popes, the angel of the
bottomless pit. For those kingdoms which rose of the inundation of the
Barbarians one after another, began to give respect to the Bishops of Rome.
cap. 17.17.2. These. 2.11.
For God has put in their hearts to fulfill his decree, and to be of one
consent, and to give their kingdoms unto the beast, until the words of God
be fulfilled: and then to hate her.

The favor that this beast found was so great, that the people under these
ten kings or principalities, were contented by his means, even cap. 13.4.
to worship the Dragon the devil: that is, to become as very idolaters (for
the worship of idols is the worship of devils) as those Volat. l. 25. fol. 300.
Gentiles which worshipped Dragons in the temples of Apollo and Juno. For cap.

the Dragon the devil gave power to this beast, howsoever he pretended to have
his power from Christ, by the means of S. Peter. cap. 13.5. cap. 11.2.


The continuance of this battle is 42. months, which after the account of the
Orig. Ephe.

years as the Astronomers do measure by an Equinoctial (which they call a

years. This is that time during which the woman the Church is in the
wilderness, whereas the great whore does sit upon the scarlet colored beast
being hidden among them that follow Antichrist; yet kept from the presence of
the serpent. This time also is the cap. 11.2.

foot by these Antichristian Gentiles; at least in some place. And these also
are the last of these Dan. 8.14. N.B.Da. 8.1.
two thousand and three hundredth years, spoken of by Daniel, which began in
the third year of Belshazzar, which was Brough. Concent.

is to begin in the Papacy of Pelagius 1. Anno Christi 560. who brought in the
fained superstitions of the Gentiles into the Church; so that they end 1820.
All these things will appear in histories following.

The Complement.
In the time of Pelagius, who, as an Angel of the bottomless pit, brought
news into the world, that as it was among the Gentiles a thing much believed;
so it was true among the Christians, that the living were able to help the
dead by Masses, etc. Ann. 560. Aug. Curio. l. 2.

He having been acquainted with the opinions of the Christians, Jews,
heretics, etc. by John a monk of the order of Benedict, and Sergius a
Nestorian was instructed so, that he looked about how under the pretext of
religion he might bring the Arabians subject unto him: Gens. lib. 2.
his religion he boasts to be revealed unto him by Gabriel the Angel. The
scope whereof is, with extreme remedies of fire and sword to bring all to his
law. In his law he promises a new way to bring men to paradise, and deliver
them from the pains of hell, etc. Ann. 562.

some indignities offered unto him by the Emperor and the Emperesse, and
complaints of the Romans, Sab. En. 8. l. 5.

he had sent for to possess Italy. Geneb. p. 645 Fasc. Tem. s. 56
This Pope got Narses to Rome fearing the hurt of Italy by his alienation; and
made him Consul: so that there was great and inward friendship between the
Pope and Narses. m Italy in this Popes time was freed from the yoke of
Constantinople, and the Romans began to rule by Patricij, for the deadly wound
of the beast was healed.

The office of the Exarchie of Rauenna was instituted; his office it was to

In his time John the Bishop of Constantinople by the consent of Mauricius the

These two did contend between themselves, not for religion, but for primacie,
by the overmuch desire of honor, with which their minds were wholly possessed.
But Pelagius (finding the Emperor adverse unto him herein) decreed that Did.

In humility Geneb. p. 662
(to repress the pride of the Bishop of Constantinople) he called himself the
servant of the servants of God; which title also, his successors did use: but
Antonomastice, improperly. Poly. inu^^t. 4. 8.
Whereas before time there were no other titles in the Church, but Priests and
chief Priests: Gregory first divided them into Patriarchs and Archbishops,

which difference was brought in chiefly by the Gentiles, who had Flamines and
Archflamines, etc. Melanct.
He increased two pernicious things in the Church, concerning (the bottomless
pit) invocation of the dead, Libro dialog.
and prayer to the dead. Dial. lib. 4. c. 31. 35. 36. 37 51. 55. 58. etc.
He first digested in a book, and commended to the Church by many deceitful
miracles and revelations; to further the new doctrine, which they say is found
out of the state of the dead. Herein trusting the reports of some which heard
the things reported by others, that some came from the dead. Hereby the Poets
fables become good divinity; it being now acknowledged that the river Acherou
is in hell, where also a judge sits like Minos, Eachus, and Radamanthus;
purgatory in Aetna, and in bathes, etc. that the dead might be helped by
masses, burials in Churches, prayers of Monks, and Priests. Lib. dial. 4. cap.
41.
The reason which he renders why so many things are now discovered of the
souls of dead men, which hitherto lay hid, is, that the end of the world is
at hand, and as it were in fight. Take 2. These 2.1.^ Luke 21.8. Isaiah 47.10.
heads and be not deceived, for many will come in my name and say, I am, and
the time draws near, follow ye not them therefore. In this book is
delivered this doctrine. As Dial. 4. c. 5.
the soul is known to live in the body by the motion of the members; so the
life of the soul of the Saints, when it is out of the body, is to be esteemed
by the virtue of miracles. And ibid. c. 20.
that the merit of the soul sometimes is not showed when it departs from the
body; but is declared more truly after death. (A ready foundation for such
Priests and Monks which had the keeping of the places of burials, to build up
the credit of their impostures, about graves, as if they were miracles. And for
them to obtrude unto the world, whom they liked, to be only reputed as Saints.

This book of Dialogues, is so contrary to the Revelation of Saint John; that
it may justly be 2. These. 2.6.
called the Revelation of Antichrist. This kind of learning served so to raise
the beast out of the bottomless pit; that some do say, that Gregory (to show
this power of the beast in the bottomless pit) recalled Traian Pet. de Natal.
and alij.
from hell, baptized him and sent him to heaven, A cup full of abominations,
etc. He was Lib. 9. epl. 9.71.

she is drunken with blood) for both himself, his wife, and children were
murdered by Phocas. Which Lib. 11. Epist. 1. 36. 43. 44.
was no sooner don, but Gregory (as accessory) with the Clergy, sung gloria in

Phocas, and Leontia his wife, into the Church of Casarius; the whole Clergy
shouting for joy, and singing Exandi Christ; Phoca Augusto, and Leontia
Augusta vita. And as the forerunner of Antichrist wrote to Leontia, to make
especially S. Peter the protector and patron of the Empire in earth; and
intercessor in heaven (meaning that the Bishop of Rome should be in greatest
estimation) (for the beast rises out of the earth) This Pope like the Ang.

the four general Councels as the Did. 15. sicut.

accursed every one, which brake the least thing, which the Pope commanded,
and obeyed it not altogether. He caused Volat. lib. 22. f. 251.
the ancient monuments in Rome, to be cast into Tiber; least by their beauty,
they should distract men, from the religion newly instituted. In his Aug.

whosoever durst gainesay his law, should be slain. Many of his kinsfolks,

one indeed, as he professed himself, and would seem to be; followed him in
the year 593. So in the West, the Geneb. p. 661.
Lombards, English, Spaniards, Venetians, Ligurians, etc. received the faith of
the Church of Rome, and followed her. This Pope Beda. Eccl. hist. l. 1. cap.

sent Augustine into England, to convert the English men. They which were sent
(like those that built Babel) neither understood the Scriptures, nor the
language of the people. The first point of religion which they showed was this.
They spread forth a banner with a painted crucifixe, and so came in procession
to the King, singing the Letanie in a strange tongue, and showing some
(deceitful) miracles. He labored to reduce the whole land to the example of
Rome, as Montanus did all Churches to Pepuza, etc; and therefore became enemy
to the seven Churches of the Britones, who followed the custom of the East
Churches; and would not submit themselves to his pride, but ( cast him out and
measured him not as a man of God) because he learned not of Christ to bear his
yoke. who was humble and meek. He wrote to Augustine, Bed. eccl. hist. l. 2.

that the Clergy should in quinquagesima, abstain from flesh, milk, meats,

he would not subscribe to the Council, for correcting the sixth Council at

Constantinus was Plat. f. 103. b
so favored by Justinian the tyrant, that because Felix the Archbishop of

her fornication.) He Frisin. 5. 14. Geneb. p. 706.

that no money should be current which had the name of an heretical Emperor
upon it, nor his letters, name, or figure received; nor his image carried into
the Church, nor his name remembered at Mass. Thus does the beast labor to
establish the worship of the Dragon, and the Emperor drinks of the wine of
the fornication of the great whore.

of Jupiter Dodonaeus was wont to be much frequented by the Gentiles for help,
which they there received by touching of Pyrrhus great toe, there kept in a
gilt box, because miraculously it was unburned when the rest of his body was
consumed with fire. The Pope would not have his S. Peter's any whit inferior to
it. For Bergo. 10.
he built a chapel in S. Peter's Church, in which he laid up some relics in
a manner of all the Saints, and caused Mass to be said there every day. He
also brought the clause of relics into the Canon of the Mass. The Saraceus

that if the Pope be never so badde, neither doing, nor speaking any thing that

CHAP. VII.
Of the blasphemy of the scarlet colored beast, and woman thereon; and first
how they are blasphemous in their own persons.

THe beast having attained unto this great power, and dependence, abuses his
authority of speaking to blaspheme; and his power of doing unto tyranny. For
it is said he cap. 13.6.7.
therefore opened his mouth unto blasphemy, and to make war with the Saints.

He is blasphemous every way; and that first in respect of his own
conversation, which henceforth is very flagitious. For from this time the Popes
do grow to such wickedness, and impiety, as was never heard the like; no not
in Simon Magus or his posterity.

Secondly he is blasphemous in his doctrine; and that concerning God and his
worship.

Simon Magus was noted for a singular blasphemer, that durst affirm Act. 8.9.
of himself, that he himself was some great man; but the Popes like the
Prince of Tyrus has his heart exalted, and says. I am a Ezech. 28.2.
god, I sit in the seat of God, in the mids of the sea, the multitude of
people. Yea, he thinks in his heart tha the is equal with God: 2. These. 2.4.
Aug. ciuit. d^ 20. 19.
For he exalts himself against all that is called God, or that is
worshipped, so that he does sit as God, and as if he were the Temple and Church
of God.

And now popery being an absolute complement of all abominable heresies, that
can be brought to any tolerable appearance, cap. 13.6.
does blaspheme God, his name, his Tabernacle, and them that dwell in heaven.
For now is come into the world, 2. Tim. 3.2.
that perilous time in which men become cursed speakers. And unto their
blasphemy they add the persecution of the Saints. These things are to be
marked as they follow in the stories at several times.

They are said to blaspheme the name of Mand. 3.
God, which directly commit blasphemy against the person of the Godhead, or
else blaspheme any persons or things, upon which God is named: wherefore the
name of God is blasphemed, when Princes are blasphemed; seeing that unto them,
the Lord Exodus 22.28. Psalm. 81.1.
has communicated his own name.

Those do blaspheme his Tabernacle, which speak evil Act. 7.44. etc. 2.
King. 18.30, 35.
of the place where God is worshipped, according to his own ordinance; and the
worship which God has appointed in his word, and Sacraments; or where Iere.
7.4.10.11.12.
that is ascribed unto his Church, which he never gave unto it; as to exalt it
or any person thereof to a greater place then to be obedient unto his word.

They which dwell in heaven are blasphemed, when that which is proper to God,
is ascribed unto them; as to be patrones, illuminers, mediators, etc. or any
Psalm. 74.12. Isai. 42.3.
helpers of those which are below; Gal. 1.8.
when Angels are made preachers of a new Gospel, or receivers of Col 2.18.
worships; and the Saints departed Luke 16.24.26.
are supposed to ease those in hell, etc. especially, when they are reported to
further the ambition and malice of men, etc. These and such like blasphemies is
this beast guilty of, from this time forth.

The opposition of the Lamb does still continue, killing cap. 9.15.
of the third part of men; and bringing a was upon the remnant, by the four
Angels, which are loosed from Euphrates. As cap. 10.2.
also Christ the King by Princes does still hold open the book of the Gospel,
and set his foot upon the land and sea, as proprietary and true owner of both
country and people.

And because the beast does labor, not only to exempt cap. 13.12.14.
himself from the subjection of Christ, in the ministry of Princes; but does

The Pope fortified the ruined city of Ostia, against the Saracens, and
commanded the name thereof to be Gregoriopolis, but after the Popes death it
lost this new name. The Emperor Ludouicus held Plat. f. 127.
a Council of many Bishops, to the honor of God, and profit of the
Ecclesiastical dignity. In which was decreed, that neither the Bishop nor the
Clergy of any degree should wear any precious and costly garments, silks,
scarlets, or embroderies, nor any gold or silver on their girdles or slippers,
nor use Fox Mar^y. page 138.

Anno 844.
Swines snowte, for Carain f. 334. and alij.

began the custom to change their names. As if he Poly. Jri. 4. 7.
be a malefactor, he may call himself Bonifacius; if a coward, he may be
called Leo; for a carter Vrbanus; for a cruel man, Clemens. This Pope was
created Gobel. ae. 6. cap. 45. p. 197.
without the consent of the Emperor, but the Emperor sending a mighty army
against Rome (setting his fiery feet on the sea and land, and roaring as a
Lion) compelled the Romans to swear alleagance unto the Emperor. And after
upon diverse conditions, confirmed Pope Sergius. In this Popes time, the brother
of this Pope, usurped Ecclesiastical authority, being a lay man. Simonie was
so common, that even Bishoprics were sold to him that would give most. And
because there was no Christian that would correct these evils; God sent his
whip the Paganes, to revenge the sins of the Christians. The Saracens came
and killed innumerable people, and burned many cities. A horrible Fasc. Temp.

plague is upon Rome, and all Italy. For certain perfidious Christians sent

Apostles is made a Swine fly.

the Arabians raised three persecutions against the Christians in Spain.

Constantinople; invaded Dalmat^a, took the island Lipara, and do much hurt to

faith given to the Emperor, waxes every day worse, and gathers forces
against the Emperor. Was this the Vicar of Christ, and Peter's successor?
Otho returns to Rome, and (crying as when a Lion roareth) in a great Synod,
by the consent of the Clergy, Nobles, and people of Rome, deposes the Pope,
as a monster and bondslaue of the devil; and placed Leo the eight in his
stead, causing the Romans to swear that they would never depart from the
obedience of Leo, nor choose any Pope without the consent of the Emperor, and
his son. The Emperor discharges his army. John promises the Romans, that
if they would kill the Emperor, and the Pope Leo, he would give them all the
Church treasury. The Romans rise against the Emperor, and are killed without
mercy, or number. The Emperor takes hostages of the rest; which at the
petition of the Pope Leo, were restored again. When the Emperor was departed,

of Germany that would be set over the poisoners of Italy; he sent an Aleman
to take the place, named afterward Leo the ninth.

Thus are the Popes become a blasphemous beast; and are so far from repenting
themselves of their idolatry, murder, sorcerie, fornication, etc. that for
these things the Angels about the river Euphrates do by the revenging hand of
God bring a lamentable woe unto them; and civil Princes do set their fiery
feet upon them.

CHAP. VIII.
How when the Emperors had roared as a lion, the beast cries them down with
7. thunders; blaspheming Princes, and making war against the Saints: with his
victory.

HItherto the beast, the Popes, have opened their mouths to blasphemy; being
blasphemous in doctrine and behavior, both in word and deed prodigious
monsters. Hitherto also the Lord Jesus by the Emperors, as by an angel in a
cloud, etc. has taken possession of the people by violence; and of the soil,
by force and authority. He also by severe laws had (as it were) cried, as
when a Lion roareth, threatening their destruction that would offer to exclude
him from any part of that his possession.

It now follows hereupon, to consider how the beast behaueth himself in his
manner of fight. And this is contained in cap. 10.3.
seven blasphemous thunders that do utter their voices, and cap. 13.6.
in other blasphemies and wars against the Saints, etc.

By the voices of thunders are understood such strong declamations, which do
breed as fearful emotions and peril among men, as a violent storm does in
the air; and does terrify men, and beat them from their places, as if they
were stricken with thunderbolts. The Popes and such Geneb. in Siluest. 1. and
Pio 5. and alii.
as follow them, delight to call the Popes execrations, excommunications, and
proscriptions, by the name of thunders, as Fulmen papale. Wherefore these
thunders do signify such troubles, as came upon the Empire by the Popes
excommunications and execrations, etc.

These thunders are said to be cap. 10.3.4.
7. in number. For howsoeeuer the Popes did excommunicate more than 7.
Emperors; yet did they prevail to hurt and remove or subdue but seven.
Curio. f. 198. b
All these were excommunicated in order by the Popes, when as they were most
mighty Caesar's, and very courageous, and accomplished great and excellent
affairs. 1. Henricus the fourth: 2. Henricus the fifth: 3. Fridericus the
first: 4. Philippus: 5. Otho the fourth: 6. Fridericus the second: 7. Conradus.
The rest despised, or escaped the danger.

Besides blasphemous thunders, whereby godly Princes be terrified; the beast
does proceed to cap. 13.6.
blaspheme the tabernacle of God, that is, that very worship of God, which is
Heb. 8.5. Exodus 25.40.
according to Gods own ordinance and word, is accused to be heresy,
filthiness, sedition, rebellion, etc. Like as the wicked Eus. 3.17. and 4. 7.
and 9.5.7.
heathen, and heretics have done, whose steps this beast does follow.

He also does blaspheme them cap. 13.6.
that dwell in heaven, that is, such which are truly faithful professors of
the Gospel of the kingdom of heaven, having their Phil. 3.20.
conversation and affections in heaven. Unto these are many foul and horrible
crimes objected, if they be any way opposite to their unrighteousness, or
ungodliness. And herein they follow the Arians, Ruff. 1. 17. Theod. 1. 25. 27.
19. Soc. 2. 21. etc.
that blasphemed Athanasius, Macarius, etc. which were enemies to their heresy
and cruelty. This is a good warrant to us to think, that when the Popes do
curse Princes and their clients, in their judicial proceedings, and written
books, do impute many impieties and evils to those, that by the profession of
the Gospel are their adversaries; these reproves are but causeles reproaches,
blasphemies, slanders and lies. So that still in them, the devil does accuse
the brethren, as he did in the times of the heathen Emperors, and Arian
heretics.

He does also abuse the great authority which is given him, to cap. 13.7.
Make war with the saints: namely, both by persecutions, when they do submit
themselves; and by arms when they stand for their lives. Herein following the
heathen Emperors, and Theod. 2. 14. Soc. 2. 22. 23. 30. Eus. 15. 1.

The severity of discipline which he has found out, is in cruel laws of

is given to him (the Pope that false Prophet) to give life unto the image of
the beast, the popish ecclesiastical Monarchy, in the hands of Bishops, and
popish Princes: for unto this time, the Papacy was subject to Princes, and for
their lewd conditions were so severely kept in awe that they were but dead
hearted. But henceforth, they by the Popes means take unto themselves stout
stomachs. And by their stoutnes get power cap. 13.15.
that the image of the beast (the popish Hierarchy) should speak and make
such laws, as under which, both Prince and people should be subject.

Their first law is confiscation of life; to Ibid.
cause that as many as would not worship the beast (the popish ecclesiastical
Monarchy) should be killed. By this it appears, that howsoever by any
necessity the Papists do promise and swear peace, obedience and subjection
to Princes; or give faith and safe conduct to others; yet the resolution
concluded upon, and drifted is, when time and place shall serve, after the
example of Curio. lib. 1.
Mahomet, by all manner of means, to kill Prince and people, that are any
impediment to their religion or tyranny. For this is a monster, compounded of
three such beasts, as cannot be tamed by any art of man. Yea, the manner of
their killing is beastlike: for as they fill their bellies, gase on the rest,
and do not suffer any thing of their pray to lie hid in the earth: No more
does this popish beast suffer them that they have slain to be put in cap. 11.9.
graves nor any moniments; but gase, and stare upon them, exposing them to all
men as an unnatural spectacle: contrary to the holy captain Ioshuah, Josh.
8.29. and 10 27.
who, Deuteronomy. 21.23
according to the law, would not have his enemies hang any longer than sunset,
and then cast heaps of stones upon them for a memorial.

The second law is confiscation of goods, cap. 13.17.
that no man might buie or sell save he that has one of his three privileges:
which are these; first, The mark of the beast: secondly, The name of the
beast: thirdly, The number of his name. Polychronicon lib. 4. cap. 25.
Such kind of laws made the heathen persecutors, against those Christians
that refused their superstitions.

A mark or character does signify such signatures as men use to brandon
Columella lib. 11. cap. 1.
distinguish sorts of beasts, from another, or a man's own from other men's.
Geneb (...) ^8 737.
Such do the Mahumetanes use to set upon men. The Papists have many sorts of
them, as crosses, granae benedicta, holy water, chrisme, and diverse other such
superstitious signioles. By many of them, they distinguish (as with a brand)
their faction from others. Herein they follow the steps of the Sozom. 7. 17
Arians, whose image they be: for they used secret marks in their letters,
when they seriously commended any to be received into communion amongst them.

Of this mark it is said particularly, that cap. 13.16.
he (namely the Popish ecclesiastical Hierarchy) made all, both small and
great, rich and poor, free and bend, to receive a mark (or character) in
their right hands, or foreheads. This is clearly to be seen in the popish
Church. For first since their law of confirmation was made, Polyd. Inuen. 5. 3.
the Bishop with the Chrisme does sign the party in the forehead with the
character of the cross. And secondly, since they made their new office or
sacerdotall, thus they make their catechumine. Ordo faciendi Catechumenum.
The child, or party, is brought to the Church doors, where the Priest makes
a cross with his thumb on the forehead of the child, saying, Signum
saluatoris domini nostri Jesus Christi, in frontem tuam pono. And at the font,
the Priest makes the sign of the cross in the right hand of the child, etc.
saying, Trade tibi signaculum domini nostri Jesus Christi, in manu tua dextra.
Yea, so careful are they this way, that if any travail amongst them, in his
pasport they mention some mark of their face or hand, etc. as cum cicatrice in
vola dextrae manus, etc. or some such like.

The word Calepini in Nomen.
Name amongst the humane writers of the time in which Saint John did write,
does signify glory, estimation, a faction. Then the phrase, interpreted by
the Gentiles, whom this beast does imitate, does signify, that none may buy or
sell, but such as will receive glory, and estimation from him, and be of his
faction, or make payment of money to him, etc.

Specially by his Name are meant the Bulls, and letters patents of the Popes,
which from this time especially, begin with the Popes name. Under the
privilege of the Popes Bull, Turks, Jews, Mores, etc. may buy and sell,
though they do not submit themselves to their superstitions by taking the
mark of the beast.

The word Number, among humane writers, does signify diverse orders, states
and degrees, etc. Then they may not buie, etc. That will not take any order in
the popish Ecclesiastical Monarchy. Hitherto belong the orders of Knights,
Soldiers, Friars, etc. with all these several ranks of them that serve to
advance his greatness.

Particularly, it is said of his number, cap. 13.18.
Let him that has wit count the number of the beast, for it is the number
Numerus hominis, for numerus humanus, an hebraisme.
of man (peculiarly serving to number men by) and his number is six hundred
sixty six. By this number 666. Geneb. p. 656
Genebrard, Reg in hunc locum.
and Nicola^is Zegerus two Docters of the Church of Rome, do understand the
Military number of the ancient Roman Legion: unto which, they say, Saint John
does allude; to note that Antichrist here spoken of, is a Legionarie Martial
and bloody king; which does establish his laws, not by preaching, but by
force, and arms. This interpretation seems to be most to the purpose. For
the Cohortes of the Roman legion were Geneb. p. 5. 59
called Numeri. So were the Exempla Plinij.
orders of Tribunes; and the Leaders of a legion Geneb. p. 656
were 666. Namely Vegetius Polybius, etc.
600. Decurians: 60. Centurians, and six Tribunes. Yea, there is none of the
propositions, which can be made by the connection of this word Number to any
part of the sentence where it is mentioned in this prophecy, but it may be
justified by this interpretation. For example, to be a soldier for the Pope,
is a privilege to buy and sell, and makes him capable of the greatest grace
the Church of Rome can give. It is the number of man. It is cap. 15.2.
a number over which the victory may be got. And as to be of a legion was
peculiar to such as fought for Rome, so now these soldiers are for the Church
of Rome. Lastly, as Vegetius lib. 2. cap. 19
in a Roman legion, were schools which required learned and witty soldiers;
for the condition of the whole legion, their services, and Military numbers,
etc. or paiements were more diligently written in acts, then any other
affairs; so in popery, Let him that has wit count the Military number of
the beast, for the services done for the honor and advancement of that
policy are most carefully written up, even in their Legend or catalogue of
saints, where none else does come, be he never so good.

Thus is the beast now in his pride, furnished with horns like the Lamb,
accounted the Vicar of Christ. He spaketh like the Dragon for terror,
blasphemy, and doctrine of devils: he exercises the power of the first beast
before him, playing the part of an Emperor before his face, admirable for
deceitful signs and lying miracles, done by sorcerie, and the power of the
devil. Now does he publish decrees, capital laws, and has all priueledges
of earth, Purgatory and Heaven, to bestow at his pleasure. How fearful then
must be his thundrings, and how bloody his wars?

The Lamb, who hitherto as opportunity served, cap. 6.2. etc.
warred against his enemies, by the word, the sword, famine, pestilence, etc.
does still continue the same kind of oppositions, when it seems good. He also
continues to cap. 9.13. etc
vex the remnant for idolatry, murder, theft, fornication, etc. as in former
times.

He further had vexed this Antichristian beast, taking possession of the people
and soil, by civil Princes, in whom cap. 10.3. etc.
he roared as a Lion; as also by his two cap. 11.3. etc
witnesses. But now as the devil has advanced the malice and greatness of this
beast; so the Lamb, Christ Jesus, does declare himself more mighty in his
oppositions.

The civil Princes do labor to keep their authority and possession; do
bring to light the truth of that which the thunders have spoken; and deliver
the book of the word of God to such poor Preachers, as do make a conscience
of the same, and are ready to suffer for it.

In the prophecy of discovering the truth of that, which the confused and
tumultuous thunders have spoken, cap. 10.4.
are these things to be considered. First, a desire of those of the spirit of
Saint John, to record them as they were: as he says, I was about to write
them, plainly for every man to understand. Secondly, the impediment that
hindered the clear delivery, which was, that all wise men and godly, as by a
voice from heaven advised, by reason of the perils of the times, to seal up
those things which the seven thunders have spoken; truly reporting them, but
covered over with parables, etc. as Prophets do the visions, which are not to
be understood of all. Hereupon it is, that the histories of these later times
do deliver the truth; yet in such sort, as very few can pick it out by
them, the face of the story looking one way, and the truth another way.
Thirdly, the Lord Jesus, in the person of this Angel presenting the civil
Magistracy, cap. 10.5.6.
swears not by Idols nor supposed saints, as the idolatrous beast does, but
by him that lives for ever, and created all things; that the time should never
more be so perilous as then; but that in the days of the seventh Angel, that
conuerteth Kings to the gospel, the mystery of God, in bringing Antichrist
into the world, shall be finished, when it shall be as lawful for men to
preach and write the plain truth, as ever it was declared by the servants of
God, the Prophets.

As concerning the delivery of the book of Gods word to Preachers: first, it
is said, that all godly men perceiving a better course to consume Antichrist
by, than to write his story plain, do, as cap. 10 8.
a voice from heaven, bid those of the spirit of Saint John, to leave the huge
volumes of Legends, decrees and decretals, etc. and go and take the book (of
the Scriptures) which is open in the Angels hand, presenting the Magistracy,
though it be shut to all others.

Hereupon godly men, which suffered tribulation as Saint John did in Patmos,
do by humble petition crave cap. 10.9.
that the Angel standing, as proprietarie, upon the sea and earth, governing
people and countries, would give them the little book of the word of God.

This petition is granted, but in this manner. The Princes bid the Preachers
Ibid.
take the book, the Bible; and so study it, that they seem to eat it up.
Howbeit (such are the times as yet) they forewarne that the word, though sweet
in their mouths as honey, shall be bitter as gall in their bellies Ezech. 2.8.
and 3.1.14. Ier. 4.19.
as to other Prophets. For the word is sweet to speak and hear; but when the
wickedness of the times will not embrace it, but like Lions, Panthers, Bears,
etc. bloodily persecute it; the Preachers have just cap. 11.3.
cause to mourn in their bowels.

The two witnesses have the courts given unto them by the Angel: that is, are
acknowledged to be the true visible church, In those days the Church is
visible in the persecuted.
and called to preach there by the civil Magistrate. A holy and sufficient
calling in the time of these confusions. Neither is it required that they have
the Canonical admission of the popish Antichristian beast. Then is the public
face of Christian religion justly esteemed the courts of the house of God, for
their presence there, in persecution, and not for the sovereignty of the
popish Gentiles.

The testimony of these witnesses, is given cap. 14.4. etc.
by innocence of life and by preaching: of their innocence, first it is
said, These are they that are not defiled with women, by whoredoms,
adulteries, etc. As are those which follow the popish beast; but do keep
themselves to the Heb. 13.4.
undefiled marriage bed; which they teach to be honorable amongst all men, and
by it are as holy as Virgins. Contrary to Antichrist that blasphemeth marriage
in the Clergy, as if it were heresy, etc.

Secondly, they follow the lamb wheresoever he goes Ioh. 10.3.4.5
as good sheep that know the voice of their shephearde, and follow him, as he
goes before them. For in all things they walk according to the word of God.
As namly in the sacrament of the supper of Christ, the true Pascal lamb, they
strickly observe his institution. Not hearing the voice of the stranger and
tyrant Antichrist, that obtrudeth doctrine of another manner of the presence of
Christ there, or adds, or takes any thing away, etc.

Thirdly, cap. 10.4.
these are bought (by the blood of Christ) from amongst men, not partaking in
the ambitions, etc. of Antichrist, who would possess all the earth, excluding
the true owners. Wherefore the true Martyrs and godly Christians are not to be
found among them.

Fourthly, they be the first fruits, holy unto God, and to the Lamb. For these
only are Deuteronomy. 12.17.18.
dedicated unto the Lord, to sanctify the rest of mankind: which, if these
were away, were altogether unholy and profane in their pretended profession of
God and his Christ. And so in these times, there would be no Church at all.

Fifthly, cap. 14.5.
in their mouths is found no guile, speaking nothing deceiptfully, for earthly
ends; but truly, as the things of God are without hypocrisy. Contrary to
Antichrist who is cap. 13.14.
deceiptfull in his words, etc.

Lastly, cap. 14.5.
They are without spot before the throne of God. For if they be conuented
before any throne of justice, where the righteousness of God does prevail,
their most subtle accusers cannot convict their doctrine or life of any spot.
Howsoever Antichrist and his prelates sitting in the cap. 13.2.
throne of the Dragon the devil do accuse and judge them, as wicked and
heretics, etc.

Concerning their preaching, first is showed the matter they preached; and
after, their several doctrines which they specially handled.

The Matter is the Gospel, no fruitless Legends. Of the bringing it abroad it
is said, cap. 14.6.
I saw another angel fly through the mids of heaven, to signify that the
sudden spreading of the Gospel, in times so cruel and dark, could be
attributed to none other, but some divine hand, working by his holy angels as
effectually as when he gave the law.

This Gospel is called Everlasting, and enduring for ever: not subject to
abolishment, as the Antichristian Friars did after threaten: nor alteration, by
addition or diminution; which corruptions the Papacy attempteth: but as it was
in the beginning, so must it continue Everlasting.

This Gospel and none other, must the witnesses preach to them that dwell upon
the earth, cap. 10.11.
to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people, and many kings, of these
ten which arose out of the inundations of the Barbarians.

Specially they urge these doctrines, and that vehemently, as cap. 14.7.
with a loud voice; Fear God, and neither idols, nor men. Give glory to God,
and not to such mortal men, etc. as would translate the glory of God to
themselves. Worship him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and
fountains of waters, and the things in them; that is, the Creator of all
things, and not Romans 1.25.23.
the creature, whether angels or Ephesians. 2.10.
men, much less any idol which is the work of man's hand.

The success of this war is very doubtful. For first the beast does
overcome, and after that is overcome.

He is said to cap. 13.7.8.
overcome them that stand against him, both Princes and witnesses. For power is
given him over every kindred, and tongue, and nation. Therefore all that dwell
upon the earth shall worship him, (as a God upon earth) whose names are not
written in the book of life, of that Lamb which was slain from the beginning
of the worlds. Of the particulars hereof will afterward more at large be
spoken. But in the mean space, we must remember, that the manner of his
victory, is to break in pieces, devour, and stamp the residue under foot.

the Emperor hissed out. For now there is life given to the beast. Trith. Hirs.

In his way to Rome they fable that the Angels were heard singing, The Lord
has thoughts of peace and not of afflictions. But they were lying spirits in
the mouth of the false prophets. For Volat. l. 22. Abb. Vrsp. p. 218.
the Normans, whom he called into Italy against the Greeks and Saracens,
invaded the possessions of the Pope. Against them the Pope, as a Legionarie
king, goes to war; and after much bloodshed on both sides, the Pope fled,
Bergom. 12.
was taken prisoner by pursuit, and some Cardinals with him; and for ransom
gives them Apulia, and whatsoever they held in Italy. Volat. 22.
These wars of the Pope, the Archbishop of Florence does blame; showing it
unlawful for him to do that which Peter was forbidden, when Christ said, Put
up thy sword into thy sheath. Also Fasc. Temp. f. 73.
Petrus Damianus a most learned man in his time condemns the Clergy, that
(like legionarie numbers) fight for temperalties, or labor to be present at
wars; as being contrary to Gods commandment. Geneb p. 870
Nicatas Pictoratus wrote against the Romans, of Priests marriages, etc. Bergom.

Berengarius, who had been long singular for holiness and learning, taught

that after consecration, there was not any carnal or real presence in the
sacrament, but the sign. Geneb. p. 871 875.
He was condemned by this Pope, first at Rome, then at Vercellis in a Council;
so was the book which Johannes Scotus wrote of the Sacrament, 170. years after
it was published. Now began it to be called Simonie, to receive any
Ecclesiastical preferments at the hands of a lay man; and such as taught that
the Clergy ought, or might use their wives, were (blasphemously) called
Nicolaitans, and whoremongers. Whereas the Scripture says, that in marriage
Heb. 13.4.
the bed is undefiled. This Pope Mass. 16. p. 222.
canonized one Gerardus for a Saint, happily the first canonizer of any Saint.
He also is Trith. p. 63.
reported to be so famous for miracles, that, they fable, he cleansed Christ of
a Ieprosie. No marvel if they blaspheme them that dwell in heaven, when they
dare blaspheme the glorified body of Christ.

Victor the second, Anno 1054.
Bergom. 11.
in a Council at Florence deprived many Bishops for Simonie and Fornication;
that is, for receiving spiritual preferments of lay men, and for marriage.
And in a Council the Geneb. p. 872
third time condemned Berengarius. Abb. Vrsp. p. 21^.
His Deacon poisoned him in the communion cup. There was extreme famine, (
Michael the Lamb auenging the persecution of the Gospel.)

Stephanus the tenth, Geneb. p. 872.
Ann. 1057.
reproved the Emperor for abridging the Popes authority. By his means
Volat. 22. f. 253. Anno 1058.
the Church of Millaine is made subject to Rome, which it had not bin for 200.
years before.

Benedictus the tenth, Berg. 12.
was cast out by Hildebrand, only because he was said not to come in by the
door, but by gifts. Geneb. p. 873
Hitherto the stories are dark, henceforth by little and little they grow most
clear: (in appearance for popery, but indeed against it.)

Ann. 1059.
Nicolaus the second, Volat. 22. Fox Mart. p. 170.
made Robertus Guiscardus (to recieue the number of his name) to be tributarie
and captain general of S. Peter's lands, to subdue by force of arms all that
went from the obedience of the Church of Rome; for the Pope is now a legionarie
king. He first made Geneb. p. 873.
a solemn decree, D. 23. In nomine.
that thenceforth the Pope should be chosen by the Cardinals; accursing them
all as Antichristian, which opposed themselves to this kind of election.
Geneb. p. 939
But this decree took none effect, till the time of Lucius the third, Anno
1181, who was the first Pope so chosen. By which is to be seen, that the
Popes decrees took then no place when they were first made. He also held a
Council against Berengarius, and another against Simonie and fornication, as
his predecessor had done; meaning such Priests as received spiritualties of
lay men, and had wives. Unto Paral. Vrsp. p. 413.
him wrote Hildericus Bishop of Ausburge, a very grave man, an excellent
Epistle; reproouing him for the forbidding of Priests marriage, in which is
avouched the testimony of Paphnutius the martyr, affirming marriage to be
honorable, and that the use of a man's own wife is chastity. Berg. 12. f.
180. a.
Berengarius when he could not prevail in his opinion of the sacrament, gave
his goods to the poor, and lived by the labor of his hands.

Bishops and others, to the number of 7000. went for devotion to Jerusalem,
whereof scarce 2000. returned. This Pope p. 91.
was earnest against (that which they called) Simonie. Wherefore he sent for
certain Bishops to Rome, whereof one so pleased the Pope with bribes, that he
returned honored with an Archbishops Pall: (whereby it appears the Pope was
angry against Simonie by others, because he was willing to have all the
bribes himself.) And as it seems for this cause would wrest the inuestiture
of Bishops out of the Emperors hands: and the gift of spiritualties from lay
men. The Saxons and Sueues, Abb. Vrsp. p. 219. 220. 221. Oath. Fris. Chro. 6.34.
Cran. M. lib. 5. cap. 20. p. 333.
both lay Princes, and Bishops, breed emotions against the Emperor, and bring
blasphemous and incredible complaints against him to the Pope, and draw the
Pope to their faction. The Emperor by his Ambassadors, whom he sent for
justice to Rome against his seditious subjects, receives letters, commanding
him to make satisfaction for Simonie, etc. And presently the Saxons break
forth in open rebellion. The Geneb. p. 878 877.
Turks get in a manner all Asia. This Pope continued the opposition of his
predecessors against Berengarius, and the gift of spiritual dignities by lay
men, and was so earnest against married Priests, that Fasc. Temp. f. 73. b. d.

he required none to be present at their Mass under pain of excommunication.

was called before Hildebrand, was chosen only by the Romans, without the
Emperors consent. Oath. Fris. 6. 34 36.
Whereupon grew a most grievous schism, and most violent storms in the common
wealth and Church, to the danger of body and soul, like the darkness of
Egypt. For the Pope Mass. 16. p. 223.
as a most valiant champion, sent word to the Emperor Henricus the fourth,
that if he would confirm him in his papacy, he would resist the errors of
the Emperor. (For so he called the bestowing of spiritualities by a lay man.)
But when the Emperor would not yield to the Pope, Gregory in a Council at
Rome ( 1. Tim. 4.1. etc.
giving heed to spirits of errors, and doctrines of devils) Trith. Hirs. p. 92.
forbids the Clergy, Bishops, Priests, or Deacons to marry, under the
pain of the great curse, etc. and Mat. Paris. p. 8.

holy fathers, forbids lay men to hear the Mass of him that was married.

amongst the Priests of the West, till the time of Gregory the seventh. He De

In this Council was the Emperor accused of Simonie, and was called to his
answer. Frising. de gestis Trid. 1. 1
But he appeared not, being detained by many seditions, and rebellions, and
wars of the Hungarians, Saxons, etc. which were partly stirred by Pope
Alexanders faction: yet when all the breadth of the Empire was filthily wasted
with sword and fire, the Pope excommunicated him as forlorn and forsaken of
his means. The ibid. Chro. 5. 35.
Emperor was exceedingly moved with this new proceeding, not knowing before
this time any such sentence to have been promulged against a Prince. I read
and read again the gestes of the Roman kings and Emperors, yet no where do
I find any of them before this Emperor to be excommunicated by the Pope; or
deprived of his kingdom: wherefore it is proved to be fabulous, Geneb. p. 591
which is reported of Innocentius, that he excommunicated Arcadius, or degraded
Eudoxia then Empress, except it were done in secret or in conceit. In this
Council was Guibertus Archbishop of Rauenna, Mass. 16. 224.
who stayed in Rome after the Synod, to be made Pope by the Emperor; which
when Gregory knew (having been rescued from the hands of Cincius by the fury
of the people) he degraded all those which were in schism against him. The
Abb. Vrsp. p. 221. Trith. Hirs. p. 93.
Emperor in a Council at Wormacia, with (in a manner) all the Germane Bishops
deprived the Pope; and by the instructions of Hugo a Cardinal published their
sentence thus. Because thine entrance began with so great periuries, and that
the Church of God is so endangered by so grievous a storm, by the abuse of thy
novelties, and have dishonested thy life in thy conversation with so manifold
infamies, as we never promised thee any obedience; so do we renounce to keep
any toward thee hereafter. And because none of us, as thou have publicly
declaimed, has bin esteemed by thee to be a Bishop; neither shall thou
henceforth, by any of us, be called Apostolical. The Pope in a Council
reads these letters, and again excommunicateth the Emperor and his
favorers, being Massaeus, 16. p. 224.
encouraged by certain letters out of Germany, that gave life to the beast.
At Openheim was a Colloquie, in which most of the Princes, especially Saxons

he had confessed to a Cardinal, that he had troubled the Church by the
persuasion of the devil; and sent to absolve the Emperor, and all Christian
people, quick, and dead, the Clergy and laity. This Geneb.
Gregory is said to work diverse miracles, and to have the gift of prophecy,
(but falsely.) For Abb. Vrsp. p. 223. ex Bruone
when he so far arrogated unto himself to be a prophet, that he did cry out
of the deske at Easter, esteem me not for Pope, but pull me from the Altar, if
the Emperor die not before Whitsontide; he hired some by treasonable practices,
to kill him at his prayers in the Church. Mat. Paris. p. 10.

his time, and by reason of the contentions which he stirred up, the state of
the Church was lamentable; the Priests were of most vile conditions; and the
people despised holy things. The Turks prevail in the East. The Fasc. Temp.

his letters persuaded Conradus the Emperors son, to rebel against his
Father, and to take unto himself the Empire. Wherefore the Pope consecrated
him as King, and caused him to reign in Italy and Lombardie against his
Father. In Frising. 7.2. Vrsp. p. 229. Luke 21.10.11. Matthew. 24.7.
those days, according to the prophecy in the gospel, every where Nation did
rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There were great
earthquakes in diverse places, and famine and pestilence and fearful things,
and great signs in heaven, etc. While these fearful and prodigious signs
appeared, Alexius the Emperor of Constantinople, by his letters importuned the
Pope for aid against the Saracens. There Trith. Hirs. p. 120.
was also one Petrus Eremita, who moved in a manner all the world; carrying
with him a little paper, which he said, fell from heaven; in which was
contained, that all Christendom should go to Jerusalem, and possess it with
the confines thereof for ever. Abb. Vrsp. p. 230.
The Pope calls a Council, and most eloquently persuades the people of many
nations and tongues, blasphemously, promising forgiveness of sins, to all
that would leave all, and go into the holy land against the Saracens; and
decreed that every one that went should receive a ( character of the) cross,
and wear it upon his hat or garment. By the means of the Pope and the
Eremite, an incredible army of all sorts of people and languages were
assembled. Frisin. Chr. 7.6. Vrs. p. 231.

the antipope, a decrepit man, who not long after died of a fever, when he had
in opposition suruiued three Popes, and Vrsp. p. 237.
is reported to have been a man wise, eloquent, noble, and a very reverend
personage. Trith. Hirs. p. 128.
And because his favorites did testify that certain divine lights were seen
at his grave, the Pope like a beast that suffers them not to be put in graves
whom he has slain, commanded him to be dug up, and cast into Tybur. After
Geneb. 904.
his death was elected another Antipope etc. whom Vrsp. p. 241.
the Emperor thought in his intended voyage to Rome to place. But Paschalis in
a great Synod at Rome condemned as heretics the present disturbers of the
Pope, and such as despised his curse. The Clergy promises obedience to the
Pope and his successors; and to affirm or deny that which the universal
Church (meaning the Pope) does affirm or deny. And the Emperor is delivered up
to a perpetual curse. The Fris 7. 8.
Emperor appoints his son Henry his successor, who was consecrated by the
Pope in Rome. He also invaded Saxony that held with the Pope against him. But
in Trith. p. 131.
this expedition, his son stole out of his camp, was absolved by the Popes
Legate; and by the counsel of certain Princes, and all the Bishops and Abbots
of Saxony, began to dispose of the Empire, and rebelleth against his father. In
a Crant. M. 5. 36. 31. 33.

When the armies were in the field, there was amongst many great lamentation
for the unnatural wars. Now was fulfilled that of Saint Paul: 2. Tim. 2.3.
In the last days shall be perrilous times. For men (seeking their own and
not that which is Christ's) shall be lovers of themselves, etc. disobedient to
parents, without natural affection, etc. Others took the cross, left the
field, and went to Jerusalem. At this time were horrible signs, earthquakes,
and mortalities. Vrsp. p. 246. 247. Geneb. p. 898.
At Mogunce the Emperor and his son deliberate of peace; where the Popes
Legate revived the denunciation of the Popes excommunication against the

and the Emperor while he suspected nothing, was imprisoned by his son. The
Bishops of Mogunce, Colen, and Wormacia (for the image of the beast have life
put into them by the Pope) take from the Emperor his ornaments, and gave them
to his son. The Trith. p. 135. 136.
Emperor in vain offered all subjection, but was referred over to the Pope;
and Frisin. 7.12.
in vain bemoned himself to Princes; but in this disgrace did finish his
days, being a merciful Prince, and giving much alms. Against whom nothing is
truly objected, but his standing for the right of the Empire, and marriage of
the Clergy; other things seem to be blasphemies. Trith. Hirs. p. 143.

unlawful, both historians and Schoolmen of this time do doubt. For they
seal up the things which the seven thunders have spoken. Geneb. p. 901.

was every where acknowledged for Emperor. The Pope (Paschalis) and his
favorites, triumphed for the death of the Emperor with incredible joy; as did
the Israelites, when Pharaoh was drowned, and the Jews when Aman was hanged.
Now were the Bishops, that were ordained by the Emperor, cast out of their
graves, others that lived could not obtain absolution, till they dug the
Emperor out of his grave, and removed him to some place not consecrated.
Whereupon the Emperor lay unburied five years. Furthermore, the 252. Jbid.
253.
Pope was coming unto Germany, but perceiving that nation not willing to
receive his decree, that it is unlawful to receive Ecclesiastical preferments
of a lay man's hand, turned himself into France, where he held a Council:
Thither the Emperor sent, chalenging the right of the Empire in inuesting
Ecclesiastical persons, granted to Carolus Magnus. But the Pope Trith. p. 137.
there decreed, that none should receive any Ecclesiastical preferment of a lay
man, till the question were decided in a general Council. The Emperor, in his
bed, was frighted with lightning etc. that struck nails out of his target,
and burnt off his swords point, an evil presage. When the Fris. 7.13.14.
Emperor had quieted his countries in Germany, he takes his voyage to Rome,
there to be crowned in Italy. Having done many things valiantly, subduing many
rebels. etc. Vrsp. p. 254. 255.
In the way there met him the Popes Legates; showing him that the Pope was
ready to crown him, if he would assent to the Pope, forbidding lay men to
inuest any of the Clergy. The Emperor consented, if it might b^^^tified by
the Church, and civil Princes. Wherefore coming to Rome, the Pope
entertaineth him in great pomp. At Mass. 16. p. 226. Trith. p. 139. Gobel. and

S. Peter's Church, while they were in Council, about matters of the Church and
Empire, arose a great tumult by the faction of the Romans; in which many were
slain. The Emperor getting the victory, the soldiers and Bishops that
favored the Emperor captiued the Pope, and Clergy; stripped the^ naked, that
they left them no breeches, but only to the Cardinals, and Bishops; carried
them out of Rome, and Crantz. Met. 5. 36.
threatened to kill them, except they subscribed to the Emperor. For the Mat.

Emperor would hold his right, as his ancestors had done 300. years, under
60. Popes. By the many tears of such as were in danger, the Pope yielded to
the Emperor. Hereupon Wigorniensis. ad. a. 1111. p. 654. etc.
the Emperor took an oath he would deliver the Pope, and the Pope with the
Cardinals, and Bishops, swear to be no more troublesome to the Empire, for
the matter of inuesting the Clergy: which also the Pope confirmed, by his Bull

last, they return to Rome, and the Romans being pacified, the Emperor is
consecrated, and anointed.. Which done, the Emperor giving bountifully to the
Pope, and Clergy, is honorably attended through Italy to the Alps, whence he
came happily into Germany, interred his father, and Frising. 7.15.
was terrible to all his enemies, who labored to be reconciled to him. About
Geneb. p. 903
this time, Princes in all places challenged the declaring of Bishops. When
Visp. p. 255. 256.
the Emperor was gone out of Italy with his army, Paschalis endured many
indignities of the Church of Rome, for crowning the Emperor; and for the
privilege which he gave him. Wherefore in a Council, he purged himself,
consented to the degrees of his predecessors, Gregorius 7. Vrbanus 2, and as
they had done, excommunicated the Emperor, and retracted the privilege
formerly given. Hereupon arise many mutinies and seditions. Fris. 7.15.
The P^inces at the Emperors marriage conspire openly against him; whereupon
the Empire is again torn asunder most miserably by seditions, rebellions,

Those which were killed of the Emperors side were interdicted the communion of
burial, and many preached abroad that the Emperor was excommunicated. There
were also fearful Thunders and signs. The 261.
Emperor sends to the Pope certain satisfactory Legates, but prevailed not;
the Pope answering that he had not excommunicated him; but whereas others had
done it, he could not absolve him without their consent. And Trith. p. 140.
whereupon the Emperor joining battle with the Princes fought twice; and at
last the Saxons triumphed over him gloriously and slew his soldiers; so that
himself did hardly escape with his life. Cranz ^. 6.7.
The Saxons in triumph set up a statue; a man armed, whom the foolish multitude
worshipped. The Saxons join with the Archbishop of Mogunce, who raged against
the Emperor, with both swords. For he was the Popes Legate. Whereupon, the
enemies increasing, the Emperor left his enemies, and went into Italy where he
did much trouble his enemies, and set up an Antipope.

then brake in certain Romans, and trod out the Popes blood, and beat the
Cardinals with fists and cudgels. But this Pope etc. was delivered from this
danger. The Gob. ae. 6.5^.
Emperor being at Padua, hasted to the Popes election; but the Pope the next
day withdrew himself from the communion of the Emperor, and departed. The
Emperors soldiers that could not catch the Pope, shot arrows after him; and
the Emperor sets up one Mauricius an Antipope and departed. Which when
Gelasius knew, he excommunicated the Emperor, and the Antipope. But the Emperor
returning into Germany, makes peace with the Princes. The Geneb. p 906.

Templers a number or order of soldiers, or Knights, began at Jerusalem. Their
vow was to defend Pilgrims, that went to visit the sepulcher, from robbers and
spoylers; and also to fight for the Christian religion. They grew to be
flagitious, for Sodomie, and most filthy Idolatry and superstition. Their
colors were white, with a red cross. The Knights of the order of Calatraue
were ordained about Toledo in Spain; their vow was to defend the country
against the Saracens; their colors were black, a cross red. The Knight of
the order called Teutonici, began somewhat after. They gave entertainment to
such as came to visit the sepulcher; and vowed to fight for the Christian
faith, when need should be. Geneb. p. 208.
In a Council at Rhemes, the Fris. 7. 15. 18.

if S. Peter should rise again, and reprove them for their sins, they would
not spare him. He also foretold them that God would not spare their
impurities. That they went in all filthiness before their people to hell. That
God was the auenger. And proposed the examples of Christ and his Apostles to
follow. The author says, he was sent by an Angel to preach. Himself says, he
preached the things which God commanded. He seemed to the Nobles of Rome a true
disciple of Christ; but the Cardinals and Clergy hated him, and by night
drowned him. Geneb. p. 909.
There was at the same time about Antwerpe one Tandemus or Trith. p. 155.

challenged the learned, and by name Bernard to dispute before the Bishops and
King, etc. he appealed from the Council to the Pope, and hoped of many friends

At Rome the Emperor saw upon a wall the picture of Innocent the second in his
pontificals, giving Lotharius the Emperor, that humbly kneeled before him, the
crown of the Empire; which much displeased the Emperor. When he was gone, the
Pope wrote to him in a letter, that he did not repent for the benefit which he
had bestowed, viz. the crown, which displeased the Emperor so, as that he
openly said, he acknowledged not any benefit given him by the Pope; his Empire
he had of God and the Electors, etc. Rob. Barn^c.

courteous, who had been chosen by nine Cardinals, was inthronised. But after
Alexander took the place. This was the cause of a great schism; for which the
Emperor taking compassion of the people, at Papia called both the elected
Popes; not to judge their cause; but to satisfy himself, whom he should
acknowledge. Platina.
Alexander refused to come, and excommunicated Victor, and the Emperor who
favored him. And finding many enemies at Rome, went to France; Geneb. p. 931.
where the Kings of England and France waited before him as vshers on foot.
Trith. p. 192.
At the request of the French King, the Emperor holds a Council for the
unity of the Church. But Alexander would neither come thither, nor permit the
French King to come. Page 193. 194.
At this time were three very sharp disputers, Arnoldus, Marsilius, and
Theodoricus; which maintained that the prelates of their time were deceivers of
souls, and snares of the devil; they were named Cathari; but were of the
opinion of Tanchelinus; eight men and two women of that opinion were burned.
This doctrine spread in Boem, Alsatia, and Thuringia, and continued long. There
were also of the same opinion called Cardenses, of the place where they lived.
The Pope in France does labor to unite other stations against the Emperor. He
was frighted from his Mass, with fearful darkness and thunder; returns
into Italy and breeds new troubles. Page 202.

The Pope for fear flies in the habit of his Cook to Venice. Whom Otho the
Emperors son pursued to sea, where being over forward to fight, he was taken
by the Venetians: being brought in triumph into the city, the Pope takes a
gold ring and casts it into the sea, to espouse the sea unto him, by a rite
merely heathen; and did institute that his successors should yearly do the
same, which custom is yet kept. The Emperor partly weary of wars, and
taking compassion of Italy so rent with dissension; and of the East, that was
ouerrunne by Saladi^^; and of his son, inclined to seek reconciliation. At
Venice the Pope a^ Saint Marks trod on the Emperors neck, and caused the
Quire to sing, super aspidem and basi^scu^ ambulabis, as Justinian the tyrant
had done before at Constantinople. When the Emperor answered; Not to thee, but
to Peter; the Pope replied, both to me and Peter. So was reconciliation made.

Calestine the second died for sorrow: Lucius the second was almost killed:
Eugenius the third, Alexander the third, Lucius the third, were driven out of
the city; Vrbanus the third, and this Gregory were banished; till at length
things were compounded by Clemen^s the third. By which we see, that the state

not maintain that unity and estimation of the Pope that they brag of. The

the Princes of Germany which were gone into Asia against the Turks heard of

the wars, and came home to the election of a new Emperor. By their departure
all in a manner was lost in the holy land. Trith. p. 210. 211. 213.
When they returned, some chose Philip the Emperors brother, others Otho.
Whereupon were multiplied many evils, wars, fires, destruction of cities,

But Philip was strong and fortunate in his wars, which were many, because of
the Popes excommunication. And Vrsp. p. 308.
the Princes and Barons, taught by the devil, cared not to break their oath,
nor violate their faith; but confounded all justice, taking part sometimes with
Philip, sometimes with Otho. By 307.
the means of this contention, the Pope made all Ecclesiastical dignities
litigious, and brought them to Rome. Whereupon Vrspergensis exclaimeth. Rejoice
our mother Rome, because the sluices of all treasures are opened, that whole
rivers of money may run to thee. Rejoice, for the wickedness of men; because
for the recompense of so great evils, some price is paid to thee. Insult for
discord thy helper, which came from hell to help thee to money, by great
heaps. Thou have that which thou have thirsted for. Sing this song, that by
wickedness, and not by religion, thou have overcome the world. Men come not to
thee for devotion and conscience, but for the committing of villainies, and for
decision of contentions, bought out with money of thee. The begging Friars
began the wicked order, of which Ioachim prophesied before.

The first thing that the Friars did labor for, was to magnify their faction.
Ex Mat. Paris. p. 910. Gobelaet. 6. cap. 63. Fox Mart. p. 326.
To which purpose they wrote a very detestable and blasphemous book,
containing the most abominable heresies of these new sprung up friars. Now
because the Gospel which the scripture calls cap. 14.6.
Eternal, was commonly preached to the hazard of the papacy; these called
their book, The eternal Gospel, and the Gospel of the holy Ghost. This they
said, excelled that written by the four Evangelists, so much as the kernel
passes the shell, and as light excels darkness. And therefore taught, N.B.
that within threescore years, vz. 1260. the Gospel written by the four
Evangelists should cense, and be abolished, and theirs should step up
instead thereof, and continue for ever. Sibrandus L^b. d. Christ. ^og. 2. cap.

This book the Friars commended to the Pope to be canonized, who esteemed it
much. For from hence the Popes do continue many wicked prankes, to weaken, if
not to abolish the authority of the Scriptures. This device of forging a new
Gospel, the Friars borrowed of their fathers the Epiph. haeres. 26. p. 27.

At the same time, one Fulco preached in France, and moved many to take the
cross, and fight in the holy land. Whereupon two Earls came with their armies
to the Pope, who sent one of them against his own enemies in Campania; the
other went as toward Jerusalem; in the way the Venetians spoil a certain
city called Satira. After the army went to Constantinople, beat a part of the
city, entered and took many spoils, and relics of Saints. He that reads,
judge if it were not theft; and if the Pope can excuse that rapine by the
Isralites robbing the Egyptians. Trith. p. 219.
After the capitulations were made for the quiet of the Empire, Philip went to
pursue some rebels in Saxony; and as he rested in his chamber, having opened a
vein, he was murdered by Otho Palatinus, because he did not worship the

honorably received by the Princes and Pope; and is crowned. At this time the
Franciscan Friars began. There were also great heates, fearful thundrings,

Otho the Emperor succeeded prosperously in his wars of Apulia, and Calabria.
Wherefore Vrsp. p. 314.
the Pope sent five times to him in short space for peace; but the Emperor
despising the Popes commandments, could not be stirred, but that he would
root out Fridericus; and be revenged of the French King, for the wrongs he had
done to England. Hereupon the Pope took courage, Page 317.
and resolved upon two things; to recover the holy land from the Saracens; and
to reform the Church against heretics, and such as impugned the liberties
thereof. And so required Trith. p. 221.
the Archbishop of Mogunce to declare the Emperor excommunicate and deposed.
The Princes that favored Otho, spoiled the cities, religious houses and
Churches of the diocese of Mogunce; and Otho returning into Germany subdued
many rebels. Geneb. page 957. 958.

Pope brings forth Fridericus, and opposes him openly to Otho the Emperor,
because he labored not for absolution, and peace; commanded the Princes to
choose Fridericus, and to cleave unto him; which they did. The Pope also sent
his Abb. Vrsp. p. 314. 315.
letters to the Clergy and Princes, for aid against the Saracens in the holy
land. His chief argument to persuade by, was this. The Saracens from the time
of Gregorius the first, when they began, have continued 666. years almost;
which time according to the cap. 13. vlt.
Revelation they should certainly be rooted out. So foolishly did this false
Prophet understand that place. Vrsp. p. 319.
Between Otho and Fridericus were wars; and Otho because his friends
forsook him, was constrained to give ground awhile. Fridericus pursued him,
and vexed his favorites; yet did Otho gather up himself to fight, both with
Fridericus and the French King. But by the French King he was put to the worse.

should provide them fit men, which should celebrate divine service, and
minister the Sacraments, and preach unto them, according to the diversity of
their rites, and tongues. So that yet it was not concluded, that the service of
God should be in a strange tongue, as the papists would persuade. This Council

many took the cross to go against the Saracens. And many orders of soldiers
arose, the crosse-bearing soldiers were advanced. In Volat. 21. f. 244.
Arragon were two orders of soldiers; the first, Saint Mary, for the
redemption of captives, whose colors were white, a cross black. The other
Monlesiae, with a red cross; these were to defend the country from the
irruptions of the Saracens. There were also the Dominicans, or preaching Friars
advanced. In Trith. p. 224.
those days were many (called) heretics, men and women, which spread their
opinions in Almania, France, and Italy. In the city of Argentine were more
then fourscore apprehended, whom Conrade the inquisitor thus examined. He
caused an iron to to be made red hot, and whom the hot iron did hurt he
condemned for heretics, and delivered them to be burned, (for the beast has
teeth of iron and nails of brass,) many believed he condemned many innocents.
In Geneb. p. 958.
Alsatia many held against the Pope; and the Grecians against
transubstantiation. So did Almericus a very learned man; his bones, and the
bones of diverse that followed him, were dug up again and burned at Paris,

As the Pope preached the cross, so did the devil; 20, 000, boys, etc. in
Almania took the sign of the cross, to go to Jerusalem against the Turks;

the Pope was unwilling to confirm their order, till in a (lying) vision by
night he saw Dominicke, or as other say Francis, with his only shoulders
bearing up the Laterane Church, that by mine was ready to fall. They also
fable, that when Christ came armed with three darts to destroy the world; at
the instance of his Mother, he was content to respite the world, till she had
made experience of her two champions; sufficient to convert the whole world.

not converted by them, he would presently make an end of it. Howbeit as Prog.

Vincentius writes Anno 1416. more then a hundred years after the prefixed

being elected Emperor, disposes his affairs, and is crowned at Rome;
bestows many of the Imperial lands upon Saint Peter; and takes the cross
to fight for Jerusalem against the infidels; committed his son to the uition
of certain Princes, by whom he was crowned King of Romans. But whereas
certain Earls had taken some of his castles in Apulia, he fights with them,
and does overcome them, who fly to the Pope that protecteth them; whereof the
Emperor complains. The cross is preached in Almany; whereupon the people
commit many murders and horrible facts, upon assurance of pardon, for taking
the cross. Page 323.
The Emperor subdueth the Saracens, and also certain rebels in Apulia. The
Christians who had taken the cross and were come to Nilus, by the great and
continual confluence of new aids, took the impregnable city of Damiata;
where they make a most miserable spectacle by the slaughter of the Paganes. By
the means of the Popes Legate ( VVestmonast p. 278.
who came rather to the desolation of the army, then for the consolation
thereof) and by means of Ludouicus Banarus, they proudly refused a most
honorable and profitable composition, which the Sultan offered; namely to have
restored Jerusalem, and the countries about it, for the city Damiata. But
after by the stratagems of the Sultan, they were driven to accept of their own
lives. Trith. p. 228. 230.
Many Nuns were thrust out of their cloisters, for their naughty and extreme
filthy life. There were at this time horrible earthquakes, pestilence among
cattle, and such famine as has not been heard of. Page 229.
Then was the cross preached again, and all appointed to follow the Emperor
into the holyland. Vrsp. p. 324.
The Emperor calling an assembly of the Princes (before his voyage) is thought

This Pope ordaines, that the Eucharist, Her Renech. in Psalm. 1. p. 454.

This Pope did strictly forbid the reading of the civil law in Paris and the
places adjoining. He warred with the Emperor in Apulia; John the Emperor of
Constantinople obtained of him to absolve the Emperor Fridericus the second,
that he might make an expedition against the Turks, who daily prevailed in
Asia.

as a proud man, in his first year, Anno 1227.
contrary to justice, began to excommunicate the Emperor Fridericus, upon
frivolous and false occasions; obiecting that he went not into the holy land,
as he promised: Trith. p. 231.
which excommunication also the Pope sends abroad to Archbishops etc. Mat.
Paris. 332. 333.
by his bulls; in which he complains that the Church was endangered by the
Pagans, (the Angels about Euphrates) the Emperor (the Angel that sets his
right foot on the sea and left upon the earth) heretics, (the two witnesses
of Christ) and by false brethren (godly men hid from the presence of the
Serpent.) Vrsp. p. 324.
The Emperor publishes his Apology, and Mat. Paris. p. 335.
writes to Princes, complains of the false imputations laid against him by
the Pope; showing that the Church of Rome is so enflamed with the burning
affection of covetousness, that the goods of the Church are not sufficient to
satisfy her thirst: and that she blusheth not to disinherit Emperors, Kings,
and Princes, and make them tributaries. etc. Vrsp. p. 325.
Besides, the Emperor makes sure unto him, diverse of the noblest Romans, who
while the Pope pursues his excommunications, by the assistance of the people,
expel the Pope out of Rome with shame; and do vex his territories with
war. The Pope stirs up the King of Jerusalem, Matthew and Thomas, Earls of
Tuscia, against the Emperor. The Emperor resolves to go his voyage for the
holy land, and the Pope was a means to hinder the assembly of the Princes,
with whom the Emperor should take order for the affairs of the Empire in his
absence. When the Emperor was gone, the Pope notwithstanding caused Trith. p.
231.
him to be proclaimed excommunicate, throughout all Germany, which was done
especially by the begging Friars. Vrsp. Ibid.
Besides, his soldiers that took the cross were spoiled by the Popes means.
In Fox. Marty.
Italy the Pope raised up many rebellions against the Emperor, and attempted
the like against him in Asia; writing to the Patriarch of Jerusalem, the
soldiers and the Saracens to destroy him. Vrsp. p. 325.
Wherefore the Emperor endured much danger by the treason of the Templars
abroad; and the Pope at home inhibited all aid that would have gone over to
him, but warred upon, and subdued many of his possessions. Who is it that well
considers these things, and does not bewail, and detest them? which seem an
evidence and prodigious portent of the ruin of the Church. Westmo. p. 288.
The Pope taking it ill that Fridericus, as despising his excommunications, did
embrace the businesses of the Church, in the holy land; despayring that he
would not return to unity, decreed to deprive him of his Empire, and
substitute another; namely the General of his wars, whom he aided with all
that the Church of Rome could do; with treasure, armies, pardons, and
solicitations of all Prelates abundantly. Which when the Emperor understood,
he Vrsp. p. 325. Mat. Paris. 344. 345.
compoundeth the affairs of the holy land with the Seldan; and thinking to
make glad all Christendom with his good news, reports to them by letters
what honorable composition he had made. Vrsp. 325.
The Pope rejects his letters and spreads rumors that he was dead; by
which rumor many Imperial cities inclined to the Pope, and resolve to kill the
Germane soldiers which were in Italy; or should return that way from the holy
land. But when the return of the Emperor was once known, the fury slacked;
both Christians and Saracens cleave unto him, and by Trith. p. 23.
the valor of his Germane soldiers recouereth many of his cities again. From
which time grew much enmity between the Pope and Emperor. Vrsp. p. 326.
Yet the Emperor does still crave absolution, and by the mediation of Princes
laboreth to be reconciled unto the Pope. Trith. p. 232.

About this time were a very great many discovered in Almany, Italy, especially
in Lombardy, and in France, which held against the authority of the (popish)
Church and prelates; and against distinction of meats; for the marriage of
Priests, then called the heresy of the Nicolaitanes, etc. (against them are
objected many blasphemous things, as the manner of the Church of Rome is.) Of
these very many were burned. Pantaleon.

year was extreme hot and dry. The Emperor would pacify seditions which were
risen in his strong cities of Italy; which he did with violence, and burned his
rebels. At which time, in Germany, many nobles and mean persons; Clerks,
Monks, and Nuns, Citizens and country people, by the giddie sentence of
Conrade, the Popes inquisitor, were burned in the name of heretics. The same
day that any one was accused, whether justly or unjustly, no appeal nor
defense did avail; but he was burned. The Paral. Vrsp. p. 327. 328.
Pope also the third time excommunicated the Emperor, and did also proclaim
him an heretic; and stirred up the Venetians against him. The Emperor purges
himself from the imputation of heresy, by his letters publicly sent abroad
to Princes, etc. and in Italy found aid of the faction of the Gibellines. The
Trith. p. 236.
cross is preached against the Stadingenses, who stood excommunicate for
contemning the Popes authority; many had fought against them a long time
hitherto; but all in vain. Now by the army of the cross, 2000. of them were
slain; and so ceased the faction and confederacy against the Church of Rome.
Paral. p. 328.
The Pope also preaches the cross, with pardons to all those that would fight
against the Emperor. Of which army as many as the Emperor took, he crossed
them with cross wounds upon the heads, faces, or bodies. Then Trith. p. 236.

also did Henry King of Romans, rebel against the Emperor his father (happily

same time by the permission, or procurement of Pope Gregory, the insatiable

About this time the East Church is divided from the West, Mat. Paris. p. 778.

and by name, because the Pope would not admit an Archbishop there, without a
great sum of money. The Pope sent forth his preaching Friars, to move all
Christians to fight against the Grecians, as it were against the Turks, and
Saracens; insomuch, that in the Isle of Cyprus, many martyrs and good men were
slain for that only cause. 5. Dec. tit. 7. cap. 14. 15.

He presently confirmed the excommunication of Fridericus, who therefore
stopped the ways of the Popes posts, and hanged up two Minorites, that by
stealth did carry letters to move sedition amongst the Nobles. The Templars
for hatred of the Emperor besieged and vexed the Teutonici in the holy land,
not suffering them to bury their dead. 588.
Many Princes are alienated from the Emperor, and elect the Landgraue of
Thuring against him. 589.
But the Emperor presently made peace with the Landgraue. Wise men labored
to make peace between the Pope and the Emperor; but the Emperor refused to
submit himself absolutely to the Popes censure, desiring to have the causes
and conditions first known; neither would he resign the rites of the Empire.

The lamentable news of the Tartars had stirred all Christendom against them,

The Pope sends an Extortor into England, (etc.) with power to suspend,
excommunicate, and punish many ways, all such as would not suffer him to

When the Emperor labored for peace with the Pope in vain, the Pope (as it
seemed of purpose to bring the Emperor into causeless hatred) fled into
Ianua; where he had Galleys ready to entertain him. The Emperor (smelling the
Popes drift) said with grief, The wicked fly when none follows. The Popes
faction persuades the Landgraue to take the dignity of the Empire in hand, and
make war upon Fridericus whom they called tyrant, persecutor, a confederate
with Saracens, For the beast does open his mouth to blaspheme them that are
called Gods, etc. But the Landgraues friends advises him not to trust the
promises of the Popes party; and the Emperor coming on a sudden, the
Landgraue was alienated from that purpose, and gave gifts to the Emperor, and
so they parted friends. 622.
The Pope sends (abroad as) to England, by strange and incredible authority

who writes to England, to stay their contribution; and rather to exempt

After the presages of heavy things, as thunders, and lightenings, 635.
the Pope through France causes the Emperor to be preached excommunicate:
which when a Priest should denounce, he said to the people; I know the Pope and
Emperor to be at controversy, the cause I know not; but I pronounce the
party excommunicated that does the wrong, and absolve the innocent. 636.
The Pope calls a Council at Lugdunum, where his chamber was burned, 638.
as it was thought of purpose; to get occasion to extort money of the Prelates,
coming to the Council. 642.
And partly by moning his wants, and partly by large promises of preferments,
many of the prelates bestowed incredible wealth upon the Pope, VVestmon^st.
whom again he honored with titles and dignities. Mat. Paris. p. 643. 644.
645.
In the Council, the Emperors proctor answered diligently for his Lord, and
made large offers to subject the Roman Empire to the Church of Rome; to fight
against the Tartars, and for the holy land. All which the Pope insolently
rejected, and refused the kings of France and England to be sureties for the
Emperors promise herein. 658.

deprive the Emperor: forbidding him any more to be named Emperor by any;
which the Proctor said was the beginning of many evil days. The Pope to
further his purposes, Volat. 22. f. 255. Geneb. 970.971.
advanced the Cardinals. For whereas before they had not that bravery of
retinue and ornaments, he granted them, for honor to ride on white horses, and
to wear red hats, in token they should spend their lives for the Church of
Rome: like Curio. 1. p. 28.

solemn oath, to allow of none other law but that which Mahomet should make: in

The Pope with large promises, and bribes, and supplications, requesteth the

bloody wars before he would loose it. Gob. ae. 6. c. 64
There passed sharp letters between the Pope and the Emperor: 235.
the Emperor aduising the Pope to absolve him, lest (says he) our lion which
faineth himself to sleep, do wake, and with his terrible roaring do drive
all fat bulls out of all lands, and planting righteousness, do govern the
Church, rooting out the horns of the proud. Mat. Paris. p. 659. 660.
And of that argument sent letters abroad, which was the means he had less
regard. 662.
The French king commands the Pope to conference about the Emperors peace,
and his own voyage to the holy land: 664.
and the kings brother and diverse Nobles take the cross. 675. 676.
The French king again importuneth the Pope for the Emperors peace, but still
in vain. Wherefore he departs from the Pope angry, because he found not
that humility, which he hoped for, in the servant of the servants of God. 680.
The Clergy of England murmureth and complains that they were constrained to
find and pay soldiers to serve at the Popes pleasure, which opportunity the
Emperor took, to draw them to concurrence with him; and 682.
by his letters aliened many Princes hearts from the Pope, because they feared
the pride of the court of Rome, if the Emperor were brought under. The son
of perdition.
Wherefore the Pope endeavors by setting up the Landgraue to tread in pieces
the Emperor irrecouerably. (For now the beast does destroy, break in pieces,
and stamp the residue under foot.) But the Emperor intercepted the money he
sent to the Landgraue. Conradus the son of Fridericus coming with an army
against the Landgraue, by the Popes means, his soldiers ran to his enemy,
and so he was constrained to fly. Paral. Vrsp.
For much distraction of minds, and many troubles were in Germany by this
occasion. And Mat. Paris. p. 684.
now there was a new fashion in the court of Rome. For when any great persons
were at wars, they would by absolution or excommunication, strengthen or
weaken them, as might best serve for the profit of the court. The Pope raketh
money, and gathers aid against the Emperor. And contrarily, the Emperor
sends victuals to the holy land. (See the difference between the monstrous
beast and the Lamb.) Mat. Paris. p. 688.
The French king leuieth money for his voyage, the Pope for the Landgraue,
against the Emperor. The Emperor by his humility gets much favor; and
the Pope for his insolent reiections of his submission, exasperateth many.
There 690. 691.
followed such lightenings and thu^ders, as have not bin seen the like; after
which the Pope sent certain traitors to murder Fridericus; but missing their
purpose, they were stricken with fear, as with lightening from heaven. 695.
After which (it is thought the Pope to cry quittance with the Emperor,
falsely reported that) two ruffians sent by Fridericke, should have killed the
Pope. Now 697.
grew the Pope detested for rapine, who raked money insatiably to maintain the
Landgraue against Fridericus. 703. 704.
But when the Landgraue was ready to be crowned, Conradus the Emperors son
came upon them with a mighty army; and by wisdom and valor after much
Christian bloodshed, ouerthrewe the Landgraues forces, who for sorrow died
ignominiously. The Trith. p. 241.
Landgraue lived five years with the title of a king, but did nothing worth
the marking. For as long as Fridericus lived, neither the Pope, nor any prince,
prevailed against him. He contemned the Popes deposition as frivolous; and
found so strong a faction of the Gibellines, that he plagued Italy in such
sort, that he made the Pope weary of his life, and wish he had never deposed
him. Mat. Paris. p. 704.
Upon this success, the Pope sends four Cardinals into the four quarters
of the world, and petty Legates to special places, to defame Fridericke and
his son, and to preach pardons to all that would invade, persecute, and tear
them in pieces, if they could; and to that purpose, by covetous craft, and
crafty covetousness, to rake what money could be got. But (while the beast
thus rages) Fridericke inforceth the Apulians, etc. to swear homage to his
son; and causes Hensius his son, to plague the Popes kinsmen, and hang
them up whom the Pope loved best. In Paral. Vrsp. p. 330.
Sueuia many preachers are countenanced by Conradus the son of Fridericus,
who preached against the vices, authority, and pardons of the Popes, and
preached pardon by Christ: Mat. Paris. p. 704.
whereupon the Pope heaped anger upon anger, and hate upon hate, and
excommunicated him so terribly, that all quaked that heard him: Gesner. lib. 5.
(for cap. 13.11.
he speaks like the Dragon, whose voice did affright the whole army of
Alexander the Great.) After Mat. Paris. p. 781.
the Landgraue was elected the Count of Geldre, he refusing, followed in
election the Duke of Braband; after his refusal, was chosen Richard brother to
the king of England, who also refusing, the Pope procures William Count of
Holland to be chosen Emperor, who unadvisedly consented. The Mat. Paris. p.
768.
Pope thinking to deal more warily, sent treasure to William by secret
messengers; but both his money and provision were intercepted. The Popes Mat.

Legate assisted with the Archbishop of Colen, make barbarous waste, where
Frederick was favored; raked money by excommunications, etc. and chased
Conrade. The Emperor coming to besiege the Pope at Lugdunum was hindered by
those of Parma, etc. and so Trith. p. 244
is William crowned with great solemnity. But Mat. Paris. p. 712.
because all the Princes agreed not to the election, there sprung up new
contentions. Fridericke is enraged against his Italian rebels, and straiteth
them by siege. 721. 722.
But while Fridericke was absent, the Parmenses sally out, take the Emperors
treasure, and kill or disperse his forces: which made the Pope incredibly
joyful. But Fridericke reunited his forces; and there was never anger between
any so great, as was between the Pope and the Emperor. The Emperor vexed the
Pope the more, and afflicted the Parmenses as before. 724.
The French king taking his voyage, importuneth the Pope for the peace of
Fridericke, but in vain; though he showed the Pope, that else the impediment
of the businesses of the holy land, would be imputed to the Pope. So the king
takes ship, leaving behind him many choice soldiers, which 725.
presently began to mutine; but the Pope so charmed them, that he got from them
their money, and arms, and victuals, and sent them pennilesse away. 736.
By the Cardinals inuectiues the reputation of Frediricke did stink, and he
was accounted worse than Herod, Judas, or Nero: and they had prevailed against
him, had it not been 738.
for the covetousness, vsuries, simonies, and other filthy vices of the Court
of Rome. 739.
By the Popes means, it is said, the Emperors Physician should have poisoned
him, but it was discovered: and 741.
his aides to the Emperors rebels were intercepted. 742.
Fridericke now toyled with sickness, and loss of his sons, offers an
honest form of peace. The Pope rejoicing in his calamities (being such a one
as will never be appeased) would not accept it: Romans 1.
wherefore the Pope was hated by many, and they comforted Fridericke, and claue
to him, detesting the pride of the servant of the servants of God. Hereby 748.
Fridericus so prevailed, that in abomination of the Court of Rome, many
thrust out William, and the Popes Legate; and bound themselves by oath to be
faithful to Fridericus. The rebels of Italy were so vexed, that the Merchants
longing for peace, detested the Pope for his rebellion; and because he would
not accept the Emperors humiliation, but desired to tread him under foot,
whom he called the great Dragon; that when he had him under, he might with
more ease stamp also upon the Kings of England and France, and other princes,
whom he called Basilisks, or little kings, and little serpents, and might at
his pleasure spoil their prelates of their treasure. p. 760.
The French king takes Damiata. For 762.
which the Sultan offers the kingdom of Jerusalem, much treasure and peace;
so that there was hope that he purposed to become a Christian. But (as the pope
formerly commanded) all was refused by the popes Legate. It seems that he
that writes Annot. in Son. 107.
annotations upon Petrarchs Sonets, speaks of this story, when he says that
the king of Spaines brother, (I think he should say the king of France his
brother) proclaimed the pope Sultan of Babylon, which he calls Baladac. When
they had refused the Soldans offer, they could not afterward entreat, but
found bloody war. But Mat. Paris. 762. 763.
Fridericke subdued happily many of his rebels. The popes soldiers robbed them
that were signed with the cross for the holy land; taking their money from
them. And the army in the holy land was divided. In 767. 768.

sends by his two brethren to the pope to relieve his shame and difficulties
by the absolution of Fridericke. His brethren said to the pope, that it were
best to absolve him, else all would think the pope of an obstinate hatred, they
would remove him from Lions, and raise all France against him. Because they
urged the Pope to make peace with Fridericke as he loved the honor of the
universal Church, and would avoid to be charged to be the cause of the loss
of the holy land, by his covetousness, and merchandise of such soldiers that
took the cross for the aid of such soldiers that took the cross for the
aid of the holy land; the 777.

In sign of the wrath of God, there were exceeding horrible thunders; a heavy

Conrade makes sure his prisoners, that rebelled against his father; and with
his brethren, and friends does rise against the Pope; who for the insatiable
covetousness of his whole race, was hateful to the Imperials, 783.
and feared such ginnes and snares of the Romans, to recover an inestimable
sum of money from him, which he caused them to lay out in his wars against
Fridericke, that he durst not return to his seat in Rome. 791.
Yea the hearts of many departed from the father the Pope, who raged as a
fierce stepfather; and from the mother the Church of Rome, who was cruel in
persecution, as a stepmother. The 792.
pope departing from Lugdunum, calls the people together to bid them farewell.
By his Orator after other speeches, concludes; that the city had received this
benefit, and alms by the Popes presence, that where at his coming, there were

neeces; by which holy marriage, they which were the children of wrath, become

Conrade having got the favor of many of the Princes of the Empire, the Pope
preaches the cross against him, with far larger pardons, then were granted
to them that fought against the Turks in the holy land. For the fathers and
mothers of such were to be pardoned that sought against Conrade. When the
Queen and Nobles of France, saw the Pope to mind only his ambition; and to
neglect their distressed King, in the holy laud; they took into their hands,
the goods and lands of those that were signed against Conrade; bidding them
live of the Pope, that fought for him. The like was don in other places. Hence
the Pope through shame began to treat of peace with Conradus. Page 801.
There were more fearful thunders. The Pope (to make peace) desires to marry
a niece of his, Page 805.
to the brother of Conradus; and strengthens himself by making of new
Cardinals. But the Princes of the Empire conceived much indignation against the
presumption of the Pope, for seeking to ignoble Princes, by the marriage of his
neeces. William Earl of Holland, being sorrowful for his presumption in
accepting the Empire, resigned, Page 781.
and having lost his own Earldom and all, detested the mousetrappes, and
promises of the Pope; being constrained to beg. 808.
Conrade having gained the favor of all the Italians, in a manner, had poison
given him; as was thought by the Popes faction; but he recovered stangely, and
grew into more favor. Yet would not the Pope be persuaded to crow him, least
he should prove like his father, 813.
but seeing the danger of Christendom, by the contention, the Pope sought to
make peace with his foes, by giving them his neeces in marriage. Howbeit the
poison which Conrade escaped, and imputed to the Pope, and the contradiction of
the Princes of the Empire, to such presumptuous marriages, gained Conrade much
favor, hindered this kind of peace; and lost the Pope many friends and much
credit. Whereupon Conradus persecuted the Pope with fire and sword; and
spoiled such as went to the court of Rome. 814.
And so our father the Pope, who rather followed the steps of Constantine then
Peter, stirred up many calamities in the world. The Mat. Paris. p. 829.

At this time, (such was the covetousness and rapine of the Pope in England)
that upon a computation, which the Bishop of Lincoln caused to be made, it
appeared that this Pope, impouerished the universal Church more then all his
predecessors, and that in England, his gain was more then the Kings revenue.
838.
The Romans threaten them of Perusium with sieg, and desolation, if they held
the Pope any longer. Wherefore the Pope with fear and trembling, goes to
Rome; fearing least the money should be exacted of him, which was dispended in
the wars against Fridericke. But he paliated his sorrow as well as he could,
and went to Rome. (For the beast has a face like a Lion, that takes scorn to
look upon the nets he is entangled with.) 843.
The Pope wrote to Grosthead Bishop of Lincoln, to make a boy a Prehend at
Lincoln, which the Bishop refused to do; showing that the sin of the devil
and Antichrist, was to kill the souls of men by defrauding them of ministers
able to teach. With 844.
which answer, the Pope was enraged; and swear by Saint Peter and Saint Paul,
were it not for the gentleness of his own nature, his slave, the King of
England, should make the Bishop a fable, etc. The Cardinals labored much to
pacify the Popes fury; partly by preferring the goodness of the Bishop, before
the Pope and his Cardinals; partly by aduising the Pope to wink at all; least
there should arise some tumult; especially because it is known, that there
must come a departing from the Church of Rome. 846. 847. 848.
This Grosthead on his death-bead, reproved the preaching Friars, and Minorites
as heretics; for their negligence, and the Pope of heresy, for offering to
place a boy over the souls of men; and proves that the Pope is Antichrist. Of
the court of Rome he delivered this censure.

He also prophesied, that the Church should not be delivered from the Egyptian

At this time, ignorant persons, and boys were advanced to Church dignities

himself of Grosthead, as of an infidel and rebel, etc. in Ibid. Et Poly. Chr.

the night Grost bead, in his Bishops ornaments appeared unto him; and with a
stern countenance and angry speech said; arise wretch and come to thy doom,
etc. and smote him on the left side, right to the heart with his cross staff;
so that the Pope awaked with fear and pain, horribly frighted. Neither did
the vengance of the indignation of God so rest toward him; for in his wars
against Conrade he lost 4000. of his army; neither had the Pope ever any good
night or day afterward. The Mat. Paris. p. 861.
dissension grew great between the pope and Conrade; and the pope sorged
falsely many blasphemous accusations against him; as of heresy, murder, etc.
thereby to stir up the King of England against him. 863. 864.
There was in England a miraculous thunderclap. When the pope saw that Richard
the King of Englands brother, would not be taken in his nets; but held his
gift of Apulia, etc. as if he had given him the moon for the fetching; he
solicited the King of Emgland to accept it; promising to turn the soldier
that were signed with the cross for the aid of the holy land, to assist him.
This made all the princes and prelates of the holy land deteste the Roman
falsehoodes. Fox Marty. page 3.

The King of England with joy accepted the popes offer of the kingdom of
Sicilia, etc. and fed the pope with money. But upon the resistance of Conradus,
the popes army failed. Conrade also died, Gobel. 6.65.
as is reported of poison. Mat. Paris. p. 865.
The pope exceedingly rejoiced, and laughed for the death of his two great
enemies; Grosthead, and Conradus. 868.
Shortly after the pope himself dying, comforted his weeping friends thus: do
not I leave you rich enough, what would you more? when he was dead he was seen
by a Cardinal, condemned to hell for the hurt he did to the Church.

After which time the Empire stood without any certain Caesar, for
seauenteene years; for fear of the danger that might befall by the popes
means. And the affairs of Asia came into great danger by the popes
proceedings. Thus also he makes war against the Saints, and does overcome
them. So here is fulfilled that which is written: cap. 13. 7. 8.
And power was given him over every kindred, and tongue, and nation.

Those thunders lasted 150. years. For from the time of Hildebrand, which was
1074. to Alexander the fourth, which was 1254. is 180. years. From whence if
we take the time of peace from Honorius the second, to Adrian the fourth, which
was 30. years, the remainder will be 150. year.

book of Abbas Ioachim, condemned by Gregorius the ninth. They also had composed
a book, which it pleased them to entitle, The everlasting or eternal Gospel,
which now they enforced to root out the Gospel of Christ written by the four
Evangelists. They also urged many other things not to be spoken. Hereupon grew
so many and great scandales, one preaching against the other; that the
university of Paris, with great counsel and deliberation, sent six men very
excellent for learning, and of noble blood, to the Pope in commission, for the
repair of the decay in faith. The Friars sent speedy messengers to resist
these great men to their faces before the Pope At length after much a do their

Yet did Laurentius, a master of Paris, strongly, and stoutly, teach, preach,
and write, in the defense of the said Gulielmus, against the Popes and their
Friars. This Pope exceedingly increased the bloody laws made against them
which the Church of Rome calls heretics. Dec. 5. tit. 2. cap. 2.
He decreed that whosoever wittingly should bury heretics, or their believers,
receivers, defenders, or favorers, should be excommunicate, till with his own
hands openly, he cast those dead bodies out of their graves again. He forbad
lay men privately, or publicly to dispute of the Catholic faith, under pain
of excommunication; as Carrion.

inquisition with many bloody, and unmerciful laws, 6. Dec. 5. tit. 2. c. 4.

commanded the Germane Princes to elect a fit Emperor, else he said himself
would provide for a governor of the Empire. Hereupon Rudolphus is chosen; who
being admonished by the Princes at the instance of the Pope, to go to Rome to
be crowned; answered, Italy has consumed many Germane Emperors. I will not go
to Rome, I am king, I am Emperor, I trust I shall do as well for the profit
of the common weath, as if I were crowned at Rome. Wherefore reigning near
nineteen years, he received no crown of the Pope, for the cause which he
showed. Geneb. p. 988

words: I the crown of crowns, confirm unto my Prince, his power, etc. do
subject unto him cities, nations, of countries, Eagles defend my glory,
(behold the Gentiles.) Departing from Rome he had more rebels that opposed
themselves against him, over most of whom he triumphed. Then came news to him
to come into Apulia, where he should find Rupertus king of Apulia, deprived,
and delivered to him. The Emperor went toward Apulia. The Clemen. 2. tit. 9.

this murder, at the place and time of the worship of God according to his
word) there was every where a famine, after which followed a very great

the word of God.) Many wicked things are objected to these of Dulcinus, the
Begnardes, and Lolliards opinion. But because in the time of the heathen
Emperors, the devil did accuse the brethren: and in this time of Antichrist,
the beast does blaspheme them that dwell in heaven, their accusation may justly

factions) did set up. The greater part elected Ludouicus Banarus, the less
Fridericus Duke of Austria. Par. Vrs. 352.
Fridericus was favored by the Pope, the French King, etc. (It seems the Pope
willing to advance Fridericus, whose election was not good, thought to declare
the Empire to be void, that he might weaken Ludouicus of such offices in
Italy, etc. that might stand him in stead.) For in his first year he decreed,
Extr. Iho. 22. Si fratum.
that in the vacancie of the Empire (which he said then was, by the death of
Henry the seventh) the regiment, jurisdiction and disposing of the Empire,
deuolued to the Pope; unto whom in the person of Saint Peter, God committed the
rights of the earthly and heavenly Empire. He also accursed all Imperial
offices, as well spiritual as temporal, that in the vacancie were not
authorized by the Pope. After Par. Vrs. 353. Trith. p. 278.

all to Ludouicus. At this time, Trith. p. 277. 278.

CHAP. X.
Of the first resurrection and the wars which followed hereupon, with their
success.

MIserable are now the times, by reason of the gross ignorance and
superstition, which prevailed. For by the tyranny of the Popes, all men were
seduced, or terrified from the study and profession of true godliness. And the
wickedness of the Friars by purloyning, in a manner all good books (which now
were but manuscripts) and teaching nothing but fables; had made it generally
suspected, that Antichrist would take this opportunity to obliterate the
Scriptures etc; and obtrude unto the world any such forged divinity, which
might best serve to further his ambition.

In the time of this palpable darkness, worse then ever was any in Egypt, when
as the truth lay as dead, and buried for ever; the Lord in mercy does raise it
from death to life. And this does cause, Dan. 12.2.
such as turn others unto righteousness, to shine as the stars in the
firmament.

The sum of that which follows, is, that cap. 11.7.
when they (the witnesses) have finished their testimony, the beast that
comes out of the bottomless pit, with his horns, the Kings makes war
against them.

Of this war we are to consider the enemies; their manner of fight, and the
success.

The enemies are the two witnesses, cap. 19.13.
under their captain; yet in the wilderness, in this chapter; and in the
blessed time, separated from Antichrist, in the next chapter; and 19.
the beast with his Kings.

The captain of these witnesses, is mighty to enable them to finish their
testimony.

That the witnesses may the better finish and perfect their testimony, Saint
John does say. And 11.
I saw heaven open, that is, an expectation of all good men which belong to the
kingdom of heaven, what will be the end of those cruel laws, and bloody
executions.

That which befell was this, An cap. 18.1.
Angel came down from heaven, having great power, so that the earth was
lightened with his glory, that is, the glorious Gospel, which now was excluded
by all men, came by the mighty hand of God to be published and preached; to the
dispelling of the darkness, which Antichrist brought into the earth; as if it
had been brought from heaven, by the ministry of a mighty Angel, to enlighten
men. In the parable of this Angel, by whom is signified the Lamb Jesus Christ,
who is preached to the world; first is set down the description of himself
and his retinue; and then his wars. The parable is of a cap. 19.11.
horse, and his rider, as before in the sixth chapter. The horse does signify
the speedy posting abroad of the Gospel, even like lightning. And this horse
is white for the honor and good opinion, and reputation the rider, and those
that followed him did get among persons of honor, etc.

He that sat upon this white horse, was called (and reputed) faithful and
true; every way sincere. Contrary to the dissimulation of Antichrist, the
Popes; who were so unfaithful in their actions, and so false in their words
and writings, that no man could safely trust what they said or did.

He is also said to judge and fight righteously; dealing uprightly with all
men, and justly contending with his enemies, by word and deed; so that he
decideth all questions truly and rightly; and confuteth and impugneth his
adversaries according to the precise rule of equity. Contrary to the Popes,
who decide all doubts, and fight all their battles as may best serve their
only partialities and profits, without respect to justice; and hereof are
notoriously known to be guilty.

His ability to judge righteously appears by this, that cap. 19.12.
his eyes are as a flame of fire, by his clear and piercing insight, truly
discerning the very secrets of all things, which he looks upon, even as they
be. Contrary to the Popes, whose ignorance, or malice makes them unable
thoroughly to perceive and see, much less to foresee things as they be; as
appears by their continual accusing of innocents, and acquiting of ungodly
persons. And contrary to the popish Clergy, who know nothing, but what is
revealed to them by confession of such as neither will, nor can tell all;
whereas Heb. 4.12.13.
all things are naked and manifest to him, with whom we have to do, to wit,
the word of God.

As an argument of the iustnes of his wars and judgment, he has cap. 19.12
many crowns on his head; signifying the supreme authority of the Scriptures
to be such, as that all Kings and Princes and people, are in right subjects
thereunto; and so in this period shall acknowledge themselves to be; so that
when he fights, it is to subdue his rebels. Affronting the wicked
Antichristian Popes, who arrogantly wear a triple crown, usurping authority
and tyrannising over such as they have no interest in, but are, and ought to be
subjects of the word of God.

Of the name of this rider, it is said, he has a name written which no man
knew but himself; to show, that when the Popes, or others, do arrogate to
themselves alone, the sense and understanding of the Scriptures, as if they
were to judge thereof alone, Specul. Mino. tra. 3. f. 135. b.
pretending to have all knowledge and law in the cabenet of their own breasts,
they lie. For the written Scriptures, which are subject to no Judge, cannot be
understood but by the help of themselves; speaking elsewhere more evidently,
that which seems dark in any place. And hereof great persecution is to rise.

Furthermore, he is said cap. 19.13.
to be clothed in a garment dipped in blood, to signify the great effusion of
blood, by the martyrdom of such which should stand for the authority of the
word of God against the beast Antichrist. For from henceforth, the great
question is, of the authority, sufficiency, and understanding of the
Scriptures; about which are great contentions and persecutions.

His garment is also dipped in blood, to teach, that at last Isai. 63.1.2.3.
he shall victoriously triumph over his enemies, so as his garments shall be
red with the blood of the slain. This wonderful person, in plain terms, is
cap. 19.13.
the word of God; which though lately buried by the traditions, and ignorance,
and malice of men, now comes abroad again.

The retinue of this great and most mighty General, are said to be the cap.
19.14.
hosts that are in heaven; that is, such godly men, as are come forth into
Christian warfare; and Phil 3.20.
have their conversation in heaven; and therefore those of his side cap. 17.14.
are called chosen and faithful; professing the truth of the doctrine of
vocation, election, and faith; contrary to the vocation, election, and faith of
those which followed Antichrist; and therefore fought a good fight, under
persecutions.

These followed him, keeping themselves in all doctrines, to the steps of the
word of God; speedily and honorably as upon white horses cap. 19.14.
clothed in fine linen, white and pure, having put on the righteousness of
Christ, and Dan. 12.10.
being purified in the furnace of affliction.

Of the manner of this riders fighting, it is said that his weapons are sure,
and his confidence full of all assurance. Concerning his weapons, it is said,
that cap. 19.15.
out of his mouth went a sharp sword; so mighty and strong, that with it, he
should smite the heathen; signifying both the sharp, and fervent, and mighty
confutations of the wicked, which should be taken from the word of God;
sufficient to convince all the policy and superstition of the Gentiles, the
papists, by a word of his mouth; and also the hot wars, which the preaching
of the word should raise against Antichrist, and the remnant, etc.

His confidence in this war, is so great, that he does give assurance to all,
that in the end He Psalm. 2.9.
shall rule the heathen with a rod of iron, keeping them under by severe and
mortal laws. The reason of which assurance, is, that. He it is, that by the
ordinance of almighty God treads the winepresse, as a severe executioner of
the fiercenes and wrath of almighty God, against all his enemies.

First in token of his confidence, to triumph over all authority, so that
Kings, and Lords, etc. shall be his subjects, and servants; he cap. 19.16.
has upon his horsemans coat, or garment, a name written, cap. 17.14.
The King of Kings and Lord of Lords.

Secondly, to encourage his soldiers, and terrify his enemies, he causes it
to be generally proclaimed, or preached, as if cap. 14.8. and 18.2.
there followed an Angel, saying, Babylon, that great city, is fallen; it is
fallen, to that baseness; that whereas it was esteemed the seat and crown of
Kings and Princes; now it should become the habitation of devils, and hold of
all foul spirits, and a cage of every unclean, and hateful bird. The reasons
of this fearful judgment, are first, cap. 18.3.
because she made all nations to drink of the wine of the wrath of her
fornications; by diverse interdictions, execrations, exactions, tumults,
treasons, rebellions, murders, massacres, etc, bringing greiuous calamities
upon such, as refused to be subject unto the idolatry, superstitions, and
other filthy constitutions of that policicie, or city.

Secondly, because the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her;
giving their power to be executioners of her fornication; which is the cause
why the holy people depart from the ungodly commandments of them both.

Thirdly, because the Merchants of the earth, are waxed rich of the abundance
of such things which were gained by the merchandise of the word of God, and of
the kingdom of heaven, etc. which were sold of her pleasures, as pleased her
to bestow them. For now were sold both Sacraments, and Church, and heaven. They
do also abound in pleasures.

Now because of this abundant riches, and fatnes of the great and princely
Merchants; follows as a third argument of this riders confidence; namely a
public proclamation to all sorts of greedy people, to take away the livings of
the popish Clergy, be they great or small. And to this purpose cap. 19.17.18.
Saint John says, I saw an Angel stand in the sun, that is openly in all
men's fight, who cried with a loud voice, by preaching and teaching, and saying,
it is lawful to all the fowls that did fly by the midst of heaven; even
all covetous, hungry, and needy persons which were in estimation with Princes,
etc. to gather themselves together unto the supper of the great God, which he
had prepared by the hands of the popish prouiders and builders; who had cooked
their livings for gentlemen's mouths, etc. That they may eat the flesh, even
the fat livings of such as were advanced in the world as Kings, and the flesh
of high captains: namely the Cardinals and Abbots, etc. who now became
Generalles of wars, etc.

Contrarily, on the other side, the deputies of the Dragon, the devil, namely
cap. 19.19.
the beast, the popish policy, and the Kings, the ten principalities which
inhabited the two third parts of the earth, formerly subject to the Roman
Empire, and their have of judges, inquisitors, secular arm of familiars,
executioners and soldiers, etc. gathered themselves together to make war
against the word of God, which sat upon the horse, and against his army, all
those faithful people, which did stand for the authority and sense of the
Scriptures.

The success of this bloody fight, is begun in this chapter, but finished
afterward, and is, that the lamb and they that are on his side, though first
cap. 13.10.
overcome; yet by patience, in the end do overcome the Kings, that war
against him. For the beast, cap. 19.20.
which consisted of the Roman policy the Hierarchy, with the Princes, their
aides; was taken, so convicted by the equity of the cause of innocents, that
they were able but only to answer like a ravenous beast, viz, to gnashe upon
the saints, etc.

With the beast is also taken the false Prophet, which deceived the world, with
lying revelations; to wit, the Friars, Monks, Popes etc; which gloried in this
kind of vanity, and all their subtle and scholasticall sophistry profited
not: but was sifted and confuted so effectually, as that they were not able to
make it appear to be the truth: yea that false Prophet is taken which wrought
false miracles and lying signs before the beast, the Princes, whereby he
deceived them that received the beasts mark; his superstition and arms, and
deceived them that worshipped his Image, esteeming the Hierarchy as a God. All
their iugling is known and detested.

The means by which the false Prophet is taken, is, the cap. 20.1.
restraining the devil, the lying spirit in the mouth of wicked prophets, and
by the setting up of true justice, according to the word of God.

In the prophecy of the devils captivity, first the person is showed, by
whose ministry it is done, who is said to be cap. 18.1. and 20.1.
The Angel that came down from heaven, having great power to declare the power
of almighty God.

Secondly are showed the instruments which he used in this weighty work:
first, The key of the bottomless pit: namely, the true and faithful opening
of the doctrine of hell and damnation, as it is set down in the word of God;
far different, if not contrary to the doctrine of hell and purgatory, etc.
as it is delivered by Antichrist. Secondly, he has a great chain in his hand,
that is, Psalm. 149.8.9
the doctrine of the judgments of God, as it is written; different from that
which Antichrist does teach of binding and loosing. Now by these two means,
(the Lord together working mightily) cap. 20.2.
he apprehended the Dragon, that is, manifestly proved that the superstition
of the Gentiles brought into the Christian Church by the Popes, was abominable.
This Dragon was the old serpent, even the same that by his subtlety Genesis 3.1.
etc.
beguiled Eve; and now again by lying signs and revelations, and by
sophistical schoole-learning, deceives the world. He is the Devil, and not
the spirit of God in the mouths of popish Prophets: and Satan an adversary,
always an enemy to the good of mankind, especially to the Saints in their
prophecy; now reviving the persecutions which their ancestors the Gentiles and
Arians used against the truth.

This wicked spirit of the Antichristian prophets, is bound by restraint, by
the power of God, and cap. 20.3.
cast into the bottomless pit; all men assuring themselves that the spirit of
popish prophets is the devil of hell, who now is shut up, and sealed, that he
should deceive the people no more; but that all the sleights of Antichrist
should be as manifest, as was the madness of 2. Tim. 3.8.9
Iannes and Iambres.

The judgment also upon the beast, and the false prophet, which are the whole
body of Antichrist, is, that cap. 19.20.
they both were cast alive into the lake of fire burning with brimstone; not
only known to belong to hell, but in the mean time, seeing plagues, like
unto those of Sodom.

For the Princes henceforth do begin to cap. 17.16.
hate the whore for her inventions, wil-worships, and idolatries, etc. and make
her desolate, forsaking her; and naked, taking from her her costly ornaments;
and eat her flesh, by taking away her large revenues; and burn her with
fire, like Sodom in the end of her judgments.

The time of which destruction, appears by the computation of the reign of
Antichrist, namely, 1260. years, from the time of Pelagius, the angel of the
bottomless pit, to be near the year of Christ, 1820.

As touching the restoring of Christian justice, and the true administration
thereof, according to the word of God: first S. John does say, cap. 20.4.
And I saw thrones for judgment, and they that were fit sat upon them,
administering justice in judgment, according to the truth, and not according to
appearance or partiality: contrary to Antichrist, cap. 13.2.
to whom the dragon gave his power, and his throne, and great authority; that
after the 1. Pet. 5.8.
example of the devil, he, by his inquisitors, etc. might go about, seeking
whom he might devour.

Before these thrones the principal question that is handled, is, the cause of
such godly men, called by the scripture phrase, souls Act. 7.14. cap. 20.4.
that were as capitally punished, as if they were beheaded, not for treason,
but for the witness of Jesus, and for the word of God; as also, because that
following the word of God, they did not worship the beast, the civil tyranny;
nor his image, the Hierarchy of Rome: neither had taken his mark of
superstition; which causes, the iniquity of the times held equal to treason,
if not worse.

The sentence that was given at these judgment seats of this cause, was first,
that they which have suffered as the Martyrs of Christ, and for the word of
God, and because they would not worship the beast, nor his image, nor take the
superstitious mark of Antichrist, shall live, in the persons of such as
hereafter shall profess the same things. For the cause shall be adjudged to
deserve life, and not death, and therefore shall be defended from the tyranny
of Antichrist, by such as truly administer justice. Yea such also shall reign
with Christ, as worthy that office, honor, and sovereignty which is fitting a
true Christian man.

The second member of the judgment is, cap. 20.5.
that the rest of the dead men, which have died in the defense of the tyranny
of the Antichristian Popes, shall not live again in the Church; but shall be
justly reputed to be in hell, for their sins of treason, etc. whereas such as
profess the cause of the Martyrs, cap. 20.6.
are blessed, and holy, having their part in the first resurrection of the
Gospel, from the darkness in which it was buried by Antichrist; for on such the
second death has no power, howsoever Antichrist do threaten no less than
purgatory and hell to such. Yea they shall be as the holy people of God, who
are called a Exodus 19.6. 1. Pet. 2.9.
royal Priesthood. For they shall be kings and Priests unto God, and of
Christ, and shall reign with him.

Hereupon the cap. 18.9. etc. 15.
Princes, and Merchants, and Ship-men, namely the officers of the popish gain,
shall lament and howl, but yet shall provide for their safety, standing far
off from the danger. But 20. etc.
the Saints shall rejoice and triumph for the destruction of Antichrist, that
is cast into hell, like a millstone into the sea. The cap. 19.21.
remnant also shall be slain with the sword of him that sat upon the horse;
namely, the Turks shall be convicted by the power of the scriptures, when
Antichrist is cast to hell: and then shall be fulfilled that which is written,
The Dan. 8.14. and 7.27.
sanctuaries shall be cleansed; and again, And the kingdom and dominion and
greatness of the kingdom under the whole heaven shall be given to the holy
people of the most high, whose kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and all
powers shall serve and obey him.

The continuance of this period, from the reviving of the Gospel to the next
enemies, is 1000. year: so long shall the Gospel come abroad, get the victory,
and flourish in his due season; and so long shall men condemn the cruelty of
Antichrist. And these 1000. years are to begin, where the Dan. 12.11.
1290. years spoken of by Daniel do end; namely, in the year of Christ 1364.
whence we are to reckon the first resurrection.

from their ungodly life, and held a congregation. Catharina Senensis spoke of
the reformation of the Church; Matthew Paris notes the Pope to be Antichrist,

Hildegrade, that the devil spoke of the Priests of this time, dainty bankets

And thus the first resurrection appears.

CHAP XI.
The wars begun at the first resurrection are continued, etc. And the
resurrection is more manifest.

NOw is come that blessed time which the Prophet Dan. 12.12.
Daniel spoke of, namely, 1335. days, that is, years after the destruction of
Jerusalem, which was in the year of Christ, 74. At which time is a more clear
demonstration of the first resurrection. For here also do end those cap. 12.6.
1260. days, that is years, to be reckoned from the tenth year of Antonius
Pius, which was in the year of Christ, 149. when the woman the Church fled
into the wilderness, after she had brought forth many contagious professors,
as a man child. During which time she remained confusedly amongst the wicked,
as in a wilderness full of Dragons and Ostriches. But now Dan. 12.2.
many that were as sleeping, and dead in the dust, do rise up to everlasting
life, and their cause does come abroad by the reviving of the Gospel. Here
therefore is continued the first resurrection, and the war between the word
of God, and the hosts in heaven that followed him: against the beast, and the
kings of the earth. And here is that blessed time, in which the witnesses do
separate themselves from the kingdom of Antichrist. The means by which they
separate themselves from Antichrist, the beast, is said to be, that those of
the spirit of Saint John cap. 18 4.
heard a voice from heaven, to wit, from the Church of God, in the persons of
his witnesses, who had learned the doctrine of salvation of the God of heaven,
out of his word, and also had spread it abroad in the world.

The doctrine is a commandment from God, the same which was given to the
Isai. 48.20. Ier. 51.6. Zach. 2.6.
Isralites, that were in the captivity of Babylon. Go cap. 18.4.
out of her my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye
receive not of her plagues. For now the people of God do see, that she that
took upon her to forgive others their sins, is not able herself to escape
the damnation of hell, nor those other plagues, which every man foresaw would
light upon her for her own sins.

The cause why men should fly from her, is, for cap. 18.5.
that the heaps of her sins do reach up to heaven; being infinite and
prodigious, even fighting against the God of heaven; and ascending like the
sins of Sodom and Egypt. As also because that God has remembered her
iniquities, to take vengeance of them, as he did of Sodom and Egypt. For these
two witnesses are Gods Genesis 18.21. and 19.5. Exodus 2.7.
messengers, to make experience whether the sins of Antichrist be as it is
reported, and henceforth principally detect her sins and reprove them.

The plagues are first proclaimed, and then required to be executed.

And this Proclamation is made as by the third cap. 14.9. etc.
Angel which followed them that before first revived the preaching of the
eternal Gospel, and threatened the fall of Babylon. He mightily brings in the
doctrine of vengeance to be inflicted upon Antichrist; as if he said with a
loud voice. If any man worship the beast, of heretical monarchs; and his
image, the papacy, and receive his mark in his forehead, or in his hand,
following those superstitions; henceforth the same shall drink of the wine of
the wrath of God; yea of the pure wine which is powered into the cup of his
wrath, and he shall be tormented in fire and brimstone, before the holy Angels,
and before the Lamb. And the smoke of their torment shall ascend evermore, and
they shall have no rest night or day that worship the beast and his image, and
whosoever receives the print of his name.

Here 12. cap. 13.10.
are the fruits of the patients of the Saints; and here ar they that keep the
commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus, the executioners of the
fiercenes of the wrath of almighty God.

That which is required to be executed, is, that the Saints, who hitherto have
been persecuted, should take the sword in hand, and ^ap. 18.6.
reward her, to wit popish Babylon, as she has rewarded them, and give her
double, according to her works; in the cup that she has filled, fill her the
double. For now begins the execution of that which is promised. cap. 13.10.
If any lead into captivity, he shall go into captivity; If any man kill
with the sword, he must be killed by a sword.

She must also be tormented for her pleasures and pride, cap. 18.7.
For she says in her heart, I sit being a Queen, of all other Churches, and
shall see no mourning; the ship of Peter in which I sit may be tossed, but it
shall not sink.

As these things are threatened, so 8.
shall (in due time) her plagues come in one day, together; death, sorrow and
famine, and she shall be burnt with fire, for that God which condemns her, is
a strong God.

During the time of which executions, if any died in the cause against
Antichrist; they are Martyrs; as it is said of all men in the Church of God.
cap. 14.13.
Then I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me, write, the dead that die in
the Lord, are henceforth fully blessed, even so says the spirit, whose
testimony is true, and no lie; for they rest from their labors, never feeling
the terror of the second death, or purgatory, by the execration of Antichrist.
And their works follow them, to receive a crown at the throne of God.

This testimony being thus finished, and continually preached by the two
witnesses, and of many believed, cap. 11.7.
The beast that comes out of the bottomless pit, makes war against them,
and overcomes them, for a while.

The beast that comes out of the bottomless pit, is (as has been showed
before) the politic body of popery, consisting of the Pope and his Clergy;
assisted with those ten kingdoms and principalities, which did arise after
the wounding of the Empire to death. All which grew to be an united body by the
doctrine of purgatory, and delivering of the dead from pain, which doctrine
the Popes invented. This beast does war upon the Martyrs of Christ, not
only as barbarously, as wild beasts do rampe upon men; but also as wickedly,
as if the devil himself came from the bottomless pit, in his own person, to
devour the godly.

The success of this war is doubtful. For first, 7.
the beast does overcome the witnesses, and after that it self is first to be
frighted, of which is spoken in this chapter; and then to be vexed, captiued,
and killed; of which the text has been partly interpreted in the former
chapter, in the general view of this period; the rest will be seen in the next
chapter, to wit, how he is vexed.

The victory of the beast appears, both by the death of these two witnesses
whom the beast does kill; and also by his triumphing over them.

Concerning their death, the beast will have it so, that cap. 11.8.
their corpse shall be killed in the streets, or open places of the great
city of their Antichristian policy. For as at this time, so from hence they
burn the Martyrs, in their greatest and most famous cities. But the city
where this cruelty is committed, is not a place where any good people be, that
may lament the persecutions of the Saints, Theod. 4. 22.
as when the Arians persecuted the Catholics. But this city is it, which
spiritually in a figurative speech borrowed from the most abominable cities
and places mentioned in the Scriptures, is called Sodom; because the two
witnesses are assaulted for the pollution of their spirits, as the Sodomits did
strive to pollute men's bodies; and because reproving the filthiness of the
Antichristian citizens, they found no more favor, then Genesis 19.9.
Lot did in Sodom. It is also called Egypt, for their Ezech. 16.26
unspeakable idolatry, and for the spiritual servitude that all men were in
to the papacy, worse then the Egyptians, or Isralites were to Pharaoah; but
especially because the Popes had commanded the Bishops and inquisitors to kill
all godly preachers, and hearers; and by name the two witnesses; as Exodus 1.16.
Pharaoh commanded the Midwiues to kill the male children of the Jews. It is
also called Egypt, because the message of Jesus Christ, in the mouths of the
two witnesses, was there despised, as Exodus 5.2.
Moses and Aron were despised by Pharaoh, when they made mention of the Lord,
etc. Moreover the place is said to be where our Lord also was crucified; to
signify that the same policy that crucified Christ, did also kill his Martyrs;
and by name these two witnesses. Thus distinguishing this beast from the
Turks; and showing that howsoever the popish religion, in name is
distinguished from the Roman heathen cruelty; yet in deed, spiritually, it
is the same without material difference.

The manner of their killing, far exceeds the manner of their ancestors the
Arians, whose image they be. For the Soc. 2. 23. Theod. 2. 14.
Arians did hide the bodies of them whom they had killed; but here, they of the
people, and kindreds, cap. 11.9.
and tongues, and gentiles, do see, or gaze upon their corpse; the better to
satisfy their cruel eyes. Not for an hour, but for three days and a half,
that is, three years and a half, their barbarous bloody eyes were insatiable.
Yet like Arians, or rather like the Gentiles, whose image they be, Theod. 2.
14. Eus. 5. 1. ^. p. 62.
they shall not suffer their carcasses to be put in Momments. Afterward in
triumph, the inhabitants of the earth, even the people of all the christian
earth, whose governors more regarded the possession of the earth, then the
getting of heaven, cap. 11.10.
rejoice over them whom they have slain, as their fathers Theod. 4. 22.
the Arians did over the Catholics, and they be glad, and send gifts one to
another in token of happy victory. For these two prophets, after the example
of Moses, and Elias, and the rest of the prophets, by the word of the Lord, 1.
King. 8.17
vexed them that dwell upon the earth; by reproving their carnal religion,
earthly policies, and worldly sinful lives. And thus far the beast gets
the upper hand. Howbeit, the cause of the Gospel maintained by these witnesses,
is revived. For notwithstanding this triumph, cap. 11.11.
after three days and a half; that is, three years and a half, the spirit
of life, coming from God, shall enter into them, which were killed; and they,
by the means of them whom God shall raise up to defend their cause, shall, as
it were, stand up upon their feet.

The effect which follows, when their cause is again set on foot, is, that
great fear shall come upon them, which being their enemies, did see or gaze
upon their corpse.

First they fear because their cause on the contrary part was so much affected
by their friends, and so earnestly pursued to their holy praise and eternal
commendations, that whereas the beast had accursed them as devils, to the
bottomless pit, they are as truly honored for Martyrs, as if cap. 11.12.
they heard a great voice from heaven, even from all godly men saying unto
them, come up hither and receive the crown provided for holy Martyrs.

And hereupon, they being the true members, and Martyrs of Jesus Christ, who
after his sufferings and death, did ascend up to heaven in a cloud, are
acknowledged, through him, in soul to ascend up to him, as truly, as if they
had ascended in a cloud. And whereas Christ Act. 1.9.
did ascend in the presence of his Apostles, and friends; these do ascend,
that even their very enemies do see them accounted to be gone to heaven.

The second cause of their fear, is, by reason that cap. 11.13.
at the same hour or instant, when this due regard is given to these two
witnesses, which were thus wickedly murdered, there was a great earthquake,
and emotion in the hearts and hands of many, moved by the indignity of their
death. And this earthquake and emotion bred this effect, that both one tenth
part, or kingdom, of the great city, of popish policy, fell from them; and
also, that in those troubles, called by the name of an earthquake, are slain
to the number of 7000; that is, very many. But are therefore called 7000.
because the beast does blaspheme them that brought these troubles upon him;
accompting those Papists, and Priests, which worshipped the beast, and were
slain in the emotion, as the 7000. which bowed not the knee to Baall, and were
persecuted by Ahab.

Another effect of the reviving of their cause, is, that cap. 11.13.
the remnant, the other nine kingdoms, of the politicians, which held with the
beast, are also sore feared, even as the wicked, that fled when none followed:
and as the soldiers of the Arian Soc. 5. 14.
Maximus, fled for fear upon the rumor of the coming of Theodosius, the true
Christian Prince. Albeit the rest of the Arians presumed and reported
Theodosius to be defeated, whence the Papists have learned to spread
presumptuous lying news. Howbeit at last, even for fear, they give glory to
the God of heaven.

These Fox in hunc locum.
things do most aptly agree unto the times of the preaching, and martyrdom of
John Hus, and Ierom of Prage, etc. before, and at the Council of Constance,
and to the effects that followed thereupon.

The complement.
Alexander the fifth Fox Mart. p. 531. 567.
was chosen Pope to take away the schism. In his time the Boemians, Anno 1409.
by the preaching of John Hus, etc, increased much in the knowledge of the
Gospel: for before this time, by the spreading of Wickliefes books, they began
to taste and savor of it. Peuce. 5. f. 156. 157.
The sum of his preaching was a reprehension of the fornication, covetousness
and pride of the Priests etc, and against the magic consecrations, of the
oil, water etc. He proved his assertions by the word of God, the holy
scriptures; unto which alone he would reduce all doctrine. Hereupon grew
contentions in the University of Prage. And when those which did strive for
the Pope, were not able to resist the found testimonies of the scripture,
alleged by Hus, they left the University. Fox Mart. 532
When the Pope heard of these preachings and disputations, he sent his bull
unto the Archbishop, requiring him to look that no such things were
maintained; and cited John Hus to appear before him. John Hus answers, the
Bull to be contrary to the doings and examples of Christ and his Apostles; and
to restreine (or fight against) the free course of the word of God. (Wherefore
he appealeth from this mandate, to the same Pope better advised. But as he was
prosecuting of his appeal, the Pope died, there died also the Archbishop etc,
cap. 11.5.
by the fire that proceeded out of the mouth of Christ's witnesses, etc.

John the twentieth three, Gobel. aet. 6. cap. 90.94.
a devil incarnate, Anno 1410.
and a most profound inuentor of all sorts of infamous wickedness: most
rigorous. He received of the harlots of one city, viz B^nenia, 300. florens
every month, for tribute of their whoredom, etc. The King of Sicilia brake
into Rome, which the Pope not forseeing, with many Curtizans was spoiled. Unto
Fox Mart. p. 567.
this Pope (or rather beast) was Hus accused for an heretic; because he seemed
rather willing to preach the Gospel, then the bishops traditions. The Pope
commits the matter to the Cardinal of Columna, who monished Hus to appear
at Rome. Wenceslaus King of Romans, and Boem, at the suite of his wife, the
whole nobility, city, and University of Prage, sent Ambassadors to Rome,
craving the Pope, to remit the citation of Hus, and to determine his cause in
Boem. Hus also sent proctors to Rome to purge him, because he would avoid that
dangerous journey. The Cardinal at Rome, notwithstanding the Kings petition,
exco^municateth Hus, and emprisoneth some of his proctors; so that the rest
return without doing any thing. Howbeit Hus, notwithstanding his
excommunication, goes on in preaching; and appealed from the Pope to Christ.
Yea Fox Mart. 569.
when the Popes bull came to Prage, proclaiming full remission of sins, to
all such as would fight on his side (for the Pope had war with the king of
Naples). Hus, and his followers, manifestly spoke against the Bull, three lay
men were beheaded for speaking against these pardons; whom Hus, and such
Priests as favored him, interred sumptuously, saying; These be the Saints,
which for the Testament of God, did give their bodies. At Peuce. 5. f. 168.
this time were three Popes at once, every one fighting against the other with
condemnations, and execrations. But as Socr. 5. 22.
the Arians, did not strive for religion, but by reason of their overmuch
desire of honor, with which their minds were wholly possessed, did fight among
themselves for the primacie, whereupon many of the Clergy, hating the
contention sprung of the desire of vain glory, departed from them, to the
ancient faith: so these did not strive for the glory of the son of God, or
for the mending of such corruptions, as were in manners and doctrine; but for
the principality. (Wherefore many departed from them.) When the Emperor
Sigismund did see, that these evils would be more duly reformed by a Council,
than by arms, he having run over Italy, Spain, France, and England with
incredible speed, and wonderful patience, in great labors, by consent of the
kings, caused the Counsel of Constance to be 1414. dece^. 3.
assembled, which was frequented with the presence, or Legates of the Princes
of all the Christian world; as also thither came from Bizantium, and
Trapezuntium, a concourse of most diverse cap. 11.9.
people, and kindreds, and tongues, and gentiles, Geneb. p. 1059
so that there were numbered of strangers of all sorts, 60,500.

After Gobel. 6. c. 94
the Council assembled, the whole affairs of the Council were committed to
the determination of four Prelates, chosen out of four Nations: which much
displeased the Pope, and his Cardinals. In this Council, they proposed to
reform the Church, in the head and members. Peut. 5. f. 175.
Wherefore Petrus de Aliaco, very gravely admonished the Council of the most
corrupt conditions of the Popes, the court of Rome, and of al degrees of the
Roman Church; for the city is Sodom. He also admonished the Council of the
many superstitions, and of the tyranny then used: for this city is also
Egypt. Specul. Minor. Tract. 3. f. 167. etc.
There were also proposed diverse complaints against the friars, for their
(Sodomiticall) filthy life: and for their pride, and cruelty: who were like
ruffians and cutters, to kill them that admonished them of their faults; Exodus
2.11.13.14.
worse then the Egyptian that wronged the Israelite, or the Israelite that
reproched Moses, or the Sodomites that railed on Let. The like was done by
other that desired reformation. In this Council Mass. 18. p. 255. Gobel 6.94.
the Pope Fox. Mart. p. 604. in epist. Huss.
whom the Preachers were wont to call the God of the earth, was convicted of
more than forty grievous crimes, for which he was deposed.

Unto Fox in hunc locum and Mar. 1575. etc.
this Council came John Hus, under the safe conduct of the Emperor; and there
continued under the warrantie of the Popes promise; and thither was Hierom of
Prage cited. Those two were shut up in most horrible and filthy prisons,
(far worse then sackcloth.) When Hus came to the Council, he desired leave
to answer the objections brought against him. But (whereas Christ, was not
only permitted, but also required to answer for himself before Pilate) he was
commanded to hold his peace. Wherefore in that confusion he cried out,
confirming his assertions by scripture, and appealed from that wicked synagogue
to Christ. He reproved the corrupt manners of this assembly, and had the same
regard which Lot had in Sodom, when he reproved their violence. Howbeit,
contrary to the Emperors safe conduct, and to the Popes promise, he was
condemned to the fire (Beware of men for they shall deliver you up to the
Councels) For now is fulfilled the prophecy of the 2. Tim. 3.1.3 Peucer. 5. f.
176. etc.
last time, Mat. 10.17.
which should be perilous, for trucebreakers. His garments were taken from
him, as Christ had his; he was crowned with a paper Miter, Mat. 10.25.
with painted devils, as Christ was with thorns. If they call the master of
the house Beelzebub, how much more them of the householde? The principal cause
of his condemnation was the same that the Arians objected to Athanasius. Soc.
2. 5.
Athanasius was accused, because when he was removed from his ministry, he
took it again, without the consent of the Council. And Hus Fox Mart. p. 603.
was not only accused by this Council, (the lively image of the Arians) but
also condemned; because he continued preaching, when he was excommunicated.
Also Ierom of Prage was likewise used. Before their death, they prophesied. For
Hus, who in the Boemian tongue does signify a Goose, prophesied, that after
him should come a Swan, who^ they should not burn so easily. And Ierom cited
the Council, after an hundred years, to answer God, and him. These prophecies
do seem accomplished in Luther.

Before their execution, Orig in Ephe.
was a fearful eclipse of the Sun. For the Stars were seen, as in the
night; and the birds by the sudden darkness fell to the ground. Hus Buchol.
ann. 1415.
and Prage were condemned by the Council; and by them committed to the civil
Magistrate, to be put to death. For they themselus, as the Ioh. 18.31.
Jews cried to Pilate, might not lawfully put any man to death. But when they
were dead, they would not grant as much favor to their ashes, as Ioh. 10.1^.
Pilate did to the body of Christ, to be put in graves, but Eus. 5. 1 p. 62.
they strawed their ashes in the Rhine, as the Gentiles did the Christians into
the river of Rhodanus, to take away all hope of their resurrection.

The memory also of John Wickleife was condemned. For it was decreed, that his
bones should be taken out of his grave, herein showing themselves more cruel
and unnatural, then were the Arians against the Catholics.

Mass. 18. p. 255
Pope Martine, and the Emperor rejoiced together: because that at the last,
peace was restored to the Church. For these two vexed them that dwell upon the
earth. So did the Theod. 4. 22.
Arians rejoice, when they had oppressed the innocent Catholics. The Fox
Mart. p. 575.
Pope gave gifts also. For he gave full absolution to all that were present at
the Council; and also he gave another indulgence at the hour of death, to
the masters and household. But so as the pardons must be procured under seal,
that they may give gifts one to another.

In Gob. ae. 6. cap. vlt.
this Council, was no reformation of doctrine and manners. Caranza.
The institution of Christ and practice of the Primitive Church in the
ministration of the Sacrament, of both kinds, was antiquated: yet do they boast
of antiquity. It Mass. 10.19.
was decreed, that faith is not to be kept with heretics and other
blasphemers. This Geneb. page 1059. c. 11.9.
Council continued three year and a half; which the Scriptures call in a
prophetical speech, three days and a half. This Pope Martine is reported to
have dispensed with a man to marry his sister. Fasc. Temp. p. 87. 88.
So corrupt were the times, that of them it is said, that conscience according
to the fear of God, abounding in times past in the Prelates, did by laudable
manners and examples, set up and advance the Church of Christ. In process of
time, abounding with temporalties, forgetting conscience, they trusted upon
science, which makes proud; palliating the holy Scriptures with diverse
impostures, not fearing to falsify the justice of the Lord, etc. But (O
abomination) con and sci, are raised out of conscience, and only (entia)
insensible creatures, which neither have knowledge nor conscience, do govern
the spouse of Christ, etc.

At Geneb. 1060.
this time the Turks recover that which Tamerlane had taken from them, remove
their seat into Greece, come over Danubium and get much.

When Par. Vrsp. p. 381.
these Martyrs were killed by the Council, the spirit of life coming from
God, entered into the witnesses. For first threescore, then fifty and four of
the Nobles of Boem wrote to the Council, by their letters patents; showing
themselves to be wronged in the death and cause of Hus; and testified that they
would defend the preaching of the word of God, with the hazard of their lives,
etc. and so fulfill the precept: cap. 18.4.
Go out of her my people, etc.

But 1419. Bucholcer. Fox Ma^t. p. 621. 622. etc.
after three prophetical days, and a half; the three years and a half in
which the Council was held, the nobles, and people of Boem, enter into a sure
league, and the cause of the witnesses does again stand on foot, whereupon
the Pope and Princes fear.

The Boemians assemble, and celebrate the memory of Hus, and Prage, as of
great Martyrs ascended to heaven; and decree the same yearly to be kept. And
because the Pope had thundered, and that with the Princes he resolved to send
armies against them, the Boemians chose Zisca for their General; and so began
the Boemians war for Hus, etc. which may justly be compared to a great
earthquake. In this emotion, Zisca wins much. 1420. Bucholcerus.
The city of Prage, defecting from the Emperor, joins with Zisca, and his
Thaborites, who by stratagems overcomes his enemies, and has the word of God
faithfully preached, and the Sacraments duly administered publicly. And (that
he might execute the commandment, cap. 1^.6.

Sigismund with a new great army, recovering some places by force or surrender;
but when Zisca, now blind, rushed upon him, he fled with fear and trembling;
many of his nobles were slain, his cariages lost, and his horsemen drowned
under the ye. After this, 1424. Par. Vrsp. 385.
Zisca, who eleven times joined battle with the enemies of the Hussites, and
overcame them, died of the plague. But after the Hussites now calling
themselves orphans, still standing for their lives, Fox Mart. p. 625. etc.
against the Popes most cruel bulls, and their fierce enemies, 1426. Buch.
the Misnenses were overthrown by the Hussites in battle. 1427. Buch.
The Electors of the Empire, entered Boem against the Hussites with an army,
which they thought sufficient to overcome all Boem. But upon the rumor that the
Hussites were coming, so great fear came upon them, that all that numbersome
army of Almaines and English, before they saw any enemy, took themselves to
flight, in stead of fighting; as did the tyrant Soc. 5. 14.
Maximus the Arian, when he fled from before Theodosius. But the enemies of the
Hussites would not thus rest. For 1431. Peuce. 5. f. 170. Buch.
the Cardinal Julian, had the leading of a very great army; with which the
Princes secular and spiritual furnished him. When he entered Boem, the Hussites
few in number, were coming against him. But before the enemy came in sight,
the who^^ army of the Cardinal was stricken with such a fear, that they most
shamefully fled, leaving the Hussites rich with the spoil. The Fox Mart. p.
633. etc.
Cardinal with a lamentable oration; sought to slay his army; but all in
vain. Thus Boemia, the tenth part, or kingdom of the city of popish policy,
fell away. Page 645.
Pope Martine called a Council, where he appointed for president his Legate
Julian, to root out heresy (meaning the Hussites;) but presently the Pope
died.

Ann. 1431.
Eugenius Geneb. 1065.
the fourth assembled a Council at Basil, for the reformation of the Church,
and amendment of the manners of the laytie and Clergy. As also against the
Hussites. Fox Mart. p. 665. 666. etc.
Here the Fathers seemed to make great conscience to provide for the good of
the Church. In which course they were confirmed by the hand of God, who visited
them with a horrible pestilence. For hereupon came a sudden fear upon the
fathers, yea there was great fear and trembling throughout the whole Council,
which gave glory to God, swearing they would seek nothing but the only
salvation of Christian people, etc. In this Council was acknowledged, that the
preaching of the Gospel ought to be free, and faithful. Sin ought to be
punished. The Boemians might receive the Sacrament of the Supper in both
kinds. Throughout the Church apt and meet Ministers ought to be appointed,
which might shine in virtue and knowledge to the glory of Christ, and
healthful edification of the Christian people. In Geneb. 1067.
this Council was again published the book called Pragmatica sanctio, for
abridging the Popes authority and gain. Mass. 19. p. 262.
Of which book it is said, The Pragmaticall sanction was instituted in the
Council of Constances, confirmed by the Council of Basil, by Engenius,
Nicholaus, and Calistus, to the honor of God, the strengthening of the Church,
and the provision for good schools. That the ordinary conferrers of dignities
might not be defrauded; that those which were ondered, might not be compelled
to go to Rome; that the French money might not serve the Italians. Par. Vrsp.
p. 396.
The Turks did send great presents to the Emperor, now at the Council with
Oration; desirous to conclude an eternal peace. Thither also sent the Emperor
of Constantinople his Orators; wishing there might he made a perfect union. At
this Council Eugenius the Pope was deposed; because he labored to remove the
Council from thence; and another was chosen in his stead; Geneb. 106^.
Bucholcerus. Ann. 1438. 1439. Peuc^^. 5. f. 118.
but Eugenius held another Council at Florence. Here the Emperor of
Constantinople, upon hope to get aid against the Turks, received the
communion of the Church of Rome, in the matter of the Popes supremacy,
purgarory, confirmation, etc. but not transubstantiation. Caran. f. 589.
There presently of a sudden died Joseph the Patriarch of Constantinople;
trembling and languishing as he was writing an instrument of his consent to the
Pope. The Grecians returning home, finding the Pope to fail of his promise,
dissented again from the Church of Rome more then at the first. Par. Vrsp. p.

The Turks now broken by the Christians, make peace; where to the Christians
swear on the Evangelists, the Turk on his Alcaron. This peace grieved
Cardinal Julian: wherefore upon the Popes letters, that no peace was
effectual without his consent, Julian absolueth the Princes from their oath,
and (that in her might be found all the blood that is shed) they fought
against the Turks at Varna. Where the Christians by a miserable slaughter
suffered unspeakable loss. Here also Cardinal Julian dishonorably finished
his life.

Nicholaus Volat^^^^.
the fifth kept a Iubile at Rome, Anno 1447
where thousands were killed with horse feet, and very many were drowned. The
Emperor of Constantinople was sc^^t returned again, from uniting himself and
his Grecians to the Church of Rome but Peucerus. 5. Par. Vrs. p. 405. Ann. 1553.
Constantinople was taken by the Turks who used there more violence then can
be expressed with tongue. For partaking of her sins they receive of her
plagues. Geneb. 1073.
Upon the ruin of the Empire of Constantinople, the knowledge of the Greek
tongue is brought and spread all over the Latin Europe, from whence it had
exiled 700. years. Page 1071.
About this time was perfected the late invented laudable art of printing,
Pasc. Tem. f. 89. b.
the art of arts, and science of sciences, a treasure of wisdom and knowledge
to be desired.

This leaping as it were out of the dens of darkness, does enrich and
enlighten the world: virtue contained in infinite books, only found at Paris
and Athens, known to very few, was by this art manifested to all nations, and
kindreds and tongues, and people. Whereupon is fulfilled that in the Proverbs,
wisdom cries in the streets. This Bucho. Volat. 22. Geneb. p. 1071.
Pope revived human learning, seeking books; giving stipends to Readers,
students, and translators; entertained the learned, and spread many learned men
abroad in diverse places.

Ladislaus being crowned King of Boem, it was granted to every one, that at his
pleasure, he might receive the supper of the Lord, under one or both kinds.
Podiebrachius, who was next unto the King, was moved by a parasite, why he
liked not their religion (of popery) required by the example and authority of
so many and great Princes, rather then the Hussites. He answered, we do those
sacrifices, which we believe are pleasing to God; neither is it in our own
choice to believe what we list. The mind is overcome with great reasons, etc.
I am persuaded of my ministers religion. If I follow thy religion, I may
perchance deceive men, contrary to my soul; I cannot deceive God, which
looks into the hearts of men, etc.

Bucholcer. Par. Vrsp. 406.
Calistus the third, in his second year, Mahomet with a 150,000. beseeged
Belgrade. Capistranus, a Minorite Friar stood to encourage the Soldiers. But
he used not any superstitions. For crying out he said, Jesus look on us, be
present with thy people, that suffers for thee; where are thy mercies of old?
Come and defend thy people, least they say among the Gentiles, where is now
their God, etc. The Christians got a rich and noble victory. In memory whereof
the Pope according to his wonted superstition foolishly instituted the feast of
the transfiguration of Christ. Hunniades who had been a noble victor over the
Turks, after this his last battle, fell sick; but he would not have the
Sacrament brought to him (as the superstitious manner was) but commanded
himself to be carried to the Church, where after the confession of his sins,
he received the Eucharist, etc.

Thus much of the two witnesses, and the things which fell out upon their death
and resurrection.

Thus the remnant gives to glory to God. And now the cap. 11.14.
second woe to the inhabitants of the earth, by the Turks, etc. seems to be
past. But the third woe will come anon.

CHAP. XII.
Of the third cap. 11.14.
woe to the inhabitants of the earth by Kings converted to Christ.

WE are now come to speak of the third woe, which shall be inflicted upon the
inhabitants of the earth; namely such which do rather desire to possess the
earth, then to inherit heaven. And this contains the abolishing of the
kingdom of Antichrist; and the victorious reign and triumph of the word of
God. That which is spoken hereof, is comprehended in the doctrine which came
abroad, when cap. 11.15.
the seventh Angel blew the trumpet. The sum whereof is manifestly known,
and evidently spoken, by all godly men, as if there were great voices in
heaven, expressing their assurance of the things that are to come to pass. And
the sum is this, that certainly it can not be, but the kings will also be
converted to the Gospel by whose only and holy administrations The kingdoms
of this world are (to be) our Lords, and his Christ's and he shall reign for
evermore. Hereupon all godly magistrates and ministers, called by the name of
the cap. 11.16.
four and twenty elders, which make any consciecne of their places, as those
which sit before God on their seats; First, do humble themselves even falling
on their faces, and subiecting themselves to this kind of administration.

Secondly, they do also leave the service of idols and men, and in their
places worship God, both with praises, and administration of justice.

As for their praises, they do in effect, say, cap. 11.17.
we give thee thanks Lord God almighty, which art, and which wast, and which
art to come; even the same God which art everlasting, for that taking the power
out of the hands of mortal, weak, and mutable men, who of long time have
trodden thy sanctuary under foot, thou have received (the entrance and
possession of) thy great might, and have obtained thy kingdom, in due time to
be fully and alone administered by thee.

As for their sincere administration of justice, they show that they so regard
the faithful profession of the Gospel, that thereupon, such which rather
professed the vanity of the Gentiles, then Christ, (even the Antichristian
Papists) were cap. 11.18.
angry.

The cause of their anger is, first, that the time is come of the wrath of God,
to be inflicted upon whosoever shall deserve it; without respect of persons.

Secondly, because they see that the time is come of the dead, which have been
martyred, for the witness of Jesus; that they should be judged, whether they
died as innocents or not; so that the proceedings against such come to be
looked into and examined again by justice faithfully, which they are angry
should be known.

Thirdly, because that God has raised up Christian Kings, that God by them
should give reward unto his servants, the prophets, which do sincerely speak
the truth from the Lord; whereas Antichrist did tread them under foot. Yea,
because the time was come, that he by Princes should give reward also to the
Saints, and to them that (in deed) do fear his name to small and great, whom
Antichrist exposed to death and confiscation, loading them with reproaches, etc.

Fourthly, because the time is come, that God by Princes should utterly destroy
them, which destroy the earth, be they Turks or Papists.

The advancement of the godly, and destruction of the wicked, according to the
exact rule of justice, in the word of God, being thus drifted by godly
Governors; those of the spirit of Saint John, cap. 15.1.
saw another great and marvelous sign in heaven, the Church of God. Namely,
that God has prepared seven Angels, having the seven last plagues, which he
would inflict upon his enemies, for, not by men, but by them, even by a divine
hand, is now to be fulfilled the wrath of God.

Of these plagues, we are to consider the place whence these Angels do receive
them, and the pouring of them forth.

These plagues are delivered unto them in the temple; which, after the godly
do put on zeal and thanksgiving, is opened.

Concerning the zeal of the godly, first is declared how the true doctrine of
Christian baptism is restored, namely that Christians ought to be undefiled,
and zealous in the cause of Christ. For the lauer of regeneration is now
figured cap. 15.2.
by a glassie sea mingled with fire, godly Princes and people, being baptized
Mat. 3.11.
with the holy Ghost and fire, whereas hitherto they were baptized unto
repentance with patience.

Here therefore stand the Boemians, which had gotten the victory over the
beast, the ciuell estate which bears up the whore of Babylon, and of his
image, the Ecclesiastical policy; and his mark of superstitious ceremonies;
and of the number of his name, his armies which he sent against them.

These I say stand constantly, at the glassie sea, mingled with fire,
continuing sincere and zealous professors; being so far from being overcome;
that contrarily they have the harpes of God to sing praises unto their God for
their deliverance from Antichrist.

And they being delivered from the kingdom of Antichrist, which spiritually is
called Egypt, cap. 15.3.
sing the like song, as was that of Moses the servant of God, when he was past
the red sea. And they sing also the song in praise of the Lamb, Jesus Christ;
who had delivered them from the beast of insatiable rapine, etc.

The argument of the song was in effect, Great and merueilous are thy works,
cap. 15.4.
Lord God almighty, just and true are thy ways, king of saints. Who shall
not fear thee, O Lord (and not men) and glorify thy name, with the contempt
of men? For thou only, art holy, and the world by the kingdom of Antichrist
is filthy, and corrupted. And also, how ever yet Antichrist do lift up
himself, and do fight to maintain his kingdom, yet, all nations shall
forsake Antichrist, and come, and worship before him, that is God almighty, by
the conversion of all Princes to the Gospel.

For proof whereof, his judgments are made manifest to all, that are not
wilfully blind, and all godly men do see, what in the end shall come to pass.

cap. 15.5. cap. 11.19.
After this zeal is found in the people of God, the temple of God, even the
temple of the tabernacle of the testimony, was opened in heaven. For as yet,
the Mat. 21.12. Act. 3.1.
temple called the porch, or utter court is for the most part trodden under
foot by the Gentiles. The tabernacle of the testimony being opened, cap.
11.19.
there was seen in the temple, the arc of the covenant of grace, the doctrine
of justification, being clearly taught; other points being yet in question
among many of the Saints.

And hereupon arise great emotions of lightening, and voices, and thunders, and
earthquakes, and much hail, by excommunications, and alterations, etc.

The complement.

Gospel was dead, as he was providing for his marriage, and for a strong

He sent unto Germany to extort the Annates, or first fruits, condemned in the
Council at Basil. Him Diatharius the Archbishop of Mogunce withstood, for the
exactions which he robbed the country by, under pretext of war against the
Turks. Wherefore the thundering Pope deprived him. The causes of his
deprivation were these. 1. He would not consent to the exaction of a tenth,
twentieth, thirtith. 2. He would not be sworn to the Pope, not to convent the
Princes Electors, for the affairs of the empire, without the Popes leave. 3.
He suffered not the Popes Legates at their pleasure to convent the Clergy. The
Pope excommunicated him, who writes to the Princes of Germany against the
Pope, to discharge Germany of these exactions, and to appeal to a Council.
Some of the Princes join with him, and write sharply to the Pope; requiring
the release of these exactions, (for she is fallen, because her merchants were
rich) and complaining of the grieuance offered to the Archbishop, (she is
fallen for making all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her
fornication.) Par. Vrs. p. 418
The Pope persecuteth the Archbishop also, for advancing the Empire, and
depressing the Papacy; and because to speak truth against the Pope, is
contrary to the oath of Bishops, Supra 3. Thunder. Crantz Met. 7.
required by Alexander the third. Hereupon Pencer. 5. f. 225. etc.
arise wars (or earthquakes.) But the Princes despised the ratles of the
Popes excommunications, and prevail in the war. The Pope excommunicateth and
accurseth the Archbishop and his accomplices, forbidding any to bring them
victuals, or arms. Again the Archbishop and his friends forbid the Papists
letters and processes, under pain of their heads. Reward as she has
rewarded you. Par. Vrsp. p. 419. etc.
Johannes de Wessalia lifts up his voice, preaches against the civil
authority of the Prelates, and teaches the scripture (which has a name that
none does know but it self.) must be interpreted by scripture. He was also
against indulgences, the gloss, etc. Buchol. anno 1460. Par. Vrsp. 407. etc.
The Pope also excommunicated Gregorius Heimberge doctor of the laws. Against
whom, this Gregorius did oppose a vehement writing; in which he equalleth the
rest of the Apostles to Peter; and proves the Pope to be subject to the
Councels, etc. Chro. Chro.
He also excommunicated Georgius Podiebrachius, and all Boem (but in vain.)
Par. Vrs. p. 411. 412. etc.
Fridericus the third Emperor was besieged, but relieved by Podiebrachius.
This Pope held many things, which he left in writing; as marriage was to be
restored to Priests with more reason than it was taken away. He said the
striuers were birds, the Court the field, the Judges were nets, the Proctors
be fowlers, etc. Fasc. Temp. f. 89. b.
At this time was a great reformation of Monasteries. And note, that often such
reformations are read of, but none continued; for in time they returned to
their old corruptions. Hunnius labor. Illiric. claui Scriptura.

Of this time Platina (speaking of the law which Ludouicus the Emperor made
to restrain the pride of the Clergy) cries out, I would O Ludouicus, thou
did live in our days. For now the Church does stand in need of thy most
holy censures. The Ecclesiastical order is given over to riot and luxury
(like a harlot) that thou might behold, not only men, but horses and
beasts, in their scarlet and princely robes (with which the harlot is arraied.)
When they go, there wait before them great troops of young men, and of the
Clergy. Not on asses, as Christ the author of our religion did ride, who was
the only example of well living in the world: but on great horses, in their
caparisons, as if they triumphed over some enemies lately overcome, etc. In

CHAP. XIII.
Of the seven last plagues, by which the wrath of God is fulfilled, upon the
inhabitants of the earth.

SO mightily has the power of God appeared, as that he has kept the temple
open, and continued the preaching of the Gospel; notwithstanding all
oppositions of enemies.

And now that his judgments might be made manifest according to the word of
God, he sends out his plagues, to the 2. These. 2.
consuming of the man of sin, in this third woe. In the prophecy of pouring
out of cap. 15.1.
the plagues, by which is fulfilled the wrath of God, first is declared how
they are prepared, and secondly how they are executed.

Concerning the preparation, it is said, that the persons who are provided to
execute them, are 6.
the seven Angels; the instruments of these punishments, being mighty, more
then humane. The place whence they came, is out of the temple, Psalm. 76.23.8.9.
whence the Lord does send his blessings, and plagues.

They are cap. 15.6.
clothed in pure and bright linen, in token of their cap. 19.8.
most righteous and holy proceedings. And lastly they have cap. 15.6.
their breasts girded with golden girdles; to signify their Luke 12.35. Exodus
^^.^^.
expedition with great honor.

And what they must do is committed unto them. For one of the cap. 15.7.
four beasts or Cherubines, which bears up the throne of God, gave unto the
seven Angels, seven golden Phials, or Censors, full Exodus 10.2.
of the hot burning coals, of the wrath of God, which lives for evermore, as
Alpha and Omega; to whom is no variablenes nor changing.

And by their ministry, the temple, the profession of the Gospel, is as
truly sanctified, as was the Exodus 40.34, 35.
tabernacle which Moses made; or the 1. King 8.10.11.
temple which Solomon built, when it was filled full of smoke of the glory of
God, and of his power; which there was in Sacrament and Type, but here is in
deed, and truth. And as there, Moses nor the Priests were able to enter into
the tabernacle of the congregation, because of the cloud; so here the luster
of the glory of God does keep men cap. 19.8. N. B.
that none can enter into the temple, till the seven plagues of the seven
Angels be fulfilled.

All things being thus prepared, now follows the effusion of those plagues.

In the prophecy whereof, first is set down the special vocation of these
Angels to the effusion, and then their pouring of them out.

Their vocation is from the Church; the godly which do sincerely profess the
Gospel newly restored; and because of the manifold and grievous persecutions
they cry for, and daily threaten vengeance upon all their Antichristian foes.

For therefore it is said, that that I John, and those of my spirit cap. 16.1.
heard a great voice, of such which suffered affliction, and understood the
word of God, crying out of the temple, where they worshipped God, and saying to
the seven Angel, which are the executioners of Gods wrath: Go your ways, and
power out the Phials of the wrath of God, upon such Antichristian enemies, as
labor to possess the earth; rather than heaven.

The particular plagues are seven; cap. 16.2.3.4 8.10.18.17.
First, Sores; secondly, death by sea: thirdly, death by land, or rivers:
fourthly, heat of the sun: fifthly, the obscuring of the throne and kingdom
of the beast: sixthly, invasion and slaughter by the kings of the east:
seventhly, the declaration of the truth, and proceeding accordingly by prayer,
destruction, etc.

The manner of the opposition of the beast, is, cap. 11.18. and cap. 16.9.10 21.
that the gentiles be angry, gnaw their tongues for sorrow, blasphemies, etc.
but cannot mend themselves.

The special plagues shall be showed in their proper places, when their
execution begins to be accomplished.

The first Phiall.
cap. 16.2.
The first Angel therefore, according to the commination which came out of the
Temple, went forth, and powered out his Phiall, upon the men that sought only
the possession of the earth. The effect whereof is, there fell a Deuteronomy. 28.35.
^aysome, and a grievous sore, upon the men which had the mark of the beast,
being as superstitious as any of the Gentiles, and upon them that worshipped
his image, the Pope, the very image of the heathen civil Monarchy. And here
is no mention of the number of his name, because these, upon whom the plague
first fell, were not soldiers to the use of the Papacy, but went to gain the
countries to their own subjection.

delighted with such. There fell upon him a vehement sickness, of sores, and
pains, which not somely afflicted his face and arms. After his sickness
recured, he 2, 89. etc. 94. 86.
marches to Rome with great pomp, upon his vow, to visit the temples at
Rome, and to worship the altars of Peter and Paul, for his health and
felicity, (and so he has the mark of the beast). As also, humbly to adore
the Pope which (being the image of the beast) held the highest dignity of
piety and religion, (falsely so called.) Wherefore when he came to the Vatican,
the king cast himself down, and worshipped the Pope, (the image of the
beast:) And then the whole multitude of nobles and Captains kissed the Popes
feet (as the Romans were wont to kiss the feet of Caligula) and his feet
were adorned with golden crosses (the mark of the beast.) Coming therefore to

The Pope only minds how to make his son Caesar, late Cardinal, the
greatest Prince in Italy. To this purpose, while Caesar tyrannised abroad, the
Pope by all possible means, even by the sale of all things, and leaving Rome
etc, a very slaughterhouse for his sons robbers, night and day; sought to
supply the wants of his son. In this Popes time were powered out also the
second, and third Phials.

The second Phiall.
Unto the plague of sores, is added the second plague of effusion of blood, by
sea, which is contained in the second Phial, when it is said, cap. 16.3.
And the second Angel powered out his Phiall, upon the sea, and it became as
the blood of a dead man, and every living thing died in the sea. That is, such
a curse of God fell upon the sea, that there were horrible slaughters made. For
partly the discouerers at sea, do bring a plague upon it, by committing many
bloody cruelties; and no blessing thither, how ever they pretend the blessing
of the spreading of the Gospel, which by their cruelty is detested. And
partly many battles are now fought at sea, while one Prince warreth upon
another, to the great loss of both sides, and death of all sorts.

The third Phiall.
Yet is not the hand of the Lord shortened, but is stretched out still. For the
Lord increases the two former plagues with a third; which is, much effusion of
blood at land, so that the rivers and fountains are dyed with the blood of the
slain. Wherefore it is said, cap. 16.4.
And the third Angel powered out his Phiall upon the rivers and fountains of
waters, and they became blood.

Hereupon are sung praises to the Lord, by the Angel, even him, whose
ministry was just and holy; by the water, to bring vengeance on the wicked,
which as it were, does say, cap. 16.5.
Lord, thou art just, which art, and which mast; and holy, because thou have
judged these things. cap. 16.6.
For this vengeance is powered upon them that shed the blood of the Saints, and
Prophets, by martyrdom, and therefore have thou given them blood to drink, by
casting them into the sea, and rivers, all steined with blood, for they are
worthy, to shed and drink one another blood that have delighted to drink
the blood of thy Martyrs.

Unto the praises of the Angel, the Saints agree, as Saint John says, cap.
16.7.
And I heard another, out of the Sanctuary, where the word is preached, say,
even so Lord God almighty, true and righteous are thy judgments.

For the French king, upon reconciliation between the Pope and him, received a
Iubile to be published through France. Yea the Pope abused too licentiously the
authority of the Apostolic sea, to draw money from men. For he dispersed
throughout the world, without distinction of places or times, most ample
indulgences with power to deliver souls out of purgatory. Which money was so
impudently demanded, that the Commissioners persuaded the people, that
whosoever would give ten shillings, should deliver the soul for which he gave
it out of purgatory. ( Hereby blaspheming God, who teaches us, 1. Pet. 1.18.
to know that we are not redeemed with corruptible things, as silver and gold.)
But if it were less than ten shillings, it would profit nothing. Yet were many
of the Popes Ministers detected, selling for a small price, or set upon a game
at tables in a tavern, the power to redeem men's souls out of purgatory. The
money Mass. ibid. 8. Geneb.
(though the shadow were to make war upon the Turk) was notoriously known
not to be paid to the Pope, or the Apostolic chamber; but was transferred
indirectly to satisfy the infinite covetousness of Magdalen the Popes sister, a

this occasion, Luther, (that followed the word of God) began to preach against
indulgences, and to reprehend the authority of the Pope. (And thus is

pardons; terrifying all men with the name of the Pope; threatening fire and the
reproach of heresy to them that refused to buie their pardons. He showed that
with his schedule of articles which he had set up, he only purposed to provoke
the learned to disputations. That it seemed miraculous to him, that his
propositions were so soon gone abroad, (as upon a white horse posted) in all

And the fifth Angel powered out his Phiall upon the throne of the beast, that
popish Antichrist, and the wonted glorious administration of his kingdom waxed
dark and obscured, being regarded every day less then other. Wherefore the
Gentiles, the Papists, are angry, and gnaw their tongues for sorrow and
grief. Yea whereas the Lord plagued them also by the other Phials, cap. 16.11.

Saxony to maintain the Church of Rome; and by his Legate he commanded the

against men already heard and condemned. Howbeit (because the Phiall was
powered on the throne of the beast, his kingdom and absolute commandment waxed

and propose an hundred grieuances, which Germany did suffer by the Sea of Rome,
and their Ecclesiastical persons, requiring to be eased in these things. The

We know that in this holy seat, now some certain years, there have been

When the Monks had read Luthers books of Vows, they dissolved their vows,
and went out of their Monasteries. So in many places the monasteries in a short
time were left empty and reduced to a wilderness, and cage of every unclean
bird, and other uses. The Nuns laid aside their latin Psalter, and put off
their habit, began to leave their cloisters, to marry, and keep house. Two
Monks were burned at Bruxels for Luthers opinions. Erasmus disliked this kind
of proceeding. Luther esteemed them as martyrs.

TO AS MANY AS CALL THEMSELVES CATHOLICS, AND FOLLOW THE Church of Rome, and
yet do desire to know and embrace the truth.
WE see and lament, that the multitude of those which do bear the name of
Christians is distracted into many different and contrary opinions; ye^ ^is
there none of the factions, which pretends not that he has the only right
way. Against this multiplicity, arises the word of God, which does constantly
affirm that Ephesians. 4 4.5.6.
there is but one God, one faith, etc. So that though 1. Cor. 9.24.
many run at the price, yet but one obtains it. The great Question is among
us all, which side has the true God, and true faith, and who shall get the
price. In this contention none are so fervent as they who call themselves
Catholics, and follow the Church of Rome: and they who are called Protestants,
and have departed from the Church of Rome. In so great opposition, it is
certain both parties are not right. Wherefore you that follow Rome, yet love
the truth, consider with me a little, how we may be satisfied, which of us is
out of the way, and think no scorn to turn into the right path when we have
found it. As for the rest, whom Antichrist has deluded to stop their ears,
like deaf Adders against good counsel, and to open their mouths to
blasphemy, so that they cry all is but lies, before they hear, or read a
letter: as God has provided no sacrifice for their wilful sin; so I leave
them to him that ^ Cor. 5.13.
judges them that are without.

It is confessed of us all, that our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, had the
truth, and that he sent his Apostles abroad to preach the same; which they did
in their sermon, and delivered in their writings. Now it remains to be
required, whether the Doctrine by them taught, and recorded in the scriptures
be the only, eternal, and immutable truth or no? Or that the Church may in
time devise more to be added thereto, other differing from it, or some
contrary unto it, of like authority and reverence? As for the Protestants they
bind themselves to the written Word, as a sufficient Canon to walk by,
acknowledging it to be Revel. 19.16.
the King of Kings, and Lord of Lords. The Church of Rome will not be so
straighted, nor so subject; but will assume she goes right, when she walks by
her Traditions, which change with the times; as appears by their several and
opposite decrees and institutions. So that she thinks her self never out,
whatsoever she does in abolishing the former, and in devising and inioyning
such new articles, as the godly in the primitive Church never knew, nor their
fathers before them; unto which also she holds all men are to be subject on
pain of damnation. For the decision of this great question: because it is
objected to the parties themselves that they do not pursue their arguments
with that patience as is required at the hands of Christians: let us commit the
moderation to such, as we all agree, were both truly Christians, (which was the
Act.
first name, that the Disciples were called by) and truly Catholics, which
was the next title they took; Namely Athanasius and his fellows: who though
they spoke in another case, yet it appears by the weight of their arguments,
they would speak of our Question, were they at our Conference, in the same
sort, as they did at Ari^^^^. Let us see to which of our parties their censure
were most proper, if the names of the persons which they speak of, were
changed into the persons of our Question. Their speech is recorded by Socrat.
lib. 2. cap. 29.

When Vrsacius and Valent had read a confession of the faith, dissenting from
the Nic^^^ Creed (as the Papists do from the faith and doctrine of the word
of God) published in the reign of Constantius, Flauius and Eusebius being
Consuls (as that of the Papists, is instituted by diverse Popes) the Catholics
that disliked it rose up and said (as we also say to the Papists:) We came not
together with you, because we were destitute of faith (for we keep that wholly
which we received from the beginning) but that if any did attempt any new
thing of that matter, we might resist him.

AThanasius (who especially disliked this innovation) wrote unto his friends
almost in these words, which, with changing but the names of the persons whom
he names, and are put in the margent, to the Papists, will be thus.

What I pray you was wanting in the Catholic Church unto the doctrine of
godliness, that now they should enquire of the faith and should by name prefix
the Consuls.
Popes and Councels (Which were in this present time) before the words which
(forsooth) they have set down of the faith? For the Vrsatius, Valens,
Germanius.
Popish writers have done that which was never done nor heard among christians.
For where they wrote the things, which they thought were to be believed, they
have written Consuls.
the Popes, Councels and places, month, and lastly the day, that it might be
manifest to all wise men, that their faith had no beginning, before the
beginning of the reign of Constantius.
such Popes and Councels; yea that which is more, all of them having regard
unto their own heresy, have committed their own sentences to writing.
Moreover when they pretend to write of the doctrine of the Lord, they have
named another for their Lord, namely Constantius.
the Pope: For he has opened unto them a window unto all their impiety. And
when as they did deny the word of the Son of God, to be eternal (for so
far were these enemies of Christ cast into wickedness) they have named the
Emperor.
decrees of the Popes to be eternal. But perchance they catch an occasion to
name the Consuls.
Popes and Councels, by the example of the holy Prophets, who do set down the
time in which they lived. But if they shall dare to affirm so, they shall
exceedingly bewray their folly. For albeit there be mention of the times in the
prophecies of holy men, as in Esaiah and Hosea, which were in the days of
Ozias and Ioatham, and Achaz and Ezechias: as in the prophecy of Jeremy, who
lived in the days of Iesias: as in the prophecies of Ezechiel and Daniel, who
flourished when Cyrus and Darius did reign, and lastly as in other Prophets
which prophesied in other times: yet do none of them lay any first foundation
of piety and holy religion. For it was before their times, and always, and
before the framing of the world which God by Christ has prepared for us. And
as for the times in which their faith began they did not design (for before
those times, themselves were faithful) but those were the times of the promise
pronounced by them. And the promise does especially concern the incarnation of
our Savior. That which was annexed thereunto did clearly demonstrate those
things which should befall the Jews and Gentiles. But in the times so noted
the doctrine of faith (as I said before) had not his beginning, but the
Prophets showed in what times they lived, when they prophesied these things.
But these our wise men, when they do not write things done, nor forshew things
to come, but do write our faith was set forth; presently they annexe the
Consuls.
Pope, Council, month and day. As godly men do set down the times of things
done, as also of their ministry; so those do note the time in which their
doctrine and faith began and was first instituted. And I would indeed they had
committed to writing their own only faith; but now they make the beginning of
the doctrine of faith; and as though it had not been before, they attempt to
dispute thereof. For they do not thus write. So we do believe, but in this
sort, The catholic faith was set forth. Therefore the audacious attempt of
this their institution, does manifestly convict their gross folly; and the new
instituted manner of their form so described, does every way equal the
heresy of the Arian. For so have they taught by their writings. Then began
they to believe so, and from thence they determine to show their faith. Not
otherwise then it is in Saint Luke the Evangelist: There came forth an edicte
of taxing. Luk 1.
This edict indeed was not before, but from those days it began, and was set
forth by them that did write it. So when these did write thus: Now is the faith
set forth, they do show that their error was now lately devised, and that
before it was not extant. But if they shall add the word Catholic (as the
Arians did, and Papists do) they rush unadvisedly into the wicked peruersenes
of the Cataphrygians, that according to their manner they also say, the
christian faith is revealed to us, and it began of us. And as those their
Maximilla and Montanus, so they, for Christ, do call Constantius.
the Pope Lord. Now if in their times, and these Consuls.
Popes the faith had his beginning, what shall become of the Fathers and
blessed Martyrs, what of these whom themselves have instructed and were dead
before these Consuls.
Popes? By what means will they raise them from the dead, that they may
altogether root out of their minds the things which they taught them, and
engraffe into them the things which now they have devised and written? So
absurd and senseles they be, that they have only skill to forge counterfeit
matters, which as they are foolish and improper; so may they be reproved and
refuted very easily. Thus much Athanasius would say to them as he said to the
Arians.

To the indifferent Reader.
THou see (gentle Reader) that by the weight of Athanasius Arguments, the
Papists are excluded from the number of true Christians and Catholics, as well
as the Arians, so far forth as they obtrude any doctrine which was not from
the beginning, but has been devised at several times. Of this sort are the
points in which we differ from them. It remains therefore that thou conclude,
that either Athanasius and his fellows, or the Pope with his followers are to
be avoided. The Lord bless thy hunger and thirst after righteousness.
