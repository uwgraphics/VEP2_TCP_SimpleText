Great thanks to the welcome, in Churchyards behalf:
To him that has bleared, and cried like a Calfe.
Full well by his crying a man may now know,
Where veale may be bought of a price very low:
The head and the purtnaunce, with gather though small,
As cheap as a Shepes head, the horns bought withal.

Restless heads, I well perceive,
to be acquainted sure:
Can rashly feed on matters gross
as meat for them vnpure.
So well I do perceive by one,
who has of late take pain:
By penned verce on high Churchyard
to welcome home again.
In tauntyng wise (alas thou fool)
what needed thus thy head
To travail in such flickeryng vearce,
since all thy wits be fled?
Do thou know thou chattring Pie
on whom thou do thus rail?
Or have thou cause by gawled back,
to wag and wince thy tail?
As no revenge, this men accoumpt,
to wreake thy angry mood?
To charge him with a vowed oath,
for wearyng of a hoode.
Thy nature ill, does well declare,
thy rancour and thy spite:
To heads that bare and naked are,
yet needs not lantern light.
*But can thou spare a hood in deed?
of hoods have thou such store?
How can thy horns for hoods be seen?
hushed hushed, I say no more.
Let Churchyard live and reign in place
to his contented mind,
And so let every horned beast
go raunge, like to his kind.
For cloughie Clem, and William to
need not to take more pain,
Since Adam Bell, for Clem of ye clough
the monstrous Sheep has slain.
And outlawes are (as I hear say)
for this, so heinous deed:
So farewell. C. with horned cap,
good night, and eke good speed.
Thus do I cease with hoods Robin,
now Robin Hood farewell:
And Robinson in Churchyards stead,
shall wear the hood and bell.
And if this rude and simple verce
may not a warnyng be,
To stay your cockyug crakyng head
take heed lest that you see:
The coksco^be knocked about your pate,
then hoods no more will seem
Your horns to hyde, but al men shall
a monster thee esteem.
And as for Churchyards cu^ming hom
was not of his free will,
But for to please such stats whose hests
may both command and will.
Thus bid I thee farewell a while,
as one that keeps his pen:
To answer such as shall presume,
to blea like Calves in den.
(quod) Ra. Sm.
