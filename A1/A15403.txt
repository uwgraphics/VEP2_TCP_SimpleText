NAtale suum solum (illustrissimi viri) omnes amant, vbi illis nascendi datum
sit initium: plerique locum ipsum venerantur, vbi institutionis primordia

sustentamur. Qua singulos mouent singula, eadem me urgent Vniuersa, and quibus
alij officij vinculis seorsim obligantur, ego simul omnibus obstrictus teneor.
Quomodo ergo Eliens. Ecclesia mihi non esset charissima, vbi primo lucent hanc
aspicere, and vitalem spiritum ducere coeperim, piae etiam educationis accessit

concionibus illi Ecclesiae deero, vt pro terreno substato and temporali,
spirituale pabulum rependam.

Nunc igitur patriae meae illustraturus encomium, vnde exordiar, nescio: Number ab

Concionatores vero quamplurimos. Nec minima pars laudis ex Rectoribus suis illi

Anglorum gentem, contra impetum Normannorum Insulam aliquandiu defendissent,
haec veluti mulcta imposita est, vt tot milites suo hospitio excip^rent, quos
liberaliter and humaniter admodum tractarunt: Ego vero istos, qui Deo and
Ecclesiae militant illis, nequaquam inferiores duco, qui in castris excubant,
and pro patria pugnant. Sed quid ego hic Monachos commemoro, malas illas
bestias, and ventres pigros, quod de Cretensib, suis primo Poeta cecinit, and

THE SECOND BOOK OF SAMVEL.
General Questions touching the whole Book.
1. Quest. Of the inscription of this Book.
1.WHy the first book of Samuel is so named, there may be evident reasons
given; as both because the book begins with the story of Samuels
nativity, as the Hebrews use to name the books of Scripture of the
beginning; as also because it contains Samuels acts principally; and besides,
Samuel is held to have been the writer thereof, till that place where mention
is made of his death. 2. But of this second book there is greater question,
why it should bear the name of Samuel: for neither are Samuels acts therein
described, neither was he the penne-man thereof: but it was written by some of
the Prophets, as by Nathan, and Gad, who supplied the rest of the history,
that follows Samuels death, or by some other of the Prophets: some think
they were collected by Hezekiah; some by Ezra. 3. Now why yet this book is
entitled by Samuel, two reasons may be yielded, both because it shows the
accomplishment of Samuels prophecy concerning the kingdom of David, and the
consummation and perfection of that argument, which began with Samuels
anointing: Genevens. as also for that this book is but a continuation of the
former history: and therefore the Hebrews do not divide it from the former.
Pellic. 4. But whereas Hierome thinks in his Hebrewe traditions, that this
book of Samuel is like to be that, which is called the book of the righteous,
it has no probability: Mar. for we find mention made of that book, before
this history was either done, or written: Ios. 10.13.

2. Quest. Of the Argument of this Book.
1. As the former book contains the history of such things as were done
under Samuel and Saul, so this sets forth the acts of David: and specially
three things in general are handled in this book: the beginning, increase,
and flourishing of David's reign: then the manifold troubles, treasons, and
oppositions against his kingdom: as also David's fall, and his rising again,
and reconciling unto God. 2. And further, herein is observed a notable
difference between the reign of Saul and of David: for Saul's kingdom began
with great glory and renown, but ended with shame: but contrariwise, David's
kingdom had but small beginnings, yet increased more and more. Borr. 3. In
which respect David was a lively type of Christ, who found many enemies in the
world, which sought to suppress his kingdom in the infancy thereof: But his
dominion prevailed, and from a corner of the earth, has ouerspread all the
world. Mar.

3. Quest. Of the profit and utility of this book.
1. This book in general affoardeth that profit, which all the Scriptures do
yield, which are profitable either for doctrine, to confirm the truth, and
improoue error; or for manners, to correct vice, and to instruct in
righteousn^s: as S. Paul shows, 2. Timoth. 3.16. 2. In this book, as also in
the former, are set forth unto us many grave and worthy examples of virtuous
acts, which do move much, and persuade unto virtue, and do longer remain in
memory then bare precepts. 3. These histories serve to expound the writings
and oracles of the Prophets, but especially the book of the Psalms, showing
the occasions whereupon many of those Psalms were indi^ed, which makes much
to the true understanding of them. 4. Further, whereas these books are
alleged in the Gospel: the knowledge hereof is profitable to understand the
precepts and sermons of our blessed Savior. 5. And lastly, the wisdom of God
does wonderfully appear herein, in tempering the Scriptures to every ones
capacity: for them which are severe and austere, and are addicted to grave
things and matters of rigor and authority, the five books of Moses were
digested: some men are delighted with a pleasant style, and flowing speech,
such the Psalms and Canticles specially are for: others do more respect grave
and wise sentences, such as the Proverbs of Solomon, and the book of
Ecclesiastes contain: Some are delighted in antiquaries, to them the holy
histories are specially applied: Others love to hear of Gods judgments and
threatenings against sin, who are to be sent to the Prophets. Mart.

Quest. 4. How many years the history of these two books of Samuel contain.
1. The former book contains not so many years, as Josephus computation
accounts: for he gives 38. years unto Saul's reign, whereof he reigned 18.
years while Samuel yet lived, and 20. after: for add unto this 40. years of
Eli, for so long he judged Israel, 1. Sam. 4.18. and 20. years at the least,
for Samuel before Saul was anointed, as is gathered, 1. Sam. 7.2. see the
question upon that place: so should the whole sum of years make an 100.
within two: which cannot stand with that account, 1. King. 6.1. which sets
down 480. years to be run in the 4. year of Solomon from the departure of
the Israelites out of Egypt, until the building of the Temple. This number
consists of these particulars: 40. years under Moses, 17. under Ioshuah,
299. under the Judges, 44. under David and Solomon: all which make but 400.
years: there remains then but 80. years, whereof 40. were under Eli, 1.
Sam. 4.18. then there are but 40. more to be divided between Samuel and Saul,
Act. 13.21. the first book then contains the history of 80. years, and no
more.

2. Then the computation which Pet. Martyr follows, can not be true: that
reckons 366. years from the departure of Israel out of Egypt until Eli,
which can not be: from the beginning of Elies 40. year to the 4. year of
Solomon, are years 124: whereof 40. were under Eli, 40. under Samuel and Saul,
and 40. under David, and 4. of Salomons reign: which sum of 124. being put
to the former sum of 366. will make in all 490. years: whereas the Scripture
accounts but 480. 1. King. 6.1.

3. The History then of this book, is only of 40. years under the reign of
David, and certain months: whereof he reigned 7. years, 6. months in
Hebron, and 33. years in Jerusalem, 2. Sam. 5.5. Iun.

CHAP. 1.
Quest. 1. verse. 8. Whether the Amalekite lied in telling unto David, that he
slew Saul.
1. THe Hebrews do think, that this Amalekite lied unto David, and that all
this cunning tale was but devised, to insinuate himself unto David: but it
seems that all was not fained, as that he took the crown from Saul's head,
before he was dead, being fallen to the ground: for he had the crown there
present to show.

2. Some do think that he spoke the truth: and that when Saul had fallen upon
his sword, this Amalekite also at Saul's motion, fell upon him: so Josephus,
Genevens. Bor. and the Chalde interpreter seems to be of the same opinion,
reading v. 15. The sin of thy slaughter be upon thine own head: but this is
not like to be so: for these reasons: 1. Saul fell upon his sword, 1. Sam.
31.5. but here he is said to lean upon his spear, that is, thrust himself in
with the spear. 2. Saul's armor-bearer saw Saul dead first, before he killed
himself, 1. Sam. 31.6. but here the Amalekite tells, that life was in him,
when he stood over him to make an end of him. 3. It is not like, that Saul
having run upon his sword, had memory to ask him so many questions: first
to call him to him, then to enquire who he was, and thirdly to make his request
to him. 4. This young man expected a reward at David's hand, c. 4.10. and
therefore it is probable that he lied: for a flatterer, and a lier, for the
most part, go together.

3. Some of the Hebrews think, that this young man was Doegs son, whom they
suppose to be Saul's armor bearer, and that he before he killed himself, gave
Saul's crown, and bracelet to his son: But this young man was an Amalekite,
Doeg was an Edomite, therefore this supposall has no ground.

4. Therefore the more probable opinion is, that this Amalekite lied unto David
in the most part of his tale: yet herein he may be thought to speak as it fell
out; that he was the first, that came upon Saul being wounded to death, and
seeing no hope of life in him, rifled him, and took away his crown and
bracelet. Osiand. It will be objected, that if he had not killed Saul, David's
sentence had been unjust to put him to death. Ans. the confession of his own
mouth was sufficient to condemn him, especially seeing he bewraied a willing
and resolved mind to lay his hands upon the Lords anointed, whether he did it
or no.

2. Quest. verse. 9. Of these words, Anguish is come upon me.
1. The word here used Shabatz, signifies a garment made with eyes or hoales
like net-worke, it also is taken for grief or anguish: Diverse readings.
there are then three interpretations of this place. 1. Some understand it of
the horsemen, which were armed with such coats, that now had overtaken Saul:
as Vatab. reads cornua, the band or troop has overtaken me: but the words
following show, that Saul speaks of himself, of somewhat that had befallen
him: because he says, my life is yet whole in me. 2. Some refer it to Saul's
garment, that hindered the entering of his spear: Iun. but the next verse
shows, that Saul having run upon his spear or sword, was fallen to the
ground, and not like to live, by the Amalekites own confession; therefore the
weapon had entered to the purpose: and again, the word achaz, signifies
properly to hold, possess, or apprehend, rather then to let or hinder. 3.
Therefore the usual reading is to be preferred, Anguish has caught hold of
me, apprehended, or possessed me: sic C.S.L.A.P. cum caeter. the anguish of the
wound and hole, which the spear had made.

3. Quest. v. 10. Of these words: Because I was sure he could not live.
1. Some make this a reason of the words following; because he was sure he
could not live after he was fallen, he took the crown, etc. B.G. that is,
Diverse readings.
when the Amalekite had given him his deadly wound, and saw he could not live,
then he rifled him: but the Hebrew distinction, athnach, at that word after his
fall, which is a perfect period, breaks off this clause from the words
following. 2. Therefore the meaning is, that when he saw Saul to be fallen
upon his sword, and not like to live, that the Amalekite was persuaded to make
an hand of him, Vatab. and so the rest also do join it as a reason of the
former words, I came upon him, and slew him. Iun. C.S.L. etc.

3. Quest. verse. 12. Why David mourned for Saul and Jonathan.
1. David and his whole band wept and mourned together at the first, hearing of
the lamentable end of Saul and his sons, v. 12. but afterward David by
himself mourned more, when he vtt^red that song of lamentation. 2. David
mourned for Jonathan, as for his friend, and a good man; and for Saul, because
though he were an enemy to David, yet he was a valiant defender of the
Israelites against their enemies, and whom David had twice spared himself, and
would not lay his hands upon him, he mourns to see how he came to this
miserable end. 3. Many benefits came unto David by the death of Saul, as the
end of that cruel hatred and persecution, and the accomplishment of Gods
promise toward David; but David in this his lamentation, looks unto the
original of this calamity, the wrath of God, which was the cause of his
mourning. 4. David gave God thanks, that had judged his rebuke against Nabal,
but here he rejoices not for Saul's overthrow; for the case was not alike,
neither did God sustain any dishonor, nor the commonwealth any loss by the
death of Nabal, as both are hindered by the lamentable fall of Saul. Mar.

4. Quest. verse. 15. Whether David did justly in commanding the Amalekite to be
put to death.
1. If this young man spoke the truth, and made a true relation, he was
worthily slain; both in respect of Saul, who was the Lords anointed, and
therefore he should not have laid any hand upon him: in respect of himself, he
was a Proselite converted to the faith of Israel: and David's person also
considered, who was now the lawful Magistrate. 2. But if this were a devised
tale, which he tells, his condemnation also was just, for he was judged by
his own mouth: and hereunto agree the imperial laws: ff. ad leg. Cornel. de
falfis.
falsum testimonium puniendum est poena talionis: a false testimony must be
punished with the penalty of retalion, or equality. 3. And whereas it will be
objected, that one ought not to die, but by the testimony of two or three:
that is to be understood where there is no confession, Reconcil.
but the fact is denied: but the voluntary confession of the party may
suffice, without further witness: as Iosuah caused Achan to be stoned upon his
own confession. 4. And further it must be considered, whether the confession
be voluntary, or forced and extorted by torment: for in this case the
imperial laws provide, ff. de quaest. leg. 1.. Div. Sever.
confessionem reorum non habendam esse pro explorato crimine, nisi approbatio
alia instruat religionem cognoscentis: that the confession of the guilty
should not be held for a sufficient evidence of the crime, unless some other
proof do inform the conscience of the examiner. But this confession of the
Amalekite was voluntary.

5. Quest. verse. 17. How and when David bad to teach the children of Israel to
shoot, etc.
1. Some think that this verse has no reference to David's song that
follows, but do interpret it thus, that David before he sung this song had
exhorted and encouraged his tribe, to learn to shoot in the bow: Vatab. Borr.
2. Some by the bow, understand this mournful ditie, because it makes mention
of the bow of Jonathan, v. 22. so the Latin interpreter: vt docere^t filios
Iudae planctum, to teach the children of Israel to mourn. 3. But the third
interpretation is the best, that these words are not properly any part of the
song, but show the end, why David uttered it: to the intent, that this song
being used and frequented in the tribe of Judah, it should serve as an
incitement and provocation to the tribe of Judah to learn to be skillful in
shooting: Iun. seeing that Saul and Jonathan were now overcome by the archers
and shooters among the Philistims. Borr. 4. By this example of David, who in
the mids of his mourning forgets not, what was necessary for the good of
the Commonwealth: we are taught, not to be so overcome with grief and
pensiuenes, as to forget our duty, and to neglect the means: Mart. as Iaakob
says to his sons, when they were ready to be famished, and looked not about
to help themselves: Why gaze ye one upon an other? Moral observe.
Genesis 42.1. And when Moses cried unto God, when the Egyptians pursued them, not
knowing which way to turn himself: the Lord says unto him, Why criest thou?
speak to the children of Israel that they go forward, Exodus 14.15. 5.
Further, in that David taught them the use of the bow, it is evident, that
there is a lawful use of armor and weapons, and the servants of God may
defend themselves thereby, against their enemies contrary to the fantastical
opinion of the Anab^^^^^ts, Confut. Against the Anabaptists of the lawful use
of weapons.
who deny unto the Christians all use of weapons. Mart.

6. Quest. verse. 17. Of the book of Iasher.
1. Concerning the name of this book, Iasher signifies, the just or
righteous: so called as some think of the persons whereof that book
entreated, namely of the acts of the Patriarchs and just men. Some of the
matter, because it contained a true narration of such things as were written
therein. But it is more like to bear the name of Ieshurun, which is the name
of Israel, Deuteronomy. 32.15. and the Prophet Isai calls Israel by the same name,
c. 44. v. 2. which word also signifies, the righteous people: this book was
called Iasher, because it was as a public chronicle and record of Israel: Mus.
in Iosu. 10. 2. But what book this was, it is further questioned: the Chalde
understands the book of the law, which was called Iashar, right, just,
because it prescribed what things were just. Others take it for the book of
Genesis, which contains an history of the acts of the righteous fathers.
Vatab. But how could David's song be recorded in that book made so long before?
Others think it was some book made by Nathan or Gad, wherein this song was
written: but there was a book called Iashur long before their time, Josh.
10.13. Therefore it is more probable, that this book of Iasher, was a general
Chronicle of the acts of that nation, which was continued from time to time by
the Prophets, which is now wanting, as many such historical books are. Iun.
These Chronicles were laid up in the Temple, as Josephus writes, lib. 5. c. 1.
Many such historical writings are mentioned in books of the Kings and
Chronicles composed by the Prophets, Nathan, Gad, Iddo, Semaias, Achias the
Silonite, which are now not to be found. It seems that after Ezra had
digested the holy Scriptures into order, that these books were not thought so
necessary: the Lord has yet preserved for the use and benefit of his Church,
so much as he sees to be sufficient for the instruction of the people in the
knowledge of his will, and toward the attaining of everlasting life. Andr. Mus.
3. But this is no argument to prove any imperfection or defect in the
Scriptures, as though they contained not all things necessary to salvation:
because some books of the Canonical Scripture are now wanting, as the
Romanists usually object. Bellar. de verb. dei. c. 4.

Contr. Of the sufficiency of the Scriptures. Lib. 36. de civ. dei. c. 38.




Answ. ^. Augustine gives this reason, why some of those books are now lost:
because they did write some things, tanquam homines historica diligentia, as
men by an historical diligence: other things, tanquam Prophetae inspiratione
diuina: as Prophets by divine inspiration: he seeme^h to think that those
books, which are not now extant, were no part of the canonical Scripture: but
this exception may be made to this answer, that many of our Saviors sermons
and sayings, are also now wanting, Ioh. 20.30. which all if they were now
extant, should as well be canonical, as those which are written. 2. We say
then, that though it be granted, that those books were prophetical, and
consequently canonical; yet that part of the Scriptures notwithstanding is
sufficient which remains: for most of those books belonged unto matter of
history, rather then of doctrine, and therefore the Lord thought them not to
be so necessary* neither in them was contained any other form of religion or
rule of doctrine, then is exp^essed in the Scriptures; which now we have:
notwithstanding then the want of these booke^, the Scriptures are sufficient ^o
make the man of God perfect to all good works, 2. Tim. 3.16.

7. Quest. verse. 19. Of David's Epitaph or fun^rall song.
1. It has been an ancient custom both among the heathen, and the people of
God, to use funeral orations in commendation of the dead: Ieremias writ his
lamentations over Jerusalem (...) the destruction thereof, and for the untimely
death of Josias: Hierome seems to have been much exercised in writing of
Epitaphs. This use was taken up among the Greeks to set forth the praises not
only of men, but of women departed: as the funeral oration of Aspasi^ in
Plato. Suetonius writes, In Platon. Menexen.
that Julius Caesar did celebrate the public commendations of his Grandmother
Iulia. Martyr.

2. (...) to use funeral orations, commendations, and memorialls of the dead,
is not unlawful, so that these rules be therein observed. 1. That it be done
without adulation or flattery, that such be not commended and extolled for
their virtues, which were most vile and vicious men. 2. That no partiality be
showed, in commending one before an other, in setting forth the praise of a
rich man, or of a kinsman, and not of a poor man, or one not allied, they
being all of like desert; which is the greatest exception that can be taken to
funeral sermons, in mine opinion: when as a man that has ten shillings
bequeathed him for a funeral sermon, will commend such an one, and an other of
as good example of life, wants that solemnity. 3. It must be done without
superstition; they must not imagine, that the dead receive any solace, benefit,
or relief, by such funeral solemnities: but such commendations, and setting
forth of the praise of the dead, must altogether redound, and be referred to
the praise of God, and to the use, exhortation, and comfort of the living. 4.
It is then a fond collection of Bellarmine, Lib. 1. de purgat. cap. 3.
that this was done ad invandas animas defunctorum, to relieve the souls of
the dead: for, 1. Saul died in despair, and so in the state of final
impenitencie: and such in their own doctrine are not to be prayed for. 2. The
end of this song is expressed: it was to be sung, to teach them to shoot, to
stir them up to learn feats of war, verse. 17. it was then for the benefit
of the living, not for the dead.

3. David took it to belong unto him to make this lamentable epitaph upon Saul
and Jonathan; both in respect of his alliance, being Saul's son in law, and
Jonathan his dear friend; as also because he was the successor in the
kingdom: and besides, David was the chief and captain of this company, to
whom this news was brought: and he being endued with a prophetical spirit,
was exercised in making such heavenly songs. Mar.

8. Quest. v. 20. How David says, Tell it not in Gath, seeing it was there
known already.
1. Here the Imparatiue mood is taken for the Optatiue* after the patheticall
manner of those which mourn, and express their grief. Bor. 2. There is a
difference between the will and desire of man, and his deliberation and
election, between wishing and choosing: for a man may many times in his
v^hement affection wish for such things, which cannot be: but his election is
only set upon those things which are possible, and likely to be obtained: so
that David rather detesteth this which was already done, then forbids it to
be done. Mar.

9. Quest. verse. 21. Of the true reading thereof.
1. In the first part of the verse, the usual reading is, or fields of
offerings, that is, from henceforth bear ye no f^ui^, whereof they should
bring oblation^ to the Lord; the word t^rumah signifies eleuations, because
they used to lift or heane-vp their offerings before the Lord: the Sept. read
agri, (...), the field^ of first fruits: but Iun. only refers it unto the
hills; o agri editi, O ye high fields* but the first interpretation better
agrees with the former words, upon you be neither d^^e nor rain* and the
conjunction copulative in the latter reading is omitted, vshedee, and fields.
2. In the latter part of the verse, the common reading is, the shield of Saul
was ^^st down, as though he had not been anointed with oil: V.P.B.G.S.L.
Iunius interprets thus, by the consumption or destruction of him, that was
anointed with oil: the word is beli, which both signifies not, and a
consumption: but the first reading is f^tte^, according unto the most usual
signification of the word. 3. Some refer the anointing to the shield of Saul,
because they used to anoint their sheilds before battle: Vatab. S^pt. but wi^h
better sense is it applied to Saul, that he was overthrown, as any ^ther
common soldier, as though he had not been the Lords anointed. Mar. Os^an^^*

10. Quest. verse. 21. Whether David's curse vp^n the mountains of Gilbo^ took
effect: Upon you be no dew.
1. Some think that this is only a figur^tiue speech, whereby the Prophet
David by a kind of Prosopopeia, that is, a faigning of ^ person to exp^esse his
grief, imagines as though the very heavens and earth had a kind of sense and
feeling of this calamity, the one withholding the dew and rain, the other
the fruits and increase thereof. Borr. 2. Some other think that David, to show
the detestation of the very place, where this slaughter was committed, does
thus speak by way of wishing, that the mountains of Gilboa, might be stricken
with b^rrennesse. Pellic. 3. Iunius thinks that it is an hyperbolicall
imprecation in cursing the place, as Job does the time of his nativity, Job.
3. 4. Osiander says it is a figurative speech. 5. But I rather think that
this is a prophetical curse, and took effect accordingly, and say with Pet.
Mart. omnino voluit aeternum extare monumentum tanti mali: he would have an
eternal monument be extant of so great calamity: even as our Savior cursed
the fig tree in the Gospel: for it is not to be thought, that this speech of
the Prophet was in vain.

Quest. 11. Of the order and parts of David's mournful song.
It consists of two parts. 1. The proposition, containing the sum of the
whole song, and the cause of David's mourning, which is the overthrow of Saul
with his sons, v. 19. which being as the foot or ground of this mournful
dirtie, is again repeated, v. 25. and it concludes the sonet, v. 26. 2. The
second part is the amplification of this calamity, which is two ways set
forth: first by a patheticall imprecation, consisting of a double vow or
request: that the news might go no further, if it be possible, v. 20. and
laying a curse upon the very place, v. 21. secondly, by an evident declaration
of the greatness of this loss: which is described, 1. by the excellency of
their persons, expressed by their acts and virtues, v. 22. their mutual
affection one to the other, and their valor compared in swiftness to Eagles,
in strength to Lions. 2. by the effects, they enriched and adorned their
subjects, 24. 3. by showing Ionathans ardent love toward himself, he also
bewailed his own private loss: verse. 26. Iun.

Quest. 12. verse. 23. Upon these words: In their death they were not divided or
separated.
1. Hereby David purges Jonathan, who was suspected, as though he had
conspired with David against Saul: David ^leareth him of this suspicion, seeing
Jonathan showed himself so loving and fait^full to Sa^l, that as he lived, so
he died with him: Mart. 2. Though Saul sometime conceived displeasure against
Jonathan, yet that showed his love rather toward him, because he was jealous of
David for Ionathans sake, fearing least he should deprive his son of the
succession of the kingdom. Pellic. 3. Further, David makes m^ntion of this
uniting and conjunction of Saul and Jonathan in their death, to set forth the
greatness of this calamity, whereby two such valiant men were together
overthrown, whereas the fall of one excellent man alone is grievous, and much
to be lamented, Mart. 4. Herein we have an example of perfect and true
freindship, which is not broken off by death: adversity, trouble, and peril
of death, is a true touchstone of freindship: Jonathan was so faithful in his
love toward his father, that he would not leave him in death. Borr.

Quest. 13. verse. 26. Of the great love between Jonathan and David.
1. Some do understand these words, thy love to me was wonderful, passing
the love ^f woman, of David's love toward Jonathan, that David loved him bee^e^,
then he did his own wives: so the Chald. Vatab. Pellic. Osiand. 2. But it is
better understood of Ionathans ardent affection toward David, which surpassed
the love of women: Iun. Mart. and this to be the sense, the former words do
show, My brother Jonathan, very kind have, thou been unto me: he sp^^keth
of the kindness of Jonathan toward him, comparing his own love, to the love
of a brother, but the lou^ of Jonathan to the love of women: Iuniu^. for here
in the eminency of Ionathans love appeared, that he first began, to love
David: c. 18.^. The soul of Jonathan was knit to the soul of David: then he
continued his do or both with his lab^^rs great displeasure, and to the
hinderance of his succession in the kingdom, ^ The love of women some do
understand passiu^ly, nor that love which men be^re toward them, Osiand.
Pellic. but it is rather taken acti^ely, for that love which ^omen do show
toward their husband^, Vatab. or toward their children, as the Latin
translator he^e interpr^t^th. 4. Here we may see, that although we must love
every man, as our brother, yet it stands with religion to show more ardent
affection toward some, then toward others: as our blessed Savior loved John
more then the rest of the Apostles. Osiand.

Quest. 14. verse. 26. Of David's commendation of Saul.
1. Where David says, how are the weapons of war destroyed, thereby
understanding Saul and Jonathan, who were warlike and valiant men: he
commends not Saul for his piety, or any spiritual grace, whereof he was
destitute, but for his valor and fortitude: for these being the gifts of God,
and so good in themselves, may be commended even in the wicked: Mart. 2. In
that David passes over Saul's faults in silence, and only touches his
virtues, it teaches us to hate the errors and infimities of others, so far
as with a good conscience we may: Osiand. 3. This was an honorable and worthy
commendation of Saul, both being from the mouth of so excellent a man as David
was, and beside, one unto whom Saul had always been a professed enemy. And
the testimony and commendation of an enemy is much to be regarded. Caesar,
when he saw Pompey his enemies head, is said to have wept: and Hannibal in that
great slaughter of the Romans at Cannas, sought diligently for the body of
Paulus Aemileus the Roman Captain there slain, to have given it honorable
burial. But David's affection toward his enemy far exceeds them, who
gives such an honorable testimony and commendation of him: Mar. Borr. 4.
Neither was this a poetical and fained lamentation for Saul: for the people of
Israel verily and in deed, had received a great blow by Saul's death: but that
by Gods mercy, this loss was restored in David: Osiand. 5. It were much to be
wished, that all wanton and lascivious songs were laid down in these days:
and that youth would exercise themselves in such sonnets as this of David,
which do set forth the worthy acts and exploits of such as have defended
their country, and protected the Church of God. Pellic.

CHAP. 2.
1. Quest. verse. 1. How and to what end David asks counsel of God.
1. Josephus thinks, that David enquired of God by some Prophet: as Gad and
Nathan were with him. But it is like rather, that he consulted by the priest,
namly Abiathar, who had the Ephod and followed David: 1. Sam. 23.9. where David
might use the ordinary means, he would not run unto extraordinary: Mar.
Borr. Pellic. 2. David, though he had a promise of the kingdom, yet would not
take possion thereof, though Saul were dead, without direction from God: as
Iaacob did not make an escape from Laban, before he was admonished by the Lord
in a dream: which teaches us, not to enterprise, or take any thing in hand,
without the warrant of Gods word, and prayer. Mar. 3. Here appears the unlike
and far different course, which Saul and David followed: for he resorted unto
Witches, but David took his direction from God. Borr.

2. Quest. verse. 1. Why David is directed to go unto Hebron.
1. This City was famous in diverse respects: both for the antiquity, it was
built seven years before Zoan in Egypt, Numb. 13. thither also came Joshua
and Caleb, when they were sent as spies to search the land: it was one of the
Cities of refuge, which belonged unto the Levites: but it was most of all
honored, because the famous Patriarks Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, were there
buried, to whom the promises concerning the land of Can^an were made, and to
Jacob especially concerning the kingdom to be established in Judah: it wa^
therefore very fit, that in that place David should be initiated king: Mar. 2.
Though Ziklag also belonged unto Judah, yet David thought that to be an unfit
place, both because it was in the utmost borders of Judah, and he held it now
by the gift and grant of the King of the Philistims: therefore he desires to
remove to some other City of Judah, more inward in the country, Pellic. 3.
He takes with him his two wives, that as they had been his companions in his
troubles, so they should partake with him in his happy estate: Bor. herein
David also was a type of Christ, who makes them partakers of his glory with
him, which did follow him in his afflictions: as he says to his Apostles, Ye
are they, which have continued with me in my tentations, therefore I appoint
unto you a kingdom, as my Father has appointed unto me, Luke 22.28.29.

3. Q^est. verse. 4. Why David is again anointed King.
1. This was done both for David's further confirmation, that by this second
anointing he might be strengthened, in the undoubted expectation of the
kingdom: for such is our weakness, that it needs to be continually
supported. Osiand. 2. This also was an other reason thereof, that as by the
first anointing by Samuel, Gods electing of David was made manifest, so by
this second anointing by the men of Judah, their consent and approbation might
be had. Borr. 3. Herein also David was a type of Christ, whose spiritual
anointing to be our Messiah, was often testified, and declared unto the Church
for our further confirmation: as by the predictions of the old Prophets, by the
pointing out of John, by Gods own voice from heaven, by diverse signs and
miracles. Mar.

4. Quest. verse. 4. Whether the men of Judah were authors of Schism in
dividing themselves from Israel.
1. Though they are said to be the men of Judah, yet there joined with them
diverse out of the other tribes of Israel, which understood that it was the
will of God that David should be King: as appears, 1. Chron. 12. to v. 22.
yet are they called the men of Judah, because the most and the chief were of
that tribe: Mar. 2. Though the tribe of Judah apart from other tribes anointed
David King, yet they therein, as dissenting from all Israel beside, did not
make any rent, or schism: for they were warranted herein, Controv. Gen^rall
Cou^cills in matters of religion, not always to be stayed for.
both in general by the promise of God made concerning the preeminence of that
tribe, and in particular by the manifest declaration of Gods will, touching the
election of David to be king. 3. By this the Church of God learneth, that, when
they have a manifest warrant out of Gods word, and so are certain of Gods
will, they are not to stay, or expect the calling together of synods or
counsels, but incontinently to reform religion, and embrace the truth. Mar.

5. Quest. verse. 5. Of David's kind message to the men of Iabesh Gilead.
1. Some think, that this fact of the men of Iabesh Gilead was discommended
unto David, as being too much addicted unto his professed enemy: Mar. but it
seems rather that David made inquiry after the bodies of Saul, and his
sons, to have bestowed upon them honorable burial, and by that occasion he
understood of this thankful service, which the men of Iabesh Gilead had done:
Iun. 2. David in commending this dutiful regard in them of Saul, shows
himself far unlike to the examples of those heathen Captains and commanders
Sylla, Marius, Antonius, Octavius, who sought revenge upon those, who had taken
part against them. Mar. 3. David wishes that God would show again mercy and
truth unto them: Gods mercy and goodness is seen in promising reward unto our
faithful service, and his truth and fidelity in performing: there is then no
desert at Gods hands, but he crowns and rewards in mercy the faithfulness
of his servants. Borr. 4. David also promises for his part, to recompense
their kindness showed toward their Master: Controv. We deserve not at Gods
hand, at man's we may.
then this their loving affection toward their King, deserved a reward at man's
hand: and David succeeding in the kingdom, took it to belong unto him, to see
such good subjects recompensed. At Gods hand they deserved not; but at man's
hand a good turn or blessing may deserve. Thus David does begin his
kingdom, with princely munificence and liberality, which wins the hearts
of subjects: who, as they are in Gods stead here in earth, so herein they do
represent and imitate that great King, in mercy and bounty. Borr. 5. Thus
David shows himself a pattern of a good King, who is appointed as for the
punishment of the wicked, so for the praise and reward of weldoers: as before
he put to death the Amalekite for confessing he had killed Saul, so now he
promises reward to the Iabeshites, for their kindness toward him. Osiand.

6. Quest. verse. 8. Of Abners making of Ishbosheth King.
1. Abner offended three ways in making Ishbosheth King. 1. Because he did it
of an ambitious mind: he set up one that was simple, and of mean parts to
bear the name of a King, but Abner ruled all: as Abner, not Ishbosheth is said
to have made all his power for the house of Saul: c. 3.6. And that Ishbosheth
was but a mean man, and of a cowardly nature appears: for he went not to
battle with Saul, as being unfit and unapt thereunto: wherein his age can
yield him no excuse, he being now 40. years old: Borr. 2. Abner did herein
against his conscience, being not ignorant, that God had appointed David to be
King, as he himself confesses, c. 3.18. 3. A third fault of his was, that he
makes Ishbosheth King, whereas Mephiboseth the son of Jonathan the eldest
son of Saul, was now living: Mart.

7. Quest. Why Abner brought Ishbosheth to Mahanaim.
1. Some translate this word appellatiuely, for the Host, or Camp: as L.S.A.P.
but it is rather the name of a place on the other side of Jordan, so first
called by Jacob, because there he met the Lords host. Genesis 32. so C. Vat. Iun.
2. The cause why he fled with Ishbosheth to Mahanaim, was as Josephus thinks,
that he might be safe from the Philistims, whose country was on this side of
Jordan bordering upon the Sea: but beside this, two other reasons may be
yielded thereof: because Abner suspected, least the men of Iabesh Gilead, whom
David had entreated so kindly should fall away from Ishbosheth; and therefore
he thought it the best course, that the king should reside there, to retain
and continue their affections: as also Mahanaim being in the Land of Bashan, a
fruitful and fertile country, was in that behalf very fit to be the Kings
City. Mar. 3. That part of Israel is also described, over the which Ishbosheth
reigned: Gilead is taken for all the country beyond Jordan, a part being
taken for the whole; the country of Ashur was the furthest toward the North:
Iezrahel contains the middle region of Ishachar, Zebulun, and Nephtali: these
with Ephraim and Benjamin did inhabit in all the breadth of the land between
Jordan and the sea: so in a manner it contains a description of all Israel on
each side of Jordan, Judah excepted. Iun.

8. Quest. verse. 11. Whether Ishbosheth reigned only two years over Israel.
Whereas Ishbosheth is said to have reigned two years over Israel; and David
seven years in Hebron, before he obtained the kingdom over all Israel, it
seems that the kingdom of Israel lay vacant 5. years: to reconcile these
places, and to remove this doubt, Reconcil.
1. Some think that this interregnum or vacancie of the kingdom for five
years followed immediately after Saul's death, before Ishbosheth began to
reign. Osiand. But it is not like that they which took part with David, would
suffer the house of Saul all that while to make a way for the kingdom: and it
seems by the order of the story set down, v. 7.8. that as soon as David
had been anointed King by the men of Judah, Abner took Ishbosheth, and made
him King over Israel. Josephus also thinks that this was done presently after
Saul's death. 2. Some think that these five years followed after Ishbosheths
death. Pellic. Borr. But this is more unlike then the other, that the
Israelites having no head, being well inclined to David, while Ishbosheth
lived, would withhold their consent from David five years after his death. 3.
Therefore the best exposition is, not that Ishbosheth reigned only two years
in all: but that he had reigned two years until this time, when Abner went
out against Ioab, as it follows v. 12. R. Levi. Mart. Iun. As Saul is said to
have reigned two years over Israel, 1. Sam. 13.1. not simply, but after a
sort, as lawful King he reigned no longer.

Quest. 9. v. 12. Why David did not seek by force of arms to recover the
kingdom.
1. David remembered the oath which he had made to Saul, at that time, when he
had cut off the lap of his garment in the cave, that he would not destroy the
seed of Saul, nor abolish his name: 1. Sam. 24.22. and therefore he would not
attempt any violence against Saul's house. Mar. ^. This skirmish was begun by
Abner: who, as Josephus writes, was angry with the tribe of Judah, for making
David King, and therefore seeks to be revenged of them. 3. Yet David would
not for his oaths sake, go against his brethren himself, but sends Ioab,
who also does protract the time, and deferreth to fight, not for that he was
the weaker, but it is most like he did it by David's direction, to show how
unwilling he was to have any war with them. Mar.

Quest. 10. v. 14. Of Abners words to Ioab, Let the young men arise, and play
before us.
1. His meaning was, that they should come forth and try their valor one in
hewing and cutting an other, and so show them a bloody play: Vatab. Iun. 2.
This was like to the sword plays among the Romans, Of the unlawfulness of
sword-playes.
when cruel spectacles were exhibited on each side, in the shedding of humane
blood, as L. Florus makes mention how Iunius Brutus did exhibit in the
funeral of his father 22. couples of sword players: which he intended, to
expiate the ghosts of the dead, but it was rather to please the devil. This
kind of savage and beastly spectacles Theodosius the Emperor abhorred, and
would not behold them: yea Demonax among the Athenians, when the people
co^sulted about the showing of these sword plays, said, that they must first
break down the altar of Mercy, because such were so cruel and merciless
sights. 3. This kind of sword play, and bloody spectacle, was far worse,
then the monomachie, or single cumbate, when one to one, did fight hand to hand
for the victory: Mar. which was unlawful, as has been showed before in
part, upon the 16. chap. of 1. of Samuel, and now comes further to be
declared.

Quest. 11. v. 15. Of the setting forth twelve of Benjamin against twelve of
David's servants.
1. It is simply unlawful, to set one to one, or a certain number of men
against the like number, to try it by dint of sword, and shedding of blood, as
the Romans and Albanes, did put the trial of their government upon the
adventure of the three Horatij on the one side, and the three Curiatij on the
other. 1. It is a tempting of God, when as they put all upon such an hazard,
there being other means beside for the trial of matters. 2. They put their
confidence in the arm of flesh trusting unto their own strength* 3. Such
cumbates are against charity, one seeking an others life. 4. And against faith
all such actions are, having no warrant in the word.

2. Diverse causes may be pretended of such monomachies, and single cumbates:
which are not yet sufficient to justify them or make them lawful: first, they
allege, that when it can not otherwise be known to whom the right belongs
in the trialls of title, and in other criminal causes, who is guilty, who
innocent, that in such doubtful case, the matter may be decided, by such a
cumbate. Contra. 1. There are four ways prescribed in Scripture, whereby to
sift out the truth: by testimony of witness, by evidence of writing, Ierem.
32.10. by confession, Josh. 7. Achan acknowledged his offense: or by the oath
of the party, Exodus 22.11. if by none of these means the truth can come to
light, the party accused is to be freed, and the matter left unto the
judgment of God. 2. This were to tempt God, to show a miracle in giving the
victory unto the innocent: as sometime they used to walk upon an boat iron
barefoot, or to put their hand into scalding water for the trial of their
innocence. 3. And this is an uncertain way to try out the truth: for
oftentimes it falls out, that in such fights the innocent party is slain.

Secondly, an other cause is to try their manhood, and make ostentation of
their v^lou^, as in public tournaments, and iustings. But, though such
exercises are tolerable, which are kept without danger of life, as the running
at tilt, and such like, yet the life of man is more precious in the sight of
God, then for public ostentatio^ to be brought into apparent peril: and
beside, such challenges are against charity, because certainly the one of them
dies.

Whether a Christian being challenged into the field hand to hand ought to
take it
Thirdly, it will be objected, that when a man is challenged into the field, a
Christian may take the challenge, because otherwise it will redound to his
great dishonor. Contra. But a man's life ought to be dearer unto him, then his
honor or fame: and therefore he ought not to hazard the more p^^ncipal, to
preserve the less: beside, the profession of a Christian, which is to suffer
wrong, and not to seek revenge, is hereby disgraced, which every man ought more
carefully to preserve from blot, then his own name.

Fourthly, some think, that when a battle is pitched, it were better that a
few men should try it for the whole camp, rather then there should be a
general effusion of blood. Contra. If the cause of such war be just (as
without a just cause no war ought to be enterprised) this were to betray the
goodness of the cause, in committing such a trial. And further, the means
should be neglected, which God offreth, which is by a just battle, to decide
the cause.

Fifthly, if the Magistrate being corrupt, do give sentence against the
Innocent to die, unless he will try it by the sword with his adversary, in
this case also some give allowance to such cumbates. Contra. The innocent is
rather with patience to abide even the hardest sentence of the unjust
Magistrate, then to commit sin in the killing of an other: for we ought
rather to die, then sin.

3. It will now on the other side be objected, 1. That seeing war is lawful,
and these manomachies are but a kind of war, they are as lawful. 2. Lots
were lawful, but these singular cumbates are but a kind of lot. 3. David's
cumbate with Goliath was lawful.

Contra. 1. There is great difference between war, and a monomachie, or sole
fight: because there the battle is joined together by the strength and help
of many, one company seconding another: but here the adventure lies upon a
few: and in Scripture we have presidents of the one, but not of the other. 2.
In the casting of lots there follows no slaughter, as in this case, therefore
they are unlike: for though Jonas were taken by lot, yet he was cast over board
by his own direction having a prophetical instinct. 3. The like is to be
answered concerning David, that he took that enterprise in hand by the
extraordinary motion of Gods spirit.

4. Yet there is a kind of Monomachie that is commendable in a Christian, which
is the spiritual and internal cumbate between the spirit and the flesh:
whereof the Apostle speaks, I see an other law in my members, rebelling
against the law of my mind: Romans 7.22. Mar.

12. Quest. v. 17. Who they were which were slain in this skirmish.
1. The 24. which were chosen, on each side twelve, were all slain, they one
killed an other, there was not one left: which may seem the more strange, that
every one of them, assaulted one another in such sort, as that all of them fell
down wounded: which shows with what egernes of mind this fight was
prosecuted. 2. But afterward, these champions being thus slain, the other
armies joined, and Abners men were put to the worse: Joseph.

Quest. 13. v. 16. Of the name of the place, called chelcath hazzurim.
1. Some read, the place was called: S.L.B.G. but in the original it is, he
called, that is, every one, as Iun. or he which first gave the name: Vatab. 2.
As for the name, some give the interpretation of it; as the field or portion of
the strong: Iun. Lat. or the part of the liars in wait: Sep. or the
inheritance of the killing of the strong. C. or the portion or field of the
sword points: for tzur signifies both strong, and the point of a sword: and
chelkah is taken for the part or portion of a field, Genesis 33.19. Iun. 3. But
s^eing it is the proper name of a place, the original name is better retained:
every one called it, chelkath hazzurim: so read Mont. Page B.G. 3. This name
then was taken up, as a monument, not of true fortitude, but of cruel rage
showed in that place. Mar.

14. Quest. v. 18. Of Asahels swiftness of foot.
1. This Asahel was brother unto Ioab, and Abishai, who were all in this
battle, and he is numbered among David's Worthies, 1. Chron. 11. Mar. he is said
to be swift as a roe, by a kind of hyperbolicall speech: as Saul and Jonathan
are said to be swifter then Eagles, chap. 1.23. Josephus writes he was so
swift, that he did not only contend with men, but with horse in running. 2.
Here in Asahel we see that saying of the Preacher verefied, That the race is
not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong: Eccl. 9.11.
the swiftnes of Asahel, to the which he trusted too much, was the cause of his
ruin: which teaches, that we ought not to be too confident upon our strength,
or any other gift, No man is to trust in his strength or swiftness or any
other internal or external gift.
either inward, or outward. Josias a good Prince, trusting to his strength, and
going against Pharaoh, which he needed not to have done, was slain in the
battle. Cicero his eloquence was the cause of his confusion. Milo (so renowned
for his strength,) having rent an oak with his arms, was caught in the cleft,
the tree returning again to his place, and was there left to be a prey to the
wild beasts. Mart.

15. Quest. v. 21. Of these words, Take thee one of the young men.
1. Some think that Abner means, if Asahel were afraid to return alone,
that he should take any one of the young men to bear him company: and if he
were afraid of him, he should take away from him his weapons: Chimh. whom
Vatablus follows. 2. Josephus thinks, that he couenanteth with Asahel, so
that he would depart, and let him alone, that he should take any young man's
armor in the host, and so go his way. 3. But the meaning is thus rather; that
he would have him try his manhood, with any other soldier of the host, and
not with him, least he might after repent him: Mart. and so he gives him leave
to encounter with any of his soldiers, to slay him, and take his spoil:
wherein the fashion and guise of captains is seen in these days, that make
small account of the life of their common soldiers. Osiand.

16. Quest. v. 23. Of the death of Asahel.
1. Abner assaid by all means to persuade Asahel to desist, and leave off to
follow him: for he was afraid of Ioab Asahels brother, if he should kill
Asahel, least this might be an hindrance unto the peace, which he hoped to make
with Ioab: Mar. or it might come into his mind, as afterward, chap. 3.18. that
the kingdom should be established in David, and that Ioab should be a great
man with him: and therefore he was loath to offend him. Borr. 2. And by this
ruin of Asahel, we see it pleases not God, that even an enemy, especially
offering peace and reconciliation, should be too eagerly pursued: as that wise
saying of the elder Scipio is remembered; Viam hosti fugienti muniendam.
that a way is to be ^^de even to an enemy, when he flies. Borrh.

17. Quest. v. 26. Of Abners persuasion to Ioab to give over.
The Sun being now set, and so by Gods providence the opportunity of
further prosecuting the battle being cut off: and beside Abner and his men
standing upon their guard, both flocking together on an heap, and taking the
advantage of the place upon an hill: Iun. then Abner began to move Ioab to
cease pursuing them, and thereunto he uses three reasons. The first is from
humanity, that he should not suffer the sword to devour always: for war
being one of those things, which is not desired for it self, but as it
tends to peace, it must be used in measure: such things as are to be desired
for themselves, can not be too much followed, as virtue, honesty; but those
things which are desired and sought to some other end, must be limited and
confined. The second is, that even such victories, are not without loss, and
grief, even unto those that have the better: as the Israelites when they did
fight against Benjamin, though they overcame them at the length, yet they were
twice foiled before, Judge. 20. Mart. Beside, saying, it will be bitterness in
the end, he shows, that his soldiers being in despair of victory, if
they were still urged and pursued, might in the bitterness of their heart be
provoked, and so seek to revenge themselves: as a bear rages, being robbed
of her whelps. Pellic. His third reason is from their affinity, because they
were brethren. The Roman Chronicles make mention, that in the battle between
Sylla, and C^nna, and Marius, one brother chanced to kill an other; and after
he perceived, that he was his brother, he drew out his sword, and killed
himself. It is therefore a forceable persuasion unto peace, because they are
brethren. Mart.

18. Quest. v. 27. Of Ioabs answer to Abner.
1. Ioab refuses not to be advertised by his enemy, and to hear reason from
him: for the truth is to be received at whosoeuers hand. Mar. 2. Ioab knowing
it was David's mind rather to obtain the kingdom by peaceable means, then by
cruelty and bloodshed, was content to give over the battle upon this
occasion, for this time: for the war continued still after this, between the
house of David, and the house of Saul. Borr. Mar. 3. Ioab lays the fault upon
Abner, protesting in the name of God, that if Abner had not first provoked them
to battle, they had given over in the morning, when no assault was yet made.
Mar. Iun. Osiand.

19. Quest. v. 29. Of Bithron, through the which Abner passed.
1. Some read Bethoron, as the Latin translatour: Pellic. Borr. Bish. but
Bethoron the upper, and Bethoron the nether, were both on this side of Jordan:
this was beyond Jordan. Borr. 2. The most read Bithron, making it a proper
name: Page Montan. Vatab. Genev. but we do not read, that all that country
beyond Jordan, was called by one peculiar and proper name. 3. I rather
condescend to Iunius, that it is here rather an appellatiue, then a proper
name, and signifies, the separate or divided country: for so Bether,
signifies separation: as Cant. 2.17. the mountains of Bether, that is, of
separation: so the Septuag. read not much differing, (...), the whole plain:
the meaning then is, that Abner and his men went through all the country on
the other side of Jordan, which was divided from the rest of Israel by the
river Jordan, till he came to Mahanaim, where Ishbosheth was.

29. Quest. v. 31. Of the lawfulness of war.
1. In that Ioab by David's authority did encounter with Abner, and his men,
and obtained victory of them, and smote of Abner and his men, 360. men; we
see, that it is lawful* for Christians now also upon just occasion to wage
battle, as may appear by these reasons, and places of Scripture. 1. John
Baptist, when the soldiers came unto him, did not bid them renounce their
calling, but only said, Do violence to no man, neither accuse any falsely,
etc. he would only have them to keep within their bounds. 2. Cornelius the
Centurion, Act. 10. pleased God in that calling, and his prayers were heard,
and alms accepted before God. 3. God gave diverse laws unto his people
concerning war: as Deuteronomy. 20.6.7. it is prescribed, who should be exempted and
freed from battle, and in what manner they should behave themselves in
battle, v. 10. but if it had been unlawful at all to make war, it would
rather by law have been altogether prohibited and restrained, then by certain
orders and rules commended. 4. War also is ascribed unto God, as Exodus 17.16.
The Lord will have war with Amalek: and David is said, to fight the battles
of the Lord, 1. Sam. 25.28. But God is not the author of evil.

2. But as it is lawful to wage battle, so yet every kind of war is not
lawful. These conditions then therein are required. First, that war is not
to be attempted without the authority of the Magistrate: for to him the sword
is committed; as the Apostle says, He bears not the sword for naught. Romans
13.4. therefore it is not lawful for private men of their own head to bear
arms: but in case of extreme necessity, as where the enemies make sudden
invasion, when there is no time to consult with the Magistrate: who yet have
the secret consent and authority of the Magistrate, whose will is, that his
subjects should be preserved from wrong. Secondly, the cause of war must be
just and honest, as to deliver the oppressed, to suppress the enemies of God,
to recover things wrongfully taken away, and for such like causes. Thirdly, it
must be enterprized with a good mind; not to seek revenge, or with a desire
to the spoil of the enemies, or to grow rich by war, as mercenarie soldiers
for no other cause love war: but first all honest means must be used for
peace before war be attempted; and then the other conditions concurring, they
must proceed to battle, setting before them chiefly the glory of God, to
the end they may live in peace.

3. The contrary objections of the Anabaptists, The Anabaptists reason^
answered, who deny it to be lawful for ch^istians to make war.
that hold it not lawful for Christians to wage battle are these.

1. Our Savior Christ says, Resist not evil, whosoever will smite thee on
the right cheek, turn to him the other also.

2. Christ said to Peter, He that smites with the sword, shall perrish with
the sword.

3. S. Paul finds fault with the Corinthians for going one to law with an
other, 1. Cor. 6. much less is it lawful to go to war.

4. Christ in the parable would not have the tares weeded out, but to remain
until the time of harvest, therefore war is not to be taken in hand for to
purge the evil.

4. Christ says unto his Apostles, My peace I give unto you: Christ's kingdom
is peaceable, of the which the Prophet Isay says, they shall break their
swords into mattocks, and their spears into sythes, Isay. 2.4. How is this
Prophecy verified, if now Christians under the kingdom of Christ should
defend themselves with spears and swords?

6. The warfare of a Christian is now spiritual: as the Apostle shows, That
we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principallities and
powers, etc. against spiritual wickednesses: and therefore he would have us
put on the armor of God. Such are their reasons, which are thus briefly
answered.

Contr. 1. Our Savior in that place speaks not of the authority of the
Magistrate, but of every private man's duty, that they should be ready to
suffer wrong, if they see it make more for the glory of God, and the winning
of their brother: for otherwise our Savior himself did not keep it according
to the letter: for when he was smitten upon the one cheek, he did not turn
the other: and S. Paul being smitten upon the face, Act. 23. answered again.

2. S. Peter also was a private man, and beside, he used the sword in his heat,
with a reuengefull mind, and therefore he received that answer.

3. The Apostle does not simply forbid to go to Law; but two things he
finds fault with: the one, because they drew their brethren before the
tribunal of heathen Judges: the other, for that they were apt upon every
occasion to go to law, and would not suffer any wrong at all.

4. In that parable our Savior entreats not of the duty either of
Magistrate or Minister: but shows the present condition of the Church what it
is, that it shall never be without tares: for if that were the meaning, as they
pretend, then there should be no place left for any civil punishment, or
Ecclesiastical censure.

5. Christ indeed left peace unto his disciples, both the internal peace of
conscience, and the external also to them, which are his true followers:
neither between Christian Princes and kingdoms, which truly profess the
Gospel of Christ, does there use to be war: If Christians then were such as
by their profession they ought to be, that prophecy would have his effect here
in this world: but now because there are many carnal men in the Church, which
move debate and dissension, it is sufficient for us, that this promise of
peace being but in part begun here, be respited for the full and final
accomplishment thereof unto the next life.

6. As we are Christians indeed, so our adversaries are spiritual, and our
armor spiritual: but besides, we are men, and encumbered with the affairs
and business of this world, and have other carnal adversaries. And the
Apostle speaks by way of comparison, that our carnal enemies are nothing to
our spi^ituall, and therefore these are named not as our only enemies, but as
the chief. ex Mart.

21. Quest. v. 32. At what time Asahel was buried.
1. Josephus thinks, that Ioab lodged in the camp all that night, and the
next day after they had buried Asahel, and the rest which were slain, that
then they returned to Hebron to the King: but the text is contrary, that Ioab
and his men went all night. 2. Some think that Ioab buried him the same night
in Bethlem, and by break of day came to Hebron: whereby it may appear, that
the journey was short, and the distance of the place not great. Pellic. But it
is not like that this burial was done in the night, neither that Ioab would
foreslack the time to carry news unto the king of his good success. 3.
Therefore it is more like, that Ioab made speed going all night till he came to
Hebron to the King: and that afterward at more leisure, he attended the
funeral and burial of his brother: Mar. for it is no rare thing in Scripture,
by an anticipation of the history, to set down that as done at the same time,
which was notwithstanding effected afterward. Osiand.

CHAP. 3.
1. Quest. v. 1. How long the war continued between the house of David, and
the house of Saul.
1. SOme think that this war continued the space of two years, during which
time Ishbosheth is said to have reigned over Israel, c. 2.10. Genevens. But it
is showed before, quest. 8. of the former chapter: that there the whole time is
not set down of Ishbosheths reign, but only how long he had reigned till
that business fell out between Ioab and Abner: which being the beginning of
the war between the two houses, continued a good while after. Joseph. 2.
Neither was there any general or public war between them, but a continual
emulation and opposition: Pel. neither is there any mention made of any other
battle, saving of the former in the second chapter, which rather was a
skirmish, then a set battle. Mart. 3. David's house increased, Saul's decreased,
as this chapter shows, how Abner, the chief vpholder of Saul's house fell
away from Ishbosheth. And hereby is signified the increase of the kingdom of
Christ, and the final decay and ruin of the kingdom of Satan. Mart.

2. Quest. v. 2. Of David's sons borne unto him in Hebron.
1. Gods providence herein notably appeared, that David all the while he was in
exile had no children, but now being settled in his kingdom, he has sons
borne unto him. Mart. 2. But in that of six wives he had but six sons, this
may be observed, that the marriage of many wives was not blessed with
fruitfulness: Solomon had 700. wives, and 300. concubines, yet but one son
Rehoboam. As though nature it self gain said such marriages, as being
contrary to the first institution in the creation. Pellic. 3. David had small
comfort by these children: his eldest son Ammon committed incest, and was
slain by Absalom: Absalom rebelled against his father: Adoniah for affecting
the kingdom was put to death by Solomon: So good men may be crossed in their
children: and parents to whom God sends children, must therefore pray unto
God, to make them good children. Mart.

3. Quest. v. 3. Whether it were lawful for David to take to wife the daughter
of the King of Geshur.
1. Some think that David offended God in this marriage, and therefore he was
punished in his rebellious son Absalom the offspring of that marriage. Borr.
2. But it is rather to be thought, that David herein did not do any unlawful
thing: for they were only forbidden to join in marriage with the nations of
the Cananites, Hiuites, Iebuzites, Pherezites, and the rest: now the Geshurites
were none of them, but were a people of the Amalekites, 1. Sam. 27.8. And it
was permitted by the law, for the Israelites to have to their wives the captive
women, which were taken in battle, Deuteronomy. 21.13. though such kind of marriages
were rather tolerated, then commanded and allowed by the law. 3. So it seems
that David took this Maacah among the captives of the Geshurites, whom he
invaded: whom it is like he had taken to him before he came to Hebron: but yet
she was not then accounted among his wives, as being not yet fully purged
from her superstitious Gentilisme. Mart.

4. Quest. v. 5. Why Eglah is only called David's wife.
1. Some think, because she was but of base parentage, and was not by any
other thing commended, then that she was David's wife, she is so called, Vatab.
but there are diverse other of David's wives also, as Haggith, Abital, of whom
no honorable mention is made, saving that they were David's wives. 2. Some
think that this Eglah was Michol, called the wife of David, because she was
chief among them, as Rachel was Iaakobs principal wife: and that she was
barren from that time, when she mocked David, chap. 6. but she might
notwithstanding have had a child before. Mar. Pellic. But it is not like she
was Michol, seeing she is still called by the name of Eglah, 1. Chron. 3. and
the Scripture evidently shows, that she had no child till the day of her
death. 3. Some are of opinion, that this Eglah was one of Saul's wives: but it
was not lawful for David to marry his father in laws wife: the same degrees
being forbidden as well of affinity, which are of consanguinitie. 4. This
clause then, his wife, is to be understood in general, that every one of these
six was David's wife: and that he had these sons in Hebron by his wives,
beside those which he had by his concubines, 1. Chron. 3.9. Iun.

5. Quest. v. 7. Whether Abner in deed^ went in to Rispah, or were accused
falsely.
1. The Hebrews think that Abner would have had her to wife, which they hold
to have been a thing unusual, and intolerable, that any should marry her,
that had been the Kings wife: Pellic. and therefore Solomon took exception to
his brother Adoniah, as affecting the kingdom, because he desired to wife
Abishag. 2. Some think that Abner attempted not only to have had Rispah for
his concubine, but that he did in deed defloure her: Mart. which Ishbosheth
both took to be a disgrace unto him, she having been his fathers concubine:
and beside, it bewraied his ambitious mind as aspiring to the kingdom; as
Absalom lay with his fathers concubines, when he thought to deprive his father
of his kingdom. Borr. 3. But it is rather like, that this was a false surmise,
and suspicion, without any ground: for Abner does afterward instantly deny it:
Iun. Vatab. which may also appear by his great stomach and indignation, whose
conscience would have made him somewhat to relent, if he had been justly
charged. 4. Yet Josephus is here deceived, who says this Rispah was
Ishbosheths concubine; whereas she is called in the text Saul's concubine.

6. Quest. v. 8. Of Abners answer in general.
1. Some note in Abner his obstinacy, that being reproved for sin, could
not endure it, but seeks to work displeasure against him, that did admonish
him: sic Mar. Genevens. But it is showed before, that it is like that this was
but a mere suspicion of Abner. 2. Yet his pride and ambition appears, that
could not abide one contumelle or reproach at Ishbosheths hand: that neither
reverence to the kingdom, nor yet neerenes in blood, could contain him in his
duty, but he must break out into disloyalty. Pellic. 3. Beside, his leuitie
and inconstancy is manifest, that upon so small an occasion turns from
Ishbosheth, to take part with David: to whom he seeks to join, not of
conscience, because he was the Lords anointed; but of displeasure against
Ishbosheth. Such an inconstant person was one Ecebolus, Socrat. lib. 3.
whom Socrates makes mention of; who under Constantius the Emperor, was a
forward Christian, under Julian a professed Idolater: and under Iovinian
again, he returned to Christianity, humbly craving to be received, and crying
out, calcate me sal insipidum: tread upon me as unsavory salt. Mart.

7. Quest. v. 8. Of the meaning of Abners words, am I a dogs head.
1. Some refer it to Abner himself, that he should take it as a disgrace,
and dishonor unto him to be thus rebuked. Mar. 2. Some have reference unto
David and the rest of Judah, in this sense that Abner should be counted as a
vile person at their hands, for taking part with the house of Saul. Pellic. 3.
Others have relation to Ishbosheth, as though he should think him no better
then to be ke^per and head of the dogs of his enemy, namely David. Vatab. 4.
Some make this to be the meaning: think thou, that if I would offer my
service to David, he would think me worthy no better place then to keep his
dogs? but rather he would advance me, and have me in honor. Borr. 5. But the
better sense is, to apply it to the thing it self, and the occasion offered:
he so says, because he was accused of incontinencie and leacherie, and therein
like unto a dog, and so every way a vile person; for in these two things men
are compared to dogs: for intemperate lust; as Deuteronomy. 23.18. Thou shall not
bring the hire of a whore, nor the price of a dog into the house of God: and
for vileness, as David says to Saul; after whom do thou pursue, after a
dead dog? 1. Sam. 24.15.

8. Quest. Of these words, v. 8. Which against Judah do show mercy, etc.
1. Some read, which was with Judah? with an interrogation: as if he should
have said, have I dealt unfaithfully with thee, or fallen away from thee unto
Judah? Iun. so also reads Montanus: quod fuerim Judah, as though I had been
with Judah. 2. The Chalde thus interprets, as though I had been rejected, or
an abject to those which are left of Judah: but here diverse words are added.
3. I prefer the usual reading, am I a dogs head, which against Judah do
show mercy: not only because of the consent of interpreters, for so the most
do interpret laiehudah, not to Judah, or from Judah, but against Judah.
P.V.B.G.L. (the Septuag. does omit it altogether:) but for that it best agrees
with the whole scope of Abners speech, that he had not delivered Ishbosheth
into the hands of David, as follows afterward.

9. Quest. v. 8. Of Abners excuse: Thou imputest to me a fault concerning this
woman.
1. Some so take it, as though Abner should extenuate this fault, which he had
committed with a silly woman: that Ishbosheth had no reason in respect of his
great deserts to charge him with so small an offense. Mart. But it is not like
that Abner would have so elevated this offense, if he had been guilty of it,
seeing she had been the Kings concubine: which thing was odious in Israel, to
defile the kings concubine. 2. Pelican thus turns the words, as though the
emphasis were in thou; as if he should have said, considering I am the only
stay and vpholder of thy kingdom, how dare thou reprove me? 3. But all the
force of the words lies in the accusation it self: as if he should say, I am
free from this woman, and have committed no such thing: and therefore thou
do me wrong thus to charge me: Iun. Vat. for the words themselves seem to
contain a denial of the fact.

10. Quest. v. 12. How Abner sent messengers for himself.
This word tactau has diverse expositions. 1. Some read, from his place,
Chald. 2. Some, propter hoc, because of this. Iun. 3. Some, he sent secretly.
B. 4. But the better reading is, he sent pro se, or loco sui, for himself, or
in his stead: so V.L.A.G.M. Josephus also so interprets, that he sent
messengers in his stead: he sent not this message or embassage in the name of
Ishbosheth, or of the state of Israel, but in his own name: Mart. and on his
own behalf: the word tachath signifies pro, for.

11. Quest. v. 13. Whether David did well in using the help of Abner, and
making a covenant with him.
1. The thing which Abner now went about was not unlawful, to bring the
kingdom unto David, to whom the Lord had given it, though Abner did it of an
evil mind: as Rahab did not evil in not discovering the spies, and so
betraying the city, Ios. 2. nor the men of Luz, in showing the way into the
city, by which means it was surprised, Judge. 1.23. This therefore not being
an evil act of it self, David might therein use Abner. And so, that which is
done by an other not without sin, the servants of God may make use of without
sin: as Jacob used the benefit of Labans oath, that swear by his gods, Genesis
31. as the ten men, whom Ismael would have slain with the rest, saved their
lives, in feeding their enemies covetous desire, alleging, that they had
treasures in the field of wheat, and barley, oil, and honey, which they would
discover unto them, if they would not slay them. Ierem. 41.8.
So a poor man is excused in taking up money upon interest for his necessity,
though the usurer be not therein blameless. 2. But this liberty holds only
in things, which are not in their nature evil: for in such, we can no way
consent, or give liking, but we must sin. 3. Hitherto then David offended
not, in being contented to take advantage of this message of Abner: but herein
David was ouerseene: first, that in so weighty matter as this, he did not
first ask counsel of God: secondly, because he makes a covenant with a
wicked ambitious man, and of a suspected life. Pet. Mar.

12. Quest. v. 14. Why David sends to have his wife Michol restored unto him.
The reasons, which moved David were these. 1. In respect of himself, because
she was his first wife, and he had obtained her, with his great danger; for an
hundred foreskinnes of the Philistims: he gave 200. not 600. as Josephus, 1.
Sam. 18.27. though Saul's demand were only for an hundred. 2. In respect of
Michol, to deliver her from that reproach and infamy, living now in adultery:
for David had not dismissed her. The Rabbines think, that Phaltiel did not
company at all with her: but that is not like, seeing he was so unwilling to
part with her, v. 16. But David knew that Michol was forced by her father to
marry to Phaltiel, not of her own mind; and therein therefore has her excused.
3. By this means David makes trial of the fidelity of Abner. 4. It was a
means to make a way to the kingdom, his wife being now returned, that was
Saul's daughter. Mar.

13. Quest. v. 17. Of Abners persuasion unto the Elders of Israel and Benjamin.
1. First, he presses them, that it was their own desire to have David to be
their King: he was a King of their own choosing, and one in whom they all
delighted. 2. He reasons a facili, it was an easy matter for them, and now
in their own power to do. 3. He urges the authority of God, that had
appointed David; the Lord has spoken of David: who here like an hypocrite,
makes the word of God to serve his own turn: for it was not the word of God,
which moved him, but his own malicious heart. 4. He persuades them, ab
vtili, from the commodity, which should grow thereby to all Israel, that by
the hand of David the Lord would deliver them from their enemies. Mar.

14. Quest. v. 20. Whether David did well in making Abner a feast.
1. Abner did not content himself with that message, which he had sent before,
because things are better dispatched by personal presence, then by the
ministry and mediation of others: and because he would certify David, how he
had dealt in his behalf with all the Elders of Israel, and how he had
prevailed with them: for these reasons he comes himself in person to David:
Iosep. 2. But David did not well in making him a feast: both because he had not
first consulted with God, but followed only humane counsel, and therefore it
took no place: Pellic. as also Abner being an evil disposed man it was not
meet, that David should have eaten with him: Mar. This feast therefore ended
afterward with mourning: teaching us what uncertainty there is in these
earthly joys, that we may learn to use them soberly, and with moderation.
Borr.

15. Quest. v. 28. Of Ioabs treacherous killing of Abner.
1. When Ioab had accused Abner to the King, that he went but about to
undermine him, and seeing that the King could not be induced to deal against
Abner: then he bethinketh himself to take a course to be revenged, and sends
for him back as it seems in the Kings name, and so thinks Josephus. 2. The
causes which moved Ioab to kill Abner, was two: his hatred for the murder of
his brother Asahel; and his envy, least Abner might have grown too great in
the Kings favor, and so obscured him. Borr. But this latter was the greatest
motive, as afterward upon the like cause he killed Amasa; yet he pretends the
other, the death of his brother, as the end of the verse shows. 3. Ioab
smites Abner in the same place, where he had smitten Asahel before: and though
Ioab herein committed that which was both unworthy himself, and his master the
King, and for the which he worthily suffered afterward under Solomon: yet the
judgment of God was just upon Abner, a wicked and bloody man: and the Lord
turns it to the great good of David, in taking out of the way a new
reconciled enemy, who would hardly have proved faithful. Mar.

16. Quest. Of the place where Ioab killed Abner.
1. The most read, that he took him into the mids of the gate: L.V.P.M.
rather within the gate: C.I. or aside in the gate: B.G.S. not to talk with him
in an open and public place (to be without suspicion) for the gate was the
place of judgment. Mar. But he rather took him aside, and apart from the
rest, to talk with him more secretly: Joseph. who thinks also, that his
brother Abishai was by: which is not unlike; for he also consented, v. 30. 2.
The word besheli, some read peaceably: B.G.C. some craftily: L.P.S.V. but it
rather signifies, in error, or unawares: as c. 6.7. it is said that God smote
Vzzah for his error. Iun. ghal hashall.

17. Quest. v. 29. Of the fearful curse, and execration, which David lays
upon Ioab and his posterity.
Whereas David accurseth Ioab and his posterity, and lays upon them an
heavy burden of five calamities and miseries: the running issue, the
leprosy, weakness, and faintness to go with a staff, untimely death by the
sword, and penury and want of bread: wherein David shows himself more
severe against his own servant and kinsman, then he was either against Saul or
any enemy he had.

1. Some therefore think that David did curse Ioab of impotencie and weakness
of affection, being in anger and grief, and that therefore all these evils
did fall upon his posterity: for they say, that Rehoboam had a running issue,
Vzziah was a leper, Asa had the gout, Josias was slain with the sword, and
Iehoiakim wanted bread: so the Rabbines. But these Kings of David's line were
thus punished for their own sins, not for David's. Mar.

2. Some think, that this was no imprecation, but a prediction by the spirit
of God of such evils, as should befall Ioab, and his posterity: but the form
of speech and the manner of phrase, let the blood fall, etc. shows it to be a
very imprecation, and malediction.

3. Some do make question, whether this curse of David being uttered in his
heat and affection, did afterward take place, or no: Mar. But seeing David was
a Prophet, and here the reason is given of this judgment, because both the
brethren consented to kill Abner in time of peace, because he killed their
brother in battle, v. 30. all which circumstances do exaggerate the offense:
it is not to be doubted, but that this curse took place upon Ioab and his
family, as that other of David upon the mountains of Gilboa, where Saul and
Jonathan were slain, took effect, 2. Sam. 1.21. and the leprosy of Naaman,
by the Prophets sentence did cleave unto Gehezi. And that this Prophetical
curse was effectual, it seems to be the opinion of Iun. and Bor.

4. It being then resolved upon, that David both as a Prophet accursed Ioab
his sin of blood so deserving, and as a wise man, that it might appear to
all Israel that David was no way consenting to this fact: yet these doubts
further will be made: First, why David lays this curse upon the whole
family, not excepting the innocent: whereas in the law, the Lord is said to
visit the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, to the third and fourth
generation of those that hate him.

Ans. 1. This condition is always included in such prophetical curses, though
it be not expressed. 2. or David might foresee, that there should be always
some in Ioabs family, whose sins might be worthy of those plagues: 3. and
yet in temporal chastisments the children may bear the iniquity of the
fathers, without any impeachment of Gods justice. 2. Kin. 5 2^.
So the Prophet imposes the plague of leprosy upon Gehezi and his seed for
ever, without any exception.

Secondly, it will be objected, why David does pronounce this execration rather
against Ioab, then against Saul, which put the Lords Priests to the sword. Ans.
Saul was the Lords anointed, and therefore David was no more to curse him, then
to lay violent hands upon him: again, he should have seemed to do it in his
own cause: but the case was diverse here: for Ioab being herein but a private
person killed Abner, contrary to the Kings faith and safe conduct given him:
and did by this means, as much as in him lay, if David had not carried the
matter wisely, hinder the establishment of David's kingdom.

Thirdly, but why did not David then, having obtained the kingdom, himself
take condign punishment upon Ioab. Ans. 1. Both because it would have weakened
his government, if he should at the very first have showed severity toward a
man of his own kindred, and which had deserved so well of him: and Ioabs sin
was not yet come to the full: he afterward killed Amasa also in the like case:
so that his punishment, though a while deferred, was the more heavy and
grievous when it came, Borrh.

18. Quest. v. 31. Why David commanded Ioab to put on sackcloth and mourn for
Abner.
1. Ioab might be thought to rejoice, and be glad, that Abner was overthrown,
and therefore he might seem a very unmeet man to celebrate Abners funeral:
David therefore, in forcing them thereunto, some may think, did make him play
the hypocrite: But, it was fit and requisite, that Ioab being a principal man
under David, should not be wanting in this solemnity: David then requiring him
thereunto, did that, which was fit: if Ioab therein dissembled, it was his own
fault. So Princes may enjoin their subjects to come to the exercises of
religion: Princes may compel their subjects to the exercises of religion.
if they present not themselves with true devotion, the offense rests in them
that fail therein, not in him that commands: as the King of Niniveh
commanded a general fast to be kept thorough the City: it is like it was not
religiously kept of all: So the Lord in the Law commands, that the three
solemn feasts in the year should be kept of all: and yet all the Israelites
had not a sound and upright heart toward the Lo^d. 2. David might enjoin this
duty unto Ioab, as a part of punishment: that he is constrained publicly to
bewail him, whom in his rage he had slain. 3. And this might be a means
also, to bring Ioab to acknowledge his sin, seeing the great lamentation,
which was made for Abner, whom he had slain: Mar.

19. Quest. v. 33. Of these words: Dyed Abner as a fool dies?
1. David bewayleth Abner, and commends him as a valiant man, but not for any
virtue or goodness in him: for the wicked may have some commendable parts,
which are not to be deprived of their due praise. 2. The meaning then of David's
words is this; that Abner died not as a coward, that is taken in war, and
lead captive, his hands being bound: nor as a malefactor, whose feet are tied
with fetters. Borr. But he would have showed his valor both by his hands, and
feet, if they had tried with him with open fight: Iun. whereas now they killed
him treacherously; as a man being never so valiant, may be circumvented by
wicked conspiratours. Genevens.

20. Quest. v. 34. Of David and the peoples weeping and lamenting for Abner.
David lamenteth, and fasteth till even, to show and express his grief for
Abner, and that thereby he might content all Israel, and clear himself as not
being accessarie to his death: but no mention is here made of any prayers made
for Abner: yet the Romanists dare avouch, that this fasting and mourning of
David was for the relief of Abners soul: and that for this cause the
Patriarks desired to be buried in the land of Canaan, that they might be
relieved by the prayers of the Church: hereof also it is, Controv. Against
Purgatory.
that David would not pray for his child, after he knew he was dead, because
the infant needed not David's prayers: to this purpose Bellarm. lib. 1. de
purgator. c. 3.

Contra. 1. It is evident by the text, that all this lamentation of David, was
to show his grief, that there was a great man fallen in Israel, v. 38. neither
is there one syllable of any prayer made for Abner: it is then great boldness
to ground that error upon Scripture, which is altogether silent in that
behalf: neither were there any sacrifices in the law (there being so many
diverse kinds prescribed) appointed for the dead. 2. Neither was that any cause
of their desire to be buried in the land of Canaan: but only to show their
hope, in the certain expectation of the promises of God: and to be a monument
to their posterity, that the Lord would bring them thither: for otherwise,
seeing the Israelites continued in Egypt almost 200. years after Jacobs
burial in Canaan, if he had intended to be helped by the prayers of the
Church, he should have desired to have his bones kept in Egypt, and then carried
thence at their departure, as Joseph did, that he might have had the benefit of
the Churches prayers, which yet was to soiourne there. 3. And the cause is
evident why David cease to pray any longer for the infant being dead, because
he knew, that then he should not be brought to life again. The child's soul
indeed had no need of David's prayers, no more had the souls of the faithful
departed: and for the rest, that died in their sin, they received their
judgment, and by the prayers of the living could not be relieved.

21. Quest. v. 39. Of the meaning of David's words, I am weak, and the sons
of Zerviah are too hard for me.
1. Some think, that whereas the word here used, (rach) signifies tender,
that David speaks of his clemency, and mercy, that he had spared Abner, and
showed him favor, but the sons of Zerviah, (which was his sister, by whom
they are called, because it seems their father was but obscure) were hard
hearted, and cruel. 2. Some other do make this the sense, that whereas David's
kingdom was but yet weak, these two men showed more inhumanitie and
inclemencie, then was for the safety of his kingdom. 3. But it is evident by
David's words, that he has relation to himself, that they were too hard for
him: it was not in his power to punish them, as their fact deserved, and
therefore he commits the revenge of this cause unto God.

22. Quest. v. 39. Whether David offended in deferring and forbearing the
punishment of Ioab.
1. Some are of opinion, that David offended herein, and of a partial
affection spared Ioab, whereas he ought to have been put to death: and thus
they do reason. 1. By the law, he that slaieth a man presumptuously, is to be
taken from the Altar, and to be put to death, Exodus 21.14. his punishment is
not to be deferred or suspended. 2. It was the ruin of Eli his house, because
he was too remiss toward his children. 3. And the King of Israel is reproved,
because he let Benhadad go, when the Lord had given him into his hands. Mart.

Contra. 1. Neither did David pardon Ioab, but he gave charge unto Solomon
concerning him, who caused him to be slain at the Altar: and that law
commands not that which is not possible, or not in the Magistrates power to
perform: as if a murderer fly the country, and so be out of the Magistrates
power, he does not break the Law, in not putting him to death: so neither does
he, that can not reach the malefactor, without great tumult, and danger to the
common wealth, but watches his convenient time to do it; which was David's
case here. 2. Eli might have corrected his sons without any danger, so could
not David. 3. And so was Benhadad delivered into the Kings hand, who being a
foreign enemy might with less trouble have been put to death, then Ioab a
domestical friend, and much favored among the people.

2. The better opinion then is, that David did prudently forbear to punish
Ioab: not so much because he was his kinsman, and had been faithful unto him
in the time of his affliction, Pellic. or that he had many ways well deserved
of him, and could not well spare his service: Borrh. but for that they were too
hard, and strong for him. And it seems in the history of Absalom, c. 18.19.
that Ioab did bear greater sway among the soldiers and military men, then
David himself: therefore it is a wise man's part, as well to consider, what may
be done, as ought to be done: Iun. This then was in David no conniuence or
winking at Ioabs sin, which he bare in mind, and charged his son to see
justice executed. But David prudently deferred the punishment only, which
could not presently without great danger be inflicted. At other times, when it
was in his power, he delaied not to do justice; as upon the Amalekite, that
said he had killed Saul, and upon those two, that killed Ishbosheth. The like
example we read of Jacob, who when his two sons Simeon and Levi had committed
that shameful murder upon the Sichemites, did not proceed against them, being
then a Magistrate in his own family: but deferred the censure till his death,
Genesis 49.5. for both his children being stubburne and unruly were too strong for
him, and beside there was then no time, to make a stir in his own family,
they being round about beset, and environed of their enemies.

23. Quest. v. 39. Of these words of David, The Lord reward the doer of evil
according to his wickedness.
1. Some think, that this is rather a prediction of David, what should befall
the wicked, then an imprecation. But it may very well be a prayer also, which
David makes against those, which continue in their sin without repentance.
Mar. 2. Yet it may seem strange, that David prays for revenge upon Ioab for
this murder, seeing he himself calls for mercy at Gods hand, for the like
sin committed against Vrias: wherefore here he must be understood to speak
of those, which were impenitent, not of those which were touched with a feeling
of their sins, as David was, when as a testimony of his unfeigned repentance
he endited the 51. Psalm. Borrh. 3. But concerning the meaning of these words,
these three things are to be considered. 1. That God neither renders to good
works nor evil works in this world, according to the rule and measure of
equality, but in some proportion and similitude: for he rewards good works
more liberally, then they are worthy of; and evil works he recompenseth with
less punishment then they deserve. 2. Good works are no cause of their
reward, but they are crowned in mercy: but evil works are meritorious causes
of their punishment. 3. Neither does God recompense all evil doers according
to their works, but such only as are obstinate and impenitent. Mar.

CHAP. 4.
1. Quest. v. 3. What Berothites, and when they fled to Gittaim.
1. SOme understand it of Baanah and Rechub, the two captains of Ishbosheth,
that they fled away from Ishbosheth, because of some crime, which they had
committed: some, for that they had conspired with Mephibosheth, who discovered
them: ex Mart. But the history it self is against this sense: for how could
these two have opportunity to kill Ishbosheth, and to have such free ingresse
to the house of Ishbosheth, if they had fled before, and had been as it were
banished from him. 2. Therefore it is better referred to the inhabitants of
Beroth: not that they all fled away because of this conspiracy of Baanah, and
Rechub, as Osiander: for this their flying, and departure went before this
treason practiced against Ishbosheth. 3. But the truth is, that the Berothites
had fled a^ay from Beroth a town of Benjamin, Josh. 19.25. when they had heard
of the death and overthrow of Saul: then the Philistims came, and dwelt in there
Cities: they removed therefore from Beroth to Gittaim, which was neither a
town in Edom, or Arabia, but in Benjamin, Nehem. 11.33. Iun. Borrh. Genevens.
Vatab. 4. And this is the cause, why mention is made of this flight: that these
captains being Berothites might be known to be of the children of Benjamin,
because they were Berothites; though at this time their city were inhabited by
the Philistims, yet it was reckoned still with Benjamin. Iun.

2. Quest. v. 4. Why mention is made of Mephibosheth.
1. This narration is inserted, to show the purpose and drift of these two
captains in killing of Ishbosheth: they saw that none remained of Saul's house,
who was likely to succeed in the kingdom, and to revenge Ishbosheths death,
but only Mephibosheth, who was a lame man: Iun. and beside, he was but a
child; not above 12. year old: for 5. year old he was at the time of Saul's
death, and David had now reigned toward seven years in Hebron: Saul had other
sons by Rispah his concubine, but they could not be heirs to the kingdom:
Borr. 2. Further, hereby appears the providence of God, so disposing all
things for David's good, that the kingdom might be deuolued unto him, without
his own seeking: for seeing there was none left of Saul's house, saving
Ishbosheth, who was afterward killed, and Mephibosheth, the one lame in body,
the other impotent in mind, the people of necessity were now to look after
David, and to desire him to be their King: as it follows in the next chapter.
Pellic.

3. Quest. v. 6. How these captains disguised themselves, when they entered in
to kill Ishbosheth.
1. The Chalde thinks that they came as merchants to buy corn, so also
Vatab. but if they had been strangers, it is not like they should have had
such ready access. 2. Some think they came as to fetch corn for the
soldiers and the camp. Martyr. 3. But seeing the word lakach signifies as
well to bear, as to take or fetch; it is more like, that they made as though
they were domestical servants, and so came in bringing of wheat: Iun. Page 4.
The Septuag. read, that the door keeper was cleansing, and purging of wheat:
but there is no such thing in the text.

4. Quest. v. 7. Of Ishbosheths secure sleep.
1. Though it seems to have been usual in those countries, to have their
afternoon nappes, as we read of David, c. 12.3. both because the nights were
short, and therefore they took up some part of their sleep in the day: Mar.
and the heat of the day, which is very fervent in those countries, made them
also drowsy: Joseph. 2. Yet this heavy sleep of Ishbosheth, being now left
naked, and without defense (Abner being slain) shows both his security
touching his own estate, and his negligent administration of the kingdom: so
Jonas slept in the ship when the tempest arose, and great danger was at hand;
and the disciples were asleep, when their master was in his greatest agony.
Matthew. 26.40.
3. But sleep it self is not to be accused: for as some are overtaken in
their sleep; so sometime it is a mean of deliverance, and to escape danger:
as Plutarch has a story how Mithridates sent one Oltacus to kill Lucullus,
who coming thither as to do a message of some importance, and answer being
returned, that he was asleep, and it was against his health to be awaked; he
thereupon fled away, least he should have been further sifted. 4. And seeing
Ishbosheth was thus slain in his sleep, it teaches us to commend our selves
unto God, when we go to our rest, because we know not what may happen unto
us in our sleep. Martyr.

5. Quest. v. 8. Of their words to David, The Lord has avenged my lord, etc.
1. True it is, that this came to pass by the secret working and disposing of
Almighty God, that David might be established in his kingdom: and it was
just, that Ishbosheth should come to such an end, because he usurped upon the
kingdom, which the Lord had appointed to an other. 2. But this was no good
excuse, or defense of their unlawful act, in killing their Lord: for by this
means, Judas treachery toward his Lord might be excused, because it was done
according to the determinate counsel of God. Indeed when Alexander in his
rage and wine, had killed Clitus, and afterward was stricken with grief,
Aristander did comfort him, by laying the cause and original thereof upon the
fates, wherewith Alexanders grief was somewhat qualified. 3. Neither had these
two murderous and bloody men any such intent, herein to obey Gods will, but
respected only their own advancement and preferment therein. Mart.

6. Quest. v. 9.10. Of David's answer to the traitors that brought Ishbosheths
head.
1. David utters three excellent sentences: the one in saying, as the Lord
lives, who has delivered me: showing that unlawful means must not be used
to hasten the Lords work, but that we must with patience weight upon God: the
other, that we must not rejoice in the destruction of an enemy, as David did
not neither in Saul's death, nor Ishbosheths: the third, that honesty is to be
preferred before profit and utility, and that the counsels and enterprises of
the wicked must not be approved, though they be for our profit: Borr. 2. David
will much more be avenged of these men, then of the Amalekite that said he
killed Saul; both in respect of their persons, who were servants to Ishbosheth,
and of the same tribe, whereas the Amalekite was a stranger, and not of Israel:
as also of him that was slain, who was a righteous person: in respect of them
which conspired against him, he had deserved well of them; so had not Saul of
the Amalekites, whom he had destroyed, and Saul had already his deaths wound,
and could not recover, but Ishbosheth was then a sleep, and in good health:
the one was killed in the field, the other in his own house: and thirdly,
David was then but as a private man, when he commanded the Amalekite to be
killed, but now he was anointed King in Hebron: therefore in all these three
respects, there was greater cause why he should put them to death, then the
other.

7. Quest. v. 12. Of the cutting off their hands and feet and hanging them up.
1. David either caused their bodies which were hanged up, to be taken down
before night, according to the Law, Deuter. 21. and as it was practiced by
Iosuah, c. 7. Mart. or else he hung up only their hands and feet over the
poole in Hebron, Reconcil.
after their bodies were taken down, both in detestation of that horrible
murder, and to be a spectacle to others: Borr. An example is made of those
parts, which were the special instruments of contriuing this villainy, their
feet in going to shed blood, and their hands in cutting off his head: Mart.
2. This cutting off the hands and feet, was beside the prescript of the law,
which commanded the murderer only to be put to death: but as the sin might
be more heinous, so the Magistrate might also increase the punishment; as they
cut off Adonibezeks thumbes of his hands and feet. So that though the Law
inflicted only the bare punishment of death, Judge. 1.
yet according to the circumstances of the crime, more grievous torments might
be added by the Magistrate: Mar. He was not to adiudge to death, where the law
imposed not the punishment of death: but he might aggrauate that penalty, in
the manner of death, according to the quality of the offense.

CHAP. 5.
1. Quest. v. 1. How all the tribes of Israel came to David, and of the sum
of their embassage.
ALl the multitude came not, but the Elders only and chief in the name of the
rest: Mar. or rather messengers, and ambassadors from all the tribes: Iun. 2.
They use three reasons and persuasions, which moved them to affect David for
their king: first, he was of their kindred, of their bones and flesh, as they
were appointed by the Law, to make a king from among their brethren, Deuteronomy.
17.15. secondly, they had experience of his valor in the days of Saul, when he
led the people in and out: thirdly, the Lord had elected him; as the law
likewise requires that they should make him their king, whom the Lord should
choose, Deuter. 17.15. Borr. The Lord had said unto him by Samuel, when he
anointed him, Thou shall feed my people: the sign went not without the word:
though in that place for breui^ie s^ke it be omitted. Iun.

2. Quest. How they made a covenan^ before the Lord.
1. Some think that after Shilo was destroyed, an high place was erected in
Hebron, where they offered sacrifices unto God: Pellic. where Abraham also in
his time had built an altar: and therefore they are said ther^ to make a
covenant before the Lord: Mart. But it was not lawful: for any sacrifice
ordinarily to be offered, but where the arc was. 2. Some think that the high
Priest was present with his Vrim and Thummim: Borr. Josephus also says, that
the high Priest was there, with diverse other Priests and Levites; but not the
presence of the Priests only, but of the Arc also was requisite, (when in
that sense they were said to be before the Lord) which was yet in Abihadabs
house: Geneuens. 3. Some think it is so said, because God is present in the
assemblies of his Saints: yea where two or three are gathered together in his
name: Vatab. 4. But it signifies more then so, that they took the Lord
solemnly to witness, and so as in his presence, and by his name, made this
solemn league and covenant: Iun. Geneuens.

3. Quest. Of the number of those, which came to David to Hebron.
1. Though the number be not here expressed, it is at large set down, 1.
Chron. c. 12. v. 23. to the end of the Chapter. The particular numbers out of
every tribe that came to David were these; out of Judah, 6800. out of Simeon,
7100. of Leui 4600. of Benjamin, 3000. of Ephraim, 20800. of the half tribe of
Manasseh, 18000. of Issachar, 200. captains with their companies, the number
whereof is not set down: of Zebulun, 50000. of Nephtali 1000. captains, and
with them 37000. of Dan, 28000. of Asher, 40000. and of them beyond Jordan an
120000. The whole number being summed together, makes about 300000. 2. But
Josephus somewhat differs in his account; for the odd 800. years of Judah,
he reckons but 600. for the odd 600. of Leui, he writes 700. he numbreth of
Issachar, 20000. which is not expressed in the text: and the number of 30000.
out of Nephtali he omitteth: from them beyond Jordan, he accounts but 22000.
who made 120000. 3. Of all these the most backward are noted to have been of
Benjamin: for of that tribe came the smallest number, but 3000. for they yet
held with the house of Saul: the most forward were they of Zebulun, as it
appears by their number of 50000. which was the greatest of any one tribe:
and they are directly mentioned not to have bin of a double heart. Iosep. l. 7.
antiq. cap. 2.
And Josephus writes that this tribe only came whole to David.

4. Quest. Of the time that David reigned over Israel. v. 4.
The whole time is said to be 40. years: whereof he reigned 7. years six
months in Hebron, and 33. years in Jerusalem: which make in all 40. years
six months. 1. Some think that these six months are not summed, because so
long the kingdom of David was intermitted by the rebellion and sedition of
Absalom: so the Hebrews. 2. Others think that the 33. years mentioned were
but 32. years and a half: the imperfect year being counted for an whole and
perfect year: Iun. Pell. 3. But it is more like, that to make the number of
40. year even, the odd six months are omitted: Borrh. see the like Iud.
20.46. where there are said to be slain of Benjamin, 25000. men, in which
number one hundred is omitted: for v. 25. they are said to be 1800. This place
Iunius alleges for his opinion, that to make a round and even number, 33.
years are put for 32. and an half: but the place shows rather that to make
a perfect and square number, sometimes the odd overplus is detracted rather,
then added.

5. Quest. v. 6. Of the city Ierushalem, and the name thereof.
1. David goes unto this city purposing to make in the head city of the
kingdom, not only in respect of the situatio^ thereof, being set as it were in
the mids of the tribes, but he by the direction of Gods spirit did see, that it
was the place, which the Lord did choose: where sometime Melchisedec dwelt, that
great priest of the most high God, and there was the mount Moria, where Abraham
would have sacrificed his son. 2. Ierushalem it was called, not of the Greek
word (...), which signifies holy: neither as though it came of Iebus, and
shalem, and for the better sound, Ierushalem, as Peter Mar. But it is better
derived of ijreh, he will be seen: as Abraham says, in the mount will the
Lord be seen, Genesis 22. and shalem, peace: so Ierushalem signifies the vision
of peace: see Midras in Psalm. 76. 3. This City was given part of it to the
tribe of Judah, Josh. 15. part to the tribe of Benjamin, Josh. 19. for it
belonged to both those tribes: the tribe of Judah took this city, and smote
it with the edge of the sword, Judge. 1.8. but the Iebusites were not thence
expelled by the children of Benjamin, v. 21. And afterward the Iebusites
inhabited there still, for it was a city of strangers, when the Leuite went
that way with his concubine, Iud. 19.12. But the perfect conquest of this City
was reserved for David, who therein was a lively type of the Messiah, who
should perfectly triumph over our spiritual enemies. Mart.

6. Quest. Who were the blind and lame spoken of v. 6. Except thou take away
the blind and the lame, thou shall not come hither.
1. The Hebrews have here a fabulous narration of two images, one of Isaac,
who was blind, and the other of Jacob, who was lame, by whom a league was made
with Abimelech, in which league the Iebusites also were comprehended: so that
in effect the Iebusites which held the tower of Sion, say thus much, that
unless they first would violate that covenant, they were not to come up
thither: But this conceit has no probability: for Abimelech was King of the
Philistims, not of the Iebusites: therefore the league rather appertained to
them, then unto the other. 2. Some by blind and lame, understand the wicked and
sinners: as the Chald. ^. Some think the Iebusites mean their blind and lame
images: Genevens. Mart. but it is unlike that they would themselves so call
their Idols, wherein they trusted. 4. Wherefore the meaning rather is this,
that they were so confident upon the strength of the place, that the very
blind and lame were able to defend it against them: therefore they speak this
in derision, mocking and scorning David, that he should not be able to overcome
the very blind and lame among them. Vatab. Iun. Pellic. Borrh.

7. Quest. v. 8. Of the reward which David propounds to him that should smite
the blind and lame.
1. The speech is here somewhat imperfect, what shall be done to him that
smites them: but it is supplied 1. Chron. 11.6. that he should be the chief
captain, that did that exploit: by which service Ioab obtained to be the
chief captain. 2. By such rewards and promises, the minds of men are whetted,
to enterprise such difficult works: Indeed, How far rewards are to be
respected.
every one ought to be ready to do things honest without respect to the
reward, but such is our humane infirmity, that it had need to be stirred up
and provoked by such means. 3. But there is a great difference to be made
between these terrene rewards proposed by men, and the heavenly rewards which
the Lord promises: for rewards from men may be deserved, so can not the other.
Men for their temporal service may have respect to the one, and for the reward
sake undertake the business: but in heavenly things we are not to love God for
the reward sake, but the reward for Gods sake. Mart. 3. Some think that David
was ouerseene in granting so liberal a reward to Ioab, a bloody and wicked
man: Martyr. But I see no reason, why an evil man may not receive a reward of
temporal honor, for a temporal service done for the good of the common
wealth; wherein his euilnes is not rewarded, but his valor, and not for his
own sake, but for the good ensample, and encouragement of others.

8. Quest. v. 8. Of the proverb, the blind and lame shall not come into that
house.
1. That is, say some, the blind and lame Idols shall not come into the Temple:
Genevens. But if this exploit had not been, David would never have suffered
Gods house to be defiled with Images. 2. Some take it to be used only as a
Proverb, when any thing is brought to pass, that is unlikely, and hard to be
done. Mar. Pellic. 3. But it is evident rather, that David did make this order,
as a perpetual monument of this victory, that neither any blind or lame
should be suffered to enter into his palace, called the city of David: as
none that mourned in sackcloth were admitted into the King of the Persians
palace: Est^r 4.2.
but this was done of an ambitious and superstitious pride; David observed the
other, as a monument of his thankfulness to God. Iun.

9. Quest. v. 9. Of Millo, from the which it is said, that David built.
1. Some take it for the town house, or the place where the people had their
solemn assemblies: and it was so called Millo, of filling or replenishing.
Genev. 2. Some think it was the deep ditch or valley, which was between the
tower of Sion, and the city, which was filled with water: R. Ben Gers. but
Jerusalem being situate in a dry place, it is not like that such plenty of
water stood always in the valley. Mart. 3. Therefore it is better taken for
the rampire or fortress, which compassed the tower of Sion round about, being
environed with a wall: Borrh. Iun. the Septuag. reads, (...), as ab
extremitate, from the extremity: the Chalde call it the abstruction, that is,
the antemural or rampire. It was not the proper name of a place: for there was
a Millo also in Shechem, which was the tower and fortress thereof, Judge. 9.6.
and 49. 4. David is said to have built round about from the fortress inward,
because Ioab repaired the rest of the city without, 1. Chron. 11.8.

10. Quest. v. 12. Of these words, Then David knew, that the Lord had
established him King.
1. The Rabbines think that David took this extraordinary kindness of Hiram
the King of Tyrus to be a sign of Gods favor toward him, and that the Lord
had established him king. 2. For though temporal blessings are not always a
sign of Gods favor, nor unto all: as namely to worldly and carnal men, that
do not acknowledge God the author of them: and therefore it is said, that the
Lord fills their bellies with his hid treasure, Psalm. 17.14. for they are
snared and entangled with their prosperity. 3. Yet God reuealeth to his
children, when prosperity is sent as a sign of his favor, and when
adversity is inflicted upon them for their sin* and indeed simply, peace
and prosperity is always a blessing upon the righteous, who may
notwithstanding in their high estate forget themselves, How far temporal
blessings are a sign of Gods favor.
and affliction never comes upon them, but for some sin which God by this
means would bring to their knowledge. 4. And though temporal blessings are no
sure argument, no not to the righteous of Gods everlasting favor: yet they may
be a sign of further good success in temporal things; as this friendship of
Hiram was a token to David of the confirming of his kingdom: so elsewhere
David says, show a token of thy goodness toward me, that they which hate me
may see it and be ashamed. Psalm. 8^.17.
Then a temporal favor is a sign of Gods love, when it is joined with the
honor of God: but when God chastises his children even with the hazard of his
own glory and name in the world, it is an evident demonstration of his anger.

11. Quest. Of David's concubines, wives, and sons. ver. 13.
1. A concubine differed from a wife in these three things: First, the wife was
solemnly espoused, so was not the other: the wife was also endowed, so was not
the concubine: the children of the wife were legitimate and did inherit, so
did not the other: Mart. 2. David h^d in all eight wives, six in Hebron, and
two afterward, Bethsabe and Sulamith, and ten concubines, c. 20.3. Herein,
although the Rabbis would excuse David for his multiplicitie of wives, which
he took for procreation, and to insinuate himself into the love of his
people, whose daughters he made his wives and concubines: yet therein he showed
his infirmity, in taking him many wives contrary to the Law, Deuteronomy. 17.16. 3.
Concerning his sons, they are somewhat diversely rehearsed here, and 1. Chron.
c. 3. and c. 14. both in name and number, Shammua is called Shime^, 1. Chron.
3.5. Elishua is named Elishamah, 1. Chron. 3.5. and Eliada Beeliada, 1. Chron.
14.3. And here are but eleven rehea^sed, in the other places two more are
named, Eliphalel or Elph^let, and Nagah.

11. Quest. v. 20. Of the victory which David had against the Philistims.
1. Now the time is come, that the Philistims should receive condign
punishment that had so insolently behaved themselves, when Saul and Jonathan
were slain. And God so disposes in his wise providence, that they should
first provoke David to battle: he began not with them, least he might have
seemed unthankful, seeing he had found harbor and entertainment among them in
the days of Saul. Mart. 2. The Philistims pitched in the valley of Rephaim,
which was not far from Jerusalem, Joseph. and belonged to the tribe of Judah,
Josh. 15.8. Iun. Some take it to be the same place, which is here called Baal
Perazim: Pellic. but they seem rather to be two diverse places: and that the
Philistims host was so large, the Phenicians and other nations assisting them,
as Josephus says, that the one part being in the valley, the other reached to
Baal Perazim: Mart. and that they were two places, appears 1. Chron. 14.11.
for the Philistims went up from the valley of Rephaim to Baal Perazim. 3.
David, as before the battle, he consulted with God by the Priest with Vrim and
Thummim, and thereupon went to the fort, (which is likely to have been the
tower of Sion) not to trust to the defense of the place, but till he had
consulted with God: so the battle being finished, and the victory obtained,
he to show his thankfulness to God, leaves a monument of that victory
obtained, by giving the name Baal Perazim to the place, which signifies the
plain of division, or breaking asunder: because David brake in upon them, even
as waters in a great ouerflowing, or inundation, as he himself says.

12. Quest. v. 21. How David serves the images of the Philistims.
1. The word translated Idols, is ghatzabehem, their idols, or images: which
word properly signifies grief or terror; for the superstitious adoration of
images brings no true comfort, but grief and terror to those that worship
them: Iun. Mart. the Chalde reads, their errors: for they do greatly err,
who follow after vain Idols. 2. David takes them: the Chal. reads, burned
them: so also Page B.G. but the word nasa, signifies properly, to take: yet
David took them away, not with an intent to convert them to the use of the
Tabernacle, as Pellic. but he took them to burn them: as is evident, 1.
Chron. 14.12. so was it commanded, that they should burn their graven images
with fire, Deuteronomy. 7.5. As Jacob burned them under an oak, and so took them out
of the way: and Moses burned the golden calfe, and beat it to powder, that the
occasion of offense and stumbling might utterly be removed out of the way: for
otherwise we read, that they which preserved or erected such superstitious
monuments, put a stumbling block before the people, as Micah did by making him
images, Judge. 17. Mar. 3. The superstition also of the Philistims herein showed
it self, who carried their Idols with them into their camp, thinking thereby
to be protected: therein, as it seems imitating the Israelites, who carried
the Arc into the host, 1. Sam. 4. As the Pope-Catholikes at this day do use
to carry with them into the field, Controv. Against the carrying about of the
host.
their superstitious Relics, their consecrated host, and such other toys,
thinking thereby to be defended. And further herein the beggarly impotencie of
their vain Idols is made manifest, which were so far from giving any comfort
or aid, to their worshippers, as that they were not able to defend themselves,
but were taken captive. Martyr.

13. Quest. v. 24. What the noise was in the top of the mulberrie trees.
1. Some read, in the top of the pear trees: L. some in the top of the
trees: C. in the wood of mourning: S. but baca with aleph, signifies a
mulberrie tree; with (he) mourning: and beside, it should have no sense to say,
when thou hear the noise of one going in the tops of mourning. 2. This
noise some think was procured by the rushing of the wind, some by the Angels,
which is most like, for it was extraordinary. And it might serve, as well to
terrify the hearts of the Philistims, who did fly at the noise of a leaf
shaken, being stricken with a great fear, as to be a sign of the presence of
God: some think it was such a great noise, as that the Philistims heard not
the approaching of David's army: but the special use was, to signify unto
David, that the Lord was present to deliver him, and to fight for him against
the Philistims.

CHAP. 6.
1. Quest. v. 1. Whether this history of bringing the Arc from Abinadabs
house be transposed.
WHereas the story is rehearsed, 1. Chr. 13. before David had the former
battle with the Philistims: 1. P. Mart. only propounds this doubt, and
says, historia videri possit nonnihil perturbata: the history seems to be
put somewhat out of order; but he gives no solution of this question. 2.
Certain it is, that David parta pace, having obtained peace, Osiand. deuictis
hostibus, and his enemies overcome, Pellic. then did settle himself to reform
religion: and therefore the history is here set down in the right order of
time, howsoever it is reported in the Chronicles. 3. Therefore the best answer
is this, that David had assembled together the chief of Israel twice to this
end, and consulted with them to bring home the Arc: the first time was after
he had surprised and taken the fort of the Iebusites in Jerusalem: which
purpose and consultation of David, was hindered and interrupted by the invasion
of the Philistims; then after David had vanquished them, he called them again,
and therefore it is here said, David gathered together again the chosen men,
etc. Pet. Martyr thinks, they had been assembled together before, to
celebrate the inauguration of David's reign, but rather he had called them
together before to consult about the Arc: Iun. This calling together twice of
the people, is mentioned 1. Chron. 13.1.5. 4. But yet this doubt remains,
because in that place all this rehearsed to be done in this chapter, to v. 10.
is set down before David's battle with the Philistims: whereunto this answer
may be given, that mention being made there of that consultation, which David
had before the Philistims battle, that narration is finished together,
according to the use of Scripture, which more respects the coherence of
argument, then the order of time.

2. Quest. Of David's consulting and gathering together the chief men to bring
again the Arc.
In the Chronicles the certain number is not expressed, how many were gathered
together, but here they are said to be 30. thousand: As here the bounds and
limits of the land are not described, how far and from whence they were
called, as there it is said, that David gathered them together, from Sichar of
Egypt unto the entering in of Hamath, that is, from the South bounds of the land
to the North: Borr. The causes of this great assembly were these. 1. Vt
solenni pompa, etc. that with solemn pomp, and due devotion they might bring
the Arc: Pellic. 2. Vt ad manum haberet paratos milites, that he might have
soldiers ready at hand, if the enemy should have attempted to disturb them:
Osiand. 3. Vt pium and moderatum Principem decuit, etc. as it became a moderate
and godly Prince, he would have the consent of the states and the people: not
like unto the Pope and his Cardinals, and the Papal prelacie, who take upon
them without the advice of the civil state, to innovate and change matters of
religion of their own head: Mart. 4. Rupertus makes this solemn reducing of
the Arc, which was a type of Christ, a type and figure of the solemn
preaching and publishing of the resurrection of Christ by the Apostles through
the world. 5. So the first thoughts and counsel of David, after he was
established, and settled in his kingdom, was to seek after God, and to reform
religion. But in Saul's time they sought not the to Ark of God, 1. Chr. 13.3.
for Saul's head was troubled and busied about the succession of the kingdom,
and the pursuing of David: and in stead of consulting with God at the Arc, he
went unto Witches, which was his ruin. Martyr.

3. Quest. v. 2. Of the place from whence they brought the Arc.
1. The word is mibaghale, which some read, de viris, of the men or Lords of
Judah: Mont. Pagn. whom Osiander follows. 2. But it is rather the name of the
city, which was called Kiriathiearim, or Kiriathbaal, Ios. 15.60. or Baalath,
1. Chron. 15.4. or in the plural number, Baalim, as it is here translated by
Iun. and Vatab. 3. There the ark rested in Kiriathiearim when it returned from
the Philistims, 1. Sam. 7.1. which was at the least 40. years before:
immediately after the death of Eli, after whom succeeded Samuel and Saul, who
governed Israel 40. years, Act. 13.21.

4. Quest. v. 2. Of the meaning of these words, Whereon is called upon the name
of Jehovah.
1. Some do refer these words unto God, reading thus, to fetch from thence
the Ark of God, whose name is called by the name of Jehovah: B.G.V. but it
seems rather to be a description of the Arc, showing the excellency and
dignity of it, that there the Lord was called upon, and from thence gave
answer, and showed there evident signs of his presence. 2. Some do understand
it of the Arc, that it was called by the name of Jehovah: so Pellic. Osiand.
and Pet. Martyr further gives this reason: that the Sacraments do bear the
name of the things, which they signify: as the name of the altar which Moses
made, Exodus 17. was called Jehovah: and so Gedeon called the altar which he
made, Jehovah shalam, Jehovah peace, Judge. 6.24. Borrh. And after the same
manner must the words of our Blessed Savior be understood, this is my body:
the Sacrament is called by the name of the thing. But neither of these two
places are fitly alleged: for the name Jehovah is not simply given unto these
altars, but with some addition: the first is called by Moses, Jehovah missi,
the Lord is my banner: the other by Gedeon is named Jehovah Shalam, Jehovah (is
our) peace. Neither are the words so to be read here. 3. Therefore the better
reading is, at, as Iun. or upon the which (as Sep. Lat.) namely the Ark of God, the name of Jehovah is called upon: there solemnly the name of Jehovah was
invocated: so also read Mont. Page the word kara here used, signifies not
only to call, but also to invoke, and call upon, as Genesis 4.26.

5. Quest. v. 2. How God is said to sit between the Cherubims.
1. Tostatus has this conceit, that the Angel which spoke from between the
Cherubims did assume a certain aerie body, which rested between the
Cherubims: qu. ^2. in c. 25. Exodus
which being imagined, God might be said to sit there, because his Angel in
that assumed body was there present: but here Jehovah is said to sit or dwell
between the Cherubims, which name is never given unto any Angel: it was God
therefore himself, and not an Angel which made his seat there. 2. Some
imagined also, because the Lord is said to sit upon the mercie-seate between
the Cherubims: that the Mercie-seat was not put close upon the Arc, but was
held over it as the throne, and the seat, and the Arc was as the footestoole:
this opinion is elsewhere showed to be without any ground: for the Mercie-seat
served as a covering to the Arc, Hexap. in Exodus c. ^5. qu. 28.
and was put above upon it, Exodus 40.20. 3. God therefore is said to sit
between the Cherubims, because from thence he gave answer, and delivered his
oracles: Vatab. Borrh. as he did to Moses, Numb. 7.89. 4. God was otherwise
there present then he is in the whole world; here was the presence of his
grace, sicut fidelibus sacramentaliter adest, as he is present to the faithful
in the Sacraments: Pellic. 5. As God is said to dwell between the Cherubims:
so Christ is not elsewhere to be sought then in his Church, with the which he
has promised to be present to the end of the world. Borr.

6. Quest. v. 3. Why they put the Ark of God upon a new cart.
1. Pelican thinks that they did this by the appointment of the King
himself, or of the high Priest. But it appears by the punishment inflicted
afterward upon Vzzah, that it was his negligence cheifely and oversight so to
carry the arc. 2. They did thus, as they thought for the more honor and
reverence to the Arc, but it proved otherwise: Borr. whereby we see that many
things may be done of a good intention, and yet not acceptable unto God. 3. It
seems also, that herein they followed the example of the Philistims, who put
the Arc into a new cart: but they should rather have looked unto the law, and
commandment of God, who appointed the Levites to carry it upon their
shoulders: Mart. 4. Like unto these are the Romanists, in these two respects.
1. Because as these imitated the Philistims, so they do borrow many of their
rites and vsages from the Jews, or Gentiles. 2. And as these ease their own
shoulders, and cause the oxen to draw the Arc, so the Popish prelacie do
wind their neck out of the collar, and lay the duties belonging unto them upon
others: as preaching upon their chaplains, their government upon their
chancelors and officials, giving themselves in the mean time to their pleasure
and idleness: Mart. 5. Rupertus by the Arc carried in the cart or charet,
understands the preaching of the Gospel, borne as it were by the four
Evangelists: but this application is not so fit, seeing this carting of the
Arc was taken in evil part, and much displeased God.

7. Quest. v. 4. Whence the Arc was brought, and by whom.
1. It was brought from the house of Abinadab, where it was left, 1. Sam. 7.1.
whose house was in the hill, Iun. Vatab. rather then in Gibeah: for that was in
Benjamin. 2. These two sons of Abinadab, R. Gerson thinks not to have been
Levites: but Josephus opinion is more probable, who thinks that Abinadab was
a Leuite, in whose house the Arc had stayed a long time: lib. de antiq. c. 2
for it is not like, that otherwise his son Eliezer should have been
sanctified before to keep the Arc, 1. Sam. 7.1. and now his two other sons
Ahio and Vzzah suffered to guide it: to whom, as Josephus writes, that care was
committed by the Priests. 3. The Septuag. for Ahio, read his brother: whereas
it is evident out of the text, that those two Vzzah and Ahio were Abinadabs
sons. v. 3. 4. Ahio went before, and Vzzah went behind, though it be not
expressed, as it appears afterward by Vzzahs staying of the Arc with his
hand. Iun.

8. Quest. v. 4. Of the meaning of these words: And they brought it out of the
house of Abinadab, which is in the hill, with the Arc.
1. Vatablus reads, and they brought it, etc. with the Arc, that is the
coffer, wherein the Philistims had put their presents and gifts, which they sent
with the Arc, 1. Sam. 6.8. they brought it together with the Arc. 2. Some
read thus: they brought the Arc out of the house of Abinadab: B.G. but here
some thing is omitted, not translated; as it, and with. 3. Some refer it to
Abinadab, who was in Gibeah keeping the Arc: so the Latin interpreter
expounds, with the Arc, that is, keeping it. 4. Osiander thus interprets:
they brought it, that is, the new cart, with the Arc. 5. The meaning is
rather, that they were with the Ark, that is, did accompany it, Iun. as the
next words show, Ahio went before the Arc.

9. Quest. v. 5. Of David's playing upon instruments of Music before the Lord.
1. The instruments of Music are described by their matter; they were made of
fur tree, some take it for cedar, some for box: the word is berash, which
usually is taken for the fur: V.A.P.I. which is an fit wood to make
instruments of, as is used to this day; the diverse kinds also of these
instruments made of fur are named, as Harpes, Psaltaries, Timbrels. 2. The
people of the East country as they are more ardent in their affections, so
they are more affected with music, then they which inhabit toward the
Northern parts of the world: and therefore to this day, the Christians in
Syria and in other East countries, do celebrate the festival of Christ's
resurrection with harpes and other instruments, with singing also and dancing.
And by the Epistle of Pliny to Traiane the Emperor, it seems that even from
the Apostles times, in sacro vsu habuisse Musicam, that they had a sacred use
of Music, even from the Apostles time. Mar. 3. Beside the custom of the
country, the pedagogie and condition of those times, which was full of types
and shadows, did commend this public use of Music in religion: whereby were
represented, those cantiones spirituales, spiritual songs, and hymns, which
the Apostle speaks of: singing and making melody unto the Lord in your
hearts, Ephesians. 5.13. Borrh. 4. The use of these instruments was, that thereby
mentes arrigerentur, the minds of the hearers might be stirred up to the
praise of God: for otherwise God is not delighted with sounds. Pelican. 5. And
thus far Music also has now a commendable use in the Church of God: si
vtamur ad ipsius laudem, etc. if we use it to Gods praise, and glory, and the
mind and heart sing together with the voice. Osiander.

10. Quest. v. ^. Of the o^casion, which moved Vzzah to stay the Ark^ with his
hand.
1. Because this was a memorable accident, that here fell out, the place is
noted, which had a double name: it is here called the th^eshing floor of
Nachon, which signifies prepared, as Vatablus translateth, arcam paratam, a
threshing floor prepared: because by this example and admonition the L^uites
were as prepared: but 1. Chron. 13. it is named the threshing floor of Chidon:
which some think was so called, because Joshua there lift up his sh^ild or
spear, which is so called chudon, Josh. 8.18. ex Martyr. But it seems that
the owner of this threshing floor rather had these two names, Nachon, and
Chidon, as Araunah whose threshing floor David bought, 2. Sam. 24. was also
called Ornan, 1. Chron. 21.20.

2. The oxen, which drew the ^art, some read exorbitabant, went out of the way:
Joseph. Lat. Osiander. some read, that the oxen fainted as under the burden of
the Ark, because of the reverence, and holiness of it: Vatab: out of a
certain Hebrew writer: some that the o^en stumbled or kicked. P^lli^. But the
word is better translated, they did shake it: B.G. Iun. like to cast and tumble
it down: so the word samat is used, 2. King. 9.33. where Iehu bids them
tumble, or cast down Iezabel.

3. Thus it pleased God by these ^umbe beasts to admonish them of their error:
as the Lord reproved Balaam by opening the mouth of his ass. Mar.

11. Quest. v. 7. Why the Lord smote Vzzah, and how.
1. Some of the Rabbines think that Vzzah was smitten, because when he saw the
Arc declining he had such an inward thought, as though God were not able to
stay it: but no such thing is in the text: Petrus Camest^r gesseth it wa^, for
that he had companied with his wife the night before: which concei^ rises of
their profane and base opinion of marriage, which the Apostle calls
honorable: the cause is evident out of the text, because they had put the Arc
into a ca^t, where^s it was to be carried upon the Levites shoulders: Mar. and
because being no Priest, he touched the Arc, which it was not lawful for the
Levites to do: Osiand. both these causes are rendered of this judgment, the
first 1. Chron. 15.3.14. the other 1. Chron. 13.10.

2. How Vzzah was smitten, it is not expressed: some think he was stricken with
a thunderbolt: Hierome is of opinion, that his shoulder and arm wa^ suddenly
withered and dried up, because he should have borne the Arc upon his shoulder:
De mirabilib. Script. lib. 2. c. 12.
Augustine thinks he was presently suffocated, and so died, as they which are
taken with an apoplexy: but it seems it was a violent death, and that by
some rent, rupture, or division of his body: as the place was thereupon called
Per^z V^zah, the rent, breach, or division of Vzzah.

3. Vzzah is smitten here, whereas the Philistims were not punished at all for
carting the Arc: for they knew not the law of God, and therefore were excused
by their ignorance: but the Israelites, if they transgressed the law, did it of
careless negligence and forgetfulness, as Vzzah here, and therefore this
punishment is laid upon him: Pelican.

4. And Vzzah is smitten rather then Ahio, not as Hierome thinks, if he be
the author of the traditions upon the Chronicles: because Abinadab had Vzzah
carry the Arc upon his shoulders, and he refused: Mar. But though Ahio with
the rest of the Priests and Levites were all guilty of the first fault in
putting the Arc into a cart: yet this fault was peculiar to Vzzah, in that he
presumed to touch the Arc, which it was not lawful for the Levites to do,
Number. 4.11. and therefore he was smitten* and not Ahio. Iun.

12. Quest. v. 7. Of the right use, which is to be made of this judgment upon
Vzzah.
1. The Pope grossly abused this place, against the Emperor, who having made
some constitutions in Germany concerning religion, and namely that of the
interim, was threatened by the Pope with the vengeance that did light upon
Vzzah, for meddling with things that appertained not unto him. But therein the
Emperor did no more then other godly Kings before him, Solomon, Esechias,
Josias, and those Christian Emperors Constantine, Theodosius, Honorius,
Arcadius. Mart.

2. But this example has this application rather. 1. It condemns all
will worship and humane devises brought into the service and worship of God: as
Nadab and Abihu were slain for offering with strange fire. 2. It teaches v^,
ne in alienam functionem nos ingreamus, that we intrude not our selves into an
others function: as Vzzia the King was smitten with leprosy, because he took
upon him to offer incense. Osiander. 3. The Arc also signifies the Scripture,
quae non est illotis manibus tractanda, which must not be handled with unclean
hands. Pelican. 4. It shows also that a good intention, declining from the
prescript of Gods word, is not acceptable to the Lord: Osiander. For Vzzah here
of a good meaning stayed the Arc with his hand, but because it was against the
Law, it displeased the Lord.

13. Quest. Why David was displeased.
1. Whereas the words in the original are, David was angry: or anger was to
David: some take it, that David was angry not with the Lord, for God could not
be accused of injustice here, and it was far from David to lay any such
imputation upon God: but he was angry with the negligence of the Priests, and
his own oversight, in such an apparent transgression of the Law: Mart. 2. But
the text giving this reason, because the Lord has smitten Vzzah; shows that
this indeed was the cause of David's grief: therefore the meaning is, that
displicuit Dauidi, it displeased David: I.G.B. or David was moved and
troubled, as Samuel was moved, when the Lord had cast off Saul, and cried unto
the Lord all night, 1. Sam. 15.11. where the same phrase is used. 3. As David
was moved and troubled, so it is said, David feared the Lord that day: which
both shows, that David setting before him the like punishment upon the
Philistims first, then upon the Bethshemites for their irreuerent behavior
toward the Arc, feared the like punishment himself, and therefore durst go
no further with the Arc: Mart. And beside it made David more careful
afterward, nihil tentare praeter doctrinam legis, to attempt nothing beside the
doctrine of the Law. Pelican.

14. Quest. Whether David did well in going no further with the Arc.
1. Some think that David was herein ouerseene; and though he were an holy man,
yet he was not without his faults; for if he were assured that it was the Lords
will to bring the Arc to Jerusalem, he should not have given over
notwithstanding this cross success: and if he were not, he should never have
begun, and taken it in hand: Mart. 2. To the same purpose Osiander, that
David exceeded a due measure in this his fear, in that he sends away the
Arc from him: as many now a days, because they think themselves unworthy to
receive the Sacrament, do along time forbear, and will not receive it at all.
3. But David herein rather obeyed, as it seemed to him the Lords will, which
he might think, was not at this time that the Arc should be brought to his
house, as was declared by this fact: Iun. so aguoscit se indignum, etc. he
acknowledges himself unworthy, with whom the Arc, which was the seat of
God, should remain and dwell. Pellic.

15. Quest. v. 10. Of the leaving of the Arc in the house of Obed Edom the
Gittite.
1. The most do think, that this Obed Edom is called a Gethite or Gittite,
because he had sometime soiourned with David, or upon some other occasion in
Gath a city of the Philistims: Pellic. Vatab. and it might be he fled thither,
when Saul put the Priests to death: Mart. But he was so called of Gath Rimman,
one of the cities given in common by the tribe of Manasses, and of Dan to the
Kohathites the Leuits, Josh. 21.24. Iun. 2. And with him the Arc is left, not
that David forced him to take the Arc, and so would turn the danger upon an
other, which he feared. But it seems rather, that Obededom dwelling in the
way, and being a good man, and also a Leuite, that he was willing to give
entertainment unto the Arc: Osiand. Martyr. Rupertus thinks that David as
yet knew not the cause, why the Lord smote Vzzah; but that is not like, for it
appears by David's fear, saying, how shall the Ark of the Lord come unto me,
that he knew well, that Vzzah was smitten for some fault committed about the
Arc.

16. Quest. v. 12. What moved David to bring the Arc from the house of
Obededom.
1. God had blessed the house of Obededom and all that he had, because of the
presence of the Arc, which he used with great reverence: no such thing is
expressed of Abinadab, in whose house the Arc was many years, either because
it is omitted in Scripture, as many things of fact are: or it may be the Arc
was not with like reverence there entertained. Mart.

2. This was a great alteration and change, that whereas the Lord punished
before, he now blesses: but this change was not in God, who is immutable and
alwaie the same, but in them that carried themselves diuersely toward the
Lord's ark: Vzzah was punished for his want of reverence, Obededom is rewarded
for his obedience.

3. Thus the Lord honors those that honor him, and his servants for his
sake: Laban was blessed after Iaacobs coming unto him; and Potiphar because of
Joseph.

4. David therefore hearing the report of Obededoms prosperity, now seeing all
fear of danger past, takes unto him a good heart, and resolves to remove
the arc: Osiand. Likewise though God be not to be served, or his presence to
be desired for any earthly blessings; yet the Lord propounds such temporal
rewards to stir up our dulnes: and David is the rather moved in this behalf
to bring the Arc home unto him, that these outward things might be testimonia
quaedam voluntatis Dei, etc. certain testimonies of the will of God toward him:
Mar. But the chief reason which moved David to remove the Arc, was because
now hearing of Obededom his welfare and prosperity by entertaining the Arc,
nihil mali veritus, he feared no further evil or danger: Joseph. l. 7. c. 4.

17. Quest. v. 16. Why they sacrificed, when they had gone six paces.
1. The Rabbines think, that they sacrifice now at six paces, because Vzzah
was smitten, when they had gone six paces: but whether that were so or not, as
soon as they set forward and perceived, that God was present with them, and
none of them were smitten, they offered sacrifice in sign of thanksgiving.
Pelican. 2. Some of the Hebrews think, that the Levites felt not the Arc
heavy as they did bear it, and therefore being moved with this miracle they
sacrificed: but it is dangerous devising miracles without Scripture. 3. It is
most like that he which was set over the Levites, who carried the Arc by
turns, appointed them their stations, how far the parties or bearers should
go before they rested, which was six paces: therefore it is said, 1. Chron.
15.26. when the Lord eased and helped the Levites, that is, when they rested
them, at the appointment of Chenamah, who was set over them, 1. Chron. 15.22.
then they offered sacrifice. 4. And, they offered these sacrifices upon some
Altar made upon the sudden, either of earth, or of rough stone according to
the law, Exodus 20.24. Iun. 5. The cause why none of them were now smitten was,
for that the former fault and oversight was redressed, the Levites now did
bear the Arc upon their shoulders according to the Law, 1. Cor. 15.14.

18. Quest. v. 13. How many bullockes and fat beasts they offered.
Here the text says they offered a bullock and a fat beast, that is, but one:
but 1. Chron. 15.26. it is said they offered seven bullockes, and seven
rams. 1. Some to reconcile these places think, Reconcil.
that the Priests offered these seven bullockes and seven rams, beside the
bullock and fat beast, which David offered: Genevens. annot. 1. Chron. 15.26.
but the same offering is spoken of in both places, because the same occasion is
touched, when the Levites rested, and had gone six paces. 2. Iunius reads
here in the plural, they offered bullockes and fat beasts: and so it may agree
with the other number of seven bullocks, and seven rams: but seeing the
words are here put in the singular number, they are not fitly translated in the
plural, there being no such necessity. 3. I approve rather Osianders
solution: who thinks that there were certain stations, which are called
paces, at the end of six of them the Levites set down the Arc, and others
carried in their place: and at the end of every six of these stations, they
offered a bullock, and a ram: and this they did seven times till they came
to the City of David: So in all at these seven several times they offered
seven bullockes, and seven other fat beasts, that is rams; for at every six
spaces or stations end, they offered a bullock, and an other beast.

19. Quest. v. 14. Of David's daunsing.
1. It was the custom and use of the servants of God, when they would show
their exceeding joy, to express the same with their outward gesture, and that
with daunsing: as Elias, when the rain came, that had been restrained three
year and six months, 1. King. 18 46.
did gird up his loins, the Spirit of God being upon him, and ran before
Ahabs chariot. 2. But whereas there are diverse kinds of daunsing; as there is
a grave motion of the body, which sometime is used by the Ancient: and there
is a wanton and light kind of daunsing: this gesture, which David used in
leaping and stirring his body, was of the first sort. 3. Beside, his example
was extraordinary: for otherwise it might have seemed not befitting the person
of a King to dance in public view, and sight: as Nero and Caligula among the
Romans, were blamed of all for dancing publicly in the theater, being
Emperors: when Kings and public persons are moved by the like spirit, they
may do as David did: otherwise they must vsitata ratione Deum colere: worship
God after the usual, and ordinary manner. Mar.

20. Quest. v. 14. Of the linen Ephod, that David was girded with.
1. Osiander thinks, that David was so addicted to the service of God, that
he put on a preistly garment: he takes it to be such a linen Ephod, as the
inferior priests used to wear: as 1. Sam. 21.18. But David having been so
lately taught by Vzzahs presumption, who being but a Leuite meddled with the
priests office, in touching the Arc, would not adventure to were those
garments which were peculiar unto priests. 2. Neither yet was it a mere civil
garment, such as they which are priests or Levites did sometime wear, honoris
causa, for honor sake: Borrh. for David as it were abasing and humbling
himself in the sight of God, as he says, v. 22. I will yet be more vile then
thus, did lay aside in all likelihood his garments of honor and state. 3. I
think it therefore more probable, that it was neither a preistly garment, nor
yet altogether civil or profane: but such as vulgus Deo deuoturum, they which
were devoted unto God, though they were neither Levites, nor priests, did use
in the service of God, and religious actions: See more of the Ephod, 1. Sam. c.
2. qu. 5. and c. 22. qu. 13. So David here did not show himself as a Priest,
as they say Charles the 5. in his solemn inauguratio^ at Bononia did put on a
linen vesture to please the Papal society, as though he were consecrated one
of their priests: but he put it on not only to be the lighter, and to dance
the more nimbly, Mart. but to show his devotion. 4. Yet did he not strippe
himself of his princely robes, as thinks Mart. as Saul was naked before the
Prophets, that is, having laid aside his princely robes: for under the linen
Ephod, he had a silk cloak or robe; for so it is said, that he had a silk
robe, and then upon that a linen Ephod, 1. Chron. 15.17. Some do there read in
the first place a linen garment, as Vatab. Genevens. but the word is butz,
which signifies silk, and the other bar, linen: he had therefore a long silk
robe, and upon that a linen Ephod, which was girt unto him, and kept the other
garment cloase from flying abroad. Osiand. annot. 1. Chron. 15.

21. Quest. v. 17. Of the Tabernacle where David placed the Arc.
1. This was not the Tabernacle, which Moses had made, where the Altar of
burnt-offering was; for that was now at Gibeon, 1. Chron. 22.29. but it was a
Tabernacle, which David had prepared of purpose for the Arc, before he brought
it thither, 1. Chron. 15.1. Mar. Borrh. 2. Peter Martyr doubts whether the
great Tabernacle at this time in Gibeon, were the same which Moses had set up
200. year before (yea 400. year) in the desert: but it is evident 1. Chron.
21.29. that it was the same Tabernacle, which Moses had made in the
wilderness: which might notwithstanding be repaired, and renewed, as there was
need. 3. David makes a Tabernacle for the Arc, rather then any permanent
building, because he had now set it down in his mind to build the Lord an
house, which was afterward performed by Solomon. Mar.

22. Quest. v. 18. Of David's blessing the people.
1. Though it be not like, that David here, and Solomon who blessed the people
also at the consecration of the Temple, used that form of blessing, which is
prescribed, Numb. 6.24. The Lord bless thee, and keep thee, which only was
appointed for the Priests to use: yet David after some other holy manner
blessed the people, and wished well unto them. 2. And he does not only wish
well unto them in words, but performs the same also unto them in deeds;
making a feast unto all the people, he gave unto every one, a cake of bread,
and a piece of flesh, and a bottle of wine: Josephus omitteth the wine, and
speaks of a wafer cake, beside the bread, that should be given unto every
one: but the text is of more credit with us. 3. David did not show such bounty
when he was confirmed in the kingdom by the people, c. 5. to show that he more
rejoiced in the true worship of God, then in the honor of his kingdom: Mart.
4. David here executes part of the preistly, part of the princely office: he
blesses as a Priest, and gives bountifully to the people as a King. So
Melchisedech both blessed Abraham, and brought forth bread and wine unto him:
herein then David was a type and figure of the Messiah, both king and priest,
after the order of Melchisedech. Borrh.

23. Quest. v. 20. Of Michols deriding of David.
1. Michol who should have met the King her husband, as the part of kind and
dutiful wives is, with amiable salutations, does at the very first show her
scornful heart toward him. Osiand. Josephus thinks that she commended all
other things, but only finds fault with him for his dancing: but the text
makes mention only of her words of reproach, not of any commendation at all:
It seems rather, that she which scorned him before in her heart looking out
at a window, v. 16. could not contain her self, but must needs go forth to
meet him to tell him her mind. Mart. And whereas David came to bless his
house, she through her foolishnes turns his blessing into a curse. Borrh.

2. She is called the daughter of Saul, because indeed herein, refert ingenium
patris, she did show the quality of her father. Iun. he was an hypocrite, and
vain glorious, and sought only the praise of men: whereas David refers all
unto Gods glory: Pelican. yet in the mean time she forgets, how her
father Saul had in like sort behaved himself among the prophets, prophesying
naked, that is, without his princely robes before them, 1. Sam. 19.24. Mar.

3. There are three parts of Michols scornful reprehension, 1. because he had
forgotten himself that day, not retaining his princely dignity: and therefore
she taunteth him with an ironicall speech: how glorious was the King of Israel
this day? 2. Because he had uncovered himself in the eyes of the handmaides:
not that either of purpose David showed his bare and naked body in dancing,
being very bewtifull, as some think: or that his bare flesh was seen,
vestibus ex tripudio diffluentibus, his garments in dancing flying abroad,
Osiander, so also Josephus: but for that he had showed light behavior, not
beseeming the gravity of a King, in so much, that the very maids scorned him,
and made jests of him. 3. Because he had so carried himself, that there was
small difference between him, and a fool, that leapeth and daunceth up and
down, or like unto some vile person, that will be hired for a little to leap
and skippe to move sport. Mar.

4. After this manner deal the carnal men of this world, which hold the zeal
of Gods servants to be but foolishness: Borrh. and the pompous prelates and
Abbots of the Romanists, which ride upon their mules, being accompanied and
attended upon as Princes, do upon the like ground, despise the poverty and
simplicity of the ministers of the Gospel: Mart.

24. Q^est. v. 23. Of David's defense and answer unto Michol.
1. Michol at once committed a treble fault, she derided David, being both
king, and a Prophet, and her husband: and her reproachful speech redounded to
the dishonor of God, and therefore David justified that which he had done:
Mar. 2. David's defense consists of these three parts: for as Michol had
objected three things, vncomelines in not behauing himself as a King, that he
had exposed himself to the scorn of the maids, and made himself equal unto
vile and base fellows: David answers unto every part, 1. He did this before
the Lord, before whom Kings are as other men: and therefore it was no dishonor
unto him, so to abase himself in the presence of the King of kings. 2.
Remembering the mercy which he had received of the Lord, in preferring him
before Saul and his house, he could not show himself too vile and low in his
own eyes, to testify his thankfulness unto God. Osiander. 3. And he would
still more humble himself, and by this means he should be honored not only
of the maids, from among whom he afterward took wives and concubines: Osiand.
but of all the Israelites, whom she called his servants, even with them,
ghimmam, which being in the masculine, must be referred to the men, not to the
women: Iun. yea not only of Israel, but of all other nations shall I be had in
honor: Pelican. according to that saying, 1. Sam. 2.30. them that honor me,
will I honor. Iun. 3. Thus our Blessed Savior being derided and scorned upon
the cross, was more exalted in his glorious resurrection. And when Theodosius
the Emperor laying aside his Imperial majesty, submitted himself to public
penance, though he might for the present be derided, yet to this day is more
honored. In like manner the servants of God, that are despised in this world,
shall receive honor and praise of God, in that day, in despite of all those,
which before scorned, and derided them.

25. Quest. v. 23. Of Michols punishment for deriding David, she had no child
unto the day of her death.
1. Some Hebrews think, that she had a child at the time of her death, and
died thereof, as Rachel did, and as the wife of Phinehes the son of Heli: But
this phrase until the day of her death, is as much in effect as never, and it
puts in a perpetual bar: as 1. Sam. 15.35. it is said, Samuel came no
more to see Saul, till the day of his death, that is, never.

2. Some thus understand this place, that from this time, wherein she showed
such contempt, she had never after any children; but before she might have: for
they suppose that this Michol is the same, which is called Eglah, c. 3.5. whose
son by David was Ithream: Borrh. but that Eglah and Michol were not the same,
as is showed before, cap. 3. qu. 4.

3. Josephus says, that Michol had five sons before by an other man, but
none by David: but those five sons said to be Michols, were not hers but her
sister Merabs: who, and not Michol, was married to Adriel; for Michol was given
unto Phaltiel: therefore where it is said, the five sons of Michol, etc.
which she bare to Adriel: there must be supplied, the Sister of Michol, as
shall be showed in that place.

4. Therefore it is better understood according to the use of the phrase, that
perpetuae sterilitatis opprobrio affecta est, she was opprobrious for her
perpetual barrennes: Iun. so they which deride the Church of God, shall be for
ever barren and fruitless of any good work.

CHAP. 7.
1. Quest. v. 1. How David is said to have rest round about from all his
enemies.
David had many battles with the Moabites and Ammonites, and with other foreign
nations, as is expressed c. 8. c. 10. and in other places. 1. Therefore some
do expound these-words of the peace and rest, which David now presently
enjoyed: so Osiander says, that at this time, magna tranquillitate respublica
Israelitica fruebatur, the Commonwealth of Israel enjoyed great tranquillity.
2. Some do refer it to David's peaceable possession of the kingdom, wherein
he was now established without any resistance. Pelican. 3. But D. Chimhi
better understands this rest, from those wars which the enemies provoked
David unto: the battles which David afterward fought, he rather made with his
enemies, oblata diuinitus occasion, as God gave occasion: they did not provoke
him. Borrh. Mart.

2. Quest. v. 2. Of David's purpose to build God an house.
1. David knew well enough, that God dwelled not in houses made with hands,
neither that any Temple could be made to comprehend his majesty: yet because
the Arc was a visible symbol of Gods presence, he thought, that the reverent
entertainment thereof tended to Gods honor. 2. And this desire of David, as
all other good thoughts and purposes proceeded from the spirit of God:
Pelican. only David's oversight was this, because he would run before the
Lords commandment. Mart. 3. Yet this worthy lesson is learned from David,
that men should not be more addicted to the setting forth of their own pomp,
and garnishing of their own houses, and in the mean time neglect the place of
Gods service: as the Prophet Hagge reprooueth the Jews, because they
themselves dwelled in sicled houses, Hagg 3.4.
and suffered the house of God to lie wast. 4. David also in not resting upon
his own counsel, though he were a wise and holy man, but took counsel with
Nathan the Prophet, therein is an example unto Princes and Magistrates, to
consult and advise with wise and religious men. Mar.

3. Quest. v. 3. How Nathan was deceived in approouing David's purpose.
1. D. Chimhi thinks, that David dealt with Nathan, as the Lords Prophet, and
would have him ask counsel of God for him: but it seems rather, as Lyranus
thinks, that he consulted privately with him, as his friend, and an holy man:
for otherwise he would not have given him this present answer, if he had
purposed to ask counsel of God for him. 2. Therefore David only in familiar
manner consulting with him, Nathan makes him an answer, not as a Prophet, but
as one giving private advise: for the Prophets had not always the spirit of
prophecy upon them, but spoke sometime as private men: as Samuel, when Eliab
David's eldest brother came before him, thought at the first, that he was the
Lords anointed: So Elisha said, when the Shunamite lay at his feet, being
grieved for the death of her son, 2. King 4.24.
The Lord has hid it from me, and has not told me, etc. 3. Nathan was herein
deceived, because he saw that God was with David, that therefore he could not
be deceived: he reasons, as they say in Schools, a dicto secundum quid, ad
simpliciter, because God was with him at this time, and prospered him in some
things, therefore he was with him in all. Mart. 4. This teaches us, that we
should not ascribe too much to the worthiness, or dignity of any, as though
they could not err; as here Nathan seems to be persuaded of David.

4. Quest. v. 5. How God notwithstanding David's vow, will not have him build
him an house.
1. David, as here he consulteth with Nathan about building of God an house, so
he earnestly vowed the same: as Psalm. 132.2. it is said, He swear unto the
Lord, and vowed to the mighty God of Jacob: I will not enter into the
Tabernacle of mine house, etc. nor suffer mine eyes to sleep, etc. until I
find out a place for the Lord: this vow some think, that David made after the
great plague, when he offered sacrifice unto God in the threshing floor of
Arauna: but it is not like that David would make such a vow, the Lord having
signified what his will was therein before by the Prophet Nathan: it seems
therefore, that at this time he bound himself by that vow. Mart. 2. And
whereas David voweth, that he will not sleep nor climb up into his bed, till
he had found out a place for the Lords house; the meaning is not, that David
would always think of it, and have it in mind; for otherwise his natural
infirmity and frailnesse could not so long endure without sleep and rest:
Mart. But he voweth that he will not take possession of his new habitation, and
dwelling place, which he had made, until he had found out an house for the
Lord: Iun. 3. But notwithstanding this vow, the Lord forbids David to go
forward in this purpose: he therefore reuoketh and reuerseth his vow: Controv.
Whether rash vows may be broken.
for if the father may call back the vow of his daughter, and the husband of
the wife, Numb. 30. much more may the Lord dispense with the vows of his
servants, which are rashly, or unadvisedly made: therefore we hold, that all
rash vows, as of single life, voluntary poverty, and such like, which are
made without warrant of Gods word, by the authority of the same word may be
reuersed: as God here does rebuke the hasty vow of David.

5. Quest. Wherefore the Lord would not have David build him an house, v. 6.
1. The first reason which the Lord uses, is in respect of himself, that he
had dwelt in no house since he brought Israel out of Egypt, and yet he was
present with Israel, and contented himself to dwell in tents; he was all this
while notwithstanding their Almighty God: therefore in respect of himself,
there was no cause why David should be so careful to make God an house.

2. Again, in respect of David himself there was just cause, seeing there
were many Princes and Governors before him, unto whom the Lord gave no such
commandment, neither was he angry with them for not building the Lord an
house: David therefore should not think, that it concerned him more, then any
of the rest, which went before him.

3. An other reason is yielded by Solomon, 1. King. 5.3. why it pleased not
God, that David should build him an house, because he had war with the
nations round about, and therefore he had no leisure nor opportunity to
enterprise such a great work.

4. And beside, David himself shows that the Lord forbad him to build him an
house, because he was a man of war, and had shed blood, 1. Chron. 28.3. not
as though it had been unlawful for David to fight the Lords battles, or that
he had been defiled therewith: but because the building of the Temple, was a
type of the spiritual building of the Church by Christ, the Prince of peace,
it was requisite, that the Temple should be built by peaceable Solomon, that
the figure and shadow might be correspondent to the body.

5. But this was no cause, as the Romanists imagine, because David by shedding
of blood, and waging of battle, became irregular: for then many of their
Popes, which have been warriers and warlike men, should have been irregular;
yea, and many of the founders of their Abbyes, which had been murderers,
should have much more incurred the same censure; for David's wars were just,
but they killed unjustly. Mar.

6. But in that God would not suffer David to build him an house, we see that
ceremonies are of no virtue or force, but as they have their strength from the
word of God: and therefore Jeremy reprooueth the hypocrites of his time, for
having such confidence in the material Temple: who thought whatsoever sins
they were guilty of, that they were delivered in coming to the Temple, Ierem.
7.10. Mart.

6. Quest. Whether David's desire to build God an house, were simply in it self
acceptable.
1. That David did well therein, and that the Lord was well pleased with his
intent and purpose, Solomon shows, 1. King. 8.18. so that generally in it
self it was a good purpose and desire: but yet failed herein, because he had
no particular direction from Gods word to do it: for God may approve some
acts, which notwithstanding he will not have done at all times and seasons.

2. True it is, that the Lord purposed to have an house built, as is evident,
Deuteronomy. 12.11. but the circumstance of time, and place, being not expressed,
they were to wait for further direction and warrant from God: for it is not in
these ceremonial precepts, as in moral; for where any moral precept is
generally propounded, it must be executed without expecting any other
commandment; as the Apostle says, Philip. 4.8. Whatsoever things are true,
whatsoeur things are honest, whatsoever things are just, etc. think of these
things: but ceremonies and sacraments, must have a particular institution from
God: of which kind the building of the temple was.

3. And though David here be inhibited to build Gods house, yet the Jews in
Haggies time were worthily reproved for their negligence therein: not that God
is contrary to himself, in forbidding and commanding the same thing: but the
reason of the difference is, because David had no word of God to warrant this
enterprise: but the Jews were commanded by the Prophets, and so had the word
of God, which they stubburnely disobeyed.

7. Quest. v. 7. Whether these words are well translated, spoke I one word with
any of the tribes?
1. Most of the Interpreters so translate the word shibtez, tribes, as S.L.C.V.
with the rest. 2. But it is better translated by a Synecdoche, Judges, or
governors: the word properly signifies, scepters: where the scepter being an
adiunct of the government* is taken for the governors themselves: Iun. And
that this reading is best, these reasons may show: because it is so expounded,
1. Chron. 17.6. where this place is rehearsed thus, spoke I one word to any of
the Judges of Israel* etc. 2. And beside, the words following here confirm the
same sense, whom I commanded to feed my people: but they were the Judges, not
the tribes, whom the Lord commanded so to do. 3. v. 11. the Lord also says,
since the time that I commanded Judges over my people. 4. And there is great
affinity and similitude in the words, between shibtee, and shophtee.

8. Quest. v. 8. Why the Lord makes mention, that he took David from the
sheepcoate.
The Lord to a diverse end remembers this here, then afterward, when he had
committed that sin in the matter of Vriah: where the Lord rehearsing the
benefits which he had done for him, as how he had anointed him King over
Israel, and delivered him out of the hand of Saul, c. 12.7. vpbraideth David
for his unthankfulness. But here, 1. the Lord by putting David in mind of
these benefits, he thereby does encourage him, not to think that this
inhibition to go forward in his purpose to build God an house, proceeded from
any disfavor, seeing he had heaped so many blessings upon him: but that the
Lord had another meaning in it. Mart. Osiand. 2. And beside, hereby the Lord
does still keep him in hope, that he will have an house built, though not by
him, nor at that time. Borrh. 3. And the Lord here also to this end makes a
rehearsal, and commemoration of these benefits, therein commending and setting
forth David's thankfulness, that in a thankful remembrance thereof, would
have erected an house unto the Lord: placet Dauidis institutum and gratitudo;
David's purpose and thankfulness, is pleasing unto God. 4. And the Lord by
rehearsing how David was called to the place of government, says thus much in
effect unto him: reliquam partem officij exequere, execute the other part of
thy office, Iun. thou have other matters of the kingdom wherein thou may
occupy thy self, be secure for this.

5. Four benefits the Lord rehearses, which he had done for David: 1. his
exaltation from so low and mean an estate: 2. Gods continual assistance, as
when he encountered Goliath, went against the Philistims, and took 200. of
their foreskinnes. 3. God destroyed all his enemies, as Saul, Doeg, and the
rest. 4. And made his name famous, and renowned all abroad. And therefore as
God had hitherto blessed him, so he would not leave him: he should not then
think, that the Lord had refused him in this work, as though his favor were
changed toward him. Mart.

9. Quest. v. 10. How the Lord is said to plant his people now, which was done
long before.
1. Some think that this promise for David's sake was peculiarly made to
Jerusalem, but the text is evident, that the Lord intends this blessing here
promised to all the people of Israel. 2. And whereas the Lord had planted them
before in the land of Canaan, D. Chimhi understands this promise of the
increase of those former blessings, that the land should be blessed with
greater fruitfulnes, and the kingdom with a more sure estate, then before. 3.
This planting of the people here spoken of, has relation also unto the Temple,
which the Lord would cause to be built in a sure place. Osiand. 4. And whereas
the people after this were afflicted of the Aramites, the Assyrians, Egyptians,
Chaldeans, by whom they were carried into captivity: this promise must both
be understood by way of comparison, that yet they endured not such afflictions
and captivity, as in Egypt, and in the time of the Judges. And these promises
have a condition included, that if they continued in obedience, and kept the
law of God, they should enjoy these promises; otherwise the Lord does not so
bind himself, as to stop the course of justice. Mart. 5. And whereas it will
be objected, that in the days of Ehud one of the Judges, the land had rest 80.
years, which may be compared for length with the peaceable years under David
and Solomon: Judge. 3.30.
it may be answered, that yet those days are not to be compared with David's
times: for under the Judges, the Cananites still dwelt among the Israelites, so
that their peace was not perfect: whereas they were expelled and finally
vanquished by David and Solomon. 6. But these blessings in part fulfilled in
David and Salomons reign, yet have their full accomplishment spiritually in
the Messiah. Borr.

10. Quest. v. 11. How the Lord is said to make David an house.
1. The Hebrew phrase, to make an house, is to give one issue and posterity:
and so the meaning is, that the Lord would give unto David a succeeding
posterity, and an enduring family, which should possess the kingdom after
him. Vatab. 2. This privilege was not granted to any of the Judges, nor unto
Saul: the Kings of Israel after the kingdom was divided, had some of them a
succession in their posterity, but it continued not long. Among the Roman
Emperors from Julius Caesar to Antoninus, none of them left a son to succeed
in the Empire. Vespasian had two sons, Titus, and Domitian, which were
Emperors after him, but they could not leave it to their sons. 3. The Turks
have had a succession in one family above 250. years, but it is by parricide
and cruelty, the father kills the sons, one brother an other: but David's
kingdom continued 400. years, in a lawful government. Mart.

11. Quest. v. 12. What seed the Lord speaks of, when he says, I will set
up thy seed after thee, etc.
1. Some think, that this promise of the perpetuity of David's kingdom, is
wholly to be applied v40^ the Messiah, and not at all unto Solomon. As
Augustine would persuade by these reasons: because the Lord promises that his
kingdom should be for ever, Lib. 18. de ciuit. Dei. c. 10.
so was not Salomons: and that he should have domum fidelem, a faithful house,
which Solomon had not: for he brought strange women, and idolatry with them
unto his house. Lib. 3. in Luke
Ambrose adds further, that Solomon was anointed King, his father yet living,
whereas the Lord speaks of David's seed, which he would set up after him.
Contra. 1. The eternity of this kingdom was indeed fulfilled in Christ: but
yet the other may be, and are understood of Solomon. 2. By a faithful house,
is meant a sure and stable house: for the word neman, signifies both. 3.
Though Solomon were anointed King, while his father lived, yet he was only
appointed then to succeed his father in the kingdom, the government was still
in David while he lived.

2. The Jews do also understand this prophecy of the Messiah, that he should
build a material Temple, which should continue for ever: but of Christ they
say it can not be meant, for he built no Temple. Contra. As though there is no
other Temple, but that which is made of lime and stones? Christ has built unto
the Lord a spiritual house, the Catholic Church: and so is house taken in
Scripture, for a spiritual building: as when the Scripture makes mention of
the house of Abraham, Isaak, and Jacob, they are not so blind and absurd, as to
understand it of an external house.

3. Some again mislike, that this should at all be applied to the Messiah,
obiecting, that when we can not otherwise interpret a place, we run into
allegories. But as allegories devised of man, are uncertain, and prove not:
so yet such allegories as are warranted by the Scripture, do make evident
demonstration: as that of Jonas, being three days in the belly of the Whale:
and that allegory of the free woman, and bondwoman, Gal. 4. So likewise this
place the Scripture it self interprets of Christ, as Hebr. 1.5. I will be
his father, and he shall be my son: these words by the Apostle ar^ properly
applied unto Christ.

4. Wherefore the safer way, is both to retain an historical sense, in
ascribing unto Solomon these things, which agree unto him: and unto Christ,
that which cannot be given unto any mortal man: as that his kingdom shall be
for ever, that God will be his father, that his dominion shall be to the ends
of the world, that kings shall worship him, Psalm. 72.

5. But some things here spoken of, can by no means be referred unto Christ:
as these words, v. 14. If he sin, I will chasten him with the rod of men:
which some notwithstanding would thus apply unto Christ: he is said to sin,
because our iniquities were laid upon him, tanquam ipse inique egisset, as
though he had done evil himself: Osiand. or because whatsoever is in the
members, videri possunt aliquo modo pertinere ad caput, may seem to belong to
the head: Mart. And Solomon they say was not thus chastised, because he had a
flourishing kingdom.

Contra. 1. Though Christ bare our sins, and took upon him our
transgressions, and paid the punishment thereof, even as his righte^usnesse is
imputed to us: yet the action of sin which is personal, can no ways be
imputed unto Christ; as to say he in any sense sinned, Borrh. 2. The beginning
and former part in deed of Salomons kingdom, was glorious and prosperous: but
the Lord raised him up enemies in the end of his days, so that he was
chastised then with the rods of men: as Hadad the Edomite, and R^zan, and
Jeroboam, 1. King. 12. 3. And that these words are literally and historically
understood of the children of God, and not of the blessed Messiah, is evident,
Psalm. 89.31. If they break my statut^s, and keep not my commandments, etc.
then will I visit their transgression with the rod, etc. yet my loving
kindness, will I not take from him.

12. Quest. v. 33. How Christ's kingdom is said to be for ever.
But the Apostle says, that Christ shall deliver up the kingdom unto his
father, when he has put down all rule: how then is Christ's kingdom said to
be for ever? 1. This must be understood, of the oeconomicall kingdom of
Christ, which is committed unto him, as the Messiah; as in subduing the enemies
of his Church, in making intercession for his servants, and in perfitting his
members: this kingdom he shall in this behalf resign unto God: for when his
mystical body is perfected, and there are no enemies lest to be subdued and
conquered, there shall be no longer any use of that kingdom: Iun. 2. Like as
te^rene kings ^re appointed to punish evil doers, and to keep the people in
order: but when there shall be no more ^uill, nor disorder, as in the kingdom
of God, there shall be no more use of any such kings: So the kingdom of Christ
in respect of such administ^a^ion shall cease, quoad effectum and fructum
regnandi, non habet finem: but in regard of the effect and f^ult of his
kingdom it shall have no end* Mart. 3. Christ then as he is God, shall reign
for ever with his father: and his humane nature shall for ever possess that
glory and majesty, which by virtue of that blessed union belong^th (...) it:
but that execution and administration of his Mediatorship, in perfitting his
members, and confounding his enemies shall cease.

13. Quest. v. 17. According to all these words spoke Nathan: why Nathan was
s^nt to David, h^ himself being a Prophet and of Nathans faithfulness.
1. Though David himself were a great Prophet, and had received most clear
revelations from God touching the Messiah, yet it pleased God to direct him in
a matter of less moment concerning the building of the material Temple by
another Prophet; which the Lord does to this end, to show what conjunction
the Lord would have between the members of his Church, and a mutual use and
communication of their gifts: as S. Paul at large shows by that similitude of
the members of the body, how one ministers to the necessity of an other, 1.
Cor. 12.

2. And Nathan herein shows his faithfulness, and humility, that though he
had otherwise advised David before, yet now having received other direction
from God, he reuerseth his former sentence: the like did Esaias the Prophet,
who having first told Hezekiah, that he must die, yet being so commanded of
God, brought him presently a contrary message, that the Lord had prolonged his
days 15. years. But Jonas was much grieved, and had rather die, then that his
threats against Nineveh should not have taken place.

3. David's prudencie also is here commended, who, as many carnal men would
have been ready to object, does not charge the Prophet with mutabilitie and
inconstancy, in saying, and unsaying: But knowing that this alteration came of
God, he does as willingly hear him now, as he did before: Mart.

14. Quest. v. 18. How David is said to have sit before the Lord.
1. Some do so understand it, as though David did sit down and rest himself
before the Arc: which they would have a type of Christ's sitting at the right
hand of God: Borr. The like use they had in time past, not to bow the knee
b^tweene the Pasch and Pentecost, to signify that Christ was ascended into
heaven: Mar. but this was somewhat curious. 2. Some think that this gesture
betokened a quiet mind in David, and prepared for attention: for sometime the
prostrating or standing of the body does disturb the mind: Mart. 3. Vatablus
thinks that this was the privilege of Kings, that they might pray before the
Lord sitting. 4. Pelican notes, that the gesture of the body in prayer is
indifferent: sometime David praised God dancing, sometime lying in his bed,
sometime kneeling: there by showing, that it is the spirit which prays, God
regards not the position and site of the body. 5. But the best sense here
is, that David did sit, that is, remain before God, Geneuens. Iun. Osiand. for
he continued a long time in this his prayer in the Tabernacle before the Arc:
for concerning the gesture of his body, Josephus thinks he fell down flat
before the Arc.

15. Quest. v. 19. Of the meaning of these words, This is the Law of man Lord
God.
1. Some understand it thus, this is the law of man, that is, this is the
chief happiness of man in this life, and the chief scope that every one
aims at to live in prosperous state himself, and to provide also for his
posterity: for David had said immediately before, thou have spoken of thy
servants house for a great ^hile: Bor. But David did not rest in these
temporal blessings, he looked further.

2. Chimhi by law, understands condition, or disposition: as if he should
have said; this is the condition of great men in this world, to have their
honor and prosperity settled in their posterity: and so he expounds it by
that place, 1. Chron. 17.17. Thou have regarded me according to the state of an
excellent man, or of high desire: so also Vatab. But as is showed before, David
looked higher then unto these temporal and terrene blessings.

3. R. Salom. reads it with an interrogation, is this the law and condition
of man, that thou should so much respect them? so also read B.G. does this
appertain to man? and they make this the sense: this comes of thy free
mercy, not of any worthiness in man: Genevens.

4. Pelican also reads it with an interrogation, expounding it thus, non hoc
humanum, sed diuinum beneficium: this is no humane, but a divine benefit, in
that thou have promised, that all nations shall be blessed in my seed.

5. Iunius interprets, ratione humana, after the manner of men, that is,
familiariter mecum agis, thou dealest familiarly with me; as one man with an
other: to this purpose also Sa.

6. Rupertus gives this sense, this is the Law of Adam, that is, we are all
the children of wrath by nature, not worthy to be thine house.

7. But these words are much better referred unto Christ, This is the law of
that (excellent) man: which word excellent is supplied, 1. Cor. 17.17. that is,
thou grantest me these things, not for any merit or worthiness in me, but for
the worthiness of that excellent man Christ: Mar. And Osiander does make this
place an evident testimony of Christ, both God and man, not putting it in the
vocative case, O Jehovah God, but joining all these words together by
apposition, this is the law of that man Jehovah God: in this is the condition
of the Messiah, both man and God; but the word Iehoui is taken in the vocative
case, as Genesis 15.8. yet there is here a manifest reference to Christ: the word
is haadam, of that man, the article is put too, to note some excellent and
singular man: which title is added, 1. Cor. 17.17. And Daud here has manifest
reference to the Messiah, because he speaks of the continuing of his house
for ever, v. 19. the next words also following, v. 21. for thy words sake,
Iunius understands of Christ, who is the eternal word of God.

16. Quest. v. 21. Gods own will the cause of his decree, According to thine
own heart, etc.
1. Like as Gods own gracious purpose, not any respect of David's worthiness,
was the cause of these promises made unto him concerning the Messiah: Osiander.
So the Lord in the election and predestination of his Saints unto life,
respects not their works, but according to his own heart, and voluntary
decree, he ordains them unto life: this place then directly makes against
their opinion, Controv. Against election by works.
who think that the decree of election proceeded from the foresight of men's
works.

2. But it will be objected, that God ordained none to be saved, but such as
lead a godly life; true it is, but yet the foresight of their good works it
not the cause of their election unto life, but an effect and fruit of it: God
as he has appointed the end, so likewise he has ordained the means, tending
to that end: As the Apostle says, He has chosen us in him before the
foundation of the world, that we should be holy, Ephesians. 1.4. And again, We are
his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which he has
ordained that we should walk in them, Ephesians. 2.10.

17. Quest. v. 13. Of the meaning of these words, Whose Gods went and redeemed
them.
1. Some, in that the word eelohim, gods, is here put in the plural, do
understand it in respect of the opinion of men, who think there are many gods:
according to that saying of S. Paul, there are many gods and many lords, 1.
Cor. 8. but seeing mention is here made of that singular work of the redeeming
Israel out of Egypt, it must be referred to the true God.

2. Chimhi thinks, that David thus speaks of God in the plural for more
honor sake: but this custom of using the plural for the singular for more
honor and dignity sake, was not taken up in those days: and if that had
been the reason, why does the Prophet David afterward throughout his prayer,
use the singular number speaking unto God?

3. Some by gods, here understand Moses and Aaron, which went to redeem the
people: Chalde paraphrast. for so Magistrates and governors, are sometime in
Scripture called by the name of Gods: but it is evident, that the Prophet
speaks here of God himself: as in the verse following, Thou have redeemed
unto thy self thy ptople Israel.

4. Wherefore this rather is referred to God himself the blessed Trinity, the
Father, Son, and holy Ghost; here both the verb, and the other word are put
in the plural number, halehu eelohim, the gods went: but 1. Chron. 17.21. the
verb is put in the singular, haloch, and eelohim, gods, in the plural: This
plurality of persons is an evident demonstration and proof of the blessed
Trinity: Mart. whom in the unity of essence he said before to be but one, v.
22. and none like unto him: Osiand.

18. Quest. In what sense it is said, God went and redeemed them to himself.
1. God being in himself infinite, as he cannot be comprehended and contained
in any place, so neither does he go from place to place. But God is said to
go to a place, when it pleases him to make some visible demonstration of his
presence, as he did by those wonderful and fearful works which he showed in
Egypt, when he delivered his people.

2. This also may most fitly be applied to the incarnation of the Son of
God, who then came and visited us, when he took our humane nature upon him.
And so God went and redeemed his people, which was the work of the whole
Trinity, the Father, Son, and holy Ghost.

3. Yet our nature was assumed only to the person of the Son, not to the
person of the Father, or the holy Ghost: the internal works of the Trinity
as they are called, How the works of the Trinity are divided and
distinguished, how they are undivided
are peculiar to the persons, as to the Father to beget, to the Son to be
begotten, to the holy Ghost to proceed from them both: but in external works
they join together, as the Father, the Son, and the holy Ghost created the
world, and whatsoever is done in the world by God, is wrought by the undivided
and joint power of the Trinity.

4. Yet the Son of God is only said to be incarnate, in respect of the work
it self: but if the action of his incarnation be considered, therein the whole
Trinity concurred: for God gave his Son for the redemption of the world, the
holy Ghost ouershadowed Marie, when Christ was conceived: and Christ also is
said to have given himself, Galat. 2.10. So Ioh. 10.36. the father is said to
sanctify Christ: and, Ioh. 17.19. he says, I sanctify my self: likewise,
Ioh. 2.13. Christ says, Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise
it up again: and the father also is said to raise him up, Romans 8.11. Then in
the action of the incarnation of Christ, the blessed Trinity did work, but
opus ipsum, the work wrought, the incarnation it self was appropriated to the
person of the Son only: Mart.

5. Further, the divine essence or nature is to be considered two ways, either
absolutely in it self, as it is common unto the three persons of the blessed
Trinity; and so the divine essence was not incarnate: or vt est determinata in
vna aliqua (...), as it is determined in some one person: and so the Son of
God, that person only was begotten of God, was incarnate and became man for
us, Marboch. in Exodus cap. 37.

6. So God came unto us men to redeem us: for we should never have come unto
God, unless he had come unto us first: Mart.

19. Quest. v. 13. And do for you great things: to whom David speaks here.
1. The vulgar Latin reads, to do for them great things: but the word is
lacham, for you. 2. Pet. Martyr refers it unto God, that God did great
works for himself, to his own glory: but the Prophet here speaking of God,
says ver. 24. thou have redeemed, leca, to thy self a people. 3. Therefore,
David here by a certain Apostrophe, turns himself unto the people: to do
for you (that is, O Israel) great works: as it appears by the words
immediately following, and terrible for thy land O Lord: Iun. Vatab. And whereas
it will be objected, that David here speaks alone and apart unto God, and
therefore turns him not unto Israel: Mart. that is no good reason: for so
David mourning by himself over Saul and Jonathan, yet speaks unto Israel,
chap. 1.14. O noble Israel, he is slain upon thy high places, etc.

20. Quest. v. 23. Of the meaning of those words: Whom thou have redeemed out
of Egypt, the nations, and their gods.
1. Some do read thus, to do great things, etc. before thy people, whom thou
have redeemed out of Egypt, the nations and their gods: that is, the kinreds
and tribes of Israel, and their judges, which in Scripture are called gods:
Vatab. 2. Martyr understands it indeed, that God was delivered with his
people, who was as it were afflicted and did suffer with them. 3. The most give
this sense, joining it with the next clause before, Whom thou have redeemed
from the Egyptians, both (from) the nation it self, and their gods: for the
Lord also judged the gods of Egypt, when he brought out his people, Numb. 33.4.
so Borrh. Pellic. Osiand. Geneuens. 4. But the best interpretation is thus to
read, by supplying a word, ( in casting out) before the people, etc. the
nations and their gods: Iun. Septuag. for this word is supplied, 1. Chron.
17.2. by casting out from the face of thy people, (whom thou have redeemed out
of Egypt) the nations: from thence the word legarosh, to cast out, must be
borrowed to make up the sense here.

21. Quest. v. 26. Of David's prayer, the manner, matter and scope thereof.
1. The end of David's prayer, which he propounds, and sets before his
eyes, is the glory of God; let thy name be magnified: he seeks nothing else,
but the exaltation of Gods glory. 2. The reason which moved David to pray,
was his confident and sure persuasion of the goodness and mercy of God toward
him, who had revealed unto David this thing, which he prays for, the
establishing of his house: and he confesses God both to be able to do it, and
is assured he also will do it: he is fully persuaded both of his power and
truth, saying, v. 28. thou art God, and thy words are true. 3. Thirdly, the
thing which David prayed for, is, that the house of thy servant be established
for ever: v. 26. Mart.

22. Quest. Why David prays so earnestly for that, which the Lord had
promised to do.
1. Some of Gods promises are conditional, some are absolute: the promise made
to David concerning the Messiah, which should come of his seed was absolute,
and so likewise was the continuance of his posterity until the Messiah: for
Gods decree herein could not be altered: but the promise of the outward
prosperity of his seed, and the possessing and holding of the kingdom was
conditional, so his sons walked in obedience before God: therefore David
prays that such grace might be given unto his posterity, as that they might
have a prosperous government.

2. Further, although God do certainly purpose to give those things, which he
has promised, vult tamen interponi media, yet he will also have the means
used: as our Blessed Savior, praying, Father glorify thy Son, did not doubt
of his glorification: but it became him for our example, to show his obedience,
to pray for the effecting of his fathers will, whereof he was most assured:
and so David prays here. Mart.

23. Quest. v. 29. Why David so often repeateth the same thing in his prayer,
now let it please thee to bless the house.
1. David uses no vain repetitions in his prayer: for conceiving great joy
upon the Lords liberal and gracious promise toward him, and his house, he was
so ravished, that he thought he could not sufficiently express his affection:
the mind of those which are devoutly affected, is not contented, semel
desiderata postulasse, we once to ask the things desired. Pelican.

2. But it will be objected, that our Blessed Savior teaches his Apostles not
to use vain repetitions, nor many words in their prayers: to this it may be
answered: that our blessed Savior forbids such vain and tedious
repetitions upon these two reasons. 1. That they be not like to the Heathen,
which think to be heard for their much babbling sake; men must not think to be
heard for any merit in their prayers, but of Gods mercy. 2. They must not use
such repetitions, as thinking thereby to inform God of their necessities, and
as it were to beat them into his ears: for as our blessed Savior there says,
God knows before we ask, what things we have need of, Mat. 6. in this
manner to use many words in prayer, it is not acceptable unto God.

3. And further, concerning the length of prayer, no other rule can be given,
then to look unto the affection, and intention of the heart: August. ad Probum.
as Augustine hereof thus excellently writes: si videmus studiu^ nostrum and
impetu^, etc. incipere flaccessere, etc. if we see our desire and earnestnes in
prayer to begin to abate, we must not dull the edge thereof, with much
speech: at si attentio nostra erecta sit, non est abrumpenda, but if our
intention do hold out still, our prayer must not be broken off: so he
concludes, oration multa esse debet, loquutio pauca, our prayer must be much,
but our words few, etc. that is, he which prays with his heart, though he
pray long, is much in prayer, few in words: but he who prays with
lippe-labour, though his prayer be short, speaks much, and prays little.
Mart. David's prayer then, proceeding from a zealous and devout heart, though it
were much in his desire, was not long in speech.

CHAP. 8.
1. Quest. v. 1. What is meant by Metheg Ammah, which David took out of the
hand of the Philistims.
1. SOme interpret it, the bridle of bondage: B.G. metheg signifies a bridle,
and ammath a maid servant, that is in bondage: Borrh. but the Israelites were
not in bondage at this time unto the Philistims. 2. Some read, the bridle of
tribute: L. Pellic. Rupert. but this we refuse for the same reason. 3. The
Septuag. thus, he took (...), the separated part: but the Hebrew word has no
such signification. 4. Some give this sense, he took away the commodity of
the river: Chal. or the bridle of the passage of water: Pagn. because the water
is by pipes and conduits drawn every way as with a bridle: but this
signification agrees not with the word Ammah.

5. The best interpretation is, to understand it of the taking of Gath, a
chief city of the Philistims, as may appear by comparing this place with 1.
Chron. 18.1. But the reason of this interpretation is diuersely rendered. 1.
Osiander takes ammah here to signify a cubite: and so David took away the
bridle of the arm or cubit, that is, the dominion which the Philistims had
over Gath, and the towns adjoining. 2. Pet. Martyr thus applies it, because
the smaller towns are as daughters, and the great city as a bridle; the
meaning is, that David took Gath, which was as a bridle to the rest, and the
villages he also took as the daughters. 3. But Iunius comes nearer the
sense, taking Ammah here for the proper name of an hill among the Philistims,
where Gath stood: of which word Amma, and Gor, or Gerar comes the word Amgar,
the name of an hilly tract among the Philistims, whereof Pliny makes mention,
lib. 5. c. 13. So then by the bridle of Ammah, is understood Gath, the chief
city in that hilly coast of the Philistims, which was as a bridle, and
defense, and fort unto all the country: Ammah is found also to be the proper
name of an hill, cap. 2.24.

6. Here spiritually in David's victory is shadowed forth the spiritual
kingdom of Christ, by the power whereof, the bridle of sin and Satan is
taken away, that they shall have no more dominion over the servants of God.

2. Quest. v. 2. He smote Moab: Wherefore David smote Moab, whose land the
Israelites were forbidden to meddle with when they came out of Egypt.
1. The Hebrews think, that whereas David when he was pursued of Saul, had
left his father and mother with the King of Moab, 1. Sam. 22.3. he had put them
to death, and therefore David takes this revenge of them, in killing two parts
of them and saving the third alive. But there is no such thing evident in the
Scripture: and therefore small credit is to be given to such uncertain
narrations.

2. The Israelites were indeed charged not to meddle with the Moabit^s
country, nor to provoke them to battle: For, 1. They were then as friends to
Israel; but now by many wrongs, ius fraternitatis infregerant, they had broken
and violated that brotherly right and amity which should have been between
them: Pellic. 2. The Moabites had hired Baalim to curse Israel, and did not
releive them with bread and water, and therefore they were forbidden to make
any peace with them. Deuter. 23.6. Afterward in the time of the Judges, the
Moabites oppressed Israel, when the Lord stirred up Ehud, who killed Eglon king
of the Moabites, Judge. 3. therefore David had just occasion of war against
them: Mart. 3. Though David had received some kindness at the hands of Moab in
the days of Saul, either that king was now dead, or David was not in respect
of private friendship, to spare that whole wicked nation against Gods
commandment: Osiand. 4. And that commandment was given to the Israelites
then, reseruata subiugatione ad tempora Dauidis, because the subduing of them
was reserved for David's times: Borrh. 5. And yet although David did put two
parts of the inhabitants to the sword, he did it not to take possession of
their country, or distribute their lands, but only made them tributarie: Mart.

3. Quest. v. 2. How David measured Moab with a coard.
1. The most think that it is not literally to be taken, as though David did
measure them with a line or coard: and therefore think, that this is a
similitude taken from the measuring of ground; for so the Hebrews did divide
their inheritance by line: Osiand. or from carpenters, that with a line strike
their timber, where they purpose to hew it off: Borrh. And hereby is
signified, that David ordained them to dest^uction, mensura certissima, by a
most certain measure and number: Vatab. and hereby also is showed into what
subjection and servitude they were brought, as conquerours use to divide the
land which they overcome: quae per mensurationum funiculorum adagij mere
intelligitur: which their servitude is understood by this adage or proverb of
measuring by roapes: Pelican. sic eos distribuit ad placitum suum, he does
divide them at his pleasure, as he which measures ground: Rupert.

2. But there is nothing to the contrary, why it may not literally be
interpreted, that David did indeed measure them out by line to destruction: as
Iunius interprets, he measured them, that is, their region and country with
a coard. 1. The Scripture is to be taken according to the literal sense
always, where there is no inconvenience to the contrary, as there is not
here. 2. Here is no note of similitude expressed, as with a coard. 3. The
description, in that first mention is made of a coard in general, then it is
subdivided into two coards for destruction, and one cord to save alive, rather
gives that it must be taken literally. 4. The words next following do
approve this sense: he measured them with a cord, and cast them down to the
ground: that is, he divided the region into three parts, and cast down the
cities and towns down to the ground in two parts, and put the inhabitants to
the sword: the cities in two parts of the country were best allotted out by
line and measure: and so the people together with their cities and towns were
measured.

4. Quest. v. 3. Of David's battle with Hadadezer king of Zabah, and the
occasion thereof.
1. This Hadadezer called in the Chronicles Hadarezer, is said to be king of
Sabah, where Josephus says the people called Sapheni inhabit, a large
country beyond Taurus between the two Armenias. 2. This Hadadezer, the most
think, went to recover his border at the river Euphrates, and to invade Judea:
so Mart. Vatab. B.G. with the rest. Iunius thus interprets, when he went to
turn back his hand toward the river Euphrates: that is, not when Hadadezer,
but when David went to repel the forces of Hadadezer, who was to pass through
some parts of David's country, as he went to fight against Tai the King of
Hamath, as is showed afterward, ver. 10. Iun. But the former interpretation
seems to be the more agreeable, by comparing this place with that 1. Chron.
18.3. where it is thus said: as he went to establish his hand, or power: which
cannot be understood of David, for the border or bounds of his kingdom yet
extended not so far: Iunius there reads, when David went, ad inijciendam
manum suam, etc. to set or oppose his hand toward Euphrates: but the word
iatzab, signifies to settle, to establish, not to oppose or set against: and
there he refers iado, his hand, to David, whereas here he understands it
of Hadadezer; but it must have the same sense in both places: likewise there is
great affinity between the word Iashab, here used, which signifies to
constitute, or place, and iatzab, to settle, establish. 3. It seems therefore
that Hadadezer rather sought to invade David's bounds, then only to pass
through them; for that had been no just occasion of war: and by this
occasion, that prophecy, Genes. 15.18. was fulfilled, that the Lord would give
unto Abraham's seed that land, even unto the great river Euphrates.

5. Quest. v. 4. What number of chariots and horses David took from Hadadezer.
There is mention made, 1. Chron. 18.4. of a thousand charets, and seven
thousand horsemen, and 20. thousand footmen: but here the number is a
thousand, seven hundred horsemen, Reconcil.
and 20. thousand footmen.

lib. 7. antiq. c 5.
1. Josephus is far wide, that speaks only of five thousand horsemen, and
20. thousand footmen: for he agrees with neither of these numbers.

2. Pet. Martyr thus reconcileth the places; that here only the principal
horsemen are spoken of, which were 1700. in the other place the whole number and
multitude.

3. But the best solution is this; that to the first number of a thousand, must
be added charrets: he took a thousand charrets, as it is in the other place,
and the same number of a thousand chariots Josephus also has: And by 700.
horsemen, here we must understand 700. companies of horsemen, which every one
had ten: which make in all seven thousand: see the like, c. 10.18. where it
is said that David destroyed seven hundred chariots of the Aramites: but 1.
Chron. 19.18. they are said to be seven thousand chariots: which make but 700.
companies or bands, allowing ten to every company: Iun.

6. Quest. v. 4. Why David houghed some of the chariot horse, and reserved some.
1. It is said that David houghed all the chariots, that is the chariot horses,
saving an hundred: this David did, to make them unfit altogether for the
service of war: as Ioshuah did the like by the Lords direction, c. 11.6. It
was not lawful for David to take them all to his own use, because the king is
directly forbidden to multiply horses, Deuteronomy. 17.16. least they might put their
confidence in horses: neither was David to destroy them all, because they were
not Cherem, that is, anathema, vowed to destruction. David therefore takes a
course between both, neither to destroy the horse, nor yet to reserve them for
his own use, but to hough them, and so make them unfit for war, though they
might serve for other works of tillage and husbandry. 2. Yet David reserueth
an 100. chariots, that is, four hundred horse: for four horse went to a
chariot, as the Hebrews gather out of that place, 1. King. 10.29. where it is
said, that Solomon gave 600. shekels for a chariot, that is, an 150. shekels
for an horse. These David might reserve for his own use; for in respect of the
whole service of the kingdom, 400. horse were not many: Mart.

7. Quest. v. 5. Of the Aramites that came to aid Hadadezer against David.
1. Josephus thinks, that this kings name was Hadad, and that the succeeding
kings of Damascus were called by that name; as the kings of Egypt were called
by the name of Ptolomees: and that Benhadad the third from this king, was both
of the same name and line, who afflicted Israel under the reign of Achab: thus
Josephus reports out of Nicolaus an old historiographer: But it is like
rather, that the title and name of Hadad should come from Hadadezer the king of
Sabah: Borrh. but seeing there is no certainty either of the one, or of the
other out of the text, we may so leave it.

2. This King of Aram or Damascus, here taking part with Hadadezer, and meddling
with a matter, which appertained not unto him, loses his own liberty: which
example should teach Princes how they take in hand any unlawful battle:
Osiand. As it was the ruin and overthrow of good Josias, when he went against
the King of Egypt, being not provoked.

3. Here now is fulfilled the prophecy of Baalim, That there should rise a
scepter of Israel, and smite the coasts of Moab, and destroy all the sons of
Seth, Numb. 24.17. These Aramites are counted among the sons of Seth, because
all the posterity and offspring of Cham perished in the flood: Borrh.

8. Quest. v. 7. How far it is lawful to rejoice for the destruction of our
enemies.
Thai king of Hamath, who had continual war with Hadadezer, whom David had
discomfited, sends his son Ioram to rejoice with him, because his mortal
enemy was vanquished, and to enter into league of amity and friendship with
him. It is here then to be considered, how far it is lawful to rejoice in
the fall of an enemy.

1. First, in the spiritual fall of an enemy, as into sin and wickedness,
it is not lawful to rejoice, but therein we ought much to be grieved, as S.
Paul bewailed them, which sinned among the Corinthians, 2. Cor. 12.21.

2. In other temporal calamities, some think it is not lawful to rejoice
over the ruin of our enemies, as long as the will of God is not revealed in
the just punishment of such: but when God has evidently declared his will in
the judging of such, then they hold it lawful to rejoice: as Moses did triumph
in the overthrow of Pharaoh, and of the Egyptians in the red Sea.

3. But this matter must otherwise be considered of: for when God does judge an
enemy, we must consider, whether we joy therein in respect of our own private
quarrel, or as it concerns the glory of God: for it is unlawful for us in
any private respect to insult over our enemies fall: as the wiseman says in
the Proverbs, Be not glad when thine enemy falls, etc. least the Lord see
it, and it displease him: Prou. 24.17*
But if we consider Gods glory, which was hindered by such enemies, and the
Churches common good, then we may rejoice and be thankful unto God, that has
therein also together judged our cause; as David gave thanks unto God, when he
heard of the death of Nabal: But it seems that this Thai rejoiced only of a
carnal mind, because his enemy was foiled and overcome.

4. Yea it often falls out that these two affections of grief and joy
together may concur in Gods servants: that their natural compassion may be
moved to show their sorrow in the calamity and ruin of their foes; as David
mourned for Saul: and yet in respect of Gods glory, and the truth, which was
hindered by such, they may be glad that they are taken out of the way: as
David, no doubt in the overthrow of Saul, did thankefully and humbly
acknowledge Gods merciful and fatherly providence over toward him.

9. Quest. v. 11. Of the spoils of the Kings, which David consecrated unto God.
1. In that David consecrateth unto God the rich spoils of his enemies, as the
golden sheilds, which belonged to Hadadezer, and of the rest, as of Ammon,
Moab, Aram, Amalech, the Philistims, with the Edomites, together with the
vessels of gold and silver, which Thai sent him, it shows that he did not
make these wars of a covetous mind, to enrich himself, but to prepare
ornaments and stuff for the Lords house. 2. For although he were forbidden
himself to build it, yet he might provide matter, which was necessary for the
work thereof: as the Israelites did bestow the spoils of Egypt upon the
Sanctuary: Mart. 3. Which shows, that as, these outward spoils served to
adorn the material temple; so the spiritual spoil of the heathen, the
invention of arts and sciences must be converted to the setting forth of the
truth: Borrh. 4. Rupertus well applies these seven victories of David, to the
seven vialls of wrath and judgments, which Christ should bring upon the
world for the contempt of his gospel.

10. Quest. v. 13. How this place that David slew of Aramites 18. thousand is
reconciled with 1. Chron. 18.12.
In that place of the Chronicles, it is said that Abishai slew of the Edomites
18. thousand: and in the title of the 60. Psalm, mention is made how Ioab
slew of the Edomites 12. thousand in the valley of salt: here are three great
differences in show: both in the persons that made the slaughter, one text
says David did it, an other Abishai, the third ascribes it to Ioab: and in
the persons which were slain, in two of these texts they are named to be
Edomites, in one of them Aaramites: thirdly, the number differs: one place
speaks but of 12. thousand, the other two of 18. thousand.

1. Pelican thinks that Aram may be taken for Ed^m, by the mistaking of one
letter: for between the letter Daleth, and Rhesh, there is small difference:
but we must not so easily admit an error in the original, where an other
answer may be found.

2. Some think that the Aramites and Idumeans did join their forces together,
and therefore they are called in one place Aramites, in the other Edomites:
Genev. Borrh. But David's slaughter of the Aramites is touched before, he slew
of them 22. thousand, ver. 5.

3. Pet. Martyr also has the like solution: that David by his captains
Abishai and Ioab, made joint war with the Aramites and Edomites: whereof
Abishai slew six thousand, and Ioab 18. thousand: this answer is but in one
point excepted against, for that he thinks that in this number of 18.
thousand, the Aramites are comprehended: which is before showed to be otherwise.

4. Thus therefore these places are reconciled: 1. For the persons, David is
said to have smitten them, because he did it by his captains Ioab and Abishai.
2. For the number: Abishai first slew 6. thousand, and then Ioab renewing the
battle twelve thousand more, as it is in the title of that Psalm: so that
both the brethren together put to the sword 18. thousand. 3. Concerning the
persons: only the Edomites were slain: David returned indeed from the
slaughter of the Aramites, as the title of the Psalm shows: and thus the
verse must be read, David got him a name when he returned from slaying the
Aramites, in the valley of salt; (smiting) eighteen thousand: where the last
words are divided from the former sentence by the perfect distinction athnah,
and therefore cannot be referred to the Aramites: it must be understood then,
that he smote 18. thousand of the Edomites: as it follows in the next verse,
he put a garrison in Edom: Iun.

11. Quest. Of the valley of salt.
1. The most do take this for the lake Asphal^is, the salt sea, where sometime
stood Sodom and Gomorrha: Borrh. and where Abraham fought so prosperously:
Mart. But Abraham's battle was before the destruction of Sodom, which valley
was then fruitful, as the Lords own garden, Genesis 13.10. but after the
destruction of Sodom it became a most filthy lake: which as some write
continually smoaketh, and sends forth a sulphurous and stinking smell: the
water is so bi^^er tha^ no fish can live therein, and the ground so barren, that
no grass grows thereon, as is more at large showed elsewhere: Hexapl. in
Genes. c. 19. qu. 14.
this then was a very unfit place for these armies to meet in.

2. Therefore this was an other valley of salt in the land of Edom: as is
evident, 1. Kin. 14.7. He slew of Edom in the valley of salt ten thousand, and
took the city Sela, or Petra, etc. so called of the rock. This Petra is the
chief city of Arabia, upon which Idumea confineth: Iun.

3. The Latin interpreter adds further, and at Gebelem about 23. thousand:
where two great errors are committed: for the words bege, melach, in the
valley of salt, are corrupted and turned into a fained proper name, Gebele: and
the number of 23. thousand, is added.

4. Here begins the prophecy of Isaac for the pre-eminence of Jacob over
Esau to take place: that the Elder should serve the younger; for the Edomites
were now in subjection to Israel, and so were governed by a viceroy until the
reign of Iehosophat, 1. King. 22.47. Iun.

12. Quest. v. 17. How Zadock and Ahimelech are said to be Priests.
1. Some think that these two, Zadock who descended of Eleazar, 1. Chron. 6.8.
and Ahimelech who came of Ithamar by Eli, 1. Chron. 24.3. were the high
Priests: Pelican. Borrh. But that is not like: for by the law there was to be
but one high Priest: David therefore would not so apparently trangresse the law.

2. Some think that Ahimelech is the same who elsewhere is called Abiathar,
and that Abiathar the father was also called Ahimelech, and both the father and
son had two names: Sa.

3. But the high Priest at this time was Abiathar, the father of this
Ahimelech, who was removed from his office by Solomon, and gave place unto
Zadocke, 1. King. 2.26. But because there was contention between these two
families for the priesthood, David to compound this controversy, makes these
two the chief among the Priests, next unto Abiathar the high Priest.

4. Here we see that David has authority to set the priests in their order
and place: Controv. Kings have power over Ecclesiastical persons.
which discovers the insolency of the Pope, who thinks scorn that he, his
Cardinals, or Prelates, should be at the devotion of Emperor or King.

13. Quest. v. 18. Who were the Cerethites and Pelethites.
1. These Cerethites and Pelethites, Josephus thinks to be (...), keepers of
the kings body, the kings guard: so also Mart. Borr. Pellic. Geneuens. who
were so called as some think, the one sort of charath, to cut out, because
they were the Kings executioners: the other of palate, to defend, because they
kept the kings person: Mart. Paul. Burgens.

2. Some give an other deriuation of carath, which signifies to strike a
covenant, and pala, excellent, so called because they were worthy and
excellent men.

3. Chimhi expounds these names by Vrim and Thummim: they were men of
knowledge and integrity: and as some think David's counsel: but then Benaias
being a man of war should not have been set over them.

4. Some think that these were strangers of other countries, as the Cerethites
were Philistims, and that the King used them to guard his person, as now the
Switzers, and Heluetians, and Scots are in other countries appointed for the
Kings guard: Sa. But it is not like, that David would have strange people
being infidels and idolaters, so near his person: Mart.

5. Vatablus, reads here, Creti and Pleti, the Cretians and Pletians; but he
shows not what people, or of what nation they were. In the Apostles time we
read of Creetes that were at Jerusalem, Act. 2.11. for then the Cretians were
famous: But in David's time they were not much regarded.

6. Wherefore these Cerethites and Pelethites, were proper names: and it
seems they were garrison soldiers, the Cherethites which inhabited Chereth
among the Philistims after David had vanquished them: for the Cherethites were
counted among the Philistims, 1. Sam. 30.14. I^^k. 25.16. and the Pelethites
were also garrison soldiers among the Iaphlethites, whereof mention is made,
Josh. 16.2. Iun. and the Chalde paraphrast also comes near this
interpretation: taking the Cherethites for archers, and the Pelethites for
slingers: they were not then always attending upon the court, but garrison
soldiers employed in defense of the land, and giving their attendance by their
course upon the king, as may be gathered, c. 15.18.

14. Quest. v. 18. Whether the sons of David were Priests.
1. The Hebrewe word cohamin, the Latin interpreter translateth sacrerdotes,
Priests: so also Montanus: but it is not like that David's sons being of the
tribe of Judah, took upon them the Peiesthood, which only belonged unto Leui:
the kingdom was invested in Judah, and the priesthood in Leui: they which
attempted to confound these offices prospered not: Vzziah the King was stricken
with leprosy, because he would have burned incense, which only belonged to
the Priests: And the Macchabes being Levites for usurping upon the kingdom
procured much woe unto themselves, and to all the nation.

2. Some think that they were discipuli sacerdotum, scholars of the Priests,
and brought up under them, and therefore are called Priests: as the schools of
the Prophets were called Prophets: ex Pellic. but the Schools of the Prophets
afterward became Prophets, as Elisha after Elias, but these never were Priests.

3. Wherefore they are better taken to have been Princes or chief rulers, as
read P.V. Chald. B.G. for cohen sighifieth a chief or principal man in
bearing any public office sacred or civil: Borrh. and so they are called
rishonim, head or chief men about David, 1. Chron. 18.17.

4. But this advancing of his sons so soon, turned afterward to David's hurt:
for Absalom by this means aspired to the kingdom, and Adoniah practiced
against Solomon: yet David did herein the part of a prudent Prince; to acquaint
his children with the affairs of estate, Mart.

5. Here are now reckoned up the chief officers about David both of the Civil
and Ecclesiastical state: showing that a kingdom cannot consist without good
officers and governors of both kinds: Borrh.

CHAP. 9.
1. Quest. v. 1. Of David's kindness in remembering Ionathans posterity.
1. David here shows himself both a good Prince, and a good man: the one in
the administration of justice mentioned, c. 8.15. the other here in performing
the covenant and promise made to Jonathan: one may be a good man, and yet not a
good Prince; for every one has not the gift of government, but it is not
possible for one to be a good Prince, but he must also be a good man: for he
that is evil in himself, cannot be good to others: as S. Paul, He that cannot
rule his own house, how shall he take care for the Church of God? 1. Tim. 3.5.
he which is not good to his own at home, can not show his goodness abroad to
others: Mart. 2. David before this time being busied in settling his kingdom
at home, and subduing his enemies abroad, had no leisure or opportunity to
think of these private affairs: But now being confirmed in his kingdom, he
calls to mind the benefits which he had formerly received, to recompense
them: not like unto many in these days, which when they are come to honor,
forget their old friends; as Pharaohs butler did not remember Joseph of a long
time: Osiand. 3. Now David begins to bethink himself of the great
kindness, which ^onathan had showed him in his life time: and of the league
and covenant which he had made with him, 1. Sam. 20.16. David also swear unto
Saul to be good unto his posterity, 1. Sam. 24.22. But because Saul had
falsified his faith and oath to David diverse times: but Jonathan he had foun^
most trusty and faithful, therefore he says, That I may show him mercy for
Ionath^n^ s^ke, rather then for Saul: Martyr.

2. Quest. v. 2. Of Ziba, who is said to be a servant of the household of Saul.
1. This Ziba is held to be a Canaanite: because the Hebrews could but serve
seven years, unless they would themselves, for then they had their ears
boared thorough, if they were unwilling to leave their masters se^uice, and
then they served till the 50. year. But this Ziba had been a servant unto
Saul, and he is still a seruanr unto that family at this time, which was seven
years after Saul's death: Mart. Pelican. 2. But he was a servant of better
sort and condition then ordinary, he had also 20. servants under him, v. 10.
There were three degrees of servants, ordinarij, vicarij, mediastini, the
ordinary servants, the servants for supply, and the servants always at hand:
these last were put to the vilest and basest services: the first, had their
ordinary and certain service set them, as to wait in the chamber, to be
cators and prouiders, to attend the husbandry, and such like: and these might
have servants under them, who were servants in respect of their masters, and
they were masters themselves over their servants: of this sort of servants was
Ziba: the third sort of servants, which were called vicarij, which served for
supply, had no certain place or office appointed them: Martyr.

3. Quest. v. 3. Why it is called the mercy of God.
1. Borrhaius thinks it is called the mercy of God, because in showing
mercy we are like unto God. 2. Some do so expound it, such mercy as shall
be pleasing and acceptable unto God: Geneuens. 3. Some by the mercy of God
understand great mercy, as such things which are excellent are said to be of
God: Vatab. Osiand. 4. But David in this speech rather has reference to the
league and covenant made between them in the name of God, and now therefore
according to the same will perform the mercy and kindness, which they Jonathan
and David promised each to other: Iun.

4. Quest. v. 7. Of the kindness which David showed to Miphibosheth.
1. It will be said that David in restoring unto Miphibosheth the lands of
Saul, did perform no great matter, seeing they were of right due unto him, as
the next heir: to this R. Solomon answers, that it was in the power of the
King, to take from whom he would, and give unto another, at his will and
pleasure, as Samuel describes the office of a King, 1. Sam. 8.12. He will
take your feilds and your vineyards, and your best olive trees, and give them
to his servants: And therefore David did show great kindness, in giving these
lands to Miphibosheth, which he might have bestowed upon another. But D. Chimhi
herein opposes himself to R. Solomon, showing that it is not in the power of
the king, to dispose of men's grounds and possessions at his pleasure: as Ahab,
though a wicked king, yet would not by violence take away Naboths vineyard: the
fruits of their lands were to serve the kings use, they were thereof to give
toward the provision of his house, but their possessions simply he was not to
dispose of. But it was otherwise in this case: for Ishbosheth having rebelled
against David the lawful king, might justly have been deprived, and likewise
Miphibosheth for taking part with him, as is most like, Iun. of all the right
which they had in the goods and possessions of Saul: and therefore David
shows herein great mercy, in restoaring of them unto Miphibosheth. Mart.

2. It will further be objected, that David was bound to do this by virtue of
the former league made between Jonathan and David: and therefore he was in a
manner forced to show this kindness. It is true, David was tied unto it by the
force of the league: yet David's faithfulness is therein no whit less to be
commended, that was so mindful of the covenant: these circumstances specially
considered: as 1. that Jonathan was now dead, and could not challenge David. 2.
The house of Saul had resisted him, and put him to much trouble, which might
have seemed a just cause for David to have violated that league. 3. And some
might have pretended policy, that it was not safe to advance the house and
family of a contrary faction: David notwithstanding all these objections,
which might have bin pretended, extends his kindness and therein shows his
goodness and faithfulness.

3. But David promised Jonathan, that he should be the next and second unto him
in the kingdom: 1. Sam. 23.17. he therein kept not his promise with Jonathan:
yes, David made good herein that promise to the full: for Miphibosheth is
nourished at the kings table, as one of the kings sons: who were chiefest in
reputation, as is before showed, c. 8.18. and Miphibosheth was counted among
them: But in that Miphibosheth was not employed in any place of government, it
was not David's fault, but because he in respect of his lamenesse was not fit
for any such employment. Mart.

5. Quest. v. 8. Why Miphibosheth calls himself a dead dog.
1. Miphibosheth so calls himself, as vile and contemptible in diverse
respects. 1. In regard of his family, which was rejected of God, and David
chosen to be king in the place of Saul: Mar. 2. And herein he confesses and
acknowledges, the trespass of that family against David, by the which they
deserved to be cast off and despised of David, as a dead dog. Pelican. 3. He
confesses himself in respect of his person, to be as an abject and forlorn
man, not worthy to be respected of David. Osiander.

2. But this speech must not be understood as simply spoken, but therein there
is both an hyperbole, in that by way of amplification, to set forth his
miserable state, he resembles himself to a dead dog: it is also spoken by
way of comparison in respect of David, and of his princely estate, he takes
himself to be but as a dead dog.

6. Quest. Whether any to show their humility, may make a lie of themselves.
It may seem that Miphibosheth did more abase himself then he needed, and
confessed himself to be that, which he was not, which gives occasion of this
question: which may thus be resolved.

1. It is not lawful for any to lie of himself, to express his humility:
for S. Paul's rule is general, Romans 3 8.
that we must not do evil for good to come thereof: neither is it lawful to
make a lie, Ibid. v. 7.
that the verity may now abound thorough my lie unto his glory: nay it is not
lawful for to make a lie for Gods cause: for then as the Apostle says, we
should be found to be false witnesses of God: 1. Cor. 15.8. Epist. 8 ad Hier.
And Augustine well shows by occasion of these words: that it is no less
sin, falsa laudare de Deo, quam de eo vera non credere: to speak by way of
commendation false things of God, as not to believe, that which is true: if it
be not lawful for Gods honor to tell a lie, much less to preserve the
credit of our modesty and humility.

1. Tim. 1.13.
2. But Saint Paul's example will be objected, that says he was, peccatorum
primus, the first, or chief of sinners: and yet there were greater sinners
then he. And the Prophet Agur says of himself, Prove. 30.1.
that he was more foolish then any man: yet was not he the foolishest among
men.

1. Some here answer, that they thus spoke in respect of their own weakness,
confessing they had no strength at all of themselves but from God.

2. It may further be added, that they thus confessed in their own opinion,
who thought themselves to be inferior unto all.

3. But here is a difference to be made between a general confession of the
weakness and impotencie of our nature, which the most perfect in this world may
truly ackowledge, and a particular ackowledgement of some actual sin, which
no man is to confess of himself, being not guilty thereof: as S. Paul,
though he say, he was the chiefest sinner, yet he does not make himself an
adulterer, Idolater, or such like, which sins he was free from.

4. Saint Paul also speaks by way of comparison with those which were called,
that none of them had so persecuted the way of Christ, as he had done, and
consequently none of them had so greatly sinned in that behalf; so also the
Prophet Agur does acknowledge his ignorance not simply, but in respect of the
high things of God, which he was not able to comprehend. Mar.

7. Quest. v. 10. Whether Miphibosheth did in deed eat at the Kings table.
The occasion of this question is this: v. 10. David says, Thou, and thy
sons, and thy servants, shall till the land, and bring in, that thy masters
son may have food to eat; but Miphibosheth thy masters son, shall eat
bread always at my table: how did Ziba provide food for Miphibosheth, seeing
he fed at the kings table in Ierushalem? Again, v. 11. Ziba says, All that
the King has commanded, etc. so shall thy servant do, that Miphibosheth may
eat at my table, as one of the Kings sons: if he did eat at Zibahs table;
how was he fed at the kings table?

1. Some answer to the first doubt: that v. 10. in the first clause, by his
masters son, is meant Micah Miphibosheths son, who is mentioned v. 12. so
Iunius: but seeing Miphibosheth is afterward said, to be his masters son,
that is, Saul's nephew, it is likely to be taken in the same sense before: And
then in the first place he means not Miphibosheths person, but his family,
whereof his young son was a principal part: that though Miphibosheth
himself lived at David's table, yet his family with his son should be
maintained with Ziba. Osiand.

2. In the other place, v. 11. some read, at thy table: so Lat. Osiand. but the
word is shulcani, at my table, 2. Some so take it, as though Miphibosheth was
fed at Zibahs table: Pelican: but that is contrary to the text, v. 13.
Miphibosheth did eat bread continually at the kings table. 3. Some give this
sense: Miphibosheth is said to eat at the kings table, because he had meat
sent him from the kings table: Sa. but he rather sat himself at the kings
table, because he dwelt at Ierushalem, where the kings house was: and as David
in Saul's time, did eat at his table: so David would recompense the like
kindness to Miphibosheth to eat at his table. 4. Some give this
interpretation: that Miphibosheth may eat at my table: that is, may have all
things at commandment, as one of the kings sons, as if he sat at my table:
Genevens. but the phrase is taken here in the same sense, as it is before, v.
10. where David says that Miphibosheth should indeed eat at his table, not to
have all things at commandment in the kings house.

5. There remain three other interpretations: Iunius makes them the words of
Zibah spoken in this sense, Though Miphibosheth eating at my table, should be
as one of the Kings sons: so also Peter Martyr: that is, if it had pleased
the King, that Miphibosheth had been at my finding. I would have given him
entertainment as one of the Kings sons: but it is not like, that Zibah would
have called it his table, seeing he was but a servant to Miphibosheth: neither
would he seem to contradict the king, who had said before, that Miphibosheth
should eat at his table: and to what end should Ziba make mention of the Kings
sons, which had no allowance at his table?

6. Some take these words uttered by Zibah, but in the kings person;
Miphibosheth shall eat at my table, etc. as the king says. B.

7. But Vatablus better takes these words as spoken by David, that he said,
repeating his former words, Miphibosheth shall eat at my table: And this may
seem the more probable, because the former clause uttered by Zibah, ends
with the perfect distinction athnah.

CHAP. 10.
1. Quest. v. 2. How David showed kindness to the King of Ammon, and why.
1. David having now showed his grateful mind toward some at home, begins
also to practice the like abroad, and sends a freindly and comfortable
message to the king of Ammon, after the death of his Father: Mar. 2. Though it
were not lawful to enter into any public league with the Ammonites, which is
directly forbidden, Deuteronomy. 23.6. yet private amity might be retained: and David
might show his thankfulness unto them. Osiand.

3. What pleasure Nahash the former King of Ammon showed to David, is not
expressed: the Hebrews think that this was the kindness, that after the King
of Moab had put to death David's parents, the rest fled unto the King of Ammon,
and were there succored: but of this there is no certainty: it is like that
Nahash being a professed adversary to Saul, whom he had before discomfited,
when he besieged Iabesh Gilead, gave freindly entertainment in the days of
Saul unto David, 1. Sam. 9.
whom Saul hated and pursued. Iun.

4. Now whereas David is said before to have subdued the Ammonites, c. 8.12. it
seems, it is set down there by anticipation and prevention in the history:
for if David had before this vanquished the Ammonites, David would have sent no
such freindly and familiar message to his professed enemy. Mart.

5. Pelican observes, that the evil success which David had in this
embassage shows, that God was not pleased with David, because he sought the
freindship of an heathen king. But things are not to be measured by the event.
It was not amiss for David to show his kindness and thankfulness for a benefit
received: if the wicked rewarded him evil for good, it bewraieth the vileness
of their nature, rather then the unlawfulness of David's act. Martyr.

2. Quest. v. 3. Of the evil counsel of the King of Ammons Princes and
Counselors.
1. These perverse men, which persuaded Hanun the King, that David did not send
this message of good will, but in craft and cunning, measured others by their
own foot: because they themselves were fraudulent and deceitful, they so
judge of others. Pelican. And beside, they discover their hateful mind toward
the people of God: that as their forefathers afforded the Israelites their
brethren, no relief in the desert, Deu. 24.5. being descended of Lot, as the
other of Abraham, who called Lot his brother. And as Nahash their king required
of the men of Iabesh Gilead their right eyes: so they still bewraie an hatred
as it were hereditarie in them against the people of God.

2. They challenge them untruly to be spies, as Joseph did sometime his
brethren: but that was only in pretense: not that it is a thing in it self
unlawful to be a spy: for when there is just battle waged, it is lawful to
be a spy: as Moses sent Caleb and Joshua with others to epsy and search out
the land of Canaan: but under color of amity and freindship to spy out the
state and condition of others, is a thing odious. Mar.

3. Thus it pleased God, that by this means the prophecy of Balaam should
take place, that a scepter should rise in Israel, which should destroy Moab,
and the other sons of Sheth: Numb. 24.17.
Borrh. And thus it falls out according to the proverb, that evil counsel
is worst to the author of it.

3. Quest. v. 4. Of the despite offered by the Ammonites to David's messengers,
in cutting their beards and garments.
1. In that they offer such contumely and disgrace unto David's Ambassadors,
therein they offended against the law of nations, and therefore they received
afterward condign punishment: The Romans destroyed Corinthus a famous City of
Grecia, because they used their Ambassadors contumeliously in words.

2. There are two special ornaments of the body, one is natural, namely the
beard, the other artificial, the garments, which cover the nakedness: in both
these the King of Ammon seeks the disgrace of David's servants.

3. The reason whereof may be this: the Israelites were forbidden to cut their
beards, Leuit. 19.27. as a sign of mourning: and especial provision was made
by the law, that their nakedness should not appear: and therefore they were
forbidden to make any Altar with stairs, Exodus 20.26. the more then to
despite them, they offer them this ignominious disgrace in despite of their
own law. Mar.

4. Now in that they are bidden afterward by David to stay till their beards
were grown: it is evident, that the use then in Israel was not to shave their
beards: for then they might have cut away the other part also: howsoever then
this trick of shauing of beards be superstitiously used among the Romanists,
it is certain, that the Israelites custom was not to shave their beards:
Controv. Against shauing
for they might more easily have cut off the rest of their beards, which was
remaining, then have stayed till they were grown: Pelican, Osiander. The
heathen indeed had a fashion to cut their beards: as Adriane the Emperor is
noted to have been the first among the Roman Emperors that did spare his
beard, and suffered it to grow long. But this superstitious use was not taken
up by the people of God. Mar.

4. Quest. v. 6. From whence the Ammonites hired their soldiers and assistants.
1. Here are four countries named, whence the Ammonites had their supply,
from the Aramites of Rechab, which was a city at the foot of Libanus the
utmost bound of Syria toward Palestina, whereof mention is made Numb. 13.22.
from the Aramites of Zaba: from the King of Maacah, who was also subject to
Hadadezer king of Zabah: of the Maacahthites read 3.14. And from the men of
Tab, as Iun. rather then Ishtob, making it all one name, as the rest do read:
Tab was the country where Iepthah dwelt, Judge. 11.3. Beside they had some
help from Aram Naharaim, 1. Chr. 19.6.

2. All these belonged to Aram, or Syria, which was divided into Syria beyond
the river, v. 16. and Syria on this side: Borrh. which is subdivided into these
four regions, Camagena, Damascena, Coelosyria, Phoenicia: Mar. which are here
called by other names.

3. Some things are here omitted, which are mentioned, 1. Chron. 19.6. as how
they hired these soudiers for a thousand talents of silver: and that beside the
number of men here expressed, they hired 32. thousand chariots. Iun.

4. These Ammonites were so far from reconciling themselves to David, and
making amends for this wrong, that they provoked David to battle, and came as
far as Medeba, 1. Chron. 19.7. a city in the borders of Ammon.

5. Quest. v. 12. Of Ioabs courage and magnanimity against the enemies of Gods
people.
Here is nothing wanting in Ioab which is requisite in a good Captain. 1. He
upon the present uses most diligent care, and prudent advise in dividing the
soldiers, and committing part of them to Abishai his brother, and leading part
of them himself: which shows what an excellent thing concord is, as among
Captains, which fight terrene battles, so specially among Ministers, which do
fight the Lords spiritual battles. Osiand.

2. As he is not daunted or dismayed himself, so by his courageous speech he
animateth others; saying, let us be strong and valiant for our people, etc.
like as Moses sets down in the waging of battle, how the priest should
encourage the people: Let not your hearts faint, neither fear, or be amassed,
etc. Deuteronomy. 20.3.


3. He shows the right end of battle, to fight in defense of the Lords
people, and to maintain the true service and worship of God. Mar.

4. He does religiously commit the event of this business unto God: saying,
Let the Lord do that which is good in his eyes: non potest vox duce dignior
cogitari: a more worthy speech beseeming a Captain could not be thought, then
this was here uttered by Ioab. Pellic.

6. Quest. Whether this were true fortitude in Ioab.
True fortitude consists in the undertaking, and bearing of great and
sudden dainger in a good cause, and for some honest and commendable end:
wherein diverse things are to be considered. 1. The object or matter, wherein
true fortitude is seen: which is not in those evils which are internal, as
in avoiding of vices and sins: for these a man falls into by his own
default: nor yet is it properly seen in such dangers, which are involuntarie,
as in sickness, shipwreck, and such like: though to bear these things
patiently is an excellent virtue: but fortitude is exercised chiefly in such
dangers, as are outwardly incident, and in those most of all which are sudden:
as this danger of battle, wherein Ioabs fortitude did show it self, was
unexpected and unlooked for.

2. The end of fortitude must not be praise, vain glory, profit, such as the
valiant Heathen propounded to themselves, who showed their valor to get
themselves a name: and many adventured themselves because of those rewards
which were promised unto them, that did fight for their country: but the end
of this virtue, is some honest cause, as to defend our parents or country, to
deliver the oppressed, especially to maintain true religion and worship of
God. Mart.

3. There are diverse kinds of fortitude. 1. There is a warlike valor, which
comes by skill and experience in military affairs. 2. There is an other
kind which rises of confidence, which a man has in his strength. 3. An other
proceeds from ignorance of the greatness of the danger. 4. Another, which
rises from anger, or rage, when one is inflamed to revenge himself: but all
these are far off from true fortitude: which is a virtue not given by nature,
but wrought in men by the spirit of God, whereby they are resolved in an honest
cause to attempt difficult labor, and endure the utmost dangers: so that there
are two offices of a Christian fortitude, far, and aggredi, to bear and
suffer, and to attempt or enterprise: but the first rather, wherein the
fortitude and patience of the Martyrs was tried in enduring unspeakable and
intolerable torments for the name of God.

6. Although Ioab were a treacherous and bloody man, yet he might have this
moral virtue at this time, as many common graces of the spirit are often to be
found in the wicked. Mart.

7. Quest. v. 18. Of the number of chariots and horsemen, which were slain of
the Aramites.
Here mention is made of seven hundredth chariots, and 40. thousand horsemen:
but in 1. Chron. 19.18. there are said to have been destroyed 7. thousand
chariots, and 40. thousand footmen.

1. Some do thus reconcile the places, that the principal of the chariots are
here rehearsed, but the whole number there; and that the horsemen are here
only spoken of, there the footmen. Mart. Bor. Genev.

2. Iunius gives a better solution of the first doubt: that the number of 700.
is taken for so many troops or bands, which made in all 7000. chariots,
counting ten to a troop or company.

3. But for the latter doubt, Iunius solution seems not to be so good, who
thus reads, 7. hundredth chariots (and 40. thousand footmen) of horsemen:
referring horsemen, not to the 40. thousand immediately going before, but to the
7. hundredth chariots first mentioned: but this reading seems not to be so
fit, both because the words are not so distinguished in the Hebrew: and there
was great difference between the chariots and horsemen: as c. 18.4. David
took from Hadarezer, a thousand chariots, and 7. thousand horsemen, and 20.
thousand footmen: the horsemen, then can not be referred to the chariots. And
it is evident that the Ammonites hired both chariots, and horsemen, 1. Chron.
19.6. there were then both chariots, horsemen, and footmen in the host of the
Aramites: here the chariots and horsemen are numbered, which were destroyed; and
in the other place the chariots and footmen.

4. But whereas the Latin translation speaks of 58. thousand men, which fled
before Israel, v. 19. there is no such thing in the original: so that therein
there is a manifest corruption in the Latin.

CHAP. 11.
1. Quest. v. 1. What time Kings go forth to battle in.
1. AFter that Ioab had smitten the Ammonites, and they were fled into the
City, c. 10.14. he, the winter season, as it seems, coming on, seized to
pursue them, or besiege their city, which was Rabbah, afterward called
Philadelphia, the chief city of that nation: he expects the next spring,
when David sent Ioab again against the Ammonites. Pellic.

2. The time, which in those countries was thought meetest for war, was the
spring tide: when as both grass and corn begins to wax ripe in those
regions: and so they might have food, and relief for their horse, and their
whole armies. Borr. Osiand. Mar.

3. Wherein appears a great difference between the wars of these times,
and those: for now this age is so fierce, that even in the dead time of winter,
many Princes and Captains will not forbear war: As Pope Iulie took
Mirandula, in the deep snow: Frauncis king of France was taken at Ticinam in
February: Callis was sacked in January. Mart.

Quest. 2. Of David's adultery, and the use which is to be made thereof.
1. They which think to patronize their licentious life by David's fall, do
therein tempt God, and sin of presumption: for they which thus reason with
themselves: if David committed adultery, why may not we likewise: might they
not as well infer, Judas being an Apostle betrayed his master, and Paul
persecuted the Church, therefore it is lawful for them to do so likewise. 2.
But seeing the Scripture condemns the adultery of David, what impudency is
it for any thereby to seek defense of their sin? yea the heathen by the
light of nature held adultery to be a most grievous sin, as Pharaoh king of
Egypt, Genesis 12. and Abimelech king of Gerar, Genesis 20. So Nebuchadnezzar burnt
Achab and Zedechia two false prophets, and adulterers with fire, Ierem. 29.

3. But this profitable use may be made of David's fall, that sin is not
altogether extinguished in the regenerate, they oftentimes feel in their
members the law of sin rebelling against the spirit: and by this example of
David's sin, who by his repentance found forgiveness, we learn, that Gods
servants, if they offend of infirmity, should never despair of forgiveness. And
herein are we to imitate David, not in his sins, but in his true repentance
and tears after he had sinned. Mart.

3. Quest. v. 2. Of David's idleness and security, upon these words, David
arose from his bed.
1. The beginning of David's fall proceeded from his idleness and security; he
rose from his bed, whereon he used to rest in the afternoon: which as the
Physicians hold to be unwholesome to the body, Osiand. so was it a sign of
David's great security, who gave himself to ease and rest, his captain and
soldiers being occupied in dangerous battles abroad: David used not to go
forth with them as he had in fore time. Pelican.

2. There are diverse kinds of ease: some do sequester themselves from business
to give themselves to contemplation, as our blessed Savior preached in the
day, and prayed in the night, Luke 21. Some keep an holy rest from sin: But
there is beside a lascivious and wanton rest, or idleness, which is the mother
of lust: as one of the sins of Sodom was abundance of idleness, Ezeck 18.
As Ambrose fitly resembles idle persons to the oyster, who while he opens
his shell in the Sun, is assaulted by the crabbe or creavish, which comes
and thrusts his claws between the shells, and so deuoureth the oyster: so
idle persons are tempted and seduced, and made a pray of Satan.

3. But as idleness is hurtful to al, so it beseems not the person of
Princes, who though they never plow or dig, yet are to watch over the people
to see them well governed, and to provide for them good laws. And as in David,
this pleasant ease brought forth adultery: so the idle life of Monks, feeding
and pampering their bellies, was the cause of that filthy uncleanness and vile
corruption, which were detected to be among them.

4. Then seeing Satan is so vigilant to catch every oppertunitie to supplant
us going about like a roaring lion, as S. Peter says, seeking whom he may
devour: we ought so much the more carefully to watch over our selves, that we
may escape his snares. Mart.

4. Quest. v. 2. Of the wandering of David's eyes, upon these words, He saw a
woman washing her self.
1. David's curious eyes wandering, falling upon such a pleasant object, did
entangle his affection, and inflame his desire: David at this time had
forgotten that prayer, Psalm. 119.37. Turn away mine eyes from regarding
vanity; Borrh. first, seeing her he commits adultery with her in his
heart, then he rests not till he had acted his unclean desire. Osiand.

2. This sin of David appears the greater, if it be compared with Joseph's
continency: Joseph was young, and a single man, and was entised of his
mistress, yet consents not: David was of good years, having many wives,
which might have contented him; and beside he was a soliciter of a woman one of
his subjects, whose chastity he ought to have defended. Mart.

3. We see then hereby, how dangerous a thing it is to suffer the eyes to
wander: Job therefore made a covenant with his eyes, not to look upon a maid:
Gregory has a good saying, qui externo oculo abutuntur, digni sunt quibus
internus oculus offuscetur, they which abuse the outward eye, are worthy to
have the inward eye darkened. Ridiculous then and vain is their pretext, who
think, that while they gaze and look upon such pleasing objects, se illis
spectaculis non moueri, that they are not stirred with such spectacles and
sights: do they think them wiser and stronger then David who was caught by
his sight.

4. And herein David's offense was the greater, in respect of himself, who by
his place should have been a keeper and maintainer of Gods Law, and in regard
of others, whom he offended: for whereas Saul was not detected of adultery,
David's evil example gave occasion to men to justify Saul in respect of David,
and so to call in question the equity of Gods judgments: Mart.

5. Quest. v. 3. Of the beawtie of Bathsheba which entangled David.
1. Though David were entised by this pleasing object, yet therefore is not
beauty and fairness of it self an evil thing, which is a gift and work of
the creator: for beauty is defined to be apta coniunctio membrorum cum
suauitate coloris: an apt joining together of the members with a pleasant
color. So in Scripture virtuous men, as Joseph, David; and women, as Sarah,
Rebekah, Rachel, are set forth and described by their beauty.

2. But this gift of nature or rather of the God of nature, is made an occasion
of stumbling through the corruption of our nature; as the light of the Sun,
though in it self it be comfortable, yet is offensive unto bleare eyes: so is
man's corrupt nature affected with such objects; therefore as Phisicians when
they cut or launch any patient, will have their scholars present to make
observation thereof for their own practice: so we beholding the cure which God
made upon David, in launching this his spiritual sore, should teach us to
beware; and to set a door before our eyes: it was the fall of the old world,
when the sons of God, even they which came of the righteous race, gazed upon
the daughters of men, and saw they were fair, and so were seduced: Mart.

3. As the beauty of the body entangleth a carnal eye; so the Angels that
fell were proud of their spiritual beauty, wherein they were created, and so
were thorough pride cast down from heaven: Borrh.

6. Quest. v. 4. Of Bathsheba her willingness in consenting unto David, and of
other her faults.
1. Some think that it was great boldness in her to wash her self abroad in
open view: whereas it had been more beseeming her womanly modesty, to have
kept her within her doors: Mart. But it is more like that David espied her
washing in her house, as Josephus writes, through the windows; so thinks
Vata. Eman. Sa. for seeing she washed and purified her self from her monthly
uncleanness, v. 4. it is most like that she did it within her own house.

2. Pelican notes this for a fault also, that while her husband was watching
abrod in the camp, she at home abutitur quiet sua, abuses her rest, and
gives her self to washing and ^athing; when as it had been fitter for her to
be exercised in fasting and prayer: But seeing she did purify her self from
her uncleanness, this washing was of necessity rather and decency, then of
wantonness.

3. But herein was Bathsheba her great fault, that being sent for to come unto
the King, so easily consents: which showed either some evil affection toward
her husband, from whom she desired to be divorced; or an ambitious desire to be
the kings wife. Much unlike was she here unto Susanna, who did rather choose to
die, then to commit adultery. Beside, in that she sends as in fear to
David, that she was with child, being the apter to conceive after her monthly
purifying, she shows an unwillingness and grief that it was so, and bewrays
a desire to have had it otherwise. And such is the mind of wanton and lewd
women, fructum ventris oderunt, they hate and abhoore the fruit of the womb.
Mart.

7. Quest. v. 6. Of David's practice in seeking to conceal. his adultery.
1. David beside the adultery which he had committed, falls into diverse
other faults: first into hardness of heart, that neither he, nor yet Bathsheba
do bethink themselves what they had done, neither repent them of their sin,
but only think to hide and color it; then he shows the right guise and
fashion of hypocrites, who while they may hide their sins from men, do not
reverence the sight of God; further, intrudit silium suum in agros Vriae, he
would thrust his own son to be an others heir, and so abuse Vriah that way
also. Mart.

2. David goes on in this devise: first he enquireth of Vrias of Ioabs
welfare, and how the war prospered: but all this was merus praetextus, a
mere pretext or pretense: for David intended an other thing, then he
practices with Vrias to company with his wife, and sends after him a
present, a mess from his own table, that Vriah might thereby be cheared up,
and have a greater desire to his wives company. And to that end David seeing
Vriah to refrain the first night, watching among the rest at the Kings door,
made him the next day to eat and drink, and to be drunken that his lust to
his wife might be enflamed: But all this took no place; God so disposing, that
David's sin should come to light: for there is no counsel against God, but
his purpose shall stand: Mart. Borrh. Osiand.

8. Quest. v. 11. Of Vriah his answer unto David.
1. Vriah gives this reason, why he refused at this time to lodge in his own
house, because the Arc, and the host of Israel, and his Lord Ioab remained in
tents: whereby he shows by his example, that in time of common war men
should give themselves to prayer and fasting, not to ease and feasting: Borrh.

2. The Ark of God they used to carry with them into the camp for these two
causes, both that it might be an evident testimony of Gods presence, and that
they might ask counsel of God at the Arc, as occasion served: Mart.

3. This godly speech of Vriah might have admonished David, that it was much
more unseemly for him to follow unlawful lust in this common danger, seeing
Vriah abstained from that which was lawful. Pellic.

4. But it pleased God to leave David to himself, and to suffer him to fall
into this great sin, both in respect of himself, that he might thoroughly be
humbled, seeing God purposed to exalt him: and for the example of others, vt de
statu suo David cadente nemo superbiat, that no man should be brag of his
estate seeing David did fall, nor yet any should despair of rising again with
David. Pellic.

9. Quest. Of David's letters sent to Ioab in betraying Vriah: and Ioabs
readiness therein.
1. David is yet so far from seeing his sin, that he adds one wickedness
to an other: his idleness follows a wanton eye, his wantonness is accompanied
with lust, which brings forth adultery; then there is a devise to make Vriah
the father of an adulterous seed: to this David adds an attempt to make
Vriah drunk: this not taking place, he contriueth his death, and that in
betraying him into the hands of his enemies, and that with the loss of many
beside.

2. Wherein David for this one act exceeds the violent course which Achab
used against Naboth: he coueted but his vineyard, David desires an others
wife: Achab wrought this only by his wicked wife Iezabel, but David does this
himself. Martyr.

3. And Vriah his innocence makes David's sin more grievous; he which all
his life before hated fraud and deceit, now hates simplicity and truth: he
which spared his cruel enemy Saul before, now pursues unto death a most
faithful friend and dutiful subject.

And further, he makes Ioab accessarie to his sin: who though his sin was
the less, because the Kings authority forced him, yet is it not thereby
excused: It might be David pretended some capital offense to have been
committed by Vriah: yet Ioab was not ignorant of the Law, that none were to
be put to death, but under two or three witnesses: he therefore should herein
have obeyed God, rather then man. Mar.

10. Quest. v. 17. Why it pleased God, that Vriah in this manner should be
slain.
1. In that God suffered a just and innocent man in this manner to be cut off,
it need no more to call Gods justice in question, then that he suffered John
Baptist to be beheaded, Peter and Paul to be slain: Every one is borne to
die, for death is the stipend or wages of sin: God therefore whose counsels
are most secret, yet most just, does for some causes best known to himself,
give way sometime to unlawful attempts.

2. And who can tell, whether Vriah had not some sins of his own, for the
which he is chastised; as in attributing too much to his wife, and in suffering
himself to be misled often by her, or such like: But we must not howsoever it
is, complain of the Lords proceeding herein as unjust. Mart.

11. Quest. v. 20. Of Ioabs answer returned unto David.
1. In Ioab, though it was commendable in him, in that he was conversant in the
sacred histories, as appears by the instance given of Abimelech, yet in
being so serviceable to the unlawful desire of the king, he sinned diversely,
both in condemning a man, his cause being unheard, and in accomplishing the
kings desire with the loss of many beside: Osiand. 2. The messenger also
plaieth his part to pick a thank, who stayed not till David should object as
Ioab had before conceived: but presently tells David of the death of Vriah,
which he knew would be acceptable unto him. 3. David also dissembleth the
matter, to the intent, that neither this cruel commandment, nor Ioabs
fawning obedience should be discovered to the messenger. Geneuens.

12. Quest. v. 27. Of these words, and she became his wife: Whether it be
lawful to marry her, with whom adultery formerly was committed.
1. Nothing is defined directly concerning this matter in the Scripture; for
Leu. 18. where many impediments of marriage are rehearsed, and diverse
prohibitions of marriage; yet no mention is made of this bar of adultery
going before: but the reason hereof may be this, because the adulterer and
adultresse by Moses Law were to be stoned unto death: and so there could be no
question of this matter.

2. But it has been decreed by many Pontificiall decrees, that the marriage
of such who committed adultery before, should be actually void, as is extant
in the Extrauagant in diverse places: Extrav. titul. de eo qui duxeratt vxorem
quam polluerat, etc. and in tit. de convers. infidel. can. laudab.
But this example of David convinces that opinion, whose marriage with
Bethsheba, the Lord ratified and confirmed.

3. Wherefore the best resolution is this, that such marriages are indeed
altogether unfit and inconvenient: for if this were usually permitted for the
adulterer and adultresse to marie together, it would give occasion for one of
them to practice against the life of an other: yet though such marriages are not
convenient, and may with good cause be let and prevented, and such by the
Magistrate may be punished: yet such marriages being consummate, are not for
any such pretense to be dissolved, for then David's marriage had been unlawful:
Osiand. it is adultery following after, not going before, that breaks
marriage knot; see more of this question, Synop. Cent. 3. er. 96.

13. Quest. v. 27. How the thing which David had done displeased the Lord.
1. In that it is said this fact displeased God, there is an evident
distinction and difference made between the thing and the person: for David in
respect of his election was beloved of God: but this thing which he had
committed, namely the adultery with Bathshebah, and the murder of Vriah, the
Lord abhorred: neither is it to be held as an absurd thing, that one in respect
of his present estate should be an enemy unto God, and so displeasing unto
him, and yet in respect of his election beloved of God: Romans 5.8.
as S. Paul says, God sets forth his love toward us, seeing that while we
were yet sinners Christ died for us.

2. We must learn herein to be like unto God, to love the persons of our
enemies, and yet to hate and abhor their vices: as God here hates the sins
of David, yet loved his person as elected unto life: Mart.

14. Quest. Of the greatness of David's sin of adultery, and murder.
1. Concerning adultery in general, it is a most grievous and abominable
sin: as may be made plain by these reasons: 1. It is against the law of the
creation, and the first institution of marriage: that has made man and wife
but one flesh, which is divided by adultery. 2. The effects thereof are vile
and abominable: for adultery brings forth oftentimes murder, ^^ Psalm. 51.
hom. 3.
and poisoning, as Chrysostom shows. 3. Cyprian writes that in some
Churches the Christian Bishops utterly refused to receive adulterers into the
peace of the Cchurh, they held it to be so grievous a sin. Lib 4 e^ist. 2.
4. By the sin of adultery great injury is offered to posterity, and so to
the commonwealth in the commixtion of seed: Ad l^g. Iul de adult. in pa^d.
in which regard Bartalus makes it the next offense against the common wealth
unto treason. 5. Thales Milesius held perjury not to be worse then adultery.
6. Yea Chrysostom makes adultery worse then idolatry: hom 62. i^ Iohann.
because the one is a pollution of marriage, and makes a dissolution thereof,
so does not the other: But though this argument conclude not, for though in
respect of marriage adultery is the more grievous, yet simply it is not; and
idolatry is fornication against God, the other is against man: yet these
former reasons do sufficiently lay open the vileness of this sin: Mart.

2. And David's sin both of adultery and murder is amplified, 1. in respect
of the thing or object, which was not silver or gold, lands or possessions, but
the chastity and life of man. 2. The person against whom the sin was first
committed was god, whose law was contemned: and secondarily the persons of
Vriah and his wife, who being an alone woman, her husband being gone into the
war, ought by David to have been protected: Vriah himself also was an
innocent and harmless man, and therefore the sin was the greater. 4. David's
person also being considered the offense was the heavier, who was a Prophet
and a King, and therefore gave great offense by this evil example: Borrh.

3. The Hebrews, to excuse David's sin, have devised, that it was the use,
that they which went to battle gave their wives a bill of separation to marry
where they would. But this is their fiction: for if there had been any such
use, to make it lawful to marie such women so separated by bill of divorce,
what needed David so to have practiced against Vriah? and why did the Prophet
afterward reprove him? But if they say such a bill was but to take place after
the husbands death, then was it superfluous, for by death, without any such
bill, the marriage was fully dissolved: Martyr.

CHAP. 12.
1. Quest. v. 1. Who this Nathan the Prophet was whom the Lord sent to David.
David had a son called Nathan, c. 5.14. but he could not be Nathan the
Prophet, Mar. as may appear by these reasons: 1. Nathan was borne unto David
in Jerusalem: and therefore in respect of his years could not then be a
Prophet, when David consulted with Nathan about the building of God an house,
which was in the beginning of his reign in Jerusalem, c. 7. 2. Nathan the
Prophet is here sent to tell David of his sin, and to declare the judgments
of God against him, That the Lord would raise up evil against him even out of
his own house: David's own son had not been a fit messenger of such hard
tidings, neither would his speech have been so much regarded at David's hand.
3. Therefore as David had Gad the Seer to advise him before, so now he has
Nathan the Prophet.

2. Quest. How long after David's adultery Nathan was sent unto him.
1. It is evident that David slept in this sin toward 10. months: Mar. for
the child conceived in adultery was born presently after this admonition of
the Prophet: after so long a time Nathan was sent unto him, not as some think,
as watching his best opportunity; because when the heat of men's affections is
allayed, it is the fittest dealing with them, for the more one is grounded by
continuance in his sin, the more hardly is he brought to repentance. 2.
Neither is it like, that David in the mean time was otherwise admonished and
put in mind of his sin, as by reading the scriptures, and by remembering
himself of Vriah his words unto him: Mart. for it appears by David's answer
to Nathan, wherein he gives sentence against himself, that David was not yet
awaked from his sin. 3. But it pleased God thus long to defer the Prophets
coming unto him, that herein might appear the weakness and impotencie of
our nature, which is never able of it self to rise unto repentance: Osiand. 4.
And God herein also manifests his love toward his elect, in that he will not
suffer them to lie down in their sin, but ever calls them home in time:
Pellic.

3. Quest. Why Nathan speaks to David in a parable
1. Josephus thinks this to be the reason thereof, because Nathan being a
prudent man, considered that Princes were headstrong, dum affectibus suis
rapiuntur, while they are carried with their affections, and therefore he
concealeth at first the threatening of judgment: but Nathan had experience of
David's mild nature, specially in matters to Godward, and therefore this was
not the cause.

2. But Nathan speaks in parable, 1. both to keep a mean and measure in his
reprehension, that it should not be too sharp: Mar. 2. Non invadit durius,
quia praenouerat conuertendum: he does not set upon him roughly, because he
knew that he should be converted: Pellic. 3. And by this kind of covert
speech, David is brought to give sentence against himself.

3. Some think that Nathan spoke this unto David in the hearing and presence
of his captains and Princes: but it is more like that Nathan did admonish him
privately the more easily to win him: Mar.

4. And Nathan revealing unto David his sin in particular, as though he had
bin therein of his counsel, received this direction (no doubt) from the Lord.

5. Though David himself were a Prophet, yet a Prophet is sent unto him,
tanquam medicus ad medicum, sed sanus ad aegrotum: as one Physician to an
other, but the sound to the sick, as Chrysostom says.

4. Quest. v. 4. Of the stranger that came to the rich man.
1. Rupertus by this stranger, understands the devil, who came unto this
rich man David, who would not be entertained, with any of David's own wives,
whom David might lawfully use, but stirs him up to desire strange flesh.

2. Some more fitly by this stranger, would have concupiscence understood,
which should have but a strangers entertainment with us, not be as an
in-dweller: Mart. Osiand.

3. But it is not necessary to press every part of a parable, it is
sufficient if it hold in that, wherein the application consists: as the
purpose of the prophet here is to lay open the wrong which David had done, in
taking his neighbors only wife, himself having many.

5. Quest. v. 5. Whether the sentence of death pronounced by David, were
according to the Law.
The Law of Moses against theft was, that the theife should restore five oxen
for one, and four sheep for one, Exodus 22.1. but here David gives sentence
of death against the oppressor.

1. Some think that David thus speaks only to exaggerate the offense, not
as meaning he should die: like as a Judge may say to show the greatness of
the male-factors offense, that he is worthy of a thousand deaths: but it
appears by Nathans answer afterward unto David upon his repentance, v. 13.
thou shall not die, that David's meaning was, that such an offender indeed was
worthy to die: and so Josephus also understands it.

2. Some answer that it was in the Judges power to add to the punishment, or
take from it pro ratione circumstantiarum, according to the circumstances:
Martyr: which may indeed be safely affirmed in punishments of the same nature
and kind: as in pecuniarie mulcts, and corporal castigations: but to change
the kind of the punishment, as to inflict death upon the malefactor, where the
law imposed not the penalty of death, might seem an open and apparent
transgression of the law.

3. Therefore the best answer is, that even by Moses law, some kind of theft
might be censured with death; as he that did break thorough an house, he might
be slain, Exodus 22.3. this theft then being joined with rapine and violence;
and being a theft of wantonness, not of necessity, as when one steals to
satisfy his hunger, might justly receive the sentence of death.

4. And beside David adiudgeth, that he should restore four fold, according to
the Law, Exodus 22.1. but some understands dubble fourefold, that is
eightfold, because the word arbaghtaim, fowrefold, is put in the duall number:
so Vatab. Pelican. b^t that is no good reason: the like word shobhghathaim,
seauenfold, is likewise put in the duall number, Isay. 30.26. and yet
signifies there only seauenfold, not twice seauenfold: Iun. Indeed, it is
probable, that the Judge might award restitution in a greater proportion then
fourefold, according to the quality of the sin: as Prove. 6.30. The thief,
if he be found, shall restore seauenfold: though some by seauenfold in that
place, understand often: Iun. that the thief as often as he is found, should
make restitution. But in this place there is no necessity so to understand the
word, specially seeing the punishment was aggrauated by the sentence of death.

6. Quest. How God gave David's Lords wives into his bosom.
1. By his Lords wives, to understand women, which were Gods creatures, and so
by the Lord, God himself, is a coact and forced exposition. 2. Some by wives,
understand concubines; and so the Hebrews think that here Michol and Rizpah
are understood, the one Saul^ daughter, the other Saul's concubine, which David
had: so also Pellic. Genevens. 3. Osiander thus expounds, that David had
liberty to take any of Saul's wives or concubines, as he desired, though he did
it not: but it was not lawful for him to marry any of his father in laws
wives: for as it was unlawful to marry the father or mother in law, so also
the husband or wife of the father or mother in law: for there is the same
degree of distance. 4. Pet. Martyr by his Lords wives, understands women
under Saul's subjection: but so any man might have taken Saul's wives, for all
had been subject to Saul: it had been no great privilege to David. 5. Some
make this the meaning, that God delivered into David's bosom, that is, into his
power and subjection, Saul's wives as the dearest things which belonged unto
him: Iun. not to marry them, but to handle them at his pleasure: but the
phrase, to deliver into the bosom, signifies some present fruition, rather
then a powerful subjection of his Lords wives: I prefer then the second
exposition before, that David had his Lords wives, women, or concubines: for so
David's wives, v. 11. are called, c. 16.21. both because Michol his wife was
Saul's daughter, and some of his concubines also David might have.

7. Quest. Whether the Lord do here vpbraid David with the benefits bestowed
upon him.
Whereas Saint James says, God gives to all men liberally, and reproacheth no
man, c. 1.5. and yet the Lord seems here to vpbraid David with the benefits
received: 1. Some answer, that the Apostle speaks only of prayer, that
though one should ask a thousand times of God, he does not put them by, as men
use to say to importunate suitors, that they had that or this granted them
before: but this does not fully satisfy, for the Lord neither in prayer, or
otherwise, is an vpbraider of his benefits.

2. But the Apostles meaning is, that God uses not to cast any in the teeth,
as men use to do, to shame them, and reproach them; God uses a commemoration
of his benefits to an other end, to stir men up to thankfulness, and by the
consideration thereof, to bring them to repentance: to the which end the Lord
puts David in mind here of the benefits which he had conferred upon him.
Mart.

8. Quest. v. 10. How the sword is threatened not to depart from David's house
for ever.
1. Some do extend this time, unto the coming of the Messiah, that the sword
should not depart from David's house until then; but this seems to be against
that rule of Gods justice, who threatens to visit the iniquity of the father
upon the children, only to the third and fourth generation.

2. Some do understand this prophecy of David's posterity, which succeeded in
the kingdom, until the captivity of Babylon: for they were continually
scourged with the sword of the Assyrians, Chaldeans, and other nations: but
this threatening is rather to be referred to the domestical bloody
contentions, that should fall out in David's house among themselves.

3. This prediction therefore was fulfilled in David's house, al David's life
long: Abshalom killed Ammon, Ioab Abshalom, who did rebel against his father:
and Solomon put Adoniah to death: so it came to pass according to Nathans
words, that the sword did not depart from his house for ever, that is, during
his life: for so is the word gholam sometime taken: as, Genesis 43.9. Judah says
to his father, If I bring him not unto thee, etc. let me bear the blame for
ever: that is, as long as I live. Mar.

9. Quest. v. 11. How the Lord is said to have given David's wives, that is,
concubines to Abshalom.
1. This is said to be Gods act, not that the Lord is the author or worker of
any sin: but in these respects. 1. Not only because God did permit Abshalom
so to do, Osiand. neither did hinder him, but withdrew his grace from him. 2.
But further, because God had an ouerruling hand, directing and disposing this
act of Abshaloms to such end, as the Lord intended. 3. And this fact in
Abshalom, must be considered partly as a sin, partly as a punishment of
sin: in which respect God had an hand in it, as it served for the
chastisement of David. 4. Beside, in every act there are two things to be
considered, actio, and defectus, the action, and defect: the natural power of
acting or effecting any thing, is of God; the defect, is from man. Mart.

2. But although God concurred here as a just Judge in the fact of Abshalom,
yet he is no whit therein excused: for he respected not Gods will or counsel
therein; but of a rebellious and despightfull mind, did it to disgrace his
father: as Judas, though Christ were delivered over according to the decree and
determination of God, yet was lead of a covetous and treacherous mind to do
it, and his sin was not any way qualified or lessened thereby.

10. Quest. v. 13. Of David's confession of his sin.
1. There is great difference between the confession of the righteous, and of
hypocrites. 1. In respect of the condition of their persons: the one are
beloved of God, by the grace of election, the other are rejected. 2. In regard
of the end, the one confesses unto salvation, but the other unto destruction;
such was the confession of Judas. 3. The manner of their confession is diverse,
the one in their repentance ha^h hope of forgiveness: the other are driven to
confess of a servile fear without any hope, as Caine and Judas. Borrh.

2. Though David's contrition be short, yet was it effectual, and it proceeded
from a right contrite heart: Saul in many words confessed his sin to Samuel,
yet it was but in hypocrisy.

3. David says he had sinned unto God, because he had no superior Judge in
the earth, that could call him to account. Mart.

11. Quest. v. 14. How David's sin being remitted, yet some punishment is
inflicted upon him.
1. The Romanists upon this example, do ground that assertion of theirs, that
the sin being remitted, the punishment may still remain: which they make
the ground of their purgatorie-paines, where for a while they, whose sins are
pardoned, do yet endure some torment.

2. But this doctrine has no warrant from Gods word: for where God once
remitteth sins, he remembers them no more: they shall not be mentioned,
Esech. 18.22. but if the punishment of sin should remain, there a
remembrance of sin is also revived: wherefore together with the sin, paena
vltionis, the punishment of revenge is remitted: those penalties which remain,
are for the example of others, and the further admonition of the parties
themselves: non sunt paen^ irati, sed amantis Dei, they are the chastisements,
not of an angry, but a loving God. Mar.

12. Quest. Of the diverse punishments of adultery.
The punishment which is imposed upon Adultery, is either divine or humane:
and this is either Civil, or Ecclesiastical: which shall be briefly showed in
their order.

1. The Divine censure, is either that which is grounded upon the law of
nature, or declared more evidently in the Scripture. By the first law of nature
even the Gentiles and others before the law written, judged adultery worthy
of death: as Abimelech decreed, that whosoever touched Isaak or his wife should
die the death, Genesis 26.11. Potiphar adjudged Joseph for the like suspicion,
though most false, unto the place and prison of capital offenders, Genesis 39.
Judah gave sentence that Thamar who had played the whore, being promised, and
so espoused to Selah, to be burned. By the positive and written law of Moses,
the adulterer and adulteress were to die, though the one were not actually
married, but only betrothed, Deuteronomy. 22.23.

2. Humane Civil laws were of diverse sorts; some were corporal in the
chastisment of the body without death. The Egyptians, as witnesses Diodorus
Siculus, did cut off the nose of the adulteress, and did beat the adulterer
with many stripes almost to death. Zalenius among the Locrensians made a law,
that the adulterer should loose both his eyes: and it so falling out, that his
son was taken in adultery, he to satisfy the law, caused one of his sons
eyes to be put out, and one of his own: as Aelianus testifies, lib. 13. Among
the Germans (witness Cornelius Tacitus) the adulteress was stripped naked, her
hair being cut off, and her husband beat her up and down with a staff. The
people called Laciadae, as Suidas, or Placiadae, did punish the adulterer about
his privy parts.

Some punished adultery with public shame, and infamy, as Plutarke writes
how the people Gortinei would bring them forth into public view, Plut. in Prob.
which were taken in adultery, and crown them with wool, showing thereby
their effeminate nature: the Cumians set the adulteress upon a stone, where
she was mocked of all the people, and then carried about upon an ass, and ever
after that was in disdain, called (...), an asse-rider. Among the Romans, the
law of Augustus Caesar, called lex Iulia, thus provided against those which
committed adultery. 1. The adulterer and adulteress were both held as
infamous persons, the adulteress straight after she was deprehended in the
fact, the adulterer after he was publicly condemned. 2. They lost the dowry
and marriage gift. 3. The accuser in this case could not be agreed with for
money, as in other capital crimes. 4. The woman could not accuse the husband
of adultery, but the husband the wife, or her father, or her brethren. 5. It
was not lawful for the man to keep his wife convicted of adultery, but he was
held as a bawd to his own wife: neither was it lawful for any to marry her.
6. By this law, they were punished which did but solicit others to adultery.
7. The soldiers which committed adultery, were discharged from their coulors.

Beside this ignominy and shame among the Romans such incurred, the
adulteress was brought forth publicly in her husbands gown: and sometime
such were condemned to the brothelhouses and stews. But Theodosius abolished
that evil use, least sin should by this means be added unto sin.

Some have punished adultery with death: as the Arabians, as Strabo
witnesses, Among what nations adultery wa^ punished by death.
lib. 16. Saletus the Cratonian made a law, that adulterers should be burned
alive (as Lucianus testifies.) And being himself detected of adultery,
having by an oration in his own defense almost persuaded the people to have
compassion toward him, he voluntarily leaped into the fire. Among the Athenians
it was lawful to kill the adulterer taken in the deed doing, as is evident in
the oration of Lysias, which treats of the death of Eratosthenes the
adulterer. Among the Romans likewise it was lawful so to do in the time of
Cato, before the Julian law: as Seneca in his declamations puts the case of
one, that disinherited his son, because taking his wife with one in
adultery, and bidding him to kill them both, he refused to do it. But
afterward this liberty was restrained: the husband was forbidden to kill his
wife taken in adultery, the adulterer he might; least that men by this means,
might have practiced against their wives.

Further, Julius Caesar put one to death for playing the adulterer with a
certain matrone: Opilius Macrinus used to burn the adulterer and adulteress
together: Aurelianus (as Vopiscus testifies) caused a soldier, which had
defloured his hosts wife, to be rent in sunder by the tops of trees tied to
his body. Augustus caused Proclus to die for adultery: Constantine made a
law, decreeing capital punishment unto adulterers, which continued until the
time of Hierome, who writes of a woman suspected of adultery seven times
smitten with a sword. Justinian after mitigated this law on the part of the
adulteress, Epist ad Innoc.
decreeing such to be beaten with clubbes, and then thrust into a monastery:
but concerning the adulterer, the punishment remained still.

Tiberius banished the adultresse 200. miles out of the city, the adulterer
was expelled out of Italy and Africa. And such were the civil punishments
inflicted upon such as committed adultery. Mart.

3. And such for the most part were the civil ordinances and decrees against
adultery, as we have seen: the Ecclesiastical censures were also of diverse
sorts.

1. In some places they denied the peace of the Church to adulterers, never
admitting them to the communion: some recieued such, but after a long time of
penance: Cypriane misliked their rigor that utterly deny reconciliation unto
them, but altogether exclude them. lib. 4. epistol. c. 2

2. The Ancyrane synod imposed upon adulterers seven years penance, c. 14.
which the Eliberine counsel brought to five years.

3. Ministers and Clergy men committing adultery, were for ever removed from
their ministry. distinct. 81. c. 11.12.

4. The council of Neocaesarea decreed, that if a Ministers wife fell into the
sin of adultery, he should dismiss her, or else leave his Ministry: and
by the Eliberine council, if he did it not, he was denied for ever the
communion of the Church.

5. If a Lay-mans wife were guilty of adultery, he never could be admitted
unto the order of the ministry by the Canons.

6. It was likewise decreed, that the adulterer should not be suffered to marie
with the adulteress.

7. Justinians constitution thrusts the woman offending into a monastery,
and after two years, gives liberty for the husband to take her out: but it
punishes the adulterer with death. And such for the most part also were
Ecclesiastical Constitutions against Adultery.

13. Quest. What may justly be excepted against in the former constitutions
against adultery.
1. In the Civil punishments, which were inflicted among the Heathen, these
things were amiss. 1. They punished adultery with death, leaving other
greater sins unpunished; as their Idolatry, and blasphemy against God,
which was the fountain and very beginning of all uncleanness.

2. They were partial, giving the man liberty to accuse the woman, but the
woman was denied that privilege to accuse the man.

3. They for ever separated the adulterer, and adulteress: whereas the rule of
charity and Christian religion allows reconciliation upon repentance.

2. In the Ecclesiastical Canons, it was to be misliked: 1. That they utterly
denied the communion in some places unto adulterers: for David having repented
of his sin, was received again to the peace of the Church.

2. In that they allowed no reconciliation between a Clergy man and his
adulterous wife: for why should less mercy be showed and practiced among
them, then in other callings and degrees?

3. In utterly making unlawful the marriage between the adulterer, and
adulteress: indeed, if they contracted marriage, the former wife and husband
living, it was not fit: for it might give occasion of suspicion, that they
might practice against, and lie in wait for their life: but such marriages in
other cases being consummate, are not to be dissolved: for then had the
marriage between David and Bathshebah bin unlawful.

4. The greatest fault now is in showing too much lenity to adulterous
persons: they should for a time be excluded from the Church, with the
incestuous young man among the Corinthians, till they are sufficiently
humbled, and upon their tears, and repentance, and true contrition, be
received into the Church again.

14. Quest. Whether an adulterous woman upon her repentance, may not be
received again of her husband.
By the Julian law they were forbidden either to be entertained again of their
husbands, or to be married to another: but it is more agreeable to
Christianity, that there should be reconciliation between the innocent and
offending party, upon her true repentance. And the constitution of Justinian
was more equal in this behalf, which gave liberty unto the man after two
years, to redeem his wife for her adultery condemned to a monastery: the
reasons are these.

1. Augustine thus reasons: Deus est imitandus, etc. God is to be imitated:
lib. 2. ad Pollentium de adult. coni^g.
his people Israel diverse times committed spiritual fornication, and fell
into idolatry: the which the Lord did for a time as dismiss them, and give
them over to the hands of their enemies, but he was again upon their
repentance reconciled unto them.

2. David received his wife Michol, being married to another, wherein she
committed manifest adultery, for there was no divorce before between David
and her.

3. Seeing upon repentance, the adulterous woman is restored unto the kingdom
of God, much more is it fit she should return to the society of her husband;
si regno caelorum restituta est, non potest toro tuo restitui? if she be
restored to the kingdom of heaven, can she not be restored to thy bed?

2. The counsel of Arles decreed further, Extra de ad^^^. c^p. ^1 v^. se^.
si adulteram paenituerit debet vir eum recipere, if the adulterous woman
repent her, the man ought to receive her, the former reasons brought by
Augustine, tend to persuade the lawfulnes and equity in receiving the penitent
offender, not to impose a necessity, as this Canon does: for seeing the Gospel
gives liberty to dismiss the wife for fornication, he sins not that uses
this liberty; yet he does the better, that upon the woman's repentance, Matthew.
5. ^^.
yeldeth somewhat of his strict and rigorous right, to receive her again.

3. But where the party offending has no remorse, there if the innocent
party should admit of a reconciliation, he should seem to be particeps
iniquitatis, partaker of the sin, as the said Counsel resolves.

15. Quest. Whether a man ought to accuse his wife being dismissed for
adultery.
1. It is here to be considered, whether the party offending continue in the
sin of adultery still; for in this case, after private admonition by friends,
taking no place, Christ's rule then is to be followed, to tell it to the Church,
that by public authority the party may be reclaimed and amended.

2. Though the party be penitent, yet if the sin be notorious and public,
and the innocent party therein should seem, by silence and conniuence to
boulster out the others sin: or if there be an adulterous seed, which is
like to be taken for the heir of the family, if the sin be kept secret: in
these cases the Church is to be made acquainted, for the preventing of both
these mischiefs.

3. Where none of these dangers are feared, it is better for the innocent
party to follow Joseph's example, who thought secretly to send Marie away,
being yet ignorant, how she became with child. P. Martyr.

16. Quest. Whether adultery be a more grievous sin in the man, or the woman.
1. Some do thus object, to show that the sin is greater on the woman's
behalf: 1. Because by the Julian law among the Romans, it was lawful for the
man to accuse the woman of adultery, but not for the woman to accuse the man:
and before that law it was lawful for the man to kill his wife taken in
adultery, but not for the woman to do the like to the man.

2. It was lawful by the ancient Roman laws for the man to divorce or
separate his wife, but not for the wife to be divorced from her husband.

3. By the law of Vespasian, as Suetonius writes, the woman that did company
with a servant, became her self bound, but the like servitude was not laid
upon the man offending in the like.

4. In Ecclesiasticus, cap. 7.27. and in other places of that book, great
charge is given unto parents to keep their daughters; but the like care is not
enjoined for their sons.

Contra. These arguments may easily be answered. 1. These were but humane laws,
and some of them were unjust and cruel; as to give liberty to men to slay
their wives taken in adultery: and the Romans themselves by the Julian law
abolished that cruel custom: the other laws, which give pre-eminence unto
the man, respected the politic state, which was more hindered, by the
adultery of women, in the confusion of families, and suborning of false
heirs: in which respect indeed, the fault is greater on the woman's side.

2. So also it was made lawful by some Imperial laws, for the women to seek
divorce and separation from their husbands: as appears by the law of
Theodosius.

C. de repudijs in L. Cons.
3. The Roman laws did more punish the woman's offense, for the aforesaid
reason, because the politic state received greater damage thereby.

4. Parents also are there charged to give unto their sons good education:
but the daughters are more carefully to be kept, because by their fall, their
fathers house is defiled.

2. Now that the man's offense is the greater, it may be thus argued. 1. because
the woman's sex is weaker, and so much the more to be pitied. 2. The man is the
head of the woman, and ought to give her a good example. 3. The marriage faith
is mutually given, and therefore it is broken on the man's behalf as well as
the woman's. 4. Men usually are agents and entisers of women, and they are
entised.

3. Wherefore the best resolution is this, that in respect of the mutual bond
of marriage and faith of each given to other, the offense on both sides is
equal; but their persons considered, the man sins more, because he is the
head. And in regard of the commonwealth, the woman's fault is more dangerous,
in the confusion of families, and in obtruding false and supposed heirs.

Now yet the causes why the woman's offense is counted more odious, the case
being the same, are rendered to be these two: quia viri liberius agunt and non
habent peccata latentia vindictam, the men are more ready and free to accuse
their wives: women are not so forward, Cause. 32. qu 5. cap. 23.
being restrained by the modesty of their sex; and the men's faults are more
secret, and so escape unpunished: See more of this question, as likewise,
whether adultery is to be punished by death, to the which opinion P. Martyr
enclineth here, Hexapl. in Exodus qu. 8.9. upon the seventh commandment. c.
20. but somewhat of the same question shall here be inserted.

17. Quest. Whether the sin of adultery ought to be punished by death.
1. P. Martyr labors by these reasons, to prove the affirmative part.

1. Death by the law of Moses is inflicted upon the adulterous persons, Leuit.
20.10. the adulterer, and adulteress are both to die.

2. The order of the commandments shows as much; for all the transgressions
of the first table, as idolatry, blasphemy, violating of the Sabbath, and of
the two first commandments of the second table, as disobedience to parents,
murder, were punished by death, so also adultery: then at the eight
commandment the sword staieth, so likewise neither the 9. or 10. commandment
were enforced with the penalty of death.

3. Seeing adultery is more against the politic state, then theft simply, it
should rather be punished by death, then the other: for who had not rather
loose part of his goods, then his wife her honesty?

many intricate questions do arise: as whether by divorce the band of marriage
be dissolved: whether it be lawful to marry after divorce: whether the
innocent party only is to be suffered to marry: whether the parties offending
ought to be reconciled.

5. By the lenity of punishment adulteries increase, and this vice grows to
be public and common.

Contra. 1. That law of Moses was judicial and politic: it specially
concerned the policy and state of that commonwealth, as shall be showed
afterward: therefore it simply binds not now.

2. Neither does the sword bear sway now under the Gospel, in the punishing of
the transgressions of all the former commandments unto the seventh by death:
for it were too much rigor, to give sentence of death for every breach of the
Sabbath, or for every disobedience to Parents: neither does the sword stay at
the 8. commandment: for some kind of theft by the law of God is judged
worthy of death, as follows presently to be showed: and some kind of false
witness: for he was to be done unto, as he thought to do unto his brother,
Deuteronomy. 19.18. If he were a false witness against his brothers life, his own
life should be paid for it.

3. Adultery is more against the commonwealth, then simple theft: but not then
every kind of theft. And there are four kinds of theft by the law of God
censured by the sentence of death. 1. theft of men, Exodus 21.16. 2. theft with
violence, as breaking into an house, Exodus 22.3. and of the same sort is all
kind of robbery. 3. sacrilege, the stealing of things consecrated to holy
things; which was Achans case, Ios. 7.4. and wanton theft, when one steals
not of necessity to satisfy his hunger, but of wantonness: as he which
having many sheep of his own, took his poor neighbors only sheep, 2.
Sam. 12.3. David judges such an one worthy of death.

4. Such questions are not superfluous and unnecessary: for then our blessed
Savior would not have meddled with them, to show in what cases it was lawful
for a man to dismiss his wife, and marry another, Matthew. 5. and 19.

5. It is not for that adultery is not punished by death, but because either
straight punishments are not laid upon adulterers, and too much lenity is
showed, that this sin so ouerfloweth in the world.

2. Now on the contrary it may thus be reasoned, that adultery is not now
necessarily to be sentenced by death.

1. Moses Judicials do not now necessarily bind, but in regard of the moral
equity of them: P. Martyr says, non magis not astringere ciuiles leges, etc.
quam cermoniales: but that cannot be safely affirmed: for Moses ceremonialls
are absolutely and simply abrogated, and to revive them, were to violate and
infringe the liberty of the gospel: but the Iudicialls are left indifferent,
Christian Magistrates as they are not simply bound to retain them, so they may
use them as they see it to be fitting to the commonwealth: Now that this was
one of the Iudicialls of Moses, it is evident by this: because it was peculiar
to that state and policy, that the tribes and families should be
distinguished and not confounded or mixed together: therefore it was fit that
adultery should be severely punished, by the which comes the confusion of
houses, corruption of blood, subornation of false heirs.

2. Other judicial and penal laws annexed to the moral precepts, are not
now in force: as to put to death every one that violateth the Sabbaticall
rest, or every one that is stubburne against their Parents.

3. By Moses law only that adultery was punished which was committed with an
other wife, Leuit. 20.10. for the man to take a concubine to his wife, or one
wife to another, was not then counted adultery, nor yet was punished by death;
for then it would follow, that Abraham, Jacob, David, with others under the law
that had many wives, or some concubines beside their wives, lived in adultery,
which is no ways to be admitted: and the word adulterium, properly signifies,
alterius adire thorum, to go unto an others bed. But now seeing Adultery is
either simplex, simple, when one of the parties is married, or duplex
adulterium, double adultery, when both parties are married: there is no
warrant from Moses law to punish single adultery on the man's behalf with
death.

4. Our blessed Savior, Ioh. 8.11. did dismiss the adulterous woman, not
giving direction, that she should be stoned to death. But here diverse answers
are made. 1. That because they came to tempt Christ, either to accuse him of
too much severity in condemning her, and so he should loose the favor of the
people, who commended him for his clemency: or as a transgressor of the law,
if he freed her: he does so answer the Pharisees, as that they should neither
way have advantage against him. 2. He does not condemn her, because he meddled
not with the Magistrates office. 3. He saw her penitent, and therefore
absolueth her. 4. He was no witness of her sin, and therefore could not
accuse her. Mart.

Contr. 1. Our blessed Savior did not ambitiously seek the favor of the
people, that he needed in that behalf to suspend his judgment concerning the
rigor of Moses law: they could have taken no exception unto Christ, in
ratifying of Moses law, if it had pleased him, that the rigor thereof should
have remained still: therefore that was not the cause of his silence therein.

2. Though as a Magistrate he would not inflict punishment, yet as a teacher
he might have given direction, as he did in an other case concerning the bill
of divorce, Matthew. 19.

3. The inward repentance did not dispense with the outward punishment, which
was for the example of others.

4. Christ needed not in this case to be a witness: for there were other
witnesses beside, that said she was taken in the very deed doing: yet though
he neither took upon him to be witness, accuser, or judge in this case, our
Blessed Savior might, and in all liklihood would have given direction to take
a course according to Moses law, if his will had been to have that observed as
a perpetual law.

5. Wherefore this is most probable, that although our blessed Savior by this
his silence, intended not altoge^her to abrogate Moses law, yet it pleased him
well it should not be so rigorously executed, when he said, let him that is
among you without sin cast the first stone at her. lib. ^. ad Poll. c. 6, 7.
This place is by Augustine urged to the same end, to show, that adultery is
not necessarily to be met withal by death. And in an other place he makes
this application of it, that Christ being two ways urged by the Pharisees; if
he bid her to be stoned to death, they would accuse his severity; if he set
her free, they would blame his lenity: therefore Christ gives such an answer,
as might prevent both these exceptions; in that he says, let him that is
without sin, etc. iustitiae vox est, ^om. 10. ser. 47.
puniatur peccator, sed non a peccatoribus, etc. let the offender be punished,
but not by them which are likewise offenders: audiamus etiam mansuetudinis
vocem, etc. let us hear also the voice of clemency, neither do I condemn
thee: not that Christ did wink at sin, sed damnauit, non hominem sed
peccatum, he condemned, not the party, but the sin, saying, Go, sin no
more.

6. S. Paul also, whereas the law of Moses decrees him to be put to death,
that should lie with his fathers wife, Leuit. 20.11. yet makes no mention of
any such punishment to be imposed upon the incestuous young man, that had taken
his fathers wife, 1. Cor. 5. and 2. Cor. 2. If it be answered, that the
Christians had no believing Magistrates then, but the sword was in the hand of
Pagans; yet in such civil punishments, it was the Apostles mind, that they
should submit themselves to the civil power: for he was the Minister of God, to
take vengeance on him that did evil, Romans 13.4.

7. Wherefore it is evident, that no certain punishment is appointed under the
Gospel for adultery: but that it is free for every state to punish it either
by death, or by some other grievous censure, according to the quality of the
sin: As the Egyptian law was to cut off their noses, and to disfigure them;
the Germans beat them with cudgels; Tiberius banished them. By these or any
like courses, adultery may be sharply enough punished: only the fault is, when
by too much lenity and conniuence, men make but a sport of this sin.

18. Quest. v. 14. Of Nathans words to David, thou shall not die.
1. There are three kinds of death; a natural end, a violent death, and
everlasting death in the next world: from these two last, David is delivered;
that neither he should die eternally, nor presently by the sword, or by Gods
hand, as he had cause to fear: Mart. 2. Wherein the Lord shows him me^cy, in
reuersing the sentence which he had given against himself before: Borrh. 3.
And thus much is insinuated, that he should not die for this, but others of his
house, as his child, in whom he seemed in some part to die: Mart. and though
he should not die, yet he was to endure amariora morte, things more bitter
then death: Pelican. 4. And here appears the difference of the law, which in
David says, he was the child of death: and of the Gospel, which by Nathan
says, thou shall (...) die: Borrh.

19. Quest. v. 14. How David is said to have caused the enemies of God to
blaspheme.
1. Some understand it of the perverse and wicked men in Israel, that would
take occasion hereby to accuse the Lord of injustice, for preferring David
before Saul, who was not detected of any such sin of adultery: But they
properly could not be said to be the enemies of God; he means such as were
professed adversaries.

2. Pet. Martyr refers it to the triumph of the Ammonites, who put the
Israelites to flight, and slew diverse of them together with Vriah, and so
thereby were occasioned to insult against God.

3. Vatablus expounds it thus, that they should blaspheme God, because he had
set up a wicked man to be king.

4. But the better sense is, to understand it of the general reproach of
religion: that the Gentiles seeing David commit such sins, as were odious
among the^, should thereby take occasion to condemn the religion it self as
false, and not him to be true God, whom they worshipped. Borrh.

20. Quest. v. 14. Why the child dies borne in adultery.
1. The children may temporally and corporally be punished for the sins of
their parents, who themselves are touched when they see the misery of their
children: Osiand. 2. But none shall suffer for an other eternal punishment:
Mart. 3. And much unlike are Gods judgments unto the civil laws of men: for
here the child is not to suffer for the parents offense: with God it is
otherwise, before whom none is innocent. Borrh. 4. And if the child were
altogether faultlesse, no punishment could lie upon him: but seeing the infant
has original sin, and is a part of the parents, God may most justly in his
secret judgment hasten that end sooner, which by the course of nature every
one is subject unto: Borrh. 5. And God in his wisdom did take away this
child, because he should have lived but to be a shame unto David. Mart.

21. Quest. v. 16. Why David be sought the Lord for the child, whom the Prophet
said should die.
David does not herein oppose himself to Gods will. 1. He might think that
this commination was conditional, that upon his tears and repentance, the
Lord might reuerse his sentence, as he did when Hezekiah was sick, and when
Jonas preached against the Ninivites.

2. And although these examples followed after David's time, yet there were the
like before: as David might remember, how the Lord commanded Abraham to
sacrifice his son, yet it pleased him otherwise: and the Lord threatened to
destroy Israel, but he was entreated to spare them at the intercession of
Moses, Numb. 14.

3. And David herein only showed his natural affection, still subordinating
his prayer to the will of God: as Christ did to show his humane condition, when
he prayed that the cup might pass from him.

4. Hereby also David shows his confidence, how sure and certain he was, that
the Lord had pardoned his sin, seeing he was bold to make intercession for
his son. Pel.

22. Quest. v. 18. Upon what seventh day the child died: and what is gathered
thereupon.
1. Borrhaius says it was the seventh day of his sickness, which is a
critical day: for then the sickness usually abateth or increases more: But
this being a sickness sent of god upon this child, there was no use of any such
natural observation: therefore it is agreed by the Hebrews, that it was the
seau^nth day from the birth of the chi^d: so also Iun. Mart.

2. Now in that this child dying upon the seventh day was not circumcised, and
yet David was cheared after the child's death, a^ not doubting of the salvation
thereof: David was not then of that mind, which the Romanists are of now, to
think his child damned for want of circumcision, as they hold all infants
dying without baptism to be excluded heaven: But, gratia non est alligata
symboli^: Gods grace is not ^ied unto the sign. Controv. The contemp^, not the
want of baptism condemns.
The Romanist^ themselves allow of that disti^ction of baptism, fluminis,
flaminis, sanguinis, the baptism of water, of the spirit, of blood: that the
martyrdom of the Saints, that shed their blood for Christ, the inward work of
the spirit, supplyeth in many the want of baptism by water. Mart. Pellic.

3. We see by this president, that God may often refuse his own servants in
temporal things; for David obtained not his petition here. Osiand.

4. And in that this child lives not, but Solomon next borne lived, therein is
shadowed forth the old man, which must die in the members of Christ, and the
new man, which must live unto God, Borrh.

23. Quest. v. 20. Whether David was not unclean, and his house, by the dead
corpse of the child.
1. Whereas there is a Law, Numb. 19.14. that when one died in a tent, all that
came into the tent, and whatsoever was in the tent, should be unclean seven
days: and yet David presently after the death of the infant, washed himself;
and went up into the house of God: the places are thus reconciled; that David's
house must be supposed to be very large; the very place where the child died
was unclean, as the tent was wherein any died: but it is like, that David came
not at that place, nor near the infant: All his house could not thereby be
made unclean; for the Ark of God was at this time in David's house, in a
Tabernacle which David had prepared for it. Martyr.

24. Quest. v. 23. Why David leaves weeping, the child being dead.
1. One reason was, because Gods will now appeared, that he would not retract
his former decree concerning the death of the child: Osiand. for then if he had
continued praying still, he should seem to have spurned against Gods will. 2.
Though Abraham believed that God could have raised up Izaak from the dead, when
he was commanded to sacrifice him: Hebr. 11.19.
yet David had no such hope here, because he had no such promise of this
child, as Abraham had of Izaak: Mart. 3. An other reason why David cease
mourning, is because no singular thing had befallen the child: he was borne to
die, and David himself should also follow after. Pellic.

4. Some do gather a third reason, why David stays mourning, because he was
persuaded the child was well: for he says, he should go unto him: but of his
own salvation he doubted not: the rest of our writers do interpret this
phrase generally, of being dead: as likewise that which the counterfeit Samuel
said to Saul, to morrow thou and thy sons shall be with me. 1. Sam. 28.18.
But I rather think, with Augustine, that the special estate and condition of
the dead is thereby insinuated: and thereupon he does collect, that it was not
true Samuel, which appeared to Saul, because he tells a lie: Ad Simplic. lib.
2. qu. 3.
for, magno intervallo separari bonis a m^lio legimus, etc. we find, that the
good are a great way separated from the evil in the next world. And this
phrase is like to that when the Patriarche^ are said to be gathered to their
people: See Hexapl. in Genes. c. 25. qu. 15.
that is, not only dead, but in the state of grace, associate unto the blessed
company of Saints in heaven.

5. But why does not David mourn for this infant, and yet made such
lamentation for Saul, Jonathan, Abner, Absalom? David mourned for some of them,
because the commonwealth sustained great loss by them; and for others, because
they died in their sins, as Absalom: here is no such cause in respect of the
one, or the other. Mart.

6. This example of David in praying for the living child, but ceasing to pray
for him being dead, evidently conuinceth the error of the Romanists, Controv.
Against p^ayer for the dead.
who make superstitious prayers and intercessions for the dead: David here
shows, that it is in vain to pray for them which are departed: Borrh. Mart.

25. Quest. v. 24. How David comforted Bathsheba, now called his wife.
1. Bathsheba was in heaviness, not only for the death of the child, but
because of the sin which they had committed; and therefore David did his part
to comfort her: Osiand. 2. The Hebrews think, that Bathsheba refused to
company with David, least that child might have died as the former did, and
therefore David told her, that this child was borne unto the kingdom, and that
the Messiah should come of him: whereupon she required David to swear unto her
that he should be king. But as it is certain, that David did swear unto her
for this matter, 1. King. 1.30. so it is uncertain, whether it was at this
time: her name indeed signifies, the daughter of an oath: but she was so
called before this oath was made unto her by David. 3. The special comfort
that David ministered unto her, was in declaring unto her, how God had forgiven
them their sin: Mart. 4. This also is to be noted, that whereas at the birth
of the first child conceived in adultery, she was called the wife of Vriah, v.
15. now the Lord having forgiven their sin, and ratified the marriage, she is
called David's wife. Pellic.

26. Quest. v. 24. Of Salomons name, who gave it him, and why.
1. Here David is said to call his name Solomon; but, 1. Chron. 22.9. the Lord
is said also to have given him that name: so David gave it by direction from
God, by the hand, that is, ministry of his Prophet Nathan: by whom also the
Lord sent and called him by an other name, Iedidiah, that is, beloved of God.
Some understand, that David sent the child by Nathans hand, that is, committed
the education of him to the Prophet: Osiand. But it is evident, Prou. 31. in
the title, that Solomon in his infancy and childhood, was brought up under his
mother Bathshebah, and he was yet too young to be committed to any other.

2. And here it is to be observed, that the Lord uses the ministry of
Nathan, as before in sending an heavy message to David, so now in bringing
comfortable news: as Isaias to Hezekiah was a messenger both to tell him of
death, and again of the prolonging of his days, least there might be thought
some difference and variance between the Prophets, if the Lord should have
used any other messengers then them. Mart.

3. And in that Solomon is called Iedidiah, beloved of God, it may be an
argument of his eternal salvation: that he was not a reprobate or castaway,
but was renewed again after his fall by repentance.

4. These two names, Solomon and Iedidiah, signify the one peace, which Israel
enjoyed under Salomons reign, and the love of God toward Solomon: this latter
more was given him, baghabur jehovah, for the Lord, that is, for Christ's sake,
in whom he was acceptable unto God; Iun. and of whom he was a lively type,
both in respect of the spiritual peace of Christ's kingdom, and he was indeed
the only beloved son of God. Borrh.

27. Quest. v. 27. What city of waters it was that Ioab had taken.
1. Ioab continued almost a year in besieging the city of Rabbah, which was
the chief city of the kingdom: for it was no marvel, that God gave him no
better success abroad, David having so displeased him by his sin at home:
and David also being lulled asleep, and giving himself to pleasure, had no
care to set forward that public business. Mart.

2. This city of the kingdom called afterward the city of waters, as some
think, was an other city beside: Emman. Sa. but it is evident, v. 29. that it
was the same city.

3. Some think that the city consisted of diverse parts, whereof one that was
environed with water, and so stronger then the rest, was held by the king,
which Ioab had now taken: Borrh. Vatab. Osiand. as the city Syracuse had four
parts, like four little cities: one was called Insula, the Island, an other
Acrodina, the third Tychia, the fourth Neapolis: Mart. But though Ioab had
taken some part, as it might be the base towns or suburbs: yet it is evident
that he had not taken the chief part, for afterward David came and besieged
Rabbah, and took it, where the king was, whose crown he took to himself.

4. Therefore Iunius interpretation here is more fit: that he took the city
of waters, that is, by a certain figure called hypallage, the waters of the
city: and so Josephus says, praecisis aquae ductibus, the conduits of water
being cut off, the city was in great distress, pinched both with hunger and
thirst: so that it was an easy matter now to take it.

5. Ioab as he was a companion of David in all his afflictions, so now he is
studious of David's honor, and would not have this victory ascribed unto
himself. Pelican.

28. Quest. v. 30. Of the King of Ammons crown which David took from his head.
1. It seems that it was the use of Kings in those days, to wear their
crowns in battle, as Saul had his crown with him, when he was slain in
battle, which the Amalekite took and brought to David: And so here the kings
crown was taken from him, and set upon David's head.

2. It was a very massy crown, it waighed a talent of gold: which Budeus
valueth at 7700. French crowns of gold: Munster at 18000. French crowns:
Osiander at 1^594. Rhene pieces of gold: but this estimation is too great; the
ordinary talent being set but at 60. pound weight of gold. Iun.

3. It was too massy to be worn upon any ones head: for there was as much
gold in it, as went to the making of the golden candlestick in the Sanctuary,
Exodus 25. therefore some think that there was a load stone in the crown, and
so it was drawn up with iron, and hung in the air: but this is a mere
devise. Hierome takes here the word molcham, which is translated their king,
for their idol Milchom, for so they used to set crowns upon their gods heads:
but the word is molcham, their king, not milchom, which was the name of the
idol: this massy crown therefore was not usually worn, but it was a crown
of estate, which was only set upon the heads of their kings at their
coronation, and other solemn times.

4. Now David converted this crown to his private use, and yet transgresses
not that commandment, whereby they were charged not to bring into their houses
the things consecrated to idols, Deuteronomy. 7.25. not because David took it not
himself, but it was brought unto him by an other, which is R. Chimhi his
conceit: for if it were not lawefull to take it himself, neither was it
lawefull to receive it at an others hands: But that charge was only concerning
the idolatrous implements of the Cananites, which they were not to meddle with:
the spoils of other nations they might take, so that they purged them with
water or fire: and so they converted to their use the spoil of the Madianites,
Numb. 31.23. Lyran. Mart.

5. This falls out just upon this uncivil King, that as he had cut the
beards and garments of David's messengers, so he is spoiled of his princely
robes, and his head is left naked without a crown. Borrh.

29. Quest. v. 31. Of David's casting the Ammonites into the tile-kill.
1. The most do so translate the word bemalchen, into the tile furnace: as
Pagnin. Vatab. Mart. Osiand. Pellic. Latin. B. G. And some understand it for
the streets, where the houses were covered with tiles; some for the furnace it
self: but then they for malchen, must read malbhen, changing the letter
cheth, into the letter beth; deriuing the word of laban, which signifies a
brick, or tile: but it is very dangerous to make any such innovation and
change in the words of the Text.

2. Montanus makes it a proper name, Malchon, which Iunius expounds, the
furnace of Molech their Idol; which is most like: that herein the justice of
God might appear, that as they consecrated their sons thorough the fiery
furnace unto Molech their idol, so they themselves are justly thrown into it.

30. Quest. v. 31. Of David's austeritie in putting the Ammonites under sawes,
and under harrowes, whether he therein did well.
1. We shall find that the servants of God employed to fight his battles, did
show the like examples of severity upon the enemies of God. The Israelites cut
off Adonibezeks thumbes of his hands and feet, Iud. 1. Gedeon did tear the
men of Succoth with briers and thorns, Judge. 8.16. And yet herein they
offended not, neither are reprehended in Scripture.

2. So David in this place did execute the will and commandment of God upon
this idolatrous people, and therefore therein he sinned not.

3. They are cruel, which without cause do show severity, and delight in
blood: but this sharp course, which David follows belongs unto justice:
the Ammonites were guilty of most grievous trespasses: 1. Beside the old
grudge which they had against the people of God, in not releeuing them in the
wilderness, when they came out of Egypt. 2. They had broken and violated the
law of nations, in abusing David's messengers. 3. They had taken occasion by the
slaughter of Vriah, and others, to blaspheme, and insult against God. 4. They
had disturbed all the nations round about, stirring them up, and hiring them to
join with them against David, c. 10. 5. Beside, they were most cruel and vile
idolaters, sacrificing their own children to their abominable Idol Molech;
therefore they were thus worthily punished. Mart.

4. Josephus thinks, that thus he served every one, as well in this city, as
in others: but that appears to be otherwise, c. 17.27. for Shabi an other
son of Nahash out of Rabbah of the Ammonites succored David, when he was
pursued of Absalon: therefore it is like he thus served the principal, which
had been ringleaders in this mischief. Osiand.

5. Herein David also was a type of the Messiah, which should be revenged to
the full of the contemners of his word. Borr.

CHAP. 13.
1. Quest. Of the chasticements which were laid upon David for his former
offenses.
1. AS Nathan had before told David of two grievous crosses, that the sword
should not depart from his house, and that his own concubines should be
defiled by another, as he had committed two grievous sins of murder, and
adultery, so Gods justice which sleeps not begins now to show it self:
three great calamities follow one in the neck of another; the deflouring of
Thamar by Amnon, and his slaughter by Absalom, the defiling of David's
concubines by Absalom, and his unnatural rebellion against his father. Borrh.
2. And in this first punishment, David is paid home by the law of retalion: as
he killed Vriah, having first committed adultery with his wife, and betrayed
Vriah into his enemies hand: so here his daughter is ravished, his son Amnon
slain, and that also in the same manner by the treachery of his brother. 3.
Thus in David's family, who was a worshipper of God, those foul enormities
break forth, which shows, that the Church of God is not perfect here in
earth, but many offenses may be raised even among the people of God: whereby
appears the error of the old Novatians, and Donatists, and of the new
Brownists (so called) which do separate themselves from the Church of God,
because of the imperfections thereof. Mart.

2. Quest. v. 2. Of Amnons unlawful love of his sister Thamar.
Among other unclean acts none are more odious, then incestuous copulations,
when within the degrees forbidden any dishonest act is attempted: which
incestuous conjunctions either by marriage or otherwise, are restrained for
diverse reasons.

1. One is for the reverence which is to be yielded unto our kindred, not to
come near them to uncover their shame: as Valerius Maximus writes, that it
was unlawful, for the father and his daughter to wash themselves one in the
sight of another.

2. Again, by this restraint and prohibition, the families are kept chaste:
whereas if such commixtions between kindered were permitted, every house would
be defiled.

3. By this means love is increased by marriage with strange families:
whereas, if marriage were lawful in the same kindred, many loves would be
swallowed up together, both the natural and matrimonial love.

4. Yea we see that such conjunctions are against the law of nature: for even
the more civil nations among the heathen, abhorred to come near their own
kindred.

5. But above all, the law of God ought to take place, which most straightly
forbids such incestuous marriages, Leuit. 28.20. and though the laws of men
should be silent herein, the judgment of God will overtake such: as is
manifest here in the example of Amnon. So in the Roman Histories, Claudius
that defiled his sister, was slain of Milo: and Domitiane the Emperor guilty
of the like fault, was also slain.

6. Thus David is chastened in the deflouring of his daughter, and in the
slaughter of his son: wherein the Lord does judge him not only for the
adultery and murder, which he had committed, but for his rash marriage, which
he made with Maacah the mother of Absalom, the daughter of an idolatrous king.
c. 3.3. Mart.

3. Quest. v. 2. Of Amnons impotent affections, and of his loue-sickenesse.
1. There were two reasons of Amnons pining away, because two ways was his
desire hindered: Thamar was his sister, and therefore he could not marry her;
and she was a virgin, and most surely kept: Osiand.

2. His affection thus languishing, his body was distempered: for the
affections are in the grossest and basest part of the mind, which has greatest
affinity with the body; and thereof it is, that the vehemency of the
affections brings the body into weaknesses, and diseases.

3. It is written that Seleucus, when his son Antiochus was in love with his
stepmother his fathers wife, and pined away for love, by the persuasion of the
Physician Erasistratus, his father was content to part with his wife, and give
her unto his son, rather then he should languish unto death: But Amnon could
not expect for the like at his fathers hand, being a man that feared God.

4. The Heathen say, there are three remedies against inordinate love: (...):
hunger and abstinence; time, that men should not hastily give way unto their
affections, but do all with mature deliberation: and the third is an halter:
such was their doctrine, that ended with despair: but Amnon here neglected
indeed the right means, namely these, first in time to have resisted his
affections, and not to have given way unto them: Pelican. secondly, to have
given himself to abstinence and some honest exercises, which might have
occupied his mind: then by some lawful matrimonial love, to have overcome his
unlawful lust, and to have prayed unto God for grace. Mar.

4. Quest. v. 5. Of Ionadabs wicked counsel.
1. Ionadab is called here Amnons friend: but indeed he was his foe: for a true
friend will neither give dishonest counsel, nor yet do any dishonest thing for
his friend. Bor. 2. He is also called cacham, a wise and prudent man: but it
was carnal, not spiritual wisdom: such a wise man, as the Prophet speaks
of, they are wise to do evil, but to do well, they have no knowledge: Ierem.
4.22. 3. For in wise counsel two things must be considered, that both the end
of a man's counsel be good, and that the means thereunto tending are also
honest and lawful: but Ionadabs counsel failed in both. Mart. 4. Such
flattering counselors abound in Princes courts, who are ready for their own
advancement to serve the humors of great men, and by their crafty heads do
devise how to compass their desire: Pelican.

5. Quest. v. 12. Of Thamars reasons and persuasions to Amnon.
1. First she alleges, that it was and unusual crime in Israel, which he
offered, either to corrupt a virgin, or to commit fornication out of marriage,
much more for one to corrupt his sister. Pelican. 2. Thou she shows the
inconvenience in respect of himself* he should be counted as one of the
fools of Israel, as a lewd and wicked person: Genevens. and a^ a man unmeet
to succeed his father in the kingdom being his eldest son; Mart. 3. In
respect of her self, it would be a perpetual shame unto her: she could not
hide or conceal that lewdness, if she should be with child by him. Osiander.
4. Then from entreating, she falls to advise and counsel him; that he would
speak unto her father, to give her unto him, But all these reasons would not
content or satisfy his wicked mind: he still proceeded in his vile purpose to
have his will of her. 5. Now whereas the law was, that the virgin which was
forced in the town should cry out, Deuteronomy. 22.24. it is like that Thamar cried
out, but none would come to deliver her; or that Amnon kept her from crying.
Some think that she held her peace, because she would not bring her brother to
shame, or upon hope of marriage: but hope of marriage she could have none,
because it was against the Law, and she was more to respect her own fame, and
honest name, then her brothers.

6. Quest. v. 23. Why Thamar says, he will not deny me unto thee, seeing it
was against the Law.
1. Lyranus with some others is of opinion, that Thamar was not David's daughter
by Maacah, but that she was with child by another, when David took her captive
in battle, and so Thamar being neither Amnons sister by father or mother,
might be Amnons wife. But this is not like, for Amnon called her his sister, v.
6. and it seems that Thamar was borne after Absalom; as the phrase gives,
when Absalom had a sister: or, when to Absalom was a sister, v. 1. Iun. D.
Chimhi thinks also, that Thamar was David's daughter: but conceived by him
before she was converted to the faith of Israel.

2. Pelican gives this exposition: that Thamar secretly understood this
condition, si fieri posset, if it might be, David would not deny her to him:
if it could not be done by marriage, much more unlawful was it out of marriage.

3. But it is more like, that by this means, she did dilationem quaerere,
seek delays only, and to gain time: Iun. vt conatum adolescentis eluderet,
to put off the young man's purpose. Osiand. Mart. For if she might have been
Amnons wife, he needed not to have languished after her, and have used such
indirect means: and he should have married her after, or paid her dowry:
neither of which was done. Mar.

7. Quest. Whether this degree of consanguinitie, or any other might have been
dispensed with.
By occasion of these words of Thamar to Amnon, which sound as though David
might have given Thamar to Amnon to wife, occasion i^ ministered briefly to
consider, whether any of the forbidden degrees may be dispensed with.

1. The Popes Canonists, and Canonical Divines do hold, Contr. The degrees
forbidden Leuit 19.20. can not be dispensed with.
that the prohibition only is natural and moral between the father and the
daughter, the mother and the son, that their marriage cannot be dispensed
with, because they are one flesh: but all the other degrees may be dispensed
with: for Adams sons took their sisters to wives, Jacob married two sisters,
Sarah was Abraham's niece: Iacobed Moses mother was Amram his fathers aunt. So
it is their opinion, that the Pope may dispense with all degrees, saving
between the father and daughter, mother and son: as Caietan. And the
practice of the Papal Church has been accordingly, In Thom. 2.2. qu. 154.
art. 9.
Emmanuel king of Portugal, married two sisters: Catharine Queen of England
two brothers: Ferdinandus King of Naples by license from Pope Al^xand^r the 6.
married his own Aunt. And Martin^ the ^. did dispense with the marriage of the
germane and natural sister.

2. But this is a most gross opinion: 1. All these prohibitions are moral and
natuturall: for the Cananites were cast out for such abominations, who were not
bound to Moses Iudicialls. 2. The necessity of those times dispensed with
those first marriages, when there were no other to marry with: and God in
respect of that necessity gave a relaxation, saying, increase and multiply.
3. The facts of the fathers cannot be excused from all imperfection: yet it was
Iaacobs intent to marri^ but one, Laban by his subtlety imposed the other upon
him. 4. These were the sins of the Heathen. Among the Persians the sons
married with their mothers, the daughters with their fathers: it was lawful
among the Athenians for one to marry his sister. Berosus writes that the
Giants of the old world refrained not such marriages. Caracalla said to his
mother in law, O that it were lawful: the impudent woman answered; si libet,
licet, imperator dat leges, non accipit: if you li^t, it is lawful: for an
Emperor gives laws to others, he takes none himself: ex Martyr.

8. Quest. v. 15. Of Amnons hatred of his sister.
1. Aristotle in his Problemes gives this reason why inordinate love is many
times turned to hatred: as Potiphars wife, when she could not have her desire
hated Joseph, as much as she loved him: and Nero after he had abused his own
mother, so hated her that he killed her. The reason hereof Philosophers yield
to be this: because the body is much altered in such acts of raging and
burning lust, and the affection is changed withal. But if the reason hereof
were natural, it would always have the same effect: yet it has not: for
after that Shechem had ravished Dinah Jacobs daughter, he loved her ardently
still, and affected her marriage.

2. R. Kimhi, and R. Solomon, think that this was the cause; Thamar had hurt
Amnon in striving with him, and she had railed upon him, calling him fool, and
giving him such other opprobrious terms. But it appears by Thamars answer,
that there was no cause at all given on her part of so great hatred, v. 16.

3. P. Martyr thinks the reason thereof proceeded from the trouble and
perplexity of his conscience, being ashamed of that which he had done: as
the Apostle says, What fruit had ye in those things, whereof ye are now
ashamed? Romans 6.22. But if Amnon had had any remorse, or fear of any shame
before God, or men, he would never for his own credit sake have thrust her
out in such disgrace.

4. But one reason hereof is the difference between inordinate and unlawful
lust, which ends with hatred, and lawful love, which still more increases:
and such are the baits and allurements of sin, which have a pleasant taste at
the first, but in the end bite like a serpent: therefore one well-saith,
voluptates non venientes sed abeuntes contemplandas: that pleasures must be
considered not as they come, but as they go. Borrh.

5. But the greatest cause of all is, Dominum sic instituisse, that the Lord
had so appointed, that this sin should not be kept secret, that it might
redound to the chastisment and correction of David. Pellic. Mar.

9. Quest. v. 19. Of Thamars lamentation.
1. She shows her grief by these three signs: she put ashes on her head,
rent her garments, and laid her hands on her head: which was a sign of
mourning. Ier. 2.37.

2. Some read, she rent talarem tunicam, her side garments: so Joseph. Lat.
Pellic. but beside that the word pass^n signifies rather, variam, Vatab.
versicolarem, Iun. polymitam: Mart. a garment of diverse pieces or colors: it
is noted v. 18. to have bin a peculiar garment to Kings daughters: so was not a
long and side garment: but parti-colored garments were had in great estimation,
Iud. 5.30. therefore Jacob made Joseph such an one, because he loved him: Genesis
37.3. Genevens.

3. She cried out as she went, not forbearing to cry out of her brother, and
to show what he had done, as some think, Mart. Pellic. but it seems rather,
that she did not express the cause of her grief: Osiand. for then Absalom
needed not to have said unto her afterward, has Amnon thy brother been with
thee? and his counsel had come too late, that she should be quiet, because he
was her brother: that is, his shame would be the shame of them all; and as she
was the Kings daughter, so he was his son, and that the Eldest: and therefore
he would have respect to the one and the other: Iun. if she had blazed his
name already, this persuasion of her brother had come out of time.

10. Quest. v. 21. Of these words, David, when he heard these things was very
wrath: whether David sinned not in sparing his son.
1. Some do think that David did purpose to punish his son for this folly,
or villainy rather: but like a wise man he deferred it, watching his best
opportunity, as he dealt with Ioab and Shemei. Osiander. But it seems
otherwise, that David had no such intendment, for it was two years after
before Absalon was revenged of Amnon.

2. An other opinion is, that Amnon might repent him of his sin, and
therefore David pardoned it: but though repentance do make reconciliation
between God, and the offender; yet they which publicly transgress should not
be freed from the punishment, which is afflicted for the good example of
others: Mart.

3. Some think, that it was not death to force a maid not betroathed: for that
law Deuteronomy. 22.25. is concerning such as are espoused. But it must further be
considered, that she was his sister, and so he committed incest, which was
worthy of death. And beside, it was death for a virgin to play the whoare in
her fathers house, Deuteronomy. 22.21. the like penalty also lay upon the son.

4. Others excuse David, because this matter was not proceeded iudicially
before him. Thamar accused not her brother upon Absaloms advise, and therefore
David, the fact being not proved iudicially before him, could do nothing.
Borrh. In this case David should have sifted out the matter himself: otherwise
Heli might have bin by the same reason excused for his lenity toward his
sons.

5. Pelican adds further, that David being guilty of the like sin
himself, used conniuence toward his son.

6. But David can not be herein excused: he was too remiss and indulgent
toward his children. As he was unwilling that Absalon should be slain after he
was entered into that unnatural and rebellious action: neither did he punish
Adoniahs aspiring mind, that while his father yet lived, would have taken upon
him to be King. And herein most of all Gods work is to be considered, quod
David corrigere noluit Deus punivit, God punished that, which David would not
correct. God so in his secret wisdom disposed, that David should let Amnon
go unpunished, that the other judgment of the sword threatened against David's
house might take place. Mart.

11. Quest. v. 28. Upon those words of Absalon, smite Amnon, kill him. Why the
Lord suffered a sword to be drawn out against David's family, having forgiven
his sin.
True it is, that the Lord had said to David by his Prophet Nathan, that the
Lord had put away his sin, he should not die: yet some chastisement remained
still, quae non poenae vim, sed medicinae obtinet, which was not as a
punishment, but as a medicine. And for these causes does the Lord lay
afflictions upon his children, even after the remission of their sin.

1. Vt sit, quod nos admoneat nostrae miseriae, etc. that we may have somewhat
always to admonish us of our misery. 2. Vt sit materia inuo^andi Deum, that
we may still have occasion to call upon God, and fly unto him in our
afflictions, and necessities. 3. That the members of Christ may be conformable
unto the head: For if we suffer with him, we shall also be glorified with him:
Romans 8.17. So the Apostle says, I fulfill the rest of the afflictions of
Christ in my flesh, for his bodies sake, which is the Church: Coloss. 1.24. Not
that any thing is wanting to the personal sufferings of Christ: but because
Christ suffers together in his members, they are called the afflictions of
Christ. 4. But here we must take heed of the error of the Romanists, who
think that the servants of God do satisfy for their sins by their
afflictions: Borrh. But seeing no affliction happens unto Gods children,
which is not deservedly imposed upon them for their sin, thereby they cannot
satisfy: but they must leave that work for him, who was without sin, and
therefore undeservedly suffered in himself whatsoever was laid upon him, for our
sins.

12. Quest. v. 29. Whence David's sons had their mules which came of the
mixture of diverse kinds.
Whereas they are forbidden Leuit. 19.19. to suffer the cattle of diverse
kinds to engender together; and the mules come of coupling of the horse and
ass, so that this should seem to be against the law. 1. Some answer, that in
some countries the mules do engender themselves: De nature. anim. lib. 8. cap.
24. lib. 6. cap. 26.
as Aristotle writes, which he affirms to be very swift, whereas ours are
slow. But if there be any such mules, they are of another kind: for those which
are now in use, being of a mixed kind cannot engender: they were first found
out by Anah in the wilderness, Genesis 36.24.
when he kept his father Sibeons asses. 2. It is like therefore that these
mules were engendered in some other country, and brought thence into
Palestina: although they were forbidden to put together diverse kinds, yet they
might use the things so engendered: Mart. 3. Borrhaius finds fault with the
vulgar Latin for reading here mulas, she mules, for mulos, he mules: which do
differ much, the he, which comes of the he ass and the mare, are very
swift, the she mules of the horse and she ass, are very slow and dull. But
though there be an error in the translation; for in the original the word is
peredeh, an he mule, not pirdah, a she mule: yet it seems there is no such
difference in the use: for 1. King. 1.33. the Kings own beast was pirdah, a
she mule; it is like he would use the best kind of them.

13. Quest. v. 31. Of David's mourning, when he heard of the death of his sons.
1. David here was paid home in the same kind: for as he took delight when
news was brought him of Vriahs death; so now he is frighted with heavy news,
and the report is worse then the thing, that all the Kings sons were dead.
Borrh. Martyr. 2. And as his servants also, when they heard of Vriahs death
their faithful fellow servant, sorrowed not, so now also upon this report,
they stand likewise with their clothes rent. Pelican. 3. David had great cause
of grief, for he was a tender man over his children: and where he hoped to
find comfort, they are an occasion to him of grief. 4. Many who do prosper in
their affairs abroad, have cause of grief at home, as David here has.
Augustus Caesar was a happy Emperor, yet he had domestical crosses by his
children, in so much that he desired, that he had died without children. 5.
Likewise the very manner, how it was reported, his children were killed, might
much trouble him, that they were slain by treachery, which brought to his
remembrance his own sin, how he had caused faithful Vriah to be betrayed in
battle. 6. Yet notwithstanding these crosses, David was in the favor of God;
which shows that Gods favor, or disfavor is not to be measured by
prosperity or adversity in this life: Mart. 7. And by this example we see,
that children, whom their parents spare to correct, will in the end be a grief
unto them.

14. Quest. v. 32. Of Ionadabs speech to David.
1. This wicked man, whose counsel to Amnon brought David and his sons into
this danger, now takes upon him to comfort David: Pelican. But he is a
miserable comforter, in saying that Amnon only was dead: for it was grief
enough to the King, to have his eldest son slain in that manner; and Ionadab
shows himself no changeling: for he bewraieth his carnal security, that
was not touched with the remembrance of his sin, being himself the author
of this mischief: Osiand. It is also marvel, that he gessing so right at the
matter, and giving a reason, why Amnon only was slain, as if he were
acquainted with his counsel, that the king was so forgetful, as not to
examine and sift him further.

2. Now Ionadab knew this by conjecture, for he was privy unto this whole
matter from the beginning: some think that Absalon had this thing in his
mouth, as the Hebrew words are, and that he might tell Ionadab so much. Mar.
But it is more like that Absalon kept his purpose secret, as Josephus says,
grave odium eius in pectore celabat, he concealed in his breast great hatred
toward him: therefore it is no good reading, Absalon had so reported. Genev.
nor, he had determined so in his heart. B. C. or, he was set in Absalons
hatred: L. or, in Absalons rage. S. for the words are, ehi ghal pi, because it
was in his mouth: which Vatablus thus expounds, at the commandment of
Absalom it was so appointed, from the day when Amnon forced Thamar. But Absalom
had not given that charge and commandment to his servants so long before, but
upon the present. Therefore Iunius reading is better; at the appointment of
Absalom, that was done, which he purposed from the day, etc. so that the word
shimah, purpose, has relation to the words following, from the day, etc. for
so long before he had purposed it, though not appointed it. And that phrase,
according to the mouth, is taken in thi^ sense, for appointment in other
places; as Numb. 3.16.

15. Quest. v. 36. Of these words, The King wept exceeding sore: how that the
children of God are not without their passions.
But here this question may be moved: how it comes to pass, that many among
the heathen in the like calamity, when they heard of the death of their
children, were not moved, and yet David here shows himself full of passion:
as Horatius Pulvillus, as he was dedicating a temple, heard of the death of his
son, yet proceeded in the dedication: Anaxagoras hearing the like of his
son, made only this answer, scio me genuisse mortalem, I knew I begot a
son to die: Paulus Aemilius when his sons were slain, and the public
business went well forward, gave thanks to the gods that he had his prayer,
that the calamity imminent might fall upon his family, so that the
commonwealth were delivered.

The reasons of this difference may be these. 1. The heathen did think that
these calamities fell out by necessity of nature, or by chance, and they
looked not unto Gods providence, neither believed any thing of the state of the
soul after this life: and therefore as natural men, only considering the time
present, and not well waighing the cause of all these calamities, which is our
sins, they seemed not to be moved. But it is otherwise with the servants of
God: they know that all things fall out by Gods providence, and that
calamities are sent by him as punishments of sin, and this is the cause of
their mourning. And to this purpose may be applied that saying of Aristippus,
who being in danger of shipwreck in the sea, and much afraid, whereas an other
rude man, yet hardy, feared nothing, and being asked why he was so fearful
being a Philosopher, made answer; non debuisti sollicitus esse tu de anima
nebulonis, ego videbam Aristippum philosophum periclitari, thou had no reason
to take care for the soul of a knave, but I knew that Aristippus the
philosopher was in danger, etc. So the heathen had no such cause to be moved:
for they knew not what should become of their souls, neither were they of such
price with God, as the souls of his servants, whom he reserueth for a better
life.

2. An other reason of this vacuitie of passion among the Heathen, was that
received opinion of the Stoics, who held that there should be in a wise man,
(...), an absence of all passion. The Peripatetikes held, that passions and
affections were to be moderated: the other, would have them to be quite rooted
out: But this were to blame the God of nature, who created man with passions
and affections, and whatsoever God made, was good: and the affections of anger,
zeal, desire, sorrow, with the rest, are many times the instruments of virtue
being well used. Indeed the holy Martyrs of Christ in the midds of their
torments, seemed to be without sense of grief, not as though they were without
any feelling or passion: but the exceeding great joy which they had in the
contemplation of a better life, did swallow up all their other affections: and
this strength in them was extraordinary and supernatural: but the question is
here, of the ordinary state and condition of the faithful. This then is the
doctrine of Christian religion, be angry, but sin not, Ephesians. 4.26. that men
should use their affections, but yet moderate them and keep them within their
bounds.

3. And concerning the patience of the Gentiles, with other their virtues of
justice, fortitude, temperance; they were but speciosa peccata, goodly sins,
because they were without faith: and without faith it is not possible to please
God, Heb. 11.6. So that we doubt not, but that David with his passionate
tears, which proceeded of faith, was more accepted of God, then the
unpassionate heathen, which had no faith. Mart.

16. Quest. Of the passions and affections, that were in our blessed Savior.
1. Our blessed Savior as he was perfect God, and so without passion: so was
he perfect man, and so took upon him true humane affections, as of joy,
sorrow, anger: for that all these were in him, the Gospel does abundantly
testify: otherwise he had not been a perfect man: as Augustine says, neque
cum verum corpus hominis and animam habuit, habuit falsum affectum humanum,
neither when he had the true body and soul of a man, had he false affections.

2. Therefore those sayings of Hilarie are warily to be read, and considered;
Christum ad patiendum, Lib. 10. de Trinit.
non ad dolendum corpus habuisse, that Christ had a body to suffer, not to
grieve: and the cross of Christ the spears and nails he says, impetum
passionis fecisse in Christo, at non dolorem, did force passion in Christ, but
no sense or grief; as when a man smites the water, there is a passion and
suffering in it, but no sense or feeling, etc. These assertions are dangerous,
and against the Scripture: the body of Christ is not to be imagined to have
such stupiditie, as things without life and sense: He had a perfect humane
soul, and therefore affection also and sense.

3. But there is great difference between the affections which Christ had, and
ours. 1. in respect of the object: our affections do turn into sin, but
Christ's were never occupied in any sinful or imperfect act. 2. All Christ's
affections were in him voluntary, they did rise in him when he pleased to show
them, and they appeared not, when he pleased to suppress them; but in us, they
are often involuntarie, and they rise whether we will or no. 3. Our affections
are so precipitate, that may times they ouerrule reason: but so were not our
blessed Saviors. ex Mart.

17. Quest. Why holy men and wom^n under the old Testament showed more passion
then now.
In the new Testament also the servants of God did show their passions and
affections, as the woman that washed Christ's feet with her tears, and Peter
wept bitterly: but these examples indeed are not so many in the new Testament,
nor in such manner: 1. One reason hereof may be the alteration of times, that
may seem commendable in one age, which is not so allowed of in an other: then
their lamentations were solemn and public, and with many ceremonies, and much
preparation, which vsages do not beseem these times. 2. But it may better be
answered: that they did more attend the terrene promises of the land of Canaan,
and the good success and increase of their posterity, though they had also a
sight of the true spiritual rest, but not so clear as we have: therefore they
sorrowed more for the loss of external things. But now because we by faith
are nourished into a more lively hope of the things to come, we ought less to
be moved with temporal losses and crosses. Mart.

18. Quest. v. 39. Of David's desire to Absalom.
1. Some read, David ceased to go forth after Absalom, Vat. Lat. Pellic.
Montan. as though David had sought him or pursued him by strong hand: Osiand.
for both Absalom was gone out of the land, being fled to Talmai, king of
Geshur his wives father: and David's affection was not so bent against him, who
afterward when he had rebelled against him, lamented for his death. It is
therefore better read, he desired to go forth unto him, that is, to see him.
Page Iun. B. G.

2. The reason is adjoined, he was comforted concerning Amnon, 1. both for that
he was dead, and could not be restored to life again: Iun. 2. and he
considered that Amnon died justly for his sin: Borrh. 3. time also had
mitigated and allayed his grief: Pelli^. 4. And he therein considered Gods
providence, by the which all things are disposed, and nothing falls out by
chance. Mart.

CHAP. 14.
1. Quest. What moved Ioab to take this course in this chapter prescribed to
bring again Absalom.
1. IOab saw David's affection well inclined toward Absalom: not turned against
Absalom, as Osiand. for the last verse of the former chapter shows that David
was comforted for the death of Amnon, and longed for his son Absalom: David
was well affected toward his son, yet would not yet send for him to return,
because by the law of God, he that killed an other wifully was to die: Ioab
being a cunning courtier, and observing David's mind, began to work with
him in this cunning manner, in suborning a subtle woman to speak unto the
King. Mart.

2. P. Martyr thinks that Ioab did this to gratify David, because he saw
that it would please him, to have his son return again; and his reason is,
because after Absalom was returned, Ioab came not at him for two years,
neither would come being sent for, till Absalom had caused his field of barley
to be set on fire. But it is evident that Ioab did it to pleasure Absalom, as
appears, ver. 22. where Ioab gives great thanks unto the King for granting
his request. And afterward Ioabs mind might somewhat change toward Absalom, as
he saw the kings mind to alter; and because the king would not have him see
his face, neither would Ioab visit him: and courtiers beside are forgetful of
their friends, and variable. At this time it is like Ioab thinking Absalom like
to succeed in the kingdom, would by this means insinuate himself into his
favor.

2. Quest. Why Ioab deals covertly by parable with the King, not directly.
Whereas there are two kind of examples; some are true, some are fained: the
fained are of two sorts, either parables or fables: and parables sometime are
used for illustration only, sometime for proof and demonstration; this
parable is of this latter sort: Borrh. which Ioab here puts into the woman's
mouth for these causes. 1. Parables do move much, and leave a vehement
impression behind them. 2. They were very usual in those days. 3. But the
chiefest reason of all was, opus erat obliqua petitione in causa mala: in an
evil cause it was necessary to use an oblique and indirect petition: Osiand.
for it would have seemed an harsh and unsavory petition, at the first to
request a parricide of his brother to be restored. Antonius Caracalla after he
had killed his brother Geta, would have had Papinian the lawyer to defend the
fact, who made this frank answer, paricidia facilius committentur, quam
defenduntur, that parricides are more easily committed then defended: but for
this his free speech he was slain. Mart. 4. This diligence of Ioab in
bolstring out a badde cause, should teach us not to be slack in following of a
good cause. Mart.

3. Q^est. Of the woman of Tekoah, whom Ioab used.
1. This Tekoah some think to have been a city in the tribe of Asher: Bor.
Mar. Pellic. but it is found to have been in the tribe of Judah, 2. Chron.
11.6. Iun. Genev. 2. The Rabbines think that this town brought forth many
witty and eloquent men and women, out of which place came the Prophet Amos:
and therefore Ioab made choice to take a woman from this place. 3. Pelican
thinks, that this woman indeed, did truly put this case of her two sons,
which killed one the other: but it is otherwise expressed in the text, v. 3.
that Ioab taught her what she should say. 4. Ioab therefore makes choice of
this woman, whom he knew to be of a subtle wit, and ready speech, to put
forth this parable to the King, and to take upon her the person and habit of a
mourner: which part was fittest to be played by a woman full of passion, and so
able to move compassion.

4. Quest. Of the woman's speech in general.
1. The woman's parabolicall narration consists of two parts, of the
proposition of the parable, to v. 12. then the reddition, and accommodation of
it to Absalom, v. 12. to v. 21. Borrh.

2. The reasons, which the woman uses to persuade compassion, are specialy
three; taken, ab honesto, vtili, facili, it was an honest thing which she
desired, profitable, and easy to be done: first, it was honest, both by the
law of nature, which teaches a man to defend himself, and to repel wrong by
force and might, as this her son did defend himself from his brothers wrong:
it was honest by the written law, which appointed cities of refuge, for such
inuoluntatie offenders. It was also a thing profitable to her house, that her
son should live, otherwise her spark should be put out, if both her sons
should be taken way. And it was an easy matter for the King to determine, who
was as an Angel of God, that is, of great dexterity in hearing good and bad.

3. The woman alleges many unlike things in her parable, which were not true
in the case between Amnon and Absalom. 1. One of these supposed sons did not
intend an others death, but they fell out upon the sudden; but Absalom had
purposed Amnons death long before. 2. one of these invaded an other, but Amnon
did not assault Absalom. 3. there no witnesses were present, here all the Kings
sons were assembled together. 4. the cities of refuge were not appointed for
wilful murderers, such as Absalom was. 5. she pretended that if her other
son died, all hope of posterity should be cut off: but though Absalom should
never return, the King had more sons. Mart. Thus she of purpose inserteth
into this her oration some unlike things, least the King should at the first
perceive her purpose. Osiand.

5. Quest. v. 9. What the woman means, when she says, This trespass be upon
me, and my fathers house.
1. Some think that she cunningly turns the speech and curse upon her self,
which she means toward the King: that if he did not help in this case, and
deliver her son from them that pursued him, that God would require it at his
hand: Borrh. Mart. But it is not like, that she would either apertly or
covertly use any such commination, all her speech being petitionarie. 2.
Therefore this rather is her meaning, that if it were so, that the king should
offend in redeeming her son, that had killed his brother, she would before
the Lord, take all the fault upon her self, and her family: the King and his
throne should be innocent: Iun. Osiand.

6. Quest. v. 11. Why the woman says to the King, Remember the Lord thy God.
1. The Chalde paraphrast seems to give this sense, that he would remember
what is written in the law of God concerning the pursuit of blood, that they
should not pursue deadly the innocent. 2. Osiander gives this sense, remember
the Lord thy God, to imitaate him in showing of mercy. 3. But it appears by
David's immediate answer which he binds with an oath, that the woman for her
better assurance did covertly desire it of the king: Iun. Vat. Mar. 4. And
whereas the king seemed but to speak of one revenger of blood, ver. 10. bring
him to me that speaks against thee: she desires a more general grant of
the king, that he would not suffer the reuengers of blood to be multiplied:
that not only one, but all it might be inhibited by the King. Pel. 5. The King
by this oath was not tied to grant her request following for Absalom, for his
was a diverse case from this here propounded by the woman, and confirmed by
David's oath. 6. Neither did the King abase himself in swearing to the woman to
confirm his promise, it being so weighty a matter: seeing that God did so
much condi^cend to Abraham, to confirm the promises made unto him, by swearing
by himself. Mart.

7. Quest. v. 13. Of the arguments whereby the woman seeks to persuade David.
1. She returns the Kings words upon himself, that seeing he had given
sentence that her son should be spared, he should be found faulty himself,
if he showed not the like mercy to Absalom. Iun.

2. Her second reason is, v. 14. taken from our mortal state, and the
necessity of death; seeing such is our condition, as that we must all needs
die, and there is no turning again in this world; like as water which is spilt
cannot be gathered up again: she hereby moves compassion, that David would
not take away Absaloms life before the time. Mart.

3. An other reason in the same verse is taken from Gods providence, neither
has God taken away his life, etc. that is, God has preserved Absalom alive,
and has appointed means, that is, put into the peoples head to make request
for him, that is banished: Iun. and here also she has relation to the cities
of refuge, which God had appointed for the rescue of involuntarie man-slayers;
Mart. and secretly she insinuates, how the Lord had spared David, and did not
take away his life after he had sinned. Osiand.

4. She further urges the common peril and danger of the people; saying, v.
15. the people have made me afraid: their state and condition is to be feared,
if Absalom the hope of the kingdom return not: Vatablus thus interprets,
the people terrified me, and told me, that if I should directly make request
for thy son, thou would be angry, and this is the cause of my covert
speech. P. Mar. thus; the people thought I should make request in vain, yet I
was bold to speak. Osiander, the people urged me, after I had entreated for
mine own son, to make mention of Absalom also, and that if I did it not, I
should greatly offend. But the first sense is most fit, for so the application
of the parable to Absalom shall be correspondent to that, which she alleged
for her son, that if he died, her spark should be put out, and so Absalom
was the hope of the people.

5. Further, verse. 16. she shows the inconvenience that would follow,
propounding it in her person, and her sons: that as they should be cut off
from their inheritance, for her son being slain, she should not live long
after: so Absalom being in exile, should be destroyed from the inheritance of
God, and so fall away to idolatry: Mart. this argument David in the same
terms had urged against Saul, 1. Sam. 26.19. They have cast me out this day
from abiding in the inheritance of the Lord, saying, go serve others gods.

6. Then she propounds the common profit, the word of my Lord the King shall
now be for rest: that is, ad publicam tranquilitatem, it shall be for the
common tranquillity and peace.

7. She proceeds and inserteth the commendation of the King, comparing him to
an Angel, both in uprightness of judgment, and in dexterity of judging: Bor.
not doubting, but that as an Angel, so graciously without passion he would
hear her request: Osiand. and be constant as an Angel in keeping his princely
promise: Pelican. and that as he had given sentence on her side in her private
cause, so that setting aside all humane affection, he would in simili causa
idem iudicium far, give the same judgment in the like cause concerning his
son Absalom. Iun.

8. She concludes with the chiefest benediction of all, the Lord thy God shall
be with thee: when thou have performed my request, the Lord shall prosper thee
in thy government: and thy kingdom shall flourish, and God shall be with thee
in all thy enterprises. Iun. Mart.

8. Quest. v. 19. Whether the woman be to be blamed for revealing Ioabs
counsel.
1. Pelican notes hereupon how dangerous a thing it is to commit any matter
of secrecy unto women, that cannot hold: because this woman concealed not
Ioabs counsel. 2. But the woman being asked and straightly charged by the
king, could not do otherwise: she knew that the king was wise, even as an
Angel of God, to find it out if she had denied it: and so she should have
been to her great shame found to be a liar. Vatabl. 3. And it may seem not
improbable, that she and Ioab had agreed, that she should in the end discover
the matter: for Ioab was present, as may be gathered v. 21. ready to second
the woman's petition, as he should see cause. Mart. 4. And in that she makes
Ioab the author of this course, that she should change her speech, and speak
parable-wise, their opinion is confuted, which think the woman spoke as the
thing was concerning her two sons: for here she confesses, that she was
taught by Ioab to change her form of speech. Mart.

9. Quest. Whether David did well in sparing Absalom.
1. David's conniuence herein, in not causing Absalom to be put to death, for
killing his brother Amnon, neither is absolutely to be condemned, as
transgressing the law, which requires capital punishment to be laid upon
those which committed wilful murder: to the which opinion P. Martyr enclineth;
adding further, non de suo sed de Dei iure largitur qui homicidae parcit: he
which spares a manslayer, does not give any thing of his own right, but of
Gods, etc. for David did what he could, he caused him to live in banishment
three years, cap. 13.38. then he was hardly entreated to give him leave to
return: and at his return he would not suffer him to see his face for two
years more, v. 28. David could not put him to death, because he was beloved of
the people.

2. Nor yet can this fact of David be justified, that he did well in sparing of
Absalom, and not punishing of him: the example of Cain, who killed his brother
Abel, and yet was spared by his father Adam, is nothing like: for God gave
special dispensation at that time to Caine to prolong his days, but to his
greater confusion: and beside, Cain was preserved for the necessity of
procreation in those days: there is not the like reason, why Absalom should be
spared here.

3. Therefore the mean way is best, neither to condemn or justify this fact
of David, as seeming to impugn the law of Moses, nor yet to justify it:
excused it may be by diverse circumstances: 1. there were no accusers or
reuengers, which followed this crime against Absalom. 2. he was the kings son
and desired of the people. 3. he considered that it was Gods justice upon
Amnon. 4. And beside, here was Gods secret work in so disposing, that Absalom
should be reserved for a greater punishment. Borrh.

10. Quest. Why David would not admit Absalom to his presence.
1. David would not at the first suffer Absalom to see his face, least he might
have bin thought scelus homicidij leuiter aestimare, to make but small account
of manslaughter: Osiand. 2. And by seeing Absalom, the memory of Amnons death
might be reviued. 3. It is like also that it would have been an offense unto
Amnons friends, and they might hereby have been provoked to seek revenge:
Mart. 4. And David did it to this end, vt melius filios in officio contineret,
that he might by this example of severity the better contain his children,
and bring them to do their duty: Osiand. 5. And David thought it good not to
restore Absalom all at once, he knew him to be of an insolent nature: he would
have him therefore by little and little to conceive more hope of pardon. Pellic.

11. Quest. v. 25. Of Absaloms beawtie.
1. Mention is made here of Absaloms beauty to show his pride, that grew
insolent and ambitious in respect of his beauty and favor, that he not long
after aspired to the crown. 2. Beauty is no virtue, and yet it is in it self
a commendable gift of nature, especially if it be accompanied with these two
things, humanity and chastity: as Joseph being a beautiful person excelled
in both these, he was courteous toward his brethren, and chaste to his mistress:
But both of them were wanting in Absalom, he was both cruel, and of a
murderous mind, and very unchaste, that he did not forbear his fathers
concubines. 3. Beauty and comeliness is not always joined with virtue: Saul
was a comely tall person, yet proved a tyrant: Alcibiades among the Athenians
was a comely man, but caused many tragedies: Isocrates was wont to say of such,
that had beauty but no virtue: that they had navim bonam, sed gubernatorem
malum, a good ship, but an evil governor: Chrysostom compares the^ to fair
trees in the wood, In Psalm. 50.
that bring no fruit but for swine. And they may be likened to peacockes, which
have gaie feathers, but are not so profitable, as the poor hourly be, that
yields honey. Mart.

12. Quest. Of Absalom hair. v. 16.
1. Some think that Absalom was a Nazarite, and therefore polled not his
hair: but the Nazarites did not cut their hair once every year as Absalom
did, but when their vow was at an end. It is like as D. Kimhi thinks, that he
had a pride in his hair, and did glory in it. 2. In some countries the use
was not to poll their hair, as among the Lacedaemonians: and they did it for
this reason, if they were comely the hair would add grace unto them, if they
were deformed it would make them terrible to their enemies. But among the
Romans they as much abhorred those, which did wear long hair. There was a
certain tree, whereon the young men and virgins did hang their first hair,
which they consecrated unto the gods: Absalom in nourishing his hair followed
therein no custom, but did it only of pride.

2. His hair waighed 200. sicles, which as Josephus counts, was five pound:
but some Hebrews better value the pound at 25. sacred sicles, that is, so many
half ownces: this was esteemed after the kings, that is, the civil and common
sicle, Iunius. which is held to be but two drammes, that is a quarter of an
ownce. Josephus is here in an error, who thinks he polled his head, at
every 8. months end, whereas the text says, it was at the end of every year:
and it being too heavy for him, weighing 200. common sicles, that is, an 100.
half ownces, and 50. whole ownces, which makes about 4 l. weight, counting
12. ownces and an half to the pound; he then cut it off. But if the sicle
contained half an ownce, as Montanus thinks, then the weight of his hair
was as much more. Some think, that it was sold for 200. sicles, not that it
waighed so much: Emm. Sa. But the valuation of it, at such a reckoning would
seem more strange, then the weight thereof at such a sum. In Saul and
Absalom two men of goodly stature, but of badde conditions, we have the right
description of hypocrites, who bear a fair show outwardly, but within are
corrupt. Borrh.

CHAP. 15.
1. Quest. v. 1. What moved Abshalom to aspire unto the kingdom, and when.
1. Josephus thinks, that he began to attempt this after four years:
whereof though there be no mention in the text, yet it may well be, that after
he had bin kept from his fathers presence two years, and had been received
into his favor and sight, and so continued one year, then he began thus to
practice in the fourth.

2. And seeing Amnon the Eldest was now slain, and Chileab the second sonn^
was dead, he took himself to be the next heir, and therefore begins
betimes, to prevent the conueying of the kingdom over to Solomon, which now
might begin to be surmised and talked of. Mar.

3. He might also carry an hateful mind toward his father, and so purposed
ungraciously with himself to be revenged of him. His mother also being a
stranger, and his kindred were not so much (it may be) respected, and
therefore he also sought their advancement.

4. And herein God had a secret work, that Nathans prophecy might take place,
that the sword should never depart from David's house. Further, herein David was
a type and figure of the Messiah, against whom one of his Apostles lift up his
heel. Borrh.

2. Quest. Of Abshaloms practices whereby he seeks to aspire to the kingdom.
1. He takes upon him great state and pomp: he provides him a chariot, and
horses, which was a thing unusual, and 50. men. And by this glittering show,
he begins to be advanced of the people, who are much affected with
novelties, and unwonted vsages, Mart. It was marvel, that his father perceived
not, to what this tended, but he was blinded with fatherly love, and affection
toward him. Osiand.

2. The next thing whereby he insinuates himself, is his diligence and
pains: he would rise up early every morning, and go and stand in the gate:
ambitious men will spare no travail or pains to atcheiue their purpose: which
may teach us to be diligent in following of good causes, if the ambitious are
so diligent and studious in prosecuting of evil.

3. Then follows his flattery, he would commend every ones cause that it was
very good: and would give them fair promises, wishing that he were set to be
a Judge over them, he would then minister justice unto every one.

4. He slaundereth also his Fathers government, and accuses his officers of
negligence and injustice: as the property of ambitious men is, to dispraise
all but themselves.

5. Unto these insinuations he adds a fawning kind of humanity and
courtesy, abasing himself to kiss every one that came by.

6. And by these means, it is said he stole away the hearts of the people,
both in respect of David, to whom they were bound by covenant; from him he
steals their hearts: Mart. and in respect of the people also, who knew not
Absaloms purpose herein; it was also secret, and as theft unto them.

3. Quest. v. 7. After forty years: from what time these years must be
counted.
1. Osiander thinks, those years to take beginning from David's first
annoynting by Samuel: but that being done privately, could not well be a rule
of the public account.

2. Vatablus (so also Genevens.) reckons those years from the time, when the
Israelites asked a King, which was three years, as he thinks, before David
began his reign; and he takes this to be the 37. year of David's reign.
But it was more then 40. years from thence, for Samuel and Saul governed
Israel 40. years, Act. 13.21. Neither was there any cause why the years of
David's reign should be counted from thence, seeing he was no way accessarie
to the sin of the people in that petition.

3. An other account is to begin these years from the slaughter of the
priests by Saul in Nob: but the Scripture uses not to put the years of two
kings reigns together.

4. Josephus for forty years reads four, but that is contrary to the
text.

5. And to count these 48. years as run of the Iubile, is without ground,
because we find not that account to be used in Scripture.

6. The best reckoning then of these years, is to count them from the
beginning of David's reign: But not as Pelican thinks, that this might be
done two or three years before the end of David's reign, for so few years (he
thinkeeth) break no great square in such a sum: this account is better taken
precisely and exactly, that this fell out in the last year of David's reign:
for all the rest of the story which follows to chap. 21. seems to have
been done in a veire short time: thus therefore the years may be divided; two
years Absalom was at Jerusalem before he saw his fathers face, and three
years before that in exile: two years (before that) were past from the
deflouring of Thamar to the slaughter of Amnon: these make 7. in all, and it is
thought that 3. or 4. years before, that David committed the sin with
Bathsheba in the 59. year of his age, and about the 29. year of David's
reign: for David reigned 40. years, and was 70. years old when he died: so
that the 59. year of his age will concur with the 29. year of his reign.
And it is held of the Hebrews, that Solomon was but a 11. years of age, when
he began his reign. Mart.

4. Quest. Why Abshalom makes choice of Hebr^n to begin his conspiracy in.
1. Iunius thinks that Abshalom did not sacrifice at Hebron, but only made a
vow solemnly among his kindred there, to testify his thankfulness unto God,
for restoring him to his country, and his fathers favor: but it is evident in
that he says, I will serve the Lord, v. 8. that it was a religious act, beside
a solemn feast: for before the Temple was built, they sacrificed in other
places, then where the Tabernacle was: Mart. Osiand. especially their
peace offerings: Genevens. See more hereof before. 1. Sam. qu. 17. in c. 7. qu.
4. in c. 9. and qu. 2. c. 16.


2. He makes choice of Hebron being a famous place, because of the sepulcher
of the Patriarchs there, and there David began his reign, and Absaloms
kindred there dwelt of the tribe of Judah. Mart.

3. Thus Abshalom makes religion a clooke of his rebellion: as the Pope and
popelings, in their treacherous plottes pretend religion and conscience. Borrh.

5. Quest. v. 10. Of Abshaloms conspiracy, and the manner thereof.
1. First, there went with Abshalom 200. men: these were invited to Abshaloms
feast, but knew nothing of his conspiracy: the text says, they went in their
simplicity. These were in no fault to go with Absalom, for his father had
given him leave: and after they saw, what Abshalom intended, then they could
not withdraw themselves, sine praesentissimo vitae periculo, without most
present danger of their life. Osiander.

2. But before this Abshalom had sent messengers secretly into all the Tribes,
to feel and solicit the minds of the chiefest men, and to appoint to meet
at Hebron.

3. Then he sends for Achitophel, who it should seem was of counsel with
him in this action, but had withdrawn himself into his own country, that
there might be no suspicion, and from thence came to Hebron, being acquainted
with the whole project of the business before.

4. But it is most to be wondered at, that the people did flock so fast to
Absalom: it is like that Achitophel or some other used some persuasion to the
people, showing the imperfections of David's life, and government, and how
beside the adultery of Bathsheba, and murder of Vriah, he had suffered Amnon
to go unpunished for his incest: and had dealt hardly with Abshalom for
revenging his sisters wrong. By such persuasions the people might be carried,
being of themselves desirous of novelty, and longing to see a change. Mart.

6. Quest. v. 17. Why the King fled from Ierushalem.
David having armed men with him, and being in a strong city, might have
remained there still more safely, yet he did choose rather to fly, for these
reasons. 1. He would spare the effusion of blood; for he said, least he smite
the city with the edge of the sword: he had rather hazard his own person,
then that many should be brought into danger: he knew how cruelly ambitious
men were set, that they would not spare, nor have any compassion, till they had
accomplished their desire. Hereof the Civil wars of Scilla and Marius, and
between Augustus, Antonie, and Lepidus in the Roman state may make
demonstration: Mart. Antisthenes was wont to prefer hangmen and executioners
before Tyrants, for they did but put malefactors to death, the other did not
spare the innocent.

2. An other reason of his departure was; he began to consider that this was
the hand of God upon him, according as Nathan had foretold him, that the sword
should not depart from his house, and therefore he submits himself meekly
to the Lords mercy.

3. And by his departure, an other prediction of Nathan took effect; he left
his concubines behind, whom Abshalom defiled.

4. David with all his people went on foot, as is gathered v. 17. R. Leviben
Gerson thinks the reason thereof was, that he might not be discerned, going
as a common soldier: but rather David did it to show his afflicted estate:
Mart. And David carrying himself thus humbly in this calamity, continued not
long therein, but was soon restored to his former estate. Pelican.

7. Quest. v. 19. Who Itthai the Gittite was.
1. Some think that this Itthai was the son of Achish king of Gath, who
favored David: and that these were of the city Gath of the Philistims, who
notwithstanding were faithful toward David: Osiand. But it is not like, that
David would use the help of the uncircumcised Philistims. 2. Vatablus takes
them for Philistims converted to the faith of Israel: and that Ittai was a
Proselyte also of that country, Pellic. but it seems by their late coming,
as David says v. 20. Thou cammest but yesterday, that they were no Proselytes,
they had not been so long there to be converted. 3. Josephus takes these 600.
that came with Itthai, to be those which fled from Saul to David when he was in
Ziglag: but it is not like, that they were now alive: it was 40. years before
this time. 4. Wherefore I think rather with Iunius, that these were no other
then the garrison soldiers, which kept Gath, which David had taken not long
before from the Philistims, c. 8.1. and Ittai was their captain: who is called
a stranger, because he was so in respect of his habitation: He was one of
David's principal captains to whom he committed the third part of his army,
c. 18.2. 5. Now David would not have Itthai go with him, because he was lately
come, and his men weary: and though such help had been necessary for David,
yet he was not a man that altogether respected his own commodity: and he
trusted in Gods defense, that he would deliver him. Mart.

8. Quest. v. 25. Why David would have the Arc carried again into the city.
1. Some think David sent back the Arc, because the peculiar place appointed
for it, was at Jerusalem from whence it should be no more removed. Borrh. But
that is not so: the peculiar place for the Arc was not yet assigned, but
afterward in the threshing floor of Araunah where the Angel appeared to David.
And before this in David's time, the Arc was carried to battle against the
Ammonites, and therefore Vriah said to David, that the Arc remained in the
field, because it was in the camp. c. 11.11.

2. Some think that David was afraid to carry the Arc with him, least some
such casualtie might befall them, as before, when Vzzah was smitten.

3. Some are of opinion that the Priests consulted with God, and received no
answer, and therefore David sends back the Arc as unprofitable: but that is
not like.

4. Others judge this to be the reason: the Priests went with the Arc, and
David remembering what the priests had suffered for his cause before at Nob,
would not have them brought into the like danger now, and therefore sends
them back with the Arc.

5. But the reason is set down in the text, why the Arc was returned to
Ierushalem, because David thought good to send back the Priests, who attended
upon it: that they might out of the city give David intelligence, as occasion
served. v. 27.

6. Thus David, though he knew that the Arc was a worthy Sacrament, and a
visible testimony of Gods presence, and well remembered, what great things the
Lord had wrought by the Arc: how the waters of Jordan were divided before it,
the walls of Jericho fell down: yet David was contented at this time to
forbear the presence of the Arc: having his confidence in God, and not
relying altogether upon the external Sacrament. Contrary is the superstitious
practice of the Pope, who when he iourneieth must have the consecrated host
carried upon a white palfrey before him, Controv. The grace of God not tied to
the sign.
that if any should chance to be suddenly stricken with sickness, he might
presently be housled therewith: the like opinion they have of the necessity of
baptism, that infants are damned, that are not baptized: and thus they tie
Gods grace to the outward sign and Sacrament: David does not so here, who
thinks to have Gods presence, though he had not with him the visible sign
thereof.

9. Quest. v. 27. Why David calls Zadock rather a Seer, then Abiathar.
1. The Jews think that Zadock was here appointed in Abiathars place, and
therefore to him only David gives the name of a Seer: and further, here they
have this fable, that Abiathar consulted with God first, because he was the
chiefer in place, but the Lord answered him not: and that then Zadock enquired
of God, and received answer, and upon this occasion Zadock was preferred: but
it is evident that Abiathar was not removed from the Priesthood until
Salomons reign, neither was it now a time for David to bestow offices.

2. Pet. Martyr says, videntem vocat, quia prior aderat, he calls him a
Seer, because he was there first: but the name Seer is taken for a Prophet: as
Samuel was so called, 1. Sam. 9.9.

3. The reason hereof was this: Abiathar and Zadock had their times to serve in
course, as was appointed by Samuel and David, 1. Chron. 9.22. and this week
Zadock served, and therefore David calls him Seer. And thus much in effect he
says unto him, that he was the public Minister to give attendance upon the
Arc for the service of the whole Church, and therefore it was not fit, that he
should only follow the King, priuata condition fugientem, now flying away, as
in a private state and condition. Iun. And further, David in effect says thus
much unto him: Art not thou a Seer which do use to ask counsel of God by
Vrim and Thummim? thou may stand me in more stead in returning, and abiding
with the Arc to consult with God for me, then to be with me still here. Borrh.

10. Quest. v. 30. Of David's going barefoote, and his head covered.
1. Some think that David's covering his head, was a sign here of subjection,
and the putting off his shoes of resigning the kingdom, which was a ceremony
used in Israel to signify the delivering over of the possession of a thing.
Borrh. But David knew it was not Gods will, that he should surrender the
kingdom to Abshalom, it was apppointed to Solomon. 2. Therefore these were
only signs of David's mourning; for so they which mourned used to cover their
heads, that their tears should not be seen of men, which were known unto
God. Mart. 3. And David is here a lively type of our Blessed Savior, who went
up the mount of Olives heavy unto death, as David goes up weeping here.
Osiander.

11. Quest. v. 34. Of David's counsel to Chusai, say unto Abshalom, I will be
thy servant: whether David did well in teaching him to dissemble.
1. Some are of opinion, that whereas there are three kind of lies, iocosum,
officiosum, perniciosum, a lie in jest, an officious, and a pernicious lie: the
two first they hold to be lawful: and that to make a charitable lie to do
good to some, and not to hurt others, is not unlawful. But this is no sound
opinion: for every lie with what pretense so ever it is made, is an offense:
because we do not speak the truth from the heart: and S. Paul's rule must be
observed, we must not do evil, that good may come of it. See more hereof, 1.
Sam. c. 21. qu. 13. qu. 14.

2. Osiander thinks that this dissembling of Chushai was an officious kind of
lie, which was not against charity, but it tended to preserve the life of the
King, and the state, and therefore neither David therein sinned in giving this
advise, nor Chushai in following it. But if it be granted that Chushai here
made a lie, it must needs follow, that it was not without offense.

3. Pelican resolves thus, that Chushai did here tell no lie: for he had
done indeed faithful service to Abshalom, if he would have been ruled by him,
and surceased to pursue his father: and his counsel was also in effect
profitable to him: for it was better that Abshalom was slain, then he should
have killed his father. But it is evident, that Chushai had no such intendment
to profit Absalom by his counsel, but to overthrow all his devises.

4. Wherefore either with Iunius it may be answered, that Chushai ambiguo
sermon ludificatur, does with ambiguous speech dally with Absalom, and so
tells not a lie: See c. 17.16.18.

5. Or else, as Pet. Martyr concludes, David might herein have Gods direction,
and then he sinned not; for God is above his own law: as Abraham in
attempting to sacrifice his son, the Israelites in taking from the Egyptians,
sinned not, because they did it by Gods direction. So if it be granted, that
Chushai here lied and dissembled, if he did it humano impulsu, by a man's mere
devise, he cannot altogether be excused. But if it were by Gods direction, they
offended not: as it may be gathered by this, both because presently after
David's prayer, that God would turn Achitophels counsel into foolishness,
Chushai is offered unto him, as the man, by whom his prayer should be effected:
and David speaks as a Prophet confidently, that by this means Achitophels
counsel should be brought to naught. It seems then that David herein was not
without some divine instinct. But we need not run here to such extraordinary
instinct to seek defense or excuse of this fact: the former solution may be
maintained, that Chushai did not tell a lie; nor is guilty of untruth in his
speech, but only used a doubtful and ambiguous kind of speech: first he
saluted Absalom, saying, God save the King, which he might as well understand
of David, as of Absalom. c. 16. v. 16. Again he says, whom the Lord and all
Israel, and all this people shall choose, his will I be: who else was that, but
David? And further he adds, as I served before thy father, so will I be
before thee: he professes in effect himself still David's servant. His whole
course of speech is ambiguous: he may be thought somewhat to dissemble, which
in it self simply is not unlawful; but he is not convinced of any untruth.

CHAP. 16.
1. Quest. v. 3. Of Ziba his unfaithfulness to his master Miphibosheth.
1. SAint Paul gives a rule unto servants, not to serve their masters with
eye-seruice: but Ziba herein first shows his unfaithful service: for in his
masters absence he accuses him, howsoever being present, he might seem to
please his masters eye. 2. His disobedience also appeared, that being bidden
to saddle his masters ass to meet the king, c. 19.26. he went and made him
ready for himself. 3. He goes about to rob his master, and seeks to
spoil him of all he had. 4. He is discontented with his estate, lift up in
pride, and thinks scorn any longer to serve Miphibosheth, thinking this a
fit time to get his liberty: Mar. 5. And to bring this about he plaieth the
flatterer, both presenting the King with gifts, and seems in words to
extenuate his gifts, as not worthy to be offered to the King. Osiand. 7. And,
which made up the full measure of his treachery; whereas a good servant should
have spoken in defense of his master, he most unfaithfully, and treacherously
accuses him unto David, and would in all likelihood, have been contented to
be his butcher, if so the King had pleased he should be slain. Mart.

2. Quest. Of David's rashness in giving unto Ziba Miphibosheths goods and
lands.
1. David is assaulted in this Chapter with two contrary temptations, of
flattery by Ziba, of railing by Shemei: he overcame the greater, and was
overcome of the less. So many times Gods children stand out in great
temptations, and give out in less; which shows their humane infirmity, and
what they are, being left unto themselves. 2. But there is great difference
between the slippes of the righteous, and the fall of the wicked: for these
are caught in the snare of temptation, and cannot wind themselves out, but
though the righteous stumbleth, yet he recouereth himself agine; as David
afterward made restitution unto Miphibosheth of that, which he had hastily
taken from him.

2. David shows himself very rash in precipitating his sentence against
Miphibosheth, his cause being unheard. It was a likely tale, that he told of
Miphibosheth, who was the only heir left of Saul's house: but all things that
are likely, are not true.

3. Beside David here shows his vnmindfulnesse of Ionathans kindness in time
past, and forgets the covenant which was made between them.

4. By this we see, how dangerous a thing it is for a Magistrate to receive
gifts, which blind even the eyes of the wise. Osiand.

5. And this mutabilitie in David, shows how vain and uncertain a thing it
is, to put any confidence in Princes. Mart.

3. Quest. v. 7. Of Sheme^ his cursing.
He utters many vile slanders against David: 1. He most falsely charge him
with the blood of Saul's house, whereas David was therein most innocent: for
Abner and Ishbosheth were slain against his will; and the wars that were
between the house of David, and the house of Saul, were procured by Abner, who
provoked Ioab to fight, 2. Sam. 2. 2. He makes David an usurper, as though he
had invaded and thrust himself to reign in Saul's stead; whereas David not
once dreaming of a kingdom, was thereunto called by the Lord, and anointed by
Samuel. 3. He justifies wicked Abshalom, saying, that God had delivered David's
kingdom into his hands, which was most untrue; Absalom was a most unjust and
ambitious man, and thought to deprive his father of his kingdom. 4. He says
that David was punished for his wickedness, which was true, but not for those
things whereof Shemei before challenged David.

4. Quest. v. 9. Of Abishai his inconsiderate zeal in David's cause.
1. Here we have two men, one speaks against David, the other defends
David: both speak in the behalf of their kinsmen: the one has a bad cause,
and yet handles it cunningly, as Shemei: the other had a good cause, the
defense of the king, but he handles it not well: both of them are lead with a
carnal mind to seek revenge. 2. Abishai is here carried away with a
preposterous zeal, as often the children of God are: So Jonas waighted still
to see the destruction of Nineveh: James and John, Luke 9. would have had fire
come down upon the Samaritans: This then proceeded not from any divine or
religious charity, but from an humane affection. 3. He calls Shemei dog,
in contempt: being compared with the king, he was no better then a dogs
head, that is, a vile person: as 1. Sam. 24.15.

5. Quest. v. 11. Why David charge his servants not to meddle with Shemei.
1. David looks unto Gods providence, who had so disposed to try David's
patience by Shemei his railing tongue. 2. He thus reasons by way of
comparison: he had endured the troubles and trialls procured by his son, who
sought his life: whereas Shemei was a stranger unto him, and did but rail upon
him in words: much more was it fit he should bear this reproach. 3. He shows
the fruit that might come of it, it may be that God would do him good for his
cursing: not that this affliction was the cause of his reward: but it is an
order and course, which the Lord observes to raise them up, whom he had
humbled; so he dealt with Joseph and Job. 4. And he speaks doubtfully,
because we have no certainty of these temporal things: but of his spiritual
state, his everlasting salvation David made no doubt at all.

6. Quest. v. 10. Whether David did well in bearing Shemei his reproachful
words: and what a reproach is, and how to be borne.
1. A reproach is offered either in word, as Shemei reviled David, or in deed,
as Abshalom defiled his fathers concubines, not so much of lust, as to disgrace
his father. 2. Reproaches, some are mere slanders, as those were, which
Shemei objected to David: some are true, as when one obiecteth such crimes as
are true, but after a reproachful manner. 3. Some reproachful words are
uttered by way of disgrace, and they are sin: some only are by way of
discipline to amend and correct, and make one ashamed of his sin: as when
Magistrates rebuke offenders, and ministers in their sermons sharply reprove
sin: as the Prophet Isay called the chief of Israel, Princes of Sodom, c.
1.10. and S. Paul says, O ye foolish Galatians: and such kind of reproaches
are not sin.

2. Reproachful and reuiling words proceed either from anger and desire of
revenge, as here in Shemei; or from pride, as in Rabsake against Hezekiah; or
from foolishness, as Nabal reviled David.

3. How we are to behave our selves in bearing of reproaches, these
considerations are necessary: 1. that generally we must follow that rule of
Christ; if one smite us on the one cheek, we should turn to him the other
also, that is not always to do so in fact, for Christ being smitten upon one
cheek did not turn the other: but our heart must always be prepared for
Christ's sake to suffer all wrongs in word, and in deed.

2. Yet there is a time when a fool must be answered in his foolishness, and
a reuiler must not be suffered to go away without a rebuke; as if either his
reproach tend to the hinderance of our good name or our brothers, and they
which hear it, are by our silence apt to believe the slander; and if a
discreet reproof may be a means to make him see his sin.

3. And there is a time, when a fool is not to be answered in his
foolishness, least we be like him; Prove. 16.4.
if we think that we shall grow too hot and cholerike, and exceed measure
in reproouing, it is better for us to hold our peace: and when we see in
respect of the slaunderer, that his word is of no credit, and our defense
needs not in respect of the standers by: or if the reuiler is like to be more
provoked by our admonition: in all these cases it is better to be silent.

4. And where defense is needful, it is not only lawful for us privately to
rebuke the slaunderer, but to make complaint unto the Magistrate, to preserve
our good name; as a theife of our goods may be brought before the Magistrate,
so much more he that steals away our good name.

5. And as concerning David, it was a worthy and commendable part in him to
bear Shemeis slanderous speech: for he was innocent, he therein considered
the Lords purpose to try him; it was then no time for him to seek revenge: he
had opportunity offered afterward to meet with this reuiler. Mart.

7. Quest. v. 10. How the Lord is said to have bid Shemei curse David, and
how sin stands with the will of God, and whether he is any way the author
thereof.
1. First, that God is no way the author of sin, by these and such like
reasons it is made plain. 1. God is not the author of any thing, whereby a man
is made worse: for if an artificer will not mar his own work, much less
God; but by sin man becomes much worse.

2. God is the revenger of sin, therefore not the author.

3. God hates nothing which he has made, but he hates sin.

4. He that does or procures sin is a sinner: but God cannot without
horrible blasphemy be said to be a sinner.

5. If God should provoke unto sin, we should make him a dissembler and an
hypocrite, who forbids one thing, and yet does an other.

6. The Lord says by his Prophet Hosea, thy destruction is of thy self, then
sin also the cause of destruction is of our selves.

7. Our Savior says, that when the devil speaks a lie, he speaks of his
own, sin then is peculiar unto the devil, therefore nor to God.

8. Christ wept over Jerusalem, being grieved for the calamity that should
befall it: much more was he grieved for sin, which was the cause thereof:
then is he not the author of sin.

9. Tyrants make severe laws, and then compel men to break them, that they
may punish them: So God should be a tyrant, if he procured or made men sin
and transgress his laws.

10. If God were the author of sin, he could not be the Judge of the world.

11. If God any ways should stir up unto sin, there must needs be two
contrary wills in God, one whereby he wills sin to be; the other, whereby
he disliketh it, and is displeased at it.

12. The wicked should be in no fault, for they might turn all the blame upon
God.

13. Men had no reason to be grieved for their sin, but to rejoice, seeing
they do that which God is the author of: if he were the author or worker of
sin.

14. If God would have men saved, then he would have them also use the means
unto salvation: then would he not have them sin, which does hinder their
salvation.

2. Secondly, the reasons on the contrary, that God may be charged with sin,
are these.

1. The Apostle says, Romans 1.26. that God gave up the Gentiles to vile
affections.

2. The Lord is said to have hardened Pharaohs heart: and Isa. 6.10. to make
the eyes of the Israelites heavy, and to shut their eyes.

3. We say in the Lords prayer, Lead us not into temptation.

4. He that is the cause of the cause, is the cause of the effect, procured by
that cause: But God is the cause and creator of man's will and affections, which
are the cause of sin: he may seem then to be the cause of sin.

5. The Lord said to the spirit, that offered to go and be a false spirit in
the mouths of Ahabs Prophets, go and prosper, 1. King. 22.

6. Sin is an action: but all actions proceed from God, the first moouer and
beginner: for in him we live, move, and have our being, Act. 17.

7. The Lord says by his Prophet Ezechiel, c. 14.8. If the Prophet be deceived
when he has spoken a thing, I the Lord have deceived him, etc. so Jeremy
says, cap. 4.10. that the Lord had deceived his people: so Isay says, 63.17.
O Lord, why have thou made us err from thy ways?

8. Psalm. 105.25. He turned the heart (of the Egyptians) to hate his people:
Josh. 11.20. It came of the Lord to harden their hearts, that they should come
against Israel in battle: 2 Thessalonians. 2.11. the Apostle says, He shall send
them strong delusions to believe lies.

9. As God wills the end, so also he wills the means which tend unto that
end: but it was Gods will that Christ should be delivered up unto death, and
that the members of Christ, as the holy Apostles and Martyrs should be tried:
thereof it was Gods will also that Judas should betray Christ, and that the
tyrants should raise persecution against his Church, which were sinful acts.

10. If God can hinder a man from sin, and will not, and take away from him
the helps, which should keep him from sin, he should seem to be accessarie
unto it: as if we see a man ready to fall into a pit, and forwarne him not of
it; or take from one a staff whereon he leans, so that he falls: we should
be guilty of his hurt: so it should seem to be between God and man; if he
should withdraw from him his grace, whereby he might stand.

11. Seeing God does bring forth substances by dishonest action, as children
begotten in adultery; why may he not as well produce actions, per malam
voluntatem, by the evil inclination and will of man?

12. The Apostles say in their prayer, that Herod and Pilate had assembled
themselves together, to do whatsoever thine hand and counsel had determined
before to be done: By these and such like places of Scripture, and reasons,
some show may be made that God has some hand in the sinful works of men.

3. In the third place the diverse opinions must be touched of this matter.

1. Some do indeed most blasphemously make God the author and worker of
evil, as the Libertines: which blasphemy is to be abhorred, and to be
condemned to hell with the authors thereof.

2. There are that understand these places of Scripture of Gods permission
only.

3. Some do think that God is an agent even in evil actions, which as they
proceed from man are evil, but as God concurreth it is just, the reason
whereof if we cannot comprehend, we must rest in the judgment of the
Scripture: this opinion shall afterward be more fully declared and confirmed.

4. Further, it must be considered what sin is; it is not a substance, nor
yet any subject or habit in a subject, but only a defect and privation, as
blindness is of the sight: and malum esse non potest nisi in bono, evil cannot
be but in that which is good, as blindness is in the sight: evil is of two
sorts, it is either culpa, the fault, or poena, the punishment: the fault is
the absence or privation of some virtue or grace, and the punishment is the
privation of some benefit, as sickness is of health: and there is something
that is both a sin and punishment, as original sin.

5. Now more fully and distinctly to determine of this question, these
conclusions following shall be set down.

1. God properly is not the cause of evil, nor author of sin: for the habit
never of it self produces the privation, as light brings not forth
darkness: but if the light be removed, then the darkness follows of it
self. But like as the Sun is not the cause of darkness; but the Sun
being removed from our hemisphere, then darkness of it self succeeds: so
when God takes away his grace (which he does to make man know and understand,
that he can do nothing without grace) then follows darkness and ignorance
in our hearts. So that God is not properly the cause of sin, but only
remouens, the remoouing cause: So that there need no efficient or positive
cause to be made of sin, as the Maniches made two Princes, the one of light,
to whom they ascribed, why was good, and the others of darkness, whom they
made the beginning of evil: for by the absence of light and grace, darkness
and evil do succeed of themselves by the corruption of our nature.

2. Here we must consider of a threefold action of God. 1. One is general in
the works of his providence, whereby every thing is preserved and maintained
in it kind and nature: for in him we move, we live, and have our being. 2. An
other is special and particular, whereby he works all good things in his
Saints. 3. The third is between both, whereby God carries an ouer-ruling hand
in all actions, making all things good and bad, reasonable and unreasonable
creatures to serve unto his glory, and to be instruments of his will. And thus
God disposes even of the sinful acts of men, that thereby his will is
effected and accomplished, and yet he is no way accessarie to their sin: so
that in the same act, God and man's will may concur, but after a diverse
manner: God may justly will that, and to a good end, which man wills wickedly
and unjustly; as God determined the death of Christ for the redemption of
mankind, but Judas betrayed him of a wicked mind, and Satan provoked Judas as
an enemy unto God and the truth. And Augustine further shows how in the same
thing God wills and man wills, Euchirid. ad Laurent. c. 10.
but diversely, by this instance. A wicked sons father is sick, Gods will is
he shall die, and so the wicked son desires he should die also, but to an
other end, that he may enjoy his inheritance. So likewise one may will that
which God wills not, and yet be without sin: As the good child of love
toward his father desires his life, whom Gods will and pleasure is shall die
of that sickness.

3. God may minister an occasion which of it self is good, but the wicked
abusing it, are thereby stirred up to do evil: as when Moses and Aaron
brought a message unto Pharaoh to let his people go: Pharaoh thereupon was
incensed to oppress the people more grievously: so God might be said to harden
Pharaohs heart, but occasionaliter, and accidentaliter, by ministering an
occasion, and accidentally only.

4. The Lord also permissiue, by way of permission, may be said to have on hand
even in evil actions, which he permits to be done; which his permission is
in him a kind of will: for if he permitted or suffered any thing nolens,
against his will, it would show an impotencie and want of power; but even in
Gods permission his power appears: so permitting evil to be done in the
world, as he knows how to make it serve for his glory: and so he permits
sin, as that he so disposes, that it shall not rage or reign in all, nor in
all times, nor further then he sees it to be for his glory: But good actions
the Lord wills after an other sort: not only permitting them to be done,
but effecting, working, finishing, and perfitting in us every good work.

5. Further, there are three things to be considered in sin: 1. The guilt of
sin, which is nothing else, but obligatio ad poenam, a binding and tying of
him that sins unto punishment: and this is an act of Gods justice, who after
one has sinned, holds him guilty of punishment. 2. Then there is the act of
sin, which is the subject; and this God is the cause of, who gives power to
move, to will to do this or that unto his creatures, which power he
restrains not, but suffers every thing which he has made, and enableth it
also to exercise the natural properties and faculties thereof: Thus God is the
author of the action, but the euilnes of the action proceeds from man's
corrupt nature: like as the soul and life in the body, is the cause it
moves, but the lamenesse of the leg or other part affected, is the cause of
the halting thereof: So God as an universal agent, gives life and motion to
his creatures, as the soul does to the body, but the abusing and deprauing of
these actions, arises from the corruption of man's nature. 3. There is in sin
the punishment to be considered: So God is said to punish sin with sin, as
the Apostle shows how the Lord gave over the Gentiles to a reprobate sense;
and to vile affections as a punishment of their Idolatry, Romans 1.

In this manner, as has been showed, how the Lord may be said to have to do
with sin: but he is no way the author thereof, or properly the cause: And
that is no imperfection in God, that he cannot sin, nor will sin, but it is
his perfection: who being perfect goodness it self, cannot abide any thing
that is evil: for if he should will sin to be, he should turn men from
himself, which were to deny himself, which as the Apostle says, God cannot
do; God cannot deny himself, 2. Tim. 2.13. This th^n is the sum of all,
that God is not properly the cause of evil, but 1. either by removing and
withholding his grace. 2. by disposing in his infinite wisdom and power, even
of evil actions to serve his glory. 3. by ministering occasion, which the
wicked may abuse and pervert to their further hardening. 4. in permitting
things to be done, as far as he sees expedient for the universal good. 5.
the guilt of sin in justice he procures. 6. the general action he causes.
7. as it is a punishment, he inflicteth it, etc.

7. Now according to these conclusions set down, the former reasons which
seemed to make God accessarie unto evil, may thus be answered.

1. God is said to give up the Gentiles to vile affections, because he left
them to themselves, and justly deprived them of his grace.

2. God hardened Pharaohs heart, and blinded the Israelites eyes,
occasionaliter, by ministering the occasion, which they abused: Gods works were
an occasion of Pharaohs hardening, and his word of the others blinding, but not
of themselves: the other through their perverseness took occasion to do
evil, where none was given, and turned that which was good, to be an occasion
of evil.

3. The Lord is said to lead into temptation, because the devil, who is the
tempter, can do no more then God permits: God tempts not to evil, as he
is not tempted, Iam. 1. And we of our selves are tempted of our own
concupiscence: therefore our Savior says to his Apostles, watch and pray,
least ye enter into temptation, Matthew. 26.41.

4. God is the creator of man's will, but not of his corrupt will, which is the
cause of sin, and not his will simply, as God created it.

5. When God says to the evil spirit, go and prosper, that is to be referred
to the end, which was the death and punishment of Ahab: but the means which
was by being a lying spirit, God willed not nor commanded to be done, but
hindered not the doing of it, because the Lord knew how to use it to his glory.

6. It is not denied, but that the subject of sin, which is the action in
general is from God, who is the moouer of all things: but it follows not
that the euilnesse of the action therefore is from God.

7. God is said to deceive the Prophet and people, not in respect of the cause
thereof, which proceeded from their own corrupt heart: but in regard of the
event, because God used that seduction for their punishment.

8. God is said to turn their hearts to hatred, because the prosperity of the
Hebrews, which God caused, gave occasion of envy and hatred to the Egyptians:
the hearts of the Canaanites were hardened, non emolliendo, because God
mollified them not. And so God gave them which believed not the truth, strong
delusions, as a just judge punishing their hardness of heart and unbelief, with
blindness and perverseness.

9. God wills the means, but after an other manner: his will is, that
persecutions should be, not simply, but as they tend to his glory, and to the
propagation of the truth.

10. It is cruelty in man, if he suffer one to fall and help him not, because
a man is bound in charity to do it: but God is bound to none: many graces he
gives unto the wicked, which they abuse: he is not bound to give all, he may
do with his own, as it pleases him.

11. God is the author of the action, which brings forth evil; but not of
the euilnesse of the action.

12. Concerning the death and suffering of Christ, God willed it in respect of
the end, which was our redemption: the meane^, as the treachery of Judas, the
malice of the Jews, he ordained not, but disposed; he willed not, but used
them.

8. Quest. How Gods providence and man's will may stand together.
Here are two errors to be taken heed of in two extremes: Some do so hold
Gods providence, as that they exempt some things from it: some on the contrary
do ascribe all things to the divine providence, as that they impose a
necessity upon the will of man, depriving the same of the natural liberty
and freedom thereof.

1. Of the first opinion was Plato, affirming that there are many things in the
world which God is no ways the cause of, Lib. 2. de Republic.
as of evil things; which is true, if he speak of the proper efficient cause
of sin: but yet even in such things Gods providence sleeps not, directing,
ordering, and disposing evil things unto such end, as seems best unto
himself.

2. Damascene also in some sort impugneth Gods providence, when he says, that
(...), that only those things which are not within us, not the things within
us, Lib. ^. de fide. c. 29.
are subject to Gods providence: whereas the Prophet David says directly,
Psalm. 139. thou understand my thoughts long before. He has an other
assertion as dangerous, That the election of things to be done is in us, the
perfection and consummation, of the concurring operation of God: whereas the
Apostle says, that God works in us both the will and deed, Philip. 2.13.
of his good pleasure.

3. But that distinction of Damasus is not to be misliked, whereby he divides
Gods providence into (...), his good pleasure, and (...), permission and
concession: for Gods providence is seen in willing and acting of good things,
his permission in suffering evil things to be done, not by a bare permission in
leaving men to themselves to do altogether what they list, but in using them
and ouerruling them. This concession he further makes of two sorts, dividing
it into (...), oecomicall or disciplinarie concession, in leaving his children
sometime to themselves, for their further instruction: there is an other
concession (...), absolute and final, whereby he suffers the wicked and
inccorrigible finally to fall without recovery.

2. In the other extreme are they which so hold the diuin^ providence, as that
they bring in a fatal necessity: But God constrains no man's will: for if it
be forced, it is not a will which wills freely. But here there is a threefold
liberty of the will to be considered: there is libertas a coactione, a
liberty and freedom from coaction, in all men good and bad: libertas a
peccato, a liberty from sin, that is, from the dominion thereof, when the
will is regenerate: and libertas a miseri^, a liber^ie and immunitie from
misery, which shall be in the kingdom of God, when we are glorified. But a
liberty a necessitate, from a kind of necessity, man now has not: he cannot
choose but sin. Adam before he fell had this liberty also: for it was in his
power not to have sinned, if he would: but now a necessity of bondage and
corruption is laid upon his posterity: but yet the mind of natural men work
freely in respect of any violence, constraint, or coaction.

9. Quest. v. 16. Of Cushai his salutation to Absalom, God save the King:
whether therein he did well.
1. Some to excuse this fact, think that Cushai, saying, let the King live:
that he meant eternal life, wishing that Abshalom might take such a course,
as might not hinder his salvation: but the meaning of this phrase, in saluting
of their kings, was nothing else but to wish them prosperity: as the Chalde
interpreter reads.

2. Some think that Cushai here lied evidently, m^ntitur impissimo tyranno, he
lied unto this wicked tyrant: seeming as though God, and all the people of
Israel, had chosen Abshalom: and he takes that miscreant-companie for the
Church of God: Martyr. so also Josephus shows how he uses two reasons for
his dissimulation: one, because God had chosen Abshalom king, the other the
kingdom was not devolued unto a stranger, but descended unto the son. But
seeing that Chushai herein followed David's direction, and immediately upon his
prayer, I cannot think, that David would be the author of such palpable
flatt^rie.

3. Osiander thinks it was mendacium officiosum, an officious lie, which was
no sin: but every lie is sin, as is showed before, qu. 11. c. 15.

4. Therefore as I there resolved with Iunius, Chushai rather deludeth Abshalom
with ambiguous speech: and uses a kind of ironia: Borrh. speaking by the
contrary: and all this was thus disposed, diuina prouidentia, by the divine
providence: Chushai cannot be excused from some humane infirmity in this his
dissimulation, yet it is too much to charge him with lying and flattery: for
he sought not any advantage to himself, as flatterers do, but only the safety
and preservation of the Lords anointed. In respect whereof, excusandus est a
tanto, si non a toto, he may be excused if not altogether, yet from so great a
sin: Pelican. as in the imputation of lying and flattery: See more hereof
before, qu. 11. c. 15.

10. Quest. v. 19. Of the truth of Chushai his speech, as I served thy father,
so will I be before thee.
1. True it is, that when good Magistrates are removed, and worse come in
their place, we must yield obedience unto them in all lawful things, so long
as they command not things contrary to the word of God. As the Romans were
obedient to Julius Caesar, after he had spoiled them of their liberty, and to
the Emperor Phocas having slain Mauritius.

2. But the case is diverse here, for neither was David dead, and therefore
Abshalom was an usurper, his father yet living: and other Princes have not the
express word of God for their government, as David had who was anointed by
Samuel; and therefore the people here were to obey none other but David.

3. The like may be said, when good Ministers are expelled, and alij
instituuntur non ita boni, and others not so good are set in their place: all
good means must be used, by prayer and such like, that good Ministers be not
cast out: sed si alij substituuntur, audiendi sunt, but if others be
substituted in their place, they must be heard as long as they preach the
truth. Mart.

11. Quest. v. 21. Of Achitophels perverse counsel to Abshalom to go in to
his fathers concubines.
1. Achitophel gives counsel contrary to the word of God: he would have
Abshalom lie with his fathers concubines or wives, which was forbidden by Gods
law: but he respects his own profit, more then the glory of God. 2. For
this was his policy, to make Abshalom odious to his father, that there might
be no hope of reconciliation: for he feared, least if that Abshalom should be
received to his fathers favor, all they that took his part, should go to
wrack. 3. This was very probable, but not necessary: for though Ruben had
defiled his fathers bed, yet Jacob did not utterly cast him off from being
counted among his brethren, though he deprived him of his birthright. And David
notwithstanding this villainy, yet altogether withdrew not his affection from
his son, as appears by his mourning for him. 4. The Hebrews think that
Achitophel herein did revenge his own quarrel, because David had committed
adultery with Bathsheba, who was Achitophels niece by his son Eliam: who was
the son of Achitophel, and is numbered among David's worthies, c. 23.14. 5.
This Achitophel was such another crafty man, and wicked counselor to
Abshalom, as Ionadab before was to Amnon. If David's house were not void of such
flaterers and wicked counselors, it is no marvel, if they abound in Princes
Coures in these days. 6. Abshalom here now bewraieth himself by this
abominable act, that he was not revenged of Amnon so much for his incest, as of
malice and spite, seeing here he commits more grievous incest himself:
Mart. 7. But this fell out by Gods providence, as the Prophet Nathan had told
David before, that he should be thus corrected for his sin of adultery.
Borrh.

12. Quest. How this incest of Abshalom might stand with Gods will.
1. It is certain, that all things which are foreseen of God, shall
necessarily come to pass, and praevideri non quia futura sunt, and that they
are foreseen, not because they shall come to pass, but therefore they shall
come to pass, because they are foreseen. 2. It also follows that nothing
falls out by chance, but according to the decree and foresight of God. 3.
But further, there is great difference between the inevitable necessity of
the counsels of God, and necessity which is by compulsion and coaction:
notwitstanding God foreseeth the sins of men, which therefore are inevitable,
yet they commit them freely and willingly, as Abshalom did this incest here. As
God is by an inevitable necessity good, and Satan evil: the one can not be
otherwise then good, nor the other then evil: yet God is freely good without
compulsion, and so is Satan evil: Borrh.

13. Quest. v. 23. Why Achitophels counsel is likened to the Oracle of God.
1. Iunius refers it to this present counsel of Achitophel, which though it
were in it self most horrible and wicked, yet it was applauded by the ungodly,
as most sound counsel: but the text speaks not only of this time, but of
his former counsels in the days of David. 2. So that Achitophels counsel is
not so called only in respect of that authority which it had in the opinion
of men: Osiand. 3. But because of the good success, which his counsel used to
have. Genevens. And this counsel, which he gives now, though it were wicked,
yet it was for the present time very perilous and pestilent. 4. His counsel
was so esteemed of in David's time also: but with this difference; David
approved of his counsel, as he found it agreeable to Gods word: but Abshalom
and his company follow it howsoever, if it served their turn: yet this is an
hyperbolical speech, comparatio est non aequiparatio, it is a comparison only,
not an equalizing of his counsel unto the oracle of God, unless it were in
the opinion of carnal and worldly wise men. Mar. 5. And such a wise man was
Achitophel, carnally or worldly, not religiouslly wise: such wisdom as may be
and is given many times to wicked men. Borrh.

CHAP. 17.
1. Quest. v. 1. Of Achitophels peruers^ and wicked counsel against David.
1. Counsel of it self is a sacred thing, and commended in the Scripture; and
as it is of necessary use in all affairs, so specially in battle, which must
be enterprised by counsel, Prou. 24.6. But here it is abused by this crafty
man. 2. Who offends three ways in this his counsel: in the matter, which is
consulted of, the means, and the end. 1. For the matter, there are two things,
that do not fall under consultation; either such as are certain and
necessary, and cannot be prevented, or things which are subject to chance,
and have no certainty at all: but of such things counsel is taken, which are
elective, and incident into humane affairs: herein then first Achitophels
counsel fails, because he gives counsel in a thing impossible: God had
determined, that David's kingdom should be established. 2. The means in
deliberation should be honest, but these which he propounds, are most
dishonest. 3. The end also is ungodly, in seeking to overthrow the Lords
Anointed. Mar.

3. Now the special cause, why Achitophel is thus bent against David, was for
that he ambitiously aspired to honor and riches: as he was reputed a wise
counselor, so now he takes upon him to be the Captain and leader of
Abshaloms army, that he might every way grow great, and in high reputation
with Abshalom and the people. The Hebrews give another reason of his hatred
against David, because of Bathsheba, which is touched before, c. 16. qu. 11.

2. Quest. v. 3. Of the meaning of these words, As the returning of all, (is)
the man, whom thou seek.
1. Some read thus, when all shall return, and the man, whom thou seek,
(being slain) C.G.B. but there these words, being slain are added, which
are not in the text. 2. Some thus, when all the men are returned unto thee,
whom thou desire. V.A. But there is a distinction, at hacol, all, which
shows that it is severed from the word following haish, the man: which word
having an article prefixed before it, shows some special man. 3. The Latin
reads thus, I will bring ^ll the people again, as one man uses to return:
for thou seek one man: for here in the former clause, as one man, and in the
next, one, are not in the original. 4. The Septuag. thus, like as (the spouse)
returns (to) her husband: here these words enclosed (the spouse) and (to)
are not found in the text. 5. Some give this sense, and when every man is
returned, (which is the thing) which thou seek. Emman. Sa. But there is a
distinction at hachal, every, or all; which shows, that it is not joined in
construction with haish, man, as the substantive and adjective, as is before
showed. 6. Therefore I here prefer Iunius reading, as the returning of all,
(is) the man, whom thou seek: that is, when thou get test him, thou shall in
a manner get all.

3. Quest. v. 7. Of Chushai his counsel in general.
1. Chushai very wisely does not discommend Achitophels counsel in general,
least he might have been thought to speak of envy, or be suspected as a
dissembler: but he does (at this time) only take exception to his counsel, as
giving him the praise of a wise counselor at other times. Mart. Iun. 2. Beside
Chushai shows his modesty, not preferring himself before Achitophel, but
giving him simply the prioritie of sound counsel and advise: only in this one
thing, and at this time he dissenteth from him. Osiand. 3. Chushai very
wisely among other suggestions, which were improbable, mingleth diverse things
which are true, as v. 8. that his father was a valiant man, and expert in
war, and of great courage: for he knew, without the inserting of some things
evidently true, he should hardly persuade the rest. Mart. 4. Beside Chushai
does cunningly apply himself to the ambitious and insolent young man's humor,
insinuating what a mighty people, and large kingdom he had, from Dan to
Beersheba, and so Abshalom allectus laudibus suis, being allured by his own
praise, gives ear unto Chushai: Pellic. 5. Further his faithfulness
appears toward David: for the end of Chushai was to gain time, that David
should not be set upon of a sudden, but have respite given him to provide for
himself, and to be better prepared. Mart. 6. He is wary also and circumspect:
for though his counsel were approved, yet he would not trust Abshalom; he
might think his mind might alter, and therefore he sends word presently
unto David. v. 15.

4. Quest. Of the several and particular points of Chushai his counsel.
First, Chushai does infringe Achitophels counsel by five several arguments.
1. He alleges that David was himself a valiant man, and the rest of his
people, that were with him. 2. And beside their ordinary valor, being thus
suddenly assaulted, they would be so much the more fierce, as a bear robbed of
his whelps: not her whelps, as B.G.L.S. for the word dobh is put in the
masculine, as is evident by the participle shacul put in the masculine: for the
he bear, as well as the she does help to hatch up their young, and both do
rage, when their whelps are taken away: Borrh. 3. Thy father is an expert
warrier, and a wary man, he has his watch, he will not lodge as a common
soldier with the rest, but will withdraw himself. 4. He urges the
inconueniencie of the place, he is hid in some cave, so that their labor
should be frustrate in seeking him. 5. He shows the danger, that if they
should presently join battle in the night, if but a few of Absalons men
should be slain, it would be noised, that al his forces were discomfited. Mar.
And in this manner Chushai showed the weakness of Achitophels counsel.

2. Then he comes to give contrary advise: in every point opposing
himself to Achitophel. 1. Whereas Achitophel had advised to follow after David
presently that night, Chushai would have some further time taken till more
forces might be gathered together. 2. Achitophel required but 12. thousand;
Chushai would have all the people gathered together, as the sand of the sea in
multitude. 3. Achitophel would go himself as Captain of the army, but
Chushai persuades Abshalom to go in his own person. 4. Achitophel pretended
to take the King his father only, v. 2. but Chushai shows a course to be
taken, that neither he nor any one of his men should be left: Borrh. 5. And
the better to persuade, he shows the facility of this enterprise: ^ow
easily they shall vanquish him, either in the field, by falling upon him, as
the dew in multitude, or if he get himself within a city, they will pull it
with ropes, that is, engines of war fastened with ropes into the river, that
is, the ditches and trenches filled with water, which environed the walled
towns. Mar.

5. Quest. v. 14. Of the approbation of Chushai his counsel before Achitophels.
1. By this example we see, that it is not enough to have good counsel
propounded, but it is necessary to have a good judgment to discern of
counsels which is the best: Achitophel gave here most dangerous, and
pernicious counsel, but Abshalom was blinded, that he saw not, what was good
for himself. Mar. 2. It is therefore called the good counsel of Achitophel,
not that it was simply good, for the Lord then would not have destroyed it; but
it was good and profitable for Abshalom, not that any thing indeed is good and
profitable, which is not honest, but this is so said according to the phrase
and speech of men, which use to call those things good, which are commodious
and profitable. 3. This came of God, that Achitophels counsel should be
rejected: so that Chushai can not be here accused, mendacij and simulationis
improbae, of lying and wicked dissembling, it being by Gods direction. Borrh.
4. And the end is showed, why the Lord destroyed the counsel of Achitophel,
that Abshalom might be punished: who was guilty of two horrible sins,
rebellion and parricide intended against his father, and incest in the highest
degree: therefore he was worthily punished, and by Chushai his counsel, he
was brought into that battle, where he was slain.

6. Quest. v. 15. Whether Chushai did well to discover the counsel of
Achitophel.
1. If Chushai were not sworn to keep secret this counsel, therein there was
no offense at all: nay he had sinned, if he had not revealed it, seeing the
king and the commonwealth were now in great danger: otherwise it is the part
of counselors to be faithful in keeping to themselves the counsels of the
kingdom: In ff. de re militar. l. omni.
by the Civil law it was made death, to betraie the secrets of the state,
especially in warlike and military affairs: Papinus is commended in the
Roman Histories, because he would not reveal to his mother, being but a
child, the secret consultations of the Senate.

2. Yea though Chushai had taken an oath to be secret in this case, he might
lawfully break his oath: seeing it was an unlawful oath against the glory of
God, and tending to the ruin and subversion of the Commonwealth. Mart.

7. Quest. Of Gods providence in delivering the messengers from danger, that
were sent to David.
1. The Priests within the city, Zadok and Abiathar could not themselves go
forth of the city, without suspicion, the gates being kept and watched, but
they sent a maid with the message unto their sons, that waited in the field,
of whose fidelity they had experience: so David's safety depended here upon
the faithfulness of a maid: God many times uses weak means to deliver his
servants by. 2. This matter is espied by a young man, not (as Josephus says)
by Abshaloms horsemen, as the Devil never wants instruments in such case^ to
work mischief. 3. But by Gods providence, the messengers escaped, and were
hid in a dry pit, where it seems there was small store of water, such an
one, as that was, into which Joseph's brethren let him down: which being
covered with a cloth whereon ground corn was spread, by the wife of the house,
was not discerned: the woman making a present excuse (as that sex is very
ingenious in their ready inventions, Osiand.) that they were gone: this excuse
of the woman, was like unto that of the midwiues in Egypt, Exodus 1. and of
Rahab: the good service, which she did, and her faithful heart to God and his
Anointed, do hide her womanly infirmity therein. 4. Thus, although that God
had certainly determined, that David's kingdom should be confirmed, and the
Lord had promised him by his Prophet Nathan, that he should not die: yet all
cautelous means, and circumspection is used of every side, that Gods decree
might take place: for though we be sure of Gods favor, yet the means must
not be neglected.

8. Quest. v. 22. How David escaped and passed over Jordan.
1. David was here driven to a great straight, who being wearied with the
travail of the day, and grieved also and perplexed in mind trauaileth all
night till he came to Jordan, and was passing over till the dawning of the day:
he was not far from Baburim, Pelican. which was not above four or five
miles from Ierushalem, for it was but two miles from Anathoth, which was
distant some three miles from the city, in Iosu. c. 22. v. 17.
Mas. ex Hieronym. when the messengers came to him: so that he traveled all
night, and that with great speed, that he might come to Jordan, and have time
to pass over it. 2. But David in this extremity finds great comfort, that
God so strengthened them, that there was not one of his company missing, but
all safly went over Jordan. 3. Wherein David was an evident type of Christ, who
lost not any of those which were committed unto him, saving the child of
perdition. Mart. This Jordan which saved David and his company going and
returning, Borrhaius also makes a type of baptism, which saves those, which
are baptized indeed into the death of Christ.

9. Quest. Of Achitophels desperate end.
1. Achitophel is assaulted with two violent affections at once, fear and
pride: for if David prevailed, which thing he foresaw was like to come to
pass, his counsel being rejected, then he feared, that David would be
revenged of him for his treachery: for he measured him by himself: if
Abshalom had the better, yet he saw he should live in disgrace, because his
counsel was refused: and so he hangs himself in despair. Mar.

2. Thus it falls out, that wicked counsel does chiefly redound to the hurt
of the author thereof. Borrh.

3. This wicked man set his house in an order before he died, but he has no
care of his soul: all his mind is of his money, goods, lands, but of his
soul he is careless: he bethinketh not himself what should become of that,
as many other worldly men do. Mar.

4. This Achitophel is here an evident type and forerunner of the traitor
Judas, who by his treacherous counsel betraying his Master hanged himself, as
here Achitophel does, that betrayed David; the like end to like Counselors
God send.

10. Quest. v. 25. Of Iithrah the father of Amasa, and Nahash.
1. Iithrah is here called an Israelite, but 1. Chron. 2.17. he is said to be
an Ismaelite: R. Kimhi thinks he was an Israelite by nation and kindred, but
an Ismaelite by habitation: so also Vatablus: but he was an Ismaelite rather by
nation, and an Israelite in habitation: Iun. because here he had his wife, and
here were his children. 2. Nahash some take for Ishai David's father, who had
two daughters, Zeruiah, who had three sons, Ioab, Abishai, and Asahel; and
Abigail the mother of Amasa: and R. Kimhi thinks he was called Nahash, or
Nachash, which signifies a serpent, by the contrary, because he was without
any venom or bitterness: And some do further show this out of that place,
Isai. 14.29. Out of the serpents root shall come a cockatrice: where the word
Nachash is put: which they expound of Hezekiah, that was descended of the root
of Ishai: but out of such prophetical predictions, where all things are
uttered in parables and figurative speeches, no certainty of historical names
can be gathered. Therefore this Nahash seems rather to be the name of a woman
Abigails mother, not the sister of Zeruiah as Osiander; but the wife of Ishai.
Iun.

11. Quest. v. 27. Of Shebi the son of Nahash that came to succor David, who
he was.
1. R. Solomon thinks that this Shebi was the same, who before was called
Hanun King of Ammon, who so despightfully used David's messengers, who after the
victory was preserved, and became a Proselyte of the Israelites religion: but
that is not like, because after the first discomfiture, Ioab a whole year
laid seige to Rabbah, which business they needed not to have been put unto,
if Hanun had yielded.

2. R. David Kimhi thinks he was an Israelite: but the text says, that he
was of Rabbath of the children of Ammon.

3. Some think he was the son of Hanun: but the text says, he was the son
of Nahash: and if he had been Hanuns son, it is like he would have rather
revenged his fathers quarrel.

4. Their opinion is then more probable, that think this Shebi to have been
the brother of Hanun, both sons to Nahash, whom David showed mercy unto in
the overthrow of Rabbah: and he to requite David's kindness, now comfort
him: Mart. Borrh. Osiand. Josephus calls him Siphar, a prince of the
Ammonites country.

12. Quest. v. 27. Of the compassion and relief, which was showed and
ministered to David.
1. David is persecuted of his son, and his nephew Amasa his sisters son is
the Captain of the host against him: he finds more favor at the hands of
strangers, even of the Ammonites, which had been his enemies, then of his own
kindred: as Christ was received of the Samaritans, when the Jews rejected him.
Mart. 2. Their mercy is much to be commended in these three respects: they
minister relief unto David unasked, they come of themselves, Shebi, Machir,
Barzillai: Mart. and they succor David in great extremity, when the people
were both hungry and thirsty, v. 29. and at such a time, as was most
dangerous, the conspiracy against David being so strong. 3. And this is
worthy to be considered, that such a victorious and rich King as David was,
now has not a bed to lie on, or any earthen vessel to wash his hands in; for
all these things were brought him: which is a mirrhor for Princes to see the
uncertainty of their estate, and how soon their honor may be laid in the
dust. 4. And herein David was a type of the true David, who in the days of his
flesh was hungry, weary, thirsty, and ministered unto by others: Pelican.

CHAP. 18.
1. Quest. v. 1. Whence David had the great supply of men.
THey come unto him partly with those his friends, which brought him victuals,
c. 17.28. partly the tribes of Ruben, Gad, and Manasses, which inhabited beyond
Jordan came flocking unto David, for these reasons: 1. They abhorred such
unnatural disobedience in the son against the father. 2. They were more
remote from the Court, and loved the King the better. 3. And being far off,
they were not corrupted and entised with Abshaloms flattery, as the other
were. Pelican.

2. Quest. v. 3. Why the people would not have David go with them in person.
1. They knew that David was the man, that was sought for, as Achitophel had
said before, that they would smite him alone, c. 17.2. and therefore they will
have him stay at home. Pelican.

2. As Hushai had given counsel, that Achitophel should go in person, because
the Lord had determined to bring upon him destruction, c. 11.14. so it falls
out by Gods direction, that David should not go into the battle, that he
might be preserved. Borrh.

3. When they should perceive that David was not present, they would not pursue
the rest so eagerly, nor greatly care almost for the victory: Osiand. 4. And
David also staying at home, might assist them out of the city with his
counsel, Pell. and prayer, Chapter and with supply of the battle, if need were.
Joseph.

3. Quest. Of the meaning of these words, v. 3. thou art as ten thousand of
us.
1. Some expound it thus, for there are about ten thousand of us: Vatab. but
beside that, there is no certainty of the number, which Josephus thinks,
exceeded not four thousand: in this sense it has small coherence with the
words before going, though half of us were dead, they would not pass for us.
2. Some of the Hebrews do thus understand it, though ten thousand such as we
should be slain, they would not care: but here beside that these words should
be slain, are not in the text, this in effect they said before, if half of us
should be dead, how many soever they were. 3. Others thus, though as we are now
we should be ten thousand: Iun. that is, ten times so many as we are, they
would not care: but if this were spoken by way of comparison, their meaning
should be, if they were ten thousand times more, not ten times more. 4.
Therefore I prefer the usual reading, bur, thou art as ten thousand of us,
by the enterlacing of these words, thou art: for beside that most interpreters
consent herein, the Chald. Septuag. Latin. Pagnin. Pellic. Borrh. Osiand. it
best agrees with the sense, and answers to the other part of the comparison,
they care not for us though half of us be killed, but thou art the man, more
worth then ten thousand of us, whom they seek for: as also the conclusion
inferred, that it were better therefore for him to stay in the city, does more
fitly depend upon this sense: as also the peoples speech has herein relation
unto Achitophels, who had said before, c. 17.3. that one man whom they sought
was as the returning of all the people.

5. Now they say, David was as ten thousand; 1. both because his counsel, and
the efficacy of his prayers would stand them in as much stead as ten thousand:
Pellic. 2. and in respect of his dignity and excellency, he was worthy so to
be esteemed. Borrh. 3. as also in respect of his enemies, who had rather have
his life, then the lives of ten thousand: Iun. 4. and the commonwealth should
sustain greater loss by his death, then if ten thousand of them were slain.
Osiand.

4. Quest. Why David was wished to stay in the city.
1. Iunius reads, If thou watch for our sake to help: the word megher, he
would have derived from ghur, to watch, not from gher, a city: that he should
watch his time to help them if need were: but if the word were so derived, it
should be compounded of the preposition min, which signifies from, which would
make a contrary sense; as Hosh. 7.4. from watching or raising, as though he
should now leave watching.

2. The usual reading then is to be preferred: they would have him help them
out of the city, that is, Mahanaim, whether David was come, chap. 17.24. from
thence he should help, 1. by his prayer, Chald. 2. by his counsel and advise:
Pellic. Vatabl. 3. by rescuing the army if they should be put to flight, into
the city: Osiand. 4. and by renewing the battle, and encouraging the
soldiers, the enemy also surmising, that David stayed behind with a new
supply. Joseph. lib. 7. c. 9.

5. Quest. out of v. 3. What number of men David had in his army.
1. Josephus thinks, there were about four thousand of them, and not above:
but that is not like, because David appointed captains over hundreds, and over
thousands; and beside ranged his host into three battles, v. 2. this shows
that his number was greater then of four thousand.

2. Some think, that he had ten thousand or thereabout: Vat. as it may appear
by his reading before, qu. 3. but it seems their number was not so great,
because they were victualled by three men, Sheba, Machir, and Barzillai, c.
11.17.27. which had been enough for a king to do.

3. It may be also coniectured, that they were 20. thousand, because they made
mention of the half part of them before, and now giving this instance of ten
thousand, to the which they prefer David, it may be supposed that to be the
half part; sic fere Pellic. But this opinion is refused for the reason before
alleged.

4. Wherefore, as their number is like not to have been so small as of four
thousand, so neither is it probable it was so great as of ten or twenty
thousand: I therefore take the middle scantling; there might be some six
thousand, or somewhat more, but under ten: to each of the three wings two
thousand or thereabout might be assigned: for if the number had been so great,
the victory had not been so glorious: and David's host consisted most of his
domestical followers and friends, and therefore they are called his servants,
v. 7.

6. Quest. v. 4. In what place David stood, when he saw the people go out by
their armies.
1. Some think, that David stood before the gate, toward the high way: Chald.
where they use to sit to behold the co^mers by, as Lot sat at the gate of
Sodom, Genesis 19.1. Vatab. 2. Some that he sat near the gate: Lat. or at the
side of the gate: S.B.G. not in the very gate, where the soldiers were to go
through. 3. But the words are el iadh, ad manum, in the hand, that is, the
space or place of the gate: for so is the word taken for a place, v. 18. it was
called Absaloms place: this space is described to be between the two gates,
verse. 24. Iun. that is, between the inward and the outward gate. Osiand. the
one of these gates was in the wall, v. 24. the other was in the antemurall, or
before the wall: Pell. and it was that place where they used to sit in
judgment: Genev. as David came afterward, and sat in the gate to show himself
to the people, c. 19.8 David then stood in the entrance or wide space of the
gate, while the people passed by him.

7. Quest. v. 5. Why David would not have Absalom killed.
David gave charge to the captains to spare Absalom. 1. Because his own
conscience gave him, that he was raised up as an instrument of Gods judgment
upon him for his sin: Pell. 2. He feared least that if Absalom should be cut
off in the midst of his rebellion, he should utterly perish; and therefore he
desired that he might have a time of repentance given him: Osiand. 3. David
herein, in sparing his enemy, and praying for him that persecuted, him was a
type of Christ that prayed for his enemies. Borrh.

8. Quest. v. 6. Of the wood of Ephraim, where the battle was pitched.
1. Some think it was called the wood of Ephraim, though on the other side of
Jordan where the Ephraimites had no inheritance, because it was right over
against the tribe of Ephraim, only divided by the river Jordan: Pel. Bor. 2.
The Hebrews will have it so called, because the Ephraimites used to send their
cattle over Jordan, and feed them in that wood, which was not denied them:
Vat. Genesis 3. But it is more probable, that it was so called because of the
slaughter of the Ephramites there made by Iephte, Iud. 12. and therefore it had
the name of Ephraim though it were situate in the tribe of Manasseh. Iun.

9. Quest. out of v. 8. Of the great slaughter of Absaloms men.
1. They were not only destroyed in battle, but fell in the chase as they
fled: Joseph. 2. And the wood devoured them, while they ran among the trees
and fell upon the stubs: Iun. 3. And tumbling into ditches, and pits, and caves
unknown: Pell. 4. The wild beasts also might help to devour and consume them:
Chapter who are by a metonymie understood by the wood. Borr. 5. And whereas twenty
thousand fell by the sword, ver. 7. and more were consumed by the wood then by
the sword, the whole number in all exceeded 40. thousand. Osiand.

10. Quest. Of Absaloms hanging by the hair in the oak. v. 9.
1. Wherein Absalom delighted, and was most proud of, therein is he punished:
he is hanged by the hair, which he nourished and kept long of purpose to
glory in it, c. 14.16. Gods justice herein appears, that punishes a man
wherein he sins: Osiand. 2. Every creature is ready to take revenge of the
wicked: the oak taking hold above, and the mule going away under him, do both
conspire to punish his wickedness: the oak had boughs winding and wrapping
one within an other, like unto a bramble or bush: he was caught by the hair in
the oak, as Abraham's ram by the horns in the bush, Genesis 22.13. where the
same word seboch is used, with a little change in the prints. 3. Absalom hanged
aloft between heaven and earth, as accursed of God, as that kind of death was
accursed by the law of God: the like shameful death came Achitophel to, for
the like sin of rebellion and disobedience: and Judas afterward, of whom
Achitophel was a type, that after he had betrayed Christ, hung himself. Borrh.

11. Quest. Out of v. 11. Of the reward promised by Ioab to him that brought
tidings of Abshaloms hanging by the hair.
1. The reward promised by Ioab to the soldier, was not 50. shekels, as
Josephus: but ten shekels, and a soldiers girdle, which was a sign of
strength and valor, and an ornament, and ensign of honor: Osiand. 2. The
shekel here is to be valued at the rate of the common and usual shekel, which
was but half so much as the shekel of the Sanctuary, which waighed 20.
gerahs, Exodus 30.13. the gerah waighed 16. barry corns, the common shekel then
waighed 10. gerahs, that is, an 160. barley corns, which makes two drachmaes,
and somewhat more, that is, a quarter of an ounce, the fourth part of a doller,
containing an ounce of silver, about 14. pence sterling. Osiander then is
deceived, that here judges the shekel to be in value and weight equal to the
doller. 3. Josephus also is here in an error, that so reports this story,
as though Ioab should have offered the soldier these shekels to go, and thrust
Absalom through; whereas he only says, it was in me, or with me, that is, in
my power to have rewarded thee.

12. Quest. v. 13. Of the soldiers answer to Ioab.
1. Some read, If I had committed a trespass against his soul: because the
affix has the letter of the pronoune, which signifies his, which is vaf:
Osiand. but it retains the vowel of the affix of the first person, which is
chirik, which is more to be regarded, benopshi: therefore it is rather to be
read, my soul. 2. Which Iunius understands to be ex meipso, of my self,
that is, of mine own head: but rather he signifies, that it should have
been with the danger of his life: Vat. B. 3. The third word sheker, is not
generally to be translated (...), S. if I had done this wickedness or unjust
thing, but it signifies a lie: A.P. or falsitie: C. Iun. both in that he
should have done falsely, in going against the kings commandment: V. as also
in denying the fact afterward, and so telling a lie: Iun. which yet he could
not have hidden, because the king by his wisdom would have searched it out. 4.
And the last words are better read with an interrogation, would thou have
strove against it? that is, have opposed thy self against the kings sentence
in my defense? I.V. then to read them affirmatively, thou would have stood
against me thy self, as it is usually read: for the soldier would not have so
unmannerly charged his general to his face.

13. Quest. Why Ioab takes three darts.
1. The Hebrews think that Ioab did this, because he had thrice dissembled with
David, with the Elders of Israel, and with the 200. whom he had seduced, c.
15.11. 2. But it is more likely, that Ioab did remember how thrice he had
broken his faith, after he had reconciled him to his father. Pel. first, when
he played those pranks in burning Ioabs corn while he dwelt in Jerusalem: and
afterward when he stole away the hearts of the people, and accused his fathers
government, after he was admitted to his presence: and thirdly, when he
rebelled, making his father to believe, that he went to Hebron to pay his vow.
3. Or rather this might be, because Absalom had committed three great sins,
murder against Amnon, rebellion against his father, and incest in lying with
his wives: Osian. 4. Or because Absalom had three kinds of death; he was thrust
through of Ioab, and afterward killed of his men, and lastly overwhelmed with
stones. 5. But these conjectures need not: for he took three darts to make sure
work, that he might thoroughly dispatch him.

14. Quest. Whether Ioab sinned in killing Absalom contra^y to David's charge.
1. Some think that Ioab and the young men sinned in killing Absalom, because
the king had otherwise charged them: Osiand. 2. But I rather incline to their
opinion, which commend in this act the faithfulness, justice, and wisdom of
Ioab, and upon these reasons. 1. Ioab had good experience of Absalom already,
whom he had twice reconciled to his father, and still broke his faith, and
therefore had no hope of his amendment. 2. He had Gods warrant, being now a
chief Iusticiarie in the battle, to put to death a murderer not only of
Amnon, but by whose means twenty thousand of the Lords people were slain,
being now offered of God into his hands: neither needed any witnesses to
convince him, the evidence of the fact showing it self: Pellic. 3. He knowing
that Absalom would be still a dangerous man to the whole state, thinks it
best to take him out of the way, preferring the safety of the whole
commonwealth, before the private affection of the king. 4. And that Ioab herein
offended not appears, both for that David neither expostulated with him after
the battle, neither when he accused Ioab to Solomon for the murder of Abner
and Amasa, made he any mention of the killing of Absalom. Bor.

15. Quest. Out of the 17. v. of Abshaloms manner of death.
1. Absalom beside the smiting through with darts, was also stoned by Gods just
judgment, by whose law, they which were disobedient to their fathers and
mothers were stoned to death: Osiand. 2. This was also a just punishment of
Absaloms pride, that as he had been too much given to ambitious ostentation
while he lived, and to that end had reared up a pillar to be a monument of
his fame unto posterity, now in stead of that pillar, he shrouded under an
heap of stones: Pellic. 3. So was the king of Hai served, there was laid upon
him being dead an heap of stones, Josh. 8.29. and the five Kings whom Joshua
overcame, Josh. 10.27.

16. Quest. Of Absaloms children, v. 18.
1. Some think, that whereas it is said before, c. 14.27. that Absalom had
three sons and a daughter, that all his children were now dead: sic Geneuens.
but it is not necessary to think, that all of them were taken away, but only
his sons, as the words of the text are, for he said, I have no son, etc. 2.
Josephus is of opinion, that his sons were not dead already, but he
provided, if they should chance to die without issue, that by this pillar he
should be remembered: but the text is plain, that they were dead at this time,
as the Chalde well expresses, non est mihi filius superstes, etc. I have no
son left. 3. God therefore had now deprived him of his three sons mentioned
before, c. 14. Iun. he that was so unnatural to his father, was not worthy to
have any children. Pellic.

17. Quest. v. 21. Of the Cushite whom Ioab sent with the news unto David.
1. Some read Cushai, as though he were the same with that Cushai before
mentioned, which was David's friend: Osiand. but there is great difference in
the names: that is Cushai, with pathah, this Cushi, with chirieh, and that
Cushai was yet a follower of Absalom, and was not returned to David. 2. The
most take it for a proper name, that he was called Cushi; Montan. Page with
others. 3. But he was rather a Cushite, that is, an Ethiopian, as the word is
taken, Ierem. 13.23. and in diverse others places: and therefore he is
afterward called the Kings servant, v. 29. for that cursed posterity of Cham,
became servants to Sems seed according ^o Noah's prophecy, Genesis 9. sic Iun.
Pellic. Borrh. some think he might be so called of his color, and yet an
Israelite born, Vat. but the other is more probable.

18. Quest. v. 29. Whether Ahimaaz knew not of Absaloms death.
It is without question, that Ahimaaz was not ignorant of Absaloms death: for
Ioab had yielded that as a reason, v. 20. why he would not send him with the
message to the King, because the kings son was dead. But Ahimaaz of purpose
concealed it for these reasons. 1. Because as before he had brought heavy
news to David, c. 17.20. so now he desires to bring good news. Bor. 2. He
would not all at once tell the king of his death, least he might have bin
oppressed with grief, but leaves him in suspense, that he might by little and
little digest his sons death. 3. Ahimaaz did it also in respect of himself;
for he knew that as the evil tidings is not welcome, so neither is the
messenger thereof accepted; like as the patient does loath the very cup out of
the which he drinks his bitter potion. 4. By this then we are taught these
points of good discretion: first, that we put off the relation of evil news
to others, where we are not urged by necessity: secondly, that when we do
tell hard news, we should do it by degrees: for many upon the sudden report
of heavy things have presently died. Osiand.

19. Quest. v. 33. Why David mourns for Absalom.
1. David's natural affection, which he could not hide, did move him thus to
take on for his son; as also the consideration of Gods just judgment against
him for his sin: Genev. 2. As also David therein saw the accomplishment of
Nathans prophecy against his house for his own sin: which was the cause of
these great calamities: Bor. Pell. 3. He considered that Absalom died in his
sin without repentance, and therefore he mourns not so much for Absaloms
corporal death, as for the peril and danger of the salvation of his soul.
Osiand.

20. Quest. v. 33. Why David wished to die for Absalom.
1. He feared least his son dying in his sin without repentance, died out
of the favor of God: his own death he feared not, being assured that he
should die in Gods favor, and therefore he desired by his corporal death,
that he had redeemed his sons life, that he might have lived to repent him:
Osiand. 2. He wished to die rather then to live to see the misery and
calamity, which he foresawe by Nathans prophecy, was like to fall upon his
family and posterity: Pellic. 3. He was herein a type and figure of Christ,
who offered himself to death for those which persecuted him: Bor. 4. The
Hebrews vainly here imagine, that Absalom by David's tears and prayers was
delivered from hell, and taken into paradise: but no mention is here made of
David's prayers at all: Pellic. which he would not have omitted, if he had
thought that prayers were available for the dead: Osiand. nay he had showed
the contrary, when he left praying for the child, after he knew it was dead.

CHAP. 19.
1. Quest. v. 6. Of Ioabs speech to David.
1. IOab much forgets himself in speaking so boldly and irreuerently to the
king, otherwise then it became him: Iun. 2. And he charge David with some
untruth: for though he loved his enemies, yet did he not hate his friends:
Osian. 3. And he does in effect vpbraid him for his former severity showed to
those that killed his enemies; as in slaying the Amalekite for killing Saul,
and Rechab and Baanah for the death of Ishbosheth: and now thou hate me for
killing Abner before, and Absalom now: Osian. 4. True it is that we are in a
certain degree to love our enemies, to pray for them, and to wish their
amendment: but we are not so to love them, How our enemies are to be loved.
but that the glory of God and safety of his people ought to bear a greater
sway with us; whereunto Ioab has respect, and therefore wisely admonishes the
King, Bor. though somewhat more sharply then became him.

2. Quest. v. 13. Of David's purpose in remoouing Ioab from being captain of
the host.
1. Some think that David had just cause to remove Ioab from his place, both
for that he so unmannerly behaved himself in words toward him, and for that he
had killed Absalom contrary to his commandment: Iun. Osian. but neither of
these was a sufficient cause, seeing Ioab in both these intended David's good,
and the safety of the people. 2. Wherefore the better opinion is, that David
herein showed his humane affection; both because Ioab had before by his valor
deserved that place, 1. Chr. 11.6. and David at once here forgets all the
benefits formerly received by Ioabs service: Bor. and he did this in policy,
as he did before purpose to advance Abner for the same cause, so now he would
prefer Amasa, thinking by this means to win the hearts of the rest. Pell.
Genesis 3. Yet seeing David did many things by the instinct of Gods spirit,
whereof no reason can be yielded, we must not rashly censure his acts. Borrh.

3. Quest. v. 14. Who it was that bowed the hearts of the men of Judah.
1. Some understand it of Zadock and Abiathar, that one of them bowed the
hearts of the people and persuaded them: Vatab. but the word being put in the
singular number, cannot be referred to them being two, and joined together in
this commission. 2. Some understand it of Amasa, that he bowed their hearts:
Pellic. 3. But it is better applied to David, that he by this friendly message
and gentle speech persuaded them: Iun. for otherwise he needed not to have sent
Zadock and Abiathar to all the elders of Judah, v. 11. but to Amasa only.

4. Quest. v. 20. How Shemei came first of all the house of Joseph, being of
Benjamin.
1. Some by the house of Joseph understand the rest also of the tribes of
Israel, who were sometime preserved by Joseph, and therefore he was as the
author and father of them: Osiand. but this is not usual in Scripture, by the
tribe of Joseph to understand all Israel: neither did Shemei prevent all the
tribes, for Judah came before him, v. 15. 2. Some do comprehend Benjamin under
Joseph, because they had both one mother: Pellic. yet were they two distinct
tribes, and one was numbered with the other. 3. Some also think that by Joseph
he means Ephraim, Manasseh, and Benjamin; because they all marched under
Ephraims standerd, Number. 2.18. Vatab. Geneven. but that is not like: for now
they did not march in that order. 4. Wherefore this is the better reading, that
he came before the house of Joseph, not first of the house: that is, though his
tribe of Benjamin was situate further off from Jordan, then the tribes of
Joseph, as the king now came from Mahanaim to Jordan, yet he to express his
duty and joy, came first and before them. Iun.

5. Quest. v. 23. How David performed his oath made to Shemei for his life.
Though David afterward, 1. Kin. 2.8. gave Solomon charge concerning Shemei,
yet he broke not his oath: Reconcil.
for, 1. David only swears concerning himself and his time, that he for his
part would take no revenge on him, but leave him to the judgment of an other:
Iun. Bor. 2. He pardoned his former fault, but conditionally, that he should
take heed he offended not afterward. Pelli. 3. And so indeed Solomon did not
simply put him to death afterward for his sin against his father: but for
that being confined to a place, h^ broke the kings commandment: and so the
king took occasion by this means to do justice upon him. Osiand. 4. David
having himself upon the confession of his fault found mercy and forgiveness
with God, does also imitate the Lord therein, in forgiving Shemei upon his
submission: being therein a type of Christ, who was ready to receive all that
came in humility unto him. Borrh.

6. Quest. v. 25. Whether it be meant of David or Mephibosheth, that he came
to Ierushalem.
1. Some understand it of Mephibosheth, and read thus, when he was come to
Jerusalem, and met the King: and make this to be the meaning, when Mephibosheth
being at Jerusalem had met the King: Geneven. but beside that, this were an
improper speech, to say, when he was come to Jerusalem, if he did not go out of
Jerusalem at all: as yet also David was not come to Jerusalem, as appears by
Barzillais speech, ver. 34. what time have I to live, that I should go up with
the King to Jerusalem. 2. Some other read thus, when he came from Jerusalem:
Osiand. but beside that, in this sense, an other word is here used iatza, to
go out, as c. 20.10. but bo, is to go in, which is the word here used: the
phrase will not bear this sense, for the name of the place without a
preposition, betokens to the place, as v. 34. 3. Therefore it is better
understood of David, that when he, that is, the King was in coming to
Jerusalem, Mephibosheth met him. Iun. Pellic.

7. Quest. v. 29. Why Mephibosheth says, that they were all of Saul's family
men of death, that is, worthy to die.
1. Some refer it unto the cruelty which Saul and his had showed toward
David, in persecuting him and usurping the kingdom: Pellic. But seeing David
did reverence Saul as the Lords anointed while he lived, and would not lay his
hands upon his person, nay he put to death him that vaunted he had killed Saul,
2. Sam. 1. there was no reason, that the posterity of Saul should incur the
sentence of death, for any offense that Saul had committed. 2. Therefore it is
better understood of the attempt which Ishbosheth made, in holding the kingdom
against David. Osiand. 3. And withal Miphibosheth seems to have taken part
with him, and to have been accessarie to that co^spiracie, dwelling at that
time with Machir of Ladebao beyond Jordan, where Ishbosheth remained at
Mahanaim. Iun.

8. Quest. v. 29. Whether David offended in dividing Miphibosheths lands, and
not restoring the whole unto him.
1. The most do accuse David here of oversight, that hearing the truth how
Ziba had falsely accused Miphibosheth, does yet award half of the land to that
unfaithful servant: yet they do extenuate David's fault, partly, because that
David by his Kingly authority might, as he saw cause revoke and suspend that,
which before he had freely granted to Miphibosheth: Osiand. And that David
makes some part of amends, in restoring part, though not all: as also he had
thereto Miphibosheths consent, who was contented at the Kings pleasure to have
parted withal. Pelican. 2. Some go yet further, and say this fact of David's
in not restoring Miphibosheths lands knowing the truth, was much worse, then
his first oversight, in taking them away upon a false suggestion. Genevens. But
that can not be, for David reuoketh the former sentence, and makes
restitution, though in their opinion not fully, and therefore this latter error
could not be worse. 3. The Hebrews are yet more severe, and say, because David
broke his oath made to Jonathan, and divided Miphibosheths land, that afterward
his kingdom was divided in Rehoboams time. ex Pelican. 4. But all this is
surmised upon a false ground: for David does not here make an equal division
of the land as unto two owners: but his meaning is, that Ziba should occupy
the land to halues to Miphibosheths use, as he had appointed at the first, c.
9.10. and therefore David expressly says, I have said, having relation to his
first order, which he had made. And in this sense David is to be understood,
why speak thou any more thy words, or of thy matters: not that he cut him
short, as Borrh. but in a manner he says, I accept of thine excuse, thou
need say no more: Iun. Some think, that David was ouerseene, because he
punished not Ziba being now present. But David that before pardoned Shemei, no
marvel if he let slip this oversight in Ziba.

9. Quest. v. 36. Of these words: Thy servant will go a little way over
Jordan, etc.
1. Some thus understand the words: Thy servant has gone but a little over
Jordan, and will thou for so small a service give me so great a recompense?
Iun. but this is not the meaning: for it is expressed before v. 32. what
service Barzillai dad done to the King in maintaining and cherishing him: and
he could not be ignorant, that the King made him so freindly and frank an
offer in that regard: and beside the word, iaghabor is put in the future tence,
and therefore rather signifies I will go over, then, I have gone over. 2.
Therefore I prefer the usual reading, that he would go a little with the
king to bring him on his way, as before v. 31. it is said he went over Jordan
to conduct him, and then he would crave leave to return. Genevens. Vatablus,
Osiander.

10. Quest. v. 35. Upon these words, Can I hear any more the voice of singing
men, and singing women?
1. It seems that in David's Court, while the King was at dinner, that he had
music played before him, and sung, both with voices, and upon instruments:
Osian. 2. Which although it was not commanded, yet was it tolerable and
permitted: Pellic. and there is no doubt, but that there is a commendable use
of Musical harmony even for recreation and delight: for as it is lawful to
feed other senses, as the taste, not only with the savor of necessary food,
but also with pleasant rellishing for repast, as Isaak longed to have wild
flesh, (which we call venison) to be prepared for his taste: so also we may
please the other senses, as of hearing, Of the abuse^* and likewise lawful use
of music.
so that all things be done in measure and sobriety. 3. Music may be abused,
and that two ways, either to superstition, as in adoring and countenancing
Idolatry, as the King of Babel set forth his abominable Idol, Dan. 3. withal
kind of instruments of Music: or to wantonness, as the Prophet reprooueth
the people, because the harp, viole, timbrel, and pipe were in their feasts,
Isai. 5.12. so also Amos, 6.5. There is also a commendable use of Music,
either to use it to the glory of God; as David brought the Arc to Ierushalem
with the sound and harmony of all kind of instruments, 2. Sam. 6.5. or else
for honest recreation either in feasts or otherwise, as Solomon yet remaining
in his wisdom had men-singers and women-singers, Eccles. 2.8. 4. But this
liberty which David had is not to be urged too far, to patronize the
licentious use of Music: they which herein allege the example of David, let
them also imitate him in his patience and meekness in adversity and
affliction. Pellic.

11. Quest. v. 40. Of the half part of the people of Israel, which were with
David.
1. Some read, not half the people of Israel, but, a part of the people of
Israel, Iun. but the word chatzi is usually taken for the half part, as c.
18.2. though half of us were slain: and in many other places. 2. Therefore the
usual reading is rather to be followed, the half of the people: Chald. as the
Sep. also read, (...): so also the rest of the Interpreters. 3. Yet the precise
half is not to be understood, but only a part: that whereas Judah wholly was
with King David, yet Israel but in part, in regard either of Judah, or the rest
of Israel, which were not yet come: and this part of Israel, were they which
held with David, and fell not from him, and such as were now come and
reconciled to him, as the thousand of Benjamin that came with Shemei. Iun.
Vatab.

12. Quest. v. 44. Of the contention between the men of Israel and of Judah
about David.
1. Whereas they which before had left and forsaken the King, do now strive,
which should be the most forward in bringing him again: beside the
inconstancy and leuitie of the people here to be noted, Gods providence is to
be considered in swaying the affections of the people toward David, which were
of late estraunged from him with so great hostility, that David might
acknowledge that his state and kingdom depended only upon God. Pelican. 2.
The men of Judah allege two reasons in their defense, both because they were
nearer in kindred to David, then the Israelites, and for that their affection
was more sincere: for they respected not their own profit, neither were hired
or waged to do that they did, but came of a dutiful mind, v. 42. the men of
Israel stood partly upon their number, they were ten for one, partly upon the
prioritie of their counsel, they first made the motion to bring back the
king, v. 11. 3. The men of Judah were sharper in words, then the men of Israel,
both being confident upon their cause, (as having the better part) and the
kings favor, Osiand. as being emboldened with the guard of David's soldiers,
called his men, v. 41. Iun. But this their insolent speech toward Israel, and
the neglecting of them, bread a greater inconvenience afterward, and gave
occasion of falling away again to the Israelites, as the next Chapter shows.

CHAP. 20.
1. Quest. v. 1. What moved Shebah to entise Israel to leave David.
1. THe former contention between Israel and Judah ministered occasion thereof,
because they of Judah challenged the king to be peculiar to themselves, and
therefore Shebah says, as from their mouth, and in their words, we have no
part in David, as they would bear us in hand. Vatab. 2. The old and inveterate
hatred and envy between Saul's house, of the which it seems this Shebah was,
and Judah, did stir him up to this mischief. Borrh. 3. As also his own
ambition, thinking, if they could shake off David's yoke, to be King himself in
his stead: Osiander. 4. As also the people grew weary of the Kingly
government, and sought for liberty. Pelican.

2. Quest. v. 3. Of the shutting up of David's Concubines.
1. David inflicteth a treble punishment upon them, for yielding to the
incestuous lust of Abshalom; for they should rather have died, then
condescended unto him: first they are sequestered and shut up from all company,
that none should come at them least being seen abroad, the memory of that
unclean fact should have been thereby revived. Borrh. Secondly, David does
forbear their company, because it was not fit, after they were defiled by his
son, that they should have access to him. Of (...).
Osiand. Thirdly, they are enjoined this penance of widowhood during life, that
they might lament and repent them of their sin. Pelican.

2. Some think, that because it is added, in widowhood for life, that they
continued in widows estate only during the life of David: Vatabl. and so he
distinguishes, between viduitatem vitae, widowhood of life, and viduitatem
mortis, widowhood of death, that is, after the husbands death: so also the
Chalde, they were called widows, viri superstitis, of the husband yet
suruiuing. But it is evident rather by the text, that they were thus enclosed
and sequestered unto the day of their death. Iun.

3. Yet David nourished and kept them with all things necessary, because he
considered, that they were forced thereunto: Osiand. Joseph. But yet David
should as well or rather have punished those, which were either causes, or
co^senters to this disgrace: of which number. Amasa was one, who being then a
chief man about Abshalom, was contented he should follow Achitophels wicked
counsel, and was himself a beholder of it. Pelican.

3. Quest. Issuing out of the former, Whether perpetual widdowhood or
virginity may be inflicted, or enjoined.
1. That a man is not bound to render the matrimonial debt, where the faith of
wedlock is broken, by any adulterous or incestuous act, it is clear by the
example of Jacob, who is thought not to have companied with Billah after Ruben
had committed incest with her: for Jacob says his bed was defiled, Genesis 49.3.
Borrh. So also David upon just cause refrained from the company of those
concubines. 2. But it is an harder question, whether the husband or the
Magistrate may enjoin unto the offending wife perpetual widdowhood after the
husbands death: which I rather incline to think ought not to be for these
reasons. 1. Because the husband has no longer power over his wife, then while
he lives; as the Apostle shows, Romans 7.2. If the man be dead, she is
delivered from the power of the man.

2. Again, this were to deny unto the weak party the remedy against
fornication, which is marriage, and so they might be occasioned to live in
sin still: and therefore the Apostle allows every woman to have her
husband, 1. Cor. 7. c. 3. It is against nature to inhibite the procreation of
children, in restraining women from marriage apt for procreation: these two
latter reasons are urged by the law of Justinian, made on the behalf of
widows, not to be enjoined widdowhood: Cod lib. 6. tit. 42. leg. ^.
cum m^lieres ad hoc natura progenuerit, vt partus ederent, and maxima eis
cupiditas in hoc constituta est: seeing nature to this end has bred women to
bring forth children, and there is in them a great desire thereunto.

3. Herein the Civil law seems to be more equal, then the Canons, which
decree thus: Adultera non nubat, etiamsi mortuus fuerit vir eius, etc. the
adulteress shall not marry no not when her husband is dead, but do penance
all the days of her life: Cause. 32. qu. 7. c. 22. likewise, if a man had lien
with his wives sister, they did both permanere sine spe coniugij, continue
without hope of marriage: Ibid. c. 23. so was it also decreed in the Triburian
counsel, that if one lay with his mother in law, neuter ad coniugium peruenire
potest: neither of them can come to marriage: Ibid. c. 29. But the Apostle
enjoined no such thing to the incestuous young man, that had taken his fathers
wife, 1. Cor. 5.1. but only took a course that he should be brought to
repentance. Likewise the imperial constitution ordained, that, if a man gave a
legacy to his wife, upon condition she should not marry, that she would enjoy
the gift, although she did marry: and in the same imperial constitution, the
Julian law is repealed, that gave the widow liberty to marry again, taking
an oath, that she did it for procreation sake: the law says, tale iuramentu^
conquiescat, and lex Iulia cedat, etc. such an oath shall cease, and the Julian
law give place: and liberty is there given, for the widow without taking such
oath, to betake her to second marriage.

4. But the example of Iepthah is urged, that according to the opinion of the
most and best Interpreters, did consecrate his daughter to perpetual
virginity: to the which it is answered, first that Iepthah in so doing showed
himself ignorant of the law, which allows the redemption both of male and
female for money, Leuit. 27.4. and therefore Iepthah saying he could not go
back, declares his ignorance of the law in that point: secondly, Iepthahs
daughter herein consented to her father, to become a votarie and perpetual
virgin unto God, so that it was voluntary in her, and not compulsiue.

5. And touching this example of David, in sequestring his concubines during
their life: these considerations are to be weighed. 1. That men had greater
power then over their wives then now: for Moses, as our Savior says, for the
hardness of heart allowed them to make a bill of diuorcement. 2. There is a
difference between a wife and a concubine: that may be enjoined a concubine,
which is not to be imposed upon a wife: the one being as free, the other
bound. 3. This was a particular and special case concerning the King: these
concubines offended two ways, both in committing incest, and in violating the
Majesty of the King: for both which they were worthy of death: wherein though
David showed them clemency, yet it was fit that otherwise an example should be
made of them. 4. The women themselves were ashamed to be seen abroad, but it
seems were contented to lead a private life, and so to be sequestered from the
world during their life.

4. Quest. v. 6. Whom David means (speaking to Abishai) by thy Lords servants.
1. Some think that David calls Amasa, Abishai his Lord, because he was
assigned now to be the Captain of the host, as Vriah calls Ioab his Lord, c.
11.11. Iun. But, although David had purposed to prefer Amasa to Ioabs place,
yet now seeing Amasa to be slack, and so suspecting his fidelity, David had
no reason to give him such honor: neither was Ioab yet actually displaced, for
the soldiers yet are called Ioabs men, v. 7. 2. Rather David understands
Ioab the Captain of the host: Genev. but that is not so like, for he was
Abishai his brother: and at that time Abishai had the charge of the army, and
therefore in that behalf Ioab can not be said to be his Lord. 3. Therefore
David rather means himself, that Abishai should take his servants, Osiand.
which are before, c. 19.41. called David's men.

5. Quest. v. 8. How Ioab comes to be mentioned, that went not out with the
host.
1. Josephus is deceived, who says that David spoke unto Ioab, when he saw
that Amasa came not: for it is evident by the text, v. 6. that David spoke to
Abishai, because he had taken a displeasure against Ioab, and purposed to
remove him. 2. Therefore it is like, that Ioab, though David bid him not, did
voluntarily go with his brother to assist him, partly for love unto his people
and to the King, whom he saw to be in present danger by this rebellion of
Shebah, Pelican. partly, that he might insinuate himself by his diligence
into the Kings favor, to retain his place still. Osiander.

6. Quest. v. 8. Why Ioabs sword was loose in the sheath.
1. Josephus thinks that Ioabs sword being loose in the scabberd fell to the
ground, and he took it up, as thinking nothing, and so smote Amasa: but if it
had been so, Amasa seeing him take up his sword, might have doubted somewhat,
whereas now he took no heed to the sword, v. 10. 2. Some read, that this was
the use at other times, that as Ioab went, his sword fell out, Genevens. but
that is not like: for then it would have been a great let unto Ioab in his
marching. 3. Therefore it seems by the text, that Ioab at this time only did
so hang his sword, that when he would it might of it self fall out, that he
might draw it forth readily and with ease, and without noise. Iun. Vatab.
Osiand.

7. Quest. v. 10. Of the murder of Amasa.
1. Though this judgment of God was just upon Amasa, because he had joined
with Absh^lom rebelliously against his father: yet Ioab therein committed a
most heinous sin. Pelican. 2. These three circumstances exaggerate Ioabs
sin: first, the time considered, now they were in pursuit of the common
enemy, but between them there was freindship and peace: secondly, in regard of
their persons: Amasa and Ioab were sisters sons, and Amasa had been sent
forth about the kings affairs: Borr. thirdly, in respect of Ioabs affection:
it was his ambition, that moved him before to kill Abner, and now Amasa after
the same treacherous manner, who, he feared, were like to thrust him out of
office. Osiand.

8. Quest. v. 11. Of the meaning of these words, Whosoever is well affected
toward Ioab, etc. let him go after Ioab.
1. Some understand these words of Amasa, and make this to be the sense, behold
him, that would be unto David for Ioab: Lat. that is, which sought to displace
Ioab, and to be preferred before him. Pelican. But the words will not bear
this sense: for the text is, he which is well affected, or well pleased in
Ioab: chaphetz: which could not be said of Amasa, that hated Ioab: again, the
other word is, after, not for Ioab: acharee. 2. Some make this young man, that
stood by Amasa, to insult over him, and to wish that whosoever sought to
undermine Ioab, and put him beside his office should be served as Amasa was:
Osiand. neither can this sense be admitted for the former reasons. 3. Therefore
the true meaning is: that this young man being appointed by Ioab, as it is
like, to stand by Amasa, Genevens. by this reason persuaded the people, to go
after Ioab, as they favored him, and wished well to David, and not to stand
gazing there; Vatab. Iun. And therefore when he saw the people to stand still
for all this, he removed Amasa out of the way, as it follows in the next
verse.

9. Quest. v. 14. Of the City Abel and Bethmaacah.
1. Some take these to be two cities, but yet near together, Borrh. Genevens.
2. Some take Bethmaacah to be the name of the country or region where Abel was
situate, Osiand. 3. But they seem rather both to be names of one city, as may
appear by these reasons. 1. In the next verse it is called Abel Bethmaacah,
without any thing coming between. 2. It is named Abelmaim, 1. Chron. ^6.4.
which somewhat resembles this name Abelmaacah. 3. This was a town of
Manasseh, and Maacah was the wife of Machir of Manasseh, 1. Chron. 7.16. so it
seems, that it was called after her name, for distinction sake from other
cities hight also Abel: Iun. 4. Josephus is of ^he same opinion, who calls it
by one name, Abelmachra.

10. Quest. v. 14. Of the meaning of these words, and all Beerim.
1. Some take Beerim to be a region in the upper or higher Galile, where Abel
was situate. Borrh. 2. Some take it to be the name of certain places which
Shebah went thorough, Vatab. Chald. Genevens. 3. Some think, that though it be
last named, yet Shebah went first thorough these places in Benjamin before he
came to Abel. 3. But he means rather the inhabitants of the city Berath,
which was in Benjamin, Josh. 18.25. Iun. and this sense is confirmed by the
next words following, who gathered together and followed him: that is, the
Bercans, being of his tribe, and it may be of the same city, did take part
with him.

11. Quest. v. 15. Of these words, he cast up a bank.
1. Iunius reads in the clean contrary sense: strauit aggerem, he laid
flat the bank: the word is shaphach, which signifies to pour out, or vulad:
and so when the ground was made plain, they came to batter the wall. 2. But I
prefer the common reading: effuderunt aggerem, and of the Chald. acervarunt
aggerem, they ^ast up, or heaped up a bank: so A.P.V.C. and my reasons are
these. 1. Because of the words following; it, 1. the city stood entrenched, or
with a trench or rampire: which was the rampire or bank, which they had raised
against it. 2. The same phrase which the Septuagint here use, (...), they cast
up a trench, is taken in the same sense, Luke 19.43. (...), they shall cast up
a trench against thee. 3. Because this was the manner of besieging cities, to
cast up mounts against them: and from their mounts to cast engines with ropes,
whereof mention is made, c. 17.13. to shake the walls: which course it is like
Ioab took here; because they began to shake and pull down the wall, as the
end of the verse shows.

12. Quest. v. 15. Of the meaning of these words, it stood with a rampire.
1. Some do read, in the plural number, they stood upon the rampire, and
understand it of the people of the city, that they stood upon the bulwork or
rampire to defend it: Page Geneuens. But it seems by the treaty of the
women, that the citizens did not use any force against Ioab, but expected that
conditions of peace should have bin first propounded them, and the rampire or
bulworke being without the wall: for so the word signifies praemunitionem, a
premunition or bulwork before: how could the people leave the wall to keep the
bulwork? for i^ is like (and so thinke^h Josephus) that the city gates were
shut against Ioab.

2. Some understand it of Ioabs men, that they stood in the trench, and came
near to assail the wall: Osiand. But the word is both in the singular number,
and of the feminine gender, and so can not agree to the men or people.

3. Some apply it to the woman, that she stood upon the rampire or wall, and
from thence spoke to Ioab: Vatab. but it is not like that the woman stood
there, before Ioabs men began to batter the wall, as the next words show they
did.

4. Therefore, it is most fitly referred to the city, not that it did stand
alone with a wall, without a rampire, as Iun. for the word eheel signifies not
a wall, but the rampire or bulworke before the wall: as Isai. 26.1. Lament.
2.8. But the city stood now entrenched, and environed with this trench or
rampire: as the Septuag. (...): and the Latin gives this sense well, obsessa
est vrbs, the City began thus to be assaulted.

13. Quest. v. 18. Of these words, They spoke in the beginning, saying, ask of
Abel.
1. Some thus expound it: in this city of Abel have been in times past
excellent men for wisdom, whom they were wont to resort unto for counsel:
will thou then destroi^ such a famous citi^? Osiand. But this is not so fit: it
is better referred to the oblation of peace, first to be made when a city was
besieged according to the law, Deuteronomy. 20.10. and therefore the woman says in
the next verse, I am one of those that are peaceable, that is, which will not
refuse the offer and order of peace.

2. Some read thus, they spoke in old time, saying, ask of Abel, Genevens. It
was said in the old Proverb, Lat. and the Chalde thus expounds, Remember what
is written in the law, that they used of old time, to ask a city, etc. to the
same effect Pellic. Borrh. but seeing there is particular mention made of Abel,
it seems that no such proverb is here insinuated, though reference be had to
the law.

3. Therefore, they which thus spoke in the beginning (as the word signifies,
and as the Septuag. read) rather then of old, were the Citizens of Abel, that
thus communed and consulted among themselves, that Ioab would first offer unto
the city peace, to see if it would be accepted. Iun.

14. Quest. v. 23. Of Ioabs restitution to his office.
1. It is neither like, that Ioab was absolutely restored unto his place, which
David had promised to Amasa, because of his valiant exploits, Pelican. for
David did altogether mislike him for those two bloody murders of Abner and
Amasa. 2. Neither yet as Iun. did he improbe recuperare, wickedly recover his
place of government against David's mind altogether: for David could not spare
him. 3. But David was content he should retain his place, because his service
was so necessary: not clearing him of his due deserved punishment, but only
deferred it. Osiand.

CHAP. 21.
1. Quest. v. 1. Of the time when this famine was sent upon the land.
1. THe general opinion is, that this famine followed immediately after those
civil wars ended with Absalom and Sheba: bella fame excipiuntur, the wars
ended with famine: Borrh. so also Pelican, with others: but that this cannot
be, is evident by that place. c. 15.7. where Absaloms rebellion falls out
toward the end of the fortieth year: which must be understood of the reign of
David, as has been showed in that place: for David reigned but 40. years in
all: but by this account, if the three years famine followed after Absaloms
rebellion, David must have reigned 43. years and above. 2. This is the only
doubt, how all these things set down in this book from c. 15. to c. 21. could
fall out in so short a time, in the end of the fortieth year of David's
reign: But this may easily be answered: for Absaloms rebellion continued not
long, and immediately upon that followed the rebellion of Shebah: so that all
these things might very well fall out in the compass of not many months. 3.
So then the more probable opinion is, that these stories of the three years
famine, c. 21. and of numbering the people, c. 24. are transposed; as the like
is apparent in the 3. last chapters of the book of the Judges; the order of
time then is not observed, in the setting down of these histories: for the
Scripture rather respects the coherence of the matter and argument, then the
consequence of time: sic fere Iunius.

2. Quest. v. 1. How David sought the face of Jehovah.
1. The Chalde paraphrast by the face, understands the mercies of the Lord,
because mercy and clemency shows it self in the face. 2. Some do read,
that David sought the Lord: Vatab. Geneuens. but to seek the face of the Lord,
is somewhat more then to seek the Lord. 3. Some, he consulted with the oracle
of God: Latin. expressing the sense in part, but not wholly: for beside that he
received answer from the oracle of God, he went to the place of his presence.
4. Josephus thinks that David consulted with God by the Prophets, and by them
received an answer. 5. But it is rather to be understood not of that
extraordinary revelation by Prophets, but of the ordinary means, which was
prescribed to ask counsel by, which was by the high Priest, who gave
judgment by his Vrim; as the Lord himself appoints, Numb. 27.21. Iun.
Osiand.

3. Quest. Wherefore this famine was sent, and of the causes thereof.
1. Although this famine was caused by drought, as is evident, v. 10. that
Rizpah took this as a sign, that the wrath of God was appeased, when the
rain fell: yet David considers an other ouerruling cause, the providence of
God, and therefore he resorteth unto him by prayer: so faithful men do see
further into the cause of Gods judgments, then natural and worldly wise men
commonly do: Borrh. 2. The cause which procured this punishment, was for the
great injustice and cruelty showed upon the Gibeonites, whom Saul oppressed
contrary to the oath made unto them by Joshua, Josh. 9. 3. Beside, herein God
punished the people also for their sin: they for their thrice rebelling
against David their lawful governor, once under Ishbosheth, again under
Absalom, thirdly in conspiring with Shebah, suffer three years famine: Pellic.
and by this means also the Lord takes occasion to cut off the posterity of
Saul, least they might still have practiced against David's house and kingdom,
which the Lord had promised should continue: Borrh. 5. So then by this example
we see that famine is sent as a just punishment of sin: as in Germany for
gluttony, and drunkenness; in Italy for filthy and unclean lust: as also
that sometime for the sin of one wicked man, many temporally are punished.
Osiand.

4. Quest. v. 1. Why, and at what time Saul slew the Gibeonites.
1. Some think that he slew them of malice against the Priests, when they
were put to the sword in Nob; because the Gibeonites were servants to the
Tabarnacle, for the cleaving of wood and drawing of water; but he is said to
do it of zeal, verse. 5. therefore not of malice, and consequently not then,
nor at that time: Iun. 2. Some think, that he did it of zeal to the
Israelites, to convey unto them the inheritance, lands, and possessions of the
Gibeonites, that they might have more commodious dwelling: Vatab. Osiand. but
this had been rather of a covetous mind, then of zeal. 3. Some think that
his zeal was herein, because they had in Ioshuahs time consened and deceived
the Elders of Israel, therefore he would be revenged of them now: Borr. But it
is not like, that after so long a time he would punish them for that error
which Ioshuah and the Elders of Israel then pardoned; when it was first
committed, and fresh in memory. 4. Therefore it is more probable, that when
Saul of zeal did expel sorcerers and witches out of Israel, that under that
pretense, because the Gentiles and Cananites were given to such deuillish
studies, he also sought to root out the Gibeonites, who were a remnant of the
Cananites and Amorites: especially for that they were charged to root out the
Cananites from among them: Iun. 5. By the which we learn, that zeal without
knowledge, and a good intention without warrant from Gods word, is not
acceptable unto God. Borrh.

5. Quest. v. 2. How the Gibeonites are said to be a remnant of the Amorites.
These Gibeonites were properly Hiuites, Josh. 9.7. but here they are called
Amorites. Reconcil.
1. Some think, that by the figure Synechdoche, one part is taken for an
other: Iun. 2. Others think, that all the Cananites were in general called
Amorites: Perer. 3. But it is more likely, that because the Cananites were
mingled together, and the Amorites were the more valiant people, that the rest
had the denomination from the^ as the more principal: as Genesis 15.16. the
wickedness of the Amorites is not yet full: where the rest of the Cananites
are understood by the Amorites, as the more principal part: Mercer. So aso
Ezech. 16.2. the Prophet says, thy kindred is of the land of Canaan, thy father
was an Amorite, thy mother an Hittite: by the which it is evident, that the
several nations of the Cananites were mixed together, and joined in affinity,
and the Amorite as the predominant. And further, it seems that the Amorites
and Hivites did more specially commerce and converse together; as Jacob
speaking of Shechem, says he got it out of the hand of the Amorite, Genesis
48.22. whereas pecularly it did belong to Hemor, who was an Hiuite, Genesis 34.2.
as there the Hiuite is named to be an Amorite, so also in this place.

6. Quest. v. 3. Of the meaning of these words, That ye may bless.
1. The most read in the second person, that ye may bless, C.S.L.P.B.G. but
the word, if it be taken in the preter tense, must needs be of the third
person, barachu, that they may bless: and so Iun. reads, expounding it of
David's consulting with himself: But because it is evident by the answer which
the Gibeonites make immediately, v. 4. that all this which David says
belongs to the question: I subscribe rather to Montanus reading, who turns
in the first future or imparatiue, saying, bless ye. 2. Which blessing is
understood occasionaliter, that by their occasion being contented and
satisfied, God may show himself appeased: Iun. as also, because the prayers
and desires of the afflicted are very auayleable both ways, either by way of
complaint, Exodus 23.17. or by way of blessing, the blessing of him that was
ready to perish came upon me, Job 29.13. Osiand. And in that the Gibeonites
which were Gentiles, here bless and pray for Israel, it is an evident type of
the calling of the Gentiles: Pelican. and that the Lord would be entreated by
the believing Gentiles, to receive the Jews again in the end of the world to
grace and favor. Borrh.

7. Quest. v. 6. How it stands with Gods justice to punish Saul's sonne^ for
their fathers sin.
1. Not only Saul, but Saul's house is said to be bloody, verse. 1. therefore
seeing even Saul's posterity did bear the like bloody mind, as it appeared
in their taking part with Ishbosheth: for the which cause Mephibosheth
confessed they were all worthy to die, c. 19.29. it was just that they, not so
much for their fathers sin, as their own should be punished: as the Lord
threateneth to visit the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, unto the
third and fourth generation, Exodus 34.7. 2. Further, in temporal chasticements
it is not unjust with God to punish the sins of the parents in the children:
both because every man has sufficient matter in himself in respect both of
his original and actual sins for Gods temporal judgments to work upon:
and for that by the example of such corrections upon the posterity of the
wicked other receive admonition, to take heed least by their sin they bring
the curse of God upon them, and their seed: Osiand. 3. And this was beside a
peculiar case in the Gibeonites, that as Saul had wasted their generation, so
hi^ posterity should be consumed and wasted: Osiand. and to this end it was
fit that some should be made an example, that the Gibeonites might live in more
safety and security afterward. Pellic.

8. Quest. v. 6. Of these words, O elect of Jehovah.
1. The most do understand them of Saul: in Gibeah of Saul the chosen of the
Lord, who they say is so called, because he was sometime chosen and elected of
God for their king: Vatab. Osiand. Lat. Genevens. But it seems improperly to
be referred to Saul, for these two reasons: both because the Lord had given
sentence of Saul: that he had taken away his mercy from him, as he would not
take it from Solomon, and that he had put him away before him, c. 7.15. As also
in this place, Saul and his house are charged to be bloody, v. 1. and this
title cannot agree to him, to be chosen of God, and yet he and his posterity
to stand under Gods curse. 2. Therefore it is more pertinently applied to
David, and so is it to be read in the vocative case, O thou elect of God: Iun.
for David was elect of God, both in respect of the kingdom, in his own
person, who was chosen and Saul refused; and in his posterity, with whom the
kingdom is promised to remain for ever: as also in respect of the Messiah, of
whom David was a figure, and in him eternally elected.

9. Quest. v. 8. Of these words, He took the five sons of Michol whom she
bare to Adriel the son of Barzillai, etc.
It is certain, that not Michol, but her sister Merab the elder daughter of
Saul was married to this Adriel, 1. Sam. 18.19. Michol was given to Phaltiel,
1. Sam. 25.44. neither had Michol any child at all to her dying day, 2. Sam.
6.23. Reconci^*
Wherefore to reconcile this place, 1. Some think that Michol is put for her
sister Merab, Geneuens. and that in the Hebrew text Merab should be read for
Michol: Osiand. But this were dangerous to admit an error in the original, and
would give occasion of great boldness for men where they doubt to chop and
change the text. 2. Others therefore do think that Michol brought up these
children as her own (having no children) and therefore they are said to be
hers: so the Chalde, to whom subscribe Pellic. Borrh. But because she is said
to bear them to Adriel, which phrase signifies always in Scripture to bring
forth, not to bring up, this interpretation cannot be admitted. 3. Therefore
the best solution is, that here must be supplied, the word sister, to read it
thus, and the five sons of the sister of Michol: for it it is usual for such
words of agnation, as of sister, brother, son, to be ecclipsed in the curt
Hebrew speech, as v. 19. of this chapter Elhanah is said to have slain Goliath
the Gittite, where the word brother is to be supplied: he slew Lahmi the
brother of Goliath, 1. Chron. 20.1. Iun. so Ierem. 32.7. Hananeel is called
Ieremiahs uncles son, but v. 12. his uncle, where son must be supplied.

10. Quest. v. 9. Of the time when these seven sons of Saul's house were
hanged.
1. It is agreed, that according to the text, that they were put to death in
the beginning of harvest, in the barley harvest, which was the first, Vatab.
which fell out in the month Abib or Nisan: Genev. which was about the time of
the Pasch, when they first put the sicle into the corn, Deuteronomy 16.9. Iun. 2. But
how long their bodies there hanged, is uncertain: there are some that think
their bodies there continued from Monah unto September, which was the usual
month for rain; ex Borrh. But it is not like that their bodies continued so
long unburied, for these two reasons: 1. Because after justice was executed
upon them, the wrath of God was appeased, and therefore the Lord not long after
by sending rain, declared that he was satisfied. 2. Again, it is like, seeing
that this was an extraordinary president, that it had an extraordinary
effect: and that therefore God did extraordinarily send rain, before the
usual time, to testify how well he was pleased with this course of justice
which David had taken. 3. They were then hanged upon an hill, to be a spectacle
to all to take heed how they shed innocent blood: Borrh. And they hung in the
sight of all the laborers and workmen in the field (it being now harvest
time) to show that God would not suffer cruelty and oppression to go
unpunished. Osiand.

11. Quest. v. 10. Why Rizpah took sackecloath.
1. Some think that she put on the sackecloath to show her mourning, and to
entreat the Lord by her supplications and prayers: Pellic. But the phrase,
that she spread it for her upon the rock, shows that she did not use it as
a garment upon her own flesh. 2. Others think that she spread it upon the
corpses of her sons, and so kept the birds and beasts from them: Borrh. but
it is said she spread it upon the rock, not upon the bodies: and it seems by
the words following, until water dropped upon them from heaven, that the
bodies lay in the open air. 3. Therefore it is more like, that she of the
sackecloath spread her a tent in the rock next adjoining, to defend her from
heat, and to testify withal her mourning, and the better night and day to
watch the corpse. Vatab. Osiand.

12. Quest. v. 10. Whether it were not against the law that the bodies of
Rizpahs sons hang so long unburied.
It is written, Deuteronomy. 21.23. that the bodies of those which were hanged should
not tarry there all night, but be buried the same day. 1. Some give this
solution, that this law did only bind the Hebrews, and not the Gibeonites:
Osiand. but that is not like, Reconcil.
for the Proselytes of the Gentiles that were converted to their religion, were
bound to the same laws, Exodus 12.49. 2. Therefore I think rather, that as
this was revealed to David by extraordinary revelation from God; so they had
also special direction, that the bodies should hang till God should show
himself to be well pleased: which may appear by this, that Rispah waited till
the rain came, which she knew by the oracle of God given to David, to be a
sign that God was appeased: sic Pelican. Borrh. Iun.

13. Quest. v. 16. Of Harapha the father of Ishibenob.
1. The most think, and so read, that Harapha was the proper name of the
giant, father unto those four giants here named: Ar. Page Lat. 2. But it
seems rather to be a common name, signifying a giant, as the Chald. and Sept.
sic Iun. Vatab. as Deuteronomy. 2.20. the Zamzummims are called Rephaim Giants. 3.
There was then yet remaining a generation of those giants, and men of great
stature, that were before the flood: as Pliny also writes, that in his time
he saw a man called Gabbara, brought out of Arabia, under the Empire of
Claudius, who was 9. foot and nine inches high: he has also a stranger report
of a man found in Creta, in the opening of a monument by an earthquake, that
was 46. cubits long: ex Borrh. And as some men exceed in stature, so others
have been found as little, as Borrh. in the same place makes mention of a
perfect man, that was but a cubite, that is, half a yard high, that was carried
about in a parrets cage. 4. But let it be further observed, that these giants
for the most part, were found among the uncircumcised nations, that were
enemies to Gods people, both that God might show his power in beating down the
pride of such as vaunted themselves in their own strength, and that his own
people should not have any confidence in flesh and blood. 5. Beside herein
David was a type of Christ, who encountered with the spiritual giants, the
principallities and powers of darkness. Borr.

14. Quest. v. 18. Of the place Ghob, where the Philistims fought.
1. Some do corruptly read Nob, for Ghob: Sept. Vatab. Osiand. but seeing in
the next verse, they do retain the name Ghob, they had no reason to change it
here. 2. Some think, that this place had two names, that it was called both
Ghob, Reconcil.
and Gezer: Pellic. Bor. Genev. and therefore is this battle said to have been
in Gezer, 1. Chr. 20.4. 3. But it is more like, that this place called Ghob,
was near unto Gezer, and therefore, in that place it is said, the battle was
in Gezer. Iun.

15. Qu^st. v. 19. Whether Elhanan killed Goliath.
1. Some think, that this Goliath was an other giant of the same name, that the
giant was whom David killed: Osiand. but it appears 1. Chron. 20.4. that his
name was not Goliath, but Lahmi. 2. Some understand it of David, that he killed
Goliath: so the Chalde paraphrast. and the Latin interpreter seems somewhat
to favor that fancy reading for Elhanan, Adeodatus, that is, one given of
God, that it might be applied to David: but this cannot be so; Reconcil.
for this battle was after the battle wherein Abishai rescued David, and the
other Goliath was slain in Dammim, 1. Sam. 17.1. this in Ghob. 3. Therefore
here must be supplied the word brother, as it is explaned 1. Chron. 20. 4. that
Elhanan killed the brother of Goliath: Iun. see before, v. 8.

16. Quest. v. 22. How these giants are said to have been slain by the hand
of David.
1. Some understand it of David's being present in the battle, and so that
which was done by his servants is said to be done by him: as the exploit of the
soldiers is ascribed to the captain: Osiand. But this interpretation cannot
stand, because before this, ver. 17. in a battle with the Philistims, when
David was in danger, it was agreed, that he should go no more to battle. 2.
Therefore all these giants must be here comprehended, that are here named, and
so also Goliath, though not now slain, yet here named, who was indeed slain by
the hand of David.

CHAP. 22.
1. Quest. v. 1. Of the song of David in general.
1. THis Psalm which David here sings unto God after all his great
deliuera^ces, is inserted also into the book of the Psalms, and is in number
the eighteenth, saving that this difference there is, th^se words are prefixed
in the 18. Psalm: I will love thee dearly, O Lord my strength, v. 1. which
are omitted here, Osiand. 2. And as David was a type of Christ, so many things
in this Psalm are to be understood of Christ: for here he prophesies of the
passion, resurrection, ascension of Christ, of the reiection of the Jews, and
the calling of the Gentiles: as the Apostle, Romans 15.9. alleges the 49.
verse. of this Psalm, I will praise thee among the nations, etc. to prove the
vocation of the Gentiles: Osiand. 3. But there may be a double error committed
in the interpretation of this Psalm: if either all be historically applied to
David, or all mystically understood of Christ: therefore what is historically
set down, must be historically applied to David, and what is figuratively
uttered, must be also figuratively expounded of the Messiah. Borrh.

2. Quest. v. 1. Of these words, and out of the hand of Saul.
1. Some read thus, out of the hands of mine enemies, as out of the hand of
Saul: Iun. But seeing he makes mention of all his enemies, out of the hand of
all mine enemies: Saul cannot be brought in as an ^^stance, for he was not all
his enemies. 2. Therefore the usual reading is better, and out of the hand of
Saul: who is specially named, because he was his most special adversary: both
because that persecution was of all other the most dangerous: Borrh. It
continued longest: Pelican. yea and Saul's posterity also afterward ceased not
to oppugn David: Osiand. So the Scripture uses of special persons and
matters to make special and particular mention: as 1. King. 11.1. Solomon loved
many strange women, and the daughter of Pharaoh: he more specially loved her.
Borrh.

3. Quest. v. 2. How David calls Jehovah his rock.
1. As a rock is both a sure defense from outward assaults, as being a place
hard to come unto: Pelican. as also it is a firm foundation to build upon:
Borrh. so in both these respects, God is David's and every faithful man's rock,
both in preservation from dangers and temptations, and in giving perseverance
and strength to continue. 2. And this has a special reference to Christ, who
is the rock and foundation of his Church, upon whom we are builded by faith:
Borrh. 3. Christ is so this rock, as he is only this rock, as v. 32. who is
the rock beside our God? then is it bl^sphemie to make Peter (or any other
Apostle) the rock of the Church, as the Romanists do.

4. Quest. v. 6. Of the sorrows of the grave or hell, which David as a type of
Christ suffered.
1. Some read, the bands or ropes, for chebel signifies both: Ar. Sep. Lat.
but in the plural number, cheblee, rather signifies sorrows, as of a woman
that travelleth, and cannot bring forth, Hos. 13.12. so also the Chal. and so
it is taken here: Iun. 2. Some here translate sheol, hell, A.L. Osiand. Pellic.
so also the Septuag. (...), the roapes or bands of hell: and they refer it
first to David, credebam me ob peccata mea inferno proximum: I thought sometime
that in respect of my sins I was near to hell: Pellic. Secondly, to Christ,
as prefigured in David, vt is peccatum and maledictum factus propter nos
inferni dolores and cruciatum senserit, declarat haec eius vox, deus, deus,
etc. how he being made sin and a curse for us, did feel the sorrows and
torment of hell, that voice of his declares, my God, my God, why have thou
forsaken me? Pellic. So also Osiander, videbar captus in laqueis inferni, and
quasi in infernum detrudendus, and ihi retin^ndus, eo quod totius orbis scelera
mihi essent imposita, etc. I seemed as taken in the snares of hell, and as like
to be thrust down to hell, and to be held there, because the sins of the
whole world were laid upon me. 3. But though this is a true and honourabl^
confession of the sufferings of Christ, that he suffered even the sorrows of
hell for us, such as could be suffered without sin and indignity to his
person, yet this seems not to be the proper meaning of these words: which
are rather to be read thus, the sorrows of the grave: Iun. Geneuens. as the
next words do show, the snares of death prevented me: so then by the sorrows
of the grave, he means, mortal and deadly danger, that threatened
destruction to him.

5. Quest. v. 7. Out of what Temple David was heard.
1. Some do understand it of the external Tabernacle or Temple, unto the
which they turned them when they prayed, and where God promised visibly to be
present: Osiand. But it seems that David meant not so: for most his time the
Tabernacle and Arc were a sunder: which of them then should he call the Temple
of God? And beside David did know that Gods presence was not tied to the
Tabernacle or Arc: as it may appear by his sending back of the Arc to
Ierushalem when he fled away from Abshalom, chap. 15.25. 2. Some therefore
by this Temple understand Christ, who calls himself the temple, Ioh. 2. in
which temple whosoever prays to God, is heard: Borrh. But David herein is a
type of Christ, who prayed unto his father both before and upon the cross,
that the Lord also heard him out of his temple. And that this may be fitly
applied to Christ, both the words before going do show, that make mention of
his sufferings, ver. 6.3. Therefore the fittest interpretation is by the Temple
to understand, the habitation of Gods glory, the highest heavens: as Solomon
says in his prayer; then hear thou in heaven, the place of thy habitation: 1.
King. 8.30. Pelican.

6. Quest. v. 8. The earth trembled and quaked, etc.
1. Some do metaphorically interpret these words: by the earth, understanding
earthly minded men, that do tremble and shake at Gods iudg^ments, Borr. 2.
Some refer it to the passion of Christ, when the earth quaked, and the Sun
withdrew his light: Osiand. But neither of these expositions are so fit: not
the first, because the rest of the description that follweth; as of the
lightning, v. 19. of the Cherubs, v. 11. of the discovering of the channels of
the Sea, v. 16. can not receive that metaphorical sense: nor the second, for
although that some of these fearful signs were seen, in the passion of
Christ, yet no^ the rest. 3. Therefore David's purpose is to set forth Gods
power, by these his fearful works, of the earthquake, thunder, lightning,
tempest, which are evident demonstrations of Gods presence in the world, that
he is always ready to defend his Church: Iun. wherein also he alludeth unto the
like works done formerly; as in Egypt, when the Lord brought his plagues upon
them: in mount Sinai, when the law was given; in the red Sea, where the bottom
was discovered: and when the Lord thundered, and shot his arrows from heaven
upon the enemies of Ioshuah, Josh. 10. Osiand.

7. Quest. v. 21. How David says, the Lord rewarded him according to his
righteousness.
1. If it be understood of David in his own person, he has relation either to
the goodness of his cause, which God had respect unto: Iun. or he speaks
comparatively, that he was innocent in respect of his enemies, which persecuted
him: as David says unto Saul, understand and see, that there is neither evil,
nor wickedness in me, neither have I sinned against thee, 1. Sam. 24.4.
Genevens. Borrh. Pelican. 2. And here is to be considered, that in the
faithful, there is a double righteousness: there is a perfect righteousness,
which is Christ's, imputed unto them by faith, whereby they are justified; and
an imperfect righteousness, which is their obedience, the fruits of their
faith: and hereby they are not justified, but thereby they testify and show
forth their faith. Borrh. 3. And this their righteousness God rewards not of
merit or desert, for it is imperfect, but of favor, accepting their will for
the deed. Borrh. 4. But if we take David to speak here figuratively of Christ:
he was indeed perfectly obedient, and in him was no sin, and his
righteousness was truly meritorious. Osiand.

8. Quest. v. 24. I was also perfect toward him.
1. There is also a double kind of perfection: one absolute and perfect, which
is only in Christ, and imputed by faith unto his members: and by this
perfection only are we here perfect in Gods sight: there is an other
perfection, which is imperfect, which in some measure and degree is
communicated to the members of Christ: and this also is of two sorts; it is
either begun here in this life, or perfected and finished in the next: now
while we here live there are none perfect without their blemishes and
infirmities, which notwithstanding the Lord for Christ his sake imputes not to
his members. Of perfection in this life.
2. Of this double kind of perfection, the Apostle speaks evidently: of the
absolute perfection he says, not that we are already perfect, Philip. 3.12.
and of the other immediately after, v. 15. Let v^ a^ many as are perfect, be
thus minded: S. Paul denies, that he has the one kind of perfection, but he
confesses the other. 3. David therefore here says he is perfect or upright,
in regard of his desire and endeavor, still striving unto perfection:
Pelican. as our Savior says, be perfect as your heavenly father is perfect,
Matthew. 5.

9. Quest. v. 27. Of these words, With the perverse thou will wrestle out, or
show thy self perverse.
1. There is a double kind of perverseness, which is either in doctrine, when
one speaks and reaches perverse things: so is it taken, Act. 20.30. or in
life, when men walk peruersly and frowardly, contrary to the will and
commandment of God. Bor. 2. With such also will the Lord walk accordingly:
the most read, thou will show thy self perverse or froward: A.P.G.V. with
others. But this interpretation seems to be somewhat harsh: 1. Because the
word properly signifies, taken in that sense, ^erversum te facies, thou will
make thy self p^ruerse: which cannot be ascribed unto God. 2. For that,
whereas in the other three clauses, the same word is repeated: with the
merciful thou will show thy self merciful, with the perfect and pure, thou will show thy self perfect and pure: here the word is changed: whereas the
perverse is called ghikkesh, he says not in the same word ^ith gakkesh, he
will show himself perverse, but tithaph of pathal, which signifies to
wrestle. 3. Therefore that sense of the word is more fit, that God will wrestle
with them, always cross and oppose himself against them, as Leu. 26.28. till
he have overcome and vanquished them in their own frowardnes. Iun. 4. But the
Lord indeed deals not peruersly or frowardly, but he so seems unto the
wicked, who accuse the Lord of injustice against them, when he punishes them
according to their deserts: And Gods perverse and cross dealing with them, is
nothing else, but the not being merciful unto them, or delivering them out of
their troubles: Mart. 6. Such crosnes and and perverseness, the wicked imagine
to be in God, when he lays his judgments upon them for their sins, when
they expected good things: as when vnse^sonable weather is sent, as winter
weather in the time of summer and harvest: whereas the perverseness and
frowardnes of men causes such peruersenes, as the wicked take it, to appear
in Gods works. Osiand.

10. Quest. v. 27. Of the difference, between Gods showing of himself pure
with the pure, and froward with the froward.
1. Whereas David says, with the pure thou will show thy self pure, we must
not thus think, that first man is pure, and then the Lord shows himself to
be so toward man: for the beginning of our pureness and goodness is from God:
as our Blessed Savior says to his Disciples, Ioh. 15.16.
Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you: and the Apostle says, 1. Ioh.
4.10.
herein is love, not that we loved him, but that he loved us: therefore first
God makes us pure, and puts his spirit into us. This saying therefore must
be understood, not of our first election and vocation, which follows
thereupon, but of the fruits of our regeneration, and sanctification: that
after our hearts are purified by faith, and so we bring forth the pure and
acceptable works and fruits of faith, the Lord in mercy crowns and
rewards them.

2. Yet the goodness of our works is not the cause, that the Lord shows
himself pure and merciful: but it is the condition, which the Lord requires,
and an order, which God has set, that his children should show their
obedience, before they have their reward.

3. But in perverse works this difference is not observed: for the wicked have
the prioritie, they first show their frowardnes, before they feel Gods
justice: and the reason of the difference is this, because the euilnes and
perverseness of man is from his own corruption, but the beginning of goodness is
from God.

4. Again, these sayings must be so understood, not that God presently
rewards the obedience of his servants, or punishes the perverseness of the
wicked: both the one may a long time be afflicted, and the other prosper in
this world: but the Lord in his due time will perform both the one and the
other, either in this world, or in the next. Mart.

11. Quest. v. 34. How David's feet were made like hindes feet.
1. By this phrase is expressed the nimblenesse and speedine^, which David used
in the pursuit of his enemies: for two things are requisite in war; courage
against the enemy, and expedition. And therefore the Gadites that went to
David, are said to have had the faces of lions, and were like the roes in the
mountains for swiftnes: Mart. 2. And here David remembers how after he
escaped from his enemies, from Saul, and Absalom, as the hind, that is in chase
from the hunters: wherein David was a lively type of our Blessed Savior, who
was often sought for of his enemies, and went away thorough the mids of them
until the time came, that was appointed for him to be delivered up into the
hands of sinners. Borrh. 3. Hereby also is expressed the singular dexterity,
which David had, ad difficilia quaecunque aggredienda, to set upon and attempt
any hard matter. Pelican.

12. Quest. v. 35. How a bow of brass was broken with his arms.
1. The Latin interpreter reads, thou make mine arms as a bow of steel:
some thus, that mine arms are able to bend a bow of steel: Osiand. but the
better reading is, that a bow of brass is broken with mine arms: that is,
that I am able to break the iron bows of mine enemies: Borrh. to overcome
their power, which seemed invincible. Pelican.

2. By this it may be gathered, that if God did teach David's hands to fight,
that he was able to break a bow of steel, that it is lawful to wage just
battle: and that the military discipline is commendable: Mar.

3. But whereas he adds further, v. 36. Thou have given me the shield of
salvation, it shows, that it is not enough for the Lord to endue one with
strength, unless he give good success, protect, and defend him, and give him
the right use of his strength: Mart.

13. Quest. v. 42. Why the Gentiles were not heard, praying unto God.
1. Because their prayer is without faith and repentance, therefore it is not
accepted: Mart. 2. And they pray not of love, as the faithful do, but for
fear of the judgments of God, that lie upon them, Osiand. 3. They inuocated
God, but not purely, being worshippers of Idols: therefore the Lord would not
hear them. As the Romanists do call upon Saints, and so make not God only
their confidence. Mart. 4. And this difference also there is between the
prayers of the faithful and unfaithful: the one as they are persuaded of Gods
power, so they also are assured of his love: but the other, though they
confess Gods power, yet they do not trust unto his mercy. Borrh. So the
prayers of such are not accepted, neither do enter into Gods presence: as the
Lord says, Prove. 1.28. They shall call upon me, but I will not answer: So the
Lord dealt with Saul, refusing to give him any answer at all.

14. Quest. v. 45. How the strangers were in subjection to David.
1. The word here used, cachash, signifies to lie: the nations whom David
subdued, did dissemblingly, and against their wills submit themselves unto him:
they fained most ready and willing obedience, but it was in outward show,
their heart was not toward him: Iun. Pellic. this to be the meaning the next
verse shows: strangers shall shrink or fall away. 2. Some understand it
only of the Jews, who at the first refused the Messiah, but afterward were
obedient unto him. Osiand. 3. Borrhaius refers the first clause to the
dissembling Jews, the second, as soon, as they hear, they shall obey me, to
the believing Gentiles. But, as is before showed, the first sense is the
fittest, as the coherence with the words following shows. 4. Pet. Martyr thus
interprets, they are said to lie unto him, because they promised unto
themselves the victory, but were deceived: but then they had lied unto
themselves, not unto David. 5. The Latin read, resistent mihi, they shall
resist me: but the word here used, does not so signify, as before is touched:
I rest therefore in the first exposition.

15. Quest. v. 51. Whom the Prophet means, by his Anointed: he showed
mercy or loving kindness to his Anointed even to David.
Here David speaks as a type and figure of Christ, to whom this prophetical
speech is most properly applied: as may appear by these reasons. 1. The former
saying, v. 50. I will praise thee among the nations, S. Paul understands of
the calling of the Gentiles, Romans 15.9. for David literally did not this, who
dwelt not among the nations to set forth Gods praise: therefore Christ by his
spirit in his faithful members, sets forth Gods praise in the nations.
Mart. 2. Who is more properly said to be his King, then Jesus Christ, whom the
Lord has made heir of all things, and King of kings? 3. Christ is also called
David in the Prophets, as Ezech. 34.24. I the Lord will be their God, and my
servant David shall be Prince among them: so Ierem. 30.9. They shall serve the
Lord their God, and David their King. Osiand. 4. This loving kindness, which
the Lord shows to David, and to his seed for ever, was not extended to his
carnal succession: for the princely dignity was taken from them, and they
went into captivity: and who are now of David's race, according to the flesh it
is not known: this everlasting seed of David must then be understood of the
true Israelites, which are by faith graft into the Messiah, of whose kingdom,
(as the Prophet says, Isai. 9.) there shall be no end. Borrh.

CHAP. 23.
1. Quest. v. 1. Why these are said to be the last words of David.
1. THe Chalde paraphrast seems so to understand these words, because they
should be fulfilled in the last times: but then many of David's Psalms beside
might be called his last words, which do prophecy of the kingdom of the
Messiah, which should be revealed in the latter age of the world.

2. Some give this sense, they are called the last words, because David does
make this as his last will and Testament, which he changed not, though he
spoke and did many things after: it was a confession of his constant and
vnchaungable faith touching the Messiah, which he held unto the end: Mar.
Osiand. But in this sense many of the first words of David, as that prophecy
of the Messiah Psalm. 2. might be called his last words, because David held that
faith to the end.

3. Diverse do take them to be David's last words in respect of the rest of the
Psalms: this was made last of them all. Vatab. Borrh. Genevens.

4. But I rather think with Iunius, that these were the last solemn words
which David uttered, after he had charged his son Solomon, and commended him
unto God, by that prayer Psalm. 72. herein imitating Iaacob, and Moses, who
being ready to die blessed the 12. Tribes: these words then though here set
down, yet were in order of time last: Iun.

2. Quest. v. 1. Of the four titles, which David here gives himself.
1. David names himself by his father Ishai, as not being ashamed of his
mean parentage, and the obscurity of his family, from the which he was
advanced to the kingdom; Osiand. As also he makes special mention of him,
because he was appointed of God, out of whose stock and family should come
for the present the Kings of Israel, and for the time to come the Blessed
Messiah, as Isai. 11.1. There shall come a rod forth of the stock of Ishai.
Borrh.

2. Secondly, he sets forth his dignity, he was set up on high, that is,
exalted to the regal dignity.

3. His vocation also is expressed, the Anointed of the God of Iaacob: the
Latin reads, cui constitutum est de Christo, etc. to whom it was appointed
concerning Christ: that is, who was assured and confirmed concerning the
Messiah to come of his seed: Osiand. But the words in the original will not
bear this interpretation: for there is only expressed the Messiah, not, of or
concerning the Messiah; he was then the Anointed of God, to the kingdom of
Israel, but therein also a type of the Messiah the very Anointed of God for the
everlasting kingdom.

4. The last title is taken from his prophetical gift of singing: he was most
sweet in the songs of Israel: in making songs for the use of Israel, which they
used to sing in the Tabernacle to the praise of God: Borrh. Iun. and they were
sweet, non solum compositione and modis, not in the manner of making only and
measure, but in their force and efficacy; for as they were effectual to
allaie Saul's malady, so they are most comfortable to a perplexed and troubled
conscience. Mart. Osiand.

3. Quest. v. 2. Who it was, that spoke to David.
1. God the Father, and God the Son, who is v. 3. called the rock of Israel,
spoke unto David by the holy Ghost: here then is an evident demonstration of
the Trinity: the Father, Son, and holy Ghost: which collections although
they are not sufficient to convince the incredulous Jews, yet to us, that are
persuaded of this belief, they are most comfortable. 2. Hence also may be
gathered, that the Father, Son and holy Ghost, are all of one and the same
substance and power, because the same action is ascribed to them all, they are
all said to speak unto David: Mart.

3. And herein the dignity and worthiness of the Psalms is also set forth,
which were not made by any private motion, but proceeded from the spirit of
God, who spoke by the mouth of David: as the Apostle witnesses, which by the
mouth of thy servant David have said, Act. 4.25. Osiand.

4. Quest. v. 3. What the Lord said to David.
1. Some refer these words, bearing rule over men, being just, and ruling in
the fear of God, unto God himself: that the strength of Israel, the just
ruler and governor, God himself thus said unto David, that the Messiah that
Just and righteous King should take flesh of his seed: Osiand. but if this be
understood of God that speaks, then nothing is expressed, that here should be
spoken unto David.

2. Some do refer it to the Messiah, that the Lord here spoke to David and
promised him, that the Messiah should come of him, who should govern the
people uprightly in the fear of God. Chalde, Pelican.

3. But it is better understood of David: not that it was so much a prophecy
or prediction of him by Samuel, that he should govern the people in justice,
Vatablus: for David failed diversely in his government: but it was rather a
commandment, which the Lord gave unto David, that he should both in civil
matters govern the people justly and uprightly, and for religion, in the fear
of God: and as this was required on David's behalf: so the Lord for his part
promises unto David a sure house, as it follows in the next words, v. 4.
Iun. But herein David's government being just but in part, and in some measure,
was a type and figure of the most perfect kingdom of the Messiah: whereof the
Prophet speaks, Psalm. 45.6. the scepter of thy kingdom is a scepter of
righteousness.

5. Quest. v. 4. Of the meaning of these words, as the morning light, etc.
without clouds, etc.
1. Some make this the sense: that here are two similitudes briefly put
together: the one taken from the bright morning Sun shine without clouds, the
other, from the Sunneshine mingled with clouds and rain, which causes the
grass to grow; to the first David's house is compared, not to the second, which
is an imperfect light cast over and obscured with clouds: Vat. Mar. Pellic. And
to make this interpretation more probable, some insert a negative in the second
clause, so shall mine house be, not as the grass, etc. G.B. But seeing there
is no such negative particle in the original, it is not safe so to read.

2. Therefore the better exposition is, that here are two similitudes produced
to the same effect, to set forth the flourishing state of David's house, which
shall be like unto the morning sun without clouds, and the growing grass
after rain. Iun. Borr. Osiand.

6. Quest. v. 5. Of the meaning of these words, so shall not mine house be with
God.
1. Some read affirmatively, so shall mine house be with God: Pelican. and the
words, chilo, they take for imo, but, or verily; as they say they are used,
Genesis 18.15. chilo, verily, thou did laugh. But it is evident that this
particle (lo) is never used in the Hebrew, but negatiuely: and so is it taken
in that place given in instance: which is read thus, not so, but thou did
laugh: and beside there the words are lo, chi, not chi lo, as here.

2. Some reading here negatiuely, expound thus: so shall not mine house be,
that is, not like the grass, which grows speedily, and soon fades, and
withers again: Mar. Genevens. Vata. But it is showed before, that the
similitude taken from the growing grass is used in the latter sense, as Psalm.
72.6. He shall come down like the rain upon the mowne grass.

3. Osiander following the Latin translater, thus interprets, neither is my
house so with God, that he should make with me an everlasting covenant: that
is, I acknowledge that it is not of my worthiness, that God should make such
an everlasting covenant with me, that the Messiah should come of my seed: so
also Emmanuel Sa. But this seems rather to be the reddition to the former
similitude, which otherwise were imperfect.

4. Iunius thus understands it; although my house be not so with God: that
is, yet this promise is not accomplished concerning the prosperity of my
house, by reason of my sin: yet I trust in the Messiah, it shall be
accomplished: in whom all my health and desire is: but in this sense and
interpretation also their wants the reddition to the former similitude.

5. Wherefore I prefer before the rest here Borrhaius interpretation, who in
the former similitude taken from the Sunne-light in a morning not cloudie,
inclusiuely understands the contrary, the Sunlight ouercast with clouds:
and so he gives this sense: mine house shall not be so as the cloudie air
before mentioned, but as the clear and bright Sun shine: so then as the
proposition of the similitude, includes a dissimilitude, so the reddition to
the dissimilitude, includes a reddition to the similitude: mine house shall
not be as the one, but it shall be as the other.

7. Quest. v. 5. Of the meaning of these words, my whole desire is, that he
does not make it grow.
1. Vatablus understands it of the rising and growing of some other to be
King, then of the house of David: his desire is, that God will not cause any
such to grow. But this growing has reference to that which went before,
namely, the growing and increase of David's house: therefore it cannot be
referred to the growing of any such strange plant not mentioned before.

2. The Chalde, whom Borrhaius subscribeth unto, deriueth the sense to that
which follows, v. 6. the wicked shall be as thorns: that David's whole desire
is, that the wicked do not grow: but beside that this was not David's whole
happiness and desire, that the house of the wicked should not flourish, but
rather that his own house might prosper: this should be put out of place,
seeing hitherto David extends the first similitude of the prosperity of his
own house: and then in the next place, he comes to speak of the
unprosperous state of the wicked.

3. The Latin translator, whom Emman. Sa. follows, thus reads: non est
quicquam, quod non germinet ex eo, neither is there any thing which does not
grow of it: that is, of his house: but in this reading, there are two
negatiues, which in the Latin tongue make an affirmative, whereas in the
original there is but one.

4. The most Interpreters do thus interpret, my whole desire is, that it do
not grow, that is, so, like unto grass, which soon does grow and soon
withers: Pelican, Genevens. B. But as is showed before, the growing of the
grass sprou^ing after the rain, is taken in the better part, and thereby the
prosperity of David's house is expressed.

5. Iunius thus opens the words; though for the present mine house do not
grow and increase, as was before by those two similitudes set forth, verse. 4.
because of my sin, yet my whole health or salvation and desire is in the
accomplishment of Gods promise: he then thus reads: my whole salvation and
desire is therein, seeing he does not cause it to grow. But in this sense
David should seem to complain, that he saw not the accomplishment of Gods
promises toward him: where in his former song he celebrated the praise of God,
for showing such mercy and loving kindness toward him, c. 22.51. and for
rewarding him according to his vprightnes, v. 21.

6. Wherefore in the last place, Osiander thus delivers the sense of these
words: my whole desire (will, or longing is) because he does not cause it to
grow: that it, because I see not, that blessed branch yet to grow forth: for
all the Patriarchs and Prophets longed for the days of the Messiah, who is
called, the bud of the Lord, tzamach Jehovah, Isa. 4.2. the which word tzamach,
to grow, is used here: the like phrase propounded negatiuely, showing a
lingering desire, is found, Reu. 6.4. How long Lord will thou not judge, and
avenge our blood, etc.

8. Quest. v. 6. Why the wicked are compared to thorns, that can not be
handled.
An opposition is here made between the house of the righteous, and the
generation of the wicked. 1. They are compared to the fruitful and growing
buds: the other are as thorns: 2. the one shall continue, as the Sun, the
other shall be rooted out: Borrh. 3. The one is handled with hands, and
preserved; the other is intractable, there is no society with the wicked, they
are ordained for the fire: Mart. 4. Non admittunt culturam, they cannot be
dressed and tilled: Osiand. nor by co^rection amended. 5. They are taken away
with iron: sometime cut off by the hand of the magistrate, or by some
extraordinary judgment; and at the last shall be destroyed with everlasting
fire: like as thorns in the same place, where they are pulled up are consumed
and burnt: Mar. 6. Here is special reference made to the obstinate Jews, who
as thorns should be taken away with the weapons of the Romans, and their city
consumed with fire, which came to pass under Titus and Vespasian: Osiand.

9. Quest. v. 8. Of David's worthy men in general.
1. These worthies here named, were most faithful unto David; for they served
him not only in prosperity, after he came unto the kingdom, but before also,
as Abishai and A^ahel, who was slain by Abner, while David yet reigned in
Hebron: Mart. 2. For the number of them they were in all 37. ver. 39. but they
were divided into two ranks: there was one company of 30. whereof Asahel is
named the first, and Asahel the last, but these were of the second sort, the
other seven were more valiant then these, and they were in the first rank of
worthies: Pellic. 3. These worthies that served David shadowed forth the 12.
Apostles, and 72. Disciples, which were the worthy and stout champions, which
did fight the Lords spiritual battles, under the true David and beloved of
God Christ Jesus: Borrh. 4. In that the names and acts of these worthy men are
not suppressed, but committed to memory, it shows that the Lord will not
forget the faithful service and labor of his Saints. 5. As also herein it is
evident, that it never fares better with the commonwealth, then when virtue
is advanced, and men are respected according to their faithful service: but
all things go to decay, where honors and preferments are carried away with
flattery.

10. Quest. Of the first worthy his name, and acts.
1. Some read, he that sat in the seat of wisdom: Adino of Ezui: A.P.V.B.G.
where they make the proper names, Iasheb basheueth tachmam, appellatiue, and
contrariwise the appellatiue Adino Ezus, they make proper: P.A.V.L. and some
following this reading, understand it of David, that sat in the fe^ite of
wisdom, some of Ioab: but these are said to be the mighty men, whom David
had, therefore David was none of them: and Ioab must be reckoned among them
beside, otherwise there will be but 36. in all.

2. Therefore the best reading is this, the two first words, Iasheb bashebeth,
are his proper name, and Tachmam shows his kindred: as he is called Iashobeam
the son of Hachmoni, 1. Chron. 11.11. and Josephus coming somewhat near
these names, says he was called Ishemus the son of Achemaeus.

3. Concerning the other words, Adino, hagetzeni. 1. Some make them a proper
name, B.G.A.P.S. but his proper name is set down before. 2. Some translate
thus, quasi tenerrimus ligni vermiculus, as the tender worm of the wood, L.
for haden, or ghaden, signifies pleasure, and ghetz, wood but there can be no
reason or good sense given of this interpretation. 3. Osiander thinks, that
for ghadino, i^ should be read gharer, lifting up, which word is used, 1.
Chron. 11.11. but it is dangerous to make any innovation, or admit any
corruption in the text. 4. Iuni^a thus burns it, it was a pleasure to him
with his spear to invade eigh^ h^^dred* so ^e a^e riueth g^adino, of the root
ghadan, to take delight, and of the affix which signifies him: but th^n the
word hu, he, which goes before should be superfluous: neither is there any
word which signifies to invade, only the preposition ghal, against, is
expressed in the text, to supply tha^ word. 5. Vatablus therefore better
interprets, (...) hastam suam, he lift up his spear: and so he deriueth
ghadino, of ghadad, which signifies to lif^ up, of the same sense with ghur,
which is used, 1. Chr. 11.^1. to the same purpose, to express his valiant act:
and then the letter nun, with the affix must be added paragogically, as the
syllable ( ni) is in the nex^ word haghetzeni: this sense may seem more
probable, by comparing it with the like story, 1. Chro. 11.11. but the word
haghetzeni of ghetz, which signifies wood, is better translated hastatus, or
lig^eus, armed with wood, that i^, a spear, (as appears by the deriuation)
the^ wood or spear.

11. Quest. v. 8. Of the number slain by this first worthy.
Here it is said he lift up his spear against 800. whom he wounded at once,
but 1. Chron. 11.11. mention is made only of 300. whom he slew at once. 1.
Josephus is deceived, who thinks that at diverse times this Iashabram, whom
he calls Ishem, killed 900. men, for this number agrees not with the text,
neither divided nor put together. 2. D. Kimhi thinks, that he had two
combats at two several times, in the one he slew 800. in the other 300. and
that the one is expressed here, the other in the Chronicles. Reconcil.
3. But these places are thus better reconciled, that if we understand so many
to have been invaded at once, namely 800. which all were wounded, but 300 of
them were slain out right: Iun. Osiand. for the word ^hallall, signifies as
well to wound, as kill. 4. Now if it shall seem strange that one man should
kill so many, we must not call in question the truth of those things, which are
recorded in the sacred stories: and yet this may satisfy us, that nothing is
impossible unto God; he that gave Sampson such strength, that he with the
iawe-bone of an ass killed a thousand, Judge. 15. could enable this captain
with a spear to wound eight hundred men. Mart.

12. Quest. v. 9. Of Eleazar, the second of the first three worthies.
1. This Eleazar is described by his name, parentage, he was the son of Dodo,
and his tribe, he was an Achochite, descended of Achoach, a Beniaminite, 1.
Chron, 8.4. 2. His valor is set forth by the circumstances, when the people
were fled, not were assembled to battle, as the Latin reads: for so is it
expounded, 1. Chron, 11.13 and here, v. 11. then he resisted the whole host of
the Philistims. 3. If the people fled, it is not like they defied the
Philistims, as read L.V.A.P. or vpbraided the^ with their cowardlinesse:
Osiand. the word charaph, signifies also to expose their life to danger, as it
is taken, Judge. 5.18. the meaning is, that they did hazard their lives in this
service. 4. And this Eleazar did fight so valiantly, that his hand did cleave
to his sword, not that cruore gladius ad dextram agglutinaretur, the sword was
glued to his hand with blood, as Josephus: but his hand was rather benumbed, ex
distentione neruorum, by the distention of the nerves or sinews: Iun. Vatab.
5. The place where this was done is not here named, but 1. Chron. 11.13. it is
called Pas. danimim.

13. Quest. v. 11. Of Shammah the third of David's worthies.
1. Josephus calls him Seba, and makes him Eleazars son: but the text
says otherwise, that he was the son of Age. 2. The usual reading is, that
the Philistims were gathered together in a town: A.P.B.G. the word is, caiah,
which is taken for a village or town: but it is evident in the text, that this
exploite was done in a field, where lintels were: it signifies also a troop,
band, or company of men, as Psalm. 68.30. the troop or company of spearemen,
and so is it better taken here: the Philistims were assembled in a troop: Iun.
Vatab. Lat. Josephus says, the place was called, maxilla, a iawe, but then the
word should be lechi, as Judge. 15.15. not lacaiah, where lamed, Reconcil.
is a preposition, and no radical letter. 3. But here a greater doubt is
moved: this act is ascribed to Eleazar who kept the Philistims from a field of
barley, 1. Chr. 11.13. not of lintells, as is said here: Kimhi thinks that
both barley and lintells might be brought together into one field, or it might
be indifferently called a field of barley and lintells, because it did by
course bear both these kinds of grain: Mart. but it seems rather this
exploite being done at the same time by these two worthies (for it is said,
that they stood in the midst of the field, and saved it, 1. Chr. 11.13.) that
the one kept the Philistims from the barley field, the other from that part
which had lintells: which the Philistims would have destroyed. Iun.

14. Quest. v. 13. What three captains they were, which are here mentioned.
1. The common opinion is, that these were three of the thirty after
mentioned, and so the usual reading is, three of the thirty captains:
B.G.A.P.L.V. but it is evident, v. 22. that these three were not of the thirty:
Benaiah was honorable among the thirty, but he attained not to the first
three, these three then were not of the thirty.

2. Wherefore the better reading is, three chief beyond the thirty: Iun. and
these were the same three before spoken of: for it is evident, v. 19.23. that
before mention of Abishai and Benaiah, there were but the first three spoken
of: of this opinion is Josephus, to whom suscribeth Iunius, Pelican.

15. Quest. Of the circumstances of this exploite, the time when it was done.
1. Because it is said, that these came unto David in the time of harvest unto
the cave of Adullam, where David sometime made his abode in the days of Saul,
when he fled from him, 1. Sam. 22.1. Some therefore think that this exploit
was done in the time of David's persecution by Saul: Pelican. Osiand. But this
is not like: for to what end should the host of the Philistims then be gathered
against David, who was pursued of Saul, seeing that they had cause more to
fear Saul then David?

2. Therefore the more probable opinion is, that this fell out under David's
reign, and in the beginning thereof, when he encountered with the Philistims,
whose army pitched in the valley of Rephaim, 2. Sam. 5.17. as it is also
expressed here; Iun. so also Josephus.

16. Quest. Of the place where this exploit was done.
1. Some think that this was done in the cave of Adullam, that there David
longed for this water of Bethlehem: because it is said, that these three came
thither to David: but the text says, that David was then in an hold, ver. 14.
therefore not in the cave: the truth is, that David, when he longed for this
water was at Ierushalem, in a certain hold, not far from the fort of Sion;
Reconcil.
into the which he descended from Sion while he consulted with God, the
Philistims being pitched in the valley of Rephaim, not far from Jerusalem:
as is before showed, 2. Sam. 5.17.18. so Joseph. Iun. and from thence going
against the Philistims, he marched toward Adullam, whether these three
captains came to him, after they had been at Bethlehem, to fetch the water
thence. Iun.

2. But it will be objected, that if David were at Jerusalem, or near the fort
of Sion, he could not have been driven to such extremity, as to want water to
quench his thirst. Ans. Indeed some think, that David longed for this water,
being weary and thirsty: Vatab. Genevens. but that is not like, for David
could not have wanted water, but all the host must be in distress beside,
which extremity David was not driven unto in any battle against the
Philistims, after he was established in the kingdom, that we read of: therefore
it is more like, that David was captus desiderio, etc. desirous of that water,
not of any such necessity; but because it was excellent for the coolness and
wholesomenesse, and preferred before other waters* ibi aquae fortassis non
commodae erant, it is like the waters there were not so commodious: Mar. And if
David had longed for these waters of thirst, it is like he in his great
necessity would not have refused to drink of them.

3. An other doubt is, that it is said, 1. Chron. 11.15. that these three went
down to a rock to David in the cave: how could David be then in the cave, if
he were on the rock. Ans. The preposition is, ghal, which may be as well
interpreted, they went down upon a rock, or by a rock, or to a rock: Iunius
reads, they descended from a rock: or the cave of Adullam, might be in the
hollow of a rock.

4. Further, there seems to be some contradiction in the story: for verse.
13. it is said, the Philistims pitched in the valley of Rephaim, and v. 14.
that the garrison of the Philistims was then in Bethlehem: the places are thus
reconciled, Reconcil
the maine battle or host of the Philistims was encamped in the valley of
Rephaim: but some garrison of them did beset the way and passages toward
Bethlehem. Iun.

17. Quest. v. 16. Of the ventrous exploit of these three in fetching water
with the peril of their lives, and David's refusal of it.
1. It is not expressed in the text, that David bid them to go, and bring him
some of that water: some think, that David did it, to make trial of their
valor; but by David's refusal of the water, it seems, that they went
unbidden: Mar. 2. Wherein appears their singular faithfulness unto David,
that would in so small a matter, to satisfy his desire, adventure their lives:
what would they have done if David's life had been in danger? yet this their
boldness is not to be imitated, for men to offer themselves to danger, where
no urgent necessity is: Pellic.

3. David refuse^h to drink of this water, which was bought with the price of
their blood: teaching Princes not to buy their pleasures with the loss of
their subjects lives: as Ne^o to see the manner of the burning of Troy, set
Rome on fire: Alexander is much celebrated in foreign stories, because he
refused to drink a little water brought unto him, all the army being in
great distress for thirst: but David here does the like, and with a better
heart then Alexander, giving the praise unto God.

4. So he is said to power out this water unto God, not as a sacrifice: for
they were not to offer water unto God, but wine: but by this fact he gives
thanks unto God, who had given such valor unto these men, Joseph. lib. 7.
antiqu. c. 10.
and that the Lord had preserved them from this danger. Joseph.

5. David calls this water their blood, because they had purchased it with
danger of loosing their lives, Controv. How the wine in the Eucharist is
called Christ's blood.
and shedding their blood: and may not the wine in the Eucharist be called the
blood of Christ, which he was not in danger only to shed, but did shed
indeed for our redemption? Mar.

18. Quest. v. 18. Of Abishai his exploits.
1. All Abishai his valiant acts are not here expressed, as how he went down
with David into Saul's camp, and took away his spear and a pot of water, 1.
Sam. 26. and how he rescued David from a giant, c. 21.17. these valiant acts
are not here mentioned, because they were touched before.

2. That valiant act of his which is here recorded, was the slaying of 300. men
at once, against whom he lift up his spear. Josephus is here deceived in the
number, he speaks of 600. slain by Abishai.

3. Two only of this second rank are here mentioned, as thinks P. Mart.
Abishai and Benaiah, the third is here omitted, and likewise 1. Chron. 11.
where also the third man of the first ^ernion, namely Shammah, is omitted. But
as Osiander thinks, and Iunius is of the same opinion, Asahel was the third
man: who was not the chief of three, as Vatablus reads, v. 24. but of the
thirty, and inferior unto the two ternions before mentioned. Some read, he
was one of the thirty, B.G. but the word is rash, head or chief of the
thirty. Iun.

19. Quest. v. 20. Of the valiant exploits of Benaiah.
1. First, he is said to have killed not two lions of Moab, as the Latin
interpreter: for the lion which he slew is spoken of afterward: or two strong
places, as Vatab. but they were two strong men like lions, Iun. Osiand.
Josephus thinks they were two brethren: the word in the original is ariel,
which signifies a lion: but an other word haari is afterward used, where he
speaks of a lion indeed, to show that he before meant by that term
lions, men. Osiand.

2. His second exploit was in slaying a lion, which fact is amplified by two
circumstances: both of the place, he slew him in the mids of a pit, where
the room was straight: and in the time of snow, when lions are most fierce,
by reason they want their pray, the sheep and cattle being then shut up in
time of hard weather: Mart. Iun. This may seem to have been too bold and rash
an enterprise: but it is like that this lion was hurtful to all that country,
and used to pray upon their cattle: and as Josephus writes, the lion being
fallen into a pit, roared, and so might be fearful also to all the
inhabitants thereabout.

3. In the third place he killed an Egyptian of great stature: which fact is
also set forth by these three circumstances: he was of great stature, even five
cubits high, his spear was as a weauers beam, and Benaiah came against him
only with a staff, and took his spear out of his own hand, and killed him
therewith, 1. Chron. 11.23.

4. Some by the lion, whom he slew in the cisterne, understand Ioab, whom
Benaiah slew at the altar, and by the Egyptian, Shemei, whom he also killed:
but the litterall sense in an historical narration is more safely followed.

20. Quest. v. 23. Whether Benaiah were made of David's counsel.
1. The words in the original are, David set him over his audience, which the
Latin intepreteth, auricularium a secreto, to be at his ear, and his
secretary: Osiand. so likewise B. G. read his counselor: whereupon he gives
this note, that among military men there are found many wise and fit for
counsel. But this sense is not probable: for Seraiah is said before to have
been the Kings Scribe or secretary: c. 18.17. 2. Therefore by the men of his
audience, or as Vatablus reads, his obedience, are understood those daily
attendants upon the Kings person, which were ready at the first hearing to
execute the kings commandment, who were as the Kings guard: these were the
Cherethites and Pelithites, over whom Benaiah was set, c. 8.18. Iun. Mart.
Vatabl. It is like also he was of David's counsel, but that is not the meaning
of this place.

21. Quest. Of David's thirty worthies here rehearsed from ver. 24. to the end.
1. These here numbered do vary in their names, from those which are reckoned,
1. Chron. 11. being the same persons, which as it seems had diverse names:
As Shammah the Charodite, is there called Shammath the Hararite: Cheletz the
Paltite, is there named Pelonite: Mebunai the Chushathite of the tribe of
Judah, 1. Chron. 4.4. is there called Sibbecai: Zalman the Arhochite, is there
Hilai: Cheleb is there Cheled: Hiddai not of the river, but of the valley of
Gahash, is there Churai: Abi Alban the Arbathite, there Abiel: Asmaueth the
Baochumite, there the Bachonumite, of Bachmini of Benjamin: Iashen, v. 32.
there Hashem, v. 34. Achiam the son of Sharac, v. 33. there the son of
Sacar, v. 35. Eliphalet the son of Achasbai, v. 34. there Eliphal the son
of Vr, v. 35. Eliam the son of Achitophel, v. 34. there Achiah the Pelonite,
v. 36. Hezrai the Carmelite, v. 35. is there Chezra, v. 37. Paarai the Arbite,
v. 35. is there Naarai the son of Ezboi, v. 37. Igal the son of Nathan of
Zabah, v. 36. is there Iael the brother of Nathan.

2. Beside the difference of names, the number also does vary: for here there
are but thirty in all beside Asahel: there are numbered 47. or thereabout.
Iunius conjecture is, that all those there rehearsed after Vriah, saving Zabad,
v. 41. whom he thinks to come in place of Elika here mentioned, v. 25. (who
might be slain) were the captains that kept the confines and borders of
Israel.

3. But whereas there are two Shammahs here rehearsed among the rest, one
called Shammath the Charadite, v. 25. the other Shammah the Hararite: neither
of these is to be supposed to have been that Shammah the Hararite, which was
one of the three first worthies, mentioned ver. 11. for the first Shammah named
also Shammath, 1. Chron. 11.27. is here called a Charadite of Charad, Judge.
7.1. the other Shammah called an Hararite, v. 33. was the son of Shageh the
Harite, 1. Ch^on. 11.34. but this Shammah one of the first three worthies, was
the son of Age: And if that Sha^mah should be counted among these, the number
of 37. set down, could not be made up.

4. So then as David had more worthies, then these here summed together, as is
evident by comparing this chapter with 1. Chr. 11. So also their valiant acts
are not expressed: some of their exploits were remembered before, as of Elhanan,
Sibbecai, Jonathan, 2. Sam. 21.8.19.21. but it is like not all their acts, nor
of the rest.

22. Quest. Of the countries and places of David's worthies.
Shammah was a Charadite: there was a fountain of that name called Charad,
Iud. 7.1. which was in Iizreel, 1. Sam. 29.1.

v. 27 Mebunnai was a Cushathite, in the tribe of Judah, 1. Chron. 4.4.

Maharai, v. 28. was a Netophathite, of Judah likewise, 1. Chron. 2.54.

v. 30. Benaia was a Pirathonite, of a town in the tribe of Ephraim, Iud.
10.15. he was not Benaiah one of the second three worthies: for he was of
Kabzeel, a town in the tribe of Judah, Josh. 15.21.

v. 30. Hiddai was of the valleys of Gahash an hill in the tribe of Ephraim,
Ios. 14.30.

v. 32. Eliashba was a Shaalbanite, in the tribe of Dan, Josh. 19.42.

v. 33. Shammah is called an Hararite, of some of the mountains of Ephraim.

v. 34. Eliphelet was a Maachothite, in the tribe of Manasseh, Josh. 13.11.

Eliam was of Ghilo, a city in the tribe of Judah, Josh. 15.51.

v. 35. Hesrai a Carmelite, likewise in the tribe of Judah, Josh. 15.55.

And Paharai an Arbite, of Arab in the tribe of Judah, Josh. 15.52.

v. 37. Naharai was a Beerothite of Benjamin, Josh. 18.25.

v. 38. Hira an Ithrite of Iattir a town of Judah, Josh. 15.48.

23. Quest. v. 39. Of the number of David's worthies, how they are counted 37.
Whereas there are but 31. rehearsed with Asahel, beside the other five which
make but 36. the doubt is, how the number of 37. is made up.

1. Josephus thinks that there were in all 38. in which number it seems he
comprehends those three, whose valiant acts were before expressed, c. 21.
Elhanan, Sibbechai, and Jonathan: but the number cannot be made up with them,
because they are here reckoned among the thirty, and so they should be twice
counted.

2. D. Kimhi thinks that there are 36. beside Benaiah, and that he was none
of the two ranks of threes, but is numbered beside them; but the text is
evident, v. 22. that he was accounted among the three worthies of the second
sort, though he were not reckoned among the first.

3. Vatablus his opinion is, that Asahel with the rest make 31. and that there
were 6. worthies beside: but there are only five worthies named beside Asahel:
therefore he must be comprehended to make up the six.

4. Pet. Martyr thinks, that either some one must be supplied of David's
worthies, or that the wanting of one is no great matter in the number. But it
is neither like, that any here not named are numbered: and where a just number
is set down in Scripture, we must not admit the least error or failing in the
sum.

5. Wherefore, this number of 37. is made up with Ioab, who was the captain of
the rest: Kimhi thinks that he is not named among them, because he was the
chief captain: but it is so much the more like that he was not omitted. And
whereas Osiander coniectureth, that he is not set down, because he had
disgraced himself by those two treacherous murders of Abner and Amasa, and
made himself unworthy of any memory, that was no let, why his valiant acts
should not be remembered: for here is mention made of Achitophel, whose son
Eliam, was one of David's worthies. And beside honorable mention is made of
Ioab, v. 18. Abishai is said to be the brother of Ioab. Therefore seeing Ioab
is named in this chapter, and there is no other found to make the number of 37.
and Ioab was also a valiant and worthy man, it is most probable, that he is
included in the number. Iun.

CHAP. 24.
1. Quest. v. 1. Wherefore the wrath of God was kindled again against Israel.
1. RVpertus thinks that the anger of God was kindled against Israel, because
of the injury done to Vriah, who is named immediately before in the last verse
of the former chapter: but it seems by the words of the text, that it was
some general sin of the whole land: for it is said, the wrath of God was
kindled against Israel.

2. Some think that the people had at diverse times before sinned against God,
in the days of Saul, and in joining with Absalom, and last of all in following
of Shebah, c. 20. and that the Lord does now punish them for all: But it
seems it was some new provocation, whereby the wrath of God was again and a
fresh as it were kindled against Israel.

3. There may therefore be two causes assigned specially of this great wrath:
first the Israelites living now in ease and tranquillity, abused it, and
defluebant luxu, and gave themselves to riotous living: Mar. likewise having
obtained so many victories against their enemies, they might grow insolent and
secure: Borrh.

4. Thus as before in the rebellion of Abshalom, there fell of the people 20.
thousand, and they felt three years famine for the sin of Saul's house: so
now the Lord sends upon them the third plague of the pestilence. Pelican.

5. Here also it may be observed, as the prayer of the people helps the
Magistrate, so by their sins, occasionem dederunt principis lapsai, they give
occasion of the Princes fall; and therein as they are partakers of the sin,
so they are of the punishment. Mart.

2. Quest. v. 1. Who it was that moved David to number the people.
1. D. Kimhi and R. Levi Ben Gerson understand, that David's own concupiscence
moved him to number the people: but thereof no mention is made before.

2. Some refer it to some wicked counselor, that moved David to do it:
Vata. but this sense is refused for the same reason.

3. Iunius interprets this place by that 1. Chron. 21.1. that Satan stood up
against Israel, and provoked David: which is certain, that Satan did here
principally tempt David unto evil: but in this place the nominative case is
rather to be sought in the words going before.

4. But seeing the Scripture else where ascribes as much unto God, as Isai.
19.14. The Lord has mingled among them the spirit of errors, and the same
Prophet says, c. 63.17. O Lord, why have thou made us to err from thy ways:
we need not be afraid to speak as the Scripture does, that the Lord stirred up
David, as before c. 16. David says, that the Lord bid Shemei curse him.

5. Wherefore after this manner God is said to have moved David, 1. in
permitting and suffering Satan to put it into David's heart, to number the
people, Osiand. 2. God was causa remouens, the remoouing cause, in not giving
unto David at this time the direction of his spirit. 3. The general virtue and
power of moving is from God, but the euilnes of the ^ction is of our selves.
4. God used this fall and slip of David, and turned it to an other end, thereby
his justice showed it self in punishing his people: Mart. and it was an
occasion of greater good: by this means the place was pointed out where
afterward the Temple was built: Rupertus.

3. Quest. Wherein David sinned in causing the people to be numbered.
1. Josephus thinks, that David offended herein, because he had forgotten in
numbering the people to levy the sum of half a sickle upon every one
according to the law, Exodus 30. but this was not the reason, for the people
were numbered again by Moses, Numb. 1. and yet paid not that half sickle.

2. Some think it simply unlawful to number the people, wherein the Lord
promised to be innumerable as the stars of the sky, and the sand of the Sea:
and therefore it belonged unto God only to number that, which was innumerable:
but this is not so, for they were there numbered by Moses, Exodus 38. Numb. 1.
Numb. 26.

3. Some judge that David purposed to have imposed some task upon the people,
and so he sinned in coveting: as Dion writes of Augustus Caesar, that he
appointed a task over all that pertained to the Roman Empire. But Ioab
brought David the sum of the people, yet no such imposition is mentioned so
much as to have been intended.

4. David's fault was then first in entering into a needelesse action, whereof
there was no cause, but only David's curiosity: he would have it done, that I
may know, says he, the number of the people, v. 2. for the mustring of the
people was used among the Romans, (which custom was first taken up by Seruius
Tullius the King) for these four ends.

1. To know who were fit for war: 2. to know every ones substance, to make
indifferent rates: 3. that the people thereby might acknowledge their
subjection: 4. and that a view might be taken of the peoples faults. But David
here propounded none of these ends.

1. War he had now none in hand. 2. Neither intended he to make any
collection. 3. And they needed not by this means profess their subjection,
seeing he was taken, and acknowledged of all for their King.

4. And they had other magistrates to watch over the peoples faults: the
Levites to instruct them, and the Elders to correct them.

5. So then it is clear that David's heart was lifted up to rejoice in the
number and strength of the people: for the which the Lord was angry with him,
and sent a plague among the people.

6. Rupertus makes this numbering of the people a lively shadow of the carnal
Jews, who trusted to the works of the law, as David here rejoices in the
multitude of men, and in the arm of flesh.

4. Quest. Of Ioabs disswasion to the King not to number the people.
1. He shows that it belonged to God to increase the people, and that it was
David's part thankefully to acknowledge Gods blessing therein: and not as it
were to take upon him Gods office, as though the people by being numbered could
be increased. Borrh. 2. And secretly he insinuates, that David should take
heed, least by this means the numbers of the people might be diminished, which
he desires God to multiply, and increase.

3. He further insinuates that there was no end of numbering the people: for
they all professed already to be David's servants, 1. Chron. 21.3. and
therefore to that end, they needed not to be numbered.

4. Further, he foretells that this would be an occasion of trespass in
Israel; ibid. and that God being thereby offended, would punish his people:
not for that they were numbered without that leauie appointed by Moses, as Mart.
for Moses himself did not always leauie that sum when he numbered the
people, but Ioabs heart gave him, because this proceeded from pride and carnal
confidence, that the Lord would punish it. Genevens.

5. But notwithstanding these reasons alleged by Ioab and the rest of the
Princes and Captains: David's word prevailed, for the Lord had determined upon
this occasion to bring a plague upon Israel. Borrh.

5. Quest. Of Ioabs journey, when he went to take muster.
1. He went first on the East side of the land of Canaan, passing over Jordan,
by Aroer a city of the Gadites, Numb. 32.34. and by the city situate upon the
river of the Gadites, that is Ar, by the river Arnan, Deuteronomy. 2.8.35. then they
went to Gilead, and so to the nether land newly obtained: which was recovered
from the Hagarens in the days of Saul, 1. Chron. 5.10.23. it is so better
translated, then to make a proper name of it, Tachtim Chadshi, A.P.G.B. or the
nether land of Chadshi. L.V. for there is no such place mentioned in all Joshua.

2. Then they turned about on the North side by Daen Iaan called simply Dan,
Josh. 19.47. and by the ground and fields of Zidon: for the city the Cananites
possessed still, as they did likewise Tyrus.

3. So they compassed all the West coast along from Tyrus by the cities of the
Hivites and Cananites.

4. And then turned Southward to Beersheba: Ioab was 4. months and two days
in taking this suruaie, whereas the spies, which Moses sent, Numb. 13. returned
in 40. days: for they stayed not in any place to take the number of the
people, as Ioab here did.

6. Quest. v. 9. Of the number, which Ioab returned unto David, differing from
the number set down 1. Chron. 21.
In the Chronicles, the sum is an 1100. thousand of Israel, and 470. thousand
of Judah: whereas here are given up in account to David, but 800. thousand of
Israel, and of Judah 500. thousand.

1. Some think, there might be some error in the mistaking of figures and
numbers: Pelican: but it is dangerous to admit of the least error in the
original.

2. Some think that Ioab thorough grief gave not up the full number, which
was taken, but as it is here: Genevens. in 1. Chron. 22. But the text says,
that Ioab gave up that number, 1. Chron. 21.5.

3. Osiander thinks that in the account of 800. thousand the principal only
are reckoned: but in the number of an 1100. thousand the whole multitude: but
here the number of Judah is greater, then that in the Chronicles by 30.
thousand: it is not like, that in the one number the principal only should be
counted, in the other the whole company.

4. Some think that Ioab did make the number less then it was, least David
might have been lifted up too much, after he knew the full number of the
people, Emma. Sa. But it is said, 1. Chron. 21.5. that Ioab gave up the greater
number also of Israel, and a less of Judah: therefore this reason can not
serve for both.

5. P. Martyr thinks it may be thus, because Ioab did not number the Levites,
nor the Beniaminites, and it may be also he had not mustred those, which were
in Jerusalem, that the greater number was made up afterward with them: and for
Judah, he thinks that the just sum was 470. thousand, which is made up
here just 500. thousand, because it is not unusual in Scripture, to set down
a round and perfect number for a more ready account, though somewhat be
wanting, as to make up 70. thousand to an 100. thousand. But it is evident in
the Chronicles, that even in that great sum which Ioab gave up to David,
neither the Levites nor Benjamin were counted; the sum then is not made out
of them: and concerning the number of Judah, it were much, that there wanting
30. thousand of an 100. thousand, the scripture should set down an 100.
thousand.

6. Borrhaius says, that whereas there is the odds of 300. thousand between
the number here rehearsed, and the other 1. Chron. 21. that in this smaller
sum the ordinary companies are not reckoned which served by their turns,
24. thousand every month: which being multiplied by 12. according to the
number of the months, makes 288. thousand: then the Captains set over them,
which might have every one under his charge 24. makes 12. thousand: and so the
whole sum of 300. thousand is made up. Concerning Judah, he thinks that the
number here is set down, which was taken before the plague, the less number
afterward: for there might die in the plague 30. thousand.

7. Iunius approoueth the first part of this last solution, touching the
difference between the numbers of the people for Israel: for the ordinary
companies of 24. thousand, which were in a readiness every month by course,
as is described 2. Chron. 27. needed not be numbered: and over them were set
their Captains over thousands, and hundreds, and other officers, which might
make up that sum of 300. thousand.

Concerning Judah, it is not like, that there dying 70. thousand of the
pestilence in all, 30. thousand, almost half that number, should be of Judah.
And beside, the account was given up before the plague.

Therefore Iunius makes up this number of 30. thousand, with the thirty
companies which belonged to the 30. Worthies, each of them being Captain of a
thousand: which might be all of Judah which was the Kings Tribe, and nearest to
Jerusalem: and so the just sum of 500. thousand of Judah will be made up.
This solution is most probable: Josephus is here deceived, who reckons 900.
thousand of Israel, and 400. thousand of Judah: which number disagreeth both
from the sum set down here, and the other, 1. Chro. 21.5.

7. Quest. v. 10. Why and how David's heart smote him.
1. David had continued in this sin above nine months, all the time that
Ioab spent in numbering the people: but now the sin being full and complete,
his heart smites him: Mart. It is the property of Satan, to extenuate sin
in the beginning, but when it is committed, then he does aggrauate it, the more
to terrify the conscience: Osiand. 2. It is like that David had many motions
before this, but now his conscience is troubled indeed: for then the heart is
effectually smitten and prepared to repentance, when it pleases God to move
it: Pelican. 3. Josephus thinks that this remorse was wrought in David,
Prophetis referentibus, diuer^e Prophets telling him he had offended: but it
seems rather to have been wrought by the secret work of Gods spirit: for the
Prophet Gad came to him afterward, when he had acknowledged his sin unto God:
Mart. 4. This smiting of David's heart, and confessing of his sin, seems to
have been in the night: for the Prophet came to David, when he was up in the
morning: for it was David's godly use to call himself to account in the night:
as he says, Psalm. 6.6. he watered his couch with his tears in the night.

8. Quest. v. 13. Of the seven years of famine offered to David's choice.
In the Chronicles, c. 21.12. three years of famine only are spoken of: 1.
Some, to reconcile these places, Reconcil.
think, that a certain number is taken for an uncertain, seven for many:
but if the Prophet Gad, had propounded this offer uncertainly, David could not
have made his choice.

2. Therefore we must here understand, that three years of this famine were
past already, which was sent upon the land for the cruelty of Saul toward the
Gibeonits, c. 21.1. and this present year they had some relaxation from the
famine by seasonable weather, and three years of famine should follow
afterward. Iun.

3. Some others, following the same account for the years past, yet vary for
the years to come, making them to be four, three of famine, and the fourth
and last year also must for the most part be spent in that scarcity till
harvest: Mart. Vatab. but then from the beginning of the 3. years famine,
which were already complete and past, and now they were in the fourth, if
four more followed, there should be eight year in all: the former solution
therefore of Iunius is better.

9. Quest. v. 13. Of the choice of three plagues offered unto David.
1. David having here confessed his sin, received not the like answer now by
the Prophet Gad, as before upon the like confession of his sin: the Prophet
Nathan said unto him, the Lord has put away thy sin: the reason of which
difference is this, that there David slept in his sin, till the Prophet
awaked him: but here David's heart smote him, and he had prayed, that the Lord
would take away his sin, which he was assured of, so that there remained
nothing, but some temporal chasticement, and correction, which the Lord
purposed to send upon Israel, and therefore this only was given in charge to
the Prophet.

2. And whereas he propounds simply these judgments of war, famine, and
pestilence, yet many other calamities must be understood to concur with them:
as in war, burning of the cities, spoiling and laying wast of their grounds,
rau^shing of their women: famine is accompained with unseasonable weather, as
immoderate rain, or drought, and the breeding of caterpillars and other
vermin: and the pestilence is joined with other diseases, as burning feauers,
gripings, and such like.

3. But it will be asked, why the Prophet does not as well give him direction,
what to choose, as to make the offer: the Hebrews think, whereas the last
word of Gods speech is dabhar, what word shall I answer to him that sent me:
that in that word he insinuates, what David should make choice of: for the
same word dabhar, with the changing of some points, signifies the pestilence.
But this observation seems to be somewhat curious. David needed not any
particular direction for this choice, which he as a prudent and religious man,
might easily discern of: specially God so moving him by his spirit. Mart.

10. Quest. v. 14. Of the choice which David made to fall rather into the hands
of God.
1. Although the other two calamities of the sword, and of famine, are sent by
the hand of God, and are governed by him, yet in them he uses other
instruments, as of the sword of men in war, and of other devouring creatures
in famine: he chooses therefore to fall into the hands of God only: for the
pestilence is immediately sent of God, and only is his work.

2. In the pestilence, which God smites with, there is more mercy then when
the sword of man is drawn forth: for then none are spared: Osiand. And we
bear more patiently the Lords rod, then the hand of man: and we are only here
to humble our selves unto God, whereas in war, the enemy which prevails is
also to be sued unto. Mart.

3. So David in this choice, shows his prudencie, charity, piety: prudencie
in choosing the less evil: charity in wishing such a calamity to come,
which was common as well to the Prince as people, for none are exempted from
the pestilence, rather then that which should lie most upon the people: for in
war the weakest, and in famine the poorest, are most afflicted: his piety
appears, because in war the enemy prevailing would take occasion to
blaspheme, and in famine, they should be forced to crave the help of strange
nations to relieve them: David therefore desires only to depend upon God.

11. Quest. How David chooses it as the easier punishment to fall into Gods
hands.
The Apostle says to the Hebrews, c. 10.31. It is a fearful thing to fall
into the hands of the living God: yet David thinks it here better to fall
into the hands of God, then of men. Reconcil.
1. But it must be considered that the Apostle there speaks of such sins,
whereby the Lord is provoked, as of despiting the spirit of grace, and counting
the blood of the Testament an unholy thing: for such to fall into the hands of
God it is a grievous thing: but here David speaks of the temporal
punishments which are inflicted by the Lord, which are more easy and
profitable, then those which are executed by man. Mart. 2. David also speaks
of such chastisements which the Lord imposes with a fatherly affection, and in
love, seeking the amendment of his children. But the Apostle speaks of such
punishments as are inflicted by the Lord, as an angry Judge. Osiand.

12. Quest. v. 15. How long the pestilence continued, and what is understood by
the appointed time.
1. Some think this appointed time was the space of 36. hours, that is half
the three days, the rest the Lord remitted in mercy at the supplication of
David: but no such space is here mentioned, or appointed.

2. The Chalde expounds it of the time of the evening sacrifice, which was a
set and appointed time, as well as the morning: so also Rupertus, Vatab. Emman.
Sa: but seeing the morning was an appointed time, as well as the evening for
sacrifice: this appointed time in this sense may as well be understood of the
next morning, as of the evening.

3. Josephus thinks that this pestilence endured from morning til noone: for
as D. Kimhi says, there are three seasons of the day, which may be called
appointed times, the morning, noone, and euentide: but the text speaks of
some time appointed here.

4. Therefore because there was an other time appointed by the Prophet, but the
term of three days, it is like that the plague so long continued. Iun.
Osiand.

5. But then it will be thus objected: 1. That God should not then be said to
repent him, if nothing had been reuersed of the former sentence, wherein the
Lord does not show himself mutable: but such threatenings are conditional, as
that was against Ninniveh: upon David's repentance the time was shortened: 2.
Neither needed the Angel have been bidden by the Lord to hold his hand, if the
time of three days were expired: Mart. But hereunto it may be answered: 1.
That God is said to repent him, after the phrase of man, not only of that
which he purposed to do, but of that also, which he has done: as Genesis 6.6.
it repented him, that he had made man: as there his justice is signified by
that phrase, because he purposed to destroy man, as if he had not been made:
so here his mercy is insinuated in having compassion upon the people, as if
he had been some for their harms. 2. The Angel is bid ^o stay his hand, it
being now the third day: so that all this day the Angel might have gone on
smiting, if the Lord had not stayed him: the third day was now begun, but not
complete and finished.

13. Quest. v. 15. Of the greatness of the plague which was sent upon Israel.
1. Josephus thus describes the manner of this plague, that it took some
sudd^nly with great pain, and bitter pangs, who so died: some lingered longer
of the disease, and died under the Physicians hands; some were all of a
sudden smitten with blindness, and at once deprived of the sight of their
eyes, and the light of their life: some as they went to bury their dead, fell
down dead themselves. 2. The number which died of this plague within the
compass of these three days, was 40. thousand: so many men died, that David
might be punished in the same thing, wherein he had sinned; he was lifted up
in mind because of the multitude and numbers of the people, and now their
numbers are diminished and empaired. Osiand. 3. It is like that many women and
children might be swept away with the pestilence: but they are numbered to the
plague, who before were numbered for ostentation. And it is not unlike, but that
many good men tasted of this temporal chasticement, as Daniel and Jeremy went
into captivity. Mart.

14. Quest. v. 16. How the Lord is said to repent him of the evil.
1. The Lord is not as man, that he should repent: but he is so said to
repent, because of the effects of those which repent, which is to cease and to
give over, as they do, which do repent them of any thing: and in that sense
the Lord here repents, because he bids the Angel stay his hand. Mart. 2.
Beside, this phrase shows the inclination of God unto mercy, like as a
father is grieved, when he is forced to correct his son, and had rather that
no cause were given him of such chasticement. Osiand. 3. God spared Jerusalem
at David's intercession, because it was the place which he had appointed for his
Sanctuary: Pelican. 4. But God herein alters not, nor changes: but as he
had determined to spare Jerusalem, so likewise he had appointed the means, to
show this mercy at the supplication of David: which though it be set down
after, yet he first at the sight of the Angel humble^ himself, and then the
Lord repented him of the evil.

15. Quest. Of David's humbling himself, and offering to be punished for the
people.
1. It pleased God that the Angel should be seen in a visible shape with a
sword in his hand, that David thereby might be moved and stirred up to humble
himself: and that the Lord thereupon might show mercy. 2. He confesses his
sin, not accusing the Lord as of injustice, that he had smitten the people
undeserved: but their sins he knew not, his own he knew, which had justly
deserved that plague. 3. Herein David shows himself a most loving shepherd
to his people and subjects, that offers himself unto the danger for them:
that he and his house, which were the principal in this action of numbering the
people, might answer the punishment. Chrysostom writes, that the shepherds
in Cappadocia have such a love unto their flock, that sometime for three days
together in following them, Hom. 15. Epist. ad Roman.
they are overwhelmed with the snow, and yet they endure it: and in Lydia how
far they travail with their sheep for a month together in the want
deserts, and parching heat of the Sun: who therein, do teach such as are
shepherds of men, that they should even not spare their own lives for their
common good. 4. Diverse among the Heathen; as Godru^, the Curij, Decij, did
adventure and gave their lives for their country; but they did i^ in a vain
ostentation, seeking therein their own praise, or in a civil respect only of
honesty: but this offer of David proceeds from true ^haritie wrought by
faith. 5. Now David, all the time of this plague humbled himself, as is most
lik^, in prayer unto God: but upon the sight of the Angel he i^ more
effectually moved wi^h compassion: and especially because Jerusalem, which was
the city and glory of the kingdom, was now next: And hitherto David offered
not himself to the plague, because as Chrysostom coniectureth, Chrisost. ibid.
he still expected and made account himself to be taken away in ^his plague:
but now, seeing that it was Gods will to spare him, he does voluntarily offer
himself. Mart.

Quest. 16. v. 21. Why David builds an Altar unto God in the threshing floor
of Araunah.
1. It pleased God to make choice of this place, because it pleased him there
to have a house built unto himself: and why here rather then at Gilgal, Silo,
Nob, Mispah, Gibeon, where the Tabernacle was at this present? no other reason
can be given, then because it so pleased God: as in the days of Elias, there
were many widows, yet the Prophet Elias was only sent to the widow of
Sarepta: Mart. 2. This being the principal cause, yet other things concurred:
this was the same place the hill Moriah, where Abraham would have sacrificed
Isaac: and in the same place, namely at Jerusalem, Christ the son of God
offered up himself in sacrifice. 3. And in this place the benefit was
received: there the Angel held his hand, and put up his sword into his sheath,
as it is said 1. Chron. 21.27. therefore in that very place David offered
sacrifice to show his thankfulness. 4. And an other reason is yielded why in
that place David built an Altar, because being afraid of the sword of the
Angel, and the danger being present, he could not go unto Gibeon, where the
Tabernacle then was. 1. Chro. 21.30.

Quest. 17. v. 23. What this Araunah the Iebusite was.
1. He is called also Ornan, 1. Chron. 21. it was no strange thing in those
days for one to be called by diverse names: or he being a stranger his name
might be somewhat altered in the pronuntiation, as names are when they are used
or taken up in a strange language: Mart. 2. For his nation and kindred, Kimhi
thinks he was not a Iebusite, for they were Cananites, and commanded to be
rooted out: he rather takes it, he was of the race of Abimelech: But the text
says he was a Iebusite, which is of a more credit, then any other humane
conjecture: though he were a Iebusite, yet he might be spared, being converted
to the faith of Israel. 3. Some think, he had been the King of the Iebusites,
Vatab. Osiand. and that by his means the fort of Sion was delivered up: but
these things are uncertain: he is in deed called a king, v. 23. in respect of
his princely liberality, v. 23. Genevens. and it is like he was some
principal man among his own nation, and of great authority. Borrh. for it
seems by this that all the Iebusites were not expelled Jerusalem, but there
remained some either converted to their faith, or else they became tributarie
and servants unto them: sure it is, that he was one of David's chief friends,
and was spared, when the rest of the Iebusites were overcome at the taking of
the fort of Sion: Joseph. 4. In that David comes to build an Altar in the
ground of a stranger, it was an evident type of the vocation of the Gentiles,
among whom the Lord would have his Church. Mart.

Quest. 18. Of Araunah his liberality, and why David refused it.
1. Araunah in this bountiful offer to the King, to give him both oxen for the
sacrifice, and other instruments for wood, shows the lively fruits of faith
in those that are truly converted unto God: Mart. and he was a type of the
Gentiles, who being called to the faith of Jesus, thought nothing too dear
for Gods service: Pelican.

2. Yet David would not accept of this kindness, both in regard of Araunah,
whose ground he would not take from him: for being once consecrated unto the
worship of God, it could no more return to the former owner, or be privately
used: and in respect of himself, he would not offer unto God a mean thing,
not in it self, but because it cost David nothing: and so the service should
have been done rather by Araunah then by David: David therefore here according
to that saying of Solomon; Honor the Lord with thy riches, Prove. 3.9. would
offer unto God of his own, and not of an others. Mart.

Quest. 19. v. 24. Of the price which David bought Araunahs threshing floor at.
Here it is said that he bought the threshing floor and the oxen for 50.
sheckles of silver: but 1. Chron. 21.15. it is thus written, that he gave for
the place 600. shekles of gold by weight.

1. The Hebrews say, that because this place was to serve for a public use to
build a Temple in, every tribe gave 50. sheckles, which counting 12. tribes,
makes in all 600. sheckles: and that the sheckles were gathered in silver, and
by David turned into gold: But this purchase was made upon the present: David
had no time to make any such collection among the tribes.

2. Some think that David gave 50. sheckles at the first, upon the purchase,
and afterward 600. sheckles of his liberality: ex Martyr. but it is not like,
that David's frank gift should so much exceed the just price.

3. Some think that David gave 50. sheckles for some part, and bought as much
afterward, as came to 550. sheckles more: Genevens. but these two sums can
not be put together: for the 50. were of silver, and the 600. of gold.

4. Neither was the 50. sheckles for the oxen, and the 600. sheckles of gold
for the threshing floor: Borrh. which amounts to a 1500. dollors, that is,
so many ownces of silver or five shilling pieces: Iun. for it is like that not
the bare threshing floor was valued at so much.

5. Therefore the best solution is, that he gave 50. sheckles of silver for the
oxen only, which make about 12. dollors: and for the whole place, and ground
with the houses, where the Temple was afterward built, 600. sheckles of gold.

Quest. 20. v. 25. How it was lawful for David to build an Altar here, there
neither being the Arc nor Tabernacle.
1. David did not this of himself: for Gad was admonished by the Angel to
speak unto David, there to build an Altar: So it is like, when the holy men of
God offered in the high places, that they did it not without Gods direction,
though it be not always expressed: 2. Now whereas the Tabernacle was at Gibeon
at this time, where most of the Priests gave their attendance: yet there were
also diverse, and the chief of them, as Zadok and Abiathar, which kept with
the Arc at Jerusalem: c. 15.25. 3. Beside an other reason is yielded, why
David could not go to Gibeon: because he was afraid of the sword of the Angel,
and it might be was stricken with some infirmity, at the least he was in great
fear, because of the present danger. 4. This Altar here built was a type of
the true Altar Christ Jesus, who was to suffer at Jerusalem: So the Apostle
calls Christ the Altar, Hebr. 13.10. that place therefore serves not to
prove, that there ought to be still any material altars in the Church. But
Tonstall replieth: that of that Altar they have no authority to eat, but
Christ is to be eaten: therefore he is not meant by that altar. Contra. The
words following must be weighed: they have no authority to eat, which serve
in the Tabernacle: but they which are under the Gospel, do eat of this Altar.
Mart.

Quest. 21. v. 25. Of the Lords acceptance of David's sacrifice.
1. God showed his acceptance, in that he answered David in sending fire from
heaven: 1. Chron. 11.26. as Aarons sacrifice, Leuit. 9. was approved by fire
from heau^n: so also Gedeons by fire out of the rock, Judge. 6.21. and Helias
sacrifice was set on fire from heaven, 1. King. 18.38. Mart. for otherwise it
was not lawful to use any strange fire, not taken from the Altar, as
appears by the punishment of Nadab and Abihu, Leuit. 10.1. Genevens. 2. This
sacrifice wa^ not acceptable in it self, but as it was a type of Christ, and
offered by faith in him: it being also joined with the prayers of David, and of
the rest of the people. In Christ then both our altar and sacrifice God is well
pleased, by whom we are delivered from everlasting plagues, as now Israel was
from this temporal: To whom be ascribed all praise for ever. Amen.
