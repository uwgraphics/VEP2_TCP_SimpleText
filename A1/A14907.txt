EXERCITATIONS DIVINE.

Containing diverse Questions and Solutions for the right understanding of the
Scriptures.

Proving the necessity, majesty, integrity, perspicuitie, and sense thereof.

As also showing the singular prerogatives wherewith the Lord endued those whom
he appointed to be the penmen of them.

Together with the excellency and use of Divinity above all humane Sciences.

All which are cleared out of the Hebrew, and Greek, the two original
languages in which the Scriptures were first written, by comparing them with
the Samaritane, Chaldie, and Syriack Copies, and with the Greek Interpretors,
and vulgar Latin translation.

Exchange. 1632.

To The Right Honorable, Sr. Thomas Coventrie Knight, Lord Coventrie, Baron of
Alesborough, Lord Keeper of his Majesty's Great Seal of ENGLAND.
Most Honorable and my very good Lord,
JOB the wisest and the Job. 28. 7.
richest Prince in the East, searching where wisdom might be found, he could
not find the place thereof; He could not find it in the land of the living;
the depth says, it is not with me; and the Sea says, it is not with me; the
Vultures eye has not seen it for all his sharp sight; and for the worth of
it, it cannot be gotten for Gold, neither can Silver be weighed for the price
thereof; then he subjoyneth, God understands the way thereof, and he knows
the place thereof: for he looks to the ends of the earth, and sees under the
whole heaven. The wisdom which Job speaks of here, is Gods secret wisdom
in his works of nature, which none of the world, although they were as sharp
sighted as the Eagle, can understand. Now if man be so ignorant in Gods works
of nature, much more is he in the works of grace; and he may say as Agur said,
when he considered Ithiel and Vcal (Jesus Christ the wisdom of the Father)
surely I am more brutish Pro. 30. 2,
then any man, and have not the understanding of a man. David when he looked
upon the heavens, the works of Gods hands, he Psalm. 19. 1.
said; The heavens declare the glory of God, and the firmament shows his
handy work: then he tells how they declare his glory and what sort of
Preachers they be, The universality of their preaching, their line is gone out
through all the earth even, to the ends of the world; Then their diligence in
preaching, both day and night; Lastly, how plainly they preach, n all
languages. Yet this their preaching is but an indistinct sort of preaching in
respect of the preaching of the Gospel. We may see some of his wisdom in the
heavens which are his handy work: but nothing of the hid treasure and riches
hid up in Jesus Christ, can we learn by this preaching. But Paul speaking of
the preaching of the Gospel by the Apostles, says, their sound went out into
all the earth, and their words into the ends of the world; he Romans 10. 18.
changes their line into their sound. There is a great difference betwixt
these two sorts of preaching, a naughty person winketh with his eyes, he
speaks with his feet, and teaches with his fingers, but he speaks more
Pro. 6. 13.
distinctly with his tongue: So the Lord preaches indistinctly (as it were) by
his work; but by the sound of his Gospel, he preaches clearly and plainly.
Where shall we find these treasures of grace and hid wisdom? this treasure
is to be found in his Law; therefore the Jews call it desiderium mundi, and
it is more to be desired, than Gold yea than most fine Gold. The Angels
themselves Psalm. 19. 10.
with stretched out necks, desire to look into this mystery; even as the
Cherubims with stretched out necks looked down to the propitiatory. If the
Angels 1 Pet. 1. 12.
have such a desire to behold this wisdom, much more should man have a desire
to search into these mysteries: for he took not upon him the nature of Angels,
but he took Heb. 2. 16.
on him the seed of Abraham: Happy is that man that finds this wisdom,
and the man that gets understanding, this wisdom is only to be found in
the Law of the Pro. 3. 13.
Lord. I have indevoured (my Noble Lord) in this treatise to make some small
path for the younger sort to this wisdom; And I have abstained from these
questions which do more hurt than good to the Church. Plutarch makes mention
of a number of Suitors to one maid, but they fell to such contention amongst
themselves, that they did tear her all in pieces: too many disputations in
effect do rent the truth, and nimium altercando amittitur veritas: the best
way to come by the knowledge of the truth, is, to be conversant in the Text it
self, and to be acquainted with the phrase of the holy Ghost speaking in his
own language. Let it not seem strange to any, that I seeming a stranger
should take this boldness to offer these my labors to your Lordship. I cannot
acknowledge such strangeness: for we have one Lord, one faith, one baptism,
one Ephe. 4. 13.
God and Father of us all; We live all under one gracious King, and there is
small or no Heb. 13. 13.
difference in our language: we differ not as the Act. 2.
Cananites and these of Ashdod, ye say sibboleth and we say shibboleth, ye
speak the Dialect of Matthew. 26. 73.
Jerusalem, and we the Dialect of Galilee, small or no difference. But the
reason wherefore I made choice of your honor, is the good report which I hear
of you every where, your name smells as the wine of Lebanon, ye have put on
righteousness as a garment, ye are eyes to the blind and feet to the lame:
Hos. 14. 7.
the blessing of him that is ready to perish Job 29. 14.
comes upon you, and you have caused the widows heart to sing for joy I here
were many notable and excellent parts in Job, he despised not the counsel of
his manservant or of his maidservant, here was his humility: yet when he sat
in judgment, what grace and majesty had he? they gave ear and kept silence
at his counsel; the young men saw him and hid themselves, and the aged arose
and stood up before him; he was hospitable to the poor, he did not eat his
Job. 30. 1.
morsels alone, he was pitiful to the fatherless and to the widow, and he
disdained the wicked, that he would not set them with the dogs of his flock:
happy is that Land where there are such judges. Another cause which moved me to
grace this work with your Lordships name, is the desire I have, that others
may read it the more willingly for their own profit, and even as a fair
entry leads the beholder to look more particularly upon every part of the
building: so the beholder of this work set out under the protection of your
honors virtue, will the more earnestly affect the perusing of the same, in
confidence that so much worth as is eminent in your Lordship would hinder any
man's boldness to present unto you a trifle. And for conclusion, when Jacob was
to send his son Benjamin into Egypt, he prayed that Genesis 42. 14.
God Almighty would give him favor before the man: So my earnest prayer to God
is, that this treatise may first be acceptable to the Church of God, and then
unto your Lordship: And so I have obtained that which I desire. The grace of
God be with your Lordship, and make that the long continuance in the charge
which his Majesty most worthily has laid upon you, may produce long
happiness to this Common wealth.

Your honors in all dutiful submission, John Weemse.

A loving advertisement to young Students in Divinity, who desire to come to
the knowledge of the holy Scriptures.
LOving Brethren; There be three Schools in which young Divines must be
exercised; the school of Arts and Sciences, the School of grace, and the
School of your vocation. It is a great help and an introduction to Divinity,
to be trained up in the first School of Arts and Sciences: Moses was learned
in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, Daniel in the learning of the Chaldeans,
and Dionysius Areopagita was trained up in Philosophy. Act. 7. 22.
A certain Schooler amongst the Jews asked Dan. 1. 4.
one of the R. His Master, whether he might read any of the humane Writers or
not? he gave him this Answer; Act. 17. 34.
you may read them, providing you read them neither day nor night: this was a
foolish answer, for the Jews hated all humane learning; therefore they say,
maledictus qui aluerit Suem, aut didicerit Sapientiam Graecorum, they call all
humane learning the wisdom of the Greeks. But to shut up this School, and to
take away all humane learning from a Divine, were in effect to make him no
Divine. The knowledge of all Arts and Sciences is necessary for him, as of
Geometry, Arithmeticke, Geographie, the knowledge of Physic, but above all
the knowledge of the tongues is more necessary for him, because they are
Vehicula scientiarum. But here ye must not only study that part of the
tongues which is called (...), which is mere Grammar, as to stand upon Letters,
Accents, Pronounciation and such, but ye must go farther to that part which is
called (...), the true meaning of the words, to interpret them out of one
language into another, and to understand one Phrase by another: neither should
ye stand here, but ye must go further to that part which is called (...), to
censure and discern the true reading from the false as the Masoreth did who
excelled in this. In the wars there are three sorts of signs to direct the
Soldiers, muta, semivocalia and vocalia: Muta, as the ensigns, Semivocalia,
as the trumpets: Vocalia as the words of the Captain: So some signs are Muta,
as Arts and Sciences; Semivocalia, as the knowledge of the tongues; and
Vocalia, as the meaning of the holy Ghost speaking in the Scriptures. The
knowledge of these is most necessary for you who intend to apply your minds to
the study of Divinity: for by them ye shall understand the Properties and
Phrases of the holy Gbost, the ancient customs of the people of God, and the
sweet allusions in the third, which otherwise ye shall never be able to
understand. And if ye begin to learn these tongues when ye are young, to what
great perfection may ye attain unto before ye come to be teachers of others?
Cicero makes mention of Marcus Crassus, who walking one day Cicero De oratore:
upon the sea shore, saw a boy who had found a boat there, but he having no
helps to further him to sail; first he got Oars, then a Mast, raes, sails,
and ropes, and then he set to the Sea: so from little beginnings, if ye be
willing, ye may attain to a great measure of knowledge, having such helps in
this age, which your Fathers never knew, and the gleanings of Ephraim Iud. 8: 2:
now, are better than the vintage of Abiezer was then; ye have now many learned
and skillful guides. The Jews say; Qui discit a junioribus cui similis est?
Edenti uvas acerbas, and bibenti e torculari: at qui discit a Senioribus cui
similis? Edenti uvas maturas and bibenti vinum vetus. Ye need not set your
teeth on edge with sour Grapes, for now ye have store of ripe Grapes gathered
by your old Masters. The sluggard that keeps his hand in his bosom, and
says, there is a Lion in the way; alleges that the Jews are but fabulous,
and that it Prove. 22. 13.
is but lost time to read them: but remember that he said well, who said,
Malogranatum inveni, corticem abjeci, and quod intus est comedi. Cast away the
unprofitable things and make choice of that which is profitable. Others say,
they cannot attain to such perfection in these tongues as the Translators have
done who have Translated the Scriptures already: and therefore they will
content themselves with their travels; but how shall they know whether they
have translated well or not? They must give credit only to the bearer, and if
the Trench-man fail them, then they are gone. The Queen of Sheba was much
more delighted to hear Solomon himself speak than hear of him by report,
for she said she 1 King. 10. 7.
believed not that which was reported of him; and yet the half was not told
her: so brethren, when ye hear an Interpreter speak, scarce the half is told
you: but when ye see it in the original tongues, then ye will say; it was true
which was spoken, and the wisdom that is in them exceeds the report which
we heard. There is such profunditie in the Scriptures, that all the wits of
men can never sound the depth of them; it fares with them as it did with the
widows 1 King. 4.
Oil, it lasted as long as the Children brought vessels: so there is much
store and plenty in them, that when they have filled the wits and
understandings of the best, yet there is enough to be gotten out of them, by
those who come after. And here I cannot let pass how much these honorable
Patrons are to be respected, who entertain and cherish these professors in
the tongues, for without such, knowledge would soon decay. David made a
statute in Israel, that they who tarried by the stuff should part alike with
those who went to battle. The professors of the tongues are they who keep the
stuff, and they should be as well rewarded as they who go to the field and
fight 1 Samuel 30. 24.
in the ministry. I have indevoured (brethren) according to my mean measure
of knowledge to make a little path unto you, to encourage you, and to let you
see what profit you may have by this kind of study, and how it may serve you
in your ministry, and if ye reap any benefit by it, be thankful to the God
of heaven the Father of lights from whom all good things descend, and then to
my Noble Patron my Lord Keeper who does encourage me much to go on in this
kind of study. And now when we have made some progress in this first
School, and have attained to some measure of knowledge, see that your
knowledge turn not like the waters of Jordan that run into the dead Sea, but
let them be like those waters which come from the Sea and return to the Sea
again, let them return to the praise of him who gave them. Next when ye
Eccles. 1. 7.
are in the School of grace, that ye may understand the Spiritual meaning of
the holy Scriptures, acquaint your selves with prayer. Elias was a man subject
to the like passions as we are, yet he prayed, Iam 5. 17.
and the Heavens were opened and gave rain: so although ye be men, subject to
the same passions to which others are subject; yet if ye pray earnestly to the
Lord, he will open the heavens, and send down that Spiritual rain upon you,
and fit you for the School of your calling. And here ye must be careful Ier.
2. 8.
to study the Law of the Lord, and to handle it (...)
diligently. Jeremiah borrows this speech from those who are trained in the
wars, and they are said Tractare bellum, ye must be skillful and trained
before ye enter into this calling, that being entered Number. 31. 27.
in it, ye may begin to turn the key of knowledge to open the Scriptures to
your hearers, so that ye may have store both of new and old to bring forth when
your Lord and Master shall set you over his household to give his servants their
meat in due season. And at last he will say unto you, ye have been faithful
over Matthew. 25. 23:
a few things, I will make you ruler over many things. Lectio stata juvat,
varia delecta. Seneca:

EXERCITATIONS DIVINE.
The first Book, containing diverse Questions for the understanding of the
Scriptures in general.
Exercitat. Divine. 1.
Of the excellency of DIVINITY, above all other Sciences.

2 TIMOT. 3. 16. All Scripture is given by inspiration of God, etc.
HVmane Sciences and Arts, have Humane Sciences and Arts compared to the dough
brought out of Egypt, and Divinity to Manna.
been fitly compared to the dough which the Israelites brought out of Egypt,
Exodus 12. 34. which they fed upon until they got Manna: This dough was
prepared by much labor; by plowing, by sowing, by reaping, by grinding,
kneading, and baking: So humane Sciences which are the birth of reason, are
bred below here: but Divinity is like unto Manna which was prepared or ready
to their hand; they neither plowed for it, neither did sow it, nor reaped it.
So Divinity is prepared in heaven, and sent down to teach the Church here
below. The dough which they brought out of Egypt, Deuteronomy. 16. 3. is called, panis
pauperum, the poores The dough the bread of the poor.
bread; it is called the poores bread, because the poor in their necessity
could not be at leisure to ferment it, and it had not so pleasant a relish;
therefore it is called the poores bread: but Manna is called the bread of Manna
the bread of Angels.
Angels, Psalm. 78. 25. It is called the bread of Angels, because it was brought
down by their ministry; and it was so pleasant in taste, that if the Angels
had eaten bread, it might have served them: So 1 Cor. 13. 1. If I speak with
the tongue of Angels, that is, if the Angels had tongues to speak with: And as
far as Manna surpassed the poores bread, as far and farther does Divinity
surpass humane Sciences and Arts.

Again, the world has been well compared to Egypt, The world compared to
Egypt, and the Church to Canaan.
and the Church to Canaan: Egypt was a Land that was watered with the feet of
men, Deuteronomy. 11, 10. It was said to be watered with the feet of men, as a
garden, Egypt watered with the feet of men.
because they carried water on foot out of Nilus, and watered their Land with
it: but Canaan was a Land Canaan a land blessed of God.
blessed of God, and his eyes were upon it from the beginning of the year to
the end, Deuteronomy. 11. 12. It was a land of hills and valleys, and drinks water
of the rain of heaven. The world is but watered with humane Sciences and Arts,
which are drawn out of the troubled reason of man like Nilus: but the Church
is watered with these celestial graces which come from above.

Now that we may see the excellency of Divinity above A comparison betwixt
Divinity, and all other Sciences and Arts in general.
all other Sciences and Arts, let us observe wherein they differ in general,
and then let us make a particular comparison betwixt Divinity and other
Sciences and Arts.

First, they differ origin, in the original: humane Revel. 22. 1. And he
showed me a pure river of water of life, clear as cristall, proceeding out of
the throne of God and of the Lamb: but these humane Sciences and Arts,
although they proceed from God, yet they proceed not from God and the Lamb
like a cristall river.

Secondly, these humane Sciences and Arts, are but humano-divinae, they are but
the brood of reason, which proceeds from God enlightening every man that
comes into the world, John 1. 9. Some again are humane and the birth of
corrupt man only, as Sophistry: Scientia hu^ano-divina humana. diabolica.
divino-divina


And thirdly, some are Diabolicae, as necromancie and witchcraft: But Divinity
is Divino-divina, that is, it is originally from God and immediately.

And if we shall compare Faith the daughter of Divinity, A comparison betwixt
sense, reason, and faith.
and Arts, we shall see how far Divinity excels all other Sciences and
Arts.

There are in man, sense, reason, and faith; and as far as reason surpasses
sense, much farther does faith surpass reason; and by consequent Divinity
surpasses all other Sciences.

Reason differs much from sense, for sense the farther How sense, reason, and
faith apprehend things.
that the object is from it, it is magis universale and magis confusum, it is
the more universal and more confused; and the nearer that the object comes to
the sense, it is the less universal and more distinct: Example, when we see
an object a far off, we take it up first to be ens somewhat, then we take it
up to be a living creature, then we take it up to be a man, and last to be
Peter or John; Here the nearer that the object comes to our sense, it is
less universal and more distinct; and the farther that it is removed from our
sense, it is the more universal and more confused. The knowledge which a minus
universale, to the supreme and highest cause, God himself; and the nearer
that faith comes to reason or sense, the weaker it is and more indistinct.
Thomas his faith was an indistinct faith and weak, and could not believe
unless he put his fingers in the wounds of Christ, John 20. 28. here his
faith leaned too much to sense; but faith the higher that it goes from sense
and reason, the more perfect it is; We have a notable example of this, Genesis 49.
when Joseph took Ephraim and Manasse, Ephraim in his right hand toward
Isreal's left hand, and brought him near unto him, and Manasse in his left hand
toward Isreal's right hand, Israel stretched out his right hand and laid it upon
Ephraims head, and his left hand upon Manasses head, guiding his hands
wittingly, or as Onkelos the Chaldee Paraphrast has it, Prudenter egit manibus
suis, when he dealt wisely with his hands: But when Joseph saw that his father
laid his right hand upon the head of Ephraim, it displeased him, and he held up
his fathers hand, and he said to his father, not so my father, for this is the
first borne, put thy right hand upon his head: and his father refused and said,
I know it my son, I know it truly, the younger shall be greater than he, Genesis
48. 19. Joseph thought because his father Jacob was blind that his faith was a
confused and weak faith, but Jacob knew that the farther his faith was from
sense, and the higher that it ascended from reason, it was the more perfect,
and therefore he said jadanghti been jadanghti, I know it my son, I know (...)
it; that is, certainly I know it. This is then the excellency of faith, that
the higher that it goes from sense and reason the more perfect it is, which
shows the excellency of Divinity above all other Sciences and Arts; for if
faith the daughter of Divinity surpasses them all, much more does Divinity it
self: and it may be said of faith, as it was said of the virtuous woman,
Prove. 30. Many daughters in Israel have done virtuously, but thou surpassest
them all.

Last of all, other Sciences and Arts are but handmaids Nethinims the
posterity of the Gibionits were appointed by Iosuah to hew wood and draw water
for the Sanctuary, but never to meddle with the Sacrifices, neither to kill
them nor offer them, Josh. 9. 23. so humane Sciences and Arts are appointed but
to attend and serve Divinity, they are but to hew the wood, and draw the water
only to the Sanctuary.

There are three principles from whence Sciences A comparison betwixt Divinity
and other Sciences.
and Arts are derived, the first is contemplation, the second is action, the
third is operation.

For contemplation, the metaphysics are the most abstract, considering ens ut
ens only: the second are the mathematics, which considers the quantity and
the number of things; geometry the quantity, and arithmeticke the number.
Thirdly, the Physics consider only natural properties of the body.

These who are exercised in actions and moral philosophy, are laws and such.

Arts which are exercised in operation are rhetoric and grammar.

Metaphysicke considers God only, ut ens vnum, A comparison betwixt Divinity
and Metaphysics.
verum et bonum, as he has a being, as he is one, as he is truth and
goodness; but it considers not God as Creator, Christ as Redeemer, it
considers not God in his attributes as Divinity does, and therefore they say
metaphysica parit scientiam tantum, sed theologia fidem.

Secondly, compare Divinity with physic and A comparison betwixt Divinity,
Mathematics, and Physics.
the mathematics, the mathematician searches visible forms in visible
things, the Physician invisible forms in visible things; but the Divine
invisible forms in visible things.

Thirdly, let us compare the Divine, the Lawyer and A comparison betwixt the
Divine, the Lawyer, and the Physician.
Physician; the Physician est minister naturae, the servant of nature, the
Lawyer est minister justitiae, but the Divine est minister gratiae: and look
how far grace exceeds nature or justice, so as far does Divinity surpass
the Physician or the Lawyer.

Fourthly, let us compare Divinity and moral philosophy, A comparison betwixt
the Divine, and moral Philosopher.
the Philosopher says, that Iuvenis non est idoneus auditor moralis
Philosophiae, that a young man is not fit to hear moral philosophy, but David
says, Psalm. 119 9. Wherewith shall a young man cleanse his ways. Chrysostom
has a good observation to show the force of Divinity above all moral
philosophy, when he compares Plato the moralist and Paul the Apostle
together: Plato says he, that wise Philosopher came three times to Sicilie to
convert Dionysius the tyrant to moral philosophy, yet he went away without any
success: but Paul a Tent-maker did not only convert Sicilie, but ran from
Jerusalem to Illyricum, Romans 15. 19. and converted thousands of souls by the
preaching of the Gospel. See how far Divinity excels moral philosophy.
August. de Civitate Dei. lib. 6. cap. 11.
And Augustine observes how Seneca the most excellent of all the moralists,
mocked the Jews, because they spent (as he thought) the seventh part of their
life in idleness, which was the Sabbath day. Iustine Martyr being first a
philosopher, and after a martyr, searched through all the sects of philosophy,
and could never find contentment to his soul till he came to Divinity. First
he came to the sect of the Stoickes and gave himself to be a scholar in that
school, but hearing nothing of God in Stoa in that school, he turned to be a
Peripatetick: but when he entered with the Peripateticks, he perceived his
master nundinantem sapientiam mercede (as he speaks) selling his wisdom for
gain, then he left that sect also. Thirdly, he came to the sect of the
Pythagoreans, but having no skill in geometry (which knowledge Pythagoras
required of his Scholars before he taught them philosophy) he left the
Pythagoreans and fell into the society of the Platonickes: at last he met with
a Christian Divine Philosopher who persuaded him to cast aside all these
circular disciplines, and to study Divinity which should give him greater
contentment than all the philosophy in the world, and he renouncing all gave
himself to the studying of the holy Scriptures, and of a Philosopher became
both a Christian and a Martyr. A comparison betwixt Divinity, and Physic
alone.


Fifthly; let us compare Divinity and Physic alone, they say ubi desinit
physicus ibi incipit medicus, Where the natural philosopher leaves, there the
Physician begins, but we may say, ubi desinit Physicus, ibi incipit
Theologus, where the Physician leaves off, there the Divine begins; for
when the Physician has done his last cure and given over the patient,
heresignes him into the hands of the Divine, or if he be a religious Physician,
he is glad to play the Divine to him himself; the Physician shows the
patient that his health consists in letting of blood, but the Divine shows
that the health of his patient consists by the letting of the blood of Christ.

Sixthly, compare Divinity and the mathematics, the A comparison betwixt
Divinity and the Mathematics alone.
mathematician considers the length, the height and the breadth of things,
but be never considers what is the height, the breadth and the length of the
love of Christ, Ephesians. 3. 8. he never teaches a man to number his days, that
he may apply his heart to wisdom, Psalm. 90. 12. as the Divine does. A
comparison betwixt Divinity, Grammar, and Rhetoric.


Lastly, compare Divinity with grammar and rhetoric: hearing of others
teaches us to speak; grammar teaches us to speak congruously, and
rhetoric teaches us to speak eloquently, but Divinity teaches us to speak
the language of Canaan, Esaias 19. 18.

Whether comes Laws or Physic nearer to

We must answer here by distinction, the Law Pars legis. (...). (...).


pleading of causes; the first part comes nearer to Divinity than physic
does, because the Physician is exercised only about the health of the body,
and if he speak any thing to his patient of temperance or restraining of his
passions, all this he does but for his patients health. But the nomotheticke or
maker of the law, does all things for the well ordering of the people; and
look how much more excellent it is to live well, than to live in good health:
so much more that part of the law excels physic. But physic again is to
be preferred to that part of the Law which is called litigiosa or the litigious
part of the law, because that part of the law does not respect the
commonwealth, or the manners of the people, but to give this or that particular
man his right: But to cure this or that particular man, is better than to
restore this or that particular man to his goods; for skin for skin, and all
that a man has will he give for his life, Job. 1. therefore physic excels
the litigious part of the Law.

It may be said that Divinity borrows many things

This argues no want in Divinity, but only a defect

Divinity is not (...) or a general sum of all Sciences and Arts, or one
universal director to all our actions as they are natural, civil, or
oeconomicall.

But Paul bids Timothy take a little wine to comfort him, 1 Timothy 5. 23. So
Moses sets down weights and measures in the Law.

When Paul bids Timothy take some wine to comfort Moses sets down
weights and measures, this is not his last end that there may be commutative
justice amongst the children of Israel; Paul's last end and chief consideration
is this, that Timothy having a sound body may be able to glorify God in his
ministry. So Moses considers weights and measures, that Gods people might
do no wrong, but glorify God in their calling; And as one thing may belong to
the mathematitian in respect of the midst, and to the Physician in respect of
the thing it self, as when a Physician shows that a round wound is more
hardly cured than a long wound, although the Physician show this by the
principles of geometry, yet he cures not the wound as a Goemetrician but as a
Physician. So when a Divine speaks of weights and measures, and health of
body, although they belong to the politickes or physickes in respect of the
midst, yet in respect of the end they belong to Divinity.

Other Sciences are not directly subordinate to Divinity; these sciences which
are directly subordinate, the conclusions of the superior Sciences are the
principles of the inferior, as the conclusions of arithmeticke are the
principles of music, and these sciences which are directly subordinate here,
have but some new accident added to them, to make a distinction betwixt them
and the superior Sciences, as music subordinate to arithmeticke has this
accident superadded to it, to be numerus sonorus a number with sound, but
Divinity and other Sciences toto genere differunt, they are altogether
different.

Other Sciences are not directly subordinate to Divinity but only in respect
of the end, the Apothecary Subordinatio directa. ratione finis.


is directly subordinate to the Physician; therefore he prescribes unto him
all his ingredients, what hot Sciences and Arts subordinate to Divinity, in
respect of the end.
things he must use and what cold, what drachmes and what scruples: the Tailor
again is not directly subordinate to the Doctor, but only in respect of the
end, therefore the Doctor prescribes not unto him how much he should make in a
gown; ask the Doctor why he gives physic to a man? and he will answer,
for the preservation of the body: So ask the Tailor why he makes clothes for
him? he will answer for the same end; here the inferior, the Tailor, is
subordinate to the Doctor, only in respect of the end: So all Sciences and
Arts are but indirectly subordinate to Divinity, and in respect of the end, and
therefore they have not their particular directions from Divinity.

The conclusion of this is: All Sciences are found out

All Sciences are subordinate to Divinity in respect

EXERCITATI. II.
What use reason has in Divinity.

2 Cor. 10. 5. And bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of
Christ.
AS God in the creation set up two lights to guide and to direct the world,
Genesis 1. 16. so the Lord has given two lights to direct man; the light of
reason to direct him in things below here, and Divine light to direct him in
things above: these two lights the Grace does not extinguish reason, but
rectifieth it.
one of them does not extinguish the other, but only diminish it, and makes
it fall down and give place, and then rectifieth and exalts it. Esa. 42. 15.
I will make the rivers ylands, and I will dry up the pooles. The rivers come
from the fountains, but yet when the light of grace comes in, then the
rivers are diminished and they decrease that the dry land may appear: reason
is not taken away here, but it falls down and gives way to grace; but the
pooles shall be dried up, that is, grace takes away schisms and herisies and
dries them up: but when reason submits her self to Divinity and is
rectified, she has good use in Divinity. And even as a Dwarf set upon a
Giants shoulders sees much further than he did before: so does reason when it
is rectified by Divinity; and so grace does not extinguish reason but
perfecteth it: and therefore Iustine Martyr called religion true philosophy,
and then he says, he became a Philosopher when he became a Christian.

Let us consider first what is above the reach of reason Things that reason is
not able to do in Divinity and matters of Faith.
in Divinity. First, reason cannot be a judge in matters Divine, for reason
can never judge of the object of supernatural verity. Reason shows this much
to a man: when it sees the antecedent and the consequent, that this follows
rightly upon that: but reason never judges of the object of supernatural
verity, but Divinity enlighteneth the mind and makes the spiritual man to
judge of this. A Carpenter when he is working, does see by his eye when he
applies the ex concessis, of things granted, if faith be the cause and works
the effect, then they must necessarily go together, and reason goes no higher.

Secondly, no midst taken from philosophy can make up a Divine conclusion,
neither would it beget faith in a man. Example, God is not the efficient cause
of sin, the efficient cause is a term attributed to God: here if a Divine
should go about to prove either by logic or grounds of metaphysicke, this
conclusion were not a Divine conclusion, whereupon a man's faith might rest, as
if he should reason this ways, No efficient cause can produce a defect but an
effect, God is an efficient cause, and sin is a defect, therefore God cannot
produce sin; this were but an humane conclusion and could not beget faith. So
if he should reason from the grounds of metaphysicke this ways, God is ens
entium, and the properties of ens are vnum verum bonum, therefore God who is
ens entium cannot produce sin, because he is goodness it self; the
conclusion were but an humane conclusion and could not beget faith: but if a
Divine should prove the same by a midst taken out of the Scriptures, and should
reason thus. 1 Ioh. 2. 16. All that which is in the world, is either the
concupiscence of the flesh, or the lust of the eye, or the pride of life, not
from the Father, this midst will make up a Divine conclusion which will beget
faith in a man, and then the Christian man may say to the Philosopher as the
Samaritans said unto the woman of Samaria, I believe not now for thy reason,
but for the authority of God, which is the ground of my faith.

Thirdly, Philosophy does not inlighten the mind with spiritual knowledge, it
inlightneth the mind only with a general knowledge whereof John speaks,
John 1. 9. Romans 1. when he believes, his reason at the first is mere passive;
therefore this speech of Clemens Alexandrinus would be very warily taken,
Philosophiam Lib. 1. Strom.
(...) vocat; as though philosophy made an introduction to saving faith: And
this speech of some Divines is harshly spoken, lumen natura accendit lumen
gratiae, and Basils comparison must not be stretched over far, as Dyers
before they bring on the most perfect dye, they dye first with the baser
color, to make it the more fit to receive the more bright color: So humane
learning may be a preparation to grace. But the comparison is too far
stretched here, humane learning is a preparation to make a man understand the
axioms, syllogismes and logical part in Divinity; but a heathen philosopher
having the help of nature, is no sooner converted to the truth. A learned
Philosopher converted to the faith, may have a greater Certitudo evidentia.
adhaerentia.


certainty of evidence than a laicke, and may know the literal sense better,
but he has no greater certainety of adherence, as we see oftentimes when it
comes to the point of suffering. But seeing zeal is not always according to
knowledge, therefore knowledge of humane Sciences is a great help to the
knowledge of faith once bred, when it is sanctified.

Philosophy must not transcend her bounds and Reason must not transcend her
bounds.
commit Saltum, as they speak in the Schools, when she takes midsts which
are mere philosophical to prove any thing in Divinity; this was the fault of
most of the Schoolmen: but when she does keep herself within her bounds,
then she has good use in Divinity. Matthew. 22. the Sadduces reason this way
concerning the resurrection. If there were a resurrection, then there should
follow a great absurdity, that seven men should have one wife at the day of
judgment: but this is absurd: therefore, etc. But Divinity tells reason,
that here she goes without her bounds, measuring the estate of the life to
come, by the estate of this life, and borrows midsts which are not Divine to
prove this conclusion; for in the life to come we shall be like Angels, who
neither marry nor give in marriage, and need not to propagate their kind by
generation.

Another example. Nicodemus reasoned this ways, He that is borne again must
enter into his mothers womb, Ioh. 3. 4 no man can enter again into his mothers
womb, therefore no man can be borne again: but Divinity teaches reason that
she transcendeth her bounds here, and uses a midst which is mere natural to
prove a supernatural conclusion.

A third example, Arrius reasons this ways; he that is begotten is not
eternal, Christ is begotten, therefore he is not eternal: here Divinity
tells reason that she is out of her bounds, and applies her midsts falsely.
There is a threefold generation, first a Generatio Physica. Metaphysica.
Hyperphysica.


physical generation, secondly a metaphysicall, and thirdly an hyperphysicall:
physical generation is this, when a mortal man begets a son, and this is
done in time: metaphysicall generation is this, when the mind begets a word,
and this is always done in time: but hyperphysicall generation is that
eternal generation, and this is done before all time; and Divinity shows
reason how she misapplyeth her physical and metaphysicall generation, to this
eternal generation.

Whether is such a proposition true in Divinity, and the Son of God begotten
from all eternity, true in Divinity, the Son of God begotten from all
eternity, false in the court of reason: So Mary the Virgin bare a Son, true
in Divinity: Mary the Virgin bare a Son, false in the court of reason?

That which is true in one Science, is not false in another. Israel there was a
judicatorie of seventy who judged of matters of greatest weight, and there was
an inferior judicatory, consisting of three, and these judged of goods and
matters of least moment: that which was truly concluded in the highest
judicatory was not false in this inferior judicatory, although they could not
judge of a false Prophet as the great Synedrion did, yet they held it not false
in the lowest judicatory, when the great Synedrion concluded such a one to be a
false Prophet: So that which is true in Divinity is not false in reason, but
only above her reach; and if any thing were true in one Science, and false in
another, then verum non esset reciproca affectio entis, that is, that which
has a being should not be true, and that which is true should not have a
being, these two propositions should not be converted. There is a verity
Veritas suprae rationem. juxtae rationem. infrae rationem.


that is above reason, and there is a verity which is agreeable to reason, and
there is a verity that is under reason, the first is of things taken up by
faith, the second is of things taken up by reason, the third is of things taken
up by sense, but there is no verity contrary to reason, it is not against
reason to believe that a Virgin conceived and bare a Son, but it is above
reason.

We must not seclude reason altogether from Divinity, What use reason has in
Divinity.
Christ himself used the help of reason against the Sadduces, and Paul
against the Jews, Heb. 7. 17. Thou art a Priest for ever, after the order of
Melchizedek. This is revealed by God himself that Christ is the King of peace
and righteousness, yet to prove this and to make it manifest to the
misbeleeving Jews, he borrows a help of a logical notation, saying, which
is by interpretation, the King of righteousness, the King of peace, Heb. 7. 2.
So Christ uses reason against the Sadduces: God is the God of Abraham, Isaac
and Jacob, hence he inferferreth this consequent, that they must live.

But they say that Christ and Paul were immediately

If Paul's extraordinary calling had given him power to use reason, then they
had spoken to the purpose, but he uses reason as common to him and to all
other men, whether Apostles or not Apostles.

But they say, that Christ's authority and Paul's was

This we grant, they disputed against those Sadduces, and Paul against the
Jews.

But whatsoever was pronounced by Christ against Sadduces, or by Paul against
the Jews, it became by and by holy Scripture, which we cannot say of our
conclusions.

Although arguments used by Christ and his Apostles

Whether were the Sadduces bound to believe this

By the force of this consequence as it were the

Seeing humane midsts have no force to bind of

This is done for the infirmity of man, who is hard Spectacles as a help to
his sight: so the perverse heriticks make us to bring in these humane midsts,
whereas the midsts taken out of the Word of God should serve by themselves to
convince. When Christ rose again, Thomas doubted of the resurrection and
thought that his body had been but a Spirit, but Christ bearing with his
infirmity, by this humane midst proves that he is flesh, because he may be
touched and felt.

Observe again that in Divinity some propositions are merely Divine, and some
are mixtly Divine. These that are merely Divine, reason can do little thing
here, it can but join the terms together, but it cannot take up these great
mysteries; example, if I were disputing against the Monothelites who denied
that there were two natures in Christ, and should reason thus; Where there are
two natures, there are two wills; but in Christ there are two natures, therefore
two wills. That in Christ there are two wills, this is a proposition merely
Divine, reason can never take up this, yet reason shows this much, where
there are two natures there must be two wills, and it judges only of the
connection of these two, but it cannot judge of the verity of this, whether
there be two wills in Christ or not.

Ye will say then, what does reason in the verity

Reason in a regenerate man concludes not that to Stoicke called Paul a
babbler, Act. 17. 18, when he disputed against them for the resurrection, and
called it a new doctrine.

In these propositions again which are mixtly Divine, reason has a further
hand; example, No natural body can be in more places at once, Christ's body is a
natural body, therefore it cannot be in more places at once; this is mixtly
Divine, for the properties of a natural body shows us that it cannot be in
more places at once, and the Scripture also, shows us that Christ's body is a
natural body.

But is not this a mixture of Divinity and humane

This makes not a mixture of Divinity and philosophy,

When we use reason to help our weakness, we do not ground our faith upon
reason or upon the light of nature, but upon that supernatural light; and the
light of nature comes in, but as in the second room

How can reason serve in Divinity seeing the natural

We must distinguish inter concretum and abstractum impugneth it not, and the
greater light extinguisheth not the lesser, and verity does not contradict it
self; and truth in philosophy, is but the footestep of that truth which is in
God by way of excellency.

The conclusion of this is, contra rationem nemo sobrius dicit, contra
scripturam nemo christianus, and contra ecclesiam nemo pacisicus: we must
learn then to give every one of these their own place and not to reject
reason altogether from Divinity, but to captivate her and make her a handmaid
to Divinity.

EXERCITAT. III
That the end of Divinity here consists rather in practice than in
contemplation.

Luke. 11. 28. Blessed are they that hear the Word of God, and keep it.
THe end of our Divinity here consists in doing rather than contemplation. If
we speak properly, doing is not in the understanding but in the will; when
reason divides, compoundeth, or frames any proposition within it self, then
the understanding is not said The understanding is speculative, and sets the
will on work.
properly to do, but contenting it self within it self, then it is
speculative: but when the understanding sets the will on work, then the
will does, and the understanding but directs the will; and when the
understanding reasons within it self, they call this actus elicitus; Actus
elicitus. imperatus.


but when the understanding sets the will on work, they call this actus
imperatus.

A proposition in Divinity commands us either A proposition in Divinity
commands practice, virtually or formally.
virtually to practice, or else formally. Virtually it commands us to
practice; example, This is life eternal, to know thee to be the only true
God, and whom thou have sent, Christ, Ioh. 17. 3. 11. This is a proposition
which virtually includes in it practice; for as the Hebrews say, verba
notitiae includunt verba affectus, Words of knowledge include words of
affection: if it be life eternal for us to know God, then it is life eternal
also for us to love God.

This proposition again in Divinity, Thou shall love the Lord thy God with all
thine heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, Matthew. 22. 37. and
thy neighbor as thy self, verse. 39. commands practice formally.

Secondly a proposition in Divinity urges practice A proposition in Divinity,
commands practice, mediately or immediately,
either mediatly or immediately: imediatly, as God is summum bonum the chief
good; out of this mediate proposition we gather an immediate, therefore we are
to love him above all things.

Thirdly, these conclusions in Divinity which conclude for practice, the
propositions out of which they If the conclusions be practicke, the
propositions must be practicke.
are drawn, must also be for practice and not for contemplation, nam nihil
agit extra genus suum, as they say in the Schools; as we cannot gather grapes
of thorns, or figgs of thistels, Matthew. 7. 16. So new wine cannot be the cause
why the Apostles spoke with diverse tongues; Act. 2. So we cannot gather
conclusions of practice from speculative propositions.

Fourthly, these rules which serve to direct men to practice may be called
rules of practice, as the Carpenters The word of God is a line and rule of
practice.
line in his hand is a line of practice, because it leads him to practice. So
the Word of God is the line by the which we should walk, therefore it is a
rule of practice, Gal. 6. 6. As many as walk according to this rule, peace be
unto them: (...) is to work by rule or line, (...).
the Word is the rule of our working, therefore it teaches us practice.

But it may be said, that contemplation is the end of Divinity in heaven to see
God face to face, therefore is the end of our Divinity here upon earth.

Contemplation in heaven leads us always to practice, and they can never be
separate; for as below here inspectrices; as the mathematics, physic, and
such (whose end consists not in doing) are the parents of moral philosophy
and of doing, for by these we take up the nature of things, the goodness and
the truth of them, and then we begin to esteem of them, and love them when we
know them; so that contemplation brings forth always practice. The glorified
Saints in heaven, coming nearer to the first cause, esteem more highly of
him, and therefore they love him more sincerely, and return all praise to him.

But it may seem that contemplation is more excellent Mary is preferred unto
Martha, Mary for her contemplation to Martha for her action.

When Mary and Martha are compared together, they Mary cares for the
spiritual life, and Martha for the natural. Did not Mary care for practice as
well as Martha? sat she not at Christ's feet that she might learn practice,
that she might wash them with her tears and wipe them with her hair?

And because practice is joined always with knowledge, therefore the wisdom
which is proper to the understanding is ascribed sometimes to the will, Job.
28. 28. to depart from evil is understanding: and therefore it is, that
justice and judgment are joined together in the Scripture, and they are called
fools who do not according to their knowledge. And Solomon says Eccle. 10.
2. The heart of a wise man is at his right hand, because his heart teaches his
hand to put things in practice.

The end of our Divinity is more in practice than in contemplation; therefore
these onagri or wild asses, the Heremites who lived without all society of
men, forget the chief end wherefore they were set here, living rather like
beasts than like men: and if we shall take a view of the ecclesiastical
history, as out of Theodoret and Zozomen, we shall see how unprofitablie these
men have spent their time, leaving the congregation of the Saints of God.
Theodoret writes of one Macedonius Cap. 13. de historia religiosa. (...)
qui (...) and gubba dict us est; gubba in the Syriacke tongue is a Ditch, he
was called gubba because he stood in a Ditch all his time, and he was called
(...), because he eat nothing but Barley pulse: See how unprofitablie this man
spent his time, not giving himself to reading of the holy Scriptures, for he
was altogether ignorant of them; for when Flavianus the Bishop sent for him
that he might make him a Minister, he was so ignorant of that which the Bishop
had done unto him when he ordained him Minister, that being required the next
Sabbath day to come again to the Church, answered him who came for him, that
he was afraid to be made Minister the next Sabbath day also, and so refused to
come; see how this holy man spent his life for forty years in contemplatin and
what great progress he made in Christian Religion. So Theodoret makes mention
of one Styllites who From (...) a pillar.
stood under a pillar all his life time, and never came into a house. So
Zozomen in his ecclesiastical history, Lib. 6. 29.
writes of one Pior, who going out of his fathers house into a desert, vowed
solemnly that he should never see any of his kinsmen or friends again, and
living fifty years there he had a sister who longed to see him before she
dyed: the Bishop pitying the poor woman, granted leave to Pior to come and
visit her, and he returning into his country, and standing before the door
called out his sister, and shutting his eyes, he said unto her, behold, I am
your brother Pior, look upon me as much as you please; but she entreating
him earnestly to come to her house, he altogether refusing went back again to
the Wilderness: and so we read in Theodoret of one Adynus; who lived ninety
years in the In Sacra hist. lib. 14. 8.
Wilderness and never spoke to any man, as if he had been possessed with a
dumb Devil: this is that holy contemplative life which the Church of Rome
commends so much, but this is pure Religion, to visit the fatherless and
widow in their necessity, Iam. 1. 27. These Heremites living this
contemplative life were like Polyphemus having but one eye in his head, and
looking ever up but never down.

The Schoolmen differ but little in this point, how The opinion of the
Schoolmen in this point.
Divinity teaches us practice. Thomas and his followers say, that fides non
est recta ratio agendi, sed recta ratio sentiendi; and therefore Contra
gentiles he compares faith to hearing rather than to sight, but he adds
that practice follows faith as the fruit of it: but Scotus makes faith to be
habitus practicus. Ye see how both of them insist in this, that Divinity
consists in practice.

The Lord Number. 15. 38. 39. commanded the Israelites The end of the Sadduces and
Pharisees Divinity.
to make fringes upon the borders of their garments, that they might remember
the Commandments of the Lord and keep them; the Sadduces gave themselves
only to look upon the fringes, and if they had only remembered the Law, they
thought then they had discharged their duties; but the end of the Pharisees was
to remember their own traditions. So the end of The end of the Monks and
Jesuits Divinity.
the Monks Divinity now is only idle contemplation with the Sadduces; and the
end of the Jesuits Divinity now is only to practice mischief: and many
Christians when they read the Scriptures now, they read them not for
practice, but for to pass the time with; they are like little children who
seek Nuts to play, but not to break them and eat the kernels.

The conclusion of this is, Iam. 1. 22. Be ye doers of the word, and not
hearers only, deceiving your selves.

EXERCITAT. IIII.
Of Adams knowledge before his fall.

Genesis 2. 19. Whatsoever Adam called every living creature, that was the name of
it.
FIrst, consider in Adams knowledge, the manner how he got this knowledge, and
secondly the measure of his knowledge.

His knowledge was inbred knowledge and not acquired; for as soon as he did
behold the creatures, never Of the manner how Adam got his knowledge.
having seen them before, he gave them all names according to their nature.
This knowledge being inbred it could not be acquired also; nam duplex ejusdem
scientiae in vno subjecto, non datur causa, there cannot be two causes given of
one, and the self same knowledge in one subject, although one and the self
same knowledge cannot be said both to be acquired and inbred, Adams inbred
knowledge, and our acquired knowledge, are not diverse sorts of knowledge.
yet Adam might have had experimental knowledge, afterward of his inbred
knowledge: His inbred knowledge and our acquired knowledge, are not diverse
sorts of knowledge, for as the sight restored to the blind although it was
miraculous, yet when he saw, it was one sort of sight with our sight: so these
inbred habites and acquired habites, are but one sort of habits; but these
inbred habits in Adam, and infused habits, were more excellent than acquired
habits; for these things which God does, are such that nature cannot produce
the like, or so perfect: as that wine which Christ made miraculously at the
marriage of Cana in Galilee, Ioh. 2. Things done miraculously, are more
excellent than nature can produce them.
was more excellent wine than other natural wine: so when Christ cured the
blind, their sight was more perfect than our natural sight; so when he made
the lame to go Act. 3. 16. So the habites of inbred knowledge in Adam, were
more perfect than any other sinful man could ever attain unto, after him.

The creatures are less than the knowledge of God; Of the measure of Adams
knowledge.
they were equal with the knowledge of Adam before his fall, but they exceed
our knowledge now. When the eye looks upon the white color, it scatters
the exaequat visum, and it is a proportionable object for the eye: but when it
looks upon a taunie color, it is less than the sight. So the creatures are
less than Gods sight; they were equal with Adams sight before his fall, like
the green color, and they exceed our sight since the fall, as the white
color does exceed our sight; and because the heart since the fall is not so
capable and so large to comprehend the knowledge of these creatures as it was
before the fall, therefore it is said, 1 King. 4. 29. that the Lord gave Solomon
a wise heart as the sand of the Sea shore, that is, to know an innumerable
kind of things like the sand of the sea. When a man is to infuse liquor into a
Solomon that he might conceive this heavenly wisdom, and the knowledge of
all things; but the mind of Adam before his fall needed not this extention to
rcceive these gifts.

Secondly, the great measure of this knowledge which Adam had before his fall,
may be taken up this ways. The Hebrews write that there were four gates by
the which Adam entered to see the Lord: the first Porta creaturaru^ visibiliu^
intelligentiarum. majestatis. gloria.


was the gate of the visible creatures, the second was by the gate of the
Angels, the third was by the gate of majesty, and the fourth was by the gate
of glory; and they say that Adam entered three of these gates, but the fourth
was shut that he entered not in at it in this life.

The first gate was opened unto him, for in the creatures below, here he saw
the majesty and glory of God. The Scriptures when they express any great thing,
they join the name of God with it, as Ezekiel. 13. 9. great (...) est epitheton
omnis rei admirandae and magnae. (...)
hail is called Gods hail or sent by God, el gabbish. So 1 Samuel 26. cecidit
sopor domini super eos, that is, a great sleep fell upon them. So a strong
Lion is called ariel, the Lion of God, 2 Samuel 23. 10. So Moses is said to be
fair to God, that is, very fair, Act. 7. 20. So Ninive was great to God, that
is, very great. The beauty (...)
and greatness in the creatures led Adam to take up how great the Lord was.
Jacob when he saw Esau reconciled unto him, said, I have seen thy face, as
though I had seen the face of God, Genesis 33. 10. This glimpse of goodness in
the face of Esau, made Jacob take up, how good God was unto him.

The second gate was porta intelligentiarum, the knowledge of the Angels, they
resembled God more than any visible creature does, therefore they are called
Gods Sons, Job. 1. Chapt. and 38. Chapter, 7. verse, and they see his face
continually. Matthew 18. verse 10. As the Kings courtiours are said to see his
face continually, 2 King. 25. 25. and the Angels conversing with him, made him
to come nearer to the knowledge of God.

The third gate was porta Majestatis, he saw the majesty of God more clearly
than any other did. Moses is said to see the face of God, and yet it was but
the sight of his back parts, compared with Adams; and we see him but through a
grate, Cant. 2. 11. Heb. 11. 26.

The fourth gate was porta gloriae. That gate was reserved to be opened for
him in the heavens.

Let us compare the most excellent men with Adam, and see which of them came
nearest unto him; in some things Moses came nearest to him, in somes things
Solomon came nearest unto him, and in some things Daniel, in some things
Joseph, but Christ the second Adam excelled them in all.

In the knowledge and sight of God and his attributes, Moses came nearest to
him. Exodus 33. 13. Teach me thy A comparison betwixt Moses and Adam.
ways, that is, thy attributes. So Psalm. 103. 7. He made known to Moses his
ways, that is, his attributes, for he subjoyneth, the Lord is merciful and
gracious, slow to anger, and full of compassion, and he chideth not for ever;
here his ways are his attributes, Moses came nearest to Adam in this
knowledge.

Solomon in the knowledge of the politickes came nearer to Adams knowledge than
Moses did; Moses sat A comparison betwixt Solomon and Adam.
all the day long to judge the people, Exodus 18. and he stood in need of
Iethro's counsel to make choice of helpers; but Solomon could have found out
all these things by himself without the help of another. Solomon begged
wisdom of God, and it was granted unto him, he desired wisdom to be his
(...), to be president of his counsel, and to be his assister or (...), (...)
and to be his (...), to rule happily, Wisdom. 9. 4. Solomon came nearest to
the knowledge of Adam in the Politickes, and he is preferred to the wisest
within the Church, as to Heman and Dedan, 1 King. 4. 3. and to the wisest
without the Church, as to the Egyptians.

As he came nearest to Adams knowledge in the Politickes, Solomon came nearest
to Adams knowledge in the Politics.
so likewise in the knowledge of natural things, for as he wrote from the
Cedar of Lebanus to the Hyssope that grew out of the Wall, 2 King. 4. 33. that
is, as Josephus explaineth it; he wrote parables and similitudes taken from
every one of these kinds: and Tertullian says well, Familiare est sacris
scriptoribus ut sublimiores veritates explicent per sensibilia; nam idem qui
est author naturae, est author gratiae: It is an usual thing to the holy
writers to illustrate heavenly things by earthly comparisons, for he that is
the God of nature is also the God of grace. Solomon wrote from the tall Cedar
to the small Hyssope that grows out of the wall, that is, from the greatest
to the smallest, then he passes by none of them: for it is the manner of the
Hebrews to mark The Hebrews mark the two extremes and leave the midst for
brevity.
the two extremes, and to leave the midst for brevities cause, as Number. 6, 4,
from the kernel to the husk, here the Scripture omitteth the wine which is
the midst betwixt the kernel and the husk. Another example, Exodus 11. 5. And
all the first borne of the land of Egypt shall dye, from the first borne of
Pharaoh that sits upon the throne, unto the first borne of the maidservant
that sits behind the Mill. The Scripture omitteth the midst here, the rest
of the people for shortness, and expresses only the two extremes, the
highest and the lowest. A third example, Job 24. 20. The womb shall forget
him, and the worms shall feed sweetly upon him, the birth, and the grave, the
two extremes include the whole life. So Psalm. 121. 8. The Lord shall keep thy
going in, and going out, that is, all thy ways: So Solomon writing of the two
extremes, the tallest and the least, includes all the rest. Now if Solomon
had such knowledge of these natural things, much more had Adam.

Adam had such knowledge of the creatures that he Adam gave fit names to the
creatures, knowing their qualities and nature.
gave them fit names in the Hebrew expressing their natures, he was a good
nomenclator to give every thing the right name. Plato in Cratillo shows that
he who gives the right name to a thing, must know the nature of it very well;
but since the fall men impose wrong names to things, as they call light
darkness, and darkness light.

When he gave names to the creatures, he gave To what things Adam gave names
and to what he gave no names.
not names to these creatures in particular that had not principium
individuationis in se, and which differed not something in subsistence from
others, as all herbs of the same kind, and trees and stones of the same kind;
he gave not a name to every one of them in particular, but gave one name to
them all of the same kind: but these who differed not in essence but in the
manner of their subsisting, to these he gave diverse names, as he called
himself Adam and his wife Eve. And we are to observe that there are many
names which Adam Adam gave names to many things which are not found now in the
Scripture.
gave to the creatures in the first imposition, which are not found in the
Scriptures now: the Elephant the greatest beast upon the earth, yet it has no
proper name given to it, in the Scripture it is called Behemoth, Job 40. (...)
dens eboris compositum ex (...) dens and (...) ebur.
15. and the teeth of the Elephant are called Shenhabbim, the teeth of Ivorie,
but not the teeth of the Elephant; and usually the Scripture expresses only
the word teeth, as 1 King. 10. 18. he made a Throne of teeth, but not of the
teeth of the Elephant, because the Elephant was not so known to the Jews;
therefore the (...) cornua dentis. Ezekiel. 27.
Scripture does only circumscribe this beast and the horns of it; but Adam
gave the greatest beast a proper name when he imposed names to the beasts.

When Adam imposed names to the beasts, he imposed proper names to them, not
circumscribing them Adam gave proper namer to the creatures.
as the Scripture does now for our capacity; example, Shemamith with the hands
of it takes hold on kings houses, (...) Seems to be Simia, and Solomon sent
for such, 1 King. 10. 22. (...).
because this word is a hard word to be understood, and may signify either a
Spyder weaving with her hands; or else (...) a Monkie with a long tail (for
kings are delighted in their palaces with such when they see them hung by the
hands) because we cannot take up the nature of this beast by the name alone,
therefore the Scriptures by the effects and properties of it, describes it
more at large for our capacity; but Adam at the first imposed the simple name.

These names which Adam gave to the beasts at the Names which Adam gave were
perfect names.
first were most perfect names, therefore ye shall see other languages to
keep some footesteppe still of the first imposition, as 1 King. 10. 22.
Tukkijm are called (...)
Peacoks, the Talmud calls it Tabhas, the Arabic called it Taus, and the
Latin Pavo.

David came nearest to Adam in prudencie, for although A comparison betwixt

exceeded all the Tyrians: but yet if we will compare Daniels wisdom with the
wisdom of Solomon, it will come far short; for Solomon exceeded all the
children of the East in wisdom, and came nearest to Adams knowledge, no sort
of wisdom was hid from Solomon, Daniel only exceeded in interpreting of
secrets and heavenly visions.

EXERCITAT. V.
How the Law is said to be written in the heart of man after the fall.

Romans 2. 15. Which show the work of the Law written in the hearts.
FIrst, let us enquire how these first Principles which are called primo-prima,
are made up in the hearts of man. Secondly, how these secundo-prima principia
are deduced out of these. And thirdly, how these principia make up this which
we call Conscience: and lastly, we shall show that man by this natural
knowledge ingraft in his heart, cannot come to the true and saving knowledge of
God.

These first Principles are made up after this manner: The Lord has put two
faculties into the Soul, one which we call speculative in the understanding,
and another which we call a practik faculty in the will, to prosecute these
things which the understanding shows to her. God has placed first the
speculative in the understanding, that it might follow that eternal reason
that is in Gods Law; for as it is the perfection of Art to imitate nature, so
it is the perfection of nature to imitate this eternal reason, which is Gods
Law; Then he has placed the will into the soul of man to prosecute those
things, which the understanding the speculative faculty shows unto it.

There are some primo-prima principia, in the speculative Some principles in
the speculative, and some in the practicke faculty.
faculty, and some in the practick faculty; this is a principle in the
speculative faculty; Omne totum est majus sua part, and this is the first
principle in the practike faculty, the will, Matthew. 7. 12. Whatsoever ye would
that men should do to you, do ye even so to them.

These primo-prima principia are not naturally known How the first principles
are known.
quoad actum perfectum, but they are in potentia propinqua, that is, they may
be most easily known; for that which is actually perfect in the first degree,
is always known, and as soon as the creature existeth, so soon they are
known; as the knowledge of an Angel is not potentiall but ever actual: but
these first principles are made up without any reasoning discourse or foraigne
help. And as it is natural for a stone to move downward, although it be not
always moving downward, yet because it has that weight within it self, and
needs no other help to make it move downward, as it needs of a foraigne
help to cause it to ascend; therefore this motion is said to be natural to
it. So because How the first principles are natural to the mind.
the mind can make up these principles without any discourse; therefore they
are said to be natural to it: but when we make up a conclusion in a
syllogism, the knowledge of this conclusion is not so easily known to me: but
we must borrow some midsts, which are more known to us, to make up this
conclusion. These first principles are naturally known, but the conclusion in
the syllogism is rationaliter known only, by way of discourse. These first
principles the Divines First principles are naturally known, but the
conclusions are known by discourse.
call rations eternas, dignitates, immobilia principia, and the Greeks call
them (...). If the judgment be sound and well disposed, then it agrees to
those first principles; but if it be corrupt it declineth them. It is not
necessary that all agree in these first principles, for although some be found
who deny them, yet they stand as principles to those who are of sound
judgments; children and mad men understand not these first principles, yet
those who are of sound judgment, do acknowledge them.

These first principles are not actually written in the The first principles
are not actually, but potentially written in the mind.
heart of man, but potentially: the mind of man is not like a seminary, which
contains in it diverse sorts of seeds: neither is it like the Flintstone
which has the fire lurking within the veins of it, and being stricken upon
the steel, casts out the sparkels of fire which lurked in the veins of it
before: but it is like unto the eye, which being enlightened by the Sun, has
that natural faculty in it to discern colors: So the mind frames these
principles when the objects are laid before it. A difference between the first
inbred principles, and the second inbred principles.


And out of these primo-prima principia, the mind frames, and makes up
secundo-prima principia: the difference betwixt these primo-prima principia,
and secundo-prima is this: these primo-prima principia, first inbred principles
are contained in the conclusions; but these secundo-prima principia, these
second inbred principles, are as conclusions contained in the principles: now
to clear this by example; this is a first inbred principle in the mind;
whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them: this
is a second imbred principle drawn from the first, ye shall not murder; this
conclusion drawn from the first principle, contains in it this first
principle, whatsoever ye would men, etc. So that any man may infer thus; I
may not kill my neighbor, because I will that no man should kill me; here this
principle is contained in the conclusion. There are other conclusions drawn
from these secundo-prima principia, which may be called Difference between the
conclusions drawn from the first principles, and the conclusions drawn from
the second inbred principles.
tertiae conclusiones, and these are not so easily made up as the first; here
the conclusions are contained in the principles, and not the principles in the
conclusions as before; example, honor thy father, and thy mother; this is a
second principle; and this; thou shall rise up before the hoare head, Livit.
19. 23. is a conclusion of the third sort: for this follows not so clearly
as the former conclusion, Ye shall rise up before the hoare head; therefore
ye shall honor your father and your mother: but rather this ways, ye shall
honor your father and your mother; therefore ye shall rise up before the
hoare head: hear the conclusion is contained in the principle and not contra.

This law written in the heart of man, makes up this Conscience, what.
which we call conscience, which is an inbred light in the mind of man,
teaching him to follow that which is good, and to eschew that which is evil:
and it is called conscientia, quasi concludens scientia; and it has a twofold
A twofold act of the conscience.
Act; the first is to give testimony to things, whether we have done them well
or ill; if we have done them well, then it gives testimony for us, Romans 9. 1.

testifies against us. Gregory Nazianzen Greg. Nazain.
used to call the conscience paedagogum animae; for as a Pedagogue waits upon
a child, and commends him when he does well, and whippeth him when he does
evil; so the conscience when a man sins, it stingeth him like Hornets,
Deuteronomy. 7. 20. but when he does well, it allows him: and that which we call
conscience, the Syriack calls it Tira, Romans 2. 15. Which signifies (...)
conscientia a (...) formavit, pinxit.
a painted thing, for the conscience now is like a table, in which sundry
things are painted; and this sort of writing in the consciences, has not been
unfitly compared to that writing, which we write with the juice of an Onion;
here the letters at the first are not legible, sins in order before them,
Psalm. 50. 21. The second act of the conscience is to bind or loose; for even
as a man, when he is bound hand and foot, he cannot stir out of the place;
so the light which is in the conscience, binds the will of man, so to do a
thing; that he cannot do any other thing unless he sin against it. Romans 14.
23. Whatsoever is not of says is sin, that is, whatsoever he does against
his conscience, in that, he sins.

This conscience is either a good conscience, a bad conscience; a doubting
conscience, a probable conscience, or a scrupulous conscience. Conscientia
recta. erronea. dubia. probabilis. scrupulosa.




A good conscience is that, which is well informed, and concludes rightly.

A bad conscience is that, which is wrongly informed, and concludes falsely.

A doubtful conscience is that, which neither does assent nor dissent, and
therefore concludes nothing.

A probable conscience is that, which concludes as it thinks, upon probable
and good reasons.

And a scrupulous conscience is that, which concludes, but with some fear or
doubting, which troubles the mind. Let us take but this one example for all
in the case of eating of meat: The good conscience A difference between these
sorts of conscience.
says, To the pure all things are pure, and therefore I may eat of this
meat: the bad conscience of the Jew says, Touch not, taste not, handle not;
therefore I will eat none of this, because it is unclean. The doubtful
conscience doubts whether he may eat of it, Romans 14. 23. but does not fully
conclude with the Jew, that he may not eat of it. The probable conscience is
this, which upon probable grounds, concludes to eat of it. In Corinth some
doubted whether they might eat of flesh sold in the Shambles, 1 Cor. 10.
because perhaps they might light upon that in the Market, whereof the other
part was sacrificed to Idols; but the probable conscience concludes to eat of
it, because in the Shambles it has no relation to the Idol, and it knows,
by all probability, that the rest of it was not sacrificed to Idols, but that
the Priest got the rest for his portion; he sees others who are men of a good
conscience, eat of such; and upon these probable grounds he eats of it. The
scrupulous conscience is this which inclines to eat, but with fear and
grief to his mind, when he eats it.

the scrupulous conscience, and this doubtful conscience.

This bad conscience it excuses or accuses: it excuses When the bad
conscience excuses or accuses falsely.
an unregenerat man falsely, when he hears the curses of the Law, and blesses
himself in the meanetime, Deuteronomy. 29. 19. Ioh. 16. 2. Secondly, it excuses him
falsely, when he assenteth to the principles in general; but when he comes
to the particular application; he concludes not rightly. When the Husbandmen
killed the Lord of the Vineyard, Christ asked of the Jews, what should become
of these Husbandmen? Matthew. 21. 41. they answered, he will destroy these wicked
men: but Luke 20. 16. when they consider this, that the matter touched them
more nearely, then they said God forebid. The thing which they assented to in
the general, they shune it in particular, as if they should say, we are no
such men, and we hope that God will not so deal with us. So when it accuses
for the breach of any superstitious ceremony, as it did the superstitious
Philistims; if they did but tread upon the Threshold of the Door, where Dagon
break his neck, 1 Samuel 4. 5. So a bad conscience accuses a man truly
sometimes, as Eccles. 7. 22. for oftentimes also, thine own heart knows that
thou thy self have cursed others.

The conscience binds as the Lords deputy; the The conscience is Gods
herald.
conscience may be compared to the Kings Herald. The Herald intimates to the
Subjects the Kings laws; When they are intimated, the Subjects are bound to
obedience: but if the Herald should make intimation, of that which were not
the Kings Law, unto the Subjects; yet they are to give obedience to it, until
they know the contrary: so a man is bound to obey his conscience, that is, to
do nothing contrary to it, although it intimate a falsehood unto him.

How can an evil conscience bind a man to that which is evil; it being Gods
Deputy, and God can bind no man to do evil?

It binds him not simply to do the evil, but it binds

So out of these principles naturally bred in the heart, A difference between
the law of nature and the laws of nations.
arise all these laws which are written in the heart; and they differ from the
laws of nations, or municipall laws of countries. Esaias 24. 5. says, they
have transgressed the laws, changed the ordinances and broken the everlasting
covenant: they have transgressed the Laws, that is, the municipall Laws of
the commonwealth: they have changed the ordinances: that is, these things
wherein all nations agree; as not to do wrong to strangers, to ambassadors
and such: and then he comes to the greatest of all; they have broken the
everlasting covenant; A greater sin to break the law of nature than the law
of nations.
that is, the law of nature: it is less to break a municipall law, than the
law of nations; or it is less to transgress the law of nations, than to
violate the Law of nature; for this Law is that: light which lightneth every
man, that comes into the world, Ioh. 1. 9.

A man by this natural knowledge, cannot be brought Natural light cannot
bring a man to the knowledge of his own salvation.
to the knowledge of his salvattion; therefore the Law must be written anew
again in his heart. It is a strange position of Clemens Alexandrinus, who
holds that there was alia justitia secundum legem naturae, alia secundum
legem Mosis, et alia secundum Christum; and he calls these two first (...),
or degrees to lead to Strom. cap. 6. 7.
Christ; and as the Law led the Jews to Christ, so did philosophy lead the
Greeks; and hence he concludes, that the good men amongst the Heathen were
saved, or at least had some steps to salvation.

The conclusion of this is, seeing the conscience is so

EXERCITAT. VI.
Of the seven Precepts given to Noah.

Act. 15. 20. We write unto them that they abstain from things strangled, and
from blood.
BEfore the Law was written, the Hebrews say, that the Lord gave to Noah seven
Precepts, which were delivered of Noah by tradition to his posterity after him;
these the Jews call pirke abhoth, capitula patrum, (...)
the traditions of the fathers. The most ancient and first tradition that we
read of, was that, Genesis 32. 32. because Jacob halted upon his thigh, therefore
the children of Israel eat not of the sinew wbich shranke, which is upon the
hollow of the thigh unto this day; So were these seven precepts delivered by
tradition.

The first was against strange worship or idolatry, 1 (...)
that they should not worship false gods; and this they 2 (...)
called gnabhuda zara, strange worship. The second they called it gnal birkath
hashem, that is, they should bless 3 (...)
the name of God. The third was gnal shepukoth dan^mim, that is, he was
forbidden to shed innocent blood. 4 (...)
The fourth was gnalui gniria, that is, he should not defile 5 (...)
himself with filthy Insts. The fifth was gnad hagazael, de rapina; that he
should take nothing by violence or 6 (...)
theft. The sixth was, gnal hadinim de judiciis. The seventh was, abhar min
achai, ne menbrum de vivo; that 7 (...)
he should not pull a member from a living creature, and eat of it. This
precept they say, was given last to Noah, Genesis 9. 4. but the flesh with the
life thereof, which is the blood thereof, shall ye not eat: that is, (as the
Jews How this precept of Noah not to eat blood is to be understood.
interpret it) ye shall not pull a member from a living creature, and eat of
it, as the wild beast does; but to stay until the beast be killed, and then
eat the flesh thereof: neither shall ye eat the blood while it is hot, as if
it were yet in the body: this is cruelty, and against a moral precept; to eat
hot blood while the life is in it; for where the reason of the Law is
perpetual, the Law must Where the reason of the Law is perpetual, the Law is
perpetual.
be perpetual. The reason of the Law is; ye shall not eat blood because the
life is in it; so long as the life is in it, ye must not eat it: and see how
this sin, Ezekiel. 33. 35. is matched with other great sins. Ye eat with the
blood, and lift up your eyes toward your Idols, and shed blood, and shall ye
possess the land? The moral transgressions of the Law joined with it here,
shows that it is cruelty to eat hot blood. But Levit. 7. 27. was the
ceremonial part of the Law: and the Apostles in the council, Act. 15.
forbids them to eat any thing that was strangled; whereby they meant the
ceremonial part of the Law.

Whether are we to take these precepts as ceremonial or as morrall?

The most of these are morrall precepts, and the Act. 15. It is the same that
is forbidden in the fourth See Beza, Act. 15.
precept given to Noah, not revelare turpitudinem, and to interpret here,
fornication, for eating of things sacrificed to Idols, seems to be a strained
sense: for that is forbidden already by the first precept, to Noah. And to
uncover the nakedness according to the phrase of the Scripture, is meant of
bodily pollution and not of spiritual fornication.

Now besides these morrall precepts set down by Of eating of blood, see more
in the appendix of Command. 6.
the council; they interlace this ceremonial precept de suffocato, forbidding
to eat things strangled; and they give the reason wherefore the Gentiles
should abstain from these, Act. 15. 21. For Moses is read in their Synagogues
every Sabbath, as if James should say, they Why the Apostles forbid to eat
blood or things strangled.
profess not only the morrall Law, but also the ceremonial Law yet;
therefore ye Gentiles shall do well to abstain, from these things which may
give them offense. The Jews respected these precepts most, because they were
kept in the Church even from Noah's days.

The Hebrews add further; that there was no other precept given until
Abraham's days; then God added the precept of circumcision, and afterward
taught them to separate tithes.

The Lord taught his Church in her infancy this God at the beginning taught
his Church by tradition and not by write.
ways by traditions, and not be write: and even as parents teach their
children the first elements by word,

The conclusion of this is. The Lord never left his Church without his word to
direct her: before the fall, he spoke immediately to Adam and Eve, and taught
them. In the second period, he taught them by these seven precepts. In the
third period, by the Law written, and in the fourth period by the Gospel.

EXERCITAT. VII.
Of the diverse ways how God revealed himself extraordinarily to his Church.

Heb. 1. 1. God who at sundry times, and in diverse manners spoke in times past
unto the Fathers by the Prophets.
GOd manifested himself to his Church; first by prophecy, secondly, by the
holy Spirit, thirdly by God revealed himself to his Church four ways.
Vrim and Thummim, and fourthly by the poole Bethesda.

First by prophecy. There were sundry sorts of prophecy: Sundry sorts of
prophecy. (...)
the first was lepi face to face, to Moses only.

This sort of prophecy was the highest degree of revelation; and it drew
nearest to that sort of vision, which we shall get of God in the heavens. He
manifested himself to Moses face to face, and he knew How the Lord
manifested himself to Moses.
him by his name, that is, not only by the face, as Princes know many of their
Subjects; but he knew him inwardly, and liked him: this was notitia
approbationis.

Moses saw God face to face, yet he saw not the essence of God, for he
dwells in a light inaccessable. John saw Christ (...).
John saw God three manner of ways. First, in his incarnation, he saw God
dwelling amongst men in the flesh here. Secondly, in his transfiguration upon
the Mount. Thirdly, in the Spirit upon the Lords day, Rev. 1. 10. Although John
lay in the bosom of Christ and was his beloved Disciple, yet he says, No man
has seen God at any time: the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of
the Father he has declared him. Ioh. 1. 18.

When God spoke to Moses, he spoke to his underderstanding Differences betwixt
the revelations made to Moses, and to the rest of the Prophets.
immediately. A man has a right ear, and a left ear; the understanding is
like the right ear and the fantasy is like the left ear: he spoke to
Moses Moses saw no visible shapes nor forms, except only in the entry of
his calling, when he saw the bush burning, Exodus 3. 6. and the Angel coming
to kill him in the Inn, Exodus 4. 24. and when he saw the pattern of the
Tabernacle in the Mount, Heb. 9. but usually God manifested himself to his
understanding.

Secondly, the other Prophets were astonished and weakened at the sight of God.
Dan. 8. 27. and I Daniel fainted and was sick certain days, and I was
astonished at the visions. So Ezekiel fell upon his face when the Lord revealed
himself unto him. Chap. 3. 27. But Moses was never affrayd at the sight of
God but thrice. First when he was to enter in his calling when he saw the bush
burning. Exodus 3. 2. Secondly, at the giving of the Law, Heb. 12. 21. Thirdly,
in the Inn.

Thirdly, Moses needed not such preparations before he prophesied, as some of
the other Prophets did. Elisha King. 3. 15. But Moses needed not such a
preperation. So Paul when he was ravished to the third heaven, this knowledge
which he got, was intellectual, and it was neither by the sight, nor by the
fantasy: and whether the soul was in the body here tanquam in organo, vel
tanquam in sede only, it may be See Iunius de purgatory.
doubted.

The second sort of prophecy, was by vision; as when Moses saw the bush
burning, this was presented to him when he a was awake; this was the meanest
sort of revelation, (...).

The third sort was (...), when something Visio (...). (...)


was presented to their fantasy in a dream.

These visions which he show to the Prophets, sometimes they were of things
which really existed; as Zachary saw Iosuah the high Priest, and Satan
standing at his right hand. Zach. 3. Sometimes of things that might be and was
not: as Zachary saw two women carrying an Ephath, Zach. 5. 5. and sometimes of
things that were not, nor never could be: as the monstrous beasts shown to
Daniel, and to John in the revelation.

When the Lord revealed himself to the Prophets The Lord appeared to his
Prophets, sometimes immediately, and sometimes by an Angel.
in these visions: sometimes he spoke mediatly to them by an Angel. As Exodus 3.
2. God is said there to appear to Moses; but Act. 7. 30. an Angel is said to
appear in the burning bush. Sometimes again in these apparitions, he
immediately appeared to the Prophets. Ioh. 12. 40. He blinded their eyes, etc.
these things he said when he saw his glory, that is, when he saw Christ's
glory.

When the Angels did appear to the Prophets in these visions, they appeared in
the shapes of men, but The Angels ever appeared in the likeness of men, but
not in the likeness of women or beasts
they never appeared in the likeness of women, far less in the likeness of
beasts, as the Devil does: therefore Levit. 17. 7. they shall no more offer
their sacrifices unto Devils, in the Hebrew it is, leshegnirem, to the hoarie
(...)
ones; because the Devil appeared in these shapes. When the Cherubims appeared
they carry the face of a man, the crest of a Lion, the feet of the Ox, and
the wings of an Eagle; they had not four faces (as some think) but in
something they represented man, in someting the Lion, in something the Ox, and
in something the Eagle: panim here should be translated, (...). (...) When the
Angels appeared in the likeness of man, they were more glorious than any man.


When the Angels appeared to the Prophets, there was more glory in them, then
in other men; although sometimes they concealed this glory for a while, as may
be seen Genesis 18. comparing it with Heb. 13. 2. When Paul saw an Angel
standing by him in the likeness of a man of Mecadonia; there was more glory in
him, than in all the men of Mecadonia, Act. 16. 9, Because the glory of an
Angel did shine in him: and in this sense it is said, Act. 6. 15. that they
saw the face of Steven as it had been the face of an Angel, that is, his face
did shine above the face of mortal men, as when the Angels appeared in humane
shape. But when the Lord appeared in the likeness of a man, then his glory
far exceeded the glory of an Angel, Esa. 6. 1. I When the Lord appeared in
the likeness of man, he exceeded the glory of an Angel.
saw the Lord sitting upon a throne. First, he was set upon a high throne.
Secondly, his clothes reached down to the ground, which signifies his glory*
the hemme of his garment touched the ground, which signyfied the humanity of
Christ: and the Seraphims covering their faces, because they could not behold
the glory of God. And when the Lord appeared in these visions, he appeared in
the likeness of an old man: as Daniel saw the Ancient of days sitting upon a
throne, Dan. 7. 9. and Reve. 1. 14. when the Son of God appeared, his hair
was white as wool, and white as Snow: but the Angels of the Lord appeared in
the likeness of young men, Mark. 16. 5. and the Cherubims were made like young
men.

Which of the Prophets saw the most excellent visions.

Ezekiel saw the most excellent visions. Esaias saw the Ezekiels visions for the
most part were of Christ: and the spiritual Temple.
Lord sitting upon a throne, Esa. 6. 1. but this was a vision of judgment, to
make fat the hearts of the people: but the visions of Ezekiel for the most part
were of ante annum sacerdotalem, that is, before they were thirty years of age.

and therefore the Prophets were called videntes, Seers, Job. 13. 1. mine eyes

all. Pharaoh did not understand these things which he saw; therefore he was not
a Prophet: So Belthasser when he saw fingers writing upon the wall, he undernot
that which he saw, and therefore he was not a Prophet: and so Caiphas
understood not what he prophesied. Ioh. 11. They were like unto men who are
purblind and see not a thing distinctly: and therefore desires others to tell
them more distinctly what it is. The Jews say of these, that they were (...)
non (...), that is, (...)
they were stirred up by God, but they sought not the Lord. And of Balaam they
say, prophetavit ex voluntate Dei, sed non cepit quod prophetavit. Daniel at
the first understood not the prophecy, but the Angel revealed it unto him,
Dan. 8. 17.

So the Lord appeared to them in Dreams as he did before to them when they
were awake, and sometimes these dreams were (...), dreams in which they saw
some shapes and visions; as Jacob saw a ladder in his dream: so Abraham in his
dream, saw the Carkases, and fowls lighting upon them. Genesis 15. 8. Daniel saw
the four monarchies, represented befoure visible shapes, Dan. 4. and sometimes
he revealed himself sine symbolo, without any visible shape; as to Joseph,
Matt. 2. and to the wise men, Mat* 2. 12.

The Lord was only author of these dreams, therefore. (...)
Genesis 37. 7. when Joseph is called bagnal chalamoth, it is not well translated

number. If the Lord revealed himself in the forepart of the night as he did
to Abraham, then it was called Tardema, a dead sleep, 1 Samuel 26. cecidit sopor
domini super eos id est magnus. But (...)
if in the latter part of the night, then it was called chalam, a dream. To
some he revealed himself in a dream, but he gave then not the interpretation
of it, as to the Butler and Baker. Some had the interpretation of the dream,
but not the dream, as Joseph. Nebuch^dnezzer had the dream, but Daniel the
interpretation of it, but the Prophets of God: had both the dream and the
interpretation of it, as Daniel. The heathen sometimes had both the dream and
the interpretation, The Prophets had the dreams with the interpretations of
them.
as the Midianites had of the Barley cake. Iud. 7. but this was for their
destruction: but the comfortable dreams and visions, with their
interpretations; were only revealed to the Prophets, for the good of the
Church.

Whether was the revelations by dreams, or by visions the more perfect
revelation?

Intensive the revelation by vision was the more excellent, but extensive the
revelation by dreams was the Revelatio intensiva. extensiva.


more excellent, and that by vision came nearest to that which was
intellectual, for they had no use of their senses in it, and the visions were
presented to their understanding only. When we take up a thing by sense; first
Somethings are presented to the sense, somethings to the fantasy, and some
things to the understanding.
the sense transmiteth it to the fantasy, and then the fantasy sends it
to the understanding; this is the most imperfect sort of knowledge. Secondly,
when the vision is presented to the fantasy only, and the fantasy sends
it to the understanding, this is more perfect then the former. And thirdly,
when the vision is presented to the understanding only, this is a higher
degree.

In the Knowledge which they got by dreams, first, they had the dream, and
when they were awake they got the understanding of it: but in a vision they
presently understood the thing presented unto them. Because the revelation by
vision was the more perfect sort of knowledge, therefore Joel says your young
men shall see visions, and then he added, your old men shall dream dreams, as
the more imperfect sort of revelation, Joel. 2. 28.

It may be asked why God revealed himself this way

to try them by reason, and if reason approve them not then we reject them, but
in a dream the mind receives

The second reason why he taught his Prophets by dreams was this, to let them
see how far his power exceeded the power of man; for masters cannot teach
scholars; but when they are awake and giving heed: but God can teach his
Prophets in a deep sleep and in a dream: which gave the Prophets to
understand what great commandment, the Lord had over all the faculties of
their minds.

all the use of their senses; hearing one speaking to them, as we do every one
another, and seeing, etc. and the more use that they have of their senses, the
more unperfect was their revelation. Drusius in Pentateuchum.
Others distinguish this sort of revelation which was by the holy Spirit, from
that which was properly called prophecy: they say these who spoke by the holy
spirit, and were Prophets in that sense, they were not called to attend still
as Prophets; such as was David a King; and Daniel a Courtiour: But Esaias and
Jeremy were Prophets properly so called: because they waited still, and
attended in the school of the Prophets.

that the twelve precious stones set in the brestplate, were called vrim and

the vrim and the thummim are distinguished verse. 30. Some of the Jews again
incline most to this sense; that these two words vrim and Thummim were set in

It is commonly holden that the letters did shine out of the breastplate of
Aaron, when the Lord gave his answers to him, that he might read the answer by
the letters: but this could not be, as may appear by the form of the
brestplate following.

The form of the Breast Plate.

When David asked of the Lord, 1 Samuel 23. 12. will the men of Keila deliver me
and my men into the hands of Saul? (...)
the Lord said ijsgiru, they will deliver thee: here the letters in the
brestplate would have made up this whole answer; Iod from Iehuda, Samech from
Joseph, Gimel from Gad, Iod from Levi, Resh from Reuben, and Vau from Reuben,
but Judges 20. 8. when the Israelites asked counsel of the Lord, who shall go
up first to battle against Benjaman? it was answered, Iehuda Battechilla, (...)
Judah shall go up first, now there was not so many letters in the brestplate

letters in the Breastplate.
the Lord, shall I go up against the Philistimes? the Lord answered, Thou
shall not go up but fetch a compass behind them and come upon them over
against the Mulberry trees. The letters in the brestplate could not express
all this, therefore it was not by the letters that the Lord answered the
Priest: but when he had on this brestplate, (...), or rationale upon him, then

him what to answer; and this brestplate was but a sign unto him, that the
Lord would answer him, as Sampsons hair was a sign unto him, that the Lord
would continue his strength with him as long as he kept his hair; how was the
strength in Sampsons hair? not as in the cause, or in the subject, but only
as in the sign, so in the Apostles garments and shadow; they The Vrim and
Thummim were a sign only that the Lord would answer the Priest.
were but a sign of their power which they had in healing miraculously; and so
was vrim and thummim but a sign of this, that the Lord would answer the Priest.

The vrim and thummim were not always with the The Vrim and Thummim were not
ever with the Arc.
Arc; for all the time of Saul they asked not counsel of the Arc, 1 Chronicles.
13. 3. Let us bring again the Arc of our God unto us: for we enquired not at
it, in the days of Saul; they went usually to ask counsel in the Tabernacle
and Sanctuary of the Lord, Iud. 20. they went up to Silo, where the Tabernacle
was, to ask the Lord then the Arc was in the Tabernacle: but when the Arc
was separated from the Tabernacle, they might sacrifice in the Tabernacle. So
they might ask the Lord here by vrim and thummim although the Arc was not
there. When the Highpriest asked counsel for David, at Nob: the Arc was not
there nor the Tabernacle; but only vrim and thummim: but when the Arc and the
vrim and thummim were together, they always enquired the Lord before the Arc;
and when they were separated; they turned their faces toward the Arc,
wheresoever it was, when they asked counsel by the judgment of vrim and
thummim. When David was in Ziglaeg, 1 Samuel 30. he asked counsel of the Lord by
the Priest: but neither the Arc nor the Tabernacle was ever in Ziglag a town
of the Philistims.

When any are said, to ask counsel of the Lord, They asked counsel of the
Lord at the Arc by the High Priest.
who were not Highpriests; as the Israelites are said thrice to ask the Lord.
Iud. 20. 18. 1 Samuel 14. 37. and 23. 2. 1 Chronicles. 14. they are understood to have
done this by the Highpriest, for Number. 27. 21. Joshua is commanded to ask

the Lord. Number. 27. 21. he stood not directly before the Highpriest, for then he
should have stood betwixt him and the Arc: therefore liphne should be

When two things are demanded of the Lord, he answered The Lord by Vrim and

in order to them. As 1 Samuel 23. 9. will they come up? The Lord answered, they
will come up. So he answered to the second question, will they deliver me? They
will deliver thee.

They asked not counsel of the Lord by Vrim and Thummim but in great and
weighty matters; as David They asked counsel by Vrim and Thummim only in
matters of weight.
after the death of Saul, 1 Samuel 2. So 2 Samuel 5. they asked the Lord, for the
King, for the common wealth or for a tribe, or for making of wars, but in
matters of less moment they asked not the Lord, by Vrim and Thummim: as if any
thing had been committed to ones custody, and it was lost; they did not ask
the Lord for it by Vrim and Thummim, but the oath of the Lord was betwixt them,
Exodus 22. 11.

When they got their answers by Vrim and Thummim, God confirmed his answers
sometimes by lot.
the Lord confirmed their answers sometimes by lot. As 1 Samuel 10. 8. he asked
first by Vrim and Thummim, who should be King? and then it was confirmed by
lot. So when Joshua divided the Land, First, he got his answer by Vrim and
Thummim, and then he bids them cast lots, and as their lots ascended, he
distributed unto them, Number. 26. 55. When the Highpriest consulted, he stretched
out his hands unto the Ark of the Lord. 1 Samuel 14. 19. collige manum tuam,
draw in thine hand.

The difference betwixt the predictions of the Prophets A difference between
the predictions of the Priests by Vrim and Thumim, and the predictions of the
Prophets.
and the Priest, by Vrim and Thummim was this. The Prophets when they foretold
things, vt futura in seipsis, as to fall out in themselves; then they always
fell out: but when they foretold things as they were in their causes; then they
might fall out, or not fall out. Example, Esaias says to Ezekias, set thy house
in order for thou shall dye, and not live, Esaias. 38. 1. looking to the second
Prophesies as the respect the second causes and events.
causes, and to Ezekias, he shall dye. But looking to the event, he shall not
dye. So 1 King. 21. 20. The Lord threatened to bring a judgment upon Achab, and
yet upon his humiliation spared him. So the Lord threatened ^ve, forty days and
Ninive shall be destroyed, Jonah. 3. 4. and yet when they humbled themselves
they were not destroyed. But that which was revealed by the Highpriest, when he
took on Vrim and Thummim, took always effect.

But it may be said, Iud. 20. 23. shall I go up to the battle against the
children of Benjamin our brother? The Lord answered, go up against him. And
yet they were killed.

In this first answer the Lord shows, that they had Benjamin; but he an
swered not to the success of the battle, because they were not as yet
humbled; and they trusted too much to their own strength. But when Phineas
demanded what they should do, verse. 28. when they were humbled: they got a
direct and more distinct answer: go up, for to morrow I will deliver them into
thine hand.

Bellermine the Jesuit, that he may prove the infallibility De pont, Romans lib.
4. 3.
of the Pope in judgeing in matters of faith; alleges the Vrim and the
Thummim, which were upon the brestplate of the Highpriest; which directed him
(...) a radice, (...) a false derivation.
that he could not err in judgment. But this reason is faulty many ways.
First, in the derivation of the names; for he deriveth Vrim from the root jara
which (...) a radice, (...) a false derivation to exclude the radical letter,
for there is duplex Mem, here and Aleph is excluded. (...).
signifies, to teach; whereas it is derived from or to give light. So he
deriveth thummim from the root A man, which signifies to believe; whereas it
comes from tamam, to make a thing perfect. The seventie translate these
words, (...), as ye would say, manifestatio and veritas. And so does Hierome.
But this they do (...), and they respect more the end here, wherefore they
were put into the brestplate, than their proper significations. For as Vrim
properly signifies brightness, and figuratively (...), because that which
makes all things manifest is the light, Ephesians. 5. 13. and this Thummim
properly signifies perfection; so figuratively in things spiritual, it
signifies verity. The Seventy looking to the figurative signification,
translate them this ways.

Secondly, put the case that Vrim and Thummim signified doctrine and verity,
yet it will not follow that the Highpriest might not err: for by these were
signified not what sort of men they were, but what sort of men they ought to
be. Prove. 16. 10. A divine sentence is in the lips of the King, and his mouth
transgresses not in judgment. Here is a clearer place that the King of Spain
cannot err in judgment, than that the Pope cannot err in judgment; if ye
will take words as they stand. But the meaning of the words is, a divine
sentance ought to be in the lips of the King; and then his mouth will not
transgress in judgment. So these two are set in the brestplate of Aaron, to
teach him his duty: but they were not notes of his infallibility. And if by
Vrim, they would infer his infallibility in judgment: so by Thimmim, they
may infer his holiness of life: and so none of the Popes were profane and
wicked men.

Thirdly, this brestplate served not for a trial of his doctrine, but only
for foretelling of the doubtful events of things; for their doctrine was to be
tried by the law and by the testimony, Esa. 8.

Fourthly, if Vrim and Thummim signified verity and The High priests might err.
judgment, then it should follow, that none of the Highpriests could err: but
we know that Vrijah the Highpriest in the time of Achaz, brought the pattern
of the Altar of Damascus, and placed it in Jerusalem. 2 King. 16. 6. And
Caaiphas erred, when he condemned Christ to death.

Lastly, let this be granted, that the Highpriest under the law could not err;
therefore that either Peter or the Pope his successor (as they allege) could
not err, it will not follow. For this privilege, not to err, belongs to
none, but to Jesus Christ, of whom the Highpriest was a type; who had both Vrim
and Thummim, purity of doctrine and perfection of life.

How long did the gift of prophecy endure in the second

The gift of prophecy endured under the old Testament How long the gift of
prophecy endured under the old Testament.
Alexander the great did reign, Nehemiah makes mention of one Iaddus the
Highpriest, Neh. 12. 7. who met Alexander, when he came against Jerusalem. Now
See Shinlerus in (...)
if there had been none, who were infallibly directed by the Spirit of God at
this time; who could have put this into the canonical Scripture it being
historical? therefore there behoved to be one at this time, who had the spirit
of prophecy, and was one of the masters of the great Synagogue, who did this:
and then the Sun went down upon the Prophets. Micah. 3. and the gift of
prophecy ceased.

Thse gift of prophecy was bestowed anew again, in The gift of Prophecy
given under the new Testament,
the second Temple, under the new Testament. Joel. 2. I will power out my
spirit upon all flesh, and your young men shall see visions, etc.

This gift lasted in the Church, till the second Temple was destroyed. The
Jews by a certain kind of Kabbala called gematrja, observe upon Hagg. 1. 8.
it is (...)
written there ekkabhda, I will be glorified, because the word wants the
letter (...) in the end of it, which letter stands for five; they say that
the want of this (...), shows the want of five things in the second Temple,
which were in the first. The Arc, the mercy seat, and Cherubims. Secondly,
the fire from Heaven. Thirdly, the majesty of Divine presence called shekena.
Fourthly, the holy Ghost. And fifthly, Vrim and Thummim. But this rabbinicall
observation is most impious, and serves The Jews cabbalisticall observation
blasphemous.
to overthrow all the whole New Testament, to deny Jesus Christ, and to
condemn his Apostles and Evangelists; as though they had not the gift of the
holy Spirit when they wrote, during the time of the second Temple: and this is
contrary to the very scope of the Prophet, Hagg. 1. 8. Go up into the
mountain, and bring wood to build this house, and I will take pleasure in it,
and I will be glorified says the Lord, and Hagg. 2. 9. The glory of the latter
house shall be greater then the former, and in this place will I give peace
says the Lord.

Whether were the Arc, the Vrim and Thummim, and

Although there was greater spiritual beauty in the The Arc was not in the
second Temple.
wanted this typical Arc, the Vrim and Thummim, and the fire; therefore it is
but a fable of theirs, who Josephus ant. lib. 14.
say, that Titus after he had destroyed the second Temple, brought the Arc to
Rome in his triumphs; but the Arc was never seen in the second Temple; and
Josephus, who was an eye witness of Titus triumphs shows, that it was only
but the table of the shewbread which Titus carried away in his triumphs, and
is seen yet pictured there.

The Vrim and Thummim were not in the second Temple, but the graces signified
by them.

But it may be said. Nehem. 7. 65. and Ezra. 2. 63. That they should not eat
of the most holy things, until there stood up a Priest with Vrim and with
Thummim.

It is the manner of the Scriptures to express the nature The new Testament
expresses things sometimes under types of the old Testament.
and types which were under the Old Testament: so by Vrim and Thummim which
were in the first Temple; to express the perfection of the Priests, which
should be in the second Temple.

The last way, how God revealed himself in the second How the Lord revealed
himself by the poole Bethesda.
Temple, was by the poole Bethesda: when the Angel came down at certain times
to stir the poole, then whosoever after the first troubling of the water
stepped in, he was cured of whatsoever disease. Ioh. 5. 4. It was not the
Angel that cured them here: for it is a true Axiom of the Schoolmen, pars
nature a non potest super are naturam, An Angel cannot work a Miracle.
an Angel is but a part of nature, therefore he cannot work a miracle, which
is above nature. It was Christ himself who wrought the miracle, it was he
What Angel wrought this Miracle. (...)
who loosed the prisoners, Psalm. 146. Mattir, is so to loose the bound, that
they have use both of their hands and feet, to leap as freely as the
Grasshopper does, which has legs to leap upon the earth, Levit. 11. 21. So
the diseased were loosed, that they might leap and go straight upon their
own feet. By Angel here some understand the power of God, who uses his
Angels, as his ministers to work many things below here; and therefore the
Seventy put God in place of the Angel, as Eccles. 5. 6. Say not before the
Angel, that it was an error. But the Seventy translate it (...), for the
Chaldes use to ascribe the work of God to his ministers, the Angels. But it is
better to ascribe this miracle here, to the Angel of the covenant Jesus
Christ. Tertullian says, that the operation of the fishpoole being now to
cease and to loose the virtue of it, our Savior curing him who had been long
diseased, being at the poole, gave thereby an entrance to all sick persons to
come unto him: as if he should have said, he that desires to be whole; let him
not come to the poole, or expect the coming down of the Angel: for when he
comes, he heals but one; but come unto me, and I shall heal you all.

The conclusion of this is, seeing we have a more He that despised Moses law,
Heb. 10. 28. dyed without mercy, under two or three witnesses, of how much
sorer punishment shall we be thought worthy of, if we tread under foot the
Son of God.

EXERCITAT. VIII.
Of the necessity of the Word written.

Ioh. 20. 31. But these are written that ye might believe.
GOd thought it necessary, after that he had taught his Church by Word; next to
teach her by write. There is a twofold necessity. The first is called an
absolute necessity: the second, of expedience. Again, Necessitas absoluta
expedientia


Gods revealed will was necessary to all men, as a cause; but his written word
was necessary as an isntrumental Scriptura est necessaria (...) verbnm (...).
The word considered essentially or accidentally.
cause; and this word is considered either essentially, or accidentally.
Essentially for the written word: this written, and unwritten word, differ
only as a man naked, and clothed; for there is no change in the nature The
estate of the Church considered three ways.
she was in a family or oeconomike. Secondly, she was National, dispersed
through the country of the Jews. Thirdly, she was Ecomenicall or Catholic,
dispersed through the whole world. So long as she was in a family, and the
Patriarchs lived long, to record to the posterity, the word and the works of
God; then God taught his Church by his word unwritten. But when his Church
began to be enlarged, first through Judea, and then through the whole world,
then he would have his word set down in write; because then the Fathers Why
God would have his word written.
were not of so long a life, to record to the posterity, the word and the
works of God. Again he did this to obviat the craft of the Devil, and the
counterfeite writings of the false Apostles.

It was necessary then, that the word should be written, God reveals himself
most surely to us by his word.
that the Church might have a greater certainety of their salvation. See how
far the Lord commends unto us, the certainety which we have by the
Scriptures; above all other sort of revelation. 2 Pet. 1-19. We have also a
more sure word of prophecy: here the (...).
certainety of the Scriptures, is preferred to the transfiguration in the
mount. Secondly, the Apostle Gal. 1. 8. prefers it to the revelation made by
Angels, If an Angel should come from heaven and teach any other Gospel, let
him be accursed. Thirdly, Christ himself preferred the certainety of it to
Moses and the Prophets. If one should come from the dead and teach us. Luke
16. 31.

The Church of Rome then does great wrong to Christians; The Church is not the
last resolution of our faith.
when they would make the last ground and stay of Christian faith, to be the
Church only; But we are built upon the foundation of the Prophets, and
Apostles, Ephe. 2. 20. the Lord when he dwelt between the Cherubims, he set
the Candlestick upon his right hand, and the table with the shewbread upon his
left hand: to teach us, that the Scriptures are to be preferred still to the
testimony of the Church; and that we must rest upon their testimony primario.

Whether is it an Article of our faith, to believe that

Some things are both de fide, and de verbo fidei; as Emmanuel. Secondly,
somethings are de verbo Somethings de fide and de verbo fidej, somethings de
verbo fidej, but not de fide primario, somethings neither de fide neither de
verbo fidej.
fidei but not de fide primario; as Paul left his cloak at Troas. Thirdly,
somethings are de fide, but non de verbo fidei, which are the conclusions
drawn from the canonical word by consequence. And these are either drawn
from the word generally; as this, that the Scriptures are the word of God. for
this is evident from the whole word generally, and although this be a principle
in it self, which ought first to be believed; yet in my conception, and manner
of taking up, it is a conclusion arising from that majesty and Divine character
which is in the word it self, or the particular conclusions drawn from the
word. They are de fide, non de verbo fidei, as when a man concludes, his own
particular justification from the word; as I James am justified, est de fide
mea, and not a part of the canonical word, but an application arising from it.
Fourthly, something are neither de fides nor de verbo fidei.

Secondly, we may answer to this: whether the word written be an article of our
faith or not. The articles Articles of our faith, taken generally or specially.
of our faith are either taken generally, or specially: generally, for all that
is contained in the Scriptures, or may be deduced by way of consequence from
the Scriptures: then it is not an article of our faith, to believe the canon of
the Scriptures. Secondly, specially for that which is contained in the Creed;
for the Creed is the substance of that which is contained in the Scriptures;
and then it is an article of our faith to believe the Cannon of the Scriptures.

The Scriptures of God, are considered essentially, The Scriptures considered
essentially or accidentally.
or accidentally. Essentially, as they proceed from God; accidentally again,
as they were written by such and such men. As they proceed from God, we must
believe them to be true, and to be the means of our salvation; for saving
truth is only from God. But if we consider them but accidentally, as they are
written by such and such men, then it is not an article of our faith to believe
them; for it makes not to our salvation primario, to know that they were
written by such and such men.

When the books in holy Scripture, carry the names of those who wrote them; as
the books of Moses carry his name; if a man should deny these books to be
written by Moses, and then be ignorant altogether of the matter contained in
them; then his ignorance were damnable, and the denial of them heretical;
they Ignorantia damnabilis negatio haretica.
have Moses and the Prophets, Luke 16.

But if the writer of the book be not set down in the Scripture; if a man
should deny such a man to write it, he should not be reputed as an heretic
for that; and to be ignorant that such a man wrote it, this Negatia est
haeretica per accidens sed igneratio non est damnabilis.
were not damnable ignorance. Example, it is holden that Paul wrote the Epistle
to the Hebrews; now if a man should deny that Paul wrote this Epistle, he were
not to be holden a heretic for that, neither were his ignorance damnable. A
man may be ignorant of this or that book, and yet be saved, and many were
saved before the books were written, and now many are saved who cannot read
the Scriptures.

But when a man doubts of the order and number Ignorantia hic est
infirmitatis and negatio est haeritica per accidens.
of the books in the Canon, this argues but his unskilfulnesse and infirmity,
and the denial of the number and order of these books, is but heretical by
accident, and the ignorance is not damnable.

When we believe such a book to be written by such

When we believe that such a man wrote this book,

The conclusion of this is. Seeing God has revealed his will in his word
written to us, and remitted us always to the law and to the testimony, Esaias
10. 8. Ioh. 5. 49. search the Scriptures: therefore those who leave the
Scriptures, and make choice of traditions; they forsake the fonntaine of living
waters, and dig Cisternes to themselves that can hold no water, Ier. 2. 13.

EXERCITAT. IX.
Of the singular prerogatives which the secretaries of the holy Ghost had, who
wrote the Scriptures.

2 Pet. 1. 21. And the holy men of God spoke as they were moved by the holy
Ghost.
THe holy men of God, who were inspired by the holy Spirit to write the
Scriptures: First they Gal. 1. 12. For the Gospel which I preached, I received
it not of man, neither was I taught but by the revelation of Jesus Christ, they
had not their calling from man, but immediately from God. They had their calling
intuitu Ecclesiae, 1 Cor. 3. 2. sed non Vocatio vel est intuitu ecclesiae.
inter ventu eccle.


interventu Ecclesiae: that is, God ordained these offices for the good of the
Church, and it was for the Church cause that he appointed them; but they had
not their calling from the Church: But Preachers now have their calling both
intuitu Ecclesiae, and interventu Ecclesiae. There Immediata suppositi.
virtutis.


is immedietas ratione suppositi and immedietas ratione virtutis: the first is,
when the person is immediately separated by God to such a calling; the second
is, when the graces and calling, are immediately given by God. When Ministers
are called, they have their gifts immediately from God, and so they have their
calling; there interveneth no suppositum, or midst between God and them: but
for the appointing and designing of them to such places; that they have from
the Church. But the Apostles were called immediately, both ratione suppositi and
virtutis; they had their gifts immediately from God, neither were they designed
to such and such plaees as the Ministers are now.

The Prophets and Apostles were immediately called by God, and therefore
Matthias was chosen by lot to be an Apostle, because the lot is immediately
directed by the hand of God; but Preachers now should not be chosen by lot.
Zeno the Emperor tempted God in this case, laying a paper upon the Altar, that
God might write in the paper the name of him, who should be Bishop of
Constantinople: but Flavitius corrupting the Nicephorus, Lib. 2.
Sexton of the Church, caused him to write in his name, and so was made Bishop
of Constantinople.

But Moses learned from the Egyptians, and Daniel from the Chaldeans:
therefore it may seem that they

They had the learning of humane sciences and trades Paul learned from men to
be a Tent maker: The Apostles and Prophets learned their humane Sciences and
Arts from men but not their divine knowledge.
so Moses learned these humane sciences from the Egyptians, and Daniel from
the Chaldeans; but their knowledge, as Prophets and Apostles imediatly was from
God. Although they had their divine knowledge immediately from God, yet they
were to entertain it by reading, The Prophets know. ledge was kept by reading.

we do our fire: So the Prophets knowledge was preserved by reading, as ours
is.

Their second pretogative, was the measure of knowledge The measure of the

differed from the knowledge of Christ; this was visio vnionis, and this
excelled the knowledge of all creatures, even of the Angels: this was not
called prophecy, as he was comprehensor; but as he was viator here upon the
earth, this his illumination is called Prophecy; he is called the great
Prophet, Deuteronomy. 18. 15. and in this sort of knowledge he excelled both men and
Angels. Secondly, their knowledge differed from the knowledge of Angels, and
the glorified Spirits: for prophecy as Peter says, 2 Pet. 1. 19. is like a
light shining in a dark place, but in Visio vnionis gloria raptus prophetiae


Heaven there is no darkness.

Thirdly, their knowledge differed from the knowledge that Paul had, when he
was taken up to the third heaven; and this was called visio raptus: their
knowledge was far inferior to all these sorts of knowledge; but it far
exceeded all the knowledge that we have.

Whether had the Prophets of God, and the Secretaries

They had not this gift of prophecy by way of habit, The Prophets had not the
gift of prophecy by habit.
as the children of God have their faith: and as Bezaliell and Aholiab,
although they had their knowledge immediately from God, to work all curious
works in the Tabernacle; yet they kept still this their knowledge as an
ordinary habit; but this gift of prophecy, the Prophets had it not as a habit,
but they had need still of new illumination when they prophesied. Peter
compares prophecy to a light shining in a dark place, 2 Pet. 1. 19. how long
continues light in a dark house? no longer then a candle is there: so this
coruscation, Paul says, I have left Trophimus sick at Miletum, 2 Timothy 4. 20.
So they could not prophecy when and where they pleased, 2 King. 4. 27. The
Lord has hid it from me and has not told it me, they had not this prophecy
as a permanent habit; but as that, which was now and then revealed unto them.
Ier. 42. 7. And it came to pass after ten days; here the Prophets behoved to
attend, until he got a new revelation from the Lord; and sometimes they waited
longer, and sometimes shorter for this revelation.

How differed the Prophets then from other men,

First, ye shall see a difference between them and Number. 17. It is said of
those Prophets, prophetarunt and non addiderunt, that is, they Prophetia
momentanea.
prophesied but that day only, that the Spirit came upon them, but never
after; as the Hebrews expound it: but the Prophets of the Lord, prophesied
often. So 2 King. 2. 3. The children of the Prophets came forth: they
prophesied, but this gift of prophecy continued not with them: but these
Prophets of the Lord, often prophesied: And although they had not the habit of
prophecy, yet they were separated by God for that purpose, to expect still for
new illumination.

The third prerogative, which the holy men of God had, was this, that they
could not err in their writing, (...).
2 Pet. 1. 21. The holy men of God spoke as they were inspired by the holy
Ghost, Matthew. 10: 2. Luke 21. 15. Luke 1. 17. The Peophets erred not in writing
the Scriptures.
therefore the Prophets were called, the mouth of God, Luke 1. 70. Ier. 15. 19.
thou shall be as my mouth. He spoke not only by their mouths, but also they
were The Prophets are called the mouth of God.
his mouth. And contrary to this is that lieing Spirit in the mouth of the
false Prophets. 1 King. 22. 22.

The secretaries of the holy Ghost, erred sometimes in some of their purposes,
and in some circumstances Wherein the Prophets and Apostles erred.
of their calling; but in the doctrine it self they never erred. Peter in the
transfiguration, knew not what he said, Luke 9. 33. David was minded to build
an house to God, he asked of Nathan if he should do so, 1 Chro. 17. 2. Nathan
said to him; do what is in thine heart. So when Eliab stood before Samuel, 1 Samuel 16. 6. Samuel said: surely the Lords anointed is before me. So the
Disciples erred in their counsel, which they gave to Paul, forbidding him to
go up to Jerusalem, Act. 21. 4. But the spirit of God, taught the contrary by
Agabus, verse. 17. David Psalm. 116. said in his have, that all men are liars: he
meant, that Samuel the man of God had made a lie to him; because he thought
the promise too long defferred in getting of the kingdom. So when he wrote a
letter to Ioab with Vriah, in this he was not Gods secretary, but the Devils.
But as they were the secretaries of God, and spoke by divine inspiration, they
could not err.

But it may seem, that all which they wrote in holy Paul wrote that he would
come to Spain, Romans 15. 24. and yet he never came to Spain.

We must distinguish between their purposes external, yea and Amen, 2 Cor. 1.
20. He wrote that he was purposed to come to Spain, and so he was; but he was
let, that he could not come.

But Paul repented that he wrote the Epistle to the Corinthians to grieve them,
2 Cor. 7. 8. If this was written by the inspiration of the holy Ghost, why did
he repent of it?

Paul wrote this Epistle to humble them, and when comes to cure a wounded
man, he puts the Paul, that he had written to the Corinthians; but it
repented him to see them so swallowed up with grief.

But if the Scriptures be Divinely inspired, how say Iud. 16. 17. there were
about three thousand upon the roof of the house. So Act. 2. 40. and that day
there were added to the Church, about three thousand souls. Is not the number
of all things, certainly known to God?

The Scriptures set down the number that way: because

Peter erred in a matter of faith, Gal. 2. 14.

The error was not in the substance, but in the circumstance of the fact: and
where it is said, Gal. 2. 14. Wherein Peter erred.
That Peter walked not uprightly, according to the Gospel; it is to be
understood only of his conversation; he erred here only, in this principle
of Christian Religion; not walking according to his knowledge, but he erred
not in his writing.

All men are subject to error, the Prophets and Apostles

The Prophets and Apostles are considered as members The Apostles considered
two manner of ways.
as other men, Lord forgive us our sins. Secondly, they are considered
according to their functions and immediate calling; and then they were above
the Church, and could not err.

What needed Nathan to be sent to David to attend

Although one Prophet stood not in need of another; of a Prophet to admonish
him: for Kings stand in slippery places, and have need of others to advertise
them.

The Prophets, as they were Prophets, could not err; therefore, that
collection of the Jews, is most impious: they say that David wished to the
sons of Ioab four things, 2 Samuel 3. 29. First that some of them might dye by
the sword. Secondly, that some of them might dye of the bloody flixe. Thirdly,
that some of them might lean upon a staff. And fourthly, that some of them
might beg their bread. And so they say, it befell David's posterity, for his
sinful wish. One of them leaned upon a staff, Asa was goutish. One of his
posterity was killed by the sword, as Josias. One of them dyed of the flixe, as
Rehoboam. And one of them begged his bread, as Iehojachim. But this collection
is most impious; for David spoke not here by a private spirit of revenge, but
as a Prophet of God: and therefore when they assign these to be the causes,
why these judgments befell David's posterity; they assign that for a cause,
which was not a cause.

The fourth prerogative, they were holy men. Holiness The penmen of the holy
Ghost, were holy men.
illumination, but not of sanctification: the Lord made choice of none such to
be his secretaries, who were not sanctified. The Lords Prophet is called vir
spiritus, the man of the Spirit, Hos. 9. 7. because he is ruled, and guided by
the holy Spirit, that he become not profaine. If the very women, who spun the
curtains to the Tabernacle were wise hearted, Exodus 35. 25. Much more will the
Lord have those, who are to build his house; wise and holy men. Those who
translated the Bible into Greek, ye shall see how often they changed their
faith, and were turne-coates: Aquila of a Christian he became a Jew. Symmachus
was first a Samaritane, and then he became half Jew, half Christian. Then
Theodoton, first he was a fllower of Tatianus the heretic, and then he became
a Marcionite, and thirdly he became a Jew. But the Prophets of God, after they
were called, continued holy men, and never fell back again.

God will have no man, but holy men to be his secretaries, See more of Solomon
in the Politiks.
Luke 1. 70. As he spoke by the mouth of his holy Prophets. Therefore Solomon
being a Prophet, and one of Gods secretaries, behoved to be a holy man; and
being holy he could not be a reprobate: hence he is called Iedidiah, The
beloved of God, 2. Sam. 12. 25. and whom God loves, he loves to the end.

The holy men of God wrote as they were (...), inspired by God, the Spirit
enlightened them, and directed (...).
them when they wrote: they were inspired three Illuminati antecedenter. per
concomitantia^ subsequenter.


manner of ways, first, antecedenter. Secondly, per concomitantiam; and
thirdly, subsequenter.

First, they were illuminate antecedenter: when the Lord revealed things to
come to his Prophets, and made them to write his prophesies; then their tongue,
was the pen of a swift writer, Psalm. 45. 1. That is, he not only indicted these
prophesies unto them; but also ruled them so, and guided them in writing; even
as a master guides the hand of a young child, when he is learning to write.

Secondly, he inspired them in writing the Histories and Acts, after another
manner per concomitantiam: for that which was done already, he assisted them
so in writing it down; that they were able to discern the relations which
they had from others, to be true: as Luke knew (...), accurately the truth of
these things, which How Luke differed from Tertius and Baruch.
he had from those, who had heard and seen Christ: and he made (...), a
perfect declaration of them. There was a great difference betwixt him and
Tertius, who was Paul's Scribe, and wrote out his Epistles, Romans 16. 22. or
betwixt him and Baruch, who was Ieremies Scribe, Ier. 38. they were not (...)
the secretaries of the holy Ghost, but (...) discribebant ab alio, they wrote
only these things which Jeremiah and Paul indicted to them; neither was
sanctification required in them, as they were their Scribes. But the
Evangelists who saw not Christ, yet they were the Secretaries of the holy
Ghost, and holy men; as they were his Secretaries, and directed by him to write.

Thirdly, he assisted them in writing subsequenter; the holy Ghost revealed
things to the Prophets long before; but when they were to write these things,
the spirit of the Lord brought the same things to their memory again; and
indicted these things unto them which they had seen before in vision. Ier. 36.
2. Take thee a roll, and write therein all the words that I have spoken to
thee, against Israel and against Judah, and against all the Nations; from the
day that I spoke to thee, even from the days of Josias, unto this day. So Ioh.
14. 26. the comforter which is the holy Ghost whom the Father will send in my
name, he shall teach you all thing, and bring all things to your memory which I
have told you.

These Secretaries of the holy Ghost, when they wrote, habebant libertatam
exercitij, sed non specificationis, Libertas exercitij specificationis


as they say in the Schools, they were not like Blocks or Stones, but the
Lord inclined their wills freely to write: which puts a difference betwixt
them, and A difference betwixt the Prophets of God and the Sybiles, or Prophets
of the devil.
the Sybils, and other Prophets of the Devil, who were blasted, and distracted
in their wits, when they prophesied. When Elisha sent one of the children of
the Prophets, to annoint Iehu; one said to him, wherefore comes this mad
fellow, 2 King. 9. 11? they took the Prophets to be mad, like unto the
Heathish Prophets, but they were enlightened by the Spirit when they
prophesied, and the Lord rectified their understanding, and took not away from
them the right use of their will. It is said of Saul, when he prophesied, that
the evil spirit of Lord came upon him, 1 Samuel 18. 10. And the Chaldie
Paraphrast paraphraseth it, caepit furere, he began to be mad: the Devil
stopping the passages of his body, he wrought upon his melancholious humor,
which is called Esca diaboli, the Devils bait; and then it is said, ijthnabbe,
impulit se ad prophetandum, which is never spoken of the true Prophets in this
Conjugation. (...)


Although the Lords Secretaries had libertatem exercitij, yet they had not
libertatem specificationis; that is, they might not leave that subject which
they were called to write, and write any other thing, as they pleased; they
were necessitated only to write that, although they wrote it freely.

Again, these men when they wrote as the holy Ghost enspired them, they did it
not with pain and The Prophts did not write with pain and study.
study, as we do; but it came freely from them without any pain or vexation
of their spirit. The Princes when they heard Baruch read the prophecy of
Jeremiah, after that it was endited, they asked how did he write all these
words at his mouth? and Baruch answered them, He pronounced all these words to
me with his mouth, and I wrote them with ink into the Book, Iere. 36. 17. 18.
Solomon says, Eccles. 12. 12. In making many books and in reading there is
much weariness of the flesh, but this was no weariness to them; for they
wrote this without any pain or labor: and hence it follows, that those to
whom their writing has been troublesome and painful, have not been the
Secretaries of the holy Ghost; as Mac. 2. 26. He that assayed to abridge the
five Books of Jason said, that it was not an easy thing, to make this
abridgement; but it required both sweat and labon.

Seeing all that wrote the holy Scriptures were enspired Why was John called a
Divine. (...).
to John, to be called a Divine, Revela. 1. 1. For they were all Divines who
wrote the holy Scriptures?

The Greek Fathers, when they spoke of Christ, Chrysostom, they distinguish
between Quomodo differunt (...) and (...)
(...), and (...), and they say, Apud caeteros aeconomiae fulmen, sed apud
Iohannem theologiae tonitrua extare. The rest when they discribe the humanity
of Christ, they do it (...); but when John discribeth the Divinity of Christ,
he does it (...); and they say Mattheus (...) and Johannes (...), incipit

Observe a difference betwixt these speeches. The The Lord came to the wicked,
but the word of the Lord came to his Prophets.
Word of the Lord came to Esaias, to Jeremiah; and this phrase: The Lord came to
Balaam, to Abimelech, to Laban. The first signifies, that the Lord put these
holy men in trust with his Word to be his Prophets; but he never concredited
his word to these prophaine wretches: therefore it is said only, He came to
them, but never the Word of the Lord came to them. He concredited his Word to
his Prophets, as to Esaias, and Jeremiah (...), that is, as a pupil is
concredited to the trust of his Tutor; but he never concredited his Word to
these wretches.

The Lord spoke in his Prophets, Hosea 1. 1. The Spirit (...) Notat internam
revelationem.
of the Lord spoke in me, that is, inwardly revealed his secrets to me. Mark a
difference betwixt these two phrases, Loqui in aliquo, and Loqui in aliquem.

Loqui in aliquo, is when the Spirit of the Lord speaks inwardly to the
Prophets; sed Loqui in aliquem est Loqui in alique and loqui in aliquem vt
differunt.
maledicere, to rail against him: thus Number. 12. Miriam loquuta est in Mosem,
id est, maledixit Mosi.

The conclusion of this is, Matthew. 10. 20. It is not ye that speak, but the
Spirit of our Father which speaks in you. So it was not they who wrote, but
the Spirit of the Lord in them. 2 King. 13. When Ioash the King of Israel took
a Bow in his hand, Elisha laid his hands upon the Kings hands, and Elisha bad
him shoot; and he said, the Arrow of the Lords deliverance and the Arrow of
the deliverance from Syria; it was not the Kings hand that directed the Arrow
here, but it was the hand of the Prophet laid upon the Kings hand which gave
this mighty blow: so it was the hand of the Lord laid upon the hands of his
Secretaries, which directed them to write the holy Word of God.

EXERCITAT. IX.
Arguments proving the Scriptures to be Divine.

1 Thessalonians. 2. 13. Ye received it not as the Word of man, but as it is in truth
the Word of God.
THe Testimonies which prove the Scriptures to be Divine, are first, the
Testimony of God himself when he approved them by his Spirit, and when they
were laid before him, by Vrim and Thummim. Secondly, arguments drawn out of
the Scriptures themselves. Thirdly, the Testimony of the Church. Fourthly, the
Testimony of those who were without the Church, Deus testatur, Scriptura
contestatur, and Ecclesia subtestatur.

God bears witness to the Scriptures two ways, Deus testatur.
First, by the internal Testimony of his Spirit. Secondly, by his external
Testimony.

When the Spirit testifies unto us such Books to be

This is a public Testimony, which the Spirit Testifies

The second Testimony which God gave to the Scriptures, was his external
testimony given by Vrim and Thummim, testifying these Books of Moses and the
Prophets, to be the holy Scriptures.

What are we to think of these Books, written and Vrim and Thummim?

These Books were called Ketubhim, written Books, (...)
which were confirmed by Vrim and Thummim: they who wrote these Books were
inspired by the holy Ghost as well as these who wrote the former; and they were
confirmed by the masters of the great Synagogue, (...) a radice
such as were Esdras Zachary and Malachie. The Greeks called these Books
(...): and the Jews (...) abscondere.
distinguish them still, from the Apocryphal Books called (...).
Gannazim abscinditi, and the Greeks called them (...), Books of whose
authority it was still doubted.

Reasons taken out of the Scriptures themselves proving them to be Divine; the
first reason is taken from tempus Scriptura contestatur.
(...) to the heathen, that is, it was an hid or an unknown time to them.
After the flood, the Scriptures go on, and they set down to us the history of
the Church: but the Heathen history is Tempus (...), or fabulosum; as that
which we read of Hercules, and Tempus (...) (...) Historicum.


Prometheus: and nothing is set down in the Heathen history before the
Olympiads of the Graecians, which was but in the days of Vzziah. See how far
Gods Word exceeds humane history, in antiquity; It begins with the world
and ends with it, Luke 1. 70. as he spoke by the mouth of his holy Prophets,
which have been since the world began.

Secondly, the matter contained in the Scriptures shows morbum, medicinam,
and medicum, it shows us both the sickness, the physic, and the Physician
to cure it.

Thirdly, the Scripture sets down things necessary The Scriptures not
written to satisfy men's curiosity.
It is often repeated in the Books of the Kings and Chronicles. The rest are
they not written in the Books of the Chronicles, of the Kings of Judah and
Israel, So Ester. 10. 2. The rest are they not written in the Books of the
Kings of Persia. The holy Ghost would meet here with the curious desires of
men, who desire still to know more and more, and to read pleasant discourses,
to satisfy their humors: as if the Spirit of God should say; I have
sufficiently told you here of the Kings of Judah and Israel, and of Persia, and
so far as concerns the Church, and may serve for your edification: it is
not my manner to satisfy your curiosity, if ye would know more, go to your
own Scrowles and Registers; where ye shall find matter enough to pass the
time with. To be short, the Scriptures are not given to pass the time with,
but to redeem the time.

Fourthly, the prophesies set down in the holy Esa. 41. 22. Let them show the
former things what they be, that we may consider them and set our hearts upon
them: and show us the things that are to Renunciare proet^rita anunei are
presentia p^enunciare futura.
come hereafter, that we may know that ye are Gods. Here the Prophet
distinguishes the true God from the false Gods, and true prophesies from
false: If they could tell of things bypast, and relate them from the beginning
and join them with the things to come; then he would confess that they were
Gods, and that their prophesies were true. To tell of things past is not in
respect of time; for the Angels and Devils can tell things fallen out from the
beginning of time: but it is in respect of the things themselves, when they
took beginning, and this is only proper to God, Psalm. 139. 16. In thy Book
all my members were written, which in continuance were fashioned, when as yet
there were none of them. He can join things bypast with things that are to
follow; and can tell certainly of things to come. There is a twofold beginning
of things. The first is, exordium rei: The second is, exordium temporis. The
Angels know exordium Exordium temporis rei.


temporis, but not exordium rei; for the Lord only knows things before the
foundation of the world was laid, Ephe. 1. 4. He who knows certainly the
beginning of things, can only certainly fortell the event of things, as
though they were present, Hos. 12. 4. he wept and made supplication to him: he
found him in Bethel, and there he spoke with us. Here the thing past, he
applies to the generation which was present, because he knew exordium rei.

The plain, and clear manner of setting down the Scriptures, shows them to
be Divine, Esa. 8. 1. Take a great roll, and write in it with a man's pen,
Behheret enosh. (...)
That is clearly, that the simplest amongst the children of men may understand
it, Deuteronomy. 30. 11. This commandment which I command thee this day, is not
hidden from thee, neither is it far off: In the Hebrew it is, Lo niphleeth,
non (...)
separatum a te, that is, it is not separated from thy knowledge, that thou
cannot understand it: and it is not far from thee, for these things which are
obscure and doubtful which we cannot take up, are said to be far from us;
these things which we understand again are said to be near us, Romans 10. 8.

But it may be said that there are many things hard in

We must distinguish these three, the obscurity in the Obscurita^ est vel^n
rebus ipsis. modo tradendi. conceptione.


conception to take them up. There are many matters handled in the Scripture,
which are hard to be understood, and we are dull in conception to take up these
things; yet they are clearly and plainly set down in the word. Christ
shows all these three, Ioh. 3. 12. If I have told you earthly things, and ye
believe not: how shall ye believe if I tell you of heavenly things. If I have
told you earthly things, that is, illustrated heavenly things to you by earthly
comparisons; here is Christ's plain manner in setting down his word. And ye
believe not; here is our dullness in taking up these things which are plainly
set down. How shall ye believe if I shall tell you of heavenly things, here
is the obscurity of the heavenly matters contained in the Scriptures. The
Church of Rome confounds still these three, Obscuritas rei, and nostri
conceptus, cum perspicuo modo tradendi, the obscurity in the matter the
dullness of our conception, with the clear manner of manifestation of these
things in the Scriptures.

The Heavenly consent and agreement, amongst the writers of the holy
Scriptures, shows them to be Divine. There were in the Church Patriarchs
Prophets The agreement of the writers of the holy Scriptures.
and Apostles: Amongst the Patriarchs Abraham was the chief; therefore the
revelations made to the rest of the Patriarchs, as to Isaac and to Jacob, had
always relation, to the promises made to Abraham. Amongst the Prophets Moses
was the chief, and therefore all the Prophets grounded themselves upon Moses.
And upon the revelations made to the Apostles, the faith of the Church is
grounded, under the New Testament: and ye shall never find any contradictions
amongst these holy writers; there may seem some contradiction amongst them,
but indeed there is none. Epiphanius uses a good comparison to this purpose:
when a man, says he, is drawing water out Although there seem some
contradiction in the Scriptures, we should labor to reconcile them.
diversity of colors vanishes, and the waters appear both of one color, and
when we taste them, they have but one relish. So says he, although at the
first, there seem some contradiction in the holy Scriptures, yet when we look
nearer and nearer unto them, we shall find no contrariety in them, but a
perfect harmony. When we see the Heathen history, or Apocryphal Books
contradicting the holy History, we should stand for the holy Scriptures
against them: but when we see any appearance of contradiction in the
Scriptures, we should labor to reconcile them: when Moses saw an Egyptian
and an Israelite striving together; he killed the Egyptian, and saved the
Israelite, Exodus 2. 12. But when be saw two Israelits striving together, he
labored to reconcile them, saying, ye are brethren why do ye strive. So
when we see the Apocryphal Books, or heathen History, to contradict the
Scriptures, we should kill the Egyptian and save the Israelite. Example, Jacob
cursed Simeon and Levi, for murdering of the Sichemites, Genesis 49. 7. but
Judith blessed Simeon for killing of them, Judith 9. So Jeremiah says, they
shall return in the third generation, Ier. 27. 7. but Baruch says, they shall
return in the seventh generation Baruch, 6. here let us kill the Egyptian but
save the Israelite: but when we see any appearance of contradiction in the
holy Scriptures, we should labor to reconcile them, because they are brethren.

The heavenly order set down in the Scriptures Ordo naturae, Ordo conjugalis
thori, Ordo historiae, and Ordo dignitatis; all these the Scriptures mark, and
for sundry Ordo natura. conjugalis thori. historiae. dignitatis.


reasons sets one before another: and although there be not prius and
posterius in Scriptura (as the Jews say) in respect of the particular
occasions, yet there is still prius and posterius in respect of the general
end of the history. First, in setting down the Patriarchs, it observes
ordinem naturae, as they were borne; as Ruben in the first place, because he
was the first borne; and then Simeon, thirdly Levi, and fourthly Judah, etc.
Secondly, The Tribes are set down sometimes according to their nativity, and
sometimes as they were borne of free women.
there is Ordo conjugalis thori, according to their birthes, and so the free
women's sons, are set first in the Brestplate of Aaron, Exodus 28. Thirdly,
there is Ordo dignitatis, as Sem is placed before Iaphet for dignity, although
he was younger. So the Scripture else where observes this order, Matthew. 13. He
brings fourth new and old, and Ephe. 2. Apostles and Prophets. So the
Scripture observes the order of history, Matthew. 1. 1. The Book of the
generation of Jesus Christ, the Son of David the Son of Abraham. why is
Abraham put last after David? because the history is to begin at him. So 1
Chro. 3. 5. Solomon is placed last amongst his brethren, because the history
was to begin at him: and if we shall mark the heavenly order that is amongst
the Evangelists, they The heavenly order amongst the Evangelists show the
Scriptures to be Divine.
will show us that the Scriptures are divine. Mark begins at the works of
Christ. Matthew ascends higher, to the birth of Christ. Luke goes higher, to
the conception of Christ, and John goes highest of all, to the divinity of
Christ and his eternal generation. Who would not admire here, the steps of
Jacobs heavenly ladder, ascended from Joseph to Adam, and from Adam to God.

The matter contained in the Scriptures, shows them Iam. 4. 6. The spirit in
us lusts after envy, yet the Scriptures offer more grace, The Scriptures
offer grace to resist sin.
that is, the Scriptures offer grace and ability to do more, then nature can
do: Nature cannot heal a Spirit, that lusts after envy, or after money or
after uncleanesse; but the Scriptures offer more grace to overcome any of these
sins, be they never so strong. The Law of the Lord is perfect converting the
soul, Psalm. 19. 17. when it is dead in sin, it quickneth and reviveth it
again; and when it is decayed in grace, it The Word of God is a restorer of
the spiritual life.
restores it again, even as Boaz is said to be a restorer of the life of
Naomi, and a nurisher of her old age, Ruth 4. 15.

The rubukes and threatenings of the holy Ghost in Ionathans bow did never turn
back, and the Sword of Saul never returned empty, 2 Samuel 1. 22. So the Arrows
of the King are sharp to pierce his enemies, Psalm 45. 5.

Ioh. 10. 35. The Scriptures cannot be broken, the arguments and they stand
like a brazen wall against all oppositions; therefore the Lord challenges men
to bring forth their strongest reasons, Esa. 41. 21. produce your cause says
the Lord, bring forth your strong reasons says the King of Jacob.

The Church is the Pillar of Truth, she holds out Ecclesia subtestatur.
the Truth to be seen, she expounds and interprets the Scriptures; yet
her testimony in but an inducing testimony, and not a persuading testimony:
she can teach the Truth, but she cannot seal up the truth in our hearts, and
make us to believe the Truth of the Scripture. Her testimony is but in actu
exercito, but non Actus exercitus. signatus.


signato. Her testimony is informativum, sen directivum, it informs and
directs us, sed non certificativum and terminativum fidei; that is, she
cannot persuade us of the Truth by her Testimony.

Testimonies of these also, who are without the Church prove the Scriptures to
be Divine, and these are of two sorts; either Heretics, or Infidels.

First, the testimonies of Heretics prove the Scriptures Heretics prove the
Scripture to be Divine, ex accidente.
to be Divine; for Heretics labor always to ground themselves upon the
Scriptures. The habit goes always before the privation, and omne falsum
innititur vero, every falsehood labors to cover it self under the Truth.
When the Husbandman had sown his good seed, then came the evil one and did
sow his Tares: when Heretics labor to ground themselves upon the Scriptures;
it is, as when a thief goes to cover himself under the pretense of Law. This
argues the Law to be just and equal. The testimonies also of the Heathen
history proves the Scriptures to be Divine. Observe the descent of the
Babylonian and Assyrian Kings, and look back again to the holy Scriptures:
ye shall see clearly, how they jumpe with the Scriptures: and as those who
sail along the Coast, have a pleasant view of the Land; but those who stand
Succession of Heathen Kings proved out of the Scripture.
Ships: so when we look from the Heathen history, and mark the descent of
the Heathen Kings, we shall see a pleasant sight: but a far more delectable
and sure sight, when we look from the Scriptures, to the Heathen history.
Mark the descent; Belochus the third called Pull King of Assyria came against
Menahem, and took his son, 2 King. 15. Then Pileser called Tiglath, came
against Hoshea, King of Samaria, and took him in the sixth year of the reign
of King Ezekias: and then Shalmaneser, who carried away the ten Tribes into
captivity, in the ninth year of Hoshea, 2 King. 17. and his son Sennacherib,
2 King. 18. came against Judah, in the foureteenth year of Zedekias, and
Esarhaddon succeeded his father Sennacherib, and his son Berodach-baladon,
sent letters and a present to Hezekias, then Berodach, 2 Chro. 33. carried away
Iechonias, and then Nebuchadnezzer carried away Zedekias; then Nabuchadnezzer
the great, burnt Jerusalem, and carried away the people captive. Then Evil
Merodach, who succeeded him had three sons, Ragasar, Babasar and Belshassar,
of whom we read Dan. 5. and in Belshassers time, the kingdom was translated
to the Medes and Persians. Here we see the descent of the Heathen history,
agreeing with the holy Scriptures.

There are other testimonies of the Heathen, to prove How the Heathen
testimonies prove the Scriptures to be divine.
the Scripture to be Scripture, but not so clearly; when we find the rubbish
of some old monuments, we gather that there has been some great building
there: So when we find some dark footesteps of holy Scripture amongst the
Heathen, we may gather, that once the holy Scriptures* have been read amongst
them, although they have depraved and corrupted them.

Example 1. They of the East Indians have this fable Montan. in his Essays.
amongst them, that the Gods drowned the world for sin, and that they took
some just men, and put them up in the clifts of Rocks, to save them: those men
to try whether the waters were abated or not; sent forth some mastive Dogs,
and the Dogs returning as clean as they went out; they gathered by this,
that the waters were not yet abated: they sent them forth the second time, then
they returned full of mudde, by this they gathered that the waters were abated:
then they sent them forth the third time and they returned no more. Here we see
how this fable is taken out of the history of the deluge, and from Noah's
sending forth the Dove out of the Arc; and that this history was known of old
amongst the Heathen, we may perceive because the Dove and the Raven are called
the messengers of the Gods, by the Heathen Poets.

Example 2. Genesis 36. 24. This is Anah who found out (...)
Hajemim mules, in the Wilderness, others read it Iamin^ waters: now because
it was hard to find out the right translation of the word, some translating it
Mules, and some translating it Water: the Heathen made up a notable lie on the
Jews, saying; when Anah was feeding his Asses in the Wilderness, because the
Mules and Asses found out water in the Wilderness for them to Tacitus. lib. 5.
Plutarch. in symposiasis. 4. cap. 5.
drink, therefore the Jews worshipped the golden head of an Ass: see how
some shadow of holy histostory was still amongst the Heathen.

Example 3. When the destroying Angel destroyed the first borne of their
children, and beasts in Egypt, the Lord caused to sprinkle the blood of the
paschall Lamb, upon the Lintels of the doors, that so their first borne might
be saved, Exodus 12. 13. Epiphanius records Epipha. contra hareses. lib. 18.
that the Egyptians afterward, although they had forgotten the history of the
work of God, yet they rubbed over their Cattle with a red sort of Keill, to
save them that no evil should befall them that year, ignorantly
counterfeitting that blood, which saved the Israelites once in Egypt: which
fable lets us to understand, that this Scripture was once taught amongst
them.

Example 4. Plato did hold that in the revolution of so many years, men should
be just in the same estate, wherein they were before; which is drawn obscurely
from the resurrection, when we shall be in (...), as we were in (...) Matthew.
19. 28.

Example 5. Clemens Alexandrinus and Basil note, The Heathen grounded many of
their fables upon the Scriptures.
that the Heathen Philosophers did make their fables, counterfeitting the
Scriptures; and founded their falsehoods upon the truth of God, that men might
give credit to their lies: as upon this, Jonas was swallowed up by the Whale;
they made up this fable of Arion, sitting upon a Delphin, and playing upon an
harp, and a thousand such.

The Conclusion of this is. Seeing the Scriptures are Divine, we must pray with
David, Psalm. 119. 18. open thou mine eyes, that I may behold the wondrous
things out of thy Law in the original it is, Devolue ab oculis meis (...)
velamen, scilicet, caliginis, and let us be diligent searchers and dwell in
them, as Paul bids Timothy, (...) Panormitan writes of Alphonsus King of
Arragon, that in the midst of all his princely affairs, he read over the
Bible fourteen times, with the gloss and commentaries upon it. The Jews say,
let a man divide his life in three parts; a third part for the Scriptures, a
third part for mishneth, and a third part for gemara, (...)
that is, two for the Talmud, and one for the Scriptures, see how well they
were exercised in reading of the Law.

EXERCITAT. X.
In what languages the Scriptures were written originally.

Genesis 11. 1. And the whole earth was of one language and of one speech.
THe Old Testament was written originally in Hebrew, and the New Testament in
Greek.

The Character, in which the Old Testament was In what character the Scriptures
were written at the first.
written first, was the Samaritane Character; It was called the Samaritane
Character, not because the Samaritans used it first, but because it was left to
the Samaritans after the Jews refused it.

This Samaritane Character was the first Character as may be seen by the
inscriptions upon their shekels set Why called the Samaritane character.
down by Arius Montanus, Beza, and Willet upon Ezekiel. And sundry of the
Jews ancient monuments have these letters upon them.

The Character at the first was the Jews and not the Samaritans, as is proved
by the inscriptions of the shekels. The inscriptions upon the Shekels, show the
Samaritane character to be the first.
The inscription is this, Jerusalem hakkodesh; but no Samaritan would have put
this inscription upon it: for they hated Jerusalem and the Jews, therefore
this inscription must be the Jews, and not the Samaritans.

Secondly, most of these ancient shekels are found about Jerusalem, therefore
the shekel and letters upon it, The Jews kept the Samaritane character in the
captivity.
was at the first the Jews, and not the Samaritans.

This Samaritane Character the Jews kept still, in the time of the captivity,
when Belshasser saw fingers writing upon the wall, Mean mean tekel, etc. Dan.
5. 25. These Characters were the Samaritan Characters: therefore the
Babylonians could not read them; because they knew not that Character; neither
could the Jews understand the matter although they knew the letters: to the
Babylonians, it was like a sealed book; and to the Jews it was like an open
book, to an unlearned man; because they understood it not, Esa, 29. 11. But
Daniel read it and understood it, both because he knew the letters, and also
understood the Chaldee tongue.

Esdras changed this Character after the captivity, Hieron. in ^erfat. lib.
regune.
and left it Idiotis, to the Samaritans: and he set down this new Character,
which before was the Chaldee, Character.

The reason why he changed it, was this, because being long in the captivity,
they forgot their own language, that they could neither read it rightly, nor
write it rightly: and therefore he changed the Characters, in these which we
have now.

But the ancient Samaritan Character seems to be Why Esdras changed the
Character.

forehead of the Highpriest, after the captivity; for they might change none of
the ornaments of the Highpriest. So neither that which was written upon the
plate of Gold, Kokesh Laihova, holiness to the Lord: because the Lord
commanded these clothes and ornaments, to be made for him, and his seed after
him, Exodus 28. 43.

Highpriest.

The New Testament was written originally in the Greek Character; and there
were two translations of it, Syriacke and Arabicke; the Syriacke was written in
the Syriacke Character, which differed much from that, which is called
Alphabetum Salomonis, or the Character which Solomon found out. This Character
Pineda sets down in his book De rebus Salomonis. These diverse Characters
may be seen setdowne here, as follows.

The Old Testament was originally written in the Hebrew tongue, and some of it
in the tongues derived from the Hebrew, as Chaldee.

We may know the Hebrew was the first original tongue; because it has fewest
Radical letters: whatsoever tongue is derived from thence, it adds some
letters to the first original; as from the Hebrew word Galal, comes Golgotha
the Syriacke word. So Gabbatha Bethsaida, from Gabha and Chased. Secondly, that
language which the Lord spoke, to Adam, Abraham and Moses, and they to him,
must be the original language. But God spoke to them in the Hebrew, and he
wrote the two Tables with his own hand in this language. And thirdly, that
language which expresses the nature, of things, and their affections most
clearly, and in fewest words; that must be the original language: but the
Hebrew does this; therefore it is the first language.

These tongues which were Propagines and Dialects of The Jews understood these
tongues which had affinity with the Hebrew.
the Hebrew, the Jews understood them, when they heard them spoken, and when
they read them, but they understood not the strange tongues, which had but
small affinity with the Hebrew. When Laban and Jacob made a covenant; Laban
called the heap of stones jegar Sagadutha in the Aramean tongue, which had
small affinity with the Hebrew; but Jacob called it Galeed, Genesis 31. 47.

But if there was little affinity betwixt the Aramean King. 18. 26. Speak to
thy servants in the Syrian language, for we understand it?

They might understand it, for they were Courtiours and States men; and so
learned it, as we learn now the The Hebrews understood not the Syrian
language but by learning.
Italians and French language. And Abraham's servant spoke to Nachor in the
Aramean language, he being borne in Damascus, which was in Cylo-Syria: and we
may think that Nachor and his house, understood the Hebrew tongue, being of
the posterity of Heber, and keep that tongue as Abraham did, who came out of
Vr of the Chaldees.

Assyria or Syria hebraice, Aram, comprehended all Palestina, The large extent
of the Syrian language
Damascus, the Kingdom of Assyria, Chaldea, babylon, Arabia, Cylo-Lyria and
Antiochia, Zoba, Adiabena, therefore all the languages which were spoken in
these parts, took their general denomination from Syria, as Syro-aramaea the
language which Laban spoke in Mesopotania: Syro-Chaldaea or Babylonica was that
which they spoke in Babylon, Syro-Antiochena which they spoke in Antioch or
Phoenicia: although they were Propagines or Dialects of the Hebrew, yet they
understood them not while they were taught: therefore Nabuchadnezzer caused to
instruct the children of the Jews in the Chaldee tongue, Dan. 1 4. but the
Syro-Arabean and the Palestine or Cananitish language they might understand it;
because it came nearer to their own language.

The Egyptian tongue differed much from the Hebrew, The Jews understood not
the Egyptian tongue.
Psalm. 81. 5. Joseph heard a language in Egypt, which he understood not.
Joseph here is put for the whole people of the Jews, because there was no
affinity betwixt the Hebrew and the Egyptian tongue, therefore they understood
not this tongue. So Psalm. 114. 1. they departed from a people of a strange
language, or a barbarous (...)
people: they called them all barbarous whom they understood not: and because
the Jews understood not the Egyptian tongue, therefore Joseph made him to
speak to his brethren by an Interpreter, Genesis. 42. 23.

The Cananitish language, was a daughter of the Hebrew The Cananites language a
diolect of the Hebrew.
tongue, or rather one, with the Hebrew tongue: and this we may perceive by the
names of the towns; men and places which were imposed to them by the
Cananites; as Jericho, Salem, Kiriath-arba, Kiriath-Sepher, Beth-dagon: so the
names of men, Melchizedeck, Adonibezek, Abimelech. And if the Cananitish
tongue, had not been all one with the Hebrew, how could the Patriarchs have
kept conference with those in Canaan, and made their Bargains and Contracts
with them? this is clear also by the example of Rahab, who could speak to the
Spies, and they understood her; and so Joshua to the Gibionites. The Lord would
have this tongue continued amongst the Cananites, because the Hebrews were
shortly to inhabit that land, and to converse with the Cananites for a while,
until they had rooted them out.

There is some of the Old Testament written in the Some of the Old Testament
written in the Chaldee tongue.
Chaldee tongue, which has great affiance with the Hebrew: and some of it
written in the Syrian dialect, as Job, which the Idumeans used, and it differed
little from the Hebrew tongue; but it differed much from the Syrian language
now, but more from Arabia Ismaelitica, which the Turks speak now, in Asia and
Africa.

There are some words found in the Old Testament which are Egyptian, Genesis 41.
43. Some Phaenitian, as Chabbul, 1 King. 9. 13. Some Persian words as Pur,
Esth. 9. 24. and some moabitish.

There is one verse in Jeremy originally written in the One Verse in Jeremy.

Chaldee tongue, Ier. 10. 11. whereas all the rest of that prophecy, is
written in the Hebrew tongue. The gods that have not made the heaven and earth,
even they shall perish from the earth, and from under these heavens. The reason
why this verse was written in the Chaldee tongue, was this; because the Jews
now, were to be carried to Babylon, and when they should be sollicitated there
to worship their gods, they should answer them in their own language; cursed
be your gods, for they made neither heaven nor earth.

That of Daniel and Ezra which is written in the Chaldee tongue, was
transcribed out of the roules, and registers Somethings taken of the registers
of the Chaldeans, and insert in the Scriptures.
of the Chaldeans; and insert in the books of God: but that which the holy
Ghost indicted originally to Daniel and Ezra, was written in the Hebrew tongue;
the rest was borrowed but out of their registers, as first, Nebuchad-nezzers
dreams, Dan. 2. So Nebuchad-nezzer sets up a golden image, Cap. 3. So
Nebuchad-nezzers dream, Cap. 4. and Belshassers visions Cap. 5. all these were
written in the Chaldee tongue: the seventh Chapter is only excepted; it is
written also in the Chaldee tongue although it was originally endited to
Daniel: because it is a more clear exposition of the monarchies revealed
before to Nebuchad-nezzer, and Belshasser; and set down in their own
Registers in the Chaldee tongue, but the eight Chapter and the rest, are wholly
written in the Hebrew tongue, which were indicted immediately by God to Daniel,
and not transcribed out of their registers as the rest were: So that part of
Ezra which is written in the Chaldee tongue, is but transcribed and written out
of the decrees, and letters, of the Kings of Media, and Persia; from the
eleventh verse of the fourth Chapter, to the seventh Chapter.

The Chaldeans and Persians used to register, and keep a Chronicle of all
their memorable deeds, and what befell them: and so of their visions and
dreams; and they caused to write them, and interpret them; so did the
Persians, Esth. 9. 32. and Daniel wrote these visions in the Chaldee tongue,
and he set them down for the good of the Church; that they might understand,
that their conditions should be under the Heathish Kings.

The holy Ghost borrowed somethings first from Somethings in the Scriptures
borrowed from the Heathen History.
the Poets, and secondly, from the history of the Heathen; and the Secretaries
of the holy Ghost insert them in the Book of God. From the Poets; as Paul
borrowed from Aratus, Menander, Epimenides or Callimachus, some verses; and
inserted them in his Epistles. So the Scriptures borrow from the history, which
were either Heathenish, or Jewish. Heathenish again, were of two sorts; either
Chaldean or Persian. Daniel borrows from the Chaldeans: So from the history
of the Persians, as that memorable history of the deliverance of the Jews
under Haman; was first written in the Persian language, Esth. 9. 32. and he who
wrote the Book of Esther, borrowed the history out of that book. These things
which are borrowed from the Somethings in the Scripture borrowed from the
Jewish History.
Jewish history; as the facts of those registrate in the Books of the
Maccabees, Heb. 11. So Jude out of the prophecy of Enoch, borrowed the history
of the strife, between Michael and the Devil about the body of Moses. So the
Apostle Heb. 11. out of the traditions of the Jews, borrows, that Esaias was
cut with a saw under Menasse. So there are sundry proverbiall speeches in the
Talmud, as, Cast out the beam which is in thine own eye, and then thou shall
see chearely to cast out the mote that is in they neighbors eye, Matthew. 7. 5.
So it is easier for a Camel to go through the eye of a Needle, Matthew. 19. 24.
So it is hard to kick against pricks, Act. 9. 5. Some of our Divines, to
prove that the Apocryphal Books are not Canonical Scripture, use this midst;
because they are not cited by the Apostles, in the New Testament: but this is
false, for the Apostle cites them, Heb. 11. And Scaliger in his Eusebianis,
proves out of Georgius See Scaliger Eusebius. Page 245.
Cyncellus that the Apostle cites many testimonies out of the Apocryphal
Books, and out of the traditions of the Jews. As Matthew, that Salmon married
Rahab. Salmon, his genealogy is set down, 1 Chro. 2. but not whom he married,
this Matthew had by tradition, Matthew. 1. 5.

Things in the Heathen history, which are not necessary to be known to the
Church: the Scripture passes by them, and remitteth us to Heathen History, and
says still; The rest are they not written in the books of the Chronicles of
Judah and Israel? and when the knowledge of them is necessary to the Church; it
borrows them out of the Heathen history, and inserteth them in the book of
God.

These things which were written out of the Jewish, Heathen sentences were
sanctified by the Apostles when they cited them.
or Heathenish history were not sanctified; until they were insert in the
book of God: therefore Tertullian writing to his Wife, and citing that verse,
Evil speeches corrupt good manners, 1 Cor. 15. 33. says, Memor illius
versiculi sanctificati per Apostolum, the Apostle sanctified this verse when
he borrowed it from the Heathen. And as a woman that was Heathenish, when she
became a Proselyte, she might enter into the congregation, and a Jew might
marry her: so these Jewish and Heathenish histories, God sanctified them, that
they might enter into the Congregation and become holy Scriptures, and so the
holy Spirit sweetened the salt waters of Jericho, that the children of the
Prophets might drink of them, 2 Kings. 2. 21.

There are many proper names set down in the Many names in the Scriptures
which are not Hebrew names.
Scriptures which are not Hebrew names, but some of them are Chaldee, some
Assyrian and some Persicke names, Ier. 39. 3. And all the princes of the King
of Babylon came in, and sat in the middle gate, even Nergal-Sharezer, Samger
Nebo, Sersechim, Rabsaris, Nergal Sharezer, Rahmag, with all the residue of the
Princes of the King of Babylon. And that we may know what names are Chaldee
names, what Syriacke and what Persicke. Mark this Table following, concerning
these names, and the composition of them, taken out of Scaliger.

How shall we discern in what language a book was

There be two special notes whereby we may discern

(...)
book was written in that language, in which the word is interpreted. Example,
Esth. 9. Pur this persicke word is interpreted by the Hebrew goral, therefore
the book was written in the Hebrew, and not in the Persicke tongue by
Mordecai, or by him who else wrote the book. Example 2. Abba Pater, Romans 8.
15. Abba is the Syriack word, and Pater the Greek word, because Abba is
interpreted by Pater, therefore the Apostle has written this Epistle in
Greek, and not in Syriack. And so Thomas is called Didymus; Ioh. 11. 16.
therefore the Gospel of John was written originally in Greek, and (...)
Contracte
not in Hebrew. So Heb. 7. 2. Melchisedeck the King of (...) gemelli. (...)
gemi^us (...).
Salem, first, by interpretation King of righteousness, and after that King of
peace. The word Melchesedeck which is one word, for the understanding of the
Graecising Jews he divides it in two, and shows in Greek, that Act. 13. 8.
Elimas by interpretation Magus, this word Magus is degenerate in a Greek word,
therefore this book was written in Greek.
Salem signifies peace, and Zedek Iustitia, righteousness; as if ye would
say, frugifer, qui fert fructum, cornifer qui fert cornua: here because the
interpretation is in Greek; we may know that this Epistle has been written
originally in Greek.

The second note, to know in what language books have been written, is by the
Allusion of words in the Scriptures. for there are many allusions in the
Hebrew, and in the Chaldee tongue, when they are translated in the Greek or
any other language they loose (...) Elegans Paranomasia apud Th^rg^misto^ inter
Cabhal and Cebhel.
that grace, as Cabhal is (...), and Cebhel is (...), Cobal apud Tergumistos
est caligare, but Ioh. 1. 5. (...). And the light shined in darkness, and the
darkness comprehended it not; Here the sweet allusion which is in the
Chaldee, perishes in the Greek. So Ioh. 10. 1. (...). the Syriacke expresses
it by a (...)
sweet allusion Min tirghna letira, which is not in the Greek, where the words
fall alike which will not fall Elegans paranomasia apua Syros inter tirghna and

out in other languages. There was a question betwixt Origin and Africanus,
whether the history of Susanna was written in Hebrew or in Greek. Africanus
denied that it was written in Hebrew, but in Greek, and he proved it thus.
When Daniel examined the Witnesses who testified against Susanna, he took the
witnesses a part and enquired at one of them, under what tree he saw her
commit that villainy? he said it was (...), the Lentish tree; then Daniel
alluding to this said, (...), The Angel of God has received sentence of God to
cut thee in (...). Divido seco findo
pieces. So he inquired at the other, under what tree he saw her; he answered,
(...), Under a Prime tree. (...). Serra divido seco.
Then Daniel said (...), The Angel of the Lord waited with the sword to cut
thee in two. Africanus by this allusion of words gathered, that this history
was not originally written in Hebrew, but in Greek.

The Conclusion of this is, the Old Testament was first written in Hebrew. This
was the first language Patriarchs, and in which the Angels spoke to men, and
it was the language which all the world spoke before the confusion of Babylon,
and it is the mother tongue from whence many other tongues are derived, and it
is holden by some, to be that tongue, in which we shall speak one to another
in the life to come. Therefore we should be desirous to understand this holy
language.

EXERCITAT. XI.
Of the Style of the Scriptures.

Ioh. 7. 46. Never man spoke like this man.
When we describe a man's speech, first we describe it by that which is
natural, as whether he be (...), of a weak voice, or (...) (...).
of a slow tongue. Secondly, in what language he speaks. Thirdly, in what
Dialect he speaks. Fourthly, whether it be Soluta oration or (...). Fifthly,
the Property of the speech. Sixthly, the Evidence of the speech. Seventhly, the
Fullness of the speech. Eighthly, the Shortness of the speech. Ninthly, the
Coherence, and lastly the Efficacy of the speech.

First, we describe that which is natural, and proceeds from some defect of
the organs, as if he spoke with a weak voice, or be of a stammering tongue, or
thick lips, which Exodus 6. 12, are called Uncircumcised lips: Contrary to
this is a thin lip which is a sign of Eloquence, Job. 12. 20. for these
who have thin lips, commonly are Eloquent. Moses the Penman of the holy
Ghost, although he was defective in speech; yet read his writings, and ye
shall see such The writers of the Scriptures although weak in person yet
powerful in words.
eloquence in him, that no Heathen could ever match it, and as it is said of
Paul, when he was present in person he was weak, 2 Cor. 10. 10. and his speech
base and contemptible yet his letters were weighty and powerful: so whatsoever
want or infirmity was in Moses person, yet there was no want or defect in his
writings.

Secondly, in what language he speaks. The holy Ghost spoke and wrote in
Hebrew in the Old Testament, The Old Testament was written in Hebrew, and the
New in Greek.
and in the New in Greek. He wrote the Old Testament in Hebrew, a language
which had this blessing spoken of in the Law, Deuteronomy. 28. 12. Thou shall lend and
not borrow, so this language lends to many Nations, but borrows of none.
He wrote the New Testament in Greek, a most copious and fertile tongue, The
Hebrew tongue lends to many, but borrows of none.
which was then Lingua communis to the Jews although not vulgaris.

Thirdly, in what Dialect he speaks. The Dialects of the Hebrew tongue were
sundry, first, Dialectus Hierosolymitana, that Dialect which was spoken in
Jerusalem and about it, Ast. 1. 19. (...). In their own (...)
Dialect, or proper tongue. So the Dialect of the Ephramites, who said,
Sibboleth and not Shibboleth, Iud. 12. 6. and the Dialect of the Galileans, as
Peter spoke in the Galilean Dialect, Matthew. 26. 73. So in the new Testament
there are sundry Dialects as Ionick, Dorick Attick, etc.

Fourthly, whether it be in prose or in verse. The Jews divide the Old
Testament according to the style into Charutz; rithmum; Shir carmen, and
Halatza, Orationem solutam, that is prose.

Charuz is Soluta oration, but in five Rithmo colligata; that (...) Rithmus.
is, it begins in prose, but ends as it were in meeter, such is Job.

Shir, canticum; written in meeter, as the Psalms (...) Carmen.
and Canticles.

Hallatza, written in prose; such are the Histories and (...) Oration soluta
the most of the prophets.

Fifthly, the property of the speech. The phrase in Hebrew is much to be
observed, for in the Hebrew it will signify one thing, and in other languages,
another thing.

Example, Number. 19. 20. Dies numeri, signifies A few Dies numeri quid apud
Hebraos.
days, so Homines numeri, Genesis 34. 30. A few men, Deuteronomy. 4. 27. Ezekiel. 12. 16.
So Esaias 10. 19. The rest of the Trees of his Forest shall be number, that a
child may write them, that is, They shall be few. In other languages this
phrase would signify many men, and many trees, etc.

So some phrases of the Scripture have a contrary Some phrases with the
Hebrews have a contrary signification.
signification with the Hebrews, as Zack. 11. 24. Ascendit visio a me, that is,
It perished. So Ier. 47. 15. Moab is spoiled and gone up out of her Cities,
that is, She is destroyed. Sometimes again it signifies to wax and
increase, as 1 King. 22. 35. Bellum ascendit, The battle increased. So Psalm.
74. 23. The tumult that arise up against thee ascends, that is, Increases
continually.

So Levare peccatum is to take off the burden of sin, Exodus 10. 17. and John
alludeth to this, 1. 29. Behold the Lamb of God that takes away the sins of
the world. (...) Lapidare. Elapidare


And Levare peccatum, Is to take up the burden of sin, Levit. 5. 1. So Sakal,
Lapidare and Elapidare, signifies either to cast stones upon a thing, as Deuteronomy.
22. 24. or to take away the stones out of a place, as Esa. 62. 10.

Another example, I am like a drunken man whom the wine has gone over, Ier.
23. 9. that is, whom the wine has overcome, but Matthew. 26. 39. Let this cup
pass over me, that is, let it not touch me; in a contrary signification. So
Genesis 25. 18. Cecidit coram fratribus suis, He dyed in presence of his brethren,
but the Seventie translated it The New Testament uses often times the
Hebraismes of the Old
(...), He dwelt before his brethren.

The New Testament usually follows these Hebraismes of the Old Testament as
Hos. 8. 8. A vessel in which there is no pleasure, Romans 9. 21. A vessel of
dishonor. So 1 Samuel 21. 5. The vessels of the young men are holy, 1 Thessalonians. 4.
4. That ye may know to possess your vessels in holiness. So Exodus 1. 8.
there arose a new King in Egypt who knew not Joseph, Matthew. 11, 11. there
arose not a greater then John the baptist.

So in the New Testament there are many peculiar phrases which are found in no
other Greek writers, and here we must distinguish inter Hellenismum and
Graecismum. Difference betwixt Hellenismus and Graecismus. Hellenismus quid.
Hellenismus is that sort of phrase which the Seventy use, for they translating
the Scriptures for the use of the grecizing Jews, followed the Hebrew Chaldee
and Syriacke in many things: so that they have a peculiar style which is not to
be found in other Greek writers, The Seventy follow the Hebrew, Chaldee and
Syriacke in many things.
example (...) in the New Testament signifies wrath and poison Reve. 18. 3. Ex
vino veneni, that is, poisoned wine. So Job 4. 6. The reason of this is,
because Hbema in the Hebrew, signifies both wrath and (...) ira. venenum.


poison. Another example, 1 Cor. 5. 45. Death is swallowed up into victory: the
Seventy has it (...) In perpetuum, but (...) does not signify perpetuum
amongst the Heathen, why do they then translate it, For ever? because Amos 8.
7. and 2 Samuel 2. 26. Lament. 5. 20.
the word Netzahh, signifies both Victory and Eternity. A third example, Genesis
8. 21. Dixit ad cor suum dominus; (...) Victoria. Aeternitas.


but the Chaldee says, Bemeria (...) which phrase the Evangelist John
follows; but this is not a (...)
phrase used amongst the Greeks. A fourth example, Give us this day, our daily
bread, Matthew. 6. 11. The Greeks say, (...) Panem quotidianum, but the Syriacke
has it (...), Crastinum panem, that bread which may feed us to day and to
morrow. So Iam. 4. 6. The Lord exalts the humble, but according to the Hebrew
and Syriacke phrase, to Exalt, is to lift up on the Cross, Ioh. 8. 28. When
ye have lift up the Son of man, or exalted the Son of man, that is, lifted
him up on the Cross. These particular phrases used by the Seventy would be
marked. And besides these, if we shall look more nearely to the style of the
Scripture, as to the simplicity of it, then we The simplicity of the style of
the Scripture is admirable.
shall much more admire it, 1 Cor. 2. 4. My preaching was not with enticing
words of man's wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit, and of power.

Again the Evidence of the style, the judgments of (...) oculata fides cum
qu^ ipse videt.
God are set down, so vively in the Scripture, as if a man were looking on
with his eyes, this is called (...) by the Greeks, as we may see in the
deludge, the overthrow of Sodom, and the miracles in the Wilderdernesse, set
down so clearly before us, as if we had been eye witnesses of them. See a
notable example, Psalm. 7. 12. 13. By a borrowed kind of speech he sets forth
the judgments of God which were to over take the wicked, as if we were looking
on. If he turn not he will whet his Sword, he has bent his bow, and made it
ready, he has also prepared for him the instruments of death: he has ordained
his arrows against the persecutors.

Eighthly, the Fullness of the speech. The Greeks (...).
call this (...) wherein nothing is wanting, neither in the enumeration of the
parts, or explication of the causes, or reciting of the circumstances: for the
holy The holy Ghost sets down all circumstances belonging to the purpose
whereof he entreats.
Ghost sets down all the circumstances belonging to the purpose. So the
Apostle Romans 1. describes at large the vanity and impiety of the Gentiles. And
Romans 2. the hypocrisy of the Jews, and Cap. 3. he makes a full description
of the corruptions of man, reckoning up the parts. There is none righteous, no
not one, verse. 10. There is none that understands, there is none that seeks
after God, verse. 11. They are all gone out of the way, they are altogether
become unprofitable, there is none that does good, no not one, Verse. 12. Their
throat is an open Sepulcher, with their tongues have they used deceit, the
poison of Aspes is under their lips, Verse. 13. Whose mouth is full of cursing
and bitterness, Verse. 14. Their feet is swift to shed blood, Verse. 15.
Destruction and misery are in their ways, Verse. 16. And the way of peace they
have not known, Verse. 17. And there is no fear of the Lord before their eyes,
Verse. 18.

Ninthly, the Shortness of the speech: and here we cannot enough admire the
fullness of the style and the shortness of it, and that which Cicero said of
Thucycides Every word of the Scripture carries a weight.
may here be applied fitly, Eum esse adeo plenum refertumque rebus, ut prope
verborum numerum, numero rerum exaequet, That every word carried a weight with
it, and therefore we may call it Laconica Scriptura.

Tenthly, the Coherence: all things in the Scriptures are fitly joined and
coupled together. The Heathen All things in the Scripare fitly joined.
said that there were three things unpossible, Eripere, Iovi fulmen, Herculi
clavam and Homero versum; to pull Jupiters Thunderbolt out of his hand,
Hercules Club out of his hand, and a verse from Homer: for they thought, that
there was such a connection between Homers verses, that not one verse could be
taken away without a great breach in the whole work: but this may be much
more said of the Scriptures of God which have such a dependence and connection,
that if ye take away but one verse, the whole shall be marred.

But it may be said that there are sentences which Genesis 48. 7. And as for me
when I came from Padan, Rachel died by me in the Land of Canaan in the way,
when there was but yet a little way to come to Ephrath, and I buried her there
in the way of Ephrath, the same is Bethlehem, Verse. 8. And Israel beheld
Joseph's sons. How does this cohere with that which goes before; it would
seem that there is no dependence here.

They cohere well enough with the words going before; for Jacob had adopted two
of Joseph's children, How sentences in the Scripture seeming to disagree cohere
very well.
then he gives the reason of this adoption in these words; as if he should
say, whereas I might have had more children by my first wife Rachel, if she had
lived; it is great reason that I supply this defect in her, by placing some in
sted of these children, which she might have borne to me; and I adopt those thy
sons since she is dead.

The second place which seems to have no coherence with things going before,
Esa. 39. 21. Take a lump of figs, and lay it for a plaster unto the boil
and he shall recover, verse. 22. Ezekias also had said what is the sign, that I
shall go up into the house of the Lord. What coherence is betwixt these words,
and the words going before?

There is a right coherence here, and he sets down that last, which was
first for brevities cause; which is more at large set down in the book of the
Kings; and therefore Iunius translateth it well, Vajomer, (...)
In plusquam perfecto, Esaias had said.

Ier. 40. 1. The word which came to Jeremiah from the Lord, etc. The words
following seem not to cohere with the former.

The beginning of the fortieth Chapter, with the seventh Godoliah was killed,
the rest of the Jews would have gone into Egypt, which Jeremiah forbids
them to do. And it came to pass ten days after, Chap. 42. 7, etc. This
should be joined with the first Verse of the fortieth Chapter, and all the rest
should be included in a parenthesis.

As we have spoken of the style of the Scripture in general, so let us observe
the style of some of the writers in particular. Esayes style differed much from
the style of Amos, he being a Courtiour, and he but a Neat-herd. So the style
of Ezekiel differed from the style of the rest of the Prophets: he calls
himself The Son of man, not because it is a Chaldee phrase, but because of
the excellent visions which he saw, therefore he is called the Son of man,
that is, an excellent man; as Jesus Christ in the New Testament is called The
Son of man, that is, an excellent man. So this is peculiar to John the
Evangelist, to call Christ the Son of God (...), for the Chaldees and the
Talmud usually call him so: John opposed himself to Ebion and Cerinthus two
Jews who denied the divinity of Christ, wherefore he has usually the word
(...), 1 Ioh. 7. 5. which was frequent in the Chaldee paraphrast, and read
often by the Jews.

So there are some things peculiar to Paul; for he uses some words according
to the manner of the speech in Tarshish and Cilicia, as Collos. 2. 18. (...) in
their language, signifies insidiose alteri praeripere palmam. So 1 Cor. 4. 3.
Man's day according to the phrase of Tarshish, is put for the time of judgment;
because they had some appointed times for judgment.

The Conclusion of this is, here we may admire the Moses was a man of a slow
speech, and of a slow tongue, and Aaron God gave excellent gifts to his
Secretaries, for the good of his Church
must be his spokesman, Exodus 4. Yet Moses was mighty in words and deeds, Act.
7. 22. It is said of Paul that his bodily presence was weak, but his letters
were weighty, 2 Cor. 10. 11. By his preaching he converted many, from Jerusalem
to Illiricum, Romans 15. 19. but by his letters he converted more, both in Europe
Africa and Asia; such Paul converted more by his writing, than by his preaching.
was the majesty and grace in his writing, that they acknowledged it to be from
the Lord.

EXERCITAT. XII.
That the Hebrew Text is not corrupted.

and Greek, holding that they are corrupt in many things.

Master James Gordon our Country man, observes Controvers. 1. Gordonij. cap. 9.
four distinct periods of time. The first period, he makes to be the Jews
Synagogue before Christ came in the flesh; he grants that all this time, the
Hebrew Text was not corrupted by the Jews. The second period of time he makes
to be from the ascension of Christ until the days of Hierome and Augustine,
and he says, that in this second period, the Jews went about to corrupt the
translation of the Seventy: because the Christians then began to use arguments
taken out of that translation against them, as Iustine Martyr testifies,
writing against Tripho. The third period he makes to be after the death of
Saint Hierome, until the time that the Talmud was composed and set together,
and then he says, there arose great contention betwixt the Oriental and
Occidentall Jews: (the Oriental Jews were those who dwelt upon the East side
of Euphrates in Babylon Media and Persia, those What Jews were called
oriental, and what occidentall.
Peter called the Church at Babylon, 1 Pet. 5. 13. The Occidentall Jews were
those to whom he wrote, Scattered abroad in Pontus Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia,
and Bithynia, 1 Pet. 1. 1.) because of the diversity of their reading, and
corruptions in the Text. He says that the Jews met at Tiberias, Anno 508. and
there set down the Points; and made their Masora; to obviat this, that no more
corruption should enter into the Text. The fourth period he makes to be after
the Jews had met at Tiberias; they decreed that none should use any copy, but
such as were corrected by the Masoreth: and so from this time he freeth the
Text from corruption: but he labors much to prove that the Hebrew Text was
corrupt before, and that the vulgar Latin is sound and free from corruption,
which was translated by Saint Hierome under Pope Damasus; and so continued in
the Church of Rome.

The Jews to whom The Oracles of God were committed, The Jews kept faithful
the book of God without corruption.
Romans 3. 2. (therefore it was called Their Law, Ioh. 8. 17.) would they have
corrupted their own Evidents? Augustine calls the Jews Capsarios nostros,
who faithfully kept the book of God, and reserved it unto us without
corruption, and he says, Dispersos esse Iudaeos, infideles ut testarentur
Scripturas esse veras. The unbeleeving Jews were scattered through the world,
that they might testify the Scriptures to be true: and shall we think that
the Jews would have corrupted the Text, The Jews numbered the Verses, Words
and Letters of the Bible.
who have numbered the words, letters, and verses of the Bible: and R. Zaddias
has numbered the letters words and verses, and summed up all the verses at the
end of every book, and they have observed that all the letters are found in
one verse, Zeph. 3. 8. as also four of the final letters: they carry such
respect to the Law, that if it but fall to the ground, they institute a fast
for it.

The superstitious Jews at this day, are so careful to They would write no
language but in Hebrew letters.
keep the letters and words of the Law, that they will have neither Chaldee,

Alexander the Great, having the name Iehova still written in Golden letters,
they were much greeved at it, and when they see any thing changed in our copies
now, in disdain they call it, Hhomesh pesul shel gelahhim, that is,
Pentateuchus rasorum Monachorum, the Pentateuch of the shaven Monks.

The Jews after the death of Christ were dispersed among many Nations and they
never met together again: and albeit they would have corrupted the Scripture,
how could they have falsified all the Copies?

Bellarmin makes this objection to himself. Some Bellarm. lib. 2. Cap. 2. De
verbo dei.
men will say, that the Hebrew Text was corrupted after the days of Saint
Hierome and Augustine. He answers, that Augustins reasons serve for all
times against the corruption of the Hebrew Text: And Serrarius Serrarius in
prolegom. Bibliacis.

and he makes a threefold corruption. The first Physical, the second

and the third Moral. Physical corruption he makes to be this, when it
wants any member which it should have. Mathematical corruption he makes to
be this, when there are some faults in the print which we call (...). And a
moral corruption he makes to be this, when one of purpose goes about to
corrupt the Text, and in effect he comes to this, that the errors which are
found in the Text, are but errors in the print, and not in the matter.

But now lately there is one risen up, called Morinus, who has set himself to
improve the original Hebrew Text, and to prefer the Samaritan to it as the
original.

We must put a difference betwixt Hebraeo-Samaritana Difference betwixt
hebraeo-samaritana, and hebraeo-samaritano-samaritana, in their Copies.
and Hebraeo-samaritano-samaritana. Hebraeo-samaritana is that which Moses
wrote from the Lord and delivered to the Jews, it is called
Hebraeo-samaritana; because the Hebrew was written in the Samaritan Character
at the first and so kept still till after the captivity, and this we grant to
be the first and original writing by which the Church should be ruled.

But that this Hebraeo-samaritano-samaritana should be the first original;
that in no way must we grant, and the reasons are these.

First, the Samaritans were Idolaters they were Reasons to prove that the
Samaritan copy is not the original.
brought out of Assyria by Salmanasses, and they erected a false worship in
Judea, for the which they Ioh. 4. They branded them always with these two
letters, Gnaijn Zain, that is, strange worship. The Lord concredited his
oracles (...) pro (...) cultus alienus.
to his own people, Deuteronomy. 33. 4. The Law is the inheritance of the
congregation of Jacob. Therefore the Law was not committed to their custody,
who were not Gods people, they had no right to his inheritance.

Secondly, if the Samaritan copy were the original, then it should follow
that the Church has wanted the Petrus de Valle brought it from Damascus.

The Samaritan Copy differed as much from the original, as the Seventy do,
but none of them hold that The Samaritan differs as much from the original,
as the Seventy do.
the translation of the Seventy is the original by which all others should
betryed, why then should they give this prerogative to the Samaritan Copy, to
be the original? this Samaritan Copy adds to the original Text which was
The inheritance of the Jews, Deuteronomy. 33. 4. and diminishes also from it. It
adds to the original Text, Josh. 21. two Verses, 36. 37. Verses. So Genesis 4.
it adds a long speech or conference betwixt Cain and Abel which is not in the
original Text. So Targum Hierosolymitanum supplyeth the same 28. verses here,
which are not in the original Hebrew Text, a conference betwixt Gain and Abel,
whether there be any providence of God or not? or whether there be any reward
for the just, or punishment for the wicked? Abel holds the affirmative, and
Cain the negative part. But this note of the Masoreth in the margent should not
be read this ways, Pesu pesuki bimtzegno (...)
pesuk. Viginti octo versus desiderantur in medio hujus versus, There are
twenty eight Verses wanting in the midst of this verse. But it should be read
this ways, Pesukim pasekin bimtzeghnoth pasuk, that is, There are twenty (...)
eight verses whose sense ends in the midst of the verse: therefore when the
Scripture says that Cain talked with his brother, it was to persuade him to
go out to the field, and not that he had a long conference with him. Both the
Samaritan Copy then, and the Targum of Jerusalem wrong the Text as defective,
putting in these 28. verses which the Spirit of God never indicted.

As it adds to the original Hebrew Text, so it diminishes somethings from
it, Hos. 4. 11. I have called my Son out of Egypt. These words are not in the
Samaritan Copy. So these words, Zach. 12. 10. They shall behold him whom they
pierced.

If this Samaritan Copy were the original Copy, what is the reason that
Origin sets it not down in his Octupla, as he has done other
translations? and what is the reason that Hierome never cites it, nor
follows it in his translation, if it be the original?

Fifthly, the manner of the Samaritans writing shows Moses received from the
Lord, and delivered to the people of God afterward, as you may perceive in the
page following, out of Exodus 31. from verse. 12. to 18.

Exemplar Samaritanum.

Exodus 31: 12. And the Lord spoke unto Moses saying 13. Speak thou also unto
the Children of Israel, saying, verily my Sabbaths shall ye keep: for it is a
Sign between me and you, throughout your generations, that ye may know that
I am the Lord that does sanctify you. 14. Ye shall keep the Sabbath
therefore: for it is holy unto you: every one that defiles it, shall surely be
put to death, for whosoever does any work therein, that Soul shall be cut off
from amongst his people, 15. Six days may work be done, but in the Seventh
is the Sabbath of rest, holiness to the Lord, whosoever does any work in the
Sabbath day he shall surely be put to death. 16. Wherefore the Children of
Israel shall keep the Sabbath, to observe the Sabbath throughout their
generations, for a perpetual Covenant. 17. It is a sign between me and the
children of Israel for ever: for in six days the Lord made heaven and earth,
and on the seventh day he rested and was refreshed. Observe the form of this
writing of the Samaritans and ye shall find it to be mere Cabbalisticall, by
which they would find out the diverse readings, in framing the lines, words
and letters, and setting them down after such a curious form, as the
Cabbalists do, by their Gematrija, notaricon, and temura: that is, by the (...)
number of letters, the diverse significations of them, and the diverse
situation and placing of them, they make diverse senses in the Scriptures, as
by elbham, and ethbhash; sometimes putting the last letters for the first, and
the first for the last; sometimes reading up and down; sometimes crosswayes,
and sometimes from the left hand to the right: this we may see in this example
of the Samaritan Copy, where they sum up the observation, the breach, and
punishment of the Sabbath in a round circle; which curiosity the Spirit of God
never used in writing the holy Scriptures.

Christ speaking of the original Text, and the perpetuity of the Law which we
have, he says, One jote, or one title of the Law shall not pass, in the
original it is, (...) answerable to the Hebrew Iod; and (...), which is not
properly translated, A tittle, as if it made a difference betwixt some letters,
as the top of Daleth from Resh: for the Syriacke calls it Sharat, incisura

incisio, the small lines which are in ones hand. The meaning is then, that not
one part of a letter, neither the least letter, nor any part of the least
letter shall perish, hence we may reason from Christ's words. In that copy
whereof the Lord speaks, (...) or Iod must be the least letter; but in the
Samaritan copy Iod is not the least, but the biggest of all the Letters:
therefore the Samaritan copy, is not that copy which Christ spoke of, but the

the Letters in the margent here: hence we may gather that this Samaritan

time, and therefore we ought neither to embrace the copy nor the Characters,
as authenticke or original.

The Conclusion of this is, If the light that is in the body be darkness, how
great is that darkness, Matthew. 6. 23. The Scriptures are the light of the
Church, and if the original Text were corrupted, how great were the darkness
of the body; God has Conjuncta instrumenta, Instrumenta gratiae. conjuncta.
remota,


and remota instrumenta gratiae. Remota instrumenta gratiae are the Preachers
and their writings, and they may be corrupted. But Conjuncta instrumenta
gratiae are the Prophets and Apostles and their writings, these the Lord kept
from error and corruption for the good of his Church.

EXERCITAT. XIII.
That no Canonical book is perished.

Matthew. 5. 18. Heaven and earth shall pass, one jote, or one tittle shall no
ways pass from the Law till all be fulfilled.
WHen a thing wants an essential part, this is the greatest want. Secondly,
when it wants an integrall part, this is likewise a great defect. And
thirdly, when it wants accidental ornaments. When Defectus partis
essentialis. partis integratis ornamenti accidentalis.


the soul is separated from the body, here is a separation of the essential
parts. When a man wants a hand or a foot, then he wants an integrall part.
And when he wants his clothes, he wants some ornaments.

There is no book in the Scripture that wants any No book in the Scripture
wants any essential part.
essential part; for the Law and the Gospel which are essential parts, are
found in every book.

Secondly, the Scripture wants no integrall part Vide Iunium in Iudam, and
Perkins reformed Catholic.
since the Canon was sealed, before the Canon was sealed they had as much as
served for their infancy: but after that it was sealed the whole Canon was
complete, and none of those Books perished.

Great was the care which the Lord had to preserve Gods care in preserving the
Scriptures.
the Scriptures. First, he commanded the Levites to take the book of the Law
written by Moses, and to put it in the side of the Arc of the covenant of the
Lord, Deuteronomy. 31. 26.

Secondly, the Lord commanded the King, when he should sit upon the Throne of
his kingdom to write a Copy of this Law, Deuteronomy. 17. 18. and the Jews add
further, that he was bound to write out two copies, one which he should keep
in his treasury, and another which he should carry about with him; and they
say moreover, if Printing had been found out then, yet he was bound to write
them out with his own hand.

Thirdly, the Lord commanded the Prophets to write their visions upon Tables,
and to make them plain, Habak. 2. 2. Esaias 8. 1. and the Seventy read it, to be
graven (...) vocant Graeci.
upon the bush tree, which is a sort of wood that corrupts not, and it will
preserve that which is written upon it and it were to the worlds end.

Fourthly, when any book which was necessary for Books necessary for the
Church albeit lost, yet they were found again.
the use of the Church was lost; the Lord had a care that that book should be
found again, as the book of the law found by Hilkiah, 2 King 22. 8. Or the
Lord endited it a new again, when it was lost; as when Iehojakim cut the roll
of the lamentations of Jeremy, yet the Lord inspired him a new again to
indite this book to his Scribe Baruch, Iere. 36. 32. because he thought it
necessary still for the Church: therefore he would not have it to perish.

Fifthly, in that general destruction which the Babylonians made at Jerusalem,
burning their houses, and robbing them of their goods; yet as Hierome and Basil
observe well, it was a special providence of God that The Israelites kept the
musical instruments in the captivity, to put them in mind of the worship of
God.
they should leave to those captives, their instruments of Music, wherewith
they used to serve God in the Temple: that they might preserve some memory of
their former worship, they brought these instruments to Babel with them, Psalm.
137. 2. we hung our harpes on willowes. If the Lord had such a care of these
instruments to have them preserved for his praise, much more care had he to
have the Scriptures preserved; which taught them to worship: and he who had a
particular care of the parts of the Scripture, before it was complete, and
numbreth the hairs of our heads, Matthew. 10. 30. and the stars of the
heavens, Psalm. 147. 4. will he not have a special care that none of these
Books should perish which are canonical?

That fable of Esdras then is to be rejected, lib. 4. The fable of Esdras
rejected.
cap. 4. 23. So cap. 14. 21. to the 24. verse, he shows how the book of God
was lost in the Captivity, and that Esdras the Scribe, by holy inspiration
wrote it all anew again: but this is false, see we not how Daniel read out of
the prophecy of Jeremy, how long the captivity should last, Dan. 2. 9. The
book of God then was not lost in the captivity, and written anew again by
Esdras, but only he set the books in order after Esdras wrote nothing of the
Scriptures but only set the books in order.
the captivity, and nihil ad (...) fecit sed ad (...). He did nothing in
correcting the book of God, but only set it down in order.

But we read often times in the Scriptures of many Books wanting now, which
were extant before; as the Books of the battles of the Lord, Number. 21. 14.

By this it cannot be inferred that any canonical Sepher, signifies a (...)
relation, as well by word, as by write. Secondly, although we grant that it
was a written book, yet it will not follow that it was a holy Book. Thirdly,
although we grant that it was an holy book, yet it will not follow that it was
a canonical book. The books of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah and
Israel were but civil records, and belonged nothing to the canon of the
Scriptures. Some things written by the Prophets not as they were Prophets.


Secondly, some books that were written by the Prophets, were not written by
them as they were Prophets. Solomon wrote of Herbs, Trees and Plants, 1 King.
4. 33. But what books were these? They were but books of things which were
under the Moon and of things corruptible, and because they served not for the
edification of the Church afterward, therefore the Hezekiah buried Salomons
books of physic.
Lord suffered them to perish. Suidas says, that the book which Solomon wrote
of Physic, was affixed upon the gate in the entry of the Temple; and because
the people trusted too much in it, neglecting the Lord (as Asa put his trust in
the Physicians, 2 Chro. 13.) therefore Hezekiah caused to pull away this book,
and bury it. And the Talmud says, that Hezekiah did two (...)
memorable things. First, Ganaz Sepher rephuoth. Abscondit librum medicinarum,
He hid the books of Physic which Solomon had written. And secondly, Cathath
nahhash hannehhushoth shegnashe Moshe, Comminuit aeneum (...)
serpentem quem fecerat Moses, He brake the brazen Serpent which Moses made.

Solomon spoke three thousand Proverbes, 1 King. 4. 32. yet of all these
Proverbes scarce eight hundred are put in the Canon. Some of these Proverbes
the servants of Hezekiah King of Judah copied out, Prove. 25. 1. And as they saw
the King their master bury Salomons book, which he knew was hurtful to the
Church: so those servants copied out these Proverbes which were profitable
Salomons Proverbs and Songs, which were not profitable to the Church perished.
for the Church, whereas the rest perished. So Solomon wrote a thousand and
five Songs; of all which Songs, the Lord made choice but of one to be insert
in the Canon, which is called the Song of Songs, or canticum (...) est
utriusque numeri quae vel quod.
canticorum quae Salomonis rather then canticum canticorum quod Salomonis, it
was the most excellent Song of all Salomons Songs, rather then the excellentest
Song compared with other Songs.

But all books written by the^ for the whole Church none of them are perished:
as the Prophesies of Nathan Ahija, and Iddo. For Burgensis observes well upon,
1 Chro. 29. That the first book of Samuel is holden to be written by Samuel
himself. So the second Book of Samuel, and the second book of the Kings were
written by Nathan and Gad, who lived with David and Solomon, and wrote until
the death of Solomon, then Iddo and Ahija wrote the history following of
Jeroboam interlacing somethings of Solomon and Rehoboam.

1 Chronicles. 29. 29 Now the acts of David the King, first and last behold they are
written in the book of Samuel the Seer, and in the book of Nathan the
Prophet; and in the book of Gad the Seer, with all his reign and his might
and the times that went over him, and over Israel and all the Kingdoms of the
Countries. But these words cannot be understood of the books of Samuel; for
we read not in these books, what David did abroad in these Countries:
therefore some other books must be understood here, written by Gad and Nathan,
which are not extant.

Not only the things, which David did in Israel, are Samuels but also the
things which he did abroad in other Countries, as against Zoba King of
Hadadezzar, against the Moabites, and against Tobh King of Hemath. And where it
is said over Hieron. in Esa. 13.
all the kingdoms of the countries, it is the manner of the Scripture (as
Hierome marketh) by the whole Countries, to understand the next adjacent
countries whereof it speaks; and therefore in the original it is,
Haaratzoth, (...)
Of that earth.

2 Chro. 33 19. The prayer of Manasseh and how God was entreated of him, and
all his sin, and his trespass and the places wherein he built high places,
and set up groves and graven images before he was humbled: behold they are
written among the saying of the Seers, or Hosai. But in the whole book of the
Kings there is no mention made of his affliction, or of the cause which moved
him to repent or of his prayers which he made to God in time of his affliction:
then this book of the prophet is not now extant. So the acts of Baasha, Zimri,
and Omri are they not written in the Books of the Chronicles of Israel, 1
Kings 16. 5. and 27. But nothing concerning their acts are found in the books
of the Kings, or in the Chronicles: therefore those books are perished, when
the Scriptures remit us to those books, it gives us to understand that these
books are worthy to be trusted, as written by the Seers of God: neither does
the Scripture cite them, as it does some short sentences out of the Heathen
Poets. The Apostle says of those Poets, that they said the truth, Tit. 1. 13.
But the Spirit of God remitteth us to these books, that we may be fully
instructed by them in the whole truth of the Acts of those Kings.

First we must know that there were many Prophets Some prophesies of the
Prophets were not written.
days of Eli, to David, as some of Asaph Heman and Ieduthun. Secondly, all the
things which were written by the Seers, were not written by them as Seers:
Solomon wrote many things, which he wrote not as a Prophet, and so did David.
Thirdly, many things which Somethings written by the Prophets profitable for
the Church then, but not profitable now.
they wrote then as Seers, and were profitable to the Church for that time,
were not profitable for the Church now: and the Spirit of God remitted them
then to the civil records and to some prophesies which were then extant, but
are perished now; because now they were not necessary for the Church: but all
these things which the Lord endited to them by his Spirit and which he thought
to be necessary for his Church, to be the Canon and rule of our faith, all
those the Lords watchful eye has kept and preserved, that none of them are
perished.

The Conclusion of this is: The books of Emperors Judah and Israel, both in
whole and in parts, although they were but Shepherds, and banished men. And the
Church would rather spend her best blood, then she would part with that
precious Jewel or any part of it: therefore they called those who delivered
the book of God to the persecuting Tyrants, Traditores.

EXERCITAT. XIIII.
That the points were not originally with the Letters from the beginning.

Neh. 8. 8. So they read in the Book, the Law of God distinctly, and gave the
sense, and caused them to understand the reading of the Law.
WE have shown that the Scriptures are not corrupt, and that no essential or
integrall part is wanting in the holy Scriptures: Now it rests to show that
the Points, the accidental ornaments were not from the beginning.

The Jews who are faithful keepers, but bad interpreters of the Scriptures,
interpret these words, Nehe. 8. 8. after this manner, vaijkreu bassepher
betorath, They read in the book of the Law, this they expound, to be (...)

that is, he added the Kabbala. But this is a false Gloss, Ezra read the Law
to them, and gave them not only the grammatical sense, but also the
spiritual and true meaning of the words; he neither added points nor Targum,
or Kabbala to it. The points were not then from the beginning, as may be seen
by these reasons following.

The first reason is taken from the Samaritan Character. The Jews acknowledge
that the letters of the law Moses wrote the Law. But to these ancient
Characters there is no vowell subjoyned as we may see in the form of the
Shekell set down by Arias Montanus, Beza, and Villalpand upon Ezekiel.

The second reason is taken from the first exemplar (...).
book, which is the chief book in their estimation, and whereof they account
more then of any other Hebrew Bible; yet there is neither Point nor Accent in
this book, but only Consonants. This may be seen also in their ancient
bills of divorce wherein are neither Points nor Accents: Therefore the Points
were not from the beginning.

The third reason is taken from the names of the

But they who maintain that the Points were from

As the Months were from the beginning, and had

The fourth reason is taken from the translation of the Seventy: for when the
Seventy read the Hebrew Text wanting the Points, they differed very far from
the Hebrew in many things. The difference of their reading arose from this;
because the Hebrew Text wanted (...) baculus. (...) l^ctus.
the Points. Example, Genesis 47. 31. and Israel bowed himself, gnal rosh
hamitta, upon bis beds head. But the Apostle follows the translation of the
Seventy translating it, He bowed upon the top of his rod, Heb. 11. 21. So (...)
Volumen. (...) caput, cranium.
Psalm. 40. 7. for Megilla the Seventy read gilgoleth, in capite libri, for in
volumine libri: because they wanted the Points, and the Apostle followed this
reading.

The fifth reason is taken from, Ketibh volo keri, when (...)
diversity of reading and writing arose because the letters wanted the Points
from the beginning: this made them to read one way and write another way.

The Chaldee, Arabian, and Assyrian language, which

The seventh reason is taken out of the Talmud. They Ioab killed his master,
because he taught him to read Zacar Masculus, for Zecer Memoria, and so made
(...) masculus (...) memoria.
him to spare the females of the Amalekites, whereas he should have blotted
out their memory and killed them all. Now if the points had been from the
beginning, then Ioabs master could not have taught him, to have read Zacar for
Zecer.

The Points were not from the beginning then, but found out afterward by the
Masorath.

There were three sorts of teachers, amongst the Jews. The first was (...),
who gathered the (...) vel
traditions of the Fathers together; such were the Pharisees. The second were
the Sopherim afterward called the Masoreth: these observed the letters and
words (...)
in the reading. The third sort were the Midroseth, the (...)
Cabbalists, who expounded the Scriptures allegorically. The Scribes were from
Moses time, who taught the people to read the Law, because the Law wanted the
Points: and Christ calls these The learned Scribes, and says to one of them;
How read thou? Luke 10. 26. But afterward Shammai and Hellel were the first
of the Shammai and Hillel the first of the Sects of the Scribes and Pharisees.
Scribes and Pharisees, who were the original of these sects. Shammai was the
first of these Scribes who drew out the Cabbalisticall readings, and Hillel was
the first who gathered their traditions together.

Because the Text wanted the Vowels before the Masorets time, hence arose these
diverse readings marginall and Textuall; here we must take heed of two
errores. The first is of those who hold, that both the Two errors to be shunned
concerning the Marginall and Text reading.
Textuall and Marginall reading were from the beginning, and both authenticke
and original from Moses. The second error which we must shun, is this, that
the marginall reading implies some corruption, where as it serves for
illustration of the Text.

There is but small difference betwixt the Marginall and the line reading.
There are three sorts of reading. The first is (...), when there is no
difference at all in (...).
the words. The second is (...) when there is some small difference in the
reading. And the third is (...), when there is a contrary reading. Now for
(...).
(...), we may see it in the original Text it self, as 2 Samuel 22. and Psalm.
18. the same argument is handled almost word by word in both these places,
there is some diversity of words only: for 2 Samuel 22. 43. It is Adikem, I did
stamp them as the mire of the streets, but (...) a (...) Evacuare. (...) a
(...) Comminuere. (...) mutatur in (...)
Psalm. 18. 42. it is Arikem, I did cast them out as the mire in the streets.
Here is but small difference, Daleth is only changed into Resh, the sense is
all one. So 2 Samuel 22. 11. and Psalm. 18. 11. So 2 Samuel 22. 27. and Psalm. 18.
26. So 2 Samuel 22. 8. and Psalm. 18. 9. here is (...), but The Marginall and the
Text reading make not a contrary but a diverse reading.
not (...). So the Marginall reading, and the Text reading makes not a contrary
reading, but a diverse reading: therefore ye shall see that the Translaters
follow sometimes the Marginall reading in their first translations, as Iunius 2
King 8. 10. in his first translation, (...) illi. (...) non.
he says abi, dic ei, but in this second translation he says, abi, dic non,
So Ezr. 4. 2. In his first edition, sacrificabimus eidem which is the marginall
reading, but (...) fecit. (...) december.
in his second translation, non sacrificabimus alt eri which is in the Text.
Example, 3. 1 King 22. 49. Iehosaphat prepared shipes, Gnasha fecit; but in his
second translation Translaters sometime join both the marginall and text
reading together.
Iehosaphat made december naves which is in the Text. So Prove. 31. 4. Eccles. 3.
4. Ier. 2. 20. and 5. 8. He follows Ketibh in his last Edition, that is, as
it is written and not read in all these places. And sometimes ye shall see
them, join both the Marginall and Text reading together. Psalm. 22. 17. They
Lion like dug. So the Chaldee Paraphrast and the Seventie reads it. So
Iunius* (Exodus 21. 8. If she please not her Master who has not betrothed her
unto himself, non sibi) joyneth (...) non sibi. (...) voluit est ketibh (...)
custodivit est keri
lo, lo, both together, both the Text and Marginall reading. So Josh. 8. 12.
The line reading has gnir, vrbs, and the Marginall reading has Hai, and he
joyneth them both together vrbs Hai. So Prove. 23. 26. Let thine eyes observe my
ways. Ratza, and Natzar, he joyneth them both together, studiose custodivit.
So Eze. 22. 16. They join them both together. So 1 King. 22. 18. the Tigurin
joyneth them both together* (...) The Masoreth put the vowels some times in the
text, and the consonants in the margent. (...)
and the English join them both together, Prove. 19. 7. They are wanting to him.

In these diverse readings set down by the Masoreth, sometimes the Points are
put in the Text and the Consonants in the Margent, as Ier. 31. 39. Behold the
day says the Lord. Here is a blanke in the Text, the vowels are only set
down and the word Baim, is understood by the Points of it, which are in the
Text, and so it is Baim, although it be not expressly written in the Text. The
reason why they set the consonants in the Margent and the vowels in the Text,
was to signify, that they inclined rather, to follow the Marginall reading
than the Text, and yet not to exclude the Text reading: therefore they set the
vowels in the Text.

Again, when the Masoreth think that some words The Masoreth put not points
to a word which they think does redound.
abound, they set down the Consonants of the word in the Text, but they point
not the word, which they would have to be be omitted, Example, Ier. 51. 3.
Against (...)

And thus the Masoreth keep us that we go not amiss, and their observations
are a hedge to the Law: therefore the Jews say, Sejag (...)
lahhochma shethea, Silence is the hedge of wisdom, for when a man holds
his peace he is then thought to be wise. So they say Megnasheroth sejag
legnosher, (...)
Tithes are the hedge of our riches, and therefore pay thy Tithes and be rich.
So Nedarim sejag liphrishoth, vows are the hedge of the first fruits. Lastly,
they (...)
say, Masoreth sejag latora, that the Masoreth is the hedge to the Law. By

for the preserving of the Law from corruption.

by the right sense of the Scripture. When it is objected to us by the Church

of Rome that we have not the true meaning of the Scriptures, because of our
diverse translations: Our Divines answer, that these diverse translations make
not diverse senses in the Scriptures; for the sense is still one and the same:
but these diverse translations help us only, to come to the true meaning of
the Scriptures, and so we must use these marginall and line readings, as we use
these interpretations. When we see a blanke left in the the Text, and supplied
in the Margent; this adds nothing to the Text, as a word added sometime by a
translatour, adds nothing to the Text: So when the Masoreth puts another
word in the Margent, A word set down for explanation adds nothing to the
text.
which is not in the Text; that word is set down only for explanation, and it
adds nothing to the Text. We take up the meaning of the Text, by the
antecedent, The meaning of the text is known by the antecedent and consequent.
and consequent. Example, Prove. 4. 3. Tender and young was I, Liphni, before my
Mother; but in the Margent it is, Tender and young was I, Libhni, amongst the
Sons of my Mother: for Solomon had more brethren 1 Chronicles. 3. 6. But these
readings may stand, he was tender and young (...)
before his Mother, and best beloved of all his Mothers Sons.

The Conclusion of this. A certain Jew gave God thanks for four things.
First, that he was a Jew and Jerusalem and not at Pambiditha. Thirdly, that he
said Shibbeth and not Sibboleth. Fourthly, that he needed not ex Tihni-deni.
cap. 7*
the helps of Tiberias, meaning the Points and Accents. But we who are not
natural Jews should be thankful to God; because we have these helps to
further us in the reading.

EXERCITAT. XV.
Of the means which God uses to make the Scripture plain unto us.

1 Cor. 14. 11. If I know not the meaning of the voice, I shall be to him that
speaks a Barbarian, etc.
THere are three special means by which God makes the Scriptures plain unto
us. The first is translation of the Scripture. The second is paraprasing Three
special means for making the Scriptures plain.
of the Scripture, and the third is the interpretation of the Scripture.

In the Translation of the Scripture consider, first, What things are necessary
for translation.
what is a Translation. Secondly, the necessity of translation. Thirdly, what
things a Translator should observe, and what things he should shun. Fourthly,
who they were who translated the Scriptures. Fifthly, the authority of the
translation of the Seventy. Sixthly, the authority of the vulgar Latin
translation.

First, what is a translation. We translate when we What is translation.
change out of one language into another, and it is called (...) or (...). If
the Translator consider the words a part, then it is called (...) or (...),
there is great force in the words, and therefore the Translatour must observe
them. Plato was wont to call Socrates, (...), seu obstetricem; because when he
sought out the words, then he brought forth the truth.

Secondly, let us consider the necessity of Translation The necessity of
translation proved by sundry reasons.
without a Translation we can not understand a strange language, but it is
barbarous to us.

Reasons proving the necessity of translation.

First, when the old testament has words altogether unknown to the Jews, it
uses to interpret them. Example, Words in the old Testament, unknown to the
Jews, are interpreted.
Purim was a Persicke word unknown to the Jews; therefore the Holy Ghost
interprets it, calling it a Lot. So the Evangelists writing, in Greek, and
having sundry Hebrew and Chaldee words, they expound them in Greek as Siloe,
that is, sent, Ioh. 9. 7. Abba interpreted by Pater, Romans 8. So Tabitha kumi,
by interpretation, Daughter arise, Mark. 5. 21. So Thomas called Didymus. See
Mark. 7. 34. and Act. 1. 27. and Revela. 1. 7. amen by nai, So Abaddon be
(...), Reve. (...).
9. 11. So Rabboni by Master, Ioh. 20. 16. why does the holy Ghost interpret
these names? but to teach us that he would have the Scriptures translated into
known tongues, that the people might understand them.

Why does the holy Ghost interpret Elymas by Magus, Act. 13. 8. But Elymas the
Sorcerer (for so his name is by interpretation) withstood them, Seeing all
translations should be in a more known tongue, but Magus, is as obscure as
Elymas?

Magus was first a Persicke word, but afterward it Elymas was but a part of
Persia, so called from Elam the son of The Persians are called Elamites.
Sem: therefore the Persians are called Elamites, Act. 2. and Luke interprets
Elymas by Magus, as by that which was well enough known to the Jews, and to
us now; for we take Magus commonly for a Magitian: (...) magus a (...) formare
vel fingere.
the Arabic* translateth Magus, by Hhartom, from Hharat, fingere or formare;
because the Magitians draw figures and circles when they conjure.

Why is the prayer of Christ upon the Cross set Eli, Eli, lama sabacthani,
Matthew. 27. 46.

The Evangelist does this, that we may perceive the Why the prayer of Christ
upon the cross is set down in Hebrew.
bitter mock that the Jews used against Christ, saying, He calls upon
Elias, for in no other language the mock will so appear.

Secondly, it was a curse pronounced against the people of God, when the Lord
should send strangers against Unknown tongues were a curse pronounced against
the people of the Jews.
them who should speak unto them in an unknown tongue, Esa. 28. 11. So it is
a curse to the Church, as the Apostle applies it, to speak to the people the
mysteries of their salvation in an unknown tongue, 1 Cor. 14. 21.

The Lord at the Pentecost gave the gift of tongues to the Apostles, that they
might speak to the people Every man heard them speak in his own language,
Act. 2. 6. And to some he gave the tongues, but not the interpretation of
them; but lest the people should not understand these languages, he gave God
gave the gift of tongues to some, and to others he gave the interpretation of
them.
to others the gift of interpretation, 1 Cor. 12. 10. but the Church of Rome
studieth of purpose to keep the Scriptures in an unknown tongue, and
thinks, that thereby the minds of the people are more affected and stirred
up to devotion.

The third thing to be considered in a translation is A Translator must take
heed, ex quo, and in quod vertit.
what a Translator should observe and what he should eschew in his
translation. A Translator must observe Ex quo vertit and in quod vertit, or
Terminus a quo and terminus ad quem, and he must consider first the sense, and
then the words; he must look first to the sense and see that he carry it with
him, and next to the words; and He must have the worth of the words in his
translation.
look for the worth of their wares in Money: So should a Translator in his
translation see that he have the worth, or meaning of the sense in his
Translation, he must consider first the aptness of the phrase into which he
is to translate it, and he is not (...) A Translator should consider the
aptness of the phrase.
servilly to follow it. Example, the Hebrew says, I will multiply thy seed as
the sand upon the lip of the Sea, Genesis 22. 17. But our language says upon
the Sea shore. So the Hebrew says we must not eat with common hands, but we
say, with unwashen hands: now in this metaphrase changing one phrase into
another, the Translator must take good heed.

Secondly, where the sense bears it a Translator may A Translatour may add a
word where the sense bears it.
add a word without any hurt to the Text. The original Text it self,
affects sometime more brevity and in other places supplyeth this brevity. As,
2 Samuel 6. 6. Vzzia put fourth to the Arc, it is expounded more at large, 1 Chronicles. 13. 9. He put forth his hand to the Arc, So 2 Chronicles. 10. 9. is
expounded by 2 Chronicles. 13. 9. At more length. The holy Ghost adds a word for
illustation where the sense bears it, Deuteronomy. 27. 26. Cursed be he that
confirms not all the words of this Law to do them; But the Apostle Galat. 3.
10. Cursed is every one that continues not in all things which are written in
the book of the Law to do them. So a Translator may add a word for
illustration when the sense bears it, Genesis 3. Have thou eaten of the tree of
which I forbad thee to eat? the Seventy add, Have thou eaten of the tree
which I (only) forbad thee to eat.

When Christ Mark. 5. 4. interprets tabitha kumi arise daughter, how adds
he here, (...) tibi dico?

He does not this as an interpreter, but to show the power and authority of him
who speaks; and therefore

A Translator must add nothing of his own in his A Translater must not add
of his own to the text.
translation, Exodus 16. 15. The vulgar translation adds something which is
not in the original: when the children of Israel saw it, they said one to
another, what is this? These words (what is this) are not the words of the holy
Ghost: for Man signifies, prepared or ready, and therefore (...) interrogat
apud Chaldaeos, sed non apud Hebraeos.
it should be interpreted, this is ready or prepared meat. So Exodus 12. 11.
they translate Phase, id est transitus, it should not be translated, id est
transitus, but transitus, it is the Lords Passover.

A Translator must not affect (...), that is, newness (...), is an affecting
of new words.
of words: those do contrary to that of Solomon, Prove. 22. 28. Remove not the
ancient marks which thy fathers have set. This was the fault of Castalio who
translated Sequester, for Mediator, Genius, for Angelus, Infundere, for
Baptizare, Histrio, for Hypocrita, Respublica, for Ecclesia, When the matter
requires, a new word may be used in a translation.
and such. We are not so bound to words, but when the matter requires, a new
word may be used. Nicephorus tells of Spiridion, when he heard the word
(...), read for (...); he rose and went out of the Church in a chafe: so
another could not abide Cucurbita, for Hedera, Jonas 4. 6. Esa. 45. 9. Woe be
to him that striveth with his Maker: let the potsheard strive with the
potsheards of the earth. Hierome has it, testa de Samijs, he translated it
terra Samiae; there is not such a word in the original, neither were these
vasa Samiae, in use, in the days of the Prophet; yet because these vessels
(...), is he who hunteth for strange words that is not in use.
were in use in his time, he uses it in his translation: neither can he be
thought to be (...) a hunter of new words for this. So Nahum 3. 8. Art thou
better than No. But Hierome translateth it, art thou better than Alexandria:
because in his time No was called Alexandria: being built anew by Alexander.

A Translatour must not use a great circuit of words, (...), pigmenta
oratoria, the flowing speeches of Orators.
or the floorishing speeches of Rhetoric in his translation; for as men
pouring wine out of one Vessel into another, take heed that the vent be not
too

Words that are transeunt, passing and received in (...).
all languages should not be translated: as Sabbath, Amen, Halleluia, Hosanua.
So Iam. 5. 4. and the cries of them which have reaped, are entered into the
ears of the Lord of Sabbath. For as some sort of coin passes in all
countries so do some words. Secondly, some words which come not originally
from the Hebrew but from the Greek, yet they should be kept still
untranslated, as Phylacterie, Tetrach and such.

There are many Latin words which are made Many Latin words made Greek in
the new Testament.
Greek in the New Testament, and these are to be translated. For as Daniel
borrowed some words from the Ionians who dwelt in Asia minor and made Chaldee
words of them, as sabucha from sambucha an instrument which they played upon.
Angaria a Persicke word made Greek, Matthew. 5. 41. So Gazophylacium, all these
Latin words which are made Greek, should be translated.
should be translated: So the Latin words which are made Greek should be
translated, as (...) Census, Matthew. 17. 25. (...) Centurio, quadrans (...),
Matthew. 5. 26. So Colonia (...), Act. 16. 12. So custodia (...), Matthew. 26. So
Legio, linteum, Macellum, membrana, modius, praetorium, (...), Matthew. 27.
sudarium, Luke 19. 20. Spiculator, Matthew. 6. 27. Semieinctum, Act. 19. 12. and
Sicarius, Act. 21. 38. All these should be translated.

Words appropriate should not be translated to any (...)
other use, but unto the use, to which they are appropriated. Example, Rachab
received into her house (...). A Translator cannot translate it Angels (because
that word is appropriated to the blessed Angels) but Messengers. Example 2.
Phil. 2. 25. Epaphroditus, (...), a Translator cannot translate it your Apostle
(for that word is appropriated to the the Apostles) but your Messenger. So Act.
19. 23. (...), a Translator cannot translate it, The Church was confused,
because this word Church is appropriated to the meeting of the Saints of God
for his worship; but only, The assembly was confused.

So words not appropriat should not be appropriat Words not appropriate should
not be appropriate.
as the Church of Rome do appropriat this word Synagoga to the Old Testament,
and Ecclesia to the New Testament; but Synagoga is said of the Church of the
New Testament, and Synagoga and Ecclesia are promiscuusly taken. So this word
(...) should not be translated Gods Clergy, but Gods inheritance, 1 Pet. 5.
3. This word which is common to all Gods people, should not be appropriated to
a few.

Words that are degenerate, we cannot use them in a Words degenerate, should
not be used in a translation.
translation. Example, 1 Cor. 14. 16. He that occupies the room (...), it
cannot be translated Idiot here (unless we would beg them for fools,) but
Unlearned. So the word (...) is a degenerate word in our language, and taken in
an evil sense, we cannot translate it, the Magitians came from the East, but
the Wise men came from the East, Matthew. 2. 1, So (...) should not be Vide
Rainoldum contra Heart.
translated Priest, for the word Priest now is taken for a sacrifycing Priest:
and God himself would not be called Baal, but ishi because Baal was a word
degenerate and given to Idols, Hos. 2. So (...) at the first was he that had
the charge of the corn which the Latins called Epulo, but now both are
degenerate. So should not a degenerate word be used in a translation.

Words that are proper should not be translated as Words that are proper, are
not to be translated as appellatives.
appellatives or contra, 2 Samuel 23. 8. The Tachmonite that sat in the seat

11. Iashobeam an Hachmonite, the chief of the Captains he lift up his Spear

27. 2. And therefore should not be translated, he sat in judgment. So Adino
and Eznite (...) gratum erat huic hastato.
are not proper names, but are to be translated thus, His delight was to lift
up his spear against three hundred. So Josh. 14. 15. The Vulgar translation
has it thus, This is Adam who was buried amongst four. Adam here is an
appellative name and not proper; therefore the article He, is put before it.
Secondly, he adds Situs est, which (...)
is not in the original. Thirdly, he translateth Arba, Four, which is a proper
name here* and hence came that fable, that four men and their wives are buried
there, Adam and Eve, Abraham and Sara, Isaac and Rebekah, and Jacob and Lea. So
Act. 19. 9. Schola Tyranni, cannot be translated, in the School of a Tyrant,
but In the School of Tyrannus, because it is not an appellative but a proper
name.

Words that are Mediae significationis, a Translator (...).
must take heed how he translateth the^. Example 1. Esa. 3. 2. I will take away
your Kosem from you. The Translator cannot translate it here, your Soothsayer
but your Prudent. (...)
So Ioshu. 13. 22. Balaam also the son of Beor the Kosem, did the children of
Israel slay. It cannot be translated, Balaam the Prudent, but Balaam the
Soothsayer.

Another example gnarum is called subtle or crafty and also prudent or wise,
Genesis 3. 1. the Serpent was gnarum, (...)
it cannot be translated, More wise than any beast of the field; but More
crafty and Prove. 1. 4. It cannot be said to give Subtlety, but Wisdom to
the simple. So Matthew. 10. 16. It cannot be said, be ye Crafty as Serpents,
but Wise as Serpents.

A third example, Sheol signifies both the grave and hell; when it is set
down without He locale, then it ever Vide Simeon, de Muis, in Psalm. 9. (...)
locale. (...) et*
signifies the grave, but when He locale, is put to it, and the godly, are
said to go Lesheolah, then it signifies the lowest grave, as Psalm. 86. 13.
But when Sheol has He (...) quomodo differunt.
locale joined to it, and the wicked are said to go Lesheolah, then it
signifies the Hell, and it should be translated, They went down to hell, Number.
16. 30.

A fourth example, Pethi is taken in an evil sense for (...)
Foolishness, as Prove. 1. 22. and in a good sense for Simplicity, as Psalm.
116. 6.

Words (...) (and as the Jews say (...) vel (...).
Quae nullum habent fratrem) they should be warily taken heed unto, how they
be translated, because there is not another word to clear them by. Example,
Number. 24. (...) The Masoreth put this mark (...) ubi notant vocem aliquam semel
reperiri, and quae bis occurrunt, they call them (...) that is, gemellj.
3. Hag gebher shethum hagnaijn, Vir apertis oculis. It is not taken in this
sense in all the Scriptures but only here: in other places of the Scripture it
is taken in a contrary signification for Shutting of the eyes.

Another example, Mat. 13. 25. The enemy came and sowed, (...), it should not
be translated Tares or Fitches, but Evil seed, (...) is that which we call
blasted Corn, or the deaf ears, which grow up with the good Corn, and
cannot be discerned from the good Corn until the Harvest; and then it

Tares may be presently discerned, and pulled up; the one signifies the
Hypocrites and the other Heretics. And where it is said, His enemy came and
sowed Tares, The parable must be understood thus, that the enemy corrupted Vide
Suidam in (...) and Sculteri Exercitationes.
that seed which seemed to be good seed: In a parable we must not stretch
every word, but only look to the maine scope; for then we may gather that the
wicked in Hell have tongues now, and the glorified have bodies now in the
Heavens.

A third example. Mark. 14. 3. She brought a box (...) quid.
(...) Of liquid nard, it should be translated Of upright and perfect nard: for
according to the phrase of the Seventy, that is (...) which excels in the
own kind of it, and so they call the Temple of Solomon (...)
(...); An excellent Temple. The Syriack has it Pis from the Greek word (...).

The fourth thing that is to be considered here, are they who translated the
Scriptures. Iunius says that Lib. 1. contro verse. cap. 5. contra Bellar.
there are twelve translations of the Bible into the Greek, the first
translation of the Ptolemies was Lagiana which Ptolemaeus Lagi caused to be
translated. The There were twelve translations of the Bible into Geeeke.
next translation, was the translation of the Seventy, which was translated in
the days of Ptolomeus Philadelpus, the third was Herodiana in the time of
Ptolomie the last, the fourth that of Aquila, the fifth of Symmachus, the sixth
of Theodosion, the seventh Hierichuntina found in Jericho, the eight
Nicapolitana found at Nicapolis, the ninth Origenaria, translated by Origin,
the tenth Luciana translated by the martyr Lucian, the eleventh Hesychiana,
translated by Hesychius, the twelfth Exhieromineana translated out of Ieromes
translation into Greek.

There is such a profunditie in the Scriptures, that it is unpossible for any
Interpreter to sownd the depth of them, but as it fares with the oil of the
widow, 2 King. 4. So long as the children brought vessels, so long there was
oil to fill them: So there is such plenty in the Scriptures, when they have
filled the wits and understanding of the best; yet there is sufficient for
these who go about to translate anew again, to be drawn out of them.

And it is no marvel why they differ so in their translations, for one root
has so many significations The cause of the difference in translations.
sometimes, that all the Translators cannot agree in one. Let us take but this
one example, Job. 4. 18. Pagninus translateth it, In angelis suis ponit lumen.
2. In angelis suis indidit vesaniam, Tigurin. 3. In Angelis suis ponit lucem
exactissimam, vatablus. 4. In angelis suis posuit gloriationem, Regia. 5. In
angelis suis reperit vanitatem, Symmachus. 6. Adversus angelos suos pravum quid
advertit, Septuaginta. (...) laudare. gloriari. fulgere. splendere. insanire,
etc.


The diversity of these translations arises from the word Halal, which
signifies Laudare, gloriari, fulgere splendere, insanire.

The first translation which was in any account was Translations which were in
estimation
that which was in in the days of Ptolomeus Philadelpus.

The second that of Aquila who translated the Old Testament into Greek, an
hundred and twenty years after Christ. The third was that of Symmachus who
lived in the time of the Emperor Severus, fifty and six years after the
translation of Aquila. The fourth translation was that of Theodosion who lived
under the Emperor Commodus (as Symmachus lived under Severus) and he and
Symmachus lived at one time. These four were joined together by Origin, and he
called them Tetrapla. And then he added the Hebrew Text and his How Origin made

translation which was found in Jericho, and at Nicapolis, and then he called

This Edition of Origin was so generally followed afterward, that Augustine
complained that in all the Libraries they could scarcely find one Copy of the
Seventy, wanting these marks of Origin: and The edition of Origin corrected by
Lucian.
when sundry faults, had crept into this his Edition Lucian an Elder at Antioch
and afterward a Martyr, took all these Editions and conferred them together;
and he set out a more axact and correct Edition then Origens was.

Of the Translation of the Seventy.
IT is commonly holden, that Ptolomaeus Philadelpbus Ptolomaeus Philadelphus
procured not this translation, as some hold.
the son of Ptolomeus Lagi, King of Egypt gathered a Library, two hundred
sixty and seven years before the birth of Christ, in the City of Alexandria in
Egypt: and having gathered together diverse Greek writers, he gathered also
Hebrew, Persian, Syriack, and Roman writers, and caused to translate them into
Greek, and put them in his Library: and when he understood of Demetrius
Phalaraus who had the charge of his Library, that there were books in
Jerusalem written by the Prophets amongst the Jews, which entreated of God and
of the creation of the world, and much hid wisdom was contained in them; King
Ptolomie wrote unto Jerusalem, that they might send these books unto him: and
when they had read his Letters, they sent these books written in Golden
letters: which Hebrew books when they were delivered unto the King, he
understood them not: therefore he wrote to Eleazar the Highpriest the second
time, that he would send men unto him, who would translate these Hebrew books
into Greek. And Eleazar sent Seventy two, six out of each Tribe, who were
very skillfull and expert both in the Hebrew and in the Greek. These men
translated the Scripture in the I Will Pharos, being put in several Cells; yet all
of them so agreed, that there was not They were called seventy, propter
Rotundationem numors.
any difference among them, and they were called the Seventy commonly, although
there were seventy and two of them.

Josephus writing against Appion, borrows this history or fable rather out of
Aristoeas, and afterward the Christian writers (in whose time this translation
of the Seventy was in most request) gave ear willingly to this: for they used
most the translation of the Seventy; and they took occasion to spread abroad
any thing, which might serve for their credit. Justin Martyr a famous old
writer, with tooth and nail stands for the authority of this Translation: he
tells how they were put into several Cells, and how they were directed by the
holy Spirit, so that they agreed, not only in the sense; but also in the
words. But yet neither Aristaeas, nor Josephus who borrowed this from him; make
mention of these Cells.

But Scaliger in his animadversions upon Eusebius at the year M. CCXXXIV.
judges that this book of Aristaeas (out of which this narration was borrowed)
^caliger proves by many reasons, that Ptolemeus Philadelphus, did not procure
this translation.
was but fained by some grecizing Jews, that they might conciliat the greater
authority to this their translation which they had procured, and he has sundry
reasons to improve this narration.

The first reason, we know says he out of the history of Hermippus (an ancient
writer of whom Diogenes Laertius Dimetrius phalerius whom Aristaas brings in
as the procurer of this whole business at the hands of Ptolomeus Philadelphus,
was in no favor with him, for Ptolomeus so disliked this Dimetrius altogether,
that in the beginning of his reign he banished him: and through grief he
took himself to live in the Wilderness; and one day being heavy with sleep,
laid himself down upon the ground to sleep, where a Serpent did sting him to
the death. The reason The cause why Dimetrius was hated by Ptolomeus.
wherefore Philadelphus so hated him was this: because when Ptolomeus Lagi his
father had married a second wife called Eurice (as he had Bernice the mother of
Ptolemeus Philadelphus for his first wife) this Dimetrius persuaded Ptolomeus
Lagi to disinherit the son of Bernice, and to give the crown to the son of
the second wife Eurice; which when Ptolomeus Philadelphus understood, after his
fathers death he presently banished him. Now seeing Dimetrius was hated so of
Ptolomeus Philadelphus, and dyed in the beginning of Aristophanes was keeper of
the Library of Ptolomeus.
his reign, is there any probability that he had the charge of this Library?
and Vitruvius says, that Aristophanes that noble Grammarian had the keeping of
this Library; and not Dimetrius Phalerius.

Secondly, Aristaeas and these who follow him say, Egypt to translate the
Bible; but at that time there dwelt no other Jews in Judea, but only of the
Tribe of Judah and Benjamin, although perhaps some of the other Tribes were
scattered amongst them; yet it is certain that these had no place amongst
them, because the most part of them were carried away captive by the Assyrians.
This handful which were yet left in Judea, had no authority amongst them, and
how came it to pass that they sent the whole Synedrion or the great Council
to Egypt? besides, the Synedrion consisted not of the twelve Tribes after the
captivity, but only of the Tribe of Judah; and is it probable that they would
send these Seventy to Egypt? and if it be true which they say of these
several Cells in which they were placed, when they translated the Bible; then
it behooved every one of them, to have such a sufficient measure of knowledge
both in Hebrew and Greek, that they might have finished the whole Work alone;
which no man will believe.

Thirdly, Aristaeas reports that Ptolomeus said, if Deuteronomy. 4. 2. Rev. 22. 18.
This Ptolomeus understood not: and whereas Aristaeas goes about to prove that
these curses were usual amongst the Greeks and Romans; we must understand
that they never used these curses but in extreme necessity; but what necessity
was there here for Ptolomeus to add this curse, who was but desirous that
these books might only be put amongst the rest of the books in the Library?

Fourthly, if Eleazar the Highpriest and the Synedrion Jerusalem had approved
this translation, why would the Jews at Jerusalem have so hated this
translation? For yearly in remembrance of this translation they kept a The
Jews kept a fast for this Translation.
fast the eight day of Tebheth, (which month answers to our December) and
the Jews say, that there was three days darkness when the Law was
translated, these Angaria or fastings which they call Tagnanejoth (...)
were appointed either propter (...) for the great wrath of God which did hang
over them, or for some great plague, or for killing some just man, so the Jews
observed these Angaria in remembrance of this translation, as a day of great
heaviness and not as a day of great joy; and they applied that place of
Solomon, Eccles. 3. 1. There is a time to rent, and a time to sow, they who
made this schism, say they, rent the Law, when they translated it.

Fifthly, If we shall mark what manner of man this Ptolomeus Egypt was, we
shall hardly be induced Ptolomeus Philadelphus a vicious man.
to think that he had such a care in translating of the Bible: or that he
would be at such charges to send for such a number of learned men to translate
it: for he was a most vile and wicked man, and he was called Philadelphus as
the Parcae* or weerdsisters are called Eumenides, for he killed his two
brethren borne of Eurices and committed incest with his own sister Arcinoe.

Sixthly, Josephus writes that the Law was sent by Eleazer the hie Priest to
Egypt, written in Golden Letters; Iosep. lib. 11. 2.
but this is improbable: for the Hebrew Doctors write, that it was not lawful
for any, no not for the King to write the Law, but only with Ink; and when
they saw the copy that was presented to Alexander the great, having the name
Iehova still written in Golden Letters, the wise men amongst the Guliel.
Shickardus lib. 2. de iure reg. Hebrae.
Jews would have them rased out, and to be written with Ink.

See how the grecizing Jews made up this fable of the agreement and consent of
the Seventy translating the Bible, this fable arose (as Scaliger observeh well)
The fable of the grecizing Jews concerning the Translation of the Seventie.
out of the misapplying of that place, Exodus 24. 9. And Moses ascended and
Aaron, verse. 11. And Seventie of the Elders of Israel. And there the
Septuagints add (which is not in the original) (...), that is, Of the chosen
men of Israel none of them did disagree, and hence afterward was this
uniformity made up of the Seventy translating the Law in Egypt, whereas there
is no such thing in the original text; but only this ways it stands in the
Text. They saw the Lord, and upon the Nobles of Israel, he laid not his hand,
that is, although they saw the Lord yet they dyed not; that which was spoken of
the Seventy in Moses time, they applied it to these Seventy who were sent to
Egypt in the days of Ptolemeus: and again, they misinterpret the word (...)
thus, The chosen of Israel none of them did disagree, but in the original it
is, None of them did die. Wherefore Scaliger judges (and not without cause)
that this Translation of the Seventy was not procured thus, and the grecizing
The cause that moved the Jews to procure this Translation of the Seventie.
Jews do fable; but he says, the matter fell out after this manner. When the
Scattered Jews lived under Ptolemeus King of Egypt, then they were enforced
to write their contracts in Greek, and to reckon their times by the reign of
the Kings of Egypt; who redacted them to this necessity, to speak the Greek
tongue: and these Jews who lived in Alexandria and through out Egypt,
procured this Translation, and that it might be read, not only in Egypt
amongst the grecizing Jews there; but also amongst all the grecizing Jews
abroad: but the Jews who keep the original text were very loath to admit the
Translation of the Seventie to be read in their Synagogues; and it was for this
Translation (as Scaliger holds) The cause of the hatred betwixt the Hebrews
and Grecizing Jews.
that there was such hatred between the Hebrews and the Greeks, Act. 6. 7.
The other Jews who lived still in Judea hated these grecizing Jews who
followed the Translation of the Seventy, they called them hakkore giphthith,
reading after the manner of the Egyptians, and Lemiphrang, that is, the wrong
reading: (...) Legen^es Egyptia^e. (...) Retrorsum.
because they read from the left hand to the right, and not from the right hand
to the left, as the Hebrews do.

By this which has been said, we may perceive that this Translation of the
Seventy was not procured by Ptolomeus Philadelphus. This much only we must
grant, first, that this Translation was translated in the This Translation was
procured under Ptolomeus, but not by him.
days of Ptolomeus Philadelpus. Secondly, that it was translated by seventy
Jews; but that Ptolomeus was the cause why it was translated, or that the
Seventy were put in several Cells when they translated it, or were divinely
inspired as the Prophets of God were The Seventy were not inspired as Prophets,
when they translated the Bible.
when they translated it; all these are too be denied.

This Translation of the Seventy which we have now, is not that which the
Seventy wrote, Origin never saw it, as may appear by his Hexapla, for it was
burnt by Dioclesian (as some hold) in the Library of Alexandria, or (as others
hold) by Julius Caesar when he burnt Serapion. Barouius. Tom. 2.


The Seventy were not (...), inspired by the holy Vido Lipsium de Bibliotheca.
Spirit, and therefore we are not to parallel the Hebrew Text and the
translation of the Seventy, but where the holy Ghost has paralelled them.

There were other Translations of the Old Testament. First, the Arabicke
translation of the Testament. Secondly, Diverse translation of the old
Testament.
the Persicke translation upon the five books of Moses which was translated
by Iacobus Tavasus. And thirdly, the Ethiopian translation, translated by
Damianus Agoeis. And lastly, the Armenian translation. Guido fabratius sent to
the King of France the Arabicke, Ethiopian, Persian, and Armenian translations,
and all in their own Characters; which if the King had caused print in their
own Characters, and digested them in Columns, as Origin did his Octupla; it
had been regium opus, a princely work.

The first Latin translation out of the Hebrew was The first Translation out
of the Hebrew into Latin, was that of Hiero.
Hieroms translation, four hundred years after Christ in the days of Pope
Damasus, there were other translations in Latin, of which Augustine makes
mention, but they were translated out of the Greek.

The first translation of the New Testament was into the Syriacke tongue.

Marcke is holden to be the Author of this translation, The first translation
of the new Testament, was the Syriack.
hut he was martyred in the eight year of Nero, and the Fathers who lived in
Egypt, and Palestina make no mention of this Syriack translation, as Origin,
Clemens Alexandrinus, and Athanasius: and therefore it seems to be latter,
and not so soon after the Apostles.

The Syriack translation which was heretofore in our The Syriack translation
which was here to fore wanted many things.
Churches was defective, and wanted many things which were in the original; as
it wanted the last verse of the seventh Chapter of John, and the history of the
adulterous woman, Ioh. 8. So the second Epistle of Peter, the second and third
Epistle of John, the Epistle of Jude, and the book of the Revelation; all
these were wanting in it. But that Copy which is brought lately from Syria
wants none of these, as Ludovicus de Deiu* testifies in his Syriack
translation which he has now published, and the Arabicke translation which
Erpeneus had by him, has all these places which the former translation wanted.

We will subjoyne here the postscripts which are found in the Syriack and
Arabic translations, after the Evangelists.

The postscript of the Evangelist St. Matthew in the The Postscript of Matthew
in the Syriack and Arabic translations.
Syriack is this, Scriptum est in terra palestinae Hebraice, this Gospel was
written in the Hebrew tongue, in Palestina. The Postscript in the Arabic is
this. Absolutum est Evangelium Matthaei Apostoli, quod scripsit in terra
Palestinae Hebraice, auxilio spiritus sancti, octo annis postquam dominus
noster Jesus Christus carne in caelos ascendit, primo anno regni Claudij
Caesaris Regis Romani. That is, the Gospel of the Apostle Matthew, which he
wrote in Hebrew by the assistance of the holy Spirit, in the land of Palestina,
was perfected eight years after Jesus Christ ascended to the Heavens, in the
first year of the reign of Claudius Caesar, the King of the Romans.

Here observe two things, first, that the Syriack and The error of this Syrack
and Arabiack postscript.
Arabic say that this Gospel was written in Hebrew first, whereas it was
written originally in Greek. Secondly, that the Arabic calls Matthew an
Apostle, whereas he was an Evangelist.

The Postscript of the Evangelist Mark, in the Syriack The postscript of Mark
in the Syriack and Arabiack Translationes.
is this, Absolutum est Evangelium Sancti Marci qui loquutus est and
Evangelizavit Romae, That is, here ends the Gospel of S. Mark which he spoke
and preached at Rome. The Arabic has it thus, Finitum est exemplar Marci,
quod scripsit in ditione romana occidentali, in vrbe Romana, anno duodecimo
postqua^ dominus noster Jesus Christus carne in Caelos ascendit quarto anno
Claudij Caesaris, That is, here ends the exemplar of Mark which he wrote in
the province of western Rome in the City of Rome it self, twelve years after
our Lord Jesus Christ ascended into heaven in the flesh, in the fourth year of
Claudius Caesar.

But this Postscript is not probable, for Mark lived The error of these two
postscripts.
in the Church of Alexandria in Egypt, therefore it is more probable that he
wrote his Gospel there, than at Rome.

The Postscript of Luke in the Syriack is this, Scriptum The postscript of Luke
In the Arabiack and Syriack Translation.
est Alexandriae magnae quindecem annis a Christi ascensione. It was written in
the great City of Alexandria fifty years after Christ's ascension. The Arabic
is, Scriptum est graece in civitate Macedonia vigesimo secundo anno post
ascensionem Domini in caelum, vigesimo quarto anno Claudij Caesaris. This
Gospel was written in Greek in the City of Macedonia twenty two years after
the Lords ascension into the heavens, the twenty fourth year of Claudius
Caesar.

Here we may see the difference betwixt these two The error of these two
postscripts.
Postscripts, the Syriack says, it was written in Alexandria in Egypt, and the
Arabic says, it was written in Macedonia in Greece, what credit then should
we give to these Postscripts?

The Postscript of John; the Syriack is, Johannes Evangelista hoc Evangelium
edidit Graece Ephesi. That is, the The postscript of John in the Arabiack and
Syriak Translation.
Evangelist set forth this Gospel in Greek at Ephesus, the Arabic is,
Johannes filius Zebedaei vnus ex duodecem Apostolis, scripsit idgraece Incolis
Ephesi, anno post ascensionem domini in Caelos tricesimo, imperante Nero. John
the son of Zebedaeus one of the twelve Apostles wrote this in Greek to the
inhabitants of Ephesus, thirty years after Christ's ascension, in the reign of
Nero.

The Syriack translation is read in Syria, Mesopotamea, Chaldea, and Egypt; and
it was sent first in to Europe by Ignatius Patriarch of Antioche.

These who translated the Bible in latter times, were The latter Translaters of
the Bible Popish or Orthodoxe.
either Popish, or Orthodoxe.

Popish, the Latin translation established by the council of Trent, Vatablus,
Arias Montanus, Pagninus, and Isiodorus Clarius.

By the reformed, as by Munster, Ecolampadius by Leo Judah who dying before the
work was finished, Bibliander, and Conradus Pellicanus finished it, and then
they are called Biblia Tigurina. And lastly, by Iunius and Tremellius.

Of the Vulgar Latin translation.
When light arose to them who sat in darkness and in the shadow of death,
to the Protestants who lived before in Popery, they began to search the
original Text and to look into the fountains, the Hebrew and Greek, and
they charged the adversaries to bring their proofs out of the original Text
in their disputations with them.

The Church of Rome to obviat this, made a decree The Church of Rome decreed
that the Vulgar Latin translation should be the original.
in the Council of Trent, Anno. 1546. that the Vulgar Latin should be holden
for the original; which was as base a change, as when Rehoboam changed the
golden Sheilds in the Temple, into Sheilds of brass, 1 King. 14. 27. So have
they changed the original into the Vulgar Latin translation, and made it
authenticke; which in many places is corrupted.

After that they had inacted, that the Vulgar Latin should be only the
touchstone, to try all controversies and that they should use it in their
readings and disputations, then Sixtus Quintus the Pope took great pains
about the correcting of this Vulgar Latin. Pius the fourth and Pius Quintus
had done something before in the correcting of this Vulgar translation; but it
was Sixtus Quintus that finished it, Anno 1590. So Forty four years betwixt
the act of the Council, and the finishing of the Latin translation.
that there were forty four years betwixt the Act made in the Council, and
the finishing of the translation. Bishop Morton says, that the Canon Law
forbids, that a child shall be baptized before it be borne; yet they will
make this Vulgar translation to be original and authenticke before it be
finished and perfected by the Popes. And what will they say here? wanted the
Church an authenticke translation all this while until it was concluded in the
Council of Trent.

When Sixtus Quintus had taken all this pains in correcting the vulgar Latin,
and had proclaimed it as authenticke by his Bull, and cursed them who held
otherwise: yet Clemens the eight came afterward, and Clemens the eight
corrected the vulgar translation.
corrected many things which were left uncorrected by Sixtus Quintus, and he
set out a more perfect Edition than that of Sixtus Quintus: and there was great
difference betwixt these two Editions, as Docter James the Overseer of the
Library of Oxford has marked, in his book which is entitled, De B^llo
antipapali. These were not errors in the Print (as some would salve up the
matter) but they are material differences, as may be seen in that book by
conferring their translations.

We may demand of the Catholics, whether did the Council make this
translation Authenticke which was not Authenticke before, or did they only
declare it to be Authenticke? Some of them say, that the Council Diverse
^udgements of the Catholics concerning the vulgar Latin translation.
promulgated it to be Authenticke, and that the Lord so directed the hand of
the first Translator, that he erred not in these things that the Council was
to approve afterward. But Bannes the Jesuit says, that it is of Page 537.
greater authority that is approved by the Church, than that which was
immediately written by these, who were infallibly directed by the Spirit; but
can there be any greater authority than to be infallibly directed by the In
^o^is theologicis lib. 2. cap. 14.
Spirit? Canus holds that they were immediately and infallibly directed by the
Spirit, who translated the Scripture first into the vulgar Latin. And
Gretserus goes further, and sticks not to say, that Theodosion who
translated the Bible into Greek, erred not in his Defension^ Bellarm. contra.
Whittakerum. lib. 1. cap. 2. page ^37.
translation, but was assisted by the holy Spirit that he could not err; yet
he was a Jew and an enemy to Christ. Serrarius says, he who translated the
Vulgar Latin had but the general concurse of the Spirit of Serrarius in
Prolegom. bibliac. Page 110.
God, as the rest of the servants of God had; but was not infallibly directed
by the Spirit in his translation. And Johannes Dreido proposit. 3. 4. and
Andradius fol. 255. and Bellarmin, Lib. 2. 11. admittimus eum interpretem
fuisse, sed non vatem, and yet some of them hold that he erred not in the
versions which the Church approved afterward.

Again we may demand of them, whether will they prefer the Vulgar
translation to the Hebrew and Greek? The grosser of the Papists are not
ashamed, to prefer it to them both, and they say, we have no need to have
recourse to the original, to try whether it be Authenticke or not, the Vulgar
Latin being now established by the Council. And Ludovicus a Tena says,
although the books in the original both Hebrew and In Isagoge ad Scripturam
lib. 1. diff. 6* sect. 1.
Greek were not corrupted, yet seeing they have words of diverse
significations, which the Church has not approved or rejected: therefore we
are to hold that the Vulgar Latin is Authenticke only; because the Church
has concluded it to be so. And Osorius says, if we should grant that the
Interpreter Osorius Instit. Moral. Lib. 8. Cap. 3.
might have erred in his versions, yet the Church cannot err in approving his
Version.

The Modern Papists prefer it not simply to the Hebrew and Greek, as
Gretserus says, Sufficit aequatio, non praelatio: But they say, that they will
not have their translation examined and tried by the Hebrew and Greek; for how
know we (say they) that these Copies which we have now, agree with the first
original Copy? we have the judgment of the Church concerning this
translation, but not concerning the Hebrew and Greek. But if it be in the
Churches power to make a translation or to authorize it, why will they not
authorize the Hebrew and Greek rather than the Vulgar Latin translation?

And if they inact the Vulgar Latin to be Authenticke and the only rule to
decide controversies, what shall become of all the Churches in the East that
understand not the Latin; shall they under the pain of a curse receive this
translation?

When the Vulgar translation was concluded in the Council of Trent, only to
be the Authenticke translation in their Disputations, Sermons, and Conferences;
Some opposed against this, and said, that it was a hard thing for the Church,
to judge that only to be Authenticke, which one man had done. And Aloysius
Catenaas said, that no man could know what a Version meant, but by the
Original; and he alleged for himself Cajetans authority in the Council, who
being Legate for the Pope in Germany, Anno 1523. was wont to say, that the
only remedy to refell Heretics, was to understand the literal sense out of
the original tongues, and he said now, that the Cardinal would spend the rest
of his days in studying of the tongues, that he might be the more fit to
convince the Heretics; which he did, and he gave himself to this study
eleven years before he dyed.

Again there was much contention among them concerning the meaning of this
Canon made in the Council of Trent, whether this translation was the judge in
matters of faith or manners only? or was it so strictly to be taken that it
failed not one jote, and that Mathematice it was so perfect and not Moraliter
only? Andreas vega who was present at the Council of Trent holden under Pope
Paul the third, says; when the Tridentine Fathers call the vulgar Latin
translation, the Authenticke translation, they mean no other thing but this,
that it was not corrupted with errors, and that it might be safely read and
used to a man's salvation; and he concludes, that the authority which the
Council gave to this translation, is not to be taken infinitive, but
definitive with certain limitations. But if this was the meaning of the
Council, that the faithful might safely read it, because there was no danger
of error; then what authority or prerogative had this version by the Council,
above that translation of Pagnine for the Doctors of Lovan by the approbation
of the Pope, put the translation of Pagnine with the Hebrew Text. But the
former Catholics say, that he who translated the Hebrew into the Vulgar
Latin, was not an Interpreter, but a Prophet: but how comes it that others
say now, that this Interpreter might err, although not grossly? that he might
err, not in fide and moralibus, but in lesser matters? and so they will have
the Council to be understood; but they of old said plainly, that in every
thing this translation was Authenticke.

Lastly, when we demand of them whether the Church may make a new Version yet
or not? or mend that which is already done? Gretserus who takes the defense
of Bellarmine, against Whittaker, denies that Lib. 2. cap. 10. page 540.
there can be any thing added to this translation, or be In Prolegom. bibli.
made more perfect. But Serrarius holds, that this Version may be yet helped,
and that it is not come yet to such a perfection, but that it may grow to a
greater; if the Church would condescend.

The translation of the Seventy although the Apostles themselves followed it in
many things, yet it was never holden to be Original and Divine, by the Church,
neither were the Churches commanded to receive it under the pain of a curse.
Hierome marketh in his Preface upon the first of the Chronicles, that the
Churches of Alexandria in Egypt, followed the Translation of Hesychius (which
was a translation set forth after the Seventies translation) rather then the
translation of the Seventy: but from Constantinople to Antioche, they followed
the translation of Lucian the Martyr, but the Churches of Palestina (which lay
betwixt these two) followed Origens Hexapla: And so he says, the whole world
was divided into these three; then what great presumption is it in the Church
of Rome, to make the Vulgar Latin Authenticke and Original, and to injoyne it
to be read in all the Churches? Franciscus Ximenius Cardinal of Toledo, in his
Preface before the Bible set out at Complutum in Spain says, that he set the
Vulgar Latin betwixt the Hebrew and the Greek, as Christ was set betwixt two
Thieves, is not this a fine comparison to prefer the Vulgar Latin to the
Hebrew and Greek?

The Syriack translation was first translated into Latin by Guido Fabricius,
and afterward by Tremellius. Genebrard and Serarius taking occasion upon this
translation, charged Tremellius with great forgerie. First, that he took away
all the Titles from the Epistles; but this was no forgerie: for neither the
Superscriptions nor the Subscriptions are any part of the Canonical Scripture,
as may be seen before in the postscripts added to the Syriacke translation.
Secondly, they charge him, that he took away the Calender, for the reading of
the Gospel upon holy days: but neither the Hebrew Calender, nor the Syriacke
Calender, are Divine Scripture; and that use, for which they say this Calender
served, for reading of the Gospel upon holy days; was only used in the
western Romish Churches, but not in the Eastern Churches. Thirdly, they say
that he committed Plagium in stealing his translation from Guido Fabricius, and
setting it out under his own name: but what diligence he used in translation
of the Syriack, he who wrote his life testifies. And will any man think that
he who was a native Jew, borne and trained up in these tongues, was so
ignorant, that he had no skill, but that which he did steall from another? and
Gretserus adds, that first he was a Jew, and then he became a Monk, thirdly,
a Calvanist or Hugonite, and lastly, that he returned to his vomit again,
and dyed a Jew. But that ye may perceive what a Railer this was, who spared
neither the living nor the dead, I will set down a memorable proof of his
death; he who wrote Apophthegmata morientium, (the notable sayings which sundry
uttered at the last hour of their death,) relates this of him. When they
demanded of him what confession he would make of his faith? he said, Vivat
Christus and pereat Barabbas. Whereas the rest of the Jews cried, Vivat
Barabbas, and pereat Christus, this he said to signify that he renounced
Iudaisme, and took him only to the merits of Christ. Was this to dye like a
Jew? the Name of this worthy man should smell to us as the Wine of Lebanon.
Hos. 14. 7.

Of a Paraphrase.
THe second way how God makes the Scripture plain unto us, is by paraphrasing
it, which goes in a larger circuit of words than a translation does; and this
is called tirgam a Paraphrase. An Ecphrasis is (...)
an exposition of this Paraphrase.

The first Paraphrase, was the Paraphrase of Jonathan the son of Vzziel, who
paraphrased the great Prophets thirty years before Christ, both plainly and
without Allegories: but upon the small Prophets he runs out more upon
Allegories.

The seeond Paraphrase, was the Paraphrase of Onkelos otherwise called Rabbi
Aquila, adding Nun and changing a into o, as Aquila Onkelos, as Bonarges
Bannarges. It was he who translated the Old Testament into Greek also, he
paraphrased the five books of Moses ninety years after Christ; not long
after the destruction of the Temple.

The third Paraphrase, was Targum Hierosolymitanum upon the five books of
Moses, most fabulous and most impure; but because Targum Jonathan was in great
request among the Jews, and not so fabulous as this Targum; the Printers
amongst the Jews put these two letters Tau Iod before that Paraphrase, to make
the Reader believe, that it was Targum Jonathan, Ionathans (...)
Paraphase: for these two letters stand both for Targum Jonathan, and for
Targum Hierosolymitanum.

Lastly, Rabbi Joseph Caecus paraphrased Cetubhim, or the written books.

All these Paraphrases if ye will respect the language, were either in the
Babylonian or Hierosolymitan tongue; three in the Babylonian, and Turgum
Hierosolymitanum in the Hierosolymitan tongue.

These Paraphrases, where they paraphrase against Paraphrases when they are
blasphemous are to rejected.
Christ are to be detested. Exam. 1. Genesis 4. Incaeptum est nomen domini
profanari, but Targum Hierosolymitanum paraphraseth it blaspemously, In diebus
illis coeperunt Idola colere, and fecerunt sibi Deos erroneos, quos
cognominabant de nomine Sermonis domini. And here he implies Christ who is
called (...), sermo dei. This paraphrase is blasphemous against the Son of
God, and therefore to be detested.

Example, 2 Can. 4. 5. Thy two breasts are like two young Roes. Targum
paraphraseth these two Roes to be two Messiases, the one the son of Joseph,
the other the son of David, the one Poor and the other mighty, that is a
blasphemous Paraphrase, and therefore to be detested.

Example 2. Job. 23. 9. He paraphraseth it this ways, Michael is upon his
right hand, and Gabriel upon his left hand, Michael is upon his right hand, and
he is fire; and Gabriel is upon his left hand, and he is water; and the holy
creatures are partly fire and partly water. This Paraphrase is blasphemous;
because it makes the Son of God but a Creature, and matcheth Gabriel with
Michael.

Secondly, where these Paraphrases are fabulous, they Paraphrases when they are
ridiculous are to be rejected.
are to be rejected. Example 1, Genesis 3. 21. The Lord made coats of skin for
Adam and Eve. Targum Hierosolymitanum paraphraseth it this ways. The Lord made
glorious clothes which he put upon the skin of their flesh, that they might
cover themselves.

Example 2. Genesis 32. 26. Dimitte me quia ascendit aurora. The Paraphrast makes
this to be one of the seven Angels who stand before the Lord, singing
continually, holy holy Lord of Hoasts, and he makes this Angel to be chief
of the Quire.

Example 3. Exodus 13. 19. And Moses took the bones of Joseph with him. Targum
Hierosolymitanum paraphraseth it thus, Ascendere fecit Moses vrnam ossium
Iosephi, ex intimo Nili; and abauxit secum. Hence the Talmudists make a great
question how they could find this Chest of Joseph, being sunk so deep in the
flood Nilus, and they fly to their shift of Shem hamphorash; and R, Bechai
upon this, says, that Moses took a plate and wrote (...)
upon it, and said, ascend Be^. (meaning Joseph who was called Bos Dei, Deuteronomy.
33. 17.) and did cast this plate into Nilus saying, O Joseph, thy brethren
which are redeemed are waiting for thee, and the cloud of glory is waiting for
thee: if thou will not go up with us now, we are free of our oath.

Example 4. Deuteronomy. 28. 18. Decaudicabat debiles, He cut off the tail or the
weak of the host, but Targum Hierosolymitanum paraphraseth it this ways, sed
accepit eos Amalek, and amputavit loca virilitatis little, projecitque sursum
versus coelum, dicens, toll quod elegisti, meaning that part which was
commanded by the Lord to be circumcised, they threw it up into the heavens, in
contempt and spite against the Lord.

Example 5. 1 Samuel 15. And he numbered them Battelahim, but Targum paraphraseth
it thus, He numbered them by the lambs. For Telahim is called lambs also, and
(...)
they say that Saul would not number the people for fear of a plague upon him
and his people; as it fell out afterward upon David and his people: therefore
he caused every one of them to bring a lamb, and he numbered all the lambs,
and so he knew the number of the people; such Jewish fables as these the
Apostle wills us to take heed of, Tit. 1. 14.

But where these Paraphrases clear the Text, then Paraphrases where they
clear the Text are to be used.
we are to make use of them. Example, Genesis 2. 24. He shall leave father and
mother, and cleave unto his wife. Onkelos paraphraseth it thus, he shall leave
Domum cubilis, where the Paraphrast alludeth to the ancient custom of the
Jews, for the children lay in their fathers chamber before they were married,
Luke 11. 7. My children are with me in bed.

Example 2. Genesis 12. 5. And Abraham took all the souls which he had got in
Charan, Onkelos paraphraseth it thus, Omnes animas quas subjecerat legi.

Example 3. Gen 49. Ruben excellens munere and dignitate, Onkelos paraphraseth
it thus, Excellens principatu and Sacerdotio; for he that was the first borne,
at the first, was both the Prince and the Priest in the Family.

Example 4. Genesis 49, 27. Benjamin a ravening woolfe, he shall eat the prey in
the morning, and shall divide the spoil at night. The Paraphrast paraphraseth
it thus, In his possession shall the Sanctuary be built, morning and evening
shall the Priests offer their offerings; and in the evening shall they divide
the rest of the portion which is left of the sanctified things.

Of interpretation of Scripture.
THe third outward mean whereby the Lord makes the Scripture clear to his
Church, is Interpretation, and this is called (...).

This Interpretation of the Scriptures makes the (...).
people to understand them, for when the Scriptures are not interpreted, they
are like a Nut not broken. The Scriptures not being interpreted to the people,
are like a Nut not broken.
When Gideon heard the dream and the interpretation of of it, Iud. 7. 15. In
the Hebrew it is Veshibhro, the breaking of it: a speech borrowed from the
breaking of a Nut; for as we break the shell that we may get the (...)
Kernel: So the Scriptures must be broken for the people, and cut up for
their understanding.

It was the manner of the Jews in their Synagogues, after that the Law and the
Prophets were read, to Interpret the scriptures, Act. 13. 15. And after the
reading of the Law and Prophets, the rulers of the Synagogue sent unto them
saying, ye men and brethren, if ye have any word of exhortation for the people;
say on. And therefore the Synagogue was called Beth midresh* Domus
expositionis, and we see the practice of this, Nehem. 8. 8. Legerunt cum (...)
appositione intellectus: They read the Law clearly to the people, and caused
them to understand those things which were read; this was the fruit of their
interpretation. So they did (...) Act. 16. 10. Confer places with places. The
giving of the sense here, is more than to give the grammatical interpretation
of the words: they gave the sense and the spiritual meaning of them when they
preached, Noah was a Preacher of righteousness, 2 Pet. 2. 5. The Church is not
only the keeper of the Scriptures, but also an Interpreter of them. This word
Kara signifies both to Read and to Promulgate, Esaias. 29. 12. and 61. 12.
Zach. 7, 7. Act. 10. 20. So (...) Legit Proclamavit


Mikra which signifies Reading, signifies also an Assembly or Convocation, to
teach us that the holy Scriptures (...) Convocatio Scripturo sacra.


ought to be read in the congregation, and holy assemblies, and ought likewise
to be expounded.

The conclusion of this is; The Lord uses so many means to make the Scripture
clear to the people, and yet the Church of Rome goes about to stop these
Fountains of living waters, that the people may not drink of them. As the
Spies raised a slander upon the Land of Canaan, saying that it was unpossible
to be won: so do they slander the Scriptures of God with obscurities, and say,
that it is impossible for the people to understand them.

EXERCITAT. XVI.
Of the division of the Scriptures.

They have Moses and the Prophets. Luc. 16. 29.
THe scriptures are divided into the old and New Testament.

The old Testament again is divided into Moses and the Prophets, and sometimes
the Law is put for the whole old Testament, Romans 3. So Ioh. 7. 49. Esaias. 2. 3.
And sometimes the Psalms are called the Law. Ioh. 15. 25. That the word might
be fulfilled which is written in their Law, they hated me without a cause. So
the Prophets are called the Law. 1 Cor. 14. 21 In the Law it is written.

Moses is divided into Hammitzua, Commandments, Chukkim, statutes, and
Mishpatim, judgments; that (...) pentateuchus in
(...) (...)

is, in Moral Precepts, Ceremonial, and Judicial.

The Jews again divide the old Testament into the Law, the Prophets and
Cetubhim, which the Greeks call (...), holy writings, all the Scriptures are
holy (...) (...) propheta.
priores, (...) posteriores.

writings; but usually these that were not confirmed by Vrim and Thummim are
called (...).

The Prophets are divided in Rishonim and Acharonim, the former and the Latter:
the former Prophets are Joshua, Judges, 1 Samuel, 2 Samuel. 1 Kings and 2
Kings, They are called the former Prophets because they entreat of the history
past, and present. Act. 3. 24. Yea and all the Prophets from Samuel and those
that follow after. Samuel is said to be the first of the Prophets; therefore,
Iere. 15. 1. Though Moses and Samuel stood before me, Samuel is the first of
the Prophets; then it is most probable that he wrote the books of Joshua and
Judges. Joshua is the first in order of the Prophets, therefore the Haptorath
which is set upon it, is called Haphtorah laetitiae legis, They were glad when
they ended the Law, and began the Prophets. But Samuel seems to be the
writer of this book.

Others call them the first Prophets, because they saw the first Temple; and
they call them the latter Prophets, because they prophesied in the time of the
second Temple, as Haggai, Malachi, Zachary. But they are all rather to be
called Acharonim latter Prophets, because they foretell things to come: and
they are divided into the great Prophets and into the small.

The great Prophets are Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and Daniel.

The latter Prophets are called Teresar pro Tere gnasar (...) pro, (...)
duodecem.
that is, two and ten, and the Greeks called them (...). There is a Testimony
cited by Matthew, cap. 2. 23. That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by
the Prophets. This Testimony is found but in one of the Small prophets: yet it
is said to be spoken by the Prophets; and they gave this to be the reason,
(...).
because all these Twelve small Prophets were joined in one book.

The Conclusion of this is. First the Lord has summed Romans 13, 10. Love is the
fulfilling of the Law. Then he has enlarged this word in two Mat. 22. 37.
Thou shall love the Lord thy God with all thine heart: and thou shall love thy
Neighbor as thy self. Thirdly he has enlarged these two into ten words
Deuteronomy. 10. 4. And he wrote on the Tables the ten words. Fourthly he has
enlarged them into Moses and the Prophets. Mat. 22. 40. On these two
Commandments hang all the Law and the Prophets, (...) pendent, even as we
hang a thing upon a Nail, Esaias 22. 23. So the Law and the Prophets hang upon
these two.

EXERCITAT. XVII
Of the Division of the Psalms.

Act. 13. 33. As it is also written in the second Psalm. Thou art my Son
this day have I begotten thee.
THe Psalms are divided in five books, as the five Books of Moses; and the
five Books joined together called Quinque volumina, as Canticles. Ruth.
Lamentations. Ecclesiastes and Esther.

The first book of the Psalms ends with the, 41. Psalm. The second ends
with the 72 Psalm. The third with the 89. The fourth with the 106. The fifth
with the 150. Psalm, and these books end with the same words, Baruch Iehova
Elohe Iisrael mehagnolam (...)
vegnad hagnolam, Amen veamen. Blessed be the Lord God of Israel from
Everlasting to Everlasting, Amen, Amen. Psalm. 41. 13. so the rest of the
books, for the most part end thus. And hence we may gather, that this verse
was added by him who set the Psalms in order, and not by those who wrote the
rest of the Psalms. This may appear by the conclusion of David's Psalm of
thankesgiving 1 Chro. 16. 36. That they have borrowed their conclusion at the
end of every book from the conclusion of this Psalm.

The first two books were written by David, and they David wrote the first two
books of the Psalms and set them in order.
end thus, So end the Prayers of David the Son of less, Psalm. 27. 30. That
is, here end the Psalms which were both written and set in order by David.

The other three books were written by diverse Authors as by David, Asaph, the
sons of Korah, Ieduthun, Moses, Heman the Ezrite, and when the writer of the
Psalm is not set down, the Jews hold, that he who wrote the former, wrote
that Psalm also.

Asaph wrote thirteen Psalms, Leasaph, Lamed is (...)
sometimes a note of the genitive case, and sometimes of the Dative case, and
therefore some have interpreted (...) Aliquando est nota Gen^t^v^ aliquando

the word Mizmor leasaph, a Psalm dedicat to Asaph to be sung be him; but it
should be Translated a Psalm of Asaph: for Asaph was a Prophet, 2 Chronicles. 29.
30. Moreover Hezekiah and the Princes commanded the Levites to sing praises
unto the Lord, with the words of David and Asaph the Seer. And the style of
Asaph is harder then the Style of David.

The second who wrote these Psalms were the Sons of Korah, and they wrote
ten in number; the The son of Korah wrote some of the Psalms.
posterity of Korah died not in the rebellion with their Father, Number. 26. 11.
Some of his posterity wrote before the captivity, and foretold of the
captivity, as the Psalm. 73. 74. And some of them when they were in the
captivity.

So some when they were returning from the captivity, as 66. Some after they
were returned, as 85. and 147.

So Moses wrote a Psalm of the shortness of the life of man, this Psalm was
written when they were Moses wrote a Psalm.
in the Wilderness, and yet it was not registered in the Canon till after the
captivity. Thus we see the watchful eye of God, that had a care to preserve
these books which were to be insert in the Canon, that none of them should
perish.

So these Psalms which were written by Ieduthun Ieduthun and Ethan wrote some
of the Psalms.
and by Ethan the Ezrite who were of the posterity of the Levites. The Levites
duty was to teach the People, and so the Lord made those Levites teachers of
the people by their songs.

Of the inscriptions of the Psalms.
THe Psalms generally are entitled Tebilim, praises, because the most of them
are songs of praise; therefore the whole are so called. The general
inscription of the Psalms is Tehilim


The particular Inscriptions of them are either easily understood, or hardly to
be understood at all.

The inscriptions easy to be understood are these. First, Lamnatzeahh, (...)
to the chief Musician. The singers were divided into so many orders, and (...)
every one sang according to their courses, and when it befell the chief
Musician to sing, then he caused to sing this Psalm committed to him.

The next title is Maschil a Psalm for instruction. These were Psalms which
David made out of his own experience. Peter, when thou art converted

Fourthly, some are called Psalms of degrees. (...)

carried the Arc out of the house of David to the Temple.
into the Temple, they sang, Psalm. 119. by the way, it begins with these
words, Bea^i immaculati in via, and entreats especially of the Law of the
Lord, and there is not a verse in it, except only the 122. verse, In omnibus
versibus Psalmi 119. dempto vers^^ 122. vna harum vndecem vocum invenitur. (...)
which has not some epithet of the Law of God in it, as his Judgments, his
Word, his Statutes, his Laws, his Testimonies, his Commandments, his
Precepts, his Covenant, etc, And when they entered into the Court of the
Gentiles with the Arc, they sang the last part of this, Psalm. 119.

When they went further to the Court of the people, When a (...) where they
sung the Psalms of degrees.
when they stood upon the first degree, they sung Psalm. 120. which contains
the history of the deliverance of the people out of Egypt. And when they stood
upon the second degree, they sung Psalm. 121. My help comes from the Lord.
When they were upon the third step they sung Psalm. 122. I was glad when they
said unto me, let us go into the house of the Lord. So they sung a Psalm
upon every step as they ascended, and upon the eight step when they beheld the
excellent buildings of the Courts of the Levites, they sung Psalm. 127. Except
the Lord build the house, they labor in vain that build it. When they entered
into the Court of the Priests, they sung Psalm. 128. And upon the last step they
sung Psalm. Vide Villalpand in Ezekiel. 40. 28.
134. Bless ye the Lord all his servants which watch by night in the house of
the Lord. The people might go no further; then the Priests went forward with
the Arc into the Temple, and when they entered into the porch of the Temple,
they sung Psalm. 118. verse. 19. Open to me the gates of righteousness. When
they were standing in the porch they sung these verses following, This The
Psalms which the Priests sung when the Arc entered into the Temple* and into
the holiest of all.
is the gate of the Lord into which the righteous shall enter. When they were
in the midst of the Temple they sung the 22. verse, I will praise thee, for
thou have heard me and art become my salvation, and when the Arc entered into
the holiest of all, they sung Psalm. 24.

The Psalms again were divided according to the Psalms are divided according

morning sacrifice. So Psalm. 92. was sung upon the Sabbath: So at the passover

they had sung an Hymn; they went out into the mount of Olives.

to him in the highest heavens, Luke 19. 28.

There are some Psalms which concerned David's particular estate, in his
persecution by Saul, by Absolon; etc. In his sickness, in his adversity. In
his prosperity Psalms which concerned David.
how he fell in adultery, and repented, Psalm. 51. how he dedicated his house
to the Lord, Psalm. 30. how he purged his house of wicked men, Psalm. 101. when
he entered to his kingdom, 144. So a Psalm to his Son Solomon when he was
to succeed into the kingdom Psalm. 72.

Lastly, some Psalms are divided according to the Letters of the Alphabet, as
Psalm. 25. 134. 111. 112. 119. Psalmi alphabetici.
145. These Psalms were distinguished by the Letters that they might keep
them the better in their memories, and as Matthew summeth up the genealogy of
Christ into three fourteen generations for the memories cause: So these
Psalms are set down after the order of the Alphabet to help the memory.
Psalm. 25, wants three Letters (...). Psalm. 111. every verse has two letters
of the Alphabet, and the two last verses have three letters to make up the
Alphabet: So Psalm. 112. has the letters after the same manner. The 119. is
distinguished by the letters of the Alphabet, and here ye shall see, that
every Section as it begins with the letter, so all the verses of that
section began with that same letter; as the first Section begins with (...),
therefore all the eight verses in the first Section begin with (...), etc. So
Psalm. 145. Is set down after the order of the Alphabet, but it wants the
Letter (...). Here some The Syriak Arabic, Seventy and vulgar Latin, add this
verse to Psalm 145. and make it the ^4. verse.
go about to prove by this, that the original Copy is defective, and
therefore the Arabicke translation adds a verse, so do the Seventy and the
Vulgar Latin; but if it be defective here, why do they not supply a verse
likewise in Psalm. 34. where (...) is defective in the Alphabet? we are not to
think that there is any defect in the matter because these letters of the
Alphabet are wanting: for the Lord fitted these letters to the matter only,
and not the matter to the lerters; and because the holy Ghost has not set
down the matter here, therefore the Letter (...) is left out; but not this
ways, because the Letter (...) is wanting here; therefore the matter is
wanting.

The five last Psalms begin with Halleluia, and end with it, because they are
the conclusion and sum of (...)
the whole praises of God. So the Church in the revelation concludes after the
victory with the same words, Reve. 19. 1. Alleluia, salvation and glory and
honor and power unto the Lord our God.

The Conclusion of this is, the Psalms are generally Tehilim praises, from the
most excellent part of them: Therefore our chief care should be to praise God
here in this life, and then in the life to come we shall sing the song of
Moses the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb, Reve. 15. 3.

EXERCITAT. XVIII.
Of the division of the Law and the Prophets, in parashoth and haphtaroth.

Act. 15. 21. For Moses of old time had in every City them that preach him,
being read in their Synagogues every Sabbath day.
THe Scriptures were not divided into Chapters, as we have them now divided,
therefore the Jews (...)
say, that the whole Law is Instar vnius pesuk, that is, but as one verse.

The Old Testament was divided into parashoth and Haphtaroth; this division
into parashoth was most ancient, Act. 8. 32. The place of Scripture which he
read was this, (...)
in the Greek it is (...) the Section, and the Syriacke calls it pasuka.

They distinguished not these parashoth and haphtaroth by numbers, as we do
our Chapters; they said not the first parashah, the second parashah, but they
distinguish them by the first words of the Section; as the first parashah is
called Bereshith, the second Elle toledoth Noah, etc.

They used to divide and distinguish these great parashoth and haphtaroth three
ways. First, they distinguished them with three great P P P. Secondly, they
distinguished (...)
them with three great Samechs, as Gen 20. 10. these Samechs or Semuchoth make
not so great a distinction as when they are distinguished by three great P P P:
for there is some coherence (when they are distinguished (...)
by Samech) with that which goes before. So in the particular parashoth when
ye see them distinguished by parashah or by Semuchah; but only with great
letters, as Genesis 32. 2. this word vaijshlahh begins the parashah in great
letters. (...)


Ioh. 7. 37. In the last day, that great day of the feast, Jesus stood and
cried saying, etc. This was the eight day of the feast of the Tabernacles, and
it is called the great Sabbath. This day they kept Festum laetitiae legis, The
They read three sections upon the eight day of the feast of tabernacles when
the Law was ended,
feast of joy, because they ended the reading of the Law that day; and the next
Sabbath they called it Sabbath bereshith, because they began to read the book
of Genesis again. And ye shall see that this day they read three Haphtaroth
or Sections, the first was haphtaroth elle pekudi lejom sheni shel Succoth, and
it began, 1 King. 7. 51. (...).
So was ended all the words which King Solomon made, etc. And that day Solomon
stood up and blessed the people; So the true Solomon Jesus Christ blessed the
people In that great and last day of the feast. The second haphtarah which was
read this day, was Josh. 1. haphtaroth shimhhath torah. Sectio laetitiae legis,
because the Law was ended, and Joshua began the Prophets. The third (...)
parashah which they read was, Malac. 3. Haphtaroth sabbath hagadol, and it
ended thus, Behold I will send you Eliah the Prophet, and so they joined the
last Section (...)
of the Law, and the last Section of the Prophets both together, and it was in
this day that Jesus Christ stood up and spoke to them; the true Solomon, the
true Joshua, the end of the Law and the Prophets. And whereas the Jews on this
day delighted themselves much with banqueting, and drink; Jesus Christ calls
all those to him who thirst, and he promises to refresh them; If any man
thirst let him come unto me and drink.

Scaliger holds, that the Apostle, Coloss. 2. 16. Let no man Judge you (...)
in part^ Sabbathi, signifies that, which the Hebrews call Parashah, and which
In Elencho trihaeres. cap. 21. page 217.
the Talmud calls Perek or Chelek, or which the Greeks call (...) but the
Apostle means only (...)
here, that he would not have the Jews to condemn the Colossians, for not
observing their Jewish Sabbaths; as he would have the Gentiles to abstain from
things strangled, and blood, Act. 15. 29. That they might not give offense to
the weak Jews.

The Jews say, that this division in Parashoth was most ancient, but the
division into Haphtaroth was later, and they give this to be the reason why
they read these Haphtaroth, they say, when, Antiochus Epiphanes forbad them
under pain of death to read the Law of Moses 1 Macch. 2. then they made
choice of some parts of the Prophets answerable to these parts of the Law.
Example, because they durst not read Petorah beresith. They read Esaias. 42. So
says the Lord Creator of heaven and earth. Example, 2. the second Parasha is
Elle toledoth Noah, now because they durst not read this they read Esaias.
besiman, that is, at the sign 54. (for that which we call a Chapter they call
a sign) Sing ye barren, The reading of Moses and the Prophets more ancient
than Antiochus
etc. But is it likely that Antiochus that great Tyrant, forbad them only the
reading of the five books of Moses? wherefore the reading of Moses and the
Prophets (...).
has been much more ancient than the time of Antiochus: therefore Act. 15.
21. Moses is read of old. A Phrase which signifies a great antiquity.

When they read Moses Law, they divided it in fifty They read the whole Law in
their Synagogues once in the year.
and two Sections, and they finished it once in the year: They had two sorts
of years, there was Annus impraegnatus or Embolimaeus, and Annus Aequabilis.
Annus Impraegnatus was that, which we call Leap year, and it had fifty three
weeks; in this year they divided one Parashah in two parts, and so they ended
the reading Annus impragnatus. embolimaeus.


of the Law within the year. When it was Annus Aequabilis then it had but
fifty two weeks, then they read one Parashah for every Sabbath, and in the last
Sabbath of the year, which was the twenty third of Tishri, they read that
Parashah called Latitia legis, which begins Ioshu. 1. And the next Sabbath
they began beresith again at the first of Genesis.

These Parashoth were subdivided into so many parts, and there were sundry who
read these parts upon the Sabbath, he that read the first, was called Cohen
the Priest, he repeated the first part of the Section; and then rose up
Caizan, or Cantor, who did sing the same part which the Priests had read; then
there rose up in the third place a Levite, and he read his part; Fourthly,
there rose up an Israelite, and he read his part, and at last it came to
Maphtir, and he read the last part of the Haphtorah; he was called Maphtir,
because when (...) a (...) cessare in hiphil dimittere.
that part was read, the people were dismissed, and so the Latin Church said
Ite missa est.

In the week days, they read upon the second and the fifth day of the week,
some part of those Parashoth, but not the whole: and the Pharisee meant of
these two days when he said, I fast twice in the week Luke 18. 12.

The Greek and Latin Fathers never cite Chapters as we do now; Augustine in
his book of retractations, Cap. 24. says not, I have written to Genesis 3.
but this ways, I have written to the casting out of our parents out of
paradise. And Gregory in his Prologue upon the first of the Kings, says; I
have expounded to you from the beginning of the book, unto the victory of
David.

Who divided the Scriptures first into Chapters it is not certain; they were
divided of old two manner of ways; first they divided them into (...) titles,
(for so they called the greater parts) and then into Chapters as into lesser
parts: others again divided them into Chapters as into greater parts. It is
holden, that Musaeus presbiter Ecclesiae Massiliensis divided them first into
titles; Genebrard, Chronologia.
and subdivided them into Chapters. According to this first division Matthew
had sixty three titles, and three hundredth and fifty five Chapters. So Luke
according to the ancient division had forty eight titles, and three hundredth
and forty eight chapters.

He who began this latter division into Chapters, is holden to be Hugo
Cardinalis: according to this division Matthew has twenty and eight Chapters,
and Luke twenty and four, etc.

Lastly, it was divided into verses: this division into Pesuchim or verses, the
Masoreth found out first amongst the Jews: The Greeks called them (...).
Scaliger calls them Commata, and Robertus Stephanus calls them
Sectiunculas, and some hold that it was he that found them out first amongst
us.

EXERCITAT. XIX.
Of the sense of the Scriptures.

THere is but one literal sense in the Scriptures, which is profitable for
doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness, 2 Timothy 3. 16.

To make diverse senses in the Scripture, is to make it like that (...) which
Anaxagoras dreamed of, making Quidlibet ex quolibet. Augustine writing to
Vincentius, justly derideth the Donatists who constructing August. Epist. 48.
these words, Cant. 1. 7. Tell me (o thou whom my soul loves) where thou
feedest, where thou make thy flocks to rest at noone; They gathered out of
them that the Church of Christ was only in Africa by their allegorical
application. Origin was too much given to these allegories, and therefore he
missed often the true sense of the Scriptures.

These who gathered diverse senses out of the Scripture, do little better with
them, than Esope did with an inscription written in a pillar of Marble, in
which were written these seven letters (...). Esope first read them thus,
(...), id est, abscedens gradus quatuor fodiens invenies thesaurum auri. But
Xanthus his master finding, as he had spoken, a great treasure of Gold, and
giving nothing to Esope for his conjecture, kept all to himself, therefore
Esope read them another way thus, (...), id est, qui tollitis dum ahitis,
dividite quem invenistis thesaurum auri. But when Esope got nothing, in a rage
he read it thus, (...). id est, read Regi Dionysio, quem invenisti thesaurum
auri.

The Jews hold that there is a literal sense in every Scripture, and a
mystical sense; the literal sense they call Dabhar katon, rem parvam, and the
mystical sense they call it Dabhar gadol, rem magnam, the literal (...)
sense they call it peshath, sensum nudum, and the mystical sense they call it
darash; and most of the Schoolmen hold that there is a double sense in the
Scriptures. Latomus the Papist says, Theologiam crassam versari circa
literalem sensum, theologiam subtiliorem versari circa mysticum and allegoricum
sensum, and they call the literal sense panperem and grammaticum, and the
allegorical Divitem and theologicum, the rich and theological sense. But we
must strive to find out the literal sense of the Scriptures, or else we shall
never come by the true meaning.

The literal sense is that which the words bear either properly or
figuratively, therefore he said well who said, bonus grammaticus, bonus
theologus: for we can never come to the true meaning and sense, unless the
words be unfolded.

A figurative literal sense is either in verbis vel in rebus, either in the
words or in the matter.

In verbis, in the words, as Luke 13. 32. Herod is a Fox Psalm. 22. 12. The
princes of Israel are Bulls of Basan, in these words there is but one sense. So
Let the dead bury the dead, Luke 9. 50. Dead in soul bury the dead in body,
here is but one sense; but where the words in one sentence have diverse
significations, then they make up diverse senses, as judge not that ye be not
judged, Mat. 7. 1. the first is, judicium libertatis, the second is, judicium
Iudicium libertatis. potestatis.


potestatis.

When we search to find out the literal sense of the Scripture, that cannot
be the literal sense of it which is contrary to the analogy of faith, which
is either in credendis or in faciendis. If it be contrary to the articles of
our faith or any of the commandments, then that cannot be the literal sense,
as Romans 12. 20. If thine enemy be hungry give him meat, if he thirst give him
drink: for in so doing, thou shall heap coals of fire upon his head. Here to
feed the enemy, and to give him drink, are to be taken literally, because
they are commanded in the sixth Commandment: but to heap coals of fire upon
his head, must be taken figuratively, because according to the letter, it is
contrary to the sixth Commandment. Example, 2. Matthew. 5. 29. If thy right eye
offend thee* pluck it out, and cast it from thee, Here the words are not to be
taken literally, for this were contrary to the sixth Commandment, but
figuratively. So this is my body, is not to be taken literally, for it is
contrary to the analogy of faith: because the heavens must contain the body
of Christ until he come again, Act. 3. 21.

The second is figurative in rebus, as in the Sacrament of the Supper, when he
sat with his Disciples he said, This is my body; he points at the thing
present, and understands the thing that is not present; he had the bread and
cup in his hand, and he said, This is my body, This is my blood, In these
propositions there is the subject and the attribute; the subject is the bread
and wine which he does demonstrate; the attribute is that which is signified by
the bread and wine, and these two make up but one sense, propius and remotius;
when Peter had made a confession that Christ was the Son of the living God,
Matthew. 16. Christ to confirm this unto him, and to the rest of the Disciples,
says, Tu es Petrus, and super hanc petram, etc. he points at Peter, but he
understands himself, upon whom the Church is Peter. When a man looks upon
a picture, he says, this picture is my father, here he understands two
things, propius and remotius, to wit the picture it self, and his father
represented by the picture; this picture at which he points is not his
father properly, but only it represents his father.

But some will object, when it is said, Hic est sanguis meus, that the article
hic agrees with Sanguis, and not Vinum, therefore it may seem that it is his
blood indeed, and not wine that he points at.

This cannot be, for in the former proposition when hoc est corpus meum, he
should have said, hic est corpus meum; because it repeateth the word panis as
it is more clear in the Greek, therefore the article hic has relation to
some other thing, than to the bread at which he points, for the article (...)
repeateth not (...) or (...), the bread or the wine, but (...) and (...), his
body and his blood. When Moses said, Exodus 24. 8. Behold the blood of the
Covenant, here the word blood is properly to be understood: because their
covenants were confirmed with blood, and there was no sacrifice without blood.
But when Christ said, This is my blood of the New Testament, there was no blood
in the Cup here, but he had relation to his own blood, which was signified by
the wine in the Cup.

When Christ says, This is my body, This is my blood,

A thing is said to be present four manner of ways, first, (...), secondly,
(...), thirdly, (...),

First, (...); when a man is bodily present. Secondly, (...), as when a man is
present by his picture. Thirdly, (...), as the sun is present by operation in
heating and nourishing things below here. Fourthly, (...), when we apprehend a
thing in our mind. Christ when he said, this is my body, and this is my blood,
he was present there (...), but he was not in the bread and the wine (...), for
then his blood should have been there before it was shed; then he should have
had two bodies, one visible and another invisible: but he was present there in
the bread and the wine (...), because the bread and the wine represented his
body, and his blood: So he was present there (...), by his Spirit working in
their hearts and he was present to them by faith (...), when they did
spiritually eat his body and drink his blood, and this is the true and
literal sense of the words.

Which is the literal sense in those words, Hoc facite in mei recordationem,
do this in remembrance of me?

Although there be many things employed in these upon the part of the Minister;
Take this bread, bless this bread, break it and give it to the people. And
upon the part of the people; take this bread, eat this bread, etc. yet all
these look but to one thing, that is, to the remembrance of Christ's death: and
therefore the external action brings to mind the internal action, the
remembrance of Christ's death: so that in these words there is but one sense.

When the testimonies of the old Testament are cited Testimonies of the old
Testament cited in the New, make but one sense.
in the new, the Spirit of God intends propinquius and remotius, something
nearer and something farther off; yet these two make not up two diverse senses,
but one full and entire sense. When Jonathan shot three Arrows to advertise
David, 1 Samuel 20. 20. he had not two meanings in his mind, but one: his
meaning was to show David how Saul his father was minded toward him, and
whether he might abide or fly: So the meaning of the holy Ghost is but one in
these places. Example, 2 Samuel 7. 1^. The Lord makes a promise to David, I will
set up thy seed after thee which shall proceed out of thy bowels. This promise
looked both ad propius and remotius, yet it made up but one sense, propius to
Solomon, and remotius to Christ: therefore when he looks (...) a radico (...)
and non a (...) lex. (...) significa^ f^rmam. 2 Chronicles. 17. 17.
to the farthest, to Christ, 2 Samuel 7. 19. he says, Zoth torath, Haec est
delineatio hominis Dei, it should not be read, is this the Law of the man O
Lord God? as if David should say, this is not all that thou have promised to me
O Lord, that I should have a son proceeding out of my own loins, but in him
thou do prefigure to me a son, who shall be both God and man: and he
adds For a great while to come, thou do promise to me a son presently to
succeed in my kingdom, but I see besides him a far off the blessed Messiah.
And he applies this promise literally to his son Solomon, and figuratively
to Christ his Son; taking the promise in a larger extent; and the matter may
be cleared by this comparison. A father has a son who is far from him, he
bids the Tailor shape a coat to him, and to take the measure by another
child who is there present, but withal he bids the Tailor make it larger;
because his child will wax taller: So this promise made to David was first cut
out (as it were) for Solomon his son, but yet it had a larger extent: for it
is applied to Christ who is greater than Solomon: and as by a sphere of wood
we take up the celestial spheres: So by the promises made to David concerning
Solomon, we take up him who is greater than Solomon; and these two make but up
one sense. When a man fixes his eye upon one to behold him, another man
accidentally comes in, in the mean time; he casts his eyes upon that man
also: So the Lords eye was principally upon the Messiah, but he did cast a
look, as it were, also to Solomon.

When these testimonies are applied in the New Testament, A Scripture diversely
applied, does make up but one literal sense.
the literal sense is made up sometimes of the type and the thing typed.
Example, Ioh. 19. 36. A bone of him shall not be broken. This is spoken both of
the bones of the Paschall Lamb, and of the bones of Christ; and both of them
make up but one literal sense.

Sometimes the literal sense is made up ex historico and allegorico, as Sara
and Hagar, the bond woman and the free, signify the children of the promise
begotten by grace, and the bond servants under the Law; and these two make up
but one sense.

Sometimes ex tropologico and literali, as, Ye shall not mussle the mouth of
the Ox that treads out the corn, 1 Cor. 8. 9.

Fourthly, the literal sense is made up ex historico, mystico and prophetico.
Example, Ier. 31. 15. A voice was heard in Ramah, lamentation and bitter
weeping, Rachel weeping for children, refusing to be comforted for her
children because they were not. There was a voice heard in Ramah for Ephraims
captivity, that is, for the ten Tribes who came of Joseph the son of Rahel,
this mourning was because the ten Tribes should not be brought back again
from the captivity, this was mystical and not prophetical, that she mourned
for the ten Tribes who were led away into captivity; but it was prophetical
foretelling the cruel murder which Herod committed in killing the infants not
far from Rahels grave; all these are comprehended in this prophecy, and make
up one full sense.

When a testimony is cited out of the Old Testament in the new, the Spirit of
God intends, that this is the proper meaning in both the places, and that
they make not up two diverse senses. Example, the Lord says, make fat the
hearts of this people, Esa. 6. 9. and Christ says, Matthew. 13. 14. In them is
fulfilled this prophecy. This judgment to make fat the hearts, was denounced
against the Jews in Esaias time at the first, Act. 23. 16. Well spakethe holy
Ghost by Isaiah the Prophet, it was fulfilled upon the Jews who lived both in
Christ's time and in Paul's time. Esaias when he denounced this threatening, he
meant not only of the Jews who lived then, but also of the Jews who were to
come after; and it was literally fulfilled upon them all.

Example, 2. Esa. 61. 7. The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he has
anointed me to preach the Gospel, this prophecy is cited by Christ, Luke 4.
18. and it is only meant of Christ, and literally to be applied to him.

Example 3. Esaias. 49. 6. I will give thee for a light to the Gentiles, Christ
went not in proper person to preach to the Gentiles himself, but he went to
them by his Apostles, therefore Act. 31. 47. Paul says, the Lord has
commanded me to go and be a light to the Gentiles, this is the proper sense
and meaning of the Prophet Esaias in this place.

When the testimonies of the Old Testament are cited in the new, they are not
cited by way of Accommodation, but because they are the proper meaning of the
places; if they were cited by Christ and his Apostles only by way of
accommodation; then the Jews might have taken exception, and said, that these
testimonies made nothing against them: because it was not the meaning of the
holy Ghost who indicted these Scriptures to speak against them. But Christ and
his Apostles bring out these testimonies, as properly meant of them, and not by
way of accommodation only.

We must make a distinction betwixt these two, Destinatam applicationem, and
per accommodationem, Destinata Applicatio destinata per accommodatione


is this, when the spirit of God intends that to be the meaning of the
place. Applicatio per accommadationem is this, when a preacher applies the
Testimonies of the scriptures for comfort or rebuke to his hearers, this is not
destinata applicatio; sed per accomodationem. A man makes a suit of apparel
for one, that is Destinatum Per accommodationem. When Nathan said to David, the
Lord also has put away thy sin, thou shall not die, 2 Samuel 12. 13. this was
destinata applicatio, but when a preacher now applies this to one of his
hearers, this is, but per accommodationem, the scriptures are written for our
Admonition, upon whom the ends of the world are come. 1 Cor. 10. 11. And they
are profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in
righteousness, 2 Timothy 3. 16. They serve to rebuke all obstinate sinners, and
to comfort all penitent when they are applied rightly: but when the Apostles
applied their comforts and threatenings, they had a more particular insight to
whom they belonged, than Preachers have now, and knew particularly what
Scriptures were directed to such and such men. When Esaias prophesied, make fat
the hearts of this people. Esaias. 6. 9. And when Paul applied it to the Jews in
his time, it was destinata applicatio: but when a Preacher applies it to his
hearers now, it is per accommodationem only, for he cannot so particularly
apply it to his hearers, as Paul did to his.

Where there are two several testimonies found in the old Testament, and
joined together in the new Testament, these two make but one literal sense, as
Esaias 62. 11. Say to the daughter of Sion, behold thy Salvation comes. So Zach.
9. 9. O Daughter of Sion, O Daughter of Jerusalem, behold thy King comes
riding upon an Ass, and upon an Ass Coalt: Matthew citing these places cap.
23. joyneth them both together, and shows that both Esaias and Zachary meant
of Christ coming in humility and not in glory, and these two make up but one
literal sense.

This is a special note to know the literal sense of the Scripture, when this
phrase is added; That the Scripture A Note to know the literal sense of the
Scripture.
might be fulfilled: As Ioh. 13. 18. But that the Scripture may be fulfilled,
he that eats bread with me, has lift up his heel against me. This place
was spoken first by David of Achitophel Psalm. 41. 10. But it was fulfilled
literally in Judas who betrayed Christ.

Example 2. Ioh. 17. 12. Those that thou gave me I have kept, and none of
them is lost, but the son of Perdition, that the Scripture might be
fulfilled. This place was first spoken of Doeg, Psalm. 109. 7. and this
Scripture is fulfilled in Judas, therefore this is the literal sense of it;
the figure was in Doeg, and the thing figured in Judas.

Example 3. Ioh. 19. 24. Let us not rent it, but cast lots whose it shall be,
that the Scriptures might be fulfilled which said; They parted my raiment
amongst them, and for my Vesture they did cast Lots. Saul's Courtiers rent
David's dignities and honors amongst them, but the Scripture was fulfilled
literally here by the Soldiers.

Example 4. Ioh. 19. 36. For these things were done that the Scripture might be
fulfilled, a bone of him shall not be broken. The type was observed in the
Paschall Lamb, but the Scripture is fulfilled here literally in Christ.

But it may be said. 1 Cor. 10. 6. 11. All these things happened to them in
figures, then they signified some other thing to us than to them.

They were types to us, that is, examples, they were Moses, the patience of
Job; These were not types properly but examples. So these things which befell
the Jews in the wilderness for their murmuring and committing whoredom are
set down for examples to the Corinthians and posterity to come, they were ad
(...) and (...) they serve to admonish and instruct us, that we fall not into
the like sins, 2 Timothy 3. 16.

It may be alleged that there are more literal senses in Caiaphas prophesied
that one should die for the people, Ioh. 11. 49. In Christ's meaning they had
one sense, and in Caiaphas meaning they had another sense.

This Prophecy must not be considered as one, but as two; the Spirit of God
had one meaning and Caiaphas had another, but the Scriptures which were
inspired by the holy Spirit had but one sense.

Where the holy Ghost makes a mystical application of the old Testament to
the new, that is Destinata applicatio; And arguments taken from thence hold
firmly. Example, Exodus 16. 18. He that gathered much had nothing over, and he
that gathered less had no lake, the Apostle 2 Cor. 8. 15. applies this
morally to all the faithful, and reduces things to a certain equality; that
those who are rich in temporary things, should bestow their alms upon the
poorer sort, and the poor, being richer in Spiritual things, might communicate
to the richer, their prayers and Spiritual helps.

When we apply the testimonies of the old Testament and borrow comparisons from
them, it is not destinata applicatio sed per accommodationem.

The conclusion of this is. There is but one literal sense and meaning of
every scripture: So should men

The Sciences which are speculative prepare a way to these which are practick,
although they be not directly deduced from them; and therefore some have called
them parents to them.

The attributes of God, are called the ways of God.

To eat blood while the life is in it, is forbidden by a moral precept; but to
eat cold blood was that which was forbidden by the ceremonial precept.

And he measured the wall thereof according to the measure of a man, that is,
of an Angel. Revel. 21. 17. Because he appeared in the likeness of a man.

Although Esdras who wrote the book of Nehemiah, could not be living at that
time, when Iaddus met Alexander, yet some of the masters of the great Synagogue
have been alive then who had the gift of prophecy, and insert the Genealogy
of the Priests here, until the Macedonian Empire.

Page 58. l. 18.

It may seem that the gift of Prophecy ceased long before the Macedonian
Empire, Psalm. 74. 9. We see not our signs, there is no more any Prophet,
neither is there any amongst us that knows how long.

We must distinguish betwixt ceasing of Prophecy, in the time of the
Captivity, which this Psalm speaks of, but it ceased not, it was
intermitted for a time, as Amos threatened Amos, 8. 11.

This was a great miracle, the man being old, and having the disease thirty
eight years. The Angel came down at certain times (...). So Mat. 27. 15.
(...) at the feast the governor was wont to release to them a prisoner. (...)
is taken here distributive, they used to let a prisoner go at their three
great feasts; so the Angel came down here, as it seems, at the Pentecost,
and at their other great feasts when the people were gathered at Jerusalem:
confer, Ioh. 4. 36. with 5. 1. And mark here a great difference betwixt the
coming down of the Angel into the poole, and the coming down of the holy
Ghost in tongues, of fire at the Pentecost; the Angel healed but one, but then
many were cured of all diseases.

The agreement of the holy writers; Moses, Elias, and Christ were together in
the mount. Mat. 17. 3. So Rev. 15. 3. They sing the song of Moses the servant
of God, and the song of the Lamb.

1 Macch. 3. 48. And laid open the book of the Law, wherein the heathen had
sought to paint the likeness of their Images. The heathen sought if they could
get any warrant for their jmages out of the Scriptures to paint their Images by
it.

The place in the hebrew text which seems to be corrupted is Psalm. 22. 18.
When they read Caari for Caaru, Caari, sicut leo, for Caaru foderunt; but R.
Jacob Ben Chaijm, shows that this reading is but late, for (...) pro (...) In
calce bibliorum Rabbinorum.
there was no such difference betwixt the oriental and occidentall Jews in
their reading, neither was this place one of the places in which they differed.

Words that are proper cannot be translated as appellatives, nor appellatives
as proper, Mat. 16. 18. Thou art Peter and upon this rock, etc. It cannot be
translated, thou art a rock, and upon this Peter, etc.

Esdras wrote none of the books over again which were written before the
captivity but only set them in order.
