A DEFENSE OF CATHOLICS PERSECVTED IN ENGLAND, Inuincibly proving their holy
Religion to be that which is the only true Religion of Christ; and that they in
professing it, are become most faithful, dutiful, and loyal Subjects, to
God, their King and Country. And therefore are rather to be honored and
respected, then persecuted or molested. Composed by an old studien^ in
Divinity.

Let none of you suffer as a murderer, or a thief, or a railer, or a coueter
of other men's things, But if as a Christian, let him not be ashamed, but let
him glorify God in this name. 1. Pet. 4.

THE FIRST CHAPTER.
By way of a Preface to the persecuted Catholics, and by them to their
Persecutours: of the Innocence, perfection, and honor of them and their
spiritual Pastors, renowned Priests.

1. RENOWNED Catholics of Eng^and, mo^^ reno^ned Cat^o^^kes (...) perse^u^ed
^or your (...) ^eligi^^, give leave to one, your old, humble and unworthy
servant ^n Christ, Associate, and Partaker now with you, and you^ renow^ed
Predecessors, a long time f^o^ his youth ^o old age in pris^n, pe^^^cution,
(...), and tribulation for the most holy Ca^^olike ^aith, and Religion, to
remember hi^ love and du^ie to you: as also the boun^en duty and office of us
all (as true servants) to our Master Christ in so noble, and just a cause with
the honor, reward, and recompense, which is his ordinary pay to all his
faithful servants in such his affairs, far more eminent and excellent the
any Potentate, Prince, or Persecutour on earth can either take away or give
unto us; or any of them, or we in this world enjoy.

2. Let me begin with you as Saint Cyprian that glorious Bishop and Martyr
did, with the constant Martyrs and Confessors of his Country and time. Quibus
ego vos laudibus praedic^m fortissimi Martyrs? etc. O most valiant Cyprian.
^pis^^l. ad (...) and Conf^^sor. ^^ ^pist. 6.
Martyrs with what praises may I blase you forth? with what cri^s of voce may I
adorn the fortitude of you^ heart, and perseverance of faith? you have endured
even to the consu^mation of glory in your examinatio^s, most hard torments.
You have not given place to punishments: but they have rather yealded to you.
Crowns have ministered an end to those griefs, to which torments gave no and.
And presently after he adds. The multitude of those which were present, has
seen the heavenly fight of God, the spiritual wa^re of Christ, his se^uants
to have stood with a free voice, an uncorrupted mind, a divine force, naked
truly of wordlie weapons, but armed with the shield of faith.

3. Let me speak unto you, and of you, especially chief Prelate and Pastors,
Priests, and persecuted Clergy of England, and of your late Predecessors on
earth, and now happy in heaven, as Saint John Chrysostom thus performed to
the two most glorious Apostles Saint Peter and Saint Paul. Quasnam Chrys^st.
se^^. de SS. Apostolis Petr. and ^aul. ^p. Metaphr^st and in Breuiadie 6. Iulij.
vobis referemus g^atias, qui tantum pro nobis labora^tis? memenitu^ Petre and
obstupesco: recordor tui Paul, and excedens mente lachrymis opprimor. etc.
What ^hankes shall we give unto you, who have labored so much for us? o Peter
I remember thee and am astoni^ed. O Paul I call the to mind: and with excess
t^ere^f ame oppressed with tears For what shall I speak, or what shall I
utter, when I behold you^ afflictions: I cannot tell. How many prisons have you
sanctified? what chains have you adorned? what ^orments have ^ou sustained?
what curses or reproaches have you suf^ered? how have you borne Christ? how
with your prea^hing have you ioyed Churches? blessed are the instru^ents of
your tongue: your members are sprinkled with blood for the Church. You have
imitated and followed Christ in all things.

4. I do not, I dare not, compare my self ^o those great lights Bishops, and
Rulers in ^he Church of Christ or such as be under our ^upreame Pa^^our, of
that highest Order, to ^home I owe all duty and respect. yet as an ^ld student
in holy ^e^^ing, having read ^uch, and written not a little for the defense ^f
you, and the cause of God, without any ^ust control, (never adhearing unto, or
rea^hing suspected or vnsou^d doctrine of sweare^ing, churchinge, ch^p^^^ge,
sword* ^^^^ing, ^r such like stuff,) may now more bould^y ^rite, and wish I
had S. Cyprian his learned ^eale, and S. Chrysostom his golden mouth, or pen
to lay down the worth and due o^ you all most renowned Teachers, Learnes, and
Sufferers in this cause, the cause of Christ* For although the most reuer^nd
Father in God Richard Bishop of Chalcedon, and the holy, learned, reuered
Priests of England ar^ not in person those greatest, or others, among the
Apostles; yet they all, both ou^ Bishop and Priests in their Episcopal an^
Priestlie Order (Preaching and teaching a they did, and deriuing Succession,
both i^ doctrine and dignity f^^m them, if we man believe the Apostles, and
Apostolic me^ Clem. Rom^^. Cost. Apost. l 2. ^ ^5.
and witnesses) do supply the^r p^ace, and a^^ so to be obeyed. Presbyteri,
si assidue in studio decend: verbum Dei laborauerint, Apostolorum locu^ tenent.
Sacerdo^es sunt omnes Domini Apostoli, q^ n^que agros, neque domos haeteaitant
hic, sed sempe^ Altar^ and Deo seruiunt: If Priests will continually labor in
the study of teaching the word of God, the s^all inioye the pla^e of the
Apostles. Priests are all t^^ Apostles of our Lord, who inheriteth here neith^
feil^s nor houses, but alw^yes they serve God and th^^ neighbor. Eis qui in
Ecclesia sunt Presbyteris obedi^ ^rinaeus l. 4. c. 20. 43.

^nour. Qui (...) habeantur maxim (...) and do^^a: The Priests that (...)
w^ll, let them be esteemed ^r^hie of duble honor: ^^specially they that labor
in ^ word and do^trine. and I may auerre that ho^ conversation wh^^^ you with
so many dif^ulties possess* ^n forsaking all to follow ^rist, to teach,
preach, and do other ^esslie functions, to be the Apostolical life ^d
calling. Our Protestant persecutours alwhich do acknowledge you for true and
^full Priests, and do attribute so much to ^aching, and most highly d^e
commend ^r holy Apostolic predecessors, Priests ^ Monckes (who lived as you
do in the ^e of the Britons, before all of the Reli^us Protest. Th^^tor of
great Brit. God Win. Conue^s. ^f Brit.
Orders that came hither in the Saxons ^e) should not otherwise use you then ^h
honor and respect: especially when al^es, even from the beginning of Christia^e
here they find it so.

^. In the very first age, yea in the A^les time they auo^ch that S. Joseph and
Associates our first Religious, disconti^d their Monastical life to preach the
^h. Abbot Fecknam did allege out of S. Gildas in the first Parliament of
Queen Elizabeth, that Pope Elutherius, in his time sent from their Monastical
life such hither to preach. S. German and S. Lupus Religious of Lycinum
Monastery were sent hither into Britonie by S. Celestin, before they were
Bishops, to the same end and purpose. When our renowned English Apostle S.
Gregori^ took religious Monckes, S. Augustine an^ others out of his own
Monastarie, to sen^ them hither to preach to the vnbeleeuin^ Saxons, and hey
terrified with the labou^ and perils of such an Apostolical life, desred
rather to return to their quiet Monast^call conversation, he urged them, and
se^ them forward: because this Apostolical li^ was most perfect, and had
greatest reward ^ heaven. Omniinstantia, omnique seruore quae i^ Gregorius
Epist. ad Monachos in Angl. destin^nd. Bed hi^^or ^ccle. l. 1. c. 23.
choastis, Deo authore peragite: sciences quod labor^ magnum mayor retribution
i^ gloria sequitur* With for^e and seruour finish that you have by the mo^^ of
God begun, assuring your selves, that after your gr^ labor eternal reward
shall follow. And the Berdictine Monckes in their Trithemius, a^ others do
glory much, (and not witho^ cause) of the many Bishops, Archbisho^ Cardinals,
and Popes of their Order by t^ title of Apostolical Mission. Our Benectines
also of the English Congregation, snites, Dominicans, Franciscans, and
Car^lites with dispen^^tion from his Holiness, h^ left the rigor of their Rule
and Order, ^ better to apply themselves here in our country for the
converting of soule^, as in a vocation of greater merit and higher perfection;
preferring the Apostolical preaching life in ^his time and place, before the
exact and pro^essed observation of their own particular Orders, thereby to
notify unto us and all, that this Apostolical priestlie life (ever from ^he
beginning of Christianity here or in the ^orld) was the most perfect and most
excel^nt calling and profession, pleasing to God, ^rofitable to his Church, and
honorable in ^he professors thereof.

7. All our old holy Bishops, Colleges, Monasteries, Seminaries, or Schools
of lear^ed Christians, such as by our Protestants ^onfession were here extant
in every age, ^uouis saeculo extiterunt: (and long before Matthew. Parker,
Antiquit. Britun. Ion. Iosilin. hist. Eccles. manuscript.
Gregory was Pope, or that he did or could and any Monckes, of what Order
soever in^ England, or any part of Britonie) sent most ^oly and learned
priests, by allowance of the ^e Apostolic to preach in France, Ger^anie,
Denmark, Friseland, Bauaria, Nor^ay, Ireland, Greenland, and into other ^rts
of the world diverse times, and in great ^mber, as it shall be hereafter more
largly ^clared. Knowing both by holy Scriptures ^d the testimony of Christ
himself, that ^is Apostolical condition, a signed by him his dearest
Apostles, first taught and pra^ised in himself, not only to forsake all
external wordlie things, as Religious men do, or be bound to do, but ^or a
man to deny himself, the saving of his health, liberty and life, daily
exposing them to loss, and often loosing them for the love of Christ, (truly
following him in saving many souls that were in danger otherwise eternally to
perish) is the most absolutely perfect calling, and profession in the Church of
God.

8. Monastical life by abnegation is a State of perfection, and a safe way to
save the professers soul; but to save both his own and many others by a more
perfect abnegation, must needs be the greatest perfection* and following of
Christ. Si quis vult post me venire, abneget Luc. ^.
semeti^sum, and tollat crucem suam quo^idie and sequatur me: If any man will
come after me, let hi^ deny himself, and take up his cross daily and follow
me. And our Savior when he demand* of Saint Peter his greatest and most
louin^ Apostle. Diligis me plus his? Loves ^hou me more the John. 21.
these? Saint Peter answered. Yea Lord. The^ our Savior rep^ied twice, Pasce
agnos meo^ Feed my lambs. And at S. Peter's third answe^ to the same demand,
he added, p^sce oues me^ feed my sheep. And to his Apostles he said Bonus
Pastor animam suam dat pro ouibus suis: a go^ John. 10.
Pastor gives his life for his sheep. And Maiore^ hac dilectionem nemo habet,
quam vt anima^ John. 15.
suam ponat quis pro amicis suis: Greater love the this no man ^ath, that a man
yeald his life for h^ friends.

9. This Pastoral office and dignity was ever accounted so perfect and
excellent, that in all times, even out of danger, it was esteemed among the
best Religious, a perfection and honor, for any with them to be preferred to
Episcopal, or such pastoral charge of souls. Therefore the highest
Consistory, to wit the Court of Rome, has most justly and publicly declared
the renowned Priests of England to be Ordinis Apostolici: Of the (most perfect
and excellent) Apostolic order: And as their Order is the same with the
Apostles, so they do deduce their never yet interrupted Frane, Godw. Pref. to
the Catal. of Bish. conuers. of Brit. pa. 6.
succ^s^ion therein, even from the highest and chiefest Apostle Saint Peter
himself: from whom so to derive it, (to speak in public Protestant words.)
We should account it a great glory to our Nation, to derive the pedigree of
our spiritual lineage, from so noble and excellent a father as S. Peter. For
both Greek, Latin, Ancient, Later, Catholic an Protestant writers assure
Sim. Metaphr. in SS. Petr. and Paul. Antiquit-Graec. ib and apud Surin Sanct.
Petr. Theater of Brit. l. 6. Camden in Brit. Nic^phor. apud ^^^.
us, that S. Peter came hither into Britonie. Simon Petrus qui fundamen^um esse
Eccles^ae desinitus est tanquam p^oba^issimus discipulus, etc. Simon Peter, who
like a most approved disciple was declared to be the f^undation, of the Church,
as more powerful then all the rest, was commanded to illuminate the obscurer
parts of the world in the west, and he could entirely fulfull the command. He
came into Britonie, in which place after he had staid long, drawn many people
to the faith, erected Churches, and ordained Bishops, Priests, and Deacons, in
the twelfth year of the Emperor Nero he returned to Rome again. The best
Protestant Antiquaries do hold this for so unquestionable a truth in
Histories, that they cry out against any that should doubt thereof. Quid ni
crederemus? why should Cambd^n supra.
we not beleeu^?

10. Some say that Saint Philip the Apostle (and others would have it, the
great Apostle Saint Peter) sent S. Joseph and his Religious company of
Glastenburie hither. But S. Peter, being already proved, to be here before their
coming, and after it, might well allow, and approve of their coming, and
being here: but I see not how he did send them hither. And as our best
Antiquities deliver, they all died without leaving any Successors here, until
Pope Elutherius and King Lucius time. But for our Succession of our holy
Catholic Clergy Priests, it was never yet interrupted, but continued from S.
Peter here unto this day (notwithstanding any howsoever outrageous tempest of
Persecution, of whatsoever enemies of Christian truth, Infidels or Heretics,)
in great number, and constancy by all writers, none denying or making doubt
thereof. And our Protestat Antiquaries themselves do generally confess, and
particularly recompt many Bishops, Priests and other Clergy men to have
continued here in every age both in the Britons and Saxons time without any
interruption at all. To^ tantaque Presbyterorum, Monachorum, Praesulum,

Sediumque vetusta nomina quae quouis saeculo extiteru^t: So many old names of
Priests, Monckes, Prelates, Bishops, Churches, Monasteries, Episcopal Sees
which in every age were extant: And under the Saxons and English, both of
Bishops and Priests, with their Succession of Bishops, until the first
Parliament of Queen Elizabeth.

11. Neither do our Protestants, as latly in public Parliament, make their
Religi^, to which they would violently enforce you any older then that dare,
almost 80. years old: neither can they (except leaping backward over Queen
Mary's Reign, they would patch 4. years of you^ge King Edwards you^ger
Religion unto it) show any Edict, Decree, Statute Parliament, or any public
proposal or command even by temporal power for any Religion, use or
profession therein, to which they would pull, and drive you but from such
young times and Tutors in Religion. That which is true Religion must have so
many hundreds of years in age more as then were, and now are from Christ and
his Apostles days: and other Apostles and Proposers then King Edward, and
Queen Elizabeth who persecuted, and in what they could did suppress the true,
old, Catholic, Apostolic, and Christian Religion, But in so doing, and in
whatsoever they did or could do, they only could invent, o^ give allowance
unto a new, but not a true Religion. Therefore if this only and nothing else
were to be said unto you, or for you in this cause, you are secure, you suffer
for Justice you are blessed here, and by that title shall (so perseuerin^) be
eternally happy in heaven: Bishops, Priests, Monckes, Religious and lay
Catholics not so persecuted may perish, but perseuering constantly in
persecution for Christ's cause they cannot perish: Beati qui persecutionem
patiuntur propter Matthew. 5.
Iustitiam: Blessed are they that suffer persecution for Justice: As the cause,
confirm^d by Christ himself, confirms: Quoniam ipsorum est regnum coelorum:
Because theirs is the Kingdom of heaven. This quoniam: because. Is more
particular unto you: for it is almost proper unto our Priests and their
Predecessors in this holy war* which Christ said to his Apostles, Vos
^estimon^um perhibe^itis, quia ab initio mecum John. 15.
estis: You s^all give testimony, because you are with me from the beginning.
It is theirs and their childrens in Christ, Vos autem estis qui permansistis
mecum in tentationibus men's. You are they that have Luck 22.
remained with me in my temptations. It is true of them and all such Catholics
of whom Saint Paul said to the Romans. Fides vestra annuntiatur ^^ Romans 1.
in vniuerso mundo: Your faith is renowned in the whole world. This of your
faith and constancy therein, and of your obedience and sufferings. Vestra
obedienti^ in omnem locum diuulgata est: Your obedience is published into every
place. ^d Romans 16.


12. If Christ will confess all before his father, which is in heaven, who do
confess him before men on earth, this confession of you that have been so
long Spectaculum: Aspectacle, 1. Corint. 4.
to Angels, and men will be great: if every one that is persecuted for Justice,
shall have his reward in heaven, what will their honor be, which have suffered
so much, and so long time for that cause? Your Protestant Adversaries and
Persecutours themselves taking the altitude of your miseries and sufferings for
this greatest justice, have found their elevation to be raised to the hight of
all former Persecutours; who were Pagans, professed enemies to Christ, and all
Christians. They which profess Christ, and Christianity may not be such.
Great was the persecution of Nero, and yet Britonie felt it not, but was then a
Refuge, A^yle, and as a Sanctuary, to receive and defend the persecuted Bitter
was Dioclesiaus Persecution here in Britonie, but as our Gildas tells us it
was but N^u^nnis: of nine years only; at which time the Scots, ^^cts, Saxons,
Gormundians, A^ricans, and D^nes ^ll Pagans persecuted the Christi^s here. But
never any bearing the name of Christ before ^hese days persecuted the
Catholic Chri^tians of this Kingdom. All those Pagans ^ersecuted Christians
as enemies to their old Gods, and Religion, and for not joining ^ith them in
Idolatry, deeming Christian ^eligion new and erroneous. Our Protestant
Persecutours persecute us for defending the old Religion of Christ, which
cannot be untrue, and for not embracing their new, which in the School of
Christ cannot be true.

13. All the Pagans that ever persecuted here, distroied not ^o many Churches
and Chapels, as King Henry the eight and his daughter Elizabeth, nor took
from the Church the half of that which they did. Halse such a Fine and Ransom
as the Catholics paid to them, above the third part of England in Religious
Church Lands, (possessed by the Clergy here Sixhundred years since) besides
other for fitures, would have stopped the Pagans Persecution. The Saxons
greatest Persecution next to Dioclesians, soon slacked and rele^ted: no soon
^r had the Saxons driven Theonus and Thadiocus Archbishops of London and York
with other Bishops, Priests and Religious from their Sees, and Residences, in
the year of Christ 586. But King Ethelbert of Kent ruling unto Huber, by
means of his blessed Christian Queen^ Bertha, and her holy Bishop S. Lethard,
gau^ ease and peace to Christians here before S. Augustines and his Associates
coming hither, and they were received by Ethelber^ (not yet a Christian) with
honors, and no^ indignities. All they were strangers and forrainers to the
persecuted. Our Persecutour^ be of the same Nation, blood, and kindred and
styled Christians with them, whom thus they persecute for Christ's true
Religion. If King S. Ethelbert, Queen S. Bertha, and Bishop S. Lethard were
now living, Catholics would not be persecuted.

THE II. CHAPTER.
That the Religion of our English Catholics, as well from the Saxons as
Britons, is the same with their first Apostles and deduced from them; and first
of the Saxons converted by S. Augustine, and his Roman Mission.

NOw because our Protestants and Persecutours before have delivered it; For
great glory to our Nation, to derive our spiritual degree from so noble a
Father as S. Peter. We will ^riue and deduce from him, a continual ^d never
interrupted Succession, both of ^iscopall and Priestlie function, and do^ine
also, in every point now questioned by ^r Persecutours, from that so noble a
Father, ^ these Protestant times; And to beg more ^ce and favor from these
our enemies in ^s cause, they themselves shall briefly make ^s deduction.

^. And first concerning Bishops, and Massing Priests sent hither, or

time of Ber^rd, who in the year 1115. lost that honor ^om that See by Papal
order, as all Anti^aries Catholics, and Protestants agree.

4. These men also deliver unto us a Catalogue of learned holy writers in every
ag^ and in the age wh^ S. Augustine came hithe^ they recount unto us, the most
noble Saint and Doctors Dubritius, Iltut^s, Congellu^ David, Gildas,

published) have ^et down under their hands, that there were ^o^ aunciently,
and but Egyptian and Bene^ictine Monckes in this Kingdom of Brita^ie, no great
glory, but rather di^honour to his most noble and ancient Nation in Chri^ian
Religion. A Nation that may justly ^aime prioritie in that kind of honor
before Egypt, or any other Country in the ^orld, except they ca^ prove their

9. This testimony of such a witness, being given a little before S.
Gregory's tim^ who was so learned a Moncke, and Father to many such in Rome,
argues that his Monks and the Monckes of Lyrinum, could no^ be stranger^ ^o
ea^h other. S. Gregory also commanding his Monckes he sent into England to go
to the Archbishop of ^r^e^, Successor to S. Cesarius so near Lyr^num (...)
his assistance; and they bringing from thenc^ into England Assistants and
Interpreter ^n^ S. Augustine being consecrated after Bisho^ of England by
E^he^^us Archbishop of Arles* according to S. Gregory's directions, confirms
the same: the access of such hither, their preaching^ and directions here, and
our first English Moncke: after S. Augustine coming hither, so honoring the
Monckes an^ Monastery of Lyrinum that they tra^elle^ over all England and
France with them; an^ Saint Benedict Biscope who was brought ^^ with our
British Monckes when none other were here being professed in ^yrinum
Mon^sterie, shows how little d^ffe^ence there wa^ between the old Monckes of
Britanie, the Monckes of Lyrinum, and Saint Augustin^ and his fellow Monckes
sent hither b^ ^ly Saint Gregory the Pope.

10. By all accounts it is most certain in ^storie that S. Benedict Biscope
was pro^led in Lyrinum, went to Rome, returned ^o the North part of England,
where he as Abbot diverse years before S. Benedict ^ Rule, was first given, or
received in these ^rtes, and was also Abbot at Canterbury ^bey, and gave place
to S. Adrian, who was ^t hither by the Pope with Saint Theodore ^chbishop
there, before S. Wilfride the first ^er of S. Benedict's Rule in the North, was
^le^ Archbishop of York to give it, or gave ^e foresaid Rule to the Monckes;
as the ^onckes themselves confess. And that he ^ not deliver Saint Benedicts
Rule to the ^onckes in the North, neither was it in his ^wer so to do, until
he was Bishop there, ^ich was not until the year of Christ 670. there about
by all Authors, which was ^ge after S. Benedict Biscops being Abbot ^th in
Northumberland and Canterbury. ^d whereas some Monckes now would have
Aigulphus a Benedictine Moncke, first to ^ie persuaded the Monckes of Lyrinum
to Ma^^h. Westminster. ^^r^n. Flo^ent. Wigorniensis. chron. Sig^bert, and a^^^.
^eiue S. Benedict's Rule, this cannot be, for Aigulphus was a Moncke of
Floriacu^ Mo^sterie, which was not builded many years ^er this time: and so it
is not certain, but ^th the Monckes of Canterbury, and those Northumberland
under this holy Abbot Benedict Biscope hitherto were Lyrinian, and not
Benedictine Monckes: and yet as before, they were of the most Religious an^
learned Monckes, and Apostolic men in the Christian world, as the rest of our
Britis^ Mo^ckes (even by Protestants confession ^ also were.

11. and this is the glory of this our E^glish Nation to have had generally
both i^ Kent, where S. Augustine was, and in all oth^ par^s c^nuerted to
Christ, such renowne^ Fathers and Protogenitours in him: For suc^ were the

Monasterie^ above other Italian Monckes in that tim^ that besides the
Apostolic men about 4^ in number, which S. Gregory sent into E^gland, he made
Maximianus his Abbot the^ Bishop of Siracusas; Marimanus a Monc^ thereof,

men, Missi^ Britanniam Doctis and Sanctis viris Augustino, ^ ^lijs Monachis:
Sending into Britanie learned and holy men Augustine, and other Monckes.

12. But whether S. Augustine, and those who came into England with him to
convert it as they most happily did) were indeed Monckes of S. Benedicts
Order, I will not hear dispute (leaving it perchance to some other work in
hand) it being all one ^o this my purpose whether S. Augustine and his company
were Benedicton or other Monckes: I only intending now to show that from our
first Conversion in S. Peter's time unto these times, there was a continual
succession of Priests and of the same Religon, for which now in England we are
so persecu^ed: And that S. Augustine and his company were most ho^y and
learned men Docti and Breuiar. Romandie 12. Martij in festo S. Gregor. Bed.

^ancti viri, that they taught our Predeces^ours the same faith we now
profess, and that ^hey converted to the faith of Christ Ethel^ert King of
Kent, and his Kingdom of Ke^t, and Sebert or Sigebert King of the East Saxons
with his Kingdom, and preached in many other places o^ England, converting in
them many to Christian Religion. I say with them and the whole Christian world
then, Asia, Afric, and Europe, agreeing with S. Gregory (who sent hither
these so holy and ^earned men, and therefore is rightly by Saint Beade instiled
Apostle of England) in Religion, using his mass, and honoring him for a
Saint, (as our Protestants confess) that their doctrine, and Religion was
true: and for this part of the world, Italy from whence they came, France
through which they came, England or Britanie whether they came, Ireland,
Scotland, and Germany where some of our Britans and English then were,
acknowledging S. Augustines Religion to be true, so prove unto us. So S.
Augustine proved it both by human and divine testimony. So his Opposits and
our persecuting Protestants confess. To use their words. The Britans confessed
indeed that to be the way of Protestant. in Stowes ^^st.
righteousness, which Augustine had preached and sbewed unto them.

13. And he is a simple witted man, if he can understand but the Latin tongue,
that does not most clearly see, and confess the same, if he will but read
the public Church service, Mass and the others, which our Protestants
confess S. Gregory perused, and published, (the Latin and Greek Church
using his Mass translated into Gre^ke, as they do S. Basiles, and S.
Chrysostomes) as also his holy learned works, which he, ^ Doctor of the
Church (and as our Protestants style him) The most holy and learned Pop^ that
ever was, did publish, and are now extant. Thus he and his L^gates s^nt hither
into England, generally taught the same Doctrine, in all points, which we
Catholics now profess (even those for which we are so pitifully persecuted)
Roman Supremacy, Sa^ifice of Ma^^e, Sacrificing Priesthood, such ^piscopall
Roman Ordination, and what^euer elsse now controuersed by Protestants, ^ I
shall demonstra^e against them in every ^ticle of their Religion, when I come
to the ^onuersion o^ the other Parts of England, ^ those which were of our old
British Or^er and Re^ig^on. And yet our English Pro^stants publicly,
generally, and with such ^thoritie protest, and testify, that in the first ^0.
years of Christ, (within which S. Gre^rie and his Legates lived and ^aught)
the church of Rome was pure and free from er^r. And if she had or should have
erred in ^is public doctrinall practices, and orders ^ncerning the whole
Church, the whole church (which these men deny) should also ^ue erred* For
they constantly thus ack^wledge that this most holy and learned ^pe so
published and proposed them. Gre^ius Io. Bal. d^ Roman. Pon^ifice. Art l. 2. in

He made ^e office of the Church, be ordered, the nightlie and daily
Antiphonarie, he digested the Rites of t^ Church, he polished the Ceremonies of
the Mass, a^ the Canon thereof he gathered together.

14. It will be very hard for the quicke^ sighted Persecuting Protestant, to
find a^ one of their Articles of Religion which w^ not condemned, and of
Catholics not p^blickly approved, and practiced in t^ Church of Christ, in and
by those so gen^rally received and professed Ritualls an^ Doctrinalls of
Religion. And therefo^ those pure Protestan^s, which call Cath^likes usually,
in respect of their Doctrine Papists; and their holy Religion Papistri^
Papisme, Romanisme or the like, confes^ plainly, that Saint Augustine from Sai^
Gregory b^ought hither Masses, Altars, Vesments, Chalices, Relickes, Massing
Priests, prayer Saints, for the Dead, and to be brief Rom^nisme, Papistrie,
all which they term no Io. Bal. l. de Scripto Brit. cen tur. c. 2. de Act.

THE III. CHAPTER.
The like proved, of all other persons a^ parts of England, as also the
Br^cans, that their Religion was the same with the Apostles, and the which our
now Persecuted Cath^likes Profess and maintain.

1. NOw let us come to the Conversion of the other parts of England, n^
converted by S. Augustine, or his Missio^ from Rome, but by others, our old
Britis^ or Scottish Bishops and Priests in some part^ before, (by many writers,)
and in the far^ greatest, a^^er. And because amongst other^ the Religious of
our old British Order ha^ influe^ce therein, (...) I lately spoke of Mo^ck^
sent into England by Saint Gregory, and ^ their labors and Religion here, I
will ne^ join these unto them. Their Antiquity ^ have delivered before, from
S. Joseph of A^ramathia, which buried Christ, arriuin^ here, in the year of
his Nativity 63.

2. To take better knowledge of their heavenly life, and conversation on earth,
I wi^ set down their Rule as (with some alteratio^^ ^s is usual in such holy
Orders), it was ap^roued and delivered to our Monckes by S. ^auid Metropolitan
Archbishop in Brita^ie, that most learned Religious holy Pre^te The Rule of our

^^caied, not long before S. Augustines coming hither from S. Gr^gorie then

p^ritie and perfection, together with all o^ three Archbish^ps of Brita^ie,
many Bi^hops, and Priests thereof, in the same fait^ and Religion, which they
received in our fi^ Conversion, some Ceremonies only (of which the observation
of Easter was the greatest question^d with some of them, but no material and
ess^ntiall points at all. And such w^ their holiness even here in Britanie
when into the Pagans were entered, that to exe^plifie in one place of

the Sanctity, learned and Apostolic glory of these our British Bishops,
Culdeys, Priests, and Religious in those times that we may almost say of them,
as the Scripture said of the Apostles In omnem terram exi^it sonus little and
in sines orbis terrae verba eorum: unto all the earth has the sound of them
gone forth: and unto the end of the whole world the word of them. They

world, more then we find delivered of any Apostolic Clergy men, or any
Religious since then.

5. All the world knows their preaching and prevailing in all Britanie,
Ireland, and all Islands; To the Caledonians, Athals, Ho^ests, Orchadians,
Norwegians, Islandians, ^y Papal authority and of Saint Gregory himself. It
is contained in our old Saxon pub^ick laws many hundred years old, that ^hey
preached with like Commission before that time in Island, Greenland (accounted
part of America) Scantia, Norwegia, Sne^horda Gutlandia or Iutland, Dacia,
Seme^andia, Winlandia, Curlandia, Roe, Femela^dia, Wirelandia, Flandria,
Cherrela, Lappa Lapland, and omnes terras and Insulas Orientalis O^eani vsque
Russiam, and multas alias Insulas vl^^a Scantiam vsquedum sub Septentrione: and
all other Islands and Lands to Russia in the East and many other Islands beyond
Scantia in the North. If we turn from the East and North to West, eue^ the
West India, or that America, we find in the old Manuscrip^e Author (that wrote
S. Brendans travails and life) Capgraue and others, that many Apostolic
Priests, consecrated by Saint Patrick that great Apostolik man, went thither,
preached, lived, and died there. If we turn South, to make a circuit we had
in Saint Peter's time our Saint Mansuetus his Disciple, an Apostolik Preacher in
Germany and Bishop of Trull in Loraine. We had in the same age our blessed
Beatus cons^crated at Rome by Saint Peter, or presently after, Preacher and
Apostle of the Heluetians. We had Saint Lucius, or Lucian by some Conuertor and
Apostle of the Bauarians as they acknowledge. We had our S. C^lumbanus, S.
Gallus, S. Kilianus, Totnanus, the both Ewaldi, Furseus, Foillanus, Vltanus,
Offa or Offo, VVitbertus or VVictbertus, S. VVillibrodus and his eleven
Associats Scholars to S. Egbert of our old British Apostolic Order, S.
VVyrus, Saint Plechelmus, Egelbertus, Saint Dysibodius with many in his
company of his Associats. All these were of our old Apostolical Priests, and
Religious Order here before any other Order came into Britanie: who as
Apostolic men with Papal authority, preached in Gallia, Almania, Italia,
Franconia, Bauaria, Thuringia, Ha^sia, Frisia, Dania, and other Countries,
diverse of them by Papal power were consecrated Bishops, others Abbots, and in
other degrees, they founded Monaste^ies ad Religious houses in great number,
which ^ould not be of any other Order the^ in which their founders and Rules
were trained up, and professed in to wit, that our most aun^ient, holy and
learned British Order.

6. This our Protestant Persecutours them^lues acknowledge; who speakin^ of
Ban^or, a Monastery of our British order here and of S. Columban and Brendan,
two Dis^iples of Co^gellus Abbot thereof they testify ^at: S ^ernardus hunc

this ^ace to have been the head and chiefist of Monasteries, ^d to have
begotten many thousands of Monckes, man were his Disciples, of whom Columbanus
filled ^ance, Germany and Italy; Brendan Ireland and ^otland with habitations

Legate Arc^bishop of Moguntia ^int Boniface, and his holy company, and ^artyrs
with him, who being a child but of ^ue years old was brought up by our
Apo^olik Priests, ad after entered into the Monasteries of Exancester with
vul^hardus a Moncke of our old British Order, and after into the Monastery of
Huntscelle under Winbert Abbot of the same profession, where he lived a long
tim^: and afterward going into Germany being and Abbot there, he spen^ diverse
years in preaching, before he wen^ to Rome, in the time of Pope Gregory the

23. ^hyres, in 20. and tribus Prouin^ijs, quas Angli Shiras (...), ^^s
converted by the old renowned Clergy men, Bishops, Priests an^ Monckes that
were of our old British Orde^ they in their Ancestors receiving Conversion
from such our Britans, and the^selue^ also living within the limits and bounds
o^ Britanie or England now: for their Island a^ Saint Bede and others witness
belonged to our Country: Insula Hydesti, cuius Monasteri^ ^ed. Eccl. hist. l.

Monastery (in the Ile^ Hydestine) was n^ small ^im^ the chief house of al^
the Monasteries Almost of all the Northeren Sco^ and of the Abbeys of all the
Red^hankes, and had the soueraintie in ruling of then people. Which I Will i^
very deed, belongs to the right of Britanie, being seu^red from it with a
narr^w sea. Sebert King o^ the East Angles was converted in Burgundie^ and
brought over with him (who was consecrated after Bishop of his Country) Saint
Felix, and he so honored the Priests of ou^ old British Order, that Saint
Furseus on^ thereof, coming hither, and with his allowance and donation
building a Monasteri^ of that Order, King Sebert himself entered into
Monastical life, and was professed ^ Mon^ke therein, Regni negotijs cognato
suo Egri^ commendatis in Monasterio a sancto Furseo sibi constructo habitum
Monachalem suscepit: Committing the affairs of his Kingdom to his Kinsman
^gre^k, he betoocke himself to Monastical habit in a Monastery ^ounded by S.
Furseus.

11. Concerning the Kingedome of the East Saxons, ^igebert their King joined
herein with the Northumbers and ^as baptized by Bishop Finan of the Scottish
Order ad Bishop of his Country. C^d that was of the same order and consecrated
by S. Finan, he in all his dominions consecrated Priests, and Deacons in all
places of Essex, but especially at ^thancester and Tilberie: For although King
Seber's son of Sledda was a Christian before, ^et he dying, the Country
under his sons ^erred and Sigbert (deadly enemies to Chri^tian profession)
was till then in Infideli^ie.

12. To come to the west Saxons, although ^hey received the faith by Saint
Birinus sent from Rome, yet at the Baptism of their King Kinegillus, S. Oswald
King of Northu^^erland was Godfather unto him, and he ^arried King Oswald his
daughter, and Do^auerunt ambo Reges, both these Kings gave him ^orchester, six
miles from Oxford, to settle ^here his Episcopal See. And in the year ^35. He
instituted there, Canonic^s se^ulares: secu^r Canons. We read in the
Manuscript of the ^ntiquities of winchester that he builded ^gaine the old
Monastery of winchester, ^ounded in king Lucius time, and did restore unto, or
in it, again holy Monckes, which were not long (if at all) before Saint
Augustines coming, driven thence: for we are assured that in the time of
Constantine, kinsma^ to king Arthur killing the son of Mordred Gildus l. de

before the Altar of that Monastery, they were there and without doubt in king
Careticus his time in the year ^^6. when and not before Bishops, Priests and
Moncks fled into wales. So the Moncks placed there could be no others, but such
as had been Bed. h^sto. Eccles. lib. 4. cap. 13 Manuscr^p^. antiq. ^^ vit. S.

driven from thence before, who still in themselves or succession of that order
continued in those parts, as in the Scottish and British Order in the
Monasteries of Bosenham where Dicul a Scot was Abbot; in Redford, under Abbot
Kinebertus; at Malmesburie, under Meildulphus a Scottish Moncke, Natione Scoto,
eruditione phylosopho, professione Monacho: By nation a Scot, in lerning a

place, where and under whom, in the same disc^pline S. Aldelme after Abbot
there was brought up, A primo aeuo infantiae: from his child^ood. Bishop
Eleutherius in his grant to that house dated 675. proves there were many
Abbots and Abbeys in these places in that time.

13. William of Malmesburie with the Antiquities of Glast^^burie assures us,
that in our ^enowned Abbey of Glastenburie after Saint Augustines coming, and
during his ^eing here in the year 601. we had our old Moncks in quiet, and
peace, their Abbot was ^alled Morgret, the Bishop under whom they ^hen lived,
Manuto, Manuto Episcopus, and their King, Rex Domnoniae, whose name by the
old^esse of the Record is not remembered: Quis is^e Rex fuit scedulae ve^ustas
negat scire, he was their Be^efactour and gave them, or confirmed to them
Inswitrin, Terram quae appellatur Inswitrin ^d Ecclesiam ve^ustam concessit, ad
petitionem Mor^ret ^iusdem loci Abbatis: The land which is called ^nswitrin he
granted to the old Church by the p^ti^io^ of Morgret Abbot of that place, and
their Bishop Manuto wrote and confirmed it. Ego Manuto Epis^opus hanc chartam
scripsi: I Bishop Manute wrote t^i^ ^aper.

14. Besides this Bishop, England had then ^t Saint Augustines coming diverse
Bishops ^ere, ordered or sent by the Popes authori^ie, Saint Asaph in the west,
S. Iuo in Hun^ingtonsyhre, S. Lethard in Kent: and others not improbably in
other places, besides ou^ British Bishops in Wales, and those of Scot^and. And
to remember but the names of our first Bishops in England after S. Augustines
coming besides Kent and London, where ^he and his Associats were Bishops, all
which undoubtedly by all writers Catholic and Protestant, old or new,
Monastical or others, either were of our British old Order, or joined with
them, that were at that time here.

15. We have in the North Saint Aidan^ Finan, Colman, Tuda, Eata, Cuthbert.
For York S. Paulinus the first, by Marianus wa^ ex Francia, and stayed but
only 6. years: after him S. Cedda, S. Wilfride, Bosa, Saint John called of
Beuerlaie brought up in Saint Hilda her old Monastery. At winchester w^ had S.
Birinus spoake^ of before who restored in that Monastery our old Mo^ckes and
ioy^ned with the Northumbers: Agilbertus ^ Frenchman who preached long in
Ireland joined ^lso with the Northumbers: VVin^ also a Frenchman, and
Eleutherius remembered before. In Li^hfeild we had Diuma, o^ Dwyna a Scot having
all Middle England for his Dioces, so had six or seven of his Successors, all
such until the year 678. Cellac^ ^ Scot, Trumhere, Ianuman, Cedda, winfride,
Saxulf. I pass over all the old Sees i^ wales known and confessed by all to
have had none but such Bishops.

16. Such also was the ordinary and universal piety and sanctity of our old
holy Priest^ and Preachers of that time, before any later Order was received,
even of the lay people converted and taught by them, as the learned Saint Bede
then living much be waileth the great change, and alteration saying: In tantum
Beda l. 3. Hist. ^ccles. Angl. cap. 5.
au^^m vita ill^us (Aidani) a nostri temporis segnitia dist^bat, vt omnes qui
cum eo incedebant, sieve aettonsi ^^ue laici meditari debe^ent, id est, aut
legendi^ Scripturis, aut Psalmis discendis: S. Aidan his lif^ ^as so far
different from the slothfulness of our ^e, that all those which went with
him, wheather ^onckes, or Laickes were to meditate, that is, they ^ere to
bestow their time either in reading Scripture, ^ learning the Psalms. And in
an other place ^ ^aieth thus of Bishop Colman (who dispu^d with Saint Wilfrid)
and of his Prede^ssours: Bed. hist^. ecclesiast. l. 3. ca. 26.
Quantae autem parsimoniae ^uiusque conti^tiae fueri^ ipse cum praedecessoribus
suis, testabatur ^am ipse locu;, quem regeba^: Of how great abstinen^ and
continency he was with his Predecessors the ^ce it self which he ruled, did
witness, where, ^en they went away, very few howses besides the ^urch
remained, and these howses only without ^ch civil conversation could not
continue. They had ^onie, nothing but cattle. If they received any mo^ of the
rich, presently they gave it to the poor. All care of those Doctors then was
to serve God and not world. All their desire was for the soul, and no^
^bellie: whereupon in that time the habit of Reli^ was in great reverence, so
that wheresoever ^ ^st or Moncke did come, he was, joyfully received ^ll, as
the Servant of God. And if any travailing ^eir iornie did meet him (a Priest)
bending ^selues they rejoiced to be signed with his hand, ^ssed by his mouth.
They gave diligent ear to his ^rtatio^s. Upon the sondayes they floc^ed to the
Church ^onasteries to be instructed in the word of God. If Priest chanced to
come into a villadge the Inha^ts presently came together, and desired to
receive lord of life from him. For there was no other cause ^riests or
Ecclesiastical men to go to villadges, but to speak briefly, to ^uer
souls. And they were so (...) from all infection of covetousness, that they
would n^ (except compelled by the rich men of the world) ^^ceiue lands or
possessions to build Monaste^ies. Whi^ custom was gen^rally observed in the
Churc^es of t^ ^ingdome of Northumberland, sometime af^erward^ Thus of Saint
Aidan their first Ap^st^e, an^ of his Dis^iples and people by him conue^ced,
and although he kept Easter otherwi^ then those did which came from Rome, y^ he
was, and worthily beloved of all, even ^ the Archbishop of Canterbury Honori^
for his works of faith, piety, and chariti^ and during his life that
difference was patie^tly endured. And this was not an error c^mon to all
Scots, but to some of the^, for Ro^ and others impugned it. And when it was
ro^ted out, it was not done by Mo^ckes or other Bed. l. 3. 4. 5. Guliel.

from Rome, but as Saint ^ede and other prove either by the Po^es admonition,
as ^ Ireland, by Bishop Agilbertus, and Sai^ Wilfride in Northumberland, and in
oth^ place, by Saint Egbertus, Adamnanus a^ others of their old own Order and
prof^sion.

17. In this I have the longer insisted, ^^ only for the glory and honor of
those o^ Fathers in Christ, (not justly to be tak^ from them, to be given unto
others, and t^ it is the honor of our English Priests a^ Catholics to be

received, allowed, and approved opinion, and confession of our English
Protestants, and those their best learned in their estimation (to write in
their own very words.) At the coming of Augustine there flourished with ^he
Britans the preaching of the truth, sincere do^trine, lively faith, and the
pure worship ^f God, ^uch as from the Apostles themselves was by Gods
co^^aundement delivered to the Churches. The Britans before Augustines coming
continued in the ^aith of christ even from the Apostles time. After the Britans
^mbraced the says of Christ they never forsook i^, nei^er when Augustine came
into the Island. So many and so great a number of the old names of Priests
^oncks, Abbots, Prelates, Bishops, Churches, Ab^eyes and Sees, which have been
in every age, does ^fficie^tly prove, that the gospel which was preached ^
Britanie in the first times of the Apostles, was not ^ely allwaies firmly
retained, but in every age aug^ented, and dilated, did increased. Many of the
Chri^an Britans fearing the cruelty of Dioclesian, fleed ^ the Scots, among
whom very many renowned for ^arning and Integrity of life remained still in
Sot^d, and lived a solitary life in so great opinion of ^ctitie with all men,
that after their deaths their ^lls were changed into C^urches. And thereupon
it ^ained a custom to posterity, that the old Scots cal^ Churches, Cells. This
kind of Moncks men called ^ldeys worshippers of God. The later Kind of ^onckes
was in learning and holiness so far ^eriour unto them, how much in riches,

When Augustine was sent by Gregory, the Britan^ were instructed by Moncks
which that age had, learned and Godly. Many scottish Moncks for love ^
Godliness trauatled into France and Germany an^ preached the Christian
doctrine about Rhene, an^ builded Monasteries in many places. For there were y^
among the Scots many Moncks of the old disciplin^ And the Germans gave that

them. Apud Scotos enim adhuc mults erant Monac^ vetere D^sciplin^ nondum

the Mo^ck^ written by S. Brendan remained until h^ time: Brendanus scripsit ex

mouth of an Angel that holy Rule, which to the day continues. And no doubt
but that his holy Order, and that of our Carmelites, as als^ our Carthusians
most renowned here, ha^ descent from thence.

18. Their Religion was by the Protestant the true Apostolic Religion, and yet
the^ agreed in all essential things with those the came from Rome, with Saint
Augustine wh^ brought hither the same Religion (as before is related) which our
Catholics now pro^esse, and our Ance^^ours Saxons received ^om them. And the
chiefest among them in ^ll part whatsoever, agreed with the Church ^f Rome, and
had their Apostolic power and allowance thence: So S. Kentegern that S. As^p^.

Rome, and had Appro^tion and power thence. So S. Molochus ^ost renowned,

that came with him. Therefore ^ cannot be questioned, but our Saxon An^stours
then receiu^d the ame faith and Re^gion we Catholic, now profess, and so
^ffer for profession thereof, which will be in every particular most manifest,
in that which now shall follow, concerning Articles i^ Protestant Religion,
and every of them the is against Catholic Religion.

THE IIII. CHAPTER.
The Religion of the Apostles, of our pr^matiue Christian Britans, of the fir^
Christian Saxons, and of our now pe^secuted Catholics, proved to be o^ and the
same in every Article, again Protestants and Persecutours.

1. It is proved before, and confessed ^ all, both Catholi^ks and Protestant^
that the difference between Saint Augusti^ and our Britans, was of things
Ceremoni^ and whereas our Protestants find much fa^ Girald. C^mbren. descript.

at our Ceremonies, which it pleases them ^ te^me Popish, Giraldus Cambrensis
the le^ned British Bishop and writer, sets the down, which the Britans kept
otherw^ then the Romans, which are more Popish a^ Papisticall by Protestants
Judgment, t^ the Romans were. It is strange among ^ best Authors how the
Britans should diffe^ ^l observation of Easter, or any thing else ^om Rome (but
by the Injury of the trou^^s here by wars hindering intercourse thi^er and
from thece) for from the beginning, as ^e^ore, and in every age we had our
chief ^ling Bishops, and Priests from thence: in ^e first, from S. Peter: in
the second age, ^om Saint Eleutherius; in the third, from Pope ^ctor; in the
fourth, by Saint Ninian, and ^hers coming, and sent from thence; in the ^t,
from S. Celestine by S. Palladius, Saint ^ermanus, Lupus, Patrick, Seuerus, and
^hers, in the sixth, by S. Kentegerne, S. A^h, S. Iuo, S. Lethard, and others
before, Augustine. And to make a brief mention every Article in particular,
now contro^sed with these Protestants, as they are con^ned in their book of
Articles: These our ^tient Britans and Scots retaining their ^ Apostolic
doctrine (as these man said) ^eed in every Article with the present Ca^liks,
and in them all dissented from Pro^ants.

^. They had the Scripturs from the Ro^ Eleuthe^. Pap. epist. ad Lucium Reg.

Church, those which Catholics hold ^ for Scripturs, so Eleutherius himself,
^ildas and others prove. That they did ^ hold all needful things to be
contained ^criptures, but some by Traditions, their ^ifold Traditions in many
matters of most by Protestant confession, is a manifest ^ument, and will
appear in many Articles following. And this is evident in the^ Gild. supr.

confessed Sac^ifice of Mass, and sacrifici^ Priesthood, being to offer
Sacrifice for the living and dead, as Protestants confess; an^ that in all
Masses, there is the doctrine a^ practice of Transsubstantiation, and Re^
presence, the doctrine and practice of Pu^gatorie and prayer for the dead, of
prayi^ unto Saints, and their protection of diue^ orders ecclesiastical which
Protestants ha^ not; the doctrine of merits and good dee^ denial of
Justification by faith only* a^ almost all doctrines which Catholics ho^ and
Protestants deny to be contained in Scr^tures, or to be professed; which
Catholi^ doctrines against these Protestants in the Articles of Religion, they
themselves acnowledge (...) ^al l. 2 (...). Roman. (...).
to be contained in the old Masse^ the Britans, the Papisticall Mass, Missae
P^s^ica, as some of them term it before S. ^lestins time.

3. And to speak in order of every pa^cu^ar, in their Articles that is now
questned, Antiquit. ^last. Gulielm. M^l^^. l. de antiq. coe^^b. Glast. Io.
Capgr^u. Catalog. in ^. Iosep^. Arimath.
omitting the rest. Their Article intitul^ of the Justification of man,
asscribing Iustificat^^ to faith only, is utterly condemned by ^ Penitential
an Order, as I have recited fr^ the Britans, their so many Monasteries in ^
ages, by the lives of our first Religious, S^ Joseph of Arimathaea and his
fellows liu^ Eremits all their life, in watchings, fastin^ and prayers, so
performing their devout ^ ^es to God and the blessed virgin, In vigilijs,

other places: So kings and Princes, Bishops ^d greatest learned men, all which
(by our ^^o^estan^s) truly believed, and had true ^ith* though they undertook
such penal ad ^tisfactorie course^ of life. And there great ^arned Doctor,
Priest, Historian and Reli^ous man in that Penitential O^d^r Saint Gild.
Prolog. in lib. ^^ exci^. and c^nqu^^t. (...).
^ildas wrote: Sciebam misericordiam Domini, sed ^ iudicium timebam Laudaham
gratiam* sed reddi^nem vnicuique secundum opera sua verebar: I did ^owe the
m^rcie of our Lord, but yet I did ^eare his ^dgment, I praised his grace, but I
did dread his re^ard ac^ording to every ones worckes* which con^mneth our
Protestants pretended assuring ^sti^ying faith.

4. Their Article styled Of works of supere^gation, teaching, such work^s
cannot be tau^ht ^thout arrogancy, is confuted by those Britans ^ that is
said, as an arrogant saying, ^or if ^e Britans, or any other peop^^ had been
^ounde to such works of Perfection, such ^haritie, Chastity, Obedience,
voluntary ^ouertie, to so many Religious Foundations ^ they performed and the
like; they that ^e not so must needs be damned, because ^ grossly they break
God* Commaunde^ent, among which Protestants recount ^ese, and whatsoever man is
able to do in this life, in this their Article.

5. The Britans did not hold with these Protestants in their Article entitled
of the Church, That the Church of Rome had erred in ma^ters of faith, otherwise
they would not as before have so diligently and dutifully followed, and obeyed
it in all ages: and if the Church of Rome had then erred, the Britan^ still
following the doctrine thereof, ^ad als^ erred ^n such things, which our
Protestan^ have before generally denied: And the ^^preme head of the
Protestants Church ^ England, King James in open Parlame^ K. James speech in
^is 1. Parlam.
pronounced of the Church of Rome: It w^ a Rule to all, both in doctrine and
Ceremonies* wh^ it was in her flourishing and best estate, w^^ch (...) he
acknowledges to have been (...) in that time. And being it is proved to be
su^ in such estate, still it must be a Rule, as the it was.

6. Concerning their Article, Of the Auth^ritie Protestant. in their Theater of

of general Counsels, our Britans who tr^uailed so far unto such Counsels,
subscr^bed unto them in many Articles contrary ^ these of Protestants, and ever
had them ^ great reverence, (as our Protestants confess) and attributed more
to them, then the^ men do.

7. Their Article styled, Of Purgatory, fights against the Catholic
doctrine of Pu^gatorie, Pardons, Indulgences, Relics ^mages, and Invocation of
Saints. In a^ ^ich by our Britans they are condemned; ^d first in Purgatory,
and praying for the dead. Antiquit. Gl^ston. Manuscr. tabul^^ fix. Guli^^^^.

^ this daily was to be done. Oratione quo^i^a and ecclesiastico seruitio pro

^orne before him. King Arthur used the Image of the blessed Virgin, with great
reue^ence. Our Britans went long Pilgrimages ^ea even to Jerusalem there to
reverence ^he holy Relics, and the cloth supposed to ^e made by ^he blessed
Virgin containing ^he Images of Christ and his 12. Apostles, Saint ^^de and
others more ancient so relating. This was here so pub^ike, that it was thus by
^awe decreed: Aras ^empla, Diuorum statuas, O^atoria, Sac^lla, Sa^^^dotes,
omnesque sacrae familiae ^iros ex animo venerantor: Let all the Altars,
^hurche^, statues of Saints, Oratories, Chapells Priests, and all men
apperta^ning to the Church be reverenced ^om the heart.

10. Concerning holy Relics, the learned ^ritish Bishop says of his
Country, old Chri^ian Britans, that they gave more reverence unto such, then
any other Nation. Sanctorum ^eliquijs long ^agis quam vl^^m gentem honore^
de^rre videmu^^^ Ios^ph of ^rimathae a brought ^oly Relics with him h^^^er,

wit^ the Apostles at the ^eath of the blessed V^^gin worshipping her ^cred
body as Saint John Damascen witnes^th by so great warrant, used and left such*
^euerence here. The holy Relics of S. Peter, ^ Saint Bonifacius writes were
occasion or motive of the Scots Conversion. All our Histories are full, how in
all Persecutions by Pagans, one of the greatest cares of our Christian Britans
was, to preserve their holy Relics. Churches were founded and dedicated to our
Martyrs in all places, and their Relics were there preserved with great
veneration. Our greatest Apostolic men, as Saint Germanus, and his holy
company went on Pilgrimage unto them. No noble person in the world showed more
reverence unto such, then our most noble country wom^ Empress and Queen S.
Helena, by all Antiquities. Veremund. Hect. Boet. Scot. hist.
The reverence which was given to the Relics of Saint Andrew the Apostle in
the year 360. (which were brought from Patras in Achaia) by King Hei^gustus,
his Nobles, and others, with geneflexions or more, and greatest reuerences, do
not give place to any now used by Catholics. It was a thing usual in those
days for our Christian Britans to go on Pilgrimage to Rome, and Jerusalem,
to render such reuere^^^ there. Saint David, S. Paternus, S. Telia^us, and
others our most renowned ad learned did so. All places in Britanie where such
Relics were preserved, as Glastenburie. (...), London, Caerlegio^, winchester,
and others were thus frequented and visited.

11. For Invocation of Saints it was the Religion of our Britans, from their
first faith in Christ, Saint Joseph and his company praie^ unto the blessed
Virgin, and by her were comforted, Antiqui^^ glaston. tabulis fix. Gultel.

with her help in all their needs, Virgi^is Dei genetricis auxilio in

Chapel by Glastenburie in honor of Saint Michael the Archa^gell to be
honored ^here: Oratorium aedificauerunt in honor S. Mihaclis Archangeli,
quatenus ibi ab hominibus habe^^ honorem, qui homines in perpetues honores

and honorable in this kind ^ith ancient approved writers. S. German ^ur
Apostle prayed to our Saints here, and as^ribed great effects unto it. So King
Arthur, ^o speak in Protestants words) He commit^d himself and his whole
army to the Tuition of ^rist, and his Mother the Virgin. In the public ^asse
they used, there was public memory, ^d Invocation of all Saints. And in
their pu^icke Oaths, as S. Gildas witnesses, they solemnly called the blessed
Virgin, and all Saints to witness. So the kings themselves at their Inthroning.

12. Their Article entitled, Of ministering in the Congregation, and whatsoever
concerning Bishops, Priests, and Clergy men shall be handled hereafter in the
particular defense and honor belonging to Bishops and Priests where our
Ancient Britans shall with others be made Judges and Condemners of
Protestants, and witnesses for Catholics in this question; in the mean time I
have said sufficiently before.

13. Their Article superscribed, Of speaking in the Congregation in such a
tongue, as the people understand not: Which was made against the public
Sacrifice and Service of the Church, i^ the latin tongue is plainly condemned
by our Christian Britans their Apostle, Bishop^ and Priests from the beginning
of their Conuerssion. For neither ^aint Joseph, nor an^ of his company, nor
Saint Damianus Phaganus, Germanus, Lupus, Seuerus, PalIadius, our Apostles, or
any such other no^ Britans, did understand the British languag^ to use it
themselves, or translate the public^ service into it, for the use of others.

me^ used public Church service, which mu^ needs be that of the latin Church,
the lati^ service thereof: Our Protestants themselu^ acknowledge, they were
vttery ignorant of t^ British language, and that they preached by Interpreters.
And as it was proved and justified by the renowned Abbot D. Fecknam publicly
in the first Parliament of Queen Elizabeth. The ancient Historiographer D.
Gildas witnesses in the Prologue and beg^nning of his book of the Britan
histories, that Damianus, and Fugatius (Phaganus) sent hither from Pope
Elutherius, brought hither the service, Church books of their Religion in the
latin tongue. And though the Protestants have suppressed this history, or
Prologue thereof, yet they grant unto us, that Gildas cites diverse passages
of the public Church Office in latin: So do our Protestants themselves (as
Fox and others) proving Fox Act. and Mon. page 1142. Sermo seu homil.

they were in latin, before S. Germanus his coming hither. And when S. Lupus
and Saint German who both had been Mo^ckes ^n the learned Monastery in the
Ireland Ly^ine by Marcells in France (as an old Bri^ish antiquity with others
witnesses,) ^rought hither, used and left here the Church ^etuice: Used by
Saint Mark the Evangelist, after ^y S. Gregory Nazianzen, S. Basile, S.
Anthony, ^aulus, Macharius, Malchus Cassianus in the Mona^erie Lyrinum, and
after him, S. Honoratus Abba^ ^here, S. Cesa^ius, S. Por^ari^s Abhot there, by
S. ^upus and Germanus, both in that Monastery and after they were made
Bi^hops, and in Britanie where ^hey preached, and after them S. Wandilo^us and
S. ^omogillus who had in their Monastery about 3000. ^on^kes. After Wandilocus
sent to preach by Saint Gomogillus and Saint Columban into the parts of Gallia
and the Monastery Luxouium used there the same Ecclesiastical Office, ad the
fame of their ^olinesse was spread in the whole world, and of their Order many
Monasteries both of men and women were founded. Where is evident not only that
the latin Church service was used by our Britans and Scots, but our Religious,
and those of that most learned and noble Monastery of Lyrinum, and others both
in France and Italy joined together in these days. This British Author lived
and wrote before the Vnio^ of the Christian Saxons and Britanie here. Neither
our learned Cou^triman Alcuinus or Albinus Tutor to Charles the great Emperor,
most co^uersant in such Antiquities, nor Amalarius, nor any other Expositour of
old Ecclesiastical service and Ceremonies do find any other but latin
either in Britanie or any place of the latin Church, taking that denomination

that the Britans all essential things had the same ordinati^ ^ith the Church

people, and more ^rict Laws and punishments for incontine^cie ^ere here

British Clergy, was ^communicated, and by the whole kinge^me after deposed, as

acknowledge wherein concerning this Sacrament, S. Iam^ the Apostle is expounded

Whereby we are assured the the old true believing Britans received a the seven
Sacraments as Catholics now do^ And yet if after so great loss and hauoc^ made

Britans re^ied, and that of Arles to which their ^hbishop of London Restitutus
for Brita^ subscribed. And our Protestants by pu^k statute and Parliament, have
declared, ^ in the Primative Church, Communion ^ used sometimes in both kinds,
and ^etimes in one only. Therefore there was express command of Christ, even

Cat^likes, or to small purpose. Therefore the ^ of Catholieks in England

be the Teach^ and Preachers of such sacred rights, ^ keepers of others to
perform them, suc^ our renowned Bishop and Priests be, sho^ not be persecuted
but honored, and reue^ced of all. But because the malice of Perse^ tours has
procceeded so far against the which have so well deserved, and ought be
better respected, I must take leave of the Enemies to give our holy Bishop and
Priests, ^me part of their due and honor belon^g to their sacred Orders,
Functions, and ^r^ons.

THE V. CHAPTER.
^at the Consecration, Jurisdiction, and mis^ion of our Catholic Bishop
(teaching the same Apostolical Doctrine in all things with the Catholic
Church) is most lawful, holy, orderly, and honorable, in that his sacred
call^ng is most worthy, and necessary, and therefore he vnw^rthi^ly Persecuted.

SO honorable and emine^t is the name and Office of sacred Bishops, that no^
^ly the holy Apostles in holy Scripturs, Apostolic Fathers are so named, but
^ist himself by the greatest Apostle is sti^ Bishop of our souls: Episcopus
animarum 1. Pet. ^.
^aru^. And that sacred Order is so necessary ^e Church (every one in
particular to rule govern it, to confer holy Priesthood, and other Orders, to
minister Sacrament Preach, Preserve, and continue it, and d^ other their most
needful offices therein) the if we will believe the holy Scripturs, the
^postolick Fathers of the Apostles age, ^ continual Tradition and doctrinall
pract^ of the true Catholic Church from the^ even by Protestants confessions,
and the te^monies of themselves against themselves (t^ now persecute an holy
and learned Bishop ^ being a Bishop and receiving Episco^ Order and power
whence all our Bish^ hitherto have, and must derive it) it is w^ out question,
that as no other degree or ^nitie whatsoever is so eminent in spirit affairs;
So none in such matters and nec^ties is so behofull and needful: None so m^ to
be honored, reuere^ced and desired, ^ in the greatest Persecutions.

2. In holy Scripturs the flock of C^ and government of his Church is commi^
unto the^ when it is said, unto them: Att^ Act. 20.
vobis and vniuerso gregi in quo vos spiritus sanct^ suit Episcopos regere
Ecclesiam Dei, quam acq^ sanguine suo. Take heed to your selves, and to the ^
flock, wherein the holy ghost has placed you Bi^ to rule the Church of God,
which he has pur^ with his own blood. Where it is said: Fi^e^mo, 1. Tim. 3.
si quis Episcopatum desiderat, bonum opus d^rat Asatthfull saying. If a man
desire a Bishops ^ he desi^eth a good work. Si quis domnisuae prae^^^ci^,
quomode ecclesiae Dei diligentiam habebit? If ^ ^w not to rule his own house:
how shall he have ^e of the Church of God? where it is said: Oportet ^iscopum
sine crimine esse, sicut Dei dispensatorem. Tit. 1.
Biohop must be without crime, as the steward of God. ^here S. Peter says to
such: Pascite qui in vobis ^ g^egem Domini. Feed the flock of God which is
^ong you. Neque vt dominantes in Cleris, s^d formae 1. Pet. 5.
^i greg^. Nei^^er as ouerruling the Clergy, but exa^^ of the flock Where S.
Paul says to S. Titus ^hop: Huius reig^atia reliqui to Cretae, vt ea quae
Tit. 1.
(...) corr^gas, and constituas per ^iuitates presbyteros, ^ and ^go disposui
tibi: For this cause lest I thee in ^e, that thou should reform the things
that are ^ting, and should ordain Priests by cities, as so appointed thee.
Here they be Rulers, Go^nour^, Fathers and so they must needs be ^oured,
reverenced and obeyed of the^r ^iects and chi^d^en: And as the Scripture ^h
expressly command temporal obe^ce, unto temporal Rulers: A^mone illos Tit. 3.
^cipibus and Potestatibu^ subditos esse, dicto obedire: ^onish them to he
subject to Princes and Potestats, ^y at a word, So it does most expressly and
^tly command obedience and subjection ^ese our spiritual Rulers: Obedite Prae
o^^^estris, Heb. 13.
and subiac^te eis, ipsi e^im peruigilant, quasi ^^m pro animabus vestris
reddi^u^^, Obey your ^^s, and be subject to them. For they watch, as ^ to
render account for your souls.

Ignatius Successor to S. Peter at An^h, says: Quid aliud est E^iscopus, qu^m
is qui Principatu and Potestate superior est? Episcopi sun^ Sacerdotes
baptizant, sacrificant, eligunt, inanus imponunt. Nemo Episcopo honorabilior in
Ecclesia, Sacerdotium Deo gerenti pro mundi salute. Pre byteri and Diaconi

D^minum. Sine Episcopo n^mo quicquam faciat eorun quae ad Ec^lesi^m spectant.

praestantior, aut quisquam similis illi in rebus omnil^ creatis: neque

Ecclesia. W^ else is a Bishop, but he that is Superior to all prin^palitie and
power Bishops are Priests, they Baptiz^ they off^r sacrifice, they chose
others, they imp^ hands. None is more honorable then the Bishop the Church
excricising Priesthood before Allmight God for the Salvation of the world.
Priests, Deac^ and all the Clergy together with the people, Souldi^ and
Princes, yea and Kings should obey the Bish^ and not contradict him in any
thing. Be yea sub^ unto the Bishop, as unto our Lord, for he does w^ ^uer your
souls, as who is to render an account to God. Therefore it is necessary, that
whatsoever you do, that you attempt nothing without the Bishop. Whom so ever
the good man of the house does send to govern his family, you ought so to
receive him, as if it were himself who sends him You ought to receive the
bishop, as our Lord himself. Without the Bishop let no man do any thing
which appertainet^ to the Church. Honor God as the Author and Lord of all but
the Bishop as the Prince of the Priests, bearing the ^ma^ge of God: of God
indeed, for his principality; and of Christ for his Priesthood you ought also
to honor the King* for neither any is chiefer then the King, ^r any lick unto
him in all created things: nor is there any in the Church of God greater then
the Bi^hop, who is conjecrated to God for the health of the whole world.

4. S. Clement Successor to S. Peter at Rome, says from S. Peter's mouth:
Omnes Principes terrae and ^unctos homines Episcopis obedire* and capita sua
ubmittere, eorumque adiutores existere prae^i^iebat Pe^rus Apostolus. Omne^ qui
eis contra^eniant, ita damnatos and in^am^s, vsque ad satisfactionem
monstrabat: and nisi conuerterentur, a liminibus Ecclesiae alienes esse
praecipiebat. O Episcope, (says he) stude mundicie operum excellere,
cognosc^n^ locum ac dignitatem tuam, tanquam locum Dei obtinens, eo quod praees
omnibus Dominis, Saccrdotibus, Regibus, Principibus, Patri^us, Filijs,
Magistris atque Subditis simul omnibu^, Iudica o Episcope cum potestate*
tanquam Deus. Episcopus est media^or inter Deum and vos. Is pietatis magister
est, is post Deum Pater vester* ^s princeps and dux vester, is Rex vester, and
Dynasta, denique is terrenus Deus post Deum, cui a vobis honor debetur.
Episcopus Dei dignitate ornatus est, qua^enus Clero pr^e^^, and omni populo
imperat: Peter the Apostle commanded all Princes of the earth, and all men to
obey the Bishops, and to submit their heads unto them, and to be their
helpers. All those which should speak against them he did declare them so to
be infamous an damned, vn^ill they had made satisfaction. And unless they
would be converted, he commanded that they should not p^rticipate of the
Church. O Bishop (says he) study to excel in the purity of thy works,
considering thy place and dignity, as possessing God his place, in that thou
go before all Lords, Priests, Kings, Princes, Fathers* Soones, Masters, and
also all subjects. O Bishop iu^ge wi^h all power, as God. The Bishop is
mediator between God, and you. He is the master of piety, he after God is
your Father, he is your Prince and Captain, he is your King, and Ruler* and
lastly after God he is your terrene God, w^om you oug^t to honor and
reverence. The Bishop is adorned with the dignity of God, as he is chief of
the Clergy, and rules all people

5. The like have S. Dionysius the Areopagite, S. Anacletus and others, our
English Protestant^ so confessing So they teach with holy Scriptures, there is
no other inferior Order of Priesthood, Deacons, or others, to preach or
minister any Sacrament, or do any spiritual thing in the Church, but by
consecration from Bishops. Neque laico permi^u^ous facere opus aliquod
Sacerdotale vt sacrificium, aut Baptismum, aut impositionem man us, aut
benedictionem sieve paruam sieve magnam. Nemo enim sibi sumit honorem, sed qui
vocatur a Domine: huiusmodi namque gratia per impositionem manuum Episcopi
datur. Neque Presbyteris potestatem damus ordinandi Diaconos, aut Lectores, aut
Ministros, sed Episcopis tantum. Hic enim est Ecclesiasticus ordo. Cum a Deo
consequen^iam rerum didicerimus, Episcopis quidem assignauimus, and
a^tribuimus, quae ad principatum Sacerdotij pertin^nt: Presbyteris vero quae ad
Sacerdotium: Deinde Diaconis, quae ad ministrandum vtriusque, vt pu^e and cast
fiant, quae ad Religionem pertinent. Neque enim sas est Diacono sacrificium
offerre, aut baptizare, aut benedictionem, five paruam sieve magnam facere neque
Presbytero ordinationem Clericoru^facere. Ostensum est An^istitum Ordinem
perficientem esse, and perfectionis authorem Non licet sine Episcopo baptiz^^e,
neque dothen celebrare. Neither do we permit ^he Lae^ie to do any Priestly
functi^n, as to offer Sacrifice, baptize, impose hands, or to give any
Benediction either little or great. For no man takes this honor to himself,
but ^e who is called by God* Because this grace is given by the imposition of
the Bishops hands. Neither do we give unto Priests the power of ordaining
Deacons, or Lectours, or Ministers, but only to Bishops. This is the order of
the Church* When we did learn the sequel of things from God, indeed what
appertained to the principality of P^iestes we assigned and gave it to
Bishops: and to Priests what belonged to Priestehoode: afterward to Deacons
what appertained to the assistance of both, that these things which concerned
Religion might be performed chastely and cleanely. Neither is it lawful for a
Deacon to offer Sacrifice, or to baptize, or to make any Benediction either
little or great, neither for Priests to ordain Clergymen. It is declared the
Order of the Bishops is the perfecting Order and author of perfection. It is
not lawful without a Bishop to baptize, nor to offer Sacrifice, nor to say
Mass.

6. Whereupon the English Protestants in their most public and authorized
proceedings thus acknowledge: It is evident unto all men, diligently reading
holy Scripturs, and ancient authors, that from the Apostles time, there has
been these orders of ministers in Christ Church, Bishops, Priests and Deaco^s,
which offices were evermore had in such reverent estimation, that no man might
presume to execute any of them, except he were first by public prayer and
imposition of hands approved and admitted thereunto. And these orders should be
continued, and reverently used, and esteemed in this Church of England. And in
this, both their book entitled: Of Consecration of Archbishops, Bishops,
Priests? as their Articles of Religion, and common practice do only allow
and commit such things to them, whom they call and apprehend to be Bishops,
saying: Almighty God giver of all good things by his holy spirit has
appointed them in the Church. Episcopal Order is of divine Ordination, and by
law divine. Christ acted it by the hands of the Apostles. It is an ordinance
Apostolical. He has enacted it for succeding posterity, and so it is a Canon
or Constitution of the whole Trinity. Whereupon the Protestant Purita^s
conclude: If prelacie be de Iure diuino, by the law of God, it receives both
breath and life from the Religion of Rome: And this they offer Publikly to
defend, and the Parliament Protestants so grant, claiming that Ministry they
have, by ordination from Rome. Whereupon these Puritans with general assent
have thus concluded: They cannot see how possibly by the Rules of Divinity,
the separation of our Chu^ches from the Church of Rome, and from the Pope, head
thereof, can be justified. They protest to all the world, that the Pope and
the Church of Rome, and in the^ God, and Christ Jesus himself have had great
wrong and Indignity offered unto them: and that the Protestant Churches are
scismaticall in forsaking the unity and communion with them. If the English
Protestant opinion he maintained: That Bishops Jurisdiction is de Iure diuino,
by the law of God, his Magestie and all the Nobilite ought to be Subject to
Excommunication.

7. Which neither king, Nobles, or unnoble, no meanest Protestants of England
can ^oubt, fear, or pretend against the Bishop of Chalcedon, he neither having
or claiming the ^easte spiritual power or Jurisdiction over any one great or
little, high or lowest Protestant in England. His Episcopal, both Order and
Jurisdiction which (as he construeth) be^ongeth unto it, extending only to
Catho^iks of this kingedome, to keep them in good order, and loyal duty both
to God and their king, as good Catholic Bishops do, and are bound to do.
Which must needs be an help, and no hurt or offense to any Commonwealth,
Bishops learned, loving, and knowing their duty and having charge whereof they
must render a severe account to God, (attended with watchful and reuengfull
eyes upon them) for love will not, or fear dare not, concur unto, or suffer
under them disobedience to heavenly or earthly Prince. They which cannot endure
spiritual duty, are in most danger of lapse into temporal disobedience,
having rejected spiritual power, keeping them in awe and duty to temporal.
Which perhaps caused Constantine our wise king and Emperor to say upon
experience as he did of staggerers in Religion and faithfulness to God. No
doubt but both the Pope of Rome and Rich: of Chalcedon know their offices
sufficiently without any admonishments. They are not ignorant who said, and how
it concerned them. Non possumus aliquid aduersus veritatem sed pro veritate:
We cannot any thing against 2. Cor. 13.
the truth: but for the truth, and, potestatem quam Dominus dedit mihi in
aedification^m, and non destructionem: The power which our Lord has given me
unto edification, and not unto destruction.

8. There is great difference in having, and exercising power from Rome: The
first should not fear them, which would fear without cause of fear: neither
secret and prudent exercise in necessity to redesse or prevent evils. Greater
meetings and assemblies be often made by some in, and of as great danger, and
to less purpose, then would serve privately to examine witnesses, or so to
give a sentence, where the litigants be, and ought to be secret. To do many
usual and necessary act^ of Religion, be as dangerous, and require as great,
and greater assemblies. A public settled Consisto^ie, in any place or ^laces to
be set up, could not but with ^onde ^maginations be thought upon, were the Judge
^ad not vbi reclinet caput suum. Probate of pu^like wills, administrations,
Tithes, Con^racts, Marriages, Divorces, Alimonie, Bas^erdie, and public
slanders among Protestants ^aue public Protestant Courts, and all or ^any mixed
with our temporal laws. Many ^f the remembered instances, as Tithes, and
^asterdies, concerning, inheriting lands, and ^onours determinable only by our
tempo^all laws, with others, cannot come to his au^^ence, except such
imaginaries could and ^ould put Ministers out, and Priests into ^e Benifices of
England. A secret and consioable ending of many of these matters among
^atholikes, though iuridically, can be no ^ore danger in a Bishop, then in a
Regula^ ^rieste. If diversity of Judgments should ^me time happen in the
Judgment of one a ^shop given in private, the inconvenience ^uld be less the
now it is by the I^dgeme^ts ^ many Priests, all of them as much differing ^m
the Protestants Censures, and ^ribunals as those by a Bishop would be. Yet
these few^ cases would chance but seldom. We see the Queens Priests of France
and Sotland to be permitted by the king and state to dea^e with English
Cathol^ks ^ome times br^nging such ca^es. So are all Priests of all Orders,
(little pleasing unto the) necessitated to do so* But seeing there can be no
danger by suc^ secret procedings, none can take that offic^ from a learned
Bishop and leave it to euer^ Priest, learned or not.

9. Such or greater difficulties were from the Apostles time, and therein, in
them an^ Bishops their Successors among Ethnic^ and Pagan Princes; yet the
holy Scripturs before, and Apostolic men, have taught a^ men obedience unto
Bishops, even in su^ days, and all good Christians did so ob^ them. Saint
Peter in Scripture strangely e^ communicated Ananias and Saphira; So d^ S. Paul
Hymineus, Alexander, and the ince^tuous Corinthian; So did the other Apostl^
among Pagans, exercise spiritual Iurisd^ction, So did all Bishops among
Infidels, v^ till the Emperors and Princes more differi^ from Catholics the
Protestants should, we^ converted: yet at that time they exercised sp^rituall
Jurisdiction, and the Christians obey^ them. And now at this time and long vnd^
the Turks, Tartars, Chinenses* and other e^mies to Catholics, Catholic Bishops
do e^ercise their Jurisdiction among the Christi^ and all obey ^t. This is
the case of Catholics under their Bishop in Holland, among the Protestant
Ho^landers. And in his Majesty's Dominion in ^re^and, where Bishops are and do
exe^cise t^eir Iu^isdicti^n, Catholics obeying them. And it is Christ's
ord^nance that ^^ they should do. God forbid any bearing the name Catholic in
England, (^o renowned for holy Con^essou^s of true Religion in this time)
should be wanting in ^uch duty, or any other.

10. But because our Protestant Persecu^ours pretend most exception against the
Bishop of Chalcedon for d^riuing Iurisdi^tion from the ^ee of Rome, we must
needs ^ith all antiquity deliver unto them, that in ^uery age from Christ, we
here in Britani^ ^aue received Bishops and Pastors with their Jurisdiction,
from the S^e o^ Rome and that highest Papal power and authority. ^Ve have
spoake^ before how in the first Age ^aint Peter the first Pope o^ Rome
consecra^d Bishops, and Pri^sts, and founded ^hurches here* We a^de ^urther,
how our Pro^stants eue^ king James himself and others ^y his and their
greatest authority, con^sse of the Apostolik Church: It is our mot^er* ^urch.
And Add. Est capu^ Roma quatenus ab ea ^ffasum est Euang^lium in reliquas

into the rest of the Churches of all the west, and into many of the East, as
also into Barbarous Nations out of the Roman Empiere. Peter preached in no
place, but he there or^ained Bishops. and teachers, and founded Churches, The
Apostle Peter did in every Province appoint one Archbishop, whom all other
Bishops of the same Province should obey. The Archbishop of Britanie was
Aristobulus. S. Clement his Successor Pope, in the later end of this, and in
the beginning of the second age writes of him concerning Britanie Sanctus
Clemens.

Scotland, and the Southern Picts He made Priests, consecrated Bishops, and
unto certain Parishes he denide the whole Land, The Bishop of Rome sent
Ninianus Apostle to the foresaied people giving him his benediction.

14. In the fi^^e age Saint Celestine Pope sent S. Pa^ladius to the Irish and
Scots, S. Patrick after him to the Irish, S Germanus, Lupus, and Seuerus to the
Britans, to root out Pelagianisme, to quiet and settle the Ecclesiastical
state here, which they did, consecrating Bishops Pr^ests, and what else
necessary in these Contries. Which by their power Legatine they so happily
performed, that Protestants themselves (so testifying) among the Scots.
^alladius in hodres number diem, Scotorum Apostolus appellatur: Palladius unto
this day, is called Apostle of the Scots. Among the Irish Patricius incredibili
spiritus feruore Euangeliu^ Hibernis praedicans, ad sinceram Christi fidem eos,
per 60. annos in vinea Domini laborans conuertit. Profan^ Deorum destruxit
templa, Ecclesias sundauit, verbi ministros ordinauit. Patrike preaching the
Gospel to the Irish with incredible fervor of spirit laboring in the viniard
of our Lord, for the space of 60. years, tenuerted them to the true faith of
Christ, the prophaine temples of the Gods ^^ d^stroied, he builded Churches, he
ordained Ministers of the word. Old Nennius living soon after says: Ecclesias
fundauit 365. Ordinauit Nenniu^.
Episcopos 365. aut amplius in quibus spiritus Demin^ e^at: Presbyteros autem
vsque ad ^ri^ milliae ordinauit: He founded 365. Churches, he ordained ^65.
Bishops or more in which was the Spirit of ou^ Lord: but Priests he made 3000.
Which must needs be done as the Popes Legate, for other Countri^s also,
besides Ireland. S. Germanus with Saint Lup^s at the first, and second time
with Saint Seuerus reformed all things among the Britans, be made Bihops and
Priests, and among the rest S. Dubritius A^^hbishop, ^eauing him to be the
Popes Legate here after their going hence.

15. In the Sixth age Saint Dabritius still lived* who resigning his B^^hoprike,
S. David succeeded him, both as Archbishop and Legate, reforming all things,
and Ownes Bri^anniae E^cl^sia modum and R^gulam R^man^ ^uthoritate acceperunt
All the ^hurche^ of Britani^ by Roman authority received both then manner and
Rule. The Pope sent Saint Iuo* an Archbishop in^o Britanie, or then England,
who lived and died here. Saint Kentegern Bishop received Power and Approbation
from the Pope of Rome, going thiter seven times. And Sanctus Papa illu^ virum
Dei and Spiritus sanct^ gra^ia^ plenu^ intelligens, in ^pus ministerij a
Spirita Sancto illi iniun^^i destinauit. The holy Pope understanding him ^o be
a man of God, ^eplenished with the grace of the holy Ghost, he sent him into
the work of the ministry ^h^ch was enjoined him by the holy Ghost. So
renowned was this holy Apostolical Legate here and in all these Western
parts, that both Catholic and Protestant Antiquaries thus deliver unto us;
^raedi^abat ad flumen vsque ^ordens^ and ad mare S^o^um, vbi Caledonios,
Athalos Horestos, ac vicina^m Ion. Ba^^^ descript. Briten. in (...)*

^^tanie (who as Protestants sai^ from Ro^n power, Au^h^^itatem and ^nct^nem

accounts a Bishop ^0. years and disciple to S. ^^^uanus, con^^a^ed Bishop by
S. Pa^^ad it^s who was sen^ there from S. Celestine Pope in or about the are
431. must need^ be living with Saint ^aph at, or a little before Saint Augustin^
^m^ning: And as our Protestants sa^e Sa^^ ^aph joined with Saint Augustine, So
Saint Asaph writer of his master S. Kentegerns li^ proves, that S. Kentegern
was at Rome, wh^ S. Gregory was Pope, and submitted himself to him in all
things, and was approue^ by him also in his Apostolic proceedings.

16. In this time, in the year 596. Sai^ Augustine was sent Legate hither by
the sa^ holy and learned Pope S. Gregory, who b^ his supreme Pastoral power
gave him sp^rituall authority over all Bishops, and other here, in these his
own words unto him: B^ tanniarum omnes Episcopos tuae Fraternitati commi^mus,
Beda l. 1. Eccles. hist. gentis Angl. c. 27.
vt indocti doceantur, infirmi persuasione rebor^tur, peruersi authoritate
corrigantur. We commit ^ the Bishops of Britanie to your Fraternity, that the
^ learned may be taught, the weak by persuasio^ streng^^ned, the wicked
corrected by authority. By this Pap^ power and authority, all things were
orde^ in the Church of England in S. Augustins ti^ and all his Successors by
the same aut^ritie were settled in that Archiepiscopall S^ which he translated
(after 400. years) from London to Ca^terburie. All those Bishops v^ to the
first Protestant Bishop, called Math^ Parker (who was made by Q. Elizabeth b^
will, and manner) received Consecration Pall, power, and Jurisdiction from the Sea Rome, and they swore obedience unto it, their own Parker, Godwin, Ioceline
a^ others in the lives of them, and those York, together with all Registers,
Recor^ Annals, and Antiquities do prove parti^^arly. In general for this
place it suffices in these Protestants publicly approved confessions, to
write it in their own words: Archbishop Parker being the 70. Archbishop after
Augustine, yet of all that number, he was the only man, and the first of all*
which received Consecration, without the Popes Bulls.

17. They assure us, that until the 23. of King Henry the eight (a ssuming
supreamacie to himself) every Bishop in England swore ^uch obedience unto the
Pope. Hoc Iuramentum ^ singulis Episcopis Papae praestari consueuit. Obediens
^ro Beato Petro, Sanctaeque Romanae Ec^lesiae, and Domino meo Domino Papae
suisque successoribus. Papatum Romanum, and R^galia S. Petri adiutor ero ad
retinendum and defendendum, saluo meo ordine contra ^mnem ^ominem: This Oath
was accustomed to be taken by ^uery Bishop. I will be ob^dient to S. Peter and
to the Lord, my Lord the Pope, and to his Successors: I will ^e an helpe^ to
hold and defend the Popedom of Rome and R^t^ of S. Peter against all men. In
the year of Christ 1536. and 23. of King Henry S. they ^are; and the Statuts
themselves so prove: Leges in Parlamento lataesunt, de Rege supremo Ecclesiae
Anglicanae Capite declarando, de Clero Anglicano Regifulij^iendo. Ne quid
deinceps amplius Papae aut Romanae Cu^iae quot unque praetextu ex Anglia
pendatur. De Episcopis consecrandis, alijsque quae Roma an^ea ge^ebantur, intra
Regnum persierendis. De Eccle^^asticorum beneficiorum primitijs atque decimis
Principi in perpetuum soluendis. His legibus potentia Papalis, quae nongentis
amplius annis in Angli^ durauis ^entidi^. Laws were enacted in the Parliament,
of declaring the King to be supreme head of the English Church, of subiecting
the English Cle^gie to the King. That nothing heareafter under what pretense
so^uer in England shall depend of the Pope or the Court of Rome. Of
cons^crating Bishops and performing other a^^air^^ within the kingdom, which
before were done at Rome. Of paying p^rpetually to the Prince the first fruits
of Ecclesiastical Benefices and Ti^hes. By these laws the Papal power, which
has b^ne in for^^ for these nine hundred years, did fall. And this was ^o
strange a thing and wonder in the world to see the supremacy of the Pope of
Rome thus taken from him by a temporal Prince, after so many hundreds of
years continuance, and a lay man to style himself supreme head of the
Church, that his very flatterers themselves cry out: Habetur Con^ilium Londini
i^ quo Eccle^ia Angli^an^ formam potesta^^s nullis a^te temporibus visum
induit. Henricus enim Rex* caput i^sius Eccl^si^ constituitur. At London there
is holden a Council in which the English Church ha^h put on a power, which in
no times past was* seen. For King Henry is constituted head of that Church. So
large testimony have we from our greatest Adu^rsaries witnessing that the
Catholics of England give no other power, or Jurisdiction to the Pope of Rome,
then he had ever, without any inte^ruption. And in this we have ^he general
assent of all our Kings, Princes, Bishops and others, and all the Christians in
the world, from the tim^ of Christ, until long after the greater part of King
Henry the eight his reign: No King against it, but he, (whom the Protestant
Sir Walter Ralegh sufficiently discribeth) his young son King Edward the
sixth of that name* ouerruled by Protestant Protectours* and Q^eene Elizabeth a
woman. King James wiser then any of them, has le^t it thus publick^y in open
assembly declared by his Regal sentence: The kings Resolution is, that no
Church ought further to se^erate he^selfe from the Church of Rome, either in
doctrine or Ceremonies, then she has departed from herself. when she was in
her flo^ishing and best estate: Wherefore as ^he Bishop o^ Chalcedon and
Catholics o^ England may not depart from the Church of Rome in this question:
So it will be a great wonder if King Charles and his Council should thus
persecute that, which to them and all should be so honorable. They may not
persecute him for his Episcopal* Order, for that likewise is proved the most
glorious calling in the Church of Christ. All English Parlamentarie Protestants
confess the Bishop of Chalchedon, (and all cons^crated as he was, by the Roman
Order, containing all and more then they use, and by most true and lawful
Consecratours) to be an undoubted true and lawful Bishop. And so it must needs
be* for whether we will follow the present Roman Order, ever used here since
Saint Augustins time, before their new devised form of so called Consecration
made by King Edward the Sixth a child, and altered by his Sister Elizabeth
Queen a woman: or that which the Britans, Scots, and Irish used long before:
^t is out of question by all, that the Bishop of Chalcedon, and every one such,
is a true and most undoubted lawful Bishop, having by due and true
Consecratours whatsoever is contained, or prescribed to be done in either of
both, which the new Protestant form, if they had true Consec^atours, comes
short, and wants even in things essential both by all others, and their own
judgment and practice.

18. The present Roman Order has more, though Ceremonial, then that of our
Brita^s, Scots and Irish, therefore I exemplify only in this; and the rather
to give Satisfaction to our Protestants, so extolling them for their Apostolik
Religion never changed or altered as they say. Before S. Kentegern was
consecrated Bishop all most 1200. years since, this was their old use, and
manner herein, as Saint Asaph his Scholar a Bishop, and others prove: Mos in
Britannia inoleuerat, in Consecratione Pontificum tantummodo capita little sacri
Cbrismatis infusione perungere, cum inuocatione Sancti Spiritus, and
benedictione and manus impositione. It was an ancient custom among the
Britans, that in the Consecration of Bishops, they only anointed them on
their heads with holy Chrisme, invocation of the Holy Ghost, Benediction and
imposi^ion of ^ands. This was done by consecrating Bis^ops. And this was, Mos
Britonum, Scotorum, and ^ Hibernia: The Custom of the Britans, Scots and in
^eland, In those times, when Canons of Coun^ells were not made of this matter,
or not ^nowne here by reason of great troubles in ^ese parts, as our
Antiquaries write, and yet ^ey were excused as having true and essen^ally
needful Consecration. Insulam enim quasi ^ira orbem positi, emergentibus
Paganorum infesta^onibus Canonum erantignari: Ecclesiastica ideo Cen^ra ipsis
condiscendens excusationem illorum admit tit ^ha^ ^arte: For the inhabitants of
the Island, being as were placed out of the world, were ignorant of the anons by
reason of the Continual invasions of the Pa^ans: and therefore the
Ecclesiastical Censure yelding unto them in this part, adm^^ted their
excusation. But ^ur Protestants cannot be excused, being not ^gnorant, but
Co^temners of the Canons, and ^ot this only, but omitting that which by ^he
custom of the Britans, Scots, and Irish ^he old Roman Order in that time, (as
Al^uinus, Amalarius and others 800. years ^nce term it in their days,) was
used then, and is now:) all of them delivering, that ^oly unction by true
Bishops, to be necessa^ie and essential, ever naming the man to be ^onsecrated

that vnctio^ be ended and then Bishop consecrated, ^piscopus consecratus. Our

of Bishops, and ^oly ^uction by the exampse of the Apostles, because all
sa^ctification consists in the ho^ ghost, whose mu^^^ble power is mixed with
ho^ Chrisme and by this R^^e, s^lemne ordination is to ^ celebrated. O^^
Protestants a ^o confes^e the the holy Fathers both of the Greek and L^tine
Church, were thus co^ecrated. Of Saint Basile Vn^^ion^ s^c^a adh^b^ta est

therf^ he is anointed on the head, in imitatio^ of him who the head of the
whole Church, and he by the grace the ^nnointing, is made the head of the Chu^^
committed unto him. So Saint Gregory: Qui S. Gregor. mag. in c. 10. l. 1.

c^n^^^^ation of the Britan^ Scots, and I^i^h ^^ be essentially vali^e. S* Saint Bede, Amal^^^^s, S. Iuo, Stephant Eduensis, and other ancient writers, and
Expositours of holy mysteries.

19. Concerning the Ceremony of the Book of Gospels laid upon the
Consecrated, though Alcuinus says; Non reperitur in Alcuinus l^b. d^ (...).
c. ^^.
^uthoritate veteri, neque noua, sed neque in Romana ^raditione: It is not
found in authority either ancient ^^ new, yea not in the Roman tradition.
And Ama^arius; Neque vetu^ authoritas intimat, neque Apostolica traditio, neque
Canoni^a authoritas: Neither ancient authority, neither Aposteli^all
tradition, nor Canonical authority does intimate any such thing. Yet we find
this Cerem^nie to ^aue been observed in the time of S. Denis for ^n his book
of the Ecclesiastical Hiera^chie ^e has these words; Pontifex quidem qui ad
perfe^ionem Dionisiu^ (...).
virtutemque pontifice dignam eu^^i^ur, vt^o^e genu flexo ante altar, supra
caput habet libros a to traditos, manumque pontifi^is: The Bishop indeed which
is elevated to worthy perfection and virtue of a ^i^hop, kneling on both knees
before the Altar, has ^on his head the books given from God, and the hand ^
the Bishop. Which Ceremony is also used ^ily in the Catholic Church as is to
be ^ene in the Rub^iks of the Roman Pontifi^ll, for after the ring is put on
the finger of ^e new Consecrated Bishop, this direction ^^ntificale ^omanum de
Cons^cratione El^cti ^n Episc^^^^.
given; Tum Consecrator accipit librum Euangelio^^ de spatulis Consecrati: Then
the Consecratour ta^h the book of the Gospells from the shoulders of the
^nsecrated. But this makes not much to the ^rpose, it being only (as I have
said) a Ceremony, and not essential to the Consecration of a Bishop: and
that true and undoubted Bishops were made before the Gospells were written.
Otherwise the whol^ Church then, ever after, and now, and eue^ had wanted it,
and had no Ecclesiastical Order at all. Which is the lamentable and desperate
condition of such as persecute a tru^ Bishop and Priest for their Order and
power thereby confessing their want both of tha^ which is essential in this
high office, as als^ consecratours to perform it, consecrat tru^ Priests, or
confer any Ecclesiastical Orde^ or degree at all, not the meanest in that kin^
to any person.

20. All Authors agree, even Protestants i^ their Catalogues of British and
English Bi^hops, that we had continual succession o^ such here in great
numbers, until Queen Elizabeth by her supreamacie deprived an^ deposed them.
And to keep it far from the ^^me of an Innovation to have one such Bishop,
Successor to so many, if we have tha^ liberty in time of Persecution when
Bishop are driven from their Sees, (usual in histories) to remember and honor
them in Exi^ and Persecution, we have still kept a Succesion of Bishops in, or
of this nation: Of tho^^ which were deprived of their Bishop prick we have,
Richard Pates Bishop of worcheste who subscribed to the Council of Trent h^
being there present, by this Title, Richard^ Patus wigornie^sis Episcopus.
Thomas Goldwell Bishop Godw. Catal. of Bish. in Worcest. in Ric. Pates in S.
Asaph. in Thom. Goldwell*
of Asaph lived at Rome 20. years after that deposing. Thomas watson Bishop of
Lincoln was committed to prison in the I Will of Elie and died about the year
1584. Thus the Protestants themselves deliver, and moreover they deliver much
praise and commendatio^s of the^ and all others our renowned Bishops 14. or
more in number, who were deposed, and persecuted by Queen Elizabeth yea far
more and greater, the^ they do of those which were intruded into their places.
Before or soon after the death of Bishop Wa^son of Lincoln, Owen Lew is of
this our Nation was consecrated Bishop of Cassan, in whose lifetime our most
Illustrious Cardinal, William Allan was honored with that dignity, and
consecrated Archbishop of Ma^k^en, who lived with these honors until the 16.
day of October in the year of Christ 1594. ^n his time William Gifford was by
Pope Clement the eight made Deane: Ecclesiae Diui Petri Insulensis: Of Saint
Peter's Church at Lile. And afterward, he was ordained Archbishop of Rhemes in
Champaine in France, where he lately lived. And whilst he lived Archbishop,
both William of Chalcedon, and Richard also, who is now so persecuted, were by
highest Papal authority consecrated ad sent into England. And what man of
ordinary knowledge, Judgment, or understanding, will adventure to say, but
all these were renowned men, as also diverse of our renowned Priests, most
worthy of Episcopal honor and dignity in equal times, honorably styled
and registered for all posterity not only as great glories of their Country
England, but the whole Church of Christ. Therefore to have one of such worthy
men a Bishop in his native Country, (bearing for avoiding offense his Title of
a place so far hence) which from the first Conversion thereof to Christ had
3. Archbishops and many Bishops above 1400. years past, should not in the new
English Religion (teaching the Church of God never wanted Bishops, and
acknowledging both him and all Catholikely consecrated Bishops, and Priests to
be true and lawful Bishops and Priests undoubtedly by right ordination) be
offensive, but desired, such Order, Function and dignity being by their
public testimonies most needful, excellent and honorable with all true
Professors of Christian Religion.

21. Thus we see a Succession of English Bishops though not all in England but
in other Countries some of them consecrated and remaining, (a thing not
unusual in times of Persecution and bannishment of Bishops, as in the great
lights (in their time) of Gods Church S. Hilarious S. Athanasius, S. Chrysostom
and others long time exiled:) yet thereby did not interrupt a continual
Succession in their Sees. What least exception then can be taken against our
renowned Bishop of Chalcedon? for Order, and degree so honorable, and eminent,
by all testimonies; for his own worthiness, and worthily therefore to be had in
high reverence, even with his Persecutours; he brings able witnesses with
him; his known love and honor to our king, Queen and Country; his own holy
life, and conversation; his learned works, and writings; with all at home and
abroad he has ever piously and gratefully conuersed, and with honor defended
and justified himself against Male^olants. Among all English Catholick^ o^
Protestants few are to be found which have more defended the honor of our
Sovereign, ^one more acceptable to his Majesty's frieds and Allies in
marriage, no man among so ma^y renowned Priests of England (worthy of ^reatest
honor in equal times) adjudged so ^t to supply such place by that highest
Pa^or, which has showed great care and love four king, Queen and hoped
Posterity, and Country. And since Persecution and ^roclamation against him,
what could such a ^an in Persecution do more, then he has ^one, in decreeing,
and Ordering that all ^riests and Catholics should daily with de^otion pray
for our king, Queen, State and Country. And both since the coming in of ^im,
and William of Chalcedon of happy ^emorie his Predecessor: as likewise
before ^e Catholics of England have been and now ^e known to be the most
loyal, dutiful and living Subjects in our dearest Country of England.

THE VI. CHAPTER.
That our English Priests who teach al^ things with the Apostolical Religion
are truly consecrated, worthy men, an^ are to be honored, and not persecuted*

1. Having redeemed Episcopal Ord^^ and dignity, conferred by the S^ of Rome,
from all Imputation of wick^ obloquies, and made it known to be so hig^ and
honorable; we might spare all furth^ labor for exemption and defense of
Prie^^lie Function, seeing every Bishop of nece^sitie must be a Priest, and
whatsoever of the calling is noble and glorious in a Bishop must needs be such
in Priests; Episcopal h^nour and consecration adds an higher a^ greater
worthiness to him that was before Priest, but cannot take away or diminish a^
excellency or renown he had before. T^ Protestants of Scotland do confess
(whi^^ all know) that after Catholic Religion w^ overthrown there, they had
not any pretended Bishops before King James (accordi^^ to his manner of making
such) gave su^ Titles to them. And their Knoxe, Buchanan, Forbs, Bale, and
others both of England and Scotland are not ashamed to say that before the
sending of Saint Palladius thither ^y Saint Celestine Pope about the year 430.
^lonckes who were only Priests supplied ^he place of that dignity with that
People. ^ut malice to Episcopal worthiness, and ^ower, their own known want
thereof, or ^rosse Ignorance in Antiquities, and Eccle^asticall Veremun ^^
hist. Bo^th. Scotor. histor. in Maximo. Holinsh. histor. of Scotl. Io. Bal. l.
de Scripto. rib. centur. 2. in Coil, Sedul Sige^ert. and (...) ibid.
affairs, have blinded them with this ^arknesse, because long before that time
in ^he days of Dioclesia^, Scotland had Bishops, and Saint Amphibolus was
Bishop in the I Will ^f Man. In the time of Maximus Scotland had ^iuer^ Bishop
bannished by him. And Hilde^ertus, and Coilus Sedulius Scots by Na^on and
renowned Bishops are honored in ^stories before Saint Palladius came thi^er,
as both these Protestants and sarre ^etter Antiquaries deliver for undoubted
^uthes.

2. But if we should not only (as we must) ^teeme Priests inferiors to
Bishops, but which we may not nor cannot) e^e^ to them^lues, and make them but
Deacons: yet ^oth divine and best human authority as^reth us, that by that
calling they are to be ^onoured, and not dishonorably persecu^d. The holy
Scripture honors the^ with ^ much true consecration as our Protestants
^estowe upon their pretended Bishops* public and solemn prayer and imposition
of the Apostles, the chiefest Bishops hands* Orantes imposuerunt eis manus:
Praying they imposed Act. ^.
hands upon them. And declares them, Vir^^ boni testimonij plenos spiritu
sancto. Men of good testimony, full of the holy Ghost. The Apostolic Fathers
command all lay persons, to b^ subject unto, and reverence them. Saint
Ignatius (...). Epist. ad Smyrnensis. Epist. ad ^phesios.
says* Diaconos reuereamini vt ex Dei praecepto ministrantes: Honor yea the
Deacons as ministrin^ by the precept of God. And Enitimini charissimi subiecti
esse Episcopo, and Presbyteris, and Diaconis. Q^ enim his obedit, ob die
Christo: My dearest do yo^ best to be subject to the Bishop, and Priests, and
Deacons, for he that obeys these, obeys Christ. An^ other where. Oporter
and Diaconis, mysterioru^ Chr^sti ^pist ad T^allian.
ministris per omnia placere. Sunt Ecclesiae Dei adm^nistratores. Ipsi itaque
tales sunt, and vos reueremi^ illos vt Christum Iesum, cuius vicarij sunt. Qu^
Diaconi, quam Imitatores angelicarum virtu^um, q^^ pu^um and in^ulpatum
ministerium illi (Episcopo exhibent, vt Sanctus Stephanus Beato Iacobo, and T^
motheus and Linus Paulo, Anacletus and Clemens P^tro? Qui igitur his non
obedit, sine Deo prorsus, ^^mpurus est, and Christian contemnit, and
constitution^^ eius im^inuit: And it is expedient to please Deacon the
ministers of the mysteries of Christ in all things* They are the
Administratours of the Church of Go^ And they are such, and you should
reverence the^ as Ies^ Christ whose Vicars they are. What are Deacons, b^ the
followers of Angelical virtues who presents (t^ ^^e Bishop) a pure and
perfect mystery, as S. Secu^ did to Saint James, Timothy and Linus to Paul,
Anacletus and Clement to Peter? whosoever therefore obeys not these, is
altogether without God, and impure, and does contemn Christ, and does distroy
his Constitution. Saint Polycarp says, subiecti estote S. Polica^* epist. ad
Philip.
Presbyteris, and Diaconis, sicut Deo, and C^risto: Be yea subject unto the
Priests and Deacons, as to God and Christ. Our Protestants themselves in their
public book named The form and manner of making and consecrating Bishops,
Priests and Dea^ons. Say, that from the Apostles time they have ^ene in
Christ's Church, evermore had in reverent estimation. Therefore if the Deacons
and Ministers to Priests in the holy Sacrifice of Mass, their highest
dignity, are thus by all testimonies to be reverenced, honored and obeyed:
then the sacred Sacrificing Priests to whom they thus minister, and serve, may
not be dishonored, much less persecuted with most barbarous and unchristian
contume^ies, disgraces, and deaths, for that their so eminent Order and
dignity.

3. The holy Sripturs testify that in their Consecration they receive grace,
the holy Ghost, power to bind and loose, to retain and forgive sins, to
offer Sacrifice to God, and to do what Christ himself did in that ^ind. So
the holy Fathers expound these Scripturs, and teach from them: and our most
^untient renowned British writer thus affirms G^la^^ (...) ^x^id. and c^xq.
(...)*
Omni sancto Sacerdoti promittitur. Quaecunque ^oluer is super terram, ^runt
soluta and in ^oelis: and quaecunque liganeris super terram, erunt ligata and
in c^^^. Vero Sacerdoti dicitur: tu ^s Petrus, and super hane (...), 16*
petram aedisicaho Ecclesiam meam: It i^ promised to every holy Priest.
Whatsoever thou ^ha^t loose in earth, it shall be loosed also in the heavens:
and whatsoever thou shall bind upon earth, it shall he bound also in the
heavens. To a true Priest it is said, thou art Peter, and upon this Rock I
will build my Church. The Scripture says to, and concerning such: pascite qui
in vobis est gregem Dei: Feed the flock of God (...), ^
which is among you. Qui been praesunt Praesbyteri, displici honor digni
habeantur: maxim qui laborant i^ ver^o and doctrina: The Priests that rule
well, let them be esteemed worthy of double honor: especially they that
labor in the word and doctrine. The Apostles Successors give them as much:
Presbyteri^ Says Saint C^ement si assidue in studio docendi^ verbum Dei
laborauerint, seponatur dupla etiam Clem. Constable. Apost. lib. 2. c. ^.
peri^o in gratiam Apostolorum Christi, quorum locum tenent, ^^nquam Consilarij

been tibi sit. E^, qui maledici^ c. 35.
patriaut matri, morte mortatur: quanto magis de patribus spiritualibus verbis
Dei moneamur, honor and charitate eos prosequi, vt beneficos and ad Deu^
Legatos. ^. 3^.
Quanto anima corpore praestan^^or est, tanto est Sacer^^tium regno
excellentius: Let there be a double porti^ reserved for the Priests in honor
of the Apostles of Christ, which shall have labored in teaching of the word of
God diligently. Whose places they enjoy, as Counselors of the Bishop, and
the Crown^ of the Church. They are the Council and Senate of the Church. If the
holy Scripture says of carnal parents: honor thy father and thy mother,
that it may be well with thee. And whosoever does curse his father or his
mother, shall die: how much more shall we be admonished by the words of God, of
our Spiritual fathers, to respect them with honor and charity, as
beneficial to us and Legates to God? How much more noble the soul is then the
body so much more excellent is Priesthood before a Kingdom. And Saint
Ignatius adds. Ignatius epist. ad Smy^^^,
Sacerdotium est, omnium bonorum, quae in hominibus sunt apex; qui aduersus
illud furit, non hominem ign^minia afficit, sed Deum and Christum Iesum
primegeni^um, qui natura solus est s^^us Sacerdos Patris* Priesthood is the
^rnament of all things, which a^e in men^ whosoever does rage against it, he
does not dishonor a man, but God and Christ Jesus the first begotten, who by
nature is the only hight Priest of ^his father. The Apostles Cl^m. constable. l.

fe^erit, quam qui aduersus regnum: If he that sets on a King is judged
worthy of punishment, although he be his son or his friend, how much more
should he be blame worthy that insulteth over Priests. For by how much more
Priesthood excels a Kingdom, when i^ does by office govern souls, by so
much more greater punishment is he to be afflicted, who shall rashly do any
thing against it, th^^ he who has ^^ended a Kingdom* Presbyteri sunt (says
Saint Ignatius) consess^ (...) ^pist. ad ^^^llon.

age and made Priest by Saint Pete^ Anacletus Ep. 2.
says: Iniuria Sacerdotum pertinet ad Christum, cui^ vice funguntur: The
injury done unto Priests, appertains to Christ, whose place they supplieth.
And a^ Protestants (Magdeburgen: and Rob. Barn. i^ Anacleto) say: Anacletus

Ecclesiasti^u^ foru^^ Anacletus judged those to be against Christ, who would
go to law with Priests; the Robbers of Christ or the Churches moneys, he
determined they should be condemned ^or Murd^r^^ because, says he, the
Apostles by the ^^ecept of our Savior ^o^maunded the privileges of the ^^urch
and Priests to be kept inuiolated. In Ecclesiastical affairs he willed the
greater matters to be referred ^ the Primate, the lesser unto the Metropolitan
Bis^p: and worldly businesses to be ended by prophaine ^udges, it is lawefull
for all those that are oppressed ^ appeal unto the Ecclesiastical Court.

4. S. Martial living in Christ's time and sent ^to France by Saint Clement,
has these S. Martial ep. ad Bur^^* ga.
^ords; Sacerdotes Dei omnipotentis, qui vitam vobis ^buunt in calice and viuo
pane, honorare debetis. Quod ^d^i per inuidiam immolauerunt, putantes se nomen

for bad that a Clergy man should be ^ught to the common T^^b^nall. Cle^^^u^

and Apostolic ^ of the first age whom all must subscribe ^o, and follow in
such things, and all of ^^ except Saint Ignatius, either Popes of ^me, or
directed by them. as Saint Martial, ^ so must needs mean and understand
^ests consecrated by Roman Iurisdic^ion power and Order. And Saint Ignatius
Su^cessor to Saint Peter, and inscribing his Epistle to the Romans: Ignatius
Ecclesiae sanctificat^ quae praesidet in loco Regionis Romanorum: Ignatius ^
the hallowed Church, which does bear rule in the R^gion of the Romans. And
writing of the highe^ power thereof could not deny the pri^^ Jurisdiction of
that See. And they all direct^ speak of Massing Priests, and Sacrifice. ^
Clement sets down the whole order ^ the Mass, and expressly writes that
t^^ Priest in mass offers Sacrificium mun^um ^ incruentum per Christum
institutum, mysterium ^^ S. Clem. constable. Apost. l. 8. c. 5.
Testamenti. A pure and vnblooddie Sacrifice instit^^ by Christ, the mystery
of the new Testament. Continual Tradition has preserved unto us ^^ Masses of
Saint Peter, Saint James, Saint M^thew, Saint Mark and other Apostles, a^
Dionis. Ar^op. Eccles. Hi^r. ^. 2. 3.
Disciples of Christ. Our old British antiq^ties do prove that the old
Apostles Ro^^ Mass was in their time used in France and ^^ brought over hither
into Britanie. Saint D^nis the Areopagite Saint Paul's scholar, ^sent Apostle
into these parts by Saint Pete^ or Saint Cleme^ts missio^, has a form the^ of
setting down the Al^ar, oblation, concration, Sacrifice, worship and adoration
Christ there present: o diuinum peni^us sacr^^ mysterium, obducta tibi
significantium ope^imenta ^ ^orum dignanter ap^riens, nobis palam atque
ape^r^^esce: O altogether divine and sacred mystery vo^safe to disceuer to us
the couerings of thy signifi^ ^^gnes, and shine on us openly and clearly: And
he shows the Sacrifice to be reverenced, diuin^ ^unera reuerenter ostendens.
Saint Ignatius speaks S. Ignati^^ epist. ad ^myrn. Ep. ^d To.
plainly of Priests sacrificing. Sacrificium ^ff^rre. M^ssam celebrere: To
offer Sacrifice, to say Mass. And he assures us the Sacrifice is. Panis
^^l^stis, caro Christi Filij Dei: The heavenly bread, ^he flesh of Christ the
son of God. And Theodore^us, writing against the Ebeonite Heretics de^ying
Christ to have a true body he says ^hus as Theodoret relates: Eucharistius
and ob^^tiones non admittunt, qu^d non confi^^antur Eucha^stiam Igna^* ^pud
^h^^dor. in (...)* Dialog. 1.
^sse ^arnem Saluaetoris nostr^ I^su Christi, quae ^o peccatis nostris passa
est, quam Pate^ sua benignita^ sus^itauit. They do not ad^^t the Eu^^rist and
^bla^ons, because they will not confess the Euch^rist to be ^e flesh o^ our
Savior Jesus Christ, which suffer^d for ^r sins, whom the fa^he^ thr^ugh h^
goodness^ ^aised ^aine. Where we ^^nde (...) of ^hrists Incarnation, and ^^uing
a true bodi^ ^d blood to have imp^g^ed this most holy ^acrifice, and such
S^^^ifi^ng Priests: for ^e words and ins^itu^ion of Christ, were so ^aine in
ordaining ^his most sacred ob^ation ^ his body and b^ood under the forms of
^ead and wine, and a perpetual Priesthood ^ perform it, that except by
denial of a true ^die to Christ, there was no way la^ed open ^ impugn it. And
therefore that most holy ^d learned Apostolic man largely there ^nfuteth those
imaginary Heretics, pro^ing Christ had a true body to offer, to su^fer in,
to redeem the world, and the holy Eucharist was the same.

5. S. Martial has delivered this plainly before, saying that the Priests
do offe^ upon the Altar the same body of Christ, which the Jews crucified,
And Christ so commanded. Saint Anacletus was made such a Massin^ Priest by S.
Peter, and as Protestants confess he declared how both Priests and Bishop^
^arnes and Magde^urgenses i^ Anacl.
were to offer this most blessed Sacrifice: Anacletus sacrificaturus, ministros
vestihus sacris indut^ ce^ testes and custodes sibi ad^ibere ordinauit.
Episcop^ vero vt plures ministros sibi in sacris facie^dis adiu^ga^ Anacletus
being to offer Sacrifice appointed that M^nisters adorned with sacred
vestements, as witness^ and keepers should be admitted unto him. And that
Bishop in offering sacrifices should add unto himself many assistants. And of
Saint Alexander Pop^ living and learning his divinity in this Apostolic age,
they acknowledge* In miss^, pri^ ^dem in ^lexand.

added further the reason of the effect of this Sacri^ice, which is, because it
wipeth away sins, saying* because in Sacrifices nothing is greater then the
body and blood of our Sa^iour.

field of the Christian Church* and at las^ by the shedding of his blood in the
year of our Lord 159. ^egained the Crown of Martyrd^me. Therefore we n^ede
not doubt, but all these lived some time in the first hundred of years. Saint
An^cetus being immediate Successor to S. Piu^ as he must ^eedes be consecrated
a Massin^ sacrifi^ing Priest, (not others once imagine^ to be otherwise
consecrated, or to give con^^cration, and confirming and using the sa^ manner
and Order, not only in Orderi^ P^^ests, and other inferior Ecclesi^stic^
persons but Bishops* Archbishops, and M^tropolitans, as his Predecessors had
d^n^ and so consecrating 17. Priests,) must of n^cessitie pers^uere in this
doctrine and pr^ctise: especially when his immediate Su^^^ for Saint Soter by
all testimonies made D^crees about all things concerning holy Mass^ Altars, and
other necessaries and that, Sa^^c^ns habeat secum adiutorem Sacerdotem. vt nu^^
^ost ci^um potu^que sieve qu^dlibet minimum sumptum Missae^ facere praesumat. vt

Pric^^ should presume to say Mass^ solem^ely without two^ ^ere present to

says Domi^us vo^iscum: Our Lord ^e with you, and Ord^^ pro ^r^ me: pray yea
for me. It is most con^en^^^ tha^ ^^swere ^e made to his salutation*

7. Thus Protestants and o^^^^rs acknow^edge, and yet do^ write of them and
their ^redecessours, that they were holy m^n and ^lartyrs, and that the Church
of Rome wa^ ^^en in pu^itie of doctrine and Religion, and ^^t the Pri^sts the^
were Sacrificing Massing ^riests, the Bishops cons^crated no others, ^e public
Service and Sacrifice was Mass^* ^ such manner as now ^s used. And S.
El^^^erius which ^mmed^ately succeeded, Sa^^ ^ter sent such Massing Bishops and
Priest^ ^ther into Britanie, to perform the general^ ^onuersion thereof, there
being no other to ^ sent or implo^ed in such, or any like affairs ^^ Priestlie
office and function, in that holy ^^d unspotted time of Religion, by all
co^sents. And the chiefest Protestants, even Matthew Parker their first new
fashioned Archbishop of Canterbury with others both acknowledge that Saint
Peter and Saint James said Mass, and that the Order of Sacrifice, or Mass,
Missa si^ dicta, continued from Christ's Institution thereof ^n the Primative
Church, above two hundreds of years unto Pope ^epherine his time, and then ^e
al^ered i^ to a more excellent matter and form. A Christi ^rimo i^s^ituto,
ducentis amplius annis in primiti^^ Ecclesia durauit: done eam Z^pherinus 16.
Romanus Pontis^x, quorundans suasionibus ad pulchriorem materiam forma^que
mutare voluit. This Pope S. Zepherine, was after Pope Eleutherius, and Pope
Victor, by whose means, and holy sa^rificing Bishops and Priests sent hither
by there authority, this Kingdom of Britanie, wholly and generally was
converted. And these Persecutours of holy Mass and Priesthood consesse that
the very same Mass and celebration thereof, which Christ instituted and hi^
hig^e Priests and Apostles used, was still prac^^^ed without chang, and
alteration. And the ^hang and mutation then in the ^^^e of Saint Zepherine
made, was for the more per^ectio^ thereof; For coming to set down what this
changing was, they find it to be no other, but that he decre^d Christ blood
should not be consecrated in Chalices made of wood, but better matter. Christi
san^uin^^ Consecratione^ in vitreo Calice non ligneo, vt antea* sin^ debere
flatuit: He decreed that the Consecration of the blood of Christ ought to be
done in a Chalice of glass, not of wood as it was done before. And after
Viban^ the first of that name immediate *except Calixtus) Succes^or to the same
Saint Z^pherinus, (by these Protestan^s them (...)) thus declared and ordained
that (...) should be of Gold or silver, (...) in po^ter Churches. Ne vasa (...)
au^ au^ea, ^ut arge^ ea, aut stannea in (...) gem dixit. We are assured b^th by
(...) all and particular Testimonies that (...) Priests came hither, and that
the (...) Church ser^ice was Ma^^e and ^o the La^ine tongue. So had our old
(...) by Protestants suppressed* in the (...) of his book, as Abbo^ (...) in
publi^^ Parliament in the first year of Queen Elizabeth. Saint (...)
Protestants so also consessing witen^sseth that ^^r ^^itans in this their
Conversion, had (...) A^^ars for Mass in their Churches, and su^^ ^^^ests.

8. The Protestanes also propose unto us an Author so Reu^rend and au^^^nt in
this our Britanie, that ^n the year of Christ 366. his Hom^^ies or Sermons
were usually and publicly read in the Churches here, where^n, is most
manifestly and particularly pro^ed, that the public service was the same Mass
which is now used, the Priests su^^ Priests, and Christ really present,
^^^ere^, worshipped and prayed unto there, as by the same antiqui^ie is ^uident
in these words thereof: In the old law faithful men offered to God diverse
Sacrifices, that had foresignification of Christ's body, which for our sins
he himself to his heavenly Father has since offered to Sacrifice. Certainly
this Housell, which we do now hallow at Gods Altar, is a remembrance of
Christ's body which he off^red for us, and of his blood which he shed for us:
So ^e himself commaunde^^ do this in my remembrance. Once suffered Christ by
himself, but yet nevertheless, his suff^ring is daily renewed at this Supper,
through mystery of the holy Hous^ll. In that holy Housell (...) ^ one thing in
it seen, and an other understood. That which is there seen has bodily
shape: and that we do there vnde^^stand has ghostly might. The House^ is
dealed into sondrie parts, ^hewed between teach, and sent into the bodlie.
Howbeit nevertheless afte^ ghostly might it is all in every part. Many
receive tha^ holy body, and yet notwithstanding, it is so all in every part,
after ghostly mystery. That innocent lamb which the old Israelits did then
kill, had signification after ghostly understanding, of Christ's suffering, who
vnguiltie shed his blood for our redemption. Hereof (...) Gods servants at
every Mass, Agnus De^ qui ^ollis (...) mundi, Miserere nobis. Where we find a
mos^ plain and general concordance between the old Primative Christian
Britans, and the Priests of the Roman Church at this time, ^^ this holy
sacrificing Massing Priesthood, and Mass, by this most ancient and venerable
authority even as it pleases Protestant^ to publish and translate it. For
wereas they (...) that Aelfricus in the year of Christ (...) translated this
Author out of latin into the Saxon language, it is a thing most certain and
unquestionable with all men that know antiquities, that these words which I
have cited from these Protestants, be not the Saxo^ and old English speech in
that time.

9. Our old Cildas also (as the Protestants propose and recomme^d him unto us)
teaching (as they also hold) that our Christian Britans never changed, or
forso^ke the Apostol^ke Christian Religion which they received from Rome by
Massing Priests, and Prelats^ their Priests from the beginning said Mass^, and
offered sacrifice on holy Altars, and their Altars were the seat of the (...)
sacrifice. Sacramundo cord ^reque consici^^^. Sacrific^^^es inter altaria
sta^tes. Sacrificium ^^^erences, al^a^^ adsistunt, sacra altaria, Sacresan^ta
(...) coel^stis seeds; And their Priests th^n were consecrated to such holy
function as now they are Benedictione initiantur Sacerdo^um man^^: The^^ ^ands
were consecrated, and they which did daily offer the holy and heavenly
sacrifice of Christ^ blessed body and blood at, and upon the sacred Altars,
consecrating it by conse^rating words Mundo ore con^leiunt, must needs have
such Priestlie power, given unto them in their Consecration, not having any
such before, to consecrate, and offer Christ's most Sacred body and blood in
the holy Mass, as is contained in the most old and ancient orders of
Consecration in those times, and these word^ of Bishops consecrating Priests,
first praying for them that are to be ordered Priests: ^^run^ atque unma^u^^u^
m^nisterij tu^ donum custodiant, and Po^^^le Romanum in consecratione
Presbyterorum.
per obsequium ple^^s tuae, panem and vinum in corpu^ and sanguinem Filij
t^^immaculata ben^dictione transforment. That they may observe the pure and
imma^^l^ gift of thy mystery, and t^rough the obedience of thy people, they
may transform bread and wine by the ^^ maculat benediction into the body and
blood of thy son. Which prayer being ended, the consecrating Bishop this
proceeds: Expleta aute^ oratione, acc^p^^ns oleum san^^um, fa^^at crucem su^^
ambas manus eorum, dicens^ Consecrare and sanctifi^^re digneris Domine man^^
istas per istam vnctionem, and nostram benedictionem, vt quecumque
consecrauerint, consecrentur: and qu^cunque benedixerint, benedicantur and
sanctificontur in nomine Domini Jesus Christi. Hoc ^acto acci^^ patenam cum
obla^^, and Calicem cum vino, and de^ ^^, dicens: Accipite potestatem, offerre
Sacrificium Deo, Missa^que celebrare t^pro viuis, qu^ pro de^^eris in nomine
Domini. And the prayer being endea, taking the holy oil, he shall make a
Cross ^^ both the hands of the Priests, saying, Thou shall vouchsafe^^ Lord to
conse^^t and sanctify these hands by this holy ^yntement, and our benedi^^ion,
that whatsoever they shall cens^^rat, may be ^onsecrated: and whatsoever they
shall ^lesse, may be blessed, and sanctified in ^he name of our Lord Jesus
Christ, ^^ is finished ^e s^all take the patten with the host, and Chal^^e
with the wine, and shall give it (...) saying. ^ake yea power, to offer
Sacrifice to God, and say mass as well for the living, a^ ^r the dead in the
name of our Lord. ^his is the most ancient Pontifical which ^tiquitie has
preserved, and del^^ered unto ^ uniformly agreeing with the now used
^ntificall in the Roman Church which dif^eth not from, but ag^eath with the
most ^ntient Manuscript Copies and Examplare ^tant in the most renowned
Labraries. And ^erefore our old British Antiquities deliver Manus^^ antiq. and
Cap^^ in (...). Histor. (...). Arthur*dip^. ap^^ Came. and ^.
for a received Tradition and custom here, in other places for the Priests
thereof ac^^ding to their Office and Consecration, to ^er Sacrifice both for
the living and the dead, ^t consuetudo, tam pro vi^^, qu^^ defunctis ho^ D^o
immolare. And this was so general a ^^ued truth, and custom in the whole ^^ch
from the Apostles time, and Tradition. ^^ them* that is was, and justly,
adjudged Heresy (the Protestants thus acknowleging,) ^ngl. Protest. in Field.

Church of Christ, ^^ was (...) ^o ^^emned So S. Epiphanius, S. Augustine,
Isodorus, Dama^c^nus, and others demonstrate*

10. And for England where holy Priests an^ Priest^ood are so grievously
persecuted, w^ thus suc^^ss^uely and without any Interrupti^ deduce it in a^^
times and changes to the^ days. Saint Peter a massing Priest, Bishop^ and
Apostle preaching, and consecrati^^ Priests, and Bishops here could consecrat
a^^ ordain no others, but such as were to be ^ his own Order. So Saint
C^ement his confe^sed massing, and Sacri^icing Sucessor, dircted to se^d such
into these parts. Pope Ele^^herius who by his holy Mission of Prie^ and Bishops
hither, converted this kingdom, being also a Massing Priest and Pop^ could
send no other P^^ests, but such. And ^ Churches and sacrificing Massing Altars
e^ct^d in them all to such use, and end, con^sed by all wri^ers Ca^holi^s, and
Protesta^ do so demonstrate. All agree we ^ad q^i^ ^essesse (...) Relig^^ and
agreeme^^ (...) until D^ocl^lian his Persecution, when ^^o^g others
pers^^u^^ed, the holy Pr^^^ Massin^ Pri^sts (as Saint Gildas before ^^ proved
and others (...)) (...) Electi Sacerdotes trucidati: and they which escaped,
did as often as they could sai^ Mass, in places whether they fled to escape
da^^ger, as in Scotland, whether the Persecution did not come, ^t not being
under the Romans. We had many Massing Priests as Saint Amph^labus* ^odocus,
Priseus, Calanus, Ferranus, Am^ianus, Carno^us, ^d others who ^^^ed thith^^ ^ut
of our Britanie, now England, and were maintained by king* Crath^^^^en to ^a^e
Mass, ^ho founded all things, necessary to such ^urpose, Churches, Altars,
Chal^^^, P^^ens, ^adlesticks, and all things else. Se^ Crathlint^us ^ex, sacram

11. Britanie after this until the Pelagian ^^resi^ was quiet for Religion,
and the^ ^^pe Caelestine, who was so ^arre a Massing ^pe and Priest, that
although the Mass wa^ ^pisticall before (as he Protestants acknow^lge) yet he
added the Introi^^, Graduall, ^sponsorie, Tract and O^^e^torie unto it,
strictly commanding, that Priests should know the Popes ^ano^ ad ^e sent such

2. That S. German* S. Lupus, S. Seue^^, S. Paladius, and all th^se which S.
Ce^^ne that Massing Pop^ s^nt hither into Br^^^ie were Massing Bishops and
Priests, as al^^ that were co^s^crated by the^, is confes^ by all. We have the
most worthy wi^^^e of our old B^^tish antiquities written ^ut 1000* years
since, entitled even by ^estants glosses, Prima ^nstituti^ and varu^as
^siasti^^ seruitij. The first Institution and var^etie ^^^ch s^ru^ce. The Mass
and public offic^ which in the time of S. German, S. Lupus, and S. Patricke,
was by the^, and others used in Britanie, Scotland, and Ireland, was the ^ame,
which was composed by Saint Mark the Evangelist. And thus it continued here so
long as the Britans ruled, and after they were expelled by the Saxons, with the
which remained in wales ad Cornwall, and the^ Scots and Irish. All our
Archbishops both o^ London, York, and Ca^rlegion, Theonus* Dubriti^s, Sampson,
David, and the res^ with all Bishops and Priests under them were sacrificing
and Massing Priests: Altars for Mass were in all Churches, and one t^^ the
sacrifice of Christ's body and blood was offered in Mass. All which appears
in ^ann^ histories, and their destruction by the Paga^ Saxons in all Churches
does witness it. Eccl^^ and Ecclesiastica omnia ad solu^ vs^ destrueba^^,
Sacerd^^es iuxta a^iaria trucidaba^t. They destroyed even to ^^ ground the
C^urc^es and all Ecclesiastical t^ings, the ^illed the Priests at the Al^ars.
Such were the Pr^lats, Bishops, Priests, Abbots, and their Se^^ Monasteries*
and Churches, where Ma^^ was used in great number and aboundanc^ in every age
^y the ^rotestants confession ^o. Go^^olin. histor. Eccles. Matthew. Parker

13. And among the Saxons, the first Christian Priests that were permitted
here, were Massing Priests; their Sacrifice, was the sacrifice of Mass, their
Church at Canterbury had Altars, and Saint Le^hard the Bishop, (which came
hither with the F^enth Catho^ike Christian Lady Queen Bertha, married ^o the
Saxon king Ethe^bert of kent,) and the Priests with him, were all Massing
Priests, and ^aied Mass in that Church allotted to the^ to that end. In
antiquissima sancti P^aesulis Mar^in^ Ecclesia sub vrbe sua beato Pontisi^e
Lethard^ praesi^ente, frequentabat Regina Missarum and Ora^io^um ^acra, cum
suorum co^itum samili^ Christian^: ^^ the ancient Church of Saint M^rtin
citu^^d near unto the city, Lethardus the Bishop gouer^ng it, the Queen wi^h
her Christian samil^^ heard ^asse frequently. This was diverse years before
^aint Greg^ri^ (that most holy and ^^arned ^ope, Gregori^s magnus Romanus
omnium ^ontisi^m Romanorum doctrine and vita pr^stantissimu^: ^egorie the
great a Roman, the worthiest of ad the ^oman Bishops in doctrine and life, As
Protestants ^le him) sent Saint Augustine with his holy ^mpanie hither: and
king Ethelbert as these ^otestants say by the persuasion of Queen ^rtha his
wise and her Clergy received the ^ole Roman Religion: Conu^rsus vxoris Ber^
persuasione Ethelberius Rex Romanismum susce^. And Saint Augustine brought in
among ^her things, Altars, holy vestiments, and ^ssel^, Relics, books of
Ceremonies, the Sacrafice of Mass, and in a Council assembled, commanded the
Roman customs to be observed every where. Introduxit Altaria, vestimenta, Vasa
sacra, Reliquias, and Ceremoniarum codices. Prinum little Studium erat cir^a
Missarum oblationes, Seeds ^piscopal^^, ac de^imas, and coacta Syno do,
ma^dauit Romanas v^iq* c^s^ctu^in^s s^ruari. And the Mass which S. Augustin^
brought hither from ^. G^ego^ie was the same which S. Grego^^e and the Roman
Church then used, and the present R^man Church and Catholike^ of England do
use at this time, and the very same which was in use before Saint Gregory* He
only add^^^ unto it, as the Protestants them^elues confess ^ew things not
questione^ by them, as (...): Lord have m^^^ie upon ^^ to be diverse times
^^i^erated which they confess the Greek Church d^d use long before. He added
also Di^sque ^ostros in ^ua pace di^^onas: And d^spose our dai^s in thy peace,
And command, we ^e delivered from everlasting damnation, and numbered in the
s^ock of thy elect^ But the Protestants allow and use all these, a^ also (where
they sa^e he hadded) Alleluia some times to be used, (it being used in
Scripture* and the saying or singing our Lords praye^ Pater noster ordained by
Christ, and by Protestants confess^o^ used in Mass in the Apostle^ time. S.

pe^al^ies, punishments, and pe^s^^uciors* as ^hey name long suffered and now
full ^oe ^nd^^e ^or exe^cising their most honourabl^ Functi^* ^n offering their
most divine Sacri^i^e instituted by Christ, offered by him, his ^oly Apostles,
and in all Ages after, in this so approved and received Order and form o^
Mass, until it was first here disallowed by king Edward 6 a child, and made
so penal by Queens Elizabeth's strange proceedings in such affairs. For king
Henry 8. though otherwise a most strange Enemy to Christ's ^oly Church, yet
concerning Massing Priests an^ Mass, he ordained by his last will and
Testament, as is still to be seen (Mass^^) That they should continue in
England to the and of the worl^ willing and charging Prince Edward his son,
a^ his Executors, all his heirs and Successors, the should be kings of this
Realm, ^s they will answer before almighty God, at the dreadful day of
Judgment that they and every of the^ drese^ it performed. Neithe^ ever was
there in England before that yo^ kings time, or in any other nation (when
Protestant Communion has in these their late days opposed against Catholic
Religion, Priests, and Mass) any other Church service, but Catholic Mass and
Sacri^ie^ found, heard off, or remembered in Antiquities.

14. Therefore seeing the honor and dignity of holy Priesthood, in the
respect o^ the most sacred and heavenly oblation, an^ Sacrifice, it offers
unto God omnipotent the highest king, and king of kings, of hea^ and the
universal created, for the living an^ deceased, is most certainly and without
a doubt or question, so great and glorious, ^^ dare not least we should be
Traitors ^^ God, harken unto the^, but lament their doleful estate, who
declare and persecute it, as a traitorous estate to Princes on earth, which
should subject their wills and laws to the will and law of God, reverence and
honor, and not so v^ly use, his dearest servants: for as Justin* Dial. cu^
^riphon.

Chrysostom) principatus est ipso etiam regno venerabilius ac maius.
Priesthood is a principality greater and worthier then a Kin^ome it self.
Protestats before by public, regal, and all power they contend to have
declared that these, Priests were ever in Christ's Church, and were evermore
had in reverent estimation. To which they add of Priesthood with like
allowance: It is a power, which no Prince or Potentate, King or Caesar on earth
can give. By blessing visible elements, it makes them invisible grace. It has
to dispose of that ^^esh, which was given for the life of the world, and that
blood, which was powered out to redeem f^^^es. To these Persons God imparteth
power over his mystical body, which is the society of souls, and over that
natural, which is himself, a work, which antiquity calls the making of
Christ's body.

15. And this will be sufficient, to excuse sacred Sacrificing Priests
pe^secuted for justice, and la^e the guilt and offense upon their unjust
Accusers and Persecutours. For besides this most honorable sacrificing office,
and ministering to the sick (in danger to die) the Sacrament of Ext^^me
unction, delivered in holy Scripture, and ever used ^n the Church of Christ,
and Protestants never question it, a^ a matter of State, there is nothing in
Priestly O^der, but these men in some sense or other would have used by ther^
Ministers* who use preaching, baptizing, marriage even of themselves, forgiving
of sins in personal absolution* even without any penance at all, ^^ther by

Our Lord Jesus Christ, who has lef^ power in ^is Church to al solue all
s^^ners, which truly rep^nt and believe i^ him, of his great mercy forgive
thee thine offenses: and by his authority committed to me, I absol^e thee from
all thy s^nnes in the name of the Father, and of the son, and of the holy
ghost. Am^n, All this is, or should be used by Protestant Ministers, by their
most public, Rega^l. Parlame^tall, and what^oeuer autho^itie their Religion is
set out, and supported by So not only permitting, tollerating, and allowing,
but directing, and commaund^ng to be done and practiced, much more then any
Priest presumes or Pope licencet^, o^ ever licenced to be used or attempted,
yea more the^ any Papal power can so warrant* no penance enjoined, how many or

Injuries, damages, and wrongs were. Felonyes Rebellions, Treasons and all
things else how vile soever they be are quitted and freed both by ministerial
and legal allonance, and are so judged and ended, as if they had been not the
least punishable offense.

16. We must free Catholic Priests, and all others of their Religion from such
presumption, practice, consenting unto, or approving sin. No absolution
without penance and satisfaction with us. And yet we with the Church of Christ
and holy Fathers say of holy Priesthood even in this respect: Ne mihi

not to me of these things, bu^ if thou will see the power given to them both,
thou shall see the Priest sitting much higher in ^ig^itie the^ the King. The
throne of a King is chosen for the administration of earthly things: neither
has he any other authority besides this: but to a Priest a throne is placed
in heaven* and he has authority to judge of heavenly business. who says
this? The King of heauen^ himself. Whatsoever ye shall and upon earth shall

head, thea^hing us, that this Prince greater the^ that. The thron^, power,
authority and dignity of Priests is above Regal, this ^leth only in things
temporal, the Priest ^ heavenly. The king of heaven has given his power to
his Priests and has subjected ^e Regal head to the hands of the Priests,
^eclaring unto us that this is a greater Prince ^en he. Neither has he given
such power unto ^ngels or Archangels as to Pri^sts* Sa^erdotib^^ ^^um est, vt

For it is not ^ed to them: Whatsoever you shall bind upon earth, ^all be bound

heaven. The power ^f binding which is in Princes, is only over ^odies, that of
Priests over souls, and exten^eth to heaven Habent and terrestres Principes

^^o Sacordotum vinculum ipsam e^iam animam con^ngitatque ad coelos vsque
peruadit. Terreane Princes ^lso have the power of fetters, but of the body
only: ^ut that which I say, the bonds of Priests touches the ^ule it self,
and passes unto the heavens. This is the doctrine delivered by Christ, so
exp^^nded both by the Gr^^ke and ^^^ine Church, in Britani^ and all places with
all persons, all good Emperors* Kings, and Prince^ of England* and which the
whole Christian world have ever prof^ssed and declared.

17. And the world will witness every where against persecuting England that
the Cath^lik^ P^iest, and Clergy thereof, be as le^^ned ^^ly, religious, and
as sa^^ f^^m exception, and eue^ have been since they were persecuted ^^mber

18. Their Religion under pre^en^e where^f they are presecuted, they have of^e^

consequently, (as they which tak^ upon them to be teachers, instructours, and

utterly disabling themselves therein are bound,) A Priest or Bishop that
says Ma^se, absolueth penitents, or reconci^eth men to the Catholic faith*
by power authority, or Jurisdiction from Rome is no more guilty, of so ^ermed

lover of Englan^ should think or wish it a thing so penal an^ capital for
any Inhabita^t of England or English man to be borne, abid or remain in hi^

renowned Clergy Priests, ^ memorable books and writings of very ^y of them in
defense of Catholic Reli^n, there honor thereby registered among ^ must worthy

I am an unworthy witness, ^ many older, and of more frequent conuersa^ with
Priests then I, can better testify that ^hin 25 years of the Reign of Queen
E^beth, when so many from our Seminaries ^ come hither, that at one time there
were ^ of them Prisoners in the Marshallea, and ^y of them put to death. There
were then ^y of Queen Mary's Priests deprived and ^secuted by Queen

their number and join with them, as ^ers published books, from them, their
petitions and challendges of d^sputatio^ bo^ in the Marshal sea and Tower, and
their cofuting and confounding their Protestant auersaries do sufficiently
^estifie.

20. W^ may take some proportion of the labors and wor^hinesse ^ere, if we

read^ ^ Protestant Historical relations, Ca^d^ Howes, Stowe and others, they
will s^e w^ Policy was used to put down Cathol^ Religion, and by the^ it
will also appear how ^^tholike Cou^cellours were ^^moued Cathol^ Judges,
Sherifes, Justices of peace and oth^^ were displaced, and Protestants put in t^
places, five now Protestant Lords made, i^ ^ounties Protestant B^^gesses
chosen for ^rlament; Plures e Protestantibu^ data opera, e ^nitatibus tum e
^iuitatib^^, and Burgis fuisse electos: any of the Protestants of set purpose
were chosen one (...) Counties as well out of Cities, as Towns. And though the
Ca^holike Bishops were also ^cluded from that Parliament, that so Pro^tant
Religion might be the more easily es^lished by Parliament, yet the P^o^estant
^tie exceeded only in Six voices, the Ca^olikes, who there prof^s^ed
themselves to ^uch, and all for the most part of them for ^ong time remained
so. The Queen her^e openly then in that Parliament protested, ^^ ^he would
never vex or trouble the Roman Ca^ikes, concerning any difference in Religion.
^ough we found and felt since how far ^he ^ altered from this the^ her
intetion ad deternatio^. What I have said is found to be true all the opinion^
of friends and adversaries.

21. And this sufficiently argues a true, ^st lawful, and never defective
known suc^ion of worthy and learned Priests of the ^ular Clergy, who
defended in all times ^holy cause of God in this our Country, ^ conserved
still the Catholic Religion in hearts of the Nobility, gentry and others ^ll
so^ts. No Order of the Religious can ^ so. The Jesuits came first of all the
Reli^us hither, but they were not hear before. ^ went away again, not
returning of some ^res. The Dominica^s and Franciscans came ^er before the

Petition t^ Parlame^t for Catholics: Against whom, a cert^ Benedictine Moncke
in his prefatorie Ep^ to Saint Augustins Meditations, Soliloq^ and Manual
translated by him into Eng^ writes: I here never has been any Interrup^
Benedictine Preachers and Teachers in England ^ to prove this his assertion,
he recites ^ly three such Mon^kes* Abbot Fecknam* a^ Moncke (to use his word^,
whole name was ^rie Style as I take it.) Who though bli^ body yet clear
sighted in mind in the Ch^^^ Westminster publi^ly and ^^outely confuted in an
^ none Sermon, a precedent rail^ng Sermon ^ D. Horn by appointment of the
Council s^^ in the ears of the people to disgrace the profes^^ Monckes, and
Catholic Religion, and D. S^^ Buckly: and he seems to be offend^d ^ the
foresaied Author of the Plea, as thoug^ had done wrong to their Order in
supp^sing D. Abbot Fecknam his nam^ say ^e might have remembered the famous and
^^ ^ Abbot Fecknam. But a^as this is far from accusing truly that Author, or
excusing himself, or proving what he said before. For that Author in that very
book makes twice an honorable memory of that noble Abbot, in one pl^ce
setting down to his honor the Orat^^^ he made in the first Parliament of Q.
Elizabeth in defense of Religion. And that Author of the Plea was so far and
^till is, from being otherwise then a lo^ing friend and no enemy to the Order
of ^aint Benedict, that in the time of Q. Eliza^eth before any Monckes came
hither. He ^rote in honor thereof in his Apology for Catholics to the
Council of Q. Elizabeth Apolog. ^p^st ^o Q Elizab Councall prius. an. 601. page
83.
^ these words, The only order of Saint Benedict, so ^nowned in our Nation,
has had about twenti^ kings ^d Emperors, above an hundred gr^^t Princes, many
^opes, sixteen hund^ed Archbishops, 4000. Bishops, ^000. famous men, and
15600. most honorable ca^nised Saints. Thus far ran his pen with ^eir
Moncke and most commender Trithe^ius.

22. When the first Moncks from Spain ^me hither about the death of Q
Elizabeth, ^d had no Faculties, this Author at the re^iest of one of them his
dear fr^e^d, wrote ef^ctually to the then Archpriest Master ^ack well, to
give them ordinary Faculties, which he did, and these were the first Facul^s,
that Congregation in my memory (as ^e Moncks themselves confessed) had in
England until more ample were afterward and otherwise procured unto them. And
that Author has ever lived ingreat peace, love, unity, and concord with all
the worthiest o^ that, and other Orders of his acquaintance* but to that
excepting Moncke he ^as no^ known. And now at this time and (...) afte^ both
that Author, and I that write as his an^ their loving friend, will be so far
from being an enemy unto the Moncks of Saint Ben^dicts Order, that except their
auntien^ learned Moncks Historians and such as the^ account most favoring to
their Order i^ matter of History shall offend and be again^ them, of this
time, we will not offend the^ bringing nothing but from these men the^ selves
and such. But yet that assertion, T^ there never has been any Interruption of
Benedi^^^ Preachers, and teachers in England, cannot be s^ by Moncks, and this
Moncks own conf^sion For if it had been a thing lawful for Moncke or any
Cathol^ke to go twice ^^ day to a Protestant Church, where once ^ go i^
d^mnable, such a Moncke could not ^ a tru^ Preacher and Catholic, otherwise a^
learned man under pretente to confute Pro^stants by word or writing, might go
to the^ Churches, and deliver themselves from p^^alties. Further this Moncke as
they confe^ went soon after out of England, and died ^ of ^t. Abbot Fecknam by
Moncks, and ^ d^ed in the year 1585. And then by ^^ Monckes and all men's
confession, there lived here in England of the old English Monks only F.
Buckley no great Preacher or learned man So this only such Moncke could not
ab^e that proposition: There n^^er has been any Interruption of Benedictine
Preachers and tea^^e^^ in England. One no Preacher cannot be such, and in the
plural number.

23. And that Author made no more men^ion in particular of Benedictine Moncks,
^hen of other Religious Orders, all o^ them ^ailing in learned Priests, except
of ^he Cler^ie to ^heach and defend true R^^igion. He ^id not mean, there was
not any one either ^earned or unlearned. If any such thing is ^here printed, it
was the printers and not his ^oing: neither can any of equa^l Judgment ^inke
otherwise, for that author well k^ew ^at Father Sebert Buckley was the^
liuin^, he ^eing well and very lovingly acquain^e^ with ^aister Sadler, and
master Mahu Priests which first joined with that F. Buckley, hea^ng from them
the manner thereof. And he ^ath seen under one of their han^s, more ^en ever
he wrote or held: That it was ^oubted whether that father Buckley was a
^rofessed Moncke or no: and the reasons of ^ch doubt are thus set down,
written with ^ne of their hands Quia hoc neque per scripturam, ^e publicum
Instrumentum, neque per testem, quirem ^sam nouerat probatum vidit: Because he
had no^ ^ne this proved by writing, or pu^like Instrument, nor witness that
knew it. This is more then my friend needs in this matter, or this case now
requires. And he ever thought he was a Monk. So do I, and honor the Order
of S. Benedict and all other Religious Orders, and love and honor all my
worthy friends and acquaintance of them, as much as ever I did, which some of
them know to be very much, and as they can wish or desire, and ever shall: yet,
verita^ vincit.

THE VII. CHAPTER.
That the Catholics of England taugh^ and directed by such guides in Religion
as our Priests be, are not to be persecuted but protected, defended and
employed, as true and faithful subiect^ in all things.

1. THe honor, dignity, glory, and renown of consecrated Bishops, an^
Priests, being thus great, ample, excellent an^ necessary among all true
believing Christian^ Instituted and ordained by Christ himself a^^ according to
his own most holy Order, for all professors of his faith and Religion in a^
and places, until this life and world is to end: and that the publik Sacrifice
they offer and celebrate, is so holy, and heavenly, the Religion generally
which they profess, preach, and ^eache undoubtedly true and that the highest
spiritual power by which their Mission is so certain, so a^ntiently
honorable, and honored, and without manifest and inexcusable offense both to
the greatest authority on earth, or in heaven so to be received, and
reuereuced of all* twyce happy, blessed and honorable is then your state,
cause and condition, Most Noble, and Renowned Confessors of the Nobility,
Gentry, and other Catholic laietie, of England, in chosing in such times,
such guides of your souls, professing such Religion, and, which gives you a
second, and greater felicity, to be for such a cause so persecuted in your
Native Country, of your own Countriemen, kindred and called Christians.

2. To suffer Persecution for Justice is a blessedness, and brings to
eternal bliss; But to endure it in such measure, and manner as you have done
and do, it will eleuate you ^o the highest and never fading joys; your ^osse
may be of temporary: but your pur^hase thereby will be of much better and ever
^uting things. Terreane glory, flattering and deceitful honor, is often
valued, bought, and sold, at too dear a rate, but that which Persecution for
the cause you suffer in, will for ever endowe you with, will far exceed the
worth of any price you can bestow to possess it. Id enim quod in praesenti
(says ^. ad Cor. 4.
Saint Paul) est momentaneum and leave tribulationis nostrae, supra modum in
sublimitate aeternum gloriae pondus operatur in nobis, non contemplantibus
nobis quae videntur, sed quae non videntur. Quae enim videntur, temporalia
sunt: quae autem non videntur, aeterna sunt: For that our tribulation which
presently is momentarie and light, works above measure exceedingly an
eternal weight of glory in us, we not considering the things that are seen,
but that are not seen. For things that be seen, are temporal: but those that
be not seen, are eternal. And c. 5.
in an other place he adds: Scimus enim quoniam si terrestris domus nostra
huius habitationis dissoluatur, quod aedificationem ex Deo habemus, domum ^on
manufactam aeternam in caelis: For we know that if our earthly house of this
habitation be dissolved, that we have a building of God, a house n^^ made with
hand, eternal in heaven. Your lives, your lands, your liberties, honors, and
what soever in things temporal, and to be forsaken, or spoiled and deprived
off, dear unto you, were lent, given and but for a time bestowed upon you, as
also his most precious blood and life was after many other Miseries sustained
for your Ransom, and Redemption, by him for whose right and cause you stand
and patiently endure afflictions for the same so often so much, and so long
time. Thus he himself found the way and returned to his own kingedome and
glory immense and eternal, and he said, at his departure hence to his
heavenly throane unto his blessed Apostles, Disciples, to you, and all that
shall serve, and suffer for him, to the end of the world. In domo Patris mei Io
1^.
mansiones multae sunt, vado parare vobis locum. Et ^^ abiero and praeparauero
vobis locum: iterum venio and accipiam vos ad meipsum vt vbi sum eg, and vos
sitis, Et quo ego vado scitis, and viam s^^^is: In my fathers house there be
many mansions: I go to prepa^e you a place* I come again and will take you to
my s^lf^, that where I am, you also may be. And wither I go you know, and the
way you know. Every Mansion in heaven in the house of God, far surpasses
all Palaces and pleasures of this world: and to be with Christ in eternal
glory, infinitely exceeds all delights and honors here. And the glory and
reward of them that come nearest to Christ in sufferings here, ^^ll be ^he
highest and greatest with him there in loyes for ever. Ecce Taberna^ulum Dei
cum hominibus, and Apo^al. ^1.
habitabit cum eis, and ipsi populus ^ius erunt, and ipse Deus cum eis, er^t
coru^ Deus. E^ absterget Deus omnem Lachrymam ab oculis eorum* and m^rs vltra
non erit neque luctus, neque clamor, neque dolor erit vltra, quae prima
abierunt: Behold the Tabernacle of God with men, and he will dw^ll with them.
And they shall be ^is people: and he God with them shall be their ^od. And God
shall wipe away all tears from their eyes: and death shall be no more, nor
mourning, nor crying neit^er shall there be sorrow any more, which first things
are gone. All you shall, or can give, or rather lend, for such a recompense of
sure Inheritance for ever, was given you by him, that, for but lending him the
same again for a time, will with so great honor return you all again y^a an
hundred for one. Omnis qui reliquerit domu^ velfra^^es aut sorores aut Patrem,
aut Matrem aut vxo^em, aut filios aut agros, propter nomen Matthew. 19.
meum: cen^^plum ac^^pi^t and vitam ^^ernam possidebit: Eu^ry one that ha^^
l^ft house, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother or wife, or childrne
or ^and^^ for my sake: shall ^e^eiue on hundre^ fold, and shall posses^ life
everlasting.

3. You that be great and Noble, and Noble Catho^^kes be not troubled ^or not
enjoying such ^^mpo^all and fading honors in Court or Country which your
equals or inferiors en^oye, (not being of your Religion, but rather
p^rsecuting it are exalted) or that you have lost or let any such, for this
holy cause. If there was danger you could not exercise ^uch without offense to
God, or hurting his S^ruants; it is your honor, and security in conscience to
want or loose them* Qui amat pericu^um in illo peribit. Coringrediens du^^

your comfort, that never had the, that if you had enjoyed such, you would, as
your holy Religion teaches you, have performed them to you* uttermost power,
to the honor of God, our king, and Country: as they which had and lately
lost them did, ever most faithful and dutiful to our king, in his commands,
and as ready as any Protestants, to do him all service and supplies they
could by themselves or other means they might, or were able to procure, and
more then diverse Protestants did well approve, or commend in them for such
duties, which all Catholics without exception generally, and upon all
occasions in their degree most readily, and willingly performed. Let it not be
a grief unto you, that you are driven out of Parlaments, whose chiefest and
only members you with the Catholic Bishops, and some privileged Abbots, were
with the kings of England, long before any house of Common^ was in power. Your
lawful and just refusal^ of an Oathe made, and, as it was expounded by king
James, by greatest spiritual power unlawful to be taken, gives you lawful
excuse from all assent to Acts of persecution, England ever was a noble Nation,
your Ancestors and of us all that be truly English, came by all Antiquities
from a most honorable people and progenitors. Saint Gregory the great so
called, and in great part our Apostle and Father in Christ, compared them not
only for name, but endowments of nature, unto Angels: and the lives and
conversation of many thousands of your holy Auncesters, (when England was holy
England) were Angelical: and you now with other Catholics made for profession
of your faith, a spectacle to the world Angels, and men, shall 1. Cor. 4.
be for your reward, thus perseuering, as Angels Matt. 22.
of God in heaven, sicut Angeli Dei in caelo. Your renowned Priests have given
you example in the highest degree of perfection in this kind and cause in
forsaking all at once, and with his Apostles following Christ, with an Ecce
reliquimus omnia and secuti sumus te: Behold we have Matt. 19.
l^f^ all things, and have followed thee; So deprived and persecuted only in
England, because we are Priests and borne in England. Be not afraid to follow
such guides, with some hazard, loss, or diminution of your honors, esteem
with carnal minds, Riches, and revenues for the like cause, and for that
you are Catholics of England. For others both Priests and Catholics not of
England, are otherwise entertained here in England, not only ^n times of
peace, but in times of open hostility between England and their Countries
from whence they are: of such by some, some Jealousy might be made; of English
Priests and Catholics, no possible place is left to invent the least
suspicion. Our Priests have so long and voluntarily professed poverty, and
lived therein, that no man of upright Judgment can think they would disorderly
or unjustly seek for Riches, with hazard of their friends. And if his Majesty
should allow to lay Catholics, which receive no spiritual good from
Protestant Ministers, to pay Tithes to others of their Religion, this would
not be offesiue to God, nor hinder, but rather further a noble great Nation,
having now more need of chaste then married of such sort.

5. If we had not preferred our love of England before all earthly things, no
doubt but both the Bishop of Calcedon, and diverse renowned Priests of England
might have found far greater amity, favor, and wordly preferment in other
parts, then they could ever expect or look for in their own Country. We
never had hand or singer in these late wars, and contenuons, or ever ^aue the
least occasion of any danger, difficulty, or hazard, our dearest Country is
subject or exposed unto, as diverse public Pro^lamations and other Protestant
Relation* publish. We never were of Counsel, or acquaintance, with any great
Counselor, o^ Courtier dead, or living full at this time, o^ any such, which
(as many Protestans or ^uritans have thought) did not good offi^^s to this
kingedome, We were, and are (...) to all me^ or women, Courtiers or others,
which have been suspected to have furthered the driving ^^ the French Bishop,
Priests, Ladies, and others from the Queen, and placed themselves ^^ ^riends
for them, the beginning of daba ewith France* We are as Innocent of the breath
with Spain, either Ma^^iage or peace, o^ with any other Prince. We have not
disturbed it, at ^ome or ab^oad. The rebellion of the Netherlanders*
Hungarians, Austrians, (...), Lu^atians, Sile^ians, Moranian^, French and
whatsoever Protestants against their Princes were by Protestants, not Catholics
allowing but always condemning them. As in England in all oppositions of
Parlamentarie Protestants against our king hindering or witholding duties from
him, even in his times of needs and wants, the Catholics ever yielded to, and
most readily performed all, allthough by Parliament they were charged with
double subsidies, without any freedom or release of any penalties for
Religion: All Priests of the Clergy, Bishop and others have utterly condemned
the deniers of rendering such duties unto our King, and have what they could
persuaded the Recusants (as the refusing Protestants were therein termed) to
perform such ^onds, true offices, and obligations of loving subjects. An^
although our Catholics hau^ ^^ne sundry waie^ greuiously persecuted for their
Religion: yet *as the world knows they have most dutifully, much above others
honored our king, supplied his wants with free, and lardge Donations, and
Contribu^ions, when their persecuting Protestants in great number, and of great
qua^itie made de^iall No man except maliciously and chridishly very falsely
imagining slanders, and ^ntruthes against the^, may surmise that these ^en can
be unmindful of the duty and obe^ience of true Subjects to their Sovereign.

6. If there be any either in Court or Country bearing the name Catholic,
gaining not loo^ng, rather honored then ^isgraced, preferred then persecuted)
gi^en to liberty and disorders, (such as this ^rotestant time can easily
bestow and ^are) and spiritual discipline may not be ^llowed to ke^pe such in
duty, o^ leave the ^ame Catholic, Catholic Rel^g^on does ^ot and cannot
answer, or make accomp^ ^or such* Commonly they be men risen o^ ^ell reared
up by fall of Religion, and Reli^ious howses, which complain most against
Catholics, who find pro^ects of sea^e, ^^a^ing to loose that, they so easily
g^t. B^t (...), there is no danger toward them by English Catholics, for many
or most o^ them that be landed me^, have also such land, They be not
Catholics, (which ever defend ^ld and vn^uersall Right) which a^e to be sea^ed
in Innouations: Nouelists and lovers of ^ingularities, are the most dangerous
in such respects. Catholics of England, of all subjects thereof, ever were and
now be most obseruant of, and keeping their Protestant Princes laws: seldom
is, or can a Catholic be charged with the breach of any, excep^ concerning
matters of Religion, where i^ breaks the law of God and his holy Catholic
Apostolic Church. To keep the law of the king of all kings, and his
kingedome, must not be termed or thought a breac^ and violating of the laws of
any priuat^ earthly king or kingedome, all which mu^ subject themselves to that
omnipotent king and his government. And to make all sure (...) Catholics
defense in this cause, we wi^ briefly examine all Articles now questione^
between Protestants of England and the^, an^ prove in many of these Artic^es
(as they a^ enacted by Protestants) that the Catholic doctrine is far more
agreeable and profitab^ for public peace, unity, obedience, an^ concord in a
good civil Monarchical an^ R^gall government, then that which Protestants
hold, and practice, and would for^^ Catholics unto; and not any one Article ^^
Catholic Religion, repugnant unto, or pre^udicing the Rule and government of a
mo^ worthy king in a noble Nation.

THE VIII. CHAPTER.
That every Article of Catholic Religion is more agreeable with the best
temporal government, then those of the Protestants; and that a Catholic
keeping his Religion, as he is bound to God, so he cannot be undutiful to his
temporal Prince and Country.

THe first five Articles of their Religion, (they consisting only of ^9. ^ade
by a few Protestants in f^^werth, or ^fth year of Queen Elizabeth the old age
^ this Religion) do contain nothing con^ouersed between them and us, but
were ^ade against new Sectaries so soon risen up among them. The Sixth and
next Article in^tuled, Of the sufficientie of the holy Scripture for ^luation,
Denies the use and necessities of ^raditions not written in Scripture, and
de^eth many books of holy Scripture to be ^ch, and some of them, as the book
of wise^ome, and of Jesus the son of Sirach, con^sting most of moral
precepts, and co^mandments (as all men know) are most needful^ in all
kingedomes for civil regiment. So tha^ whatsoever of this nature is contained
in these two morrall books and ten others which they likewise reject, or in
holy Apostolik^ Traditions, are wanting in these men, and the Catholics
embracing both those books an^ Tradi^io^s exceed them in all temporal
obedience and duty in this respect.

2. After this, until we come to their nint^ Article styled, Of original or
birth siane: they find no difference in this point. But in thi^ Article they
thus enact: There is no condemnation for them that believe, and are baptized:
By which allowance and Decree, the way to all disobedience, fellonies,
treasons, and sins whatsoever is set open to all Protestants, which say they
believe, and are baptized, and ^^ no Treason, Rebellion, contempt of government
can condemn them. Catholics be o^ the contrary profession. And this
Protestan^ liberty and dis^bedience is further warrante^ and allowed in the
next Article but one: (the immediate next Article after by their gloss^ not at
all or little differing ^ro^ Catholics*) For this their eleue^th Article
entitled of the Justification of man: Thus declares: That we are justify by
faith only, is a most wholesome doctrine, and very full of comfort* But this
is not very whole some comfortable, or secure for any king, kingdom,
commonwealth, that it should giu^ liberty to all offenses, not to be pu^ished
b^ God at all, nor by Prince if they can secretly be committed and concealed.
God forbid any bearing the name of of Catholic should ever hold or follow
such doctrine. And these Protestants Religion in the next Article of good
works, giving little or no efficacy unto them, will not hinder them in matter
of disobedience, to God or Prince. So does their 13. Article, wherein they
sa^e, that, works such as we commonly call among others, obedience to kings
and Rulers, good works, Done without the grace of Christ have the nature of
sin. By which if any man ^all into drunkennes^e, commit Adultery,
Fornication, Per^u^^e, or any mortal sin, which depriueth of grace, he may
or rather must make rebellion, commit ^reason, or whatsoever wickedness he
can, otherwise containing and abstaining from such horrible wickedness, such
his refrainings from those Impieties, have the nature of sin.

3. The 14. next Article against works of supererogation, brings into like
desperate^esse. Their 15. and 16. Articles have no pe^uliar difficulty. Their
17. next Article is entitled of Predestination and Election: And it delivers
plainly that their doctrine and Religion therein even, a^ it is received among
them, is so perilous a thing. That for curious and carnal persons, to have
continually before their eyes the sentence of Gods predestination, is a most
dangerous downesall, whereby the devil does thrust them into desperation, or
into rechlesnesse of most unclean living no less pevillous then desperation.
These Articles if w^ should go no further, are sufficient to diswade any man,
desiring to be a true subject to God and his Prince, from embracing the
Religion of Protestants. But to proceed to the end of them: the 18 next
Article, of obtaining eternal Salvation only by the name of Christ: has
nothing in question. The next 19. And the 20. Articles the first entitled, Of
^he Church: And the other, Of the authority of the Church: Are able to
destro^e all Obedience, Religion, and duty. either to God or man* for the
first defining to those of their Religion, and declaring that, The visible
Church of Christ is a Congregation of fait^full men, in the which the pure
word of God is preached and the Sacraments be duly ministered according to
Christ's ordinance, in all those things that of necessity are requisite to the
same. And making the Patriarchall Churches of Jerusalem, Alexandria, Antioche,
and Rome the chiefest commanding Churches, by which all others must be ruled,
and governed, and yet it is concluded of them all, that they Hau^ erred in
matters of faith. They take all true faith and Religion, (which of all things
must be most certain) out of the world. For no man will or can be of a
Religion, which is assuredly untrue, nor worship him for God, which will so
dece^^e us. And to no purpose to find truth, but to confirm Infidelity it
is said in the 20. Article; The Church has power and authority in
Controversies of faith: the Church is a witness and keeper of holy writ. For
if the highest Judge, witness and keeper of holy writ, and having authority
in Controversies of faith, being to be obeyed of all, may thus err, all men
should thereby be bound to such error, and eternally to be damned. No man would
be a Christian with such condition. No man is likely so to be a true subject:
for the certainty of Religion, which causes certainty of obedience and duty
to Princes, being taken away, the other will fail.

4. This they confirm in their 21. Article, Of the authority of general
Councels, making them though they represent the whole and vniuer^all Church, to
have no more power or certainetie. And if we should follow the Par^aments of
our Country, much unequal to ^he whole Churches Judgment, we should ^inde
that they have often and most inexcu^ably erred by their own Judgments and
confessions. And So the Conclusion may be ^uch as Athests and prophaine
contemners of Religion and all duty to God, Princes and others in authority,
use and practice. Their 22. Article entitled, Of Purgatory, denying the
^octrine of the Roman Church concerning ^urgatorie, Pardons, Images, Relics
and ^nuocation of Saints, must needs occasi^n ^ore neglect of good life and
duty, then the Catholic doctrine. For first the denial of Purgatory and
punishment for sin there after death, if it be joined with the Protestant
doctrine before, of sins forgiven by faith, and ministerial absolution from
all guilt or pain thereby, denying any te^porall pain to be inflicted for, or
due for sin, overthrows all penalties, penance or punishment, any
Consistory, civil or Ecclesiastical should inflict for any offense. For
where none is due, or to be done, in justice it may not be inflicted. And this
is more the^ any Pardons or Indulge^ce the Pope himself does give, or may use:
every pretended believer or Minister takes more authority upon him herein. No
use of holy Images or Reliks used by Catholics can be offensive in any
Commonwealth, but it rather teaches honor and duty, which the Protestant
opinion does not. He that will have or use respect, do honor or reverence to
the representing sign, or part of any* will rather do it to him they
represent, then he that denies it. And for honor to Saints, he that will not
honor them in heaven and glory, will sooner be unmindful of their duty to
persons which are to be honored on earth with terreane honor, then he that
honors and prays unto Saints in glory.

5. The next Articles 23. and 24. have little belonging to this purpose. Their
25. Article of Sacraments, saying they be Certain sure witnesses, and
effectual signs of grace, and Gods good will toward us, by which he dot^
work inuisibly in us. Of seven Sacraments, they only retain two, and the
first of the^ is Baptism, which they minister to infants. They leave here the
whole life of man, and all states without grace for their callings: They bar
the married, from the grace of wedlock or matrimony: Ecclesiastical persons,
from all grace in Orders: all that live, from the grace of Confirmation;
offenders, from grace by penance; Those that are sick, from the grace of
Extreme unction. And for the Lords supper, as they term their Communion,
holding that it does condemn and hurt those that be in sin, and never
ministering unto any but such as be of years subject to many sins, not taking
the^ away by any other Sacrament or means, this cannot give grace, but rather
damnation to the receivers, being in their own Judgment unworthy Receivers,
and receiving to their damnation, as they thus declare in their 29. Article.
The wicked allthough they do carnally and visibly press with their teeth the
Sacrament of the body and blood of Christ: yet in no wise are they partakers
of Christ, but rather to their condemnation, do eat and drink the sign or
Sacrament of so great a thing. When Catholics do not communicate but after
their sins be forgiven in the Sacrament of Penance, Confession, and
absolution of all sins. So that by this Article Protestants have no means to
take away any, but Original sin in In^an^s, none, for any actual sin, but
without all grace are left alone to all undutifulness, disobedience and other
sins, from which Catholics are by grace given in Sacraments preserved, and
made free, and abled to perform their duty to God, and their Princes.

6. The 26. Article has nothing belonging to this question: neither the 27.
Article following, of Baptism, has any thing needing examine in this matter.
Their 28. of the Supper of the Lord, denying Transsubstantiation and the Real
presence of Christ in the Eucharist, and consequently the reverence and honor
due thereunto, will not breed more honor to Princes on earth, they not having
more title the^ Christ, and by him, of honor. And they having before declared
that the Sacraments be effectual signs of grace, and here giving all
prerogative to Imagined faith, saying: The mean whereby the body of Christ is
received and eaten in the supper is faith, they attribute nothing to any sign
or Sacramental thing, and that Imaginatiue faith is a false faith. For except
as Catholics hold, Christ be truly present there, by the omnipotent promise,
word and work of God, it is impossible faith should be a mean to receive
Christ's body there. True faith is only of true, and not of false things. And
so again these men leave to themselves no Sacrament to give them grace in all
their course of life after Baptism, when they are infants, and so must needs
be disabled to serve God or their Prince as they should, and all men are bound
to do.

7. The 29. Article confirms this, as I have delivered before. And their 30.
Article, of both kinds by their doctrine attributing all to their Imagined
confuted false faith, confirms it also. And their assertion there, That the
Cupe by Christ's commandment ought to be ministered to all Christian men: Is
untrue by their own Parlaments, testifying that in the very Primative Church,
and allwaies it was often ministered in one kind only. Then no commandment of
Christ contrary, ca be brought to condemn all Churches, times and places for
such practice.

8. Their 31. Article, of the one oblation of Christ finished upon the cross,
deny^ng against the whole Church of Christ in all ages and places, and thereby
depriving God of all external sacrifice, contrary to scripture and all
authority, will not by the Rule of proportion give more, or so much honor
unto earthly kings then Cat^oliks do, giving this tribute and Sacrifice to
the king of heaven, and all that is belonging, or was ever given to their
terrene Princes.

9. Their 32. Artic^e, of the Marriage of Priests, has married this kingedome
to many miseries, it did not feel, or know before. The posterity proceeded by
such law, or allowa^ce, has brought us to number hundreds of thousands more,
then Britanie or England (if it had remained Catholic) should have ever seen.
Many thousands of these are left unprovided for, and not a few are turned, or
wrested out of their possessions to furnish these Ministers children, many of
whom also have fallen to such extreme wants that many of them have taken
desperate courses, which the Catholic practice and Religion would have
prevented.

10. Their 33. Article, Of excommunicate persons, how they are to be avoided:
Differs not from Catho^ikes, but that Protestants commit the business of
excommunication and absolution, to such as Catholics hold, have no power
therein: when both Catholics and Protestants confess, that men assigned to
such offices by Catholics have true, lawful and undoubted authority.

11. Their 34 Article, Of Traditions of the Church, is wholly Ceremonious by
their own exposition, and no man ca^ be so singular in this or any such
matter, but to think any particular Church or kingedome, the more it agrees
with the universal, or most flourishing Christian kingedomes to be more
honorable and secure thereby, then such as fall into Novelties, and
singularities.

12. Their 35. Article, of homelies, is nothing to this purpose. And their 36.
Article entitled, Of Consecration of Bi^hops and Ministers, To whom they
commit spiritual Business, preaching, ministering Sacraments, and to
excommunicate, absolve, and whatsoever in like kind they take upon them to
practice, is quite overthrown by themselves, before in their 22. Article,
where they say that Order, as they use it, Is no Sacrament or effectual sign
of grace, and has no^ any visible sign, or ceremony ordained of God. Then
not receiving or having grace, or such spiritual power, it cannot co^ferre and
give it unto others, or so exercise it, especially in so many things, as is
required, from truly and lawfully consecrated persons, such as they acknowledge
the Bishop^ and Priests of the Roman Church to be.

13. Their 37. Article entitled of the civil Magistrate, does give to
te^porall Princes supreamacie even in spiritual things, and denies all
Jurisdiction to the Pope of Rome in thi^ Realm in such affairs. Of this
sufficient is said before. And every equal minded man may easily see, whether
the temporal state of England was not more honorable, noble, powerful and
secure when the Popes Jurisdiction in spiritual things ruled here, then now
it is, and ever since it has been, and yet the Riches and wealth which fell
to our kings and Princes hands, and commau^de at such chang, were as infinite,
and so great, that king Henry 8 to have license or assent to suru^y them, to
make use thereby, promised (to speak in Protestant witnesses words) He would
create an^ maintain 40. Earls, 60. Barons, Edw. howes historical pref. in
Henr. ^.
three thousand knights, and forty thousand soldiers with skillful
Captains, and competent maintenance for t^em all for ever, ou^ of the auntie^t
Church revenues. Neither should the people be any more charged with loan,
Subfidies and Fifteenes. Since w^i^h time there ^au^ b^ene more statuts, laws,
subfidies and Fifteenes, then in five hundred years before. Thus in the
public Protestant History, in the year 1614. dedicated to our king now, the
Prince Charles. Since we have heard and tasted in England more matters of this
nature. And yet if we should make but Robin-hoods pen^worthes and estimate of
what has been taken away from holy constant Catholics, for pro^^ssing their
true and Apostolic Relig^^n, in the Reign o^ Queen Elizabeth, king James and
king Charles, even since he married a Queen, prosessing for herself Catholic
Religion, It will amount to more, then would have delivered a far^e meaner king
and kingedome, then ours of England have been^ accounted, from such complaints
of fears, wants, needs, dislikes, and varia^^^^ t^erein, if God had well
approved of such proceeding^, and such means of proceeding against his
Catholic Servants, our kings most faithful (...).

14. And the spiritual Supreamacie assumed by o^r Princes king Henry, 8. king
Edward, 6 and Queen Elizabeth, confirmed again in this Article, had wrought
so good effects in so short time, (within 4. years of Q. Elizabeth's obtaining
the Crown,) that Protestants in such order, or rather disorder and number
denied te^porall power in Princes here to put any Rebel, or whatsoever most
greeuious offender to death, and they went further affirming that Protestants
might not fight in defense of their Country, though the Prince commanded it:
whereupon they were enforced to declare in this Article, in this manner against
such Protestant Brethren: The laws of the Realm may punish Christian men with
death, for heinous and greuious offenses. Is it lawful for Christian men, at
the commaundment o^ the Magistrate, to wear Arms, and serve in the wars. And
there were among them teaching and holding community of goods, no^ theft,
spoiling, or Roberie to be punished, no justice or law to be executed, or Oath
to be taken in Judgment, all Courts and Consistories to cease, as is evident
by the two last Articles 38. and 39. thus following, the former entitled Of
Christian men's goods which are not common: And thus declaring: The Riches and
goods of Christians are not common, as touching the right Title and possession
of the same, as certain Anab^ptists, (Protestants) do beast. And the last ^9
Article entitled, of a Christian man's Oath: And thus enacting and declaring:
We Judge tha^ Christian Religion does not prohibit, but that a man may swear,
when the Magistrate requires, in a cause of faith and charity, so it be done
according to the Prophets teaching in Justice, Judgment, and truth. This
suffi^^en^^y witnesses what goodly co^mon-wealths-me^ their Protestant
Religion, eu^n (...) Infancy thereof, had brought forth in this kingdom.

THE IX. CHAPTER.
That true and obedient Catholics, be the truest and most obedient subjects.

1. And in conclusion to come to the particulare S^ate and Regalitie o^ our
most honored King Charles, and king James before him. There never were any
Protestants in England in their times, or before, which so truly and ducifully
carried themselves, toward their Monarchical true Title, Right, and
Government, as generally Catholik^ ever have done, and will, as they are bound
by Religion to do. In the time of young king Edward 6. Cranmar and his
Protestant Accomplices by that young kings will, did their uttermost to
extinguish and overthrow it* Queen Mary and her Catholic Regiment did
nothing against it, but revived, preserved, and confirmed it. In the Protestant
reign of Q. Elizabeth, Statuts were made to avoid or hinder it. It was
enacted by Protestant Parliament. Capital to acknowledge it. Hales an Eng^ish
Protestant companion to the Scottish Knox, wrote a book expressly against the
Title of king Iame^ No Protestant answered, confuted or seemed to disalowe it.
Only Catholics, Sir Anthony Brown a Judge, Doctor Morga^ Doctor of
Divinity and Doctor Smith of the Civil law confuted it The death of that
glorious Catholic Queen Marie Grandmother to king Charles, and true Heir of
England was long sought, and after contrived, concluded, and executed by Queen
Elizabeth and her Protestants. Many worthy Catholics here for her cause lost
their lives, lands, and what they possessed. And all ge^rally for suspicion of
favoring her and king James his Title, and now of king Charles, were much
persecuted. Yet no Persecution could ever force us from that duty to lawful
Princes and their Temporal Titles, but we ever performed it, though with
danger: as we have, and do, our duty to God and the holy Church. No
Catholic Clergy man a^ any time impugned it.

2. William Bishop of Chaleedon, and Richard now his persecured Successor
maintained, proved and confirmed it. So have all Archpriests, Assistants, and
all in any authority among the Clergy either by opinion, word or writing. And
some of us that yet live and write, (I might here catch hold of my own pen
with others) have as expressly, plainly, and effectua^ly taught and published
it, as king Charles can desire. The Protestant writers of their great public
Theater of great Britanie, have not given so great allowance unto it. The Lord
Verulam in his history of king Henry 7. has not asscribed too much; a good
Catholic writer would have g^uen more, unto it.

3. And to pu^ all out of doubt or question in this business because P^^e^ts
and Catholics are charged so much, for adhearing to Papal power: in this they
are assuredly known to be the truest Subjects to our king. For all Popes
actually* or virtually, (in never approving or legittimating Queen Elizabeth)
have ratified and confirmed the just Right of Scotland in th^s kingedome and
Ireland. And nothing can be said to be more authentically approu^d* and
confirmed by Popes authority, then Pope Innocentius 8. by his Papal Bull, (as
our Protestants confess, and relate Bulla Innocentij S. in ^^trim. Henrici
Regi^ Ang. 7. Ma^^^. Parker. Antiquit. Brit. in ^^. Merit.
it) confirmed both the marriadge of king Henry, 7. with Elizabeth daughter and
heir to king Edward, 4. and his most lawful and Just (...) to the Crown of
England. By all Titles and Rights, by Right of Inheritance, right of war,
right of marriage, right of Election, and right of Parliament by hi^ Pontisicall
power. Pa^^ ad confirmandum illud legitimum diuinitusque conciliatum, ac ad
pacem, and tranquillitatem Anglorum maxim necessarium Matrimoniu^, suis Bullis
opus esse putauit, quia quarto cognationis gradu coniuncti nuptias
contraxerunt. In quibus etiam ne authoritate carere videretur, regnum
acquisitum Rege^ confirmauit, illudque iure hareditario, Iure belli, iure
coniugali, Iure elec^^onis. Iure Senatus seu Parliamenti Anglicani, necnon Iure
Pontificio atque suo ad Henritum Regem septimum, eiusque Haredes in perpe^^^^
spectare debere pronuntiauit: The Pope though^ i^ needful by his Bulls to
confirm that godly reconciled Marriage, most n^^^ssarie for the peace and
tranquillity of English men, for that they ^ad married in the sowerth degree.
In which also, least it may seem to want authority, ^e confirmed the obtained
kingdom on the king, and declared it to appertain perpetually to king Henry
the 7. and his heirs by ^^^editarie right, by right of war, by right of
Marriage, by righ^ of election, by right of the Coun^ell o^ Engli^^ Parliament,
by Pontifical, and his own right. This is so constringent and bind^ng an
obligation of all English Catholics, (attributing so much to Papal power and
Iu^i^diction, as Protestants say we do, ever to perform all temporal duty
and obedience to our king Charles, the undoubted true lawful He^re of that so
established king Hery^^ to him and his heirs for ever) that no Catholic man,
allowing of Papal authority can ever be justly suspected of disobedience or
undutifulness to our Sovereign. And all the Protestants of ^ngland in their
Religion, cannot produce such a bond, testimony, or warrant for their like
fidelity.

4. Therefore being thus clearly and manifestly made known, and evident, that
the Religion of English Catholics in every point is most true, and holy,
plensing to God, and profitable in temporal Regiment the sacred Orders of our
Bishop and Priest so honorable, we hope our king and hi^ Council hereafter
will rather think of defending then offending, protecting then persecuting K.
Charles Declaration to all Subjects An. 1628.
them. And besides that is here said his own Regal declaration published
with advise of his Council, calls upon him and them so to do. For there,
with that advise h^ thus publikly protests, before God and m^ We ^all God to
record, before who^ we stand^, that it ^ and always has b^ne our hearts
desire, ^o be foun^ worthy of that Title, which we account the most glorious,
in all our Crown, Defendor of the says*

5. We must m^st humbly remember unto him the says, whereof he is ^^ilc^^
Defender wherein there is so much glo^^e^ it is tha^ only true says of
Ca^^o^iks, as is here proved, and no other: true faith being but one ^ Ephesians 4.
Vnus Dominus, vna sides, vnum baptis^a. One Lord one faith, one Baptism. And
this faith of Catholics of Eng^and is the true Catholic, Apostolik faith, and
says of the Church of Rom^ now, and when that Title, Defendor of ^^ faith was
given to king Henry the 8. before his lapse from the Church of Rome, by the
Pope there, for defending that faith against Luther. The Title given must be
interpreted by the giver the Pope, not the receiver, which could not receive,
but what was given. And this Title was given, received, and used, many years
before Queen Elizabeth, or before her Religion, the Religion of English
Protestants now was borne, and was used both by king Henry 8. and Queen Mary,
not of this new Religion: wherefore we hope our king calling God to Record will
rather defend the faith of his Catholics, and them, then to suffer them to be
thus persecuted; and his Council which counseled him in that declaration,
will so advise and counsel him* And his Parliament, that could not find their
Religion 80. years old, will not hinder him in so good a deed, seeing it is
certain by their own account, that the Title, Defendor of the faith, is about
30. years older then their Religion, and so he cannot by that Title defend
their faith. A non ens can have no defense* It can neither be defended or
offended.
