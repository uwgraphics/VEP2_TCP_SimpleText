A DECLARATION of the just causes of his Majesty's proceeding against those
Ministers, who are now lying in prison, attainted of high treason.
AS his Majesty's fatherly care has ever been so great toward his people and
loving Subjects, as he has not only been careful to govern them by just and
aequitable Laws, but likewise has ever had a special respect to the true and
right information of their minds as touching all his public Actions and
proceedings: So for this purpose he has ever from time to time by public
Declaration and Proclamation interpreted and explained to all his loving
Subjects his true intention and sincerity of his meaning, that thereby his
Subjects knowledge of his will, and of the grounds moving him thereunto, being
joined to their duetifull and natural inclination of obedience, a reverent
love together with a fear to offend, might be continually increased and
nourished in their hearts, their obedience not proceeding of a naked fear, but
from a fear mixed and strengthened with love for good reasons, and founded
upon a good conscience and clear knowledge of the truth.

And as this his Majesty's fatherly care has ever since his maioritie of
years most clearly appeared in all the points of his Highness government in
this his kingdom of Scotland: So now upon that late occasion of the Rebellious
and traitorous misbehauiour of some particular Ministers within this Kingdom,
his Majesty continuing his former loving custom toward his Subjects, has
thought convenient to set out this present declaration for satisfaction of his
Highness Subjects of all ranks, concerning his Majesty's course and
proceedings in this case.

And because he has just reason to conceive, that if any of whatsoever estate
or degree of his Majesty's Subjects be so undutiful, as to have any scruple
of the Justice and necessity of his Highness proceedings herein, it does
only proceed of ignorance or mistaking the truth of his Highness actions:
His Majesty is therefore moved to think that there can be no so good and sure
way for true information of all his Subjects, as to set down unto them the
true state of the question, together with all that has followed and risen
thereupon, The mistaking whereof (his Majesty does assure himself) is the
only cause from whence all scruples in some men's hearts (if any be) do spring
and proceed.

His Majesty for the three or four last years together before his departure
out of this Kingdom, being carried with a most ardent Zeal and earnest
Affection to the advancement of Gods glory and establishing of the Religion
presently professed, never spared to undergo in his own most Royal and sacred
Person almost intolerable pains and fashery for preventing of all disorders
and corruptions which crept into the Church, and for setting down and
establishing such a solid and comely form of government as might be able to
preserve the purity of our Profession, and procure the establishing of a
solid Peace and quietness in the Church. And for that cause he was ever
present at all the frequent Meetings and Assemblies of the Ministry in this
kingdom. And if his Majesty's affairs and other incident occasions had been
such as he could not be able to keep the appointed place and diet to the
which he had called the assembly, his Highness did ever carefully prorogate
and continue it, to such other time and place as his leisure might permit him
to be present at the said meeting. And as his Majesty by those his traueils
had already put this our Church in a good beginning and forwardness of a good
order and frame: so he no way doubts, but if he had made any longer stay
amongst us, he would with Gods assistance have brought it by this time to a
reasonable and expected perfection. But such is the malicious envy of the evil
disposed sort, grudging at the progress of any good matter, that some of those
Ministers who ever had been hinderers and crossers of that good work as far
as they durst, even in his Majesty's own presence, conceyting with themselves,
that now in his Highness absence from this Country (with whom they supposed
all memory and regard both of Church and Common wealth had been altogether
forgotten and neglected) and that by reason of the assignment of a day in the
month of July last past, for keeping of an assembly (betwixt the appointment
whereof and the time it self, interuened that most happy and necessary cause
of his Highness going into England) they thought a very fit occasion was offered
to them for prosequution of their intentions. And therefore they endeavored, to
the uttermost of their power, to reuerse and overthrow all those good orders
and godly Constitutions formerly concluded for keeping of good order in their
Church, And partly by secret suggestion of false calumnies to the simple and
ignorant, and by plotting and combination with those of more turbulent spirits,
who knowing that their own inhabilitie would impede them to be any way
preferred, made choice with the Camel to drink in muddy water, and by
perturbing of matters rather to overthrow all good order, then that by settling
of the Church-gouernment, the virtues of others, and their vices and
imperfections should be clearly discovered and distinguished.

Therefore to assure themselves the better of the compassing of this their
desseigne, they spared no time, nor left no mean unassayed to preoccupy men's
opinions, to anticipate their votes, and to make up a strong Faction against
the meeting of that assembly, thereby fully intending to bring the estate of
this Church to a most evident confusion and disorder.

Upon some notice of the which mischievous Plots and Machinations, his Majesty
considering, that his absence from that future meeting of Assembly, and the
near approaching of the time appointed for keeping thereof were embraced by
those turbulent spirits as fit opportunities and good occasions offered unto
them so to overrule that matter by thus preparing and packing up of Votes
beforehand, that howsoever the better sort should oppose themselves thereunto,
yet they should be sure to make the estate of this Church without any rule at
all: And therefore his most excellent Majesty continuing in that fatherly care
which he ever carried to this Church and Realm, by his Highness Letter signed
with his own hand, directed to the Commissioners of the general Assembly,
signified unto them his special Pleasure and will, That that meeting and
assembly appointed to have been the second of July now last past, should be
deserted; and that no new Indiction should be made either of day or place
without his Majesty's consent. And thereafter he desired, that some of the
Bishops, and also some of the best, wisest, and most religious of the
Ministry, should repair toward his Majesty with all convenient speed, That
his Highness with their advice might not only resolve upon all such grounds
as were fittest and most expedient for the settling of the Peace of the Church,
but might also appoint some fit and convenient day and place for holding of a
new Assembly. Upon the receipt of the which Letter, the said Commissioners of
the Assembly, by their Missiues directed unto all the Presbyteries of the
Kingdom, certified them of his Majesty's pleasure and will, concerning the
deserting of that Meeting; Willing them that they should not in any case send
their Commissioners to keep that day formerly appointed, and now by his
Majesty's warrant deserted, but that they should expect the appointing of a new
day and place for keeping of an Assembly. But so far were some of the
Ministry from making any account of his Majesty's directions (a thing most
detestable in any subject, much more in any of the Ministry, whose Doctrine,
Life, and whole Actions ought to be Lanternes to others of all dutiful
obedience to their Prince) as by the contrary, in plain contempt thereof, most
seditiously they conuened at Aberdene. And being guilty to themselves of their
own inhabilitie, unworthiness, and small gifts, conjoined with a bad
inclination, they being in despair that in doing good they should ever become
memorable, and ouerruled with a burning desire of vain glory, resolved by
overthrowing the government of this Church, and by inducing all disorder
thereinto, to make themselves (at least for their evil) famous with that
sometime burner of the Temple at Ephesus. And howsoever the advertisement of
his Majesty's Pleasure and will for the deserting of the said Assembly sent by
the Commissioners, was dutifully received and willingly obeyed by the whole
Presbyteries almost of this Kingdom; Yet some few Ministers (not exceeding
the number of eighteen or ninteene persons at most, ouer-ruling the rest of
their poor brethren of their eight or nine several Presbyteries, over whom,
by reason of their said brethrens simplicity, and their own craftiness, they
had got in time past very much advantage, and had them in a manner tied to
their girdles to consent to any thing whatsoever) so brought it to pass, as by
their procurement, the Declaration of his Majesty's pleasure was contemned, and
they themselves chosen Commissioners to that Meeting, which by his Highness
commandment was deserted.

And we of his Majesty's Counsel fearing that the presumption of these few
(howsoever in words professing, yet in their deeds directly impugning his
Majesty's Authority Royal, under a colored pretext of their zeal to
Religion, which alas is now most detestably abused as an ordinary cover and
excuse for every treason and trespass) thus conuening without regard of his
Majesty's command made to the contrary, might be a dangerous preparatiue to the
whole Estate, considering that those who should be the teachers of others, were
now become the only violators of their obedience to their most gracious and
religious Sovereign: Therefore we directed Sir Alexander Strayton of
Lawrenston Knight to the said Borough of Aberdene, with special warrant and
commandment to prohibit and discharge that few number of Ministers from
conuening at all; and also by a special Missiue written unto them, we
signified his Majesty's pleasure concerning the deserting of that Diet.
Notwithstanding the publication of which charge at the Market Cross of
Aberdene the day before their meeting, they being all in Town, and of the
delivery of our Letter; the next day thereafter they being all conuened, were
so far from carrying any respect to the charge which was directed and executed
in his Majesty's name, or to the Missiue sent from us, or to the bearer being
his Majesty's Commissioner in Church affairs; as the first being contemned
directly, the Letter was superficially answered, and the bearer (whose presence
at all their doings was ordinarily most necessary) was nevertheless at this
time excluded forth of doors all the time of their keeping that Assembly till
the end thereof.

A particular relation of all which circumstances being faithfully made to his
Majesty, his Highness took occasion with his own hand to pen a Declaration,
whereby not only all pretext of excuse or defense which may be pretended by
these Ministers is clearly refuted, but also their proud contempt and
disobedience is made so manifest, as we do fully assure our selves, no scruple
of doubt will remain with any who is not peruersly preoccupyed to distrust all
verity.

The Declaration we have presumed to insert in this place, as it came from his
Majesty himself, and is this.

BEcause this unruly handful of Ministers that made the fashion of keeping of
this pretended Assembly, together with their Associates and Allowers, do so
much brag of the equity of their cause, and wilfully maintain that the
ground of their proceedings was most just and necessary, and if any error was
therein, it was only in form, which proceeded out of necessity, in respect
of the unlawful restraint of their liberty, as they allege: we have herefore
thought good to set down most succinctly and shortly the vine Anatomy of
their actions, and the true state of their cause; to the intent that power
being joined to reason (as ever has been our constant form of proceeding) in
all our government, their nakedness being truly discovered, the due
punishment to be inflicted upon them may the better appear in their own
color as well as their transgression. And therefore whereas they brag of
warrant of conscience, warrant of law, the due observation of their own
customs and liberties, and the respect of the weal of the Church, as the true
Motives of this their unruly and seditious contempt; The contrary of all these
shall be made clearly to appear.

And first for warrant of conscience for their general Assembly, which they
term the Counsel of God, in the whole old Testament they will not claim to
any warrant of a general Assembly; And in the whole new Testament they can
allege no warrant for general Assemblies, but that conuention of the Apostles
at Jerusalem mentioned in the Acts of Apostles, which indeed was an universal
counsel of the whole Church, and no ways like to a particular Scots general
Assembly: and therefore they must leave the Scripture, and have recourse to
the example of the Primitive Church for warrant of particular National
Counsels, To which warrant we are assured that they will be ashamed to claim,
in regard many Rites and Ceremonies, such as Vestiments, Cross and
Confirmation, will be found in the same Primitive Church which they do utterly
abhor. And since the Emperors (how soon they became Christians) had the
only undoubted authority in their persons of conuening general Counsels,
which never was taken from them while the Pope ascended to the height of his
abominations; how much less ought that authority be denied to a Christian
Monarch in the assembling of a National Council of his own Subjects, who
has far greater and iuster Dominion over his own people, then any usurping
Emperor could claim over the face of the whole Earth? And if they will
allege the new purest writers of our days, professors of our Religion, That
by their missiue Letter both to the Prince, and State of the Church of
Scotland, they have wished the holding of frequent Assemblies in that Country
(but always by the kings permission) as a mean whereby both doctrine and
discipline might be maintained without disturbance, and much good thereby
procured in the Church of God; yet these very arguments of theirs do declare,
that they only persuade it by way of advise as a thing very convenient, and
did not set it down as a rule of necessity and an infallible law.

Next as to the warrant of our Law in that kingdom, It is first to be generally
observed, that no privilege that any King gives to one particular body or
state within the kingdom of conuening and consulting among themselves, is to
be understood to be Privative given unto them, and so the King thereby
depriving himself of his own power and prerogative, but only to be given
Cumulatiue unto them (as the Lawyers call it) without any way denuding the King
of his own power and authority. As for an instance (which has been too
frequent in all this I Will these years past, saving the pleasure of God) Every
Burgh Regal have their own times of public mercates allowed unto them by the
Law, and the Kings privilege: but when the plague happened in any of these
towns, did not we by proclamation discharge the holding of the mercate at that
time for fear of infection, and yet thereby did no prejudice to their
privileges, neither did any of them ineptly murmr, much less enter into
that high contempt as to say they would obey the Kings Laws in keeping their
privileges, and not the particular restraint thereof at that time for
necessary causes?

And as to the nature of their particular privilege in holding of assemblies,
they have in this their last pretended Assembly broken the limitations of that
privilege that is clearly set down in the first Act of the Parliament, in
the 92. year, which is the latest and clearest warrant for their Assembly.
For there it is specially provided, That as we give them license for holding
of their Assemblies once in the year or ofter as occasion shall require,
(which proves that all their power only proceeds from us) So must it not be
conuened without our own presence or then of our Commissioner, nor no day nor
place set down for the next Assembly but by Our or our Commissioners
appointment, except we be not pleased neither to go in our own person,
neither to send any for assisting the said Assembly. And how these limitations
have been observed by them at this time, let the world judge, first in not
only refusing the presence of our Commissioner, but most contemptuously and
injuriously barring the door upon him, and next in setting down the diet of
the next Assembly, without either his priuitie or consent.

And as to the third point of their justifying themselves by the warrant of the
constitution and custom of their own Church, we would know what warrant they
have for holding of a new assembly without the presence either of the moderator
of the last; or of the ordinary clarke of the assembly; The Clark specially at
that instant being dwelling in the same town where they conuened. For their
custom has ever been, that the moderator should call for all the
Commissioners name by name, should see their commissions from their
Presbytery, should give them the lytis for election of a new moderator, and
make their names (the parties being removed) freely to be voted among them; but
first of all the moderator ought to preach unto them, and out of the word of
God teach them their duty at that meeting. But as this their pretended
Assembly was kept in contempt of our authority royal: So had it (praised be
God) no beginning at the word of God, without the which order in their
proceeding, we would know what might let as many sundry general Assemblies to
be conuened at one time in diverse places of that country, as there are
several numbers of ninteene ministers through the country: And so there
should be at one instant far more general Assemblies in Scotland one against
another, then ever there was Popes in one time in our adversary Church. And if
they would allege that the straitness of these evil days (wherein they
live) compelled them to omit diverse of their ancient and lowable customs,
that cannot but imply a direct accusation of our tyranny, for which this
answer may suffice, That besides our known sincerity in religion and
constant love to do Justice to all our people: They can never allege that they
did so much as to send a petition either to our self, or in respect of our
absence to our Counsel there, for permission of this Assembly. For whereas
they allege that this day was continued by us and the Commissioners of the
Church without affixing a new diet; we think the least they could have done,
had been humbly to have craved the appointing of a new diet, and patiently to
have expected either our answer or our Counsels thereupon, rather then by this
their outrageous contempt to have proclaimed either our unjust persecution of
them, or else (which is the truth) their arrogant and seditious disobedience.

And lastly, how carefully they respected the weal of their Church in this
course, it is manifest to the world: First, by needless irritating against
them their ancient, lawful, religious and most merciful King, whereas they
might have come to their own end by their mild behavior and due obedience.
And next by making as needless a separation betwixt all the rest of their
learned, wise, grave and duetifull brethren, and them, who for their parts are
in this case according to their quality as far lightlied and disgraced by
them, as we are disobeyed. And thirdly, by bringing on a public scandal
hereby upon their profession, as rebellious to so religious and just a King,
whereby the adversaries of our religion (who like roaring Lions go about to
watch such opportunities) may fill their new books and pamphlets with such
scandalous memorials against our religion. And lastly, what charity they have
by this their behavior used toward their puritan brethren in this country,
they themselves may easily guess, having by this their contempt done nothing
else, but animated and spurred us to the straiter animaduersion and order
taking with them; lest otherwise, as they are both favorers of one discipline,
so they may some day by their example (if they had as great liberty) give
proof of their like disobedience and contempt of our authority.

NOw leaving it to every one to observe both the Patience and Piety of a most
puissant Prince; His Patience, that after so great a contempt committed by so
mean, base, and abject persons, who were never any way remarkable as men of
great gifts, but were specially noted of too great a desire to be made famous,
if by no other means, yet at least by their troubling and ouerturning of
matters: And although his Majesty had most just cause of offense against some
of them for their great oversight in former time, and that others of them had
most undutifully in that same action made breach of some promises made by them
unrequired, to his Majesty himself very few months before: Yet so
superabundant was his lenity and patience toward them, that after the
committing of the contempt, they were not committed presently, but suffered to
stay at home at their own houses: neither were they presently brought to
their answer; but his Majesty most patiently in hope of their repentance was
pleased a long time to supersede the ordinary course of Law against them. And
herewithall his Majesty's Piety does most clearly shine, that being even
since his infancy a most gracious nurse-father of the Religion professed, and
protector of the professors, but specially of the Teachers of the same; And
notwithstanding that the contempt committed was so heinous, as by the ordinary
course of Justice, his Majesty might presently have bin avenged of those
disdainers of his Authority and Royal commandments: yet so far was his
Majesty from any rigorous proceeding against them, as by the contrary, to the
intent to recall them back, who were now so far astray out of the pathway of
obedience, (a most pitiful, yea a most abominable thing in a Minister) it
pleased his sacred Majesty most graciously of himself to set down that
former Declaration, that upon the view thereof, these Ministers might see their
offense, confess their guiltiness, and crave pardon. Wherein howsoever some
of them were ever all their life, and likewise at this time so rammage, that
they could not be recalled by any lure; yet were six or seven of that number
of nineteen which first conuened, so moved and touched with that open
Discovery made by that Declarator, of their oversight, as in all humility
before the Lords of his Majesty's Council then present, protesting their great
sorrow for their offense, excusing themselves upon their ignorance, and purging
themselves of all wilfulness in that action, they besought their Lordships to
be mediators at his Majesty's hands for a pardon to them. Who presently upon
their humble submission (according as his Majesty had been pleased to
signify his will and mind to his Council) were dismissed, and sent home to
their houses to attend their charge and ministry over their own flocks. So
far was his Majesty's heart from intending any rigor against any of that
Profession, as by the contrary, by his Majesty's present pardoning of them
upon their submission, it does manifestly appear that his Highness was far
more willing and ready to embrace their penitence with clemency, then they
could be capable to deserve the same; imitating herein his great King the king
of all kings, who never desires the death, but the amendment of the sinner.
And yet it is most true, that those so dismissed upon their humble submission
and repentance, were men of no less gifts, but of far greater sincerity,
known good life and conversation, and nothing inferior to those others which
remain still obstinate, but in unquietness of spirit, hautinesse of mind,
and desire of breaking the Peace of the Church. But before any further be
touched of their conuenting before any Judge, or that any relation be made how
by their pertinacie of maintaining the first fault (being a most presumptuous
riot) they came next within the compass of no less offense then Treason: it
is not unmeet that the very point of their first crime, for which they were
brought in question, to answer before his Majesty's Counsel, were clearly set
down, as well to refute those vain subterfuges of excuses and pretexts they
make for their obstinacy, as to remove from the godly, religious, and well
disposed Subjects, all scruple of any such matter whereof those ministers and
their favorites by lying rumors would sow the seeds amongst the simple sort,
whom they very well know, and we often find to be too credulous of every
false report.

As therefore the keeping of a general Assembly was not the matter in
question: so is it of verity, that by this accusation against these
disobedient ministers, there was nothing laid to their charge concerning the
lawfulness or unlawfulness of a general Assembly, nor yet of the power and
limits thereof; but that they had unlawfully made a privy Conuenticle, not
only directly repugnant and against his Majesty and Counsels charges and
direction, but even as well against the continual custom and practice of the
Church, as their present consent which was well witnessed by all the
Presbyteries, abstaining from directing any Commissioners thither, saving that
small number of Presbyteries already recited, whereof they were the
Commissioners, for they not only disobeyed his Majesty's Authority, who had
discharged that time and place of meetings, but even the will and direction of
their own Church, whose disassenting to their proceeding, was not only
manifested by the Commissioners of the general Assemblies letter, certifying
all the Presbyteries of the deserting of the said Assembly, but also the Church
did by their not sending of Commissioners to that diet, clearly demonstrate
their obedient acknowledgement and acquiescing to his Majesty's will in that
behalf, of whose power and lawful Authority in appointing or continuing the
times and places of meeting of Assemblies they never doubted, being so often
practiced, (as is already rehearsed) in his Majesty's own person, and declared
to be his prerogative by that same Act of Parliament by which they are
warranted to keep the said Assemblies. And if those Ministers who stand so
obstinate in defense of the assembly (which they must confess has only
warrant from that Statute in 92.) would consider how far the Prince may
dispose of the meetings of the Parliament it self, as either to prolong,
hasten or desert the meeting thereof; and being conuened, may dismiss the
same without doing any thing at all therein; What foolish prerogative and
supereminence is this (seeing they must needs acknowledge themselves
subalteme) which they would claim above the most supreme, high and Honorable
meeting of the whole Kingdom? except it be, as so many Popes in their own
conceit, they would exemps themselves altogether from all Saeculart power. And
so the particular cause whereupon these Ministers were conuented before us, was
nothing else, but that they most seditiously, contemptuously, and in plain
disdain of his Majesty's Princely commandments and auctority Royal, did
conuene themselves in a privy conuenticle, which they (wronging not only his
Majesty but the Church, as is already declared) prowdly, seditiously, and most
falsely termed and maintain to be a general assembly, notwithstanding of his
Highness pleasure and will signified to them and their Presbyteries by
missiues from the Commissioners of the general assembly, that the meeting
appointed at Aberdene should desert; And notwithstanding of the prohibition by
public Proclamation at the Mercate cross of Aberdene, and of our Letter sent
unto them by the said Sir Alexander Strayton.

And how unlawful and undutiful their pretended excuses are, being grounded
as they allege, upon the fear which they conceived of the suppressing of
their assemblies, and overthrow of their discipline by the deserting of that
assembly once appointed, let the world judge; since not only his Majesty's
zeal and care for the maintenance of the Religion is well known to all men,
but even in special his great love to this people, in not intending to lay
upon them any new forms or ceremonies, is well manifested of late, by that
Proclamation which his Majesty has caused to be published for clearing of all
such doubts out of his peoples heart: The tenor whereof follows.

WHereas we have ever since it pleased God to establish us in the Imperial
Crown of great Britain, equally regarded the good of both the late Kingdoms
of Scotland and England, now happily united in our royal person in one
Monarchy, ever minding to maintain and continue the good and lowable customs
and Laws whereby each of them has been these many ages so worthily governed:
nevertheless some malicious spirits, enemies to that common tranquillity so
much desired by us (forgetting the many proofs both public and private,
which we have given of that our gracious affection to that our native and
ancient country of North Britain, of the freedom, liberty and privileges
whereof we have at all occasions taken so special a patrociny, as the solemn
assemblies of the Estates of South-Britaine, and Commissioners from the Estates
of both Kingdoms have been eye witnesses) have not been ashamed to labor to
pervert the minds of our best affected Subjects, That whereas the insolent and
factious carriage of some of them has merited most severe animaduersion, the
would insinuate themselves in the commiseration of the multitude, by assuming
unto them a glorious profession of the maintayning of the Privileges and
auctorised Discipline, intended by us (as they affirm) to be utterly
overthrown by a sudden and unseasonable laying upon them at this present the
Rites, Ceremonies, and whole Ecclesiastical order established in the Church of
this part of our Kingdom of Britain. And as we have ever carefully regarded
how convenient it is to maintain every Country in that form of government
which is fittest and can best agree with the constitution thereof, and how
dangerous alterations are without good advice and mature deliberation, and that
even in matters of order of the Church, in some small Islands under our
Dominions, we have abstained from suffering any alteration: So doubt we not,
but our good Subjects will never be that credulous contrary to the known
truth, which has ever appeared clearly in all our Actions, as to be in any
doubt, but as in all our proccedings we have been a Patron of Religion and
Justice (two inseparable conseruers of all Monarchies,) So has all our study
and care ever been to retrench and reform all courses that carried any
prejudice to that integrity whereat we have ever aimed, and as by so many
good Laws set forth in our government, Justice has attained to another
perfection and splendour, then it had in any our predecessors times, and with
painful and unpleasant business, we have in the discipline of the Church
taken away innumerable abuses and corruptions, which if they had not been
remedied, had brought the purity of Religion in extreme danger. Yet we hope
that none dare be so impudent as to affirm that by our Sovereign power, or
absolute commandment we did the same (although we enjoyed our authority a
freely as any King or Monarch of the world) but as the disease of the Civil
body was ever cured by the advice of our three Estates, So the defects of the
Church by the help and counsel of those who had greatest interest in them, So
as the presumption of our bygone actions in our administration, whiles we were
present, the proof of our fatherly care toward that part of our Kingdom
since our residence here, may be sufficient to secure us against all such
malicious calumniations. And how ever in rule of policy we cannot but judge
it convenient that two Estates so inseparably conjoined, should be drawn to as
great conformity in all things as the good of both may permit; And that no
Monarchy either in Civil or Ecclesiastical policy has yet attained to that
perfection, that it needs no reformation, or that infinite occasions may not
arise whereupon wise Princes will foresee for the benefit of their States, just
cause of alteration: Yet are we and have ever been resolved, not to make any
sudden or hasty change in the government of that part of our Kingdom, either
Civil or Ecclesiastical, but with grave advice and consent of our Estates,
and the wisest and best sort of them whom it most properly concerns, much less
to trouble them with any unnecessary alteration of indifferent and Ceremonial
matters, and that upon such foreseen advantages, and prevention of confusion
and evil to come, as the greatest enemies of all Peace, obedience to Princes,
and order in all governments shall not obtrude any inconvenient to the
contrary. And as by Gods holy assistance, we have drawn that part of our
Kingdom out of infinite troubles, factions, and cruel barbarities, and
reduced the uttermost borders and confines thereof to Gods obedience, and
acknowledging of our Laws; (an Estate never heard of before, since this Island
has been inhabited) So by the same divine providence and our fatherly care
over the whole Island, we intend to transmit the same in good order, happy
quietness, and flourishing policy to that posterity wherewith God has
blessed us, and after them to the worlds end; Like as for the more verification
of our Honorable intention, and to stop the mouths of these unquiet spirits,
raysors of that false scandal of alteration, We have appointed a general
assembly to be holden at Dundee the last Tuesday of July, whereat we expect
reparation of those disorders in so far as belongs to their censure, and to
be freed in time coming of all such calumnies.

Given at our Honor of Hampton Court the xxvj. day of September 1605. years,
In the third year of our reign of Great Britain, France and Ireland.
AFter the publication and imprinting of which Proclamation for indiction of a
new assembly, it being still hoped by us that those Ministers remaining in
Ward, upon the sight of their own offenses, with repentance for the same,
should humbly have besought his Majesty for pardon; yet did their obstinacy
still continue, justifying all their proceedings, as if they had committed no
crime at all. Whereupon we of his Majesty's Counsel, fearing the imputation
of undutiful and vndiligent servants, if by this our procrastination (upon
vain hopes) of the trial of their offense, we should leave it under the
hazard of every ones censure to be judged by the multitude, according as their
particular conceits should lead them; It was therefore thought meet to call
them to their answer before us, for that their most seditious, proud and
contemptuous disobedience to his Majesty's commandment and prohibition. Being
called upon and all present, and enquired what defense they would make for
themselves, either to justify or excuse that their intolerable riot and
contempt, first by speech, and then by writ they gave in the declinator
following, as disclayming themselves altogether from any subjection to his
Majesty, and his Counsel, making all their actions of whatsoever sort (by
their own interpretation) to be mere Spiritual, and that their meeting the
second of July last at the Borough of Aberdene, was such an essential
Ecclesiastical matter, warranted by Gods word, that therein they did no
offense. And if any they had done, the Counsel of any secular Prince was no
way to judge them, but their own assembly. A most lewd and vain position; It
being a certain and infallible Maxim in the Law, that their answer could not
exceed the limits of the Libell and accusation: And therefore they being only
accused at that time for such a private and unlawful misdemeanour, their
declinator could not but directly deny his Majesty's authority in that
particular point. Whereof we have likewise set down the tenor.

MY Lords of secret Counsel; Pleases your Lordships, The approbation or
disallowance of a general Assembly, has been, and should be a matter and
cause Spiritual, and always cognosced and judged by the Church, as Judges
competent within this Realm. And seeing we are called before your Lordships
to hear and see it be found and declared, That we have very contemptuously
and seditiously conuened and assembled our selves in a general Assembly at
Abeirdein the first Tewsday of July last, and therefore the said Assembly, and
approbation thereof decerned and declared to be unlawful, as at more length
is contained in the summonds executed against us thereanent; We in
consideration of the premises, and other reasons to be given by us, have just
cause to decline your Lordships judgment, as no ways competent in the cause
above specified. And by these presents we simpliciter decline the same, Seeing
we are most willing to submit our selves to the trial of the general
Assembly only Judge competent. By these presents Subscribed with our hands as
follows, At Edinburgh the 24. day of October, the year of God 1605. years,
Sic subscribitur: M. John Forbes, M. John Welsche, M. Ion Monro, M. Androe
Duncane, M Alexander Stranchane, M. James Greig, M. William Forbes, M. Robert
Yongston, M. Nathan Inglis, M. Charles Ferme, M. James Irwing, M. John Scharp,
M. Robert Durie, John Rosse.

THis Declinator being repelled, and they having used some other frivolous
defenses with more loss of time then uttering of any matter, at last all being
repelled, they were found to have conuened most unlawfully contrary to his
Majesty's warrant and charge given to the contrary. And being returned to their
several prisons, upon advertisement given to his Majesty of the whole
proceedings in that Process before the Counsel, and of that proud presumption
of those ministers in propounding the said Declinator, without any respect to
that Act of Parliament made in Maij 1584. or any pain which they incurred by
doing thereof (which was, That any persons either Spiritual or Temporal
presuming to decline the Judgment of his Majesty and his Counsel in any
matter whatsoever, shall incur the pain of Treason) therefore his Majesty
presently sent his Royal direction to his Counsel, that the ordinary course
of Justice according to the Laws of this his Highness Realm, should proceed
against those ministers, who by the propounding of that Declinature had made a
plain denial of their subjection to his Majesty, and of his Royal power and
Authority over them. Whereupon six of them being then in prison within the
Castle of Black-nesse, were upon the tenth of January last brought to his
Majesty's Borough of Lynlithgrw, and there presented upon panel before his
Highness Justice being the ordinary Judge of all matters Criminal, who had
joined to him a great number of Noblemen and others of his Majesty's Counsel
by his Highness Commission to assist the said Justice in that matter. And
their Indictment being grounded upon that first Statute made in Maij 1584. and
upon that their presumptuous Fact in declining the Counsels judgment when they
were first brought to their answer, they were then demanded what they could
say for themselves before the matter should pass to the trial of a Jury. And
notwithstanding that some of their own brethren, upon earnest request to the
Counsel having obtained License and permission to confer with them and
persuade them to an humble submission and penitence; as likewise that their two
principal Procurators and Counselors at Law not being able to persuade them
to this same course of humility wherein they dealt with them earnestly, did
upon their obstinacy directly refuse to plead for them; and lastly
notwithstanding that they were publicly admonished by the Judge the very time
of their standing at the Bar, that putting off that mask ot wilfulness (the
only thing which so blinded them from sight of their own follies) they would
humbly crave his Majesty's pardon, of whose great Clemency, in case of their
submission, all that were present, had very great hopes and uttered great
assurances: Yet such was their malignant and indurate obstinacy, as hardening
their hearts against all these public and private persuasions and
admonitions, they wilfully persisted in justifying their Actions; Having still
the assistance of so many Counselors at Law as would stay with them: and the
only thing they could allege for themselves why they should not go to the
trial of an Assise, was, that the said Statute of Maij 1584. was thereafter
interpreted and limited by a particular clause of a Statute made in 1592.
wherein it is declared that the said Act made in 1584. against the declyning of
the Counsels judgment, shall no way be prejudicial nor derogate any thing to
the privileges which God has given to the Spiritual office-bearers in the
Church, concerning heads of Religion, matters of Heresy, Excommunication,
collation or deprivation of Ministers, or any such like essential Censures,
specially grounded, and having the warrant of the word of God. And herein they
do allege that their meeting at that time in Aberdene being an essential
censure, warranted by Gods word, they might lawfully decline the Counsels
judgment from taking cognition therein.

Whereunto it was answered by his Majesty's Advocate of that his Highness
Kingdom, That that their defense was to be repelled, because the keeping of an
Assembly at a certain time and place, and the appointing of another assembly
of new, contrary to his Majesty's charge, and against the will and command of
his Highness Counsel of this Kingdom, and notwithstanding of the
disassenting of his Majesty's Commissioner; much less the keeping of that
petty Conuenticle in the town of Aberdene that second of July last past, is
not any head of Religion, matter of Heresy, Excommunication or essential
Censure whatsoever; and so being no way under that limitation, must of all
necessity come under the generality of the former Statute in the 84. and they
must have incurred the pain of Treason for declining the Counsels Judgment,
being called to their answer upon their contempt. And likewise in that same
very clause of interpretation of the former Act, howeuer it is declared that
the said Statute shall no way make derogation to the Privilege that the office
bearers in the Church have given them concerning Religion, Heresy and other
Ecclesiastical censures (wherein his Majesty will be ever far from the
assuming unto himself any Papal and tyrannical Authority over the express
word of God) Yet does not that clause infer such a Privative of his
Majesty's Souereigntie, as may denude him of that lawful power which Christian
Kings have over the Churches that are within their dominions. The matter going
to the trial of an Assise, these six are found guilty of high treason, and
returned to their several prisons. And therefore as hereby this proud contempt
and disobedience of this small handful of ministry (to the very great grief
and sorrow of all the well disposed of that profession in this kingdom) is
clearly and truly set down (that the ignorance thereof should not be the
occasion of mistaking by any, of the most just and necessary causes enforcing
this hard proceeding against them) so are the said wilful and obstinate
persons to be left to their just punishment for their deserts, whereunto they
have most contentiously constrained his Majesty, and in a manner extorted the
same against his will.

And nevertheless since there is no contempt whatsoever, but has the own
favorers, no folly but by some patronised and allowed, and that upon vain
curiosity (notwithstanding of their knowledge to the contrary) some will not
stick to maintain Paradoxes and defend absurdities, which (howsoever in
matters frivolous and of no moment might be ouerslipt and not regarded) yet in
such matters concerning his Majesty's royal Authority, and the excusing or
justifying of high and proud contempts by any sort or rank of persons, so
far should we of his Highness counsel (in our duty and allegiance to our
Prince and Sovereign) be from any sort of carelessness or negligence, as
hereby we have thought meet to signify his Majesty's special pleasure and
will, that he does straightly command and charge all his Highness subjects of
this his Kingdom (of whatsoever rank, place, calling, function or condition
they be) that none of them presume to take upon them, either in public or
private, to murmr or call in question in any sort, this his Majesty's
prerogative, and authority Royal, or the lawfulnes of this proceeding against
the said Ministers, or any way to make constructions, or to mis-interprete that
act of Parliament of the year 1584. concerning the declining of his Majesty's
and his Counsels judgment, otherwise then the same is made clear and manifest
by this present decision of the Justice in the trial of the said Ministers,
with certification to them that shall contrauene the same, that they shall be
really punished in the quality of seditious persons, and wilful contemners of
his Majesty's most just and lawful government.

Given at Edinburgh the seventh day of March, Jn the third year of his
Majesty's reign of great Britain, France and Jreland. 1606.
