A Larume Belle for London, with a caveat or warning to England: also a
pitiful complaint of the penitente sinner, newly set for the by John Carre,
Citezein of London.

Imprinted at London, by Henry Kirckham, at the sign of the black Bole, at
the little North door of Poules. 1573.

FOR thee O London I lament,
And wring my hands with mourning chere
Because that thou will not repent,
Seeing thy destruction draws nere.
If it be true as scriptures tell:
Thy sins will sincke thee down to hell.
The vices which in thee are used,
To tedious are for me to tell:
Thy noble fame is sore abused,
By those which in thee now do dwell.
Whereby I see thy great decaie,
That God does threaten thee each day.
The vice of pride has taken such place,
That it can not be rooled out:
And has continued so long space,
That of Gods ire thou have no doubt.
And such a place pride does supply,
That from thee it will never fly.
For like a weed it up does spryng,
It is not set nor sown at all:
The which good herbs and fruictes will bring
Ere they be ripe unto a fall.
To cut it down it is no boot,
Except ye clean pluck up the root.
For where this weed does spring and grow
Good fruictes can not there prospere well:
Because that cruelnesse so does flow,
That verteous herbs it does excel.
Which weed we may compare to pride,
That causes virtue away to slide.
So likewise Pride in London now,
Does florishe in such goodly sort:
That they muent which way and how,
Thereby augmented it might be.
And nothing do regard at all,
That Pride in the end will have a fall.
Consider well that Pride has been,
The fall of many cities great:
And Sodom sonke for such like sin,
As sacred scriptures does repete.
Gomorrha eke came to decaie,
Because that Pride did bear the swaie.
And Alexandria in like case,
Which was a city strong and great:
Pride would not let them purchase gracer
Nor yet for mercy would entreat.
Because that Pride so much did flow,
It was destroyed and lies full low.
And Niniuie like cause I find,
In the end for Pride was clean destroyed,
For Pride so much did puff their mind,
That God was clean forgot and void.
In Pride so much they did delight,
That God the same destroyed quite.
Jerusalem that city strong,
Pride would not let them God to know,
In which Pride they contined long,
As Josephus the same does show.
Till Titus did destrote the same,
And did accuse their pride with shame.
Ensample take by noble Troie,
The like for pride was never seen:
With wars the Greeks did it destroy,
Both wall and house the threw down clean
Because that Pride did bear the swaie,
It came to ruin and decaie.
Therefore, O London, now take heed,
For thou wast called Troic sometime:
That such decaie does not proceed,
For to revenge of Pride the crime.
Therefore repent, from Pride refrain,
Lest as Troie did, thou feel some pain.
For God does threaten thy great fall,
By signs and tokens many ways:
The which unto thee happen shall,
Shortly Christ says, and that in few days,
Therefore his power divine to please,
Repent, his ire thou shall appease.
O London, thou have cause to weep,
For to consider thine estate:
Thou art in sin now drounde so deep,
That from hell mouth thou caust not escape.
Except repentance thou embrace,
At Gods hand thou shall find no grace.
To practice pride thou do delight,
And fond devises for to gain:
Which is esteemed all in Gods sight,
A thing most frivolous and vain.
Yet thou do seek the same to use,
Which does thy noble fame abuse.
Let this a reformation be,
For thee, that thou in time repent:
Whereby thou might have grace to flee,
From Pride, the Lords will to content.
Reuolue in mind what happen shall,
For Pride in the end will have a fall.
Finis.

A caveat or warnyng to England.
THe present plagues, that now we feel,
our joys deeth much incroche:
And fear of foreign foes besides,
who seek for to approach.
To work annoye to Britain soil,
but Jove be thankte therefore:
That has dislodgde the treasen now,
which Curia kept in store:
The hidden sparks have wind disperste,
the smoke has shown her fire:
And dristyng Yris has constrainde,
the furious flambes retire.
That long within Rammusius breaste,
in couerte close did lurk:
Pretending naught but Princes fall,
and Englandes woe to work.
For outward face may simple seem,
where savor does affecte:
And Wolf being cladde in Lambs arraie,
who can at first suspecte.
Till gredie jaws to work decaie,
of silly Lambs do thirste:
And does return to vomit old,
from whence he came at first.
But time has tried what colored craft,
simplicity long did cloak:
And rooted up such weeds as crste,
good corn have sought to choke.
The gardner has her sickle sharpte,
to pluck up all such seeds:
As to the eye do fruictfull seem,
and yet are stinckyng weeds.
Whose barrein branch as fertile semde,
to those that simple were,
In each respect as did the tree,
that yearly fruicte did bear.
But he which first did plant those trees,
in this our English land:
And did assign the Gardener she,
to take the chardge in hand:
Has shown her grace, where she shall graft
and where that she shall root:
According as affection serves,
to snche as yield no fruit.
And least that soil hereafter should,
his force again renew:
And wholesome herbs in England sown,
should foreign weeds subdue.
Her grace in hand the sickle holds,
to croppe such ympes in time:
Least if she stay as erste she did,
they hap to high to climb.
Though that our gracious Prince does loath,
to yield the fatal stroke:
To those that by deserts might much,
her highness ire provoke.
With edged tools seem not to ieste,
move not your Prince to much:
Least that the edge do turn and cut,
when you the same do touch.
Let each degree obey their Prince,
as duty has assinde:
Good England watch and look about,
there comes a plague behind.
That more will vex then sickness does,
repent therefore with speed:
Least God for thy incestious life,
to take revenge proceed.
O worthy Prince as erste thou haste,
the Gospelles might maintained:
And haste redreste the poor man's cause,
which has for right complainde.
Ronoumed Prince even so I crave,
forsee thy subjects woes:
And yield revenge to such as wish,
thy Croune to foreign foes.
Except the deeds of such in time,
as hollow hearts possess:
In words true subjects to your grace,
in deeds mind nothing less.
O Lord cut of such impes in time,
and send your grace tranquillity:
God grant the nobles may incline,
to yield your grace humility.
God grant the Gospel good success,
and Clergy for to preach:
The sincire truth as Christ him self,
was wont the same to teach.
Do Antichriste confound (O Lord)
bring Rome to desolation:
And do preserve Elizabeth,
The Queen of English nation.
Illuminate the Commons eyes,
that they may walk their path:
And grant the magistrate to use,
the office that he has.
And to this city grant (O God)
lord Mayor with his fraternity:
Degresse nothing from Princes will,
but join as one in unity.
God prospere her, God length her reign,
from harms her grace God save:
Poor Phillippes he with gushyng tears,
does thus desire to have

The penitent sinner.
BItterly and earnestly,
Before thy mighty majesty,
On knees I fall,
And cry and call,
For mercy Lord unfeignedly.
Day and night, before thy sight,
My sinful life I do recite,
And crave for grace,
For to embrace,
Which is my chief and hearts delight.
And I with humble reverence,
Do crave thy pardon for mine offense:
Thy mercy eke, oh Lord I seek,
With humble soul, and heart most meek.
What am I oh king most hye,
That thus by mine iniquity,
I should provoke,
Thy heavy stroke,
To punish me so greuouslie.
Mine offense, and negligence:
Has monde to wrath thy patience:
Which now in haste,
I feel and taste,
By proof and plain experience.
But Lord though I have sinned sore,
Yet slay me not in anger therefore:
Nor in thine ire, I thee desire,
Condemn my soul to endless fire.
Worthily, undoubtedly,
I have deserude extremely,
And trod the pathe:
Right to thy wrath,
Such was my weak infirmity,
Satan has so blinded me:
That I forsook thee utterly,
And by his art,
He dulde my heart,
That I had quite forgotten thee.
And did let slip out of my mind,
Thy benefits and favor so kind:
Thy mercy most, oh Lord of host.
The perfect rest to grieved ghost.
Cast thine eyes, from crystal skies,
Upon my state, and hear my cries,
I do repent,
With hearts consent,
Therefore my suite do not despise.
Heal my wound, and make me sound:
Least fear of hell my sprits confound,
Respect my case,
And grant thy grace,
That hope of health may once abound.
And that the storms of death and sin.
May not in me such victory win:
That I at last, when health is paste,
In everlasting pains be cast.
Pity me and succor me,
Oh God of thy benignity,
I do intend,
For to amend,
And fly from sin unfeignedly,
Utterly, I will defy,
To run my race so wickedlie.
As here tofore,
I have full sore
The greater grief assuredly.
But though I be a wicked wight,
By true repentance pardon me quite:
For God above, as scriptures prove,
A contrite heart does daiely love.
Though my sin, so vile has been,
That judgment just, the same does win
Yet since I due,
My self renew.
And to repent my fault begin.
Offer grace, for I embrace,
A broken heart in present place:
And I deteste,
With constaunte breaste.
The woorks of sin before thy face.
All deeds of darkness I defy,
And to thy ways my footsteppes apply:
Thou art my tower of health each hour,
I force not then for Satan's power.
Merciful and pitiful,
Thou art unto the sorrowful,
To such as be,
Convert to thee,
Thou showste thy graces plentiful.
Scripture says, that only faith,
Does quench thy hot and burning wrath
Which kindled is,
I know well this.
Against the man that treades the pathe.
Of wicked life, and unbelief,
And other sins ingendreth grefe:
And will constrain perpetual pain.
Except from sin he do refrain,
Therefore I vnsainedlie,
Acknowledge mine iniquity,
And now I crave,
Thy grace to have,
And mercy in this misery.
Fear of hell does me compel,
My sins with tricklyng tears to tell,
Thy heavy hand,
I understand,
And all thy skourges fearce and fell.
Wherewith thou have from time to time,
Corrected such as fell into crime:
And did transgress thy laws no less,
Whereto we ought our lives adresse.
Wilfulness in wickedness,
Is most extreme ungodliness:
The man that does,
Against all truth,
Resist of sturdie stubbornness,
He I say, a sore decaie:
Shall taste, as one quite cast away,
In endless pain,
There to remain,
As unto hell a lastyng pray,
Where with the glotton he shall taste,
In Limbo lake, sore torments in haste:
Where he shall cry with voice on hie,
With Dives, till his tongue be dzie.
Whiles the same, to mind I frame,
I call upon thy holy name,
My sin I leave,
To thee I cleave,
And eke my wanton flesh I tame.
Making moan to thee alone,
With many a sigh, and many a groan,
For my misdeede,
Which do exceed:
And stincke before thy crystal throne.
My sins like Skarlet seem in sight,
Oh make them Lord, like woll very white,
Like Purple they appear I say,
But thou like Milk can them conuaie.
David just did not mistruste,
Thy mercy when he kneeled in duste,
And on his back,
A hearie sack,
Did wear, as scripture have discuste.
Greuouslie and bitterly,
Confessyng his adultery:
His murder eke,
With mind most meke,
When Nathan true did prophecy.
The plague of God against him than,
Except to turn forthwith he began:
So David's heart, for fear of smart.
By true repentance did conuarte.
God forgave and did him save,
From vengau^ce just, which sin did crave
Oh deal with me,
So tenderly,
That David's rest my soul may have.
For no doubt, I go about,
To turn from sin that deadly route,
From bloody Saul:
To faithful Paul,
I bridle ill affections stout.
Which did restrain my heart and mind,
From thee my maker loving and kind:
And did withdraw the fear and awe,
Prescribed in thy holy law.
I confess with singleness,
My former vile ungodliness:
And I despise,
With weeping eyes,
The deadly ways of wickenesse.
Which I took,
And so forsook,
The way of life without rebuke,
To Christians all in general,
The glorious gains whereon to look.
Which way who so does walk a right,
He shall attain the heavenly light:
And for reward of his regard,
A blessed croune there is preparde.
Hope of this eternal bliss,
Has made me leave to run amiss,
And shonne the way,
Which brynges decaie,
The ends whereof destruction is.
Pain and woe,
As scriptures show,
With everlasting overthrow:
And therefore I this pains to die,
Submit my soul, and seek to know.
That narrow gate of blissed state,
Where is no strief nor any debate,
But joy always with perfect praise,
Oh God vouchsafe my soul to raise.
Though I be unkind to thee,
In mercy father pardon me,
And though my race,
Be void of grace,
Yet grant that I, thy love may see.
Though we begone, yet Lord anon.
Vouchsafe that I with Simeon,
May see my wealth,
And saving health,
I mean that steadfast corner stone.
Which of the builders was refused,
And in their deeds most spitefully used:
This stone was Christ that kyngly Priest,
That with his blood our souls has bleste.
Grievously and bitterly,
Behold my great adversity,
Wherein I stand:
Bound with the band,
Of sin, and sore captivity.
Haste then thine ears to bow,
To me oppressed with sorrow now.
On thee in haste,
My care I cast,
My prayers Lord in faith allow.
Oh let my plaints the heavens pearse,
And here the suite which I do rehearse:
Turn not away thy face I pray,
But save my soul from hells decaie.
Satan still, by wicked will,
Would turn my hope from Syon hill:
Which to attain,
I pitche with pain:
The tents of faith, though devil nill.
Temptyng me, to disagree,
From confidence, oh Lord in thee,
And to mistruste:
Thy promise just,
Which unto sinners showed be.
But thou my God, make weak his strength,
Least he by craft, subdue me at length:
For I am weak, in spirit I speak,
All Satan's slightes in sonder break.
Subtilie and craftelie,
He sekes by deuellishe policy:
To clogge my feet,
In paths unmeet,
And walk in ways of vanity.
Steadfastly and zealouslie,
I will adore thy Majesty:
And eke prepare,
To fix my care,
Upon thy mercy faithfully.
Thus doing still, I hope by faith,
Thou will translate, to favor thy wrath:
And cleanse my spotte, and purge the blotte,
That all my faults may be forgotte.
Heart and tongue, and greues among,
Shall sing as holy David song,
The Psalms of praise:
To thee always,
Before assemblies old and young.
Fervently and ardentlie,
My lips thy praise shall testify,
Both young and old:
With hearts most bold,
Thy holy name shall magnify.
And I with thanks will aye commend,
Thy works and wonders, world without end,
Let all adore with me therefore,
Thy name be praisde for evermore.
Finis.
