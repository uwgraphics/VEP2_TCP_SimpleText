THE Hunting of the Fox and the Wolf, because they make havoc of the sheep
of Christ Jesus.

Take heed of false prophets, which come unto you in sheep clothing, but
within are ravening Wolves.

An Admonition to cold preachers.
IF preaching fail,, as it does begin,
The people must quayle,, and die in their sin^
And if it decrease,, Gods curse is at hand
To destroy us, our peace,, our souls and our land.
Therefore let us be mending, Gods plag's to prevent
For after our ending,, it is to late to repent.
Take heed the^ to preching,, gods word to embrace
And larne to take warning,, lest God you deface.
To al my faithful Brethren in Christ Ie^u, and to all other that labor to
weed out the weeds of popery (...) the Lord Jesus ^e with y^u and make yo^
perf^^ in all good works to do his will working in you that which is pleasant in
^is sight through Jesus Christ our Lord.
Dear brethren, because we are created for gods glory, ye edification one of
another in Christ, and are bound to serve thereunto by wealth or woe, life or
death, and cheefely, they to whom God has given the greater gifts, and whom
he has called to higher romes, are most bound to be zealous for Gods glory,
with godly zelousie to profit the Church and spouse of Christ under their
charge, and yt by no subt^lty, as the Apostle warns, they should be
corrupted from the simplicity of Christ: Therefore there is no doubt of your
good zeal and diligence: My good Fathers and dear Brethren who are first
called to ye battle, to strive for gods glory and the edificatio^ of his
people, against the Romish reli^^^s and rags of Antichriste, I doubt not but
yt you will couragieuslye and consta^tly in Christ, rap at these rages of Gods
enemies, and yt you will by this occasion race up many as great eno^mities, yt
we al know and labor to raccout all the dregs and renma^ts of transformed
popery, that are crept into England, by to much lenity of the^ that wi^be
named the Lords of the Cl^rgie. What is he that h^th the zeal of Gods glory
before his face, ^ will not join both in prayer, and in suffering with you, in
so good a cause, that is so much for Gods g^orie and the edification of Gods
church, in the pure simplicity of Chri^t^s word and sacraments, wherein our
enemies and per^ecut^urs are strangly bewitched? I wot not by what Circes
(...), that they do make such a diversity betwixt Christ's word and his
Sacraments, that they cannot think the word of God safely enough preached,
and honorably enough handled, without cap, koape, surplis, But that the
Sacraments, the marying, the burying, the churching of women, and other church
service (as they call it) must needs be decored with crossing, with capping,
with surplessing, with kneeling, with pretty wafer cakes, and other knackes of
popery. O Paul that thou were alive, thou durst tell those politic
gentlemen, that there has bin to much labor bestowed upon them in vain: thou
durst say unto them as thou did to the Corinthians, That they eat not the
Lords Supper, but play a pagent of their own to blind ye people* and keep
them still in superstition, far from the simplicity of Christ's supper: but
how many silie souls is there that does believe ver^^y, that they have an
Engli^h mass, and so put no difference between truth and falshod, between
Christ and antichrist, between God and the devil, they are strangly bewitched.
I say yt thus will b^nde t^eir English priesthode and sacraments, but much more
enchau^ted that can find no garments to please them, ^ut such as have bin
poluted openly with popish superstition and idolatry: but most of all in this
point that their madness appear to all posterities, yt they make these
Antichristian rags Causam sine qua non, that is, a cause without which there
is no holy ministry in Christ, so yt this shall make an English priest, be he
n^uer such a dolt or unlearned in the knowledge of the scripture, as we have
very ^any, and without these Romish relics not Paul him self shall be
admitted (as one of them did blaspheme, and the rest of them in effect do
affirm:) well against such popish chaffer and popery, has bin long agone
f^ughten withal, when the great captains of that religion lived, and yet God
g^ue the victory. Therefore let us not fear now, although it does begin to
stir again, for there is no craft, cunning, counsel, wisdom or policy
against the Lord. We have Christ and his Apostles and the Prophets ever
striving against the Hipocrites of their time on our side: a straw for popish
policy we have the word or God to warrant us, to rote out al monuments of
supersticion and Idolatry, and are charged to abhor them, to accoumpt them,
accursed, and to dety them, and to d^test the^ as menstreous clowts, they have
not the word of God for the^. And what wi^edome is in them, says God by his
Prophet Ieremi, they talk of obedi^nce and concord, but there is no obedience
against the Lord, no nor co^corde to be desired, but where Gods glory and
verity is preserved. Else better to have all the world in hurly burlis, and
heaven and earth to shake, the^ one jot of gods glory should decay So far
forth as in us lies, we have their own laws and proclamatio^s to root cut
all monuments of supersticio^ and idolatri, and their own words are contrary
to their doings. It should appear yt they repent their reformacion proclaimed,
as did ye Isralits, they build again yt which once they have destroyed and this
is don openly yt all the world may wonder and behold: but what is don secretly,
god will one day have it declared openly, yea they make the name of god and this
doctrine yt we profess* to be evil spoken of already. By many of their
doings, their judgment hastes that for such causes persecute Godsf^rue
Preachers: Wherefore let us not ear their thretnings, there can none persecute
the godly for this cause and trash, but either such as are neither hot nor
cold, and then they shall be vomited out unless their zeal increase, or such
as have no God before their eyes, whose God is their bellye, or else open
papists, who^ God has given up to a reprobate sense, wherefore we must thus
take it, yt they are gods rods for our sins, because we have not bin more
zealous in gods cause, neither careful to seek his glory, y^ wolf Winchester
and blody bucher Bonar fought once against many godly men for the ground of
this gere, and they had all the power of ye Realm serving their lusts: but
behold how the Lord in short time overthrew them all, to give us courage to
go forward, the Lord forgive us, we are to slack and negligent in heavenly
things: this monster Boner remains and is fed as papists say, for their
sakes, and it must be granted it is for some purpose, although he be a traitor
and an enemy to y^ crown and realm, and both to God and man, which burned
Gods holy testament, murdered his faintes and his servants. But what the Lord
requires to be done with false Prophets, it is manifest: we have both the
law of God and man for us. But we are answered nay you your selves shall be
compelled to turn your coats and cappes, and get you into his liueries, and
to be like him in your garments. O Elias that thou liued^t, or that thy
spirit were amongst us, thou w^uldest ^aye with the Prophet Sophome, That God
will unite the wearers of this idolatrous garments or strange apparel, thou
would say, that things dedicated once to idolatry, is not indifferent:
thou would say reverence to the Sacrament is wrought by doctrine and
Discipline, and not by popish and Idolatou^s garments: thou would say,
What decency can ther^ be gained to the Sacraments, by that which has been
devised and used to deface it: I^ the gold ordained by God for the reverence
and decency of the Jews Temple, is not to be admitted to beautify the
Church of Christ, much less kopes brought in by Papists the enemies of God,
and always continued in their service as ornaments of their Religion in no
wise ought of us Christians to be retained. But the Papists triumph and
glory in their assemblies, that the whote gospelers shall be driven to their
doltishe attires: for the Lords sake let us never give them any cause of
joy, though we should dye for it. Moses would not yield one hoof of a beast
in Gods business, he would not leave the loupe v^^ade, nor make a button or a
claspe more or less. Eleazar will not dissemble by eating of unlawful meats,
the faithful Israelites would not receive so much as an yuie bushe. Contrary
wi^e Origin carrying a branch, and professing that he bare it for Christ at
the first: But was afterward compelled to open idolatry, so cursed a thing it
is to give any place to the wicked: all the papists that say, they worship
Christ in ye cross, and God in the sacrament, do still under these words
continue still in their idolatry: beware of deceytful words, that cover wicked
purposes, to draw us from Christian simplicity.

Let us stand constantly against all abuses, and repent for our former coldness
in religion, and our sins, and call for help from above, for the hand of the
Lord is not shortened: we are assured that we seek Gods glory, and our
adversaries may see, if they can see any thing, that this thing that they seek
is not for Gods glory, seeing the papists the enemies of God do so desire it
and glory in it. And rejoice, yt we, whom they most hate, cannot be safe but
under their garments: we are assured that we seek Gods glory in following
Christ his Apostles and Prophets: who ever despised these pharisaical outward
faces and visures, Christ finds fault with the garments of the Pharisees.
Paul counts all his Pharisaicall show to be dunge. Zachari says, that the
false Prophet shall be ashamed of his prophecye, and forsake his garments wherein
he deceived, and shall ye true Prophets be feign to creep into their cou^es*
for by the same authority may be commanded any peace of popery, so y^ it be
nam^d policye. Ezechias and Josias knew no such authority, but they say: It is
for policy. For it plainly appears that there is less care for religion
then for policy. But beware yt the example of Ieroboham be not followed, that
made such like preistes for policye, as would do as he commanded them. Achaz
of policy brought y^ fashion of an altar into Jerusalem, as he saw at
Damascus, where he had overcome the Idolatours and their idols, but cursed was
his policy, and so are all they yt will retain any thing of their idolatry.
Nabuchodonosors Idol was for unity and policy, but without ye warrant of gods
word, there is neither good unity nor policy. The godly father Bucer called ye
tenths and the first fruits sacrilege and robery, they be kept still for
policy, cross and candelstickes are supersticious, though they be kept, I
wot not for what policy, the adoration of the Sacrament in the countries where
they knock and kneel for a wafer cake is a popish policy. That women baptize,
that pluralities, to^, quots, impropriacions, non reside^ce dispensations,
suspencions, exco^municacio^s, and absolucions for money (...) granted, (...)
is euel like as are mani other (...) b^r^^wed from Rome, which remain (...) of
policy. Al these things were abhorred as popish ^upersticions and Idolatries,
am^ng our gospellers both bishops and others, when they were under gods rods
in p^ue^^y^. But how they now have learned c^urtle ^iuin^ty to ground all upon
policy. Humble them again, O Lord, that they do not f^^get thee, and thy great
kindness, and mercy (...) upon them, and stir up their hearts and minds,
that they may be carefu^l ^uer thy poor flock. O Christ whom thou haste
dearly bought, by this their policy are blinded, and cares for no more, ^ut
y they may have this supersticious show which is (...) maintained. (...) him
mumble as he list if he be thus apparelled, al his service is well enough,
otherwise it is nothing worth. Thus cause you the^ to perish by your policyes,
for whom Christ has dyed. Furthermore, if popery be supersticious and
idolatrous, euel and wicked, as yet there was never a worse thing in the world,
the^ ar we commanded to abst^ine from al participatio^ thereof, and from all the
show thereof ab omnistecie mali, yt is from all show of wickedness. These
garments were the show of their blasphemous priesthod, herein they did sing and
say their ^uper^^icious ^^^^atrous seru^ce they did c^nce their Idols and
help forward their idolatrous masses: What policy can it be then to wear
this gea^e? ^ut a superstitious, wicked and popish policy: they do it for
policy (they say) that their Priests may be known and magnified of men. Did
not the Pharisees use the same policy, to do al their works and make all
their garments both Philacteries upon their heads, and their wide and side
robes and borders, that they might be more expectable and notorious to the
people? but their woe is threatened above al other sinners. To such hypocrites,
as being void of all true holiness, delight in all outward shows, their curse
is most inculcate, their policy is that the Priests shall wear white in the
churches to signify their virtue, their pureness and holiness: and when they go
forth of the Church they must wear black gowns and black horns for
contrary policies and for diverse significations. Our master Christ's policy
was expressed in one word, feed, feed, feed: and the Prophets before, and
the Apostles afterward: if Christ be the wisdom of the Father, the true
Ministers shall be well enough known, by that one mark which he gives: And if
that he have not that mark, better unknown then known, both for him se^^e
and others: Therefore let them not say, for shame, that they seek Gods glory,
Christ's will, or the edification of his Church by their policy. Whiles they
threaten and stop the spreading of Gods word and feeding of Christ's
flock, commanded by writing to excommunicate the most faithful lab^urers in
the planting of the Gospel, because they will not wear the rags of popery,
to expulse ye most valiant Soldiers against the Romish Antichriste, the most
earnest ouerthrowers of the kingdom of Satan, which stands in sin and
blindness. O beware you, that will be Lords over the flocks, that you be not
sore punished for your pride toward your brethren, and your cowardlines in
Gods cause, that for Princes pleasures and pompouse livings, do turn popery
into policy, and to become our persecutours under the cloak of policy: it
were better to lose your livings, then to displease God in persecuting of your
brethren, and hinder the course of the word. But as our du^tie is, we will
pray for you, and for all our brethren in the ministry, that GOD of his grace
would grant us more zeal for his glory, than any of us has had heretofore,
more desire to edify Christ's people in pure simplicity, to present them a
chaste virgin unto Christ, then hitherto has appeared, that when the ^ead
shepherd shall call to accoute we be not ashamed. But being found per^te in all
good works, may receive the crown prepared: as for you dear brethren whom
God has called into the brunte of the battle, the Lord keep you constant,
that ye yield neither to to^^eration, neither to any other (...) persuasions
or dispensacions, or lice^ces, which were to fortify their Romish pract^ses,
but as you fight y Lords fight, be valiant. God will not leave you, neither
forsake you, as you seek Gods glory, god will glorify you, and as by you
Christ's church is edified, comforted and conformed in Christian simplicity, so
shall you receive comfort by Christ your head captain, when you shall be called
to give accounts of your stewardships, and to be rewarded for your fidelity: ye
matter is not so small as ye world do take it, it will appear before al be
ended, what an hard thing it is to cut of the rags of the Hidra of Rome, it
is beautiful, but poysonful, there is no dealing with such a monster, beware of
loking back to Sodo^^ or delight any wit in the garments of Babylon,
neither once touch the poisoned cup, though it be of gold or glittering. Let
us repent of our former sins unfeignedly, and then shall we abhor and stamp
under our feet these rags, that were appointed to supersticion and idolatry.
Let us hate the blasphemous priesthode, so injurious to Christ's priesthode, yt
every patche and token of it be in execration, detestation, and accursed, and
take no part of it upon our heads nor backs, least we be accursed as it is.
Let us not make the heritage of god as a byrd of many colors, holdinge of
diverse religions, Let us not mixte the Jews with the gentiles, let us not in no
wise mixte this our religion with any thing of Antichrist, let us not confirm
the blind in their blindness, neither the weak in their supersticion: But
rather let us take away, if we can, the names, memories, and all monuments of
popery, and that Antichrists priesthode: Let us open our windows with
Daniel, and profess what we are: their cruelty shall be our glory. Let us follow
Paul, that knew that the truth, gospel could not be retained, if any Iewishe
cer^monies were maintained. Let us rather never wear any garmente, then we
should wear those, whereby our brethren should be weakened, offended or
bouldened to take part with the idolatrous, and so through our hautines in
knowledge, our weak brethren perish, for whom Christ dyed. Behold and mark
well, how they fall backwarde that yield in any jot, and see how they are
edified, and increase in godliness, which hold that right way that you go in,
the which the Lord increase you, and us all, and strenghthen us with his holy
Spirit, that we may continue to our lives end, always both by our thoughts,
words and works, to advance his glory and honor daily more and more, now and
for ever, AMEN.

A Dialogue between the Foster, the Hunter, and the Deane.
The Foster. WEll overtaken master mine.


Hunter. Welcome sir unto my company, with all my heart.


Foster. How far intend you to ride this way?


Hunter I ride to London if / you ride thither I will be glad of your company.


Foster. I ride thither also.


Hunter Perchance ye are a Burgess of the Parliament / and ride thither to
serve God and the common wealth there.


Foster. I am chosen indeed for a burgess of the Parliament / I pray God
that al we that come thither / may seek earnestly in the Parliament house /
the glory of God, and the profit of the commonwealth.


Hunter I pray God that ye may seek to set forth the glory of God and not to
destroy his word / which many noble men of late with many great learned men
/ have taken great pain to promote and set forward / and namely our young
master / which has departed from us of late. As for the common wealth / for
these many years / there have been few that were very earnest to help it /
although in deed there were some.


Foster. It is the more pity / for a politic man / or a good citizen, and
much more a good christ an man / should not only seek his one profit / but
also the profit of his neighbor.


Hunter. I was five years together a Burgess of the Parliament / in the lower
house, but in all my time (although there were good acts made for the
establishing of Religion) yet there was always some, that either sought their
own private lucre / as the noble lordly and knightly sheepemasters did / in
defending against al honest lovers of the common wealth / the intolerable
number of sheep: or else ^ought very earnestly the Kings profit / wherein
they intended always to have not the smalest part. And such were certain of
the Counsel, or privy chamber, which contrary unto the order and liberty of
the house, would twice or thrice, or ofter* speak in one matter, for the Kings
profit or else for their own. And if we spoke any thing freely there, we were
taken up like butchers curres / or else were privily met withal afterward. If
that ye have no better order in your house now then we had then, ye may well
go home again for any good that ye shall do there.


Foster I must go thither, and as much as lies in me I will discharge my
conscience, if God will help me.


Hunter. In every sitting or session commonly there are complaints of the
multitude and ouerflowing number of sheep. But I marvel that there has been
of late years no complaint of the exceeding and insufferable number of wolves,
which do much more harm then the poor innocent sheep have done, and yet do
still, against then wills at the commandment of their masters, or rather at
their co^pulsion.


Foster. I have not heard tell in my time that there was ever any Wolf seen
in England.


Hunter. Yes ye have seen an hundredth upon one day, although ye knew them not.


Foster. I should know a Wolf by my office that I have, as well as an other
man should, for I am a keeper of Dear by my office, and am every day among wild
beasts, and I do dwell in a great Forest whereas, if there were any Wolves in
England, they should be most commonly. But I never saw any wolves in my
Forest, which is as great as the most part of Forests that are in England,
neither have I heard tell of any.


Hunter. Even as ye are a Foster and a keeper of Dear, so am I a Hunter of
wild beasts, and have been long and many a day: wherefore if I knew not
wild beasts as well as any man that is of any other calling, I were not
worthy the name that I have.


Foster. I pray you where have you seen any Wolves in England, because ye
seem to hold that there are so many Wolves there.


Hunter. I have seen a Wolf within these few years in the Tower, I have
seen many in diverse Cathedral Churches of England. But there are no where mo,
then are in the Conuocatio^ house, in the parliament time. If you will learn
to know Wolves: there may you see ynow, and a great deal mo.


Foster I understand you now at the last, what ye mean. All England is full of
such Wolves as you mean of.

Would to God we might bring it to pass, in the parliament, that the number of
such swolues might be made less* in that condition that there were v. thousand
mo sheep in England then now are.


Hunter. I am glad that you are so well minded toward the true religion.


Foster. We are al bound that are Christians, to favor and promote, the true
religion, although many go about now to hinder it as much as in them lies. And
one of the same (as far as I can perceive) rydeth yonder before us, ride a
littel faster that we may overtake him. I see him well enough, he is as starcke
a Pharise, as any is in all England again, if that you be a Hunter, as ye told
me ye were ye may have here in this plain field, a fair course at one of
your wolves, therefore let of your hounds and fall upon him, and I will help
you as much as I can.


Hunter. Break you the Ise, and give the first unset and then will I with all
the speed I can follow, and take the pray my self alone, except ye can
better skill in this kind of hunting then I can.


Foster. Well overtaken master Deane


M. Dean. Ye are Welcome sir.


Foster. Will you ride now to London master Dean?


Dean. Yea and God will.


Foster If it please you we will bear you company.


Dean. Sir I thank you. I am glad of your company. because we may (by reason
of your fellowship) with less ieopardy of thieves, and with more mirth come to
London


Foster. I pray you master Dean, that we may freely commun with you to drive
of the time with honest mirth and merry communicatio^, whiles we ride together.


Dean. Say on what you please and I shall give you the hearing / and so often as
it comes to my course an answer also.


Foster This Gentelman and I have ^easoned of a certain matter, wherein we
desire to hear your judgment.


Dean. What is the matter?


Foster My friend bears me in hand, that there are wolves in England and I
hold that there are none. I pray you let us hear your judgment what you
think of this matter*


Deane. In my days I have seen no Wolf in England, that I wot of, neither
have I hard of any man that has seen any: Wherefore I believe that there is none
in England, at the least in the part of England that I dwell in.


Hunter. Sir I have heard tell of more murder of sheep of late, then ever I
heard of* in my days before, wherefore when as we have no mo foxes then we had
wont to have and have more hunters of the Fox the^ ever we had before / I can
not think but that we have some Wolves in the land, which kill the sheep.


Dean. How should we have Wolves in this land* when they neither breed here,
neither are brought into the land.


Hunter. It is not vnbeleeuable / but that God has made certain beasts / in
diverse places, and cheefely in Islands, very far from any continent, or maine
land, without any natural bringing forth, of father or mother. Make you in
any low and fenny place of England, a great pond, and see whether within three
years ye shall have Eles there or no: I have heard, that both Pickrells and
many other kinds of fishes have been found in such ponds, wherinto no man has
never put any old fish in And this dare I be bold to say (for I have proved it
diverse times my self) that Bansticles have been found in great plentye in
diches within a year after that they have been up caste^ and made. Who would be
so mad, as to cast old Sticlinges or Stikelbegs into the dich whereof he
should never have profit?


Dean. It is true like that Dukkes and wild Gese and such like of that water
haunting kind, carry either the Rownes or Eggs of Fishes or else Fry / upon
their wings / bills / or feet / unto such new ponds and diches / as you
have spoken of / whereof come these fishes / whereof ye make mention.


Hunter As for the Rownes and Eggs of the fishes / they lie in the ground of
the water / and they are so slippery after that the male have powered his Milch
upon them (without the which they can have no life that the wild foul can not
carry them, neither in their feet nor in their mouths. And as for the frye for
my part / I never saw / red nor heard tell / that any fry of Fish has been
at any time / or in any place so tame / that it would be taken easelye with a
man's hand: wherefore when as every natural thing escheweth his natural enemy
/ as even the bloodes of Flories and Aegithus / being dead and insensible will
not be mixed together / it is truelike / that the young Frye (which have no
greater enemies then Duks be) will not come so near unto their enemies / to
cleave upon their bills legs / and wings / when as they fly away so
fearfully from a childs hand / which is no such enemi unto them / as the
Duck, and such like water haunters are Make a Barn in the midst of a field
even seven miles from any other house / where as no black house Mouse / or
Ratte, can come to / shall there not be within a year or two both black Myse and
Rattes there?


Dean. Perchance the Mise come out of the fields.


Hunter. They that come out of the fields are of another kind / and so unlike
/ that the one may well be known from the other. Who is he so inexpert / that
cannot descerne a black house mouse* from a brown field mouse / with the long
snout / much like unto a shrow?


Dean. It may chance that in continuance of time and by long tarying in the
house / that they may become housemise, or else I can not tell how they should
come thither.


Hunter. I am glad that ye grant that one beast may be changed into another.
But I will pass over that at this time / and will tell you that I have heard of
many credible persons / that is / that if ye make a new Ship / seven mile from
any town / and let her sail half a year in the main Sea / and come never
near unto any other Ship / that yet shall there be / both Mise and Rattes i^
the Ship.


Dean. It is no great marvel if such imperfect beasts have a double generation
/ that is both by the generation of the male / and female / and also of
corruption of the ground / but I reacken that ye will not gather / because
these small beasts that are ordained diverse ways to plague men withal both by
sea and land / come of corruption / as lyse and flees do / that Woluse also
may spring up of corruption / or that god makes them now in any place /
without natural generation of the male and female.


Hunter. Noes flood consumed and killed al kinds of wild beasts in the world
/ and none remained alive saving such as were saved in his Ship / when the
flood was ended / there were Islands a great number many hundredth miles from
any continent or main land / wherein are many kinds of wild beasts / beside
Wolves and Lions / and yet it is nothing like / that any man would have taken
the pain to carry such mischeuous beasts into those ylandes / therefore it
does appear / that such wild beasts / either sprung up of the nature of the
earth / or else God made them there / to exercise and to punish men thereby.
Then if God either make Wolves there or suffer Wolves to spring up there / or
bring Wolves thither out of other lands / to punish the people withal there /
why may he not also punish us English men for our sins sake / either by
suffering of Wolves to spring of them selves / or by making of new Wolves here
/ or by bringing in of other wolus that are made in other lands already to
puni^he us English men for our sins sake / as he made Locustes / Frogs /
Dogflees / and other great flies to punish the Egyptians withal / or as he
sent Lions into Samaria / to destroy the people there.


Dean. I grant God can do all these things / but because he can do them / it
follows not that he does the^ here now. God uses not to work any such
wonders / or miracles / except it be for a very great cause / as I see none
such at this time.


Hunter. The Lions were sent into Samaria because there was foul Idolatrye done
in that place / whereas God had wont to be served: have not these new
gospellers taken gods service this six years away / and set up a folish new
service in the stead of it? does not this overthrowing of the old catholic
religion deserve the bringing in of Wolves / as the inhabitants of Samaria have
deserved to have the Lions to be sent unto the (...) Therefore there wants
no cause why that God should send in Wolves / or make Wolves a new in this
land / to punish us withal.


Dean. Although we have deserved much punishment / for our departing from the
true religion / of our mother holy church yet God may send us other punishment
the^ by miraculously bringing in of wolus.


Hunter. Because ye think that God punishes us other ways then by sending in
and making of new Wolves / I pray you how shall I think that Wolves come into
this Realm / when as I am sure that there are diverse in this reamle / and see
the^ daily / and hear them dayly^ If they come not hither by some of the ways
which I have rehearsed before? Perchance ye see them not / and other see the^
not / yet I am sure that I both hear them and see them daily.


Dean. I can not believe yet that there are any / and if there be any / I can
not tell how they come hoyther.


Hunter. A Fox and a Wolf are very like in diverse things / think ye it not
possible but an old Fox may go forth of kind into a Wolf?


Dean. It is possible by the might of god but it is plain against nature.


Hunter. It is not against nature that one beast should go out of kind into
another. Pismires go out of kind / in Flies: Casewormes / or Codwormes become
Flies / Colewormes grow into Butterflies. Serpents and Dragons / Aristotle
writes in his book. de historia animalium, that a red breast is turned into a
red tail and that Melancariplus (that is to say a swart cope) is changed
into ^^^^dulam / which may be called a figbiter. A puleus was turned into an
Ass / as he writes himself: the scripture also records that Nabuchodonosor
(as it appears in the fourth of Daniell) was changed into a beast for his
heart was changed from a man's into a beasts heart / and he eat hay as an
Ox, but after that he repented him of his pride / his wit and his old figure
was restored unto him again. It is not therefore against nature / that an
imperfit beast should be changed into a more perfect of an other kind. Either
it is a against the word of God* that the perfitest creature above all other (I
mean a man) should be changed into a vile beast Therefore it is neither
against nature / neither against the word of God / that an old Fox should be
turned into a Wolf.


Dean. If that you could show me a Wolf in England / that were made of a Fox
/ then would I beeleeue your argument to be true / but if ye can not do that
(ye shall pardon me) I can not believe your conclusion.


Hunter. The most part of all the honest men that are in England / will bear
witness / that about five years a go / there was an old Fox carried into the
Tower of London / whereas / he has continued until within these few months
and that the same is a very right Wolf now / and goes abroad and is seen of
all men / and if that ye go to London / I am sure that ye shall see him.


Deane. Perchance ye mean of my Lord of Winchester / whom certain raylers
have called a Romish Fox. If that you do so you do not well / for he is a good
catholic man / and a prince over us. principi populi tui non male dices,
wherefore ye ought not to rail against him.


Hunter. Some men now a days / when as men speak against their open sins
and faults / and can no otherwise defend their naughtiness / call them that
speak the truth raylers.


Dean. And I insure you / they that call my Lord of Winchester a Wolf do
rail.


Hunter. Christ (which denied that he had any kingdom in this world and
refused to be a secular ruler whiles he would neither condemn the adulteres /
neither hear the cause of the two brethren that were at debate for the
division of their heritage) called Herod a Fox / who was of as great
auctority as Steven gardener (...): he called the Priests / Scribes and
Pharisees / (rulers in their vocacions) S24357.tech.take2.sgmipers / broad
wolves Hipocrites / Tumbes full of rotten and stinking bones / and Edders. The
Apostles being only preachers / and no princes / and namely Paul handeled the
enemies of Christ's gospel after the same manner / and called some of them
children of the Devil / as he called the Sorcerer / Act. 13. and he called the
men of Candy liars slow bellies / and evil beasts. I need not to rehearse
how sharply the Prophets rebuked the Kings and Princes in the old Testament
/ for ye know that they spared no man. The^ if that the Prophets of Christ and
his Apostles railed not / then rail I not for I do none other thing then they
did.


Dean. The Prophets with Christ and his Apostles / were ministers appointed for
that office / and they had this in their commission / that they should show all
men their faults / but I know no such commission that you have.


Hunter. I have had commission of God / and King Henry the eight and of King
Edward his son / and of both their counsels auctoriti to read and to
interpret the scripture: and although that my aucthority that I had of the two
fornamed Princes be worn out and disanulled by the coming in of a new
governor: I think in my conscience that I have yet still as much of Gods
commission remaining still / vnabrogate by any man's power / that thereby I may
call a Wolf ^ Wolf / and give warning unto my brethren that they beware that
they be not worried of Wolves for lack of warning.


Dean. Why go ye not to him and tell him that he is a Wolf / perchance he
would amend his manners / if ye would tell him his fault charitably.


Hunter. It is not the manner that the Hunter should go him self unto the wild
beast / but he has done his part / if he has sent his hounds unto him.


Dean What mean ye by that.


Hunter. I mean that is enough at this time / and in this part of the world /
to write unto him / and to tell him his faults in writing though I come no
nearer.


Dean. The scripture teaches you / that if your brother offend you / that you
ought to rebuke him between him and you alone / and if he hear you not /
then to tell the hole Church.


Hunter. These words of Christ are spoken of a private offense / that is
committed against one private man / and not of an open fault / which is both
known unto the Church / and has hurt the hole Church also. The scripture
teaches us / that he that offends openly / should be rebuked openly / that
other may be afraid to offend thereby. But what if he had offended me alone /
were I bound to go to rebuke him / that would cast me in prison and kill me /
if I came within his reach? Should Elias have done well if he had come to
Achab and to Iesabel / when as they would have killed him? If he did well and
wisely / that came not unto his mortal enemies / but kept him self a lofe /
then do not I ill to write unto him / and to keep my self from him / until
his teeth be broken / for fear of biting.


Dean. I marvel why you call him a Wolf / more then all the other Bishops
and Prists in England.


Hunter. Because he is the principal Wolf / and for a great part the hole
cause / of the great and exceeding number of Wolves that we now have / for all
the while that he was hid in his den / the great number of wolves that go
abroad now openly / and worrye and kill every where played the Foxes in their
holes but within eyghte days after he came abroad / and began to worry and kill
/ all the other Wolves entised and boldened by his example / began to come out
of their holes / and confessed openly in Sermons / and in other communication
what they were / and said that for fear of their lives / and loss of their
goods / they only ceased from their old office / these five or six years /
and that now they were ready to do all things / as they had wont to do /
according unto their nature and creation. And according to their saying / and
old nature / they have casten into their slaughterhouse / all the principal
sheep of Christ's flock / and certain of the shepeheardes also / that ever
as they are hungry they may kill them / as they did Fri^h / Barnes / Jerome /
Garret / and Lassels / with diverse others.


Dean. As far as I can gather by your communicacion / ye make not only the
bishop of Winchester a Wolf / but also all the Bishops of England Wolves
with him.


Hunter I take the bishop of Winchester / and all the mass priests of England
that consent unto his doctrine and doings for Wolves.


Dean. As it is easy to call all the bishops and priests of England that are
mass sayers / and preach the old learning / which ye call papestry Wolves /
so it is very hard to prove them Wolves.


Hunter. S. Paul in the twentye of the Acts of the Apostles prophecieth /
that grievous Wolves shall enter into the Church / which shall not spare the
flock: the same Paul prophecieth the same / in both his Episstles that he
writes unto Timothe. Peter also in his latter Epistle prophesied that false
prophets should come. Christ our master in the 24. of Math. said also that
false prophets shall come among his sheep / into the church / but the Church
of England is Christ's Church / and the people of it / are his sheep.
Therefore according unto the prophecye of Christ / and his Apostles / we must
believe that we have one time or other false prophets / but the lay men are
not the Prophets / and the^e must needs be false prophets / and there are no
more orders of men / but either lay men or priests ^he^ when lay men can not
be the fallse prophets / then must it follow that the priests are the false
prophets.


Dean. I grant that Christ and the apostles prophec^ed / that false prophets
should come / and I say that they came in deed / some even in the Apostles
times / as Ebion and Cerinthus / and afterward Arrius / Donatus / Pelagius /
Mahumet and a great sort mo.


Hunter. Christ and his Apostles spoke not of the time only / that immediately
came after them / but rather of the latter times / and of the last times of al
/ When Christ's Disciples asked him / of the end of the world / and of the
tokens thereof: he among diverse other tokens of the end of the world / numbreth
the great number of false prophets / which shall arise and deceive many /
therefore Christ prophesied not of them that were next unto his time / but of
such as should come in the end of the world. Paul prophecyinge of the false
prophets / speaks thus of them: Spiritus certo loquitur, quod in
posterioribus temporibus desciscent quidam a fide* etc. The Scripture speaks
of a suerty / that in the latter times / some shall depart from the Faith. In
the second Epistle unto Timothe / and in the third Chapter / he writes thus /
know you that in the last days shall come and draw near perilous times /
and men shall arise that have the image of godliness / but shall deny the effect
of it in deed. Peter also in the third chapter of his second Epistle / says
/ that in extremis diebus that is in the last days / shall come mockers. etc.
therefore the prophesies of Christ and the Apostles do bear witness that the
false prophets shall arise in the last times / and not only a little after
their times / as ye understand them.


Dean Well / then may we truly understand the above rehearsed prophesies / to
pertain unto Mahumet / and to all them that preach and teach his law /
whereof is a great number then of christen preachers.


Hunter. Paul Acts the twenty prophesying of the false prophets / says. Ex
nobis ipsis ex^^ientur viri loquent^s peruers^a. etc. There shall spring out
some of your own selves / which shall speak perverse things: and entreating
of the same matter unto Timothe / he says / deserscent quidam a fide* that is /
some shall depart from the faith. Peter writing of the false prophet^ says
there shall be false doctors a monge you. Then they that Paul and Peter
prophesied of / shall not come out of an other religion / but of our own
religion.


Dean. Then when ye will let me have none other to be the Wolves. I must say /
that (...) / H^s / Luther / Swinglius and the new preachers / which preach in
England the new learning are the Wolves where of Christ and the Apostles have
prophesied to come in the last days.


Hunter. Yes I will let you have all the massing and sacrificing clergy to be
Wolves / and yet I will defend them whom you have named* from the name of
Wolves / because they do not the deeds of Wolves. And as I said before / I say
that the bishop of Rome called the Pope / and all the bishops of England /
and all the priests that are ordained of the Pope / or any other bishop to say
mass and to serve in ceremonies only, which God never ordained / and not to
preach Gods word alone / and to minister only his Sacraments / and all they
that be ordained to preach Gods word, and do not preach / or if they do
preach either preach only man's ordinances / or else if they preach Gods word
/ leven it with the doctrines which are the commandments of men / are the
right wolves / that Christ and the Apostle Paul prophesied of.


Dean. The often saying of one thing proves nothing. It that is false of nature
/ can not be made true by often rehearsing / as you know your self. Therefore I
look that ye should prove at last / it that you have so often said / that is
that all the priests that hold the learning that my Lord of Winchester holds
are Wolves.


Hunter. I have in deed rechearsed one thing twice or thrice / but not for
that intent that I would that the often rehearsal of it / should stand in the
steed of a probacion / or proving of my saying. And though I be but a small
clerk in comparison of you / yet I trust if you will give me the hearing / I
shall prove my saying / not with the often rehearsal of the same / but with
the auctority of the scripture / and with good reasons sounded and grounded
upon the scripture / and natural reason.


Dean I am content to here you.


Hunter. Christ says / in the vii. of Matthew / keep your selves from false
prophets which come unto you in sheep clothing / but within are ravening
wolves: where by we may learn / that all false prophets are privy and inward
wolves. But the Pope and his Son Stephen Gardener with all the order of
priests above named / are false prophets / wherefore they are all wolves. He is
a false prophet which occupyeth the room of a true prophet / and either is not
sent, or else if he be sent / does not exercise his office as God has
commanded him but otherwise. And as there are many kinds of false prophets,
so are there many propertyes / whereby they may be known: The first propertye
of a false prophet is / to thrust himself into the office of a prophet / or to
take the office in hand before he be sent. The second is / to preach lies, and
other doctrine the^ God has commanded. The third property is to preach
earnestly his own doctrine / and to threaten great punishment to the breakers
thereof / and to preach very slackly, it that God earnestly / and expressedlye
has commanded / and to discharge men from the punishments which God
threateneth to the traunsgressours and breakers of them. These are also
properties of a false prophet to scatter / and to kill gods people / and to be
covetous of gold and silver / and of promocion / and to serve the belly / That
he is a false prophet / that thrusts himself into the office of a prophet /
or takes the office in hand / before he be sent of God / the prophet Jeremy
witnesses the 14. chapter: These prophets prophecy a lie in my name. I sent
them not. I gave them no commandment / neither have I spoken unto them / and
yet they prophecy a lying vision / and a gessing prophecy / and the deceit of
their own heart. Wherefore says the Lord / the prophets which prophecye in my
name when I sent them not / shall perish with hunger and sword. Jeremy xxix.
Let not your prophets and sothsayers beguile you / neither take ye any heed
to your dreams which you dream / for they prophecye unto you lying in my name
/ and yet I sent the^ not: the same sentence is contained Deutero.xviij. in
these words: A prophet which presumes to speak a word in my name / which I
commanded him not to speak / or he that speaks in the name of strange Gods
/ such a prophet shall dye. I find the same meaning in the xxiij. of Jeremy /
in these words: I have not sent these prophets / and yet have run: I spoke
nothing unto them / and yet have they prophesied. And in the xxvii. They
prophecy you a lie / for I sent them not / notwithstanding that they prophesy
falsely in my name. Ezechiell in the xiii. chapter speaks the same sentence:
they have seen vanity / and a lying prophecy / saying / the Lord has said it
/ when as the Lord has not sent them. Christ also in the new Testament
describes a false prophet after the same manner saying. He that enters not
into the shepefolde by the door / but climeth in another way / he is a thief
and a murderer. I am the door of the sheep all they that have comme before me
are thieves and murderers. If that he be a false prophet which takes the
office of a prophet or a shepeheard / and is not sent of God: If he be a thief
and a murderer / that enters into the sheepefolde / otherwise then by Christ
/ (as the holy ghost says he is) then all the unlearned Bishops / Deanes /
Prouostes / Cannons / Parsons and S24357.tech.take2.sgmicars which can not
preach and teach Gods word / are false prophets / Wolves / Thieves and
Murderers. For God never sent them / and so came they not into their offices
through Christ / but have climed in an another way. That God never sent the
unlearned / I prove it thus: He that would have his word preached unto his
slocke / and would that the same ^locke should be saved / and fed with the
same word / and gives an earnest commandment unto all the shepeheardes of
his flock / to preach unto the flock / and to cry unto his sheep / will
not send a du^me and an vnle^rned man / to be the shepehearde unto it. But God
would have his word preached / and his flock saved and kept with the same
word / and this is his commandment / cry and cease not: and show my people
their fautes / go and preach the gospel to every creature / go and teach all
nations / feed my Lambs / feed my sheep. Then ye see that it is the
commandment of God / that his flock should be fed with preaching and
teaching, whereby we may easelye know that he sends no du^me dogs / and
unlearned Asses to be Bishops / Parso^s and S24357.tech.take2.sgmicars over
his flock / that can not preach and teach the word of life whereby his
flock should be fed and saved from the Wolves. Therefore God never sent
the^ / neither came they in by Christ. Whereupon it follows / that all the
unpreaching Prelates in England / are false prophets and wolves because God
never sent them / nor called them to be prophets / and because he knew them
unmeet for that office. Now I pray you have ye seen no Wolves in England / is
it a strange sight to see in England dumme Ambassadors / and unlettered
legates that can not speak / nor declare the commandment of God? If such be
in every corner of England / that is to say / such as can not feed Christ's
flock with his word: then is all England full of Wolves.


Foster. I perceive for my part that the scripture calls such dumme pastors
/ thieves / robbers and Wolves / but if you could show me what they stale /
what they murdered and killed / I would be better satisfied in my conscience:
And then would I boldly say with you / that they were Wolves in deed.


Hunter. The unlearned Bishops Deans / prouostes canons / parsons and viccars
/ steal all the liuinges that they have / for they take the tithes and other
things of the people / saying that the tithes and such like things / are Gods
part / and say that gods part is due unto them / but they do not the office
that God has appointed for such liuinges / that is / they feed not his flock
with his word: therefore they are thieves. And that ye may the better
understand this / I will declare the matter by a likeness. If that a man gave
himself out for a physician / and could do nothing in physic at all / and
yet took ten pound to heal a sick man / and either ran away with the x.li.
or if he tarried with the sick man / neither did him any good / nor could do
him any good / were not this apish physician a thief? If there were an high
way / that had much need of mendi^g / and a common gathering were made /
through the hole parish / and a great sum of monye were gathered to mend
this high way withal / and the parish chosed out one of the parish, which for
that su^me of money should repair the high way / and he that is chosen /
takes the money and promises to amend the way / but either he runs away
with the money / or he tarieth still among his neighbors / and mendeth not the
high way / and holds the hole sum of money to himself / is not this man a
thief? If he be a thief / then is the Parson a thief / which takes ten
pound. in the year gathered unto him / out of the common fields / to feed
the part she therefore with Gods word / and never preaches in all his life. If
ye will have the sum of the matter compendiouslye told. take it thus* He
that takes away gods goods and his neighbors / from them against their will
deceitfully / is a thief / but all unpreaching bishops / deanes and parsons
take away gods goods and their neighbors / deceitfully against Gods will /
and against their neighbors / therefore they are thieves / yea and more then
thieves / church robbers.


Foster. I grant that they are spiritual thieves / but how prove you that
they same are murderers.


Hunter. I shall prove you that not only all the unlearned parsons / that are
not sent and can not preach / are murderers / but also that all such learned
Bishops / Deanes / Parsons / and other Prelates / that are sent of God and his
church / and yet do not preach and feed not Christ's flock with his word /
are murderers* wolves and false prophets. If that ye had a young child / and
your wife were dead / or your wife living / could not give the child suck her
self / if a nurse took in hand for xij. d in the weke to feed your child /
if she either having no milk / suffer the child to dye for hunger / or having
milk enough gave your child nether milk / nor other good meat / but suffered
it to dye for hunger / would ye not say / that this woman were a murderesse?


Foster. Yes that I would / and tha for a shameful murderesse.


Hunter. Then when as every pastor or sheepehearde takes Christ's flock in
hand to feed it with Gods word / and receives good wages for the feeding
thereof / and either having no knowledge of Gods word / suffers Christ's
flock to perish / for lack of spiritual fode / or having good knowledge /
runs away from his flock / and feeds it not / or though he tarry with it
/ feeds it not with gods word / but suffers it to perish for lack of
preaching / is not every such unpreaching pastor then a murderer / and a Wolf?


Foster. Reason says so / but how prove you this by the scripture. For except
ye can prove this by the scripture / there are many that will not believe you /
that murder may be committed by not feeding / and not crying against the
peoples vices.


Hunter. The Lord God says in the xxxiij. of Ezechi. If I bring the sword
upon the earth / and the people of the earth / take a man of their country /
and make him their watchman / and if he see the sword coming upon the earth
/ and then blow with his tromphet / and warn the people plainly / and they
hear the voice of the tromphet / and will not be warned / if the sword come and
take them away / their own blood be upon their own heads. But if the
watchman see the sword coming / and blow not his horn / and the people be
not plainly warned / if the sword come / and they be killed / the people are
killed for their wickedness / yet will I require the blood of my people of
that watchmans hand Thus far has God spoken. You may see that my parable and
this does agree together. The Lord in the same chapter declares his parable
thus. O thou son of man / I have made thee a watchman to the house of Israel
/ that thou may hear the word out of my mouth / and that I may warn them
plainly in my name. If I say unto the wicked / thou wicked / surely thou shall
die / and thou will not speak unto him / that he leave his wicked way / he
shall dye in his wickedness / but his blood will I require at thy hand. Now sir
have ye heard it plainlye spoken without any parable / by Gods own mouth:
that the watchman which will not give warning unto his flock / is guilty of
blood. But none are guilty of blood but murderers / but dumme pastors are
guilty of blood / therefore they are murderers and so spiritual wolves. If
these places be not thought sufficient to prove that unpreaching prelates / are
false prophets and so Wolves and murderers / I will allege mo places to
satisfy them that aer not yet satisfied. Almighty God says / Ezechiel the
xxiiij: Son of Man prophecye thou against the pastors / or sheepeheardes of
Israel / and thou shall say unto them: Woe be unto the sheepeheards of Israel
/ which have fed them selves / ought not sheepeheardes to feed their flock?
Ye eat the fat, ye are clothed with the woole / ye kill it that is fat /
ye feed not the flock / ye have not strengthened the weak / ye have not gone
to heal the sick / ye have not bound up it that was broken / ye have not
brought home again it that was driven away / and ye have not sought it that
was lost / but you have bin lords over them in hardness / and cruelnesse: they
have straied out of the way / being without a sheepeheard / and they have been
meat t^ every beast / whilse they wa^dered, My flock has wandered in all
mountains / and in every high hill / and upon all places of the earth /
have my sheep ben scattered, and there was none to seek them, therefore hear
ye O shepeheards the word of the Lord. As truly as I live / I will punish you
/ because my sheep were taken away / and were prays to every beast of the
field / because there was no sheepeheard, and because my sheepeheardes have not
sought for my sheep / but the shepeheards have fed them selves. Therefore ye
sheepeheardes hear the word of the Lord. Behold I am against the
sheepeheardes / and I will require my sheep of their hands. Now I trow that
I have proved / that all the unpreaching prelates of England / are thieves /
murderers, and Wolves / and that two properties of a false prophet / agree unto
our dum pastors / and so are they false prophets / that the hole scripture
cries out upon and condemns.


Deane. Then the unpreaching prelates / as ye call them / are not hole false
prophets / because they have not all the properties of a false prophet.


Hunter. There are many kinds of false prophets, and who so ever has any one
of the properties of any of those kinds is a false prophet. Christ takes him
for a false prophet in the tenth of John / that is unsent / and enters into
the office of a prophet or sheepehearde not through Christ / but climeth in an
another way / his words in latin are these: Qui non intrat per hostium, in
stabulum ouium seda scendit. That is he that enters not into the sheep f^old
by the door / but climeth in an other way, he is at hefe and a murderer.
Almighty god in the xj. of Zachari / painting and discribing another kind of
false prophets / says after the old translatino: O pastor and idolum
derelenquens gre gem. O sheepeheard and idol which leaves or forsakes his
flock. In the Surik translation Vae pastori idolo qui gregem deserit Woe be
unto the idol shepeherd that leueth his flock. The Lord in the 34. of
Ezechiel, describing false prophets / shows none other token of a false
prophet, or of an evil shepeheard or of a Wolf / but that he feeds not his
flock. So that he is both a false prophet / that comes into the church
otherwise then by Christ / and he also that enters rightly into the sheepefold
and yet leaves his flock / or tariyng with his flock feeds it not.

Now have I proved / that he that has any of these properties of a false
prophet / is a false prophet. I may therefore call all the unpreaching prelates
false prophets, because they either have two properties of a false prophet / or
one sure property at the lest, which a lone after the mind of Christ, makes a
false prophet.


Dean. The pore priests of England have not deserved to have the names of
dogs and Wolves for not feeding of the people / for they minister the
sacraments / they pray / they sing and say gods service / and they read the
holy scripture / which is sufficient food for the souls of all their
parishioners and hol^ flock / also the bishops do as much good in their
dioceses / as a sort of prating preachers have don, whi^^ they hear causes of
heresy / of fornication / and of such like manners / they consecrate Deacons
subdeacons / and Priests / they continue in the great cities of their dioceses
/ as it were in high rocks / or tops of hills / looking there / over all the
country / whether any heretical Wolves / come into their flock or no / if
they see any. I warrant you they cease not / but they cry out upon them / and
not only cry out upon them / but also if they can cage them, cast them into
the fire. Other of the bishops / which are away from their flocks / Either
are Ambassadors / or they are Counselers / and continue in the Court or they
have other offices / wherein they serve God and the Queen / as well as the
best preachers that ye have had is England these seven years. Therefore ye
ought not to have called them Wolves, seeing they are so well occupied.


Hunter. I maruelsyr that ye slip over and pass by my reasons / arguments /
and places of scripture which I have alldged / as though he had not heard them.
Belike eytheh your conscience tells you / that it is true that I have said /
or else you can not answer unto them. As touching your arguments least I
should seem to knowledge them to be good / or else unanswerable by passing
over them, or else so clarkly / as though I were a feared to strive with you in
them: I will answer to them one after another. Whereas ye say that the
unpreaching bishops and priests ought not to be called dogs and Wolves /
because the minister the Sacraments because they sing and say Gods service /
because they read the Scriptures / which is food enough for all their
parishoners and flocks / because they (namely the bishops) hear causes of
fornication / of heresy / and such like matters / consecrate Subdeaco^s /
deacons / and priests / and stand in th greatest ^ities of their dioceses /
as it were in high tops of mountains / to spy whether any heretical Wolves
come into their flocks or no / and if they spy any / do cast the^ into the
fire, because they are Ambassadors / because they are Councellers / because
they are Amners and Chanceloures / and such like officers / and are thus well
occupied / and do a much good / as our prating preachers do (as ye
unadvisedly call them / I answer that the doing of al these things / discharg
them not / from the true and well deserved names of dumme dogs thieves
robbers / and wolves. For he that keeps all the eight last commandments
and breaks the two first commandments / which are two of the most
principal commandments / is guilty of all the rest: and shall be dammed for
the breaking of those two. What if I granted you that all these deeds which
ye said the unpreaching prelates were occupied in / were belonging unto their
vocacion even according unto the ordinance of god (as I know the contrary to be
true) yet I will prove you that the preaching of Gods word / is also belonging
unto all bishops / and pastors / and shepeherd^ / for Christ says to the
pastors or shepeheards / go and teach all nations / and Baptize them / in the
name of the Father / and of the Son and of the holy Ghost* teaching them to
keep all things / which I have commanded you. And in the xvj. of Mark he
says go into all the world / and preach the gospel to every creature / then
is preaching a work necessarily required of all pastors and bishops. Wherefore
if they do not this most exellent work that belongs unto a sheepeheard /
they are guilty / and are breakers of all the other works that belong unto a
bishop / or a sheepeheard. Ezechiel / (as I alleged him before) makes all
pastors that preach not the amendment of life unto the people / and give not
the^ expressed warning to amend their lives: to be murderers. If he do so / so
may I do the like. Then may I call them well enough murderers and therefore
false porphets and wolves. Well then when as no man can deny / but that
preaching is the principal office that belongs unto a Bishop or shepehearde
though all your lately named deeds were offices belonging unto their vocation:
yet for all that / the doing of all them / should not discharge them from the
wrath of God for committing of murder / if he murdereth, that seedeth not.
Which thing I shall declare unto you, by these two similitudes or likenesses:
If a nurse prayed every day three hours for the child which she has taken in
hand to feed / and sange other three hours / and washed the child as clean
as it were possible for a woman to do / and yet gave the child no milk / nor
fed it, but suffered it to dye for hunger / I think for all her praying and
saying, singing and washing / she were a murderesse. It that a watchman were
hired of all the citizens of a city to watch the city / and this watchman
went out of his watching place and went into the city and helped the masons to
biuld the wales, or did any such like thing, whereof he had no charge, or
commandment, and the enemies came into the city / and killed all the
citizens / or but ten of them, for lack of the warning of the watch man: this
watch man should be guilty of all their deaths that were killed / as almighty
God says in Ezechiel. Even so al your unpreaching parsons / though they do
diverse other things / either not belonging unto their office or belonging to
their office or cali^g and leave undone the most prinpal part of al other, that
is preaching of Gods word, and suffer the flock to perish for lack of
preaching / are gilty of the blood of al the^ that perish / for lack of
preaching of Gods word unto them. Also when as God has ordained bishops to be
watchmen over their flocks / if they leave their office undone / and go away
from their flock / and play the Counselours / Amners / and Chauncelours / if
any of their flock perish for lack of keeping / they are soul murderers /
and therefore Wolves and worse then dogs. Where as ye say that the parsons
feed Christ's flock sufficientlye / because they read the word of God /
which is sufficient fode for all their flocks: I say that it is true that the
word of GOD is sufficient food for all their parishioners / if that it were
ministered and served out unto the people / as it should be. But the reading of
it in a strange tongue / feeds not Christ's flock / and the word of God
spoken and read in a strange tongue / and not expounded / saves not the flock
from the Wolves / neither does the only reading of gods word / discharge the
shepeheard from the rightly deserved name of a murderer. For as if an
englishma^ which were made the watchman of Barwick / if he saw the Scotts come
toward Barwicke / and spoke to the citizens and soldiers of the city / either
only Erchontai sko^ in Greek / or veniunt scoti in Latin / and would not say
in English / the Scotts come / and the people woste not what the watchman
said / and so were sodeinly taken of the Scotes / and were for the most part
killed / were he not a murderer / and were he not worthy to be hanged for his
labor? Even so / the parsone or bishop / that reads the scripture / wherein
are contained all words of warning of all men from all perilles in a strange
tongue, that the people understands not / as they do that say and sing these
good warning words of God in Latin / unto the unlearned people. Poenitentiam
agite apropinqua bit regnu^ coeloru^. Nisi co^uersi fueritis, gladisi vibrauit,
areu^ suu^ ^etendit and parauit illu^ Nisi quis renatus fuerit ex aqua and
spiritu, non potest videre regnu^ dei. Qui bona egeru^t ibu^t in vita^ eternal,
qui uero. etc. with such other like, if the people perish for lack of
understanding of the warning / he is a murderer / a thief and a Wolf.
Answer me I pray you what better are the parishioners for hearing of it
which they understand not.


Dean. Though the people understand not the scripture in Latin / yet God
understands it / and so they please him therewith / as s. Paul says: 1.
Corin.xiiij. he that speaks in a to^gn he speaks not unto men / but unto
God / for no man hears but in spirit he speaks mysteries. Lo here Saint
Paul aloweth that a bys hoppe or a pastor should speak unto God in a strange
tongue / for so is the word tongue / taken there, which thing yeseme to deny
whiles ye call them wolves and false prophets that speak unto god in a strange
tongue.


Hunter. It is true that he that speaks in a strange tongue speaks unto god
/ and I grant also that S. Paul does not condemn strange tongues / but ye can
not prove thereby that a person that speaks in a strange tongue / is thereby
discharged from preaching / and declaring of the will of god unto the people /
as for the tong^es / I love them as well as any Latin reading sacrificer in
England does / and I think that I have studied the tongues as much / as ye
have / and can paraduenture speak as many speeches as you can / therefore I
would you should not think that I do despise strange tongues / for they are
the gift of the holy ghost. But I say unto you that the tongus are not so
necessary unto the congregation / as the declaring of Scripture is / and that
tongues are not to be allowed in the church / except they be declared openly /
and that they vnexpounded / do no good at all unto the congregation / (although
he that will pray secreatlye in a tongue may do it well enough) this shall I
prove you by the same chapter of which you aleged your auctority. Saint Paul
says: he that prophecieth / that is / (he that expounds the scripture)
speaks buylding or edification unto the people / exhorting and comforting /
he that speaks in a strange tongue / builds or profits himself / but he
that preaches builds and profits the congregation. Out of the which words
of Paul / I gather plainly / that he that reads Latin in the English
Church / does profit no man but him self, and so might as well keep him at
home in his chamber / for any good that he does in the Church / unto English
men / that understand no Latin / as to come and read any latin there. Are not
these readers of Latin worthy to have such great liuinges as they have? I
gather also that expounding of the scripture / or preaching of gods word, is
the more excellent office and work in Christ's Church then reading is / then
how shall a priest be excused from doing the greater by doing fo the less?
and yet the less whereof we spoke / is not required of god at al in his church
although the Latin Pope requires / that all they that are members of his
Latin and Romish church with him / and namely all the priests after his order
/ should only read Latin in the Church in a remembrance that he is head of
all them that read latin in the church / and that he was the inbringer of
latin into all this part of Europa. The sa^e Paul says also, I will that
ye all speak with tongues but yet more that you should prophecy or declare
the Scripture / for he is greater that prophecieth / then he that speaks in
tongues / except he expaunde: that the Church may take some profit thereby.
etc. If a tromphet give an uncertain sound / who shall make himself ready to
fight? Even so likewise except ye give forth a speech that betokens
something: how shall it be understand that is said? and As often as ye come
together / every one of you has his tongue / he has his learning, he has his
revelation / he has his interpretation. Let all things be done to the profit
of the Chruch / whether a man speaks in tongues / let it be done by two or
three at the uttermost and that one after another / and let one expound or
declare / if there be no expounder, let him hold his peace in the Church / but
let him speak to him self and to God.

These words are not only Paul's / but also the holy Ghostes words / then if
ye will believe the holy ghost, no man ought to speak in any strange tongue /
except one enterpret or expoundit that is read or spoken / where upon it
follows / that all the pr^estes in England / that read Latin in the English
Church which understands no Latin if they expound not the same / break the
open commandment of God. Is it now like that god will allow Latin reading of
unlearned priests without any expounding of it that is read in an English
church / for his service / and a good work, which he expressedly forbids his
own self in expressed words? I for my part trow nay. And whereas ye say /
that though the common people understands no Latin / that god understands
it well enough / meaning thereby / that it is not necessary that the people
should vnderstant it that is read in the church / so that god understand it: I
ask you whether all that the priest reads in the Church is said unto god
alone / or to the people alone. If at be said to the people alone then is all
the labor lost that is bestowed in speaking of Latin unto them that
understand none. Or if part be spoken unto the unlearned people / that part is
also lost. If that all that is read in the church be said unto God (as ye
seem to mean, where as ye say that god understands latin well enough / though
the people understand it not) then say the priests unto god all these
sayings. Postula a me and dabo tibi gentes haereditatim tuam, seruite domino,
in timore, apprehendite disciplinam ne quando irascatur Dominus and peratis de
via iusta. Irascimini and nolite peccare, sacrificate sacrificium iusticiae and
sperate in domino, nisi conuersi fueritis, gladium vibrauit, and parauit illud,
non occides, non committes adulterium, ne veretis omnino. Vae vobis qui
saturati estis, quia esurietis, Vae vobis cum laudauerit vos omnes homines,
poenitentiam agite, appropin quabit regnum coelorum.

If the priests say these sayings unto god / is not this a preaty preaching*
or rather pratinge unto almighty god. If they say them in Latin unto
unlearned men, they are never the better / for hearing of those words that they
understand not / and so always the labor of the priest is lost whether he
exhort god to holiness / in a tongue that he understands / or he exhorts
men to vertuousnesse / by speaking of Latin to them, which understand not one
word of Latin / and therefore take no profit thereby. Therefore your reading of
Latin to god / helps nothing the congregation. Where as you say that your
bishops which are Chauncelers. Amners / and secular counselors, are as well
occupied as our prating preachers are, I think that ye dishonest the order of
Elders / and their* office also, and speak openly against the scripture / for
Christ said that Mary chosed the better part, which was occupied about the
word then Martha did / which was occupied in worldly matters / then your
bishops being occupied about worldly matters / are not so well occupied as our
preachers are / which prate not but preach the true word of god, as no
Massemonger is able to prove the contrary. Wherefore I marvel that ye dishonest
them with such a term / when as ye can not prove that ye lay unto their
charges. As for your Amners it is plain that they occupy but the office of a
Deacon / which is not to be compared to the office of an Elder and preacher?
and as for the other ioffices, god never commanded any bishop to be occupied
withal.

Think you that upon the day of judgment, when Christ shall say unto the
bishops: why have ye suffered my flock to perish for lack of feeding,
that he will approve and allow these excusations? I was an Ambassador, I was a
Chan^celer, I was a cou^seller. I was an Amner, or the Kings chaplain / and
therefore I could not tend my flock? I think nay because almighty god says:
if he command the shepherd to tell the wicked his ways, if he do not / that
he will require the blood of the wicked that perish, of the dumme prelates
hand / though they be never so well occupied in other worldly things / as
the world judges.


Deane. Although all the bishops and priests that preach not / were false
prophets (which I will not grant you) yet because a great number of the
bishops / and many persons and vicars preach, all the prelates and priests
of England be not wolves / and false prophets / as ye seemed a little while ago
to hold when as you said tht all the mass priests in England were wolves.


Hunter. Who can make him see / that will needs be blinder / I have brought
reasons / arguments, and auctorities enough to prove that they are all false
prophets and wolves / and ye can make no answer unto them, and for all that
ye will not consent unto the truth. As for your bishops and parsons that
preach (which are very few in comparison of the unpreaching number) I say that
their preachings which they preach / deliver them not from the right names of
wolves / but much more make them wolves / for he is not only a false prophet,
that comes into the sheep fold unsent, or if he be sent, preach not / but
also he is a false prophet that preaches other learning unto gods people /
then God has commanded him to preach ^ as are all the ordinances statuts and
laws of men, which either comfort men / where as god comfort not / or
discorageth men / where as god discorageth not / and this will I prove by diverse
open places of the scripture / Deuteronomy. 18. If any arrogant prophet will speak in
my name / those things that I commanded him not to speak / or in the name of
other gods he shall be slain. Hiere. 14. the prophets prophecy falsely in my
name, I sent them not / I commanded them not / neither have I spoken unto
them, they prophecy unto you a false vision / a deceitful prophecy / and the
deceiving of their own hearts. I tree. 23. ye shall not hear the words of the
prophets / which prophecye unto you / and make you fools / and speak it that
they see in their heart / and not it that comes out of the mouth of the
Lord / I have heard what the prophets / prophesying lies in my name / say /
they say we have dreamed we have dreamed.

How long shall this be in the hearts of the prophets to prophecy a ^ye, to
prophecy the deceit of their heart? whose drifte is to this end / that they may
drive my people to forgette my name / by the means of their dreams, which
every man tells unto his neighbor / even so as their fathers forgot my
name through Baal. Wherefore he that has a dream / let him tell it as a dream
/ and he that has my word let him speak my word faithfully / for what has
chafe to do with wheat. Ezechiel. 13 Son of Man / prophecye against the
prophets of Israel which prophecye / and say unto them which prophecye out of
their own heart. hear the word of the Lord so says the Lord god. Woe be
unto the foolish prophets which follow their own spirit when as they have
seen nothing. O Israel / thy prophets are made like Foxes in the wilderness /
ye have not gone up unto the burstinges, neither have ye made an hedge for the
house of Israel that ye might stand in the battle in the dai of the Lord /
they have seen vanitye, and lying prophecy / saying the Lord has said / when
as the Lord sent them not. Have ye not seen a vain vision / and have ye not
spoken a lying prophecy / saying / the lord says / when as I have not spoken.
Ezechiel. 22. The prophets daube the Princes with a foolish cruste / that is
to wit seeing vain things / and prophesiyng a lie unto them / saying so says
the Lord god. when as for all that the Lord has spoken nothing. Now have I
prouid / by the written word of god / that all they which speak any thing /
that god has not commanded them to speak / and preach any thing that / has
not commed out of gods mouth / are all false prophets But the Wolf of
Winchester / the loyterer of London / the dreamer of Durram / and all they that
in their preachinges say that it is unlawful for bishops or priests to
have wives / that it is not lawful to eat flesh in Lent by the law of god /
that a priest ought to have a shaven crown / a side gown an Albe and
vestiment upon him when he ministers the Lords Supper / that a bishop is
higher than a priest or elder by the law of god / that there ought to be
Images / Aulters, Crosses, Candels / Censures / Holy Water, Holy bread, Palms,
singing of Latin in the church / where the people understands no latin, that
Saints ought to be called upon / that we can help the dead with our prayers /
that there is no bread and wine in the Supper, after the priest have said
these five words. Hoc est corpus meum, that no man ought to be a minister /
except he be subdeacon and deacon before, and therewith have received benet and
co^let, and that no man ought to be admitted unto the order of a subdeacon.
deacon / or else an elder or priest / except he vow chastity before / preach
and say those things. which god never commanded them to say. Therefore I
gather that they are all false prophets, and therefore wolves / (because as I
said before) a false prophet and a Wolf are all one.


Dean. I think they are not so slenderly learned / but they be able to prove
/ that god has commanded them to say all these things which ye have rehearsed.


Hunter. If they can prove by the Scripture that god commanded them to say
and preach the above named things / doubtless they have other Scripture then we
have / but I know that they can not prove by the written word of god that god
gave them any commandment to say and preach these things, therefore I
will call them false prophets, until they can show their commission, that god
has commanded them to preach such doctrine.


Deane. What will ye do, if they can prove that they had commission of god to
preach so?


Hunter. I will cry them mercy and knowledge that I have erred. But because me
think ye will not believe that they are false prophets, for all my arguments
and places of the scripture alleged / I will allege another property or two
of a false prophet which they give / and they are these. To be earnest in
setting out of their one doctrine / and to be cold in setting forth of gods
expressed commaudement / and to break Gods commandment / that their
tradition or ordinance might be advanced or set up / to threaten great
punishment / where as god threateneth none, and to discorage men from it / that
god has earnestly commanded / and to flatter great men / and to suffer them to
do what they list / and so to maintain them in their wickedness / are the
properties of a false prophet. And that these are the properties of a false
prophet / I will prove it by diverse open places of the scripture. Christ in the
xv. of Matthew / lays unto the pharisees charge which were false prophets / that
they were so earnest in setting forth / and in keeping of their own traditions
and ordinances, that they not only not cared for the commandment of God,
but also brake the commandment of God / that their traditions migh be set
forth and kept of all men. The words of Christ are these: wherefore break ye
the commandments of God / for your tradition / they worship me in vain /
that teach lerninges which are the commandments of men. Mark in the vij.
Chapter. rehearses Christ's sayings thus: ye leave the commandment of God,
and keep the ordinance of men / as washing of cups and pottes / and many
other things do ye / like unto these. Ye cast well away the commandments of
God / that ye may set up your tradition. The bishops of England / and the
preachers there now / specially they that are in auctority / command the
people to creep unto the Cross / to take holy water and holy bread / to wear
beads / and to go in procession / to hear mass, to here mattins and euensong
in a tongue that they understand not, to set up candels, to lift up their
hands to bread and wine, to pray to Saints / to pray for the dead / to hear
the piping of the orgaines, and preach not the word of God / neither exhort
the people to worship God inspirit and truth / in commanding and preaching of
these / they are very earnest / but slow in setting forth the will and
expressed commandment of God. They repuire these so earnestly of the people,
and punish them so sore that break these / that they compel them to break
the open commandments of God / that these may be kept. Every holy day when as
the word of god should be preached / and the right Supper of the Lord should be
received, when the congregation should pray together in a common tongue / these
can not be exercised for the infinite number of popish toys / and trifles
which Gardener / with his garrison, have of late by open tirany against the
kings law and gods word violently thrust unto the church before the Kings law
was abrogated. Ezechiell also in the xiij. chapter writteth thus of false
prophets / which flatter the people and tell them not of their faults.
Because ye have spoken vanitye / and have seen a lie / therefore behold / I
the Lord God am against you / and my hand shall be against the prophets which
see vain things / and prophecye lies. They shall not be in the secreate of my
people / and they shall not be written in the number of the house of Israel,
neither shall they come into the land of Israel / and ye shall know that I am
the Lord God. Now for as much as they have begiled my people, saying peace
when as there is no peace / and when as the people bildeth the wale / and they
with their daubing cover it with a naughty crust / tell them that cover it with
an unprofitable crust / that it shall fall. I will overthrow the wall which ye
have pargetted and covered with a naughty crust / and I will dash it to the
ground.

And thou sone of man set thy face against the daughters of they people (lo
there were then as well she wolves as he) which prophecye out of their own
heart / and prophecy against them and say / thus says the Lord God. Woe be
unto them that sewe Cusshons under all elbowes of hands, and make bolsters for
the heads of every stature / to hunte for the souls o^ my people / that ye
may catch them / and shall ye quicken the souls of the people that come unto
you? Ye have dishonored me before my people for a handful of barley / and
lomps of bread / to kill souls which ye ought not to kill / and to quicken
souls to whom ye ought not to promise life / ye have made sad and sorrowful
the heart of the righteous with a lie / when as I made him not sorry / and have
strengtthened the hands of the wicked that he might not return from his evil
way / that he might be saved alive.

These are the words of God in Ezechiel whereby he describes one kind of false
prophets / and these words do agree with the manners of the bishops of England
/ therefore they are false prophets. The bishops and massaying priests of
England deceuie the people by saying that there is peace* when as there is none
/ when as they say that god is not angry with the people / that neither hears
the word of God / neither prays with the heart in the common place appointed
for prayer, and says it is sufficient if they hear mass and mattins / though
the two other things be not done Almighty God requires that there should be
no beggars amongst his people / he requires that no man shall put away his
wife, except it be for fornication / that no man shall take the name of god in
vain that rulers shall not polle and pill their subjects / that no man shall
banquet excessiuely / and be dronken / that no man shall do it that is the
cause and ground of evil / as are Dicing and Carding for money and such
Daunsing as is occupied in great men's houses and other places also / where
upon follows wantonness and letcherye. But the contrary is occupied / and
their diocesanes and parishioners ar a wale wherein al these faults be / that
are co^trari to the will of god. And yet they prech not against the^ neither
they about to mend it that is faulty in the wall / but daube and parget over
the wall, with Masses / Diriges / Letanies, reading without any profit /
creping unto the crosses / offering unto Idols / with Auricular confession,
with eating of fish upon the Friday and in Lent / and such other painted
poperye / the people being decked with this painted poperye / looked not to
amend their lives / but thinking that they are in peace with God, occupied
their accustomed naughtines / and at length come into everlasting damnation.
When as the collection and gathering was of late for the poverty / the papists
through out al England could not be brought to give the fourth part unto the
poor, that the gospellers gave, belike because they thought that they were
discharged from giving of alms / if they kept some money behind for the
priests / that should within a short while / in the long looked for day, say
mass and sing for them / these men were so pergetted with popestrie / and with
the outward show of holiness / that they thought themselves no more bound to
give any sufficient alms according unto the Scriptrue. But what marvel is it
if the common people think thus when of late a certain papist in an open
sermon, began earnestly to speak against the alms house / which was builded
and founded by the liberality of the citezins of the noble city of London. When
as Tunstal / Gardener / Stokslay / and the rest of the papists bare the swing
under king Henry the eight, they suffered the King and diverse Lords of the
realm to put away and take as many wives as they list / without any
correction or admonition. If that they had don their duty / the virtuous Lady
Anne of Cleue / had never ben deuorced and put away from the King her lawful
husband. There were four Lords in England / that put away their wives / not
for fornication, but because they liked hor^es better. Two were in Somerset
shire / and one in Northfolke, besides that a Knight in Somerset shire did the
like. Where as the liberalities of our fathers had given much goods lands and
riches to Abbaies that continual alms should be exercised there / and
preaching be maintained. King Henry the eight / with his covetous counsel
(which smarted afterward for their so doing) took all the goods of the
Abbayes which belongs for a great part as well unto christ's Church, as the
half of the goods of Ananias belonged unto the holy ghost after that he had
promised them unto the church / and spoiled the hole church and hole realm
miserably after such a fashion / that all the hole realm smarteth for it unto
this day. The Bishops and popish clergy / sewed cussons and bou^sters under
the Kings and Counsels elbowes and heads winking at these shameful deeds,
not caring how matrimony were defaced and broken / how the hole Church were
spoiled / so that they might have their pompus state to continue / so that they
might have the mass / with the evil favored heap of popish traditions
maintained and stablished The fame King spoiled again all honesty and gods
forbid / all the Bishops and persons of England of the first fruits of
their benefits / When they entered first into their offices / and took away
the tenthe part of the living of every minister / through out the hole realm
/ for ever. Were not these worthy watchmen? Nay were not these dumme doges?
were not these good sheepeheardes / that suffered Christ's flock thus so many
ways to be robbed and spoiled? Preached Gardener / Tunstall / and such
massemongers peace unto the King with god or war? peace. And at this day many
great men are in the court / and out of the court / which miserably vppresse
their tennants dice and card / keep hores and swear abominablye, and defile
themselves with glouttonye and drunkenness / pride / and with the foul vice
of covetousness. But who speaks against these vices? no body that I can
hear tell of. Therefore by their silence and holding of their peace / they sewe
cussons under their elbowes / and make bolsters under their heads, and for
lack of warning, quicken these whom they ought to have killed / with the two
edged sword called the law, and they have killed and condemned them that were
righteous / for eating of flesh on the Frydays / and for breaking of such
trifling toys of the Popes making whom they ought not to have discoraged and
killed / but rather comforted with the gospel and glad tydins that Christ
brought into the world. They have two things which do as much harm for
mamtenaunce of mischief as ever any sentuarye did in England / the one is
called the Mass / and the other is called Auricular confession. He that is an
horemo^ger / a robber / tyran / a common pillar of the people / a covetous
churl / a dicer / a carder / a blasphemer, or to be short / what so ever he be
/ or what so ever sinn^ or offense he do / if he fly unto these sanctuaries
he recompteth himself free from all punishment of god and is allowed of our
byshopes for a good and catholic man Diverse priests have confessed to me /
that they have bine hoar masters / and that they thought that by the merits
of the mass / and by the telling of their faults unto their brethren / that
their sins were taken away / and that afterward (as they had been sure of
sanctuary and of a souerain triacle) fell to their old folly again, and tasted
of the perellous prison of fornication. I report me now to all honest men
whether our Bishopes have the fore named properties / which God rekeneth in
Ezechiel to be the propertis of false prophets or no? I report me also to al
the^ that are not sworn bondmen and slaves unto Gardener / and his garrison /
whether this text written in the 22. of Ezechiel agrees unto these above named
bishops or no? The princes which are in the mids of Jerusalem / are as wolves
snatching unto their prays / to s^edde blood and to kill souls, and
couetouslye to follow after advantage / the prophets daubed them with an
unprofitable cruste / that was untempered / seeing vain things / and
prophesying unto the^ lies, saying thus says the Lord / when as the Lord has
spoken nothing. But lest I should condemn these for false prophets without
any cause / I will show you 3. other properties which belong unto a false
prophet / which all / there I shall find out in our massaying sacrificers, and
in their fathers the bishops. Esa / in the 55. chapter / rehearses covetousness
after this manner among the properties of a false prophet.

Those dogs are wonderfullye covetous / and they can never be filled / and
the pastors can understand nothing / and every man looks after his own
advantage. Luke in the 16. chapter calls the Pharisees / which were false
prophets covetous / now let us see whether our prelates are covetous or no.
The greatest wolf in Wells (the wolf is of Winchesters commissioners) has
one benefice in Holbernes and two in Somerset shire, he is residentiarye both
in Bristowe and Wells / and has three prebends, one in Weles / one in
Bristowe / and one in Salisburye / and paraduenture he has mo. Such as this
man is / may be found among the mass mongers a great sort mo / whom I know
not, because I am little in the company of such covetous carl^s that will never
be satisfied. Diverse Deanes / Prouosts / Chaunters / Subchaunters,
Chauncelours / and some Bishops, are so covetous and desirous to see gold / in
their days that they convey out of their successors hands / the best part of
the liuinges that should come unto their successors unto their kins folk,
and unto the^ that will give most for them. S24357.tech.take2.sgmase of Exceter
has so gredely desired money and friendship, that he conveyed all the hole
bishopric away from his successors, saving ccc.li. Boner of London /
because he would have some thing in hand in his life time / has chapped and
changed away no small part of his weds about London and certain other
co^moditis belonging to his bishoprike in London / or else there are liars.
Gardener of Winchester is not content with his byshoprik / which if he have it
hole / is worth at the least yearly four thousand marks. But to help to
fill his insatiable bags, to increase his glory / and to set forth his
heresy / must needs have the chaunceler ship of England also. The hole
rabble of Papists through out all the realm / is so covetous / that ye shall
very seldom find any in all England / that is a right shapen papist / but he
has three or four honest men's lyuings. As for glotony / which Esaias in the 28.
and 56. and Ezechiel in the 13 and 33 and Paul to the Romans the 16. and to
the Phillippians the 3. among all other properties of false prophets /
rehearses as one not of the least: may be found a thing daily occupied in the
cathederall churches / where as the Cannoues for a great part do nothing
else but serve their bellies. Look upon their cheeks and upon their
great paunches / and you shall find that they serve their God the belly /
veryefaithfully / A man that looks very will upon Bonor / would think that
he were not behind with his part. A another property of a false prophet is / to
be cruel and bloudthursty / as Jeremy in the 23. and Ezechiell in the 22.
chapter does bear witness. Have our prelates nothing to do with murder? I think
if ye will examine them well / we shall find them so blood thursty that for
all that property alone / they might not unworthily be called wolves and false
prophets. For besides that they kill the souls of their parishioners and
diocesanes / either for lack of the word of God / or else with the poisoned
bread of heresy and papestry / they kill diverse other ways, as in back
biting / belying / and slaundering of the true preuchers / and in killing the
bodies of the same. The Clergy of England killed Belney / Baynam, Bayfielde,
and A^tony Person, Mekens / Lambert and Phillips / with many other whose names
come not now in my remembrance But the wolf of winchester / for his part
alone / killed Barnes / Ierom / and Garret.

The city of London / the towns of Colchester / Braintree, and Chensfurth can
tell how many his fellow bloody Boner has killed. And now of late these
old murdering wolves which have been a great while hungrye in their dens:
when as they were broken lose (even as great Masties do more harm that are
commonly tied / when as they break lose / then other do that commonly run
abroad at liberty) have killed a grert sort in their minds and desires / and
have casten them into prison / that they may kill them in deed, as they have
killed them in thought / for if the casting of them into prison alone might
have killed them / there had none of them all been alive at this time / (as
perchance some shall perish for cold and lack of good keeping.) But because
the prison can not kill them all / as their desire is / they lay sedition and
treason unto their charges / that they may dispatch them the sooner, that way as
the old priests and pharisees handled Christ and his Apostles after him. For
when as the Maiestrats would not kill them for heresy and false doctrine /
the bloody Wolves laid sedition and treason unto their charges / as our Wolves
do at this time. Now when as Stephen Gardener / and Edmond Bonar, with the
other number of blood shedding by shoppes and priests, have the very same
properties / that the old false prophets and worrying wolves had / I see no
cause but I may lawfullye call them Wolves.


Deane The most part of the places / which ye have alleged as yet / are taken
out of the old Testament / which seems not to be of such force now in the
time of the new Testament / as they might be that are taken out of the new
Testamnt because the old Testament speaks many things in figures and tropes
/ which are hard to understand / when as the new Testament declares the old
/ and speaks all things without figurs wherefore if you will prove any thing
substantially / ye must prove it by the new Testament and not by the old.
Also the Bishops have not killed them that ye speak of / but the magistrates
and the kings officers.


Hunter. If that the alleging of the new Testament / will bring you to the
light of the truth I will allege it more largely / not withstanding, that I
alleged no trope nor figures / out of the old Testament but moral laws
which shall endure for ever. Also I have alleged diverse places out of the new
Testament, whereof even but one alone / had been sufficient enough to have gotten
credence / for that thing that I desired to be believed in. But to prove it
fully that I have taken in hand to prove: I shall prove that Gardener the
bishop of winchester, and al his fellows of that order that he is of / have
the properties of the false prophets that are spoken of in the newetestament.
Christ in the 7. of Matthew. says that false prophets go in Lambs clothing /
and inward are ravening Wolves. The massemongers of England / go in sheep
clothing / that is, they show great holiness in their outwart apparel, they have
four cornered cappes, to sinnifie that they go Este / west / North, and South /
to preach gods word (how be it their four corners may as well signify that
they have destroyed the four Evangelists, and in the stead of them set up
their own traditions) they have shaven crowns / to signify that their mind
is in heaven, and chat they care for no worldly thing. They have side gowns
and them commonly black / which be tokeneth sadness of manners / and mortifying
of their flesh / they have tippets about their necks / to betoken that they
have taken upon them the yoke of chastitye. They wear white Ratchetes and
surplesses / sometime above their other clothes, to signify the simplicity of
a Lamb, and the innocence of the same. But I have proved before that inwardlye
they are ravening Wolves, therefore these are the false prophets / that Christ
bad us beware of. Matthew the 15. and Mark the 7. declare that the property of
the pharisees which were false prophets / is to set up their own traditions /
and thereby to break and tr^ad down the commandment of God / which thing I
have proalready that our Bishops and priests both have done / and yet do
still. Christ in the x. of John makes all them thieves and mu^^erers that are
not sent by him but come in another way. I have proved already that all the
vnlearded persons in England came in another way then by Christ. And now I
say that all the only massaying prie^^es in England and that this kind of
elders priests or Apos^les, which take upon them to be higher in dignity /
then their fellow priests and apostles / and exercise lordship over them / are
not sent of Christ who made not one Apostle above another but gave them all
like auctority as the gospels in diverse places bear witness namely Mat. the 18.
and 20. Mark the ix. and x. Luke the 22. and in diverse other places. Where have
the massaying priests any word in the new testament* wherewith they are able to
prove that they are sent of Christ? no where I warrant you in all the new
testament. The new testament is in all places against this kind of
priesthood. Then when as neither the mass priests neither the proud lordly
bishops are sent of Christ / it follows that they are thieves and robbers /
and so false prophets and Wolves Christ in the 24. of Matthew describing the
salfe prophets that should come in the end of the world / says that they will
say / that Christ is here / and Christ is there / that he is in this pix and in
that pix / in this bread and in that bread / and so do Gardener with all his
sacramentary sacrificers.

Therefore they are false prophets that Christ prophesied of that should come in
the end of the world.

Paul where as he Prophecyeth in the former Epistle to Timothi / of the false
Prophets that should come in the latter times of the world / shows two
notable properties / whereby* they may be known. The former is / that they
should forbid marriage / and the Second is to forbid certain kinds of
meats, that god never forbad / these two properties have they now / whom I
call Wolves and false prophets / for Gardener and his fellow Bonar / will
allow no man to be an elder in Christ's church / except he first forswear
marriage / or make a solemn vow that he will never mary. As for the forbidding
of certain meats / at certain times / every man knows that they forbid
more earnestly the eating of certain meats / at certain times / then they
forbid swearing / or foreswearing / and single fornication / and that they
punish more grievously him that eats flesh in lent / then him that defiles
a man's daughter / or blasphemeth the name of God. Judas in his epistle
describing false prophets / among oiuers other properties / rehearses these
three. The first is that they are mocked in their dreams / and defile their
flesh. The second is / that they speak swelling words. The third is / that
they wonder and greatly regard persons for advantage sake. Whether the solemn
sort of winelesse sacrificers / are defiled in their dreams or no / the boys
that makes their beds / the prists that hear their confessions / and the
launderers that wash their sheets can bear witness against them. And yet they
will not use the lawful remedy that god ordained against such abominable and
stinking defiling of their bodies with the imagination of actual letcherye /
wrought by the devil in their dreams. As for proud words / Winchester and his
guard of papists they want none / for he (as though he had bin king) offered
in his own name, (as it was reported unto me) parden unto master Latimer / if
he would turn from his religion. How proud and loftly his communication was
to judge Hailes / they that were by and heard his talk can t^l. How flattering
he has bin always to the noble men / and how he has regarded persons for
advantage sake / all they know well enough / that have seen a great number
of gentelmens sons / knights sons / and lords sons / with him in service
with him at one time. Now have I proved by the open text of the new Testament
also that Gardinar / with all his garrison of mass mumbling merchants / are
wolves / thieves / robbers and false prophets. As touching that part of your
saying / wherein you would have excused the Bishops from murder / because (as
ye say) they killed not them that I rekened / but the kings officers: I say
that if our bishops and priests are not gilty of the blood of Bay nam /
Barnes / and Bayfeld, and the rest that were burnt in England / then were not
the scribes / pharsses and hye priests / guilty of Christ's death / because the
secular rulers put him to death. Said not the hye priests / we may not kill
any man / but we have a law / and according unto that, he must dye / The hye
priests / when Pilate asked them what they had to lay to Christ's charge /
answered and said. If he were not an evil man / we had not delivered him
unto thee. After the ame manner the priests of England with their hired slaves /
gave unto the shrife of London master Barnes and his fellows / and when Barns
asked the cause of his death / the shirife could show no cause at all / and so
might have well said as Pilate said unto Christ. Thy own country men and hye
priests, have delivered thee up unto me

And the shirife might have said unto the hye priests / I can find no cause of
death in him. But the hye priests were guilty of Christ's death and were the
murderers of him / whiles they said we have a law and according unto that the
must dye. And even so was Stephen Gardener / Edmund Bonar with the rest of the
hye priests / of England / the killers and murderers of doctor Barns, and of
all them that were burned in England / for holding with Gods holy word /
whiles they said that they were heretics / although the lay men against their
wills / were feign to be their tormentors and hangmen. Now have I proved both
by the new Testament and old / that all the mass priests and bishops of
England / are wolves and false prophets. The same may be proved also by the
Poets and Philosophers for they have the properties that Poet and Philosophers
give unto wolves / it is a common proverb amongst learned men. Homo homini
lupus, a man is a Wolf unto a man / that is / one man kills another /
therefore he that is a kilier of his brother / as Gardener is / may well be
called a wolf. The property of a Wolf is / that if a man see the wolf before
the Wolf se the man / that then a man shall not be dumme. But if the wolf see
the man before the man see the Wolf / then is the man by the sight of the
wolf made dumme / or at the least so horse that he can scarcely speak. I
report me unto all the honest men England / whether that gardener / coming
hastelye out of the Tower his de^^e unlooked for / made an hundredth men dumme or
no? within xiiij. days? I saw him of late but through a little hole for fear
that if he had seen me / as I saw him / he should have made me dum too / by
casting me into prison / where as no man could hear my voice / as he handled
a great sort of my brethren of late. An other property of a wolf is / when he
is mad / (for he is some time mad as a dog is) by his teeth to pour into the
man that he byteth / the same ve^^^^e and poison that he has and if the man
be not healed within a short while after that he is bytten / he becomes as
mad as the Wolf was that bote him / and plaieth the Wolf both in bytting and
crying after the manner of a wolf. The wood Wolf of Winchester about 8. or 9.
years ago / bote with his poisoned teeth / doctor Crome / and doctor Shaxton /
whereof the one doctor Crome / seeking remedy betime / was helped from the
woluish poison and madness. But Shaxton deferring to long has now the same
poison that Gardener had / and speaks as like the wolf of Winchester / as
any Wolf in England does / if it be true that I have heard tell of late.
Therefore I may call all the other massemongers in England Wolves / by the new
Testament and old / and Gardener by the sam / a Wolf / and by philosophye
also / both a wolf* and a wood or a mad Wolf.


Foster. The reasons which ye have made (as me think well grounded upon the
scripture and natural reason) make me believe that we have mo woulues in
England / then good sheep heardes.


Hunter. If there be so many Wolves as ye seem to grant that there are / where
as one wolf does more harm then ten thousand sheep do / me think that ye
should do wisely and well for the common wealth of England / if ye put up a
byl in the parliament* house / for the destroying of the exceeding number of
Wolves. There was an act of parliamente made for the destruction of Rookes,
which destroyed the corn, that only fed the body of man Why should there not
now an act of parliament be made / against the intolerable number of Wolves /
which not only burry and suppress the seed of gods word / and destroy it for
a time wherewith man's soul ought to be fed: but also kill men's bodies by
open tyranny.


Foster Let us hear your judgment how this matter might be brought to pass.


Hunter. Ye must in making an act for this matter follow a good physician /
which not only / heals the present disease that vexes the sick man / but
after that he has healed him / geaueth counsel and appoints him a diet / as
if he will keep it / the sick shall not fall in his old disease again. Even
so must you play the phesitians unto your mother the commonwealth of England /
ye must not only deliver England of these wolves that ye have now / but
also provide that when as these are gone / there rise no mo of the same sort in
their places afterward.


Foster. How would ye rid the realm of all these? would ye kill them all /
or banishe them out of the land?


Hunter. I would not kill them / althoughte I know well that some of them
would kill me. But me think it were well done / first to put all the popish
bishops of England down, and to assaye if all these that are now Wolves both
bishops and other / might be brought to right sheepeheardes. Those that
would be right sheepeheards / I would that they should continue in the office
of sheepeheards / and that they should be much made of / and have their
liuinges increased / if they wear not great enough But I would on the other
part / that all they / that will not part from their woluishnesse / should
either be banished out of the realm / or else that al their teeth should be
pulled out / and put out of office and casten into the Tower / least they
should do any more harm abroad.


Foster. But when as all these are either banished / or else put out of office /
and put up in cages / how will ye provide that we shall have no more Wolves
in time to come?


Hunter. First ye must provide that there be more schools in England / and that
there be better provision for the S24357.tech.take2.sgmniuersities / that the
realm may have enough scollers that are learned to make shepeheardes of. And
then must ye provide through out all England, that every parson and vicar have
an honest living able to find an honest man. Or else a well learned man / which
has cost his father and other friends very much money, and has taken long
and great pain for his learning / will lever be a curtier or a carter / then
a poor beggarly parson or vicare / and not to have where with to buy him
books, and to find him and his household withal.


Foster How is it possible to bring it to pass / that in every parish in
England / shall be living enough for all the sheepeheards that are there? And if
there be not sufficient lyuings in all places for the pastors / then after your
reasoning there shall always some Wolves remain namely there / where as (as
it were in a wilderness) the sheepeheardes which should drive away the
Wolves, can get no living.


Hunter. This may be brought to pass thus. Let all the Parsonages and
S24357.tech.take2.sgmicarages / and all pensions and other like things /
which at any time have belonged to any parish church are now taken away /
by what so ever means be restored unto the parish churches again / that the
pastors may have to live on / whether they be in gentelmens hands / or
bishops / or belong unto Cathedral churches / or belong to the Queen or any
other Person within the realm of England, or Ireland. And if this would not
serve / I would the fourth part of the bishops lyuings, should be given to
the pastors to make them up honest liuinges withal.


Foster. It shall be more easy to pull out the mace out of Hercules hand / then
to get the fat parsonages out of their hands, that have them now.


Hunter. Al they that are right mass hating gospellers / which defy Simonie /
and would have the wolves out of England / would be glad to depart with such
livings as they hau bought by ignorance / not knowing that the Pope had
stolen / nay rather robbed and taken by tyranny all such liuinges from
Christ's church / as he has given to his couled Cannons and hodeded papists,
It will be hard to get them out of the mass loving gentelmens hands which have
such an opinion in the Pope / that they think that he had auctoritye to rob
the Pastores of their liuingse, and to give them unto his carnal Cannons, or
unto mumbling Monks and to whom he list.

But if these church robbers (for so I call them that bye that thing which they
know is stole^l from Christ's church / and will not deliver it up unto the
church again that which they have bought and received of that robber the Pope)
will not restore them again: let them be compelled thereto by an act of
parliament or if ye be to weak in the parliament house to compel them / then
let all the rest of the Church excommunicate them / and take them for thieves
/ and church robbers. When as the Church is restored unto her right again /
if that they that have the patronages and gifts of benefits / might give them
to who^ they list / then would they for money set in wolves as they had wont to
do of late / and so were we in as evil c^ase almost / as we were in before.
Therefore all they that have any patronages or gifts of benefices / must give
them up unto the churches to whom / the prese^tation and chosing of their
pastors does belong. For I read that this auctoritye that gentelmen and
Bishops have now / came from the Pope, who granted always the gift of the
benefice unto him that either builded the Church / or suffered it to be
builded on his ground. In the primative Church the hole congregation chused
the pastors / and that by voices / and some time by lottes / as ye may see in
the first of the Acts of the Apostles / and in the xiiij In the first of the
acts Matchias and Joseph were presented / or set up by the hole church / and
Matthias was chosen / by the falling of the lottes. In the xiiij. of the acts
the Apostles with the church made elders in every congregation by voices. And
in the primative church this matter was long kept / as both old storieo and
ancient writters bear witness.


Foster. The common sort of people / is a wyld beast with many heads, therefore
if the people should have the chosing of their pastors / we should not only
have many mad pastors, but some time great fightting.


Hunter. The common people in deed / which is not endued with the spirit of
God / is as it were a wyld beast with many heads. But the common people which
is baptized in the name of Christ / and has the spirit of God / is more like
to choose an honest shepeheard / then a blind bishop or covetous carle / that
will let no man have the benefice / except he pay much for it. For god made a
promise unto the Church and unto the common people / but not unto this bishop
or that bishop / to this gentilman and that gentilman. When the common people
had the auctority / and presenting and choosing of pastors / there were a great
deal of more / and more honest pastors / then there has been sense that time
that one bishop or one gentelman chused / presented or set up / the pastors /
or sheepeheards as they do now a days. To whom was this said? I shall be
with you unto the end of the world? The bishops and gentilmen only / or to
the hole Church? If it were made unto the hole Church / then have not Bishops
and gentilmen this promise alone / except they be joined with the Church. Then
when as they be sondered and parted from the church / they have not this
promise of the holy ghost* Wherefore it is not wonder that we have so many evil
pastors / where as there are such holy gostles presenters / chusers and benefice
geuers. But lest there should be found any among the Christians, which would
fleshly after friendship choose such pastors that were naught: it were not amiss
after that all the old liuinges were restored / unto the church again that in
every parish / certain of the godliest and wisest men / should be chosen /
which should not only choose and present up pastors to be admitted / but also
be joined with the pastors in excomunication / and dealing the alms of the
Church / to the poverty of every parish. And I would that every little
parish should have seven such at the least, and every mean church.xiij. and
every great church xxiij. If these had the same auctority of choosing, and
presenting of pastors / that now bishops and gentelmen have: I doubt not but
that we should have a great deal fewer wolves in the realm then we now have.


Foster. If that ye would have no such Bishops as we now have / and that all
pastors should be a like and none above another, when the pastore is dead /
who shall admit the new pastore to his office / and who shall judge whether he
that the church presents be worthy to be allowed or no?


Hunter. As the Apostles had auctority to allow and admit elders in their time /
so is it meet that they that are the successors of the Apostles now / have
the same auctority and for the avoiding of confusion / and for the maintenance
of good order / I would that in every little shire in England should be at the
least 4. bishops I mean no mitred nor lordly / no rachetted bishops, but
shuch as should be chosen out of the rest of the clergy every year / and not
for ever / which should be honest learned men / preachers / and graduates / if
so many could be found. I would that these should have auctoritye to remain
and admit all the elders that shall be set up / and chosen through out all the
hole dioceses / and that they should have / all such auctoritye in all matters
of religion / and the ecclesiastical government / as the late lordly and
ponpouse bishop had. And specially to admit lawful ministers / to dispose and
put down naughty ministers / to examine heretics / and to appoint punishment
/ not only for the clergy that offends / but also for the common people
doing any offense / worthy any ecclesiastical punishment / reserved always
aucthority to excomunicate / to every pastor with the elders of the Church
within his own parish / and that only for such matters / as the sciptur would
that men should be excommunicated for. These bishops must be chosen by the
voices of all the pastors in the shire, and as for the number of them / if the
dioses be great / there may be half a dosen or mo / as it shall be thought
expedient unto the Lords and knights of the parliament / for the glory of God
/ and the profit of the church.


Foster. If this might so be brought to pass: I think that we should have
fewer wolves / then we now have / and perchance none at all But what would
ye do with all the bishops lands / and with all the cathederallchurches in
England? it appears that ye care not for the cathederal churches what should
be come of them.


Hunter. I would that the bishops lands should be denided into 4. parts whereof
I would wish that the first part, should be given to a mende preachers livings.
The second part to set up schools / and to find scollers in the vniuersicies.
The third p^^te to find the bishops that I have spoken of before.

The fourth part to repair Churches with all / and to reliue and help the
pouertye of the dioses and to repair hye ways with all / within the same shire
or dioses. And as touching the cathederall churches / as they are now used /
they are nothing else but dens of thieves / nestes for Wolves / spies for fet
hogs / ba^ketting houses for covetous glotons / that for sparing of money at
home without shame, thruste themselves into cannons houses. Wherefore it made
little matter so that all the other things were done / that we spoke of before
/ if they were all quite put down / so that they were put to better uses.


Foster. As far as I perceive if ye were in the parliament house again / ye
should earn but small thank / of the Queens husbands / for ye give in all
your dealinges / nothing unto the Queen.


Hunter. What mean you by the Queens husbands / I wot not what you mean.


Foster. Of late years certain spoiling unmerciful and churlishe officers
were under king Edward whereof some be now alive and serve Qeene Mary at this
time / Which when as they were desired to be good unto very poor men / ever
answered / we that are in office under the king, must be husbands to the king
/ and provide that he have always more and more / and that he lose nothing /
when as they rather sought their own profit then the kings honor / and his
durable profit.


Hunter. I was once in a great man's chamber to see how he did when he was
sick and because he heard tell that I would have had all the chauntries in
England so bestowed / as I would now have the bishops lands bestowed / he
desired me to be good unto the King / at the which saying came unto my mind,
an old saying. Qui pro alio orat, pro se ipso laborat. He that prays for
another man / laboreth for him self. If that the Queens good husbands / would
have me geaue some part of the church goods unto her / perchance for that
intent that they might have some part thereof with the Qeene as it it chanced
often in King Henris time, and king Edwards time / they were very noughty men for
is not that a shameful wickedness, to make their master / or masters / commit
the abominable vice of S^^^oni / that they might thereby be the richer As
touching the Queens part / as I would take nothing from her that belongs of
right unto her: so will I not give her it / that belongs unto God and his
congregation.


Foster Ye have forgotten to tell to what uses you would have the cathedral
churches put to.


Hunter. The personages and vicarages and other parts of pastors livings
restored unto the pastors again. I would that the rest of all the lands should
be thus bestowed / let there be in every cathederale church.vi. or.viij.
or.xii. preachers / according unto the lands of the church / whereof every
one should have.L.ii. to find him with all / let the rest of all the lands be
spent upon reders / and scholars and students both in gramer / and humanity,
and also in divinity.


Foster. If all the abbaies in England / and chauntre lands had bin thus
bestowed / I think verily that the Queen should have bine much ritcher then
she now is / and that the realm should have been better provided of learned men
/ and godly ministers / then it now is. And that the vengance of God should not
have fallen upon this realm / as of late has done don.


Hunter. To make an end of our communication / because we are near to our
lodging where as we shall rest all night. I think that if these things were
done that I have rehearsed / we should not only be rid of all the Wolves that
are now in England / but we should be free from wolves in time to come.


Foster. I am afraid that in our days these things that ye have devised / for
the driving away and holding out of Wolves / out of England / shall not come
to pass.


Hunter. If they do not come to pass / then must we have wolves still, and
where as wolves be, there must the poor sheep be rent in pieces. Therefore if
these devises be not received and followed / and embraced, Christ's little poor
flock / must needs be torn and rent in pieces / as it has bine continuallye
these many hundredth years / saving only in the reign of king Edward the sixte
/ when as all the Wolves which are now co^^^ned abroad, were feign to hiede
them in their dens


Foster. There is no other like but there shall be great murder of sheep / but
what remedy.


Hunter. None but these, either to play the wolves with the wolves or else to
fly out of this co^trye / to such a country where as is no wolves in / as here
are like to be.


Foster. That is true, therefore let every man provide for himseffe betime.


Hunter. Even so intend I to do as soon as I can / far ye well.


Foster. God grant that we may meet merye together after the end of the
parliament.


Hunter. Amen.
