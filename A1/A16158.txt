The complaint of a sinner, vexed with pain, Desyring the joy, that ever
shall remain.
After W. E. moralized.
THe God of love, that sits above,
Does know us, Does know us,
How sinful that we be:
Sent his word, the two edged sword
To show us, To show us,
Our sin and iniquity.
That every vice may vanquished be,
Oh Lord arise for thy mercy
Do this our God and bynd us,
For ever and ever thine own:
The truth will always find us,
By the seeds that we have sown.
The truth will tell if we would lie,
The touchstone does y^ tree well try.
And as we have a soul to save,
Uprightly, Uprightly,
Though troubled still with sin:
We should not take, that did us make,
So lightly, So lightly,
This worldly wealth to win.
But if we will the Lord provoke
We may look for his heavy stroke,
As his word has appointed
The Scripture does plainly tell:
Yet shall not his holy anointed
Once taste the pains of Hell.
Now have I told the ^eoperdy,
But Christ is our just remedy.
With woeful hearts though god forbeares
To plague us, To plague us,
We ought for to lament:
Thy word always, both night and day
Persuade us, Persuade us,
Inwardly for to repent.
And every one to call for grace
Since the touchstone in every place,
Does flourish fresh and shine
That the whole world may see:
And all that will be thine,
Must come with tears to thee.
We will not boast our merits Lord,
Since thy dear son made the accord
We read of old, what Prophets told
full truly, Full truly,
And wrote it long a^go:
A Maiden myld, should bear a child
Full duly, Full duly,
And it proved even so.
But yet God wot, the Jews of kind
Believed it not, but were still blind,
And are unto this day
Refusyng the Triumphant truth:
That the Prophet Esaye did say
And wrote it to age and youth.
But thereto they would not accord,
But cruelly crucified the Lord.
But let us now, both bend and bow,
And speed us, And speed us,
To follow the true trace:
For he has sent, his Testament,
To feed us. To feed us,
And call us unto grace.
Un worthy now although we be
Yet ye see how his dear mercy,
To us be does ^^^ll give
Ano liberal gy^tes us send:
That we might sure believe
And our le wde lives amend.
Therefore let us our hearts enclyne,
That pearls be not cast unto swyne
The flesh (I say) both night and day,
Does hold us, Does hold us,
From followyng the true trace:
But thy dear son, does bid us come,
And bold us, And bold us,
To call to thee for grace.
Thus says our savior Jesus
Come unto me, and I will ease you*
If ye will call and knock
That are over laden with sin:
Then will I open the lock
And be ready to let you in.
For I am he that bought you dear,
Therefore behold, and draw ye near.
