TREATISE OF THE ECCLESIASTICAL HIERARCHY. BY NICHOLAS SMYTH.

In a Religious State, a man lives more purely, falls more rarely, rises more
speedily, walks more circumspectly, dies more confidently, and is rewarded more
abundantly.

TO MY WORTHY FRIEND Mr. A. M.
SrR, your letter contained a request, which I must needs say, was to my taste,
bitter-sweet. It could not but be pleasing, as proceeding from your self; and
yet the quality of it, to my disposition, could not but seem bitter. Your them
und was, that I should give a brief Censure in general, and make some
observations, upon such particular passages, as might seem to need
explication, in M. Doctor Kellison his Treatise, of the Ecclesiastical
Hierarchy. You know the natural antipathy of my complexion, with such
businesses, as may have any face of Controversy; besides the want of many
helps, requisite for such an employment. Nevertheless, I have submitted my
judgment, and will, to your Command, and do here present you with such
notes, as I have gathered: professing not to have set down, all that occurred
to my mind: and to say the truth, I was willing to believe the best, and for my
own ease, to omit the examine of some passages, which yet I might suspect
would have given just advantage. I doubt not but some more diligent, and exact
pen will supply my defects. The method I hold, is to reduce all to certain
heads, or Questions, out of which may easily be drawn answer, to the
particulars; for it had been a tedious business, to answer M. Doctor, line for
line. Yet to the end the Reader may know, where to find the answer of every
particular, my seventh Question is employed, in a survey of M. Doctors book,
chapter by chapter, pointing in what Question of mine, every chapter, and
number of his, is answered. If this my labor do not satisfy your expectation,
yet I doubt not but my endeavor will be the more grateful, in that for your
sake, I have done my best. And so, you will remain the more assured, that
without any exception I am wholly

Your humble servant in Christ Jesus Nicholas Smyth.

AN ADVERTISEMENT TO THE READER.
BE pleased (gentle Reader) to know that the Author of this Discussion, while
he lived, was wholly against the publishing thereof. But he being departed to a
better life, the lay gentleman, a worthy, and virtuous Catholic, at whose
request it was written, and whom the Author by reason of distance could not
satisfy by word of mouth, finding M. Doctor Kellisons Treatise, to be much
dispersed, among all sorts of persons, many of which are not able of
themselves, to judge of some points therein contained, as they deserve, caused
it, as thou see, to be printed, for the right information, and common good of
Catholics in England.

THE FIRST QVESTION. What judgment may be framed of M. Doctor his treatise in
general.
1. MY meaning is not to set down what Ce^sure others, even Secular Priests,
to my certain knowledge, give of M. Doctor his book, because my desire is to
give noe offense. My own opinion, with d^e submission to better judgment, may
be reduced to the ensuing considerations.

2 It may justly seem strange, why M. Doctor should, at this very time, write
against Calvin, concerning an argument in these days not particularly spoken
of, and already most learnedly, copiously, and eloquently handled by diverse,
both in Latin, and vulgar languages: especially seeing men do not in M.
D^^tour b^oke discover any thi^, s^^g (...), ^o^ (...), or manner, and altho^gh
here ^ere something more the ^o^di^^^ry, yet the ^ooke co^ld not be pu^ into
the h^ds of any her^ticle for his conu^^sion, v^lesse (...) would have him
sc^n^dized, by sor^i^es of more vn^^erfull disse^tion, then ^^^^ed th^^e is.
And as for C^tholickes, they have no need to be confirme^ in the belief of
the Ecclesi^^^ic^l Hierarchy: Wherefore it is easy to f^ll upon the tr^e mot^^e
of his writing, that if he had uttered what he me^nt he should have chaged the
title, and instead of (Against Calvin) put Against some other Persons, who^ he
thought good not to name.

3 And whatsoever he speaks of Charity, in his Epistle, and through his
book, yet he could have given no greater blow against that virtue, then by
being the first to print a treatise, in the English tongue, which every
unlearned person might understand, and to which he could not but expect
answer, whereby it would be almost impossible some office should not either be
given, or taken, and with return of new answers, and replies, Charity more,
and more indamaged.

4 This treatise has renewed, that no less improfitable, then odious
comparion, betwixt the perfection of Secular Pastors, and that of Religious
men: whereas it were to be wished, that men should rather be careful to perfect
themselves in their several callings, then wax curious in co^paring them with
others.

5 If Regulars printed any book, it was in latin; upon a necessary occasion;
for their own defense; concerning one particular point: the contrary of ^ll
which circumstances concu^re in M. Doctor his treatise. It is not (M. Doctor)
believe me, the way to maintain charity is not, to labor in writing of
books, in the English tongue, with dedicatory epistles, full of verbal
exhortation to charity, but the true way requires no more pain^s, then only to
let Religious men alone, with those privileges, of which for so many years
they have had peaceab^e poss^ss^^^, and in practice whereof they have
faithfully l^boured, and many of them in sw^^t of their b^oud, by g^o^ious
M^^tyrdome.

6 It would also much au^u^ toward the conservation of charity, if all
Superiors, and Preside^ts of Seminaries, were effect^^^lly ^arefull, that
their subjects speak of Religious me^ with due respect, and Charity. Heli
though for his own person, 1. Reg. 1.
a man of comm^ndable life, yet he was not free fr^ blame, in not correcting
his Children, othe^wise then in a cold remiss manner as if he had been half
consenting to their misdemeanour, whereby men were auerted from the Sacrifices
of God; as S. Thomas avouches, S. Thom. 2.2. q. 184.^7.8.
Religion to be the most perfect of all Sacrifices, an Holocaust.

7 This treacise cannot ^e pleasing to the Holy Sea Apostolic, from whence it
had bin good ma^ners for us to learn, what is by Christ's i^stitution necessary
for Gods Church ingeneral, and expedient in particular concerning our having a
Bishop in England. But to tell every man, and woman, in a language understood
only by those who ought to obey (and which could not serve for information of
those who were to be our Vmpiers) that it is a divine commandment to have a
Bishop in England, is but to lead men into temptation of disobedience (in case
his Holiness should ever put in prctaise the contrary) and of condemning the
judgments, and facts of so many learned, and holy Popes, who for diverse years,
deemed it nether necessary, nor expedient togrant us a Bishop.

8 The greater, and better part of English Catholics will be nothing well
contented with this book, wherein they are plainly enough taxed of want of
Charity, and Obedience, in not being so united, and subordinate to my Lord of
Calcedon, as it seems M. Doctor thinks they should. They are also in effect
condemned of mortal sin, by refusing so long time a Bishop, against the law
of God, and for being occasion, on their parts, that our country wanted the
Sacrament of Confirmation, which, according to M. Doctor, is so necessary in
time of persecution, that neither any country, Chap: 14^.^.
nor any one of the country, for fear of persecution, can oppose against the
coming in of a Bispop, though thereby only the Sacrament of confirmation
should be wanting, auouching moreover al those who have not had the Sactament
of Confirmation not to be perfect Christians, which is a saying by him more
then once repeated, but how true it is, I hope, the reader will be able to judge
by what shall be said in the follo^wing questions, as also how little probability
his other reasons carry for euincing the necessity of a Bishop in England.

9 Neither can my Lord of Chalcedon much like this book, wherein the reader
will find some passages by me noted, whereby my Lord his Ordmariship is quite
demolished, and other authority by him pretended, either extenuated, or made
odious, and dreadful to Catholics.

10 It cannot be pleasing to Almighty God, to treat of holy things upon
particular design, and humane respects. For I know not how devotion is
lessened even toward sacred things, when they are commended by exaggeration,
and for some private end, as in this treatise M. Doctor does extol Episcopal
dignity above Religious state, urge the necessity of Confirmation, praise the
Secular Clergy, and enforce the obligation of having a Bishop, much more then
according to true deuinity he could, and more then, I fear, he would have
done, if all mortal men were as free from emulation, as the Saints in heaven.
And as he has written of the Hierarchy, so perhaps we shall in ty^e see some
printed treatise of the Sa^rament of Confirmation, and the general ambiguous
speeches of some ancient Fathers, or the particular opinions of some few
deuines, misapplyed for the necessity of that Sacrament, or in proof that it
cannot be administered but by a Bishop, or some such like subject, and business.

11 As for the manner hel^ by M Doctor in proouing his Tenets, I fear it will
not correspond to that opinion which has been conceived of his learning: and
in truth excepting those points which all Catholics believe, there is no one
thing in his whole book, which will put a man to study for the answer.

12 Against all good Logic, and as it may seem, against pr^dence, he
proves his conclusion by principl^s more harsh, and incredible, then the
conclusion it self. For example, to prove the necessity of a Bi^hop in
Eng^and he serves himself of these strange, and untoward propositio^s: That
it is de iure diui^^, a divine Law for every such p^rticular Church, as England
is, to have a B^^hop: That without a Bishop England cannot be a pa^ticular
Church: That unless every ^^rticular Church have is Bishop, or Bishops, the
whole, and Universal Church should not (as Christ has instituted) be a
Hierarchy composed of diverse particular Churches: That without a Bishop we
cannot have Confirmation, which whosoever wants is not as M. Doctor says, a
perfect Christian. All which principles are worse then the conclusion, and are
by us demonstrated to have no ground at all.

13 He still does not aright compare Religious with Secular Priests, always
reduplicating Religious, as Religious, but never ^ecular, as Secular. For
example he says, that Religious, as Religious have not authority to preach,
govern the Church, or the like, but never tells us, whether Secular, as
Secular, can do it, as certainly they cannot, till authority be granted the^,
which being granted also to Religious, they may perform the same actions no
less then Seculars, as in due place shall be declared. In other points likewise,
he speaks, not so distinctly as a scholar would expect.

14 But the thing at which I most wonder, in a man of his learning, is that
those Fathers, and school Deuines, which he produces for witnesses of his
doctrine, are indeed against himself, S^^ quest. ^.3.^.
as the reader will see in his allegatio^ of S. Cyprian, S. Clement, Sotus,
Ba^nes et^.

15 Lastly, I desire the reader to be still carefully observing throughout his
whole treatise, that whereas he makes profession to abstain from the main
question, betwixt my Lord of Chalcedon, and others, and further affirms in
his fiftenth chapter number. 10. that my Lord can challenge no Bishopric, no not
so much as the poorest parish in England: And whereas likewise my Lord of
Chlacedon by his Breife of Delegation was to have no power in England, or
Scotland, till his arrival in those Kingdoms, and then only over Catholics,
and as long as his Holiness should think good; all which are manifest
arguments, that he is not Ordinary, as other Bishops in Catholic countries
are, who although they should never set foot in their own Diocesses, yet they
have true Ordinary power over both Catholics, and Heretics within such
diocesses, and are Ordinaries both personarum, et loci of persons, and place,
both in fore interno and extern^, and that not only ad been placitum, but
permanently, as always in the Church of God some Ecclesiastical princes must
be: Notwithstanding, I say, all this, yet the arguments by which M. Doctor
would prove the necessty of a Bishop in England, either proo^e nothing at all,
or else more then he himself in^endeth, or my Lord of Chalcedon chall^geth
(namely that he must have authority ^lso over heretics; that he may lay
claim to some, or all the Diocesses in England, as well as to that of
Chalcedon; that he must not be only ad beneplacetum etc.) and ^o M. Doctor
must be forced either to arswere his own arguments, or else both contradict
himself, and tax his Holiness, as having not yet sufficiently provided for
the Churches of England, and Scotland: because the Institution of Christ, the
practice of the Church, the decrees of Canons, the sayings of ancient Fathers,
the doctrine of all Catholics concerning the necessity of having some Bishops
in Gods Church, concern Ordinary Pastors, and Prelates, in the proper sense
about mentioned, and not Delegates in an extraordinary manner. And therefore,
as I said, M. Doctor must defend himself against his own arguments. But
least I may seem to wrong so learned a man, I desire the reader not to give me
credit till in the following several Questions, he find by particulars, the
truth of what I have delivered in general.

THE SECOND QVESTION. Whether without a Bishop here can be a particular Church.
1 M. Doctor in diverse parts of his treatise does teach, that without a Bishop
there can be no particular Church, and in his 14. chapter, where he
endeavors to prove, that a particular courtry may not refuse Bishops, by
reason of persecution, one of his maine arguments is nu^. 9. because without a
Bishop there can be no particular Church; and thence deduceth, that Catholics
of England, all the while they had no Bishop, were no particular Church, and
shall no longer be a particular Church, then they shall have a Bishop, but
shall be a flock with out a Pastor, ^^army without a General, a ship without a
Pylot, a speritualkingdo^ without asperitualking, a family without a Goodman of
the house.

2 This assertion he proves out of S. Cyprian, who says: Cypr. ep^^. 69. ad
(...).
that the Church is Sacerdo^i plebs adunata, et Pastori suo grex (...) ar^us,
the Churches the people vrit^d to the Pre^^^ (Bishop) and the flock adhering
^^to its P^^^our. In the sime place M Do^to^^ a lioy (...) this reason, that as
the ^h^le Church has me supre^me Bishop to govern it, so ^^^ry particular
Church must have its Bishop (...) Bishops else it should not he a particular
Church, and so the whole, and vn^^^ sa^^ Church should not (as Christ has
instituted) he a Hierarchy composed of diverse particular Churches.

3. Three thing; I will endeavor to perform. First, that the alleged words
of S. Cyprian, upon which M. Doctor does so maynely, and extremely often
insist, make nothing against us, but rather are for us, against himself, and
with all, that his application of them may seem injurious to English
Catholics.

Secondly, I will de nonstrate that England without a Bishop, may, and has
been a particular Church, and that the contrary assertion must both wrong the
Sea Apostolic, and can subsist upon no better ground, then by heretics is
wont to be objected against the said holy Sea. Thirdly, I will show, that
although we should freely grant what M. Doctor assumeth (that without a Bishop
we cannot be a ^^rticular Church) ^et it could not prove hi^ ^^ent, (...)
particular country may not rosuse Bish^ps by reason of persecution.

4 For the first, it might be answered in a word, that S. ^^pr^m does not
define the Church to be the people united, and the flock adbering to a
particular Priest, and Pastor, but only in^iffi^itely to the Priest, and
Pastor, which is verified, as long as we have for our Bishop, and Pastor the
Pope of Rome Besides, S. Cypria^ speaks of Ordinary Pastors with power over
both places, and persons, Catholics, and here^icks^permanently, and not only
ad b^neplacitum, and therefore by a Delegate (...). Cyprians definition is not
fulfdd, but still we must acknowledge the Pope for our immediate, and particular
Ordinary.

5 But for the ^^^e understanding of S. Cyprians meaning, we are to know, that
the foresaid epistle was written to one Florinus or Florentius, surnamed
Pupianus, who, as Pamelius observes in his notes upon that epistle, was a
Nouatia^ heretic, and with too much credulity, and temerity, had given credit
to certain fa^sly reported crimes against S. Cypria^, for which he esteemed
that the Saint ought to have been fors^ken by the people of his Diocese, as
if he had not been true Bishop. Against this false* and seditious imputation,
S. Cyprian proves not that a Church wanting a Bishop is no particular Church,
but that a Church ha^i^g its true, and lawful Bishop, as S. C^prian was, yet
dividing it self, and falling in schism with him, is indeed ^oe Church at
all, but a schismatic congiegatio^. That this is so, S. Cyprians own words
demnostrate, for having alleged out of Scripture Nos credimus, Joan. 6.
et cognouimus quia tu es filius Dei vini, adds, Loquitur ^llic Petrus supra
quem adificatafuit Ecclesia; Ecclesia nomine doce^s et ofterdes, quia et si
contumax ac superba obedire nolemiu^ mult^udo discedat, Ecclesiatame^ a Christo
non recedit, et illi simt Ecclesia pl^bs ^acerdoti adunata, et Pastori sui grex
adhaerens: vnde scire debes Episcopum in Ecclesia esse, and Ecclesia^ in
Episcopo, and si qui cum Episcopo non sit, in Ecclesia non esse, and frustra
sibi blandiri eos, qui pacem cum Sacordotibus Dei non habentes obrepunt, and
latemer apud quosdam communica^e se credunt, quando Ecclesia, quae Catholica
vna est scissa non sit, nequo diuisa, sed sit vrique connexa, et cohare^tium
sibi inudeem Sacerdotum glutino copula^a. We bele^ue, and know, Joan. 6.
that thou art the sonn^ of the liung God. These words are spoken by Peter,
upon whom the Church was builded, teaching us in behalf of the Church, that
although the stubborn, and proud multitude of disobedient persons do go away,
yet the Church does not depart from Christ, and they are the Church the people
vaited to the Priest, and the flock adhering to its Pastor. Wherefore thou
must know, that the Bishop is in the Church, and the Church in the Bishop; and
that if any be not with the Bishop he is not in the Church, (mark) and they do
in vain flatter themselves, who having not peace with the Priests of God,
creep in, and believe that secretly they are in Communion with some, where as
the Church, which is Catholic, and one, cannot be rent, nor divided, but must
be conjoined, and united with the tie of priests, succeeding one to another.

6 Behold S. Cyprian never thinking of the necessity that every particular
Church has of a Bishop, if it neane to be a particular Church, but affirming
that theirue Church does not depart from Christ; that he who is not with the
bishop is not in the Church; that in vain they flater themselves, who have not
peace with the true priests of God, but are in secret communion with some
schismatic, or heretical factions, whereas the Church which is Catholic,
and one, can not be rent, nor divided. And what is all this to prove, that no
particular Church can be such without a Bishop? no more then if one should say,
King Henry the 8. and his adherents in Schism, dividing themselves from their
lawful Pastors, were no true Church: ergo, English Catholics, living in
perfect obedience to the Vicar of Christ, cannot be truly a Church: which in
effect is as doughty an argument as this: The soul, and bo^y separated can
make no true ma^^ergo if they be co^icy^ed they cannot make a true man; for as
the conjunction of the soul with the body gives life to the body, so the life
of the Church consists in obedience to true, and lawful Pastors, to whom
English Catholics being still subordmate, they did, and do, most perfectly
fulfill the definition of a Church given by S. Cyprian, which therefore makes
nothing against, but for us: and that it is rather against M. Doctor himself,
may be euinced out of an argument of his, chap. 12. number. 4. where having cited
the said authority of S. Cyprian that the Church is the people united to the
Bishop, he argues thus: seeing there cannot be a people united to the Bishop
without a Bishop, it foll^weth that there cannot be a Church without Bishops.
Now, according to the clear sense of S. Cyprians words, namely that a people
which is in disobedience, and schism against their lawful Bishops, cannot be
a true Church, I may use the very same form of argument, thus: Whosoever are
not in schism with any lawful Bishop, do fulfill the definition of a Church
given by S. Cyprian; but those who have no Bishop are not in schism with any
lawful Bishop, ergo, those who have no Bishop do fulfill the definition of a
Church given by S. Cyprian. This argument is directly against M. Doctor, and
yet is more truly deduced out of S. Cyprians words then what he did ^^ferie. I
know the Church must always, for other respects, have Bishops, and therefore
what I have here said, is only ad hominem, to M. Doctors manner of disputing,
and only if we respect S. Cyprians words according to the true meaning,
purpose, and occasion, as by him they were uttered.

7 That his application of S. Cyprians definition is injurious to English
Catholics, is man^fest by every word of the Saint, who affirms that they who
are not united to the Bishop, in that sense, in which he speaks, are not in
the Church; that they have not peace with the Priests of God; that they are in
secret communion with schism^ticks; that they are opposite to that Catholic
Church which is one and not rent, nor deued^d^, which gentle Epithetons, or
rather most ^o^le aspertions, to cast upon the most ^e^lo is Catholics of
England, who for their union with the Sea Apostolic, constancy in profession
of their Faith, ioyf^ll suffering loss of goods, liberty, and life, have been
a spect^cle, grations in the sight of God, and his Angels, and admir^ble to the
eyes of men; to apply, I say, such Epithetons to those glorious Confessors,
and Martyrs, our English Catholics, cannot be done without great injury, and
yet by M. Doctor the said definition of S. Cyprian is to them more then once
applied. And truly I should not be able to wonder enough, how a learned man
could lay the foundation of so strange a doctrine, upon a ground so weak, and
so much mistaken (for the true understanding whereof, was required no greater I
bour, then looking on the book, nor deeper learning, then understanding
latin) unless I did consider, that such a doctrine could have but such a
foundation. But I will urge this point no further. Only M. Doctor may gather
from what has been said that the true explication and reason of those words
in S. Cyprian alleged by him in his 12 chap. number. 4 vnde seire debes
Episcopu^ in Ecclesia esse, et Ecclesiam in Episcopo, where upon thou must know
that the Bishop is in the Church, and the Church in the Bishop (which words we
also even now cited) is not that which M. Doctor gives, because the Church
cannot be without a Bishop nor a Bishop without a Church but that, supposing a
Church have a true Bishop, they must not be divided, one from another; and
therefore S. Cyprian immediately after the said words, adds; Qui cum Episcopo
non est, in Ealesia non est: He that is not with the Bishop, is not in the
Church: And yet, I hope, English Catholics, while they wa^ted a Bishop, were
in the Church, other wise they had not been capable of falcation. But by this
we may see how groundedly M. Doctor does speak, and still confirms what I
said of the i^^ury done to English Catholics, by applying to them the
definition of S. Cyprian.

8 The second point, which I undertook to make good, namely, that England may
be a particular Church without a Bishop, is easily proved. For the Pope, in
defect of particular Bishops, is the particular Bishop, Ordinary and Diocesan
of such Churches; as Philosophers do teach, that almighty God, the supreme,
and vmuc^sall cause of all effects, concurreth not only as immediate, but also
as a Particular Agent, or Cause, to the producing of effects, when second
particular causes do fail. For seeing the Pope has plenitudinem potestatis,
fullness, and eminency of power, he may, and is to perform whatsoever
belongs to inferior Pastors, when necessity so requires: which is a
doctrine so received by all Canomsts, and deuines, that I suppose M. Doctor
will not ga^nesay it. Seeing then England for many years was destitute of
Bishops, the Pope himself was our particular Bishop: and to say, that while we
wanted (...) Bishop, we were a flock without a Pastor, an Army without a
General, a ship without a Pylot etc. as M. Doctor avoucheth, seems
injurious to the Vicar of Christ, as if he wanted either power, or good will,
to be our particular Bishop, and Pastor. And indeed to singular has been the
care of Popes over our distressed England, that in fact they ever showed
themselves to be our particular Bishops, and may truly say to our Church, as
Almighty God said to his elected people. Quid est quod debui vltra facere
vineae meae, and non feci? Isa. 5. v. 4
what ought I to have done to my vinyard, more then I have done. We erected
Seminaries, we sent learned Priests, both Secular, and Regular, we endued them
with a^ple faculties; as judges we composed difrerences, as masters, we
resolved doubts; as Fathers, we wrote letters of Comfor, of Exhortation, of
Admonition; as Bishops, we prounded all spiritual helps requisite for the
times, in nothing belonging ^o particular Pastors, we have been w^nting, Quid
debuimus vltra fac^^e, et non fecimus? what more could we have done, then we
have performed for the good of our beloved English Catholics?

The Church of S. Ihon Lateran, or the particular Diocesses of Rome, is, I
trow, a pa^ticular Church, and a perfect o^e: yet it has noe other Bishop for
Ordinary, besides the Pope. Leo the 9. Famous for sanctity, and mi^^cles, being
before his Popedo^ Bishop of Tul, for his affection to that Church did still
remain particular Ordinary thereof. Baron Tom. 11. ann. Dai. 1049. Leon. 9.
ann. ^. n. 6.
Adeo fuit (says Baro^ius) suae Tullensis Ecclesia amator, vt licet Romanus
Pontifex creatus esset, tamen titulum priorem non reliquerit, volueritque, dum
vixi^, dici etiam Tullensis Episcopus. I demand, whether the Church of Tull,
was not a particular Church, or rather, whether it was not a Favorite Church
singularly graced, by having him for particular Bishop, who was Pastor of the
whole world? If Leo, only for devotion to that particular Church, thought he
did it no wrong, in leaving it without any Ordinary, beside himself, with what
shadow of prob^b^^ty, can any man say, that England, when of necessity it was
destitute of Bishops, could not be a particular Church, and have for imme^^te
partil^r Bishop, the Successon^ of Leo the 9. Vrba^e the 8? whom I beseech God
^ong to preserve, for the common good of his universal Church, and particular
comfort of our afflicted Catholics.

10 Loreto, and Recanati, in Italy (and the like may be said of other pl^ces,
but I willingly name that most saded house wherein the eternal Word was made
flesh, and dwelled in us) are two distinct Diocesses under one Bishop, and my
Lord Bishop once styled himself Ordinary. both of England, and Scotland,
beside the Church of Chalcedon: ergo every particular Church need not have it
own particular, distinct Bishop, and much more may the Pope be particular
Bishop of more the^ one Church.

In the Church of God, there are many places, and persons exempt from the
jurisdiction of al Bishops, beside the Pope* neither did any man ever dream,
that for that c^use, they ceased to be particular Churches: Rather, such
exa^ptions were accounted favors, and such imme^iat subjection to the Pope, a
great honour^til now M. Doctor tells the world, that the Church of Saiui John
Late^an, of Tull, of all exempted places, and persons, neither have been, nor
shall be particular Churches, till they be taken from the Popes particular
chardge, and put in the hands of some other Bishop; and that in co^setence they
are obl^ged, to endure whatsoever presecution, for the enjoying such a Bishop.

12 I think M. Doctor will not say, if a Bishop, upon just causes, should take
the particular care of some one parish, and govern it by his delegates, or
Chaplines, himself remaining the only Ordinary Pastor of it, that it should
therefore ce^se to be a particular parish: or if a King to grace some city, or
Province of his Kingdom, should make himself the particular governor of such
a province, or city, that therefore they should not be particular cities, or
provinces: and the like may be said, of a General of an army, in respect of
some particular Regiment: with what reason then can we say. that the Pope, who
is Bishop of the whole Church, may not also be particular Bishop of some one
country, and that country still remain a particular Church? Truly I cannot
imagine upon what ground any man can frame such a conceit, except upon this
inference: The Pope is universal Bishop, of the universal Church: ergo he
cannot be particular Bishop, of a particular Church, because universal, and
particular, are terms incompatible, and repugnant to be in one, and the same
person; or subject. To which argument, I will vouchsafe noe other answer, then
that it seems the very same form of disputing, which heretics vulgarly use
against Catholics, as uttering contradictories, and nonsense, while we join
together Ecclesia Catholica, Romana, the universal, Roman Church, because,
forsooth, a Church Universal and Particular are contradictory terms.

13 But, let us suppose, that which ca^ never be proved, or rather the contrary
whereof is most manifest, let us, I say, suppose, that the Pope cannot be a
particular Bishop of a particular church; I ask, whether for the existe^ce of
a particular church: it be not sufficient, that it be gouernd by such, as from
his Holiness receive Delegated power, for all occasions, that may require
jurisdiction. If he affirm that such a particular Church may be, then I
infer, that a Bishop is not necessary for the making a particular Church;
because whatsoever jurisdiction any Bishop has, the like may be grated to
others, not Bishops. If he deny that Delegate authority is sufficient to make a
particular Church, then he must show me how England, by having a Bishop, is yet
become a particular Church, if so it be, that the said Bishop be only
Delegate, and not Ordinary, of place, of all sorts of persons, both
Catholics, and heretics, not only ad beneplacitum etc. as Scriptures,
Fathers, and Canons speak of Bishops, which power, my Lord of Chalcedon does
not challenge, and M. Doctor professes to abstain from that whole
controversy, and so he must either answer his own argument, or else
confess, that as yet we are no particular Church.

14 My last task, was to show, that although we should freely yield our selves
to be no particular Church, without a Bishop; yet it were not sufficient to
prove, that a Bishop could not be refused, by reason of persecution. This is
easily done, by requiring of M. Doctor, that, which of his own accord, he
should first of all have performed; namely, seeing he will needs have a
particular Church, to be only that, which has a particular Bishop, he ought to
bring some precept, of God, or the Church, obligeing us to be a particular
Church in his sense, and why it is not sufficient for us to be members of the
Catholic Church, in obedience to our Supreme Pastor, the Vicar of Christ,
as our constant Confessors, and glorious Martyrs, before we had a Bishop,
lived in s^nctity, and dyed for justice in profession of the Catholic faith.

15 Neither were this sufficient^, (though it be more then ever he will be able
to perform) unless he could further prove, that such a precept were
vndispensable, or did bind with whatsoever inconvenience, because there are
many divine precepts, for example, Vows, material Integrity of Confession,
Residence of Bishops etc. which do not bind always, nor in all cases, or are
not by the Vicar of Christ dispensable, and until he have proved, this his
imaginary precept not to be of such a kind, he is as near as he was. For
certain^ly, if any cause may yield a lawful excuse, or require dispensation, a
just fea^e of loosing goods, liberty, and life (which case M. Doctor directly
supposes in his assertion) may yield a most reasonable excuse, o^ cause of
dispensation, and for the transgressour plead, not guilty.

16 The reason which M Doctor added, that: as the whole Church has one
Supreme Bishop to govern it, so every particular Church also, must have us
Bishop, or Bishops, else it should not be a particular Church, and so the
whole* and Universal Church should no: (as Christ has instituted) be a
Hierarchy, compose^ of diverse particular Churches de^er^e^n no answer. For
who dare say, that there is as much necessity, or obligation, to have a Bishop,
in ea^ry particular Church, as to have one Supreme head of the whole
Catholic Church? When Gregory, Clement, Paul, and other Popes, stood in
deliberation, whether it were expedient to have a Bishop in England (as for
many years it was by them judged inconuement) might they as well have doubted
of the necessity, or ^onueniency, of having any Pope of Rome, for the
government of the whole Catholic Church? to say, that a particular Bishop
h^th not power to govern the whole Catholic Church: ergo, the Bishop of the
whole Catholic Church cannot go^erne a particular one, is as good, as to say;
the feet cannot guide the head: e^go, the head cannot guide the feet. His
assertion, or inference upon his own^ p^emisses, that unless every particular
Church have a Bishop, the Universal Church should not (as Christ has
instituted) be a Hierarchy, composed of divert particular Churches, if it be
understood of particular Churches indeterminately, that is, the whole Church
cannot be a Hierarchy, unless some particular Churches have Bishops, it is very
true, but s^rueth nothing at all to his purpose of proouing, that England must
have a Bishop; because, although England, or some other particular, country
want Bishops, other Churches, and countries may have them, and so the
Vniuers^ll Church shall still be a Hierarchy composed of diverse particular
Churcher. But if he understand (as his w^res (every particular Church) and his
whole drife seem to demonstrate) that, unless every particular determinate
Church have a Bishop, the whole and Vuiuersall Church should not (as Christ
^ath instituted) be a Hierarchy composed of diverse particular Churches: I must
needs say, his doctrine is clearly subject, to a deeper Censure, then I am
willing to express. For what Catholic dare a^onch, that because England, for
the space of threescore years, wanted a Bishop, the Universal Church all that
time, was not (as Christ has institutea) a Hierarchy composed of diverse
particular Churches? yea, if my Lord of Chu^^edon, be not properly Ordinary,
both of England, and Scotland, M. Doctor must consequently affirm, that the
Universal Church (at this day) is not (as Christ has instituted) a Hierarch^^
composed of diverse particular Churches O, to now great inconveniences is a man
subject, if once he undertake the defense of a very hard cause.

THE THIRD QVESTION. Whether by the divine Law every particular Church must
have it Bishop.
1 TO prove, that a particular Country ^^y not refuse Bishops by reason of
persecution, M. Doctor in his 14. chapter alleges, that it is de lu^e
diuino, of the divine Law, to have a Bishop in every particular Church: And for
proof theoeof, cites So^us, affirming, Sot. lib. 10. de^^u^^^et iure q. 1. a.
4. pos^ s^^ und^^ conclusion^.
it to be de iure diuino of the divine Law, quod in genere singulis Ecclsi^s
secundum Ecclesiasticum diuisionem sut a^plicentur Episcopi. That in general
to every particular Church according to the Ecclesiastical division proper
Bishops are to be applied. And Bannes teaching, Ba^^es 2.2. q. 1. a 10. Coclu.
6. ad v^^.
that Bishops cannot by the Pope be remo^uea from the whole Church, or a great,
or not able part of it. Having cited these two learned authors, he argues
thus: By the divine Law there must be particular Bishops in the Church, but
there is no more reason why the particular Church of France, (for I speak
especially, of great particular Churches, which are not able parts of the whole
Church) should be governed by a Bishop, or Bishops, rather then the Church of
Spain, or the Church of Spain, rather then the Church of England: or
Flanders: ergo France, Spaire, England, Flanders, and all other particular
Churches of extent must be governed by Bishops.

2 These be the best grounds, that M. Doctor in the said chapter brings for
proof that it is de iure deuino a command of God, to have a Bishop in England:
and I will add such other arguments, as can be afforded from his 13. chapter,
wherein although he affirm but that which al Catholics do grant, speaking in
general, that cue^ in time of persecution, the whole Church may not be governed
without some Bishops; yet because some of the proofs brought for the said
verity, may perhaps seem pertinent to this present question, Suar. tom. 4. in
3. p. d. 25.
I will not dissemble them. Suare^^, says he, concludes that the Church
cannot change this kind of government by Bishops. Then he alleges examples
of the African Church. When Hunericus began his reign, he offered to the
Catholics of Carthage, to choose in that Church a Bishop (which ornament (says
Victor) Carthage had wanted for 24. Victor Vticen^^t lib. 2. perseq. vad.
in^^^o.
years) but yet upon this condition, that the Arrtans at Constantinople might
enjoy the free use of their Churches; otherwise (says Hunericus) not only the
Bishop that shall be ordained in carthage with his Clergy, but also all other
Bishops of the African provinces with their Clergy, shall be sent to the
Moo^es. The which when Victor Primate of Afric, and others heard, they
refused his courtesy with so cruel a condition, and says: ^i^ita est,
interposius his cond^tionibus periculosis, haec Ecclesia. Episcopum no^
delectatur habere. Gubernat eam Christus qui semper dignatur guberuare. If it
be so with these perilous conditions, the Church of Carthage is not dilighted
to have a Bishop. But the people so cried out for a Bishop, that they could not
be appeased without one.

3 A second argument M. Doctor ^raweth from another example of Huneticus his
cruelty, and of the African Catholics zeal to their Bishops, and Pasto^rs.
Victor V^^censis lib 2.
Hunericus his cruelty Victor V^^censis descri^^th rather by tears, then words
saying: Quibus autem prosequar flum^^bus ^^^^ry^a^um, quando ^^p^s^op^s,
Presb^^eros, D^^cono^ e^alia ^^^lsiae membra, id est quatuor willia D.cccc
Lxvi. ad exilium eremi dasti^au^^, in quibus ^rant podagrici quamplurims, aly
per aetatem an^o^u^n lumine ^emporali priua^^ etc. But with what f^^ds of
tears shall I proosecute ^rs his cruclt^. woen he sent Best ops Priests,
Deacous, and other members of the Church ^^to ^^^ashme^t in the wilaernesse
amongst whom were ^^my troubled with the gout, others by age, ^^^nd, and
d^priue^ of sight etc. Behold Hu^^^cus his cru^^ty. Now let us behold the
zeal of the Catholics of these countries for their Bishops, and Priests. They
complantned p^^^uf^ly that they were deprined of their Pastors, saying or
rather crying, Victor lib. 2. pe^ses. Vad.
Quibus nos miseros relinqui^ts, dum pergites ad coronas? qui ^os baptizatu^^
sunt parunlos fon^^bus aqua perernis? qui nobis paen^tentiae munus collaturi
sunt, et reconciliationis induigent^s, obstrictos peccatorum vinculis sol^tu^i?
qui^ vobis dictum est, quaecunque solueritis super terram, erunt sol^^a et on
cales. Qui nos sole^ntbus or ation^bus sepulturi sunt mortentes quibus di^^ni
Sacrifict^^^tu^ ^xhibedus est^ Vobiscum et not ^^eebat pergere, siliceret us
tali modo filios a patribus nulla necessit at separaret. To whom do you lean
us maser able wretches whilst you go to receive your crowns? Who shall give
us the Sacrament of penance, and loose us tied with the bords of sins, by
the Indulgence of reconcilia^^on? For to you it was said whatsoever you shall
loose upon earth, it shall be loosed in heane^. Who shall bury us with solemn
prayers, when we shall die to whom the rite of the acu^^^ sacrifice is to be
exhibited? We might have gonne with you, that so no necess^t^ might separate
the children from their Fathers. After this example M. Doctor says thus:
Wherefore a^ for other points of our Faith we must dye rather then deny them,
so we must dye rather then a^^y the Hierarchy of the Church, it being a point
of Faith.

4 His third example is out of Orosius relating, how the A^ian Tyrant
Tr^samundus commanced that the African Bishops should not ordain any more
Bishops in the place of those that dyed. Orosius (...). ^.10.
The Bishops considering that without Bishops* their churches could not long
subsist, but would fall without any other persecu^^on, or violence used against
them, resolved to call a Council. And in that Council all the Bishops with
one cons^^t decreed, notwithstanding the Tyrants Edict to the contrary, to
ordain Bishops. Cogitantes aut regis i^ acund^am, siqua forsan existeret
mitigandam, quo facilius ordinat^ ^^suis plebibus v^uerent, aut si
persecutionis violentia nasceretur, corana^dos etia^ sides confessione, quos
dignos inuentebant promotione etc. Thinking that the Kings wrath if any
perchance should be, would be mitigated, or that they who were found worthy of
promotion, would be crowned with confession of their ministry, And good
reason had they so to do: For, as says Baronius: Quaenam shes de Ecclesi^s
^astoribus destitutis vlterius reliqua esse poterat, Baron. An. Da^. 504.
conuulsis earum fundame^tis ip^is quibus initibantur Episcopis? What hope
could there remain for the Churches, when their foundations, to wit the
Bishops, to which they leaned, and on which they depended were ruined, and
pulled up. Thus far out of M. Doctor, whose words I hane related at large,
that the reader might see all the force of these examples, and out of the
narrations themselves, gather the answers to them.

5 In this question, certain it is, that de ^ure diuino the Church must be
goue^ned by Bishops, that is, in the whole Church of God, there must be some
Bishops; but to affirm, as M. Doctor does, that it is de iure diuino to have
a particular Bishop in the particular Church of England, and n^^^nely, that
there is such a precept, but moreover, that hoe persecuio^ can excuse the
obligation thereof, or give sufficient cause of dispensation (all which he must
prove, if he will speak home) is a paradox, to speak sparingly without any
show of probability, and which may seem to tax those Popes, as ignorant of
the divine Law, who for so many years esteemed it neither necessary, nor
expedient to send a Bishop into England; neither when he was sent did they ever
dispute^, whether it was necessary ^ure diuino, but all the deliberation was,
quid expediret, what was expedient: yea M. Doctor must finally answer his
own arguments, which either prove nothing at all, or else prove that his
Holiness is obliged to give us an Ordinary, (for his reasons, and examples are
for such) which is more then M. Doctor himself will ^uouch.

6 And truly I cannot in^agine, what way one should go about to prove, that
upon noe cause whatsoever, the Pope can make himself particular Bishop of some
particular Church, especially for a time, and govern it by his Delegates,
endued with sufficient power, and still provided, that the said particular
Church within, or without it self, have means to be furnished with sufficient
Priests, and necessary Sacraments, and helps.

7 But although we should grant, that as M. Doctor affirms, a great, or
notable part of the church could not iu^re diuino be gourned without a Bishop;
yet that would be far from proouing, that England, as things now stand, must
needs have a Bishop. For if our country be considered not materially, but
formally (as Deuines express themselves) that is not the extent of land, or
multitude of people, but the number of Catholics, which only can make a true
church, we shall find it to be more then far from a great, or notable part of
the Catholic church spread over the whole world, And God grant that I might not
with truth, affirm the whole number of Catholics in England, and Scotland
also to be much less the^ the number of people in some one city in this
Kingdom. Sure I am, that my Lord of Chalo^don, or some other in his behalf, in
a certine writing called a Paral^^ sect. 4. says, that all the Catholics
would scarce make one of diverse Bishoprics in England Now, to affirm, that
one Dicocesse, or city or indeed not so much as one Diocese, or city) is a
great, or notable part, of that Church, which reaches as far, as the rising,
and setting of the sun, and that it must therefore iure diuino have a Bishop,
so as no cause can excuse the want of one; is a thing, that I will not say noe
divine, but even noe man in his right Judgment can affirm. But by this we may
see into what absurdities partiality may lead men, though other ways learned.

8 Enough has been said to disprooue M. Doctors Tenet in this present
question. yet nothing will more disadu^^age his assertion, then when the reader
shall by my answers clearly pe^rceiue, his own arguments, either to go beside
the matter, or to prove against himself.

9 His first was taken out of Sotus affirming it to be deiure diui^e of the
dideuine law, quod in genere singulis etc. that in gener^l, to every
pa^ticular Church, according to the Ecclesiastical division, proper Bishops
are to be applied. This authority is either against M. Doctor, or nothing
against us. For either we suppose, that the ancient division of diocesses
remain ^ot in England, and Scotland, and then according to M. Doctors
understanding of Sotus, every Diocese in England, and Scotland, must ^ure
diuino have a particular Bishop, which is absurd, and could never be the true
meaning of so learned a man, as Sotus was. Or else we suppose, that al
Ecclesiastical division of Diocesse^ in England has ceased; and then there is
not by the divine law, due to England any Bishop according to this authority of
Soto, who only says, it is deiure diuino, of divine law, that to every
particular Church proper Bishops are to be applied according to the
Ecclesiastical division, and therefore where there is no such division, the
words of Sotus have no^ place, so that Divine as he is alleged by M. Doctor
is aginst himself.

10 If the Reader ask me, what indeed is the true meaning of Sotus? I answer:
his meaning is not, that the Pope is obliged iure diu^ino, by divine precept,
to institute this, or that particular Diocese, or to give particular Bishops
to every such particular Diocese instituted, but only, that when the Pope does
confirm, and consecrate a Bishop, and gives him charg of some particular
Diocese, in such eases he does a particular action, which in general was
instituted, and commanded by our Savior Christ, who ordained in general, that
in the whole Church there should always be some Bishops: which in effect is
noe more the^ we grant, but comes far short of what M. Doctor inte^deth. That
this is the true meaning of Sotus, is plain by his onwe words. For having
taught what M. Doctor cyted out of him, he proves it in this ma^nter: Dum Dei
minister, id quod ips^ instituit, ipsius iussu d^spensat, actio est de iure
diuino censenda: cum autem Pupa Episcopum confirmat, et consecrat, alicuique
attribuit Ecclesiae id exequitur quod Christus in genere instituit, quodque
facere iussit: ergo, id iuris diuini censendu^ est. When the minister of God,
by his command performs that which he instituted such an action is to be
esteemed of de^ine law. But when the Pope does confirm, and consecrate a
Bishop, ^^d applies him to some Church he e^^ec^^et^ that which Christ in
general (M^rke) did institute and which he co^ma^d^d him to ^o the^fore su^^
an actio^ ought to be said to be of the divine law Can a^y thing be more
de^re, or more direct to show that according to Sot' the Institution and
precept of Christ, was only in gineral which is plainly for us against M.
Doctor. Yet to take away all doubt Sotus brings this example: Sacrament
(...) absilutio etc. sacrame^tal absolutio, and the like, although they be
imm^d^a^ly pe^formed by the minesters of the Church, nevertheless they are to
be esteemed a^ of divine law be^^^se Christ did ^astitute them, and com^a^d^ed
them, to be so done, and dispe^sed in his ^^me. ^^^vere a ^^^nesse by these
words to ^aser our of So^us that every one having authority to administer
sacraments, were therefore by deui^e law, and precept bound to do it, but all
that could be rightly deduced, according to Sotus, would be, that in case he
did administer such sacraments, such an action should be said to be de ^ure
diuin^ of the divine law. ^s a thing, in general, not of humane, but divine
enstitution. Marriage, in general, was instituted, and commanded by God, and in
the new law, by Christ's, institution, it is a Sacra^^^t, and therefore when
Christians marry they perform an actio^, in ge^erall commanded, and instituted
to be a ^^crame^^: shall we therefore out of Sotus inter, that every Christian,
or communite is bound to marry? M. Doctonr, I suppose, knows well enough, why
Sotus did so much urge this manner of speech, that the confirmation,
consecration, and appling of Bishops to particular Churches, is of divine
insti^ution. The cause was, more strongly against his antagonist Catharinus, to
enforce the residence of Bishops to be a Deuyne and not only an Ecclesiastical
precept; which precept nevertheless, as Sotus himself affirms, and indeed
none ca^deny, does not oblige in alt^ms, and place; and therefore although Sotus
should affirm that there were a divine precept, to apply Bishops to every
particular determinate Church, yet that precept being affi^mati^^ (as Deuines
speak) it would not bind in all occasions, as Sotus teaches concerning the
reside^ce of Bishops. Finally by this ocasion, M. D^^^er I doubt not, will be
more circo^spect in ^^adging authors least he does wrong his o^ne reputation,
the authors then deiues, the reader, and most of all the truth. For Sotus does
not speak only of such particular Churches, as are great, or notable parts of
the whole Church, as M Doctor does, but of particular Diocesses: and to say,
that it is de ^ure ^iu^^ a divine command, that every Diocese have a
particular Bishop, and in such manner, as for noe cause whatsoever it can be
otherwa^es, is a proposition far from Sotus his thoughts, and which neither
M. Doctor, nor any other ^^ill, or can defend.

11 The second author alleged by M. Doctor is Bannes saying: that Bishops
^^n^a^ by the Pope be removed from the whole Church, or a great or not able
part thereof. I wonder M. Doctor would allege this learned deame, to prove
that ^^^s de iure deuino, to have a Bishop in England, the coutrary whereof is
clearly deduced from this very authority of the same author, who having
taught, that Bishops have all their authority immediately from the Pope,
frames this objection against himself: That if the Bishops have their
authority immediately from the Pope, it were in his power to remove all
Bishops from their Churches, and so the Catholic Church should be without
Bishops. To this objection Ba^nes answers, Quod licet Summus Pontifex posset
pros^^ arbetr^tu, vnum aut alterum Episcopum amouere, nec in locum little ali
quem design^re, non tame admittendu^ est. quod in tota Ecclesia, aut in magna
eius part, ta^temere sua potestate abuta^ur. Although the Pope might as he
should think good, remove one, (...) two Bishops, and design none in their
place, yet it is not to be admitted, that he can so rashly abuse his power in
the whole Church, or in a great part thereof. By the only reading of Bannes his
words (which M. Do^^our ought to baue alleged at large, and not by halfes, as
much as might seem for his purpose) the reader will quickly perceive that it
is not de iure diuino, a commandment of God, that every particular Church have
a Bishop, seeing according to this Author, the Pope may leave some Churches
without Bishops. Now I would ask M. Doctor, whether such Churches should
cease to be particular Churches? and whatsoever he answers, will either be
against his other Principle, that without a Bishop there can be no^ particular
church, of else if he say, that they should not remain particular Churches, he
must consider that then a^cording to Bannes, it is not de iure diui^o, a deuire
la^, that every Church should be a particul^r Church, because, as we have
seen. Bannes teaches, that without breach of ^e^^e law, the Pope may leave
some churches without Bishops. Besides, the (...) will see that Bannes only
speaks of remoouing Bishops from the whole Church, or from a great part of
it, and thence he would deduce a contr^rio sensu, that seeing the flock of
Christ in England, is far from being a great part of the Catholic church,
and less then some one Dio^^sse, from which Bannes granted the Pope may
remove a Bishop (yea he teaches that all Bishops may be removed from more
Diocesses then one) he would, I say, out of his own assertion deduce, that the
Pope may, not only deny a Bishop to England, but also, if the think good,
remove one already granted. Moreover, the Reader cannot forget, how M. Doctor
alleged first Sotus* as teaching that iure diuino* by deui^^ Precept, every
particular Church must have it Bishop: and afterward, to the some purpose, he
^i^ed Bannes, who y^^ express^^^ affirms the contrary, and teaches that the
Pope may le^ue some particular Chu^ches without Bishops. How do these two
things cohere? It passes my understanding that two authors should be rightly
alle^^ged as teaching that very po^^^, wherein they are contrary. Contrary, I
say, as Sotus is understood by M. Doctors for according to his true meaning,
he is nothing ^g^inst Bannes, for as much as concerns out present purpose, as
I have she wed ou^ of their own words. And thus, I hope, to have made good
that Ba^nes allea^ged by M. Doctor* is indeed mainely ag^y^st him. And this is
so much the more strange, because Sotus, and Bannes were allea^ged, as
teaching some singular matter in his favor, who both, upon exami^e are found
to be his adversaries.

12. The reason that M. Doctor did inser^^ from the said authorities, makes
for him, just as they did. It was this. By the divine law there must be
particular Bishop^ in the Church; but there is noe more reason why the Church
of France, for example, should be governed by a Bishop, then the church of
England; ergo, England, and all other particular churches of extent, must be
governed by Bishops. Truly I cannot but wonder, that a learned man should use
such a form of argument, which he cannot but know does fail in a thousand
instances. For example, some meat is absolutely necessary for the mainetena^ce
of man, but there is no more reason, why eggs, or fish should be necessary to
the maintenance of man rather, then other particular meats: ergo, eggs, fish,
and all other particular meats are necessary for the mainetenance of man. Or,
to bring an example nearer the purpose. It is of the law of God, and nature,
that some men do marry for the preserving of mankind; but (if we precisely
respect the law of nature) there is noe more reason, why one person, village,
or city should be obliged, rather then another: ergo, every particular person,
village, and city is obliged to marry. To these instances M. Doct. must
answer by distinguishing the minor proposition. If we compare one particular
meat, to another paricular determinate meat, then the minor is true, that
there is no more reason of one, then another, and so neither one, nor other
determinately is necessary: But if we compare one particular meat, with other
particular meats, taken in general or indeterminately, then there is more
reason why one particular meat is not so necessary as others taken
indeterminatly, because in that indeterminate sense* they signify all
particular meats in general, which no doubt are more necessary for the
maintenance of man, then any one determinate meat. Or to say all in one word,
some meat is necessary, but not this or that in particular. And so we may
easily answer M. Doctors argument by the like destruction, that iure diuino,
Bishops are necessary in some parts of the church indeterminately, but not
determinately in this, or that part of the church, And this were sufficient to
answer that sophisme. Yet, that the reader may see how weak an argument it
is, his Minor proposition might be easily denied, although we should compare
one particular church with another particular church determinately taken: for
there may reasons occur of persecution, or the like, to make the case of one
church different from that of another. And as for England in particular (beside
the known reason of persecution, different from other countries (which we also
suppose should be increased by the coming of a Bishop, for of that case M.
Doctor speaks) joined nevertheless with the paternal care of Christ's Vicar,
whereby in so long time of persecution, we were abundantly provided of all
means for our souls good, even according to M. Doctor his own assumpt,
there is a different reason of England, which, as it signifies a particular
true church, is neither a great, nor not able part of the whole church, nor to
use M. Doctors own words, a church of extent.

13 I desire to know of M. Doctor, whether this form of argument be good.
Religious institute in general is of the divine institution, and the Supreme
Pastor of Gods church, by his office, is obliged on his part, to procure, that
in the Catholic church, so sacred an institution be maintained; but there is
noe more reason why it should be maintained in France, or Spain, then in
England: ergo, the Pope is obliged to mainteyne the being of religious
institute in England. When M. Doct. shall tell me what be thinks of this
manner of argument, I will then let him know what good use I shall be able to
make of his answer, whatsoever it be.

14 Lastly, here also I must crave leave to show, that M. Doctor his manner of
argument is rather against himself, and may be thus retorted, especial if we
take what he himself seems to confess, and in it self is most evident, to
wit, ^h^t it is not de iure di^ino, to have a Bishop in every particular little
Church, or Diocese, but at most, in such Churches, as are great, and of
extent. It is nor de iure diuino, that there be a particula^ Bishop in every
Diocese of England; but (if we respect the divine law) there is no more reason
of o^e Diocese, then of another: ergo, all the Diocesses of England may be
without a Bishop: which is directly against that, which M. Doctor by his said
argument intended to prove. Moreover in the same manner one might go foreward,
and say: There is noe more reason why all the Diocesses of England may be
governed without a Bishop, then those of France, nor of France more then of
Spain, and so of all other particular Churches: ergo, all particular churches
of the whole world may be gouernd with out Bishops. A thing both false in it
self, and directly contrary to what M Doctor intends. Nevertheless it is the
very same manner of disputing which he himself uses, and so his own
arguments overthrow their owe grounds and distroie themselves.

15 And here I would be glad to know, wherther his arguments do not prove,
that Scotland must also have it particular Bishop. Sure I am, that if they
prove any thing, they must prove that; and so M. Doctor both tells my Lord of
Chalcedon, that he cannot be Bishop of Scotland (which being a Country of
extent must have its particular Bishop) and lets his holiness know, that he
has not satisfied the divine law till he place a Bishop in Scotland. But I
think M. Doctor will not proceed so far; yet by this he may see how his
arguments outreach his own intention, and so while they prove too much, they
effect nothing.

16 Neither need I again put M. Doctor in mind, that if he prove any thing,
his argument proves that England, and Scotland also must iure diuino have an
Ordinary, because by the divine law beside the Supreme Pastor, there must be
in the Church of God other Ordinaries. And this be said concerning such
arguments as M. Doctor has in his 14 chapter. Let us now examine those of his
13. chapter.

17 What he alleges out of Suarez, to prove that the government of the
Church by Bishops, speaking in general, cannot be altered by the Church, is
most true. Only I wish, M. Doctor had not so abruptly broken of Suarez his
discourse, who being to prove that in a Monarchy there must be, not only one
supreme, but also other inferior, as it were, Princes of the Church, says
thus: the minor is declared, both because a monarchy must have something admixt
of Aristocracy, because there must be in the Church many Princes, under one the
first. Thus he cyteth Suarez, against all Grammar, not giving any word
answering to (both) which therefore I must do, and tell the reader, that in
Suarez there follow immediately these words: tum etia^ quia in rep Christana
erat hoc maxim necessarium, nam est amplissima, and vniuersalissima, and eius
regimen est spirituale, and internum, quod non fit exact ^^si per proprios
Pastores, and Principes Ecclesiae: and also because in the Christian common
w^lth this (to have some other Bishops beside the supreme Pastor) was most
necessary, because it is most large and most universal, and the government of
it is spiritual, and internal, which is not exactly p^rformed, but by proper
Pastors, and Princes of the Church. If M. Doctor, had not omitted this re^s^,
Imcane the amplitude, and universality of Christ's Church, the reader might
have seen, that what Suarez affirmed, with all Deuines, of the necessity to
have some Bishops in the Church in general, could not be verified of the
catholic Church in England, which is neither amplissima, nor vniuersalissima,
mostlarge, nor most vneuersall, neither does the want of a Bishop in England
infer, that the Church shall not be a perfect Monarchy, governed by one
supreme Pastor, and other inferior Ecclesiastical Princes, in some parts of
it: For England is not the whole world. You see the^, that I had reason to wish
Suarez had been by M. Doctor cited not by halfes, for he being entirely cited
makes for us, against him.

18 His examples drawn from the African church, may be answered all at once,
if we consider. First, that examples prove little, unless we were sure, that
all circumstances concur alike; and as those of Afric could best judge,
what was fit for that Church, so English men can best tell, how things stand in
England, and what is most expedient for that Church. Secondly it is clear,
their case was far different from ours in England. For the African Bishops,
and people, had open meetings, yea the Bishops celebrated Councels: The
Catholcks were many, and public, or rather the whole face of the country was
catholic: They had their known Primate, and other Bishops: and lastly (which
I desire the reader still to observe) if there had not been Bishops in Afric,
their Church would have wholly f^yled, because for ordayning of Priests, they
had noe such means as England, by the merciful goodness of God, and singular
care of Popes, have had, and still enjoy, with such education for Clergy men,
as God grant we may retain the like, if England be catholic. For other helps
also, there was not betwixt Afric, and Rome, that intercourse which we now
enjoy.

19 And by this last observation is answered a demand of M. Doctor, in his 14.
chap. number 2. Why the Popes, and Bishops, in the Primative Church, were so
diligent in consecrating Bishops, ye^ and making Popes, even in the midst of
the greatest persecutions, but that they thought it was iuris diuini that every
church should have its Bishop. The true reason was, because in those times
every country needed his own Bishop, for ordayning of Priests, and the like,
without which their churches could not subsist, and least of all could the
universal Catholic Church subsist, without a head the Pope: and I wonder at
M. Doctor his (yea and making Popes) in his foresaid demand, as if it were
more strange, that Popes, then that particular Bishops should be ordained in
time of persecution.

20 All this that I have said, of the different case betwixt Afric, and
England, is clear out of the history, and words alleged by M. Doctor
himself, which I cyted in the beginning of this question, and in particular of
this last main difference, you shall fi^de in Baronius Anno ^04. these words.
Eo consilio ista preceperat Trasamundus, vt absque exerto ad persequendum
gladio, ipsae Orthodoxorum Eccelsiae, aliquo temporis spatio orbatae vniuersae
Pastoribus sponte concidereat. To that end Trasamundus had commanded those
things (namely that no more Bishops should be ordained in the place of those
that dyed) to the end that without dint of sword, the Catholic Churches being
all for some space of time destitute of Pastors, might of themselves fall. And
for this reason Baronius said: what hope could there remain for the churches,
when their foundations, to wit the Bishops, were taken away? And this I hope
will satisfy the judicious reader, that the three examples drawn from the
African Church, prove nothing for our case in England: yet by way of
supererogation, I will touch every one of them apart.

21 Concerning the first, of the peoples crying ont for a Bishop for the Church
of Certhage, which Hunericus offered them, but upon condition that the Arians
of Constantinople, might enjoy the free use of their Churches, otherwise not
only the Bishop that should be ordained in Carthage with his clergy, but also
all other Bishops of the African^ provinces with their clergy, should be sent
to the Moors. I ask M. Doctor, whether in good earnest he think it
necessary, or lawful, rather to admit such conditions, then ^o lec a
particular Diocese (as Carth^ge was) be without a Bishops I do not believe
but he will grant that it is not lawful, at least Victor, Primate of all
Afric, with other Bishops, was of opinion that upon such conditions a Bishop
wos not to be desire^: Interposit^s his Conditionibus etc. (say they) with such
conditions as these the church of Carthage is not willing to have a Bishop. And
therefore the people, who with such a resolution cried for a Bishop, did either
hope, that the threatened conditions would not take effect, or else their zeal
is more to be admired, then imitated. Wherefore when M. Doctor, out of his
zeal also to have a Bishop, number 7. turns his speech to Catholics in England,
desiring them to imitate this zeal of the Carthaginians for a Bishop, and to
imprint it in their hearts (although it must be with characters of their own
blood) does in effect say: O my dear c^^atrymen, you Catholics of England, be
sure to cry for a Bishop, although it were upon condition, (...) the
blasphemous Arians, who den^^^our dear Saviors Deuinity, in son^^iefest
Catholic city, have free use their abominable churches, and the otherwise
not only the Bishop that she ordained in England with the whole tholicke
Clergy of that country, but a^ all Bishops of some other large Catho^e
Prouynces, with their Clergy, shalb^nt to forrayne barbarous countries: an^
^is you must do, and not be appeased (...) though your Superior, and the
Super^^ur of the Bishop himself, to wit your and his lawful Primate,
together with there Bishops, should be of another mind, and should utterly
dislike the having o^ Bishop, upon such conditions; for so did ^he people of
Carthage, against the iudg^^ent of Victor their Primate, and of the ^ther
African Bishops. Were not this a vey pious exhortation? teaching men with the
same breath to desire a Bishop, and disobey Bishops: And yet M. Doctor in
effect says so, while very pathetically, he beggs of English catholics, an
imitation of the Carthaginian peoples fact.

22 His second example makes nothing to our present purpose. For it tells us
only, that the catholics lamented (and who would not have so done?) when
their Bishops, Priests Deacons, and other Catholics, to the number of four
thousand nine hundred six^^e six (which number why did M. Doctor omit to
translate into English, having translated the words immediately, both
precedent, and subsequent?) were sent into banishment. But what is all this?
Can we not have Priests, be baptized, absolved from our sins, buried, enjoy
the comfort of the holy Mass, without Bishops? and yet (as we have seen) want
of the said helps was that, which caused such lamentations among those good
Catholics, who at one time were deprived, not only of Bishops, but also of
their Priests, and Deacons. This example being so far from the purpose, I
marvel he would coople with it a certain (wherefore) saying: wherefore as
for other points of faith we must dye, so we must dye, rather then deny the
Hier aroby of the church, Which consists principally of Bishops. To dye for
the defense of the Hierarchy of the church, is indeed sufficient cause of
martyrdom, but I neither understand how that truth is aptly deduced from the
said example, nor can any body believe, that he were a martyr, who should dye
for defense of the necessity of a Bishop in Englard, or for defense of some
particular pretense of authority, which a Bishop in England might make:
although perhapps M. Doctor might not think it impossible, but that his book
being in English, ^ome unlearned person might take all these for one, and so
think himself a happy man, and a martyr, by defending, and dying for
whatsoever authority a particular Bishop might pretend. I deleeue M. Doctor
himself would be loath to die for such causes.

23 To his third example of Trasamundus commanding noe Bishops to be ordained
in place of those that dyed, that so without further persecution the churches
might fa^le, I have answered already, and now will only note M. Doctors
translation of a word, for his purpose. Cogitantes, ^u^^regis iracundiam mitig
andam aut coronandos etiam sidei confessione, quos dignos inueniebant
promotione: Thinking that cyther the Kings wrath would be mitigated, or that
they who were found worthy of promotion, should also be crowned by the
c^fession of their faith; this M. Doctor translateth (with the confession of
their ministry) that so some might think it a point of martyrdom to confess
the practice of some particular Bishops pretended authority: otherwise I see
not why he should change faith into ministry.

THE FOVRTH QVESTION whether a country, although the persecution should be
e^creased by occasion of having a Bishop, could refuse one, if it were only for
the sacrament of Confirmation.
1 FIRST, we protest that by Gods holy assistance, we do, and ever will
reverence the sacrament of Confirmation, noe less then others, who now upon
particular designs, do so much urge the necessity thereof. And further I
declate, that for my particular, I am ready to follow any m^st severe opinions
of whatsoever approved Catholic Divine, when that Sacrament may conveniently
be had, and am persawded, that in such case, the neglect of so great a benefit,
cannot be pleasing to almighty God. But to put upon men's consciences so strict
an obligation, notwithstanding whatsoever persecution, to be raised by the very
occasion of enjoying that Sacrament, is more then can be warranted by
scripture, or any tradition, or definition of the Church, or by any Decree of
any Pope, or, for ought I know, by the testimony of any one sin^le Catholic
Divine, whose works are come to public view, or can be proved by any good
Theological argument. And besides this, to affirm that not withstanding
whatsoever persecution, we must not only receive that Sacrament, but must have
it only from a Bishop, and from a Bishop of England, or b^longi^g to that
Kingdom (all which points M. Doctor must prove before he prove his intent)
is a thing, which noe Author Thomist, Scotist, or Nominalist, not Doctor,
Secular, or Regular ever taught, or ca^ enter into the deliberate thought of
any reasonable Divine, much less is it a doctrine to be broached upon so
weak, and mistaken, or ill applied grounds, as I hope todemo^strat M. Doctors
reason to be.

2 True it is, the Sacrament of Confirmation was instituted for giving of grace
to profess our Faith, and S Thomas teaches that by it a man receives
augmentation, S. Tho. 3. p. q. 65. a ^^n. corp.
and grows: which yet cannot be so understood, as if this Sacrament were the
only means to attain such spiritual grows, Tanner. Tom. 4. disp. 4 q 4.
dub. 2. n. 43. prof^ssio fide^ debita, suo quidem tempore est necessaria, sed
ad qua^ elia^ ord: naria gratiae a^xilia su^^iciut For the cof^ssio of our
paith the ordinary be^ps of grace are su^^c^e it. S. Tho. 3. p. q. 72. a. 2.
ad. 1.
because by other Sacraments, and ordinary helps of almighty God, we may
receive the effect of that same grace, which is given in confirmation; every
one according to the measure of grace communicated by God, and seco^ded with
the cooperation of man's free will, as the Apostles in Pentecost in an
extraordinary measure received the holy Ghost, without the Sacrament of
Confirmation, rem Sacramenti sine sacarmento faith S. Thomas, the grace of the
Sacrament without the sacrament; and the like he teaches of those Christians,
of whom S. Peter Act. 11. Says: Cum caepissem loqui cecidit Spiritus Sanctus
super cos, sicut et in nos in principio: when I had begun to speak the Holy
Ghost descended upon them, as it did upon us in the beginning.

3 There is great difference betwixt corporal and spiritual growth: Corporal
growth is by augmentation, or extention of Quantity, and although one should,
never so much increase in health, strength, good color, and the like, yet
because these are within the compass of the Predicament of Quality, different
toto genere from the Predicament of Quantity a man notwithstanding whatsoever
improouement in the foresaid Qualityes, might still remain but a dwarf,
unless he increased also in Quantity. But our souse is a spirit, and the
gro^th of it ^onsisteth in ^us^^fying grace, which is of the same nature, and
offense, by whatsoeue^ sacrament, or meritorious work ^t be given, and
therefore is not ryed to one means, but may and is afforded by diu^rs, as
neither the actual helps, or motions of gra^e, are nec^ssarily to bo^^d to one
sacrament, that they cannot likewise be given for, and by the receiving of
other.

4 S. Thomas says: S. Tho. 2.2. q. 18 4 a. 3. ad 3.
If we compare the voluntary perfection of following the Enangelicall Counsels
for the remoouing of all impediments of the acts of charity (which is the
perfection of Religious state with that other necessary perfection of keepng
the commandments, and removing only those impediments, whereby we forfet, the
grace of God, and charity (to which perfection all Christians are obliged) it
is as if we should compare a man of perfect growth with a child. I demand of M.
Doctor whether hence it follow, that all must be Religious me^, least
otherwise they be like children without perfect growth? as M. Doctor avoucheth
the necessity of confirmation, least otherwise we be without perfect growth,
and still like to children. And that this example, and demand is not wholly
impertinent, I must crave leave, giving God all the glory, to say, that a
Religious state, considering the secure means it has of incessant en^re as in
grace by continual merit of good works, and frequent receiving of other
sacraments does strengthen a man not to f^^le in persecution, noe less, then
the only receiving of Confirmation commonly may be thought to strengthen people
lining amoung continual dangers, and distraction, in the world; always
supposed, that the same sacrament be not by such Religious men culpably
omitted: and yet he were to blame who for this reason of greater growth would
be as forward, as M. Doctor, in imposing I know not what obligatio^s,
notwithstanding whatsoever persecution.

5 Baptism, the most necessary of all sacraments, may be supplied by death,
vndergonne for the profession of our faith, when the sacrament it self cannot
be had. Persecution is the nearest participation of martyrdom, and may well be
termed a lingering death, or martyrdom: and therefore we may confide in the
goodness of our God, for whose sake we suffer, that lie will not forsake us
for want of that sacrament, which we cannot have, without increase of our many
afflictions; and will effect, that the same pressure be jointly a wound, and a
cure, in virtue of his sweet providence who facit cum tentatione prouentum,
out of miseries draws increase of merit: especially we being still in such
disposition, and humble subjection to his Divine will, that if we were once a
certained of his greater glory, and good of souls, by having a Bishop in
England, only for the Sacrament of Confirmation (which is our present
question) we would rather hazard goods, liberty, and life, (as by his grace for
other matters we freely do) then not perform therein his most blessed will.

6 The times have been, when our persecution was most bitter, and yet would to
God we now could behold the zeal, fervor, charity, and constancy which in
those days without the sacrament of Confirmation Catholics showed. I hold it
noe rashness to affirm, that since Engla^ds enjoying a Bishop, more harm
has befallen Catholics in general, by disagreement, and frequent breach of
charity, then they have received commodity, by the only sacrament of
Confirmation, administered to a few; and that more have been in danger to fall
by these dissentions, then for want of the said sacrament.

7 Yet put c^se, that some perhaps have, or hereafter might fall for want of
confirmation, the whole body of Catholics is not obliged to undergo a
general persecution, for au^yding the particular damage of a few, whose fall is
voluntary, and to be ascribed only to themselves, because they make not use of
other means, and sacraments, which may be had in England, and through their
own negligence, and liberty of life, do not cooperate with that particular
grace, and assistance of Almighty God, which hitherto his goodness has in
abundance offered to English Catholics without the sacrament of confirmation.
M. Doctor knows, that when the danger, and occasion of sin, is either not
proximum, imminent, and such as morally will not be avoided, or else not of any
determinate time, person, or place, but obely in general (that such a state,
or function morally speaking will be occasion of sin, although every particular
occasion may be either avoided, or overcome) he knows, I say, that both a
commonwealth may tolerate such a state, either for attaining some greater
good, or avoiding some notable inconvenience, and also particular me^ may
without sin embrace such a course of life, for example of a souldi^r, or the
like: Much more then, the danger of falling for want of Confirmation, being
neither proximum, not of any determinat person, time, place, or occasion, or
which may not either be avoided, or overcome by other means, Catholics are
not obliged for avoiding of such remote, and uncertain, voluntary dangers of a
few, to to cast themselves upon present, certavne, and great inconveniences.
Nay, if I should affirm, that more might be in danger to fall by increase of
persecution voluntarily drawn upon themselves, then for want of Confirmation,
and that therefore catholics could not in conscience admit a Bishop only for
Confirmation (supposing as our present supposition is, that the persecution
should be increased by that occasion) how would M. Doctor demonstrate that my
conjecture, and argument were not as good, or better then his? For we know
that in persecution some have fallen, but we cannot know that their fall was
for want of Confirmation. But I will not imitate M. Doctor in multiplying
precepts, upon uncertainties, nor forestall the decrees of Superiors, by
denou^cing aforehand what in conscience they must do, unless they will break
a divine precept.

8 Well, but suppose Confirmation were as necessary, as he will have it, must
we therefore of necessity have a Bishop? It is strange M. Doctor never
objected to himself, that Confirmation, by particular commission from the
Pope, may be administered by a Priest: S. Tho. 3. p. q. 72. a. 11.
which he knows to be the doctrine of S. Thomas, and common among Deuines, in
so much as a learned modern writer teaches* that the contrary is less, or not
at all probable, Tanner ^oin. 4 diss* 4. q. 4. dull. 3. asse^^: 3.
adding that the said common doctrine has been practiced not only by Gr^gory
the Great, (our Apostle) but often by other Popes also; that at this present
it is practiced in the indyes; that some Abbots by particular Privilege may
confer the sard Sacrament, as the Congregation of Cardinals have declared
upon the 7 session of the Council of Trent; that the same doctrine is declayed
in the Council of Florence decreto vnionts. I have been credibly informed that
the Abbot of Monte Cassino of the holy order of S. Bennet has authority to
confirm; and Petrus Arcudius in a learned volume written of the agreement
betwixt the Latin, Pelr. Arcudius de concordia Eccles^e Oc^idemalis and
O^^etalis in s^pt^m Sacramen or i^ administration (...) ^. 2, cap.
and Greek Church, in the administration of the seven Sacraments, witnesses
that in the hearing of diverse other of the Greek College in Rome, he was told
by a grave Father of the Society of Jesus, by name Petrus Fonseca, who came to
Rome the year 1593. that some principal me^ of the said Order, had authority
to administer the Sacrament of Confirmation, and further the same Father
certainly avouched, that himself was wont to administer the said Sacrament in
Brasile, where there was kept the Popes Grant of such authority. Also the same
Arcudius, writes that others relate, how Adrian the 6 (a very learned, and
pious Pope) the year 1521. upon the 25. of April, granted for the Indies,
and country; destitute of Bishops, that Priests Minorites might confirm, and
that an Authentical of the Grant is kept at Seuill, in the convent of
glorious S. Francis his Order. Moreover, Arcudius alleges ancie^nt Greek
Fathers, to prove that even before the schism, it was the practice of the
Greek Church, to have confirmation administered by Priests (with particular
commission to that effect.) And to take away all scruple, Ita Suarez, coninck,
Henriquez, quos citat, and s^quitur Pau^us ^at^^^ lib. 5. tr^ct^t. 3. cap. ^.
a. 1
some great Deuines do teach, that although such commission ought not to be
granted without just cause, yet it is of force, and valid, howsoever it be
granted: because, it is not properly a dispensa^ion in the law of Christ, but
rather a commission of power according to Christ's insticution, which is, that
the Extraordinary Minister of Confirmation, should be a Priest by commission
from the supreme Pastor of Gods Church. If M. Doct. hold against the common
doctrine of Deuines, and practice of most learned, and holy Popes, who have
committed the Sacrament of confirmation to Priests, then he must undertake a
new, and hard task; and prove that even for that slender probability which
his opinion has (if it has any) Catholics must rather suffer increase of
persecution, then not make all sure, by having a Bishop for confirmation: which
is a thing, he will never be able to prove, espcially seeing Popes content
themselves with the said doctrine, even in countries where Bishops might be
emoyed with less danger, then in England.

9 Yet although we should grant, that Catholics were bound to receive the
Sacrament of Confirmation, and to receive it from a Bishop, it follows not
that it must be had from a Bishop subject at least to all those penal laws
which are enacted against English Catholics, and Priests. For matters might be
so disposed, as some Bishop from abroad, and only taking England, ^s it were
by the way, might confirm more in three months, then my Lord of Chalcedon in
seven years, according to the proportion kept, since the times waxed more
hard: especially if such a Bishop did administer Confirmation to children,
according to the common practice of the Church in ancient times, and of the
Eastern Church at this day, and as some relate, of some country nearer us,
where children, two, or three years old, are wont to be confirmed: See Layman
lib. 5. tract. 3. cap. 6. n. 1.
which practice may seem very fit for our country, both because Confirmation
cannot often, and easily be had; and also that by this means children during
the time of innocence, when they are sure to receive the grace of the
Sacrament, might be armed, against the dangers of future persecution. But in
this, if any difficulty appear, his Holiness would vouchsafe to ordain, what
might be most expedient for the particular case of England: and by this means,
within some compass of years, most Catholics living, would find themselves
to have the Sacrament of Confirmation.

10 Further if we did yield to M. Doctor, that for some sort of persecution,
though very great, we ought not to want the Sacrament of confirmation: yet when
the persecution is of such nature, that it hinders the Bishop from
administering that very Sacrament for which he comes, except but to a few, no
man can with reason say, that such a persecution, does not excuse from
obligation of receuing that Sacrament from a Bishop. That our persecution is of
this quality experience tells us.

11 Moueroner we must still remember the number of Catholics in England,
which I have touched in the precedent question: and that of those Catholics,
all the clergy have had Confirmation abroad, as likewise diverse of the layety,
either in Seminaries, or otherwise in the^r travels: those who are in England,
being so secret, and dispersed as they are, diverse of them could scarcely have
that Sacrament, although a Bishop should be still in England: all which
considered, we shall find that the number of those who want, and can receive
the foresaid Sacrament, is not so great as at first sight may seem, and
therefore still the difficulty on M. Doctors side is greater to prove, that
for such a number, it is necessary to have a Bishop for Confirmation, although
by that means the persecution should be increased against all.

12 Finally, though we should grant all, and more then with reason can be
desired; yet M. Doctor will not have proved his intent, till first he effect
an impossibility, namely, that this his opinion, which he is the first to put
in print, is so evident, and certain, that the contray is void of
probability. For till then, Catholics are sure, they may with a safe
consience, keep their goods, liberties, and lives for some more necessary, and
better warranted o^casion, by conforming their practice to the contrary of that
which M. Doctor teaches; especially seeing he himself, in his 14. chap. n.
3. does but fearfully deliver this doctrine, saying: I am of opinion (which I
humbly s^bmit to authority) that a particul^r Church cannot except any long
time against having a Bishop, for fear of persecution. And n 8. he only says,
I think neither any Country nor any one of the Country, for fear of
persecution can oppose against the coming in of a Bishop, though thereby only
the sacrament of Confirmation should be wanting. We see; according to his own
confession it is but his opinion, and thinking, which I hope he will not not
bind all other to follow, although it were in deed probable, as I have
demonstrated it not to be.

13 And I should wish M. Doctor to be of my mind, if it were but, least
otherwise, he might seem to dissent, in judgment from my Lord of Chalcedon
himself: who upon occasion of speech, about some authority (nothing touching
Confirmation) which his Lordship pretended, said plainly, that unless he did
compass those pretenses, he would leave all; which my Lord, a man of so great
learning and zeal, would never have uttered, if he had conceived, the very
receiving of Confirmation to be of so great necessity, that for it alone, all
Catholics are obliged to endure increase of persecution: for if the matter be
so, that sacrament alone were likewise a very sufficient cause of my Lords
stay in England, although other pretenses should not sucseede; especially it
being a certain doctrine of Deu^nes, that Bishops have greater obligation to
administer Confirmation, then people to receue it. Moreover seeing my Lord has
styled himself Ordinary of Scotland, doubtless he would extend his charity to
that kingdom, if he were of M. Doct. opinion, concerning the necessity of
Confirmation, in a country groaning under a heavy persecution, as at this
present the Catholics of Scotland do, and therefore stand in greater need of
that Sacrament. Neither do I think M. Doctor will condemn of deadly sin
the Catholics of Scotland, for not seeking to have a Bishop, to administer
that Sacrament, or my Lord of Chalcedon, for not going to administer it. But
now let us see, what M. Doctor in his 14. chapter, where he handles this
point, does bring in proof of his doctrine.

14 His first argument is, because without confirmation we cannot be perfect
Christians, seeing according to S. Thomas by confirmation we receive our
perfect growth. To this I have already answered, and now only wish the reader
to be mindful, that according to S. Thomas, confirmation (and consequently the
effect thereof, for example, perfect growth, and whatsoever else) may be had
without a Bishop, and so if M. Doctor will stick to S. Thomas, his opinion
must go down. 15 Then he alleges S. Clement Epist. 4. saying thus: Omnibus
ergo festinandum est sine morarenasci Deo, and demum consignari ab Episcopo; id
est, septiformem gratiam Spiritus Sancti percipere, quia incertus est
vniuscuiusque exitus vitae. Quum autem regeneratus fuerit per aquam, and
postmodum septiformis spiritus gratia ab Episcopo confirmatus, quia aliter
perfectus esse Christianus nequaquam poterit etc. All therefore must make haste
without delay to be regenerated to God, and then to be consigned by the Bishop,
that is to receive the seuenfold grace of the Holy Ghost, because the end of
every ones life is uncertain. But when he shall be regenerated by water, and
afterward confirmed by the Bishop, with the seuenfold grace of the Spirit,
because otherwise he cannot be a perfect Christian etc. To this authority I
answer.

16 First M. Doctor should not have grounded so hard a doctrine, upon an
Epistle, which I suppose he knows, not to be so authentical, as to settle
thereon a doctrinall point, as he may see by Bellarmine in his book de
Scriptoribus Ecclesiasticis. Secondly, I may answer, out of Estius, in that
very place, which M. Doctor cyted out of him for the necessity of
confirmation, in time of persecution: and it seems not fair dealing to bring
Estius, as far as he seems for his purpose, and not so much as take notice,
or confute, what in the same author, in the same place, and to the same
purpose, he finds against him. Estius therefore observes, that the Fathers,
when they say, that without Confirmation, faithful people are not perfectly,
or fully Christians, do generally allude, to the name of Christ, which
signifies Anointed, and therefore they deny, that they are fully Christians,
who have not received Episcopal Unction, namely, having reference to the word
Christians, as S. Augustinel 17. ciuit. cap. 4. says, that all who are
anointed with Chrisme, may rightly be called Christi, Christ's. By this is
clear^ on what sense the words of Clement (cyted by M. Doctor) are to be
understood. Thus far Estius; whom M. Doctor highly commends for a learned,
and holy man, and the reader may see, how directly he does not only answer M.
Doctors argument, but also says that it is clear in what sense the words of
S. Clement are to be understood. It seems a hard case, when M. Doctor is
forced to allege Estius as his chief Author for the necessity of
Confirmation (as afterward we shall see) who in the very same place,
destroys a maine gro^d, brought by M. Doctor for the necessity of the same
Sacrament.

Thirdly, there occurreth an answer clearly deduced out of S. Clements own
words, and, I doubt not, but will fully satisfye the learned reader. The common
practice of the ancient Church was (and is yet in the Eastern Church, and at
Rome when converted jews, or Turks ar^ solemnly baptized) together with
Baptism to give the Sacrament of Confirmation, and so, whosoever in those
times was not confirmed, wanted also Baptism, and hence S. Clement might well
say that he that was not baptized, and confirmed, was not a perfect Christian.
But this is far from proouing that without confirmation, as separated from
Baptism, we cannot be perfectly Christians. This sense is manifest, if we
ponder S. Clements words: for having said: All must make haste to be
regenerated to God, and then to be consigned by the Bishop, he says not
afterward: But when he shall be confirmed by the Bishop, because otherwise he
cannot be a perfect christian, but still joins it with baptism, and says:
But when he shall be regenerated by water, and afterward confirmed by the
Bishop, because otherwise he cannot be a perfect Christian still, as I said,
repeating together both those sacraments, because they were wont to be
administered at one time, and whosoever had, or wanted one infallibly, had or
wanted both of them, and in that manner it was all one to say, one was not
confirmed, as to say, he was not baptized. Besides S. Clements discourse ( All
must make have to be regenerated to God, and then to be consigned by the
Bishop, because the end of every ones life as uncertain, makes it clear that
his speech is of Baptism. For howesoeuer necessary Confirmation be, yet
certainly it is not of so great have as S. Clement urges: yea it is che^fly
for those who are to live, and have occasion to profess there faith, as S.
Thomas alleges out of Pope Melchiades, S. Tho. 3. p. q. 72. a. 8. (...). 4.
and therefore it had been an unfit reason of S. Clement, to hasten men to
confirmation, because the end of every ones life is uncertain, for, as I said,
the less certainety we have of life, and more vicinity to death, the less
necessity we have of Confirmation: but for Baptism his reason of the
uncertainty of man's last end, is very fit, and urgent: and therefore it is
clear, S. Clements speech is refered to the sacrament of Baptism.

My fourth answer is, that S. Clement is not faithfully alleged by M.
Doctor. For S. Clement, after he had said: When he shall be regenerated by
water, and afterward, Confirmed by the Bishop with the seuenfold grace of the
Spirits, because otherwise he cannot be a perfect Christian (where M. Doctor
ends with an etc.) immediately adds words, wherein the very point in ^u^stion
consists, saying: St non necessitate, sed incuria sic, aut voluntate
remanserit: if he shall remain so, not by necessity, but by carelessness, or
voluntarily. What good dealing this is, I leave to the censure of an impartial
reader. Our case is when Confirmation cannot be had without hazard of goods,
liberty, and life. S. Clement speaks in case it be omitted, not upon
necessity, but carelessely, and voluntarily. What is this against us? Nay, is
it not clearly for us against M. Doctor? For S. Clement affirming, that
without Confirmation, we cannot be perfect Christians, if it be omitted without
necessity, must be supposed to mean, that such as want it upon necessity, and
not by will, may without i^ be perfect Christians, other wise his exception, of
necessity, were in vain Still M. D. cites Authors, which prove against
himself, when they are cited aright. Fif^^ly I answer to this, and all the
like arguments, or authorities that M Doct. stil^failes in his proofe^. For if
he will needs urge, that without confirmation we are not perfect Christians in
some particular sense, then he must prove that there is a precept for us to be
perfect Christians in that sense, and also that such a particular perfection
cannot be had, but by Confirmation. For as for absolute perfection (consisting
in Grace, and Charity) without the sacrament of Confirmation ^t has been, and
is had, by many holy men militant on earth, and Blessed Saints triumphan^ in
Heaven; among who n^l may reckon many of our constant Confessors and glorious
Martyrs, to whose powerful intercession, and plentiful merits I most humbly
commend my imperfect soul. And I wonder M. Doctor would seek to terrify
people with the Confused sound of imperfect Christ's anity seeing when all comes
to all, he himself chap. 14 n. 7. does not deny, but that in Catholic
Countries, Confirmation may be omitted by particular persons without a morcall
sin; and n. 9 he further confesses, that every man in particular, cannot be
condemned of sin^e for omitting Confirmation, for fear of loosi^g his life,
lands, and liberty: and number. 7. he only sayth^ that it may seem pres^^otion
to omit it when it may commodiously be had. By all which it is clear that not
to be a perfect Christian in that sense, i^ not so fearful a thing as the
words may see^e to import, before they be distinctly explicated, and resolved
into their true meaning, as I have endeavored to do in the beginning of this
question, by occ^sion of S. Thomas his doctrine, that by con^irmation we get
our perfect growth. And M. Doctor will not easily prove, that a whole Country
is obliged rather to suffer inc^ease of persecution, then want a Bishop for
Confirmation, seeing he grants, that every man in particular, cannon be
cond^mned of sin, for omitting Confi^mation, f^^ fear of loosing, his life,
lands, or liber^y^ for as it is true, that the spiritual good of many, is
more to be weighed, then of any one in particular: so like wise the general
persecution of a whole Country, is more to be avoided, then of any priu^te
person who yet, as M. Doctor confesses, is not obliged to hazard goods, or
life, for enjoying the Sacrament of Confirmation.

17. M. Doctor immediately before S. Clement cites S. Dionysius Areopagita l.
d^ eccles. Hier. cap. 5. calling the Sacrament of Confirmation, a perfitting
and consummating Unction. But I fear M. Doctor, will prove no more exact in
this allegation, then he has been in so many other. For in Saint Denny, his
fifth chapter cited by M. Doctor, I find no such matter. In his fourth chapter,
he speaks expressly of the oil used in Baptism, which Sacrament he
terms diuinus ortus, a divine birth, or regeneration, by which he says
Original sin is forgiven. Saint Dennys, speaks also sometime generally of
the virtue of Oil, or Vaction, used not only in diverse Sacraments, but also in
consecration of Aultars. But what is this for M. Doctors purpose?
Nevertheless, if S. Dennys either in the chapter cited by M. Doctor, or in
any other place, call confirmation a perfitting and consummating Unction, it is
nothing against us, who grant, that confirmation gives indeed a perfection to
the receyuer, but not such a perfection, as may not be gotten by other means,
as above we have demonstrated, and cannot be denied.

18. His other chief argument is out of Estius, in these words: Es^ius in 4.
a^s^. 7. u. 18.
Quod si quaer as etc. But if thou ask, whether the omission of Confirmation
when it can commodiously be had, be a mortal, or venial sin? I answer,
that it cannot be omitted without mortal sin, in time and place of
persecution of faith, when namely there is danger to a man by reason of
infirmity least he deny his faith in word or doed, or at least be ashamed to co
fesse (his faith) when he should: otherwise I think it only a venial, sin,
so there be not contempt. I answer, that although Estius in some thing
concerning the Sacrament of Confirmation, hold against the common doctrine of
other Deuines: yet in this particular he is nothing against us For his very
demand as it is set down by M. Doctor answers for us, seeing his question
is, what sin it is to omit Confirmation when it can commodiously he had,
which is not our case, but the quite contrary, namely, that it cannot only not
be had commodiously, by reason of the persecution, and liwes common to all
Priests (which were enough to put it out of the case proposed by Estius) but
also, because we expressly suppose, that the very having a Bishop for
Confirmation, is to increase the persecution: which I wonder M. Doctor did not
remember, it being his own supposition in the very title of his 14. chapter,
and in the same chapter is by him diverse times repeated. Yea, Estius by
proposing the question as he does, supposes, that there cannot so much as
question be made, of any obligation to receive Confirmation, in case it cannot
commodiously be had. And finally M. Doctor himself (as I related above) number.
7. only says: It may seem a presumption to neglect it (confirmation)
espec^^lly in time of perse^ution, when it may co^modiously be haa: Ergo, M
Doctou^ seems to suppose the omission of Confirmation to be noe sin, when it
cannot commodiously be had, which is our very case: Besides, Estius speaks,
in time, and place of such persecution of says, as brings with it danger of
a man's denying has faith, which, thanks be to God, we may say, is not our case
in England, where for so many years of most hoate persecution, without the
Sacrament of Confirmation, the zeal, and constancy of Catholics was so
admirable, as God grant the like were seen, in these our days.

19 His last argument, is out of a conjecture that without Confirmation, if one
fall not, others probably will, as (says he) Nouatus did for want of it, for
which he cyteth Eusebius. This example of Nouatus he brings not only here,
but in diverse other places of his book, as if it were some master piece. To
his conjecture, I hope to have given already a full answer. For Nouatus, I
find noe such thing in Eusebius as M. Doctor alleges (and I have seen,
Eusebius. lib. 6. Hist. ca. 35. edit. Col^^.
and considered more impressions then one) but only Eusebius, out of Cornelius,
in an Epistle to Fabius, recounteth that he fell, persecutionis tempore, metis
debilitatus, et ni^^i a vite cupiditate adductus: In time of persecution,
weak^ned with fear, and mooned with too much desire of life. Still M. Doctor
has ill fortune in alleging authors. It may well be that Nouatur sell for
want of Confirmation; yet I deny that Eusebius says so, or that the case of
our English Catholics is not infinitely different from his. First, he
differred to be baptized til he was forced with danger of sickness, which
delay was a thing vehemently reprehended, by the Fathers of ancient times, in
so much that when Nouatus was to take holy Orders, both the clergy, and lay
men, did oppose it; Quoni^^ (says Eusebius) minime licebat, quequam in lecto
propter morbum baptizatum, sicut huic contigerat, in Clerum assumt. Because it
was not lawful, for any man baptized in bed, by reason of sickness, as he
was, to be promoted to the Clergy. Afterward, morbo clapsus, neque catera
quibus post Baptismum, secundum Ecclesia Canonem, imbui oportuer at,
acquisiuit, neque Domine sigillo ab Episcopo obsignatus fuit. He being
recovered, omitted both other things which after Baptism according to the
Cano^t of the Church he should have had, and also Confirmation; which Sacrament
he might have received without danger, as other Christians did: and besides,
this neglect was, when he had a particular obligation to ^^ce^ue that
Sacrament, namely before he took holy Orders. All which things considered, I
leave it to any indifferent man's judgment, whether it be not some injury to
English Catholics, that they should by M. Doctor be frighted with danger of
lapse, by the example of Nouatus, in whom so many soul causes of falling did
concur. For, besides all that has been said, there was another fault, which
might as soon be cause of his fall as any other offense, according to the
saying of our Savior. Quise exaltat, humiliabitur. Luc. 8.14.
He who exalts himself, shall be humbled. For, as Eusebius in the place above
cited expressly records, the fellow was ambitious. What? Ambition in those
primitive ages? in those sad times of persecution? so it was. Wherein did his
ambition consist? In desire to be a Bishop.

THE FIFTH QVESTION. Concerning M. Doctors Comparison betwen^ Bishops,
inferior Pastors, and Religious men.
1 MVCH against my will, I am forced to handle this point, by occasion of M.
Doctor his Treatise, through all which, and particularly in his 11. chapter,
he speaks with overmuch partiality, and disadvantage of Religious state, in
comparison of Bishops, and other inferior Pastors, or Curates. First then we
will speak of Bishops; and in the second place, of other Postours.

2 As for the first, to the end we may not err in generalities, which breed
confusion, nor deceive our selves with specious words, not well understood: it
is to be observed, that there be two States of perfection; the one, a state
wherein we acquire perfection, the other, wherein we are to pr^ctise perfection
already acquired, with this difference, that the former state yeildeth
abundant means, to get that perfection, which it professes; the other is to
practice perfection, for attaining whereof, within it self, it yeildeth not
such means, but only presupposes, that the person by other means, must have
gotten perfection, if he will exercise his function, and office as he ought.
And hence resulteth a second difference, that the former state professes to
perfect a man in himself, and by consequence makes him also more fit to
perfect others: The second, of it self is ordained to the perfecting of
others, and unless a man otherwise be perfect, humane frailty considered, may
endanger his own soul: and therefore that same division of states, which
other authors give under the terms: perfectionis acquisitae, et acquir^^dae,
of perfection already gotten, and to be go^ten: Caiet: 2.2.^.189. a. 3 Suarez.
de Rel. Tom. 3. lib. 1. cap. 14. n^^.
Caietan calls statum perfectionis propria, vel alienae, a state of perfecting
a man's self, or of perfecting others, which, s^^th Suarez, is all one with the
other diu^sion

3 It ought not to be denied, that a man by doing works to perfect others,
does perform actions, of themselves meritorious, and perfectiue of the doer:
yet unless they be also done with perfection (which cannot be, unless a man
by other means be perfect) they are more apt to hurt, then help, by reason of
great imperfections, and manifold dangers, to which, by the evil performing of
so noble actions, the party himself is subject. Let us hear that divine
Bishop, and Martyr, S. Dyonis. Eccles. Hie^^rch. c. 3.
S. Dionysius Ar^^pag^ta speaking to this purpose: Vt in solis radijs
tenuiores, limpidior esque, substantiae, primae influents luce replentur,
sicque exuberante^^ lucemin subsequentes, solis vice transfundunt: ita non sine
periculo diuinis in rebus, quibusque aliis se ducem praestare presumet, qui non
per omnia euaserit similis De^. As in the sun beams, the more transparent,
and clearer parts are the first to be filled with infused light, and then
instead of the sun, do transfuse an excessive light into other ad^oyning
parts: so he who is not become like to God, shall not without danger presume
to guide others in matters belonging to God. Hence it was, that all holy men
did so much labor to avoid so high a dignity, as Histories are full: and not
long since, a famous secular Doctor, coming to die, did say, that he took it
from God as a sign of Predestination to eternal bliss Quod non ^^uisset
Episcopum fieri that he had not permitted him to be made Bishop. Hist. soc.
Ies^ Tom. 2. ^^b. 1. n. 135.
Yet whosoever, against his will, is truly called to such a state, may, and
ought to conside, that God who imposed the burden, will afford strength to
support it with great n^er^t.

4 But these two states (of perfect^^^ already acquired, or, to be acquired,
or, of perfecting ones self, and perfecting others) are not so distinguished,
that they must of necessity be always separated. For although a secular
Bishop, be only in a state of perfecting others: yet a Bishop Regular, is in
state of perfitting himself, and others; and those Religious men, who by there
institute, beside their own perfection, attend also to the help of there
neighbor* are both in state of perf^tting themselves, and also in the state of
perf^tting others, according to that measure, perfection, and multiplicity of
measure, wherewith they are furnished to help their neighbor. For within the
latitude of obedience, vowed by such Religious men, the actions of
illuminating, or perfitting others are comprehended: and such Religious, not
only as they attend to their own salvation, but also as they profess the
helping of others, are properly in a state, because they have a perpetual
obligation to both those kind of works; and even as they are employed in help
of their neighbors, in this respect, they excel Secular Curates, who
according to S. Thomas. and M. Doctor himself, are not properly in a state
(which requires immobility) as hereafter we shall see. The same Religious
differ also, from a Regular Bishop; because to be a Regular is merely
accidental to Episcopal state, but the very vows of those Religious, whose
proper Institute is to perfect, both themselves, and others, should wholly
cease, if they were restrained, only to their own perfection. Moreover
superiors in all Religions, if by their laws they be perpetual, are in a
particular manner in both the foresaid states of perfection, as in my next
question shall be declared. Now, I speak of Religious in general, abstracting
from particular Institutes, or Offices, as also of Bishops, not considering,
whether they be Secular, or Regular,

5 This being presupposed, it is not hard to answer the first comparison: by
saying, that a Bishop is in a state, which supposes perfection already
acquired, and a Religious man in a state, not supposing, but yielding means
for acquiring perfection. The Bishop is in a state ordained of it self to
perfect others: A Religious men in the state of perfecting himself. And this
is a^l that Deuines understand, when they say, that Bishops are Illuminatours,
and Perfectours; others to be illuminated, and perfected. The Bishop then is in
a state, which presupposes, but does not give perfection, which a Religious
state does not presuppose, but give: so that we may truly say: The state of a
Bishop is higher, the state of a Religious mon happier: That more to be
honored; this rather to be embraced. And hence it is, that the more voluntary,
the election of a Religious life is, the more commendable it is, and
contr^riwise, the state of a Bishop is so much more securely undertaken, the
less it has of a man's own will, and election, but proceeds from necessity,
o^ such Obedience, as cannot be contradicted. For the more such a dignity is
pretended, the greater danger it apporteth.

6 That the state of Bishops, does not so wholly ouersway the Religious state,
as that there be not many good things in Religion, which are wanting in
Episcopal state, is manifest by many reasons. A vow made of not accepting a
Bishopric, is valid, and holy: A vow not to become Religious, is wicked, and
of noe force. If one have vowed Religion, he does not satisfy his vow by
accepting a Bishopric, as is defined cap. Pe^tuas de voto: where the Pope
answers to one, who after a vow of Religion, had accepted a Bishopric: Vt
si conscuntiam suam sanare desiderat, Episcopatum relinquat, et votum suum
impleat. If he would cure his soul, he should relinquish his Bishopric, and
fulfill his vow. And that this was not only a Counsel, or merely for
avoiding scandal, is proved out of S. Thomas. For he brings it, S. Tho. ^. ^.
q. 189. a 3. ad 1.
in proof of another matter, which certainly obliges of it self,
abstracting from scandal, namely, that a certain Priest, who after a simple
vow of Religion, accepted an Ecclesiastical Benefice, was bound in conscience
to leave all, and enter into Religion, which, as I said, he proves by the
aforesaid cap. Per tuas. What the Pope declared of him who had a vow of entering
into Religion, may with proportion be applied to a purpose, or vocation to such
a state, that it is not, in the sight of God, satisfied by another course of
life, although it were a higher calling. Besides, to desire a Religious state,
is by the whole Church of God commended, and all vows are changed into
Religious Profession; To desire a Bishopric, even for what is best in it,
namely for the good of souls, according to S. Thomas 2.2. q. 185. ar. 1.
seems presumption; Valent. Tom. 3. disput. 10. q. 3. punct. 2.
and there wants not, who says, that commonly it is a deadly sin, but this
belongs not to me to define. Only, out of the premises, I may infer, that
something there must be, wherein a Religious state, surpasses that of a
Bishop; otherwise it were not lawful to vow, not to accept a Bishopric,
seeing no lawful vow can be made of that, which hinders matus bonum, a good
in all respects greater: A vow of Religion might be fulfilled by being a
Bishop, if to be a Bishop, were wholly better: To desire, yea to procure a
Bishopric, were noe less commendable, then the desire, or seeking to be a
Religious man, if the state of a Bishop, do contain the whole perfection, and
commodity of a Religious state. Moreover to be made a Bishop does not dissolve
Matrimonium ratum, matrimony contracted, but not consummated, Joan. 22. in
extran^g. vnica de voto.
as Ioannes 22. does define of holy Orders: but it is a point of Faith, that
Rel^gious Profession does d^ssolue it. A Religious man when he is made Bishop
does still remain a Religious man, S. Thom. 2 2. q. 185. (...). 8.
as S. Thomas teaches out of the Canons, and it is the common consent of
Deuines; so as if a Bishop with leave renounce his Bishopric, and return to
his religious Order, he need not make a new Profession: A Bishop, if he become
Reliligious, forsakes all that belongs to the Jurisdiction, and office of a
Bishop. The same Angelical Doctor 2.2. q. 184. a. 8. ad 4. says, that it is
an argument to prove the excellency of Religious me^ above Pastors inferior
to Bishop, as Curates, or Archdeacons, that when such enter into Religion they
wholly relinquish their former offices; whereas Religious men, being made
Curates, never cease to be Religiou^. If this be so, I may likewise thence
argue, some great perfect^io^ in a Religious state, which for Episcopal
dignity is not relinquished, whereas a Bishop entering into Religion leaves all
Episcopal I^risdiction, and functions: Vole^t tom. 3. disp. 10. q. 2. pi^^cto
4.
yea there want not who affirm, that a Religious man is not made Bishop
without some dispensation; and Boniface the 8. in cap. si ^eligiosus de elect.
in 6. makes void the consent of a Religious man, accepting of his own election
to Prelacy, without leave asked, and obtained of his Superiors, and in
punishment of that fault, does make inualide the election it self. Wherefore,
as a Bishop cannot become Religious without leave of the Pope; so a Religious
man according to the Canons, cannot so much as ye^ld his consent to be elected
a Bishop, without leave of his Superior: yea there is this difference, that
the consent of a Religious man, without his Superiors leave, is unlawful, and
inualide: But a Bishop elected may freely without any leave enter into
Religion, becau^^ by his election, ^ll he be confi^med in his Bishopric, there
is contracted noe spiritual marriage b^^wixt him and his Church; and in this
there is the same reason of a Bishop only Delegate, in respect of that
country, for which he has no more, then a Breue of Delegation, and ad
beneplacitum, because a Bishops spiritual marriage is only with that Church. of
which he has his Title (for Marriages are not ad beneplacitum, but require
permanency) yea a Bishop both elected, and confirmed, if without leave he
Profess in Religion, the act is valid; and that it is not also lawful,
proceeds not from the nature, or any intrinsecall, and inseparable perfection
of Episcopal dignity, but only from the Churches prohibition; as likewise the
inseparable Marriage, betwixt the Bishop, and his Church, arises only from
Ecclesiastical command, according to the truer opinion of Deuines: for we
daily see renunciations of Bishoprics, and translations of Bishops from one
Diocese to another, upon ordinary occasions, which could neither be lawful,
nor valid, if the marriage betwixt the Bishop, and his Church, were de iure
diuino, a divine precept. For, in divine precepts, the Pope cannot validly
dispense, without some particular cause, and yet if the Pope once give leave
for a Bishop to renounce his Bishopric, the renunciation is valid, although
we should suppose no cause at all. And finally, to give a Bishop leave to
become Religious, there is required no other cause, beside the private good of
the Bishops soul, supposing his Church be otherwise provided of a sufficient
Pastor. All which considerations, are manifest arguments, that somewhat may be
found in a Religious state, wanting in the state of a Bishop, although still it
is true, that the state of a Bishop is higher.

If any demannd, wherein this particular perfection of a Religious state
consists? My answer is, that for full satisfaction to this question, I wish
the Reader could once peruse, that golden book, of Hieronymus Platus, de bono
Status Religiosi, where he shall find this argument, so copiously, solidly,
and eloquently handled, that he will never repent himself, of having red, so
pleasant, and profitable a volume. In brief, I say, that it may seem to
consist, in multitude, facility, continuation, and perfection of perpetual
acts of virtue, and effectual means, speedily to get, securely to conserve,
and plentifully to increase perfection, which if we speak properly as it is
intended to be gotten by a sta^e of perfection, consists not in charity
howsoever, but either in multitude, and perfection of Acts of charity, with as
much continuation, and little interruption, as our mortal life will give leave,
or else in an Habit, with particular reference to the said frequency, and
continuation of such Acts, as Su^rez does well explicate this matter. Suarez.
de Rel. tom. 3. l. c. 4.
And clear it is, that for attaining of such a perfection, as we have
described, upon earth there is no state, Suarez. loc. cit. c. 19. n. 22.
like to that of a Religious life, wherein (says the same learned Divine) a
man both auoydes the dangers, to which Bishops are exposed, and by multitude
of holy works, may recompense, the want, of some perfect actions, proper to
Episcopal state.

8 To all which, we must add, that these advantages are found in Religious
state, in a particulari excellent manner, namely, in a kind of life, proper to
the time of Grace, by observance of the three Evangelical Counsels, Poverty,
Chastity, and Obedience, which, S. Tho. 1.2. q. 104. a. 4. in corp.
as (...). Thomas teaches, are proper to the New law. And truly, abstracting
from all other respects, the Counsels of Poverty, and Chastity, have I know
not what prerogative, by being in a manner consecrated by the Practice, and, as
I may say, deified in the Person of him, who for our sake, and to give example
of all virtue, vouchsafed to assume our nature. And in this particular, there
appears a maine difference, betwixt a Religious man, and a Bishop, who is not
at all bound to poverty, and to chastity, he is obliged only as other Priests,
by a vow annexed to holy Orders, which yet proceeds but from the Churches
Ordination: in so much as a Bishop, not in holy Orders, Elected, may lawfully
marry, and some also hold, that a Bishop confirmed, may do the same, but of
this I do not dispute, yet if he marry it is valid. For my part, I had rather
want whatsoever perfection, wherein a Bishop may surpass a Religious man, then
be in a state, not requiring of its nature and essence Chastity, as the state
of a Bishop does not, whereas the state of a Religious man does necessarily,
and essentially imply that Angel-like perfection. Besides, if by occasion of
sollicitous, and exact endeavor, to observe the only vow of Chastity, with
great purity, and perfection, all virtuous Priests by experience find, how
many other virtues must be practiced, and come annexed with that one, what
shall we say of the triple knot of Chastity, Poverty, and Obedience? How many
virtues must in it, be necessarily tied together?

9 With these commodities, proper to Religious state, are to be joined, two
other, most important considerations, of security, and Immobility, wherein a
Religious state, exceeds that of a Bishop. Security from evil, and
Immobility in good, are great points of happynes, and participations of the
Saints felicity in Heaven. And in the business of our salvation, every small
addition to true, and not presumptuous Hope, ought to be greatly esteemed. For
as Philosophers say, that a less knowledge of more perfect objects, for
example, of God, or Angels, is to be preferred, before a greater knowledge of
inferior things, as of the elements, or mixed bodies: so in matters that
concern Eternity, a state more secure, and less subject to change, is in
that, to be preferred, before a state, higher, but not so secure, or
immovable. It was a worthy saying, of a great Preacher, that men in election
of Episcopal state, are apt to have their eyes upon certain considerations,
which would quickly vanish, if they made another reckoning, and duly pondered,
for how many souls they are accountable; and perhaps they would find, that
even in a rich Bishopric, they pawn their own soul, for so great a number
of other men's, that for each one, they receive in payement, not a shilling by
the year, and inferior pastors, scarce two pence for each soul committed to
their chardge. A dreadful reckoning! It was likewise a wise, and witty
conceit, of another great man, that in this world, me^ are most esteemed for
Gratiis gratis datis, that is, for such gifts of God, as have reference to our
neighbor, as learning, power of working miracles etc. and I may add, highness
of degree and the like; But in the next life he shall be most regarded, who is
most replenished, with gratiis gratium facientibus, such gifts, as render a
soul amiable, in the eyes of almighty God, as Humility, Poverty, Obedience,
Chastity, mortification of our will, and passions, and the like; and that the
distribution of Superiors, and Inferiors theare, will be in a far different
fashion, from what we behold here. Whatsoever therefore in speculatio^, be
truly said of the height, and dignity of Episcopal state (which indeed cannot
be too much exalted) yet in practice, and for election, a Religious state by a
particular man, ordinarily is to be preferred, as more secure^ yea, for this
respect of security, and in regard of innumerable other helps, Ita docent Rich.
in 4. d 38. art. 6 quest. 1. Angel. verb Religion number. 16. cited by Suar. de
Rel. tom. 3. l. 5. c. 8. n. 2. who says that it is a thing to be noted.
which make sweet, and easy the apprehended burden, and yoke of a Religious
life, some good Deuins expressly teach, that every one should judge a
Religious state to be agreeable to his forces, unless by certain conjecture,
or experience, he be assured of the contrary. That a Religious state, is also
more immovable, then that of a Bishop, has been already sufficiently proved,
because Bishops daily leave, or change their Bishoprics, by diverse ways, but
a Religious man, never cease to be such, even although he be assumed to the
highest state in Gods Church, which is that of a Bishop. Besides, the
immobility of a Religious state, arises from the obligation of perpetual
vows, which certainly bind by the law of God; but it is not certain, that
the Marriage of a Bishop with his Church, proceeds from any Divine precept,
yea it is more probable, that it comes only from the Ordination of the Church,
as before has been touched.

10 Neither is this perfecton of a Religious state profit^ble to the Religious
man alone, but oftentimes disposes him further, to the helping of his
neighbors, with much security, profit, freedom, and extensio^, as S. Fer
ardirus Senensis, after refusal of three Bishoprics, professed that he would
not be tied to such a dignity, to the end he might mors ple^tiful^y, and freely
bestow himself upon the helping of his neighbor: and a certain famors
preacher, after he had been from Religion, assumed to a Bishopric, was
accustomed to say, that it hapened to him, as to a virgin, who before marriage
is respected, and much sought after, but being placed in wedlock, is as it were
forgotten: so he while he remained a private Religious man, was followed by
innumerable multituds, but after his contract with a particular Church, few did
look after him. And not unlike to this was that prudent saying of a holy,
learned, and wise Bishop, who was most willing that one of his clargie should
enter into a certain Religious Order, because (said truly zealous Prelate)
whereas otherwise might have a Parish Priest, but in some one Church by taking a
Religious course, he would be, as it were, a Curate, in many O^ocesses: And
there have not wanted Religious men, who refused a gre^ter honor, then
Episcopal, not only for humility, but particularly that by remaining in
Religion, they might be more useful, for the common good of souls.

11 The perfection of a Bishop consists in this, that by his office he is
obliged to enlighten others, and if occasion require, to give his life for his
flock, which occasion seldom happens. To those two obligations, the Bishop
is tied by Justice, in regard of maintenance, and honor afforded him by his
flock, or by the virtue of Fidelity, in respect of a centaine implicit pact,
where by he obliges himself when he is made Bishop. But Religions men,
merely upon charity, or Religion (more noble virtues, then Justice or,
Fidelity) do illuminate others, and adventure their lives for the saving of
souls: whereto some Religious are obliged, not only by their Institute, but by
particular vow, made to that effect. And here I cannot but cast my self, at
the feet of our Reverend, English Clergy, who for sole Charity without
expectation of any recompense except from God, do faithfully labor the
conversion of our Country, and I make bold to say, they would be untimely
Counselors, if any should be making I know not what propositions, of Parishes,
and Parish Priests, whereby nothing else could be in these times gained, but
the change of Charity, into some inferior virtue, and forfeyture of that
glory, commended by our Savior, to his Apostles; Gratis accop^stis; gratis
date, Matt. 10.8.
what you have freely received, bestow freely: to say nothing of the strict
obligation, which by being Curates, they should undergo for so poor wages as
before has been touched. Sure I am, that diverse of our Clergly, would never
have been Priests, but that by occasion of the present state of England, they
might without any recompense, help, and voluntarily expose their lives for the
good of others.

12 Merit does not consist in office, but in the acts thereof. Let the whole
worlds experience decyde, whether Secular Pastors, or Religious men, do in
fact, more enlighten mankind, by preaching, reaching, filling libraries with
learned volumes, reducing heretics, through Europe; and converting infidels in
both the Indies, Iaponia, China, etc. So as their incessant labors, with
howerly hazard of their lives, have no more narrow extent, then the vast
course of the Suns motion: And the late Feast of one of these good men,
namely, S. Francis Xauier, puts me in mind of a Disticke, made of him, to this
very purpose: Nascitur occiduis; at Eois occidit oris,
Hoc tantum differt: caetera Solis habet.
He sets in the East, but rises in the West,
Except in this; a Sun he is for the rest.
This Charity of Religious men, in exposing their lives for the conversion of
Infidels, and of their greater fitnes, for that purpose the^ of secular
Priests, my Lord Phillip Rouenius, Archiepiscopus Philippensis, and the Popes
vicar for Holland, does plainly acknowledge, in his Treatise Demissionibus,
part tertia, with this addition, that, such places being once prepared by
Religious men, the secular Clergy were to enter into them: as if there could be
a better nurse for the Child, then the mother that brought it forth. S. Paul
says: 1. Cor. 4.15.
If you have ten thousand Pedagogues, yet not many Fathers, for I begot you in
Jesus Christ; insinuating, that one who has begotten a soul in Christ, by his
conversion, ought with him to be in greater reckoning, then ten thousand
Instructours, which yet the said Archbishop, a sauourer of the secular Clergy,
makes secular Priests to be, compared to Religious men, into whose labors he
would have them enter. But of the fitnes of Religious men, to preach,
administer Sacraments etc. I shall have occasion to speak after a while, and
now will address my self to the second comparison, betwixt Religious men, and
Pastors inferior to Bishops, to whose sacred Dignity we willingly yield
precedence, and therefore none can take it ill, that I have made longer stay,
in a lower place.

13 Yet before I end this point, I must set down what M. Doctor, in the end
of his 11. Chapter, says out of S. Thomas: S. Th. 2.2. q. 185. a 8. in co^p.
That the State of Religion is in way to perfection, and the State of a Bishop,
belonges to perfection as a certain maistership of perfection, Hen^ Gand. quod
lib. 12. (...). 29.
and (says he) Henricus de Gandauo handling this question, whether the
Religious ^or the Bishop be in the greater state of perfection, concludes in
th^se words: Status Praelatorum so h^thet ad statum Religiosorum etc. the state
of Prelates has that Comparison to the state of Religious, which the st^te of
masters, has to the state of scholars, but the master ought to be perfecter
th^n his sch^ller. And again: Quando aliques Religiosus deductus est ad summum
aliquid and perfec^um, tunc primum est idoneus, vt assummatur in Praelatum.
When a Religious man is brought ta an high, and perfect degree of perfection,
then first he is fit to be assumed for a Prelate. And so (says M. Doctor)
where a Religious man ends, there a Bishop or pastor begins, and the
Bishop lays his foundation, on the Religious man's top, and roof. But truly
this inference of M. Doctor is buil^ed upon a sandy foundation, and he must
either renounce the auctority of S. Thomas, or of Gandensis, for this Author
speaks of Prelates inferior to Bishops, wherein his doctrine is directly
against S Thomas, who as we shall see anon, ex prof^sso does prefer Religious
Priests, before such Pastors; And Henricus de Gandauo holds also, that all
such Pastors, even Parish Priests, are properly in a state, which is both
against S. Th. 2.2. q. 84. art. 6. and M. Doctor himself, who in his 11.
chap. number. 14. expressly says: To a state immobility is required, which the
Pastor, nor Bishop, has not. And lastly, the same Gandensis, in the question
by M. Doctor cyted, holds that to be in a State, is sufficient, to have a
purpose to remain therein, without any other obligation, or immobility, which
is not only against the common doctrine of Deuines, but also against M.
Doctor, in the said 11. Chapter number. 13. for which he alleges likewise S.
Thomas 2.2. q. 184. art. 4. where this doctrine is ex professo delivered. And I
wonder, M. Doctor would allege Gandensis particularly for Bishops, he
speaking of inferior Pastors; and why in his inference upon the said Authors
words, he should put in Bishop, or Pastor, saying, where a Religious man
ends, there a Bishop, or Pastor, begins, whereas before the said Authors
words, he had put only Bishop saying, Henricus a Gandauo handling this
question, whether the Religious, or the Bishop, be in the greater state of
perfection concludes etc. But most of all I wonder, that M. Doctor would
ground his saying, that a Bishop lays his foundation on the Religious man's
top and roof, upon a doctrine not true, whatsoever the thing inferred be in it
f^lfe, I mean, concerning the dignity of Bishops, whereof we have already
spoken at large. Certes, if Bishops lay their foundation, upon the most perfect
in Religious perfection, such as are taken immediately from a secular life, have
reason to look in good earnest, upon what top of perfection they lay their
foundation. And truly this doctrine of Gandensis ought to be a point of daily
meditation, for all secular P^stouis. Finally, out of this same place of
Ga^densis, M. Doctor might rightly have inferred, that Religious perfection is
an excellent disposition to make a good, and worthy Pastor, with greater
profit to others, and less danger to ones self. For there is great
diff^rence betwixt a master of Perfection, (as Gandensis said Pastors are)
and a master of Sciences, by teaching whereof the master himself both
renewes the memory of old, and increases in new knowledge: But while a man
teaches his neighbor to be perfect, he may be in danger to forget, and
impair his own souls good, unless he come well furnished with the
spiritual substance of solid virtues.

14 Now, as for the second comparison of Religious men with inferior Pastors,
it may be done; either by comparing them absolutely, which o^ them are more
perfect in themselves; or else relatiuely to others, which of them is more fit
to help souls, by preaching, teaching, administering Sacraments etc. In both
questions, I will refer my self, to that Cherubim for knowledge, and Seraphim
for sanctity, the Angelical Doctor S. Thomas of Aquin. He therefore 2.2. q.
184. art. 8. has this express question: Vtrum presbytri Curati, and
Arch^d^acon^, sint maior^s perfectionis, quam Religiosi: Whether Priests having
c^re of souls, and Archdeacons, be of greater perfection, then Religious men.
His resolut^on is, that in State, the Religious as Religious, excels the
secular Pastor, as Secular: If both of them be Priests, and both have care of
souls, as (says he) plertque Monachi, and Canonici Regulares habent, Most
part of Monks, and Canon Regulars have, they will be equal in Order, and Office;
so as the only question remaining, is; Whether a Religious Priest, by reason of
his State, be of greater perfection, then a Secular Priest Curate, in regard of
his Office? The Saints answer is, that in goodness the Religious Priest
excells, and the secular Curate in difficulty; bone conuersandi; of living
virtuously, amongst so many occasions of dangers in the world; which
difficulty, says he, in his answer ad 6. does not increase merit, because
that difficulty only increases merit, which arises from the nature of the
works in themselves, and not from extrinsecall occasions, not avoided by
secular persons, which difficulty of works in themselves is greater in
Religion, by reason of the strictness of Regular observance, besides that the
Religions do also merit much, by voluntary quitting themselves, of all such
dangers, and impediments, as swarm in the world. Wherefore according to S.
Thomas, the Religious Priest excels secular Pastors, in goodness, and in
that difficulty, which is both full of merit, and security; beside that
particular increase of merit, by flying from those impediments of the world
which m^ke the paths of virtue far more difficult: in so much as the same Saint
teaches, that the Religious state, in comparison of the Office of Pastors, is
like an Holocaust (the most perfect of all Sacrifices, wherein the whose victim
was bestowed on almighty God) compared to other sacrifices, which were in a
manner parted betwixt God, and man. The same verity S. Thomas proves, because
a Pastor may enter into Reli^ion and wholly cease to be a Pastor; but a
Rel^gious man is never so made Pastor, as he does not retain his Religious
stat; which is a sign, that the calling of a Pastor, is not so perfect as is
a Religious vocation. Moreover, the Canons of the Church do not only permit,
but also much commend the entering of Secular Pastors, into Religion, Quia
meliorem vitam se^ui cupiunt: (...)
Because they desire to embrace a better (...) de of life, says the Toleran
Council. And Gregory the Great, lib. 10. epist. 39. exhotteth, that by all
means such a spirit be nourished, saying: Quibus valetis adhortationibus,
Pastorali admonitione su^^endite, vt feruor huius desiderit in eo no^^epe^ eat.
By the best exhortation you are a^^^ inflame him (a secular Clergy man,
desirous to enter into Religion) that the fervor of such a desire may not in
him wax cold. Yea S. Thomas 2.2. q. 189. art. 7. proves out of the Canon law,
19. q. 2.^. Due sunt leges.
that a secular Curate may enter into Religion, although his Bishop should
exprestely be against it: Etiam contradicente Episcopo, eat liber, nostra
authoritate: Although the Bishop oppose himself, let him fr^el^e^ter your
Authority, says the Pope. Now, as M. Doctor in his 11. Chapter n. 15. proves
out of S. Thomas* S. Th 22 q. 184. a. 7.
that the state of a Bishop is a state of gre^ter perfection, then that of a
Religiou^ man, because otherwise it were not lawful for him to be made a
Bishop, because that were, retro aspicere, to look back: So we may say, that
seeing secular Pastors, may enter into Religion, it must be an argument, that
Religious state is more perfect, for the very same reason, least otherwise they
should be convinced, retro aspicere; to look back. Which reason will wax more
strong on our side, if we call to mind, that a Religious man cannot yield
consensent to his election to be a Bishop, without his own superiors leave,
whereas a secular Curate may lawfully enter into Religion, even against the
will of his Bishop. This whole resolution of Saint Thomas, is much confirmed,
by an other doctrine, delivered by him in the same 184 question art. 6. That
only Bishops, and not inferior Prelates, are in a State of perfection, whereas
in the next precedent Article, he bad purposely taught, that Religious men are
in such a State.

15 To these determinations of S. Thomas, I will a^de nothing, save only, that
Religious state is of Divine institution, as certaine^y Archdeacons, Deanes,
Vicars etc. are not: and Suarez (in the same place, Suarez to. 4. in 3. p.
disp. 25. n. 17.
which M. Doctor cited, to prove that Bishops are of Deume Ordinance) is of
opinion that the Division of Parishes, with Institution of Parish Priests,
(even in general) is not de iure diuino, of Divine iustitution, because (says
he) the Church might divide more Bishoprics, and assign to each one a less
territory, ordayning that the Bishop himself, should be immediate Pastor, in
his whole Diocese, which he might govern by Vicars, and Chaplins, which,
although were not perhaps universally expedient, yet it is not directly, and
clearly against the law of God. S. Thomas also, says of all inferior
Pastors, that in respect of the Bishop, S. Th. 2.2 q. 184. a 6. ad 2.
they are sicut Baliui ad Regem; and in his answer ad ^. he teaches, that
they have not principal care of souls, but some particular administration by
Commission from the Bishop. But howsoever this matter be, at least, it is not
so certain, that the Institution of Parish Priests is de iure Dirino, a Divine
institution, as it is, that Religious state was instituted, by our Savior
Christ.

16 And this shall suffice for the comparison of Religious men with Curats, if
their callings be considered in themselves. Which comparison is alwais to be
understood, betwixt Religious men, and such Secular Priests, as are Ordinary
Pastors, or Curats. For in England, where all Priests both Regular, and
Secular, attend to the help of souls only by particular Mission. Privilege,
and Delegation, there is no doubt but Religious men are to be preferred; seeing
both in Order, of Priesthood, and Jurisdiction, or Office they are equal, and
still the state of Religious, as Rel^gious, is more noble the^ that of Secular,
as Secular, which no Catholic can deny.

17 For the second comparison, whether Religious, or secular, are more fit to
help souls, by preaching, and other such Ecclesiastical functions, let us
hear Saint Thomas teaching, that Religious men are made more fit for the
performance of such functions of Preaching, S. Th. 2.2. q. 187. a. 1.
teaching etc. by reason of the exercise of sanctity, which they have
undertaken, adding: Stulium est dicere, quod per hoc quod aliquis in sanctitate
promouetur, efficiatur minus idoneus ad spiritualia officia exercenda. Et ideo
stult a est quorundam opinto dicentium, quod ipse status Religionis
impedimentum affert, talia exequendi: It is a foolery to say, that by being
improued in sanctity, as man is made less fit for the performance of
Ecclesiastical functions. And therefore the opinion of some, who say that the
very state of Religion, brings an impediment to such functions, is a foolish
opinion Quorum errorem (says the same Saint) Bonifactus Papa exeludit, dicens,
vt habetur 16. q. 1. Sunt nonnulls, nullo dogmate fulti, andacissime quidem,
zelo magis amaritudinis, quam dilectionis inflammati, asserentes Monachos, qui
mundo mortui sunt, and Deo vinunt, Sacerdot alis officii potenti a indignos.
Sed omnino labuntur. Quod oftendit, primo quidem, quia non so^^r ^riatur
Regulae; subdit enim: neque enim Beatus Benedictus, Monachorum Praeceptor
Almificus, huiuscemodirei aliquo modofuit interdictor. Et similiter nec in
aliis regulis hoc prohibetur. Secundo, improbat praedictum errorem, ex
ideoneitate Monachorum, cum in fine Cap^tuli subdit: Quanto quisque est
excellentior, tanto, and in illis (scilicet spiritualibus oper^bus) potentior.
Whose error Pope Boniface does reject, saying: There are some supported by no
verity, who inflammed with zeal of bitterness, rather then of charity, do most
boldly affirm, that Monks who are d^ad to the world, and live to God, are not
worthy of the power of Priestly office. But they are altogether deceived.
Which he proves. First, because it is not against the Rule: For ^e adds; S.
Bennet, the Father of Monks, did not any way in his Rule forbid it. And
likewise it is not forbid in other Rules. Secondly, he disproueth the foresaid
error, by the fitnes of Monks, for such functions, saying: By how much a man
is more excellent, by so much he is more powerful in those (spiritual
functions.) Behold the doctrine of the greatest Prelate, and one of the
greatest Scholars, upon earth; a Pope, and a most learned Saint. To those
vulgar objections ( Vita Monachorum etc. The life of Monks signifies
subjection, not an office of teaching, or governing others: Monachus non
Doctoris etc. The profession of a Morke is not teaching, but weeping, and the
like) S. Thomas in the same place ad 3. answers; that such sayings only
signify, that Monks precisely by being Monks, do not acquire authority to
preach etc. but not that by being Monks, they have any thing repugnant to the
performance of such actions: And secular Priests, and Bishops, not only as
secular, but also as Priests, or Bishops have no power lawfully to perform
such actions, till it be granted them by lawful Superiors.

18 And conformable to this Doctrine, has also been the practice of Gods
Church, which thought it self best furnished, when Prelacy, and Religious
state were joined together. For, as, Baronius witnesses Negari non potest,
Baron. Ann. 328. n. 25.
fuisse Monachismu^, Seminarium in Ecclefia Dei sanctissimoru^ Episcoporum: It
cannot be denied, but that Monastical Institute, has been in the Church of
God, a Seminary of most holy Bishops. the same most famous Author in the same
place number 23. having related, how that Conqueror of the Arians, S. Athanasius,
chose Monks for Bishops of diverse Churches, gives this reason for it: Quod
for^ssimos, hos fore sciret, aduersus ingrue^tem Ary haeresim in pugnatores, et
quasi munitissimas turres contra Miletianos Schismaticos. Because he was sure,
that they (Monks) would prove stoutest, against the approaching Arian
haeresie, and as it were most strong Forts against the Miletian Schismatics.
It is therefore very strange, and full of partiality, what M. D. avouches, in
his 8. Chap. number. 12. that the titles of Patriarhes, Archbishops, Priests, and
Pastors, are not titles of Orders of Religious, as they are Religious, but
only of the secular Clergy. Does the name of Bishop, Priests etc. signify only
a secular Bishop, or Priest? I always conceived, that there had been both
Regular, and Secular Priests, till now I hear a new doctrine, that the title
of Priest, is a title of the Secular Clergy. The names of Bishop, and Priests,
are, I grant, names of the Clergy, but that they are names of the Secular
Clergy, I do not understand. If I would make comparisons, I could say that
Religious, men as Religious, although they have not so much as prima^^
tousuram, which is but a disposition to Orders, yea even before they be
Religious, and are but in their Nouiship, or way to a Religious life, yet they
enjoy the Privilege, Canonis, and Fori, as if in act they were Clergy men,
which is not granted to Secular persons as Secular: But my meaning is not to
say al, that with great truth might be spoken of a Religious state, in
comparision of the Secular Clergy; and therefore, I will go foreward to note,
what I find in M. Doctors 9. Chapter. n. 19. That the assumption of Regulars
to the Clergy is extraorainary; and n. 13. that Regulars were admitted, and
sent to preach to the Gentiles, yet that office does not appertain to them,
^ure ordinarto, by the ordinary law, but by Priniledg, and extraordinarily. I
wish M. Doctor would explicat what he means, by extraordinary, or ordinary
law. Is there any Law forbidding Religious men to be made Priests, or to
receive authority to preach, if once they be Priests? or will be say that,
Secular Priests, only by being Priests, may lawfully preach without any other
Commission? I am sure, neither he, nor any Catholic can say so. Wherein then
consists this difference of Ordinary, and extrordinary, betwixt Secular, and
Religious. It is well known that in some countries, none but Religious men can
be made Bishops, and in our cuntry, the Monks of S. Benets most holy Order,
were so much of the Clergy, that a mere comparatiue, or conditional mention
of like Right in these days, made such impression in some, that there was to
that particular framed an answer, with title of a Parallel.

19 As for conversion of Infidels, it is manifest, with how prosperous success
Religious men have, and in these our days do still employ themselves, in that
laborious good work, more then the secular Clergy. And although some misapply
the old saying; that Monks out of their Monasteries, are like fish out of the
water: yet they may be pleased to remember, that if those fishes, had never
been out of the water, English men might have been in an everlasting fire. For
such fishes are also Fishers of souls, as our Savior styled his Apostles; and
fishermen make no profession, to live only in the water. Yet Religious men
cannot but acknowledge it, for a singular benefit, that for repayring the
vigor of their souls, they may upon occasion, retire themselves to their
Religious houses, and so return to the help of others, with less danger to
themselves. Moreover that those Fishers, who converted England, were of the
very same Order of S. Bennet, Apostolatus Benedictinorum in Angli^.
which now is so much impugned, has been proved in a learned Treatise, by
better arguments then M. Doctor will easily answer, if he chance to be of a
contrary opinion.

20 And indeed, there is great reason, why Religious persons, in regard of
their state, should be fit for the conversion of souls, because by s^nctity of
life, they are more united to him, whose instruments men's endeauours are, in
that great work: and he who with profit, and security, will shine to others,
must first burn within himself. Our Savior Christ having called a certain
person to be his follower, Luc. 9^
and he demanding ^espit, only for the burying of his father, was bid, to leave
the dead, and that he should go and preach the Ghosple; Tu ^utem vade, e^
annu^tia regnum Det: whereby our Blessed Lord, gave men to understand, that a
good disposition to be an excellant preacher, is a resolute, and actual
leaving all. S. Ambrose in this point is round, ^. ^^^ros^^s. 10. in Luc.
and clear. Ille (says he) confirmare iubetu^ fratres suos, qui dixit: Omnia
reliquimus, et secuti sumus te. The charge of strengthening his brethren, is
committed to him, who said: Behold we have left all, and followed thee: Which
are the very words, from which Catholics prove the three Evangelical
Counsels, of Poverty, Chastity, and Obedience, vowed by Religious men.

21 M. Doctor in his 9. chap. n. 16. says: That Popes sent Regulars to
convert Countries, because Bishops, and Priests were busied in governing their
subjects, and so could not be spared. But this reason is insufficient. For,
besides Pastors, who have subjects to be governed, there are numbers of the
Secular clergy, free from any such charge; yea all Pastors, except such
Bishops as are married to some particular Church, may easily leave their charge,
and employ themselves upon the conversion of Infidels. And I know, M. Doctor
will not approve his own reason, when he shall find it to be so very like,
to that of Beza, cited by Bre^lay, in his lives of Luther etc. chap. 7. Non
magnop^r^ (says Beza) nobis de legatione ad vemotissimas aliquas gentes
labora^dum, cum nobis domi, et in propinquo sit satis, superque quod nos, and
posteros nostros exerceat. Has igitur potius ta^ longinquas peregrinationes,
locustis illis, lesu nome^ ementie^tibus, relinquamus. We are not much to
trouble ourselves, with missions to certain remote countries, seeing at home,
and near at hand there is enough, and more then enough to busy us, and our
posterity. Let us then leave such far pilgrimages, to those locusts, who
vsurp^ the name of Jesus. Wherefore we must of necessity, find some better
cause, why Relious men, have been so much employed in converting Infidels, then
that which was by M. Doctor alleged; which I doubt not, will be obuious to
the reader, out of the reasons, which have been given, of the great fitnes of
Religious men, to deal with souls. But it must not be expected from me, who
am resolved not to give any offense, to yield likewise a reason, why Secular
Priests, do^ not bestow themselue^ upon those ^^^ssions, as much as Regulars
do.

22 Out of what has ^ine said, the indicious Reader will of himself infe^ two
things. First that for such as intend to be made fit, to be of the Clergy,
the nearer their education comes to a Religious life, the better it will
dispose, and more enable them for their intended course, of profitably dealing
with their neighbors. Secondly in how great an error they are, who conceive,
that although it be not unlawful for Religious men, to employ themselves in
help of their neighbor, yet such functions are not so connaturall to them, as
to Secular Priests, but do, as it were, put them out of their element, and
strain their proper vocation, as if Religion, were ordamed only to perfect a
man's own soul. But the contrary is manifest, out of what has been said, in
this Question. For seeing the proper, and essential end of Religious State, is
the perfection of charity, which according to S. Thomas, consists not only in
the love of God, 8. Tho. 2 2. ^. 18 ^. a 3. (...) corp.
but also of our neighbor, it clearly follows, that when Religious men
attend to help their neighbors, either in regard of their proper Iustitute, or
by particular commission, and Mission from lawful Superiors they do a thing
most connaturall to their state, as the end of every thing, is most connaturall
to that thing in respect whereof it is the end. That the love of God, and our
neighbor, is the very end of a Religious state, ^ Tho 2.2. q. 188. a. 2. in
corp.
is a proposition by S. Thomas taught, in these express terms; Religiou^s
Status ordinatur ad perfectione^ charitatis, quae se extendit ad dilectionem
Det, et proximi. A Religious State is ordained to the prefection of Charity
which extends it self to the love of God, and of our neighbor. Wherefore the
Genericall Notion of Religious State, which tends to the perfection of charity,
finds it self, as it were, in his natural center, and at home, when it does
compass the full latitude, and perfection of Charity, by being contracted by a
Difference, or a Particular state, employed in perfitting both our selves, and
others: and the con^ary persuasion, cannot, I must needs say, be interta^^ed by
any man, well grounded in D^uinity, or who rightly understands the nature, of a
Religious state of perfection, for it were in effect to say, that it is not
connaturall for Charity, to love both God, and our neighbor, or for the,
Beauficall vision, in God to represent created objects. No, No: Mary, and
Martha, Contemplation and Action are two; yet sisters: diverse; but not
disagreing: noe more then the love of God, does hinder the loving of our
neighbor. S. Th. 2.2. q. 188.^.2. in corp S. Greg. Naz. ^at. 20.
For, as S. Thomas teaches, Contemplation belongs to the love of God, and
Action to the love of our neighbor. And therefore S. Gregory Nazianzen mentions
it as a singular commendation of Saint Basil, that he conjoined the Active, and
Contemplative life; vt quemadmodum terra and mare, ita etiam hae duae vita
commoda sua inter se communicantes, ad vnicam Des gloriam concurrerent. That as
the Sea and Land do, so these two kinds of life, communicating with one
another their several commodites, might both concur to the only glory of
God. S. Th 2.2. q. 188. artis. ^.3.4.
S. Thomas having taught that a Religion may be instituted for the works of an
Active life, and also for a holy warfar; thence makes a most reasonable
inference, that it is, Conuenientissimum, Most convenient, that a Religion be
instituted to preach, and exercise the like spiritual functions: which the
Religious of ^he sacred Order of S. Domiusck, who have their very name from
Preaching, have, and do still most happily perform, to the unspeakable good
of souls. If then, it be most convenient, that Religious men should preach,
hear confessions, and the like; certainly it is very co^naturall to their
vocation so to do. And out of this discourse may be taken a clear and weighty
reason, in confirmation of all, that has been said, of the great fitnes of
Religious men, to deal with souls. For in what proportion, a Religious state
is more fit to attain the perfection of Charity, then a secular vocation, in
the same degree, it makes a Religious man more fit, to help his neighbor,
then secular as secular are, because, as has been said, charity extends it
self also to our neighbor. I might add, that in Gods Church, there want not
many, who either are about election of a Religious state, or else desire in the
world, to imitate the practice of Religious men, by contemplation, and such
like means of union with almighty God: and to the direction of those well
minded persons, noe doubt but experience of such exercises, gotten in Religion,
does much conduce. And this shall s^ffice concerning the comparison of
Religious men with secular Pastors or Prelates, wherein all that has been
said is to be understood only of the States, and Vocations in themselves, not
of the Persons, whose merits, are known only to him, Act. 1.
Qui cord a nouit omnium; Who knows the hearts of all men. It remains that I
explicate a point, or two, handled by M. Doctor obscurely, and with
disadvantage to Religious state.

23 The first is: That perfection co^sists in Charity, and that the three
Evangelical Counsels are noe perfection, but instruments, and means to
atraine perfection: by which manner of speech, so indistinctly proposed, the
reacer may be apt to value the Luargelicall Counsels, much under their true
worth. And therefore to clear the matter: We must observe, that the said
Counsels may be considered either as of themselves they are apt to remove
impediments of Charity, and love of God, for example, Poverty, and Chastity
even of their own nature, do necessarily free a man from the dangers,
temptations, and impediments of the love of God, which arise our of the actual
possession of riches, and enjoying the pleasures of sensual delights, and in
this sen se they may be termed, but means, or instruments to get perfection:
or else they may be considered, as proceeding from particular virtues of
Religion, Temperance etc: and in this consideration, they are not only bare
means, or instruments. but also effects, properties, compamons, perfections,
and causes of Charity, which alone makes not a man wholly perfect as the essence
of a man without properties, and accidents is but imperfect. And therefore S.
Thomas 2.2. q. 184. a. 3. in corp. says that: Secundario et instrumentaliter
perfectio co^sistit in Consili^s; secondarily, and instrumentally Perfection
does consist in the Counsels, which is a thing much different from only
instrumentally, as in the same place he says, that the perfection of Christian
life consists in charity, prin^ipaliter quidem secu^dum dilectionem Dei.
secundario autem secundum dilectionem proximi; Principally in the love of God,
and secondarily in the love of our neighbor: in which words, we see that
secondarily, and only instrumentally, are terms much different, for who will
say, that the love of our neighbor is only an instrument of christian
perfection? It being indeed an act of charity, or perfection, although not the
prime, but a secondary act of that virtue. And whosoever reads, the first
Article* of the same Question, will quickly find, that other virtues beside
Charity, are more then instruments, or means of perfection, which M. Doctor
could not but see, having cited the same place in his 11 chapt. number. 10. Yea S.
Thomas further teaches, S. Tho. 1. p. q. 5. a. 1. ad. 1. and q. 6. a. 3.
that a creature is not absolutely good, nor perfect, by his essence, but by
accidents, which perfect that essence; and this is particularly verified in
charity, which is the essence of perfection, because it is increased by
meritorius acts, not only of it self, but also of othervertues, whereas
natural substances, cannot be intrinsecally increased in their natures, by
their accidents, or proprieties: yea if one do embrace Poverty, Chastity, and
Obedience, merely out of love to God, without the proper motive of any
othervertue, they are formal acts of charity, and in noe sense, can be
properly termed only instruments thereof. Seeing then the Evangelical
Counselles, sealed with a vow, are acts of great, and noble virtues, it
follows, that they are not only most fit instruments to attain perfection,
which consists in charity, but also are causes, and perfections of perfection
it self, not only remoouing impediments of Charity, but also affording it
positive helps, and increase. All which will be more confirmed, by what I am now
going to say, concerning a second point of doctrine, avouched by M. Doctor,
either confusedly, or not truly.

24 In his 11. Chap. number. 12. thus he writes: There is only this difference,
betwixt Religious, and other Christians, that the Religious leave all things
actually, other Christians must leave them in preparation of mind. The former
leaving of them actually, is noe perfection, but an instrument of perfection,
unless it be joined with the love of God, in which consists perfection. By
these words the Reader may be apt to conceive, that Religious state, has no
perfection more then all other Christians, because they differ only in actual
leaving all things, which, as he says, is noe perfection. If therefore he
understand, that in the preparation of mind, common to all Christians, and
that which is proper to Religious men, there is no difference, the doctrine is
Untrue, in^urious to Religious State, and against M. Doctor himself, who in
the same place distinguishes that perfection of Charity, necessary to all
Christians, by which they are resolved not to offend God mortally, from another
perfection of Charity, by which we so love God, as we are ready, not only to
observe the commandments, but also the Counsels for his love, and this is the
Charity of Religious: Ergo, even according to M. Doctor, the difference
betwixt Religious, and other Christians, is not only in the actual leaving of
all things, but also in a precedent greater perfection of Charity, and
readiness of mind, of which the actual leaving of all things, is but an
effect: ergo, according to his own doctrine, it cannot be true, that Religious
men differ from others, only in leaving all things actually. If his meaning be,
that betwixt Religious men, and other Christians, there is difference even in
preparation of mind, and not only in actual leaving all things, then he spoke
but confusedly, when he said, that only in leaving all things actually,
Religious men differ from other Christians, who must leave all things in
preparation of mind. I therefore must crave leave, to distinguish the
preparation of mind, to leave all things, proper to Religious men, from that
other, which must be found in all Christians, if they mean to save their
souls: and I cannot do it better then out of S. Thomas, who plainly tells
us: That it is the lowest degree of Charity, S. Th. 2.2. q. 184. art. 3. ad 2.
to love nothing above, or against or equally wih God. This is the necessary
perfection of all Christians. But Religious men profess an higher degree of
perfection by abandoning, not only what is contrary to the love of God, as
utterly destroying it, but also whatsoever may be an impediment, to the very
perfection thereof; which is a difference so remarkable, that the same holy
Doctor in resp. ad 3. doubts not to compare, the perfection of Secular men,
to a child newborn, and that of Religious persons, to a man of perfect
growth. Likewise a. 8. in resp. ad 6. he teaches, that it diminishes the
perfection of virtue, when one does not love it so much, that he is resolute to
avoid the impediments thereof, according to the Apostle 1. cor. 9. Omnis qui in
agone contendit, ab omnibus se abstinet: and thence he proves, that although
secular Pastors be in a calling, wherein virtue is exercised with greater
difficulty, then in Religion; yet their vocation, is not so perfect, as a
Religious state, because the very avoiding of worldly impedime^ts, is a thing
very meritorious. And if S. Thomas speak thus of secular Pastors, we may
easily imagine, what difference he puts betwixt Religious, and all Christian
secular People. I think there is no Father, who will not make a great
difference, betwixt two Sons, of which the one cared no more, for contenting
his Father, then were precisely necessary, not to incur danger of being put
by his inheritance, but the other out of pure filial love, and respect to his
Fathers pleasure, were sollicitous, and resolute, to perform his very
propensions, and councels, although not seconded with any command, or
commination of punishment. This is the difference betwixt a Religious and
Secular state.

25 What M. Doctor says, that the actual leaving of all things, is no
perfection, but an instrument of perfection, must be understood, as above I
have explicated, number. 23. For, as such actual leaving of all things, proceeds
from the virtues of Temperance, Religion etc. it is not a mere instrument, of
charity, or perfection, but does meritoriously greatly increase the same: yea,
I add further, that according to the doctrine of S. Thomas, and others, S. Th.
2.2. q. 189. a ^* ad 2.
that Religious profession, like to Baptism, or Martyrdom, remits the whole
pain, due to our sins, the very external act of leaving all things, has a
particular effect, which the internal act should not have without it: To say
nothing of the Laurea, or accidental Glory, of perpetual Virginity, or of
that prerogative of Judicature, promised by our Savior to such as for his sake
leave al. Sedebitis etc. you shall sit upon twelve seats, judging the twelve
Tribes of Israel. Matthew. 1^
That also which M. Doctor says: that the actual leaving of all things is no
perfection, but an instrument of perfection, unless it be joined, with the love
of God, in which consistteh perfection; needs some explication. For if he
understand, that the actual leaving of all things, conduces not to
perfection, unless it proceed from formal acts of Charity, the doctrine is
not true, because, not only acts of the love of God, but also of other virtues,
being performed in state of grace, and with other requisite conditions, do
meritoriously increase grace, and charity. If his meaning be, that the actual
leaving of all things is but an instrument of perfection, unless it be joined
with the love of God, that is; unless a man be in state of grace, it is not
meritorious of perfection, which consists in charity; he says no more of
this leaving all, the^ he might have said, of the acts of Faith, and Hope, and
all other whatsoever good works, even acts of Charity it self, for example,
perfect contrition, of which none are meritorious of Grace, unless the doer of
them be in Gods favor: and yet it ought not to be denied, but that as other
acts of virtue, so the leaving of all things, may dispose a man for returning
to Gods grace, and in that sense, be an instrument, or means to get
perfection. Moreover, it is not clear what M. Doctor means in saying, that
the actual leaving of all things, is but an instrument of perfection, unless it
be joined with the love of God. For, when it is joined with the love of God, is
it more the^ an instrument of perfection? If it be; then perfection consists
not only in the love of God, but also in other virtues; and so Poverty,
Chastity, and Obedience, shall be more then instruments of perfection. If the
actual leaving all things, even when it is joined with the love of God, be noe
more then an instrument of perfection, and not perfection it self, what then
meant he by that exception (Unless) saying, that actual leaving all is but an
instrument of perfection, Unless it be joined with the love of God? for these
words seem to signify, that if it be joined with the love of God, it is more
then an instrument according to that Rules Exceptio firmat contrariam regulam.

26 Howesoeuer men may flatter themselves with a Preparation of mind; yet it
is not an easy thing, to possess riches for example, and not to affect, and
be possessed by them. Seneca said well Qui non facit cum potest nunquam voluit.
He who does not a thing when he may, gives to understand that he never had a
serious will to do it. If men do not love what they enjoy, why find they so
great renitency to depiiue themselves thereof? O how few keep riches,
freedom of their will, and the like, merely out of election, and judgment,
that so to do, redou^^^s to the greater glory of our Creatour^ We think our
affections are at freedom, when upon trial we find it otherwise, like a bird,
that thinks not it is in the net, till it make offer to fly; or as our soul,
and body, never feel their mutual love, till by approaching death, they are
upon their parting. That wonder of wit, and miracle of sanctity, blessed saint
Augustine, percerued not how much his affection was tied to his most religious
mothers life, till he beheld her deprived of life, and himself of her company.
Q^oniam (says he) dese^ebar tam mag^o eius solatio, 8. Aug. Cos. ^9. c. 12.
sauciabatur anima mea, and quasi dilaniabatur vita, quae vna facta erat examea
and illius. Because, I was deprived of so great a comfort, my soul was
wounded, and my life as it were torn in pieces, which till then had been
composed of hers and mine. And that which pierced his soul was, ex
consuetudine simul viuendi dulcissima and charissima repent dirupta, vulnus
recens: a green wou^d made by the sudden breaking off, of that custom, which
I had to live in her most sweet, and most dear conversation. That young man
in the Ghospel, felt not how much his heart was upon his wealth, till by our
Savior he was told of actual leaving all, although before that time in
preparation of mind he had left all, because he had keept the commandments:
vade and v^nde omnia quae habes* and da pauneribus, and veni, and sequere me,
said our blessed Savior. Matthew. 19
Go sell all thou have, and give it to the poor, and then come and follow me.
For upon those words, he fell into a fit of melancholy, and rather chose to be
rich the^ perfect, athough persuaded to such a state, by the, words of the Word
Incarnate. Let us bear S. Augustine, speaking of that same young man to this
very purpose: Nescio (says he) quomodo cum superflua and terrena diliguntur,
S. Aug. epist 34. ad Paulin. et Therasiam.
arctnis adepta, quam concupita co^string unt: Nam vnde tristis ille dis^essit,
qui consilium vitae a^ternae co^sequen^ae quaerebat a Domino, cum a^dister
vende^da esse omnia sua, si vellet esse perfectus, nisi quia maguas, vt
Euangeli^^^ loquitur, habebat diuitias? Aliud est e^^n nolle incorporare quae
^esunt, aliud ram incorporata diuellere: I^la velut cibi repudiantur, haec
velut membra praeciduntur. I know not how when superfluous and earthly things
are loved, they more straightly tie us if once they be possessed, then when
they are only desired (and much more may I say then, when they are neither
possessed, nor desired, but voluntarity contemned) for why did he, who asked
our Saviors advise, how he, might be saved, go away with a sad heart, upon
the hearing, that if he resolved to be perfect, he must sell all, but because,
as the Ghopell witnesses, he was in possession of great riches? For it is one
thing, to have a resolution, not to incorporate to us those things we have not,
and an other to tear away things already incorporated: Those we refuse as we
refuse meats; but these are cut off like parts of our body. The reason of this
daily experience is, because the passion of love, being agreeable, and
sympathising with ones natural inclination, is of great power to sway our
soul, but not so easy to be felt, and discerned, except by its effect,
namely, so^row, when we find ourselves deprived of what we loved. For sorrow
being a sour, and thornie passion, and much repugnant to our nature, is
speedily discovered. To which purpose S. Thomas in proof that in some respect,
8. Tho. 1.2. q. 35. a. 6.
men do more fly sorrow, then thirst after delight, alleges S. Augustine
saying: Amor magis sentitur, cum cum prodit indigentia. 8. Aug. 10. De^rinit.
Love is most felt, when it is discovered by want of the thing we loved:
because, as S. Thomas says, from such want proceeds sorrow. Therefore let not
men trust the presumed indifferency of their affection, if they have never
tried it by want of what they enjoy.

27 Holy men were not ignorant, that perfection chiefly consists in Charity,
and knew as well, as men in th^se days know, what preparation of mind did
signify: Nevertheless by word, writing, and example, they exhorted men to
real, and actual leaving all. And indeed there is great difference, betwixt
that young man, who, to keep his riches, refused to keep our Savior company,
and the blessed Apostles, in whose name, S. Peter could truly say; Matthew. 19.
Ecce nos reliquimus omnia: Behold w^, (not only in preparation of mind, but
actually) have left all, and followed thee. It is a case worthy to be deplored
with many tears, that in worldly, and temporal affairs, men will use their
uttermost diligence, and employ all their wits, for comp^ssing such poor ends,
with all possible security; and yet in the maine business of our soul, we are
willing to find our any seeming probabilities or speculatiue distinctions, and
all in effect to foster our already settled affections, by supposed preparation
of mind, and the like goodly gay pretexts: whereas we cannot but know, that
it is not an easy matter, to possess riches, and enjoy pleasures, upon a pure
motive of virtue, or only for the love of God, not for the riches, or
pleasures themselves; or to make sure, that our love to them be not greater
then it ought, and so make us love God either in a less degree, or with less
frequented acts, while we love other things, rather with him, then for him.

28 But, say these mental Saints, Abraham was rich, and yet a Saint: And I
say, that when they shall have but one only son, the sole hope, not only of
the Posterity of Abraham, but of all faithful believers, and yet besides a
mere preparation of mind, have their arm actually stretched out, to be his
executioner, and to offer him in sacrifice, upon Gods command; then say I,
most willing I should be, to proclaim these men also for Sa^nts, if I did not
further consider, that the case of those ancient Fathers, was much different
from ours; because in those times our Blessed Savior, had not promulgated the
three Evangelical Cou^sails, the excellency whereof was reserved for the law
of Grace. For as S. Bernard says: It was sufficient for the ancient Fathers,
to follow the Spirit of God only in spirit, but after the Word was made flesh,
and dwelled in us, S. Bern. Hom. Ecce nos reliquimus o^^^^.
in himself he gave us a pattern of perfection, to be imitated in act, and as
it were corporally, that following him with both our feet, we may noe more
like the Patriarch lacob hault in one of our thighs, namely by an imperfect
half imitation, in preparation of mind and not in act, or to use S. Bernards
words only in spirit, and not in act, and as it were corporally. Blessed S.
Hierome speaking of chastity, one of the three Evangelical Cou^sells, has
these divine words: Satim vt Filius Dei ingressus est super terram, nouam sibi
familiam insli^uit, vt qui ab angel^s adorabatur in caelis, haberet Angelos et
in terris. As Soon as the son of God came upon earth, he made ^o himself a
new family, that he who r^^s adored by Angels in heaven, should likewise have
his Angels on earth. I will conclude this point with the authority of two
Saints under one: S. Thomas cyteth out of. S. Th. 2.2. q. 186. a. 4. ad 2.
S. Augustine lib. de bon^ coniugale cap. 22. these words: Melior est castitas
coelibum, quam castitas nuptiaru^. Esse autem castus sine coniugio potuit
(Abraham) sed tunc non oportuit. The Chastity of single persons, is better the^
that of marriage, Abraham might have been chaste without marriage, but it was not
agreeable to those times. And then the Angellicall Doctor writes thus: Neither
because the Fathers in the old law, did join perfection with riches, and
m^trimony, which proceeded from heroical virtue in them, therefore weaker
persons ought to presume, that they have so great virtue, as with riches, and
matrimony, to attain to perfection: as no man adventures unarmed to set upon
his enemies because Sampson with no other weapon, the^ the ^aw bone of an ass
slew his enemies. For those ancient Fathers would have kept Poverty, and
Chastity, more carefully then we, if it had been suitable to those times. Thus
far S. Thomas: and I only add, that by this very example of Abraham, we are
taught, that the best way to know, how far our affections be engaged, is an
offer in good earnest, to be deprived, of what we possess: in so much that God
himself, after that great trial, said to Abraham: Now I know thou fear
God, Genesis ^^,
and for my sake, have not spared thy only Son. Far are they from Abraham's
love to God, who fear not to hinder their Children, from Sacrificing
themselves to their Creator, in a Religious life; therein passing the bounds
of Parents authority, while to enjoy their children a while on earth, they
seem content that both of them, for Eternity, in a lower degree enjoy God in
Heaven. For their Children to be Religious, is but of Counsel: but for them,
or any else, not to hinder so good desires, is a strict Commau^d: And the holy
Council of Trent, Conc. Trid. sess. 25. c. 18. de Regular.
does inflict Excommunication against all those: Qui sanctam Virginum, vel
aliarum mulierum voluntatem veli accipiends, vel voti emittendi, quoquo modo
sine iusta causa impedierint. Who without just cause, shall any way, hinder the
will of Virgins, or of any other women, to be veyled, or to make a Vow. And
although the Council, Excommunicate only such, as hinder women, because
ordinarily they are more subject to fear, and the like passions; yet thence we
may gather, that in like manner to auert Men, from a Religious course, cannot
be free from a great sin: especially if with it be joined, some diminution of
the perfection of Religious state in general, or else detraction, from some
Religious Order in particular, which may happen in such as are either
inexperienced, or not well affected to such a course.

29 And here I might make an end of this Question, if M. Doctor in his 9.
Chapt. number. 9. Had not touched a point, which I cannot wholly pass over
unmentioned. In that place he writes, as if he were not unwilling, the Reader
should believe, that the Apostles made no vow of poverty, and consequently were
not Religious men. My meaning is not, purposely to handle this question,
contenting my self, with saying; That it is the doctrine of the greatest
Divine, S. Thomas; S. Th. 2.2 q. 88. a. 4. ad 3. S Aug. 17. ciu. c. 4.
of the greatest Doctor of Gods Church, S. Augustine; Of one, of the greatest
authority under heaven, a Pope, namely Pius the fourth affirming, that certain
Religious me^ are of that Order, Nau. comment. 4 de Regular. n. 7. apud Suar.
Tom. 3. de R^l. lib. 3.^.3. n^m. 6.
which was instituted by the Apostles, as Nauar relates. And no man I think,
can with reason deny, that the Apostles themselnes were Religious men, if once
he grant, that they did institute a Religious Order, of Clergy men. Lastly, M.
Doctor, according to what himself writes, must yield to this verity. For in
his 11 Chap. number. 9. He says; that those words Matthew. 19. (There are Eunuchs
which have gelded themselves for the Kingdom of heaven) are most properly to
be understood, of those that vow Chastity, because such have neither the act,
nor moral, or lawful power of generation. By the same reason, I may say, when
the Apostles answered our Savior; Behold we have left all, and followed thee,
those words are most properly verified in those, who have riches neither in
act, nor power. For it is but an imperfect leaving of a thing, if it may be
retaken at ones pleasure. And if M. Doctor, out of those words (Behold we have
left all) deduce not a vow of Poverty, how will he out of the same words,
prove a vow of Chastity? because after our Savior had explicated the Counsel
of Chastity, by the name of voluntary Eunuchs, the Apostles said: Behold we
have left all, namely, both wives, and goods: and to say, the same words (We
have left all) as they signify Chastity, imply a vow, and not as they signify
Poverty, or leaving of goods, were a mere voluntary explication. And therefore
S. Augustine in the place above cited, explicated the words of the Apostles,
(Behold we have left all) of a vow of Poverty, as S. Epiphaniu^, out of those
words of our Savior (There are Eunuchs who have gelded themselves etc.)
teaches, that the Apostles had a vow of Chastity, saying; Quinam hi fuerunt,
S. Epiph. H^ref. 58.
qui se castrauerunt, propter regnum caelorum, nisi generosi Apostoli, a^
Monasticam vitam d^gentes? Who were those, who gelded themselves, for the
Kingdom of Heaven, but the generous Apostles, and such as lead a Monastical
life.

30 And it is most conformable to all reason that the Apostles, who were not
only Masters, but also paternes of of all perfection, should have all the
perfection of other Christians, not repugnant to their state, as certainly
Religious vows are not, which is clear in Regular Bishops, who still remain
true Religious men: yea, a Bishop not Regular, may with merit make a simple
vow of Poverty, because there is no Divine, or Humane law to the contrary, and
by an happy necessity, it compels him more to avoid superfluous expenses;
besides that the vow it self, as an act of Religion, is very meritorious. As
for Hospitality, Religious Bishops may keep it, noe less then other not
Religious, who are likewise bound, to employ in good uses, what is superfluous
to their state, and to more, Regular Bishops, are not obliged. It is well
known, that in England, none kept greater Hospitality, then Religious men.
Certainly, in all reason, none are more like to be liberal to others, then
who by vow are bound, not to make any thing their own. If the Apostles
observed the Evangelical Counsails, there is no reason to think, but that
they did it by vow, which of it self adds a great perfection, and as S.
Thomas says, it is a point of perfection, Opusc. 18. de perf. vi^. spirit. c.
15.
not only to perform a perfect work, but also to vow it, because both the
work, and the vow, are Counsails: And who will deny, but the Apostles were
careful, to do their works, in the most perfect manner? All this willbe much
confirmed, if we call to mind, what in this Question I alleged out of S.
Thomas: That the Counsails, of which we speak, are proper to the New Law; S.
Th. 1.2. q. 108. a. ^.
and it is no way credible that the Apostles would want a great perfection,
proper to the Law, which they themselves first promulgated to the world.

31 What he cites out of Vasquez, Vasq. 1.2. disp. 165.
that the three vows of Poverty etc. are not sufficient to make a Religious
man, unless the Church by her Decree, or Consent, admit them, and ordain that
the same vows, made before a Superior, shall make a man Religious, is nothing
against us, who for the present, only intend, that the Apostles observed the
three Evangelical Counselles, by obligation of vow, and abstain from other
particular disputes, debated among modern Deuines, as may be seen in Vasquez
cited by M. Doctor and, Vasq loc. cit. Suar. de Rel. tom. 3. l. 2. c. 4.15.16.
in Suarez at large; particularly in the places noted in the margent. Neither
is it unknown to M. Doctor, that for diverse times, there have been different
conditions required, to make one a Relious man; as also that Religious
Profession, has not always had the same effects, which now do necessarily
accompany it. Only in general, we must say, that if to be Religious men, did
well agree to the Persons, and Office of the Apostles, as I have already
proved, none knew better then they, what was requisite to place them in that
State, neither would they be careless in performing, whatsoever they knew,
necessary to that end. M. Doctor, cites also Vasquez, as affirming, that out
of the facts of the Apostles, nothing could be gathered of certainty, whereas
Vasquez, although he says the thing is not certain, yet he expressly unbraceth
the doctrine of S. Thomas, that the Apostles made a vow of Poverty, which M.
Doctor concealed, and only brought as much as seemed for his purpose. He also
cites Vasquez, in such a fashion, as one would easily think, that he proved,
the state of Bishops, not to require Poverty, because they must be Hospital,
whereas Vasquez gives no such reason. As for that which M. Doctor seems
willing to hold, that Ananias and Saphira, vowed not Poverty, Coffeteau a
Reverend, Coffeteau Discuss. cap. 12. lib. 2.
01 learned Father of the Order of glorious S. Dominicke in his book against
Marcus Antonius de Dominis, shows that it is against the whole stream of
Fathers, citing to that purpose S. Augustine, S. Fulgentius, S. Gregory, S.
Athanasius, Saint Basil, Ruffinus, Cassianus, and, (says he) almost all
besides. But truly I must needs say, M. Doctor seems propense enough, to
take hold of any occasion, Author, or Opinion, that may less exalt Religious
state: whereas indeed through the sides of Religious men the whole Clergy is
wounded. For while he tells me^ (so indistinctly as he does) that Vows, are
but instruments of perfection; that perfection consists in preparation of mind;
that actual leaning of all things is no perfection, and the like; Married
people may use the same discourse, concerning the vowed Chastity of Priests,
and so while he speaks less honorably of our two Counsails, of Poverty, and
Obedience, he much extenuateth that of Chastity, common to Religious, and all
Priests, in whom the Church is not content, with only preparation of mind,
but in so perfect a profession, requires actual Chastity, which is a sign,
that voluntary actual Chastity, is some especial perfection. Besides, this
Evangelical Counsel of Chastity, is so prized by Gods Church, that in
Concessions otherwise most ample, for changing Vows, this is always
excepted, as likewise a vow to be Religious; wherein God grant people be as
tender, as they ought, seeing unless the cause be very sufficient, all such
Dispensation is inualid, and can serve only to send a man to Hell, with a kind
of quiet conscience.

32 I will not say, the spirit, but sure I am, the style of some of this age,
is far different, from the writers of ancient days, in commendation of
Religious State: and some are wont to observe, that oftentimes, those, who
either have had greatest obligation to Religious men, or vocation, to such a
State, are the men who (to say no worse) speak most reseruedly, in
commendation of Religion, which although perhaps (for its part) may well say,
Tob. 3.
as Sara said, of her husbands; Illi forsitan me non fuerunt digni: yet on
their behalf, I wish they may in this business so proceed, that when the true
color of things shall begin to appear, by the light of an approaching future
life, they may have no just cause, to frame a different judgment, and fill
their souls with other wishes, the^ at this present they do. S. Thomas to
prove that it was convenient, to Institute Evangelical Counsels, S. The. 1.2.
(...) 4.
has this weighty syllogisine; B^ms amici consiliis anima dulcoratur (
Fr^tterb. 27.) Sed Christus maxim est sapi^ns, and amicus; ergo, eius consilia
maximam vtilitatem continent. The soul is comforted by the good counsels of a
friend (as Solomon says) But our Savior Christ is most wise, and most
friendly: Therefore his Counsels are most profitable. If it be so hearty a
comfort, to hear the good, and wholesome Counsels of a friend; Let them
consider, whether they may with ground look for so sweet a cordial, who
reject the Counsels not of a mortal man, but of God and man; not in some
particular business, but for the whole course of their life. One thing, such
men must give me leave not to conceal, because I hold it for a certain truth,
and it concerns them to know so much: That one of the greatest punishments,
which God can inflict, upon such as have neglected his vocation to a Religious
State, is to permit them to run a course in opposition against Religious men:
who, (if they be careful to answer to their vocation) may in all occasions,
find comfort enough, in what they have so often heard alleged, out of that
good Religious man, S. Bernard: S. Bern. Ha^. Sur. est ^eg^um Calor. hum. que^.
bonas Marg.
Quae est ista tam pretiosa Margarita, pro qua vuinersa dare debemus, id est,
n^smetipsos (quia totum Deo dedit, qui seipsum obtulit) ve possimus eam habere?
Nonne haec est Religio sancta? in qua homo viuit purius, cadit rarius, surgit
velocius, incedit cautius, irroratur frequentius, moritur considentius,
remuneratur copiosius. What is that so precious aiewell, for which we ought to
give all, that is, our selves (because he gives all to God, who makes an
oblation of himself) for the obtaining of it? Is it not holy Religious State?
wherein a man lives more purely, falls more rarely, rises more speedily, walks
more circumspectly, receives divine influence more frequently, dies more
confidently, and is rewarded more abundantly.

THE SIXTH QVESTION. Whether Religious, as Religious, be of the Hierarchy of
the Church.
1 NOthing is more frequent, then that some persons, who I dare say, scarcely
ever red S. Dennys, nor ever were much conversant in S. Thomas of Aquin (from
whom we have the best and almost only Treatises of the Hierarchy) will be
discoursing of the Secular Clergy, as if they only were of the
Ecclesiastical Hierarchy. And M. Doctor after his wonted manner, is here
reduplicating Religious, as Religious, but never Secular, as Secular, as he
ought to have done, if he would make the comparison aright. But that had been
against his design, for in such a comparison, it would instantly have
appeared, that Religious would have had the better, who, if moreover they be
Priests, or Bishops, in those respects are equal to Secular Priests, or
Bishops, and at least as much of the Hierarchy as they: which were enough for
my purpose. Nevertheless, I will endeavor also to show, that Religious, even
as Religious, according to S. Dennys, and S. Thomas, cannot be excluded from
the Hierarchy of the Church: and so Religious Priests, Pastors, and Bishops,
shall be in more respects, of the Ecclesiastical Hierarchy, then Secular
Priests, Pastors, and Bishops, namely, not only as Priests, or Bishops, but
also as they are Religious.

2 I grant, if we limit the name of Hierarchy to Bishops, Priests, Deacons
etc. then to say, that Religious not Priests, or Bishops, are not of the
Hierarchy, is noe more the^ to say, that Religious not Priests, or Bishops,
are noe Priests, or Bishops, which surely is noe great mystery. But it should
be proved, with what ground the name of Hierarchy should be so limited. The
holy Council of Trent defines against some modern heretics, Sess. 23. can.
6.
who would take away all Order, and distinction of Degrees, in Gods Church;
That there is a Hierarchy, and distinction consisting of Bishops, Priests, and
other Ministers. But it were temerity, to affirm that the Council intended to
d^^^^e as a matter of Faith, that under the name of Hierarchy, could be
comprehended, only Bishops, Priests, or other Ministers, endued with Order, and
Jurisdiction

3 And first of all, it cannot be demed, but that the name of Hierarchy has a
latitude. For, if it has not; I demand whether it signifies only Order, or
only Jurisdiction. If only Order; then Bishops, Archbishops. Primates, and
Patriarchs, clected, and confirmed, and consequently endued with full
Jurisdiction of Ordinaries, shall not be of the Hierarchy, till they be
consecrated: and so the Supreme Head of the whole Hierarchy, a Pope elected,
shall not so much as be of the same Hierarchy, which, I suppose, M. Doctor
will not grant. If the word Hierarchy, signify only Jurisdiction, then
Priests, Bishops, Deacons etc. shall not be of he Hierarchy; till they be made
Pastors, and receive power of Jurisdiction, which likewise is against M.
Doctor, chap. 8. n. 2. Therefore I infer that the word Hierarchy, has a
latitude, and signifies distinction, both in Order, and in Jurisdiction.

4 Moreover, I demand, whether the name of Hierarchy, must signify only such
Order, Jurisdiction, Office, or Ministry, as have their Institution
immediately from Christ: or else that to make one of the Hierarchy, it is
sufficient they be instituted by the Church. If none be comprehended, but such
as are instituted by Christ, then it will remain doubtful, whether such as
have only lesser Orders, as Ostiarij, Lectours, Exorcists, and Acolythes be of
the Hierarchy; because diverse Deuines hold, that those Orders were instituted
only by the Church: and Patriarchs, Primates, Archbishops, Deanes, Vicar
Generals, Archdeacons etc. shall certainly be excluded from the Hierarchy,
because, as such, they are not of D^uine Institution: yea, parish Priest,
(abstracting from their Orders) may doubt, whether they be of the Hierarchy,
because it is not certain, that their Institution is Divine. If to make one of
the Hierarchy, Divine Institution be not requi^ed, it is a sign, that it has
a great latitude, and that it may comprehend Religious Superiors, whose
particular Iuris^ictions, and Offices, are not immediately from the divine
Institution, as neither Archbishops, Patriarchs, Primates, Archdeacons, Vicars
etc. are, although the Institution of Bishops in general, be from our Sau^our
Christ, who likewise instituted Re^^^^^^s state in general: So as Religious
S^^^^^^ ours, must be of the Hierarchy, (...) we will also exclude
Archbis^^ps, P^^^archs etc. who ne no man ^oth (...) exclude: yea seeing
Superio^^s to (...) ous Orders, are properly Ora^^^^ (...) Pastors of their
sub^ects, i^ that t^ (...) of ordinary Jurisdiction, and as (...) Pastourship,
they are more of the Hierarchy, then a Bishop only Dele^^te in ^espect of that
place, for which (...) then Delegate. Mo^eo^er, those R^l^g^o^^ Superiors who
by their Office are immovable, and perpetual, (whereby they are properly in a
State) and are obliged to govern, illuminate, and perfect others (which are
acts of perfection) are truly in a State of Perfection both to be acquired, and
already acquired, and (in that respect) are in some particular manner, and
degree, of the Ecclesiastical Hierarchy, more than Secular Bishops, even
Ordinaries, although no doubt in other respects Bishops do far excel them.

5 That Religious Superiors as such, be of the Ecclesiastical Hierarchy, S.
Bernard (cited by M. Doctor chap. 1. n. 17. to another purpose) does expressly
teach, while together which Primates, Patriarchs, Archbishops, Bishops, and
Priests, he puts Abbots in Hierarchy of the Church, saying, as that there (in
heaven) the ^er^ph^^s, and Cherubins, Caeteri quoqu^ ^s^ue ad ^^^gelos, (...).
ca^. 4.
and Archangelos, and all the rest, even to the Angels, and Archangels (which
M. Doctor translates, all the rest of the Angels, and Archangels as if
Seraphins, and Cherubins were Angels, and Archangels strictly understood, and
as they are of distinct orders, as S. Bernard here takes them) are ordered
under one head, God; so here also upon earth, under one chief Bishop,
Primates, or Patriarchs, Archbishops, Bishops, Priests, or Abbots, and the
rest in the same manner. Behold, according to S. Bernard, Abbots, as distinct
from Bishops, and Priests, belong to the Ecclesiastical Hierarchy: yea, he
gives the true reason thereof; namely, because all are ordered under one
chief^ Bishop, Christ's Vicar. And here, I have reason, to complain of M.
Doctors dealing in the said place, for alleging S. Bernard, as if he said,
that the Hierarchy of the Church is perturbed, when Abbots are subtracted from
the Bishops Jurisdiction; whereas S. Bernard, in the very same place which M.
Doctor cites, does in express words, approve the exemption of Abbots from
Bishops, and only disliketh exemption procured out of a spirit of disobedience,
pride, and Ambition. His words are: Nonnulla tamen Monasteria, sita in diuersis
Episcopatibus, quod specialius pertinuerint, ab ipsa sua fundatione, ad Sede^
Apostolicam pro volunt are fundatorum, quis nesciat? sed aliud est quod
largitur deuotio, aliud quod molitur ambitio impatiens subicetionis:
Nevertheless who can be ignorant, that some Monasteries, seated i^ diverse
Bishoprics, have from their very foundation, particulary belonged to the Sea
Apostolic, according to the will of the founders? But it is one thing what
devotion bestows, and another, what ambition, not brooking subjection, does
atempt. But does M. Doctor indeed think, that Pope^ perturbe the Hierarchy
of the Church, by exempting Religious men, from the Jurisdiction of Bishops? or
would he father on S. Bernard a thing, which neither himself, nor any good
Catholic will auow? Mauclerus also, whom M. Doctor in his 10. chapter. n. 23.
styles a learned Doctor of Sorbon, Mancler. de Monarchia 1. partis l. 5. cap.
5.
compares Superiors in Religion, to the Principalities; Secular Pastors,
inferiors to Bishops, to Archangels; and Priests, not Curates, to Angeles: So
that this learned Divine, not only places Religious Superiors in the
Ecclesiastical Hierarchy, but also prefers the^ before Secular Pastors,
and other Priests not Pastors; as in the Celestial Hierarchy, Principalities
are an Order above Archangels, and Angels. But let us now out of S. Deunys, and
S. Thomas, prove that Religious, as Religious, be of the Hierarchy. This I
will do, in that manner which M. Doctor, ought to have used, by giving the
Definition of a Hierarchy, and by that to have comprehended, or excluded
Religious, or other persons whatsoever.

6 S. Dennys, de Eccles. Hierarch. cap. 1. defines a Hierarchy in this manner.
Qui Hierarchiam dixit, omnium simul sacrorum Ordinum dixit dispositionem. He
that names a Hierarchy, names the disposition, or due ranking of all sacred
Orders. What words are here, to exclude Religious men? I am sure M. Doctor
knows well, that by sacred Orders, S. Dennys is far from understanding, as
some unlearned person might imagine, Holy Orders of Priesthood, Deacon, and
Subdeacon. But by Orders, he understands Professions, Institutes, Offices,
Degrees etc. as before he had said; Hierarchia nostra dicitur, estque, ratio
complectens sacra omnia quae ad eam pertinent: Our Hierarchy, is a certain
manner, comprchending all sacred things which belong to it. Otherwise all in
lesser Orders, all Bishops, Archbishops, yea Popes, elected, but not
consecrated, should not belong to the Hierarchy. But why should I seek, a
better interpreter of S. Dennys, then S. Dennys himself? Who in his 6. chapt.
Titulo. Contemplatio; does expressly put Monks to be one of the Orders in the
Ecclesiastical Hierarchy: and a little after the beginning of the same
Chapter, he plainly says, Summus little omnium qui initiantur, and
perficiuntur, Ordo est sanctorum Monachorum. The highest of those, who are
initiated, and perfected, is the Order of holy Monks. Before you heard him
saying, that, a Hierarchy was the disposition of holy Orders, and now, almost
word for word, he says that Religion is, Ordo sanctorum monachoru^: The Order
of holy Monks; and adds, that this Order inde^uoureth to express the State
of the perfecting Order of Bishops, with many other Encomiums of Religious
Order, inculcating again, that it is not Medij, eorum qui initiantur, Ordinis,
sed summi omnium: That it is not of the middle Order, of these that are
initiated, but of the chief of all. What could S. Dennys have written more,
for declaration that Religious are of the Hierarchy? And not only that they are
of the Hierarchy, but that they are of it in a high Degree.

7 Out of S. Thomas it will be no less easy to prove; That Religious men, are
of the Hierarchy. He therefore 1. p. q. 108. art. 1. in corp. says thus:
Hierarchia est sacer principatus. In nomine autem principatus duo
intelliguntur: scilicet ipse Princeps, and multitudo ordinata sub principe. A
Hierarchy is a holy Principality. By which name of Principality, two things are
understood, namely the Prince himself, and a multitude ordered under the
Prince. Are not, I pray you, Religious men, a multitude ordered under one
Prince, the Vicar of Christ, and S. Peter's successor? And if we will put force
in the word Ordered, what multitude is more Ordered, the^ that of Religious
me^, which has his very name from Order? In his second Article, he demands,
Whether in one Hierarchy, there be more Orders (of Angels.) And he answers,
that there are. Because it should not be an ordered, but a confused multitude,
if in it there were not diverse orders. Which diversity of Orders, is considered
according to diverse offices, and acts, as in one City there are diverse orders,
according to diverse actions: for their is one order of Judges; another of
fighting men; another of such as tille the ground. Mark how S. Thomas does
hold, that diverse functions, and Acts, are sufficient for the distinction of
Hierachies, although they do not always presuppose Jurisdiction: And as
temporal functions, not implying Jurisdiction, may make one of a Civil
Commonwealth, so in the same manner spiritual Acts, professions, or functions,
are sufficient to place one in the Ecclesiastical Hierarchy. This is also
clear out of S. Paul, in those very Texts, placed by M. Doctor in the
Frontispice of his Book, for proof of diverse Hierachicall Orders in the
Church. Are all Apostles? are all Prophets? are all Doctors? have all the
gift of Curing? Do all speak with Tongues? Do all Interpret? 1. Cor. 12. v.
28. Likewise; And he gave some Apostles, and some Prophets, and some other
Evangelists, and other some Pastors, and Doctors, to the consummation of the
Saints, unto the work of the Ministry. Ephesians. 4. v. 2. In which testimonies
there are placed functions, ministeries, and acts, which import neither Order,
nor Jurisdiction, as Prophets, Evangelists, Doctors, Working of Miracles,
gift of Tongues etc.

8 S. Thomas goes forward, saying; In Cities there is a threefold Order: Some
are the highest, as the Chief men: Some of the lowest rank, as the vulgar
people: Some are of the middle sort; as Persons of better rank; and so in every
Angelical Hierarchy, Orders are distinguished. Out of which words, we may
gather this ground; That all persons coipso, that they are parts of a
Community, do belong to some Order thereof, according as the community it self
is governed, by way of Democratie, Aristrocratie, or of a Monarchy; and so if
it be a Monarchy, as the Church of Christ is, all persons that are parts of it,
must like wise be of some Order. and rank in such a Monarchy (for in Gods
Church there is no confusion) yet so, as every one have a greater, or less
eminent place, according to the perfection of his calling, and Profession, as
we see S. Thomas places the common people in the lowest Order in a City, and
S. Dennys c. 6. places in the Ecclesiastical Hierarchy, Penitents, in infimo
loco, scilicet, inter Purgandos, in the lowest place, namely, among such as
were to be purged from their sins; and no Divine will deny, that the very
lowest Angels, belong to the Celestial Hierarchy, as even now we have heard
out of S. Thomas. Now, in what degree Religious men are to be placed, in the
Monarchy of Gods Church, if themselves were to determine, they would according
to our blessed Saviors advise, most gladly sit in the lowest place; but others
who are well instructed, in the whole disposition of the Ecclesiastical
Hierarchy, I^c. 14.10.
come, and say, Amici ascendite superius. S. Greg. Nazian. orat. in laudem
Basilii.
Ascend higher. S. Gregory Nazianzen tells them, that their Order, is a very
great one in the Church; Ecclesiae pars selectior, and sapientior: The more
choice, and wiser part of the Church; and in another place, he terms them:
The Servants, and Disciples of God; Orat 1. in Julian.
the first fruits of our Lords stock; Pillars, Crowns of Faith; precious
Margarites etc. S. Hierom. ep. 17. ad Marcellam.
S. Hierom says, that the Quyre of Religious men is: Flos quidam, and
pretiosissimus lapis, inter Ecclesiastica ornamenta; A certain Flower, and
most precious stone among the ornaments of the Church. S. Bern. lib. de
Praecepto and Dispens^^.
S. Bernard, demanding why a Religious life, is called a second Baptism,
gives this answer: Arbitror ob perfectam mundi abrenunciationem, ac
singularem excellentiam vitae spiritualis, quae praeeminet vniuersis vitae
humanae generibus. Huiuscemodi conuersatio, professores and amatores suos
Angelis similes, and dissimiles facit, imo diuinam in homine reformat imaginem,
configurans nos Christo instar Baptismi, and quasi denique secundo Baptizamur,
dum per id quod mortificamus membra nostra quae sunt super terram, Christum
induimus, complantati similitudini mortis eius. I think (it is so called) by
reason of perfect renunciation of the world, and singular excellency of
spiritual life, which surpasses all other kinds of humane life. This kind of
conversation makes the Professors thereof like, and unlike to the Angels, yea
it reformes in man the image of God, configuring us to Christ like to Baptism,
and finally we receive a second Baptism, while by mortifying our members which
are upon earth, we put on Christ, being complanted to the similitude of his
death. S. Augustine, by saying, that it is not in his power worthily to commend
a Religious life, S. Aug. l. de ^orth. Eccl. cap. 31.
does by such silence highly speak in commendation thereof. Hunc Ordinem
(says he) si laud are velim, neque digne valeo, and vereor ne iudicare videar,
per seipsum tantummodo, expositum, placere non posse. If I would praise this
Order, I am not able worthily to do it, and am afraid least I should seem to
be of opinion, S. Diory^. eccles Her. cap. 6.
that of it self alone, it has not power enough to please. What S. Dennys his
esteem was, of the Order of Religious, we have already showed; and in a word,
he says, that it is Ad summam perfectionem euectus, raised to the hight of
perfection. Innumerable more praises of Religious life, I might alleadg out of
the holy Fathers, but by these already produced, the reader cannot but rest
satisfied, what place Religious men do ho^d in the Ecclessiasticall Hierarchy.
Let us return to S. Thomas.

9 In the said Question a. 8. he demandes, whether Men be assumed to the Orders
of Angels. And his resolution is: That by grace men may merit so great glory,
that they may be made equal to Angels, according to every degree of Angels,
which is as much as to say, that men are assumed to the Orders of Angels. If
Gratia consummata, Grace in his full perfection, can place Men in the same
Orders with Angels, in the Celestial Hierarchy; we have no reason to doubt,
but that, a profession, and star of life, most powerful for attaining of
perfection, in grace, and charity of this life, may suffice to place the
professors thereof, among the chiefest Orders of the Ecclesi^sticall
Hierarchy, which is framed to the similitude of that other in Heaven: yea seeing
the end of the whole Hierarchy, is the perfection of Charity; that profession
comes nearest to the very end, and scope of the whole Hierarchy, which tends
most to perfection of our souls, consisting in Charity, and love of God,
without which, it imports nothing to be, or not to be of the Hierarchy. And
therefore S. Paul after he had set down the Hierarchy of the Church, S. Paul.
1. Cor. 12.
wherein he says, God has placed, Apostles, Doctors etc. concludes:
Aemulamini aute^ charismatameliora, let your chief endeavor be, to attain
Charity, and other virtues.

10 What we have labored, in proouing that Religious, as such, truly, and
properly are of the Hierarchy, has not been, so much in regard of ourselves,
as out of Duty, and Gratitude to those Pillars of Gods Church, those
Counselours, and sole Electours of Christ's Vicar, those whose sacred Roabes,
signify their ardent charity, and ready minds, freely to Sacrifice their life,
for the good of the universal Church, I mean, the most Illustrious Cardinals,
of the holy Roman Church, whosoever care, protecton, and sage advice, next under
God, and our Supreme Pastor, the Pope, have kept our Church of England in a
flourishing state, maugre all heat of a long continued persecution. For, if we
restrain the Notion of a Hierarchy, only to such as are endued with Order, or
Jurisdiction, those Peers of Gods Church, must be excluded from the Churches
Hierarchy, noe less then Religious men: Because the name of Cardinals, as
Cardinals, that is, as they are Counselors, and Electours of the Pope,
signifies neither Jurisdiction, nor Order, although accidentally as Priests, or
Bishops, they may have both, as likewise Religious men may have. And although a
Cardinal has power in his Church, and title, yet says M. Doctor Chap. 10.
n. 19. out of Belarmine, it is but like to the Jurisdiction, of a Parish Priest
in his Parish; besides that such a power, is also of it self separable from
the dignity of Cardinal, as Cardinal, whose charge is the universal good, of
the whole Church. But according to the grounds we have laid, out of S. Dennys,
S. Thomas, and reason itself, to prove that Religious are of the Hierarchy, it
is evident, that the most Illustrious Cardinals, as Cardinals, are not only of
the Hierarchy, but have a most aminent place therein.

THE SEVENTH QVESTION Whether by the precedent Questions, we have sufficiently
answered M. Doctors Treatise, for such points as either deserved confutation,
or required explication.
1. I must ingenuously confess that I have not labored to examine all, that
might have been discussed in M. Doctors Treatise. But whether I have
sufficiently answered the points, by me handled, must in reason be left to the
intelligent and impartial Readers judgment: whom I entreat to consider,
whether I had not just cause in my first Question, to say, that the Reasons,
and Authorities, by M. Doctor produced, for the most part prove against
himself. Wherfo^e, in this Question, for the Readers ease, I will run over,
all the Chapters of M. Doctors Treatise; A survey of M. Doctors
and when any difficulty occurreth, point in what Question of mine, he may
meet with the answer.

2 His Epistle in words exhorts to Charity, Epistle.
but how much in deeds he has by writing this Book prejudiced Charity, the
Reader will find in my first Question. What he says n. 12. that Secular
Priests, are by the divine Institution governors of the Church I have showed
to be a saying, without all ground, Question. 5. The Church must be governed by
the Clergy I grant, but I never heard that it must be governed by the Secular
Clergy. May not Bishops, and other Pastors, in Gods Church, be Religious men?
How then is it the Divine Institution, that the Church must be governed by the
Secular Clergy? In the same Number M. Doctor says, the Seculars must honor
the Regulars as helps, S. Paul uses the word Opitulations. 1. Cor. 12. v 28.
But he must give us leave to hold, that in England, Regulars are no more
ordained to help Secular Priests, then they to help Regulars: because all are
Missionary Priests, equally sent by the Vicar of Christ, for the conversion of
souls. The literal sense of S. Paul, according to good Interpreters, is that
by Opitulations, or Helps, are understood those, who help others, by
exercising the works of mercy, toward the sick, poor, distressed persons, S.
Th 2.2. q. 184. a. 6. ad 2.
Pilgrims etc. S. Thomas, applies the word (Opitulations) to Archdeacons in
respect of the Bishop. His saying n. 17 That without a Bishop English Catholics
are a stock without a Pastor; a spiritual Kingdom without, a spiritual King
etc. (which similitudes, through his whole Treatise, he often, and tediously
repeates) is disprooued Quest. 2. where also is confuted that other Assertion
of his n. 18. That without a Bishop we can be no particular Chruch, and his
proof out of S. Cyprian, affirming, that the Church is the people united to
the Bishop etc. is clearly answered. All that he has in the same number,
concerning the necessity of Confirmation ( without which, he says, we are not
perfect Christians) and the fall of Nouatus, is answered, Quest. 4.

3 For his first seven Chapters; as I embrace the Doctrine; His first seven
Chapters in general.
so I cannot but be sorry, that Articles of Faith, and Divine verities, are no
better employed, then to usher a few Chapters, written upon Humane design.
Chapter. 4.
In his fourth Chapter. n. 2. he writes: That an Ordinary must have others to
succeed him in the same authority, without any especial new Grant, and that
in this consists the difference betwixt an Ordinary, and a Delegate. Out of
these words, it most evidently follows, that my Lord of Chalcedon is no
Ordinary, because he has no successor in his Authority, without an especial
new Grant.

4 To prove that a Bishop is of an higher rank in the Church, Chapter. 6.
then a Priest, n. 4. he alleges S. Ambrose in 1. Tim. 3. But I wish, he had
brought a better proof, for so true, and certain a Doctrine. For it is much
doubted, whether those Commentaries upon S. Paul's Epistles, be indeed S.
Ambrose his work. Pet. Aroud. lib. 2.6.15.
Petrus Arcudius writes, that the Author of the commentaries upon the
Epistles of S. Paul, affirms, Ecclesiastical functions, to have been
promiscuously performed in the primitive Church, so that the Priest did the
Office of the Bishop, and the Deacon that of a Priest, and in particular, that
the Priests of Egypt even in those times did Confirm in absence of Bishops.
How does M. Doctor like this doctrine about Confirmation? In this same Chapter
n. 7. M. Doctor, says that the ancient Fathers relying on scriptures, have
ever taught that the Sacrament of Confirmation is to be ministered only by the
Bishop, which has also ever been the practice of the Church. But concerning
the Minister of Confirmation, I refer the Reader to my Quest. 4.

5 Here, number. 14. He teaches, Chapter. 7.
that Catholics ought to co^tribute maintenance to my Lord of Chalcedon. This
point touches lay Catholics, nor will I further meddle with it then to say,
that M. Doctors arguments prove only of an Ordinary as Scriptures, and
Fathers commonly speak of Bishops. And accordingly S. Thomas says: Plebs
fidelis non tenetur, S. The. 2.2. q. 188. a. 4. ad 5.
ex debito Iuris, ad sumptus ministrandos, nisi Ordinarijs Praelatis: Faithful
people are not bound, in Justice, to provide for the expenses of others, beside
Ordinary Prelates. I know some do further say: That (except for the Sacrament
of Confirmation, which yet has not been administered to many, and which also
may be committed to a Priest) they find not what greater benefit, Lay
Catholics have reaped by my Lord Bishop, then they may receive from Secular,
and Regular Priests: That rather since my Lords coming, some inconveniences
have happened, which they will not easily be persuaded, they are bound to buy
with money: That they cannot take much comfort to spare from their own
necessities (arising from daily pressures) for the maintenance of Agents, in
diverse places, which they conceive may help, to make that weed grow faster,
which all should wish were wholly rooted out: That this point, of exacting
maintenance, should have been particularly made known to his Holiness, when
the sending a Bishop to England was treated: And finally, That all concur in
desire; that what they bestow may be given propriomotu, freely, and not
importuned by the negotiation, or solicitation of other men. These things, I
say, and the like are spoken; but truly I have no mind, to intermeddle in such
matters, nor would I for a world divert the charity of any man, from my Lord of
Chalcedon, or any other Secular, or Regular Priest. Rather, I wish, all would
excite themselves, wish that noble saying, Chrysostom. ^om. vlt. in ^atth.
of S. John Chrysostom; That he is more honored by almighty God, who has
received ability to help the poor, then if he had received the power, to
uphold the Heavens if they were ready to fall. What happiness then, O what an
incomparable happiness is it, to have the occasion, power, and will, to
maintain those good servants of God, without whose continued labors, the
Heaven of mankind, true Religion, could not but fall in England?

6 In this Chapter he treats; Chapter. 8
Who in particular belong to the Hierarchy of the Church. Which point I have
handled Quest. 6. and proved that Religious, as Religious, have a very
principal place in the Ecclesiastical Hierarchy. His example, of S. Francis
Xauiers respect to Bishops, proves nothing, but where there are Ordinaries;
and certain it is, whatsoever submission he yielded, even to Ordinaries, it
was of Humility, not of Obligation, himself being the Popes Legate, and above
Ordinaries, to whom he could not in conscience subject himself, if it had
been claimed as due, as likewise Religious men, cannot lawfully renounce
Privileges, granted by the Sea Apostolic. His saying n. 10. that the tytles
of Patriarchs, Archbishops, Priests, and Pastors, are tytles only of the
Secular Clergy, is rejected Quest. 5. and showed to be full of partiality.

7 Number. 13. Chapter. ^
He cites the Council of Trent Sess. 24. cap. 4. for bidding Regulars to
preach, even in the Churches of their own Orders against the will of the
Bishop. But why does he not cite the Council entirely? The words of the
Council are: Nullus autem Secularis, sieve Regularis etc. Let no Secular, or
Regular, enen in Churches of their own Order, presume to preach against the
Bishops will. Here is no more against Regulars, then Seculars: yea Regulars
need no leave of the Bishop, for preaching in their own Churches: Only they
must not do it, if he absolutely contradict them; which are two things much
different. But Secular Priests, must have leave to preach in what place soever,
unless they be Curates, and so may do it by their Office, which also Religious
may, if likewise they be Curates. Moreover, the Counsel speaks only where
there are Ordinaries: and according to the Council, no Bishop can preach out of
that Diocese, of which he has his Title, without particular Privilege; as
also Religious men may do, if to that end they be privileged. Number. 15. He
cites certain sayings, as that, the Office of a Monk is not teaching but
weeping etc. which out of S. Thomas I have answered Quest. 5. where likewise is
confuted the reason he gives n. 16. why Regulars came to have care of the
Church; and his saying, that their assumption to the Clergy was extraordinary.
Number. 18. he writeh thus: some may object, that some Religions Orders are
instituted to preach, and to convert Nations. Ergo, to these at least it
appertains as well, as to the secular Clergy to do these functions. I
answer: that these Orders are indeed instituted to that purpose, but yet to
help only, and assist the Clergy; and to this they were not ordained by the
divine law, as Bishops, and Priests are, but by the Churches Institution. To
this answer of M. Doctor, I answer, that, as I sad above, in England
Regulars, are no more ordained to help Secular Priests, then Secular, to help
Regulars, but both a like are sent, endued with Privileges to be helpers of
souls; and Superious of Regulars, have as much authority to send their
subjects, as Presidents, or Rectours of Seminaries to send Secular Priests. And
because M. Doctor, in the objection speaks particularly, of converting
Nations, where it is clear there is no division of Parishes, or Diocesses, or
institution of Parish Priests, and the like: I understand not, how he can
imagine that in such a work, Regulars are only to help the Secular Priests:
yea, according to my Lord Philip Rouenius (as I related in my 5. Question)
Regulars are more sit for that employment then Seculars. What he says, that
such Religious, were not by the divine law ordained to preach, as Bishops, and
Priests are, has been answered in the same 5. Question, where I showed, that
neither Secular, nor Regular Priests, ca^n preach without authority, and that
Religious be as capable of such authority, and Office as Seculars: So as (if he
compare a right Secular with Religious) he will in this find no difference. And
I may add, that Regular Priests, of such orders as M. Doctor mentioned in the
objection, have a particular kind of right, or, as I may say, dispositionem
proximam, to such functions, which secular Priests, precisely by being Priests,
have not. For although Regular Priests of such Orders, have no actual
Jurisdiction, or authority for the exercise of such Actions, till they receive
it from their Superiors; yet by their Institute, they have a kind of right, to
have such authority granted by their Superiors, who without just cause, ought
not to debar them of that, to which they have obliged themselves, by
undertaking that particular course of Religious life. But Secular Priests have
no obligation to such functions, unless they be made Pastors, and take care
of souls, which thousands never do, nor have any obligation, to undertake such
a charge. Of the Apostles vow of poverty, whereof n. 19. he takes a needless
occasion to treat by reason of an objection which himself makes, I have
spoken something in my 5. Question; and wish that some, more able, would do it
more at large. In the end of the same number, he says, that although we
suppose the Apostles had been Religious men, yet Christ gave them not power to
preach etc. as they were Religious, but as they were Bishops, and Priests; and
so in this, not the Regulars, but the Seculars; to wit Bishops, and Priests, do
succeed the Apostles. A strange speech! Because Bishops succeed the Apostles,
therefore not the Regulars, but the Seculars succeed the Apostles: as if the
name of Bishop, necessarily implied to be a Secular; or as if Religious
Bishops, because they are not Secular, cannot succeed the Apostles in the
office of preaching etc.

7 In his 10. Chap. 10.
Chapter. he treats of the Dignity of Cardinals, whom we Quest. 6. have
showed to be in a most eminent place, of the Ecclesiastical Hierarchy, even
abstracting from all Power of Order, or Jurisdiction.

8 Here he treats of the state of Religious men, Chap. 11.
and to this his Chapter answers our 5. Question. Number. 10. To prove, that by
love two frindes are one soul, he aleadgeth S. Augustine lib. 4. Confess cap.
6. saying, He thought himself half dead, when his other half, Nebridius was
dead. But every woman, that reads S. Augustines Confessions, translated into
English, will see, that M. doctor in this is much mistaken. For, that friend,
whose death S. Augustine, in that place mentions, died before the Saints own
conversion, as is clear out of the 4. chap. of the 4. book by M. Doctor
cited, whereas Nebridius was converted after S. Augustine; as may be seen lib.
9. chap. 3. That friend, died before S. Augustine went out of Afric;
Nebridius was with him in Italy. And although this error be not, for the
matter, of much importance, yet it shows, how little exact M. Doctor is, in
looking upon his Authors. In the 15 number, he says: Some infer that the
Bishops marriage with his Church, is fi^mer and more indissoluble, then is
marriage betwixt man and wif^, which is contracted, but not consummated: because
Matrimony conctracted only, is dissolved by entrance into Religion, but the
marriage betwixt a Bishop and his Church, cannot so be disso^ued. But M Doctor
might hence have rather inferred, the excellency of Religious Profession, which
dissolueth Matrimony, only contracted, which Episcopal Dignity does not
dissolve. For certain it is, that the Bond of Marriage, is more strict, then
the conctract of a Bishop, with his Church; that being certainly of the Divine
law; this, at least probably, being only of the Churches Ordinance. Daily we
see Bishops, leave their Bishoprics, by renounciation, translation to some
other Bishopric, etc. But men cannot so leave, or change their wives, because
the bond of marriage is more indissoluble. If a Bishop elected, and confirmed
(not in holy Orders) do marry, it is valid, and the former contract with his
Church is dissolved; But if he were first married, and afterward should take a
Bishopric, the first bond, as I said, still remains: All which are manifest
arguments, that the contract of Matrimony, is stronger, then that of the Bishop
with his Church. Wherefore the opinion of those ^uthors by M. Doctor not named,
must ^ot (if we will have it pass for good) be ^nderstood absolutely, as he
seems to al^^adge them, but in some one particular respect, namely, that a
Bishop cannot enter into Religion without particular leave, as married persons
may after Matrimony only contracted. I say, particular leave; for if we examine
the matter well, it will be found, that the bound of Matrimony, is dissolved by
Religious Profession, only in virtue of the Churches Ordination, and as it were
by a general dispensation, thereby to testify the singular excellency of
Religious State: and so even in this point, there is not much difference,
bewixt married persons, and a Bishop, who with leave may also enter into
Religion. Number 16. he alleges out of S. Hierom: S. Hieron. Ep. ad Rust.
Monach.
Sic viue in M^nasterio, vt Clericus esse merearis: So live in thy m^^a^^e^y,
that thou may deserve to be a Clearke, to p^ooue that when a Rel^^^^us man is
made a Pastor, he is preferred to an higher calling, and to a vocation of
greater perfection. But by M. Doctors good leave, I find a man, whom I must
prefer before him, bring a far different explication of S. Hieroms words. S.
Tho. 2.2. q. 184. a. 8. ad. 4.
For S. Thomas interprets those words, as exhorting lay Religious men, so to
live, as they may deserve to be made Clearkes; and noe doubt, but Religious
men, being promoted to Orders, are in a more perfect calling, then Religious
men, who have no such Orders; and this interpretation says S. Thomas, is
apparent by the very manner of speaking used by S. Hierom. And it is worth the
noting, that S. Thomas obiecteth against himself, the said words of S. Hierom
(and answers them in the manner we have seen) in that very place, where, of
set purpose, he teaches, and proves, that Religious Priests, have a more
perfect calling, then Secular Pastors: So as M. Doctor both in the Assertion,
and in his Proof, expressly, and directly opposes S. Thomas, whom yet he
styles the Prince of Deuines. Vtri credendum? Whom shall we believe? S. Thomas,
or M. Doctor?

9 For as much as may seem doubtful in his 12. chapt. has been examined
Quest. 2. and 3. Particularly in my 2. Question, his allegation, and inference
out of S. Cyprians words, so often inculcated that the Church is Sacerdoti
plebs adunata etc. and an explication he gives, of those other words of the
same Father (Thou must know that the Bishop is in the Church, and the Church
in the Bishop) are plainly confuted, as nothing consonant to S. Cyprians
intention.

10 This 13. Chapter, the Reader will find answered (for as much as needs
explication) in my 3. Question, Chapt. 13.
where all the examples he draws from the African Church are at large
discussed. To prove, that notwithstanding whatsoever persecution, raised
particularly by occasion of Bishops, yet the Church must of necessity have
Bishops, n. 5. he writes thus: Wherefore, as we may gather out of the
Ecclesiastical histories, from the cruel Tyrant Nero, to the Clement Emperor
Constantine the Great, there was scarce any Bishop of Rome, who was not a
Martyr, or who at least suffered not great persecution. Twenty seven of them
are commonly avouched for Martyrs, to wit, Peter, Line etc. and in his margent
he has 27. Popes Martyrs before the time of Constantine. But in this account
M. Doctor is much mistaken. For, the three last Popes by him reckoned, namely,
Ioannes, Siluerius, and Martinus, were long after Constantine, who reigned the
year of our Lord three hundred and six, and two hundred forty nine years after
Nero, whose reign was fifty seven years after our Savior: whereas Ioannes
was made Pope four hundred sixty seven years after Nero, and Siluerius
thirteen years after Ioannes; and Martinus the year of our Lord six hundred
forty nine: after Nero five hundred ninety two years: so that upon the whole
account, in the first two, M. Doctor erreth more the^ two hundred twenty
years, in the space of only four hundred sixty seven; and in the last,
namely, Martinus, he erreth three hundred forty three years, in the space of
fiue-hundred ninety two, which is more then half. Besides, these last three
were made Popes in times, which did not particularly oppose the Creation of
Popes, or Bishops, for which M. Doctor produces them, but they suffered in
time of Christianity, namely, Ioannes under Justinius the elder, by the
heretical King Theodoricus^^ Siluerius by Theodora the Empress; and Martinus
under Constans the Heretical Emperor. Still M. Doctor is found not to be so
exact, as one would have expected.

11 For the answer of his 14. Chapter, Chap. 14.
the Reader may be pleased to read what I have said, quest. 2.3.4. Number. 3. He
says that England was long without a Bishop, because Superiors were informed,
that he would presently be taken, and put to death. If any reasons were
proposed to Superiors, concerning the difficulties, of having a Bishop in
England, I suppose they were other reasons, then this mentioned by M. Doctor:
But this is a business which belongs not to me. Nevertheless, M. Doct. in his
next following 15. chapter, seems to contradict, what here he says, and to
make good this very reason, which here he impugneth. For in that chapter n. 6.
he tells us, that King ^ames of famous memory, after he knew that the Bishop
was entered, and was in London, he would not command him to be apprehended, as
he might easily both in London, and any part of England, Kings having long, and
powerful arms.

12 His 15. chapter, Chapt. 15.
is to prove, that to have a Bishop in England, cannot probably increase
persecution. It were easy to show, how insufficient M. Doctors arguments are,
if it were convenient, to enter into some particulars, from which it is better
to abstain, although M. Doctor, has taken the freedom to do otherwise.
Wherefore the judicious reader, will be pleased to excuse me, from answering M.
Doctors arguments in patticular, which may be done only by distinguishing,
what indeed ought to be, and what is likely will, or rather has already
happened, by reason of the present circumstances in our country: and his
arguments, do also prove, that the whose profession, and practice of
Catholic Religion, ought in reason to be tolerated in England, which is a
thing in it self most true, yet we find the contrary by experience.

13 Number. 10. He says, that my Lord of Chalcedon, has only a general
^^^rituall power and Jurisdiction, over the Clergy, and lay Catholics in
spiritual matters. I have noe intention to dispute of my Lords authority: But
this proposition of M. D. makes good what I said in my first Question: that he
will either displease my Lord, by extenuating his Authority, or else make such
his authority dreadful to Catholics. For if this general authority which he
gives to my Lord, be only in foro interno, then it takes from my Lord, power
to make a certain Hierarchy of Vicar Generals, Arch deacons, etc. (for such
offices are for authority in f^ro externo) to meddle with Matrimonial causes,
to prove Wills, dispose of pious Legacies, visit Catholics houses, erect a
Tribunal etc. and hence it further is clearly deduced, that my Lord is
Ordinary, neither in name, nor power: For Ordinaries can do these things
mentioned: yea this is also manifest, by what M. Doctor teaches, that my Lord
of Chalcedon can challenge No Bishopric, no not so much as the poorest Parish
in England. Ergo, according to M. Doctor. my Lord of Chalcedo^ has not for
England all the Faculties, which other Ordinaries have, who certainly can
challenge some one particular Diocese, and diverse particular Parishes.
Moreover, seeing M. Doctor teaches, that my Lord has noe Title given him, to
any particular Bishopric in England, but only to Chalcedon, he must
consequently auerte, that my Lord cannot give the ^^^les of Vicar General,
Archdeacon etc. of London, or any other place, seeing my Lord himself has noe
such Title, nor is Bishop of London, or any other Diocese. If M. Doctors
meaning be, that my Lords general spiritual power over lay Catholics, is
also in foro externo, and exte^ds it self to the things above mentioned, then
Catholics have already told my L. in a letter directed to his Lordship, how
prejudicial such an Authority must be to them. To say, my Lord has such
power, but is resolved not to practice it, will not satisfy: because they are
loath, all their security should depend upon the free will, or particular
dictamen of a man, although never so learned, and wise, who either upon some
new occurring motives, and reasons, or by the instigation of others, may alter
his mind, and practice that, which himself once had no intention to practice.
And they will think, that they are less to be blamed for such a fear, seeing
my Lord claymed an authority (for example of approouing regulars, for hearing
the Confessions of secular persons) which proved not to be due unto him, and
which did concern, even the lay Catholics, in highest degree (for who would
not rather have their bodies disioynted on the rack, then their souls
tormented with scruple of inualid Confessions?) they will, I say, think it no
unreasonable fear, that if my Lord, in that particular, challenged an
authority not due, he might in some occasion practice a Right granted as due.
Finally, if such Authority be not practizable, why should it be pretended?
especially with so great fear, and offense of many worthy Catholics. Rather,
the very pretending it, will put men in fear, that something else is intended,
beside a bare power, never to be practiced. But, as I said, my meaning is not,
to meddle with my Lords Authority further the^ is necessary for Discussion, of
some propositions, delivered by M. Doctor concerning that point.

14 Number. 11. He endeauours to prove, that Religious need not fear, least my
L. Bishop incroach upon their Privileges, and that although there be some
difference betwixt him, and them concerning approbation, yet they need not
fear their other Privileges: as if their other Privileges, were more
privileged then this, or had power to hinder men from making whatsoever claim
against them. Rather, by what has been attempted in one, we may conjecture
what may befall the other.

Number. 12. He says there are no other laws against a Bishop, then are already
enacted, and in force against Priests, and Religious. What the lay gentlemen,
who are skillful in the modern, and ancient laws of England, judge of the
particular danger, to which they might be hable, if they should accept my Lord
as Ordinary, M. Doctor will find in their said letter. That which more
properly belongs to me, is, that although there were in this, the same reason
of a Bishop, and Priests; yet the necessity of having Priests, and a Bishop is
not alike. Without the one we cannot have remission of our sins, the holy
Sacrifice of the Mass, the blessed Sacrament of the Altar etc. Without the
other, we may have all things, even the Sacrament of Confirmation; for as for
ordaining Priests in England, it is neither needful, nor, for any thing I
know, practiced by my Lord of Chalcedon.

15 And thus having set down, some few, of those many things, which might have
been observed, in M. Doctors Treatise, I will make an end, if first I have
sincerly told the reader, what was my wish, when I undertook this Discussion,
and what at this present my hearty desire is, and I hope in God for ever shall
be. My wish at the first was: That, rather then I should utter any thing, in
diminution of Charity, in disparagement of sacred Episcopal Dignity, in
prejudice of the common good of Catholics; Almighty God would forbid my pen
to cast ink, and (if that were not enough) benumbe my right hand, as it
happened to the Emperor Valens, while he was penning a Decree, to banish that
holy Monk, and Bishop, S. Basil the Great, out of his Church. My present desire
is, that howsoever Regulars may by some be esteemed to oppose for their own
ends, the having a Bishop in england, or some authority by him chale^ged; yet
in testimony of the contrary, I, who acknowledge my self, of all others the
most imperfect, am not so insensible of the good of souls, but that I would
most willingly spend my blood, for the purchasing of times, suitable with the
enjoying of a Catholic Bishop in England, endued with as much Authority, as
any particular Bishop in the whole Church of God. And upon this happy
condition, I cordially wish, that the last moment of writing these lines, might
prove, the longest term of my life.
