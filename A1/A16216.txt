Hang Pinching,
OR,
The good fellows Observation,
Among a Ioviall Crew,
Of them that hate Flinching,
But is always true blew.
To the tune of Drive the Cold winter away.


ALL you which lay clame,
To a good fellows name,
and yet do not prove your selves so,
Give ear to this thing,
The which I will sing,
wherein I most plainly will show
With proof and good ground,
Those fellows profound,
that unto the Alewiues are true,
In drinking their drink,
And paying their chinke,
O such a good fellow's true blew,
But otherwise be,
That brabling will be,
about any trifle to pay,
When that he does know
He so much does owe,
yet basely will shrink his way,
Or bring the sum less,
Disparaging guess,
which willing would pay al that is due,
His Company I,
Detest and defy,
Because that he is not true blew.
Somes Chaps are so nimble,
They Will sit and lick the wimble,
but when that the Reckning's to pay,
Away they will sneake,
And not a word speak,
all which is approved each day,
The which having seen,
Does draw me with spleen,
to lay open unto your view.
The honest good fellow,
Who though he be mellow,
In every kind is true blew.
He Is of the right mould,
That spares not his gold,
Amongst those good fellows that lack,
If that they will drink,
he will part with his Chinke,
and looks not for any on it back,
But is well content,
His money is spent,
among such a iouiall Crew,
And these are the parts,
And cheifest deserts,
That shows a good fellow true blew.
Such difference I
Do daily discry,
amongst the Conditions of men,
Some given are to fight,
Some in singing delight,
pray what shall be censured then,
Why truly my mind,
To him is inclinde,
by whom unto mirth I am drew.
For much I do hate,
He that breeds debate,
But give me a fellow true blew,
There Is some of that mind,
When that they do find
a man that is iouiall and free,
They Will drink and they will call,
But he must pay all,
or else undischarg'd it must be.
Once being served so,
No more will I go,
into such a frivilous Crew,
And so I Will advise
All those that are wise,
Because that they are not true blew.
