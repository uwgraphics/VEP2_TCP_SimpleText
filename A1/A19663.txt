One and thyrtye Epigrammes wherein are brieflye touched so many abuses, that
may and ought to be put away. Compiled and Imprinted by Robert Crowley,
dwellinge in Elye rentes. in Holburne. Anno domini. 1550.

i. Cor. xiiii. What so ever ye do, let the same be done to edify wythall.
Gala vi. If I should study to please men: than could I not be the servant
of Christ. The Book to the Reader.
IF books may be bold
to blame and reprove,
The faults of al men
boeth high and low:
As the Prophets did
whom Gods spirit did move,
Than blame not mine Author,
for right well I know:
His pen is not tempered
vain doctrine to sow,
But as Esaye has bidden
so must he neades cry, Esai. 5^

And tell the Lords people
of their iniquity.
Now if I do the worldlinges
in any point offend
In that I reprove them
for their wyckednes:
It is a plain token
they will not emende
I take all the wise men
of the earth to wytnes,
To them therefore mine Author
bids me confess,
That since they be determined
still in their sin to dwell:
John. iii.
He accounts them no better
than fire brandes of hell.
Wherefore he bade me bid them
hold them content,
He has not written to them
that will not emende,
For to the willinge wicked
no prophet shall be sent
Except it be to tell them
that at the last end
They shall be sure and certain
with Satanas to wend.
For before such swyne
Mat. vii.
no pearls may be cast,
That in the filthye puddell
take all their repaste.
To such only therefore
I must his message do,
As have not their delight
in wickedness to dwell,
But when they hear their fault
are sorye they did so,
And louingely embrace
such men as do them tell, Luke. v.

Reformynge evermore
their life by the gospel.
To these men am I sent
and these I trust will take
My warning in good part
and their evil forsake.
John, viii. He that is of God, hears the word of God.

Of Abbayes.
AS I walked alone
and mused on things,
That have in my time
been done by great kings.
I bethought me of Abbayes
that sometime I saw,
Which are now suppressed
all by a law.
O Lord (thought I then)
what occasion was here,
To provide for learning
and make pouertye chere?
The lands and the Jewels
that hereby were had,
Would have found godly prechers
which might well have ladde:
The people aright
that now go astraye,
And have fed the pore
that famishe every day.
But as I thus thought
it came to my mind,
That the people will not se
but delight to be blind,
Wherefore they are not worthy
good preachers to have,
Nor yet to be provided for
but still in vain to crave.
Than said I (O Lord God)
make this time short, Mat. 24.

For their sakes only Lord
that be thy chosen sort.
Of Alehouses
NEades must we have places
for vitailes to be sold,
For such as be sick
pore, feeble, and old.
But lord to how great
abuse they be grown,
In each little Hamlet,
village, and town.
They are become places
of waste and excess,
An herber for such men
as live in idleness.
And lyghtlye in the country
they are placed so,
That they stand in men's way
when they should to church go.
And than such as love not
to hear their faults told
By the minister that reads
the new testamente and old.
Do turn into the alehouse
and let the church go.
Yea, and men accounted wise
and honest do so.
But London (God be praised)
all men may commend
Which does now this great
enormitie emende
For in Service time
no door stands up, A commendation of London.

Where such men are wont
to fill can and cup.
Would God in the country
they would do the same
Either for gods fear
or for worldely shame.
How hallow they the Saboth
that do the time spend,
In drynkinge and idleness
till the day be at an end?
Not so well as he does
that goes to the plowe,
Or pitcheth up the sheues
from the carte to the mow.
Mat. xiii
But he does make holy
the Sabothe in deed,
That hears Gods word
and helps such as need.
Of Allayes.
TWo sorts of Allayes
in London I find,
The one against the law
and the other against kind.
The first is where bowlinge
forbidden men use,
And wasting their good
do their labor refuse.
A dispraise of London.
But in London (alas)
some men are deuillishelye
Suffered to profess it,
as an art to live by.
Well I will say no more
but such as live so,
And officers that suffer them
shall together go.
To Satan their fire
for of god they are not,
Who commands to labor
six days ye wotte. Exo. xxiii.

And the seventh he commands
all men to sanctify,
In being well occupied
and not idlelye
The other sort of Allayes
that be against kind, Allayes against kind.

Do make my heart weep
when they come to my mind.
For there are pore people
welmoste innumerable,
That are driven to beg,
and yet to work they are able.
If they might have althinges
provided aright,
Alas, is not this,
a great over sight?
Ye Aldermen and other
that take Allaye rent
Why bestow ye not the riches
that god has you sent.
In woule or in flax
to find them occupied
That now lie and beg
by every high way side.
And you that be chief
and have the commune treasure
Why can you never find
a time of leisure
To se where the treasure
will find them workinge
To the profit of the City
in some manner thing
But (alas) this my tale,
is to deaf men told
For the charity of rich men
is now through cold.
And this is a City
in name, but in deed
It is a pack of people
that seek after mede. Look the diffinitio^ of a city you that be served

For officers and all
do seek their own gain,
But for the wealth of ye commons
not one takes pain
An hell without order
I may it well call
Where every man is for him self
and no man for all.
Of Alms houses.
A Marchaunte that long time
had been in strange lands
Returned to his country
which in Europe stands:
And in his return
his way lay to pass,
By a Spittle house not far from
where his dwelling was.
He looked for this hospital
but none could he se,
For a Lordely house was builte
where the hospital should be.
Good Lord (said this merchant)
is my country so wealthy?
That the very beggars houses
be builte so gorgeouslye?
Than by the way side
him chanced to se,
A pore manne that craved
of him for charity.
Why (quod this Merchant)
what means this thing?
Do ye beg by the way
and have a house for a king?
Alas sir (quod the poor man)
we are all turned out,
And lie and dye in corners
here and there about.
Men of great riches,
have bought our dwellinge place,
And when we crave of them
they turn way their face.
Lord God (quod this merchant)
in Turkye have I been,
Yet emonge those Heathen,
none such cruelty have I seen
The vengeance of god
must fall, no remedy,
Upon these wicked men
and that very shortelye.
Of Baylife Arrantes.
A Baylife there was
in the weste country,
That did as they do
in all quarters men say.
He served with one write
an whole score or twain,
And took in hand to excuse them
having pence for his pain.
And when he should warn a quest
in sessions to appear,
He would surely warn them
that would make him no cheer.
And than take a bribe
to make answer for them,
But when he metie his friends
than would he say but hem.
But such as had no cheer
nor money to pay
Were sure to trudge,
to the sessions always.
The baylifes hadlande
Ye must give him some thing.
to sow his hadlande
Or else ye can have,
no favor at his hand.
Some puddyngis or Baken,
or chese for to eat
A bushel of barley,
some malt or some wheat.
His hadland is good grownd,
and bears all thing
Be it Baken or beffe,
stockefyshe or lynge.
Thus pore men are pold,
and pyld to the bare
By such as should serve them:
to keep them from care.
Of Bawdes.
THe bawdis of the stues
be turned all out
But some think they inhabit,
al England through out
In tauerns and tiplyng houses,
many might be found
If officers would make search
but as they are bound
Well let them take heed
I will say no more
But when god reuengeth
he punishes sore
An horrible thing,
it is for to fall
Into that Lordis handis Hebr. x.

that is eternal
Of Beggars.
THe Beggars whom need
compels to crave
Ought at our handis
some relief to have
But such as do counterfayt,
haueynge their strength
To labor if they lust,
being known at the length
Ought to be constrained,
to work what they can
And live on their labors
as besemeth a christyan
And if they refuse
to work for their meat
i. Tim iii
Then ought they to fast
as not worthy to eat
And such as be sore
and will not be healed
Ought not many case
to be charished
I heard of two beggars
Of two beggars
that under an hedge sat
who did with long talk
their matters debate.
They had boeth sore legs
most loathsome to se
Al raw from the foot
welmost to the knee
My leg, quod the one
I thank god is fair
So is mine (quod the other)
in a cold air
For then it looks raw
and as red as any blood
I would not have it healed
for any worldis good
For were it once whole
my lyuinge were gone,
And for a sturdye beggar
I should be take anon.
No man would pittye me
but for my sore leg,
Wherefore if it were whole
I might in vain beg.
I should be constrained
to labor and sweat,
And perhaps sometime
with schourges be beat.
Well (said the the other)
let us take heed therefore,
That we let them nor heat
but keep them still sore.
An other thing I heard
of a beggar that was lame, Of an other beggar.

Much like one of these
if it were not the same.
Who syttinge by the fire
with the cup in his hand.
Began to wonder when
he should be a good husband.
I shall never thrive
(quod this beger) I wene,
For I gate but.xvi.d. to day
and have spente eyghtene.
Well let the world wagge
we must neades have drink
Go fill me this quarte pot
full to the brynke,
The tongue must have bastinge
it will the better wagge,
To pull a gods penye
out of a churles bag.
Yet cesse not to give to all
without any regard,
Though the beggars be wicked
thou shalt have thy reward.
Of Bearbaytynge.
WHat follye is this?
to keep with danger,
A great mastyfe dog
and a foul ouglye Bear.
And to this only end
to se them two fight,
With terrible tearing
a full ouglye sight.
And yet me think those men
be most foles of all
Whose store of money
is but very small.
And yet every sunday
they will surely spend,
One penye or two
the bearwardes living to mende.
At Paryse garden each sunday
a man shall not fail, Parise garden

To find two or three hundredes
for the bearwardes veil.
One halpenye a piece
they use for to give
When some have no more
in their purse I believe.
Well, at the last day
their conscience will declare
That the pore ought to have
all that they may spare.
Eccle. iiii
For God has commanded
that what we may spare,
Be given to the pore
that be full of care.
If you give it therefore
to se a Bear fight,
Be ye sure gods curse
will upon you light.
Of Brawlers.
A Brawler that loves
to break the kings peace,
And seek his own sorrow
his fansye to please.
Is like a curre Dog
that sets upon
Each mastyfe and hounde
that he may light on.
He gets him hatered
of every manne
And meteth with his master
ever now and than.
To hurt other men
he takes great pain:
He turns no man
to profit or gain.
Except it be the Surgian
or the Armorer
The Baylife, the constable
or the Iayler.
This is a worthy membre
in a commune wealth,
That to work other woe
will lose his own health.
What other men will judge
I can not tell
But if he escape Tiburne
I think he will hang in hell.
Of Blasphemous swerers.
THe son of Syrach
writes playnelye, Eccl. xxiii

Of such men as do
swear blasphemouselye.
The manne that swears much
shall be filled, says he,
With all wicked manners
and iniquity.
In the house of that manne
the plage shall not cease,
He shall be still plaged
either more or less.
Math. v.
Christ bids all his,
affirm and deny,
With yea yea, nay nay,
affirmynge no lie.
What so ever ye add more
(says he) comes of evil.
And is of the wicked
suggestion of the devil.
But we can not talk
wythouten oaths plentye
Some swear by gods nails
his heart and his body,
And some swear his flesh,
his blood and his foot.
And some by his guts
his life and heart rote.
Some other would seem
all swearynge to refrain,
And they inuente idle oaths
such is their idle brain.
By cock and by pie
and by the gose wynge
By the cross of the mouse foot
and by sa^ncre chyckyn.
And some swear by the deuell
such is their blindenes,
Not knowing that they call
these things to wytnes.
Of their Consciences in that
they affirm or deny,
So boeth sorts commit
most abominable blasphemy.
Of the colier of Croydon.
IT is said that in Croydon
there did sometime dwell,
A Colier that did
all other Coliers excel.
For his riches this Colier
might have been a knight
But in the order of knighthode
he had no delyght.
Would god all our knights
did mind colinge no more,
Than this Colier did knyghtyng
as is said before.
For when none but pore coliars
did with coals mell,
At a reasonable price
They did their coals sell.
But sense our knighte Coliars
have had the first sale
We have paid much money
and had few sackes to tale.
A lode that of late years
for a royal was sold,
Will cost now.xvi.s.
of silver or gold.
God grant these men grace
their polling to refrain.
Or else bring them back
to their old state again.
And especially the Colier
that at Croydon does sell,
For men think he is cosen
to the Coliar of hell.
Of Commotioners.
WHen the body is vexed
through humors corrupted
To restore it to health
those humors must be purged
For if they remain
they will still increase:
Every day more and more
and augment the disease.
So that in short time
the body must decay,
Except God give health
by some other way.
Even so does it fare
by the weal public
Which chances to be often
diseased and sick.
Through the mischeuous malice
of such men as be,
Desierous to break
the publyke unity.
Each public body
must be purged therefore
Of these rotten humors
as is said before.
Else will it decay,
as do the bodies natural
When rotten humors
have infected them over all
But if the publyke body,
can not be purged well
By force of purgacion
as phicisins do tell
When bodies be weak,
and so low brought
That by purgacion,
no health can be wrought
Then must there be sought
some easyer way
To kill ye strength of those humors
as phiasians say.
When the sword will not help
in the commune wealth
To purge it of Commotioners
and bring it to health.
Than must discrete counsel
find ways to kill,
The power of those rebels
and let them of their will.
And that must be by cherishing
the humors natural,
And by quyckenynge again
of the spirits vytall.
Which in the commune wealth
are the subjects true,
That do always study
Sedition to eschew.
When these me^ through cherishing
do grow and be strong:
Than can not Commocioners
continue long.
For as when the strength
of ill humors is killed,
In a natural body
they be sone comsumed.
Or made of evil good
as it is plain to se:
So will it betyde
of such men as be.
In the commune wealth
given unto sedision,
When they se they cannot
finyshe their intention.
And what is their power
but the people ignoraunte
Whom they do abuse
by their councelles malignaunt?
When the hertes of the people
be won to their prince,
Than can no commotioners
do hurt in his province.
If this will not help
than God will take cure,
And destroy these Commosioners
we may be right sure.
Except the time be come
that the body must dye,
For than there can be found
no manner remedy.
God grant that our sin
have not brought us so low,
That we be pass cure
god only does this know.
And I trust to se health again
if the final end,
Be not now nere at hand
which the Lord shortelye send.
Of commen drunkardes.
ESaye lamenteth
and says out alas
Much woe shall betide you
that do your time pass. Esaye. v.

In eatinge and drinckynge
from morninge to night,
Till none of your members
can do his office right.
Woe be to you, says he,
that do so earlye rise,
To fill your selves with drink
in such beastelye wise
But if he were now living
and saw this worlds state,
He would say this of our drunkards
that sit up so late.
For few of our drunckardes
do use to rise earelye,
But much of the night
they will drink lustelye.
Well, i. Cor. i.
saint Paul does warn
all that be of pure mind
To avoid drunckardes company
where so ever they do them find.
Se ye neither eat nor drink
with such men, says he,
That be given to drinkinge
what so ever they be,
But alas many curates
that should us this tell
Do all their parishioners
in drynckynge excel.
Of commune Liars.
Sapi. i.
SOlomon the sage
in Sapience does say
That the mouth that lies
does the very soul sleye.
If the murderer of bodies
be worthy to dye,
The murderer of souls
should not escape, trow I.
For as the Soul does
the body excel
So is his treaspace greater
that does the soul quell.
But Liars (alas)
are now much set by,
And thought to be men
in a manner necessary.
To be entertained
of each noble manne,
Who are much delighted
with lies now and than.
But this delight will be sorrow
I fear me at the last,
When the liar for his liynge
into pains shall be cast.
Of Dicears.
EMonge wyttye sayings
this precept I find, Cato.

To avoid and fle dice (my son)
have ever in mind.
For diceynge has brought many
wealthye men to care,
And many rich heir
it has made full bare.
Some men it has set up
I will not deny,
And brought to more worship
than they be worthy.
God knows to what end
he suffers this thing
Perchance to reward them
with hell at their ending.
For doubtless those goods
are gotten amiss
That are gotten from him
that prodigal is.
And especially at the dyce,
where boeth do intend
To get the others goodis,
or else his own to spend.
Now if prodigalitye
or couetise be vice
He can not but offend,
that plays at the dyce
For be they two or mo,
this thing is certain
Prodigalytie and couetise
do in them all raygne
Beside the wicked oaths,
and the time myspent
Whereof they thyncke they need not
them selves to repent.
But this I dare say,
that though dyrynge were no sin,
Nor the goodis mysgoten,
that men do thereat win
Yet the oaths that they swear
and the time myspent
Shall be their damnacion
unless they repent.
Leave of your vain dyceyng
ye dycers therefore
For unless ye repent,
god has vengeance in store
And when ye think least,
then will he pour it out
And make you to stoop,
be ye never so stout.
Of double benificed men.
THe king of that realm,
where justice does reygne
Perused old statutis,
that in bokis remain.
And as he turned the book,
him chanced to se
That such as have benifices
should residente be.
And have their abidynge
whiles their life should endure
Emonge them over whom
god has given them cure.
Than said he to him self
I think well there is,
No law in this realm
worse observed than this.
Yet can there nothing
my flock more decay,
Than when hirelynges suffer
my sheep to go astraye.
Then called he his counsel
and told them his mind,
And willed that they should
some remedy find.
Who with good advice
agreed on this thing,
That visitours should be sent
with the power of the king
To punyshe all such
as herein did offend
Unless they were found
through willing to amend.
These visitours found many stout
priests, but chieflye one, Osee. iiii

That had sondrye benifices
but would surrender none.
Than was this stout fellow
brought to the king,
Who said unto him,
sir how chances this thing?
Will ye transegresse my laws
and than disobeye:
Men having my power?
sir what can you say?
If it may like your grace (quod he)
lo here is to se,
Your seal at a grant
of a plurality.
Well, said the king than,
I repent me of all ill:
But tell me master doctoure
will you have your benifices still?
If your grace do me right (quod he)
I must have them my life time,
So shall thou (quod the king)
for to morrow by pryme
God willing, thy body,
shall be divided and sent
To each benifice a piece,
to make the resident.
Away with him (quod the king)
and let al thyngis be done
As I have given sentence,
to morower none
For sith thou art a stout priest
an example thou shall be
That all stouburne priests,
may take warnyng by the.
Of the Exchecker
IN the weste part of Europe
there was sometime a king
That had a court for receyte,
of money to him belonging.
But the ministers for that Court,
did long and many a day
Take brybes to bear with such me^
as should forfaytis pay.
At the last to the king,
this their falshode was told
By such as about him,
were faithful and bold.
Then did the king send,
for these ministers ill
And laid all their treaspases,
before them in a byl.
Then were they abashed,
and had naught to say
But cried for his pardon,
but he bade away.
Ye have borne with thieves,
and have robbed me
And suffered my commons,
impoueryshed to be.
No statute could cause,
offendars to emende
Because you did bear with them
when they did offend.
Away with them all,
lay them fast in prisone
Till we have determined,
what shall with them be done.
What judgment they had,
I have not heard yet.
But well I wot they deserved,
a tiburne typpet.
Of Fatterars.
A Flattering friend,
is worse then a foe.
For a friend is betrusted,
when the other is not so.
Of an open enemy,
a man may be ware,
ii. Re. iii.
when the flatteryng friend,
will work men much care.
For if Abner had known,
what was in Ioabs heart.
I do not doubt but he would,
have out of his way sterte.
Or at the least he would not,
have admitted him so ny:
As to be embraced of him,
and on his dagger to dye.
Wherefore I advertise
al men to be ware
Of all flattering frendis,
that bring men to care.
As for open ennimies,
trust them if ye will,
I can not forbid you,
to admyt your own ill.
Would god all men would,
such flatterars try:
As hang at their elbowes
to get some what thereby.
But (alas) now adays,
men of honor do promote:
Many a false flattering,
and lewd harlot.
Which thing may at the length
be their own decay.
For if the wind turn,
the flatterars will away.
The swallowe in summer
will in your house dwell,
But when winter is coming
she will say farewell.
And when the short days,
begin to be cold
Robyn red breast will come hom^
to you and be very bold.
But when somer returns
and bushes wax grene,
Then Robyn your manne
will no more be seen.
So some of your flatterers
will in prosperity,
Be of your household
and of your family.
And some other will
when need does them pain
Sue to do you service
till they be wealthy again.
Of Foles.
THe preacher says thus
Eccle. iiii
a pore wittye ladde,
Is better than an old king
whose wit is but badde.
The wise manne in poverty
is right honorable,
When the fool in his riches
is worthy a babble.
Some foles there be of nature
that understand naught,
And some understand things
But do conceive in their thought
That they them selves be wisest
which follye passes all,
And does sone appear
boeth in great and small.
These foles will hear no man's
read or counsel,
And whatsoever they the^ selves do
is exceadynge-well.
But other men's doings
they will ever dispraise
None other can do ought
that may their minds please.
And further they think
it becomes them well
In every man's matter
them selves to entermell.
And when they come in place
where is any talk,
No man shall have time to speak,
their tongues shall so walk.
Of their own dedis and goodis,
they will brage and boste
And declare all their myshaps,
and what they have lost.
If ye tell them of their fautes,
then will they nedis fight
Ye must say as they say,
be it wrong or right
In fine ye must praise them
and set forth their fame
And how so ever they do,
Ye may them not blame.
If ye tell them of knowledge,
they say they lack none
And wyshe they had less,
and then they make moan
For the loss of vain toys,
where in they delight
And then if ye reasone far,
beware, they will fight
All wise men take heed,
and shun their company
For of all other men,
they are most ungodly
Of Forestallers.
THe fryses of Walis
to Brystow are brought
But before they are wouen
in walis they are boughte
So that now we do pay,
four grotis or else more
For the fryse we have bought,
for eight pens heretofore
And some say the woule,
is bought ere it do grow
And the corn long before,
it come in the mow.
But one thing there is,
that hurts most of all.
Many offices are bought,
long ere they fall.
And right so are benefices,
in every coaste.
So that persons and vicars,
keep neither sod nor roaste.
The pore of the parish,
whom the person should feed.
Can have naught of our tythis,
to succoure their need.
Reuertions of farms
are bought on each side,
And the old tenant must pay well
if he will abide.
And where the father paid a penye
and a Capon or twain,
The son must pay ten pound
this passes my brain
Well, let these forestallers
repent them betime,
Least the clarke of the market
be with them ere prime.
For he when he comes
will punish them all,
That do any neadefull thing
ingrosse or forestall.
For well I wotte this
when he went last away
He sent us his servant
and thus did he say.
i. Cor. x.
Se that among you
none seek his own gain,
But profit each other
with travail and pain.
Of Godless men.
Holy David that was
boeth prophet and king
Saw in his time
(as appears by his writing)
That in those days
there were men of wicked heart, Psalm. viii

That did all godly ways
utterly peruerte.
And so there are now
the pitye is the more,
That live more carnallye
than ever men did before.
These men (says king David)
in their hertes do say,
Surely there is no God
let us take our own way.
Thus judged king David
and that for good skyll
Because he saw their worckes
were wicked and evil.
They are (says he) corrupt
and naught in all their ways
Not one that does good.
and therefore he says
That they thyncke there is no god
their worckis do declare
For to do the thing that good is
they have no manner care.
But what would David say,
if he were in these days,
when men will do Ill,
and justify their ill weyes?
They leave the good undone,
and do that ill is.
And then they call that ill good,
what would David say to this?
I know not what David
would say in this case.
But I know that good Esaias,
does curse them apase.
Esai. v.
Woe, says this prophet,
to them that in do call.
That thing good that evil is
but this is not all.
He says woe to them,
that call dearckenes light.
Preferryng their fansey,
before the word of might
If they find a thing written
in Paul, Luke or John
Or any other scripture,
they will there of none:
Except they may easily,
perceive and se.
That with their fleshly fansey,
they may make it agree.
All other textis of scripture,
they will not stycke to deny.
Yea some of them will,
god and his scripture defy.
And say they will make merry here
for when they be gone,
They can have no joy,
for soul they have none.
If these men be not godles
much marvel have I,
Well, the cause is the Lords
let him and them try.
I know at the last
they shall find him to strong.
The day of his vengeance,
will not tarry long.
Of Idle persons
Idleness has been cause
Eccle 33
of much wyckednes.
As Ecclesiasticus,
does plainly wytnes.
Idle persons therefore,
can not be all clear.
As by the story of Sodom,
it does well appear
But that we may come nere,
to our own age
The Idleness of Abbays,
made them outrage.
Yet let us come nere,
even to the time present.
And se what myschyfe,
Idle persons do invent.
What co^spiracies have be^ wroght
within this little while.
By Idle men that did,
the commons begyle.
And what have Idle men,
always practiced.
To break the peace of princes,
that they might be hyered.
I will not say what,
the Idleness of priestis has done
Nor yet the Idleness,
of seruantis in London
Let every man search,
his own household well,
And whether the thing,
be true that I tell.
Yea what abuse did ever,
emonge the people rain.
But the same did first spring.
out of an Idle brayn.
Idleness therefore,
may right well be named
The gate of all mischief
that ever was framed.
Ye masters and fathers therefore
that fear God omnipotente,
Keep your families occupied
least ye be shente.
For if through their idleness
they fall into outrage,
Your judgment shall be straight,
for they are committed to your charge
Keep them therefore still occupied,
in doing your business.
Or else in reading or hearing
some books of Godliness.
And would god the maiestrates
would se men set a work,
And that within this realm
none were suffered to lurk.
This realm has three commodities
woule, tynne, and lead,
Which being wrought with in ye realm
each man might get his bread.
Of inuenters of strange news.
SOme men do delight
strange news to inuente,
Of this man's doing
and that man's intent.
What is done in France
and in the Emperors land,
And what things the Scotes
are now taking in hand.
What the king and his counsel,
do intend to do,
Though for the most part
it be nothing so.
Such men cause the people
that else would be still,
To murmr and grudge
which thing is very ill.
Yea, We saw the experience of this of late.
sometime they cause
the people to rise,
And assemble them selves
in most wicked wise.
In Plato his commune wealth
such men should not dwell,
For Poets and Orators
he did expel.
Oh that these news bryngers
had for their reward,
New halters of hemp
to set them forward.
Of Lay me^ that take tithes, and priests that use their tithes priuatelye.
When Justice began
in judgment to sit,
To punish all such men
as faults did commit.
Than was there a man
before her accused,
For tithes that he took,
and priuatelye used.
When due proof was had
and the thing manifest,
The witnesses sworn,
and the trespace confeste.
Then gave the Judge judgment
and these words he spoke
Se that from this Caytife
all his goods ye take.
For seeing he made that private
that commune should be,
He shall have this justice
by the judgment of me.
Those pore men that by the tithes
should be relieved
Shall have al his goods
emonge them divided.
And because he showed no mercy,
no mercy shall he have, Jacob. ii.

The sentence is given,
go hang up the slave.
Of Leasemongers.
OF late a Leasemonger
of London lay sick,
And thinckinge to dye
his conscience did him prick.
Wherefore he said thus
with him self secretly,
I will s^nd for a preacher
to know what remedy.
But whiles he thus lay
he fell in a slumbre,
And saw in his dream
pore folk a great number.
Who said they had learned this,
at the preachers hand,
To pay all with patience
that their Landelordes demand.
For they for their sufferaunce
in such oppression,
Are promised reward
in the resurrection.
Where such as take leases
them selves to advance,
Are certain to have hell,
by right inheritance.
Of Merchants.
IF Merchants would meddle,
with Marchaundice only,
And leave farms to such men
as must live therebye.
Then were they most worthy
to be had in price,
As men that provide us,
of all kinds Marchaundice.
But sithe they take farms
to let them out again,
To such men as must have them
though it be to their pain.
And to leauye great fines
or to over the rent,
And purchase great lands
for the same intent:
We must neades call them
members unprofitable,
As men that would make
all the realm miserable.
How they leave of their trade
and lend out their money
To young Marchaunte men
for great vsurye,
Whereby some young men
are driven to leave all,
And do into most extreme
pouertye fall:
It greueth me to write,
but what remedy?
They must hear their fault
sithe they be so greadye.
And thus I say to them
and true they shall it find,
The Lord will have all
their ill doings in mind.
And at the last day
when they shall arise.
All shall be laid plain
before their own eyes.
Where judgment shall be given
Jacob. ii.
as saint James does wytnes.
Without all mercy,
to such as be merciles.
Of men that have diverse offices
When the City of Rome
was ruled aryght,
As aunciente Autours
do record and write
Ambition was punished
with utter exile
Yet were there some that did
venture some while.
But we read not of any
that ever went about,
To have two offices at once
were they never so stout.
But alas in this Realm
we count him not wise,
That seeks not by all means
that he can devise.
To rack offices together
without any stay,
But Christ shall say to these men
at the last day.
Give accou^ts of your Baliwickes
ye men without grace, Luke. xvi

Ye that sought to be rulers
in every place.
Give accountes of your Baliwike
for come is the day,
That ye must leave your offices
and walk your fathers way.
Of Nice wives.
THe son of Sirache
of women does say, Eccl. xxvi

That their nicenes and hordom
is perceived always.
By their wanton lokes
and liftynge up of eyes,
And their lokinge ascoye
in most wanton wise.
And in the same
Jesus Syrach I find
That the gate and the garment Eccle. xi

do declare the mind.
If these thyngis be true,
as no doubt they be.
What should we thynk of the women
that in London we se?
For more wanton lokis,
I dare boldly say.
Were never in Jewish whores,
then in London wines this day
and if the gate and the garmentis,
do show any thing.
Our wives do pass their whoris,
in whorlyke deckyng.
I thyncke the abominable,
whores of the stews
Did never more whorelyke,
attyerments use.
A cappe on her head,
like a sowes mawe.
Such an other facion,
I thyncke the Jew, never saw.
Then fine gear on the forehead,
set after the new tryk.
Though it cost a crown or two.
what then? they may not stycke.
If their heir will not take color
then must they by new.
And lay it out in tussockis,
this thing is to true.
At each side a tussocke,
as bygge as a ball.
A very fair sight
for a fornicator bestiall,
Her face fair painted,
to make it shine bright.
And her bosom all bare,
and most whorelyke dight.
Her mydle braced in,
as small as a wande:
And some bye wastes of wyre
at the paste wives hand.
A bumbe like a barrel
with whoopes at the skyrte,
Her shoes of such stuff
that may touch no dyrte.
Upon her white fyngers
many rings of gold,
With such manner stones
as are most dearlye sold.
Of all their other trifles
I will say nothing,
Least I have but small thanckes
for this my writynge.
All modeste Matrons
I trust will take my part,
As for nice whippers words
shall not come nigh my heart.
I have told them but truth
let them say what they will,
I have said they be whore like
and so I say still.
Of Obstinate Papists
AN obstinate Papiste
that was sometime a Friar
Had of his Friars cote
so great a desire.
That he stale out of England
and went to Louayne.
And gate his Friars cote
on his foles back again.
A wilful Beggar
this papist will be.
A fool and a friar,
and thus is one man three.
Would god all the papistis,
that he left behynd.
Where with him in fryes cotis,
according to their kind.
Or else I would they were,
with their father the pope.
For whylse they be in England,
they do but live in hope.
And except they might get,
the Bible book burned.
Into dispeyre their hope,
will shortly be turned.
God grant them the grace
this hope to forsake,
And their natural prince
for their head to take.
Forsakinge the Pope,
with all his peltrye:
Which of long time
they have set so much by.
Of rent raysers.
A Man that had lands
of ten pound by year
Surueyed the same
and let it out dear.
So that often pound
he made well a score,
More pounds by the year
than other did before.
But when he was told
what danger it was
To oppress his tenauntes
he said he did not pass.
For this thing he said
full certaynelye he wyste,
That with his own he might,
always do as he list.
But immediatlye I trow
this oppressoure fyl sick:
Luke. xvi
Of a voice that he heard
give accountes of your Baliwicke.
Of Vain writers, vain talkers and vain hearers.
OF late as I lay
and lacked my rest,
At such time as Titan
drew fast to the East.
This saying of Christ
came into my mind,
Which certain and true
all manner men shall find.
Of every idle word
ye shall give a rekeninge. Mat. xii.

Be it spoken by mouth,
or put in writing.
O Lord (thought I then)
what case be they in,
That talk and write vaynely
and think it no sin?
Than slombred I a little
and thought that I saw,
Three sorts of vain men
condemned by gods law.
The one was a writer
of things naught and vain.
And an other a talker
and this was their pain.
The writer had the crown
of his head opened,
Whose brains with a stycke
the talker styrred.
And he with boeth hands
drew the talkers tongue,
so that without his mouth
it was an handefull long.
The third was an herkener
of fables and lies,
Whose ears were almost
drawn up to his eyes.
Of insatiable purchasers.
AN unreasonable rich manne
did ride by the way,
Who for lack of men
had with him a boy.
And as he paste by a pasture
most pleasant to se,
Of late I have purchased
this ground Jack, quod he,
Marye master (quod the boy)
men say over all,
That your purchase is great
but your household is small.
Why Jack (quod this rich man)
what have they to do?
Would they have me to purchase
and keep great house to? Luke xiiii

I can not tell (quod the boy)
what makes them to brawle.
But they say that ye purchase
the Devil, his dame and all.
Of Usurers.
A Certain man had lands
little though it were,
And yet would feign have lived
like a gentleman's pear.
Of this land he made sale
and took ready gold,
And let that for double the rent
of the land that was sold.
Than came there a broker,
and said if he would do:
As he would advise him,
he should make of one penye two.
Marye that would I feign do
(quod this usurer than)
I pray the teach me
the feate if thou can.
You shall (said this broker)
lend but for a months day:
And be sure of
a suffitiente gage always.
With a plain bill of sale
if the day be not kept,
And se that ye do
no causes accept.
Than must you be sure
that your intereste be
One penye for a shyllynge
and three pence for three.
So by the years end
twelve months give twelve pens
For the use of a shyllinge
lo I have told you al sens.
Than said this usurer
this matter goes well,
For my twentye pound land
that I chanced to sell.
I shall have four hundred
pound rent by the year,
To live like a Lord
and make iolye chere.
Than came there a Prophet
and told this manne plain
That heaven is no place, Psalm. xv.

for such unlawful gain.
Why sir (quod this Usurer)
it is my living,
Yea sir (quod this Prophet)
but it is not your calling.
You are called to live
after twentye pound by year,
And after that rate
ye should measure your chere.
Till god did increase you
by his merciful ways,
By encreasynge your corn
and your cattle in the leyes.
Which increase with your lands
you are bound to employe,
To the profit of all them
that do dwell you bye.
Ye are not borne to your self
neither may you take
That thing for your own
where of God did you make.
But Stuarde and Baylife
that shall yield a rekeninge,
At the day of Judgment,
Luke. xvi
for every thing.
And do ye not doubt
but then ye shall know,
Whether ye may your goods
at your pleasure bestow.
And whether ye may use
ways wicked and ill,
To increase your riches
at your own will.
But chieflye to lend
your goods to usury,
Is a thing that you shall
most dearelye abye.
For Christ says in Luke
that the Heathen do so,
Luke. vi.
Take heed lest ye flytte
from pleasure to woe.
Finis.
