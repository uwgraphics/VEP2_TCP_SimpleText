Here begins the book called the Pype / or Tonne / of the life of
perfection. The reason or cause whereof does plainly appear in the process.



Unto the devout readers.
THis work was written years ago. And now thought necessary to be send
forth: because of these new tangle persons / which in deed ben heretykes /
all though they will not so be called / yt done write new oppinions / and do
not only deprave all religions that commenly ben called by that name religion.
But also done corrupt the high religion of all religions. The new testament of
Christ / again whom they fare: Here is somewhat spoken in our commune tongue /
that all you may know all their false and subtle deceites / and the rather
beware of them. I beseech you apply all unto the best / and I most mekely do
submit my self unto charitable correction. And that is the very and only
cause (as often we have showed) that we done set forth our name. The old
wreched brother of Syon / Richard Whytforde.

A work of the three vows of religion / contrary unto the great Heretics
Lutheranes / much profitable unto religious persons: gathered by a brother of
Syon / Richard Whytforde.
The preface. In our lord god / and most sweet savior Jesus: salutacion.
GOod devout religious daughter: you have often and instantly required me / to
write unto you / and unto your systers / some good lesson of religion. And yet
you know well / I am but as a nouisse in religyon my self: more mete to learn
/ then to teache religion. And (to say trothe) much unworthy to speak of good
religion. Not withstanding / trusting in the grace / and help of our lord:
by your holy prayers. I shall (according unto my poor abilite) enforce / and
give diligence: somewhat to satisfy your devout mind / and religious desire.
Wherefore call unto your remembrance: the similitude / lykenes / or example /
that I have made unto you / and diverse of your systers (not without the
authorite of holy doctors) of the life of parfection. That is to say / that
the life or manner of living / of perfection (as in this state of our
mortality) is much like unto a pleasant / precious / and wholesome wine /
contained / preserved / and kept in a pype or tonne. Which vessel ben
communely made of planed bordes. And those bordes compassed about / and bound
fast with hopes. And yet those hopes: bound and made fast with small wykers.
So that if the wykers (by any chance) be losed or broken: the hopes forthwith
/ done fly or starte of. The bordes than done lose / and ben divided or
departed in sondre. And so does the wine flow out and perisshe. In like manner
is it of the life of perfection: which is closed and kept most surely in
religion. And religyon is made and stands principally / in the.iii. euenciall
vows / obedience / wilful poverty / and chastity. For these three (as in
manner the bordes of the said vessel) ben the substanciall parts of religyon.
Which vows (not withstanding) ben compassed and bound to gether (as the said
vessel with the hopes) with the precepts / and counsel of the holy rules:
other of saint Augustine / saint Benedicte / or saint Franciske: Vel in graecis
Basilij, or in greek of Basilius. And yet those rules ben knytte and made fast
to gether (as the said hopes with ye wykers) with ye holy seremonies of
religion: which ben contained in the statutes / and constitucions / addicions
/ injunctions. And in the laudable customs of every singular monastery: or of
the general ordinances of the same religion. Note well now the example / or
similitude. For as in the said pype: when the small wykers ben broken or
losed: all ye residue does follow fail and decay / unto ye destruction of ye
wine? So in like manner / when the holy ceremonies of religion ben neglected /
forgoten / lost / put a way / broken / despised / littell or naught set by:
Than done ye rulers decay: and the vows losed ben little regarded or of no
strength. Rreligion is gone and the life of perfection clean distroyed and
lost. The decay of religion in this present time of our age (pytie to say) is
evident. And surely the great cause / and occasion thereof: is the contempt /
and negligence of the wykers: the small ceremonies. For you may take this for a
sure trothe. That person in religion: that does despise or set little by the
least or smallest cerimonie / shall never be good ne perfyte religious person.
Hit does therefore seem unto me most convenient: that we speak first of the
holy ceremonies of the religion. As of the wykers / and than of the rules / as
of the hopes. And in the third place of ye essencials of religion. That is
the.iii. vows / obedience / wilful poverty / and chastity / as of the
bordes. In the.iiii. place of the self religion. As of the vessel / pype / or
tonne: And last in the fyfte place / of the life of perfection: as of the
pleasant / precious / and most wholesome wine. This shall be the order of our
institucion and purpose in this your devour and religyous request. Not
withstanding we have of late / seen diverse works in latin / send out openly
in prynte: again all manner of religion. For the great heretyke Luther with all
his discyples: done deprave / and utterly condemn all manner of religyons /
except only (as they call hit) the religyon of Christ. And specially to make
any vow / or promise unto any of the said essencials / that is to say /
obedience / poverty / or chastity / according unto any of the said rules.
Wherefore I thought necessary (unto the comfort of all such persons as have
or done purpose or intend to enter religion) somewhat after my poor
understanding / to speak thereof. And so to answer / that the reders may have
some reasons and trouthes ready to avoid the perylous poison of such blaterers
/ and to give the less credence unto their words. 1. Cor. 15. D.
For truth it is that the holy Apostle says. Corrumpunt bonos mores,
colloquia mala. Yuell communicacion / yuell talkyng / and yuell words: done
corrupt and distroy good manners and virtues. First than we shall reherce their
reasons and sayenges again religion. And than shall we make answer (as it
may please our lord) unto the same.

Here ends the preface.
Of the reasons of the Heretics again religion: And first of their reason in
general. The first chapter.
How devout reders you must ymagen that the self heretics done speak / for
ye reasons that done follow: ben their reasons / and done seem to be suerly
grounded upon scripture. And by reason thereof / they ben the more ieoperdous:
more subtylly done deceive / and more perilously done poison the simple and
unlearned souls.

The first reason general.
Almighty god after that he had suffered his chosen people the children of
Israel: Prima ratio generalis.
long for their sins to be punysshed in Egypt / by the tyranny of king
Pharao / did (when the time came) mightfully and merueylously: deliver them by
the hand and power of Moses. And this was done in figure of Christ: that by
the father of heaven was send unto this world / made man / conceived / and
borne of the holy virgyn Marye: to deliver and redeem all mankind from the
bondage of the devil. So than our sweet lord and savior Jesus / by great
labors / by meruaylous pain and passion / by most shameful death: has
bought us out of the course of the law of Moses: Which was a law of rigor /
a law of vengeance / a law of thraldom and bondage / and a law of fear
and dread. And has put us unto the liberty and fredome of the gospel:
which is a law of pleasure / a law of mercy / a law of grace / a law of
liberty / and a law of love. So that now we be not bound seruandes / but we
ben children / And yet not only children / but also heirs and coheneritoures
unto Christ. To. 8. C.
Take heed now unto this subtle a false my^oue,
But alas alas for most deep sorrow / that we now have slypped / and ben
fallen and over thrown / from that sweet and most pleasant christian
liberty: unto more thraldom and bondage / than ever were the children of
Israel in Egypt. For now we have more folysshe and supersticious seremonies /
thanne ever had the Jews / Scribes / or Pharisees. So that now we be^
returned from Christ unto Moses / and from Moses unto Pharao. And lothynge
the Manna and most sweet spiritual meat of the gospel: we take delectacion
and pleasure in the pottes of flesh / and potage of Egypt. And nothing
content with the quietude / ease / and rest of the gospel: we done wilfully
give / sell / and bind our self unto the seruitute and thraldom of Egypt /
and unto the intolerable and lost labores of tyles and bryckes of claye / mire
/ and mucke of the same. And despisynge the sweet and comfortable yoke of the
life of Christ / and of the light and easy burden of his laws and doctrine:
we done more than wilfullybowe down / and charge our necks under the roughe /
hard / and rigorous yoke of the manners of men: that is unto the heuye lade /
and blockysshe burden of their constitucions / laws / and statutes. O good
lord / how folysshe / how mad ben we? what fend / what yuell sperite /
what inchauntementes / have thus be wytched us? That now so many hundredth
years / we have so miserably erred / slypped / and fallen clean down from the
high tower / and pleasant palace of fredome and liberty: unto the deep
dungyon of thraldom and bondage. From faith / unto mystruste. From hope /
unto doubt. From love / unto dread: from pure religion / unto peuysshe and
folysshe seremonies. From Christ / unto Moses: And from the gospel of god /
unto the old law of the Jews. So that now we shall end in the flesh:
that we began in the spirit. For that we enterprised and undertook
spiritually / we shall fenisshe and parfourme carnally. That we began gostly
/ we shall end synfully. For in the beginning of christianity all persons
(without any distinction or difference) were equally / and in like manner
christianes / as brethren and systers. Whether they were bond / or fre borne.
All were of one calling the elect / and chosen people of god. Holy preesthode
all sacred for to offer spiritual hoostes / and sacrifyce acceptable (by our
lord Jesus) unto almighty god. There was (I say) no difference / all were
priests. But only that women were prohibit / and forbode^ to preach: all
were the children of god. And (as we said before) heirs / and coenheritours
unto Christ. But now alas / all is turned clean contrary. For some persons
been the children of saint Augustine. Some the sons and daughters of saint
Benedicte / called saint Benet. Some of saint Franciske: some other of saint
Bernarde: some of saint Dominike / and so forth of many other / that now instead of the children of god / ben changed unto ye children of men: And that
instead of the law of god / done keep the laws of men. And thus have they
forsaken the gospel of god / which (as we said) is a law of love / and a
law of liberty / and have bound them self (and that by solemn vow) unto
the rules and laws of these men: which ben the laws of fear and dread / and
laws of thraldom and bondage. For where before the making of that vow and
profession / they were lose and in their own power / and so might have kept
the law of the gospel / all by love / in fredome / liberty / and gladness
of heart and mind. Now done they keep their rules (if they keep them as in
very deed few done or none: yet (say I) done they keep them for fear and
dread in thraldom / and for the bond of their vow and promise: with much
murmr and gruge / and with an yuell will. The auctour
Now done the heretics conclude: with four reasons crafty and false / as
shall appear.

Of the conclusion of the heretics / with four subtle reasons after their
exclamacions.

The heretics done speak again.
Now all you christianes: all you simple and devout all though unlearned
persons: se / consider / and perceive: how by these crafty religious persons
you ben deceived / and brought in to a snare / to believe that to be good: Their
special reasons.
that is yuell / and noyous for to profess / and promise these vows: is
first a thing of great folly / and folisshnes. First reason.
Second: a thing of great presumption / and boldenes..2.
Third a thing assure da^pnation..3.
Or at the least (for the fourth reason) a thing of great peril:.4.
and ieopardy. First: it is a thing of great folly: The proves.
and madness / for what can be more roly or madness: tha^ to obtain / win / or
get that thing that with pain / woe / and labor / in fear and dread under
bondage / that might be obtained: and had with pleasure and ease / in love and
surete / under fredome and liberte. But the law of the gospel / the religion
of christ: is (as is said) a law of love / and of liberte / and sufficient
unto all christians: for their salvation. Ergo: to make any mo laws: or to
promise any mo religions: is a great folly / and mere madness. And also it is
more merit / and more worthy reward / or thank: to do any thing for love /
with good will and lyberte / than for dread compelled there unto by thraldom
and bondage. A case.
Example may prove this truth / let (in case) a person be present that is
in necessite or need / and an other person that of his own fre will / of his
own goods would help the nedy person / and relyue his necessite / were not
he more worthy thank tha^ an other person that were bound in obligacion /
and so of his det and dute should help the same nedy person again his mind
and will / only for his bond and obligacio^ / he must need more merit that
does offer will: than the person compelled by bound. So does appear the first
reason: that to make such vows / and to have such religions is nothing
necessary / but rather a thing of great folly / and mere madness. For the
second: prove of the second reason.
it is a great boldenes / and meruaylous presumpcion and rather a temptacion or
provocation of god: than a trust in him / that a frail person whom god has
endowed with discrecion / and wisdom should adventure / put him self: Again
obedience.
that is to say his wealth and strength / his prosperity and pleasure / his
quietude and rest / his life / his death / his body and soul / his salvation
or dampnacion: in the governance and gydynge / in the rule and order of an
other person that he never knew / ne yet know. And that peradventure is a
fool / or has not so good will / so good learning / wisdom / reason /
ordinance / ne conueau^ce: as he has him self. So that where a good simple
person of fervent devotion / would feel and labor to obtain perfection / he
shall put him self thrale / and bound by vow and profession under a
sovereign / that not only does lack: and is void of learning / discrecion /
good manner / virtue / but also is more vicious in living / than the publicanes
/ and comune persons most noted of all lewdnes: and sinful abhominacions. So
that many times: the poor subject / that well intended and purposed / shall be
feign: and (in manner) compelled to leave / and forsake the laws of god / and of
the gospel: to follow (as they say for obedience) the rules and
commandments of a man. And yet would to god he were a man / and not rather a
best or a fend / thus their obedience is proved a folysshe presumpcio^.
Hearne pouerte.
And like wise of their wylful pouerte / a great presumpcion for any person so
clearly / and vterly to forsake the world / and all the goods and commodites
thereof / without which no person may live: that (under pain of dedely sin)
he may nothing have nor keep / nor yet make any provision or shyfte for him
self / what need so ever he have / but only hang at the will and pleasure of
an other person / that peraue^ture were more to be provided for / than to
provide for other persons / without fail a great presumption for very need
and necessite / will many times compel them to break that vow / which
therefore had be^ better unmade. And for their third vow: ^^^yne obedience.
and promise of chastity. It is a presumpcion above all presumpcious / that a
mortal person living here in the frail flesh: should enterprise promise /
and take upon him to live without the flesh / which is rather the life of
Angels / tha^ of man / for the act of the flesh is natural / and the
most natural act without which mankind might not be co^tynued and
preserved. 1. Co. 7. B.
The old proverb must needs also be true / it is hard to remove from the
flesh: that is bread in the bone. A great presumpcion therefore is it to
promise by solemn vow / that is contrary / and prejudice unto nature / for
saint Paul says. 1. Co. 7. B.
It is better for any person to be married tha^ to brenne by the fla^me of the
flesh. Prove of the.iii. reason.
Thyrdly to make these vows is sure dampnation / for it is contrary unto the
ordinance of god / and of nature / for god did make man in that condition:
that (naturally) he should have in his own power: the fredome and lyberte of
will. Sub te erit appetitus tuus, et tu dominaberis illius. Gene. 4.
The words of our lord unto Caym. Thine appetite / and passion shall be under
thy power / and in the liberte of thy will / and you shall be lord and master
thereof and it shall be under thy dominacion and governance / for by the liberte
of will / as well as by reason / understanding and memory / man: is the very
image of god. But by the promise of these vows: man makes thrale and bound:
that god made fre / and so (as much as lies in him) man does forsake that
similitude / and does deprive him self thereof / and wilfully does leave or
rather lose that liberte. Ergo: thus to promise and make vow: because it is
contrarious unto the ordinance of god / and nature is of sure and certain
da^pnation. Prove of the.iiii. reason
How for the fourth reason / it can not be denied: but (at the least) it
must needs be of most peril and ieoperdy of the said dampnation. Ecclo. 3. D
And the wise man says. Who so loves peril shall lightly fall therinto. But
these religious persons / done wylfully undertake and put them unto that
ieoperdy. Ergo they been most like to fall therinto. That such enterprise and
promises ben perilous and ieoperdous their own auctoure done record. Cesarius
an^onicione.
For Cesarius of them says / that as religion observed and kept is of most
high merit. So neglecte broken and not kept: Again obedience.
is it of most deep dampnation. But how religion is kept: all the world may
openly se / perceive and know. For where they done promise by their vow and
profession: obedience unto their souereyne / they keep none / except it be in
such things / as do please them self / let the souereyne command / exhort
counsel what they will / the subjects commonly in all places / will follow
no forther than their used term / the custom of the place. For if the
souereyne would refourme any part of their self professed rules / that of
long time has been neglecte and ouerpassed / they will sone answer and say.
Sir or Madame we byseche you pardon us thereof for that was never seen ne herd
of in this house. And if the souereyne would say / yet natwithstandynge: it is
our very rule that we have professed. They will again answer: here have been
(in time past) wise / sad / and learned persons of good conscience: and they
left it as they found it / and so we byseche you to leave us as you found us
/ for this was never used among us / And we done suppose and trust / that it
may be sufficient for us to do as other have done before us / and to keep the
custom of the place. And thus in conclusion obedience shall have no place
except it were by conpulsion / And I report me: Again po^erte.
what manner of obedience that is. They done also profess / and promise wylfull
pouerte / but as soon as their nouisshipe is past and some before they take
stipen selary and wages / as seculer prestes done some more some less. And
therewith and also with such money and gifts as their friends done give them
in alms / and such also as they done win and get by their bodily labor /
or by any other way and mean / they done therewith bye and sell / dyce / karde
and drink / and generally what they will at more propre lyberte / and more
nere unto them self / than ben worldly persons / and when they come abroad
they ben well appointed / and lack nothing to be desired. Their kynne and
friends ben setforth and promoted with the best / and yet done they call this
pouerte. Again Chastity.
And as for their third vow chastity: how so ever they done profess and
promise it / they keep it but slenderly / which thing is so euide^te: that it
needs no farther proof. And surely so is it of all the other as you may se and
perceive so openly / that none excuse can be made / wherefore all though it
were a lawful thing to make these vows / yet were it better that none were
made / except they were better kept. natwithstandynge* they that can find no
manner of ground nor auctorite / in all the law of god / old / nor new /
that any such vows were made ne should be made. And finally it is again good
reason / and contrary unto the comune welthe / that such persons should be
suffered to give away / and to forsake their own goods and lands / and tha^
to live in sloth / and mere / and clean ydelnes. These ben the words and
reasons of the heretics.

Now speaks the auctoure unto the reders.
GOod devour reders and herers / I byseche you be not slau^dered ne offended
nor any thing marvel or doubt that I set forth the reasons of the heretics
so plain and extremely for the more stronger and vnassoylable that a reason
does appear in setting forth / the more feeble and of less auctorite is it /
when it is (by the troth) assoyled for (of a surety) these reasons whereby
these heretics as adversaries and enemies of christ / done blaspheme and
detracte holy religion / and so done delude / deceive / and corrupt the simple
minds of many devout persons: done seem very strong as surely founded and
grounded upon the trouthes of scripture / as all heresies ben / but when they
ben tried and well looked upon they ben proved in deed full of falshede for wha^
they have for their ground: and first or chief argument / put a troth of
scripture: than done they subtelly and craftily bring in an other proposition
or sentence / which scoleme^ done call a minore / that is to mean a second
proposition / where upon with the other that went before: they done conclude
and prove / or rather done seem to prove their purpose: and heresy which
second proposition: is evermore an heresy / or vterly false / and that
proposition done / they with out probation or proof / suppose for a troth
which in deed is false / and so done they conclude a falshed or an heresy /
that to the simple and unlearned persons / does seem true and so ben they
blinded and deceived / as you shall euydentely se and perceive i^ the process
that shall follow. Take patience I beseech you for I must need rehearse many
things again that before ben said to make the answer plain unto every
person.

Of the answers after order / unto the reasons of the heretics before written
again religion / and the essenciall vows thereof / and first again their
first reason general. The second. Chapitre.
FIrst you must perceive what thing is their mind and purpose to conclude
and prove as a troth / and to perswage and cause the people to believe the
same. That is: that al religions wherein these vows ben made and professed /
and consequently al manner of vows or bounds of promise / should be contrary
unto the law of Christ and unto the liberte of the same. And to prove this by
/ they done put forth a proposition or sentence / which among scolemen is
called a mayor / that is a chief or principal proposition or sentence put for
a ground of truth / whereby with the second proposition the conclusion may
be proved. And that maiore or chief sentence / is here in their reason / this
in some / that as our lord god the father of heaven: delivered the children of
Israel his chosen people (by the hand of Moses) out of the land of Epipte /
and from the captivity of Pharao So did he (by our lord and savior Jesus)
deliver all christianes from the bondage and thraldom of the dyuell / and out
of the land and realm of sin wherein all mankind was bond and thrale by
the trespass of Adam. So that now by the death of Christ and his other acts
of our salvation / we ben discharged of the cures and rigor of the old law
/ and restored and put unto fredome and unto the liberte of the gospel. This
is now their first proposition which is all true and catholic / well
grounded up on the truth of scripture. But now take good head unto the
minore. Their second proposition where they say / alas alas / with many gay
terms to move the people to believe them / but all they done say of their own
brain / and malicious mind / without any ground or auctorite / and without
any good reason / alas (say they) that we ben overthrown / and have forsaken
the most sweet and pleasant fredome and liberte of the gospel / and ben
come now unto more thraldom and bondage: than ever were the children of
Israel in Egipte / all these words and those that done follow: ben spoken by
their rethorike which is a science / craft / or conning / to persuade their
purpose wheder it be true or false / for in deed they ben very false / which
shall be euidente if you take good head unto these two terms liberte / and
bondage / or fredome and and thraldom / for in these two terms: they done
meruaylously delude / deceive / and begyle their audience / for they done
declare them unto the people after the carnal letter / and common use of the
carnal and unlearned persons / for they done take bondage and thraldom / for a
let or with drawing of the carnal appetite or sensual will and desire / as
when they ben let to do what their bodily will does desire / or when they
ben compelled to do what they would not do / than done they say they ben bond
or in thraldom. And contrary when they may without let or stoppage / without
blame or rebuke / follow their own will and do what it please their sensualite
/ than done they judge they ben at liberte / which thing (in very deed) is
clean contrary / for the liberte of the flesh is most vylayne / thraldom /
and bondage. And the most thraldom and most streyte bond unto the spirit:
is most high fredome and most noble liberte / for the fredome and liberte of
the flesh: is when a person (by the offense of our lord / and by the
transgression and brekynge of his laws) is (in following his own sensualite)
at liberte and lowence from justice and from al virtue / and is (by leude
custom) bond caytyfe unto iniquite / wykydnes / and sin. For saint Paul
says: To. 6.
that a person is bond caytyfe and servant unto that thing: where unto he
does bind him self / wether it be unto syne / the reward whereof: is
everlasting death / or whether it be justice / that is to say: unto the
knotte and congregation of all virtues / the reward where of is everlasting
life. And contrary therefore the liberte of the spirit: is when a person (in
forsakynge all his sensual appetites) of very devotion and zele / to pleace
our lord and to perform and keep his laws / is fre lowce / and (in
conscience) at liberte from all vice and sin / and is bound as of dute unto
Justice and so thrale servant unto virtue / for (as the holy virgin saint
Agath said) The most high fredome and the most noble liberte is that: wherein
the bondage and thraldom of Christ is proved and performed in full effect.
For the auctorite of saint Paul will bear us out herein / where he says unto
the Romans. To. 6.
When you were the servants and bond thrales of sin / than were you fre
from justice / and at liberte from all virtue and goodness. But now that you
ben delivered and void of sin / you ben made the servants and bond thrales
of our lord god and of our savior Jesus Christ. Thus now may we boldly
conclude by auctorite contrary unto their false suppositio^ / that bondage and
thraldom unto the laws of god: and unto the life of our savior Jesus / is the
very fredome: and noble liberte of the spirit. And on the contrary part /
that the fredome of sensualite and the liberte unto the laws of the flesh
and unto sin / is very bondage and most captyfe thraldom. And so now does
follow (both by reason and of auctorite) that the more fast and streitly any
persons done wylfully bind / and make thrale them self (by most solemn
vow / and most sure promise (unto any of the commandments or counsels of
Christ / so much the more ben they in fredome and at liberte in his law and
religion / which (in very deed) is (as they also done call it) a law of love
/ and a law of liberte. For by that love inspired by grace and by that liberty
of Christ's law does every person bind himself. So that he is both the
bond thrale of Christ / and yet fre man and in most joyful liberte of
conscience. And contrary wise the more any person do follow the fredome and
liberte of the flesh the more is he bond caytyfe unto sin. And for a
certeynte: this liberte is the cause and occasion why these heretics done take
the way of malicious error / and frowardenes contrary unto the ordinances and
laws of the church. These sure grounds now well considered: take good head
unto their reylynge reasons / and false feyned supposicions. For now (say
they) we have mo folysshe and supersticious ceremonies than ever had the Iues.
Note here: that these heretics done call the holy ceremonies of the old
testamente / folysshe and supersticious: and yet they can not deney / but that
those ceremonies were ordained by our lord god: as necessary figures of the
new testament / as after you shall here more pleynly when we shall more
specially entreat of ceremonies / yet forther se what they say / we ben (say
they) returned from Christ unto Moses / here done they take Christ: and
thereby signify and mean their leude liberte / or rather unlawful license of
the flesh. And by Moses: they mean the rigor of the old law after the
letter. And from Moses (say they) unto Pharao / by Pharao they done signify
the bondage of religion / all that follows does most directely and straight
frame and fashon unto them self / and not unto us (as by the auctorites before
is euide^te) that is to say: that they (the self heretics) say: lothynge the
Manna and most sweet spiritual meat of the gospel / done take delectacion
and pleasure in the pottes of flesh and potage of Egipte / that is to say: in
the voluptuous appetites and desires of the world and the flesh / and this
done they prove in effect. And so nothing content with the quietude / ease /
and rest of the gospel / they done wylfully give or rather sell and bind the^
self unto the seruitute and thraldom of Egipte that is (as we said) the
world. And unto the intolerable and lost labors / of tyles and brykes / of
clay / mire / and mucke / that is to say unto the vile voluptuous flesshely and
beastely pleasure of the same. And despysynge the sweet and confortable yoke of
the life and gospel of Christ and of the light and easy burden of his
doctrine / and ordinance they done stowpe / bow down / and (more than
wylfully) charge their necks under the roughe / hard / and rigorous yoke not
of the manners of me^ (as they say of us) but of the manners of the dyuell /
that is to say: unto the heavy lode and blockys burden / not (as they say of
us) unto the constitutions / statutes / and ordinances of men / but unto the
temptations / suggestions / and persuagions of the dyuell. This is not said in
any passion: but only in reiection and return of their own word^ unto them

O good lord how folysshe / how mad / and frantyke ben these errante
heretics / what tend / what yuell spirits / what enchauntementes / or
wychecraftes / or what myschefe of the dyuell: has thus bywyched them / that
after the firmite constauncy and confirmacion of all the laws of the church /
by so many counsayles / of so profou^de and learned wisdom ministered by the
holy ghost / and continued so many hou^dreth years that is to say. M.v.
hou^dreth and mo / yet these miserable wreches done sterte / lepe / and flee
therfrom / and dampnably done fall down from the high / town and pleasau^te
palayse of the fredome and liberty of Christ / unto the deep dou^geon and pit
of perdition / of the bondage and thraldom of the dyuell / from right feythe /
unto misbyleue / from hope / unto doubt / from love unto dread from pure
religion / unto apostacy / from Christ / unto machomete / from the gospel of
god / unto the blindness of all condemned heresies. So that now they must
nedely end in the flesh that they bygyne in the spirit. For that
perfection: that in their baptism they entered / promised / and undertook
spiritually / they shall finisshe and end carnally / that they bygane ghostly /
they shall end fendely and dampnably. Thus you may well perceive that we may
conveniently and of true ^routh return and cast justly again unto the^ / the
same things that falsely and maliciously they leyde against (...).

Of answer now unto their false surmysed suppositions. The third chapitre.
THese heretics done suppose and put unto the people for trouthes* that the
law of Christ / is a law of liberte and a law of love. And troth it is
after the true declaracion that we showed before / but not after their false
and subtle mind and meaning. For they done affirm unto the people: that the
law of Chiste is a law of so great love and large liberte that it may be
performed and fulfilled at the liberte and pleasure of the flesh in
following of sensualite / and that is utterly false. Not. 7.
For Christ said (as after you shall here) that the way unto bliss is hard
and streyte / and unto that way is every christian bound by vow and promise
in his baptism. And an other of their false suppositions is: that the law of
religion monastical is a law of thraldom and bondage because of their vow
and promise. And therefore (say they) that vow and promise is performed and
done for fere and dread and not for love. Unto the first we have answered that
the vow and bondage of religion: is most high and most noble liberte and
fredome. And so must nedely follow that to perform that vow and promise for
fere and dread of the offense of our lord is a reverend and holy dread and
the true and very love of his goodness. Psalm. 18.
Yet done these heretics put forth an other false supposition for their
purpose / and upon that supposion / done they bri^ge i^ an other that does
pass the first. The first is (as you have herd in their arguments) that i^
the begi^nynge of Christ's church: all christianes that is to say all manner
of persons that did receive the feythe of Christ: were equal (without
distinction or difference) in like manner and state christianes none above an
other but all as brothers and systers / whether they were high or low /
bound or fre / al were of one calynge the elect and chosen people of god /
holy preesthode / all sacred persons / for to offer spiritual hosts and
sacrefice acceptable (by the mean and merits of our lord and savior Jesus)
unto almighty god. Than was no difference of popes / and priests / freres /
no^nes / and such other as ben now but all manner of christianes / men women /
and children / were priests all in like / but only that women were prohibit
and forboden to preach. All in like degree were the children of god / al his
heirs and coheneritoures unto Christ. This is the first suppositio^ of these
heretics which has deceived much people. For thus would they make the
people to believe / there should be no pope / no bysshopes / no priests / no
religious persons / ne any other degres / because (as they say) all were of
one and like calynge. And certeynly that is truth as unto the state of
christianite and feyth of Christ / but not as unto the degres orders and state
of the perfection of the same christianite. Example.
Take here of example of the natural body of man. Every member of the body is
a very member as well one as an other. The foot is a member of the body as well
as the head / yet natwithstandynge the head is the more excellent / the more
noble / and the more necessary membre / in the foot ben commonly.v. tose and
in the head the instruments of the.v. senses of wits / as the ears for
herynge / the eyes for seeing / the nose tor smellyng / the tongue and palate
for tastinge / and in every of them. the sens and touching. All in like ben
me^bres but not all i^ like degree / of necessite of noblenes and of excellency
/ for every person had lever lack or lose all those.v. members of the foot /
than any one of the other.v. in the head (for they ben more necessary and
pleasant unto the hole body. Application of the example. To. 12..1. Co. 12.
Ephe. 4.
In like manner the mystical body of Christ: is a hole body / and has
diverse and many members / as appears i^ bode the testamentes. For in the old
testamente under the law of Moses / all the children of Israel / the elect
and chosen people of god: were all of one election / of one calynge / unto that
law of their salvation. But yet were they not of one degree of state and
noblenes of perfection in that law / but much diverse in the election / and
calynge of that perfection. For some of them were clear and holy / spiritual
persons: by very election and calinge of god / as the tribe of leuy and some
were mere and clean temporal persons: as all the other tribes. And yet among
the spiritual part were diverse degres and states / as prophets / priests /
diacones and other ministres of the sai^ctuary. Moses was the chief and
principal prophet. Aaron the pri^cipal priest / and under the^ other diverse.
Likewise in the temporal part were princes and capitaynes of diverse degres.
In heaven ben diverse degres and orders of Angels. And how than may it frame
or be like unto truth / that these false heretics done afferme that al was
one / and all should be one / and none above an other / in the people of the
new testamente: it must need be false. The very self gospel will prove them
false / for there does appear that our savior Jesus Christ the auctoure of
the new testamente / in choosing and gadrynge of his people and unto the
foundation and continuance of his church / did use the same manner and put
like form in degrees and orders in his new testamente / as before was in the
old / or rather as was and is in heaven. For at his first election and
choosing of his disciples as a fou^dacion and beginning of his church: he
ordained some spiritual persons and some seculer / and so did continue with
them unto his death and yet after his resurrexion: unto his ascencion. In the
spiritual part: were the apostles in nombre only.xii. and among them Petre
was prince and chief person. In the second order: were only.lxxii. And two
disciples of the third part: that was the seculer part / was Nicodeme and
Iosephe Abaramathie / and many other men and women. And yet all were of one
election / of one calynge / as unto the state of christianite and unto the
liberte of the gospel but not unto the perfection thereof. For in that were
many different degres as we have showed. And saint Paul does so declare unto
the Cori^thes and in other places where he says that as i^ the natural body
ben many me^bres that have not all one use or office / but eueryche after his
kind does occupy his one rowme / and eueriche (at need) ready with all
diligence to serve and help other..2. Cor. 12. To. 12. Ephe. 4.
So is it in the mystical body of Christ / wherein he has ordained some
persons to be as Prophets / some Apostles / some Evangelists / and so forth
of other degres and orders of the church of Christ / whereby does openly
appear that their supposition is a false heresy where they say that in the
beginning of the church of Christ / all persons were of one degree and so
forth as you have herd. For among all manner of nations and feythes the
priests have always ben divided from the ley people / and among all the
questions and disputacions that ever were made of the feythe / that matter was
never moved ne yet any heretics that ever were before these had ever any such
opinion / but always kept the difference between priests and ley folk / so
than is their supposition false. And yet upon this suppositio^ now done they
bring in an other as false / whereby they would conclude their purpose / Where
they say: all is turned clean contrary (they mean unto their supposition)
For some persons ben the children of saint Augustyne some the sons and
daughters of saint Benedicte caled saint Benete / some of saint Franciske /
some of saint Bernard some of saint Dominike / and so forth of many other
patrons that now instead of the chylder^ of god ben changed unto the
children of men. And that instead or the laws of Christ: done keep the laws
of men. And so have forsaken the gospel of god / which (as we said before) is
a law of love and of liberte. And have bound them self and that by solemn
vow / unto the rules and laws of these men / which ben laws of fere and
dread laws of thraldom and bondage. Here done these heretics suppose a great
error and much perilous / which is: that the laws constitutions and
ordinance of man been contrary unto the laws of god / and so done they not
only destroy the rules of religion: but also the laws of the church / and
of all temporal princes as though they might not stand with the law of god
/ but that every person byndynge him self unto any law of man / should
first forsake the law of god. How false and erroneous that is: your own
reason may determyne (...) (and yet somewhat shall we answer there unto for
our part. And where after in their said supposition / they say: that where
all religious persons / before the making of their vow and profession / were
louse at liberte and in their own power and so might have kept the law of
the gospel all by love in fredome / liberte / and gladness of heart and mind /
and now (after their profession) done not so but rather done they keep now
their rules for fere and dread in thraldom and bondage / because of their vow
/ and with much murmr and grouge / and with an yuell will / ergo all their
vows and promyses ben naught unto this I say: that I have before declared
unto you by auctorite of scripture / how falsely and deceytfully they done
abuse and mysuse the terms of liberte and fredome / and of thraldom and
bondage / and therefore I say that to keep those rules or to any good deed with
the murmr and grouge and with the yuell will of the flesshhe / is the noble
triumph and joyful gladness of the spirit. Ma. 11.
Quia regnum celorum vim patitur. The religion of christ does require
violence punisshemente / and constreynte of the flesh. Saint Paul says: 1.
Cor. 9.
Castigo corpus meum, et in seruitutem redigo. I do (says he) chastise my body
/ and bring it unto bondage and thraldom. And therefore as the bondage and
thraldom of the flesh: is most high liberte and fredome (as we have
proved) so to parfourme the said rules in the fere and reverend dread of the
offense of our savior is (as I said before) very love and high charity. And
where they say that the religious persons by reason they done promise and
undertake to keep the holy rules of saint Augustyn saint Benet / saint
Franciske. etc. they done thereby leave and forsake the law of the gospel / and
that they should not be the children of god because they ben the children of
these holy patrons. This saying of the heretics has another truth ne any
semynge reason of truth / for so should follow that no person might both be
the child of man and the child of god / which does directly conclude that
Christ was not the child of man and of god both / and that (as I said) no
person might keep both the law of god and the law of man. How false now
and how folysshe their reason is herein you may lyghtely perceive / we say
therefore much contrary unto them that every person that most verily and
truly is the child of saint Augustine / saint Benet / or of any such other
holy patron / is thereby the more perfectly and more derely byloued child of
our lord god / and savior Jesus. And all those persons that done precisely
keep the rules and ordinances of those holy patrons and saints / done thereby
more perfectely and more very christianely keep the laws of the gospel / and
the commandments and counsayles of Christ / for in all the rules or
constitutions of those holy patrons / is no sentence nor yet one word that
does sown contrary unto the said ordinance of Christ. But that rather does
meruaylously much conduce / help / and avail / unto the precise and perfect
obseruaunce and perfourmynge of the same. Yet forther to move the people again
religion / they say the religious persons done not keep their said rules unto
this we shall answer forther here after but now I say that if they do mean
that all religious persons done not keep their rules / that must need be true
/ specially of such as they ben apostates and to say truth no law is kept
of all persons ne ever was if they would mean that no religious done keep
their rules / that saying has none euidente proof ne reason of truth / for
the contrary does seem troth by evident tokens / and that now in our time /
for in the new found land that is called new spain / ben many and diverse
miracles done by religious persons. The reverend fathers obseruauntes of
saint Franciskes order done daily preach there / and done win much people
unto the feythe of Christ / so that one of those holy minores did co^uerte and
baptize in one day.M. and.ix. houndreth persons. And eueryche of them done
take unto their cure and labor children to teach and specially the children
of the great states and rulers which children (when they have learned the
feythe of Christ) done (with merueylous fervor) preach i^ manner and show
unto the people the same feythe as they learned of their teachers / the said
freres minores. And the people diligentely done here and give credence unto the
children / because they ben inspired / inflamed / and kindled with the spirit
of god the holy ghost / among which children the sweet and lovely child
Jesus: was seen and perceived in a garmente of white color / and among them
taught the people. And when many days he had so done / the people perceived
and knew well it was Jesus / and came unto him to do due honor and reverence
unto him. And therewith suddenly he vanesshed and was no more seen. An other
time two women were taking to gether of the new feythe of Christ (for unto
them it was new) and one of them could by no means learn her Pater noster ne
any part thereof not so much as these two words pater noster / and yet she
labored much and was sore troubled therewith / unto whom our blessed lady
saint Mary suddenly appeared and taught her / not only the Pater noster: but
also all manner of things that were necessary unto Christ's feyth / These
miracles could not have been done by those religious fathers except they had
kept their rules and pleased god.vi. of them were their broyled or roasted for
the feyth of Christ / did none of the^ (think you) keep thyr rules? I believe
they did. Than can it not be true that no religious persons done keep their
rules. If they would say that some religious persons done keep the rules /
but the most part done not I can not answer there unto / for I am not sure
how many done and how many done not my matter here is another to accuse any
persons / nor yet to excuse the mysdoers what so ever they be / my matter is to
approve the state of religious persons as after you shall here /
natwithstandynge these heretics upon these false and such other suppositions:
done conclude unto the people that al religion is naught / and unlawful will
you here their argument again in a short and conpendious manner. This is it:
As the people of Israel were delivered by Moses out of the bondage of Pharao.
So the people of the new law of the gospel were delivered by Christ from
the bondage of the dyuell and put unto most high fredome and liberte. But who
so ever does make any solemn vow / does make himself bond again and so
does forsake and lose that liberte / and do contrary unto the (law of the
gospel / the law of liberte ergo religious persons done contrary unto the
gospel wherefore all religion is unlawful. And to approve this conclusion /
they done bring in four assercions and reasons / which they done enforce and

Of answer unto the co^clusions of the heretics and unto their assercions and
reasons there upon. The fourth Chapitre.
Their first assercion and affirmacion is / that to make these vows is a
thing of great folysshenes. They prove it thus: what can be more folly and
madness than to seek / obtain / get / or win a thing with pain woe / and
labor / in great fere and dread / and under thraldom and bondage / that may
be had lightly and with pleasure and ease / i^ love and surety / under fredome
and liberte. But the law of the gospel: the religion of Christ / is (as we
have said) a law of love and liberte / a law of fredome and sufficient mean
of it self / whereby every christian may obtain and have sure salvation /
ergo to make any mo vows / to follow any other rules / to make any promise
unto any mo religions / is a great folly / and mere madness. Specially sithe more
merit and more reward and thank: shall be unto them that done a good deed with
good and of the fre election and liberte of their own heart and mind / than
to be compelled there unto / by thraldom and bondage / again their heart and
mind / and contrary unto their will. As by example / let in case a person be
present that Example.
were in necessite and need / and should fall i^ to great danger except he had
help / if than a person of his own good will / and of his own propre goods
and labors / would help that need person / and releue his need / were not
he (in reason) more worthy thank / than an other person that were dettoure
unto that need person / and were compelled by reason of his obligacion and
bond of the said debt again his mind and will to help this said need? yes
douteles no man can deney it / but so is it of them that done promise these
religions / ergo (as we said) it is a thing of great folly and mere madness.
Answer unto this first reason.
Now I pray you here one answer there unto / and first that you remember
what we proved by scripture to be very / and true fredome and liberte / that is
to say / the bondage and thraldom of Christ or unto Christ's law / and
contrary that the fredome and liberte of the flesh which they speak of: is
the very bondage and thraldom of sin / or unto the dyuell. Now wha^ they
say in their said argument: it is a folly to get with pain / that may be had
with pleasure. Here done they presuppose a false heresy / and put it forth as
a truth / that is: that the law of the gospel the life of Christ: may be
performed lyghtely with ease / rest / and pleasure of the body / and in the
fredome and liberte of the flesh / which is plainly false / as does appear
in the gospel. Arcta est via quae ducit ad vitam. Math. 7. B. Io. 14. A.
zc. The way that ledethe unto life (says the gospel) is hard and strayte.
And Christ said also. Ego sum via. I am (says he) the self way. And he
would not enter into bliss him self: but by the way of pain and penance /
and not of joy and pleasure / by the way of labor and travail / and not of
ease and rest. And so he ordered his holy Apostles and all that would be his
disciples saying. Mar. 8. Luce. 9. Luce. 14.
Qui non tollit crucem suam, et se quitur me, no^ potest meus esse discipulus.
etc. Who will not take their own cross and follow me: can not or may not be
my disciples. Every person has his own cross that is to say: such pain
/ penance / and labors / as the nature of the person may conuenientely bear
/ according unto the condition and state of the same person. The new law
therefore is a law of liberte and pleasure / because it does render man fre
and louse from all sin / and from the pain thereof and gives grace the most
high pleasure of the spirit / but not as they mean and suppose. For in very
deed as unto the perfourmaunce of the perfection thereof the law of ye gospel
is more hard and streyte / tha^ ye old law was. For in the old law (by the
testimony of Christ) our lord bade and commanded his people to love their
freudes. Leuit..19. C.
And to have their enymyes in hatered. But Christ said: I command you yt you
love your enemies. The old law says. Luce. 6. Exo. 20. C.
Non mechaberis. Thou shall not abuse or mysuse the act of thy flesh. But I
tell you (says our savior) who so looks upon any frail person that is to
say a man upon the woman or contrary with the full consent of concupisence /
has thereby yuen than offended in heart and soul / with the same person i^
like degree and manner of the act. In the old law is said. Mat. 5. D.
Non occides. Thou shall kyl or slay no person. Exo. 20. C. Deu. 5. B. Mat. 5.
But the gospel does forbede us to be wroth or angrye in our hertes / again
our even christianes or to call any person fool or dawe / or yet to revenge
our self by any roughe or vncourteise words / or wysshe / or will any hurt to
any person / or to have any stomach of hatered unto any person. Qui odit
fratre^ suu^, 1. Io. 3. C.
homici da est. Who so ever (says saint Johan) does hate his brother is an
homicide or ma^lleer. Now let the^ reken and you good devout reders be yuen
iuges / whether of these two laws is more hard to keep. The old law (say
they) was a law of dred and of sorrow and care / and we ben (say they)
delivered therfrom / by ye law of love / which we may fulfill say they without
care / and with gladness of heart and mind. And I say: the old law was a law
of carnal dread / and punissheme^te of the body / and ye new law: is a law
of spiritual dread / and fere of ye punissheme^t of ye soul and body And it is
a law of love / and most deep love because it must be accomplesshed not by
the carnal love yt they done mean: but by very charity that is spiritual
love / that is never with out fere and holy dread and does most care and take
deep thought to please our lord by the workynge of his will and keeping his
precepts. Gregorius
For the proof and evidence of love: is the showing and setting forth of the
works or deeds: whereof our savior says in the gospel: Who so does here or
harken / and bear away my words / and does perform and work them indede /
that same is the person that loves me. Lu. 6. G. Io. 14. B.
And again: Io. 14. D.
That person: that loves me / will keep my byddynges and commandments.
Than (by good reason) he that loves god / must nedely care and give diligence
by good works to approve that love. and how may they affirm that the law
of the gospel can be performed without dread. Wha^ they here our savior say
that of every word that is not fruytfull: Mat. 12. C.
shall we render and make account and rekeninge at the day of iugeme^te. And
again That a Camel a great beast may pass more lightly through the eye or
hole of a nedell: Mat. 10. C.
than a rich couetouse man may enter into heaven. And the wife man also says
that the ground and beginning of wisdom: Ecl. 1. B.
is the dred of our lord. And the holy dread of him (says the Psalter) does
remain / bide / and last for evermore. Psalm. 18.
Thus appears that the law of the gospel must be kept as well with dread as
love / and with care / thought / and diligence / unto the which things does
religion most avail. They say the religion of Christ received in baptism:
is sufficient unto all christianes for their salvation without any other / ergo
these other religions ben void The very gospel will reprove and condemn
this argument. For all though that the religion of Christ be sufficient /
yet did Christ him self beyond and above that sufficiency / persuade / move
/ and counsel / more high perfection as in the gospel of Mathewe: Mat. 19. C
when a young man axed of him what he might do to be sure of his salvation / he
answered that to keep the commandments of the law precisely: should be
sufficient there unto but if thou wylt (said he) attain / or approach unto
forther perfection: thou must do more / as there is contained. So than
follows by the conclusion of Christ / that in the law and religion of the
gospel ben degrees of perfection. Some of necessite as commandments. And
some of special merits at liberte as counsayles. Hereof does follow that the
religion of Christ (as they say) is sufficient unto all christianes generally.
But (I say) that is except they have no forther mocion unto forther
perfection. But if any be specially called: by the spirit of god unto any of
the counsayles of perfection / tha^ (say I) if that person will forsake that
calynge: the general religion of Christ is not sufficient for that person so
caled / which thing we shall more plainly declare here after /
natwithstandynge this place of the gospel does sufficiently approve the same
by the words of Christ. Now devout christianes / be you yuen iuges whether
it be a thing of folly and folysshenes / or rather a thing of wisdom and
prudence / to follow / apply / and consent unto the special counsayles / and
spiritual calynges of our lord and savior Jesus / which thing (for a
surety) he does of special grace / for the singular charity / and love that
he has unto them that he would should deserve singular merit and reward / I
trow no feythfull christian will say / it were a folly to follow the counsel
of any wise man / much more of Christ him self the self esse^cial wisdom
of god. But they say it is a folly to take any mo or any other religions: tha^
ye religion of Christ. Here done they craftily presuppose unto the people /
that our religion monastical: is an other religion differente from ye religion
of Christ. And we done not say so / but yt rather all is one. For there is no
religion properly but one the self religion of Christ. And al our religions
monastical: ben degrees or states of perfection in the same religion. For in
religion monastical: is ye religion of Christ most surely and most
precisely kept / and yt I mean for the states and degrees of persons / and
not for ye singular persons. For some one person or persons out of religion
monastical: may keep ye religion of Christ as perfectely and precisely: as
any person within the same / but co^munely to speak of the state or form of
leuynge / as of sauldiours / courtiours / merchants / men of law /
artificers / housbondes / laborers / with such other married persons / or
sole and synguler persons. And in ye spiritual part parsons / vicares /
priests / colleges / and cathedral churches / with such other co^gregacio^s or
fraternites / co^parynge these states of lives / unto the religious monastical
/ I dare well say ye religion of Christ (after the form and manner of his
life and of his apostles) is better and more perfectly and precisely kept in
religion monastical: than in any of the other states. And yet (I say) all ben
of one religion / all breders and systers al disciples of the rule and religion
of Christ / and al members of the mystical body of Christ. Monastical
religion: is any of those religions and orders that done profess the
esse^siall vows after any rule autentyke or of auctorite and by the
confirmacion of the pope is incorporate in the law yet say they forther that
to do a good deed of fre will and liberty of mind: is more merit and more
worthy thank or reward: than to do it of bond and duty. Here unto we shall
use their own example / and so take them in their own snare / and slay them
with their own sword / or hang them in their own halter. Let in case two
need / persons be presented before you. And other two pituous persons /
wyllyng of very charity to releue and help their penury and need. The one
person does (of fre will without any bond or duty (give unto the one need
person / every day two pens. The other does wylfully (all though of devotion
and charity) bind him self: by writynge and seal to give unto the other need
person a yearly rent / fee / or annuite of two pens a day during his life.
Now judge you which of this tweyne is worthy more reward or thank. How be
it the case would be more direct and frame better unto purpose if it were put
in two persons to do service: the one to do service of free will and
liberality: and the other to bind him self wylfully there unto. And yet every
where the bynder is more worthy thank / not so much (peradventure) for the
service: as for the wylfull bond there unto natwithstandinge they done here
presuppose a thing contrary unto the gospel / that is that a person may do
a good deed in his life / where unto he were not bound. Sith our savior
says. Wha^ you have done all that you can: Lu. 17. C.
yet may you say you ben but bound servants unprofitable because you have
done that was your duty and bond and no more. Thus now done we conclude
contrary unto their false assercio^ that to make these vows in monastical
religion is not (as they say) a thing of folly and folyshnes / but rather a
thing of great wisdom / prudence / and policy.

Answer unto the second assercion and affirmacion.

(...) heretics and the proof thereof. The fyfte Chapitre.
Their second assercion and reason / is that to make and promise these said
vows is a thing of great boldenes and meruaylous presumpcion. And this done
they inforse to prove again al.iii. vows by order and first of obedience.
Again obedience.
They say it is a presumpcion and a temptacion or provocation against god
rather than a trust in him / that a person having wit and reason should (at
venture) put him self soul and body subject unto an other person that he
knows not Unto this: let the Apostles and disciples of Christ answer. For
here done they condemn them of presumpcion / temptacion / and prouocacion of
god / because they forthwith at the first calynge did put them subject unto
him / whom before they never knew ne saw / unto this will they answer /
saying: that before they continued in that subjection / they did se euide^te of
his miracles that might reasonably move them there unto. So did Pharao (say I)
se as great miracles by Moses / and gave (for all that) no credence there
unto. But yet will they say again there was in the Apostles and disciples an
inward workynge of the spirit of god bysyde that outward calinge (so say I)
there is i^ every person ryghtly caled unto religion. 1. Io. 4. A.
And therefore saint Johan would that every person should prove that calynge
whether it were of the spirit of god or not / for that spirit does search
and prove all things. 1. Cor. 2.
And therefore the church has ordained by the common law: that every
person that would make profession i^ any of the foresaid rules: should before
their enter and full profession / have a year of probacion. Whereby that
appears plainly false / that they done presuppose that is: that religious
persons done put them self subject without any knowelege of the souereynes.
For that year is appointed indifferente for both the parties each to know
other yet say they: it is a folly to be subject unto a fool / and no wisdom to
be at the rule and ordinance of a vicious person. 1. Pe. 2. C. Phi. 6. Hebre.
13.
Here unto the Apostles Peter and Paul done answer willing and commau^dynge
that their disciples should be obediente unto their souereynes / not only
those that were good and virtuous: but also unto them that were visious. And
Christ him self in the gospel commanded we should do what the prelates done
bid or command all though we should not do always as they done. Math. 23..A.
And he him self (I say our savior) was wylfully subdued i^ body unto the
members of the dyuel: Pilate and Herod Annas and Cayphas / and such other /
and yet I may say forther unto the dyuell him self. Math. 4. Mar. 1. Luc. 3.
Thus now does their sainge appear openly false. Where they say it is a
presu^pcion / temptacion / and prouocacion of god to make obedience unto man.
And our saying is true / it is a profounde and meruaylous mekenes / that very
much moves our lord to mercy. Of wylfull pouerte.
The same falshede done they enforce again wylfull pouerte. Saying it is a
presumpcion for any person to forsake the goods of the world so clearly and
utterly ye nothing they may retain unto their own need what case so ever
hap or fall. etc. Unto this we shall more largely answer in the entretynge
of that vow. Now for this time we shall let our savior Christ answer for
him self. For he was of this presumpcion as he said. Filius hominis non habet
vbi caput suum reclinet. Math. 8. C
The sone of the virgin (said he) has not (as they say) an hole to hyd his
head in. Here unto they will say he was god / he might sone provide for him
self at will / yet say I: he spoke these words unto a person that would have
followed him for suerty of living. And also his Apostles were no gods / and
yet following his example: they were of the same presumpcion / if this may be
caled presu^pcion: and so did they teach their disciples to live all in
common without propriety or surety of living. And the first persons that
(by their propriety) brake that ordinance: Act. 5. A.
did peryshe. As does appear in the acts of the same Apostles. And thus you
may well perceive their sayng contrary unto scripture is false / it is
therefore no presumpcion to do as Christ did and his Apostles / but rather is
it an evident proof of the mekenes which he expressed and bade us follow the
same lesson saying. Math. 11. D.
Discite a me quia mitis sum et humilis cord. Learn you of me (says he) for
I am mylde and meke of heart / yet done they labor to prove the same of
chastity. Saying it is presumpcion above all presumpcions that a mortal
person living here in the frail flesh should entreprise promise / and
undertake / to live without the flesh which is rather the life of Angel
than of man. For the act of generation: Philosophus.
is a natural act and the most natural act without which the world might
not be continued. The proverb also must be true. Hard it is to remove out of
the flesh that is bredde in the bone. And saint Paul says: 1. Cor. 7. B
better is for any person to be married than to bre^ne by the flame of the
flesh. Unto this reason (as we said of the other) shall we answer at large
in the process of chastity / but somewhat to say breuely: they done herein as
they did of the other that is condemn Christ himself / our blessed lady his
mother and all his Apostles of that presumpcion. Blessed Mary his mother did
bind her self by vow and promise unto chastity. Saying unto the Angel: as
is in the gospel. Luce. 2.
Quoniam vitum non cognosco. I have (said she) fully determined never to have
the carnal knowelege of man. And Christ did keep chastity in most excellent
manner and both caled and counsayled other persons there unto. Ieronimus i^
prologo super Ioannem.
Saint Johan he caled when he was in will and purpose to be married and both he
and the other Apostles (by the mocion of Christ) did bind the^ self unto
chastity / as here after we shall prove / yet done they here after their
custom: presuppose a false ground / that is: yt a person may not bring ye
flesh in bondage and thrale unto the spirit because of the natural
disposicion and rebellion of sensualite which saint Paul does contrary and
prove false. Saying I do (says he) chastise and correct my body and bring
my flesh / thrale and subject unto the spirit. 1. Cor. 9. D
And so he wylled and desired that al persons should be virgins as he was.
Here also done they presuppose an other falshede ye religious persons done
promise and make the vow of chastity without due probacion of them self. And
if a person perceive (by due proof) that he does so brenne and is continually
so inflamed: that he may not conveniently keep chastity: he should not take it
upon him / but rather (after the saying af saint Paul: 1. Cor. 7. B
which they spoke of) should they marie than brenne. To promise therefore
chastity after the due form of religion: is no presumpcion / but rather a
perfection and following or fulfyllynge of Christ's cou^sayll and example.

Of the answer unto their third assercion and reason. The.vi. Chapitre.
Their third reason is: that to promise these vows is sure dampnacion.

They enforce to prove the same thus / it is contrary unto the ordinance of
god and nature say they: because ye god made man so that naturally he should
have in his own power the fredome and liberty of will. For our lord said unto
Caym. Gene. 4.
Thine appetite and passion shall be under thy self / and in the fre liberte of
thy will / and thou shalt be lord and have the governance thereof. For by the
liberty of will as well as by reason understanding and memory / man is the
very image of god / but by the promise of this: man does make thrale and bond
/ that god made fre and ad liberte. And so does he (in as much as liethe in
him) forsake that similitude and lykenes of god / and does deprive himself
thereof / and wylfully does leave / or rather lose that / Ergo thus to promise
and make vows is a thing or sure and certain dampnation. This is their
argument and reason. Unto the which I say: that they make a fallax and a
deceytfull argument in the mysuse of these terms (as before is said) fredome
or liberty / and thraldom or bondage. For by these vows and promyses: does
no person make hi^ self bond / but rather does put him self in more
liberty and fredome. For (as we proved before) the bondage of Christ: is the
most fre and most noble liberte yt can be / which is proved by our lord god
him self For where he is not only of the most hygh^ and most noble liberty
and fredome of will: but also the self essenciall liberty and fredome of will
/ yet natwithstandinge would he (of his gracious goodness) make himself bond
by promise and oath unto man / as is euidente in many places of both the
testamentes. And yet did that bond nothing let his liberty of will. So in us
all though the will of the flesh be (sometime) contrarious unto our holy
promise / yet is the will of the spirit at more liberty thereby: as oftymes we
have showed before Wherefore to make these vows: is not as they say a sure
dampnation but rather a great and most sure surety of our salvation. And this
unto their theyrde prove.

Answer unto their fourth assercion and reason. The.vii. Chapitre
Their fourth reason is: that to make these vows must needs be a great
ieopardy and peril of dampnacion And scripture says. Eccle. ^. D
who so loves peril: shall lightly fall therinto / but all religious persons
done wylfully undertake / and put themself unto that peril or ieopardy / Ergo
they be most like to fall therein. That such enterprise and vow is of such
peril and ieopardy: Anmonitione. 15.
their own auctours done testify. Cesarius one of them says / that as
religion observed and kept: is of most high merit / so neglecte broken and
not kept is it of most deep dampnation. But all the world may se and
perceive (say they) that religion is not kept / Ergo is it (as is said) of
sure or (at the least) great peril and ieopardy of dampnacion. To prove that
religion is not kept: they done make process again all.iii. vows by order.
Now to make full answer / first we grant and done assente unto their
auctorities as well of the wise man as of the holy father Cesarie / that is:
that religion kept is most high merit / and contrary / not kept of most
deep dampnacion. But yet does not follow that they done suppose / that is:
that the religious persons ben in more ieopardy or peril of dampnacio^ than
the other persons that never made such promise / all though in deed they
been worthy more pain and punisshement if they break their promise / will you
se a pleyne example hereof. Example.
Every king and prince has subjects / some common people / and some more
nere about him that been more streytely sworn and bound to mo secrets and
greatter charges / and therefore ben they more in favor and have more large
fees and rewards than have the common people / if than these persons so
specially favored: would break their promise and oath and be traytoures or
otherwise false unto their sovereign: good reason would they should have more
sharp judgment and more grievous pains or correction / tha^ the common
people should have: for like defaulte or trespase. And yet natwithstandynge
they ben not in more ieopardy and peril of that punisshemente ne of the cause
thereof: than been the co^: mune people that made not so deep promise. But
rather ben they in much less ieopardy and peril / because they have less
occasion to be false and more cause to be true and faithful. So do I conclude
for religion contrary unto them / that religious persons been in less
ieopardy and more out of peril than any other persons / which thing shall
appear more euidentely here after. But where they lay unto our charge that we
done not keep the rules and the promise of our profession / if they mean
universally that all done not keep them it is true / if they say none do keep
them: that is false. I can not deney but that monastical religion is sore
dekeyde and does daily so continue / I am sorry therefore. Show us (say they)
one monastery where the promise of their profession is performed. I can show
diverse of the reverend father of the obseruauntes / the charterhouses / with
other. And I might say in true conscience: I have known many monasteries
that have been noted of great negligence in keeping of their rules / and yet i^
the same places were some that always kept right well both their rule and
constitutions. But mine institucion and purpose here: is not to excuse the
misdoers and brekers of of religion. For their yuell deeds done prove no
defaulte in the state and manner of living of religion.

Of answer unto their final conclusion The.viii. Chapitre.
YEt say they we se so many of those brekers and so few of the kepers / that
we think: better were to have no such sects but al one rule and religion of
Christ Oh Jesus bone. Oh good lord / how wise done these persons think them
self? I shall now make unto them a like reason. In the world be many nations
of people / and all of the creacion of god and yet ben they of diverse sects /
of diverse religions / of diverse feithtes / and byleues / as Iues sarasynes /
turks / and christianes / we ben i^ certeinte none shall be saved: but only
christianes / and though in case some of them might be saved / yet may we be
sure: none shall have so great / and high reward ne any of them ben so sure
of salvation as the christian people if they keep the laws of Christ / and
ye promise and profession made in baptism. But if (contrary) they done not
keep the same: they shall (without doubt) more depely be dampened than other the
Iues / sarasynes / turks / or any other infideles ergo after these heretics
the christianes ben more in peril and ieopardy than ben the infideles. And
also truth it is (no man can deney) that few few and verey few christianes
done keep the religion of Christ and the turks and infideles done better keep
their laws than we ours / ergo (after their reason) better were for us to leave
and forsake our christianity / and be turks and infideles. But unto this (I
believe) good devout reders you will not grant / Ergo their like reason of our
religion is right naught. Sithe tha^ i^ very troth al though not to be said
without great sorrow) christianity is greatly dekeyde / and religion much
dekeyde it were (in my mind) more myte and more convenient for them and for
all feythfull christianes: to pray for both / and to give study and diligence
(eueryche after their power) rather to refourme and amend both / than thus to
blaspheme / detracte / deprave / and to speak yuell of any of them / where they
say it is again reason and contrary unto the common welthe / that such
persons should be suffered to give away / depart / and forsake their own
goods / and lands / and than to live in slouthe and mere ydelnes upon other
folks goods here done they presuppose (as their custom is) a great falshede
/ that is: that al religious persons done live in slouthe and ydelnes where
(in true truth) no persons of this world been more continually occupied in
holy and most profitable occupacions for the common welthe as in the legendes
of the Apostles and other holy saints does openly appear. And also here done
they presu^ptuously blaspheme and reprove our savior Christ his blessed
mother and his holy Apostles and disciples. For Christ did forsake not only
what he had but also what so ever he might have had i^ propriety. And lived
upon such goods as were brought i^ and put in common whereof Judas bare the
purse / and had the custody and ministracion. Matthew. 18. C. Io. 12. A. et. 13.
C. Ibidem. Luce. 8. A.
And also certain women (says the gospel) did follow him and ministre unto
him of their goods and substance. And (as I said before) Christ gave
counsel unto a young man that was very rich: to sell all his substance /
and to depart and give all his goods unto the poor / and so all naked bare
and void of worldly goods to follow him / and to live upon the goods of
other persons. Act. 4. and 5.
Our blessed lady also and and his holy Apostles after they had the holy ghost
did all live after the same manner al i^ common without any thing propre / and
unto this time some persons (after their example) have always so continued.
What reasonable christian will believe yt our savior Christ would do any thing
or counsel any thing to be done yt were again reason (or as these
blasphemers done say) contrary unto the common wealth? I dare well say: none
will so think or suspecte / but only these heretics. For it should be also
contrary unto ye promise of Christ that ye holy ghost should suffer the^ to
do any thing contrary unto ye common wealth since they were illumined with his
grace / and so sent forth for the edificacion and increace of the common
welthe. Thus now may you se / and clearly perceive their reasons ben of no
valor ne strength / but yt in all things: they done delude and deceive the
good si^ple christianes. And yet done they add one proposicion unto their
conclusions / which is this.

Of answer unto their last conclusion: and to opproue these said vows /
first by the auctorite of the auctours. The ix. Chapitre.
TO fortify and make strong their conclusions: they say that no ground or
auctorite can be found in scripture / nor in all the law of god / old or
new / yt any such vows were made / or should be made. Here may you perceive
first that none other auctorite will serve them / ne any other will they admit
/ but only scripture / which is an open peruersitie and a sign or token of an
heresy. For a good feythfull christian: will believe the auctorite and use of
the catholyke church and the determinacions thereof without any forther
auctorite. It were sufficient for them to believe the legende that is read in
the church of ye holy Apostle saint Matthewe / that did consecrate holy vigins
which were obediente unto him. Legenda. Matthew.
And lived all in common as he did. This auctorite is no small thing. The
auctorite also of saint Denisenise the holy martyr that was disciple unto
saint Paul / should be had in reverence and of due and certain crevence /
that in his book of the Hierarsie ecclesiastike: Dionisius.
does show of diverse orders and degrees of religious persons that were in
the time of the Apostles / and that took their orders and religion of them. The
co^stitutions / decrees / and ordinances of ye church should unto every
christian: be auctorite of infallible and vndeceyuable truth by this article
of our feith. Credo ecclesia^ catholica^. I believe ye catholyke church / and
give feyth and crede^ce thereunto. But these persons been so precise / and
perverse / and obstinate in their opinions: that none auctorite will content
them / but only the self text of holy scripture / we shall therefore enforce /
take in hand and ieoparde wage battle with them to contre and mete with them
i^ their own field and to fight with them with their own wepen. I byseche you
devout reders: be equal and yuen iuges.

The prove and surety of the vows by holy scripture / and first of obedience
and wylfull pouerte. The x. Chapitre.
THat obedience has ground and bygynnynge of the ordinance and
commandment of god / holy scripture does testify in the first book of al
scripture caled Genesis. where evidently does appear: that the first and
principal commandment that ever god gave was of obedience. Saying unto Adam
and Eve. De omni ligno paradisi comede. etc. Feed you or eat of the fruytes of
all the trees in paradyse / except only this tree that standethe in the mydle
of paradyse / for what so ever day you do eat thereof: Gene. 2.
you shall dye / that is to say: you shall be subdued unto the pain of death /
where now you be in power to live for evermore without pain and never to
suffer death ne disease. So that obedience only was the way and mean of
everlasting life / and inobedience or disobedience the cause of sin and
death. And therefore after his disobedience nothing might restore man unto ye
state he was in before: but only obedience. Saint Paul unto auctorite. To. 5.
Sicut per inobedienciam vnius hominis. etc. As by the inobedience or
disobedience of one man: many me^ were made si^ners / so by the obedience of
one man again: many me^ shall be made just persons / and apt unto salvation:
that is to mean by the obedience of our lord and savior Jesus / that was
rendered obedient unto death and that deith most shameful the death of the
cross. Phil. 2. B.
But this obedience whereof we shall entreat / is a very branch of that
obedience (as we have showed and shall more largely prove) Ergo obedience is
grounded and founded in scripture in both the testamentes. Yet forther after
the fall of man / in the law of nature: man was conserved from everlasting
dampnacion only by obedience / and put unto everlasting death by disobedience
/ as is evident of Caym and Abell / and i^ many other places of the scripture.
Gene. 4.
In the law written that was the law of Moses caled the old law / obedience
was chief maystres and ruler. And in the law of the gospel: obedience is
expressed and set forth as the very troth before figured. Thus appears that
obedience is statuted by the auctorite of scripture. Of wylfull pouerte.
Now for wylfull pouerte. In paradyse was no propriety. And in the law of
nature: all things were common. The law written did command that no person
should be nedy among the people of god / but that eueriche should ministre /
and do conforte and help unto other according unto their need. Deu. 15.
And in the new law our savior him self: is chief example of wylfull
pouerte. For he said of him self. Math. 8. C
The sone of man has not where to hyd his head / and take rest in. That is to
say: he had nothing in this world in propriety / but did show openly and
set forth the very precise and true perfection of wylfull pouerte. And his
holy Apostles (after his example) did follow the same and so gave order unto
their disciples / which was of long time observed and kept in the primitive
and first begynni^ge of ye church of Christ / which now all religious
persons done ensue and follow / Ergo wylful pouerte is founded upon holy
scripture.

How the vow of chastity: is statuted and founded by holy scripture / and of
the approbacion of all.iii. vows by reason. The.xi. Chapitre.
Chastity in the law of innocence: was excellent and honorable which thing
the abasshement of Adam and Eve: does evidently prove. For before they had
sinned (all though they were naked) they were nothing abashed / but forthwith
after their fall: they were feyne (for shame) to make them couerynges of leyues
to hyde and cover themself each from other So that chastity in man was never /
ne ever should have been defaded or blemyshed / but only by sin. And therefore
all such persons as in the old law were sanctified and bourne without
sin: were always virgins and continued all their life in pure and clean
chastity / as Hieremie the prophet / our blessed lady the virgin Mary / and
saint Johan baptiste. So that in the law written: virginite was more excellent
and more worthy than fecondite all though that for the multiplicacion of the
chosen people of god / generation was necessary: and so fecondite that is
pleyntie of children or fruit was in affection. And in the law of nature:
that person that was the first named Just person and beginner of Christ's
church deyed and departed this life a virgin that was Abell. And that Christ
our savior was ever a virgin: the self heretics will not deney / it nedethe
therefore no probacion. Now than let us bygyne at Christ him self to approve
and statute all these vows. For he is the foundation and founteyne of all
perfection / and in him he had the plenitude fulness and abundance of all
manner virtues of whose plenitude: Io. 1.
all christianes done take and receive what they have. And therefore he showed
and set forth that perfection as examplare unto all christianes / eueryche to
follow according unto their vocacion / calyng and grace / which perfection
standethe holy among christianes in secludynge or eschewynge and avoiding of
vice (for one part) and the insuynge / following gadrynge / and keeping of
virtues. The most ready mean where unto is the receyuinge the obseruaunce and
keeping of these.iii. virtues / obedience / wylfull pouerte / and chastity /
which ben received and promised generally of every christian in baptism by
the precepte of Christ / and more specially been they counsayled by our
savior (as we have / and must diverse times show) as the very and most ready
mean and way (as is said) unto perfection. For by obedience / pride / envy /
and wrath / ben secluded and utterly distroyed. Obedience.
And ye contrary virtues yt is to say: mekenes / charity / or loving kyndnes
/ and patience / ben edified and bylded i^ their place and room. And by wylful
pouerte: is avarice or couetise with the accasions, of the flatering world:
avoided / despised / and set at naught. And contrary there unto ben all
things made common / in most perfect liberalite. And chastity can never
precisely be kept: but where gloutony / slouthe / and lechery / ben clean put
out of place / and due abstinence discrete labors and exercises with bashful
by hauiour: ben put in their rowmes / and so ye body be mortified and brought
unto due obedience of soul and the spirit. Ergo these.iii. virtues ben unto
all feythfull christianes profitable and necessary. For (as we said)
these.iii. were expressed and set forth for the same end / and intent by our
savior Christ in the most high degree of perfection. For in eueryche of them
ben diverse degrees of perfection / unto the which: our savior did elect /
chose / and call diverse persons unto the most high degree most like and
most nere unto himself / did he call the.xii. Apostles unto an other degree
the.lxxii. disciples. And of the third degree / were many of both the sexes men
and women. But the Apostles were in the most excellent and highest degree
possible for man in this life of all and every che of these.iii. after they had
received the holy ghost. For than were they all most perfectly obedient most
wylfully and most perfectly poor / and most perfectly chaste. For they were
most specially elect and in more special manner chosen and caled there unto
than any other. Math. 4. C. Mar. 1. B. Luce. 5. B. Math. 10. D.
When he said unto them. Venite post me. Come you (said he) after me / follow
you me / what the affecte was of ye following is after declared in the gospel
of Matthewe / and also in Luke. Where he said in plain terms that who so ever
would follow him in that degree of perfection: Luce. 14.
must forsake father and mother / sister and brother / wife and child / and
also his own proper will. And yet after in more large terms. Who will not
forsake utterly all manner of things that he has in proper possession / and
unto proper use (says he) can not be my disciple in this degree of
perfection. Thus than we done conclude contrary unto these adversaries / that
vows of monastical religion: have beginning / ground / and foundation of
holy scripture / and of the gospel of god.

How these said vows ben contained evidently in the words of the gospel.
The.xii. Chapitre.
How the words of ye gospel done express these said vows / and in effect:
call / and move / or rather bid and appoynte the said Apostles / and all other
of like / calynge unto the same vows. Thus does appear. First where he says
Venite / come you / follow me which is the imperatyfe mode / includinge a
precept or commandment / and they making grant thereunto. For Obedience.
Obedience is set forth / unto the declaracion whereof does follow not only
the renounsynge and forsakynge of all outward things: but also of self
proper will which properly apperteyneth unto obedience / and to hang / holy
/ and to be ordered after his will and not their own. So tha^ were they caled
unto this monastical obedience / as after shall be more largely showed. Of
Chastity
And whereis said they- must forsake father and mother / wife and child / and
so forth is the vow of chastity expressed. Luce. 14.
For after their calynge and conformacion / all the Apostles kept chastity in
most high purite and clennes So is the vow of chastie stablysshed by ye
gospel. Now for wylfull pouerte: Pouerte. Luce. 14.
is a plain text in the end of the same chapitre of Luke / where is said.
Sic ergo, omnis ex uobis qui non renunciat omnibus que possidet: non potest
meus esse discipulus. That is every person of you that does not renounce and
forsake all things that he has in possession: unto proper use / may not or
can not (in any wise) be my disciple / in this degree of perfection. But here
peradventure they will say yt these words of Christ were spoken indifferently
unto all christianes / where unto say I: the words of the self text will
answer. Sic ergo. etc. these ben words of a sure conclusion as very truth /
as much to say in english. As so tha^ / or so therefore / which ben words
of a sure conclusion natwithsta^dynge this word Ergo is used co^munely in
english unto the same purpose and in the same significacion. So than
concludynge the words yt he said before in the same chapitre / he says Ergo
eueryche / or every one / or every person / Omnis / and there folowith / ex
uobis / of you / not alone every person (as they say) For every person is
not of this election or calinge / but every person / every one of you / that been syngulerly / caled and of synguler election unto this perfection / and
likewise of all other that shall succeed you of like calynge. Every one (I say)
of you that does not renounce / and forsake all that he has in possession /
can not be my disciple. This sentence does conclude that who so will be of this
perfection: must presently not only in purpose / or mind for time coming /
but also for that present time before he be a disciple / before he enter in
religion he must forsake all / how all? all (I say) that he has / or may
have / in possession unto proper use. And yet not utterly all things. For
though he may have nothing in possession / yet may he have all things in
common unto uncertain use at the appoyntemente of the souereygne. Thus now
been all these vows statuted and approved by the law of the gospel / as
founded / and grounded upon the same.

How the Apostles did receive the counsel of these.iii. vows / and bind
them self and their successors of like calynge and consent: unto the same.
The.xiii. Chapitre.
HEre peradventure the said adversaries will say yt all though ye Apostles
were of such synguler election as is said and all though they did al keep the
said.iii. virtues with other and among other virtues / yet (say they) does not
follow that they made any vow profession (...) promise thereunto / nor that
they kept the^ for any bond or duty / but only of their own fre liberty
and good will / and so did many other holy saints many years after them. For
direct answer here unto: we must se first and understand what is a vow /
that is: what is mente by this term Vot^m in english a vow.

Diuus Thomas opusculo. 14. ca. 12. et in Scda scde.
The deffinicion or terminacion of a vow.
A Vow (than) is an act of promise / that does apperteyne unto the due
honor of god. For it is a promise made unto god of those things that done
bylonge unto his honor / whereby a person does bind him self unto that
thing that before that vow was i^ his own liberty / and he nothing bound
there unto. And if a persons were bound: yet does the vow make him more
streytly bound than he was / natwithstandynge if the vow be ones made it
must nedely be kept / and may not be broken without sin or offense. Deu. 23.
Cum uotu^ voueris domino deo tuo (says ye scripture) non tar dabis reddere.
etc. When thou have made a vow unto thy lord god / tarry not ne make delay to
render and perform the s^ / for our lord will require it of the. Eccle. 5. A.
And aga^ne in an other place. It thou make a vow unto our lord: make no
stopage ne delay: to render and pay the same. For god is displesed with a
folysshe and vnfeythfull promise / perform therefore whatsoever thou do
promise. For much better were it thou made no vow: tha^ after thy vow not
to keep thy promise. These texes and sentences ben co^ditionall and not of
bond natwithstandynge when the vow is made than is it bound. Spal. 65.
Whereof the Prophet says. Reddam tibi vota mea, que distinxerunt lab^^ mea. I
will tender and perform my vows and promises that I have spoken and made
with my mouth. Good delyberacion therefore must be had (as I said before) and
ye spirit proved: Luce. 14.
before the vow be made. For so does our savior signify in the go^^ell of
Luke / by the two parables of him that shul^e preuyde before ye beginning to
bylde: to have sufficient to perform the same / or else should it return
unto his shame and rebuke. And likewise of the king that with fynal power
should adventure in battle with an other of far greater pusaunce and might /
upon which ground is the year of probacion for every person appointed in
religion. A vow also may be made of that thing to be performed where unto
the person is bound all ready / as the Prophet said. Spal. 118.
Porcio mea domine, dixi custodire legem tuam. This good lord is my portion
and chose^ part / and that have I promised by vow: to keep thy law. And
after in the same Psalm. Iuraui, et statui custodire iudicia iusticie tue. I
have sworn or made oath / and statuted and firmly ordered to keep the
iugementes of thy justice / that is thy law and commandment. The prophet
was bound unto the law of god before he made that vow: promise / and oath /
and yet natwithstandinge for the more large merit and to show thereby his love
/ and fervent desire of heart: he made the oath / vow / and promise unto the
same / and was thereby more streytly bound tha^ he was before which bond
(nevertheless) is (as we showed before) more large fredome and liberty. Thus
have we showed what a vow is / that is to say: what is the definicion or
determinacion of a vow.

How and under what form and ma^^^ a vow may be made. The.xiiii. Chapitre.
Now must follow of the form and manner how a vow may be made. For a vow
may be made openly or secretly. The vow secret is made inwardly in the heart
or mind / and in the conscience of the self person / alone that other by
secret words unto him self or else by thought and consent of soul / does
make the vow and promise unto god alone / as did Jacob when he went unto his
uncle / and as Anne the mother of Samuel did before Heli the priest / and as
many other persons done daily make of pilgrimages / or fastes to be done for
them self or their friends. The open vow: is when the person does make it
outward in the hearing and presence of other persons. And this may be i^ two
manners / one caled a simple vow or syngle vow / and ye other a solemn vow.
The simple open vow: is made without solemnite of ye church / and yet i^ the
presence of persons as did Saul and Iepte / and many other in holy scripture.
1. Reg. 14. D. Iudic. 11. G
The solemn vow is / that vow that is made i^ the presence of god and man /
and in the face of the church / and by the auctorite and ordinance of the
same / as in the holy sacrament of baptism / of matrimony / and such other
by the auctorite of both the laws / natwtstandynge these solemn vows may
be made secretly. And where ye circu^stau^ces of the open solemnizacio^ and
she wynge of ye same can not be had / they ben as good and valeante and done
stand in as great strength and effect as the other / and all one unto god /
and before him all of like bond. When the outward sole^nitie (as I s^^^) can
not by had / as by case if a person would make his vow in full feythe to be
baptized that before was a hethen person / and yet were taken suddenly by any
chance unto death: ye vow and promise were in that case sufficient / and as
good as though in deed he had been baptized / and so of all other vows which
(I say) before god ben of like effect and all one. But so ben they not before
man and before ye world. For the vow that is made openly in the face of ye
church: must be kept according unto the condition / and after the manner of
the promise made i^ the same vow / under such peynes and ieopardy as ye
church does assign and appoint there unto. But the vows privily made: may
be broken without any such open punisshement of man / all though they
nothing avoid thereby the pain and punisshement of god. The reason here of is
/ because that man does only se / perceive / and know these things that
openly done appear withoutforth / but god does behold and knows the heart
of man and all the secrets thereof / for nothing may be hyd nor covered from
him. And therefore does he privily punisshe / that is privily offended and
mysdone. For before god the consent of the soul does make ye vow rather than
ye words. Thus have we showed what thing a vow is / and of the diversities
of laufull vows. (For with unlawful or indiscreet vows: we no thing here
meddle) and also we have of the manner and due form of the same / which thing
considered now remains to show and prove for our purpose / how the
Apostles did make these vows and keep ye same which thing ye very letter of
ye gospel does testify / not only that they undertook the^ by ye counsel
of Christ in consent alone / but also in outward word / as does appear in the
gospel of Matthewe and also of Luke. Matthew. 19. Luce. 18.
Where i^mediately after our savior had given the counsel and showed the
ieoperdy of the^ that caled there unto / did forsake the same and also of the
meruaylouse difficulty and hardness to come unto salvation with abu^dau^ce of
riches: they forth with answered in outward words / saying. Sir behold / se
/ perceive / and know / that we (by thy counsel and commandment) have
left and forsaken all manner of things that we had or might have / and also we
have followed the / yt is after saint Hierome upon the same letter / we have
left and forsaken our own will / to follow the / and to be at thy will in
such due obedience as thou had unto god the father. Ieronimus
Sith tha^ (said they) we have thus forsaken all: what shall it avail us /
what profit shall we have thereby / and what shall be our reward Our savior
Christ answered here to by a manner of oath and deep affirmacio^. Saying. Amen
dico uobis etc. I do a certain you or promise for a surety (said he) that you
that have followed me: shall be with me iuges of all the hole world. And all
manner of persons yt (for my sake) will leave and forsake his kynne / father and
mother / sister and brother / wife and child / lands and pocessions / shall
have therefore much more than they done forsake / and yet over that / shall they
have life and bliss everlasting. Note and mark well the words of the
gospel / when our savior had showed the Apostles what should be the reward
of their obedience in following him / he showed forthwith what should be the
perfection of that obedience / that is to say not only to live self will by
obedience / but also to forsake the flesh / yt is Domum. The house and
ancestors whereof we come by kynred / that is father and mother and also those
with whom we ben familier / and joined in carnal affection all though
natural / as brother and sister / wife and child / and this apperteineth unto
chastity / and that follows lands / fyldes / and possions / does apperteyne
unto wylfull pouerte. What now can be more pleyne than that the Apostles of
Christ did (not only in consent of heart and mind but also in express
words) receive the counsel of Christ / and follow his calynge unto the
high perfection / and these.iii. essenciall vows. And so did they persevere /
and keep the^ constantly all their life time / without violence or spotte. Thus
appears bryghtely (contrary unto these blasphemers) that al these.iii. vows
/ have foundation and ground upon holy scripture in both the testamentes old
and new / natwtsta^dynge they ben (as we said before) perfections of counsel
and not of commandment. And therefore no persons ben bound to enterprise and
to take these perfections: but only at self liberty and fre will / except
they ben caled / by special election there unto / as the Apostles were. For
than (I think verily) that i^ such case they were bound to receive them
after due proof of the said calynge and election. So that if they should
forsake that calynge they should be in ieopardy to be refused and forsaken of
god: much more than should they be in peril and ieopardy that have received
the calyng and made vow and profession upon the same argument. Matthew. 19.
Luce. 18.
Here of I take of the words of our savior as in the places before rehearsed /
where he said that no person putting his hand unto the ploughe / and lokynge
beck: is apt for the kingdom of heaven / that is meant of such persons as
been caled by the inward mocion of the spirit / and done give consent there
unto / and yet will not (for because of the pleasure they have i^ the world or
ye flesh) follow the same mocion in effect and deed / of which manner of
persons: our savior said forthwith in the same letter / that it is of more
difficulte and more hard for such persons to come or to enter in to heaven /
than for a camel to enter through the eye or hole of a nedle / that is to
say: that such persons as done rather forsake god than his creatures / can
not lyghtely be saved / much more than be those persons in peril and
ieopardy of their salvation / yt after they have made vow and promise by
solemn profession: Io. 13.
done forsake the same / as Judas did. But here peradventure some persons
would axe of me / how they might know or perceive what persons / and when
they ben chosen and calyd / unto this perfection or religion.

How a person (by large conjecture) may perceive / or believe and trust
their calynge unto religion is of the election and spirit of god. The.xv.
Chapitre.
TO determyne precisely and to make assercion and surety what person is chosen
and / caled by our lord / or wha^ any person is so caled unto religion is
very hard and above mine enter prise and learning / natwithsta^dyng I think
large conjecture may be had thereof I shall therefore show therein my poor
mind ever by due protestacion submittynge my self unto correction / and glad
would I be to give occasion unto learned men to speak more largely therein. For
certeynly (in mine oppinion) one of ye greatest causes or occasions of the
dekey of religion: is the wrong enter therinto without any election or calynge
of god / and without due examinacion of the mocion and of the intent and
purpose of the enter. For the great old enemy the dyuell: does many times
transfigure / translate / and change himself into the four me and lykenes of
a bright and good Angel. 2. Cor. 11.
That is: that he will move and stere many persons unto a thing that (of it
self) is good and meritoriouse: unto the end / purpose / and intent / to
deceive: and much rather thereby to noy and hurt them. So does he (douteles)
not seldom move persons unto religion / such as he knows well ben nothing
apt ne mete therefore. To show all his crafty / wyly and deceytful wayse
therein / can no man in this life / not withstanding yet shall we for example
set forth some of his means. For he does use diverse means and instruments
unto diverse persons. Unto some persons: does he use his own proper
instrument / that is to say: pride / ambicion / and self trust. For some
persons does he find and percyue that done stand well in their own favor
and co^seyte / and much done trust and have confidence in their own virtues /
and so done suppose or judge their own life of more synguler perfection: than
is the life of other persons / and that their wits wysdomes / prudence /
policy / and learning / passes many other. Such persons than does he move
and stir (as a great deed of charity) to go unto religion. Where they may
(says he unto their thoughts) do much good / seeing the great dekey of
religion. For his life or hers: should refourme one monastery / and do much
good (by yt example) in all the religion in their spiritualites / and his
wisdom and prudence should repair the pouerte and ruyme of the temporalities.
And also the hole coue^t would make such a person: shortly souereygne and
ruler of all. But when this person (by such persuacion) is entered not
regarding that as a little poyso^ does infecte much good meat: so does pride
many virtues / than does he fail of that purpose. For there does he find
one of as good life as he or better. An other as wise or wyser. The third of
more deep understanding or learning / or at the least: such persons does he
find there as will not follow his ymaginacion / nor the conclusion where upon
he trusted / than does he begin to murmur and grudge / and to say he will
depart thens unto an other house / or unto an other religion / or return
again by a capacite where he was / or else will he live where he does at his
own pleasure / or else will he make much trouble and unrest. And all this
co^methe for ye defaute of the first enter. Unto some other persons does he
use the world as his instrument / and specially unto such persons / as he
perceyuethe have appetite and desire to have goods and riches of the world /
and can not bring about their mind / ne bring their purpose to pass therein
Than says the enemy: look upon such an abbotte such a priour / or such
officers / and thou may perceive they ben rich and have playnte / if thou
werein religion thou should lack nothing / and sometime he does couple and
join unto this couetyse: his own said propre instrumente of pride / as in
them that been disposed unto ambicion / unto the desire of high rowme / dignite
/ governance / rule / and dominacion / before the sight and co^sideracio^ of
these persons / does he lay (as I said before) ye co^sideracio^ of their
supposed virtues and abilites after ye manner of ye proud pharesy. And the
vylnes and insufficie^cy of all other persons as in his Judgment unto whom he
says. In such a monastery / ben many great offices / and goodly rowmes
where such a person as you be may have rule / and preminence / and promote
his kynne and friends. For inco^parison unto you all they ben but children and
ediotes and foles / and in continuance you may be sure to have the mytre or to
be sovereign. If such persons (after their enter) fortune to obtain their
mind and purpose / the religion i^ that place goes to wrack. And if they be
deceived and put from their purpose: they been never in rest / but always full
of trouble / and full combrouse persons. This crafty deceytfull enemy: does
also use the flesh for his instrument as in such persons as done enter
religion: rather for ye surety of their bodily living: than for the love of
god / and the increace of virtue. And such persons co^munely ben remysse i^
their duty dull / i^ labors / delicate and full of dissolucion. I dare say
no more let this suffice for example. Now unto our institute and purpose
although no man may know for sure certeynte that his calinge is of god
(reuelacion always excepted) yet may all religious persons have large
conjecture / and so to have good hope and trust in the mercy of our lord /
that their calynge is of his holy spirit: when (by diligent search and aften
examinacion of conscience / showed plainly unto wise and spiritual learned men)
they can not find ne prove: that any of the said occasions / or any other
thing of this world pleasant or displeasaunt / should be be cause of their
enter into religion / but only the love and desire of our lord / and for the
more surety of their salvation. And specially when they feel their mocion unto
religion does grow and increace unto a contempt and despisynge of al worldly
and carnal pleasures / and does draw their hertes / and mind unto such a
co^stancy therein: that another prosperity / nor aduersite of the world / ne any
fere or dread of peynes / or labors in the religion: ne any persuacion of
friends does move them to leave and forsake their entrepryse and holy purpose /
but that the mind be (in manner) obstinate in the same / all though the self
person knows no cause nor reason why his mind is so set: but only that he
feleth (as I said) a desire to serve our lord. Than (say I) we may well
conjecture that this calynge is of our lord / natwithstandynge yet do not I
say that for all these mocions any person should forthwith suddenly enter
religion ne yet receive the habit without a forther deliberacion with learned
counsel. For the holy Apostle saint Johan says. 1. Io. 4. A.
Probate spiritus. etc. examine you (says he) and prove the spirit and mocion
of your calynge whether they be of god or no. And yet done not I approve over
long deliberacion. For although ye Apostles of Christ came not all at the
first call or calynge: yet did they come shortly at the second or third
calynge / and some at the first as saint Mathewe. Matthew. 4. Matthew. 9. A. Matthew.
19. Luce. 18. Matthew. 8.
Some persons when they were caled: would not come / as the rich young man of
whom we spoke before. And some other did are a respect and time of
declaracion to provide for their parents and friends / and for their worldly
goods / which time natwithstandynge our savior would not grant them. Ibidem.
And yet other some did offer the^ self to follow our savior / and he would
not receive them. The most ready token to know the very calinge of god (I ever
except reuelacion) is: when a person (void in conscience of all the causes
and occasions before said) has a secret surete ministered by the spirit of
god / unto the soul as saint Augustynes mother had of his calynge. In libro
co^fessionu^.
Thus have you my poor mind: to know by conjecture the calynge of god / yet
does the ghostly enimye: craftily and subtily assail some other persons that been full devout / but disposed to instabilite / as to seek the most perfect
and sure way of their salvation / and they ben full of wauerynge minds. Now
they will go unto religion / and to morrow they shall be in the contrary mind:
or this day in mind of one religion / and the next day of an other They will
put many doutes / and suspecte many things. Some other contrary ben of over
large presumpcion: that put no doutes / make no stoppage / but seek religion /
and enter there unto / not able to accomplysshe and perform their duetes. And
both these manner of persons ben lyghtely deluded and deceived by the enimye.
For ye first sorts of persons: wha^ they ben professed / ben never content
with the company where they ben / but other they will go unto an other religion /
or else unto an other house of the same religion / or peradventure starte out
and run abroad again / and never bide the second change of the moon in one
place. The other persons / that done enter without due deliberacion done
commonly for think their enterprise / and been right sorry that they ben as
clogges unto their company. For every good and right devout or perfect
person is not apt ne mete to be a good religious person / yet such persons
by very mekenes and patience and good religious manner and byhauoure / done many
times serve god right well and very well also done content their company / how
be it (as we showed upon the rule) every person should before they receive the
religion: know the rule of the same / and put them i^ exercise / and surely
prove them how they ben able to perform the same / and thereafter to make
true relacion unto the covent / and that may much discharge conscience.

Of such persons as done receive religion / only to avoid and fle the
occasions of sin. The.xvi. Chapitre.
SOme persons yet there ben that been void of all the occasions before said
that is: that done nothing presume upon any abilite or virtue of them self /
ne set or care any thing for honor or preeminence: and have sufficient
substance without dread to lack or want any thing necessary. And that been
full well minded to serve god / and yet natwithstande they done perceive (by
daily experience) that of very fraylte they done fall into sin and offense of
god / contrary unto ye good mind and purpose / where upon they have fixed
them self / and made promise there unto. As by example of them that have
determined to avoid pride / envy / and wrath / and yet in company they will
(by fraylte) receive their own praise / and some time set forth the same
beionde good measure / and when they here detraction: done not rebuke it / but
sometime add there unto / and by a light occasion fall out of patience into Ire
and discord. And of the^ that will dispyse the world yet by a frail
disposicion of nature: they shall stele a thing they find at liberty. And of
the frayltie of the flesh: many persons have had over much experience. Now
unto our purpose. If a person would only to fle and avoid such occasions:
enter into religion. I think the cause may be well allowed / and the persons
profit right well thereby. Psalm.
The Prophet says. Cum sancto: sanctus eris. etc. with good company a person
shall be good. And with the mysordered persons shall he be mysgyded. Matthew. 14.
Saint Petre had good hope and trust in him self: when he byganne to go upon
the water of the sea. And yet our lord did not forsake him / when he faynted
and byganne to drown in the sea / which does sygnifie the world / nor yet
did not our lord continue forth his journey upon the sea: but took him by the
hand and brought him into the surety of the ship / where by religion is
signified. And for the fury of ye flesh our savior gave a notable lesson in
the gospel of Mathewe showing ye meritorious degrees of chastity: by a
parable of.iii. Matthew. 19.
manner of Eunuks / that is to say: such persons as ben deprived of their
natural members of generation. The Eunuks that were so of nature done signify
such persons as of nature ben melancoly that is cold and dry / by reason
whereof they been very little or nothing vexed with the flesh and so have they
chastity without great merit. And by them that were made Eunuckes by force: ben
such persons signified / as ben restreyned of their own will and
concupiscence / as young persons that been under tuicion and governance / and
many other that would do amys if they were at liberty and power / which have
chastity by force / and yet although this chastity be not meritorious / yet
may it be profitable unto the persons. For it does restreyne them from sin
unto their less pain / and also by custom: they shall be the less vexed and
the fury of the flesh / the rather quenched. For the custom and use does
alter and change nature / and does make in a person (in manner) a new or an
other nature / and so that thing that was unto their disposicion greuouse /
and paynfull shall (by use) be unto them comfort / pleasure / and joy in
conscience for it shall ministre unto the soul: virtue / and good manners. And
unto the name or fame / honor / and praise. And unto the body: purity /
clennes / and honest. That is than a fortunate and happy force: that does
cause so great profit and goodness. The third sort of Eunukes that (as our
savior said) did wylfully deprive them self of al possibilite unto the act
of generation: does signify such persons as done wylfully bind them self
unto chastity by vow and promise / and specially i^ religion: where they do
not only avoid occasions / but also utterly deprive them self of all
possibility unto the contrary / if they keep their rules and ordinances.
Here some persons will say that by this sentence: all religious persons
should be enclosed or else be they not deprived of all possibilite: as the
Eunukes been (...) Unto this I say: they must remember what were my last
words before. If they keep (said I) their rules and ordinances. For by the
rule and ordinance of every religion: every religious person should be close
/ and sure kept from all possibility unto that myschefe. For (as we have
showed in our exposition upon saint Augustynes rule: and also as we shall more
plainly show in the third part of this work) no religious person may any
time be alone i^ any place / with the contrary sex / that is to say: male
and female / sole or alone. For (as we there done prove) no religious person
may lawfully go out of their clausure unto any other place or company: but
only for a cause reasonable and necessary / and yet not so alone: but always
accompanied with such persons / as the souereyne does assign. Nor yet should
no seculer person enter or come within the clausure of any monastery: but
under ye same form / and never to be alone with any of the covent. Thus
therefore done we conclude: that every religious person: is an Eunuke
Evangelical. And so does follow that to enter religion / to flee and avoid
the occasions of the sins of ye flesh the world / and the dyuyll / is not
unlawful but rather good and meritorious.

Of such persons as done enter religion: not of their own mind / or desire
there unto / but only put or aplied there unto by the auctorite / or mocion of
their parents or friends. The.xvii. Chapitre.
Diverse persons have diverse times axed my mind and judgment of such
persons as bone enter into religion / in youth under the years of discrecion
applied / and put there unto by their parents or friends / and likewise of
ydeotes that have not the full use of reason. Unto this thing the auctorite
and the acts of holy fathers done give answer. For many holy saints / and
religious fathers have received children into their habyte / and their rules.
And I suppose they did not so without auctorite. For that the parents may
promise / and appoint their children unto religion within age: 1. Reg. 1.
and also before they ben bourne: or yet gotten: does appear i^ scripture / as
of Samuel / our blessed lady / and other. And our lord has also showed unto
the parents by his holy Angels / before the birth of their children / that
they should be religious / as of Sampson. Iudic. 13. Luce. i.
And of saint Ioha^ baptiste. And our savior did not dysdaine the company of
children / but rather he seemed to be well content with them and commanded that
his disciples should not prohibit or let / ne forbede the children to come unto
his presence / he also cured many children / and received thankfully the laud
and praise of infau^tes. And he said that no person should enter into the
kingdom of heaven: but such as were like unto small children. And truth it
is that in chyldhode a person may be more lyghtely framed unto virtue / and
broken in good manners: than in forther age. For the pot or vessel (says
the Poet / does continually sauoure or smell of that thing Oratius.
thing wherewith it was seasoned in ye beginning And certeynly the best and
most perfect educacion or bringing up of youth unto virtue and good manners
is in religion. Sithe than (after an other learned man) Educacio et doctrina
efficient mores. The educacion and bringing up of a person / and the doctrine
/ teaching / and lerninge of the same: does form and make the manners and
conditions there after. And sith therwt as is said the best bringing up is in
the monasteries among religious persons it seems unto me that children may
conuenientely be received into religion. And specially sithe that by the law
and ordinance of ye church / they must be of age sufficient and of discrecion
/ before they be bound and make profession unto any religion. But yet have I
herd of some person that have entered in to religion in youth / and yet after
their profession made in the due and lawful time have (not withstandinge) for
thought their enterprise / and have cursed their parents and friends that
brought the^ there unto. Here unto must I say: that so done we know of them
that in sad years and with great learning and semynge virtue and perfection /
have entered religion and lived therein full virtuously / and have done much
good in the church of Christ and right well have edefied ye people and yet
now ben apostatas and open heretics. Sir will some persons say: these
persons have good knowelege of them self / and had before their enter but ye
other had not so / it seems therefore they may rather be excused than the
other. Certeynly another may be excused / but when the profession and promise is
made / it must need and without remedy be kept. For the scripture says.
Deuteronomy. 23.
Si nolueris polliceri, absque peccato eris. etc. If thou wylt make no promise:
thou may so do without sin / but that promise that has passed thy lyppes /
yt thou have spoken with thy mouth must thou nedely observe / perform and
keep indede / after such manner as thou have promised unto thy lord god. For
of thine own proper will with thyn own mouth have thou spoken ye word which
can not be caled back. And our savior in the gospel (as before is rehearsed)
said. Luce. 9.
Nemo mittens manum ad aratrum. etc. No manner of person yt has bound him
self: by full consent of soul: unto any divine or godly work / and after
does look back / and forsake yt enterprise: can be apt / or mete for the
kingdom of heaven. Act. 5. A.
And i^ the acts of the Apostles: saint Petre said unto Ananie (a person that
of his own mind offered hi^ self to live i^ common as ye other christianes
did / and after brake ye promise) when thy house and land (said he) was in thy
possession: was it not thine own? and likewise ye money thereof at thyn own
proper will and in thy liberty before thy promise / as though he said it was
so / and why than (said he) would thou after that promise made deceive and
falsely make a lie or leasinge unto the holy ghost. For (as there is showed in
the letter) he made a lie and his wife Saphira confirmed the same / for the
which both were stryken suddenly unto death by the vengeance of god / for
brekynge of their vow and promise. So does follow as a plain conclusion that
sith the parents have lawful power to put their children to religion / and if
they i^ lawful age done after make profession: they must need persevere in the
same. Sir say they if they so continue it shall be unto their great pain and
affliction / let them (say I) take patience. For our lord may ryghtwysely:
punisshe the sins of the parents / by the temporal pains of the children.
For the parents done many times put their children unto religion with out due
consideracion / as some to be so discharged of their bodily finding. Some to
the end and purpose so to provide for the te^porall living of their children.
And some in hope and trust to be succored and helped be thyr children. And
some to have them in honor / dignity / and degree / with many other like
causes / nothi^ge spiritual / which thing well considered: should in such
persons be a reasonable occasion of more deep and perfect patience / and in
like manner do I say of them that in sodeyn passion / or that by dissimulacion
have entered in religion. For of such have we herd. Some persons because they
were disappoynted of such makes as they desired to have had in marriage: have
i^ ye passion forsaken the world. Some other suddenly after the death of their
married makes / or of their souereygnes / or of their dear friends / have done
in like manner / that after has repented them / and would have been glad to be
at liberty again. I have herd also of some persons that have dissimuled
their enter / that were never minded to take the religion for any perfection /
ne ever gave consent there unto / but by a manner of curiosite / would do as
their fellows did. And some have entered of ignorance / that never knew / ne
herd speak of any rule / ne of any such statutes / and ceremonies / as after
they proved were their bond and duty / which if they had known before: they
would never have taken the religion. Surely all these do I put in one case with
the^ that have not well and ryghtly received religion. And yet
natwithstandynge: they may not after their solemn profession look back / ne
forsake the same. For no creature can tell by what dispensacion our lord god
suffered them so to do. For I think verily it was for to avoid their more
yuell at the least or else of more deep mercy unto their health and salvation. A
similitude yt was a true story. A certain man was vnryghtwisely committed and
put in prison / and within a little space after (while he there remained)
certain persons that were his enemies came unto his house with full purpose
and mind to have slain him / and when they had broken up the house / and
herd that he was in prison they returned void of their purpose / which
thing wha^ the man knew: he thanked our lord of his wrong full prisonement /
and had great patience therewith So should these persons have byleuynge verily
that almighty god workethe all unto their best. For that is an happy prison or
punishemente / that does restreyne the person from his hurt / and specially
from death / and also that does put him unto surety of life and salvation. But
yet sir say they these persons be not sure of salvation / because they ben
there again their mind and will and therefore the religion shall nothing
profit ne avail them. Here unto I say they may turn that will: as a man
may turn a horse with a brydell. For ye thing that is to may and have power
there unto. Almighty god (by special grace) has put in the liberty of the
self person. Sub te (says our lord) erit appetitus tuus, Gene. 4.
et tu domina beris illius. The appetite of thy sensuality: shall be under the
and in thy power. And thou shalt have dominacio^ lordshyp / and governance
thereof. If the persons than of mis enter would be sorry and disco^tent with
that manner of intent or mysbyhauiour: or of any default i^ their enter and
would wysshe and will in their heart and mind that their enter had been good
and lawful / and that (for the time to come) they would apply their mind /
and dispose them self in the religion according unto ye same: our lord god
will accept their good will / and nombre them as the other company / yet here
they done go forther: saying. Sir some of these persons (in case) can not
bring their heart mind / and will / in any wise to be content with the state
and religion that they have taken / but ever they think / and wish unto god /
that they had never ben professed / and if they were at liberte / they would
never come into any religion / and over that if they might lawfully they would
depart and forsake their religion. They know in concience they entered not
lawfully they remain and bide in religion (as persons in prison) again their
mind and will. And yet forther they can not refourme ye will / what remedy
now? Surely they ben i^ hard case / natwithstandynge yet is there remedy. For
as man has two principal parts: a soul and a body / so has he two wylles
the will of the spirit / and the will of the flesh. The one is reasonable and
the other is sensual. Gal. 5. C.
And these tweyne be ever contrarious / ever at war / and continual battle
/ and never will they be accorded in the child of god (I call those persons
ye children of god: that although they be ryghtsore laded / and tangled with
such clogges yet have they study and care for their salvation) In such
children of god I say these two will been ever contrarious. And therefore
although the sensual will of the flesh can not or rather will not be
content: yet may the reasonable will of the spirit: be right well content / if
the person will give diligence there unto. For all manner of persons may by
that grace that our lord has indifferently given unto the virtuous / and
sinful persons / as he does cause the son to shine upon the yuell persons
as well as upon the good persons / by ye grace I say: all persons may wyshe
or will yt they were sorry for their sin / and carnal will / and that they had
a right ordered spiritual will. And this will: does the merciful loving
kyndenes of our lord allow and admit as sufficient unto salvation. And if
the persons (as I said) would give diligence and cure unto this will / our
lord is so gentle and liberal: that he will multeplie that grace / and add
and freely give more grace there unto. Psalm.
The prophet says. Spera in deo: et ipse faciet. Put your hope and trust in
our lord: and he will perform the same thereafter. To. 5. A.
For hope in him: can never confound ne deceive any person. In all spiritual
battle: Matthew. 11. B.
force and violence is required and so says the gospel. Regnum celorum vim
patitur et violenti rapiunt illud. The state and perfection of Christ's
religion / does require violence and strife. And the violent and herty
willing persons shall rauysshe and win ye same. 2. Timo..2. A.
Non coronabitur (says saint Paul) Nisi qui legittime certauerit. No person
shall have the croune of everlasting reward but he that has foghten /
wrastled / stryuen and duly labored therefore. And every person may (of good
reason) have courage and heart to fight i^ that fylde where ye victory lies
and restethe in his own will For our loving lord does require no more of us
in this battle: but that we put to our fre will / and leyne unto his grace
freely given. If the persons than that we spoke of: would be of good will / and
pray for grace it should daily be multiplied and increase in them. And that
carnal will of the sensuality: yt so do trouble them: shall be slain / or at ye
least so vanquyshed / taken prisoner / and so subdued and made bond captyue
for ever / unto the reasonable will of the spirit / that the persons shall
thereby have of their dulnes: quicknes of their sorrow / joy of their doubt /
certain of their dyspere / full trust of their troubles / quietude and rest.
And of al their peynes: pleasure and gladness. Now for a conclusion: that this
will is sufficient for the said persons to continue ryghtely their profession
without any new profession / may appear by example of a conclusion approved
of learned doctoures / thus children done receive the sacrament of baptism when
they know nothing what they done receive / yet wha^ they come unto years of
discrecion / and done consent i^ will unto that thing that was done by their
parents / they need not ne should not be rebaptized And also if a person in
full years of discrecion / that were a turk / an infidele / or hethen person /
would (by simulacion) feyne for the pleasure of other persons: or to have
better rest / more favor / or more lucre / gaynes / or winning among
christianes receive the sacrament of baptism without any feythe there unto /
or bylyue in christ / only inte^dynge to do as they done / and to receive the
same thing / and so to be supposed as one of the^ Now say I: if this person
afterward (by the example of other christianes / or by exhortacio^s) come unto
the grace of perfect feythe in christ / and does repent of that dissimulacion
or feynynge in receyuynge the sacrament and would feyne he had received it
ryghtely: that will (say I) with his feythe / and believe does make unto him
the sacrament of baptism valiant / and to stand in full effect. So that
another he needs ne yet should be rebaptized / or christened again. In like
manner may we conclude of the persons before said / that their profession is
valea^t and good / so they put there unto their good will / yet has herein
question be axed of me. Whether it were not more surety of conscience / for
these persons thus troubled in mind: to obtain dispe^sacion of the pope and
so to be more quiet in conscience. As unto the popes dispensacion: I will not
speak there again. For of surety the popes dispensacion duly obtained is
valiant and sure. But that ye persons shall thereby be more quiet in mind and
conscience: I am not sure / for few have I known or yet herd of: that by
dispensacion: have been better ordered in their life than before / but of many
have I herd ye contrary. And yet that term duly obtained: has a long
tail / which does not apperteyne unto this matter. Wherefore I dare well say
it were of more surety and high merit: to fight out the field in form
before infourmed. Since (as we said) the surety of the victory: remaynethe holy
in the said will of the self persons. And thus an end of this matter / as
unto the stablysshement of the said.iii. vows monastical again the
heretics: which thing we have in manner by degresse entreated. Now therefore
we shall return unto ye promise of our enterprise / natwithstandynge we must
here yet somewhat say unto them. For they done not only speak again the said
vows / but also much more done they mock the holy ceremonies of religion.
Saying that in all the new testament is no commandment ne mention of
ceremonies / but that saint Paul unto the Romans / and Gallatas / and other
places does rebuke all ceremonies and all is false. For in the new testamente
from the incarnacio^ of Christ: unto his resurrexio^ ascencion / and sendynge
of the holy ghost: is no place void of ceremonies / and saint Paul did only
condemn the chief trust that the Iues had in the ceremonies of ye old law.
We shall therefore go forth with ceremonies of the which we have promised to
speak in the beginning of this first part of our book.

Of the holy ceremonies of religion / and first of the definicion or
determinacion of the self term. The.xviii. Chapitre.
FIrst you shall know what is meant by this term ceremony. A ceremony is as
much to say: as a rite / a custom / an usage / an outward form / or
byhauoure that is done in the service of god / and unto his honor. And this
is the proper significacion of this word / or term ceremony /
natwithstandynge the same term is usurped / used / and taken often times for
any obseruaunce / or service / reuerentely done of man unto man / specially of
the subject unto the souereyne. And after both these manners or diuersites
ceremonies were used i^ the old law / and ben also used yet in the church of
Christ. For although ye ceremonies of the old law done now sease / and ben
utterly paste / and put away / as unto the superficial things that than
appeared / and that (by them) was wroght or done outwardly: yet (because they
were figures) the signification of them / and also the form manner and
byhauoure: does remain whereby the church of Christ has infourmacion. For
many of the ceremonies of the church ben taken out of the ceremonies of the
old law. And yet although all the precepts and commandments of god be in
like manner to be kept of all persons: unto his honor / yet the manner and
doing of that honor is not all one / nor after one form. For the ceremonies
of diverse countres and places ben varia^t and determined or appointed eueryche
after their proper rites / customs and manner / both in place / time days /
and hours / and in singing / reading / sensynge / processions / stacions /
inclinacions / sessions / prostracions / genuflections / with all such other
obseruances / which ben / caled ceremonies / because (as we said) they done
apperteyne unto the worshype and honor of god / which honor may be done
unto him in diverse manners / that is to say: in soul / heart / or mind alone
/ and this manner is al inward / and therefore it needs no ceremonies / not
withstanding the holy father saint Hughe. De sancto Victore. Does counsel
all religious persons i^ al such service as they done unto god only in heart
and mind / and when they be also alone with out any company to use such manners
/ byhauiours and ceremonies / than in priuite / as they should use abroad
among company / because that custom is light to be kept / and loathe to be
broken and changed yet (as I said) that in ward honor unto god needs none
outward ceremonies. But unto the other outward honors of god done for
example / and unto ye edificacion of al christianes ceremonies ben necessary.
And this honor may be in two manners / that is to say only i^ the body and
nothing in the heart or mind / whereof the Prophet says. Populus hic labiis
me honorat. etc. Esa. 29. Marci. 7.
This people does honor unto me with their mouth: but their hertes ben far
from me. The other manner of honor is both with heart and tongue / and this is
very good. And yet unto both this manners ceremonies (as I said) ben
necessary. For although the honor yt is done unto god without heart or
mind / only in mouth / or outward in work: be not of it self meritorious
/ ne much does avail or profit the persons of it self: yet may it avail
and profit by accidens or chance both unto the mynysshynge of sin / and
unto the obteynynge of grace / as by the example and occasion of virtue / and
edificacion given unto other persons by that outward honor and therefore unto
this hour or time ceremonies ben necessary and convenient. That to show or
do such honor with such ceremonies in such form and manner: above or
beyond the duty / state / and degree of the persons: semethe always to be
ypochrisy or supersticion yet can no person judge the heart of the persons /
for the mocions of grace and compunctions: may come sodeinly. But if the
persons do no forther tha^ bond and duty in such honor doing: than ben
they not ypocrites although they do but little merit thereby. Example of both
if a tapster / or an hosteler / a caichpol / or baily errant with such like
persons: would (before and in the presence of people) use ye ceremonies of
religious persons in protestacions / inclinacio^s knocking upon the breast /
lyftynge up of hands / and eyes or sight unto heaven / with such other: they
might be suspecte of ypocricy / but not (as I said) condemned. For the other
part / if religious persons done outward the holy ceremonies of religion
such as before we spoke of in most devout / and holy manner: and yet inward
had no devotion in heart or mind / they were not for all that ypocrites:
because they do but their duty / and as bycommethe their state and degree. For
if they did not the same things: they should slander and give occasion. And
in so doing they done edify by their example / and may the rather be disposed
unto compunction / and (as we said) to obtain grace. For those alone ben very
ypocrites that done show outward that is not withinforthe / to the intent to
be supposed and iuged better than they ben / and thereby to be the more preysed
/ and to be more in favor or to have winning or advantage thereby /
natwithstandynge the ceremonies may ever do good / and never hurt except
they much excede due manner. The other honor of god done outward in
reuerente manner. And inward also with heart / mind / and devotion: is ever
good and profitable. And yet ben ceremonies necessary there unto / without
which: the honor should be deminisshed and made less / and is by them the
more increased. And therefore were ceremonies ordained / and so ben used. And
because that in a co^munalty / and among people: some persons ben apt and
(of natural disposicion / or of grace / or of educacion / bringing up / and
of teaching) ben disposed to do honor and service unto our lord wylfully of
them self / with all reverence / due manner / and diligence. Some other
contrary: ben very dull / slothful / negligente / rude / and careless / in
doing of their duty / wherefore it was necessary and profitable to put the
holy ceremonies apperteinynge unto the honor of god / under precepte and
commandment. Exodus Leuit. Numer. Deuteronomy. etc. pass. peroi^a. Matthew. 14. B. Mar.
6. E. Io. 6. A. Luce. 4. Marc. 7.
And so were they put in the old law in many places. And In ye new law our
savior him self used many holy ceremonies / as in the gospel of Mathewe /
when he multiplied ye bread and fysshe / wherewith ye people were fed he took
the bread first in his holy hands and looked up unto the air / or unto heaven
/ and said grace. And in Luke / when he should preach: he took first a book in
his hand and red therein / and after closed the book / and than byganne to
preach. In Mark when he should cure a man that was deffe and dowme he first
took him on side from the people / and tha^ put his fyngers in his ears / and
spitte out / and therewith he touched his tongue / and than he looked toward the
heaven / and mourned or made great moan. And in the gospel of Johan / when he
turned water in to wine / he caused the waterpottes to be filled with water where
he might have made a pype of new wine. Io. 2. A.
And when he cured a blind man: Io. 9. E.
he made cleye / and oynted his eyes therewith. In the wayshynge of the fete of
his Apostles / and in the consecracion of his body: Io. 13. A. B.
he used many ceremonies / and so did he i^ many other places of the gospel.
And we know well none of them were made ne used in vain Our mother holy
church has also ordained many holy ceremonies / as in all the.vii.
sacraments. In all sacramentales and sanctificacion / or halowynges / and
divine service that been put forth to be observed under precepte. And so did
our savior bid and command his Apostles to use ye same ceremonies that he
did wherefore ceremonies ben of good auctorite. Io. 13.
And therefore religious fathers have ordained many diverse holy ceremonies i^
religion. The rule of every religion: is as commandments which
commandments every person that is professed after / or accordynde unto that
rule: is bound to observe and keep with all the ceremonies contained in the
same. And yet above and beyo^de these ceremonies of the rules holy fathers (For
the more precise obseruaunce and keeping of ye same rules) have ordained and
made many other holy ceremonies / and put them also under commandment in
their constitucions or statutes.

Of constitucions / or statutes of religion / both general and special.
The.xix. Chapitre-
IN every religion: there ben (beside the rules) statutes or constitucions /
both general / and special / according unto the which: ye ceremonies of
religion ben variant in diverse places. For by ye general statutes or
co^stitucions of ye orders: one order of the same and self rule is divided
from an other in habit / in array / and in ceremonies. For every order has
constitucions or statutes general for every monastery of that order. As by
example of the rule of saint Augustyn / of the which rule been diverse and
many orders / and every order has constitutions by it self. As our order
here of Syon: is of ye rule of saint Augustyn and after / and according unto
the same rule ben we professed. Natwitstandynge our constitucions general unto
every monastery of the same religion been caled the rule of saint savior /
or ye constitucions of saint Brigitte (So caled) because yt by ye reuelacio^ of
our savior they were showed and ordered by our holy mother saint Brigitte / by
ye which co^stitucions: we ben different from other orders of ye same rule.
For ye reguler chanons / ye bonehoms ye order of saint Iohans ye cross or
crouched freres / ye dominikes caled freres prechers ye carmelites caled white
freres / with diverse other orders: ben all of the same rule of saint Augustyn /
all of one rule but yet ben they of diverse constitucions and thereby different
eueryche from other in habit and in other ceremonies. There ben also other
co^stitucio^s special unto every monastery of eueryche of these orders caled
statutes / or co^stitucions local / whereby every singular monastery does
differ from other i^ certain ceremonies and private. For every si^guler
monastery does make statutes / or co^stitucio^s local private and particular
or special for ye same monastery / alone made by ye consent of ye covent in
their chapitre or else received by the iniunction of the ordinary or visitours.
Sith therefore all the ceremonies of religion ben contained in the constitutions
/ other general or special / and every singular monastery / has ye proper
ceremonies there unto particular written in their own books / our labor
herein is much the less natwithstandynge somewhat to answer the enemies and
blasphemers of religion / we shall speak of a few ceremonies such as we herd
of late they done mock and rail upon. And so the lovers of good religion may
conjecture what may justly be said unto the residue.

Of the habit or array of religious persons. The.xx. Chapitre.
First these heretics done reyle again the habit of religious persons /
which habit / clothing / or array / according unto the general
constitucions of every order is diverse and in fassho^ color and manner of
werynge: much different / which these heretics would have to be all of one
manner in fashon and color. This therefore shall be ye order and manner of our
answers unto their reasons or rather mockes. First we shall rehearse their
opinions and saynges / and than shall we make answers there unto by such
manner of reasons as they done make only of wit and brain without auctorite
like unto like. And than shall we afterward put some reason (for our part)
grounded upon auctorite.

The reason of the heretics.
First they say (for their chief assercion) that the habit / clothing / or
array of religious persons: should be none other than all other christian
people done were. For sithe all been christianes in like: all should be of like
habit or array / it is therefore more supersticion / and a very singularite and
a pride to be known from other persons.

Answer here unto.
SVrely I marvel much of their blyndnes and how they might for shame writ
so simple a reason. They would have all religious persons of one array as
other christianes. And yet they se not how variant the clothing and array is
of al other christianes / not only of diverse realms or kingdoms: but also of
the contres / or shyres of the same self realm. And the cities also or towns
/ let them look well upon the self citezyns of London / and they shall se
every craft variant i^ habit from other / and in one house their servants
ben not of one array. The lords / knights / and Ientelmen / have variant
lyuereys and diverse fashons. After which sort would these heretics that the
religious persons should be clothed or arrayed? I trow they will appoynte
none. yet say they: it were convenient that if they should be different from
other people: heretics) And the array also of many other christianes: shall go
forth / and continue as it now is. And that is more like unto the turks
array than unto christianes / or rather more defourme and abominable tha^ of
any infideles. For surely ye world in many things: draws much unto
Ientilite. Natwithstandynge that saint Paul said unto his disciples. To. 12.
A.
Nolite conformari huic seculo. Have not you will / appetite / or desire / to
be in any thing conformable / or like / unto the sinful people of the world.
This answer is hederto (as we said) like unto like.

Of the conueniency of habit according unto reason founded upon auctorite.
The.xxi. Chapitre.
Now for our part: we shall put a reason for a foundation or ground / which
(I think) none of them will deney / that is: the more nere that the array /
habit / or byhauoure of any person be unto ye institute and ordinance of
god: the more is it of perfection / and the more of all godly persons to be
allowed / effected / and desired. And contrary: the more it be contrarious and
again the prohibicion and ordinance of god and holy scripture / the more is
it of imperfection and ye more to be dissalowed / dispraysed / and abhorred.
Now let us se than what habit / or array is found in holy scripture to be of
the ordinance of god / and what of the mysorder of man. The first hole
garment that ever was made for the hole body of man god him self did make. For
when man was in the state of innoce^cie before he had done sin: he need no
clothes / and though he were naked: yet was he nothing ashamed nor abashed
thereof. For innocency might never suffer noyante ne displeasure. But after
sin committed and done: Adam was sore abashed and ashamed of his wife / and
she likewise of him. In so much they hyd themself in a busshe / and made them
self prive clothes of fyggetre leaves And sone after that time: Gene. 3. D.
our lord (as ye scripture says) made for Adam and for his wife / skynny
cotes or cotes of skynnes / and clothed or covered them with the same / which
garments should seem not very rich / natwithstandynge if the same garments
were now present to be showed they might peradventure be more worth than a
kings roobe / they might be so fine furs and so do I suppose they were /
natwithstandynge they were not tha^ of high price / nor of any curiouse
fasshone / and what the color was: we may well suppose no dyed color at
all.

Of the reason or cause of garments / and of the varians or diuersites of the
same. The.xxii. Chapitre.
HEre now semethe unto me convenient to search out / and to show ye reason /
cause / or occasion of garments or clothyng / whereunto or unto what end what
purpose or effect / clothi^g and garments were ordened and made. For before
man had done sin: he was (as we said before) all naked / and yet without any
shame or bashement / but sone after his sin: he made a garment for very
shame. So than may we prove: that ye first occasion of garmente was shame and
abashement. And the effect where unto ye garment did inseruer was to cover and
to hyde the me^bres of man / which (by sin only) were shameful / or
bashful in so much: that the man and wife lawfully married by god him self:
and both yet virgyns / and alone without company (for no reasonable creature
was than in the world that with bodily sight / or look: might behold or se
them / but only them self) and yet were they either a shamed of other / and
much abashed to be seen naked. Here let all christianes note well / how
shameless / how beastely / and how unnatural some persons ben / that without
shame or abashement (by more than beastly boldness) will take delectacion / and
pleasure in abominable sight / and byholdynge of nakedness. Shame than or
abashement: Gene. 3.
the hole body of man / for defense again all manner of weders. A third cause
yet may be of garmente Habitus non facit monachum. The habit or garmente
does not make a person religious. I say this is truth. For else a freres
habit: Habitus facit non monachum. That is that the habit may render and
make a religious person a very Ass / and no religious person. For if a
person that is professed in religion: would (without cause to be allowed in the
law) put away ye habit of his profession: and were a seculer habit / that
person (I say) were excommunicate or accursed / and so worse than an Ass.
But now let us reason herein. They say there is no perfection in the
clothing. And I say there is no perfection in meat nor drink / yet say I a
person by due fedynge may in the qualite and quantite of meat and drink:
much merit / and obtain perfection / and contrary: lose merit / and be
more inperfecte. So is it of the use of ye garment or clothing. For the
clothing or array may sklaunder and give occasion unto the negheboure / Deu.
22. A.
Ne any man should use ye clothyng of women. For that is (says the scripture)
abhominacion unto almighty god. you may (than) surely conclude that god would
ordeyne nothing: that after should be abhominacion or displeasure unto him
self. Than is it truth yt a man to were a woman's garment and array / or the
contrary: a woman to were man's array is not comely / convenient / nor
according. And thus does follow that I said / the garments of Adam and Eve
were in fasshon (according unto the sex) notably different. And so ought it
to be among well ordered christianes according unto the ordinance of the
church / it becomes not also a prince to were a beggars cote / nor a wise man
a foles cote. 30. disti. Si qua muli.
The natural disposicio^ of man will praise a good and a goodly manner of
vesture / though it were right course and poor / and contrary: will abhor
or disprayse / an uncomely / or inconvenient vesture. Put this case ye a man or
woman / would (for vesture or instead of a garment) were ye skin or hyde of
a bull / or a cow / and set the horns upon his head / and let the tail come
after upon the ground: were that a comely sight / or according unto man's
nature? I am sure you will say nay. A sheep is known by the vesture / from a
dog or a wolf / and so of other beasts. And some time here in England /
the merchants where known by their vestures from men of the law / and both
they from courtiours / and so forth of other like / which diuersites were
found by man's deuyse. But now let us se of some diuersites of array founded
in scripture.

Of diuersites of array / and of the reasons or causes thereof by the auctorite
of scripture. The.xxiii. Chapitre.
IF we look well upon holy scripture: we shall find that from the beginning of
ye world sithe that time that there was diversity of people: there was also
diversity of garments / clothing / or array. For as soon as Cayn / and some
of his systers with him: were departed from Adam and Eve / and from the
daughters that remained with them / than byganne a diversity of people that is
to say: a people of god that was feythful and a people of men that was synful
and infideles. So the scripture after does name the^ / as you shall here
forthwith. And these people were diverse in their manner of living / and
likewise diverse of array So that ye mysordred array or clothing / byganne
first in ye children of Cayn / that were misordred in their living as
infideles departed from god. And ever sithe ye time hederto: has been notable
difference of habit / garments / and array / between ye well ordered people of
god / and the mysordred people caled the children of men / as apperethe i^
ye.vi. Chapitre of Genesis. Gene. 6.
Where is said. Videntes filij dei: filias hominum. etc. That is to say: when
the children of god / his well ordered people: did se and behold the daughters
of men / yt was the mysordred children of cursed Cayn: which (to set forth
and to show out ye beauty of their bodies) did use and find out by new
inue^cions inordinate and wanto^ array. They: that is to say the chosen people
of god / fell in affection of them / and by carnal concupiscence (contrary
unto ye will of god) did marie with them / and company with them where they
should have married of their own people only / and none of them as may appear
by that commandment that god afterward gave in the law: Deu. 7. A.
where he utterly did prohibit and forbid the children of Israel to mary
with infideles Thus apperethe the difference of arye / and what hurt came
thereof. For all fell unto mysorder / so that god drowned all the hole world
except.viii. persons / and al byganne by the occasion of mysordred array.
Difference of array was between Esau as mysordred / and Jacob as well ordered.
Gene. 27.
And so (as I said) that always difference was between ye well ordered and
mysordred persons: scripture does show in many places. In the.xxxiiii.
Chapitre of Genesis: Genesis. 34. A.
is showed how Dina the daughter of Jacob / went forth from her father / and
her own company to se and byholde the women and the variant array of that
contre / and thereby she last her virginite / and caused great murder and
myschefe. And after in the same book / Thamare a wedowe yt was daughter in law
unto Judas one of the.xii. Ibide^. 38.
Patriarchs (by exchau^ge of her araie unto ye form and fasho^ of ye common
unclean women) did deceive her said father in law / and so caused him to
mysuse her body. Sampson also / and Salamon were snared by ye beauty of
infideles: which beauty was set out in show by wantone and mysordred array.
Argument whereof: was showed in Oliferne / that by the beauty of Iudyth: was
lymed / caught / and taken fast / which beauty although it were increaced and
eched by god / yet was it (as scripture shewethe) set forth in show / by the
exchange of her array / from ye sad array of wedowehode: Iudi. 10. A.
unto the light array of wanton persons. So is evident that as light and
mysordred persons / had light and mysordred array. So had the sad and honest
persons their garments / and array according. And that not only in wedowes:
but also in persons married or to be married as appears by Rebecka the mother
of Jacob / that in riding toward her marriage: ware clothes for her co^modite
and ease / but as soon as she saw the honorable person of Isaacke and knew
(by informacion) that he was her spouse unto whom she should be married / she
light down and covered her self (says the scripture) with a pall / or
mantell / a garment of honor and honesty. Gene. 24.
Our lord god himself / put difference of clothing and array: between the
spiritual part of his people of Israel / which was the tribe of Leui. Exodus
28.
And the temporal part of the same people: all the other tribes. And yet when
Aaron / or any of those spiritual persons should do sacrifice / or ministre
unto god: they did change those common garments unto other / ordained for
the same ministry. Here the heretics make objection / saying that the
ceremonies of the old law ben ceased and ended / and of all other: Marci.
14. E.
For when Christ was taken: saint Johan fled (says the gospel) naked yt was
in his cote / and left his pall or mantel behind him. Matthew. 1^. D.
And the garment of Christ was / de super contexta. knytte or wouen all over
and over. So was it notable and yet religious and honorable. So yt it was not
divided / but lot se cast therefore / and much set by. And where they say
that Christ did consecrate in his common / and daily clothes: that was so
(for that time) convenient. For he did than consecrate in a private and secret
manner among his disciples alone / where he made his Apostles priests / and
gave the^ the same auctorite to consecrate without any appoynteme^t of aparell /
or clothing there unto. And so did they after many days / and of long time
consecrate after the same manner privily and secretly / because ye time were
but few persons of ye feythe and believe / and yet had they many enemies. But
afterward wha^ they had gotten / and gadred much people tha^ did they
consecrate in open manner / and did ordeyn and make priests / diacons / and
other ministres / with vestimentes and clothing thereto according. And yet no
man does say yt any clothing is so necessary unto ye co^secracio^: yt no
priests may consecrate without such clothes. For if a priest duly ordered /
would presume or else by ignorance: did say mass / and consecrate in any manner
of clothes / yet should he verily consecrate the very sacrame^te of ye altar /
natwithsta^dyng that he should therein (by disobedience unto ye church)
grievously offend. Furthermore also / ye sacrament that Christ him self did
than consecrate: was not ye full sacrifice and final oblacion for the
redemption of man / but a memorial for ever to endure of that sacrifice / and
oblacion / that was that time to come / and that afterward was performed
fully accompleshed fulfilled and offered up upon ye altar of ye cross by ye
death and resurrexion of our savior for the rede^pcion of all mankind /
which complete and hole sacrifice: is now daily represented i^ the mass / by
the consecracion and oblacion of the holy sacrament / wherefore: if they would
(as they do) contend and hold that we should follow our savior as well in
all his manner of sacrifice / as in vesture and array / we must tha^ be all
naked upon a cross / when so ever we should consecrate. You may se therefore
what wise reasons these men done make / and of what strength. yet here done
they say.

Of reason why in religion / diverse orders have diverse habites. The.xxiiii.
Chapitre.
where unto much may avail to remember that before we have showed of the
effects and causes of garments / that is to say: necessite / co^modite / and
conueniency. For as unto curiosite: we leave out of this treaty or draught. Some
holy fathers of religion than did think and ymagyne because our first
parents / Adam and Eve / had but one manner of habit / one garment alone /
which did serve the^ for all the said effects / that is to say to cover the
nakedness of body / to guard and defend them from the noyance of weders: were
content to devise and ordeyne an habit of the same manner / that should be also
commodious and profitable / comely and honest / and of small price without
curious colors / as nature brought forth. So done the reuerente fathers of
the obseruauntes after the institucion of their patron saint Franciske. And so
done diverse other orders. Some other fathers / considering they had red in
scripture of certain persons / that for great sorrow and for penance to be
done for their sins: did (for the time) use and were garments thereafter
hard / rough / and sharp. And some for the death of their friends and other
chances: did were garments of mournyng as yet ben used in these days / caled
mourning clothes. 2. Re. 12. Jonas. 3.
As of king David for the sekenes of his child. And of the Ninevites that
ware sackes and here / and did cast ashes and dust upon their hedes and
bodes. For these or like occasions: some holy fathers accountynge them self as
perpetual mourners and persons of perpetual penance: did devise their
garments and habit there after / as the fathers of saint Benettes order and
other. Some other holy fathers: considering that manner of habit or garment
(by the example of holy scripture was convenient (by significacion) for some
degrees of persons did ordeyne for their disciples habit after that
consederacion / as (by example) some thought that a white habyte was most
convenient for virgins / because that color does signify and bytoken purite
and cle^nes / which mind they took of ye habyte of Angels / unto whom
virginite (as saint Jerome says) is familier / well known / and of good
acquayntance. Marci. 16. Io. 20. Act. 1. Apoca. 3.4.6.
For scripture shows i^ diverse places: that Angels did appear in white.
Some fathers did make habites of simplicite and mekenes without any curiosite.
And some habites of wisdom and sadness. For (as we said before) it byco^meth
not a wise man to were a foles cote / nor a sad person: a gygges garment /
natwithsta^dyng we se in this miserable time ye matter much misordred For
certeynly (in my mind) if all the wise counsel of England should deuyse a
garment for a gygge / or an unclean common woman / to be represented and
showed in a comedy / or interlude / or common play / they could not all
deuyse a better nor more apt gramente: than such as the ladies / great
estates / and such as should be / and so seem sad persons: done daily were /
and the men (in deed) ben not behind for their parts. But this (mea culpa)
bysede our matter. Some holy fathers also had great deuocio^ to mark their
habytes with holy and devout memorialles / some of the cross of Christ /
some of his wounds / some of the blessed sacrament / and fo forth of other
like / as you daily may se. Thus than have we showed how the variete or
diversity of habit does byco^me or byseme diverse orders of religion:
according unto the institucion and ordinance of holy fathers / that not
without reasonable cause or occasion grounded in scripture and virtue: did
deuyse and ordeyne the same / for the edificacion of all christianes and for to
avoid the occasions and temptacions of ye world / that been given and taken /
by inordinate array / which (as we before have showed) was first found and
bygynne and so has always ben continued: by misordred persons. And how
much misordred array does displease god: Esa. 3. C. D
is showed by the prophet Esaias and the punysheme^t or pain that shall come
thereof / specially unto women / much more than unto religious women if cause
were. 1. Ti. 2. C. 1. Co. 11. A.
Saint Petre does speak also again the same / and saint Paul both and many
holy doctors. This have we said for answer unto the^ that detracte without
cause or good reason: the holy habit of religion.

Of the form or manner of weryng of religious habit. The.xxv. Chapitre.
HEre now daughter may I give you some monicion / for ye form and manner of
the use and werynge of your habyte. For though I have spoken somewhat thereof
upon your rule: yet would I yt you should ponder / wey / and well note the very
words of ye text in the.iiii. Chapitre. Regn. Ca. 4.
Let not your habit (says the letter) be notable / tha^ is ye habit notable
when it is in matter form or shape / or color / or yet in manner of werynge
/ that is: bowynge / dressynge / and ordering of the array upon the places of
the body: different / variaunt / or diverse not according or like unto the
company of the same covent / or unto the most laudable covent of the same same
order. The matter should be all of one clothe / as far as conuenientely may
be / and that clothe / be it woollen or lynen / another to be over fine or over
precious / nor yet over course or over vile. For the tone is a sign of pride /
and the the other of ypocrysie or superstision. A mean is ever best according
unto good honest and profytte. And all (I say) to be one through out the
covent without notable difference / seniorite ever (according unto due manner)
observed. And the form or fashon al one / and that another to short / nor to
side / nor yet to narowe / nor to wide. The length i^ most due convenient
mean is that no part of ye leg appear to be seen: above the back of the
foot / and yet no part of the habit: trayle and follow upon the ground. For
that does the holy father saint Hughe de fa^cto Victore much reprove. Hugo De
institut. nouicio.
The wydnes according without superfluite and unto profytte / and all unto the
quantyte of the persons in like. The color also to be all one / and that can
not be to sad / the general constitucions of the order al way observed. For
surely staring and light colors be nothing convenient for religious
persons. Black for your religion me semethe best to accord with your voels.
In any wise let all be one. For it is surely an uncomely sight / and nothing
according to se i^ one quere some with their manrelles of violette / and yet
those been diverse of the same color. Some black / some tawney / and so
forth all out of good frame / let all (I say) be one excludynge ever all
manner of curiosite and vanites in all other things also / as in rings /
brouches / gyrdels / bedes / knyues / purses / pyncases / gloves / with all
such other / one ring is sufficient / and of the other as of all things to
have yt is necessary in due religious manner with honest and profytte. The use
and manner of ye werynge of your habyte / that is the dressynge or bowynge
should ever be one. I have seen some religious women were rolls / and pastes /
as worldly people / some other frounted / or flyrted up so high yt their here
may be seen / which thing saint Augustine utterly forbedeth in the original
of your rule / as I have there set forth upon the margyne. And some done were
their rochettes or brestclothes so law / and the wymples so narowe: that their
skin may appear and be seen / which thing: nothing becomes relegion /
nor yet (in my mind) any christian. By ware I pray you of all superfluite in
array / for that shall be ever a clogge of conscience / look not what other
persons have. For all be not of like need / your rule is plain therein. Ca. 1.
Be you content to have that is needful for you. And ever think / that (as
your rule says) better is somewhat to want: Ca. 3. in fi.
tha^ to have any thing over much / yt is: whereof you have no need / let this
suffice for the habyte of religion.

Of silence used in religion the second example. The.xxvi. Chapitre.
WHere we promised to show by ye example of a few ceremonies: which the
heretics done mock / that all the residue ben founded upon scripture and good
reason we now shall show the^ an other example of silence / which they say
is a mere and plain supersticion. so mock / and beck with your hands and
fyngers one unto an other / and so show your fellows what you mean or what
you would / where you might speak and with plain words show better your
mind / as all other people done. And sometime of the day you will speak / and
a another time never a word but use such tockes and toyse / as though some
time were more lucky to speak in tha^ a another. And yet when your time is
common: than will you not speak in certain places / but call your fellows out
of that place / as the church / or claustre / as though that place were not
fortunat: or should let you to speak. All is very folysshe in good soth. This
is the objection of the heretics. The hereti.
why sir say they? For it is again nurture and good manner for to interrupte
or break any man's tale / much more for the servant unto the master. The
auctor
So say I: is it again good perfection to let any person to pray / and so to
tell his tale / and to make his peticion unto our lord for ye time assigned or
appointed there unto. The hereti.
But why sir (say they) done you make such signs than and not speak? The
auctor
Why done you (say I) sometime make a sign or a beck unto one of your fellows
(...) that standethe before your master to here his tale when you have need of
him / and done not thane speak and call him unto you / nor yet go rowne in his
ear another? The hereti.
Sir (say they) it is again good manner / to rowne in the souereynes presence
/ or to call any man from him / or without any speech to let his tale / but to
make a beck or sign does little let / if it be made privily and with good
manner Take the same answer for my part (say I) that a prive sign made with
reverence and good manner for a thing necessary does less let or hinder
dedeuocion: than does outward speech. The auctor
The hereti.
But yet (say they) why done you let to speak in the church specially when
you be not at divine service? or yet in the claustre: more than in a another
place? The auctor
Why (say I again) may not every person speak at liberte in the kings prive
chamber: though ye king were (unto their knowelege) absente? or why is it
prohibit and forboden / that people should there rowne or wysper to geder
privily? And why may not a man feed his horse in ye kings hale / or wayshe
dysshes in his chamber when he is absent? The hereti.
Ah sir (say they) The kings chamber is a place of dignite and prerogatyue /
and many things therefore that may be done in other places: may not (by good
nurture) be done there nor said. And also places rowmes / and offices / been
ordained in the kings house / for all things according and as conueniente
is. The stables: for the horses. The hall: for the men. The counsel house: for
the kings counsel. The prive chamber: for the kings private pleasure / and
so forth of other like. I pray you than (say I) The auctor
let it be as convenient and according: that ye church be a place of dignite
and prerogatyfe / only appointed for prayer and contemplacion / and such
divine service due unto god alone. And that the claustre may be a place of
study and of reguler obseruaunce / and so of other places and times of silence
according unto the institucio^ and ordinances of holy fathers. And let this
suffice as for like answer unto their reasons.

Of silence by auctorite of scripture. The.xxvii. Chapitre.
Since yt we have (according unto our promise) answered these menye some what
after their manner / yt is like unto like / now must we for our own part:
show some what how religious silence has foundation / and ground / upon ye
auctorite of holy scripture in both the testamentes. And first for the time of
silence: we may take auctorite in the old testament of ye wise man saying.
Eccle. 3.
Tempus tacendi and tempus loquendi. There is a time of silence: and a time of
speech / where ye holy fathers: done not forgete to note here In silencio et
in spe: erit fortitudo uestra. Esa. 3^.
In holy scripture: the time of silence is preferred and set in order before
the time of speech. Matthew. 15. C. Matthew. 6.
And in the new law: we have for auctorite that our savior kept silence him
self whansometyme he was provoked and required to speak. And also he
commanded his Apostles / ye when they would pray: 1. Reg. 1.
they should not speak much. And the holy saint Anne ye mother of Samuel / when
she prayed says the scripture she spoke not / but only that here lips were
seen scant to move. And for the place of silence: our lord says by his
prophet Amos that with other such punisshement as he there showed should come
unto ye people for sin / the Temple should be desolate / and in every place:
Amos. 8. B
silence (says he) shall be cast out and no thing shall be regarded ne set by.
Matthew. 12.
Our savior in the gospel says: my house is a place of prayer / and not of
geanglynge / or claterynge. Apoc. 8. A.
Saint Johan in the Apocalips says that silence was made / commanded / and
kept in heaven for a time. Esa. 32. D.
And ye prophet Esai / the time shall come (says he) wha^ peace shall be the
work of Justice / and silence shall be the reuerente worshype of the same
justice. The holy Apostell saint James. Iaco. 1. D.
Who so ever done think or judge them self to be religious / and done not
refreyne their tongues (by due silence) their religion (says he) is vain and
void / and nothing worth. 5. q. 4. In loco. Psalm.
The common law does also assent there unto. And the Psalmiste says.
Humiliatus sum, et silui a bonis. I was made meke and brought low and than did
I keep silence from all speech though it were very good / much more than
should we keep silence from those things that were vain or yuell. Psalm. 106.
And in an other place he says: they were glad and joyful / because they had
kept silence. Matthew. 12. C.
The sayng also of our souiour in the gospel of Matthewe / should unto every
feythfull christian be sufficient occasion / to use and to love silence. Sithe
he ye is essensiall truth and might not err / nor lie: said that of every
vain and ydell word: shall we render and make accounte in the general
Judgment.

Of signs to be made in time or place of silence The.xxviii. Chapitre.
AS unto their mockes and checkes of our signs made and used in time or place
of silence / we have answered the^ in their like manner. And yet many we take
for auctorite / that saint Peter and his fellows when they had taken a
multitude of fisshe and had need of help they would not (for reverence of our
savior there present) call unto their fellows for their help: Luce. 5.
but rather made them sign and toke^ there unto / and Martha caled her sister
Marie Magdalen unto our savior by silence / says the gospel. Joan. 11.
Act. 13. C.
And in the acts of the Apostles we read that saint Peter when he was (by the
Angel) delivered out of prison: he came unto his acquayntau^ce / and first he
made (with his hand) a sign of silence before that he would speak. Act. 19. F.
And so did saint Paul a another time i^ like manner / as appears in ye same
acts. The wise man says / if thou have not ready what to speak: put thy finger
upon thy mouth / in token of silence. Catho also says / It never hurt ne
noyed any person to keep silence / but much has noyed and hurt / to have
spoken. The common proverb is: that a word ones spoken: can not be caled
beck again. Wherefore I would advise al religious persons (what so ever the
heretics done say) to give good head and deligence unto their silence
precisely to be kept both for time and place of silence. The time of silence
/ after saint Hughe de sancto Victore (as we have showed upon the rule) is from
the end of colacion before compline: unto ye hour of terre be fully ended /
after our lady mass where ordinare mass ben kept. And again from the first
grace be said before dinner in the fraitour unto ye later grace be ended after
dinner i^ ye church / or else on fasting days: unto benedicite be said of the
president after ye common bear or drinking. And these times (be you sure)
were not appointed of ye old fathers: without reason and good or co^sideracio^ /
according unto the places / that the servants of god in ye forenone (wha^
the mind is most fresshe) should haunt and use the church or secret places
to serve him i^ prayer / meditacion / and contemplacio^ / and in the fraytour:
the word of god that there is red in the lesson: duly and diligentely to be
herd. The residue of ye time: to be spe^de in holy labors study / and
profitable / or necessary occupacions / wherein moderate speech may be used /
so it be ever of good virtue and spiritual edificacion / or at ye least
synles. For words of detraction / or of any sinful yuell. And all manner of
vain and ydell co^municacion contrary unto good religious manner: should every
where / in every time / and in every place: be excluded / esche wed / and
avoided / as a perilous pestilence among religious persons. And thus let this
be as sufficient for this holy ceremony of silence.

Of the reason why religious persons done drink with both the hands.
The.xxix. Chapitre.
YEt shall we set forth a third example of ceremonies which I have often
times herd reproved / and mocked / as a mere and plain supersticion / which
is this: Religious persons done co^mely (when they drink) hold the cup in
both the hands. The hereti.
Here upon they done (after their manner) rail / and gest / saying: that monks
(so done they call all religious persons) done love well drink / and because
they would be sure to have a full draught they ordeyne their boles so great and
large: yt they can not lift a bole with the tone hand / and therefore they take
both the hands. the tone hand were sufficient there unto? If they say it is
the custom and good manner of nurture* I will answer in like wise / and say
the other ceremonie^ is the custom and good manner of religion but some
persons have answered me / that both those obseruaunces ben done: lest any
lycour should fall upon their souereines clothes / or upon the table and be
lost. This answer does somewhat incline and leyne to reason. For in deed
the old fathers / had conscience to lose or spyl any thing that might come
unto the conforte of the poor / and they would say that the crome of bread in
the baskette: or the drop of drink in the tobbe: Cassianus.
shall accuse the negligent persons / if they be lost. We read in the colacion
of the old fathers / of great punissheme^te done for losing only by
negligence / of.iii. graynes of Otemele / and we have seen some persons i^
beryng of a cup curiously: have cast all before their souereynes / and so
playde before you be it laid / where if both the hands had been dilige^tely
put there unto al might have been safe / but let this be for like unto like. For
we done take a better fou^dacion and ground of the gospel / and of the acts
and examples of our savior. For when he brake bread: Matthew. 16. C. Marci. 6.
F. 8. A. 14, E. Luce. 9. B. 22. B. 24. E Io. 6. Matthew. 26. C.
he took it ever in both the hands and would lose not one croume / as we have
i^ the gospel of Matthewe / in Mark / i^ Luke / and in Johan i^ diverse
places. In so much he commanded his disciples (when they had fed the people)
to gather the offalles and leyuinge in baskettes that nothing should perysshe
or be lost. And also in his maundy at the last souper / in the co^secracion
of his holy sacred body / and blood / he took the bread / and after the cup
/ in sacras ac uenerabiles manus suas. in his holy sacred and worshypfull
hands. Marci. 14. C. Luce. 27. B. 24. E. Io. 6. C.
In perpetual remembrance whereof we done always take the cup in both the
hands / wherefore let all good devout christianes: and specially all religious
persons take and apply all unto the best / and what so ever these blasphemous
and blaterynge heretics done say / let them think always the ceremonies of
holy religion were not ordened by the reuerente fathers and holy saints without
good reason and sure ground.

Why religious persons (after a defaulte committed) done touch the ground.
The.iiii. example. The.xxx. Chapitre.
YEt one ceremony mo shall we set forth / where at (as I have both herd and
seen my self before I entered religion) they done laghe and mock. That is to
say when any religious person in syngyng or reading does make defaulte in the
quere: than the custom is and the ordinance also: that ye same person
forthwithe after the defaulte: The hereti.
shall stoop down / and to touch the ground with a finger / whereat they
done laughe and done ascribe it unto a folysshe supersticion / saying: that the
person did tha^ fetch good luck at the ground: to speed better ye next
time / and some have I seen spitte thereat and say / fie on ye folyshe manner /
done (as they say) without ryme or reason. perdon or forgiveness for ye
default. For we have herd in youth of our teachers / yt the wise Seneke said.
Qui sponte fatetur facinus: accipitur tanquam non reus. The person yt wylfully
does knowelege his default is accounted as giltles. And contrary: he yt is
about to excuse or color his defaulte is (among us) taken and iuged as a
double trespasser. For ones he did the offense: which natwithstandynge was
before the excuse were made: ascribed unto chance or negligencie. But the
excuse is ever taken for worse tha^ the offense / and ascribed unto very pride.
Now let the^ in the name of god: think and judge the same i^ religious
persons. For truth it is / yt their stoupynge down and touching the
ground: does (among the^) openly confess ye default. And ye styfe contempt
of ye ceremony does argue (among the^) a stouburne stomach and a proud
heart. Natwithstandynge yet done we take this ceremony of a more high
auctorite / as grounded in scripture. Genesis. 3.
For we done read yt our lord said unto our first father Ada^ / after yt he
had offended. Terra es, et in terra^ ibis. Thou art yerth and i^to yerth shall
thou pass. In remembrance whereof religious persons done forthwt after their
default / in knowlegynge ye same stoop (as we said before) and touch ye
ground. For the wise man says. Eccl. 7. D.
Memento finis: et in eternum non peccabis. Remember thy last end (man) and
thou shalt never do amysse. And yet forthermore we have of ye gospel / ye
when a certain woman was fau^de i^ adultry / and presented unto our savior and
unto him accused / and his judgment required by the cruel Iues there upon
most extremely: Io. 8. B.
he first stouped down and touched the ground and wrote therein with his finger
/ and after reysyng him self / he co^fou^ded pardons (...) the malicious
accusers / and rendered the woman as gylteles / whereby religious persons done
take monicion not only to knowledge there own defaultes mekely: but also to
byware how they done accuse any other persons for any defaulte / though it
seem very evident. Prouer. 18.
For the wise man says. Iustus in principio, accusator est sui. The Just and
ryghtuous person: does in the beginning before he proceed in any judgment:
first accuse him self. For it apperteyneth unto a perfect person: to
ascribe every defaulte unto him self / let this now content you as for
answer unto the heretics for our ceremonies.

Of the conclusion of this first part / that is of ye ceremonies of religion.
The.xxxi. Chapitre.
THus may you (good devout reders) perceive by these few examples: that no
manner of ceremony is in religion / not so much as the leest: but that is
founded upon good and sufficient auctorite / wherefore I hertely byseche you
(good devout religious persons: In uisteribus Jesus Christi. That is: i^ the
tender love of our lord and savior Jesus) that in no wise you give credence
unto this malicious people / which done meruelously delude and deceive their
audience. For they done put the commune unlearned people in credence and believe:
that religious persons done put their confidence and trust all in ceremonies
/ as though by keeping of them only: they should be saved. And by breakyng of
them: they should utterly be dampened / which thing is the convenient and
ymaginacion of their own ungracious mind. For religious persons: never
thought any such. But this they think that by the reverent obseruau^ce and
keeping of the^ unto ye hon^re of god / they may have more grace: the better to
keep their rules and other ordinances and bonds of religion and so
consequently the law of the gospel and ye precepts thereof. For religious
persons done know well enough: that they ben not bound unto their ceremonies
/ nor yet unto every point of their rules: under pain of dedly sin / but
under such peynes as in their books ben assigned and appointed after the
discrecion of ye souereynes / natwithsta^ding: contempt is ever to be fled and
fered or dred. For by contempt a person might sin dedly in doing ye thing
/ yt else were but venial / or (peradventure) no sin at all / let never
therefore any religious persons despise ye holy ceremonies / ne any other
ordinance or good custom of religion. For without doubt they were ordened by
such reverent fathers and holy saints as were endowed with right great and
synguler graces / as well does appear in vitas Patru^. And in ye colacions of
saint Ioha^ cassiane. The ceremonies therefore of religion must nedely be kept
/ of all they yt will be very and unfeigned religious persons / and also kept
in due manner / that is to say: with reverence / devotion / diligence / and dred
of god. For it is i^ manner as a mock unto our lord / to keep the^ with disdeyne
/ rude manner / hasty / and careless boldness / only of custom without devotion /
as they were done only for det / duty / and for ye bondage of ye religion
rather tha^ for ye increace of grace and virtue. For ye pleasure or praise of
outward persons: rather than for any inward affection of heart and mind.
And rather sometime for the servile dread of pain / rebuke and correction tha^
for ye honor and love of god For very and unfeigned love: does work all
things with care and diligence / glad mind and good will if religious
persons would take heed and well remember with how great honor and reverence
/ with how great care and dread / with how great thought and diligence / and how
great labor and pain: yt people of the world done keep their obseruau^ces
and ceremonies unto ye princes and great states yt ben their souereynes and
masters / in curtesy / knelynge / waiting / and standing up right without
sittynge or leinynge bare heded and bare ha^ded in hete and cold / with many
other ceremonies yt ben labourious and peynfull: they should oftymes be sore
abashed and right sore ashamed of the^ self / in doing their duty and
obseruau^ces unto our lord god and unto their souerynes / yt done bear and
use his rowme and place: so dully and so neglige^tly / as oftymes it is done
Our lord god and most sweet savior Jesus: give us al grace to note these
things well / and i^ effect to follow the best Amen. And thus an end of this
first part of our similitude / that is to say: ye wykers that done bind and
keep fast the hopes of our vessel: by ye which wykers: the said ceremonies of
religion contained in the constitucions or statutes ben signified.

The second part of this poor wercke which is of the rules of religion /
concluded shortly in one Chapitre alone.
WE ben loathe to put the reders unto labor / in tournyng again to have redely
the remembrance of our process / and therefore we done the oftener set it forth
where we did assimule and lyken the life of perfection unto a wholesome wine
contained in a Tonne or Pype which co^munely is made of bordes / and those
bordes bound with hopes / and the same hopes fastened with small wykers / so
that if ye wikers break our louce: the hopes sterte of / and all goth to
waste: So (say we) is it by the life of perfection / contained i^ religion /
and religion: by the vows / the vows: by the rules / the rules: by the
ceremonies / whereof now have we entreated for the first part / which
ceremonies (as we said) ben sygnified by the wykers. Now must follow in this
second part of the hopes of our vessel / whereby we done mean and
understand: the rules of every religion / whereof (after the order of our
enterprise and institucio^) we should now here entreat. But because we done
write pri^cipally unto the disciples of our rule which is the rule of saint
Augustyne / which rule (after our poor will and understanding) we have
translated out of Latin into English setting forth the text first i^ Latin
and after in English. And somewhat written and showed our poor mind upon ye
same in declaracion of ye letter. And also we have joined there unto (of our
own tra^slacio^ also) ye profitable exposicio^ of ye great clerk a reverent
father of the same rule and a holy sait caled Hughe de sa^cto Victore: For this
cause (I say) we have here now in this second part: very little to do /
natwithhsta^dyng yet shall I somewhat show of my poor mind under ye form of
counsel / which is this. I think it very profitable and much expedient for all such persons as by ye grace and election of our lord ben moved or stered i^
soul or mind unto religion: that first (after ye due examinacio^ and proof
of their calynge) they appoint the^ self upon some certain aute^tyke religion.
And yet keeping the^ self fre and at liberty of any vow or promise: they make
dilligent means to se and know the rule of the same religion and to have
sufficient understanding thereof other by study or by informacion. For (as we
have written in our prologe upon the said rule) I have known diverse persons
both men and women of diverse monasteries: that were professed years before
they knew or yet herd tell of any rule / but only the term in general saint
Augustynes rule / or saint Benettes rule / and yet over yt some persons could
not tell of what rule they were nor whether they kept any aute^tike rule or
not / they thought and supposed sufficient for them yt they were professed as
the company was where they were / and to live after ye custom of the place /
which custom (in very deed) was far from any rule / and yet had they in
their profession promised to observe and keep a certain rule / and there upon
received ye holy sacrament. The first point tha^ for such persons as would
(after due manner) be good and godly religious persons: is to know and
understand ye rule before they labor in any place for the religion. And for
ye cause we took ye poor labor to translate ye rule of saint Augustyne and
to set forth declaracio^ there upon in ye English tongue / yt no persons
willing to be of ye rule: should justly make excuse by ignorance and defaulte
of knowledge of ye same. And so in like manner of ye other rules / and of ye
co^stitucio^s of ye order / which known well and by due understanding
perceived: I would advise ye persons to prove the^ self in the f^me / whether
they be able in bodily strength and diete / to continue the labors of ye
religion / and whether in lernyng: as syngyng / reding / and other abilites:
they may perform ye duetes of ye same. For (as afte^ we have said) every good
and virtuous person: is not mete to be a good religious person / proof
therefore is good before the habit be received. For after the person be
admitted: a year of proof is by the law appointed. For when the profession is
performed and solemnized / than is not due time to study for the knowelege of
the duete / but rather with care / diligence / and good awayte / to perform
and keep the promise. A wise man says. Antea quam incipias: consulto,
Salustius.
et postquam consulueris mature: opus est facto. Before thou begin any sad
matter: it is good and convenient to have good counsel. And after that thou
depely and thoroughly haste counsayled and taken good aduisement / tha^ maiste
thou boldly go forth with thy purpose / and perform the same. And yet let
no devout religious person: think it enough to perform and barely to keep
the letter of the rule / but rather with all due reverence / devotion / and
fervent desire of heart to attain unto the presice and most high perfection
of the same. And (for the love of our lord) let no professed persons make
excuse of any article or point of their rule / by any foreuse or custom of
their place contrary unto the same. For (douteles) that excuse shall nothing
serve: before the presence of our lord god / I ever except dispensacion /
where with we will not meddell. Now let this one Chapitre / with our said
labors upon the said rule of saint Augustine / content you for this second
part of our example of the houppes of our vessel / where by ye rules of
religion ben signified where rules were ordained by the holy fathers: for the
more sure holding and precise keeping the vows / which ben signified by ye
bordes of the Pype: or vessel / where of now shall follow by order.

The third part of this work of the three essencialles of religion /
obedience / wylfull pouerte / and chastity. And first of obedience / and the
definicion thereof The first Chapitre.
A Pype co^munely is made of bordes / as ye great substance of ye vessel /
which bordes duly framed and compassed with hopes / and the same hopes
fastened with wykers: done acco^plysshe the vessel ready to hold wine. Of the
which wykers and hopes / werby the ceremonies / constitucions / and ye rules
of religion ben signified / which we have entreated. Here now must follow of
the bordes / which we done appoint.iii. in nombre whereby the.iii. parts of
religion caled essensialles: ben signified / and therefore this part must be
divided in.iii. principal members / obedience / wylfull pouerte / and chastity
/ as the substanciall parts of religion monastical whereof we do now
entreat. The first membre than shall be obedience / as the first board of our
vessel / and so forth of the other twain by order. First we shall begin
with the definicion of obedience / that is to say: to show unto you what
thing obedience is / and what is meant by the self term or word obedience /
both as it does apperteyne unto all christianes generally / and also unto
religious persons specially. Difinitio ^enerall.
First than / Obedience general: is an applicacio^ / or grant of heart /
mind / and will / unto the due and the lawful precepts / or commandments
of the right and ordinary superiors / according unto the ordinance of god
and of his church catholic / after the rules of holy scripture. And this
obedience: does apperteyne unto al christianes. But as it does apperteyne
unto religious persons as one of their essenciales: Alia defi.
whereof we done here now entreat. Obedience is a wylful and utter abnegacion
and forsakyng of proper will / and an obligacion or bound unto the will of the
souereyne / in all things that been lawful and reasonable / according unto
the rules / constitucions / and ordinances / of that order or of that
religion: where the profession and promise is made. Here note well and mark:
that i^ these definisio^s or determinacio^s of obedience / ben these terms or
words put into ye same / that is to say: 12. q^. terti. Quid ergo Ambrosius
de paradiso. Ca. 6. Thomas scde. scde. q^. 104. and 11. q^. tertia Quid ergo
due and lawful / and also lawful and reasonable. For that thing that is not
lawful and reasonable / that is to say: sin / or yuel may never be done by
any manner of obedience. Natwithstandyng: that thing that is good and honest
may be omitted or left undone by good and meritorious obedience / so the
person obediencer: be not bound by ye law of god or ye ordinance of ye
church unto good deed. For ye law of god and ye decrees of ye church: must
nedely be kept / rather tha^ ye contrary commandment of any souereyne /
thus have you the definicion or determinacion / and declaracion of this term
obedience / what thing is meant thereby.

Of the diuersites of obedience. The second Chapitre.
Now may co^uenie^tly follow of ye division and diuersites of obide^ce / that
is say how many manners ben of obedience. For one obedience caled an obedience
of pleasure or profyt / an other is obedience of necessite or need / yt.iii. an
obedience of fere and dread / yt.iiii. done for pleasure / profit / need / or
dread / yet if it be done but only for the bond and duty of the vow and
promise made before in profession: that obedience shall not be without merit
and reward / because the bond there unto was wylfully made for the love of
god and his laws / and so is it of any obedience done by any christian for ye
duty and bond of his baptysme. For though a christian would fulfill the
obedience of ye laws of god and his church only for the fere and dread of
dampnacion and of the peynes due there unto: and so should have no merit
therefore / yet is it not that obedience without profit. For (at the least) the
person should have the less pain / and if that fere of dampnacion: were
rather for the loss of the favor of god / and of his presence than for the
peynes of hell: the continuau^ce than of that obedience should obtain grace /
so that ye fere and dread should turn unto love. So (at ye least) that the
persons should will and wysshe they kept that obedience only for the love of
god / which semethe unto their minds: they done keep only for dread. And I
dare well say: that will shall not be with out reward of grace / specially if it
be caled fore and insued. It is therefore a good surety for every person to
keep duly obedience / whether it be kept ryghtly and wylfully for love / or
caytyuely byforce / for dread.

How to know or to conjecture when obedience is wylfully done for due love /
and when not and so consequentely to conjecture when disobedience or any other
sin: is dedly or venial. The.iii. Chapitre.
HEre (although in manner by a digression) we think it profitable for such
simple persons as be scrupulouse in conscience to know or (at the leest) to
conjecture: when their obedience is done ryghtely of good will / and wha^ not.
For the knowledge whereof: we must first consider not only after the doctrine
of philosophy: To. 7. D. 2. Cor. 4. D
but also of holy scripture / that every person is a double man / that is to
say: compou^de and made of two men / that is: of the outward man that is
caled the body or the flesh / and of the inward man: that is caled the soul
or the spirit / between which two men: is ever war and battle continual /
without any truce accordynde unto the which two men: every person has two
wylles. One is the will of the flesh / yt continually is moved and ruled by
se^sualite and by corrupt and blinded reason or fantasy. The other is the will
of the spirit / which ever is moved by grace and ruled by right reason. Now
for ye example of obedience according unto these two wylles / let us put ye
pri^cipal precepts or commandments of god / the love of him above all
things / and ye neghbour as our self. The will of ye spirit moved by grace
and ordered by right reason: will forthwt without stoppage assent and redely be
obedient there unto. But wha^ ye time and place done require and move ye
person i^ conscience to put these commandments in effect: and to work and
fulfill the^ in deed: tha^ does yt will of ye flesh: moved by se^sualite /
and persuaded by corrupt reason / and blinded affection: stycke and stop
thereat and rebel there against and so here begins ye battle. If tha^ ye
person incline and leine unto the mocion of grace and contrary unto the will
of the flesh and so perform ye commandments and bring it unto effect:
tha^ has the spirit ye victory and the obedience is wylfull and the
commandment duly observed with the good will of ye person / although it
seem unto the self person (because of the resiste^ce of the sensual will) to
be again his will. But if ye person do incline and leyne unto the mocion of
sensualite and corrupted reason and so render the will of ye spirit feynt and
feeble: than does the flesh vanquysshe and preueyle / and so does cause the
person to be disobedient / and to break the commandment / which the person
may do in diverse manners / that is: by obstinacy / by ignorance / or by
fraylte. The precepte is broken by obstinacy: wha^ it is done by the due
knowledge of ye person and full deliberacio^ wyttynly (as they say) and
wyllyngly / and than is ye transgression or brekynge of ye commandment: always
dedly si^ne. Than is the precepte broken by ignorance: when the person has
not right and due knowledge of the precepte and yt may be yet i^ two manners. For
other yt ignorance is of that thing that ye person was bound to know and by
his own defaulte is ignorant thereof / because he gave not due diligence to
have ye knowledge thereof and than is that ignorance hardely excused in any
case: of dedly sin / or else the ignorance is of that precepte that the
person is not bound to know / and if he had knowledge thereof: he would not in
any wise break it / and than is that ignorance venial sin / and like wise
of that defaulte that is done by frailte of sodeyn passion / but not so of that
frailte that is of full knowelege and delyberacion.

Example here of may we have of oaths or swerynge. For if a person were caled
before a judge having just power to require an oath and there would by good
deliberacio^ and full knowledge wittyngly swear contrary unto his conscience:
ye oath is ever dedly sin / because of the transgression by obstinacy and
contempt of the precepte and commandment of god. And likewise of them that
by contempt with full deliberacion done horribly blaspheme god or the name or
members of god / although without constraynte or request. But if a person by
ignorance did swear false / supposing and byleuynge he swear true: than is it
venial / and so of the^ that done think and believe that to swear yt is troth
is no sin. To swear by custom without full deliberacion: is co^munely venial
/ or yet contrary unto custom: if it by done by sodeyne passion of fraylty.
Thus now may appear / that only disobedience by contempt is dedly sin and
how a person does break or keep obedience wylfully / natwithstanding the
venial and vnwylfull disobedience by negligence / ignorance or fraylte as is
said: does not excuse from the pain due therefore / except due remedy be had /
which remedy stands first in the contricion and due displeasure for the
offense of god / and tha^ does the due and worthy receyuyng of any sacrament /
or (after some doctors) any sacrame^tales / as of halewater / or halebreade /
the bysshopes blessing / the sight of the sacrament with such other: done put
a way both the sin and the pain due therefore. For sithe we have of custom
such daily sins: with out which we can not lyghtely pass this mortal life
(as saint Augustyne says) It is necessary yt we have daily and ready remedy /
without which: our lord god never left his people. But here unto some
scripulouse persons have said unto me. Sir al doctors done preach / that no
manner of remedy can be sufficient to the purgacion and remission of sins:
except the sinner have mind / will and purpose to forsake utterly the sin
and to amend the same. And I am (says this frail person) in such case in
my conscience: that I can not say I will amend and forsake some manner of
sins / where unto I am daily acustomed. And though I say and also think
verily in my heart that I will amend: yet do I prove afterward in effect:
that I do not amend / but fall again the next day into ye same custom.
How can I say than or promise that I will amend? as in case / I do feed /
eat / or drink / so that I pass due temperau^ce therein unto ye grudge of my
conscience / which (when the matter is paste) does show me that I exceded and
much less would have contented nature / and that I took some things: more
for pleasure than for need / unto the grefe rather tha^ unto the comfort of
nature. And i^ like manner / when I fall in co^municacion or talk: I excede in
words that been vain and myspende the time therein wherewith afterward I
grudge i^ conscience. And yet although I be much disconte^ted and displeased
with my self for these frayltes and such other / and though also I think
verily and purpose to amend: yet can I not promise to amend / nor yet can I
not think nor believe that I shall amend / ye experience so often does prove
the contrary. For ye custom is so grounded of so long time: that (I think)
I can not amend it. despysynge the law of god / as setting naught thereby or
carynge little therefore / and than is that (as we said) always dedly sin if
it be done by deliberacio^ and knowlede / and the custom thereof is ever more
dedly sin / which manner of sine can never be so accustomed but that the
person caling for grace: may amend lyghtely if he will. Other sins there
ben (as we said before) without which (after saint Augustyne) we can not
lyghtely pass this mortal life / that been done by fraylte / ignorance / or
negligence / that been venial. Sir says the frayse person: I mean no thing
of dedly sin done by contempt. For I am right sorry for my defaulte / but
yet my frayltie is such: conclude / ye (after mine opinion) you can not have a
more sure and ready mean to obtain grace and forgyuenes of your daily sins:
than to mistruste your self / and so to despair of your self. And tha^ to
put all your hole hope and trust in the mercy and goodness of our lord god /
that does know the will of your sperite / although the will and law of the
flesh: does (of fraylte) vanquysshe for the time / and yet I would advise
you to offer your self unto our lord saying or thinking / good lord:
although I dyspayre of mine own infirmite feebleness and fraylte: yet do I
nothing despair of thy great power and might / where I may not lord / thou
may / where I can not: thou canste. And where my carnal will is
inconstante: thy bounty grace and goodness is ever one / whereunto: I holy
commit my self. And therein do put all my hope and trust. And this manner and
consideracion (I think) shall be a good and sufficient mean that the
sacraments / sacramentales with the common merits of Christ's church and
the prayers of holy saints may have effect in your soul / unto remission of
your sins. This have we said by disgression not without instant request /
upon the occasion of well willing obedience.

Of the forther division or diuersites of obedience The fourth Chapitre.
Now let us return again unto our matter of obedience. For we left in
showing the diuersites of obedience / which (as we said) been in many manners
/ as the obedience of pleasure or profit / of need or necessite / and of fere
and dread which manner of obediences: ben both unto man and beast common /
other by the disposicion of nature / or else by force and compulsion / and
therefore been they as we said of little merit / but not clean and utterly
without merit as before we have declared / we must now therefore seek and
search forther for an other obedience that may be of more merit / and that is
caled the obedience of love / which is when a person (for the love of god /
and for ye more right / streght and more sure mean to work his will and
pleasure and to follow the pathe and very way of life / that is to say: the
steps and exambles / the commandments and cou^sayles of our lord and
savior Jesus) does put himself (by promise and vow) wylfully subject in all
due obedience unto a souereyne / that (by ye auctorite of ye church) does bear
the rowme and use the person of our said savior. The diffinicio^ of which
obedience: we have set forth before. Of this manner of obedience: is our mind
to speak and entreat and afterward of the other two vows / wylfull pouerte /
and chastity.

Of the laud / praise / and excellency / of this obedience. The.v. Chapitre.
IN the order of these vows: we done begin with this virtue of obedience /
because of the excellency thereof oboue other virtues. For obedience is next in
order of dignite: unto the.iii. divine virtues / caled theological / that is
to say: seythe / hope / and charity. For though obedience do seem and is i^
deed: the daughter of humilite and mekenes. yet is it of more perfection than
is her mother mekenes / a like example of charity. For though Charity be the
most high and excellent virtue in dignite: yet is operacion and evident work
of a good deed in effect the probacion proof and perfection of charity. So
that if it be true and unfeigned charity: it must nedly work and bring forth
good deeds / and if it does not work and do good deeds: it is not true / but
rather a similitude or a shadow of charity. So is it in like manner of humilite
or mekenes / the very proof whereof in effect: is obedience. For obedience
does make humilite perfect / as euidentely was proved in the first and most
excellent reasonable creatures / Angels and man / which: were both create
in the most high perfection possible unto their nature and kind: in all
virtues / but when the proof of mekenes should in effect (by the liberte and
fredome of will) come to pass in the work and be showed and set forth in deed
by obience: therein did they both feyle and offe^de unto there own great fall
and grievous hurt of all us / wherein does openly appear yt this lady obedience
is the mother and maystres and nurse of all other virtues. Gregorius ultimo
moralium.
For obedience does not only engender / bygette and bring forth other
virtues in the soul of man: but also does noryshe and feed them therein and
(as a fure guard and keeper) does gyde and preserve them continually / obedience
must than nedely be a noble and excellent virtue. Compare it unto martyrdom /
which in very deed is an excellent sacrifice: 8. q^. 1. Sci.
yet (as saint Gregory says upon this text Melior est obediencia quam
uictima) The body only is in martyrdom slain and offered / but in obedience
is the proper will slain and the soul offered in sweet sacrifice unto our
lord / and so is obedience: a precious kind and manner of martyrdom. yet
forthermore / obedience is a lady souereyne and a maystres imperious / having
auctorite of precepte and commandment over all creatures / unto whom also
(as scripture says) god him self was inclyned / as obedient unto the voice
and desire of man. Iosue. 10.
And also almighty god in all the promyses and acts of our salvation: did
wylfully bind him self to be obedient unto ye perfourmau^ce of the same.
Obedience is also natural unto all creatures. For all creatures ben naturally
obedient / not only unto god their maker: but also every creature unto other
according unto the degrye and order of their nature / as in Angels: the
lower / in order^: ben obedient unto the higher. And the bodies bynethe: unto
the bodies above. And all the world unto mankind duly ordered / so that all
creatures by ye co^dicio^ of their creacio^: ben ordened of god naturally
obedient. Obedience is also so necessary unto man: that without obedience none
other virtue may profytte or avail unto our salvation. For the virtue of
feythe: without which no person may please god / though it were as strong
that (as saint Pale says) it might remove mountes: 1. Cor. 13. A
yet with out obedience: it should much noye and hinder the person: rather tha^
promote or profytte unto grace For the person that has most strong and
constant true feithe and would (for the same) rather suffer death than forsake
it / should without due obedience be in worse case and degree of salvation tha^
the Turk / Iue / Sarasyne / or any other infideles and feythles persons / as
ben in deed all manner of heretykes. And hope without obedience: is dampnable
presu^pcion And Charity without obedience: is false feynynge flaterye. Go
forther now unto the acts of merit / as fasting / waytche / prayer / and
pilgrimage / alms / and all penitenciall acts: been without obedience:
clearly lost after saint Augustyne. De obediencia et humilita. Ca. 1. 8. q^. 1.
Sciendu^ in fi.
Obedience therefore is the virtue that does obtain and get ye merit of all
virtues. And (as we said) without obedience: the christian is in like state
and condition with the infidele and hethen man. Although he seem to have good
feythe. And (to conclude) no virtue moral: does so much please god as does
obedience. And therefore is obedience better and more excellent than all other
virtues moral which thing should be a great occasion unto all persons that
would be virtuous: Aug. ubi supra.
to laud and love this noble virtue of obedience.

Unto whom obedience is due. The.vi. Chapitre.
Sith now we have showed what obedience is by definicion and also ye
diversity and excellency thereof it semethe convenient to show who may and
should of right take and have obedience / unto whom it is due you know well by
reason and also by that we have said that obedience is due of all creatures
unto almighty god / and of all christianes also is obedience due unto them that
done use / this person as the Pope / the bysshopes / curates / and such
other. And also unto the parents of the children. For by the law / children
been bound to be obediente unto the fathers and mothers. And the subjects of
every realm: unto their kings and princes / and the servants: unto the
lords / and wives unto their housbandes. But our matter is not of these
obediences / but of the obedience of religious persons that been solemly
professed: due unto their souereynes which souereynes also as well as their
subjects: ben bound unto the due obedience of their rules and ordinances.
Natwithsta^dynge: because ye souereynes done bear the rowme and use the place
and person of our lord and savior Jesus: and must (as is said in the rule)
render and yield accounte for the subjects: therefore (I say) the subjects
(byonde the obedience of the rule and ordinances) must also be obedient unto
the souereynes. So that contrary unto their precepts and commandments:
they no thing do / not so much as the least thing. If the natural child
be bound to be obedient unto the natural parents: much more been the
spiritual children unto the spiritual parents bound. So much more I say:
as the soul is above the body / or the spirit above the flesh. Ephesi. 6.
Colo. 3.
And the seculer subjects been bound (by scripture) to be obedient unto their
seculer princes and souereynes as they should be obedient (says saint Paul)
unto our lord god And Peter does command his disciples to be obedient unto
their souereines although they were vicious. Ebre. 13. 1. Petri. 2.
Much more than ben religious persons bound to be obedient unto their
souereynes that been good and virtuous / specially sithe (by sole^pne vow and
profession) they have made promise there unto. But here done these great
heretykes: much delude and deceive the people. For thy done say and write
also / that (by the very same auctorites of saint Peter and Paul that we spoke
of) all manner of persons as well spiritual as temporal should be obedient
unto the profane and seculer princes / and ye none obedience is due unto any
persons of the spiritualte or clergy. For (they say) that none such
obedience was commanded of the Apostles / but only (as I said) unto the
temporal princes. And over that they say / that Christ him self was obedient
in his body and goods unto the Emperors deputes Pylate / Herod / and such
other that both received trybute of Christ / and also in their court iuged
him. And Paul (say they) also appealed unto the Emperor that was a temporal
person / and not unto any spiritual judge of ye clergy / wherefore they
conclude / there should be no such obedience unto any spiritual persons. For
(they say) there been no spiritual persons but only the servants of ye
dyuell. the Christian princes / unto hethen princes / yt by most cruel
tyranny did persecute and destroy the right feythe / yet (say they) saint
Paul did command his disciples to be unto these princes obediente / truth
say I in all their laws that were not contrary unto the feythe of Christ /
while they were under their tyranny and lordshippe / so been now many good
christianes under ye Turk / unto whose laws: they may and should be obedient
(while they live under him) in all (as I said) that been not contrary unto the
feythe of Christ. And so did Christ him self pay ye tribute unto the
Emperor not of any duete as right: but as under their rule and dominacion.
Sir: say they: So may every christian prince more reasonably take of his
subjects obedience. This say I: is the laud they give unto their princes /
they would (I say) make them tyrannes as the hethen hounds ben. And because
Christ would wylfully suffer tyranny and wrong both in his goods and body for
the love of man / and because that his Apostles and many other holy men did in
like manner suffer for his love: therefore would they it should be lawful for
christian princes to do as ye hethen hounds did. Saint Paul made appellacion
unto the Emperor when he was unjustly vexed under the power of them that were
subjects unto the Emperor and hethen as he was. But where done they read that
saint Paul or any of ye Apostles did appele from any christian power unto a
another? 1. Cor. 6. A.
Saint Paul was disco^tent with his disciples because that in their seculer
causes they would sue and plead before the hethen iuges / and that rather they
would not among them self chose certain persons to be judges in such
causes / and those iuges should be of the most vile presones among them. For
those he thought good enough to meddell with seculer causes / let all the
heretics show: if ever any of the Apostles or any of their disciples in the
first beginning of the church: were subject and under the obedience of any
christian princes. But contrary they shall find that kings as soon as they
were converted to Christ's feythe and baptized and so christianes: they
forthwith left and put away their Dyademes and crowns: Vt in lege^ ad Matt.
Apostoli.
and were subjects unto the clergy and under their obedience. And shortly to
conclude: they shall find by the order of all scripture as well in the old
testament as in the new: that evermore the spiritual part of the people of
god: had the governance and rule of the temporal part / and the temporal
part in all things obedient unto the spiritual. Christ (as we said in the
first part of this work) was lord of all his flock / as well in temporalte
as spiritualte / yet these heretics say that Christ would give no judgment
between two brethren ye strove for temporaltes / but asked who made him judge
between them: And I say again / they were none of his flock but when his
own flock byganne to strive for temporal power: he took than quyckely the
Judgment in hand and satisfied the parties. The Apostles after Christ's
Asce^cion: were the souereynes of al christianes and took and also required of
them due obedience / as well in temporaltes as spiritualtes / which thing
does plainly appear in Ananie and his wife Saphira / that for the defraudynge
and deceyt of their temporal goods: were iuged (by saint Peter) and suffered
death. Act. 5. A.
Did not saint Paul commit the charge and governance of all the christianes
that he had converted: unto Timothe / Tite / Appollo / and such other
spiritual fathers / whom he had made bysshopes / prestes / and deacons /
among them? Saint Ignacius also / that was disciple unto the Apostles i^ his
epistoles unto the christian people wrytteth / that they should nothing do
without the commandment condicte and counsel of the prestes / or else of the
diacons that were ordened their gouernoures and gyders. Forther than to
conclude. All manner of christian princes / Emperoures / Kings / and such
other temporal rulers of the people: done yet unto this day in their
consecracions and coronacions: receive the auctorite of their power of the
spiritual part of Christ's church / and done make solemn oath of their
obedience thereunto. So that evermore among the well ordered people of god: the
temporal or seculer persons: have been bound unto the obedience of the
spiritual persons. And not contrary as these falls heretics: done flater the
seculer princes. For the great heretyke Tyndall / wrytethe in his English
book of obedience: that there is no spiritual part in Christ's church / but
the dyuels lymmes. For he says the dyuell is a spirit / and all the
spiritual part is the flock (says he) of the dyuell. And I say thereunto
that where he says the dyuell is a spirit: he says truth / and I grant
thereunto. But I say again / that god is also a spirit. The dyuell is any
yeuell spirit / and god is the good spirit / and maker and governor lord
and master of al good spirits. And he create and made the dyuell: a good and
glorious spirit / but he (as a falls apostata) made him self an yuell spirit
/ and does continue the lord and master of all apostatas / of Tyndall (I
say) and of his master Luther with all their disciples. And our lord god is
also a spirit and a good spirit / and the governor and gyder of his flock
as well spiritual as temporal. For our savior has made and ordered his
church like unto him self in the end of the world as in the beginning he
made first the hole world of two parts / one spiritual and heavenly. And the
other bodily and yerthly. Gene. 1. A.
In principio (says the scripture) creauit deus celum et terram. God in the
beginning / has made heaven and yerthe Heaven is the spiritual part / and
the yerthe is the bodily and seculer part. And yet both one and the same
self world. The spiritual part: was ordened of god to have governance and
dominacio^ of the temporal part / and the temporal part: to be duly
obedient unto the spiritual part / and not contrary. Afterward he made an
other less world that is to say his most loving creature man / and this
less world he made also of two parts / a spiritual and temporal / a soul
and a body and both one man / the soul to rule the body. And the body to be
obedient unto the soul and not contrary. Than made he the kind of man also
in two parts or persons / that was male and female and those to be one kind
and by lawful conjunction to be one flesh / the male nevertheless: to have
governance of the female / and the female to be obedient unto the male / that
is the woman unto the man and not contrary. yet forther / after the fall of
man by sin / he made (for the redemption and byenge again of man) a
wonderful creature upon yerthe / an other new Ada^ / and him also of two
parts / of god and man / and yet one Christ / that is to say: one and ye
self same person. The godhed ever to have dominacion of the manhed. And the
manhed to be ever obedient unto the godhed / and not contrary. After the same
manner than / has our lord founded and ordened his church / that is to say:
to be one and ye self same church as he was and is one Christ / and yet the
same church to be of two parts / as Christ was of god and man / that is of
the spiritualte / and of the temporalte. And so was the church in ye old
testament as we have showed and in the new law of Christ's ordinance also /
as of the Apostles and disciples as of the spiritualte: and of the other
multitude of the people of all degres / princes / mean folks / and poor
folks / men / women / and children. And after the same order: has the people
ben divided also among all the infideles and hethen hounds / that is to say:
of such persons as did minister unto their gods as spiritual persons /
that did always sacrifice for the other part of temporal and so ben yet among
the turks and al other infideles and hethen people / except only that the
order of obedience is transuersed and turned / vpsetdowne / that is contrary
unto the very christianite. For among them the temporal persons have the
dominacion and rule / and their spiritual part is holde^ under and (by
violence) kept obedient unto the te^porall part. And unto this order of
gentilite: done these heretics (by falls flatery) persuade the seculer princes
and their people / that is to say: to make the^ infideles and hethen folks
rather than very christianes: in peruertynge the order of our lord god and of
our savior Christ / and so despisynge and setting him at naught. Luce. 10.
For he said unto his Apostles and not unto any seculer persons: Qui uos
audit: me audit, et qui uos spernit: me spernit. Who so ever (says he) does
obey / or is obedient unto you: is obedient unto me / and who so does despise
you: does despise and set me at naught / it follows not therefore: that
although the hethen princes done require obedience of their spiritualte: yt
christian princes should or may lawfully do in like manner of the clergy of
Christ / yet done these heretics say: that the spiritualte as well as the
temporalte: must in every realm be obedient unto the laws of the same / and
than may the king or prince require obedience of al the^. Unto this I say /
that (after the perfection of Christ's order) no temporal law may bind any
spiritual person / except it be granted or ratified by a decre of the Pope
and his Cardinals or by a general counsel. And therefore these heretics
done delude and deceive utterly all them that does give any credence unto them.
This have we said as be degressio^: unto Tyndalles english book / yt arche
heretic. Now than to return again unto our matter: I say the subjects of
religion: been more streytely bound unto the obedience of their souereygne:
than other been / because of their vow. And yet not only bound obedient unto
the self souereynes: but also unto the seniores and officers appoi^ted by ye
souereynes accordi^ge unto ye ordinance and custom of the religion. For (as we
said before) the souereines done bear the rowme and use the person of our
savior Christ / that said unto his disciples: Luce. 10.
Qui nos audit: me audit, et qui nos spernit: me spernit. Who so herethe and
obeyth you: does here and obey me. And who so does despise you: does despise
me. All one than is it for the subjects: to obey or disobey the souereyne /
and to be obedient or in obedient unto the officers and seniores appoi^ted by
the souereynes (in their absence) to be obeyde. But here have I herd of some
froward subjects that would say / that sometime: as well ye self souereynes
as their officers / done many times bid and command prohibitte or forbed
without ryme or reason / and beyond or above the power of the pore subjects.
And also such things as they would never do the^ self before they were in
rowme. And often times done they make as much a do of a tryfle or a small
thing as though it were a great matter yt should destroy the hole religion.
Unto such manner of persons: saint Paul does answer. Answer. To. 14, A.
Who art thou (says he) that do presume to judge and condemn an other
man's servant? Of what perfection than is that religious subject / that does
not only judge an other man's servant: but also the servant of god / vsyng
(as we said before) his rowme and person / and yet forthermore his own
souereine unto whom (by solemn vow and promise) he is subject? Ad rusti.
monachu^. to. 1. B. De prece. er dispens.
Saint Jerome says we should judge and suppose ever ye best of our souereynes.
And he will not i^ any wise and so saint Bernarde says also: ye we should judge
our souereynes / nor in any thing murmr or grudge again them / ne gladly
suffer any other so to do / but (in as much as we may) we should let all
such grudges / and do what we can to appease the parties. For if we murmr or
grudge (says saint Bernarde) with that thing that is commanded us / and
tha^ begin to judge the souereyne therein: Ibidem.
than done we lose all the merit although we do accomplysshe and fulfill the
commandment. Hilarem datorem diligit deus. 2. Co. 9. B.
Our lord god says saint Paul) loves that person: that does with good
will and glad mind his duete. For in the deed done with murmr: is no
patience but rather a cloak and color of malice. Much therefore should the
murmuring persons dread and fear the sentence and judgment of god given upon
Marie sister unto Moses for her murmuring and grudgynge again him that was
her souereyne and spiritual father. And sithe in holy scripture: Numeri. 12. C.
many great co^minacions and thretes been given and made unto them that been
contrarious unto their natural parents: Deutro. 21. D.
much more than should all persons fear and dread to be contrarious and
disobedient unto their spiritual parents and specially religious persons
unto their hedes and souereynes / what so ever they be / good or bad. For in
nothing it apperteyneth unto the subject: to be a judge and to control: but
rather to be iuged and to be controlled. The souereines have great labors and
done bide many dangers and ieopartyes for their subjects. For they ben often
troubled and have to do with many things / and therefore may they the rather
be over seen and be negligent and forgetful / it is a thing much dangerous
and of great difficulte: to inserue and content the minds of many persons.
And never man: has always contented the mind of al persons / no: not
christ him self. The subjects therefore should i^ no wise judge / murmr / ne
grudge again their souereynes / but rather (as the rule says) have compassion
and pity upon them and receive both their commandments and prohibicions:
Ca. 7.
Bernardus de precep. et dispens.
as they would receive the bidding or forbyddynge of our lord god and savior
Jesus Christ / whose rowme and place (as often is said) they done bear and use.
But many religious persons: ben of such conditions as we read of in vitas
Patrum. A disciple came unto an aged father / to ask counsel saying. Father
(said he) I have soght many places to find ones an abbotte or a souereyne
after mine own heart and mind. For if I could find (said he) such a father:
I would be as obediente as any disciple / whereunto the good father said / that
thing that you speak: is as much to say in effect: as that you would be a
souereyne your self and not a disciple. For if the souereyne were always af
your mind tha^ should you rule and govern the souereyne and not the souereyne
you. The chief merit of obedience is to perform the precepte of the
souereyne in those things that been contrary to the mind and will of the
subject. And for that end and cause of merit the subject in the obedience
of profession does give freely from him self all self and proper will / so
utterly: ye he may never laufully call it back again unto him self / and if
he do: than does he break the promise of his solemn profession / and also
does become a these or a robber of such good as is not his. For that thing
that any person has freely given from him self and has delivered possession
thereof: is not his ne any thing does more apperteyne unto him than if it had
never ben his. But every professed person has so given from him proper will:
ergo it may never be his again / except you would think that the souereyne
might give it unto him again as a temporal gift may be given: And that can
not ben in any wise. For the pope him self can not dispens with obedience as
he says in a decretall. li. 3. De statu monacoru^ Cu^ admo.
De statu monacorum. Ca. Cum ad monasterium. The more therefore the obedience be
contrary unto the proper will of the subjects: the more thankful is it and
the more meritorious. Thus now have we showed: unto whom obedience is due /
that is to say: not only unto the souereynes: but also unto the seniores and
officers using their rowmes / and by them thereunto appointed / yet here was I
asked what manner of persons might lawfully take obedience. And thereunto I said
/ that we do here entreat only of that obedience ye is vowed and promised by
solemn profession after or according unto some of the rules incorporate in
ye law and that obedience: may no person take as souereyne: but such as ben
elect and chosen by canonical election to be a head and souereyne of a
couente company or congregation / as bysshopes abbottes / or priores with such
other of both the sexes / if any other persons done take such obedience: I
thynk it be taken by dispe^sacion / as I have herd of some masters of /
hospitales or alms houses. There ben degrees of other particular obediences
made unto sole synguler persons for their time or for ever / whereof: is not
our institute or purpose here to entreat.

Wherein / or in what manner of things: obedience is due. The.vii. Chapitre.
HEre may conuenientely follow / wherein and in what manner of things the
subjects ben bound unto the said obedience. For (as we said before) in such
things as ben contrary unto the laws of god or the the ordinance of the
church: no subjects may be obedient unto any souereyne. For scripture says.
Act. 5. C.
Magis est obediendum deo, quam hominibus. We must rather obey god than man /
or after ye more streyte letter / obedience is more due unto god than unto man.
And also in such things as the subjects done know well: ben directely
again the rule of their profession / should they not lightly and gladly obey.
Lyghtely I mean: without deliberacio^ / and gladly: for self pleasure or
co^modite. For in such points: the subjects may stop and stycke somewhat
there at / but not utterly deney / ne ever should a subject say I will not.
But rather lyce^ce (after religious discipline) asked to speak: than (with sobre
words and meke reuerente byhauioure) to show the souereyne saying. This
thing is contrary unto our rule or ordinance / and yet not with standing:
if the souereyne will nedely so continue in his commandment natwithstandyng
the knowledge and remembrance of the rule: than must the subject be obedient.
Except always those things that in the rule ben of such weght and substance:
ye wyttyngly to break them were mortal and deedly sin / for there is than
no place of due obedience. In the other (as I said) the subject should be
obedient / although he knew well by good learning / the souereine did pass
the power of the rule in that precepte. For many things been contained in the
rule: contrary whereunto: the souereyne may not (without the venial offense
of god) command. And yet nevertheless if the souereyne (as I said) will
nedely go forth with all and keep still his auctorite of commandment: than
the subject is bound to obey and follow the precepte. For than is the charge
in the souereyne and nothing in the subject after such knowledge had as we
spoke of. But in such things as (after the mind of the auctour and father of
the rule) done seem to be said and commanded under pain of deedly sin: the
subject may in no wise be obedient unto the contrary / without the ieopardy
of that pain. Let us put example of both / in the rule of saint Augustyne.
Aug. Ca. 1. Regu.
In the first Chapitre whereof (when he had moved and appointed the disciples
of ye same rule unto the love of god and of the neighbor. Whereunto all
christianes been bound) than does he forthwith inioyne them by special
precepte to be of one will and one mind / for that was the cause (says he)
why they were gadred together in one house and one covent / and for the effect
thereof to be followed and proved: they should live all in common / and no
persons to have ne yet to name or call any thing properly their own / with
this precept of the rule: may no souereines i^ any wise dispense / ne command
the subjects unto the contrary. And if they did give any such
commandments: the subjects been not bound to follow ne to be obediente
thereunto / but rather to withstand in all they can with good religious manner
and christian byhauioure / as they would withstand deedly damnable sin. And
this I say not without large and evident occasion. For many souereines done
contrary and many subjects done more than wyllyngly follow the same / which
is done in all monasteries where the subjects done receive certain cellar^^
or wages by year. For (as semethe unto me) that is directely not only again
the rule: but also contrary unto the determinacion of the church. In the said
chapitre. Cum ad monasteriu^. as after shall more plainly be showed in the
second member of this perte / were we shall entreat of wylfull pouerte. 4.
Ca. Re. Augusti.
An other example may we take for the other part of the.iiii. Chapitre of the
same rule / where is commanded that when the disciples of the same rule:
should (for any cause necessary) go forth of their monastery: they should go
no less in company than two or three at ye leest in nombre. Contrary unto the
which precept ye souereynes may not command without some offense of the rule
(except it were in causes of necessite) yet if the souereyne do so command:
the subjects must be obedient / because they ben not bound to know the
causes of the precepte. I know well the opinion of diverse auctores is / that
in such things as ben directely known to be contrary unto the rule / be
they great or small: the subjects should not be bound in conscience to be
obedient / because the souereynes (say they) may not or should not command any
such. I grant well they should not and also that they may not / without (as
I said) some offense / but ye offense is not always mortal / but venial /
wherefore it is of more surety say I / in conscience for the subjects: to be
obedient and to follow the precepte / although they knew well: it be
contrary unto the rule. For (as I said) they know not ye cause of the
precepte. And therefore may they (with religious byhauiour) put the charge and
ieopardy of conscience unto the souereyne. Bernardus de precept et dispens.
Antonius perte. 3. ti. 6. Ca. 12.
For in all such things as ben unto ye subjects doutfull: the souereynes may
discharge their conscience / wherefore (in mine opinion) they done best to be
obedient. For generally the subjects ben bound unto the obedience of the
souereynes: in all things lawful and honest. That is to say: in all things
that the souereynes may lawfully command / and yt ben honest for both
parties to be done. So that ever the subjects: have a respect unto the order
and degree of them that have power to command them / as if the priour or
seniores do give a commandment / and the abbot afterward give or before had
given a contrary commandment / tha^ is the subject more bound to the
commandment of the abbot / and like wise of the Pope / bysshope / ordinary /
the visitoures of the orders and such other. So that ever ye most high
precepte: be most chefly observed. Antonius 2. pert. ti. 4. Ca. 2.55.3.
And let this also be noted / yt the subject is not only bound unto the
express co^mau^demet of the souereyne / spoken unto the self subject: but
also unto the same precepte known or perceived by message or by wrytinge / by
sign or token / I speak this for some / such persons that will say: I herd
not my souereyne speak nor command any such a precepte. For ye will mind /
and meaning of ye souereyne: is more to be pou^dred and weyde: than the self
words. And yet has the souereyne no power of precepte over or upon the
private thoughts of the subject nor of the inward mocions of the soul or
mind. Idem. 3. pert. t^. 9. ca. 12.
And therefore if the souereyne would give any precepte upon them: the subject
is not in ieopardy of conscience in the omission. But i^ all that done
apperteine unto the outward acts: the commandment of ye souereyne is
valiant and has good strength and place. But here now some religions
persons done put cases. Answer. Narracio.
we read in vitas Patrum / that an ancient father (for the proof only of
obedience) commanded his disciple to remove a stone that was ouermoche for.xx.
or xxx. men to have stered. And the disciple mekely and without grudge: did
what he could / labored sore and long time thereat and yet sped nothing but
seemed to be all without fruit and all i^ vain / yet was not his labor last /
but rather much frutfull and effectuous / because he had the merit of
obedience which is no small reward as after shall be showed And as unto
learning or knowledge: saint Bernarde said he preached better by the virtue of
obedience: than ever he did by the study of learning. The common proverb is.
Nihil difficile uolenti. Nothing is over hard for the person that is well
wyllyng. A good remedy in such case for the subject is to show unto the
souereyne (with meke and lowely byhauiour) the infirmite and ye very pleynes of
his inhabilite / and so trust unto the discrecion of the souereyne. trust in
our lord: And I dare promise nothing shall hurt you. For our savior said
him self / yt the feythfull person: should (in his name) cast out and avoid
yuell spirits / destroy serpents / and drink poison without noyaunce or
grefe / we read in vitas Patru^ / that a holy father sent forth a child to
fetch water at a well / and the child had herd tell of a Lyones that did
much hurt in those parties / and asked his father what he should do if the
Lyones came upon him. Mat. 16 D.
Narracio.
And he bad him put his gyrdell about her neck / and bring her home with him.
And so he did in deed / by the virtue of obedience. Greg. li. 2. diolog. Ca.
Saint Maure (by the virtue of obedience) ran upon the water at the
commandment of saint Benet his souereyne. God does ever help ye good
willing person / I believe there is no souereyne unreasonable / by ware
therefore of feyned excuses. For the wise man says / that the slothful and
yuell willing person: Prouer. 13. et 26. Objection.
does cast many perils and put many doutes. yet have I herd some ask a
another question. What sir (says he) if the commandment of the souereyne:
were folysshe or else frutles and unto the loss of my time? is apt / disposed
/ and well willing / and thereafter to appoint their commandments. That
(say I) is as much to mean: Bernardus de precpt. et dispens.
Take this therefore as a good rule of obedience that is to be obedient in those
things that been unto your own pleasure: is little meritorious / but to be
obedient in these things that been hard laborious and peynfull and contrarious
unto your own appetytte and desire: is of high merit / and worthy great
thank and reward. Psalm. 16.
The prophet says Propter uerba labiorum tuorum: ego custodiui uias duras.
That is: for the reward lord of thy word and promise: I have kept the hard
ways and narowe paths of penance. And the Apostle says. Per multas
tribulationes: Act, 14. D.
oportet nos intrare in regnum celorum. We must (says he) enter into ye
kingdom of heaven: by many troubles and peynes. In the hard and grievous
things / than to be obedient is (as we said) most laudable and most worthy
love and favor. And yet the tra^sgression and brekynge of them: is of leest
pain and punisshemente. And contrary: in those things that been light / easy
and pleasant to be done: ye obedience is (as we said) of less reward. And
the contempt of the^: of much more pain and punysshemente. Let therefore al
subjects byware of contempt and despysynge of any precepte or commandment
of the souereyne be it it never so little or seem never so light. For
contempt: is ever ieopardy. And thus an end of this article / that is to say:
wherein or in what things: ye subjects should be obedient unto their souereynes.

How or under what form or manner the subjects should be obedient unto their
souereynes. The.viii. Chapitre.
HEre now may follow of ye form manner and byhauiour of obedience / and of
the degrees of ye same. First than we say / that the obedience due unto the
souereyne must in the subject be true / feythfull / plain / simple / and
unfeigned / not colored in any wise ne cloked. That obedience do I call true /
plain / and unfeigned / that is performed and done: not for fere or flaterie:
but after such form outward i^ effect as it is inward in the heart and
mind. For many persons ben very obedient in goodly words / fair and fast
promyses / and in Gentell and lowly byhauiour / but when it should come to
pass in effect and deed: their obedience does prove to be all in ye mouth
and lips / and never to have sonke ne settled down i^ the heart or mind. For
nothing is done at all. Of this manner of obedience: our savior does show
example in the gospel of Matheu. A man (says he) had.ii. Matthew 21. C.
sons his own children / he bad and commanded one of the^ to go in to his
vynyarde and labor there ye day. And he said plainly and platly: he would not
go / ne labor any thing / and yet afterward (when he remembered himself) he
was sorry that he had so answered his father and thereupon he went into the
vynyarde and fulfilled the commandment of his father. The father tha^ came
unto the second sone / and said unto him / in like manner that he should go
into his vinyarde and he (with good and gentel byhauiour) said sir I am ready at
your pleasure and now go forth with good will / and yet he went not at all.
The first pleyne rebellion: seemed inobedience / and yet (in deed) it was full
good obedience. And the other that seems perfect obedience only in the
mouth and in outward byhauiour: was falls feyned flaterie / and in deed:
disobedience. That obedience than is plain / simple / feythfull / and unfeigned
obedience: that is done after and according unto the very mind and meaning
of the souereyne / rather than after the tenure of the words. For many
persons will seem to be truly obedient / and yet under color thereof: will
follow their own mind and pleasure / and after (for excuse) will other make
interpretacion of their souereynes words: or else say they understood the^
after that form / and all they do to seem to be obedient / or (at the leest)
not to seem inobedient. But semynge or feyned obedience: shall a another day:
appear openly before god / and there be proved none obedience / but rather
worse than rebellious inobedience / we said before: be as thou semest / or else
seem as thou art. That obedience also is plain and simple obedience: that is
done blountely with a heart well meaning mind without discuss of reason and
(in manner) without discrecion / so that the obedience / do seem an ydiote or a
fool therein. Let the true obedient subject (says saint Bernarde) be a fool in
obedience / that he thereby may be wise i^ deed Let all his discrecion in
obedience be such: Bernardus de precept et dispens.
that he therein have no manner of discrecion. And let his wit and wisdom be
such: that in obedience: he have no there wit nor wisdom. This now have we
said for the true / feythfull / plain / and simple manner of obedience.

That obedience should be liberal and loving. The.ix. Chapitre.
AN other good manner of obedience: is that it be done liberally and louyngly /
with herty manner and affection of mind. For that liberal affection of that
simple and blent obedience we spoke of: does show / express / and declare /
the discrete indiscrecion and the wise folly or folyshnes of the same. For the
subject that does his obedience with liberal heart and affection: does make
no discuss ne reasonynge of the matter / as other will that done say / what
reason is here in? Who found out this fond or folysshe counsayll? who brought
up this goodly gyfe? How came up this comely custom? with such other checkes
or tawnts. Why should I do this thing: rather tha^ any other of the coue^t? Here
ben mine elders / here ben my yongers. And yet am I driven forth and none else
/ with many such other murmures and grudges which nothing done bycome
religious persons. In these manner of persons: love lacks / and liberal
affecte is absente / and charity (as they say) is out of town. And that
causes them thus to discuss and reason with them self so far: that in deed
they been without or beyond all reason / and done prove them self very stark
foles / For unto loving and simple obedience: nothing apperteyneth to judge or
discuss / the qualite or quantike of the commandment / that is to say:
whether it be vile or honest / light or hard to be done / but without any such
trial or rekenyng / without discrecion or deliberacion / without wit /
wisdom / or co^sideracion: to be content and only to ponder and wey that ye
thing is commanded and therewith to enforce and give diligence: with good
fidelite and with liberal loving heart to perform and fulfill ye same. The
prophet says. Volnutarie sacrificabo tibi. I will good lord said he) do unto
the sacrifice of obedience / with a fre and ready will and with a glad heart and
mind / and in an other place. psalm. 53.
Psalm. 118.
Paratus sum et non su^ turbatus, ut custodiam mandata tua. I am ready (lord)
and nothing troubled ne grieved in that I am bound to keep thy commandments.
And Samuel the prophet / unto our lord. 1. Reg. 3.
Speak / sir (says he) give thou lord ye co^ma^dement. For I am here thy
servant / present and ready / to harken and to be obedient thereunto. I do not
desire to appoint the (good lord) what thou shalt command: but what so ever
thou will command and bid me do: that will I (with all liberal love and
most herty affection) be ready to follow and to fulfill In the old testament
our lord said unto his people. Deuteronomy. 12. in fine.
What I command you to do: that thing do you alone / and another add you any
thing thereunto: ne yet minisshe any thing thereof. What feythfull person: will
ask or seek reason: why our lord god would give this commandment or that? it
nothing apperteyneth unto any creature: to discuss the will and pleasure of
god. Nor yet unto the subject: the will of the souereyne. But well does it
bycome the^ to fulfill (with liberal effect and love of heart) whatso ever is
commanded as their will and mind / and to go no forther. But this point of
obedience is hard to be truly done and fulfilled of any persons except
only such: as have (by force and teruente study) made the souereynes will to
be their own will. And their proper will: to be the souereynes will. For all
manner of persons: done (gladly and with affection) follow and fulfill their
own will And therefore saint Bernarde says. Bernardus de precept et dispens.
That point of obedience call I the best: when the thing that is commanded
is done with the same will and in such manner and form: as it was commanded.
For unto such subjects: the commandment of the souereyne: is (as they say)
meat and drink / that is to mean: a synguler pleasure. So said our savior
him self. Io. 4. D.


Meus cibus est: ut faciam uoluntate^ eius qui misit me. My meat and fode
(said he) is to perform ye will of him that has send me into this world.
And saint Bernarde again. Vt sup.
Those subjects that done seek means / that the souereyne should command
that thing / that were their will and pleasure: done utterly deceive them self
/ altohughe in their own opinion: they seem to keep good obedience. For they
ben not in that thing obedient unto the prelate / but rather the prelate unto
the^. Ls. confess.
Saint Augustyne therefore says. That minister servant / or subject: do I
call ye best: yt does not desire ne will / to here commanded of ye souerein
what he would or has pleasure i^: but ye rather has good will and pleasure to
do / what so ever ye souereyne does speak or command. This obedience therefore
that here is / caled liberal / when it is done and performed with due
affection of heart and mind is of great and high perfection and of synguler
merit. For (as the common proverb says) love has no lack / that is to
mean: that true love fyndeth no defautes / puttethe no doutes / casts no
perilles / ne makes any excuses.

That obedience should be strong / mighty / and bold. The.x. Chapitre.
Upon these premises: does follow an other good propriete of obedience. That
is to say: that very obedience should be strong / mighty and ma^ly / and so
clean without cowardnes: that with a bold spirit and without feere or dread:
it should dare and presume: to interpryse and take in hand: things of great
peryle and ieopardy / things of great difficulty and hardenes / things
laborious and peynfull / and things unto nature horrible and abominable. And
yet things sometime for the state or strength of the persons impossible. So
did we show before / of a disciple that (for obedience) did sore labor to
remove a stone that was impossible to be moved or styrred: by a great multitude
/ and of the young disciple that brought the Lioness unto his souereyne / and
of him also that entered into the pytte of kokadrylles. Saint Bernarde says
that our savior Jesus lost his life: Bernarde.
because he would not lose his obedience. And saint Paul says: that Christ
was made continually obedient unto death And yet unto the most peynfull /
Phillip. 2, A.
and most shameful death of the cross. This manner of obedience: does another
stop ne stycke ne stumple at any lettynges / ne yet make any delay. Canti. 8
B.
For love is as strong as death. Whereof saint Bernarde again says unto all
religious persons. Bernardus.
you have (says he) put your hand unto strong and mighty things / that is to
say: you have enterprysed and taken great things on hand / or charged your
self with great things: you may not therefore now play ye cowardes / you may
not faint in your way / but now must you play ye man / take good hertes and
lusty corrage. Psalm. 36.
Et spcrate in deo, et ipse faciet. And have you good hope and trust in our
lord / and he will help you / comfort you / strength you / and perform your
desire and peticion.

Of the ornacie and garnysshe and of proof of obedience. The.xi. Chapitre.
THis said liberal and loving obedience: is adourned / garnyshed / setforth /
openly showed and proved: by certain evidences / one is / when it is
performed and done with a glad and cherefull countenance / with a merry and
joyful byhauiour. Whereof saint Bernarde says. Bernardus.
A sobre co^tenau^ce and cherefull / gentell and sweet words / with goodely
religious byhauioure: does meruelously well garnyshe good obedience. The wise
man does affirm the same. In omni dato: Eccl. 35.
hijllatem fac uultum tuum. In every gift and good deed: let thy cou^tena^ce
be glad and cherefull whatso ever thou wylt do: let it seem to be done and so
let it be with a good will and gl^^ mind. For (as saint Ambrose says) The outw^
byhauiour: is (in manner) an evident show (...) of the inward heart and mind.
When a t is don with a lowringe cou^tenau^ce / a sour chere / and with a
lompyshe look: it semethe to be done with an yuell will. And so is it worthy
little thank or none at al / but rather worthy blame and rebuke. So that I may
conclude that such obedience: is worse tha^ lost. For it does nothing pleace
/ but rather does much grieve and discontente the souereynes. Saint Paul says
/ that our lord god does love well the glad and chyreful gyuer / that is to
say: 2. Co. 9. B.
that god does acceptably and louyngly receive the service of those persons
that done their duete with glad and cherefull byhauiour. To do well with yuell
will: is a thank les labor. Matthew. 27. D. Marci. 15. B. Lu. 23. D.
For so Simon in the passion of our savior: bare his cross / constreined and
compelled thereunto / and (for that time therefore) deserved no thank. Saint
Paul therefore: did not only command his disciples to be obedient: but also
he showed unto them the form and manner how to be obedient and ye reason
thereof / sayng. Heb. 13. C.
Obedite prepositis uestris, et subiacete eis. Ipsi enim peruigilant quasi
racionem pro animabis nostris reddituri, ut cum gaudio hoc faciatis, et non
gementes, hoc enim nobis non expedit. Be you obedient (says he) unto your
souereynes / and be you subdued as vnderlyng / unto the^. For they done waytche
and care take pain and diligence for you as to render and give accounte for
your souls. And therefore do you that obedience with gladness and joyful manner /
and not murmuryng and grudgynge with an yuell will. For that manner obedience:
is nothing expedient ne profitable unto you / but rather both your merit and
your labor lost. This hyllarite and chereful manner does therefore not only
florysshe, and gayly garnisshe obedience: but also does prove in evident
effect: the liberal love of the same obedience.

That obedience should also be done quikly / redely and without stoppage.
The.xii. Chapitre.
YEt is there an other byhauiour / that does much declare and show very
obedience to be liberal / loving and herty and that is: when obedience is
performed and done / anon and forthwith after the commandment / quikly /
hastily / redely / and with out study or stoppage. The prophet says. Psalm.
17.
In auditu auris obediuit mihi. He was obedient unto me at the first hearing
/ that is to mean: that as soon as he herd me speak: he was forthwith ready to
fulfill my commandment and bidding. And the wise man says. Vidisti uiru^
uelocem in opere suo. etc. Pro. 22. D.
When so ever thou see or do perceive a person quick / ready / and
delige^t in his works: that person is worthy to wait and to do service in
the presence of kings / princes / or great estates. Psalm. 118.
And the prophet again. Paratus sum, et non sum turbatus, ut custodi am
mandata tua. I am always ready (good lord says he) and nothing troubled to keep
thy commandments. That quiknes (than) and that redynes: is a sign and token
of good will / and of a loving heart. And therefore is that service and
obedience: tha^kfull and worthy favor and reward. We read in vitas Patrum /
of an holy father caled / abotte Syluane / which had.xii. disciples or
subjects / of ye which.xii. one yt was named / brother Mark: was more favored
and beloved of his abbot: tha^ any of the other / wherewith they were all
discontent and murmured and grudged much therewith / which thing when the good
father knew and perceived: he studied how to satisfy the^ and said openly
among his other lessons: yt the subject that is most ready unto obedience: is
ever most worthy the favor and love of the souereine And on the morrow (to
prove ye redynes of obedience) he knocked at their selles by order and caled
eueryche by his proper name / but none of the^ came forth ne yet gave any
answer. Than came he unto the sell of ye said Mark / and knocked at his door
and / caled hi^ by his name / and he forthwith answered saying father? and
therewith he starte forth in all haste. And the said father / went into his
sell to se how he was occupied / and there he found that he was writing and
at the call of his souereyne: had left the one half of a letter unmade /
which writing he brought forth unto all the other brethren: and showed unto
them the redynes of his obedience: wherewith they were al confounded / and
mekely confessyng their own defaute were so satisfied / and granted that (by
good reason) he was most worthy to be favored. An other story shall we show
you of our time. Of a bysshope of England that used to call his servants by
these terms / one of you / as though he cared not which of them he had. And
ever one person of small reputacion (in comparison of other) was ready at hand
/ and answered unto that call. So in short time a profyttable office or fie
fell into the gift of the bysshope / and his counsel asked him. Who should
have that good office / and he said / one of you / and they named a person.
Nay said the bysshope: what should one of you have than? Why sir said they he
is one of us / well said he: one of you shall have it / and than he declared
unto them what he meant / that was that the same young man: that ever was most
ready at his said calyng: should have it. So does appear that quick and ready
obedience: does much please and content all manner of souereynes. And many
persons have we (known for our time) that have: for their ready obedience and
due attendau^ce ben promoted and favored above and before many other: that else
had been more worthy and more like to have been promoted. And the obedience or
service yt is duly or slothfully done (although it be well done) yet does
lose much favor and thank / because it makes the souereynes weary / to se
the subjects go so slowly unto work. For it semethe than to be done with
yuell will. And it is a grieve unto a loving souereine / and a great
disconforte also: to se the subjects (after the commandment given) to stop
and study thereat / although they would be aduysed / and so to stand and sit
still and each look upon other / as though they knew not unto whom he spoke /
or as though one would that his fellow should go forth before or rather tha^
he / or as though they were afraid to go forth / as dear done in an herd
when hunters ben about the^. For than done they stand in an hepe to gether /
and one does put an other / to have him out before. This manner and byhauiour in
obedience does (as I said) much grieve the souereynes. For it causes them to
think / that they have but little love among such subjects. And contrary /
the quiknes and redynes of the obedience: is unto the souereynes / as an
evident proof of the love of the subjects / and does goodly and gayly well
garnysshe the said liberal obedience.

That obedience should be done with due reverence. The.xiii. Chapitre.
IT byco^meth also this loving lady obedience: to be done with due reverence.
For love without reverence: is chyldyshe or folyshe. Children / little babes /
and innoce^tes: done love their mothers or nurses / without any reverence unto
them / and so done ydiotes and innocent foles their gouernoures or kepers. And
reverence without love: is mockery. For so done lords or ge^telmen reverence
unto their servants in mockery or scorn / and so did the Iues: unto our
savior Christ. Shrewde boyse and laddes: will also do reverence in mockery
unto their masters. But such reverence byco^meth not religious persons / all
their reverence should come from the love of ye heart / and so should their
due reverence in every obedience: show the mekenes of their minds. For when
obedience is done boldly / rudely / and without due reverence: it is a sign
of a proud and presumptuous heart / that should disdeyne to do that obedience
/ and that it is done of course or custom / for the duete and bond of
religion: rather than for the love of reverent devotion. And therefore such
manner of subjects: done think their obedience much and of great price / and
that they ben worthy: much praise and thank / and also reward therefore / but
i^ very deed they ben worthy none at all / for that reverence is rather to be
accounted as a flaterie than as due reverence / and therefore if they have any
thank or reward for the same: that temporal thing: shall only be their
merit. Where the very loving reverence: that is joined unto obedience as
justice and duete / and to avoid the offense / pain and punisshemente / that
else they should should have: is much rewarded of god. For such persons done
another ask ne couete any reward in this life but rather done say after the
counsel and doctrine of our savior in the gospel. Where he says unto his
disciples. Cum feceritis omnia que precepta sunt nobis. Luce. 17.
Dicite, Serui inutiles sumus. Quod debuimus facere: fecimus. Ve enim nobis: si
non fecerimus. That is: when you have done all manner of things that were
commanded you: say you (unto your self) we been unprofitable servants. For
we have done nothing: but that was our duete. And woe and vengeance should
have come unto us: if we had not done it. Here is now thank desired / here is
now reward looked fore / only these persons ben glad to eskape pain and
displeasure. And yet shall they to deed have most high thank and reward not
only of their souereynes here: but also of our lord in bliss.

That obedience must be perseueraunt. The.xiiii. Chapitre.
YEt one poi^t or propriete apperteininge unto obedience does remain / not
only as an ornament or garnysshe: but also as a full so^me and perfection of
this holy virtue obedience / that is to say: perseueraunce / which is not
only required unto obedience: but also unto all manner of virtues / that shall
be rewarded of our lord god. For saint Gregory says. De paeni. distin. 3,
In casum, bonum agitur: si ante uite terminum deferatur. A good deed is vain
/ void / and fruteles if it be left / given over and not continued: unto the
lives end. What avails to ren fast for ye glayue a while / and than stop
and stand or stycke in yt way and come not forth unto the goole and place
appointed? 1. Cor. 9 D,
Sic currite (saint Paul says) ut comprehendatis. So ren you (says he) that
you may wyn and caytche the game. Matthew. 10. C.
And in the gospel our savior says. Qui perseuerauerit usque in finem: sic
saluus erit. Who so ever does continue his good deed unto a perfect end: he
shall surely be a saved soul. Many persons done bygyn well but yet (as the
common proverb says) hot love is sone cold / and therefore they bring not
well unto a perfect end: ye thing that they well byganne and with great
feruoure of devotion. They say therefore in an other proverb / that soft fire:
makes sweet malte. That is to mean: that every thing that is done by good
deliberacion: comes unto a good and profitable end / whereof is yet an other
English proverb common / love me little (say they) and love me long.
Matthew. 22. D.
But here unto will some persons say / that (after the commandment of the
gospel) we should love god not a little but rather as much as is possible /
with all the heart all the soul / and all the mind / that is to mean with all
the powers of the soul / the memory / understanding and will. But here must
you understand / that one thing may be both little and much in respect of
diverse other things. For the hole yerthe in comparisone unto the son: is
very little in quantyte / skant the.viii. part / and yet in comparison unto
the realm of England: it is very great. So that love may unto some person
seem little that unto an other semethe very much. So is it in ye love of god.
For that love that seems unto the very spiritual lover very little: is unto
our lord very much / when the self lover complaynethe most upon him self
because he does not love god / and does sygh and mourn / and is very sorry y^
he can not (as he says or wenethe) love god / than does god exsteme and wey
that love for very great / so that the perseueraunce of that love shall have
sure reward / where many other persons that done begin in great feruoure
and by little and little does dekaye: shall have little thank. So is it of
obedience. For some will be very diligent and lowely at the beginning / and
done think they ben very good obediencers and done well keep the bidding of
ye souereine / and thereupon they wax bold and done believe they ben in the
favor of the souereyne and thereof ben they joyful and glad / but wha^ i^ a
while after: they wax more dull and than ben challenged or rebuked: tha^ done
they think and sometime say that all their diligence was lost / because they
have no such thank as they looked fore / and so does their diligence dekaye.
But the very true obedience / byleuethe or (at the leest) dredethe and ferethe
that he never does his duete / but that all he does: is to little / and he
has no regard in all his obedience: unto the souereyne as for the self
souereyne / Prop^er quod unu^quodque est: illud magus est.
nor unto the will / pleasure or displeasure of the souereyne / but only for
god and so secondary unto the souereyne as using the person and bearing the
rowme of god. And therefore / if the souereyne be ouersene and be displeased
without any just cause or reason: yet does not the loving subject: withdraw
any perte of due obedience: lest he should displease god / as wtdrawynge from
him his due right. The respects therefore / the lokynge and beholding unto god /
and the consideracion of his everlasting reward: does cause the devout and
religious subjects (as well in pain and displeasure as in wealth and pleasure)
to persevere / continue and go forth ever still in due obedience. Perseueraunce
therefore is necessary / without which: all labors ben lost. Of this loving
lady perseueraunce: have we translate a book into English of a good auctoure
and great learned man caled Mapheus / which book you have and may se therein
more of this matter.

Of the benefyttes / fruits / vauntage or avail / and profyttes of due
obedience by order / and first of the first fruit and profytte. The.xv.
Chapitre.
Now may conuenie^tly follow (as a conclusion of obedience) what is the
effect and end of obedience / that is what profitte and good the persons
shall have or win by due obedience And hereunto shall we use the sure
foundation and ground which is diverse times remembered in this work / that
is to say: that all the obedience yt is done unto the soueryne: is done
principally unto our lord god / whose rowme and place: they done bear and use
according unto his own saying in the gospel of Luke the.x. Chapitre. Luce. 10.
Qui uos audit: me audit. etc. Whosoever ever is obedient unto you (says he unto
his Apostles) is obedient unto me / and who so dispiseth you: dispiseth me.
There ben diverse fruits or profyttes whereunto we have regard and done make
provision and care fore in this life. But Ge. 26. A.
and I will be with ye and I will bless the and multiply thy goods / and I
will give the all these lands and possessions: which I promised unto thy
father Abraham / because he was obedient unto my voice and commandment. Deu.
28. A.
And in an other place he says unto the children of Israel by his servant
Moses. If you be obedient unto ye voice and commandment of your lord god /
you shall be in honor / dignite / and possessions: above al ye people of this
world / and have many other commodites which there done follow by order. And
although unto religious persons: this profytte be: but of small weight and
regard: yet must they nedely have their natural fode and clothing / which
things charitably ministered (according unto the necessite of ye persons)
does cause them to live more quietely / and to be the better content with
their estate and manner of living. But (as we said before) the most obedient
subjects been most favored of their souereynes: and therefore of good right
ben best served of all necessaries: ergo due obedience is profitable unto the
worldly part / which is the first and leest fruit and profytte of obedience.
Vos amici mei estis: Io. 15. B.
si feceritis que precipio nobis. you ben my dear and loving friends (says
he) if you (by due obedience) perform and fulfill what so ever I bid and
command you. And by the same reason did our savior prefer in rowme and
office: saint Peter that was caled / Simon / which (by interpretacion) is as
much to say as obedience. And surely natural parents: done co^munely favor
most and prefer their most obedient children. And so done masters and
maystresses / lords and ladies among their servants / so folowethe that
obedience is profitable unto the increace of the worldly substance or goods
necessary unto our daily living.

Of the second profytte or fruit of obedience. The.xvi. Chapitre.
THe second profitte whereunto man's nature has regard and care: is the
prosperity / health and good state of ye body to be preserved and kept i^ good
health and long life / whereunto much avails obedience. The holy scripture
says. Honora patrem tuum: et matrem tuam, Deuteronomy. 5. C.
ut longo uiuas te^pore, et been sit tibi in terra. Do thou honor and
reverence unto thy father and unto thy mother / that thou may be long lived
/ or live a long time / and be in good state and health upon yerthe / but
before have we proved: that due honor can not be without due obedience / they
must nedely go to gother: ergo the same profytte is promised unto both in like
But here some persons will say (peradventure) ye this promise is made in
scripture: Pro. 7. A.
Honor thou (says he) with due obedience thy lord and master: Ibidem.
and thou shalt (for thy reward) be well at ease and welthye. And in the same
place. Be thou obedient (says he) unto my bidding and commandment: and thy
reward shall be long life. The souereynes in religion: done bear the rowme and
the person of our lord: ergo all such promyses done extend unto them. Eccl.
3. per totum.
In the book also caled Ecclesiasticus / ben many commodites and profyttes set
forth and promised unto the same purpose / which we have set forth at
length in a little work that we wrote unto householders and rulers /
natwithstandynge we shall not be grieved to set out the same again here. For
here in is good auctorite for all the commodites and profyttes that we have
before appointed / that is to say: of the goods of the body / of the same / and
of the soul. I pray you therefore good devout reders note it well. The Chapitre
begi^neth thus / as it is exponed by the church. The children of sapience or
of wisdom: Quia non i^ greco.
been the congregation or company of just and ryghtuous persons / and the
nation: that is to say: the natural disposicion of them: Audite.i. obedite.
is obedience and love. you loving children therefore (says he) harken you
well the judgment of your father / and be you obedient thereunto. And so
perform and work the same: that you may be the children of salvation. God
has ordened by the honor of the father: to be i^ the children / requiryng
also and confirmyng in the^: the judgment and obedience of the mother. Those
persons that done love god and ben obedient unto his commandments: shall
(for their reward) have special grace to ask forgeuenes for their sins
paste / and to continue and keep the^ self from those that been to come / and
shall be graciously herd in their daily prayers. And those persons that duly
done honor their parents: ben like (in spiritual provision) unto the^ that
(for te^porall provision) done gether riches and tresore upon yerthe. Those yt
done obediently honor their parents: shall rejoice / and have joy and
conforte: in their own children. And shall be graciously herd of god in all
their need or trouble. The children yt done duly honor their parents:
shall be long lived / or of long life. And the child yt is obedient unto the
father: does much refresshe and conforte the mother. And in like manner the
child that is obedient unto the mother: does well content and please the
father. Those children that reverently done feere and dread our lord: done
also duly honor their parents. And as bondmen or thrale persons done
service unto their lords and masters: so done they unto the^ that have
bygotten the^ into this world / and such children: will do their service so /
both in work and word / and with good and lowly byhauiour in all manner of
patience. Do (child) unto thy parents due honor and reverence. And thy
reward shall be: ye blessing of god and ye multiplicacion or increace of
worldly goods i^ this life / and ye same blessi^g shall remain and rest upon
ye for evermore. The blessing of the parents: does make ye heneritau^ce of
ye children: steadfast and staple and ye cures of ye parents: does rotewalt
vnrote pluck up and destroy yt seems to be most surely founded and roted.
Child: take never pleasure ne pride i^ ye rebuke of thy parents. For yt is not
thy worshipe ne praise / but rather thy co^fusio^ shame and rebuke. For ye
glory and worshype of ye child: is of the honor of the pare^te / and great
shame is it unto ye child: that the parente be without honor. Child: take
good patience with the age of thy parents / and never displease them / grieve
them ne make them sorry in all their life. And if they feyle or fault in wit
or understanding: forgive them and take patience therewith / and never despise
them by ye comparison of thine own strength / wit / co^nynge or abilite. For
the co^miseracion / the petie or compassion that the child has upon the
parents: shall never be forgotten. For thou shalt for the default of thy
parents (duly borne and suffered) have great merit and reward / and in thy
justice that is to say in doing thy duete (for every child is bounden unto the
parents) thou shalt have profytte and a place ordained in heaven / and yet
here in the time of trouble or need shall thou be remembered of god. And as the
froste or yse in the clear son: so shall thy sins be molten and wasted. All
this have we translated out of ye said third Chapitre of Ecclesiasticus / to
show the fruits and profyttes of obedience which said Chapitre (after al
doctoures) speaks and means all: of the spiritual parents / as well as of
the carnal parents. And yet does follow: in the same Chapitre unto the
contrary part: how great ieopardy it is to be obedient or disobedient unto
the parents / and what pain and punisshemente bylongeth thereunto / that is to
say: all contrary unto the torsayd profyttes / and he does conclude them in
few words / saying thus. Quam male fame est: qui relinquit Patrem? How great
shame and rebuke apperteyneth unto that person that does forsake the father
and is rebellious and disobedient unto the parent. This point is again ye fame
and good name / as though he said: much shame and yuell name and fame: does
follow such persons. Than follows for the residue. And that child is cursed
of god: y^ does displease / vex / trouble / and grieve the pare^t. The curse
of god is contrary unto all the other fruits of obedience / that is to say: the
wealth of the soul of the body and of the goods.

Of the third fruit or profytte of obedience: fame / good name / honor / and
worshype. The.xvii. Chapitre.
Although ye Chapitre before: be of itself sufficient auctorite for all our
purposed profyttes: yet shall we nevertheless go forth with our order / and
show now somewhat of the third fruit and profytte of obedience coming
thereof / which is fame and good name / honor and worshype / it is a worshype
in the world to be of high blood or of a royal lynage or stock. But every
obedient person is of the stock and kynne of our savior Christ / by his own
words. Matthew. 12. in fine. Marci. 3. D. Luce. 8. C. Io. 15. B. Deuteronomy. 28.
Who so ever (says he) by due obedience does accomplish and fulfill in deed
or work: the will of my father / that person is my father and mother / sister
and brother. And again / those ben my lovers and friends that done (by due
obedience) what I command the^ Our lord also promised in the old testament:
honor and worshype unto his people / if they would keep due obedience. Saying
if thou be obediente unto the voice and byddyng of thy lord god: thou shall be
promoted and exalted above all other nations. Our savior in diverse places
said. Matthew. 1^. B. Lu. 14. C. et 18. C.
Qui se humiliat exaltabitur. The person that keeps a low sail and makes
him self meke and vile: shall be exalted and taken up / unto honor and dignite
/ but humilite is proved best by obedience / ergo obedience is worthy laud /
praise / honor / and worshype. Every virtue is worthy praise. For laud and
praise does follow virtue / as the shadow in the son: does follow the body.
Fame and good name: is of laud and praise. Prouer. 21.
The wise man says that victory: is worthy praise. And the obedient person
(says he) may best speak of victory / and he has vanquyshed and gotten a
great castle and suit hold: that has overcome him self / which is done
only by obedience. For without obedience: can no virtue be gote^ne preserved
and kept. And without obedience: every virtue is sone lost. For it lesteth no
longer than the person is obedient, Perfect obedience: does work miracles.
Marci. 14. D.
For by his obedience saint Peter went upon the water / as upon the dry yerthe
or land. And saint Maure that was disciple unto saint Benedicte / caled saint
Benette: Grego. 2. dia. Ca. 7.
by obedience ran upon the water to recover the child Placidus / that fell
into the river. And many other great miracles ben setforthe and showed i^ vitas
Patrum / and in many other holy stories: that were done by holy obedience. The
name and fame whereof: does yet lest and continue and shall do for ever. So
tha^ does follow / ye one of ye fruits and profyttes of due obedience: is fame
and name.

Of the fourth fruit or profitte of obedience / that is to say the wealth of
the soul. The.xviii. Chapitre.
How let us se how the welthe of the soul comes of due obedience. The
first wealth of the soul: is delyuera^ce thereof from the state of da^pnacio^
unto the state of grace / which is only of obedience unto the holy
sacraments. First unto the sacrament of baptism / and also unto the
sacrament of penance. And other great wealth unto the soul: is to be preserved
/ kept / and continued in the same state of grace / which is only by
obedience. Pro. 29. C.
The wise man says / yt the person is blessed ye is obedient unto ye
commandment of god. And in an other pacle. Qui custodit preceptu^: non
experietur, Eccle. 8.
quicquam mali. The person that is obedient unto the commandment of our
lord: shall never have experience of evil / but shall be preserved and kept
from all sin. And our savior in the gospel. Io. 8. D.
Si manseritis in sermon meo: uere discipuli mei eritis. etc. If you (says
he) persevere / continue / and bide in the obedience of my bidding and
commandment: tha^ shall you be my very disciples / and you shall know the
troth of all things and that truth: shall deliver you from all yuell. And a
little after / he made an oath and said. Ibidem. F.
I acerteyne you for a true truth / ye who so ever will be obedient in keeping
of my commandment: shall never have experience of death everlasting. August.
And when we say in our pater noster. Fiat uoluntas tua sicut in celo et in
terra. Let thy will be done upon yerth as it is in heaven / tha^ done we pray
and make peticion for obedience For that saying is as much to mean: as
though we said. Good lord our holy father that art i^ heaven we beseech the
grant us the gift of due obedience / yt (according unto our state) we may
work and perform thy will here upon yerth: as (of thy Angels and saints for
thyr state) it is performed and wroght in heaven. For although obedience be ye
synguler gift of god and freely given: yet will he natwtsta^di^g: yt we ask it
and make peticio^ or pray therefore. Whereunto we be^ (of his holy spirit
exhorted and moved. And who so ever will inclyne / leyne / and give good ear
and heryng unto the exhortacion of truth: shall surely possede and have it /
and that will not: can never have it. And if (by fraylte or temptacion) we fall
into sin nothing may recover and deleuere us: but only obedience unto the
holy sacrament of penance / obedience (than) is a great benefytte and
profytte unto the soul. And yet when the soul is (by penance) reconsyled:
nothing may better apparel and garnysshe the soul with good virtues ne
better keep and norysshe the same therein: August.
than obedience. For obedience is not only the mother and begynner of all
virtues: but also it is the mures or noryssher / the brynger up and keeper of
all virtues. And obedience does also chase / put away / and quench / or (at
the leest) does restreyne and rebate the assayles of our three principal
enemies the dyuell / the world / and the flesh / whereof the prophet says.
Psalm. 118.
In quo corrigit adoscencior uiam suam? That is under the form of a question
how / wherein / or whereby shall ye frail young person correct and refourme or
restreyne / his ways and frail disposicions? whereunto he answered saying. In
custodiendo sermones tuos. In keeping thy byddynges / that is ta say by due
obedience unto thy commandments. Obedience also does cause in the soul and
in the conscience of a person: a merueylous tranquilite and rest of mind And
in all scrupulosites / feres or doutes: obedience does put ye conscience in
most high surete / which is no little conforte ne yet small profytte unto the
soul. Esaias. 48.
Whereof the prophet Esaias says in the person of our lord / unto the people.
If thou (said he) had ben obedient unto my commandment and byddinge: thy
peace / thy tranquilite / thine ease and rest: should have been habou^da^t as a
flode or river In figure whereof: is said in the Machabees / that for the time
of Simon: Macha 14.
which (by interpretacion) is as much to say: as due obedience / all the
laud and nation of the Iues was in great tranquilite / rest and peace / thus
is euidente / that obedience is much profitable unto the soul.

That by due obedience: large conjecture may be had of the state of the soul.
The.xix. Chapitre.
A Great singular conforte / profytte and pleasure unto al devout christianes
/ is to know (at the leest by conjecture) in what case or state of salvation:
the soul does stand / which is best known by love. For who so is in
charity: dwellethe in god / and god in him / but no person can love god:
except he first love his neighbor. For saint Johan says / he y^ loves not
his neighbor: 1. Io. 4. D.
whom he may se and perceive with his bodily sight: how can he love god whom
he can never so se ne perceive? as though he me^t / yt he might not love god i^
any wise / without ye love of his neighbor. 1, Io. 3. C.
In this one thing (says he) we know well / yt we ben translate and changed
from death unto life because we done love our brother. For who so ever does not
love: dwells and is drowned in death / by love than must the state of the
soul be known. Who so ever does perceive in conscience: that he is in
charity with all persons / and louethe all as him self and hates none: he
may hope and trust well that he louethe god. But next unto god and our self
we ben most bound to love our pare^tes / specially the spiritual parents /
our souereynes of religion Due loving obedience unto whom: is a testimony of
our love and obedience unto our lord whose rowme they bear. For he said unto
his disciples. If you bide and continue in due obedience and each love other:
Io. 8.
than shall you be in deed my disciples and so know for my disciples / so is
obedience (than) perfytable unto the soul.

Of the final merit and high reward of obedience. The.xx. Chapitre.
THe final merit and high reward of obedience: is grace in this life
present / and glory in the life to come. For surely obedience does obtain
here much grace and does also multiply the same. Super quem (says our
lord) requiescet spiritus meus. etc. Upon whom (says he) shall my spirit
rest / dwell / bide and continue: but upon the person that is meke in spirit
and obedient thereafter? God is ever ready and present (by his grace) to help
and conforte the persons obedient / as did appear in saint Petre when he (at
the byddyng of our lord) went upon the water. For although (for his feynt
feythe) he byganne to synke and drown: Matthew. 14. D.
yet (for his obedience) our lord was ready to help him The same was also
signified in the ladder that Jacob saw whereunto our lord was joined / Gene.
18.
in token that he would ever be ready to help and conforte the^ (by his grace)
that done take ye way and enterprise the journey of obedience / which thing
Jacob felt and perceived in the workynge of his soul: before he saw the
outward token. And therefore he said with great affection / our lord is in
this place: and I knew nothing thereof. Whereby does appear ye god is ever
present with the obedient persons: all though he be not perceived. Jacob also
did se and perceive: that Angels did ascend and discende by that ladder /
which thing does signify: the manyfolde graces that our lord does daily
minister (by his holy Angels) unto the persons obedient. Our lord said also
of him self. Io. 14. C.
Who so does love me (says he) will be obedient unto my bidding / the reward
whereof: does follow. And my father of heaven will love him / and we both will
come unto him or unto his house / that is to say / into his soul And there
will we make our ma^sion and dwelling place with him / a good gift / and much
comfortable unto the soul I assure you. Glosa super illud Qua si peccatu^
alielandi, est repu^g. 1. Re. 15 E. Psalm. 81.
The merit of obedience is so much: that thereof is said. Sola obedientia est:
quae fidei meritum possidet. Sine qua infidelis: Quisque co^uincitur. Obedience
is that virtue: that alone has the merit of feythe: without which every
person is accounted and condemned as an infidele / or vnfeythful person. And
ye prophet says. Preceptu^ dn^i lucidu^. etc. The commandment of our lord /
is unto ye person obediente / bright and shynynge / and does illumine and
give light unto the eyes and syghte that is to mean: does teach the
conscience to perceive the troth in all doutes or erroures. For the iugementes
of our lord (as folowethe there) been (unto the persons obediente) true in
them self / and so been they showed and byleued of the said persons /
nothing doutynge of the^ in any wise but unto them more desyrable and
pleasant / than any riches / silver / gold / or precious stones. And more
sweet and delectable unto the heart and soul of ye odient persons: tha^ is
honey or sugar unto the mouth or palate. And therefore (says he) good lord /
thy loving servants done keep thy commandments and in keeping of them is
much merit and most high reward. And in an other place. Ideo dilexi
mandata tua super aurum et topasion. Psalm. 118.
I have therefore (as a liberal obedienser) loved thy commandments above and
much more than any gold or precious stones. And therefore have I (with all due
diligence) ordered my self unto obedience. And thereby have I hated and avoided
the way of wyckednes / or all wyked ways. August.
Saint Augustyne also says that the more obedient one person be (in this
life) above a another: the more large shall be his merit and reward in ye life
to come. Ibidem.
And mortal me^ (says he) shall by ye meryt reward of obedience: pass /
atteine / and come / unto the immortalite of Angels. And (so to conclude)
obedience does open heaven gates / and does convey and carry the obedient
persons there into. For without due obedience: can never man be the child of
salvation / ne enter the gates of heaven / Our savior to wytnes / where he
says. Matthew. 19. B.
Si uis ad ui tam ingredi: serua mandata. If thou will enter into the
everlasting life: keep the commandments / which thing is very obedience.
Io. 5.
And again. Qui uerbum meum audit et credit ei qui misit me: habet uitam
eternam. Who so ever is obedient unto my commandment / and gyuethe credence
or does believe in him that sent me into this world: is now in surete (for
the time) of everlasting life. And saint Bernarde says that Christ him self
is the ^ewarde of obedience. Super eum ecce nos reliquimus omnia. Augusti.
And to conclude the great co^modites / fruits / profyttes / and high merit
or reward of obedience. Saint Augustyne says / that in heaven shall be such a
swetnes and pleasant felicite and light or easyredenes of obedience: between
ye body and ye soul: that their interchau^geable obedience shall be like to ye
life of that regne and of ye realm or kingdom. Whereunto he bring us that
bought us / our most obedient lord and most sweet savior Jesus Christ / and
(i^ ye mean time) he grant us ye grace here of such obedience: as may render
and make us his fofolowers i^ ye same high and most noble virtue. Ame^. THus
you may perceive (good devout Christanes) yt I had in mind and purposed to
have made here with an end of this treates / for this member and board or
table of obedience. Natwithsta^dyng suddenly came to mind: ye syghe I had
spoken so much of the co^modites / fruits and profytes of this noble virtue of
obedience: it should be convenient somewhat to show of the inco^modites and
ieoperdes of ye contrary vice / yt is to say: inobedience or disobedience.

Of the inco^modites and ieopardes of inobedie^ce or disobedience / and first
of the definicion thereof. The.xxi. Chapitre.
THe Philosopher says: that who so will define / determine / and declare a
thing well what it is: must show and appoint somewhat of the contrary
thereunto. For (as he says in a another place) when things contrary: ben leyde
or compared to gether: eueriche of the^ does appear ye more evident and clear
for the the other / as white color leyde nere unto black does seem in it self
more whytte and also causes the black to seem more black: than else they
should do alone. And pride: is the better known by the declaracion of mekenes.
So is it of obedience and disobedience. For as obedience: is an abnegacion and
forsakyng of proper will: subdued unto the will of a another person souereine
of religion (For we speak here of monastical obedience / which religious
persons done profess) so is in obedience or disobedience / an election or
choice and following (in effect) of proper will: contrary unto the promise
and vow made in profession / let this be taken thus for the definicion / that
is to say: a determinacion or declaracion of the self thing / what it is /
and what is meant by that term or name of obedience or inobedience and likewise
of all other things.

Of the division or diverse manners of inobedie^ce The.xxii. Chapitre.
THis vice of in obedience or disobedience: may be in diverse manners / one way
inobedience may be improper / which may not properly be caled disobedience /
but after or according unto the common opinion of the unlearned people / that
is: when a subject (by reason sense / and right understanding will not
fulfill the precepte of the souereyne / that he seems not to be obedient but
rather styfly disobedient / how be it he is not so in deed. For (as I said
before) in such case: he is not bound to be obedient but rather bound unto
the contrary. Act. 5. E.
For (as the Apostle Petre said) we ben more bound to be obedient unto god
than unto man. And therefore I said / that this way is not properly
disobedience. An other Nemo perplexus simpliciter ueru^ propria in curia potest
quis seipsum implicare diuus Thomas li. senten.
he should do again his conscience and that is ever syn / although the
conscience be erroneous. And if he do not the precepte than is it inobedience
and so a venial sin / because the subject is bound to put away that error
and scrupulosite both / and to be obedient unto the souereyne. For in all
doutes: ye subject is discharged in conscience: by ye precepte of the
souereyne. An other kind or manner of disobediece: is by frailte / as wha^ the
subject / does know well and also does remember and has in mind the
precepte and matter wherein he should be obedient / and does not (in any wise)
despise the carnal affection: does let the perfourmynge thereof and so is the
thing undone and the precept ouerpassed and broken. This manner of obedience:
may be deedly sin or venial / according unto the nature of the precepte. For
if the nature of the precept and of the obedience: be commanded and ordened by
the church or by the states of ye rule or religion / to be kept under pain of
deedly sin: than is ye disobedience thereof deedly sin / and else but
venial. And in like manner unto the contrary: this ignorance should nothing
or very little excuse them of the offense / because these persons been bound
to know their statutes and ordinances. But now for the other part. If the
same persons / the same day should feed upon flesh / supposing and
byleuynge verily: it were fysshe and no flesh (as we have read of diverse
persons) than (I say) does that ignorance excuse a great part / but yet not
fully in all / except due search with diligence: were made before. Thus now
does appear / that according unto the matter subject: disobedience or
inobedience procedynge of ignorance: may be venial or deedly sin. yet is
there a another kind A cecitate cordis libera nos domine. That is to say: Good
lord deliver all christianes from the blyndnes of heart. For who is more
blind: than he that will not se? And who is more folysshe: than he that will
not learn ne give credence? And yet ben such persons co^munely most
presu^ptuous / most bold and malaparte. For (as the proverb says) none is so
bold as blind bayarde. Bernardus. sup canti.
For what can be more high presu^pcion and more malaparte boldness (says saint
Bernarde) than that one synguler person in a congregation or company: should
allow and obstinately or styfly prefer his proper sense / his own proper
wit / wisdom or reason: his own proper opinion and judgment: above and
before all other persons? proper sense: is called the eye or sight of the old
man that is enemy unto almighty god. And also does slander the self person
and does cause him to take and to give many occasions / and therefore (after the
counsel of the holy gospel) it should be dug out and cast away. Matthew. 5.
E. Marci. 9. C.
Proper will: is when a person does (as is said before) know well and also
has well in remembrance: the promise and bond of this profession / and yet
despysynge the same or careless thereof: will (by deliberacion) do the contrary
which thing caused always other of fraylte / or else of very obstinacy and
dyuelysshe frowardnes. For be negligence: is never committed this manner of
disobedience. But by fraylte many times is the person drawn and in manner
compelled by yuell custom: to do contrary unto his own knowledge / and
contrary unto proper conscience as by all the sins of the flesh / glotony
slothe / and lechery. Phillip. 3. D.
For the gloton does so make a god of his belly: y^ he does in effect rather
displease god wyttyngly: than his womb or belly. Of this sort: been such
religious persons / as well done know and remember: but little done regard or
force for their rules and ordinances: to eat and drink and feade / out of
due time or due place / and such meats or drynkes: as be prohibit and
forboden / and yet some worse than these that done so excede therein: y^ I
should be ashamed or abashed to speak or writ thereof. Slothe also does
work much yuell i^ this matter / in such persons as done more love and chose
rather the ease and pleasure of the body: tha^ the honor of god / we have
herd of religious persons: that been much dull and slothful to rise and to
come to the divine service and unto the other reguler obseruaunces of their
religion / and some done give the^ self unto worldly disportes and games much
vnreligious and done fle and avoid labors. And done delight and take pleasure
i^ seculer company / and there keep daliau^ce in clateryng and talkyng /
hearing and tellyng of tales in such pastymes / which I call lose times worse
than mere ydlenes. Custom in which things: does draw the^ unto proper will
contrary unto all commandments / and so does bring the^ unto disobedience.
The flesh is not behind with occasion unto this malady of proper will / in
such persons that well done know and remember their bond of chastity / and
yet for lack of due guard of the senses / ben sone elect and drawn to follow
the occasions of the contrary: so that another counsel ne commandment can
cause them to leave their proper will and pleasure therein / although they be in
right great ieoperty of naufrage and wrack of chastity / of the which matter
we shall speak more large hereafter in the proper place / and likewise of
wylfull pouerte / which which (by proper will) the world does sore assail.
And as unto the gostly enemy: he never slepeth / but most diligentely
co^passeth about seeking to find whom he may devour. 1. Petri. 5. B. C.
Some he does assayse by sodeyne passions of inpacience / and some by subtyl
envy. But the most deep danger of proper will: is in them that been blown up
and bolne by pride / and brought unto such obstinacy and peruers or froward
mind: that contrary not only unto counsel or commandment: but also unto
their own reason understanding and judgment / of very cursed heart / and
dyuelysshe peruersite and shreudnes: will follow their own way and proper will
or rather their froward fantasye and so wyllyngly and wittyngly done deney /
refuse / and disdeyne or despise ye commandment of the souereyne. And make
play and disputacion for the defense of their said fa^tasie and somtym reenne
so far therein: yt they fall not only unto false erroures: but also unto
pleyne heresies / and so styfly done clyue and stycke by the^: that they will
rather forsake the hole church of Christ: tha^ to be overcome and give over
their proper opinion and this I call the worste kind of disobedience.

Of the ieopardes and paynfull merits and rewards of disobedience or
inobedience. The.xxiii. Chapitre.
TO show unto you the ieopardes and inco^modites of this great malady and
myschefe of inobedience: we shall use the same manner that we used in showing
the fruits and profitable co^modites of holy obedience / beginning at the in
co^modites of the worldly substance. And than of the body and so forth unto
the fame and name / and last unto the soul. And generally to speak of all /
we may say / that if you note well the great co^modites of obedience: you may
conclude the contrary upon disobedience. For of the co^modites worldly that been showed before of ye scripture i^ the book of Deutronominy / where ben
first promised many benedictions: unto obedience. Deu. 28. A.
Ibidem. B.
Forthwith does follow of disobedience thus. If thou wylt not be obediente unto
the precepts and ceremonies of thy lord and keep them truly* this
maledictio^s and curses shall light upon the. Thou shall be accursed in the
cite / and cursed in the^ field. Thy barn and corn shall be accursed and all
thine other goods and substance. The fruit of thy womb shall be accursed and
the fruit of thy land. And all the herdes of thy beasts and all the flocks of
thy sheep. Thou shall be cursed in going inward / and accursed in going
outward. Thus does appear: that disobedience does not only deprive religious
persons of all the co^modites promised unto obedience: but also does bring and
bind them unto the contrary inco^modites. For as the monasteries: where due
obedience is kept: done prospere with pleintie in all manner of commodites that
done apperteyne unto their worldly goods and substance: so in like manner unto
the contrary part / where is inobedience or disobedience: the monasteries
done dekay / fall unto ruin and pouerte / as did ye children of Israel for
their disobedience as does appear i^ diverse places of scripture. Saul the
first king of Israel / for his inobedie^ce: lost his realm and regne and his
heirs also for ever / whereby we may reasonably conjecture: that the ruin and
dekaye of such monasteries as done fall and come from an abbey (as they say)
unto a graunge: is the very punisshement of obedience. For wha^ co^munely the
subjects done rebelle / conjure and make parties again the souereynes / and
than done seek mayntenaunce of synguler persons or high powers: tha^ is
obedience lost and the substance and goods of the monastery: done come to
caytche that cayrche may / eueryche to follow his own proper will / ge^e what
he can / and use it as he will / so al comes unto naught. For as a wise
learned man says. Concordia parue res crescunt. Discordia autem: maxim
dilabu^tur. That is: by concord / unite / agreement and peace small or a few
worldly goods: shall increace and grow unto great riches. And contrary by
discord and debate: great substance shall be sparpuled and come all unto naught.
Our savior does confirm the same in the gospel saying. Marci. 2. B. Mar. 3.
D. Lu. 11. B.
Omne regnum in se diuisum desolabitur. If a hole realm be divided and at
debate in him self: it shall sone be desolate and come unto destruction. Thus
does appear the inco^modite of disobedience as unto the goods of the world.
But (as we said) the body is of more pryse and more to be regarded than the
world / and yet the inco^modite of disobedience thereunto is showed in diverse
places of scripture. Gene. 4. Numeri. 12. C.
Adam and Eve were punisshed in their bodies for their inobedience. And Marie
sister unto Moses and unto Aaron / for her rebellion: was stryken suddenly
with the plage of lepre. Pestilence and other peynes were also appointed in the
old law: Deu. 28. B.
for disobedience. Where is said. If thou be disobedient: our lord will send
unto the honger / thurst / and penury in all thy works / and he will also join
thereunto pestilence and he will stryke the with nedenes / with feures or axes
hot and cold and with cancres and corrupt eyres and he will in sue and chase
the with many mischeues. The heaven over the: shall be as styfe as brass / and
the yerthe under thy foot: like unto yren or stele. And instead of shoures:
god will reyne dust / and instead of dew: shall come down ashes. And thou
shall fall and fle before thine enemies / and thy carkas shall be left upon the
field for meat unto birds and bestes / thou shall be stryke^ with byles and
boytches / with scabbes and pockes / with incurable yche or ache. Thou shalt be
mased and mad / furiouse and blind. And ever full of rebuke and oppression.
And no man shall help / conforte or succure the. Deu. 17 B.
The judgment also of bodily death: was given for disobedience. Who so ever
(says holy scripture) does wax so proud / that he will not be obedient unto
the commandment of the priest that for ye time does minister and do service
unto our lord: let that man (by the decre of the judge) be put unto death. And
in an other place: Iosue. 1. D.
who so will be contrarious unto the bidding (said our lord unto Iosue) and
will not be obedient unto all the commandments: that I shall command by
thy mouth: let him be put to death. Here ben now many great incommodites that
done come unto the body for disobedience. And yet because (as is said) fame and
good name: is more precious than the body / we shall set forth some
inco^modites that done come unto ye fame by inobedie^ce. De. ci. dei li. 1. Ca.
Saint Augustyn says / that some peynymes and i^fideles have wylfully suffered
death / rather tha^ they would lose or yet hurt or hinder their good name and
fame / to be found false or vnfeythfull of their promise. But every religious
person: has (by solemn vow) promised obedience / ergo disobedience in
breaking that promise does render them infamouse. For it takes away / or (at
the leest) sore hurtethe and maymeth ye name and fame: in many diverse manners.
For it declares and proves the inobediente religious persons: thieves /
robbers / and liars. First they been thieves / because they stele that thing
and take unto their own use: that is not theyrs / but that does apperteine
unto a another person / that is to say: their proper will: which bylongeth
unto the souereyne And when they openly done deney the precepte of ye
souereyne: than ben they robbers. And in that they break their vow and
promise: they ben liars / false and infamouse / and so been they children unto
the dyuell. For he is a liar and the father thereof. To be a lepre: is not only
a hurt unto the body / but also a great blotte unto the fame of any person
although it were in a king or high estate. But saint Bernarde says / that
in the soul and mind of every person inobedient: In sermo. de lepra Naaman.
is a double leprie / that is to say: proper will. And proper sense or proper
counsel. Both ben lepres (says he) and of the worste manner and most
perilous lepries. And yet is proper counsel or proper sens (says he) the more
ieoperdous lepre / because it lies and lurketh prive and secret in the soul
and the more it does haboundes is multiplied therein: the rather does it and
more depely deceive the self person. For proper sense does cause all manner
of persons to stand well in their own favor / and in their own consceyte
to be very wise and excellent / and to approve them self in all things. And
to have (as saint Paul says) a great zeal / but without right knowledge. To.
10. A.
And therefore done they follow obstinately their own blyndenes and erroures.
And will not leyne / follow / ne give credence unto any counsel. For they done
swell and been puffed up with pride in their own vanite / so that they ben
pleased and done rejoice in them self. And in their own sight and estimacion
or supposicion: they ben great folks synguler excellent in all manner of
virtues. And therefore done they disdeyne / and set at naught all other persons
as did the proud Pharisey unto the poor Publicane. And so ben they ignorant
of the justice of god setting forth and following their own justice and
folysshe fantasy. Lu. 18. B.
For what can be more folisshe / and (as I said i^ the law of the church)
more unright wise / and contrary unto justice: To. 10. A. Leo Papa 24. q^. ^.
Quid aut inquius. Ibidem.
than that any one person should so far follow his own sense / proper
counsel and mind: that he will not believe ne give credence / unto them that
of auctorite ben more wise and more depely and better learned. But such manner
of persons (says the same law) ben let by some fantastical blyndnes or
darkness: to have ye knowledge of the troth / and therefore done they not resort
ne leyne unto any counsel or auctorite / but only unto the^ self. And
therefore ben they (of good justice and right) made the masters of erroures /
because they would not be the disciples of troth. Wherefore holy saint Bernarde
does counsel his trendes / sayng. De precep. et bispens.
Be you well ware (says he) that you begin not to habou^de i^ your own
sense / ne to have ouermoch confidence and trust in your own wit / lest
peradu^ture when you done ensue / follow and seek for light and true knowledge:
you (by the mock and deceyt of the dyuell your enemy) do stumble and fall
into derkenes and erroures. For as nothing is more necessary for religious
persons in their beginning than is humble or meke siplicite or simplenes and
also bayshfull grauite: So is nothing more perilous or more pestilenous poison:
tha^ is proper sense / self trust and proper counsel. For those done utterly
destroy all good religion and done put the persons in state and in ieopardy
of everlasting dampnacion by disobedience. For disobedience is in scripture
compared unto ydolatrie. 1. Re. 15.
Quasi peccatu^ ariolandi: est repugnare. et quasi scelus idololatrie: nolle
acquiescere. That is: To repugne and withstand the commandment of god: is
like unto the sin of wychecrafte. And not to have will to be obedient: is
like unto the great mischefe of ydolatrie / where ye gloss thereupon says that
every person disobedient: is condemned and accounted as an infidele or
feythles person. So ye here comes in the fourth manner of thynco^modite of
obedience / that is unto the soul. Ex specto spu^aliu^. 3. p. Ca. 9.
For nothing does (in a religious person) more depely displease our lord:
than does the disobedience of proper will. Ne any thing does make him more
in favor and familier friend unto the gostely enemy. Nor yet does any thing
in this life: more noy and hurt the self religious person. For as obedience
does make the religious person: the loving servant of our lord: so does
inobedience make him familier friend and fellow unto the dyuell. Eccl. 18.
The wise man therefore does counsel saying. Follow thou not thy
concupisce^ces and desires / and be not thou glad to be turned and counsayled
unto thy misordered proper will. For if thou satisfy and follow thine own
mind in the concupiscences and inordinate desires thereof: it shall cause and
bring the to be unto thine enemies comfort and pleasure. And also bring the
out of the grace and favor not only of man: Sup. Can.
but also of god. For saint Bernarde says of our lord and savior / he that
so much loved obedience / that he would rather lose his life: than lack
obedience: he (says he) will not love ne show his familiarite / ne gracious
favor unto the person inobedient. Proper will therefore (says he) is a
great yuell / Ibidem.
a grievous thing. Sith it causes the to lose the merits of all thine own
good works or deeds. So yt unto the: shall they be another good ne profitable.
Se than what shall profytte or avail unto the inobedie^t and wylfull religious
persons: all their pouerte / all their penury / nedenes and lack of pleasures
/ also of many things necessary. What shall avail their strayte custody and
guard of chastity / by fasting watchynge / hard weryng of garments and hard
leyng what shall avail their disciplines and corrections / their silence and
solitary life / their great and continual labors and peynes / and all the
holy ceremonies and obseruau^ces of religion. What (I say) shall these things
avail and profytte: if the persons do follow and use their proper will?
surely nothing shall they profyt at all as unto the merit of everlasting life
but all worse than lost. For saint Gregory says / Grego.
it is full like that those persons ben parteles of ye graces and benefits of
our lord: ye ben not obedient unto his will but rather unto their own froward
mind. Which thing our lord does show by his prophet Esaie. Esa. 28.
Se (says he) among your fastes labors and peynes: your own proper will
is fond / I find your proper will among all your works / which does cause
disobedience. Of all the creatures that ever god made: none done seem to be
disobediente / but tweyne alone / that is to say The dyuell and the sinful
man. Wherefore good reason will / that as the dyuell is in hatred of all folks /
and cursed / banned / yuell spoken of / and abhorred of all creatures: so
should the persons disobedient be compared and joined unto him / and taken or
accounted as his servants / fellows / and children / let therefore ye froward
hertes that be bent unto disobedience by ware. For the dyuell by disobedience
was cast out of heaven. For where (by nature of his creacion) he was bound to be
obediente unto the will of his lord and maker he (by election of proper will)
was inobedient / and so not only lost that pleasant place of bless where he
was: but also took possession as heneritau^ce everlasting in the pytte of
perdicion / there to remain in woe and pain perpetual world without end /
which pain of disobedience is in so much ye more to be dred: yt in him it is
unrecoverable / can never be forgyuen ne yet abated or eased / because it was
done by deliberate obstinacy and frowardnes. For although our first father
Adam and Eve: were put out of paradys for disobedience and so did taynt and
wound all their lynage: yet was there sin recouerable / because it was done
of freylte and by deceyte / but yet natwithstandynge / it might never be
recovered: but only by obedience / that was the justice of god. To. 5. D.
For (as saint Paul says) like as by the inobedience of one man: many were
made siners: so by ye obedience of one man: many were made just and ryghtwyse
persons / that was by our lord and savior Jesus. Note here well how
disobedience did depart the creatures from their creator and maker so that
(as seems) exco^municacion and curse does followed disobedience as a due pain
there unto. The first Angel (by curse) was departed from our lord for
disobedience. Our lord did curse the hole yerthe. For the disobedience of our
first pare^tes. Cayn was dampened for disobedience / and Came the sone of Noe /
was cursed by name i^ his sone Canaan for disobedience and lack of due honor
and reverence unto his father. Ge. 9. D.
The child that rebelled and cursed his parents: Leui. 20 B. Deu. 27 D.
was (by the law) for his disobedience: put to death / and also accursed. And
in another place. Cursed be that person that will not bide and rest by due
obedience: in the commandment of this law / and that will not perform the
same in work and deed. Deu. 28. A.
And yet again was said unto the people. If you will not keep the
commandment of god and be obedient / all these curses shall light upon you,
you shall be cursed in ye town and cursed in the field / and so forth as is
said before in this same Chapitre of the scripture which is the xxviii.
Chapitre of Deutronomy ben setforthe many mo punisshementes shameful / and
peynfull for disobedience which ben horrible and dreadful for a christian to
here of. And so much more terrible and fereful ben they unto christianes:
because ye among that people they were carnal / bodily / and te^porall / but
unto christianes: they ben spiritual and perpetual curses. And saint Paul
seems to declare the^ as excommunicate and accurse that been disobediente /
saying. 2. Cor, 10. B.
In promptu habentes ulcisti omnem inobedienciam. etc. We ben ready (says he)
to revenge all inobedience when we se your obedience accomplesshed and
fulfilled. 11. q^. 3. absit. et 25. q^. 2. Si quis.
The Canon or common law also (by plain decre and determinacion of ye
church) does show the persons inobedient to be accursed. Byware therefore
good devout religious persons of all disobedience / and specially by
contempt. For saint Bernarde says / that the contempt of obedience: De
precep. et bispens.
is always dampnable in those things yt ben ordened by the rules and
commanded by the prelates to be kept under pain of deedly sin. For i^ every
law: some things ben to be regarded as apperteynyng unto precepte or
commandment and some things as unto monicion or warning. In the old law
the.x. commandments / were all to be regarded as precepts and so to be
kept. And likewise in the new law ben the.xii. articles of our feyth yet in
ye old law were monicions / warnynges or cou^sayles / as / Coram cano capite:
Leui. 19.
confu^ge, et honora personam senis. That is: before a hoar head: arise or
stand up / yt is to mean when aged persons done come unto presence: arise
and give them rowme and place. And do honor and due reverence unto thine
elders and betters. That was a monicion of ye old law / and so in the new
law ben the cou^saylles of ye gospelles. Among the decrees and laws of the
church: many ben monitorie and as counsayles and many precepts / and plain
commandments. So in like manner / some things in religion ben ordened (by ye
holy fathers) in their rules and co^stitucions: to be kept as precepts under
pain of deedly sin. And some as monicio^s or cou^sayles under pain of
venial sin / or under pain of certain punissheme^tes / assigned or
appointed i^ their said ordinances / natwtstandyng contempt is always to be
fered and avoided. Distin. 25. unum.. Criminis.
For saint Augustyne says (as is put in a canon or common law) that no sin
is so venial: but (if a person take pleasure therein / and do it by contempt
that is despysynge the law) it may be made criminal / where some persons:
done take this term criminal: for deedly sine / but I am not of ye opinion.
For a venial sin: can never be deedly of it self without varia^ce of person
or circu^sta^ce yet may yt contempt be deedly sin / in a thing that were no
sin at all / as to trede upon two strawes in cross. How be it saint
Augustyne in ye forsayde text: does not say mortal or deedly / but criminal.
And forthwt i^ ye same place: Ibidem.
is ye self term or word criminal: declared not to signify always dedly sine
/ but rather sometime venial. And sometime it does signify and betoken such
sin as seems unto ye law worthy open penance or punisheme^t. And yt i^
case: might fortune unto a person without any sin deedly or venial / yet (say
I) let every religious person byware of contempt of the leest ceremony yt
bylongethe unto religion not only of disobedience. The wise man says in his
proverbs. Pro. 28. A.
Those persons yt done forsake and ^ate not for the law: done praise and
hold with them yt ben disobedient. And those yt done keep ye law be ke^d led
and inflamed again the^ / but those yt done keep ye law and be obedient:
those ben wise. Ibidem. B.
And who so ever done decline and put away their ears and hearing from the
law and will take no head thereunto: their prayer shall be execrable / that is to
say: horrible / abominable and loathsome. Augusti.
And saint Augustyne says / that who so ever is contrarious unto the
commandments of god or of the sodemyn^ does not deserve to have that he
^sked and desires in prayer. Matthew. 12. D. Marci. 3. D. Luce. 8. D.
But the true obediences is always by loved and ever herd graciously and
accounted of Christ him self: not only as his servant or friend ^ bu^ also
as his brother / sister / and mother love (...) therefore obedience / and
avoid and fle disobedience.

Of a breue or short recount or rehearse of the premysses by order of
scripture. The.xxiiii. Chapitre.
THat al religious persons: should the rather love the excellent virtue of
obedience / and the more fere ordered / hate and abhor or loath this abominable
sin of inobedience or disobedience: we have here setforthe a breue or short
Epiloge / recapitulacion or recounte of the said inco^modites or punisshement
and peynfull rewards of disobedience after the order of scripture. First than
we may begin at the example of the first Angel Lucifer that (hy
disobedience) lost the pleasant place of heuens bless / and when thereby the
peynfull pit of hell / there to remain for ever / in woe and pain / in shame
and rebuke perpetual. Gene. 3.
The example also / of our first pare^tes Adam and Eue^ that (by the same vice)
lost the possession of paradyse / and where they were in possibilite never to
deyene suffer disease: and in most high honor end dignite: they fell into
the misery of all manner of sekenes and death infamous unto the day of dome and
(except the redemption of our savior) Dampened Gene. 4.
for ever. Cayn also their eldest sone / lost the co^tre of his natiuite and
birth / the company and presence of his parents / outlawed and put to flight
as a renegate / every where in shame and rebuke / in continual fear and dread
of his life / and at the last slain in his body / and dampened in soul for
ever / and all that came of him / by whose syn: al ye world was drowned
except.viii. persons. Gene. 7.
And yet after ye destruction and flode one of those.viii. persons (by
disobedience in dishonor and irreverence of his father) fell in like
vengeance in him and his. Ge. 9. D. Gen 11. B.
For the presumpcion of disobedience in byldyng of the toure of Babylone: the
people were divided unto diverse tongues. Ge. 12. A.
And all they fell into ydolatry and forsook our lord god: except Abraham and
his wife and Loath and his / whom our lord caled from among the other people
/ and put them into the land of beheste. And yet of all the children that
Abraham had: none did follow our lord (by their fathers steps) in obedience:
but Isaac alone. The great cites of Sodom and Gomorre with other: Gene. 19.
did synke for disobedience. And Lottes wife was turned in a salt stone. The
eldest sone of Isaac was cast out of the favor of god / for disobedience. For
when he knew the pleasure and will of his father: he did wylfully there
against. And the children of Jacob had great trouble and sorrow for
disobedience. Gel. 28. B. Ibid. 44. Fx. 7. et aliis. Exodi. 21. Exo. 32. F.

The disobedience of king Pharao: was punisshed by many plages. And many
punisshementes been set forth unto the children of Israel for disobedience. In

Pain of death was assigned unto the prestes: if (after their consecracion) they
went forth among the people wtin: Leu. 10 A.
vii. days. Nadab and Abiu / ye children of Aaron (for disobedience) were
suddenly stryken unto death with fire from heaven. Leui. 17.
The common people that of their own auctorite / without the prestes: would
take upon the^ to do sacrifice / or to make oblacions: were cursed of god for
their inobedie^ce. Ibide^. 18.
And likewise of the^ / ye contrary unto the commandment of god would abuse
them self in ye sin of the flesh with such persons as there were
prohibit and forboden. These persons also that misuse their bodies in the
sin of the flesh / contrary unto nature: ben cursed / and so been they yt
done leyne and follow wychecrafte and charms by disobedience. Ibide^. 19. et
20.
Pain of death was appointed unto them that (by disobedience) did approach or
come nere unto the tabernacle of testimony in the old law: except only the
tribe of Leui. Numeri. 1. G.
None other persons should touch ne yet curiously look upon the vessels ne
upon the ornaments and apparel of the sanctuary: Nu. 4. B.
under pain of death for their disobedience. If any persons also (by
disobedience) would not keep the feste of Ester / according unto the
commandment they should be excommunicate and accursed. Ibi. 9. B. Ibi. 11. A.
And the fire of the vengeance and wrath of our lord destroyed many of the
people / that (by disobedience) murmured and grudged with the labors that he
had assigned and appointed them. And of the^ that (by concupiscence and
gloutonous desire to eat flesh) did murmr again the Manna and heavenly
meat of gods sendyng: Ibide^. G.
many were slain by the plage of god. And Marie the sister of Moses for her

the other company. Ibi. 14. D.
All the children of Israel that came out of Egipte / except tweyne: deyed in

despise his commandment: shall perysshe and be lost. Dathan and Abiron (for
disobedience) did synke into hell / with all their household and substance and
fire from heaven destroyed Chore and all his company. Ibi. 16. E.
Those persons that would not be obedient: Nu. 18. D.
duly to pay their tithes: were iuged by our lord unto death. Moses and Aaron
the great servants of god: for their in obedience: Ibi. 20. B.
lost the great honor of the ledyng and bringyng of the children of Israel
into the land of byheste. And for inobedience: Nu. 21. B.
our lord send among the children of Israel venomous serpents that destroyed
and slew many of the people. And in a another place our lord commanded Moses
to hang up the princes of the people again the son. Ibi. 25. B.
And xxiiii. thousand were slain also for disobedience. Moses showed unto
the people / that if they would be disobedient wha^ they should come unto the
land of byhest: Deu. 4 D. et 8. D. et Ibi. 11. D,
they should be shortly destroyed and come unto naught. If you keep true
obedience (says our lord (you shall have benediction and blessyng and if you
be disobediente: you shall have contrary malediction and curse / and
throughout all the book of Deutronomie: ben meruaylous thretes or thretynges of
our lord: set forth unto the breakers of obedience. And after the death of
Moses: all the people did bind them self under pain of death: Iosue. 1 D,
to be obediente unto Iosue / whom our lord had appointed to be in the stead
of Moses: as they were unto Moses. And sone after for the disobedience of one
man: the children of Israel were sore disconfytte of their enemies / put to
flight and many slain / and that man him self after: Iosue. 7. per totum.

In a another place is showed where the children of Israel were gadred by one
assent to sle and destroy certain of their own brethren for supposed
disobedience / but wha^ they knew the truth: they were appeased. And after
Iosue that was next captain after Moses: Ibide^. 23. D. et 24.
showed the children of Israel that they would keep obedience: they should
prospere in all things / and if not: they should all be destroyed and come to
naught. Iudi. 2. D. et 3. B. et 4. A. et 6. A.
After ye death of Iosue the people of god (for their inobedie^ce) were put into
the hands and power of their enemies and sold as bond caytiues / and put
unto great misery / and ever when they returned unto obedience: they were
delivered. Iudi. 8. B.

ferefull and dreadful of disobedience / knowing ye god would do punisheme^t
thereupon. The holy prophet David in the first psalm of the Psalter does
commend obedience and bless the obedient persons. P. al. 1.
Whereof does follow that the contrary ben cursed. And the punisshemente does
follow in ye same psalm. Where is said Non sic impij, non sic. and so forth
that is: The wyked persons shall not be so blessed but rather punisshed for
disobedience as there does follow forthwt / and in the second psalm also and
through out the hole psalter in many places. Psalm. 2.
The wise man says in the beginning of his paraboles or proverbs: Pro. 2. A.
does show that he ordened that book to teach obedience / and does in the
first chapitre show the reward thereof / and forthwith the punisshemente and
ieoperty of disobedience. And few chapitres in the hole book: that done not
make some mention of both obedience and disobedience. Ecclesias. 1. et 2. etc.
And in his book caled Ecclesiastes. At the first beginning: he declares the
folly or folyshnes and many inco^modites of disobedience / and in many places of
the same: he shows the ieoparty and pains thereof. In the book of the
Canticles: Canti. 1.
is showed the synguler love and favor that our lord has unto the persons
obedient / and that they again have unto him / whereby must need follow that he
has great displeasure unto the persons inobedie^t / and that is there showed
where he says: Ibid. 2. D.
Take us these little foxes that done destroy our vynyardes. For now they
done bygynne to flower / by the young little foxes: ben the persons in
obediente understand and meant: which ben heretics / sismatykes / and
rebels in religion / which in the beginning when they been young should be
testreyned. In the book of sapience: Sapi. 1. A.
the wyseman teaches in the beginning thereof: to love Justice / and that is to
be obedient / and sone after he says ye peruers cogitacions / froward in
obedient thoughts: done depart a person from god. Ibi. 2. A. B
The obedient persons ben weary of good life / and therefore done counsel to

obedient ever unto him. Ibi. 3. A. C
And the wyked persons shall have after their thoughts corrupcion and
dampnacion because they were negligent and recedent and ran away from our
lord by disobedience. In all that hole book: obedience is much praised / and
disobedience ever rebuked. Ecclesi. 1. A. B. Ibide^. D.
And in the book that follows caled Ecclesiasticus / is showed that there is
but one god / unto whom all creatures should be obedient / and the co^modites
ben there showed thereof / and commandment given / that no person should be
rebellious or disobedient / and there ben showed forth with the great
ieopardies of disobedience. Ecclc. 3. E
The third Chapitre of this book: have we translate and setforth before in the
treatese for householders wherein is showed that child inobedient is always
infamous and accursed of god. Ibi. i8. D.
And therefore (says he afterward) follow not thine own desire / for if thou
do and so be disobedient: it shall make the to be unto thine enemies: Ibi. 41.
B.
conforte and pleasure. And yet again / woo and vengeance (says he) be unto
you disobedient persons / where follows that they been accursed both in life
and death. Esai. 1. A.
Esaias the prophet in the first beginning of his prophecy: does complain
(in the person of god) upon the disobedient persons / and asks vengeance
upon them and with merueylous many great rebukes: Esai. 58. ecce i^ die.
does show ye ieopartes and periles of disobedience / and how al good deeds
ben lost by the proper will of disobedience. And in like manner the prophet
Hieremie was sent forth by out lord / Hiere. 1. et 2.
to show unto the people their disobedience and the ieopartes and
punisshementes thereof / and how all their captivity into Babylon: was for
disobedience. Ibi. ulti.
And in his trenes or lamentacions all over the book: Treno. 1.
he by wepeth and bywayleth the disobedience of the people / and the misery
whereunto they fell for the same. Baruche 1. A. D.
And in the prophet Baruche is showed / that when the people that were in
captivity herd the prophet read of the disobedience of their parents: Ibi. 2.
C. et 3. A. etc.
they fell into deep contricion and unto prayer / and sent forth unto the^ that
were in jury for prayers and confessed that all their trouble was for
inobedience. Ezechi. 1.
Our lord god did send the prophet Ezechiel (after he had seen a merueylous
vision) unto the people of the of the Iues / whom he caled apostatas: Ibi. 2.
B. Ibi. 3. ^ Ibi. 21. A.
because that by disobedience they had departed from him. Wherefore there done
follow many great rebukes / and many thretes. In the beginning also of the
prophet Daniell: Dani. 1. A.
is showed how the people of god were brought in captivity for disobedience /
which disobedience the said Daniel and his fellows being in the fournes of
fire: did openly confess. Ibi. 3. C. D


Nabuchodonosor was put down from his kingdom and turned into the lykenes of
a beast / for his inobedience. And his sone for disobedience: Ibi. 4. F.
Ibi. 5. G.
was slain and his realm given unto strangers In the prophet Osee: Osee. 1.
B. C. et 2. A. Ibi. 13. et 14. Joel. 1. D. Amo. 1. C. Abdi. 1. C.
ben showed marvelous thretes unto the people for inobedie^ce and rebukes and
utter destruction. After the same manner does the prophet Joel move ye people
to byweyle and mourn their transgression and disobedience. And ye prophet
Amos has a like process through / and al for inobedie^ce. And Abdias was sent
to show ye punisheme^t of inobedience. Jonas for disobedience was cast into

their inobedie^ce. Jonas. 1. et 2. Miches. 1. A.
Micheas the prophet caleth our lord god unto wytnes of disobedience of the
people and shows the punishment that should come thereof. Naum. 1. A. et 3.
A. Haba. 1 A.
The Prophet Nau^ shows that god will take vengeance upon disobedience as a
person that were in fury or an anger. Habacuc says that by disobedience: the
law of god was torn or rent / and judgment came not unto any perfect
conclusion or end / because the wyked persons: did prevail again the just
and ryghtwyse persons The prophet Sophonias says that god will punisshe man
and best for disobedience / and shows the terrible and dreadful vengeance
that shall come therefore. Soph. 1 A.
Aggeus shows the great penury that fell for disobedience: Aggei. 1. B. et 2.
C. zadha. 1 A.
in the yerth / honger / thurst / and cold with other many incommodites. The
prophet zachary / shows the great displeasure anger and wrath: that our
lord had for disobedience. And the remedy ever in all these prophets / was
only the return unto obedience, In the beginning of the book of the
Machabies is showed the disobedience of certain rennegates: 1. Macha. 1. B.
that were cause of much sore and mischefe. Josephus and Azarias capitaines of
the people: Ibid. 5. F.
for their inobedience unto their souereyne were put unto rebuke and many of
the people slain. The people of god that were in Jury: 2. Macha. 1. A.
send unto them that (by disobedience) fled into Egipte / to be revoked. / The
great tyranny and persecucion that the people of god suffered / was for the
inobedience of their parents. Thus all the old law through out does show
Ibid. 7. F.
does show the many fold inco^modites of inobedience. And the new law is
not void of the same. For saint Johan baptiste that was sent before our
savior to prepare and make ready his way: Matthew. 3. A. B. Matthew. 4. C. 5. D. 6.
A. 7. A. Ibi. 11. A. Lu. 10. B. Ibi. 18. B. Mar. 14 C. Matthew. 23. B. et Luce
11. F.
did move the people to do penance for their disobedience / showing unto
them: that the ire and vengeance of god was nere and at hand. So did our
savior also preach unto the people penance. In the.v.vi. and.vii. Chapitre
of the gospel of Mattheu ben diverse inco^modites showed of disobedience. Our
lord also cursed the cites of Corrosaim and Bethsaida for their disobedience.
And unto those persons that should give accasion and show example of yuel: he
said vengeance and woe should come on the^ in like manner. And unto the scribes
and pharisees he said. woe and vengeance should come to them for their in
obedience / and he showed unto Judas that woe and vengeance should come unto
him: Matt. 26. B. et Luc. 22. C. Matthew. 21. B. et Mar. 11. B. Io. 2. C. Act. 5.
A. To. 1. C. 1. Cor. 5. B.
if he would continue his purpose of disobedience. He did also drive and beat
out the buyers and sellers i^ the temple and rebuked them sore: for their
inobedience. An any and Sapphiry his wife: were suddenly stryken to death for
disobedience. Saint Paul says: the ire and wrath of our lord god: is showed
from heaven / upon the persons inobedient / and there he showed the horrible
punisshementes that followed upon them that knew god and were not obedient
thereafter. And in another place he cursed a man for disobedience / unto his
father. He cursed also the Galathese: Gala. 1. B.
if they would be disobedient unto his doctrine / although an Angel of heaven
should preach the contrary / and after he asked who had bewyched them unto
disobedience. Ibi. 3. A.
Ephe. 6 A.
And after he says that every person shall be rewarded according unto his
obedience. Some persons rebellious and disobediente: Phi. 1. C.
did preach again saint Paul for very envy and malice and yet he cared not
therefore so Christ might be known and showed thereby. Ibi. 2. E. Colo. 2. B.
Some were disobedient for their own lucre not for Christ. Byware (says he)
that you be not deceived by false Philosophers and fall into disobedience. 1.
Thessa. 4. A. 2. Thessa. 1. C.
For who so ever does despice and will be disobedient unto that we say: does
not despise man: but god. And the vengeance of god from heaven: shall (with
flaming fire) light upon them that been disobedient unto the word and gospel
of god. 1. Timo. 1. A.
Saint Paul left his disciple Timothey where he had preached: to keep the
people from disobedience. And after he did openly curse certain persons that
were disobedient. Ibide^. D. Ibi. 6. A.
Those bond servants (says he) that have masters among the feythfull
people: let them not be disobedient unto them. 2. Ti. 1. D. Ibide^. 3 A.
And in a another place he does complain that certain persons were unto him
disobedient. And yet after that / how persons would be disobedient and what
should be their pain and punisshemente therefore. Titu^. 1. C.
And he commanded his disciple saint Titel that he should sharply correct
the inobedient persons. Heb. 1. A.
And unto the Ebreuse he says yt inobedie^ce has been ever justly punisshed /
and therefore let not us believe or trust to escape if we be disobediente Saint
James in his epistle does persuade his disciples unto due obedience: Iaco. 1. C.
and revoke the^ from inobedience. For our lord god (says he) does resist
the proud and disobedient persons / and unto the meke and obedient persons:
Iaco. 4. B.
1. Pe. 1. C.
he gives grace. And saint Petre says / go forth in grace as children of
obedience and leave utterly your fore used disobedience and all the malice /
gyle / dissimulacion / envy / and all detractions bylongyng thereunto. Ibi. 2. A.
And again he warned the people to by ware of the persons of inobedie^ce /
showing the ieopertes thereof. 2. Pe. 2. A. ibi. B. C. D
And yet again he said that ever there have been some false prophets of
disobedience / and such should come among the^ / and there he showed what
vengeance our lord would take upon the^ for their disobedience. 1. Io. 2. A.
And saint Johan says / that who so ever says he knowith god and is
inobedie^t unto his commandments: is a false liar and troth is not in that
person. And again / Who so ever is inobedient unto the doctrine of Christ:
2. Io. B.
has no god / but is feythles. And in a another place: 3. Io. C. Jude. B.
he rebukes a certain person by name: for disobedience. And the holy Apostle
Jude / says that the persons of disobedience entryng among the good people
did much hurt / and after he shows what ve^geau^ce our lord will take upon
the persons of disobedience. Ibide^. E.
The Appocalips over all: Appoca.
does challenge and rebuke the persons disobedient and does show the pain and
punisshement thereof. The doctoures of the church in like manner Saint Hierome
i^ his epistles: Iero. ti. 1.
shows of a monk caled Malchus / that for his inobedience unto his abbote:
suffered great trouble and ieopardy both of soul and body. Augustinus de ci.
dei.
And saint Augustyne does allow the justice of a pagan or paynem caled Marcus
torquatus a captain of the Romans / that put his own sone unto death for
disobedience / because that (contrary unto his commandment) he made battle
again his enemies / natwithstandyng also yt he had a noble victory / as
writes Valerius maximus And he says in a certain place that the principal
and most great yuell and mischefe of all things: Valerius maximus. super
Gene. ad littera^ li. 8. Ca. 6. C.
is to follow self will / which is caled (says he) inobedience. A certain
person that by saint Benet was delivered of a wyked spirit: was by
inobedience: accept and taken again of the same spirit. And in vitas Patrum:
been many examples of many sundry and diverse peynes and punisshementes that
have followed this great abominable sin of disobedience / and showed unto the
monicion and warnyng of all christianes / specially religious persons. I
byseche our lord we may all take heed thereunto and ever for the reverent
dread of him: we may avoid and flee all occasions thereof. Amen. And thus an
end of this first membre of this third part which is the first board of
our vessel / Town / or Pype / the other (with the help and grace of our
lord) shall shortly follow.

A work or book of the reverent father and noble clerk holy saint Bernarde /
named by ye title thus. De precepto et dispensatione. That is to say / of
commandment and dispensacion / which is to mean: how / and in what things
/ and in what form or manner: the souereynes of religion / may command and
dispense with their subjects. And again how and wherein the subjects should
be obedient / which said work is translate and turned in to English by a
brother of Syon Richard Whytforde.

The preface of the translatour as argument unto the work that follows.
Because (good devout readers) the matter that folowethe may be unto you the
more open and plain: you shall understand ye two religous men monks of saint
Benettes rule: made insta^ce mean and request (by writing of diverse
epistles) unto saint Bernarde / to have knowledge and exposicion or declaracion
(for their conscience) of certain points of their said rule. And he (to
satisfy their devout mind) made this book or work for an answer. And did
dedycate / direct / and send forth ye same work unto a father of religion /
the abotte of Columbens / and by him to be send unto him that was abbotte and
souereyne unto ye said religious brethren. The end of ye preface.

Saint Bernardes Epistle. The title. Brother Bernarde / caled abbote of
Clareuall: unto the lord abbote of Columbens / salutacion.
I Have cured and given diligence: to send first unto you (according unto my
promise) my writing of answer unto ye epistles of the two brethren monks of
Carnoteus / wherein also the other thing that you commanded: is fulfilled. For
where I had determined shortly to writ unto the^ again and to have rendered
(an epistle for answer unto both their epistles: I have now (at your request:
as you may se) drawn my style and matter in length unto ye form of a book or
work. So that by many things: put so in length and in more large declaracion
many persons may be the more largely edified / which work (when you have
red and seen over) Deliver (I pray you) not unto them for whom it was made:
but first unto their abbote. And after (if their abbote so command) let it
come unto them / for they been religious persons. Note that nothing may be
sent forth ne received without license.
And therefore as (by the law and ordinance of their rule) they ben prohibitte
and forboden to send forth any epistles / writings or letters: without
knowledge and license of their abbotte: So ben they (like manner) prohibit and
forboden any thing to receive. For which cause: I have (as you know well)
differred and tarried the answer or in making answer although it were much
and often required of them. For because (as it seemed unto me) they presumed to
send their epistles unto me: without license or knowledge of their abbote / and
ye thing did not I suspect without cause / as after I plainly perceived and
proved. I gave unto this work at the beginning (as unto the reders may
appear) the name of an epistle. But because that now (by your co^mau^demente)
the matter has passed the measure and common manner of that name to be caled an
epistle: let it be caled a book or a work and not an epistle. And forbycause /
that among other questions and conclusions by me in the same work answered and
determined this thing is most chefly and most subtely or clearly / and (as I
trust) profytably entreated / that is to say: what commandments / and by
whom / and how largely dispensacions may be given or granted: let the book
have this title / and be caled the book of precepte or commandment / and
dispensacion. Except any other title seem unto you more convenient. Vale /
fare you well.

The prologe of holy saint Bernarde / unto his book / draght / or treaty / of
precept and dispe^sacion.
By what excuse and mind: may I now keep silence? and yet / by what boldness
or hardines: may I speak brother? you (by your many fold epistles and
messages) done so constreyne and compel me: that other I must bytraye /
disclose and show forth mine own folly or ignorance: or else must I deney the
office of charity. But I rather wyllyng to be found and proved without doctrine
/ co^nyng or lernyng: which does move unto pride: 1. Cor. 8.
than to be found or proved without that virtue that does edify all persons
/ that is charity (now at the last: vanquisshed and ouerco^men by your request
and prayer) have put my soft and tender nails unto hard knottes and (as I
feere) not otherwise than to be bruised or broken. Here by does saint Bernarde
mean that he does interpryse and take i^ hand a work of great difficulty and
hard labor.
But all this do I speak (as appears unto you) i^ vain. For (as you writ
and as before you have written) mine own writing (when I am absent) and mine
own words (when I am present) done render and declare me inexcusable / to
make only excuse. For what rowme or place is left form to complain or to
lay for my self any impossibilite i^ these matters? specially unto you / that
done by believe for a certeynte (both of the evidence of my words and of my
heart or mind) what or how much I can do i^ such things? Trustyng therefore
in your feyth and believe or opinion rather than in mine own wit: I shall
enter this deep see of subtyle questions / not knowing (god wot) how nor
which way to get out and to escape drownyng. The charity of my heart shall
pressed be and ready / would our lord: that troth may be in like manner as ready.
But if (by chance) defaulte of wit can not excuse my deed: yet surely shall
you not have cause to blame my good will. I will attent and asay to comprehend
and bring to gether: all your questions (if I may) in a short manner after the
form of a pystle / although the pistle be not short. For it is no merueyle
though I be somewhat long in discussyng / exponing and assoiling of your
questions whyll you in only puttyng and moving of them: have made unto me
tweyne epistles and those very long.

The self tracte or work.
THe first question (than) of your demand: is about our reule / whereof (if I
be not deceived) all ye other questions have ground / occasion or beginning.
For you done dema^de or ask: how / or under what form or manner / and how
far / or how depely: the institucion and ordinance of our said rule /
should be weyed / pondred or considered / of them or unto them that done
profess ye same. That is to say: A question of.iii. members or perres The
first.
whether all the points of the same rule / should be supposed and accounted as
precepts and commandments to be kept under pain of deedly sin: and so
consequently to be unto the brekers / damnous and ieopardous of dampnacion. Or
else whether the said points of ye rule: The second membre of the question.
ben but only counsayles. And by that reason: the vow / profession or promise
of the^ should not be of any weght or but very little charge. And the breakyng
of the^: no great offense or trespass. The third
Or else (for the third part you would know) whether some of the said points
ben deputed and appointed as precepts and commandments. And other some: be
reputed and supposed as only counsayles. And so the said points might for one
part be lawfully broken / and for the other part: might in no wise so be. And
yet for there / if I would grant this last distinction (that is to say: that
some of the said points of the rule: ben counsayles only / and some
commandments) Tha^ done you forther require / that I should setforth and
lymitte all those points ynto their proper distinction / that is to say: to
show which points ben lymitted and assigned unto precepte and commandment
/ and which unto counsel only / lest else peradventure occasion might be
given unto some persons to waure and to follow at more liberte and pleasuce
the variau^t opinions of their own sense / wit or understanding. And so might
they by chance or in case (as is said in proverb) melt or mynce a gnat / and
swalowe a Camel hole / to stumble at a straw and leap over a block / that
is to mean: to have in some points: to little conscience / and in some: over
much because they know not how much cure and diligence they should give
unto every obseruaunce This (as far as I can remember) is ye same sense or
meaning of your particion and demand. All tvoughe they be not the same
words. And in that you subioyne and continue to inquyre and ask of obedience:
by what degrees it is divided / and i^ which terms and points it is
concluded / restreyned or determined: apperteyneth (as I suppose) unto ye same
division. Specially sith among all the decrees and precepts of our rule:
obedience is the chief. And I suppose (if due and sufficient answer be made
thereunto) nothing shall remain of the other quesstions: that may be douted.
The rule (than) of saint Benedicte: is (after my judgment and understanding)
offered and setforth indifferently unto all manner of persons. And unto no
person commanded or charged / it does much profytte if it be duly received
and truly kept. And yet natwithstandyng: if it be not received: it does
nothing noyne hinder. For that thing that is in the proper will of the /
receyuour, and not in the power of the purposer / mouer or ordiner: may I well
call voluntary and not necessary / that is to say: a thing to be received of
fre will at liberty / and not of any necessite / natwithstandyng ye same thing
that now I call voluntary: if a person by proper will do ones admit and
receive and promise from thens forth to keep and perform it: for a surety
than does he covert and turn the same thing unto him self: into necessite.
So that now he has not at liberte and in power to leiue and forsake that
thing that before he had fre and in liberte not to take. Therefore that thing
that (of proper will) he has received and taken: he must now of necessite
hold and keep. For he must of extreme necessite: render and yield unto our
lord those vows yt his mouth has deliberately professed and spoken. Psalm. 65.
And so of his own mouth and proper word: he must nedely be condemned or
justified natwithstandyng (as an holy man says) That necessite is happy and
gracious: Luce. 9.
that constreyneth or byndeth a person unto the better. All the institutes and
ordinances of saint Benedicte: except a few institutes made of spiritual
things / as (by example) of charity / of humilite / and of myldnes and such
other / which institutes (of a surete) god and not saint Benedicte did ordeyne
/ and therefore may (in no wise) be changed all other institutes I say: unto
the^ yt done not profess the^: be to be accounted and taken only for
monicions or cou^sayles / and therefore they nothing grieve ne hurt ye persons
wha^ they be not kept. But unto the^ ye wilfully and lawfully profess them:
they must be reputed accounted and taken as precepts or commandments of
bondage and duete and unto their breakers / as offenses or defaultes grievously
to be corrected or punisshed or else thus (because I would render or rehearse unto
you: your own words) They ben unto the^ that done not profess the^ to be
ryghtly reputed voluntary / and at liberte.

And unto their professers: necessary and as natural institucions. So yet
surely do I call them necessary: that of them no prejudice should come unto
necessary and reasonable dispensacions. But that despensacion in such
things: is not committed unto all persons but only unto them that may say
with the Apostles. 1. Cor. 4.
Sic nos existimet homo. etc. Let every person suppose and think us to be the
ministers of Christ and the dispensers of the ministeries of god. For the
feythfull and prudent servant whom our lord has ordened as steward and
governor of his household: knows well there only to use dispe^sacion:
whereof he may have good recompens and reward. For that is required among
dispensatours: that eueryche be found feythfull and true. And peradventure /
the same or like fidelite is required of the subjects in obeyng: Vt supre.
that is required of ye souereynes in dispensyng. Thus (than) does plainly
appear of those things that been said before: that your said division: is
complete / hole / and sufficient if the persons also and times in like manner
be divided. Sith that unto the subjects: all reguler institucions (as far
only as does apperteyne unto corporal obseruaunces) ben volu^tarie before
their profession but after necessary. And again unto the prelates: the same
institucions (as unto dispensacion) ben partly voluntary / as unto those
institucions that were found by man. And partly ben they necessary: as in
those that been of the ordinance of god / wherefore the same division: may
peradventure appear more congruent and more clear or bright to be understand:
if that same membre / that we / caled necessary: be again sub divided into
these three manners of necessaries / that is to say: into steadfast or stable
necessite. Inviolable or / vnsoulable necessary. And into incomutable or
unchangeable necessary. That thing (than) do I call steadfast or stable
necessary: that is so necessary or of such necessite: The first part of
this subdiuision
that is not (by every person) but only by the dispe^sers of the mysteries of
god / that is to say: the prelates or souereynes: lawful to be changed. As by
example The rules of holy fathers as of saint Basyle / saint Augustine / saint
Benedicte / and also the autentike canons law and all such other
ecclesiastical institutes or ordinances worthily and duly made by auctorite
/ which said rules and statutes (because they were stablisshed and ordened by
holy fathers) done persevere and continue stably and steadfastly / as they were
made and stableshed / so that none of the subjects may (by any mean) vary or
change them or any of them. Because natwithstandyng: they were ordened and
made by men: they may again (by such men as in their places and rowmes or
offices done succeed by canonical election / and so have auctorite thereunto) be
lawfully sometime: according unto the case or chance / or unto the person /
place / or time dispensed with. Herein / I would the reders hereof: should take
good head and note well: yt I (by good warnes and auisement) do not say that
these things before said may lyghtely at the will and pleasure of the same
souereynes be changed: but that (of good reason) they may feythfully be
dispensed with. The said statutes therefore may (under the said form and of
the said persons) suffer exchange / that is to say: may be lawfully changed:
because they ben not naturally ne by them self good. But that they were found
instituted and ordened by man. Not because me^ might not otherwise laufully
live: but that so to live were more expedient. And plainly not unto any other
end or purpose: than unto the lucre and wynnyng / and unto the custody and
guard or keeping of charity. As long (than) as they do service unto charity: so
long ben they immovably fixed and stablysshed. And may in no wise: no (I say)
not by the self souereynes: be (without offense) changed. But if (on the
contrary part) they (peradventure at any time) ben seem or done seem (unto
them only that have power and auctorite so to judge and that have cure and
charge so to provide and look thereunto) contrary unto charity: A question.
does it not tha^ appear evident: to be very justice and most right: yt those
institucions that were found for charity: should also for charity (were / it
seems or is seen expedient) other be omitted and utterly left / or else be put
away and set a side for a time: Or else into some other statutes (peradventure
more commodious) be / committed and changed? like as on the contrary part /
it should (without any doubt) be unjust and unrighteous if the statutes yt were
made for charity alone: should contrary unto charity be holden / kept and
continued All those statutes (than) that done apperteyne unto this stable
necessary: done keep / hold / and continue their fyxed and firmed immobilite
and stablement / and that also as unto the self prelates / but that is as
far as they done serve and apperteyne unto charity. But am I he alone that so
does think and judge? or am I the first that so has said? nay surely. For
pope Gelacius does judge and say ye same. For thus he says. Where is no
necessite or need: let ye decrees of the holy fathers: remain and continue in
strength and auctorite. Leo also the pope i^ like manner / where no necessite
is (says he) let by no means: ye institutes and ordinances of holy fathers
be violate or defouled. But where need is (says he forthwith) unto the vtilite
and profitte of ye church: or congregation: let him yt has power dispe^ce
therwt / for change of law may be made for necessite. The second membre of
this subdiuision necessary.
Forthermore now ye necessary or necessite / yt before I named i^uiolable or
vnderfoulable in no manner to be broken ne changed: I understand and mean ye
necessary or needful statute yt not by man ordened but by god him self
commanded and publyshed: may i^ no wise be changed ne broken but only by god
yt made and ordened it. As by example of these commandments. Thou shall slay
no man. Thou shall do no lechery. Thou shall do no theft / and so forth of ye
other commandments of ye table of the law / which said commandments:
although they do not admit ne suffer i^ any wise any dispe^sacion of man nor
yet al though it be not lawful ne ever may be lawful for any man to break or
change any of the^ by any mean god natwtsta^dyng has of the^ broken which he
would and wha^ he would / as does appear in scripture. Exo. 12.
Other when he commanded ye Ebreus / ye children of Israel: to rob ye
Egipciens ye people of Egipte. Osee. 1. A.
Or wha^ he commanded ye holy prophet to have mixtion and act of generacio^
with a woman fornicary yt is to say of vnclenlyuyng. Of ye which.ii. things:
one had been theft ye other fylthy lechery / except ye auctorite of god ye so
commanded: had excused both ye deeds / wherefore if we read of any like deed
done by any holy persons: holy scipture not showing ye god so commanded:
other we must grant and believe yt (as frail men) they did offend therein or
else (as holy prophets) they had some priuey counsel and reuelacion of god
thereunto. And thereof yet one example: that now comes to mind: Iudi. 16.
shall I put and show of Samson. That oppressynge him self among his
enemies: did so kill or slay himself / which deed (if we should defend and
hold not to be deedly sin) we must undoubtedly believe and trust: that he had
private counsel and reuelacion of god thereunto / although scripture shows
nothing thereof. The third membre of this said subdiuision of necessary
Now for the third necessary / which I caled / inco^mutable or
unchangeable / what suppose you: I do mean thereby? Surely nothing more
congruent and convenient: than necessary or necessite that we know for
surete: is (by the divine and eterne reason of god) so firmed and stablisshed:
that for no cause may in any thing be immuted or changed / no I say not by god
hi^ self under this kind and manner of necessary or necessite: is contained
all that spiritual tradicion and ordinance: of the holy sermon that our
lord and savior made in the mount. And also what thing so ever apperteyne /
unto love / humilite / mansuetude / myldenes / with such other virtues /
ordened / and commanded / as well in the new as in the old testament /
spiritually to be observed and kept. These necessaries (for a surete) ben
such: that not to be had or any time to be myssed and left: is another lawful
ne yet expedient. For sith they be unmouable or unchangeable because they be
naturally good / never been they but innocently and harmeles / never been they:
but helthfully or holsumly and meritoriously other commanded or observed. For
in all times and unto all persons: if they be despised and set at naught they
work and cause death and dampnacion. And if they be observed and kept: Of the
first membre again.
they work and cause soul health and salvation. Proper will (than) in
promysyng: causes unto every person the first necessite. The auctorite of the
co^maunder does cause the second. And the third: does the dignite of the
precepte or comau^dement make or cause. And yet these three necessites (as now
is said before) done diffre each from other in some certain degrees / and so
does not one firmite or stablenes of immutabilite or vnchaungeablenes follow
them all / they ben not all of one stabilite as unto the chaungyng of them. For
what so euerthyng is caused of the first necessite: although it be not utterly
immutable and unchangeable: yet it is (for a surete) uneath or scant
chaungeable / because it may not be changed: but by the prelates alone / and
by none other persons. And yet not by them: but by feythful / provident and
discrete dispensacions. And that thing that is caused of the second necessite
which is more than this: is nerehande or / amoste now inco^mutable or
unchangeable. For (as we have said before) it is unto god alone and not unto
any other person: chaungeable. But that thing that is caused of the third and
last necessite which is most of all the other: is utterly in co^mutable and
by no means can be changed. For it is not i^ the liberte and power of god him
self: to change it. That thing (than) that no person may lawfully change:
but only the prelates: may conveniently be caled uneath or scant chau^geable.
And that thing yt unto god alone is lawful to change: may well be named
almost or nerehande unchangeable. But that thing yt god him self may not
change: may be caled utterly unchangeable. Sith than these foresaid things
done come thus to pass (that we now may return unto these things whereof
question is chefly and principally made in your demand) it is now open and
plain: that every reguler tradicion and ordinance (for the great part
thereof) is subdued although not unto the will: yet for a certeynte unto the
discrecion of the presedent / prelate / or souereyne. But now you say here
unto / what thing sir is now left unto necessite? Here me good brethren / and
say: very much is left unto necessite. First as unto the spiritual things
that been contained in the rule: ben not (as before is said) left in the hand
or power of the abbotte or souereyne. Than for the other part: that does
apperteyne unto corporal and bodily obseruau^ces: that part also is not in the
power of the souereyne as seruyng unto his will or pleasure / but rather as it
does serve and apperteyne unto charity. For the abbotte or souereyne: is not
above the rule. Whereunto (by voluntary profession) he ones did subdue and
submit him self. And yet is the rule of god / charity (no man can deney) to
be preferred by good right and put before the rule of saint Benediete / let it
therefore be so in case / that sometime the letter of the rule do (for that time)
give place unto charity whane the reason of necessite or of charity does so
require: god forbid (natwithstandyng) yt the rule therefore should be subdued
unto the will of any person. For the person that is elect and chosen for
souereyne: is co^stitute and ordened upon the transgressions and defaultes of
the subjects / and not upon ye traditions and ordinances of the fathers and
patrones of the reules / which said souereyne is so ordened as a nuryssher and
keeper of the commandments of the rule and a punissher or correctour of the
vices and transgressio^s of the subjects. For the holy obseruau^ces of ye
reule ben (as I suppose) committed and by taken unto the prudence and provision
and unto ye feyth / trust / and fidelite of the souereynes. And not subdued
unto their will and pleasure. And therefore the self father / ye first made
the rule: in all those things that been left and committed unto the
dispensacion of the abbote or souereine does speak warely and discretly. For
(as I can remember) he never commits any dispensacions unto the will / but
rather unto the consideracion / or unto the disposicion / or unto the
providence and provision / or else unto the arbitreme^t and judgment of the
souereyne or else using some ather like terms / but never that term will.
Thereby meaning and wyllyng as a provident wise and feythfull servant: where in
case he does dispense: to follow the judgment of reason and not the pleasure of
his own will. And therefore ye rule: not ones: but diverse times: does monisshe
and warn the souereyne / yt of all his iugementes: he shall render and yield
account and rekning unto god. Thus for a surete do. I read in ye rule. Let this
co^sideracion aperteine unto the abbotte or souereyne / let this thing or that
be in the providence and provision / or in ye arbitreme^t and judgment / or else
in the disposicion of the abotte or souereyne. But that the abbotte or
souereine (at his will or pleasure: may change any thing: I have not (unto my
remembrance) red. But rather / let all persons in all things (says ye rule)
follow ye rule as maystres and ruler of al. So that no persons boldly fondly /
or unwisely: swarne therfrom in any thing Ergo nor yet the self abbotte or
souereyne / let all (says the text) follow the rule as maystres / ergo ^^ne
may follow self proper will / whereby (I suppose) the self abbote or
souereyne is not excepted. Thus you now may se and perceive: that how much
so ever is granted unto necessite: as much again is withdrawn from proper
will and self pleasure. What than? Does not the self reguler profession /
whereby the inferior and younger does wylfully subdue him self unto the
supperior and elder: bind equaly and in like manner: the supperior and elder?
it does surely. For certeynly (I do suppose) yt both been bound by the
necessite of common and like co^nau^t and promise. And that both and either
ben made detters unto other by the promise of the the one / that is to say: the
souereyne bound unto feythfull cure and charge and the subject unto humble
and lowly ob^die^ce what is now left unto proper will / where the prelate as
well as the subject: is bound in the necessite of debt and duete? The will
also of the prelate is not lyttel prescribed / restreyned / determined / and
appointed / in this thing also / that is: that the person yt makes
profession: although he promise obedience: ye^ does he not promise al manner
obedience: but determinately after or according unto the rule / and yet not
every rule ne any other rule tha^ one alone / as of saint Benedicte / saint
Augustyne / or such other. So yt it byhoueth and is necessary: for hi^ that is
prelate or souereyne: not to use his will and pleasure upon his subjects: but
to know the measure prefixed and appointed unto him of the rule or by the rule
/ and so than to moderate his commandments about that thing alone: that he
knows / for surete is right / and yet not every right / but that right alone
that the patro^ and father of the rule has instituted and ordened / or (at
the leest) that such right be after and according unto the thing that the
said father did ordeine. For surely the manner and form of profession is thus.
I promitte or promise: not the self rule (I say) but obedience after or
according unto the rule of saint Benet or saint Augustyne / and not after or
according unto the will or pleasure of the prelate or souereyne. Wherefore if I
make profession after or according unto this rule or that / and mine abbot or
souereyne than peradventure: A good note for the prelates.
would tempte or assaye to charge me with another thing that is not after or
according unto my rule / or that is not after or according unto my statutes /
as by examples / the statutes of saint Basile / saint Augustyne / or saint
Pacomie: what need (I pray you) does compel me in that thing to be
obedient? surely none at all. For that thing only (I suppose) may be required
of me: that I have promised. Ergo now you may se and perceive the meeres
marks / and measures of obedience which you require. Sith than the tenoure
and form of the profession: is the manner and due mean of obedience: and sith
also the power of the souereyne that commands does not extend nor stretche
but only so far as the vow of the person professed does attain and reche:
I may right well call these terms / less or more / under or above on this
half: or beyond / or yet this term / or contrary: the very limittes / the
meeres terms / marks / and steynts of obedience. For within this said terms
and meeres: is the virtue and effect of obedience enclosed / contained / and
compassed / wherefore no manner of person professed in any lawful order or
religion: may be co^streyned unto any thing above that law of obedience that
his profession seems to conteyne ne yet inhibited / forb^den / or let / to
do any thing under the same law / much more than may he not so be
constrained nor let: contrary unto that law / that form than and manner
of obedience that is the myddell mean and form of lyuing^ between the said
meeres and terms: which is prefixed and appointed by vow and stablysshed by
profession as the tree was stablysshed that was in the myddell of paradyse:
should (douteles) be only subject and subdued unto the said law of obedience
/ and bound by that obedience: unto the commandment of the souereyne. Let
therefore the commandment of the prelate or his prohibicion: never pass ye
terms and meeres or marks and tenor of the profession. For that iussion or
commandment of the souereyne: may another be extended ne streched above or
beyond the said terms / nor yet be constreyned or streyted byneth or under
them. For my prelate or souereyne should prohibit or forbede me none of those
things that I promised in my profession nor yet require of me any more than I
promised. For he should another enlarge or each my vows nor multiply my
promise without my will / nor yet minisshe or make the^ less / without
certain and sure necessite. For necessite: has no law. And therefore it
does excuse dispensacion. But because that will alone does deserve reward:
will (not unworthily) also alone: does oftymes use a more high degree of
perfection / which is to mean thus. Because that the will in every person
does cause the meritte of the deed: a person may of good will do more than
duete and lo inforse and clymbe unto a more high degree of perfection. And else
/ the remission of the vow without necessite is another dispensacion but rather
preuaricacion: nor yet is the restreynt contrary unto the will / any profecte:
but rather murmr and grudge / let the prelates therefore: put the mere or
myddell mean and measure of ye obedience of their subjects: according unto ye
vow made with their own lips. And not according unto their wylles and
desires that is to say: the pleasures of the self prelates / mouyng and
sterynge their subjects and not constreynyng them unto things of more high
perfection. Condescendyng with them when necessite requires or need is / unto
things of more remission / or more low perfection / and yet not falling down
with them unto the same them self. Another good note for the subjects.
But yet natwithstandyng all that is said: let every subject know / that all
such obedience as is cohibitte and contained within the said meeres / terms /
and marks: is not a perfect obedience. For perfect obedience knows no law
/ nor is arted / constreyned / ne bound / wtin any terms / meeres / or
marks. For perfect obedience is not co^te^t to keep ye streytnes and presyse
form of profession: but rather does desire and enforce (by a more large
liberte of will) to approach and climb unto a more large bredthe of charity.
And ever wyllyng and ready unto all things that been enjoined and commanded /
nothing co^sideryng ye mean manner and terms byforesayd: does by the might and
strength of a liberal / fre / and courageous heart or mind: exte^de apply /
and streche forth it self unto infinite and most large liberte of will. This
is that obedience whereof faint Peter the Apostle so notably spoke. 1. Pe. 1. D.
Saying unto his disciples. Chastesynge and keeping down your hertes in the
obedience of charity: each love other / by which words he puttethe a goodly
difference between the obedience of charity and the other dull and servile
obedience which is not always quycke and ready unto charity / but rather subdued
and bound unto necessite. This obedie^c^ also does properly apperteyne unto
that just person (after saint Paul) unto whom or for whom no law is
ordained not so to be understand that any person may live without law / but
that he is not under the law / nor content with the vow of any profession: 1.
Thy. 1.
but rather to ouerpasse that streytnes of necessite by herty devotion and
liberallite of mind which said obedience of perfection: the self rule of
saint Benedicte does not forgette / but speakethe plainly thereof in that
chapitre. Ca. si frat aliquid impossible.
Where monicion and warning is given that if unto any brother or person
professed any things impossible be enjoined or commanded: he should (having
confidence and trust in the help or of the help of god) be obedient for
charity. And in ye same rule also: the third degree of humilite or mekenes: Ca.
de gradibus humilitatis.
discribed and declared to be: when a religious person is subdued unto the
souereyne in all manner or every obedience. And speaking that term in all manner
or in every: the reule wyllethe that in obeynge our souereyne: we should not
be content with the same measure or meeres of our profession / not to attend
and precisely to consider the duete and bond of our promise: not to take the
form and manner of our obedience: of our pacte and promise of profession. But
cherefully and gladly to ouerpasse our vow / and to forget the form of
promise / and to be obedidiente in all things. Many will be well ware they pas
not the bond and duete of their promise.
There is a certain mark or mere of obedience after ye time or according unto
the time: and so the same is the mere and term of obedience that is the term
of life / which term the example of our savior does specially commend unto
us. For he was made obedient unto his father unto death. Philip. 2.
As often than as this obedience or this term and mere of obedience is broken:
so often is it caled inobedience or disobedience / and sin and transgression
or preuaricacion yet surely there is a difference / for what cause / or by what
effection / by what intent and purpose / by whose precepte or commandment /
or by what manner of commandment: this yuel sin of inobedie^ce be committed
or done. And surely I say that no manner of inobedience or disobedience is
utterly to be despised or little set by / natwithsta^dyng that every
disobedience is not to be esteemed / weyed / and considered of like peril and
ieoparty / example. For this is a commandment of god. Non occides. Thou shall
not slay or kill any person. yet make here in case two homicides two
mansleers. The the one has slain a man by covetous mind to rob him of his
goods / but ye the other has done the same unhappy deed: for necessite in
defendyng of him self. Does not here the cause very evidently depart and put
difference between the the one lepre and the the other lepre / that is: between
these two offenses / making the sins and trespass of this one and self same
transgression: much unlike? it does in deed. And in like wise / if sodeyn ire
or wrath had caused the the one to do this mischefe: and studious malice or old
wrath had caused the the other. Should that thing than that is proved to be done
with so unlike affecte and desire: be weyde considered and iuged by like
judgment? nay verily. Forthermore^ no manner of incest or fylthie pollusio^
nothing could be more obstene and shameful: than yt the daughters of Loath
should so abuse their own father: and yet every man may perceive / that the
pity and religion of their intent and the intent of their devout mind: did
much euacuate / or at the leest did mynisshe and make less the default and
gylt of that fylthy and cursed deed. In like manner now of the souereyne that
does command and of the matter that is commanded a like distinction and
difference may be considered according unto reason. So that the more auctorite
the person be of that does command: so much the more should the subjects
fere and dread the offense of inobedience. For the transgression and breaking
of the commandment of the more auctorite must be esteemed and supposed more
dampnable. For it is better to be obedient to god: than unto man / and better
to be obedient unto the masters and souereynes: than unto the disciples / and
yet among ye masters and souereynes / as it is better to be obediente unto our
own souereynes than unto strangers and as we know and be i^ surete unto
whom is best to be obedient: so not to be obedient is most detestable /
hateful and despleasaunt. And in like manner is it of the self commandment
and of the thing that is commanded. For unto the more and greater
commandments: more cure and greater diligence: And unto the less: less
care and head is to be given. And according unto the same consideracion: in
contempt and despising of them: more or less offense is done. And to show
which commandment is more and which less. I say that hangs upon the will
and mind of the co^maunder and as man may be in surete to know or suppose:
which he more or less wylleth and desires that does command / whether it
be god or man. As by example it is a commandment of the gospel that thou
shall not stele / that no man should do theft And a another commandment also
of the gospel is this. Marci. 10.
Luce. 6.
Give unto every / need / person that askethe of the / both these
commandments been great. For they ben both divine / that is the
commandments of god. But yet is the commandment of not stelyng / of no
theft to be done: the greater commandment. Every man may know well that
nygardes done not so much displease god: as done thieves or robbers. And that
also of the two yueles: god has lever we kept our own goods unto our self:
than that we we should take away other folks goods. And so may every man
know: that he does less sin yt will not give away his own goods: than
does he that does rob or stele that is not his. But in the commandments
of men: is seldom found equalite / because yt (according unto the variaunt
necessites or profyttes of those things that should be done) the affection of
the souereynes or commau^ders: is varied and does change. And that thing that
they done think suppose and judge to be most right and most commodious and
most profyttable: that done they most couete and require more principally and
before other things: to be observed kept and performed. As well therefore: ye
qualite / condition / and manner of precepts or commandments as the
auctorite of the souereynes or co^maunders: done both prefixe appoint and
determyn ye mere term and measure of obedience / and also the offense and
default of inobedience or disobedience. Sith (as is said before) in all prelates
of great auctorite / and in all their commandments of very great profytte:
ye subject is more streytly bound with all diligence to be the more obedient:
So much more is the contempt and despisyng of these commandments: greater
and more grievous offense sin and trespass. These distinctions thus well
noted and marked: both the manner and form of obedience: and also ye weight
and ieoparty of inobedie^ce: may lightly be found and perceived. By these
degrees: we may descerne judge and put difference not only between the day and
the night / that is to say: between the good and profit obedience / and the
yuell and hurt of in obedience: but also may we discern between the day and
the day / and likewise also between the night and the night / that is to mean
between good and better / and also between yuel and worse / it is (according
unto the sentence and mind of our master and patron) a good degree of
obedience: when the subject is obedient for fere or dread of the fire of hell
/ and of everlasting dampnacion / or yet because of ye bond of holy profession
which he has professed. But yet is that degree better: wha^ the subject is
obedient for the love of god. For the first obedience is of necessite / and
the second of charity. The best obedience.
But that do I call the best degree of obedience: when ye work or thing enjoined
or commanded by the souereyne: is of the subject received with such heart
and mind as it was commanded. For when the intent of ye subject in the
execucion of the souereynes precepte: does hang upon the will of the prelate:
it comes to pass that the study and diligence of the subject / to
acco^plysshe and fulfill that thing that is enjoined or commanded: is another
more unto less things nor yet less unto the more things confusely and
indiscreetly as oftymes happeth and is wont to fall. But when ye heart / mind
/ and good will does moderate and measure all manner of imperies and
commandments according unto their dignite and degree: ye subject shall know
every where how to keep a due mean and measure / that is to say: as well in
obseruyng and keeping those things that been commanded: as in auoydyng and
escheuyng of those things that been prohibit and forboden / not so that the
subject shall think or suppose the leest thing that is commanded / to be
set at a little or to be despised / although he may well repute and wey ye
thing leest that in deed is leest. But that thing leest: is caled in comparison
unto the greater things. The verey meke and obediente subject: knowethe well
how he should in no wise despise the leest / and yet how most chefly to cure
the most. For such a subject will (by a certain inward savor and spiritual
fealyng of the devout and feythfull mind) discern and judge how in the
commandments of his souereyne: he may (in a manner) answer him (by his
deeds) as the prophet did our lord sayng. Tu ma^dasti mandata tua custodiri
nimis. Thou have (good lord) commanded thy commandments to be streytly
kept. In which sayng (because he said not universally all thy commandments)
we must nedely understand those commandments / that because they be not
(by any occasion) without great and grievous offense violate or defouled: been
not therefore (when they be defouled) without great and grievous pain perdoned
and forgyuen / as by the example of this commandment. Non occides.. Thou
shall not slay or kill / and such other / ye keeping and perfourmyng whereof:
may never be unjust nor yuel: nor the transgression and breakyng: Note here
that man alone may never dispens with the law of god that is to say except
reuelacion or by the holy ghost.
may ever be good nor lawful: by any dispensacion only of man. Other
commandments of man that of the souereynes may receive dispensacions:
because that wha^ they ben broken: they may be punisshed by more light censure
and judgment: ben therefore caled more light commandments / as by examble of
light lagghyng interdicted and forboden. And of silence indicted / enjoined /
enjoined / and commanded. For these (if they come not forth contrary unto
commandment) ben no sin at all / but if commandment be given upon them:
than (if they be not kept) they ben reputed and accounted as sin or to be
sin. So yet: that the transgression and breaking of them fortune and hap to
be by surrepcion vnwarnes or forgetfulness / and not by contempt or despysyng.
Tere ben other mean commandments / of the which those precepts ben
constitute and ordened which you call facticious / that is to say: assimuled /
feyned / or made like unto the other precepts which (for a surete) in as
much as bylongeth unto them: done conteyne a far different necessite from
the natural precepts. And yet natwithstandynge may they not (without some
offense) be neglected or little regarded / nor yet without criminal sin and
grievous offense may they be contempned and despised specially wha^ they be
enjoined by the^ that have power / unto whom properly is said by our savior
in the gospel. Qui uos audit: me audit, et qui uos spernit: me spernit. Who so
ever does obey you: Lu. 10. C.
does obey me. And who so despises you: despyseth me. For although ye self
qualite and condition of ye work enjoined and commanded: might of it self or
by it self be without bo^de or offense: yet (natwtsta^dyng) yt weght and grauite
of the souereynes auctorite: does make ye subject bound unto the
commandment. And ye commandment ones broken does make him bound unto ye
offense / but not unto great offense: if there be no contempt / let this
therefore be rule general of all those things / that by the^ self / of the^
self / or for the^ self / ben another good nor bad. And of all those things
also / that been not fixed and stablysshed other by the institucion and
ordinance of god or else by ye proper profession of any person: that in all
such: if they be not commanded: either part may lawfully other be admitted
performed and done / or else omitted and undone or left. But when they be
commanded: they may never without sin be neglected or little regarded / ne
ever be conte^pned and despised without crime and offense openly to be punisshed.
For negligence every where is culpable / and conte^pte: damnable or
conde^pnable. For these tweyne ben much different / because ye neglige^cie is
langour or disease of dulnes or ydlenes or of an ignorant or forgetful mind.
What is negligence.
But contempt is swellyng of pride. Contempt therefore / in every kind and
manner of commandments is ever in like weght and burden grievous. And
co^munely damnable or condemnable. But negligencie i^ those commandments yt
ben fixed and stablysshed: is very grievous / and i^ those that been mouable and
not stablysshed: more tolerable or sufferable. Example adultrie: caled auowtrie
/ by what so ever mean or manner / or by what so ever mi^de or purpose it be
done: is ever filthy flagicious and criminal sin. But a light word in time
or place of silence: spoken by chance of forgetfulness or ouersyght / or a
laghter breakyng out suddenly of a vehement passion rather than of presumpcion
contrary the precepts or statutes: which natwitstandyng is a sign and token
of a negligent mind or of a dissolute spirit / these may therefore deserve
more lightly forgyuenes: because they been reputed and accounted scant for any
sin. But what if the tongue (knows / and of deliberacion) be relaxed and put
at liberte to speak vain and idle words although there were no silence
commanded at all? no man will deney but that thing natwithstanding is usurped
contrary unto the rule of truth that is our lord Jesus. For (without any
doubt) accounte and rekenyng shall be required thereof in the last judgment. So
our savior said him self ferefully thretynge. Of every idle word (says he)
me^ shall render reason and yield accou^te in the day of judgment. Alas woe may
be unto us to think what manner of account may be rendered and made of ydlenes.
And yet is there none ydlenes: if it be not utterly void of reason or lawfully
cause. And yet every person may well know that one word of detractio^ and
bakbytyng does more depely wey unto sin and dampnacion tha^ done innumerable
words of ydlenes / how so? For there is discrecion and difference in the
precepts or commandments / and likewise in the defaultes of offenses /
because (as I said before) the transgression of the more commandments: is
more grievous / and of less: is less offenses. But on the party of the /
commandments / that is to the^ that done give ye commandments: is none
such difference. For whether god or the souereyne that is the vycare of god /
do give any manner of commandment: all is one / and by like cure and diligence
to be obeyde / and by like reverence to be performed / where natwithsta^ding
the souereyne does nothing command contrary unto god / which thing if
should fortune: I would co^sayle the subject without any doubt to ren to leyne
unto the sentence of saint Petre / sayng that it byhoueth and is necessary
rather to obey god than man. For other must the subject so answer with the
Apostles: or else must he (unto his rebuke) here ye was said to our savior unto
the Pharisees. Why done you tra^sgresse and break the commandment of god for
your own tradicions and ordinances. And if the souereyne that is but a man:
be grieved or discontent / to be despised and contraried of his subject rather
than he should be despised that teaches man al manner of science lernyng and
conyng which is god him self: let that sentence of Samuel confort him which
Samuel you also did allege: whereby he seemed to discern and judge between lepre
and lepre yt is to mean bytwyxte one sin and a another sayng thus. Si
peccauerit vir in virum. etc. If one man do offend or trespass against a
another: yet god may be merciful unto him. But and he offend and trespass
unto god: who shall than pray for him? And therefore if I perceived and felt my
self constrained in this article or case / that I should nedely other offend
god or else man: I would gladly chose rather not to offend god / and that
surely were more sure and most just or right. For I have good conforte by
this present text of the prophet for the offense or hurt done or yt I have
done unto man: yt is to say: the mercy and forgyuenes of our lord god. But if
I wylfully offend god: who shall pray and be mean for me? none. For if I
should fle and have recourse unto man only therefore that thing scripture will
not counsel me / but rather says. Hiere. 17.
Cursed be yt person that puts his full hope and trust in man / it is good
right tha^ it so be. For if a person offe^de god / and though yt were
understand yt he so did / rather tha^ he would offend and displease man: who
should yet (says the text) pray for him? surely another of them both may pray
for him. For the prayer of him that did the offense to god and the prayer of
him also for whose sake or for whom he so did: ben both i^ like manner unto
almighty god execrable / abominable and to be abhorred. Therefore such a
person must be soght and found that may be convenient to appease ye person
offended. For if any default be in that the souereyne as man is offended /
because that in that case he is not obeyde: surely ye better and more
reasonable cause: does much extenuate minisshe and rebate / or rather adnull
and destroy that offense / wherefore (when the scripture says. Si peccauerit
uir in uirum. etc) That is: if man do offend again man / we must understand
/ for gods cause. For the offense of any of our neghburs not only of our
prelate: can never be excused but only in the cause of god. And else should we
be co^trarious unto saint Paul where he says. When you offend and trespase
again your brother / that is to say any christian: 1. Cor. 8.
than done you offend and trespase again Christ. For as unto our prelates:
we have a sure hold of the testimony and wytnes of ye self truth our
savior Christ. Saying thus unto his disciples. Qui uos spernit: me spernit.
Who so ever does despise you: Luce. 10. Matthew. 18.
despises me / and in a another place he says of every christian. Brother /
have not you: will / appetyte / or desire / to despise any one of the leest of
these puselles and innocent persons / and in a another place. Matt. 18 A.
Who so does slander / and give occasion or yuel example unto any of these
puselles and innocent christianes / our lord save us from ye follows / how
be it yet / the occasions and yuell examples of all manner of persons: There
follows it were expedient that a mylstone were hanged in his neck and he
drowned so i^ the deep see. Matthew. 16.
should not be weyde in like balance. For otherwise should be occasions of
puselles and innocent persons be taken / and otherwise of the Pharisees / of
whom our savior said unto his Apostles when they said and were affrayde lest
the said Pharisees were slaundered and should take occasion at the words of
troth sayng. Suffer them (said he) take patience with them. For they ben
blind / and the leders or ledes men of the blind. For the slander or
occasion of the innocents: does descend and come of ignorance and lack of
knowelege / but the slander of the pharisees comes of very malice. For the
innocences ben slau^dered and offended: because they can no better / and the
pharisees: because of their hatred and malicious mind. Wherefore I suppose these
simple persons ben caled puselles: because they have a good mind and good
will / but they have no great co^nyng nor lernyng. They have a zele of god /
but not according unto science right co^ning and lerning. Galla. 6.
The slau^ders of such persons or their occasions: done provoke all persons
to (...) cure / help / and conforte them / and not unto ire / anger / and
displeasure with them / and specially spiritual persons according unto the
lesson and precept of saint Paul, you (says he) that been spiritual persons:
must instruct and teach such manner of simple persons in the spirit of
leuite / myldnes / sweet and soft manner / gentell / and sober byhauiour. For
it is verey much again justice and right / yt such simple persons should
deserve the indignacion of man that so lightly done obtain the pity /
compassion and mercy of our lord. For those persons that crucified our lord
and Savior Jesus: were in that deed great sinners and did much offend but in
their estimacion and byleuing: they were pusylles and simple persons. And so
although on ye the one part they deserves ye wrath and displeasure of god: yet
on the other part: they deserved forgeuenes of their sin. They had (surely)
ben happy and blessed: if (according unto the words of our lord) they had
not ben slaundred nor taken occasion of him or in him. But sith they so did:
what were they else therein: but miserable wretches? and yet not withstandyng:
were they to be peti^ and received unto mercy and grace / which thing: that
pitious and most merciful supplicacion: that our savior suffcyng and hangyng
in the cross / and yet natwtstandyng having compassion upon them: did there
make for them: does well approve. Father (said he) I byseche ye forgive them /
and as though he would in manner excuse their default / and (into notable an
yuell and horrible deed) show the reason why they should have forgyuenes there
folowethe forthwith because they wot not what they done / as though he said.
In that been they worthy forgyuenes: because they ben puselles and simple in
lernyng and knowledge. Therefore do I forgive them: because I am not known of
them. For if they had known what they did: 1. Cor. 2.
they would never have crucified the lord of the glory. There ben other
persons whom I do not so lyghtely forgive. Io. 13. D.
For I know well they saw and perceived me and yet did they hate both me and
my father. For such puselles and simple persons in lernyng: saint Paul spoke
feerfully and roughly unto them that had lerning / and yet would not
condescende and comfort their inferiors sayng. 1. Cor. ^.
That brother for whom Christ suffered death shall perisshe and be lost in thy
co^nyng or lernyng / if than the slander and occasion of small and simple
persons is so much to be avoided: Surely much more should the slander and
occasion of the prelates and souereynes be avoided whom our lord god: in
manner making equal with him self i^ both parts: did impute and apply unto
him self: the reverence and also the contempt or despisyng done unto them.
Sayng by open contestacion and witness of the gospel. Qui uos audit: me audit.
etc. Lu. 10. C.
Who so hears and does obey you: does here me and is obedient unto me. And
who so despises you: Ca. de obediencia.
does also despise me / which sayng in sentence is also contained in our rule
thus. That obedience that is exhibit and done unto the souereynes: is exhibit
and done to god / wherefore what so ever ye souereyne man does command in the
person of god (So natwithstandyng we be in certeynte it does not displease
god) should be resceyued not otherwise in all manner: tha^ if god him self had
so commanded. For there is no difference wether god make open and show his
pleasure unto man by him self or by his ministres and servants whether they
ben men or Angels. But here you say peradventure: that (in things doutfull)
the souereynes may lightly be deceived in the very knowledge and perceyuyng of
the will and pleasure of god. And so may they deceive their subjects in
co^maundyng the same as of the will of god / whereunto I answer and say / that
nothing does ye deceyt of the souereyne apperteyne or bylonge unto the
subject. Because he knows not wether he be deceived or not. But rather
should every subject suppose the best / sith he has good auctorite of
scripture. Quia labia sacerdotis custodiunt scientiam. That is: the lips and
mouth of ye priest: done kept and conteyne / science / knowledge / and lernyng.
^^ala. 2.
And of his mouth done the people require the law. For he is the Angel and
messenger of our lord. The people I said must require the law. But what
law? not that law that is set forth and commanded by ye auctorite of any
scripture nor yet that manifest and open reason may prove. For of all such
laws we need no master to teach us what we should do / ne yet to prohibit
ne forbede us that we should not do. But when a matter is obscure and hard to
understand / and than we doubt whether god would so or otherwise: than must
we require the law of the lyps that done keep lernyng / and have the certeynte
rendered and showed by the mouth of the Angel of god: that is the prelate or
souereyne. For divine counsel: most surely may be required of hi^ that has
the dispensacion and charge of the mysteries and secrets of god / we should
therefore (in all things that been not evidently contrary unto god) be
obediente unto him that we have in the stead of god as we would be obedient
unto god. And yet surely do not I therein speak contrary unto the holy
prophet Samuel as though I would give the auctorite of god unto man. 1. Reg.
2.
Sith he in the foresaid chapitre: does plainly put difference between both
those auctorites. For that thing that I do affirm and say of doutfull
things: that thing does he deney of things open as when he says. If one man
trespass or offend again a another man / wherein we must understand for god:
rather than he would offend god. For men (many times) done presume to command
other men their subjects: things that been contrary unto god. But you hereof
taking a ground and occasion of argument: done make this reason. If this be
truth / that we must esteem / powder / and wey / or judge all the
commandments / institutes / and ordinances of our soue-uereynes: as the
commandments of god and in like weight of auctorite: it must need than
follow that few men or none (under the obedience of man) may scante or rather
by no manner of mean may be saved. For among so many a great multitude of
commandments: as the prelates done give / and that often times by negligence
and with out deliberacion: it is very hard or else utterly impossible for any
subject / never nor at any time to offend or trespass. And surely I do it
not deney / but that unto so great a perfection to be fulfilled is so great a
difficulty / and hardynes required how be it that is great difficulty: whane
the matter is interprised and presumed: with a heart and mind imperfect. For
(of a surete) these ben the signs and tokens of an imperfect heart and of a
feeble and very feynt will / that is to say: when the subject will discuss /
try out / and reason the statutes and ordinances of the seniores and old
fathers. And to stop and stycke or doubt at every precepte and commandment
/ and to ask why / wherefore / for what cause / and by what reason he should so
do. And suspecte yuel of any precepte where the cause is unknown. And never to
be gladly obedient: but if peradventure the precepte do please and content the
pertie / or else when euedient and open reason or undoubted auctorite does show
unto them / that other it may not lawfully / or else is not expedient to be
otherwise Such manner of obedience: is very delicate and tender / or rather a
molest / grievous / or combrouse obedience. This obedience: is not that
obedience tha^es taght and commanded in saint Benettes rule / caled / there
obedience without tareyng / stopage / or let / when the matter is desputed and
reasoned: there is rather the wyly and crafty obedience of an high mind and
proud heart: than the obedience / of the prophet: Psalm. 17.
In auditu auris: At the first hearing / it is therefore necessary that such
a carnal mind: be not only grieved and let: but also opressed and holden
under: As the perfection of religious obedience.
with the weght of some good perfection interprised and taken in hand before
by promise For the infirm and feeble flesh / can not beer that sweet yocke
and light or pleasant burden: which the spirit alone: prompt and ready unto
all obedience does daily put in experience. For the yocke of Christ is both a
heavy burden / and also importable or vnberable: unto al the^ that have not the
spirit of Christ. Heresome of you peradventure will say. If this be true: the
law of our rule is given unto us: that our sin and offense should abou^de
and increase thereby / because it is occasion of our more grievous offense.
Surely you say truth. But yet is not the rule therefore in default / nor yet
the makers of the rule. But the default is in them that without providence and
due proof of them self unwisely done profess the rule / and after their
profession: wyckedly done break the same. Romans 7.
For surely (as saint Paul faith) the commandment is holy and just. But
thou should know and perceive thy self to be a carnal person / sold by
custom and subdued unto sin. And that thing: should thou have seen before
thy profession. So that thou should not have bygo^ne and leyde the fou^dacion
of this euaungelike toure: before that thou sittynge and by good deliberacion
considering all things: had accounted with thy self / whether thou had /
expense and sufficient abilites to perform the same. But now there is no
remedy / but other that thou: corrected and reformed: by obebedient unto thy
souereyne and seniores: or else confounded / and mocked: thou here (unto thy
shame and rebuke) the words of the gospel. Lu. 14. F.
This person byganne (like a fool) to bylde: and was not of power to perform
ne make end thereof. But peradventure here you will say unto me. Sir done you
suppose or think / that any subject may be found and proved so perfect:
that among so many and so small commandments as by the souereynes (some time
negligent and forgetful) ben given: will never ouerpasse ne offend in any of
them? Nay surely / but I grant well that no subject is so perfect.
Specially: sith the holy Apostles said of themself. In multis offendimuis
omnes. Et si dixerimus quia peccatum non habemus: Iaco. 3. 1. Io. 2.
ipsi nu^ seducimus. We done (say they) offend in many things. And if we say
that we ben without sin: we done deceive ourselfe. But yet I say / that if
we ouerpasse and break any such commandment: we do not forthwith perysshe
and stand in the state of dampnacion therefore specially whyl holy scripture
does conforte us therein. 1. Io. 2. A.
Sayng if any of us trespass and do amysse: we have an advocate / our savior
Jesus Christ that is just and true / and he is the mean of forgyuenes for all
our sines. Of whom ye prophet Esai witnesses sayng that he did pr^ye for
tra^sgressours and sinners / that they should not perysshe and be dampened.
Esai. 53.
Note well that co^te^pt is grievous and perilous.
Where is much to be noted: that although he prayde for transgressors and
trespassers: yet is it not red / that ever he made supplicacion for contempners
and despisers. But surely they may never perisshe / ne be dampened / for whom
our Savior Jesus prays that they should not perisshe / wherefore I can not se
ne perceive: why you should suppose and think every inobedience and
transgression / of every commandment though never so small: so to be
exaggerate / heped / and iuged so great sin. that you should have cause so to
fere and so to cry out sayng. What sin unto any religious person / may now
be venial or light: sithe the sin of inobedience is so ieopardous and so
hard to escape in every manner of act or deed we do? But you suppose and believe
that the cause thereof is / because that I said before / that as much auctorite
and obedience should be had and given unto the commandments of the prelates:
as though they were commanded of god. And that thing you say: because you
perceive not that the self precepts of the gospel: done much diffre among
or between the^ self / both in the merit of the obseruacion and keeping. And
in the peril or ieoparty of the transgression / and breaking of the^. But as
we know for a surete / that al commandments ben not of one necessite / or
of one vtilite / nor of like dignite to be kept: so we may know / that the
same or like sentence or judgment: shall not be given for the transgression of
the^ all / nor yet shall disparent and unlike offenses: have like peynes ne
punisshementes. For the negligence of those things is not of like defaulte or
offense: that been not commanded by like cure and charge and therefore the pain
or punisshement is not like. For (if you look well) the self gospel does
dampne or condampne as well the great offense of surfette / as the turpitude
and fylthynes of fornicacon. But yet every manner of person would more abhor
and loathe of those two yuelles: to be defouleth with fornicacion: than to be
ouersene with surfette. Matthew. 7. Luce. 6.
The essenciall truth therefore that is our savior Christ / in the gospel
of Matthieu and Luke / under the terms of a beam or a block / and of a
straw or a mote. Does put difference bytwyxte the grievous and the light
defaultes or offenses of inobedience. Matthew. 5.
And also by his disputacion or rather his deffinicion and determinacion i^ the
gospel: plain distinction is made unto us / what pain and punisshement / es
due unto every defaulte or trespass / when and where our savior made made
protestacion and declared / that some person is worthy judgment. Some worthy
counsel / and some other is worthy the fire of hell. Ergo than it follows
not by any constraynt of necessite / that all though the auctorite of god be
granted unto the prelates in their commandments / we should therefore
suppose or believe: that no sin might be found in a religious person light /
or venial / but all deedly / nor yet does so follow that in every act or deed
of a religious person: should be ieoparty and peril of criminal inobedience.
That sin is caled criminal that is worthy open and grievous correction
whether the sin be deedly or venial.
Let in case that sin be criminal and deedly / whereunto the pain of ye fire
of hell is appointed / yet may not we deffine and determine that sin to be
criminal: that (by the judgment of our savior) makes a person gylte / only
of judgment. And yet will not I deney: but that is a gylte or offense: that
makes a person so far gulty / and if it be a gylt or offense: it must need
be sin. And every sin: is contrary unto the commandment of god. And what
so ever is contrary unto ye commandment of god: is caled disobedience. Hereof
now may we gather and conclude: that one brother to be wroth with a another:
is inobedience / and yet is it not criminal sin. Se now that one syn is
here found: that unto a religions person is light and venial sin / which
sin also does make the person a transgressour and breaker not only of the
commandment of man: but of god. In this kind and manner of tra^sgression ben
contained many folysshe or vaynspeaches and what so ever is done / said / or
thought idle and void. For such been never used but contrary unto
commandment / and contracie unto the commandment of god. For surely they
ben sins. And god does prohibit and forbede all sin and yet
natwithstandyng: they ben reputed and accounted as venial and not criminal
sins. Except wha^ by contempt they be turned into use and custom. And yet
than is not the kind and manner of the syn^e to be weyde and regarded: but
rather ye intent and mind of the sinner and trespasser. For (of a surete) the
pride and high mind of the person that does despise the commandment: And
the obstinacy of the impenitent person: done in the leest commandments:
make the sin and offense very great / and done co^uerte and turn the lyttel
were or pusshe / that is to say: a lyttel deformite of simple transgression:
into the crime and notable defaute of grievous rebellion. For a sure conclusion
tha^: take you head / and note well: wherein (without any doubt) the crime of
inobedience rests and remains. 1. Reg. 15.
Where the said prophet Samuel says. Quasi peccatum ario landi est
repugnare, et quasi scelus idololatrie: nolle acquiescere, To repugne (says
he) and to wtstande the co^maundeme^te of god: is equal and like unto the
sin of diuinacion or wychcrafte. And to will / that is to say: to have no
will to leyne and apply thereunto: is as the notable sin of ydolatrie / he
says not here: Note well.
note to leyne / or not to aplie / but to nyll or not to will. So that the
self simple transgression of the cu^maundement: is not reputed and supposed
here to be ye said sin of ydolatrie: but the proud contempt of the will. For
to nyll obey / or not to will to be obedient / and not to obey / or to be
obedient: ben not both one / nor the same thing. For not to obey / or to be
obedient: comes some time of error or ignorance / and sometime: of infirmite
or fraylte. But to nyll / or not to have will to be obediente: comes ever /
other of an odious and hateful pertinacie and frowardnes or else of ye
contumacie and rebellion of a styffe heart and stubburne stomach / that i^ no
wise should be suffered ne bourne / which thing also: is self repugnaunce and
to withstand the holy ghost. And if it should perdure and contine unto death:
it were blasphemye / never to be remitted and forgyuen / another in this world
/ nor i^ the world to come. Luce. 12.
Every / man therefore of breakyng of commandment: does not make inobedience
criminal / but to repugne and with stand. And to nyll or not to will: does
make ever inobedience criminal. For many persons been many times inobedient
without that ungracious and rebellous will / it can not be than as you say /
that inobedience unto every religous person is ever in ieoparty of criminal
sin: Sith i^ the tra^sgression of a religious person / is so oftymes none
such criminal sin: as often as in the same transgression / there be no such
froward contencious and stryuyng will or mind / without cause therefore: done
some persons (as you say) make comparison of some manner of disobedie^ces:
unto that old inobedience that was done in paradyse. For that inobedience was
valiant / and of strenthe and power: not only to bind the persons: but also
to viciate and infecte nature. Natwithstandynge I suppose and think verily /
that also that self first and most grievous preuaricacion / and disobedience
was iuged to be most great and grievous: for none other cause / or (at the
leest) most chefly and most specially so iuged because of ye froward will /
that is to say: that rebellious defense that followed the said inobedience. For
when our lord god asked of the^ the cause of their sin / and why they did
that offense / because he would provoke the^ to be penitent (For he wylled not
their death / but rather that they should have been converted and lived or had
their life) they (by froward will) did chose rather to declyne and turn away
their heart (as the prophet says) unto the words of malice / for to forge
and make excuses in their sins. Psalm. 140.
For the malice of the first sinner Adam: was double / and in two manners.
First that another he had mercy nor pity upon him self to confess his own
sin and so to have been cured and healed thereof: nor yet upon his wife / but
falsely to excuse him self: he cruelly accused her / why than done you say /
that the crime of inobedience does lie in wait upon the religious person in
every act or deed to put him in ieoparty? as though inobedie^ce should stele
privily upon a man / or he were ware / or wist thereof / or as it should fortune
and fall by some unhappy chance / or else as though a deceytfull occasion and
vexacion of that crime: should in a thing impossible: be leyde in his way:
that were not able to fulfill and perform / that thing that is commanded?
How may it be than that the crime of inobedience should so lie in wait and
be so ieopardous unto the religious person? Sithe the old preuaricacion / and
inobedience of Adam / so open / so known / and so noyous: might (as we believe)
sone and lightly have gotten forgyuenes and ben pardoned: if confession / and
not defense with excuse: had followed. For (as I said) the transgression of that
self simple and synguler deed: did not so much noy and hurt: as did the
obstinacy / and styfnes of the excuse adioined thereunto with premeditacion and
forecaste. But peradventure you would say: That this consideracion and
difference of the more greuouse and lyghter / or more light inobedience: is to
be had / and made in the law of god and not in like manner in our rule. Surely
no man will say or suppose / that more auctorite or reverence is to be given
unto any tradicions and ordinances of man: than of god. Nor yet that thing to
be more esteemed and set by that he commanded by his ministres and servant:
than that he commanded by him self. In the rule of saint Benedicte / shall we
find proper and distinct sentences and clauses or articles / where some
peynes or punisshementes ben inscripte and appointed unto the very light
defaultes: and some other appointed unto the more grievous defaultes. That more
light / or very light defaulte: is nothing else but more light / or very light
inobedience. The souereynes some time: done give very light / or small
commandments: the transgression and breakyng whereof: does according unto ye
rule cause very light / or small offenses. And yet preuaricacion / and offense
is done to god: as often as the abbottes or souereines commandment is broken
or not kept. And also / all commandments ben not promulged and openly
pronounced of ye self mouth of god: to be equal. And therefore ben they not
by like cure and diligence to be observed and kept. But without doubt a
another manner of cure and diligence: is to be given unto that commandment /
that he him self caled the principal and most high commandment. And other
cure to be given unto those (that hy be judgment) spoke of / sayng. Matt. 5. C.
Who so breaks any one of the leest of these commandments. etc. What than?
What folowethe hereof say you? I say as we have herd of the rule / yt there ben
some defaultes or offenses very grievous and some very light / and as we read in
the gospel / that some commandments ben most great and excellent and some
other most small and leest: so may we say / that all the transgressions of the
commandments ben not equal nor of like greatness / it is not therefore
necessary that I grant that you say. For you say / that one of these tweyne
must nedly follow that every commandment of the souereyne that is not
contrary unto god: is not to be taken as the commandment of god: or else that
unto a religious person / no default may be found light or venial. For
although this be true (we must need so grant) yt as often as any subject
does ouerpasse / break / or not fulfill the precepte and commandment of him
that in the stead of god: is souereyne: in any thing that does not repugne
unto justice: so often is he in obedient unto god: yet natwithstandynge as:
like cure and diligence is not required in the execusion and perfourmyng
thereof: so the sin or offense of ye transgression thereof: is not all one ne
like. For all though he be one alone that is offended (that is god) yet
natwithstandyng / those things that been commanded: ben not of one weight. And
therefore is not the tra^sgression of them to be weyde and iuged of one ieoparty
/ wherefore our holy father saint Benedicte says. Let the measure or quantite
of the exco^municacion or punisshement: be extented and pass forth according
unto the measure or quantite of the offense or trespass. In vain therefore (as
you may se) ben you affrayde in your self / and in vain also done you put
other persons in fere and dread of ye promise of obedience / that is made in
reguler profession. As though it were not necessary nor convenient for any
person to promise such obedience as he were sure he cold another keep holly
and fully nor yet ouerpasse and break: without criminal sin / because that
what so ever thing the souereyne. as the minister of god: does command not
wrongly: is (of a surete) to be imputed to god and to be accounted as his
precepte or commandment / vaynly and vnfrutfully than done you (I say) by
this occasion exaggerate / hepe and make so great and grievous: this yuell sin
of inobedie^ce: so yt you thereby should fray many persons from ye so good / so
necessary / and so noble virtue of obedience to be promised. For although it be
athing of great difficulte and hardness: to by ware / fle / and avoid this syn
of inobedie^ce / which does so privily crepe in / and (as you say) does lie i^
wait upon ye religious person among so variau^t and (in manner) innumerable
things commanded by ye souereines: yet (say I) it is not always deedly sin
nor yet criminal: to ouerpasse or not to fulfill yt is commanded. For
although every inobedie^ce be vnexcusably some manner of syn yet none
inobedie^ce is eternaly da^pnable: but ye inobedience yt is not cured or heyled
by ye remedy of penance. Nor ye it is any i^obedie^ce deedly criminal: but that
inobedie^ce that does not eshewe and avoid ye contempt of pride. A marvelous
great surete than unto the children of obedience and verily a true peace unto
men of good will is: when in all manner of obedience: impenitence alone is
condemned and dampened / which impenite^ce the person that loves god knows
not ne can skyll upon. And when pride alone: is put in crime and defaulte:
which pride ye person that dredethe the fire of hell: does sone or lightly
by ware of and avoid. This thing that we now speak of: may more evident and
more clearly appear: by.vi. examples. If my souereyne command me unto
silence: and (may fortune) by forgetfulness: a word slyppeth out and
ouerskapeth me: I knowledge my self gylty of inobedience / but only venially.
But if I of contempt: knowing / and by delibe-liberacion wylfully break out
into words / and so break the law and constitucion of silence: I make my
self tha^ a preuaricatour and breker of that law criminally / as worthy open
punisshement. And if I should persevere and continue so unto death impenitent
without contricion: than have I sinned dampnably. And does this yet seem unto
you very hard? For these (if I well remember) were your words / when you:
considering the great difficulty or (as seemed unto you) the impossibilite of
obedience to be kept / and of inobedience to be avoided: made this exclamacion
and outcrye again ye life monastical / yt is religious living / sayng: Is
this the way or path: whereby we should come unto god / which you say is so
much more sure: because it is hard / and so much the more certain: because
it is narowe and streyt? Sith a religious person: can sca^t (i^ this way)
avoid those things yt naturally ben yuell. And (because of ye common
i^firmite and fraylte of man) may sca^t fulfill those things ye naturally ben
good. And yet natwithsta^dyng must the subject necessarly / give no less
diligence to fle and avoid those things yt the souereyne does prohite and
forbede: than to observe that he commands. And yet you say forther / that
sith this sentence is byleued of many religious persons: although of few or
else of none / observed and kept unto full point and perfection: what does this
credulite and byleuyng (say you) work in the^ otherwise: tha^ did that liberte
to eat such meats as were offered unto ydoles. 1. Cor. 8.
Which liberte saint Paul so much does blame and rebuke? Surely brother
nothing else does it work if it were so as you say. For (by no means) can he
suppose well of his own conscience: that does not trust he may or can fulfill
that thing that he byleueth he is bound unto. For so you done believe / as I
shall show and as I may shortly gether and conjecture / by the tenor of your
words. That is: that the commandments of god: may scant be fully kept /
and unto ye perfect point / but the commandments of the souereyne: Matthew. 5.
may never be kept, yet the self essenciall trothe / that is our savior him
self says in the gospel / that there is not one jot of the commandments
of god: that shall pass vnkepte / but that may and shall be kept. But it
seems unto me (I speak by your patience) that who so ever so feleth and
iugeth has not yet tasted: how sweet our lord is / and yt he does mourn
and murmr yet still under the yocke and burden of the law: and has not
respired / rested / and taken conforte in the grace of ye gospel / and because
he has not yet put in experience and proved ye sweet yocke of Christ: therefore
(of a surete) is he infirmed and by his flesh made feeble: and the spirit of
god does not help and conforte his infirmite. But what means that
distinction and difference? where you say / that the commandments or
prohibicions of god: may scant be kept: but the commandments or prohibicions
of the prelates: may never in any wise be kept / as though the the one might be
kept without the the other / that is to say / the commandments of god might be
fully kept / without the commandments of man. But (if you take good head) the
commandment of god is otherwise / of the^ also that were yuell lived / or
yuell living prelates. Matthew. 23. A.
Do you (says he in the gospel) what they bid or command you. Who so ever
therefore does not so: is openly a preuaricatour and offe^der: not only again
man: but also again god. Is this troth than: that no person may execute and
fulfill perfectely the commandments of his master and prelate? And why (as
you suppose) should that so be? other because we will not: or else because we may
not? For if we have good will: and may not: we ben sure and out of ieoparty.
And it we may: and will not / than been we proud and high minded. To avoid
than that pride: I grant well that the warenes yt you speak of: is necessary
/ lest by chance the crime and great sin of inobedience: should be
co^mitteted or done. But if you suppose or believe it be impossible: yt no
resistance may be made / sometime by contempt and disdeyne: unto the
commandments of the souereynes you ben deceived. For know you for a
certente: yt not a few: but (in manner) innumerable persons have iuged utterly
otherwise. And so iuged not by any thing else than by the proper experiment and
proof of themselfs. But if you think and judge it be not impossible: but yet a
thing of great difficulty and very hard: to be so meke and obedient: yt in
no wise you should despise your souereynes and therefore you ben sometime grieved
/ because you may not follow your one mind and wit: and thefore done you
thereby murmr and grudge / again the law and ordinance of obedience:
affirmyng and sayng / that it is a thing much perilous and full of ieoparty:
for any person to promise and undertake that thing that is so laborious and
peynfull to be observed / kept / and performed: if you thus think: Matthew. 19.
Thereunto I will thus answer or rather: not I / but god does answer / sayng.
Qui Potest capere: capiat. Let him undertake this thing (says he) that may
keep and perform it / that is to mean (as I said a little before) that before
thou by ganne to bylde: thou should have provided / where of to perform the
same. But now when the matter is paste: thou should other not have tempted
assayde nor bygonne the matter / or else must thou nedely now perform that
thou have bygo^ne / natwtstandyng no manner of person / that warely and wisely
/ does make profession: does there make any promise: yt he will never hereafter
in any thing transgress and break the souereynes commandment / yt is to
mean yt he will never do syne nor offense. Or else / who so ever so does swear:
does other forswere him self / or else is he more holy / than saint James the
Apostle / that said. Iaco. 3. The consequence is that we don offend i^ many
things The antecedence is the tenoure of our profession.
In multis offendimus omnes. We done all (says he) offend in many things. If
yt now ye consequence that so consequently does follow thervpo^ seem to be
falls: let us se and perceive somewhat of the accedence of ye thing yt goth
before / lest peradventure / ye law and ordinance that is given and made to
cohibite and restreyne transgressions and defaultes: should not only not so
do: but rather should more over and for there increase ye said transgressio^s /
by the crime of perjury. So must it nedely come to pass: if we believe that
we promise in our profession / that thing that certeynely may not be holden /
kept ne performed. All this reguler obseruacio^ and keeping of obedience: must
(therefore) be divided or deperted into these two perties / yt is to say: into
precepts / or commandments: and into remedies. By the precepts: is our
life institut and ordered again al si^nes or offense / and by ye remedies: is
our innocence / after our sin and defaulte: restitut / restaured / and
performed. So (tha^) does our profession / co^pas and co^teyne both ye said
pertes yt if any protessed person (by chance) do offe^de / or trespass in
any of ye reguler precepts. he may (forth with) fle / ren / and have recourse /
unto a like reguler remedy and if he so do: tha^ although he be convinced /
proved / and condemned for a tra^sgressour and breaker of the precept and
commandment: yet can he not be convinced ne proved for a transgressors and
breaker of his pacte and profession. I would therefore judge that person alone /
to break his vow / to have defouled his purpose and to have preuaricate and
broken his pacte / co^nau^t and promise of profession: that will contempne and
despise / both the precepte and also the remedy. For I dare well say: that he
is sure of salvation: that (although he sometime pass the mark or mere of
obedience) does not forsake the counsel of penance / as remedy. For ye
person (although he oftymes offe^de and trespass) does not yet ouerpasse ye
meeres and marks of ye rule ne break the reguler statutes: yt does not
forsake fle / and avoid the discipline and correxion of the censure and
judgment that apperteyneth unto the rule. For reguler correction: is a part of
the rule. And therein is found: not only the instruction of good life: but
also the reformacion and amendment of yuel life. For in it be found bode the
precepts and commandments of obedience / and also the remedies of
inobedie^ce / so that although we offe^de and do amysse yet done not we recede
nor depart from the rule. I knowledge and grant well / that never at any time
to sin or offend in the precepts of obedience (at the leest) venially: is
(unto any mortal person) impossible / and very hard. But yet there is now
no quarrel nor co^playnt to be made of impossibilite. Because that: if by
chance a crime be done: it is law full / and that by the self rule: to make
amends. That thing therefore that you say: that is / that every thing that is
commanded by the souereynes: can not be kept of any person / unto the full
point and holly: is truth. But yet some offense of inobedie^ce is a light
offense. And the light and easy cure and remedy thereof: is found in the rule /
so the transgression be without contempt. But if you would contend by
oppinion: that inobedience may not sometimes be without such contempt: that
is clearly falls / and nothing so. And yet natwithstandyng: ye diligence of the
rule / does not leave such obedience: without cure and remedy. And although
such inobedience should need / and require a more strong medicine of cure and
remedy and more streyte correction: yet is it without the morbe and sin of
preuaricacio^ / except ye (by chance) the self medicine / and remedy: were
also i^ conte^pte and despised: Sith al these things tha^ ben true: vaynly and
without cause done we yt done profess ye rule compain of impossibilite and
without cause done we flater our self of necessite to offend / sayng we must
nedly sin and offend. I mean that we have no cause to complain of any
such impossibilite or necessite: whereby we might therefore suppose and think
that the just commandments of our prelates were not imputed to god / as to
be his commandments: but rather as the commandments of men: to be
despised and set at naught lest our profession should thereby: seem to conteyne
a thing impossible / if we thereof should affirm and say: that we ought of
duete to be as much obedient unto our prelates: as unto god. How may it be
now (after this declaracion) that such profession may be unto any person
impossible / but rather contrary / that to avoid preuaricacion: should not be
a thing very light and easy? where not inobedience / but impenitence: does
cause and make ye preuaricacio^? For (as I said) no person that makes
profession / does promise that he will never here after offend / or do sin.
And therefore though a person (by some manner of mean) be not obedient: he
does not there by make him self forthwith a preuaricatoure and breaker of the
rule / except peradventure it were such a person that falsely supposed he were
so professed / which manner of persons you say there ben many. Of the which
persons (I say also) if any such be as you say / tha^ is it true also that
follows / that is to say / that such manner of credulite and believe (which
may rather be caled a folysshe credulite / or cruelte) does nothing else work
and engender in their conscience / than did that noyous and yuell liberty
work / in the conscience of them that fed upon such needs (...) meats / as
were offered unto the ydoles. For it must needs be: that such folysshe
persons: in their own or by thyr proper conscience: in like manner / as the
Apostle Paul said: the infirm person and folysshe christian did perrysshe:
in the science and knowledge of the^ that did eat and feed upon the sacrifice
of the ydoles. And like (as saint Paul says) that no manner of meat received
and taken with due thanks unto our lord: 1 Cor. 8. 1. This. 4.
is common and unlawful / but unto the^ only that done think and judge it
unlawful. So in likewise: reguler profession (as of it self) can be unto no
persons dampnable ne hurt: but only unto them that done think and judge it
dampnable and yuell. And how far any person should think / or judge thereof:
I have (as I suppose) showed you sufficientely before. Now therefore I must
answer you unto the little praty question / that by chance came unto your
mind by occasion of this present chapitre of saint Paul. For you done ask
and demand: whether this sentence of saint Paul spoken unto the Romans of
the ydololetites / that is to say: To. 14.
the things that were offered in sacrifice unto the ydoles where he says / I
suppose and judge / that nothing is common / unclean / and unlawful in
Christ or unto any christian: but only unto him yt does think and judge the
thing unclean / and unlawful. And again likewise of this sentence. If a
person eat and feed those meats: he is dampened / because he does it not of
feyth / or by right feythe you done ask (I say) of these two sentences:
whether they may both be taken as a reule general / to hold in all other
things like / so that if a person do a good deed supposyng / and byleuyng it
be yuell / that is ta say / if he do it with an yuell intent: whether that
good deed shall be unto him yuell / and whether it shall be as much / or as
great yuell as he thought / and byleued it was? And than if I grant and say
it is so / than done you go forther / and ask of me: why than (on the
contrary part) should not every deed that a person does / be unto him / as
much good and profitable a deed as he does suppose and believe it is /
although he were deceived in so byleuynge? For it does seem unto you
marvelous / and a thing contrary unto justice and right: that the opinion of
a man's intent should more prevail in the yuell / tha^ in the good. Matthew. 6.
If now I answer you / and say / yt so to believe of the yuell: is but right
/ because of ye gospel that so does conclude of the wyked eye or sight whereby
is meant the wyked / and yuell intent: than will you answer again thereunto /
and say that in like manner may you think of right to be iuged of the good /
because the same gospel does so conclude of the simple eye or sight / whereby
is meant the good intent. For he that said that the darkness of the body / that
is to mean / the hole work or deed of the person shall be esteemed / weyde /
and iuged yuell of the wyked eye / or sight / that is / according unto the yuel
intent and mind: ye same person said and declared / yt (in like manner) ye
light of ye body / yt is / the same work: shall be approved for good of the
simple eye or sight / that is to mean / of ye good intent. But here (good
brethren) take good head and look well / and you shall perceive yt ye eye or
sight yt is deceived: is not verily and truly simple. For ye person that does
think and suppose that good is yuell: as well is deceived: as is the person
yt does think or believe / that yuell is good. But you know well / that another
of these two persons: does avoid or escape the vengeance and curse of the
prophet. Esai. 5.
Where he says. Ve vobis, qui dicit is bonum malum, et malum bonum. Woe and
vengeance (says he) be unto you / that say / and done affirm / that good: is
yuell / and that yuell: is good. And yet / sith no person that would avoid
that curse of the prophet: Nota textum hic defie^.
will deney or contrary that our savior essenciall troth did pronounce and
show / sayng that the simple eye or sight / and the good intent of the simple
person: is the light of the hole body / that is to say / an argument and
evidence of the hole work / god forbede that the proclaymer and prophet of
truth should any thing proclaim and speak outward contrary unto the very
said essenciall truth that is our savior / or that he should curse that our
savior did approve / that can not be / wherefore ye must take a another sense
and understanding. For I think and judge / that to approve that an eye or sight
/ that that is the intent of the person be very and truly simple: two
things ben thereunto required / that is to say: charity in the intent and
purpose / and also truth in the election and chose / or choosing of the work
intended and purposed. For if a person (intendyng well) do love that is good /
but yet do not chose yt is true / he has (I deney not) a zele of god / but not
according unto science and lernyng. To. 10. A.
And I can not tell ne know: how (by the judgment of truth) very simplicite
or simplenes / may stand with falsite or falsnes. Therefore / the essenciall
truth / yt is our master and savior: wyllyng to instruct / teach / and to
bring his disciples unto very and true simplicite: Matthew. 10.
said unto them. Be you prudent and wise / as serpents ben wise. And be you
simple and plain as doves been simple and without deceyte / he put prudence
before / without which: he knew well no man man might be simple. How than
should the sight / eye / or intent be verily simple / with the ignorance of
the touthe? Or how may that simplicite be caled very and true simplicite:
whereof simple and and unfeigned troth is ignorant and has no knowledge. For
scripture says. The person ignorant and without knowledge: 1. Cor. 14.
shall (in lykwyse) be unknown / it is therefore evident / and plainly does
appear: that the laudable simplicite which our lord him self co^me^ded and
praised: can not be without these two virtues / beniuolence / and prudence. So
that the eye and sight of the heart / that is to say the intent of the mind of
the person be so religious and devout that he would not in any wise deceive:
and also / so prudent and ware: that he can not be deceived. But like as these
two virtues / that is to say / the love and desire of goodness / and the
knowledge of the troth: done make the eye / sight / and the intent simple / and
without deceyte. So (on the contrary part) these two vices and yuelles / that
is to say / blyndnes or ignorance / and also peruersite or frowardnes / done
make the eye and intent wicked and yuell / ignorance causes the person: that
he knows not the troth and peruercite or frowardnes: causes him to love
iniquite deceyte and doublenes. And yet: between these two virtues that done
not suffer the person to deceive / nor yet to be deceived: and the two vices /
that done cause him both to deceive and be deceived: ben other two means / a
good and an yuell. The good is a mean virtue / whereby ye inward eye / or
sight of the soul / although it might be deceived by the ignorance of the
troth: yet be the zele of goodness does it never consent to deceive in any
wise. The yuell mean is a vice that although it nothing does let or hinder
the knowledge of the truth: yet (because of very malice) he does not feel ne
perceive the love of goodness. And because that by division of parcelles or
parts: every thing may be the better known and perceived: we shall here
(according unto ye two vices / and unto the two virtues before rehearsed) divide
ye eye or sight of the heart / into.iiii. parts or percelles / that is to say
/ into an eye or sight / good: and better / yuell and worse / whereof now we
shall set forth examples. Some person (in case) loves that is good and
intends well: and yet (by ignorance and default of knowledge) does yuell.
This eye and sight of the person: is good / because it is religious / devout
/ and well meaning / but yet is it not simple / because it is blind. Another
person / does good and means well / and also does thereunto prudently and by
good warenes: understand and know well what he does / the eye or sight of
this person: dare I well say is verily and truly simple. For it lacks
another of the two said virtues / that is to say / another good zele / ne yet
science or lernyng. This eye sight and intent does our lord god require /
wha^ (as the prophet says) he does byholde and consider among the frail men
of the world: Psalm. 13.
if any of them do by good understanding: require and seek god. Some person
(on the contrary part) has no love unto any good thing / and also there
unto by malice: is perverse and froward / and yet has he wit and wisdom
enough to do yuell this person is not blind by ignorance / and therefore I
would not call his eye sight or intent utterly wicked / because he has one of
the virtues that before I caled good / that is to say / science / lernyng / and
knowledge / although he have it unto his own hurt and yuell / land not unto his
profytte nor good: yet there is a another person in our said case / that (by
ignorance and default of knowledge) does a thing yt is good / and knows not
thereof / and would not have done it if he had known / because he loves not
that is good / unto this manner of person would I assign appoint / and apply
/ as very convenient: that vice that in the said gospel / is caled or named
wicked / because he lacks another of these two forsaid vices that is to say /
another cecite or blyndnes / nor yet peruersite and frowardnes. For this word
nequam / yt is / wicked / does signify and betoken that person / that by no
means / nor in any thing: does appear or seem good / but lacks and is
clearly void / of both the said virtues / that is to say both knowledge of ye
troth and also beniuole^ce a good will to do good. One eye sight or intent is
devout: religious and well meaning and nothing prompt ready ne disposed to
deceive / in any wise / but yet (as I said) prone / ready / and light to be
deceived / of whom the prophet Osee spekethe saying. Osee. 7.
The people of Effraim (says he) is like a dove deceived / that has no
heart malicious. Another eye / sight / and intent / that our savior in the
said gospel caled simple: Math. 10.
is another light to deceive nor to be deceived / whereof ye Apostles were taght
by our savior. Wha^ he said Estote prudentes. etc. Be you (said he) prudent
and ware: as the serpent / and be you simple: as doves. yet is there a another
eye / sight / and intent / that is utterly yuell and naught / which will be
glad / and ready to deceive: but not light to be deceived. This eye sight / and
intent have those persons that (by ye mouth of our savior) been caled the
children of this world more prudent / wise / and ware / in their generation
and kind: Luce. 16.
tha^ ben the children of light and grace. And yet a another eye sight / and
intent we determined before to be wicked: because it is yuell in two manners /
by double vice. For in this intent / both malice does engender and cause
ignorance / and also that ignorance: does oftymes coure and let the malice.
So that the person many times (by ignorance) does not that yuell and hurt
that he would and purposed to do / and somtymes he does a good deed that he
never would ne purposed to do. The unsavory and folysshe hurt of such
persons (as saint Paul says) is made dark or blind / and they (by the
justice of god) rendered and brought unto a reprouable and yuell sense and
understanding. To. 1. C.
So that utterly they another love yt is good / ne yet can know or understand
what is good. Of these manner of persons scripture says. Prouer. 18.
Impius: cum venerit in profundu^ malorum: contemnit. The wicked person: when
he comes or falls unto the profundite and depthe or depnes of all yuelles:
than does he contemn / despise / and set al at naught. For surely such manner
of persons will not avoid yuell though they might. Ne yet though they
would: they can not wit or know how to avoid it / wherefore: in ye division
above rehearsed: I iuged this eye sight and intent (of good reason) to be the
worse of the.ii. yuell inte^tes / not because it is more malign or malicious:
but because it is more perilous. For ignorance does make a person more sure
and careless of him self. And such securite and surete: does make him more
dull and stuggysshe: but not more wicked or yuell. For they ben both like in
wyckednes or yuell / natwithstande yet is this intent worse (doutles) than the
other / because the other has but one of the two forsayde vices / that is to
say an yuell mind and purpose. And this has also with the yuell intent / a
falls consideracion or opinion. The other eye / or sight / lacks but one of
the said virtues / that is to say: good zele / and this intent lacks both
good zele and also true judgment. Of this worst eye sight / and intent / than /
that has another of the said virtues / charity / or good zele / nor yet
science or true judgment. And also of the other best eye sight and entente /
that lackethe another of the same virtues: did our savior / very essensiall
troth: dispute and argue / the hole body / that is / the hole wercke or deed
of ye person: other to be wrapped in the darnes of sin / or else to be
garnysshed with the sight of grace. For the other two eye syghtes or intentes
because that another of them has / other both the said virtues / or yet both
the said vices: can give another light nor darkness unto the hole body / that is
/ the work or deed of the person / although they might partly give some
light or darkness thereunto. Let us now return again unto your demand and
question. If than that eye or sight / and intent be verily wicked / that both
peruers or froward / and also blind and ignorant: do a good deed / and yet
believe it be yuel: so in doing and workyng ryghtly and well: but supposyng in
opinion wyckedly and ^mys: he does (by that mean) turn that thing yt was
good: into yuell unto him self / and also he does turn it into as great
yuell as he byleuthe it be. Because that (according unto the sentence of our
savior) the wicked eye sight and intent: Matthew. 6.
does render and make all the hole body: that is all the work tenebroule and
dark / without any light of grace. For what is left and referred unto the
light of grace. where another a devout or good intent: nor yet a good opinion
is had or found? But yet it follows not thereof / that he that (on the
contrary part) does yuell and supposes and byleueth he does good: should
therefore find or win merit according unto his feith and believe. And why so?
For this of a surete is not such a simple eye or sight / and intent / as we
did before describe / and define / that should (by the judgment of truth)
render and make all the body bright / that is all the work good. For that
intent and mind is not all void of darkness: where the ignorance of
truth: He that does good intending yuele: does heurte him self alone /
and does profit unto other by the good deed / but he that does yuele
intending well / he does both heurte him self by ignorance / and also
heurte unto other by the yuele deed.
does obscure and blemyshe the light of the will. Sith than the froward and
blind eye / sight / and intent / that does good / intending yuell: has
both of the two said vices / that is yuel will and ignorance. And sith also
this eye / sight / and intent / that does yuell / intending good: has not
both the said virtues / zele / and science: does not good reason require and
conclude that he yt does yuell / instead of good: does more noy and hurt:
tha^ the other does profytte / that does good intending yuell. For it is not
consequent / nor according unto reason: that one good thing / may so much
avail and profitte unto goodness / as may two yuel things unto yuell. And yet
would I say / that a good religious and devout intent alone: is worthy land
and praise And yet shall the good will (for a surete) not be defrauded of
co^digne and worthy reward / i^ a deed also not good / that is in an yuell
deed. And yet natwtsta^dyng very simplicite: shall never be deceived without some
manner of yuell. Why so say you? does not si^plicite / or the si^ple person do
all of feyth / or according unto feyth? I say not nay / but he do it of feyth
/ but yet I say / that his feythe is deceived and false / and so I may rather
say: that he does it not of very feith. For a falls or deceived feyth: is no
feyth. To. 14.
And I think and judge verily / that the Apostle spoke of very and true feyth /
and not of deceived or falls feith when he said / all that is not of feyth: is
sin and offense. But that thing that is yuell: can never be supposed nor
byleued (of very true feythe) to be good. For yuel is false. And therefore is it
sin. That chapter therefore of the Apostle Paul / where he says / all yt is
not feyth is find. etc. does conteyne and couple both these said vices /
that is to say both blind malice / and also deceived innocency or si^plicite.
For what so ever is done of an ignorant person is amys / for if it be good:
an yuell intent: does utterly condemn it and make it naught. And if it be
yuell: the right or good intent: does not fully excuse it / whether than a
person do think / suppose / or judge / a good thing that he does by chance or
by ignorance: to be yuell or whether he shall believe an yuell thing that he
does in like manner: to be good: he is deceived. For both be sin / because
another is of feyth / nor according unto very true feythe. Although (for a
certei^te) the person that with a good intent does a deed / reprouable and
semyng yuell outward / does less sin: than does he that with a prive
malicious intent: does a deed that is not yuell. For that thing can never be
pure good: that is done with any manner sin / though never so little. How
may than a thing that is not pure good / be compared in effect and workyng:
unto that thing / that is pure and utterly naught / and yuell? that is to
mean. How may the imperfecte good intent: work in effect and cause / as
much good unto the person: as the pure yuell intent: may cause hurt / and
yuell unto the other person? it can not be let thefore these co^clusions / and
determinacions / suffice you as unto this question. For the other questions /
that you asked and moved before: ben (as I suppose) sufficientely answered also
before. And yet surely / you done oftymes iterate / rehearse / reuolue / and
turn again the same / and self dubitacions or doutes. But I have not so
much care / so often to repete / and rehearse the solucions. For it is
sufficient one to assoyle and answer that thing / yt by many questions was
moved and labored / or that oftymes has common in question / when you also
asked and pull question of the weghte / and charge of obedience or of the peryle
/ and ieoparty of disobedience: a another thing fell by chance into your mind
/ on side half: to spur and make question of the merit of them both / that
is to say / whether in all precepts in obedience should so much grieve and
hinder merit as obedience does avail and profytte. Or thus / whether in all
precepts / the merit of obedience should be equal and like in quantite /
unto the pain and deseruyng: Gene. 22.
of inobedience / as by example of Abraham in the oblacion of his sone / or else
of that man (I can not tell his name) spoken of / in vitas Patrum / that (by
the commandment of his souereyne) did cast his own child quick into a
hole fla^mynge oven or furnes / whether now these two persons (by the merit
of their deseruyng) should have had so much indignacion of god / and vengeance
or punisshement if they had not ben obedient / as they have now laud / praise
/ thank / and grace / because they were obediente / which thing semethe unto
you both hard and grievous / and yet necessary so to be. Part. 2. Ca. seu
li. de obediencia.
But yet it is not so as you think or suppose. For sure it is that many
things can not be done without glory and praise / and yet the same things
may be undone without sin or offense / and so if they be done they been
worthy reward / and yet if they been not done: they be not worthy any pain or
punissheme^t. For never to touch any woman: is a thing of great and singular
merit. And yet a man to touch his own wife: is no sin. Of such manner ben
all the counsayles that been like unto that chapitre of the gospel / where is
said. Qui potest capere: capiat. Who so ever may take this counsel and has
strength to perform it: let him take it. Matthew. 19. B.
And again on the contrary part. Some other things neglected and set one
part undone: done engender and cause sin and offense: and yet if they be
fulfilled and wrought they deserve no glory ne thank. They both condemn
their dispiser / and done not glorify their auctour / and doer / or worker.
Such ben all things / wherewith we all by god him self in ye common and open
law ben charged without which: He that does no hurt shall escape
punishshement. Luce. 6.
no person may be saved. And thereof arose this proverb among the gentiles. I
have done no theft / or I did never theft. Thou shall not (than) feed crows
hangyng in the galawes. And our savior says in the gospel / if you do love
only them that done love you: what reward shall you have? And if you salute
and speak fair and confortably: Matthew. 5.
unto your brethren and neghbours only: what do you more therein / than done
ethnykes and hethen people. And yet again universally. Lu. 17. C.
When you have performed and done al things that were commanded you: say you
/ we ben unprofitable servants. For we have done but that we ought of duete
for to do / as though he should say / if you be content with the only
precepts and tradicions or ordinances of the law wherewith you ben charged.
And do not wilfully submit and bind your self unto the counsayles also and
persuasions or aduiseme^tes of perfection: you ben fre and discharged of debt
/ but yet you ben not for any merit glorious to be praised you have skaped
from pain / but yet have not you gotten any crown. No manner of necessite or
need (than) does co^streyne you to be obedient unto every si^guler thing that
is enjoined or commanded you / nor yet to dread vengeance or punisshement for
the transgression of every singular thing. Nor yet to have hope and trust to
be rewarded for the obseruyng and perfourmyng of every such thing. Let this
rule therefore in all such things be generally holden and kept that in all
things of great difficulte and hard to be done: we should judge and think the
obedience and perfourmynge of the^ to be more thankful and more worthy reward
than the preuaricacion and brekynge of them: to be more grievous or to deserve
more pain. And i^ those precepts that be light to be done / and of less cure
burden / and charge: let us think and judge: the co^tempte more to be
dampnable / tha^ the deed or doing of them to be laudable. Now sith we have
here of spoken sufficiently / let us now also se (for your forther demand)
how firmly and constau^tly: the stabilite of the place: which in the
profession of every person: is wont to be made steadfast / should be holde^ and
kept / that is to mean / whether a person professed may leave and forsake the
place of his profession for any cause. And if there be any such causes: what
manner of causes they should than be: for the which: it should be other lawful
or expedient for any person: to break that said stabilite / and to forsake his
place. For hereof (you say) you doure or be in doubt / unto yt which (in the
mean time / sure and certain now now of this that I say) I will thus
answer / yt by no means it may be lawful for any person / to desce^d or go
dounwarde from any good state of perfection which state he has ones before
vowed and promised to keep. And thereunto I say also / that I would not i^ any
wise / counsel any person to change that place / which he had ones chosen
him self / and (by his own frewyl) had firmed and fastened himself unto ye
same. And of ye same mind is ye holy pope saint Gregory sayng. Al manner of
perfect persons: done look well unto themself with great subtilite / and
narowe study of discrecio^: that they never in other deed or thought: slip /
fall / or faint any time / from their better state or condition of living unto
worse. But the holy Apostle Paul did rejoice that he had in deed fulfilled the
same thing that this said apostolical saint: did hereof feel and judge. Phil.
3. C.
Those things (says he) that been left behind me: I do forget / and ever do I
exte^de and streche forth my self: unto those things that been before me of
more high perfection. And the / pro-Ezechiel did signify the same / wha^ he
spoke of the holy beasts sayng. Ezechiel. 1.
When they went forth: they did not return ne turn back again / but
eueryche of them: went forth before his face. And all these holy auctorites in
so understanding and iugynge: did none other but follow the sentence of their
master that he spoke in the gospel sayng. Luce. 9.
No person strechynge and putting forth his hand unto ye ploghe and lokyng
back: The interpretacion of the translatour.
is apt or convenient for the realm and kingdom of god (That is to mean
that no person that does entreprise / and take upon him any perfection and tha^
goth back and forsakes ye same: is apt or mete to be a child of salvation)
let therefore the pacte and promise of stabilite made i^ profession: prescribe
and have auctorite in every religious person: above ye remysse and light
descence / and also above ye co^tencious flyttyng and departing from one place
unto a another / and likewise of all wandryng and curious or new fangle
discourses and re^nynges and gaddyng about to se news / and (shortly to
conclude) let that promise of stabilite / put away all waueryng minds and
lyghtnes of co^stancy. And yet natwtsta^dyng ye said pact and promise of
stabilite: has not that auctorite in those things that done follow and ben
required i^ the serye and order of the profession / that is to say in the
conversion and change of manners / and in that obedience that is made and
promised after or according unto the rule. For if these things / that is /
religious manner / due obedience and reguler obseruaunce: might not there
(peradventure) be obtained and learned / because of the improbite yuell manners /
and of the vnreligious byhauioure of the company: than dare I boldly (without
fere or doubt) counsel that person (moved and led by the spirit of liberty
/ that is to say the spirit of Christ) to flytte / remove / and go forth
unto an other well ordered place / where that said person: should not be let
to render and yield unto our lord god his vow and promise that he made with
his mouth. For surely as the prophet says. Psalm. 75. Psalm. 17.
Cum sancto: sanctus eris, et cum peruerso peruerteris. with good and holy
company: thou shall be holy and virtuous / and with peruers and froward or
misordred company: shall thou be froward and disordred. But surely from any
monastery religious and well ordered: shall no professed person depart by my
counsel / although it were for ye desire of a more streyt life without
license of his souereyne / natwithstandyng: if the person have departed and be
gone forth and have found and chosen a better state / and condition: than would
not I advise him by any means to return and turn again / unto that
inferior and lower perfection which he left / forsook / and despised for to
have that better provided always / that the better state be such as does seem
to be congruent and according / unto his first or fore profession. For let him
look well / by what reason / for what cause / and by what intent / he presumed
and took upon him that more high perfection / and strayter life. For (by my
counseyle) he shall never play the apostata in retournyng and tournyng again
unto the lower perfection or more easy life. Except (natwithstandyng) he were
revoked and caled home again by the company of his first place / as not
lawfully departed thens. For no person of a known monastery may be retained
nor yet received regulerly: without the consent of his souereyne. And you may
take the reason of this sentence more openly by example. A person (in case) of
the rule of saint Augustyne / professed among reguler chanons: Te exemple of
saint Bernarde is of the Clumacensis and of the Cisterciensis.
would (for more perfection) streyne and bind him self unto the pouerte of the
dominikes / caled the freres preachers or black freres / al of one rule / and
that he would do to chose rather to observe the purite of the rule: tha^ the
customs of his own monastery. Surely if he would ask my counsel I would
not counsel him so to do / without the consent of his souereyne. And why so?
first (I say) for the slander and occasion of that company that he leyueth
or forsakes / and than because it is no surete of salvation: to leave and
forsake certeynte: for things doutfull. For peradventure he has power and
strength to keep that he has professed / and has not so to keep the other.
And the third cause is / because I have leuite / and lyghtnes ever suspecte.
For thereby / that thing oftymes: that we lightly / and sone done will and
desire before we have proved or asayde it: wha^ we have experience thereof: than
will we not meddle therewith / but nerehande in ye same moment or short space of
time: both we done couete and also forsake the same thing / as well by great
lyghtnes as without reason. Of many such: have we oftymes experience / that i^
during and abydyng skant one hour in one mind or will / and blown about
with the wind of leuite or lyghtnes / vagabondes and unstable: done ryle and
stomble / like unto droncardes or dronken persons / and for to have
experience: they change their judgment / or rather without judgment or reason
flowyng and re^nyng about. Full of trouble and makebates: done presume so many
counsayles of them self: as they visit places / ever coveting and desyryng
that thing that they lack or have not and yt they have: they done loathe and
sone ben they weary thereof. And how says some person that has professed a
rule should I live (with good conscience) contrary that rule / or not after
and according unto that rule? For making a vow and promise: and not
perfourmynge the same: what do I else: but forswere my self? As though (say
I) thou may not have in a another place: whereof thou should much more
complain and grudge in conscience when thou begynnest to live poorly
according unto thy rule. For a surety (brother) yuen than shall thou say in
like wise. By what conscience may I sustain and bear: to bide and dwell out
of my first house / that received me when I fled out of the world / and did
consecrate me in this holy habit / and so marked and signed me to be a child
of salvation. And I there was molestious and combrouse unto my brethren / and
inobedient unto my souereyne. And over all this I have broken the pacte and
promise of stabilite / and thus made my first feyth: vain and void. Such
combraunce of conscience shall they have that been flytters and chaungeable
light persons natwithstandyng. Another of these querimonies or grudges is good
or just. For that person / that does suppose and think yt he is forsworn
because he does not observe and keep the rule in every point: does seem unto
me not well to attend and head what he swear. For no person when he is
professed: does profess or promise the reule / but every person does promise
/ that he will direct and order his conversion / and also his co^uersacio^ and
manner of living: after or according unto the rule. This (for the most part) is
the common profession of all religious persons in this time / that is to say
/ after or according unto the rule. And although god be served in diverse
monasteries: by diverse obseruau^ces: as long natwithstandynge as every person
does keep the good uses and customs of his place: no doubt but that he lives
after or according unto the rule. For good vsages: done not discord with the
rule. Who so ever that does hold and keep the good manner that he fyndeth kept
/ in the place where he is professed: he (for a surete) does live as he
promised. For (doutles) no person does promise / or promitte any other thing
than seems unto him that ye religious life / or living of the^ / does hold
and keep: with whom he has diposed and chosen (from thens forth) all his
life to live reason why. For the simple persons of a poor monastery done not
profess ne promise: the use and customs / the lernyng and connyng nor
sole^pne ceremonies of a great monastery / nor one monastery does promise /
the distriction and hard living of a another monastery. And yet
natwithstandyng all religious persons done make profession: after or according
unto the rule. For every where the promise of the mouth and the words ben all
one / after one manner. But because the intent of ye heart and mind is not in all persons one and like: the obseruacion and manner of doing in their works /
may doutles (without any detriment or hyndrau^ce of salvation / and without
damage or offense of the profession) be unlike and not al one in all places /
like as all persons (although good christianes) done not yet keep and hold
al things in like that been contained in the gospel / and yet natwithstandyng:
all done live after or according unto the gospel. For those persons that been
content to live in the bond of wedloke / after the grant of god and the
church: done not yet believe that they have therefore received or departed / and
forsaken the gospel because they have not chosen nor taken the way of the
high perfection of that counsel to live in virginite / or in continency: So
in like manner those religious persons / that have purposed and promised to
live after or according unto the rule: although they keep not all the hole
rule precisely and (as they say) unto the point: And although they change
and leave some things according unto the use / and custom of their clauster or
monastery: yet done not they therefore disced / or go holly from their
profession / as long as they done live soberly / justly / and religiously
according unto the manners of their company. The self rule therefore: does put
the.viii. degree of humilite / that a religious person shall nothing do: but
that the common rule of the monastery / or else examples of ye seniores: done
exhort / counsel or require to be done. Except therefore / the order of the
cistercienses / and such other religious persons / that done follow their
custom therein / that is to say / that done cure and give diligence: not
only to live after or according unto the rule: but also to hold / and keep
holly and precisely after the letter: all the very rule (as they verily think
and suppose they have professed) this manner of persons (I say) excepted: let
not (from hens forth) the reguler and solemn profession / in the which no
promise is made of all the hole rule: move / fere / or put in conscience any
person that does live in obedience / in those places or monasteries wherein due
order and discipline is kept with good customs. The profession therefore is
sure and safe unto every person / in all monasteries well ordered / al only
the intent and mind / or purpose of the person be good sure and save. But
natwithstandynge: if a person be unquiet / and can not believe this yt I have
said but rather byleuyng / and gyuynge place unto his own conscience that
pricketh and grudgeth therewith / and so goth forth / and does depart / and
does search / and seek a another place / where he may render and perform his
vow / and promise that he made after his own judgment and mind in his own
place / and did not there perform the same: as I do not praise nor approve
his going forth: so do I not counsel that he should return so
natwithstandyng: that he go far away and unto a strange / and unknown
monastery / and why so? For two causes / one is the sentence of saint Paul
which does openly declare that he is blessed and happy: that does not judge
him self in that thing yt he does approve. To. 14. D.
Another cause is the auctorite of our master saint Benedicte / that in the
rule does command such persons to be received and retained. And found or
proved good and virtuous: Ca. de monachis peregrinis.
to be conforted be good persuasion and counsel / and there by profession to
be bound. These ben the words of the rule. Let such a person (says he) be
persuaded / advised / and counsayled: there still to abide And lest peradventure
/ the same person remembryng his own monastery / and grudgynge (as oftymes
happeth) in conscience: would bygynne to compain again upon the brekyng of
his first stabilite: the same rule does again such scrupulosite show a
general / and confortable sentence and counsel sayng In every place: one god
is served / all our labors every where ben done unto one prince and king.
And yet does he prohibit and forbede the same thing of the nere monastery:
that he co^maundethe of the peregrine and strange monastery. And the cause
thereof: is lest the nere abiding: as a fode or nurysshyng of the slander or
occasion: should be a matter or occasion of stryfte and debate between the
monasteries: if they should take and receive the religious persons either of
other without only the consent each of other / of the which thing we have
experience as often times: as any such receyuyng or taking is presumed
contrary unto the decre and determinacio^ of ye rule. And if also afterward:
ye record and remembrance of ye slander and occasion yt deperting he gave
unto the brethren whom he left: do any time (i^ case) move and grudge ye
unquiet heart and mind of any such person regulerly received and taken: and
that he think: yt he must nedely amend by his return that by his departing
he did offend: let that person that so thinks: wisely and with good
foresyght / consider: that one slander or occasion: is not well amended by a
another. For what amends is that: when thou doste satisfy some persons of the
slander given unto them: and thereby give a new slander or occasion unto
other persons / although (for a cer^eynte) that slander or occasion that is
done / hy the intent to profytte unto the better: is more tolerable / and more
venial and less sin: than is ye slander that the person does think to
give wha^ he should be an apostata unto worse and less perfection. But the
person also without any doubt did before more surely follow his conscience
(although not without slander and occasion) unto that way yt he supposed and
thought better: than if he had (contrary unto his conscience) remained and
tarried still in his tyrste place where he was / and yet might he well and surely
have byden and tarried there still: if he could thereby / have been well assured
and satisfied of his own conscience. Wherefore now / let us in the conclusion
of this disputacion: usurp and use ye same judgment that saint Paul gave of
that person that would eat and feed / and of that person that would not eat
nor feed of those meats that seemed unlawful / that is to say / that he yt
moved and compelled (by his own proper conscience) did leyue and forsake his
place: because (as seemed unto hi^) he would not forsake ne break his vow:
should in no wise despise him that would not so leave ne forsake his place And
again / he that sure in conscience: dredyng the slander and offense of his
brethren: would not leave ne forsake his brethren: should in no wise judge ne
co^dempne the person that did depart. And thus as unto these matters: I pray
you take me well / and yt I have answered: as I feel / perceive / and
understand without any prejudice unto them that can better perceive or feel.
Forthermore yet you ask and require me to assoyle you certain questions. The
first / where a person had honted / and soght about for ye habit of
religion / which he devoutly received and afterward as vndeuoutly and
wyckedly did reiecte / cast away and forsake the same: you ask now why that
saint Gregory knowing the matter: did not constrayne him to resume and take
again his habit / but also granted unto the apostata so perduring and
abydyng: all manner of communion. The second question / why saint Augustine:
does (in some manner subdue the vow of continency and chastity: unto ye law
of matrimony / that is to mean / to make and judge the vow of chastity to be
lower in degree than the law of matrimony. In so much that in ye book he
wrote of virginite: he semethe to affirm / yt unto the chaste persons: the
forepurpose and promise of that life: may not prescribe ne have auctorite and
strength / above matrimony coupled to gether and duly knitte: Understand
this auctorite of saint Augustine i^ the simple vow of chastity / not the vow
of solemn profession in religion.
but that matrimony promised by lawful contracte: of them also that (by the
deceyte of the dyuell) have broken their vow of holiness and chastity: shall
remain and bide indissoluble and vndepertable. And unto these questions (as
for this present time) no thing co^methe unto mind or remembrance more
certeynly and more shortly to be answered: than that these holy bisshoppes and
saints did so understand and think best / but whether they ryghtly and well
did therein: let them look and se them self. For in the senses or understanding
/ and i^ acts or deeds of noble fathers / I am surely ware: that by no means
I estteme / think / or judge any other: than (saint Paul to wytnes) was than
required among the dispenses and ministers of Christ / yt is to say / that
eueriche be found and proved feythfull and true For I am i^ certente: 1. Co.
4. A.
whether they abou^ded in their own sense / and spoke after their own mind
and feling or whether they abou^ded and spoke in the spirit of god / they both
as in all other things: so likewise in these things: were feythfull and true.
The the one in dispensyng and ministering that thing that was before his hands
and in his power of judgment. And the the other in writtyng that he felt /
understood and perceived. That you yet forther done ask and spur of certain
bysshopes / whom (as is wryte^) ye same saint Gregory the pope: did (for a
time) enclose or shytte up i^ monasteries for their excesses and defaultes
whether (in that mean time) dwelling among ye religious persons: they ware
their own habit and array: or else the monastical habit of the religion? unto
this question: I can nothing answer: but yt it seems more credeble: that
they did not receive ye notable habit: which they should not have perpetually
nor continually keep / but rather that / that in the secrets of the
monasteries: they only soght quietude and rest / and oportunite of penance.
You would also here this thing of me / why or wherefore among al other
institutes and ordinances of penance the discipline of ye monasteries / and
the life of religion: should have this prerogatyfe / that it may be called a
second / or the second baptism? The laud of religious living.
I suppose and judge / the cause why: is for the perfytte renouncing and
forsakyng of the world / and for the singular excellency / of the life
spiritual / whereby / this manner of co^uersacion and living / excelling and
ouerpassing in perfection all other of man's life: does make the professers
and lovers thereof: more like unto Angels of heaven than unto men of this world
/ and thereunto does refourme i^ man ye image of god and does assign mark /
and appoint us (as by special badge of arms) unto Christ as does baptism.
And so been we as baptized the second time: in that we done (as saint Paul
says) mortify our members / which ben upon yerth / and done cloth our self
and put Christ him self upon us / as our lyuerey garment / planted and newly
set and roted again unto ye similitude of his death. Collo. 3. A.
To. 13. D.
And also likewise as by baptism we ben delivered from the power of darkness
and sin original and ben translate and co^uehed into ye kingdom and realm
of eterne clarite / and everlasting glory: To. 6. A.
so in like manner: in the second regeneracion of this holy purpose of
religion: done we escape not only from ye darkness and danger of original
sin / but also of many other actual sins and done enter into the light of
virtue and grace / framyng our self unto the sentence of ye holy Apostle
sayng. To. 13. D.
The night of sin precessed and went before: but now the day of grace has
approached and drawn nere. yet done you byseche me to be in fourmed of a another
doubt / you ask whether the mutacion and change of the abbotte or souereyne:
may any thing help or excuse those religious persons that would change
their own monastery / that is / whether / by the death / or by the deposicio^
of the place any more liberte may be relaxed unto the subjects whereby they
might in that point and mean time time: go at more liberte whether they would
/ unto the time a another prelate were instituted and put in rowme / unto the
which I answer / Nay by no means / that is to say: they may not. For the
promise of profession / when (after the manner) it is made to the church: does
not appoint the term of the life / or for the life of the souereyne: but
rather takes testimony and wytnes: of his presence. The person that makes
profession: does make it for the time of his own life and not for the life of
any other persons. Let the person therefore take good head and mark well what
auctor and maker of ye rule did not only feel / think / or judge / but also set
forth in tradicion and rule sayng. Ca. de monachis et pegrinis.
If the professed person (says he) any time: otherwise do (that is to say)
than he has promised: let him know / that he shall be dampened of god whom he
mocketh or scornethe. And also he says / that a nouis i^ religion: may not
have power of his own body. And again he says / they must persevere and
continue in the monastery: unto death The excepcions therefore save and reserved
that in the disputacion before ben shortly concluded: it may not (from
hensforth) be lawful unto any religous person (for any occasion) before his
death: to forsake (only by his own judgment and will) the place where he was
professed. Or else if he do: he is preuaricatour and breaker of the rule /
having dampnacion / because he makes his first feyth and promise vain and
void. But yet you go forth still in question and demand / and you ask /
what and if (in case) the professed person may not or can not remain and bide
there: but with perpetual rancour and grudge of mind / because of the
election of the souereyne that was not reguler or amiable and favorable? Now
comes to mind: the answer that (in the gospel) the disciples of our lord
gave unto him when he taught the^ of the law of matrimony. If it be so sir
(said they) it is not expedient to be married. In very truth: the anguysshe is
great. For if a man should keep a wife that he hatethe: nothing is more heavy
burden. And if he should leave / and forsake her again her will and consent:
nothing is more vnchristiane or again christianite and christendom. And yet
the case is much like. For he is co^streyned and wrapped in like necessite /
that another may leave and forsake his place / lest he break hts vow / nor yet
may he remain and bide still in his place: lest he should live their with
rancour and grudge and so lose his life / what thing may I counsel this
person? Sulde I counsel him to depart and go his way? nay / that is not
lawful because of his profession. Shall I counsel him to bide still? nay / yt
is not expedient / because of his rancoure. you done here propone and put unto
me two things of like inconvenience / and of like peril and ieoparty / so yt
what so ever I answer: it may nothing profitte you For you ask of me whether
of these tweyne is more sure in conscience / for the religious person / to
remain / and bide in his proper monastery under a souereyne irregulerly and
unlawfully chosen with rancoure and grudge / or else for to live more quietly:
to deperte unto some other place / which question surely / I none otherwise
receive and take: tha^ if I were required and asked by which of these two
dethes I would counsel him to dey and peryshe: that (in case) would sle and
kill him self: by lepynge into a fire to be bre^t / or else to lepe down a
rock or some heght / and break his neck. For (in very deed) both he bre^neth
that bydeth unto hatered and rancour / and he also that breaks his vow and
purpose: does fall hedlong and break his neck. But you your own self
brethren: done lightly speed and well help me in this difficulte and hardness
of counsel / when you follow on forth / and open your mind: showing how
you would have that self thing taken and meant that you call irreguler and
unlawful / sayng i^ your question. Specially (say you) if the irregularite /
and unlawful manner of the election be so wrapped and written to gether: that
(although before god it be plain / and nothing to be douted) yet before man
(natwithstandyng) it may other scant and uneath: or else by no means: be
conuynced and reproved. Now comes unto my remembrance and mind: the goodly
sayng of the wysema^. Prou. 18.
He that will (says he) and has mind to recede and depart from his friend:
does seek occasion thereunto. By what mean done you call that election
irreguler and unlawful that can not by any reguler or lawful mean: be cassate
/ made void / or reproved. And surely we find this sentence written. That
thing that may not be proved: is unto me or unto any person: undone and without
effect. But yet you say: And how should any person be obedient unto a
souereine that is known unworthy / although not openly? Brethren: have not
you red both in your own rule / and also in the reule of truth / which is
the gospel? Upon the chair of Moses did sit scribes and pharisees: Matthew. 23.
A.
what so ever they say unto you: keep it and do it. But after their works and
deeds / do not you / ne have will to do. Now for the change or wayshynge of
your clothes / for all illusions or uncleanness: take this breue and short
counsel. I would advise every person to follow therein ye rite and custom of
his place / which in diverse monasteries: is observed and kept / in diverse
manners. Of those persons yt ben professed in many monasteries (which thing I
had nerehande forgotten to speak of) I suppose I have sufficiently answered
before wha^ I disputed and reasoned of ye stabilite of ye place / and it is not
needful I should repete ne rehearse the same. I pass over ye other questions
yt you made of the canones reules and laws both because that such things
done nothing apperteyne unto us yt ben religious persons. And also because
you may your self find the^ lightly in books if you will take ye labor to
seek therefore. Now I come unto those iii. things yt ben eftsoon contained i^
your second pistle / where first you q^stio^ and done ask what cou^sail I
would give yt person / yt were co^moued and stered unto displesure again a
another person / but not so far: yt he would do hi^ any hurt or harm hi^
self: but yet so far moved / yt he would be glad if it should hap / and
fortune hi^ by any other means to be hurt: you ask now i^ this case: whether
ye person may with good conscience / say mass or be co^muned standing yt mocion
and displeasure: or else whether he should and were bound to wtdraw hi^ self /
unto such time ye mocio^ / and displesure were rebated and swaged. I bysech our
lord / it never chance ne fortune me: to approach unto ye holy sacrifice of
peace: with any such trouble / nor with ire / or displeasure / stryft nor
disceptacio^ and co^brau^ce of mind: to touch ye holy sacrament / where
(undoubted) god him self is present / recou^s^lyng unto hi^ al ye hole world.
Certainly that oblacion or offrynge that any person does present unto our
lord: Matt. 5. D.
shall never be thankefully received except he first apeace and rest his
brother / whom he knows and remembers well: he had before (in case) grieved
and hurt. So much than the less thankful shall his offryng or deed be: if he
do not first appease and rest him self toward his neighbor. Forthermore yet
you ask a question of the contrariete that semethe to be in these two
sentences and sayng of saint Paul. The first where he says unto the
Philippenses. Nostra conuersacio in coelis est. Phillip. 3.
Our co^uersacion is i^ heaven. The second unto the Corrinthes. Quamdiu sumus
in hoc corpore: 2. Cor. 5.
peregrinamur a domino. As long as we ben in this body: we done labor in
pilgrimage absent from our lord. How may these tweyne (say you) stand to
gether? how may the soul in the same self time: both labor in body on
pilgrimage absent from our lord: and in heuines also be present with our
lord? The self Apostle: does in a another place assoyle and declare him self.
Where he says. Ex part cognoscimus, 1. Co. 13.
et ex part prophetamus. On the the one part (says he) we done know / and we
have perfect knowledge. And on the the other part: we done prophecy / that we
only believe. In that (than) that we know or have knowelege as beholding
things present: we ben than with our lord. And in that we yet here bydyng:
done prophecy / as it were of things to come / byleuyng those things that we
done not understand / and hopyng and trusting those things that we know
not: we done now labor in pilgrimage here in body as abse^t from our lord.
But when that thing shall come to pass (says he) that is perfect / that is
to say / the plenitude and fulness of glory / which shall be in the resurrection
to come: 1. Cor. 13.
than shall that thing be void and vanisshe that now is on the the one part /
that is to say / all manner of corrupcion of the body / where of (without doubt)
comes and happeth unto us / this labor on pilgrimage in the body: which
yet remains and bydeth on the the one part. And that is it that the Apostle in
him self mournyng: does miserably by wayle and say. To. 7.
O I unhappy man / who or what person shall deliver me from the body of this
death? he does not complain so much again the body / but upon the body (he
says) of this death / that is to say: upon the corrupcion of the body / that
yet indureth and lasts. Showing thereby that not the body: but that the
greues of the body / ben cause of our peregrinacion and pilgrimage. For the
body that is corrupted and wastes: is grievous unto the soul / not the body
syngly or alone of it self: Sapi. 9. D.
but the body that is corrupted does grieve the soul / by reason of the
corrupcion / so that the corrupcion of the body / is the burden / charge / and
weght of the soul: and not the nature. Whereby those persons that done mourn
/ and wayle within them self: To. S.
done desire and awayte for the redempcio^ / and not for the amission and loss
of their bodies / we therefore well and reasonably grieved by the necessite of
the body / and not by the societe and company thereof done coueyte and desire to
be desolued and loused and so to be with Christ / that the exile that yet does
remain and bide on ye the one part: should be finisshed and ended / and the
heavenly habitacion and dwelling place: that on the the other part is now bygo^ne
should be made perfect and fully accomplesshed / or else this text. Our
conversation is in heaven: may be expouned as the same Apostle says unto the
Romans. We ben (says he) made safe and put in the state of salvation: by
hope. So (than) that now we done dwell among the heavenly dweilers in heaven: by
our hope: And yet natwithstandynge / we done in very deed: labor here in
pilgrimage (for the time) upon yerth in our bodies. Or yet may this said text
our conversation is in heaven: be expouned thus / we have a cause / reason and
mean: how we may both cleue: leyne and be joined unto our bodies / and how
also we may clyue / stycfast / and be joined unto our lord / that is when we
give unto the body / fode to keep the life and the senses / and unto our lord
true feyth and love. For surely our spirit and soul is no more present where
it does give life (that is in the body) than it is: where it does love in
god. Except (peradventure) the soul were supposed and thought to be and dwell
rather where it is holden and tied by force vnwyllyngly and by necessite: than
there whether it would with most glad mind and desire be wylfully carried and
conveyed / our savior also says. Where so ever thy tresour is: there is also
thy heart. Matthew. 6.
Also sith the soul that loves god: does live of him only / and by him: as
the body does by the soul: by what reason (I pray you) may the soul be more
present where it does give life: than where and from whens it takes life? For
(certeynly) charity is the founteyne of life. And I would not say that ye soul
does live: yt does not draw and drink of ye fou^teyne. For it may by no mean
draw thens except it be present at the font and well / which is charity /
which is Christ and god hi^ self. Who so therefore do love god: is present with
god / in so much as he loves / and in yt he less loves: he is absent. And
the soul is convinced and openly proved to love god in yt the less or so
much less yt (yet for the time) it is occupied i^ the necessites and needs of
the flesh. And that occupacion of the body: is nothing else but a manner of
absence from god / and that absence: is nothing else but a peregrinacion and
pilgrimage / and so done we labor here in pilgrimage from our lord / and we
done so labor on pilgrimage in the body / by the troubles whereof: both our
intent is let / and also by the cares and business of the same body: our
charity and love is fatigate / and dwelled. In the end of your second epistle
you ask me / how I would judge or think of the understanding of this text of
the gospel. Ecce enim merces vestra: multa est in celis. Lu. 6. D.
Lo / take heed and se. For your wages and reward: is great or much in heaven.
And you meruell very much yt saint Augustyne would say upon ye same text: yt
it should not be needful to understand here these visible and corporal or
bodily heue^s / lest so our wages and reward should seem to be set and
appointed in things mouable / and slepery and uncertain. And therefore (you
think) here should some spiritual firmame^tes be understand and meant / of
the which (as you say) you can not tell nor yet suspecte: what should be
supposed or thought. But if you attend and head well what you have red. The
realm and kingdom of god: Luce. 17. Ephe. 3.
is within you / and saint Paul says / that Christ (by feyth) does dwell in
your hertes / as a king in his own realm and rule And in a another place he
says. To. 8.
The passions and pains of this time: ben nothing of dignite / degree or
worthynes ne any thing co^parable unto the glory to come / which shall be
reveled and showed in us / he says not / that shall be showed unto us / as an
outward thing / but in us / as now bydynge and dwelling within us / but not
yet apperyng. And the prophet says also: Psalm. 44. Psalm. 63.
All the glory of the kings doghter is within forth / or from within. And in
a another place man has assended unto an high heart / and mind of
contemplacion. Psalm. 83. Sapien. 7,
And yet again: man has disposed ascencions in his heart. And the wysema^:
The soul of the just person: is the seete / or stall / or syttyng place of
sapience / the voice of the which sapience: is this / heaven: is my sittyng
place. If you now take heed (I say) and note well these things and many other
like in holy scripture: Esai. 66. A
you will (in very deed) study and give diligence to seek and labor that ye
kingdom of god and his justice: may rather enter and come unto you: than that
other you should go forth outward / or else ascend and clymbe upward or
above. But I call here this terms / above / or without forth according unto the
posicion and order of the place / as the heaven: does from the yerth hold or
keep an exterior and outward place. And the son / the moon and the sterres:
done keep a superior and higher place. For those same self things that been
within us by the very subtyle and sle^der inuisibilite and vnperceyuablenes of
their nature: ben also above us by the very high dignite and degree of their
excellency. And also they ben without us: by the immensite and unmeasurable
excess of their mageste. But these things: ben very high and most high and
hard to be entreated. And therefore had they need of a more dilligent
disputacio^ and also of a more wise and better learned disputer / and yet
thereunto: of a more large work and entreaty. I had went and supposed / I
should not in the entreating of these matters: have exceded the manner of a
pistle. But (as I now se and perceive) the co^municacion and tale: has
proceeded unto more length: than I trusted or thought. Name you therefore ye work
if it so please you: a book / or if it please you: an epistle / as you will For:
whether it shulbe be / in few words or in many: I was bound (which thing I
have studied and desired) to satisfy your will and desire.

Thus ends the book of saint Bernarde of precepte and dispensacion /
translated and turned out of latyne into english: by the said brother of
Syon / apply all unto the best I byseche you / and pray for the old wreche /
Richard Whytforde.
The said wreche unto both the parties yt is to say: the souereynes and the
subjects.
I Byseche you mekely / both reverent souereines / and devout subjects:
perdone my rudenes in all / and be content I conclude unto you: 1. Pet. vlti.
Seniores ergo qui in vobis suut.
with the sentence of saint Petre / yt is / yt you both / eueryche by the^ self
and all in common: do so labor and inforse your self: that (following ye
steps of Christ) you may attain / and perfectly come unto his company / that
is / to be both together: members of hin mystical body. How be it: convenient
it is and good right and reason: yt such persons as by the auctorite of their
age / years of profession / office or dignite: been seniores in religion / and
so in rowme or place above other: that also in like manner (in the diligent
study and precise obseruaunce of the religion) they be the effectuous workers /
and laudable teachers and so very examplars of the perfection of the same. For
all the residue of the covent or company: done take form and done co^munely
follow: the examples / the doctrines and teachynges / the manners and byhauiours
/ and the auctorite of them. And therefore it is not sufficient and enough for
them / to keep them self from defaulte and offense of the religion: but that
they also study and labor with diligence to bring al ye multitude unto the
same. For ye age of the seniores: does put them in auctorite. And the use and
experience of many things: does render them prudent and wise And their
integrite and perfection of living / proved and openly known unto the company:
does put the^ in credence and trust. Unto you therefore first I speak (reverent
souereynes and seniores of religion) yt ben the kepers and gyders of the
multitude. And I humely byseche you in visceribus Christi / yt is / for the
te^derloue of our lord and savior Jesus Christ and for the bitter pains and
passion yt he suffered for you and al ma^kinde: yt you re^dre and frame your
self unto such multitude and company as (by ye ordinance of god) been put
under your gouerna^ce: very pastores / pitious and unfeigned fathers / wache and
wake / give dililige^ce and take good head / look well on every part / and take
care and thought yt your flock (for whom Christ suffered death) another lack
ne want any thing necessary for the body ne yet for ye soul / another holy
co^solacino ne wholesome doctrine and counsel / ne in any wise: the very
example of the life euau^gelical / yt is to say: ye life of our lord (...)
Jesus you be unto the^ their bysshope / and prouider / perform the^ ye effect
of ye same / feed the^ / cure the^ / govern the^ / keep the^: yt none
perysshe: none err ne stray For you shall make for eueryche of the^ a streyte
account. Ezeh. 3.
Sanguinem eius requiram de manu tua (says our lord) I shall) if any by lost)
require his blood of thy hands / that is to say thou shall dey for him. And yt
you do: do not with murmr or grudge or (as they say) with an yuell but redely /
quickly / corragiously / freely and gladly with all heart and mind / lokynge for
none orther thank ne gaynes: but only to please our lord / his rowme you keep
/ his business you do / of hi^ look for your wages. Seek no wages in this life.
For I tell you / it is a shame and rebuke: to take ye cure and charge of a
christian company: for worldly winni^g or gaynes. No man may use ye rowme with
due laud or praise: but he that does it freely without hyre. For who so lokes
for wages of this world: does utterly lose the reward of ever lastyng bless
and so is it also of the^ ye little done set by any gaynes or riches: and yet
will make means to have the honor / the dignite / the high rowme and place /
and to have pleasure to commau^de / to be worshyped and to have rule /
dominacion and governance / and therefore shall these persons have no reward
of god / because they take here their own hyre and reward. The office of a
prelate (I tell you) is far from the nature and condition of a lordshyppe.
Principes gentium dominantur eorum. etc. Matthew. 20. D.
The princes and lords of the worldly people: done take dominacion /
lordshyppe and estate over them and done accou^te their subjects: as bond
servants (says our savior unto his disciples) but among you it may not be
so / but rather contrary the prelate and souereine: must be the servant. The
office of a prelate therefore: is not a rowme of tyranny: but an administracion.
The souereyne tha^ is president and set in place above the other: not to be as
a king / and to reygne / and so to have the lucre and pleasure of the goods
and possessions / nor yet to have more liberte and ease: but rather that
(according unto the graces supposed in him / when he was elected) he should
more profytte in religion. Remember therefore the nature and condition of your
office and rowme / and whose place and person you done use (good reverent
souereynes) and so byhaue your self in all things: yt your life may: not only
unto your subjects: but also unto al christianes: by very exa^plar and form
of ye life eua^gelical let your subjects (by your manners and byhauour) learn
to despise and to set at noght al worldly lucre or aua^tage / let the^ also
learn at you to set at noght al worldly honors and dignites / and let the^
learn by you to hope and trust to have the merit / mede / and reward of al
their offices and obseruau^ces of our lord and savior Christ alone / and in
the mean time nothing to look fore nor to care fore but that the thing they
do be honest in it self and also pleasant and thankful unto our lord. Do you
therefore (reverent souereynes) your office and duete / as good shepherders:
without reward all freely / how be it in deed it shall not be fre / and without
reward that you do. For when the prince of al prelates and shepherders Jesus
Christ that did render and give him self all hole for his sheep (part whereof:
he has committed unto your governance) shall come forth and show him self
at the day appointed: than shall you (for the vile and mortal reward of your
temporal labors) receive the glorious crown of your office and rowme: set
and garnisshed with flores that never shall fade. Desire you not therefore ne
will or have appetitte: to take that thing here by your own auctorite: yt you
should tarry and look fore: of your prince and captain. Bide your time
appointed and do never present you ne teken byforehande upon that day: yt he
would / should unto al christianes be uncertain. Trust for your reward and
thanks of him only that leueth nothing unrewarded our lord god / and most
sweet savior Jesus Christ. Unto the subjects.
Now devout brethren and systers religious: I byseche you consider: how
that as unto the seniores: apperteyneth to be unto you as pituous / kind / and
loving pare^tes: So (for your part) apperteyneth unto you: by good manner and
lowely byhauiour: to submit your self in all things unto the seniores / and
in due honor and reverent love: to take and accounte them as your very
natural parents / and yet above the carnal pare^tes. So much more (because
they ben spiritual) as the soul is above the body and the spirit above the
flesh. And like as the seniores done (by evangelical charity / and for the
love of Christ) submit them self in all ministeries unto all persons: So
should you not misuse the myldnes and gentell intreates of the seniores / nor
in any wise should you take any boldness if they (for your reformacio^ and
quietude) be familier with you / and many times done suffer and bear: more tha^
byco^meth them. But rather should you be the more meke and gentell unto them in
more prompte and ready obedience: because they done not misuse their auctorite
ne presume there upon / and never should you forgette the saying of holy saint
Augustyne in his rule / that is / that you should have pity and compassion
upon their labors. Ca. vlti.
For the more high they be in rowme and auctorite: the more ben they in peril
and ieoparty / let therefore charity ben ever among you. For where charity is
present: the souereynes ben never yrke / nor weary / nor yet the subjects /
wild or vnreuly. For those persons that have the dignite: done always study
how they may profytte / and promote their children unto virtue. And the
charitable subjects done wilfully perform and do: more tha^ they ben
required / let therefore un both the parties: be kind and loving gentelnes:
mylde and lowly byhauiour That shall cause that another the seniores shall be weary
of their labor and diligence / nor the subjects be grieved with their
auctorite and gouerna^ce / our lord (I tell you) hates much a stubburne / and
self wylly heart and stomach. And he hatethe much delectacion and pleasure in
them that been meke and lowely. For unto those persons that have little trust
and small opinion in them self: does he most gladly depart his gifts of
grace. And the other that set much by him self / and that done stand well in
their own favor / does he repel and put away: as unworthy his benefits or
gifts. Those persons that done dimitte and make them low: does he conueye on
heght / and reyse up. And those that in their own minds done clymbe on heght:
does he pluck down and make low / unto the^ ye done trust i^ their own
virtues: does he disdain to give his gifts but those that nothing trust in
their own worke^ but done hang holly upon him: those does he nourysshe /
conforte / and defend. Submit you therefore (in due manner) either unto other
/ not for ye dred of man but for ye dred of god. For he has cure of you / and
does care for you / and he will not suffer you to perisshe. Youth i^ worldly
persons: is ready unto plesures / disportes / idle pastimes / and wa^tones: but
it byco^meth religious persons of every age: to be sade / sobre / diligent /
circumspecte / well ware of them self. For the great enemy / and adversary of
our salvation: does never sleep / but ever walks about / as an hongry
ravenous Lion / sykynge and spyryng where / and how he may cayche and devour
ye christian soul / and no angle ne corner leueth he vnsoght / to find an
enter among religious persons. For sometime does he craftily awayte the^ by
vain voluptuous pleasures / sometime openly assail them by troublous / and
unrestful persecucions. But give no place unto him good religous persons.
Rather withstand strongly / with hole and vnfeynted hertes. For although his
power be very great and mighty: yet is he more strong and mighty / that
has the cure of you / our lord Jesus Christ. Put your trust in him with all
your hertes: And than your adversary can nothing prevail / again them that
have faint hertes / and like trust in our lord: he is very strong / and of
great power. But again the^ that baue full feyth / and trust in god: he is
but feeble and faint. If he did pursue and assail religious persons alone: the
affliction might peradventure (in good reason) be grievous. But now that he
does (by like malice) assail all manner of persons / be they never so holy or
devout (For Christ does he pursue and assail in us) he does inuie ye soul
health of all manner of persons: we should therefore suffer and bear more
lightly ye common prosecution / affliction / and trouble of all christianes /
and (with common good wylles and hertes) stand styfly again our common enemy.
These tentacio^s and assayles: shall sone ouerpasse. For this life is not long
and yet in the mean time: our lord will not leave ne forsake us / but he that
is the mouer and gyuer of al grace and goodness: will perform in us / that he
has bygo^ne / he gave and i^spired unto us / ye mind and will of religion: yt
we should pacientely bear and suffer again for him: such pains afflictions
and troubles as might bring us unto eterne and everlasting glory / he will not
suffer us to lose our palm / and crown of victory: if we will manly fight /
and styfly stand thereby / he will be present with us / and will help us to
fight / and give us both stre^ghe and stabilite So that here for a short time
somewhat afflicted and troubled / we shall hereafter come unto the crown of
imortalite. For by his help: we done vanquyshe And by his liberallite and
goodness: we shall receive the mede and reward thereof. And therefore there is no
cause in us why we should give / think or apply any laud or praise unto our
self. For all the glory and praise is due unto our lord alone / not only in
this world: but also in all worlds for ever more. Amen. For this persent
time: I have no more to writ but that it may please you of your charity /
forgyuyng my rudnes: to pray for me unto our lord god and most sweet savior
Jesus / who send us grace and mercy ever to work his will. This have we drawn
out of the first epistle of saint Petre / the last Chapitre. your wreched
brother of Syon Richard Whytforde.

Of the second board of our vessel which is: the second membre of this
third part / that is: the second essenciall vow of religion / called
wylfull pouerte.
The preface.
WHere we (i^ the first perte of this work) did assimile religion unto a Tonne
/ or Pype / conteynyng the most delicate / and wholesome wine of the life of
perfection for the imitacion / and following of the life of our savior Christ
Jesus / and the same Tonne or Pype: to be made of.iii. tables or bordes / those
ben / the essenciall vows / and those to be closed and bound: with the hopys
/ of reules / constitucions / and statutes / and yet those hopys: to be also
bound with the wykers of the holy ceremonies / and laudable customs of
religion: we have now here sent unto you the second board / or table of the
said Pype / called wylfull pouerte. Whereof to entreat: we shall show first
our mind of the self term pouerte.

Of the self term pouerte. The first Chapitre.
FOr the self term may be taken diversely. One way: it is taken for nydenes /
want or lack of necessaries and so is it misery and wrechednes / which common
beggars / and many persons have borne / and suffered with pain and woe. Which
natwithstandyng taken patiently with laud and praise of god: may be much
meritorious. An other way pouerte may be taken for scarsity / and that thing
that is sufficient for the life of the person with hard shyfte of labor and
occupacion. And this pouerte: is a thing of great honesty / and much profyt
and avail / as well unto the wealth / and good state of the body: as unto the
quietude and rest of the mind. For what can be unto the health of the body:
better than exercise by moderate labors? whereunto pouerte does drive and in
manner constreyne: And also does teach the person to use all things gotten by
labors: discretely and moderately / and to despise all superfluite. And also
does cause persons to remember their own infirmite / from whens they came /
and how they should live by them self alone / and of them self / that is to
say: without help of all other creatures / only by ye grace and help of god
/ and so does it also move the^ to despise al delicates / and does show and
teach al persons: what is very riches / that is to say: such as thieves can
not stele / ne tyrannes rob / nor that may lightly be lost. And yet is not
this pouerte meritorious: except it be wylfull / without force. And
interprised / taken and suffered (as after we shall show) for the love of god.
For the wylfull forsakynge of worldly riches and goods: does not cause the
merit / but the end / purpose / the intent / and cause why the goods ben
forsaken: is the cause of merit. For paganes / gentyles / philosophers / and
other infideles: have clean forsaken the world / and all the riches and
pleasures thereof / because they might be void of the cares / business / and
turmoyles of the world and so to be at more quietude / rest / and liberty of
mind: to study in the learning / and exercise of all sciences / and moral
virtues. Wherein they did meruelously increase / and were much excellent. And
yet although this manner of pouerte be good / honest / and laudable / yet
because (as I said) infideles may be of this pouerte: it is not meritorious.
But when a person / without any forse / co^pulsion / or need: does (of self
election) wylfully chose pouerte / and clearly forsake the world / dispisyng
utterly all the riches / goods co^modites / and pleasures of the world / and
ye will / mind apptite / and desire thereof: unto ye end / purpose / and
i^te^t: not only to be void / discharged / and perceles of al cares / busynes
/ co^brau^ce / and turmoyles of ye world / but also to be at q^etude / rest /
and liberte of heart and mi^de / to serve god / and so does firmly appoi^t and
determine / and also does apply / dedicate / and bind himself holly unto ye
service of god i^ ye same and i^ continual prayer / co^te^placio^ / meditacio^
/ and spiritual / or holy exercises: tha^ is wylful pouerte not only / good /
honest / and laudable: but also much meritorious. And yet may pouerte thus
taken: be diverse: in manner and perfection. For some persons have enterprysed
/ and taken this pouerte in so precise manner / yt nothing they would have of ye
world: but only a skarce living / and yt gotten by their own loboures alone
/ as we have of saint Paul / and of many other i^vitas patru^ and i^ yt
colacio^s of holy fathers. Some other yet lived more streytly / by only herbs
/ rotes / and such as they fo^de without labors / as saint Io. baptiste And
some / persone^ have sold their goods and lands / and made all commune / and
so did they live with other persons / as in the beginning of the church: the
people did live under the Apostles. Some other did live / and yet done live /
i^ common in two manners. Some without lands / possessions / or bodily
labors / or yet any certain provision: only upon alms / as the freres of
all orders / specially: the obseruauntes of saint Franciskes reule. And some
other done live in common upon the goods of a monastery / other gotten / by
common labors / or else upon lands and possessions / wherewith the monastery
/ is endowed. Of this pouerte / so to live in common: is our matter at this
time. For of such persons / that i^ time paste: have lived by the only
provision of god. As the children of Israel in deserte. Helyas fed by ye Rauyn
/ and by the Angel / and Mary Magdalene with many other: we will not speak /
nor yet of the other pouertes before rehearsed.

Of monastical pouerte / as it is the second essenciall vow. The second.
Chapitre.
But here done we entreat of that pouerte only / that stands in forsakyng
the world (as we said) to be at liberte to serve our lord / after the
example of our savior Jesus / and to be of the nombre of them that he called
blessed / sayng in the gospel. Beati pauperes spiritu, Matthew. 5. A. Lu. 6. C.
Quonia^ ipsorum est regnu^ celoru^. That is: Blessed ben those persons yt ben
pore in spirit / in the holy ghost / pore for the love of our lord: for the
kingdom of heaven is theyrs / and does apperteyne unto them as their proper
heneritau^ce. And yet although the persons of this pouerte done (as is said)
for god forsake the world / yet may they live in common by the goods of the
world. Whether they take the^ of gift or in alms / or whether they get the^
by labors / or whether they been provided for by lands / rentes / or
possessions. For the fruit of this pouerte (as is said) is to be void of
worldly cares. And to be at liberte to follow Christ and so done the covent in
every religion. And although the souereine / and the officers done seem to be
occupied sometime with worldly business: yet because / it is for the provision /
and needs of the coue^t: it is a spiritual busynes / and charity with
obedience in them: does supply the quietude of mind / and ye duete of
religion / which the covent does execute and fulfill / and so ben they all of
like merit and perfection.

Of the profitte of this pouerte. The third Chapitre.
THis manner of pouerte to live thus in common: is much commendable and
greatly conducible / profitable and helping / unto the increace of virtue /
good manners and perfection. For our savior Jesus him self: was of this pouerte
/ and his disciples / as does appear i^ the gospel / in that he had a common
purse. Io. 12. A. and 13. C.
Whereof the traitor Judas was berer. And because he was not content with that
manner of living i^ common / but would have propriete: he lost grace / and
finally fell into everlasting dampnacion. Where the other Apostles content to
follow their master: did all live i^ common / and taght al their disciples
christianes so likewise to do / as does appear in the acts of the Apostles.
Ca. 4.
Whereby we may conclude for a troth: that (after ye perfection of very
christianite) this manner of pouerte: is most nere unto the pouerte of Christ
and so to be singular merit / among other pouertes. Antoninus 4. part.
For the most nyde and paynful pouerte (although wylfully taken) is not ye
best meritorious pouerte / as to live with out any worldly provision / except it
were enterprised and undertaken by reuelacio^. For it were rather persu^pcion /
tha^ perfection: for any person to wtdrawe wilfully from himself: ye
necessary suste^tacion of his natural life / except ever (as I said) reuelacion.

How Christ our savior did begin this pouerte. The fourth Chapitre.
THis wylfull pouerte: did our Savior Christ express and set forth / in his
own life. For he being lord of all the world / was borne pore / and brought
up and nourysshed porely / and in all the process of of his life: he was pore.
For (as he said him self) he had not (as they say) an hole to hyde in his head
/ ne any thing proper as his own. Matthew. 8. C.
And at the last: he deyed / al naked and bare. Whereby does appear: that he
well approved and loved pouerte / as the very path and most right way unto
perfection. And so he said himself i^ ye gospel / wha^ a young man came unto
hi^ / and asked hi^ / what he might best do or what way he might take / most
surely to be saved he answered / yt to observe and keep ye co^ma^deme^tes / of
ye law should be sufficient for his salvation. Matthew. 19. C.
But if thou will be perfect: go thy way / and sell al thou have / and come and
follow me i^ ye path of pouerte / and thou shall have tresor and riches i^
heaven. Whereby does plai^ly apper that ye right way unto perfection: is pouerte
/ and ye most ready mean to have riches i^ heaven: is to be pore upon yerth yet
syrsay you: every man is not bound unto ye perfection For our savior said it
should be sufficient for our salvation: to keep ye perceptes and co^ma^deme^tes
of ye law. Si qs vult post me venire, Ca. 14.
et no^ odit patre^ et matre^, et vxore^ et filios, fratres et sorores, ad huc
aute^ et ai^am sua^: no^ potest meus esse discipulus. That is. If any person
have mind / desire / and will / to follow and to come after me: And does not
first hate or loath / ye carnal affection / of his father and mother and of his
wife and children / and of his brothers and systers / and yet over all this: of
his bodily life: he can not by my disciple i^ ye perfection of pouerte. Here
may you se yt these perfection of pouerte: is not a co^ma^deme^t / but a co^sayl
For both these textes be^ co^dicionalles. If thou will be perfect / and if any
person will follow me / and yet i^ both ye textes does follow yt those yt will
follow unto perfection: must first forsake ye world. No person is bound. I
grant well But yet every person byware how they don entprise. How they don
promise or take upon the^ this counsel. For if a person be not bound by
obligacio^ of writi^g or promise: he need nothing to pay ne any thing does he
offend: i^ yt he does not acco^plesshe ye co^sayle. Whereunto he is exorted and
moved But when he has entreprised and taken in hand the counsel: than (at
the leest) it is a rebuke for him to go back. But if he do wylfully (at the
mocion) bind him self by obligacion and promise of solemn vow unto the
counsel than is the counsel changed into bond / and the liberte: unto
necessite. For now must he need / by the reason of the promise and bond:
accomplysshe and fulfill that was counsayled / or else shall he offe^de / and be
worthy pain and punisshement. For our savior says. Lu. 9. G.
Nemo mittens manum ad aratrum, et respiciens retro: aptus est regno dei. No
person (says he) that does enterprise / take in hand / and promise to follow
and keep the cou^sayles of the gospel / and afterward does look back / fle
therfrom / and forsake the entreprise: may be an apt and mete convenient
person to enter into the kingdom of heaven. Psalm. 75, and Iosu. 2. D.
And holy scripture t a another place says. If thou make a vow: look thou
render and perform the same.

How this pouerte was kept in the beginning of the church. The.v. Chapitre.
Wherefore we done read / that many holy fathers / having great desire unto
perfection of this counsel: did entreprise and take upon them to follow the
same / with out any vow / bond / or promise. So that if they look back / and
went therfrom: they had no pain / but only the shame / and rebuke of their
entreprise. And yet did they in that time: make many statutes and streyt
ordinances / for the perfourmau^ce of their entrepryse / to exclude utterly al
manner of propriete / and to follow the manner of the Apostles / all to live in
common / as does appear by saint Johan Cassian in his book of the collacions
of the old fathers / specially in the fourth book. Io. Cassia^.
Ca. 6.
De institutis renunciancium. That is: of the statutes and ordinances of such
persons / as did that time forsake the world. And in the.vi. book of ye
spirit of avarice. Where they ordoned: 4. libro. Ca. 13.
not only yt no person should have any thing proper: but also yt no person
should name / or call any thing mine or thine / as my mantell my veyle / thy
book / thy tables / or any other like thing / out always our book / our hand.
etc. For mine or thine: ben words of propriete / which in ye mouth of a
religious person: was among the^ abomination. They ordened also / that no
person should have in proper use any thing that they send into the monastery
before their enter. Nor yet yt they / brought with them. Nor that were given /
or sent unto them from the world. Ne that thing another: that they yerned / or
gate by any labor in the monastery. And yet above all this / that is more
precise: Ibidem.
No person should use any thing in any manner of singularite / as to mark any
thing with any proper mark as apperteinyng unto this / or that person. Nor to
put any thing under lock and key. Nor yet to lay or set any thing / in any
priuey place for their own use / or from the common use of other persons.
Nor any thing to use in any manner: without knowledge and license of the
souereyne. Alas good religious persons. What shall we say of our self and
think. Sith they without promise or vow: did so streytly keep and follow
their entreprise / and purpose with out violacio^ or offense. And we: that have
not only enterprised / bygonne / and taken in hand this perfection or poverty:
but also have in the face of the church openly promised and professed / unto
our lord god / his blessed mother / and unto all saints / specially the
patrons of our religion. And unto our prelates on their byhalfe / and that by
solemn vow.

The holy sacrament of Christ's blessed body and sacred blood thereupon
received: firmly to observe / keep / and perform / that holy counsel / and
perfection of wylfull pouerte / unto the vttermuste of our power / continually:
during our life. Alas (I say) what may we (so bound) suspecte and dread of our
self. Sith in diverse monasteries we done se and perceive: that some persons
professed / have ordened things for their own private use: Ibidem. Ca. 15.
before they were professed / some after: done procure for their own ease and
pleasure / severally to be used: many things and lock them fast / or hyde for
the^ self alone. And if by chance any of their fellows hap to find / and
for a need do use that thing / that so they have appointed for the^ self /
tha^ will they anon be moved disconte^t / and angry therwt / and sometime take
it from the^ by violence / or without any charitable or good religious manner. And
yet forther peradventure chyde / brale / and speak such words as should
never pass a religious mouth. I fere much surely and dred: lest many
professed persons / done by such means fall into the danger of ye most
perilous pestilence / and most deep da^pnable sin of propriete For in yt
time they took and did account the goods of the monastery: Ibidem. Ca. 20.
as consecrate goods unto our lord. And therefore to be used with all due
reverence. To be used: not at pleasure and self will: but for very and
unfeigned need. And always by the knowledge / and license of the souereyne. For
that thing yt were not nedeful: should no person use by any license. And yet
ever (as I said) they should use all things with reverence. For in yt time: they
did use and entreat the goods of the monastery with such reverence: yt if any
person: did break / lose / or yet misintreate / any goods of the monastery
/ they should have marvelous great rebuke / and streyt punisshement. Ibidem.
And yt for a thing of little price or small value. For there is showed / what
rebuke an officer / and religious person of a monastery had / for losi^g of
three graynes of otemele / yt by negligence did ouerfall hi^ as he brought
otemele unto ye pot. Such rebuke and penance had he: as we now would think
rygorous to be given / for the losyng of an ox / or certain no^bre of bestes.
Hereby may we take: that nothing in any monastery: should be reserved unto the
proper use of private person. For no person in the monastery professed / may
have any manner thing in any wise / or form in propriete. Yet may the self
monastery all holly to gether have propriete. Antoninus 4. pte ti. 12. Ca. 4.
For all the lands possessions and other goods of the monastery done
apperteyne unto the hole monastery: as proper / to be (natwithstandyng)
divided and ministered by the souereynes / or officers unto the professed
persons / and unto eueryche of them / not unto any proper or certain use: but
unto the very / and unfeigned need of the persons. So (natwithstandynge) that
not only the self thing: but also the use of every thing be ever unto every
person (as much as is possible) at vncerteynte / always at the will and
discrecion of the souereyne / ever to be used in the most commune convenient
manner. And this manner manner of use and form of priuite: is affirmed for the
most holy and most high perfection of poverty / because it is most like
unto the life of heaven. Beda super act. 4.
Where all things been and shall be most hyghly and generally common. For god
ts and ever shall be al / in all. And also because that our savior / and all
his Apostles: were of that form and manner of living And therefore many
persons and nerehande al christianes in the first beginning of the church:
did use and keep the same manner / in so much that in some one monastery:
were. M. persons or mo. And this was general: through all christian lands
in every region and country. And every where did they observe and keep the
statutes / and ordinances of this perfection in most precise and streyte
manner / utterly excludyng al manner of spices / kinds and co^tenaunces of
propriete. And yet (as we said before) they were not bounden thereunto / but
only followed that manner: of devotion and fre will / without profession or
promise.

How this pouerte came unto bond and vow. The.vi. Chapitre.
But after when perfection began to decay: some persons willing ye same
manner to continue: did precribe and ordeyne certain rules / and firm statutes
/ which many did receive / and wylfully did bind them self perpetually to
keep / and form the same / of the which rules: 18. q. 2. perni ciosam.
three were first received and approved by the church / and so incorporate in
the law. That is to say: the rules of saint Bastle / saint Augustyne / and
saint Benedicte / and after them was also the rule of saint Franciske received
/ and approved of the church i^ like manner. So that now all persons that
done wylfully profess the esse^cialles after any of the said rules: ben under
pain of deedly sin: bound to observe / and keep the same / at the leest as
unto the said esse^cialles / that is to say / these three vows obedience /
wylful pouerte / and chastity. Sith than for the guard / and sure keeping of
this second vow of wylfull pouerte: all this said rules have ordened the
disciples of the same: to live all in common / excludynge utterly al manner of
propriete / singular / private / and certain use of any thing temporal: the
same disciples tha^ professyng the same rules: must needs / and as their duete
keep their bo^de and promise: under the said pain of deedly sin. And that
the said fathers have so ordened: does appear i^ their rules. Basilius.
Saint Basyle says in ye fourth Chapitre of his rule. In multis vtile esse
video uita^ co^munem ducere. etc. That is. I do perceive (says he) that to
live all in common among such persons as have taken that way of living: is
for many things: profitable. And i^ the next chapitre after he does exclude
propriete. Augu. ca. 1. regule.
And saint Augustyne in the first chapitre of his rule: says. Hec ^gitur sunt.
etc. We therefore (says he) done command and charge all you that been
constituted / set / and ordered in the monastery: that ye observe / and keep
these things yt done follow. First that ye abide / and dwell in your house
qietely / restfully / and agreeable to gether in all things. Basili. ca.
regule. 2.
For thereunto ben you gadred to gether i^ one coue^t. And yt you have in our
lord: one heart / one will / and one mind. And yt ye another name ne call any
thing properly your own / but that all things be unto you common. Ibidem.
Ca. 5.
And that all things that ye have / as meat drink / and clothing: be
distributed / divided / assigned / or appointed unto eueryche of you / by your
souereyne. And the same thing in sentence: have both the other rules. For
saint Benedicte in the.xxxiii. Chapitre of his rule: says. Precipue hoc vicium
radicitus amputetur. etc. Benedictus in regula. ca. 13.
Let this vice of propriete (says he) be kytte away / and plucked up clean by
the rotes / so that no persons in the monastery: do presume any thing to
give or receive: without the license of the souereyne. Nor yet to have any
thing proper / no I say / no manner of thing / another book / nor tables / nor
yet a pencyl to write with / nor yet (I say utterly) no manner of thing. For
another their bodies nor their wylles be in their own proper power / but all
things common. Franciscus in regula. ca. 6.
And saint Fra^ciske in his rule the.vi. Chapitre: does also prohibit all
manner of propriete.

Of the understanding of saint Augustines reule as unto this purpose. The.vii.
Chapitre.
But because I write unto you principally that been of saint Augustines rule I
would you noted of the foresaid text four points / that done natwithstandyng
apperteine unto all religious persons according unto the example of the holy
Apostles. For so did they live after the Ascencion of our savior / unto such
time as they were commanded by the holy ghost (grace received) to depart in
sonder / and to make open the law of Christ's gospel. The first note than is /
that the covent should bide / and dwell to gether in one house. Wherein: many
religious person (after my pore mind) done much amys. Specially the
souereynes / hedes / and officers of some monasteries / that done lie at
graunges / lodged / or other places from the covent / which thing seems plain
again that point of the rule / and very much inconvenient and vnaccordyng /
except they account them self / as none of the covent / or else some lawful
necessite do cause them so to do. For I can not judge lawful for the^ to be
from the covent: but only for very and unfeigned necessite other in the^ self
by syckenes / disease / and other like things / or else for the necessite of
the monastery / wha^ they ben forth in ministry. For within ye monastery /
they should never be from the covent / at mele times / ne yet lie out of the
dortoure but as other of the covent for syckenes. In the firmary. For sith they
ben professed unto the same rule as depely as any of the couente: they must be
one of them / and yet more streytly bound to keep ye rule most precisely:
because they ben souereynes and gyders of ye covent / and must make a count
for all the covent. Alas / how shall they make account for the^ / and be not
co^uersau^t with the^ / ne done know what they do? it is not well. The second
note of ye said text: is / that all the coue^t / should be of one heart / one
mind / one affection / and one feeling / and assent of our lord. So were the
disciples of our lord Jesus The holy scripture unto wytnes / sayng in the acts
of the Apostles. Multitudinis credencium: erat cor vnum, et ai a vna in dn^o.
That is: Ca. 4.
the multitude and company of christianes / yt by ye preaching of ye Apostles:
did believe and had feythe in our lord: was all of one heart / one affection /
one love / one mind / one felyng / and understanding i^ our lord. By which
sentence is al parcialite excluded. Wherein those religious persons done
offe^de / yt done draw together in co^uenticles / and priuey corners / to
clater and talk / and specially words of detractiu^ / making of discord /
disce^cion and debate / and such as ben co^brouse and unrestful in the
company. The third point notable of the said sentence: 3. Cassianus li. 4. ca.
13. de just. re.
is / that no person in the monastery: should name or call any thing their
own / much more should they tha^ / nothing have as their own. For so (says
the rule) done we read in the acts of the Apostles. / Erant illis omnia
co^munia. 4. F.
That is to say: All things were unto them common. This point: is slakly
kept / in many monasteries. Where some persons have cofers / or chistes
locked / and therein money / gold and silver / cups / masures / pieces / saltes
/ spones / and other plate of silver / gylt / and gold / and in their houses
(for I speak not of their selles / where they come most seldom) But in their
parlores / and offices or private places / hangynges / payntynges / and
apparelles / fedderbeddes and tapettes with such other / more like gentylles
than very christianes / and nothing like unto religion / clean without
perfection. And all these have they privately / and singular unto the^ self /
that the covent has not / ne any use thereof / ne conforte to thereby.

Which things: they do not only call their own: but also done reke^ /
account / and take such things as verily their own proper things. So yt if
they were taken from the^ / or they let / or forbeden to use them at their
own pleasure: they would grudge / and think / or say verily they had wrong.
And in all the time / they nothing done regard the defouling / blotting and
defacyng of their holy professed rule. The fourth point of the said text
much notable: is / yt all things in the monastery: 4.
should be ministered and delivered unto the covent / and unto every person of
the coue^t by the souereynes or their officers according unto the need of the
person. Which point was taken out of the rule of the Apostles / as appears
in the acts / where is said. Diuidebatur vnicuique, In act. ca. 4.
prout cuique opus erat. That is: The goods were divided unto every person:
as unto eueryche was needful. This point (after my reason) is full yuell kept.
For in the most part of all monasteries / as well of me^ as women: every
person professed of the coue^t: has a certain su^me of money appointed for
their stipende / wherewith to provide eueryche for the^ self all necessaries /
of habites / ary / and such other except co^uentuall fare of meat and drink
and such general things. And this seems unto me (without excuse) very
propriete. And directly again all the rules / which propriete: the old
fathers: yt (as I said) did not bind the^ self unto the contrary: Cassianus
li. 7. de spu^ phila. ca. 18.
had / natwtstandyng in abhominacio^ / as a pestilence / and destruction of all
good religion / and a let and hyndrau^ce of all virtues / good manners / and
spiritual profittes. And as a thing more ieoperdous / or perilous: than
disobedience / or fornicacion. For unto them (as to other sins) we have a
prouite / and natural disposicion / yt does move and assail us wtinforth but
this most da^pnable propriete: Ibidem. Ca. 1.
is without us / and by the mocion of the outward sense: does assail: and
entice the mind unto avarice / and da^pnable covetousness. And therefore in yt
it is an outward mocion: it may the more lightly be resisted and withstand:
tha^ any other sin at ye first time. But and it have enter into the mind and
soul / and by affecte and deliveracion / be ones wylfully admitted: Ibidem.
ca. 6.
tha^ does it cleue / and stick so fast: ye welnere impossible is to remove it
/ ye rote re^neth so far and so deep into the heart and affection: yt it
occupies the hole person / and so is most hard to be eradicate / vnrote^ /
and clean weded out. For wha^ al other sins done begin to decay / faint /
and fade / in man by nature: tha^ does covetous / this serpent of propriete:
Ibidem. ca. 1. 1. Ti. 6.
begin to florysshe / spring / and newly to grow. And therefore / no sin
is more again nature / tha^ it. And saint Paul does call it the rote of all
yuelles / and the bondage or thraldom of ydoles.

Of this pouerte after the institucio^ and ordinance of the church. The.viii.
Chapitre.
Which thing our mother holy church well perceyuyng / and consyderyng:
has in diverse manners / ordained under great paynest yt no religious person
/ shall i^ any wise have any manner of propriete. In the third book of ye
decretales. De statu monacoru^. Ca. Monachi. is contained in sentence. Qui
peculiu^ habuerit. etc. thus englesshed / what so ever religious person: has
/ or does reteyne in proper possession / or unto his own use / by any means:
any manner of thing: except yt thing yt by the souereyne is permitted / or
enjoined for common ministracion / or office appointed: let ye religious
person be removed from the communion of the altar / that is to say / from ye
receyuyng of ye sacrament. And if at ye time of death / any such religious
person be found with any propriete / and has not done due penance therefore:
let none oblacio^ be done ne any prayer be made for hi^ / nor yet he have his
burial / sepulcre / or grave: among ye other religious person. And this (says
the pope there) done we command of al religious persons / to be observed and
kept. And ye souereyne yt does not with diligence / cure and head well these
things: let hi^ know for certeinte / yt he has offended unto ye
preuaricacio^ / and losing of his office and rowme. And again i^ yt same book
and title. Ca. cu^ admonasteriu^. says ye pope i^ ye person of ye church.
Prohibemus districcte i^ virtute sa^cte obedie^cie. etc. We done prohibit /
and streytly forbede (says he) in ye virtue of holy obedience / under ye
attestacio^ / and record of ye judgment of god yt no religious person have
reteyne / or keep i^ possession / by any manner of mean: any thing proper. And
if (by case) any religious person have any such thing proper: let hi^ forthwt
resign it / and utterly discharge hi^ self thereof. And if ever after ye time:
he be found / and proved to have again any manner of propriete: let hi^ (after
reguler / and due warnyng) be expelled / and put out of ye monastery / never
after any more to received / except he do penance according unto reguler
discipline / all this says the said law Instead of ye which / expulsio^ /
and puttyng out of the monastery: is now enjoined / in all monasteries: ye
pain of inprisoneme^t / there to remain / unto ye time / yt ye person be
proved worthily penitent. After the said text of ye law: does i^mediatly
follow. And if in or at the death of any religious person: he be found with
any manner of propriete: let the same proper thing / in sign and token of
perdicion / and everlasting dampnacion: be with the same person / buried in
the dounghyl / or mouckhepe / as saint Gregory in his dialoges says he did him
self. 4. Dialo.
And in the same Chapitre at the end does follow. And let no souereyne think
/ trow / or suppose / that he may dispense by any means with any subject: to
have / retain / or keep any manner of propriete. For ye auoydau^ce of
propriete: is / as the possession of chastity so annexed and knyt unto ye rule
of a religious person: that contrary thereunto the pope him self may not give
license / ne dispense therewith. And in the next chapitre except one before
this said thapitre i^ the same book / and title. Ca. Super quoda^. the pope
does determine / that every such religious person / as after lawful warnyng
be found / and proved at his death or after death / with any manner of propriete
/ yt not only he is unworthy or not worthy christian burial: but also / that
(if it might be without notable great slander) he should (though he were
buried) be taken up again / and cast out of the church / and out of all holy
/ or hallowed ground. Many other streyt determinacio^s ben made in the law:
again propriete.

Of the mysuse of these laws and ordinances of of the church. The.ix.
Chapitre.
ANd yet al is to little / or at the leest does little avail. For few
monasteries shall ye find / or yet here tell of in England: yt ben clean
void / and done precisely live without propriete. For other the professed
persons brethren or systers / have (as I said before) stipende celary or
wages / that is / a certain su^me of money deputed / appointed / and delivered
unto their own hands custody / and disposicio^ therwt to provide for the^
self array and to bye al necessaries / and use al at their own will / and
pleasure / sell again or change ye things boght after their mind / and do
therwt what they will / as le^de and borowe / play for money at al manner of
games / decyng / cardyng bouli^g. etc. and sometime at worse or more
inco^uenie^t thing. And in some monasteries the brethren done wryt / lumyne /
paynt / make clauicordes / and such other labors / and take all the gaynes
unto them self. And the systers i^ other places done sow / brawdre / weue /
and make sylke werkers / teach children / take sogiournau^tes to board as ale
wives done in the contre / and done inioye the gaynes thereof / and use the
money as they will. And by reason thereof in their firmary / a place ordened for
seek persons: they done receive gestes / eat and drink with them / common
and speak / and make good chere sing and laghe / play and sport / and be as
merry as lay people / which thing is much vnaccordynge unto their state and
does nothing agree with religious perfection. And is also again their rule and
profession.

Of the common excuse of them that have not ne yet ben well wyllyng to keep
precisely the rule. The.x. Chapitre.
HEre now must I put you in remembrance of their excuse and defense / which
is (as they say) the license of the souereyne. And in very deed many of the^
ben thereby much and sore deceived. For many subjects done think verily they
be discharged clearly in conscience: wha^ they have license of the souereynes
so to use the money received and gotten as before is said / as though the
souereyne might give the^ such license. For they done believe: the souereyne
has power to give that license / and therein (I say) they ben deceived. For of
truth and sure certente: they have no such power / ne may give any such
license. Will you have a sure proof thereof? take heed what the pope says in
the law before rehearsed.

Wylfull pouerte void of all propriete / is (says the pope) in lybe manner as
is chastity: so annexed / knyt / and joined unto the rule of religious
persons: that contrary thereunto: the pope him self may not give license / ne
dispense therewith. How than may the souereyne give that license: that the
pope may not give? No man will grant that the souereine may dispense / or give
license unto the subject to abuse the body / and to break chastity. Sithe
tha^ all three vows / obedience / pouerte / and chastity / ben of like
strength and state in all religious persons: no power may dispense with one:
more than with an other. For no person making solemn vow by profession:
may be without any of them. For they been essencialles. So that one may
nothing avail without the other tweyne / ne tweyne without the third. For in
all solemn professions: they must all three be knytte and joined to gether as
one. Let never than the religious person be so diceyued: to say or think:
that the license of the souereyne is sufficient to discharge concience / in
that thing / nor yet any other thing / that the souereynes may not lawfully do
them self. For such license: is but a color and cloak of dampnable
propriete. And yet would never the pope have prohibit / and forboden such
license: except the souereynes: by ignorant or blind presumpcion: might or
had unlawfully taken upon them to give such unlawful / and dampnable license.
Here ye must take good head unto the subtyle reasons / that (as I have herd)
many persons done make in this byhalfe. in money plate / or other goods / and
of their dettes other to be paid or to be received. And those that have keys
of offices: to deliver them for the time / and sone after to receive al again
under a new license / and go forth as they did before into more sin and
more deep danger. For after the mind and writing of the reverent father and
doctor Johannes tritemnius an abbotte: they ben all excommunicate and
accursed. And for a certeynte / that is troth / in such places that done
exercise and continue that custom that he speaks of. For he says yt the
abbottes / prelates / and souereynes in diverse in diverse places of religion:
done every year at two solemn times: openly curse all religious proprietaries.
And there: therefore they must need be excommunicate / for in deed / the
souereynes of religion: have power by the common law so to curse. Ex. de
offici. ordina. Ca. ab ecclesiastic. et de symonia Ca. sicut tuas.
And therefore take this for a plain conclusion of truth / that the souereyne
has no power to give that license and libertes of such private and self
ministracions as ben used in many monasteries or rather mysused.

And so is that excuse all void / deceyuable / and a dampnable blyndnes / to
say / my souereyne does dispense with me / my souereyne does give me license /
I do nothing but after my souereynes mind and will / whereunto: I am professed
/ my souereine must answer for me / I trust I am so discharged in conscience
/ well say I / this must I need grant for a troth / that the souereyne
must answer for the subject. But I will not grant that the commandment /
or the license of the souereyne / may discharge the subject in conscience / ne
yet excuse the subject from si^ne and the pain thereof / except that
commandment and license: be lawful / and in the power of the souereyne. But
(as is said) no souereine / nor yet the pope him self: may give license / that
any religious person professed by solemn vow: may have or use any propriete.

What is meant by this term propriete. The.xi. Chapitre.
ANd what sir (say they) done you call propriete? What thing is that propriete
(For so they speak co^munely and done write that word / that I write / and
call propriete) tell us what thing it is / what you mean thereby / and how we
may know or conjecture: when we done fall in what propriete is.
After the mind of ye said abbotte doctoure tritemnius. Propriete is the
possession of any substance / or of any thing temporal that any religious
person has in his own custody or keeping / or yet in the keeping of any other
person / or persons unto the end / purpose / or intent: to have / to use /
and to enjoy that thing for his own self co^modite / profit / pleasure or
ease / and yt whether it be with license / or without license. And the great
clerk Antonine in his su^ma says. That when any person spiritual or temporal
has fre liberte and power / and so: may (with license or without license)
alien any manner of thing temporal / yt is to say / make exchange of any
thing temporal / bye or sell and give one thing for his one self profecte or
pleasure: tha^ (says he) has that person propriete. For how by reason may
any manner of person in this world: have / call or account any thing more
properly his own: than when he has power and liberte to use / or to do with
all what he will. And yt (I say) whether so ever he have license or no
license. For the license there is void / and (as they say) stands in no
stead. But as a man might give a poor man a penny / and than give him license to
do therewith what he would / or thought best.

This liberte and possession in temporal persons: is lawful / but in
religious persons (as does appear in the law before alleged) it is dampnable.
Now look well hereupon / and ye shall find more clear than the son beam:
that all such religious persons / as done take stipendes / wages / celary /
gifts / gain / rewards or alms / by the^ self / and for them self: ben
very proprietares / whether they have license or none. For (as I said) that
license: is void and of none effect. For the love of our lord / I beseech you
look well upon the very / and reasonable truth of this matter. And never leyne
/ ne take defense: of any license / ne yet of any custom. Which many persons
done allege for their discharge / saying this is the custom of our place /
and we do no other: than all have done before us / from the beginning of our
foundation / and god forbede that all these good ancient fathers or mothers /
and many that were known / for good virtuous persons of perfect and holy
life: should do so far amys as you write / we do not believe your writing: so
well as their workynge: we will go forth after our beginning / say what ye
will. These words / or such other like: have many times ben spoken unto me.
But I ever make answer: that no custom may prescribe / pruayle nor yet
discharge conscience again truth / and the right law. I say therefore unto
you / put away / lay on part / and utterly forsake all these excuses. And
apply your self with diligens / and hole heart to follow the promise and
solemn vow of your profession. And mark and note well the self words /
letter / and the mind or intent of your reule / and there shall ye find in
plain text without any gloss: that no religious person: should another name
ne call / any manner of thing te^porall: mine or thing. Nor to make any quarrel
or claim any right (by any mean) or reason: unto any manner thing / as
apperteynyng unto him self alone / but that all things should be mere / and
most indifferently common. So that every person should have that were
necessary / not of self provision: but ministered / delivered / assigned / or
appointed by the souereyne or the officers. And yet have therein no propriete:
but only the use thereof / and yet that use: at vncerteinte / remain / ever
and hangyng: in ye will / judgment / and discrecion of the souereyne. So that if
ye subject reteyne or use any thing that he is not in will to resign and
render at the precepte or commandment of the souereyne: that subject is a
proprietarie / if the said thing may be rendered.

Of the causes or occasions of propriete. The.xii. Chapitre.
How for the second / that is / of the causes or occasions of this perilous
pestilence of propriete. We done find: these stipendes / gifts / gaynes / and
such other (as before we have proved to be propriete) have been caused /
sometime: by the default of the souereynes. And sometime: by the default of the
subjects. In the souereines in two manners / one: by reason of parcialite.

Which in a souereyne is a great blotte / a great / and one of the greatest
default / and much odious and hateful both unto god and man. P. al. 118.
Iniquitatem odio habui, et abhominatus sum, et iniquos odio habui.

Says the prophet: that is: I have (says our lord) had perfectly / and
utterly in hatred and abhominacion: all iniquite and also all unjust / and
parciall persons / most than the souereynes above other / because they done
represent / and use the person of our lord god and savior Jesus. Which (by
the testimony of his enemies) was clear void and parteles of parcialite. When
the souereyne tha^: by reason of blood / birth / kynred / by request of
states or friends / or yet by carnal flesshly and folysshe affection / or
(that is worst of all) for the love and pleasures of riches / gifts / rewards
or any temporal co^modite: does ministre things necessary / as fode /
clothing / and such other: not indifferently / but unto them so favored: more
in qua^tite / or better in qualite / without any evident cause / but only of
the self appetite / affection / and pleasure of the souereyne which in the
same souereyne (as after shall be showed) is verey propriete: than have the
residue of the covent or some of them: taken occasion thereat / and murmured or
grudged therewith / and so have desired license / to have a certain su^me of
money appointed / and to have / and receive the gifts / and rewards of their
temporal friends / and to inioye and use at liberte: the gaynes of their own
labors / therwt to provide for them self: as they saw and perceived their
company were provided fore / which license the souereynes have permitted / and
granted although unlawfully. For (as oftymes is said) they have none such
power / yet (I say) they done grant and suffer it / for very nygardy / or
avarice / which is an other occasion / and cause of the said propriete. And
yet done they call that nygardy: frugalite and good housbondry. Because they
have proved by experience: that less money is spended by that means / and the
officers also have less cares / and labors by ye stipendes: than by common
provision. But in very deed and in effect they so do: because they: that is ye
self souereynes: may without grudge: have and use propriete them self. For
though they would say / they nothing intend / mean / or purpose any such
cause: yet does the effect so follow in deed. For they done spend the
residue of the goods of ye monastery after their own mind / will / and
appetite / and so done they suffer the officers to do with that remains of
their offices / as though the goods of the monastery were their proper
goods. And so done they dispense with them self to be proprietaries. Where
(if they were duly professed) they ben as depely bound unto wylfull pouerte.
And as much or rather more streytly bound to avoid propriete: than any of
the subjects. For i^ that they ben souereynes: they have the more charge / and
so been most streytely bound to observe and keep: all the ceremonies / all
statures and constitucions. And specially the rules of their religion: more
precisely tha^ any other. And therefore have they no more right nor propriete
in the goods of the monastery: than has the leest of their subjects. No
sir (say they) as for propriete in the goods: the souereynes done not take
upon them. For the propriete of all the goods does remain in the pope and in
the self monastery / that is the hole mystical body / that may lawfully have
propriete / yet must the goods say they be ministered / distributed / divided
/ and spended: after the mind and discrecion of the souereynes.

Nay / nay / not so / I will in no wise grant thereunto. For the mind and
discrecion of the souereines: is many times contrary unto good discrecion / and
contrary also both unto law and reason. But I grant well that the goods of
the monastery: must be spente by divine / and well ordered discrecion / as
sacred goods / and by the diligence / and labors of the souereynes / and
their officers: duly and justly ministered. Yet sir (say they) the money and
goods must be delivered forth / and ministered by their hands / or by their
appoi^teme^t. I grant well. For if the king would appoint certain money to be
dealt in alms / or to by given in rewards unto certain persons / and would
chose and call one singular trusty person to have the gydynge / and
deliverance thereof / after the kings mind / and commandment: yet may not
that person so chosen by the king: ministre / or spente that money / after
his mind / nor discrecion: but after the commandment / and appointement of
the king. So in like manner (say I) the the souereynes (although they ben
chosen by election / or by the suffraunce of our lord) to have ye distribucion
of the goods and substance of the monastery: yet may they not spend it
otherwise: tha^ after the mind of the king our lord and savior Jesus.

How the souereynes and officers should ministre the goods of the monastery.
The.xiii. Chapitre.
SIr (say they) Where do you find where our savior did appoint the
souereynes: how / where / and unto whom they should / distribute and ministre
the goods of the monastery. Give good ear / and harken dilige^tely / and ye
shall know and perceive: how by the doctrine of Christ: every souereyne and
officer: should distribute and ministre ye goods of the monastery. If I
should here in. show (as ye common term is) my balde reason / or yet ye
auctorite of ye common doctores I know how they would puff and blow thereat
and set al at worse tha^ noght. I shall therefore pyght a more sure fou^dacio^
and ground. First saint Paul says. Quecu^que scripta su^t: ad nostra^
doctrina^ scripta su^t. To. 15. A.


What things (says he) so ever ben wryte^: they been written for our doctrine
and lernyng. And i^ common auctorite. Oi^s Christi actio: ^r^a e^ i^structio.
yt is every act (...) is our instruction / a lesson unto every Christian.

Now let us look upon the acts of Christ / and there shall we best learn
this matter. That Christ did live in common / in wylfull pouerte / without any
propriete: no person will deney. And how he spent / and ministered that money
that was in common: the gospel will testify. That is to say after such
manner / as is written of his parents saint Ioachin / and saint Anne the father
and mother of our blessed lady his mother Marie. In their legende is written yt
their goods were divided and ministered in three parts One part unto the
temple to be spent unto the honor of god. The second: unto the pore people
in alms. And the third part unto the necessary exhibicion / and finding of
them self and of their household. Now let us prove this in Christ. He
byganne of chyldhode to go with his parents unto Jerusalem unto the high
festes. Lu..2. G.
And afterward without his disciples he continued the same / ever to make
oblacion / and in all things he did accomplesshe and fulfill all the
commandments and holy ceremonies of ye law. Io. 5. and 7.
Io. 13. C.
And that he delte alms: does appear in the gospel in that / wha^ he spoke
unto Judas the traitor saying / that thou do / or will do: do it shortly /
his disciples (says the gospel) not knowing what he meant: supposed / and
thought: he had boden and commanded Judas (because he bare the common purse)
to bye some things again the feast / or else that he should give some alms
unto the poor nedy persons / which they would not have supposed ne thought:
except they had before (by experience) known: that he had accustomed and used
to give or command alms unto the pore and nedy persons. Now for the third
/ that he ministered unto his disciples all things necessary: does appear by
his own words unto the^ sayng. When you went about with me (says he) bid you
lack or want any thing. They said / nay / we lecked noti^g. Luce. 22.
So than is proved that he did provide for them al manner of things necessary.
And consequentely here is showed by the auctorite of the gospel: how Christ
our lord and savior: did spend dispose and ministre the common goods. And
no man (I think) can show that he spent or disposed any manner of goods / in
any other manner. Whereby is evident unto all them yt have good will to here /
know and to follow ye troth / and right way: how every souerein / and
officer should spend / or dispose: ye common goods of ye monastery / yt is to
say / other i^ orname^tes of ye church / and that does apperteyne unto the
divine service of god / and his honor / or else / unto the very / and unfeigned
need of the monastery / that is to say / the mayntenaunce and reparacion of all the housynge / byldynge / and lands apperteynynge there unto. And unto the
exhibicion / and necessary finding of the household and company thereof / that
is to say: principally the covent / and than their necessary servants / and
all to be found in all things honestly and without penury. For by the common
canon law: Ex. de instibus ca. no^ amplius and ca. auctoritate.
No mo persons / should be received into any monastery: than by the clear
revenues / and rentes of the same: may be honestely found without penury. For
when the souereynes or the officers done pynce the covent with nygardy and
hardines that does ever engender / and bread murmr and grudge. Specially
when the self souereynes and officers done fare well / and take plenty unto
them self. And the covent also done perceive: that the souereynes / or
officers servants: done fare better / and ben more liberally entreated: than
the covent. And wha^ the souereynes ben absent from ye covent: than does the
couente take ever occasion to desire liberte / as their souereynes have.
Another occasion in the souereynes and officers: is the negligent cure of the
seek persons in the monastery. The charge of whom apperteyneth most chefly
unto the souereines. For they should se and know / and not only command:
that the seek / should nothing lack that were necessary. And in very deed:
they been many times little regarded / and not charitably entreated and that
does cause / some persons to be content to have somewhat / and to take of
friends: wherewith to releue them self. Where they chyfly: and than all the
other of the covent should (as I said) have without penury / all manner of
things necessary / ministered by the souereynes / and the officers: liberally
/ ge^tilly / patiently / kyndly / louyngly / and charitably. And tha^ should
they set little by all the hole world / and not only avoid: but also abhor
and hate propriete They se things (after ye manner before said) duly
acco^plesshed: and reasonable / provision made for ye year following: all the
residue of all the re^tes and reuenuwes of ye monastery: should holly be given
and dealt in alms unto ye pore and nedy people. For ye monasteries should never
keep ne care: Matthew. 6. C.
for any worldly tresour / our savior said unto his disciples. No lite the
saurizare vobis the sauru^ super terra^. That is / have you never appetite ne
will: to keep / or ley for your self: any manner of treasure or riches upon
yerth. Which sentence: is imparatyue / and a commandment / unto al the^ yt
have enterprised and taken upon the^ the discipline of Christ. And than if ye
commandment should be kept of any persons: of whom (I pray you) should it
become better / and more precisely to be kept: than of the^ yt (by sole^pne
vow have enterprised / and promised to follow Christ: yt so commanded) in
pouerte. To keep tresoure tha^ in places of religion: is al one / to keep a
fend / or spirit of the dyuell in a cage or cofre. Now ye se and may well
perceive: how (after ye example of our savior) the goods of the monastery
should be spente / and another by the will / pleasure / or discrecion of the
souereynes or officers / or yet by any other mean: tha^ only by the said
examples of Christ and by the labor and diligence of ye soueryne and officers.

How contarie unto this example of Christ: the souereynes and officers done
co^munly spend ye goods of the monastery. The.xiiii. Cha.
Now let the souereynes and officers take patience / if they fortune to read
this book.

For here will I somewhat show / as well in part by mine own knowledge / in
places where I have been: as by the relacio^ of credible religious persons:
that much did mourn and wayle the decay or religion. And also by the common
/ and openly known life of the souereynes and officers: how much / and far
contrary unto the example of christ: the goods of ye monasteries ben spe^ded
/ and distributed or rather depopulate and wasted / For where one pert should be
spent to ye honor of god / and to ye mai^tena^ce of ye church / ye orname^tes
of ye same / and divine service: it is now spent / and dispe^sed / unto ye
homage of ye dyuel. And yet wot I well / what hereunto many will say. Sir ye
churches and monasteries: were never better ne so well garnisshed / and decked
with plate / Iuelles / and clothes / of gold / silver / and sylke: as they ben
now in this time. I must need grant. But yet I say they done now as the
children of Israel did in the old testament that would worshype god sometime /
and sometime thyr ydoles / and sometime both together. So done they / spend
some of the goods of the monastery: in the ornaments of the church / unto
the honor of god. And yet done they spend a another great part / unto the
homage of the dyuell / the mayntenaunce of pride / which they done say
communly is unto the honor of the place / for mine lords honor / or for
mine ladies honor / meaning thereby: the abbotte or the priour / the abbess
or the prioresse. But I would know where they find any auctorite: that can
show: that any of the auctores of their rules / saint Basyle saint Augustyne /
saint Benedicte / or saint Franciske: were caled lords / or where they spent
any of ye goods of the monastery / for their honor / or yet for ye honor
of the place. Or where find they / that any of the said auctores of their
rules: did ride upon so royal horses and mules and go forth beamed with such
astate / very pomp and pride / as the souereynes done in this time. Och sir
(say they) the world was tha^ nothing like as now. And ye people must
conform them self unto the present world. And so done they grant that I
proposed / that is / that with the honor of god / the pride of the dyuell
hate perte also. And forther: where as we said by the example of Christ: the
goods in a another part should be spended and distributed / unto the
necessary exhibicion of the persons of the monastery without pynchynge or
penury: they done grant that part of ye goods of the monastery: been / and
must be spente unto the honor / and vain pleasure of the world. They must
(say they) confourme them self / and follow the custom. And they know well /
and done se openly: that the world does / and of long time has continually
drawn / and returned unto mere gentilite. And unto the same manner of living:
that was used among infideles before christianite / and by reason: if any
people should resist gentilite / and bring the people therfrome: religious
persons should most conveniently labor therein / and show most expressly
the example of Christ. For thereunto they have bound them self / why should
they say and suppose to be a sufficient excuse for the^: passing their fathers
/ and auctores tradicions: they must confourme themself unto the world? Sith
also they have utterly forsaken the world / and in their profession proclaimed
them self enemies unto the world. Why should they now make peace / or take
truce with the world. Or rather why should they yield them as bond caytiues
unto the servitude and thraldom of the world? For if they look well upon their
astate / and manner of living: in their manner places / graunges / lodges: so
costly and pleasau^tly bylded / cyled / hanged / and rychely stored with all
things of pleasure / plate of gold / silver / and other metalles / a
bushement / and company of waiters / some gentelme^ / some ye men and gromes:
well decked / and clenly arayde in sylkes / and cheynes of gold and silver: and
the abbess with treyned gentleweme^ wayters after the same manner / and all after
ye most courtly fashon: they may prove evidently: they done more approach unto
gentilite / and ben more like gentiles (Their entreprise of perfection weyed
and accounted) tha^ the profane princes / and lay people of ye world. Now for
ye third: where the example of Christ does show: how all ye residue / and
remain of the goods of the monastery / after all charges allowed: and
reasonable provision made for the year to come: all I say holly: should be
delte / and given our unto the pore: they natwtstandynge done give a great
part unto the third general enemy of mankind / that is the flesh / not
only i^ their abou^dau^ce of dysshes / and superfluous fare and that taken
both our of due time and place: but also unto their kynsfolke / and carnal
fre^des. Which (as the common sayng is) done take great part from the coue^t.
And unto the mayntenau^ce of this misordred ministry / and mispence of the
goods of monastery: ye souereynes ben not ashamed to take: by pacte / and
comnaunt / and by consent of the subjects: a certain porcio^ of propriete
(they say) unto their chamber / but it is in deed / as well unto the hale / as
the chamber / and unto the kychyn and stable. And generally to be spent and
used / or rather misused / after their own will and private pleasure. And if yt
be not propriete: there can be (i^ my reason) no propriete. Which thus
(contrary unto the example of Christ / and the traditions of their rules)
misvsed: does cause the^ the more lightly to dispense / and give license unto
the officers / and other of the subjects: to do as they done / and so eueryche
to have a singular portion of propriate: under the form before said. I said
to dispense / but I should have said rather: to presume to dispense above their
power / or yet (as is said) above / and beyond any power upon yerth / and so
done they make double offense / both unto the danger of their souls / and the
blyndfull deceyt of their subjects. These and many other offenses in the
souereynes: ben great occasion of the misorder / and ruin of religion. For the
souereynes must render give account / and answer for the subjects. And
therefore is not sufficient for the^ to say unto their subjects: go forth / do
this / or that reguler obseruaunce: but rather should they say / as our savior
said unto his disciples: come you after me / follow me. Matthew. 4. C. Matthew. 10.
E. Mar. 10. C Luce. 9. C
Do as ye se me do. For it is sufficient unto the disciple: if he be as his
master is / but that is to mean / wha^ he supposes / or trusts that his
master does well or else not amys. If than the souereynes: would leave / forsake
/ and clean put away this poison of propriete / in the^ self: I doubt not it
should not long remain in the subjects / but shortly vanysshe / faynte and
deye.

Of the occasion and causes of propriete in ye subjects. The.xv. Chapitre.
ANd yet ben there many great defaultes and occasions of this propriete: i^ the
self subjects One / and yt (I think) a principal occasion and cause: 1.
Cassianus i. 7. des pu^ Philar. ca. 7.
of these stipendes / and such other proprietes: is ye dulnes / feynt heart /
lack of mekenes / lack of the love of god and of ye religion / lack of the
reverent / dred of our lord / in the subjects. For the meke person / yt has
the reuere^c dread / and love of our lord. and does groundly / and steadfastly
set the heart and mind to love religion / and to profecte and go forth therein
/ unto the honor and laud of our lord / the welthe of his own soul / and
the edificacion of all christianes: will take no occasion / ne meddle meddle /
nor note / ne mark any matters without the^ self Except they were extremely
given / and should seem to redownde / and grow: unto the dishonor of god and
hurt unto the religion. And yet than: nothing to be vndescretly vexed therewith
/ nor over bysye in medlynge therewith / but according unto the order of the
holy gospel: Matthew. 18. B.
give monicion / with charity soft words and meke and lawly byhauiour / being
sorry Ibidem. Ca. 14.
before their enter ben infected with avarice. For they would be glad to serve
god: so they might be sure to lack nothing. And therefore they cast before
what may fall / and so they fall by te^ptacion: Look upon saint Brigittes
reuelacions. li. 7. ca. 20.
into a doubt / dread or fere of their entreaty in religion. How they shall be
cherysshed and provided fore among the company. And to be sure of somewhat if
need be: they make provision / and leave some money / Iuelles / lands / or some
other goods in the custody and keeping of their trusty friends / that in such
case shall serve them. Which provision: stands well with good policy and
prudence but not with good religion / as we have showed at large / in your book
of statutes / in the title of enter into religion / or of receiuyng. In extra.
vag. vrbani 4. Sane ne i^ vinea domini. Act. 5.
For i^ such: enter they ben excommunicate / and accursed by the pope. For so
did Ananie / and Saphira his wife / provide for them sefe / and both peryshed /
stryken to death / by the just judgment of god / executed by saint Petre / as
does appear i^ ye acts of the Apostles. Some other persons / that (without
any blemyshe of conscience) have ryghtly entered religion: Done not find there
so good cheryshynge / and welfare: as they looked fore / and tha^ done they
begin to look back from whens they came / what state or case they were in
before / and how they lack now / that they were wont to have / in things
temporal and so have they more care for bodily pleasure / than for spiritual
increace and perfect. And where they promised at their enter: not only to
forsake the world / and all the pleasures thereof: but also to here pacientely
the yoke of Christ / and mekely to suffer ye peines / and labors of religion:
now they look back from the plogh / or plowe / whereunto they put their hand /
and did promise by solemn vow: Luce. 9. G
to follow the same continually with diligence: unto the same continually with
diligence / unto ye end of their life. And so done they return again as a
dog unto his vomytet and render them self unapt and full unmeet and unable
for the kingdom of heaven. Turmoylyng again in the world / and set their
mind / and study to find ways / and means somewhat to get of their kynne or
fre^des / or by their own labors / in writing or sendynge of tokens to get
acquayntaunce. And to make friends to labor for their promocion / or to give
the^ great gifts / for small tryfles. And than done they begin to store /
look up / and head all that comes to hand. And lest conscience should any
thing murmr / or be co^trarious unto their appetites: they ask license of
the souereynes to use and retain such things so obtained. And many times the
souereynes been so far over seen: that they done presume to give ye license /
above their power / and so (as is said) both the parties ben dampnably
deceived. These manner of religious persons: Math. 26. and 27. A.
ben disciples unto Judas the traitor that sold Jesus. For so he returned
unto the world by the mysuse of money / and was dampened Cassianus vt supra.
And these persons therefore ben most odious / and most unreasonable. And
that is of those: that made lawful enter into religton / and been there as
well entreated / and cherisshed or much better: tha^ ever they were in the
world / and yet sometime such persons they ben: that were of low birth /
pore folks children / of pore educacion and hardly brought up / and yet when
they have tarred a while in the religion / and done perceive the^ self felous
or seniores: unto such as in the world were far above the^: they begin to
set the^ self forth / and take upon them / as though they were of high blood
/ and had been of great reputacion. And when a dyshe comes before the^ that
they know not in flesh / or fysshe what thing it is (for they never saw ne
knew any such before) yet will they take upon the^ to judge the same / and also
of wynes of the color / odoure / sauoure / or taste / and of the dressynge /
and seasonyng of all thing: as though they were expert: And if they can be
flaterye / gifts / or pleasures: obtain the favor of the souereyne: than
will they be nothing content with the common fare / ne with the common habit
and array: but they will desire to have si^gularites / that none other have but
they alone. And if they be denied: tha^ will they murmr / and grudge / and be
seek / for displesure. And do no duete of religion or very little / and that
full dully and feyntly. And if their fantasy can not be obtained / or continued
of the charges of the monastery / or else because they will not stand in
danger therefore: than done they make friends / and return so again unto ye
world as ye other did / and with the^ done fall into ye da^pnable dongion of
propriete. And these religious persons: 4. Reg. 5.
ben disciples / and subjects unto Giezi / yt was disciple / and servant unto
the prophet Helizey / he is their abbotte / and they done follow him. For he
was not content with ynoghe / but he would have: yt he never had before ye time
/ and therefore he did not only forgo and lose: the grace of propriete / that
he should have had by succession: but also he had the leprenes of Naaman and
for ever was a lazare or lepre. And so douteles shall they have yt will be his
disciples. Here ben now three examples of holy scripture / of ye danger of
propriete. One of Anany and Saphira. The second / of Judas the traytoure. The
third of Giezi / which done signify three manner of religious persons. One /
of the^ yt done bring goods into the monastery with the^ for their own use and
pleasure / and so bring in the poison and pestilence of propriete / and not
only done dry thereupon the^ self: but also done infecte many other. The
second of the^ / yt will have in religion as they had before. And ye third of
them yt will in religion: have more tha^ they had before. And surely there ben
many / many / and to many mo occasions in the subjects of this serpent
propriete / in gendred by folysshe and ne we fangle fantasies / by dulnes /
negligence / and want of learning. They know not their reuls or understand
them not / some never red ne herd them. And so some little care fore them. And
so done fall and leyne unto excuses nothing reasonable. Some will allege
scripture for them / sayng. Beatius est magis dare, quam accipere. Act. 20.
It is better (say they) to give: tha^ to take / that is to mean: That person
is more in wealth that is of substance / and may give: than the need person /
that must take. And for that cause they would (they say) have somewhat to give.
Cassianus ca. 16.
But saint Johan Cassian does counsel the^ not so to abuse holy scripture.
But rather let the^ consider / that if it be good to give: they have done that
good / and that in the most meritorious manner. For they have given: not only
all that they had: but also all that they were possible to have. And yet for
thermore, they have given the^ self. So that now they have nothing to give.
And no man will say in reason: that better is / or yet that it may be good: to
give that is not his / but that does apperteyne unto a another person. They
should therefore despysing all things temporal / think or judge in their minds
/ that better is and more happy / and gracious: to give / or to receive:
spiritual things: than temporal things. And let the^ thank our lord god /
that has (if they keep their promise / and be pore in spirit) given unto the^
in proper possession: the kingdom of heaven / and power so to give / and
liberally to deele: spiritual things / unto the nedy / or pore / and also
unto the rich. And so: to releue / help / and conforte them: And to multiply
the riches and virtues of them self. Put away than all excuses / good devout
religious persons: and apply your heart / and mind with study and diligence:
precisely to keep your vow promised / of wylfull pouerte. And utterly on al
manner: to exclude / and exile the mortal enemy thereof / that is propriete.

Of the remedies again this propriete. The.xvi. Chapitre.
OF the remedies and means whereunto: somewhat shall follow. One good and
ti^guler remedy / or mean thereunto: is so call oftymes unto mind / and
remembrance / the extreme and continual pouerte: of our lord god and savior
Jesus / his blessed mother / and his holy Apostles. And also to recou^te the
institucions / and ordinances of old fathers / specially of the universal
church. And here to have present i^ mind: our promise and sole^pne vow /
made by open profession: in the face of the church: unto our holy rules. To
remember also the great and unspeakable reward to be had for the obseruaunce /
and keeping of our said promise. And the terrible / and most paynfull reward
unto the breakers thereof / as by the examples before rehearsed may appear / of
Ananie / and Saphira his wife / that were suddenly stryken unto death / by the
sodeyn vengeance of god. Of Judas the traitor / that hanged him self. And of
Giezi / that suddenly fell lepre / and all for propriete. Many examples ben
hereof: in vitas Patrum / and in ye reuelacions of our holy mother saint
Brigitte / and of many other holy saints. The sentence also of holy church:
is not little to be regarded here in / that does judge all proprietaries: to be
without christian burial / and to be buried upon the donghyll / and so
nombred and accounted: as miserable souls dampened in pain everlasting. These
things well considred: should (in my reason) move any heart / though it were
(as they say) stony / and made of yren. And so: be a good remedy again this
said pestilence of propriete. Another singular remedy / and / and abou^dau^t
bounty and goodness of our lord god / not only in creacion / but also in
rede^pcion / and daily co^seruacion / keeping / defendyng / fedyng and
nurishynge of us with no course meats / or drynkes but with his blessed body /
and holy sacred blood / and thus to fall unto a disposicion of herty / and
reuerente thanks. And to think than and say with a lowely heart. Quid retribua^
dn^o, Pro oibus que retribuit mihi? What thing shall I render unto my lord
god: Psalm. 115.
for all that he has given unto me? good lord I can not find what I may give
the / for thou art lord of al / and thou nedest nothing. Yet there tha^ to
remember what thing he has desired of every person: sayng, Da mihi cor tuu^,
et sufficit mihi. Give unto me (says he) thine heart / and that will suffice /
and content me / as though I were in extreme need. Pro. 23.
Than say with all thy hole heart. Psalm. 115.
Calice^ salutaris accipiam, et nome^ domini inuocabo. That is / I will take
upon me the chalisse and pain of health and salvation / and I will continually
call upon the name of god. This sene^ce has two parts / which every
christian should apply unto. The first part is / to do / and to dispose him
self unto the life of penance. The second: to call upon our lord / by
continual prayer and laud / and praise of his name. In the first: he does
make promise with him self / sayng. I will undertake / and I will dispose my
self / with all my heart / and mind to follow my lord Jesus / and to walk
with diligence: in the way of his life / and take upon me the cross of
penance / that is to say / I will do violence unto mine own self. Wha^ so
ever any mocion of fraylte or of mine enemy: does lay before me any co^modite
/ or excuse of propriete: I will nothing / obey / leyne / naepplie thereunto /
but forwith: I will cast it from me as a venomous serpent / and that contrary
unto mine own apppetite and desire / and contrary unto mine own reason. I
will not say or think: why should I not / or why may I not: have this or that /
it is but a tryfle / a thing of little valor? No more was ye apple / that
Adam was dampened fore / but a thing of small price. I will not (say you)
reason ne dispute with the dyuell / but I will use violence unto my self. For
I know well what our lord says. Matthew. 11.
Regnum celorum vim patitur, et violenti rapiu^t illud. That is: The perfection
of Christ's law and religion: does require violence and force / and those
persons that been violent / and quick: done rauishe and cayche it. The very
pathe of Christ therefore: is violent. No person may walk therein: but by
self violence. Matthew. 16. Marci. 8. Luce. 9.
Who so ever (says Christ) will save his own soul: shall lose it / that is:
if he follow his own will: he shall forgo and lose it / and his soul also.
Let hi^ therefore leave and slay his own will. No virtue may be had: with out self
violence. So yt the person be ever co^trarious and violent unto his own will /
appetite / and desire. When I spek here / of will: I mean not the ordered will
of ye soul / nor the will and appetite of the spirit / but the will of
sensualite / the appetite / and desire of the flesh / which is ever
aduersaunt and co^trarious: Galla. 5.
unto the ordered will of the soul / and of the spirit. For that will of the
soul: is ever naturally inclined unto virtue / and has a disposicion and
natural desire thereunto / as you may perceive by good reason. For no
reasonable person / is so sinful / so ungracious / or so full of misordre^:
that would not wyshe / will / and desire to be without sin / and with out
appetite of sin / but rather he would wyshe yt he were synles and had never
ne ever should do any manner of sin. But alas / the will of the flesh / ye
sensualite: does / oftymes by freylte / and somtymes by negligence of the self
persons: vanquylshe and overcome: that will of the soul. And al is: because
they will not put violence unto them self / specially in the first mocion. For
at the first temptacio^: they should by violent stomach / and obstinate
cruelte: kytte / and cast away the sensual will and carnal appetite / not
otherwise: than they would kytte / and cast away a piece af their own flesh
/ that were poisoned / and venemed / and so should else: in effect / and
destroy the hole body. Observe therefore and take good head unto the serpents
head / for he has sharp teth and will byte sore / but he can never hurt ne
perce your skin / except ye will your self. Have therefore good awayte upon
your self. Search / note / and mark well your own appetytes / and sensual
desires / and stand not upon your thoughts / ne play with your mocio^s / nor
yet reason / or dispute: with your temptacions / cast away the pleasure / and
avoid in any wise the consent. li. 6. de spiritu philargirie. ca. 21.
For (as saint Ioha^ Cassian says) Propriete is not only committed / in
effect and deed / by having / or keeping any thing unlawfully: but also by
affecte / will / and mind: any thing so to have. Oftymes therefore visit your
own self / prove and perceive your own appetites make a chapitre with your
own self / and examine your own conscience / remember whether you have any
thing in your keeping / that ye provided / and brought in with you for your
own use. Search well your thoughts and appetites / whether they look back:
unto ye state ye were of before / or yt ye might have been of: if ye had
continued in the world. And if ye so find / and prove your mind occupied:
leye before it again for answer: the chance of Anany and Saphira / and of
Judas the traytoure. And if your mind would desire to have that ye had not
before / or that ye se a another of your company have: which ye have not: than
represent unto your own mind: the punissheme^t of Giezi. And by ware well of
the appetite / to store / keep / and to ley things a part / specially: for
your own private use. For that does ye said Cassiane reprehende very much /
though it were of very little valor / as a nedle / threde / thymble / tables /
pyncell / pen / or penknyfe. etc. For propriete will crepe in / and enter at
a little hole / and ones entered: hard to be expelled and avoided. Ecclesias,
19. A.
And scripture says: Who will not regard small things: shall sone and
lightly fall into great ieoparties. And therefore I would advise you: to give a
study unto your assayles / not only unto the crafty and subtyle mocions of
your great enemy the dyuel: but also unto the pricks and iustigacions / of
your own fraylte. And most of all other: to avoid the familiarite of such
persons: as ben suspecte of that vice / and yet among them: of those
specially: that in their co^municacion and talk: will defend or excuse that
pestilence of propriete. For the example / words and mocion of the^: is more
ieopardous / and more perilous: than of all the dyuelles of hell / avoid the^
therefore / as a pestilence / as poyso^ / as a serpent / as a raumpynge / or
ravenous wild and wode best / and as a furious fend of hell. Which thing
to perform: ye must (as I said) use violence. And say with the prophet (as
is said) Calicem salutaris accipiam I will take the penance / the examples /
and ways: of my lord and savior Jesus. And so shall ye have singular conforte
/ but you shall not yet have full surety. For no person of him self can be
able to continue. And therefore ye must Join the second part of the said
verse unto the first / and say. Et nomen domini inuocabo. I will call upon
the name of our lord. The name of Jesus: has great and mighty power. I will
(say you) call upon him / by continual prayer. I will put my hole trust in
him / and he will (I promise you) perform your desire. By his help and
grace: you shall have merueylous rest of mind / quietude of conscience / and go
forth and increace: in religious perfection.

How to continue without ieoparty of propriete. The.xvii. Chapitre.
How here shall follow as we promised: how ye may pass forth in religion
with out the danger of propriete / and yet have all things necessary / and
many pleasures also without any ieoparty of conscience. First than: ye must
considre / that i^ every perfection: ben degrees / some low / some mean / and
some high and notable. The leest and most low perfection of virtue: must
ever be without deedly sin. And that is accounted as sufficient unto
salvation. So ye forther perfection be not despised / and set at naught or
little regarded. For persons may be perfect / and right good: although they
fall into many venial offe^ses. And very few persons i^ any virtue: done
attain and come: unto ye most high / and most perfect degree thereof. A
familiar example may be i^ the virtue of chastity. The lowest degree and
perfection whereof: is never to have deliberate consent unto any carnal act of
generation / ne unto any byhauiour of uncleanness unlawful. Yet in this degree /
ben many persons: yt have many affections / both natural / and carnal / and
many freyle / and light byhauiours / yt done much minisshe the perfection of
very chastity. Some persons been of a more high degree / yt done avoid with
diligente awayte all outward occasions / as kissing / clippynge / touching /
light lokes / wanton contenau^ce the hearing and speaking of all unclean words
/ sole presence / with al such other. And yet wha^ they be assailed inwardly i^
mind / or moved in body: they done not so diligently repress the mocions / ne
so hastily put them away / as good virtue would require / but sometime give the^
place by delectacion only / without deliberate consent: and so play with them /
and suffer them without great violence: to hang upon them unto their great
trouble / and many times: unto the ieoparty of great inconvenience. The
perfect degree of this virtue: is to be so mortified in body / that such
assayles done nothing / or very little: trouble the persons / but rather done
inflame them in the love of our lord / and move the^ unto horror / and
hatered of all manner of sin / and done excite and stir the^ unto ye more
deep mekenes / unto their great merit. Of these things / shall we more
largely speak in the next and third membre. Now let us perceive a like manner
in this virtue of wylful pouerte. The lowest degree whereof is this. Never to
consent by deliberacio^: to receive / possede / or have / to reteyne or keep:
any manner of thing temporal: by license / or without licenie: unto peculier
and proper use / that is / so to be in the power of the religious person /
that he may: by any means: alienate / change / give / sell / or lend that
thing / for self co^modite / at self will or liberty / defending that
thing as his own. Defe^dyng in a religious person / is / when knowing the
will of the souereyne in the contrary: he would reteyne / and not deliver or
bystowe the same thing: after the will of the souereyne / but by violence / or
rather for dread of temporal pain or displeasure / tha^ for dread of the
offense of god. For so / to have any thing (although by license) is (as we
said) very poisoned propriete. For the religious professed persons can have
(without propriete) nothing else / for self co^modite: but only the use of
any thing temporal / and yet as we said before / that use to be ever at
vncerteynte / that is to say / in the power / liberte / and will of the
souereyne / as far as may be convenient. An other degree of this virtue
wylfull pouerte (the contrary whereof is also propriete) is: not to have / nor
yet to consent in will to have / that uncertain use of any thing temporal:
without the knowledge / power / and license of the souereyne / other express /
or understand. Express knowledge and license: is / when that license is given
for any certain thing / unto the subject: by the self souereyne present /
or by credible message / in word or writing. And license enterpretate or
understand: is / when the subject (not having leyser / or time conueniente:
to give knowledge unto the souereyne / and so to have license / for the matter)
does verily suppose / think / and judge in conscience / the souereyne would /
and will be content to give that license / and does also purpose and determyne
to show the matter afterward unto his souereyne. And this license is
sufficient to discharge conscience / for the time and case. And so in like
manner: when the subject does receive any thing / of any officer or officers
appointed by the souereyne unto the ministracion. And yet here byware / give
good head / and remember / that I said / when the subject does judge in
conscience: that the souereyne is content. For many officers (I fere) by
folyshe affection: done many times: defoule / or put themself i^ ieoparty of
propriete / wha^ (above and beyond their commission) they done ministre and
give by parcialite / for love and personal favor of ye receyuers / after
their own mind and pleasure / as though the thing were theyrs and in their
power (the mind of the souereyne / and the need of the receyuer / little or
nothing regarded) and that does oftymes seem to be true: when they done give /
and profer many things: vndesyred and unasked / or somtymes heir their
fellows to do pleasure for the^ and give them reward after their own appetite
/ without the souereynes mind or consent. Here they will say: as before is
said the souereine has given them general license to ministre that is under
their hands: after their own discrecion / unto that I have answered / let
them look what is before written and so be content. But I would advise ye
devout subjects / that feyne would avoid ieoparty / and be on the sure
part: that if they perceive / or in conscience done suspecte any such parcial
favor or prodigalite: that they by no means do receive / or use that thing
so ministered / for dread of the infection and poison of propriete / except
that instante need do require / or constreyne them to receive and use it. And
than to think with determinate mind: to show the souereyne / thereof. For the
religious person may use nothing: without (as I said) license of ye souereyne.
We done read in vitas patrum / that a religious person (by the permission of
god) did appear (after his death) unto one of his company / showing that he was
in merueylous great pains / for because he gave a pair of old shows unto a
pore body without license of the souereyne / and required instantly / that the
same shows might be restored again unto the will of the souereyne. Let no
person therefore think that thing little to be regarded: that does deserve
intolerable pain. Leyue: is light (says the common proverb) This degree of
wylfull pouerte is common / and generally kept / or should be kept of all
religious persons. And yet many persons of this degree: have sometime a fond
or folyshe appetite: to take / use / and keep (by such license of the
souereyne lawfully obtained) many and diverse things that be not necessary /
or very needful / but that they store / and keep the^ for a chance of need to
follow. And although in case / yt may be done without great offense: yet for a
surete / it does minisshe very much the perfection of this virtue. yet
natwithstandynge: because I would not be noted extreme / or to hard / nor yet
render you perplexed / or scrupulous: I will somewhat show / and declare my
pore mind mind: as unto the reteyne and keeping of such things in store.
For we have in a reuelacion showed by our lord unto our holy mother saint
Brigette and is contained in the rule of saint savior / that omnia
rationabiliter debent fieri, et vt occasio a prauis excludatur. That is: All
things should be done in religion reasonably / and with discrecion. So ever
that occasion should be avoided / from all things inordinate. Wherefore I dare
not utterly condemn such store / I mean: received / and retained / by the
knowledge / and license of the souereyne. For so: in some things: it may be
both necessary / convenient / and lawful. Because that every person in the
monastery: is not in like state of bodily health and condition. Example / If
one person do use oftymes to sweet / an other to blede / with such like
chau^ces: no man will think unreasonable yt such persons have shyfte in
store / bysyde them remaining. And like wise of spices / pills / and
medicines / for singular greues. And saint Augustyne also in the rule: does
favor much the custom of educacion. These things if they be not kept in
over much abundance or superfluite / nor with a covetous mind of self
provision: I think: been tolerable. And so likewise do I judge of tokens /
images / painted papers / and such other / although there be no necessite or
need. yet the affection and pleasure of such trifles: may be mere vanite and
minishe perfection: But that any person in religion: should keep plate of
gold or silver / or any manner of money / or such things / that be of such
valor / that might be accounted as riches / or substance: will I never grant:
except the officers / and they only (as is said) for the common ministracion
And likewise of the habit / array / beddyng / and other things reguler / all
to be had: without notable superfluite. Alas good religious persons / what
should that profytte you: if (by example) you had avoided and fled from a Lion /
or any other wild ravenous best / and so escaped danger? And would afterward
wylfully return again to play / or company with the same best / and so be
devoured? What (in like manner) does it avail / or vauntage you, to forsake /
flee / and escape the world / and all the dangers thereof: And thus by folysshe
affection / fond appetite / under the color of license: to be noted / snared
/ lymed and more fast imprisoned in the world: than ever ye ware: or tha^
co^munely ben any worldly persons? For surely so been religious persons: when
they done return unto any si^ne / more depely been they drouned therein / and
far more careless / and without conscience: than any other / and therefore does
follow of justice: they shall be most depely dampened in the pit of perdicion.
For the love of our lord than / good religious persons: not only fle / and
forsake this raumpynge Lion / this poisoned serpente propriete: but rather sle
/ and destroy it utterly / that is / that ye labor / enforce / and give
laborious study / and diligence: to clymbe unto the most high point / and
perfection of this promised virtue / and vow / wylfull pouerte. The perfect
point of pouerte is: To another receive / or take / nor reteyne / keep / or
have: any manner of thing temporal / with license / or without license: but
that very and unfeigned need does require according unto the state / degree / and
condition of ye persons / and to give a study with diligence / to perceive
what thing they might spare / forgo / and have not / and that thing never to
receive / keep / or have / ne yet wyshe / will / covet / or desire / by any
means to have. But rather / with good will / and glad spirit: to be content
with less than is needful / and so to suffer some pain for defaulte of that
were necessary / although it were ready at will and power to be had. For saint
Augustine says in ye rule: Ca. 3, i^ fine
ye better is somewhat to want or lack: than any thing to have ouermoche.
This degree of wylfull pouerte: is very perfect / and yet in the same degree:
ben many degrees / as ben in mekenes / if ye will se the perfections of this
degree of pouerte set forth in experience: look in vitas patrum / in the second
part / in the book or title that a religious person should have nothing in
possession / which does immediately follow: the book / or title of
fornicacion. Vitas pa.
And there shall ye find: that the most hard or streyte point that I have
written: is very large and light / in comparison unto that thing that they
wroght fulfilled and performed in deed. And yet were they nothing bound
thereunto / by any vow or promise of profession as we been / but all that they
did: was of their own liberte / and fre will / to perform their entrepryse.
I do send you unto vitas Patrum both because of the auctorite / and also
because it should have been accounted superfluous / and labor lost: to write
here again / that is written there / specially sithe ye have it in english.
Be not I pray you therefore / loathe to turn the book. I have showed you the
place / it is but very short / and yet (as they say) very sweet and profitable.
Read it ones over / and if ye have a love and desire unto this holy virtue
wylfull pouerte: and full determinate mind: to avoid / fle / abhor / and
utterly to sle the contrary vice poisoned propriete: ye shall (I dare say)
read it over again with good will undesired. Our lord move and stir your
mind to follow it / or at the leest to enforce and to atte^pte: to attain
unto the top of the hill the most high point of this perfection. For
though you never come thereunto: your diligence / and good will: shall be well
and liberally rewarded. For our lord is the most bounteous / and liberal
rewarder / and gives aboundau^tly: unto all persons that done love him.
Which love and reward: he grant us / that bought us / our lord god / and
most sweet savior Jesus / who preserve you. The old wreche of Syon Richard
Whytforde.

Thus ends the second membre of this third part / which is the second
board of our vessel.
Of the third essenciall vow of religion. Chastity.
Preface.
THis is the.iii. table or board of your Tonne or Pype. The perface why this
vow is put last in nombre.
That is to say / pure chastity. And why we put this vow last i^ order: ye
shall have our pore mind and reason. All these.iii. virtues / obedience /
pouerte / and chastity / yt now ben promised by sole^pne vow / and open
profession: were in ye beginning of Christ's church: universally kept of all
spiritual persons: more streytly / in more precise manner / and in more full
perfection: without any vow (as we have said in ye last book) or promise: tha^
they be now: with all promise and vow. For in ye time: these essencialles were
kept by the holy Apostles / and their successors many years: as the most
perfect form of Christ's life and religion / yt is: ye law of the gospel.
First for obedience: he said of himself. Io. 6. D. Ibidem.
I came not (says he) into this world: to work or do mine own will: but (by
due obedience) to acco^plysshe / and to do yt will of my father. And saint
Paul says: Phi. 2. B.
he was for us made obedient unto death. The gospel also does wytnes / yt in
his own person god and man: Luce. 2. G
he was obedient unto his carnal pare^tes: mary his blessed and natural mother
/ and Joseph his supposed father. And he was always also obedient unto the law
/ in his circumcision / presentacion / and other holy ceremonies: although he
were above ye law / and nothing subject / ne bound thereunto. Thus and by
many other means: did he show / and set forth obedience / as examplar of
excellent virtue: of all his disciples to be followed. And in that he had
nothing proper / but all in commune: he expressed wylfull pouerte in him
self. And as unto his virginal and most pure chastity: no man ever made
doubt / which holy virtues: he did not only perform in him self: but also
he wylled / persuaded / and counsayled al his disciples and all other (called
thereunto by grace) to follow ye same. Which said example / and counsel
(after the ascencion of Christ / and when they had received the holy ghost)
his holy Apostles: did follow and keep in most perfect and precise manner. And
by their example and instruction: so did the prelates / and the spiritual
part of the church: many many years. But when afterward / the people byganne
to fall unto the manners again / and customs of ge^tilite / and so these
things byga^ne much to decay: many holy and devout persons: moved of grace:
fled / and did forsake the world / with the vices / delites / and pleasures
thereof / and went into wyldernes / where without any bond / profession / or
promise they returned unto the reule / and example of ye old church of
Christ. And of their one devout mind and fre will: they continued and
performed / in precise manner: the said form of living / in them self and by
them self alone. By whose example: many persons than took the same way. And
came unto the elders: In vitas pa^et i^ collacionibus.
and of their own mind and fre will: took instruction / and were disciples
and most lowly obedient unto them / as we read of saint Paul / saint Antony /
and diverse other. And so did they (after the manner of the Apostles and of the
first church of Christ) make: not only their goods: but also their labors
common. And pure chastity: had they in reverence / and ever with dread in
extreme manner: avoided and fled the familiarite and presence: of the contrary
sect. yet holy fathers / perceyuyng that these holy virtues byga^ne again to
decay: provided and made rules / statutes / and ordinances / for the more sure
continuau^ce of the same. As saint Basile / our holy patron saint Augustyne /
saint Benedicte / and saint Franciske. 18. q^. 2. perni crosam.
Which rules ben now (by ye auctorite of holy church) incorporate in the
law. So that who so ever do wylfully profess any of them: must need (under
pain of deedly sin) keep the same / as unto the essencialles of the same
rules / which ben: obedience / wylfull pouerte / and chastity. And so now
those.iii. said virtues / which before were unto all persons: cou^sayles of
liberte: ben unto them that done wylfully profess them: commandments and
bonds of necessite. The virtue therefore of obedience is first in order:
because it was first showed out in example by our savior Jesus / that from the
age of.xii. years did work / and perform obedience unto his carnal
parents: unto the age of.xxx. years / never in any age disobedient. And
although he were ever of most pure chastity yet was his pouerte set forth in
example / and showed before chastity. And also because that the mysorder / and
misuse of worldly goods: have been always occasion of ye misorder of the body /
and breaking of chastity. For very few persons of abou^dau^t riches have
kept precisely ye purite of meritorious chastity. I say meritorious: Matthew.
19. B.
because every chastity is not meritorious. So does our savior declare by his
own mouth sayng. Some persons ben chaste of birth / and natural
disposicion. Some other ben co^streyned by violence to be chaste / as those
that been deprived of their natural me^bres / called eunuchs / or those ye ben
restreyned by force / and kept from their own liberte and will. And both
these chastites: ben co^munely without merit. The third manner of chastity: is
of such persons / as for the kingdom of heaven / yt is to say: for the
religion of Christ: done wylfully by vow and promise / deprive them self /
of al acts of generation. And done keep chastity in due manner according unto
their state / condition and calling. And this chastity because of the words of
Christ / yt done follow: is called a counsel of chastity / and not a
commandment or bound thereunto. For he said forthwith. Matthew. 19. B.
Qui potest capere: capiat. Let every person (says he) yt has natural
strength and grace / and may keep this chastity / and can also understand
what I mean / and how I speak: let that person I say: take this chastity
upon him and keep it / so that no person is bound thereunto but such as may
and will take it upon them. Lu. 12. D.
Natwithstandyng: where our savior in the gospel of Luke: does give certain
monicions unto his own disciples: bysyde and above that were given or spoken
unto the common people: Ibide^. E.
he said. Sint lumbi vestri precincti. etc. Let your bodies (says he) and your
wylles: be restreyned from all carnal concupiscence of uncleanness / which
sayng: seems to be a commandment unto them that than were nombred for his
disciples / and did wylfully take upon them to follow him. Whereby does also
seem: that all the clergy and all religious persons: should of co^ueniency:
be bound to keep chastity / in more precise manner: tha^ the lay people. For
they also and all christianes ben bound to keep chastity / after a due and
lawful manner / and ferce other wise than the infideles done.

Of the diffinicion / or determinacion / of this word chastity / and first in
general. The first Chapitre.
WE shall now therefore intreatyng of this noble virtue chastity: show first of
the term / what this word chastity does mean or signify. For that name
chastity: may be taken generally / and in a large manner. And so does it by
token: discrecion / moderacion / or a due mean in all things to be done / as
chaste in eating / drynkyng / slepyng / and generally in all manner of virtues /
common both unto the soul and body. But as the term chastity does betoken:
of the self propre significacio^: so does it apperteyn unto ye body / and unto
the cle^nes and due order thereof. For chastity has properly ye name: of
chastesynge / or correction / because ye chastity: does chastise and corect the
body / as ye rod (in manner) does ye child. Diffinicio castitatis.
Chastity tha^ thus taken: may be called a restreynt of the natural / and
bodily act of generation. Or (as saint Augustine says) Chastity is a virtue /
ye does refrain and subdue ye assayles and hasty morto^s of the fylty pleasure
of ye body: under ye yoke and rule of reason. De diffi.
Ibidem,
Or as the same saint Augustyne says again. Chastity may be called / a clean
and honest state or byhauiour of al ye hole body / by ye restrict and rebatyng
of ye furies and wyld hasty mocio^s of vice. But because this manner of
chastity: does exte^d to al degres of christianes / as well wedded as singule /
wedowes and virgins. And we done here entreat only of the chastity that does
apperteyne unto religious persons: we shall therefore leave that common
chastity / and speak of this chastity after our entreprise.

Of chastity as it does apperteine unto religious persons. The second
Chapitre.
Chastity / than (after this purpose) may be called a virtue / that by the
promise of sole^pne vow: Diffinicio castitatis religiosorum id est monastice
does restreyne / and utterly prohibit / and forbede in all manner of wise: ye
natural act of generation for ever / in all persons / yt done profess the
vow of chastity solemply. For with this chastity so bowed: may no mortal
person dispense / no (I say) not the pope him self / ne the hole church (the
person remaynyng religious) how be it that the pope and the universal
church: may for a cause reasonable (after some doctores) dispense with a
religious person: for his religion / and so make of a religious person: a
person seculer / as he was before. But that is not or should not be much
used. And therefore (as I said) this chastity is vndispensable. For his manner of
chastity / as well as is obedience / and wylfull pouerte: is unto every
religious person: essenciall. That is to say: without which thing no person
may be a person religious. No more tha^ a man: without a reasonable soul:
may be a man. When I speak here of a person / or persons religious / I
mean such persons as ben professed by solemn vow which i^ ye common cano^
law ben called monks.

Of the praise and perfect of chastity. The third be Chapitre.
THis manner of chastity without any vow / but purely kept and performed in
effect / as it was many years (as we showed before) is a noble virtue / much
pleasant unto our lord / and of great profecte / and high merit to the
self persons. For it does make man: familiar with god as Angels ben if they
have also other virtues according. For the chaste person: does nothing or but
little (in manner) diffre from Angel in ye virtue / althoghe Angel much does
excede in felicite. And chastity also does vanquisshe / and put the dyuel unto
flight: more strongly and myghtely: than other virtues. And chastity: does very
redely prepare and open the way in man's soul: unto all other virtues. And
where man by sin: is thrale and bond unto se^sualite: this virtue of
chastity does help him well unto fredome and liberte: And it also does
garnysshe / apparel and make goodly the soul wtinforth / and make it like
unto the kings dogther of bless: marvelous fresshely and pleasau^tly: Contra
faustum.
and therefore saint Augustyne / does call chastity: the pulcritude / fayrnes
and beauty of the soul. Yet natwithstandynge: this chastity that we done
describe and intreate-entreprised / taken / and promised by sole^pne vow: is
much above and of more high merit / and reward: because of the vow: tha^
is any other chastity. And therefore ye ghostly enemy is more busy and
labourious to assail / trouble / and destroy this chastity / tha^ any other.
Supra Matthew.
Saint Augustine says / yt emonge all the batayles and te^tacions of
christianes: the battle of chastity: is (for a certeynte) more sharp and
ieoperdons: than any other battle. Because yt in ye batatayle: is continual
feghtynge / and rare or selde^ victory. For selde^ does synguler beute and
pure chastity: dwell and peasebly agree to gether in one person. And therefore is
chastity called a bryd / rare and selde^ seen upon earth / much like unto a
black swanne. Rara auis in terris: nigroque simillima cygno. yet is the battle
of religious persons: Versus.
more hard and dangerous: than any other. And therefore of more noble victory
and most high reward. Vitas pa.
By reason whereof: ye religious persons ben more streytly bound to give head
/ and to have themself with more deligency / in awayte for the custody and
keeping of chastity / and to be more careful and dreadful of the losing and
breakyng thereof: than any other persons. For as chastity duly kept: is of
high merit and glorious reward: So broken: is it of most horrible and deep
dampnacion.

Of the custody of chastity / and that chastity is in the precepts of the
rule. The fourth. Chapitre.
Our diligence and pore mind / shall be therefore to entreat of those things yt
may sme convenient and much profitable unto ye custody and sauegarde of this
noble virtue / in the^ specially / that (by solemn vow of profession) have
bound themself thereunto. And because we done writ specially unto the
disciples that have professed the rule of our holy patron saint Augustyne: we
shall follow the order of the same. Natwithstandyng: that some persons have
said unto me in quick voice / ye I could not find in the said reule of saint
Augustyne / that he does give any commandment of chastity / as he does of
obedience and poverty. Whereunto mine answer was: that by ye reason / our lord
god / gave no commandment again opression / extorcion / and brybrie. For the
very self commandment is only again theft. But thereunto: I was shortly
answered / that our lord did prohibit and forbede ye more: in that he did
forbede ye less. So than did I bring the person unto the truth of saint
Augustynes rule. Where is express commandment again the mysuse of the sight
of light cast thereof. And the pain or punisshement for the same appointed.
Whereby does follow / and that by the words of the same rule: his commandment
and prohibicion to be not only again the sight: but also of all other
behauiours contrarious unto the virtue of chastity. So that unto the sure
custody and guard of meritorious chastity: many other virtues ben required /
and many vices and occasions: to be fled / exchued and avoided. And therefore
saint Augustyne: before he byganne to entreat of chastity: did bind his
disciples / unto the love of god and of the neghbour / as precepts of very
necessite unto salvation. And tha^ unto unite / of one heart / one mind / one
love / and so unto quietude / and restfulnes among themself. And tha^ forthwt:
unto wylful pouerte. And although he seems to make none express mention of
obedience unto the.vii. chapitre: yet is obedience every where understand as
governor / maystres / lady / and souereyne / of all the hole rule / and every
point thereof. For every thing is remitted unto ye will / discrecio^ / and
appoyntement of ye souereyne. And all this did saint Augustyne set forth before
/ because yt without these: chastity nothing or little does avail.

Of the first keeper and the second: that is prayer and abstinence. The.v.
Chapitre.
THe first keeper than / of chastity: does he assign to be prayer. The divine
service of al religious persons. Whereby grace is obtained and gotten / without
which: no person can be chaste / and all these virtues ben contained in the
first / and second chapitre of saint Augustynes rule And in the beginning of
the third chapitre / does he (for the second guard of chastity) order al his
disciples unto due temperau^ce or abstinence. The second keeper.
I will (says he) that you rebate and keep low your bodies / by the
abstinence of meat and drink / as much as ye strength of nature may bear.
Herein does not saint Augustyne appoint any certain days of abstine^ce ne yet
forbede any kind of meats or drynkes / but yt he will a due quantite be used
after discrecion / and yt to be taken in due time and place. Vitas pa. ca. de
disc.
And so meanethe saint Augustyne / yt the disciples of this rule: should keep
due te^peraunce / every day and every time. For he knew well ye one time to
feed at pleasure / and an other time to fast: should rather inflame: than
rebate or correct ye body. And therefore would he: their fast should be
continual / with as much lack and scarcety: as nature might bear. So that
the body be some what punished in every mele / and never to be fully saciate
and contented / after sensual desire of appetite. Cassianus in secu^da
collaci. abbatis Theo. Ca. 3.
For the old fathers would say it were not possible for any person to keep
the very purite and cle^nes of chastity / ye would feed and content the
appetite of the body with only bread and water / much more tha^ if it be fed
with delicates. Wherefore saint Augustine commanded the disciples of this
reule: Ca. 3.
to take refection at due time. So that bysyde meletyme: they should take no
manner of fode for any cause: except infirmite / or very and unfeigned necessite
/ which has no law. For those persons that done not keep certain hours
in fedynge: done seldom / or never: keep due temperau^ce without superfluite /
but as bruyte bestes: done rather feed / and pompre: tha^ rebate or correct
the body. And yet may those persons that done keep their due times: much
offend in quantite. For ye superfluite or surfeit of one mele may distempre /
and vndispose the body many days after. And where saint Augustyne says.
Quando sederitis ad mensam. etc. When ye do sit at the table. etc. There does
he command all the disciples of his reule: to take their meles in one due
place. And that for two causes / one: that i^ ye fedyng of their bodies: they
should also / by the same lesson of the word of god: be all in like manner /
fed i^ soul. And other cause is: to avoid the company and familiarite / of
seculer persons / whereby they ben oftymes provoked to excede due temperaunce /
bysyde other occasions / whereof we shall speak hereafter. And in this point of
the rule: done the suffreynes / and officers: most offe^de / which done many
times: more delight / and take pleasure to sit at mele times i^ their parloures
/ cha^bres / or private lodgings / with seculers / or with their familiares:
than among the covent in the fraytour Which natwithstandynge: is their most
due / and most convenient place of fedyng / where they should have the conforte
and perfect / of that holy lesson / and much also / both editie / and be
edified. And contrary where they ben: they done oftyme here many void and
vain words / and both give and take occasion. Here me seems I do here their
excuse. The business of the monastery / sir (say they) is in cause / we can
not keep the hours and time of the covent / and do all our duete for
necessary ordinance of the monastery. yet say I they can not find / ne yet
make reason / that they may (except in journey being lawfully forth) company
with any lay persons. For saint Augustyne says in this rule / that ye
disciples thereof: ben not prohibit / ne let or forbode^ / to look upon the
contrary sex when they (for any cause reasonable) done go forth / as though
bydyng within the monastery / so to look were unlawful. For it were void and
plain folly: to give the^ license to look upon that thing without the
monastery: that they might at liberte: se / and look upon within. And holy
saint Benedicte would not suffer his own natural sister (and she
natwithstandyng a holy religious woman) to come wtin ye monastery but ever when
she came: he went forth unto her. I think therefore / it were more convenient
for any such officers / wha^ they might not keep the due hours and time: than
to sit in silence at a later mele / in ye same place where the covent was / or
(as the leest) in some parloure or place / appointed for such chances / and
never in any wise to be served / ne yet to have the company of any lay
persons. For else can they not precisely keep the mind of the rule / which i^
this third chapitre: does order the disciples thereof unto abstinence / as a
necessary keeper and sure guard of chastity. For who so does excede due
temperau^ce: shall never precisely keep due chastity. So tha^ (after saint
Augustyne) abstinence is necessary unto the religious person that has vowed
chastity. But because there ben diverse degrees of abstinence: ye would
peradventure / I should here appoint you some form and manner of abstine^ce.
Whereunto I must answer that we do not here entreat of abstinence i^ especial
/ but generally as it does apperteyne unto the custody of chastity. And also:
it is very hard to put any certain form therein / because of the diverse
disposicions of persons. For unto some persons: a little qua^tite is ouermoch.
And unto some other: a large quantite is to little. To moderate therefore / and
to keep therein due measure: is learned by experience and discrecion. For the
very high point of abstinence: and of all virtues does stand ever in a due
mean. That is (after the learning of saint Augustyne in this place) to take
fode ever with the most scarcite. But yet so: yt nature thereby do not suffer
any hurt or notable decay. But to be served with aboundau^ce of diverse and
delicate meats and drynkes: And there to keep co^stau^tly that due measure
with out excess: I think verily is an high point of perfection / and (in
manner) of the merit of virginite / or rather of martyrdom. But if we do not
atteyne unto this high point: yet may we with diligence and grace: come unto
that degree of abstinence / whereunto al religious persons ben bound after my
conscience / that is to say: So to keep abstinence: yt (except a very and
unfeigned need) they never take fode out of due time ne out of due place. And
that they never surfeit lo ne ouercharge the body: that they be thereby unable to
do and to perform the duete of religion.

Of the third keeper of chastity labor. The.vi. Chapitre.
Now than let us go forth. Next unto abstinence: saint Augustyne in the same
chapitre: does (for an other / custos / keeper / and guard / of chastity)
oppoynt / and set forth: labor / in avoiding of ydlenes / the great enemy of
chastity / which ydlenes: saint Augustyne does there call an abhominacion /
and the most hateful pouerte / and misorder of any monastery. Where (as he
says) not only the persons of pore and low birth: but also the persons
that were of great riches / honor and noble birth: should (according unto
their strength and power) be laborious that is to say / continually occupied in
labors. For after all doctoures / no pestilence is more perilous unto
chastity: than ydlenes. For it does not only re^dre the chaste person / apt
/ and ready to take lightly offered occasions of corrupcion: but also does
furiously assail / move / and stere the mind: to seek and give occasions unto
ye same corrupcion. Where contrary / labor / and continual occupacion: does
give no place ne time unto temptacion / but rather does purify the mind / and
so does keep both the soul and the body: in good astate and condition.
Wherefore every religious person (after my poor mind) should other by the
commandment of the souereyne / or else of self election: be appointed unto
some certain occupacion / for every day / and for every hour of the day /
continually to be exercised without interrupcion / except chance reasonable:
should let. As the religious men / to give / and apply them self: unto the
study of holy scripture / or approved auctores / if they be learned thereunto /
or yet if they have youth / and capacite to learn / and if not: tha^ to be
occupied in prayer and contemplacion / all ye fore none. And in the afternone
to be exercised i^ some bodily labors / or else i^ writing or rehersyng of
some matters red / or learned before. And all this I mean for the void hours /
bysyde divine service / and all duties of religion. For I will not grant that
any religious person: may be absent from any part of common duty (except
only obedience / and cause of very and unfeigned need) For (as scripture
says) better is obedience: than oblacion / or sacrifice. i. Reg. 15.
And an approved doctoure says. What so ever ye do (your duete of bond:
undone or left) is nothing unto your lord god / thankful / ne acceptable. I
have the same mind of al religious women / as their learning does extend. So
that ever their occupacions be among them self / and not in any wise: in the
presence of company of men / except it were for the learning of such things
as the religious women could not well teach them self / as is co^munly / to
sing / read / and understand / and yet not therefore: without the present
company of some sister or syters. And that all their labors: be (according
unto the rule) unto the auau^tage of the co^munalte / and not for their own
pleasure / ne singular perfect. In any wise / se well / that by some good
occupacio^: they exile and avoid ydlenes / the nurse of all sins / specially
uncleanness. For as scripture says. Multam maliciam docuit ociositas. Ydlenes
is teacher of much malice and many mischeues / And yet says the english
proverb / better it is to be idle: Eccle. 35.
than yuell occupied. Alas than: why should any religious person: of yuelles:
chose the worst? That is to say: Why should the religious person: in avoiding
of ydlenes: follow ge^ttlite? that is / for their passetymes: apply them self
unto vein seculer and unlawful games? as decyng / carding / boulyng / tables
/ and teneyse / with such other? Which games done rather apperteine unto
gentiles tha^ unto christianes / nothing framyng with good religion. Videatis
Bernardu^ siluestre^ q assertus est operibus diui Bernar.
I can not se in conscience it might be lawful for religious persons / to
here minstrelles / play / and sing nor yet to look upon these interludes and
plays / wherein ben many things full devout / and that might edify. But,
because there ben many other things of mere vanites mixed with the other: I
think they do more harm than good / and no thing done bycome religion. For
without fail they been spectacles of mere vanites. Which the world callethe
pastytymes / and I call them waste times / specially in religion. For there
should be no pastymes / except only bodily labors / walking in prayer /
meditacion or honest / sobre / and godly co^municacion. And al things to be
done reasonably / with religious manner and byhauiour / avoiding every where: al
occasions of yuell.

Of the third keeper of chastity habit. The.vii. Chapitre.
THe third custos or keeper of this holy chastity: is set forth by saint
Augustine in the rule. Ca. 4.
Religious habit and sad array. Whereof we have spoken upon ye fourth Chapitre
of the said rule and yet more largely / in the first part of this work / and
in your local co^stitucions. This in troth: ye may surely believe / if the
manner and byhauiour of habit or array: should nothing conduce or help unto
perfection: holy fathers would never have used them self / ne yet appointed /
and ordened / for religious persons: any other habit or array: than were
commune unto al christianes. But because they knew by grace / that the
outward habit or array / and the manner of the wering thereof: does partly
show outward: the inward affecte / and appetyte of yt heart and mind /
therefore the holy fathers would apoynt such habit / as should show forth
unto the edificacion of al christianes: what affection and devotion of heart /
they should have: that done take upon them the perfection of religion. Ca. 4.
And that (as saint Augustyne says in the rule) in their array and in all
byhauiour. they should not offend the sight of any person: but do rather that
should bycome their sa^ctite and holiness. For the occasion of misordred array or
habit / both given and taken: has been the ruin and destruction of many
persons / as we find in scripture. In Genesis is written. Genes. 6.
Videntes filij dei filias hominum. etc. That is: The people of god that than
had feyth and believe in him / by occasion of the array / and misbyhauiour of
the infideles: specially the women / did fall first in affection of the^ / and
after with them: into ydolatry / and unto myschefe. Se now / how by the sight
and lokyng upon their array: gods people did take that occasion. For those
infideles / were of the stock of Cayn / and had with him (long before those
days) forsaken god and his laws / and therefore they did with our dread / set
forth them self: in habit / array / and al mysordred byhauiour / unto
carnalite and bestlines In ye same book of scripture. Gene. 34.
Dina ye doghter of Jacob: by occasion of array: was rauysshed / lost her
virginite / and was cause of much blodshede / and vengeance. And Judas her
brother / one of the.xii. sons of Jacob: by occasion of array: had carnal
knowledge of his own daughter in law / contrary unto the law and custom
that time used. And the holy widow Iudithe / when se would desceyue the
tyranne Oliferne: Judith. 1^. A.
did put away her religious array / and clothed and garnisshed her self in the
array / after ye manner of gentilite. And so did queen Hester for the pleasure of
her king / but when se was at her own liberte / out of his presence: Hester.
5. and 14. and. 15.
she ware the array of penance / mekenes / and perfection. And in this time
many women done excuse the wantones of their array: by the imperie and will of
their housbondes / and some in very deed ben compelled: other persons done
allege the common custom / and manner of the place or time. But religious
persons have none such excuse. For they should follow the rules and
ordinances of the old fathers / that consideringe these said / and many other
occasions of imperfections in the manner and weryng of array: did devise and
ordeyne the habit of religious persons: to be obiecte / vile / and out of al
seculer fashon. And there unto course / rughe / and hard / nothing to cheryshe
the body / but rather to cover the unclean carcas / and to punisshe and keep
low the false flesh. Alas tha^ why should any religious persons / yt have
entreprised and vndertake^ wylful pouerte by solemn vow: and (for the same)
have clean forsaken the world And never (except need) should appear in the
sight and pres^ce of any seculer persons: have any delectacion or pleasure in
array? Saint Augustine / was ashamed or abashed of a precious garment. And when
any such garments were offered / or given unto him: he would not were them but
rather sell them / and make the money common. But the world (as they say in
the english proverb) is turned up so down / that is to mean: unto a
contrary form or manner. For now / few persons seculer: have more fine or
precious array: than have some religious persons. And yet (that is more
abominable) more seculer: than gentyles or, turks. And therefore / their
chastity is kept thereafter / our lord amend it. Saint Augustyne in the rule
does command the disciple thereof / saying: Ca. 4.
Let never your habit nor array be notable / ne ever have you pleasure / in
clothing or apparel: but in good religious manners and byhauiour.

Of the fourth keeper of chastity. The.viii. Chapitre.
ANd forth with after the precept: Gesture.
he does adioyne an other keeper and preserver of chastity. That is to say /
gesture and outward byhauiour of the body. Whereof also we have written unto you
at large: in the first book of these three vows. Saint Ambrose says / that
the gesture and byhauioure of the body: is as a voice or speech / that does
show / and telforthe: the inward affectes / and appetites of the heart and
mind. And here in the rule / saint Augustyne will: Ca. 4.
they give good head / and diligence unto religious gestures / and byhauiours /
sayng unto the disciples of the same. When ye go forth / go to gyther. And when
ye come / whether ye went: bide to gether / and in your pase going / and in
your habit werynge / and in your standing / or restyng. And in all our
mouynges / sterynges / gestures / and byhauiours / look you show ever / ye
example of good and godly conversation. So that you nothing do: that should
slander / give occasion / or offend the syghte of any person / all unto
edificacion / and as should bycome / or byseme your sanctite / holiness / and
perfection. In these words and sentences / ben many

Of the.v. keeper of chastity: the guard of the sight The.ix. Chapitre.
does follow / the guard / and warnes of the corrupt affection / and carnal
desire of the mind. For (as he there says) frail concupiscence: workyng in
ye affecte and in the inward desire of mind: does led and in manner does
rauyshe violently the sight of ye eye: unto the beholding of those persons
that before were had in affecte / appetite / and desire. Although peradventure
that affecte or desire: were first inge^dred by the sight. Which two: that is
to say / sight and affecte / joined to gether: done (with a little custom)
kyndle a furious flame of wild fire in the heart / not easy or light to be
quenched. And therefore (says he there) That person that has a light eye or
sight: can never say for trought: he has a chaste mind or a chaste heart.
For a light eye / or sight: is an evident sign / and token of a light mind.
It is (says saint Augustine in this same place) a messenger of the light / and
unclean heart. The light eye / or sight: is like an alestake / or the tavern
garelonde / that does show outward: what is to sell within. And the person
also of light look: is assimiled unto a Basiliske / that is / a poisoned
serpent: ye does sle and destroy: only by sight or lokynge. And yet the
light look is worse than ye Basiliske / by cause the self persons ben many
times slain by their own self sight. As does appear in David Salamon /
Sampson / and many other. The old fathers therefore: did ever fle / and avoid
the sight of ye contrary sex. So ye another they would se / nor be seen. Vitas
pa.
We read yt wha^ a woman by importune instance / and clamor: would nedely se
her own sone / yt was a religious man / he much loath thereunto: but by ye
commandment of his souereyne / and for obedience: went forth unto his mother
/ with his eyes closed / wynkynge. And so suffered his mother to look upon him /
but in no wise would he look upon her. In vitas Patrum also: Vitas pa.
An other holy father when he was instauntly desired to be seen and locked upon
of a great honorable and virtuous woman / that by fervent deuocio^ / and desire
to se that good father: had labored out of far countres / he would not yet
grant her peticion. But by prayer unto our lord: he obtained grace / to
appear unto her slepynge by vision. And unto her great confort: he did much
better so content / and satisfy her mind than otherwise. Hereby ye may take /
that to fle / and avoid sight / and in no wise to be seen / or looked upon: is
of more perfection and merit: than to se / or be seen / which thing we have
of auctorite / by the reuelacio^ of our lord unto our holy mother saint
Brigitte / in our rule. Wherefore saint Augustine in this place of the rule:
does speak sharply again the light cast of the sight / appoyntyng great
punisshement for the same.

Of the.vi. keeper of chastity / the guard of the tongue. The.x. Chapitre.
OTher abuses does he also touch in ye same place / that (as seems) were i^
his mind more shameful / or more abominable: than should bycome his
perfection to speak of at large. As where he hayth. Tacente lingua. That is:
The tongue keeping silence / nothing speaking / as though to speak words of
lyghtnes: were far worse than to look. Or else / as though to speak: were
not so lawful for religious persons / out of their monastery: as it is to
look. For in speech or co^municacio^ is more ieoparty than in lokynge. Believe
saint Paul. Corrumpunt bonos mores: colloquia praua. 1. Cor. 15. E.
Inordinate and yuell speech or talk: does corrupt and destroy good manners
and virtues. And that is truth / both in the hearers and spekers. For in
hearing the mind is moved. And ye speech: does show forth the affection of
the mind. Matthew. 12. C.
Ex abundan cia cordis (says our lord) os loquitur. The mouth does speak of
ye abou^dau^ce / and affection of the heart. The first beginning of carnal
affection: does co^munely arise / spryng / and take rote: of the sight And
afterward: is nurysshed / and grows by talk and co^municacion. And therefore
although saint Augustyne gave license unto his disciples (being forth of the
monastery) to look: yet did he not give them license to speak / nor yet to
here co^municacion. Wherefore all religious persons / must be very
circumspecte / well advised and ware: not only what they done speak / but
also what thing they done hear spoken / for the light words of a person:
done give boldness unto the hearers. And when the speakers done perceive that
their words ben peasably herd: they take boldness thereof forther to proceed in
their folly of unclean desire. Let therefore the good religious person: fle and
avoid al vain talkyng specially: words of uncleanness. Sepi aures tuas spinis.
Augusti.
Hedge and close thine ears and hearing: with thorns (says saint Augustyne)
That is to say / if thou hear a leude word: give sharp answer thereunto /
and let the speakers know well / thou art not content to hear any such / and
than doste thou hedge thing ears with thorns. And ever think upon the said
words of saint Paul. yuel words: done done hurt good manners.

Of the.vii. keeper of chastity / guard of touching, The.xi. Chapitre.
THe first messenger of mischefe (as I said) is the sight or look. The second
/ wanto^ / rude / vain / or void / and specially unclean words. The third
worse than both the other / is touching / brought i^: co^munly by the other
twain. For touching both not only move or stere: but also does inflame /
and set on fire the affection. And so consequently: does many times bring the
mind / unto a soden fury or madness. So that not only good honesty /
worshype / honor / name or fame: but also heaven and hell: is clean forgotten.
Which thing has been proved / in such persons of grauite: as (of long
time) have been known / of high and marvelous perfection / and of most clean
and chaste living. Eccl. 13. A.
The scripture says as is i^ the proverb. Qui tangit picem, coinquinabitur ab
ea. Who so will touch pytche: shall be spotted therwt / it byco^meth not therefore
ye persons religious to use any touching / nor to follow the manner of seculer
persons / yt in their co^gresses / and common metynges or departing done use
to kiss / take hands / or such other touchinges that good religious persons:
should utterly avoid. And with a meke and low inclinacion salute the persons
with few words / castyng down the sight / and but very seldom / and short time
loking upon the persons. And in all the time of their co^municacio^: let ever
their hands be covered and kept close wtin the habit. Touching on all manner
leyde on part and avoided. For saint Augustyne here in the rule says.
Intactis ab immunda violacione corporibus. etc. That is to say: that chastity
may be chased away and dryue^ from the hertes: without any touching of the
bodies as though touching must need drive away chastity. And therefore diverse
holy fathers / as Gerso^ / Antonyne. auctor speculi spiritualium. and many
other done prohibit and torbede religious persons / one to touch an other /
for any familiarite / or without some necessite / although both were of one
sex. And some of the^ done say: That to touch wylfully and by deliberacio^:
any naked part / as hand / or arm without any cause needful / and with
affection or carnal pleasure (although no consent / nor mind / were unto any
unclean act of the body) yet because the persons so touching / done wylfully
put the^ self in ieoperty: it should be deedly sin. For scripture says Who
so loves or has pleasure in peril or ieoperty: shall fall or persshe therein.
Eccle. 3. D
And the english proverb is. Who so will none yuell do: should do nothing yt
longs thereto. The holy fathers therefore will not allow in any wise: the
common excuse of many persons / yt done say / they be nothing moved / ne
done perceive any hurt or ieoparty: by honest kissing or touching after good
manner. The said fathers will not allow those terms as agreeable together /
honest / and kyssyng / good manners: and touching except only in married makes
/ but i^ no wise among religious persons. They ben utterly deceived yt so done
say. For the persons so touching / without any consent of yuell done not
(peradventure) for that time: perceive any mocion of ieoparty / or peril of
sin: yet does the image / the prynte / the form or all manner manner of that
kyssyng or touching: bide and remain in the mind and soul. And will an other
time come unto remembrance uncalled / unto the great trouble and vexacion of
the devout soul. We read of a holy father / whom a good devout woman mekely
bysoght to have her in remembrance and he answered sayng. Vitas pa.
I byseche our lord dame (says he) that I never think upon the while I live
/ many persons have been sore wounded and hurt that (for the time) felt no
grefe thereof. Yet sone after the wound has smerted full sore / and full long
so continued vnheyled. The expert proof hereof: is writing for remembrance by
the old fathers. And so in like manner / of the sight and speech. Which three
done (for the most part) follow each other.

Of the.viii. keeper of chastity / that is / warenes of familiarite. The.xii.
Chapitre.
ANd yet of them three does issue and spring an other enemy of chastity / more
perilous (except good awayte and resistance) and more ieopardous / than all
them three. That is to say: familiarite / the continuance of affection / and
acquayntau^ce / which said familiarite: is kept forth and nuryshed / not only
by the said three vices: wanton look / light words / and carnal touching: but
also does grow and increace And that in the absence of the persons: by
wrytynges / messages / gifts and tokens. Saint Augustine therefore / here in
the rule does forbede that any of the disciples of the same: should other send
forth or yet receive / privily without knowledge of the souereine: any manner of
thing / little or much / sayng. Ca. 4.
But if any persons (says he) be so far ouersene / and so far do pass
into so great yuell and notable offense ye they privily receive or send any
lettres / or any other gifts or tokens. etc. Note well / that he calls such
receyte: a great notable yuel and offense. For he would the souereyne: should
be of counsel / and should considre: the reason and ground / the cause or
occasion: of such sendyng or receyuyng. For many persons have a disposicion
and appetite to have acquayntau^ce / and to seek / and make means thereunto /
and to continue the same. Which acquayntau^ce so gotten: many religious
persons done call their fre^des. Where in very deed: they ben rather their fose
/ and yet they: most foo unto them. For among religious persons: worldly
friends / good acquayntau^ce / and good religion: done seldom well accord or
agree to gether. For surely it is much co^trarious unto the religion of old
fathers. For they wylfully fled and lost acquayntau^ce of all persons / of
their own pare^tes kynne / not only gotten: but borne fre^des. And also /
such sendyng / wrytynges and receyte: should well be consydred: lest that some
times (under the color and contenau^ce of spiritual edificacion) a token go
forth / or a co^memoracion: of carnal affection. Saint Augustyne would
therefore: the souereynes should be iuges of all the acts and deeds of their
subjects. For they must make answer to our lord for them. Let than ye
souereines take heed of all occasions in the subjects / that may ingendre
affection / although it were unto such persons / as ben named of great
holiness and synguler perfection For of those manner of persons: many have both
deceived / and ben deceived. Let (I say) the souereines / therefore seclude all
occasions / but specially the most chief occasion / or cause of affection /
that is familiarite.

Of the.ix. keeper of chastity / which is: the auoydaunce of sole presence.
The.xiii. Chapitre.
IN auoydyng whereof: ye holy fathers: did utterly forbede sole presence / that
is to say that no religious person should ever be alone with any person of
the contrary se^e or kind. For that sole presence: did they accounte as one
of the most perilous pestilences / and most deedly enemy of chastity. And
saint Augustyne also here in this rule: does forbede sole presence / where he
says. Augusti.
In ye said fourth Chapi. Wha^ ye go forth go to gether / bide to gether. etc.
And in the.vi. Chapitre. Ibidem. Ca. 6.
When they go forth (says he) they shall go no less in company / than tweyne
in nombre / or three persons. Nor yet (says he) shall that person / that has
nedfull cause to go forth: have choice of a fellow / or go with whom he would:
but with such as the souereyne will command or appoint / it must need than
/ be more again the rule / to be alone with any seculer within the monastery
/ specially with the contrary sex / as man and woman to gether alone / which
should never be suffered in any good religious monastery / for any manner cause
/ no (I say) not for confession / nor in confession. For religious women
should make their confession at grates / or else in some open place / where they
may be herd and not seen. For the subtyle and crafty assail of the dyuell: is
no where absent / and the flesh is never without fraylte / while we bide in
this life. Vitas pa.
We read i^ vitas Patrum of a holy father i^ wyldernes / unto whom a pore man
of the cite resorted / to sell his mattes / baskettes / and his other labors.
And when he came not upon a time after his custom: the old father /
commanded his disciple to go unto the cite to seek ye man. Whereunto he was
very loathe / natwithstandyng / yet for obedience he went forth / and by great
diligence: he found the house / and no body at home but a young woman alone /
by the byhauiour of whom: he was in ieoparty of corrupcion / but that god (by
miracle) for the merit of obedience and the prayers of his holy father:
suddenly set him at home. So than sole presence is not without ieoparty in any
persons.

Of the.x. keeper of chastity / not to have power nor liberte to be alone.
The.xiiii. Chapitre.
ANd so is also the power and liberte of sole presence much perilous / that is
to say / wha^ persons of contrary sex: may be to gether alone if they will.
Whereof is evidence in ye same book vitas patru^. Ibidem.
Where is showed of a woman unclean of living / ye promised unto certain men
of her familiarite / to bring a solitary / and a holy man from ye good life
unto the world. Which said woman came unto his sell in ye euyntyde / as though
she had lost her way / and there she made great lame^tacio^ / yt she should be
destroyed with wyld bestes / except he would of petie and co^passio^ take her i^
/ and so he did / and leyde her i^ a corner by / and after wha^ he should rest:
he bygan to be sore assailed For the rebatyng whereof. he went unto a candell /
and brent one of his fyngers / and yet after when he remembered the sole
presence of them tweyne alone / and the occasion and liberte: he was again
inflamed / and he again arose and brent an other finger / and so he never
rested: till he had brent all his fyngers unto the stumpes. In the morning
yerly the young men came unto the sell / and asked for the woman / he answered
here she lies / take her up. And she (by the just judgment of god) was deed.
Than showed he unto them his hands / and how he was temted with her / and than
fell unto prayer / and so raised the deed corse / and forthwith were all his
fyngers restored unto him again / and the woman and all the men converted unto
the state of perfect living. All this have we showed / that ye should perceive
the ieoperty of sole presence / and of the occasion and liberte of sole
presence. Sith specially it was so proved in persons of so high perfection:
how than should any persons (in this time of corrupcion / where in all virtue
exiled: sin raygneth) have trust in them self. And why should not al
religious persons: be glad to be enclosed / for the more surety of their vow
and promise. Let no good religious person: think little or give little force
of sole presence / or of the liberte and power of sole presence. The common
canon law: does also forbede sole presence / unto persons religious /
specially women. So that no religious woman should any time / speak with any
man / although he were also religious: 18. q^. 2. Diffiniuimus. et ca.
sequenti.
without the company of sufficient and honest wytnes. For sole presence in the
law is a great presumpcion / and argument or evidence of suspicion. The law
therefore does prohibit and forbede / that religious persons / or yet seculer
prestes: should be alone. De statu monacorum. ca. Mona. Et did. 81. In oibus.
Eccle. 4. Libro. 3. ca. Monasteri.
And the wise man says. Vesoli. Woe and ieoparty: be unto the person alone.
For if (by case) he fall: he has no person to help him up. And in the law
also. De vita et honestate clericorum. If any man of custom: do use to enter
any monastery of religious women to accompany / and be familiar with the^: And
after due warnyng: does not withdraw and leave that resort: let him (says the
law) if he be of ye clergy: be deposed And if he be a lay man: let him be
excommunicate and cursed. And in an other place. 18. q^. 2. peruenit ad nos.
The law says / that women should not come with in the monastery of men. Many
other monicions and counsayles: been given / in the common canon law and by
holy fathers: for the prohibicion / condempnacion and reprove of sole presence
/ as a perilous enemy of chastity.

Of the.xi. keeper of Chastity / that is / cure of the body. The.xv. Chapitre.
YEt (after saint Augustyne) does follow an other enemy of chastity much
subtyle / and as not much grievous / so much more ieopardous. That is to say:
delectacion and pleasure in clean clothing / and in the pykyng and curyng of
the body For the prohivicion and letting whereof: he says in the beginning of
the.vi. Chapitre of the rule. Let your clothyng (says he) be laundred or
wasshen / at the appoi^teme^t / and after the will of ye souereyne And yet
again. Baynes also for ye body. etc. Where saint Augustyne will that the
disciples of this rule should have shyft of clean clothes / and purgacion of
the body: according unto discrecion / and as need and the honesty of religion
does require / but not after the appetite or desire of the persons / lest
(says he) the superfluous pleasure / of fair and clean clothes should defoule
and make the soul unclean and fylthy. And in very deed / I have known diverse
religious persons / that after their shyftynge into clean clothes: have been
more troubled with unclean mocions: than they were at other times. And so like
wise of the waysshyng / and pykyng of the body. Wherein to be ouercurious: is
contrary unto the purite of chastity. And nothing to care therefore: is
contrary unto the honest of religion / specially i^ them that done live in
congregation. And therefore saint Augustyne will / the seek persons / although
they deney: should (natwithstandynge) take by the commandment of the
souereyne: that were necessary and honest / and if (any should desire that
were not expedient: they should be denied. All these things have we set forth
here: for the guard and custody of chastity / according unto the order and very
mind of the self rule of saint Augustyne. That the disciples thereof: having
zele unto the obseruaunce of their rule: should the more diligentely apply
them self and give study / to perform the solemn profession / and promise
of their vow.

Of the.xii. keeper of Chastity / which is disposicion in the self persons.
etc. The.xvi. Chapitre.
Now shall I show a litel of my pore mind / of ye most sure excellent guard
and custody of chastity. First unto all virtues to be obtained and kept and
all vices and sins to be removed and secluded must be a disposicion and good
will in the self persons. For although man by sin was brought into such
bondage that of him self: he might never help him self / ne yet dispose him
self: yet has our lord god / of his bounte and gracious goodness / so prynted
in man his own image / and therewith the fredome and liberte of will: ye after
his ordinate justice god may no more take from man fre will: than he may take
from him his image. And this is evident in scripture / in Cayn / the eldest
sone of Adam / after his consent unto sin. Unto whom our lord said. Gene. 4.
Why art thou wroth? why does thy chere fall / and thy countenance feyle
the? If thou well do: I will so accept it / and if thou do not well: the
defaulte is open and ready to be known / yet is thy passion in thine own power
and thou may by lord and gyther thereof / as having thy will and
disposicion: in thine own fre power and liberte. This have I said to confound
the false opinion of this great heretyke Luther / and his folowers. The first
than is: to dispose your self / and for the dred and love of god / and for ye
merit of ye excellent virtue chastity: to make a statute and a co^nau^t with
your self / by tired purpose: to forsake utterly / not only the vice / or
act of the flesh: but also all manner of occasions / that by any mean may
apperteyne thereunto. Than next after this / to search well your own astate /
and to perceive how far ye have therein been (in time past) ouersene / and be
it little / be it much: raze and scrape all clean out of the book of your
conscience / by contricion / confession / and specially by purpose never to
commit or consent any more unto any such.

Of awayte of cogitacions or thoughts. The.xvii. Chapitre.
THan give good head / and awayte unto your cogitacions and thoughts. For
those will best teache you of what desire your fraylte is. For by the
cogitacions: done arise the troubles and assayles of the fesshe. And those
cogitacio^s ben caused in the mind diuersely. Sometime: of abundance of
blood / that is caused by superfluite of fedynge. For the which: the old
fathers / would say / it were not possible to be without unclean cogitacions:
without due temperau^ce. In so much as they would forbed their disciples /
that were troubled with unclean thoughts: to feed upon bread only and water /
at will and appetite. Default also of due custody and guard of the outward
se^ses: is also a cause of unclean thoughts / as of hearing / seeing / touching
etc. Whereof we have spoken before. An other occasion of unclean thoughts: is
the malice of the great enymy the dyuell. But his malice (although it be
subtyle and busye) yet may it lightly / and sone be vanquysshed / and he put
unto flight / with one word alone / as Jesus / or with one little sign of the
cross / or one good thought / if he be despised and set at naught. But if
unclean cogitacio^s: do remain in ye mind as images / steps / or printes /
of any unclean acts or byhauiours / or of any unlawful consentes / and have
(by vain pleasure accustomed and used) taken their habitacion / their lodgyng
/ and dwelling place in the mind: they will not than be so lightly removed and
put away. For than will they (in manner) precribe and say: when labor is made
again the^: we have now ben here abydyng so long: yt this place is unto us
as natural (For custom does alter nature) And therefore we will not hens / be
not about to drive us away / it boteth not / all is last loboure / ye had
power: at first beginning of our enter: to shyt us out and with small
diligence and little labor: might you have chased us away. But now that we be
admitted by custom: it is not (as saint Isodoure says) possible to remove us.
Impossible or not possible: is many times taken / for hard to bring to pass.
And so does sait Isodour mean.

Of the remedy again yuell thoughts. The.vxiii. Chapitre.
REmedy therefore may be had. For the goodness of our lord: never left man
without help / and ready mean to recover all default / if man will take the
remedy / and follow ye doctrine and counsel of scripture. In the first book
whereof: Ca. 15.
called Genesis is a notable doctrine to avoid vain thoughts. Our lord god
made promise unto Abram / that afterward was named Abraham / that he should
have in heneritau^ce / that that land / wherein he dwelled that time / and
Abraham asked our lord how he might have sure knowledge that he should have
peasable and restfull possession thereof. And our lord than commanded him to
take certain bestes and divide them in sondre and certain birds / and all
them he cast forth upon ye plain field / and forthwithe crows and birds
did light upon the deed carkes. And Abraham ever did chase them away / till
they left and came no more. By these birds (says the gloss interlinial
there) ben understand vein cogitacions / that as ravenous foul / done
assail the carnal mind. And ye labor of Abraham: does signify the
continual diligence that man should give to chase and remove them. The gleyde
or the crow: will covet / and assay to bylde before the gate. But ye good
housbond will destroy and cast down the neste. And most so doing: he shall
let them to bring forth birds. So may the diligent person / so often put away
and despise vain cogitacions: yt they never shall come unto effect / ne much
noy the soul / although they much trouble / if they be in custom. A horse
or be used unto one way: will covet to keep his course and will not lightly
out thereof. Yet may a diligent person with a bridle / and a rod / or whyppe:
led and bring the beast where he will. But and if the person be negligent and
careless: and will sleep upon the beast: tha^ will the beast return unto his
used course. So is it in like manner / of our be sensualite / that will follow
custom / except good diligence by given / that feyth may rule reason / and
that the dred of god do punish and correct the frail appetite. The body may
be corrected more lightly and sooner brought from custom than may the mind /
and yet shall the mind never he reformed: till the body be brought under /
and be obedient unto the soul / and than will the mind comfortable to reason:
follow feyth / and seek wayse: not only to chase away those thoughts: but
also utterly to exile or destroy them for ever. And that must be with a
contrary custom. For (as they say in proverb) one nail or pynne: does drive
out an other and so does occupy the same place and rowme: where the other
pynne was. So in like manner / one cogitacion / driven well by force / may drive
out an other cogitacio^. I say by force. For it can not be without force /
without great labor and diligence / insued and followed by continual use.
Which use must in gendre and make an other habitual custom / co^trarious
unto that was in the mind before.

Wherewith the mind and thoughts should be occupied. The.xix. Chapitre.
HEre ye will ask whereupon ye shall ground your mind and what shall be the
matter of those thoughts that should be brought i^ such habitual custom / to
drive away / and destroy the other vanites. I shall show my pore mind. First
and pri^cipall matter to be remembered: is our lord god / and the co^templacion
of him which to wryt here: were over long. The life also passion and death of
our savior Jesus. And next hereunto: is ye study of holy scripture / to such
persons as ben entered i^ gramer / and though they have none e^tre: yet if they
be under ye age of.xliiii. or.xlvi. years: I would co^sayle the^ / be men / or
be they women (if they be of substance / and may apply the time) to give the^
self unto the learning of their gramer. For they may in two or three years have
such knowledge / that may be sufficient to understand the text and sentence
of the gospel / which I would every christian should understand. And as
unto the spending of the time in learning that gramer: I think verily they
can not spend ye time better / specially unto that end and purpose / that is
to say / to exclude vain thoughts and to put the life of our lord in their
rowmes. For by that study applied with courage: the mind is fully occupied.
Those persons that can read english / and have not the mean to learn
latyne: let them be occupied much with redynge or hearing of good and
approved works. And unto them that can not read let them hear reders / and
use prayer and bodily labors. Unto such persons as can nothing understand
latyne: english prayer well ordered in the common la^gage: is more profitable
(i^ my mind) tha^ is latyne prayers. Some occupacion of mind must they nedely
have of custom: that shall exclude vain and unclean thoughts: For ydlenes and
welfare: done ingendre and bread yuel cogitacions: as caren in air / does
bread worms. I speak all this / unto them / that have time to spend / and not
principally unto them that done live by their daily labors. Now one word
for the conforte of them / that by no means can by delivered of these carnal
passions / and unclean and vain thoughts / but ever they hang upon them /
and much done vex / and trouble the sely soul. Let the^ (after my pore
mind) nothing despere. But let them considre / yt man's mind: is as a rote
/ or a whele in a wind: that never does rest / but always tourneth and does
renew cogitacions and thoughts / both slepyng and wakyng. So that a person
waking: is sometime rauisshed unto such matters in cogitacions and thoughts:
as he never knew by fore / and so far does pass sometime therein: that he
knows not what he does / but as though he were in a dreme. And in all that
time he does nothing offend our lord / for yt was the sin and sensualite
that co^munely does reygne and has dominacion i^ our mortal bodies / and
therefore / was there no battle for that time se^sualite / peasely reigned. To.
5. and 6.
But wha^ the person does well perceive wherewith the mind is occupied: tha^
does begin ye battle / b^twene the person / and his thoughts / or rather
bytwyxe him: and the auctores or mouers of those thoughts / that is / the
dyuell / the world / and the flesh / that done work in the sensualite
according unto their proprietes: For than if the mind (at home with him self)
be negligent / and (for the pleasure moved in the sensualite) be both to
depart from those thoughts / and so do play with them / and suffer them to
hang upon him than (although they were not deedly) yet does the person
wylfully put him self in ieoparty / and (as we oftymes have said before) Who
loves peril: i^ peril shall fall. Ecclesi.
But wha^ the person having the full aduisement / and deliberacion before
said: does frown and fuast / that is to say / rere or raise up the stomach
and heart again those cogitacions / with indignacion and despite / as nothing
content / but much displeased with them: than does that person bygynne to
fight strongly. And if he tha^ with a good stomach and trust in our lord: will
thrast the^ unto the stone and knock their hedes thereunto: he shall without
any ieoparty or doubt: have the victory. The stone is Christ / the hedes of his
thoughts: ben their mocions first (as I said) perceived. The prophet says.
Psalm. 136.
Beatus qui tenebit and allidet paruulos suos ad petram. That is: Blessed be
that person that does hold and restreyne his children / or babes / that is to
say / his first mocions: and that does thraste and crushe their head unto the
stone / that is unto Christ / and his passion and death. yet may it be that
many of these manner of persons: may be sore vexed and troubled with their
cogitacions: but they be not unto their hurt / but rather unto their merit.
For surely I believe that no penance ne peynes of this life / may purge a
sinful soul / more clean: than such assayles of thoughts: so resisted and
with horror despised. And therefore many holy persons would not pray ne
desire our lord / to be delivered of the^ / but rather to have of him
spiritual strength / to vanquishe them. All this have we said hederto: for
the ^uicio^ and custody or guard of chastity. Specially written unto them that
have made solemn vow by profession thereunto.

Of the remedy for them that have broken chastity / and ben combred with
uncleanness / and first by the hurt of the goods and body. The.xx. Chapitre.
Now would I wryt a little lesson / taken out of a learned auctoure: unto such
persons as ben:::: spotten and done continue their beestly appetite / whether
they be seculer / or (as god forbede) persons religious. Enchirid, Erasmi.
First every person must remember that the beestly sin of the body called
co^munely lichery: contrary unto chastity: is the first sin yt does move man
growing out of chyldhed / whether they be wise / wytty / or innocents /
ydiotes or foles This pestilence does follow every person and cleueth or
stycketh fast unto the flesh / so yt no person does pass vnassayled and
vexed therwt / it is therefore most used / and most of all other sins: does
bring man unto mischefe and destruction. So that this sin: is most
ieopardous and perilous / and therefore: had need of more study and diligence.
Wherefore / let the person prycked with ye fyry poisoned dart of death: Thynk
first (although there were no god / ne any joy or pain) how unclean / how
fylthy / how stynkyng / how beestly ye sin is / and how much contrary
unto the honest / and specially unto ye dignite of man's soul: made unto the
image of god: redeemed and bought: by the passion and death of our savior Jesus /
washed / cleansed / and made bright and beauteous: in his most precious blood:
now again: for so false a flaterous pleasure: to be rendered and made like
unto bestes / unto swyne / unto gotes / unto dogs and cattes / and if there
by any be more brute. And yet to say troth to be made: under the state /
and wors^ and more low in degree: than any be / subject to fendes / that
were ordened and made to be accompanied as fellows unto Angels / and
partakers of the high divinity of god. Let him tha^ remember how short time
this pleasure indureth / and yet for ye time: how vile / how lothely / how
basheful / and shameful it is. So that ye self doers: would be ashamed to be
seen to be herd / or to be known. And yet where it seems pleasure: it is in
it self: a pain and passion And that can the self persons expert: judge /
and approve for troth / wormouth / and not honey / aloes and not licoriee or
sugre. And on the contrary part let him remember: how noble a thing his
soul is / how holy his body should be / the members whereof the holy / ghost
has oftymes used. What a myschefe and cowardnes of heart / lack of grace /
and al goodness / is it than: for so little / so short / and so vile / a
tyclynge / and mouyng of fraylyte: to defoule that beauteous soul / and to
make the body / that Christ him self did consecrate by his precious blood:
suspende and cursed? Let him also recount: what a felyshype of fendly sins:
that sweet poyso^ of uncleanness does gether and bring to gether into his soul.
First to begin at the lowest: it sharpulethe / and waste the his temporal
goods and lands / and has made many rich / and great men of lands and
honor / worse than beggars / caused many to stele / rob / and sle. And
second as unto the body: has thereby ben put unto labors otherwise
intolerable: as waychynge / waking / fasting / riding / going / by night
and by day / in hete and cold / frost and snow / hayle and rain. And many
times in ieoparty of life / and all for the fylthy and swynishe sin of the
body. And thereby also has the body been wasted / brought out of all fashon
unto great deformite and feebleness. And unto diseases and sekenes incurable as
the french pockes / and diverse manners of leprenes / and variau^t pestilences
/ defaded / and wasted the flower of young age / and made the persons (long
before their time) old / and so made the lusty youth: sekefull and odious /
and their age miserable and slouthsome.

How this fylthy lechery / is not only noyous unto the goods / and unto the
body / but also unto the name or same / and unto the soul. The.xxi. Chapitre.
YEt go forther / unto the name and fame of man / the most goodly and precious
possession of this life / far passing all the goods / riches / and worldly
substance / which natwithstandyng: by ye most abominable sin: is lost and
gonne. For ye name and uoyse or fame of that sin: does more largely sprede
and fly abroad / and more styncke in the ears and hearing of all persons:
than of any other sin. Yet does the mind / the soul of man: excel all
these / that is / all the temporal goods of this world / all the health and
state of the body / and also the state of that noble iuell / name or fame. yet
does this fury of fylthy uncleanness: rauysshe the mind / take away ye wit /
and also (that unto man is most proper) natural reason / and so makes a man
(as we said) worse than a be / takes him away from all learning / and
honest study / and from all good manner. And causes him to forgette / not only
god and the dyuell / heaven and hell: but also his natural parents / kynne and
friends / and him self also / so far that as a sow in the canell / wrapped
all i^ stynkyng mire and fluche: he can nothing speak ne think: but uncleanness
/ fylthe and shameful abhominacion And thus does he render and make him self
/ in his youth: infamous and like a mad furious person. And in age: odious
hateful / miserable / wreched / fylthy / and abominable / so that no man will
have hi^ in company. Let him therefore remember how he has sped / and what
chau^ces has happed unto him in the vsyng of ye beestly life / what labors
he has taken / how long he has wayched / and how yrke and werye he was /
what sekenes and diseases he has caught and taken thereby: many times in
ieoparty of life / to sle / or be slain / many times in ieoparty to be openly
shamed / and sometime has been diffamed thereby. And misspent al his goods / and
in beg red him self / and wasted and weked his body: that he is able
nothing to get. So he must need other beg or stele / these and such
other like let him remember. And say unto himself / wylt thou mad and furious
be: swalowe again that hoke: yt so often has taken the / and brought the
into so deep mischefe? Shall I wylfully do ye thing again? yt shall bring me
unto new sorrow and pain? I have cause (I trow) to be ware. And tha^ let him
call unto our lord for grace. Let him also remember / the examples and
chau^ces of other persons / what end they came unto / yt so misused the^
self. And on the contrary perte: let hi^ corrage him self with the good
examples of many young persons men and women / yt have restreyned the^ from
that folly / and by their honest and purite of living: have common unto honor
/ worship / good state / and condition. Rebuke thy self and say / thou
be: why can not thou keep chastity: as well as he / or she / so / or so
brought up? Think than / how goodly / how beauteous / how lovely unto all
persons / how worshipful / how profitable / and how pleasant a thing: is
the honest and cle^nes of the soul and body / which makes man familiar
companions with Angels / for ye clean body and soul is the temple and lodging
place of our lord god. And ye holy ghost / ye singlerly does love purite and
cle^nes: is never more grievously avoided and dryue^ away from ye soul: than by
uncleanness. And contrary: never does he rest more quietly: tha^ in virginal
souls and chaste bodies / ymagen man and think: how it / byno^meth a
christian / a member of Christ: to mourn / wax pale / lene / to drouse /
syghe / weep / to flater and speak fair / to give diligence / and do pleasure
(as a bond captive) unto a stynkynge scorte / an unclean person. And all this
they do / and many things more inco^uenient: for their sakes: whom they
follow in ye folysshe affection. Where is than the name of a christian? The
service of god / ye realm and regne of Christ: is changed unto ye service
and commandment of the fylthy scort Now they chyde / brale and sometime fight
to gether And anon again: they done return into grace / favor and
flaterie. And in a while again: They bacbyte / slander / and diffame each
other / and an other time: each praise other (as they say) beyond ye moan what
a life is this? that reasonable creature: should thus wylfully / put himself to
be so mocked / scorned / tossed / turmoyled / torn / re^t / maimed and slain
/ both in soul and body. Let hi^ also considre: what manner of pudel / what
muchepe of mischeues: this sin does hepe and gether to gether. For with other
sins: some virtues done bide and dwell / but with this beestly vice: no virtue
can agree. For all other vices ben coupled and joined thereunto.

How this lechery: although it were no great sine: yet should it be avoided
and abhorred. ye. xxii. cha.
PVt a case yt to misuse ye body / as a scort: were but a small sine (as they

again ye fader and mother / to set nothing by their co^ma^deme^t to despise al

how short this life is / though he might live unto the uttermost age and
how at (...) vanysshed / and fled more swyftly tha^ smoke or wind / and is
more vain and void tha^ a shadow. Let him also look well / how unstable /

many lyme rods / and nets: death does lay for us / leyng and bydyng most
craftily in awayte for us / day and night / every were / on every side / in

How this sin should be avoided by the consideracion of two contrary loves
/ and of the end thereof. The.xxiii. Chapi.
SEt before thine eyes or sight / these. ii. loves / and compare them both to
gether / that is to say: honest love / and unclean love / holy pleasure / and
voluptuous and fylthy pleasure. The joy and gladness of the spirit / and the
purite and passion / of thy false flesh. Look well upon the ground and matter
of both the loves. For the matter of honest love: is god and all godly things.
And the matter of other: is stynckyng sin and ^^^l. Se the ^^^ce and
disposicion of both. For the nature of honest love: is to grow and increa^e:
unto the pleasure and perfect of the person. And contrary the disposicion of
unclean love is to grow unto hatred / vurest / displeasure and / distructeon.
Take heed unto the end and reward of bode. For the reward of honest low: is
joy and love perpetual. And the reward of unclean love: payer and woe
everlasting / Answer also hereunto. Whether ye think in true conscience: yt
any reasonable person be so beastly and shameless: that would in the time of
that fylthy fury of the flesh: commit and does deed in the open market
place / and would nothing l^ttene care who should se / and behold that
abhominacion^ I am sure ye say: none. Alas tha^ why does not the brestl^ lecher
remember who looks upon him / our lord god / the holy Angels / specially
his own kepes / and all the blessed company of heaven. For I am sure: if he had
the eyes and sight of a spynx / or of an Egle^he could never se the deed of
any person / done before him: so clearly and euidentely: as god and al heaven:
done so every thought of his heart and mind. It should also some what help and
make him to remember at the beginning of this folly and madness: That he must
come at the last unto one of these two points and conclusions / that is to
say: other that such false pleasure ones tasted / and entered: shall so
enchaunt by wyche / and blind his mind: that he shall go and pass forth from
one vile abhominacion: unto an other unto the time he come (as saint Paul
says) in sensum reprobum: To. 1.
that is to weane: Unto a froward mind and understanding and felyng /
forsaken of god / and obstinat i^ yuel. So ^ wha^ sine has left him / yt is
say / when he has no power in nature to acco^plysshe that sin: yet shall
has leave ye sin. But by th^fore ^^longe use thereof (as we have know in
many p^^sones) the appetite desire / and will to do syne: does as quykly / and
freshely remain and continue: when the body to wydred / the beauty and foutme:
faded and defounned / when ye blood is cold / the symmes ^eble ye strength
gone / the hearing dull or deffe / the eyes holowe / dyme / or blind / the
smell / sauoure / and taste / mothe varied / the hands shake / when the mind
is obl^uious and forgetful / and to conclude: when both the soul and body:
is clean out of s^am^: yet I say does that voluptuous will / and desire
remain / and is as quick and busy: as in most story thing youth^. And as
far as nature will serve: does ever proceed and pass forth unto more and
more myschefe / for though the body will not serve unto the (...): yet is the
mind with unclean thoughts occupied and fed with that fylthy ssyn^kynge
poison. The eyes or sight / the hands: with b^ef^ly touching: ben exercised /
and specially the mouth and tongue: with fylthy words and speech: in more
abominable and more shameful mane^^ tha^ any time before in most use of that
sin. And does more hurt and harm unto the corrupcion of good manners in
young persons: tha^ ever did the deed. And therefore nothing in any man: may be
/ more monstrous / more vnco^mely / more beestly / more mische^dus than the
old lecher. Other now / all this shall come to pass / that is said and more:
or else / if by the synguler grace of our lord: the conscience take remors to
leave that lechery / than must that lyt^^ short and s^^ynge pleasure: be
redeemed by great pain and sorrow / by many teres / weeping / weylyng / and
mournyng / by fasting / prayng / and other due penance / were it not tha^
much better / and more wisdom / to leave that carnal / fally^ and poisoned
pleasure at the first tha^ other to be brought unto so great misery: or (by so
great and grievous trouble and heaviness) to redeem so small and yet that also so
false and painted pleasure.

That this sin should also be left by the circumstaunces of the self person
well considred. The.xxiiii. Chapitre.
MAny circumstau^ces also of the self person / should reasonably withdraw ye
beestly life. First if he were a priest / or yet a religious person / man or
woman / unto whom we done here principally w^yte: they should remember / how
they been holly consecrate unto our lord god / and unto his divine service /
and therefore done more often approach unto the holy sacraments / than done
other profane and lay persons. Let them than considre / how vnaccordynge /
how vnco^mely / how vnbysemynge / or rather / how abominable a presumpcion
it is / with the same self mouth: to receive the the blessed body and holy
sacred blood of our lord / and to kiss and lycke: that lothely stynckyng
scort and unclean person. Or yet to handle or touch in like manner. How much
different it is / to be one body and one spirit with god / and one body: with ye
stynckyng scorte and stru^pet. If ye person were learned ye soul i^ so much
is more like unto our lord god / and so much is it more contumely and rebuke
unto hi^. If ye person be noble of birth or estate: So much is the offense
more open and ^launderous / and so the sin more great and grievous. If the
persons were married: let the^ considre: how honest / how honorable the
state is of matrimony / truly kept / without violacion or defouiyng. And
how it does signify and betoken: the coniuction / and marriage of our savior
Christ Jesus and holy church. The purite and clennes whereof: all christianes:
should (as much as were possible) follow and indeuoyre to keep. That is to
say to be without uncleanness (as far as man's diligence may avoid) used
ever with reverence and dred of god / and yet to be in fru^e and children /
plentuous. For it is always loathsome / and inconvenient that any christian in
any state of this life: should be given or applied purposely: unto any fylthy
voluptuous pleasure. Considre now and look farther / if this unclean liver /
be a young person. How much damage it is: to lose and destroy the flower of
youth that never can be recovered ne restored again. And in so stynckynge and
beestly living: to spend and destroy his best years / his very golden / rich
and noble years / that sone done pass / and never may return. And yet over
that: to commit and do by wanton ignorance of age: that thing: that shall
ever more in his life: grudge the conscience. And that shall cause in his soul
and mind: most bitter pricks / and poisoned stynges of remors. Which that
short steyng pleasure (by that wyked and unhappy fylthynes) left behind. If
the person be female / a woman: nothing does more byco^me that sex and
kind: than clennes and chastity / ne any thing in a woman: can be more
shameful: than that abominable misuse of the body. If he were a man of full
age and perfection: So much the more it byco^meth him to play the very man of
grauite and sadness / and not the child of wanton lyghtnes. And if this
pestilence were in aged persons: men or women: Let them wyshe for better eyes
or more clear sight / that they might se and perceive: how yuell that folly be
comes that age / which folly in young persons: is to be weyled of all
persons / and to be restreined by counsel / or correction. But in aged
persons: to be wondered and abhorred / whom also the self unclean lyuers:
done mock and laghe to scorn. For among all ye monsters of the world: none
is more wonderful: more mocked / ne more abhorred and lothed: tha^ the old
lecher. O (say the people) se this old cryple / this aged sole / this wydred
trotte / how clean they have forgotten themself / how they b^gyne to play the
fool again. Se: how made they be / even at the pyttes brynke: and yet would
they wylfully quench that little spark of nature: ye remains in that wydred
carkas / get them a glass that they may (at the leest) se / and perceive
their hoar here is as why^ as snow / the wryncled forhed / the rugged lene
chekes / the holowe blered eyes / the sharp droppynge nose / and all the
defourmed face: more like unto a stinking caren: tha^ unto a co^mely courtiour
/ bid them cure and take heed unto other things / ye better may bycome their
age. For they been past these matters. Tell the^ it is beyond reason: for their
age to attempt such folly. The self fylthy pleasure: does forsake and loathe
you. And says Another thou art mete for me: Nor I for the Vale. Get the
hense into an other company. For (in a surete) every body is here weary of thy
presence. A peyre of bedes: were more mete for ye old wreche These things and
many worse rebukes: done the common people of the world / say unto the old
folysshe unclean lyuers. Now is time to make an end. Here may you perceive /
that chastity is much co^me^dable / unto all christianes: of all manner of age
and all manner of state / and contrary / unclean living / is odious and
abominable. Will ye now have a short recount and rehearse of all? lest
peradventure ye would be weary to read all at length.

Epilogus / a short recounte. The.xxv. Chapitre.
First is / the love desire / and purpose of chastity. Whereunto / every
person may reasonably be moved / by the beauty / ye honest / ye pleasure
profect in both soul and body / of that most noble virtue chastity. The
second is / the utter hatred and horroure of the contrary vice and adversary
/ uncleanness. Whereunto the fylthynes / shame / and yuell end of the same:
should move any as of the ears / or hearing: from al vain / namely unclean
words or communication. Of the eyes or sight recount: have we made / for them
that been loathe to read long works. The figures in the marge^t: ben set
forth / that if the reder would se at length any of the matters or points here
touched: they may turn unto the same figures within forth before: and there
at one of those figures: wha^ two been here to gether: find there desire. I
bese^^e our lord god / and most swear savior Jesus / that both the writing
and reading: may be unto the honor / laud / and praise of him / and unto
the intended profecte of the parties. Amen.

And thus an end of the third board of our vessel and of the third membre
of this third part of our work.
The fourth part of this work of the hole vessel that is to say religion.
The first Cha.
IN all-thynges diuisible: that is to say: yt may be divided in sundry parts:
the parts ben first presupposed / which duly joined to gether: done make ye
hoole thing / I said in things diuisible. For all things ben not diuisible
into sundry pertes / as a spirit / god / Angel and man's soul. For
although ye soul have pertes spiritual: yet can they not be deperted in
sondre / ne any of the from ye self soul. For all were create and made at
ones. In all other bodily things: the hole is made of ye parts joined (as we
said) ryghtly to gether and framed into a certain form. The parts therefore
of our vessel Pype / or Tun / we have some what set our before you yet here
will you peradventure say unto me. Sir these parts yt you have set forth: will
not make your vessel perfect. For here done lack two pertes most necessary
/ that is to say a botome / and a head. The botome is first required as
foundeme^t and beginning of all the vessel. For thereunto must the bordes be
first framed / and tha^ compassed about with your hoppes / and they bound with
the wykers. And than must you nedely have an head to cover your vessel: if you
shall well preserve your wine: all this (I grant) is very truth /
natwtstandyng: I did verily think / and yet I do believe: that al you did of
your self presuppose: these two parts as not nedyng our intreates. For all
that we do in religion has but one fou^dement and beginning that is feyth
without which: it is (as saint Paul says) impossible or impossible to please
god. Heb. 11. B. 1. Cor. 3. C.
And other fou^dament or botome / tha^ is put all ready: no man may put (says
he) which is Christ Jesus / and his feythe / and al our works must nedely
end and be concluded in charity / or else all ben lost. Now you know well / yt
for us to have enterprised any thing to entreat of these tweyne: had been
superfluous and a great presu^pcion / seeing and perceyuyng: how largely they
be entreated / of so many / so ancient auctores / wherefore we humbly byseche
you: to be co^tente: with your own necessary parts presupposed: and with our
parts so / so porely set forth for the perfourmau^ce of our said vessel /
Pype or Tun / whereby is signified (after our enterprise) religion monastical
/ whereof to entreat: we shall begin with religion in general.

The definicion / determinacion / or declaracion of this term religion. The
second Chapitre.
TO speak of religion i^ general: it seems convenient to show first what is
meant by ye self term religion. For that thing yt is called religion: has
always ben used in all manner of nations / in so much that the paganes or paynyms
/ said that religion is that thing whereby the ceremonies of divine worship /
or of gods worship: Cicero de natura de oru^. li. 1. Ibidem.
ben exercised and done with reverend service. And those persons (says he) ben
called religious ye diligently and reverently done entreat and ministre all
things that done apperteyne unto the honor / and worship of the gods.
Plutarce.
And the old philosophers did call religion: a science or co^nynge of things
divine / of such things as done appert^yne and bylong unto god. But you will
say here: Sir we care not what infideles and miscreantes have said or done say
/ let us hear what christian auctores done say of religion / yet say I: we
may take herby that religion has been ever among all manner of people. And
that those persons were called specially religious persons: that could best
do service and honor unto god with special ceremonies: and were in the same
most reverent and devout And those manner of persons / in all manner of nations
/ we^e ^^e^ of most high dignite and degree / and so had^n honor and
reverence of al manner of people. But let us leave them / and se what our
catholic and christian ^ortoures done say thereof. De ci. dei li. 10.
Holy saint Augustyne / says that religion is a due honor / or worship
unto god / whereby the soul by reconciliacion and agreement again: De
quantitate anime et de ciuita. dei li. 2. Isidorus li. 18. ethi. Deffinicion
does bind it self unto almighty god / from whom it did wtdrawe it self by
sin. And the same i^ sentence has saint Isidor: So that by the mind of al
doctores: we may say / that religion is a due reverence and honor unto god /
done / showed / and declared by certain remonies and outward signs or tokens /
according unto a rite / or certain custom of auctorite / that is to say of
the law of Christ and the ordinance of his church. And of this religion ben
al christianes For although all christianes done not always show outward (by
ceremonies and outward signs the due honor of god) yet been we all bound to
show it so outward: if time and place did so require. And therefore the greeks
have two diverse terms for this word religion / ye tone does signify the
inward and prive honor of god / done in the soul or mind alone / and the
the other: ye outward honor after the manner before said / yet done not we say
yt all persons yt done reverence / and honor unto our lord with al ceremonies
and outward signs (as is said) ben religious. For a little default of ye
d^speasur^ of god remaining in the soul: does make religion vain and void
/ as appeteth by ye sentence of saint James the Apostle. Iacobi. 1.
If any persons (says he) done suppose and trust themself to be religious /
and done not refreyne their tongues from yuel but done deceive their soul:
their religion is vayn^ and void. ^o yt the honor of god (to be thereby
religion) ^^ste he done with a clean soul and mind / so does follow i^ ye same
place This is a clean and spotles religion (faith sait James) anenst god and ye
father of heaven: for all christianes. To visit / conforte / help / and
succoure pupilles / fatherles and moder^es children / wedowes and nedy persons
i^ their trouble / and tha^ does follow forthwt / and also to keep the^ self
i^maculate / pure / clean / and spotles from this world that is to say: from
sin / and from all ye occasions thereof. So tha^ is required / yt all persons
of this religion: be synles. And so is this religion yt we have described:
common unto all persons / and a very apt vessel to preserve ye wine of the
life of protection. But this vessel is co^parable unto yt great fat wherein
wine is put at the first beginning and from thense diriued / and divided into
the other particular vessels. And although wine may be preserved in many
vessels: yet none is more apt ne more used: than the Tun or Pype /
whereunto (at our first beginning) we compared this manner of religion: whereof
we have and yet here done entreat.

Of religion as the term is co^munely used / that is to say of m^nasticall /
or monastike religion. The third Chapitre.
THis religion tha^ here entreated is more special than the other before
discribed. And is called monastical or monastical or monastike religion / of
this latyne term / Monachus / or rather this greek word / Monachs^ / which
is to mean a person segregate / separate / or departed from the common sort
/ and company of other worldly persons / and that in our common englys she is
called a solitary person. (...).
And this manner of religion in the latyne tongue is called monach^tus / that is
to mean / a state apperteynynge unto monks and solitary persons / which
state is now called only religion. And such persons as ben bounden unto
that state / and done live in religion / been alone called religious persons /
and none other persons ben so named co^munly but only they And this manner of
religion is diversely described / or declared and showed what it is / or what is
meant by ye term. The deffinicion of religion monastical or monastike.
Lodouicus caruaialus minorita contra Erasmum.
This manner of religion (says one) Est vita eua^gelica: quae Christus et
co^soluit et precepit obserua^s hijs obuia^cia deuita^s. That is to say /
religion is the life eua^gelicall / or eua^gelike / yt is to say the life of ye
gospel / which life does observe and keep: both what Christ cou^sayled and
what he commanded / or ^is keeping: as well those things yt Christ did
counsel: as those yt he did command / and eschewyng / auoydyng and steyng
al things contrary. But this definicio^ or declaracio^ is not sufficient /
for it does not always frame with ye thing declared. For tha^ should follow: yt
every person of any degree / wedded or syngle: ye (of deuo^^^n) would and did
keep both the commandments / and the counsayles of the gospel and ^^e the
contrary / were forth with a religious person of this manner / that is
monastike / which is not true. And also it semethe unto me: that the sentence
in the end: set forth by these words. Hijs obuiancia deuita^^. That is to
say / eschewyng or auoydyng the contrary: this sentence (I say) is superfluous
and void. For whose ever keeps the commandments and counsayles of the
gospelles: does avoid the contrary. And who does not avoid the contrary:
Definicio authoris.
does not ke^^ them / not withstandyng I think verily the same definicion or
declaracion without those last words: and with a few other words: should be
sufficient and good. Thus Religion monast^^^ is that life euangelyke, that (by
the liberal promise and wylful bond of so ^empne vow according unto any
auctorised reule) observe and keep those things that Christ caunsayled / and
also that he commanded. Iudocus Clichto. de land monastice religionis ca. 1.
And here unto agrees well the diffinicion and declaracion of a great clerk /
saying. Religio monastica, est integra discipline monasterialis obseruacio:
humana tradicione constitute, atque ad euangelica complenda confilia, suos
cultores astringentis certis statutis et regulis determinata. That is to say:
Religion monastike / is an obseruacion or keeping of discipline monasteriall /
that is to say / such manner and byhauioure as is used in monasteries:
constitute and ordained by humayne tradicion / that is / by ordinance of man.
And constreynyng and bynding the reverent users and kepers of the same
discipline and manner: by certain statutes and reules determined / unto the
cou^sayles of the gospel to be acco^pleshed and fulfilled The same again in
more plain terms. Religion is an obseruacion / perfourmaunce / or keeping: of
such religious manner as is used in monasteries / which manner: was ordened by
holy fathers / and does constreyne and bind ye disciples of the same: to
accompy she and fulfill the counsayles of the gospel / which said obseruacion
and keeping of this manner: is determined and appointed by certain statutes and
reules. And this is the religion: whereof we done here entreat as the most
apt vessel / and most convenient way: to preserve and to continue as most
precious wine / the / wine / of perfection. All the parts whereof: ben described
before and determined. But here now I do ymagyne what many persons (specially
in this troublous and most lamentable time) will say hereunto. Nu. 6. A.
In the old testament were certain persons of this manner called ^^zareis /
that by vow were consecrate / and much were different in form and manner of
living from the other people of Israel / which natwithstandynge were the
chosen people of god / and had a religion and law common unto them all /
which was sufficient for their salvation. Yet would our lord god have such
special divisions / and differences of perfectio^s among his chosen people.
Some were common people / some princes / some prestes / some levites / and
deakens. Nume. 18. Deuteronomy. 18.3. Reg. 17. and 19. and 4. Reg. 1.4. Reg. 4.
Some religious / of high perfection as Helias that both in array and fedynge
was far from other / and after him ^is disciple Heliseus in like manner. And a
little before the coming of Christ were certain religious persons called
Esseis / or Essenies / which were of singular perfection above other / as
Josephus writethe. Josephus de auti. li. 18. ca. 5.
But now let all this pass and let us look upon the new testament / was not
saint Johan baptiste (after the incarnacion of our savior in the first
beginning of Christ) a religious person: Matthew. 11. Marci. 1.
and of more hard life / both i^ diete and array: tha^ ben now in these days?
Saint Johan chrisostomus does call him a prince and doctoure of monastical
religious persons. For he by ganne religion tymely in youth / and therein did
continue / and bide ye coming of our lord and savior Jesus Christ. But here
(me seems) I herd some persons speak and say unto me. religion: or that he
instituted and ordained any such to be kept: tha^ may you persuade us unto
your purpose. And to grant / that above the law and religion of Christ
common unto al persons / as suffient unto their salvation: yet this
monastical religion / may be good and necessary unto perfection. For answer
hereunto:

Of the fyfthe and last part of this interprise and pore labor / that is /
of the wine to be preserved in the said vessel / Pype or Tun / by the which
wine: we done understand the life of perfection. which is but one Chapitre.
HEre now in the fyfthe place we promised to speak somewhat of the life of
perfection / which we appointed to be signified by the precious wine to be
reserved i^ our said vessel of religion. By these terms the life of
perfection: we done mean a state wherein creatures done live perfectely. That
thing is called singulerly or simply perfect: whereunto nothing may be added or
that lacks nothing. And so after that manner: is nothing perfect but only
god himself / ne any life or state of living is so / or under ye form
perfect: but this life alone. An other way. A thing is called perfect: unto
the which nothing may be added as bylongyng unto that thing that is to say:
that has al things / and lacks nothing that should apperteyne unto the
natural perfection of ye thing. And under this form is every person of
soul and body: perfect man. But in this manner of perfection: ben many
degrees. For Angel is of more perfect or excellent and more noble nature:
tha^ is man. And the life or state of the living of them in like manner. But we
done speak here of the life of perfection: as it does apperteyne unto man. And
yet not so as it was in man before his lapse / and fall out of paradyse: but as
it is now in man. In them I mean that been christianes. For all those by the
passion / death / and resurrection of our Savior: receiuyng his feyth /
byleuyng and baptized: been eftsoon borne and renewed unto a perfect life /
or a perfect state of living / called co^munely the state of salvation. Qui
crediderit et baptizatus suerit saluus erit. Marci. 16. D.
says the gospel. Who so does believe / and receive the right feythe of
Christ / and in the same is baptized: shall surely be saved. This state of
living: is that life of perfection that we meant and spoke of signified by the
doulce / sweet and precious wine to be preserved in our said vessel of
religion. For although all christianes: ben put ones in this state: yet is not
that state continually kept in all them. And although this state / and life of
perfection may be well kept / and reserved in many other vessels that is in
many degrees of persons yet (as I said) it is not so surely kept of any
sort: as of religious persons. And yet natwithstandynge / I do not deney /
but that some persons in every degree of ye people / as some in wedloke / some
in wydohed / some in virginite among the layfee / and among the clergy some (I
say) may / and done preserve / keep / and continue the said state / and life of
perfection: as well / as sure / and in as perfect manner / as any religious
persons done. But yet (as I have often said) there is none of these degrees /
that through out the hole degree: done keep it so well / as religious persons /
and therefore I said that this vessel is most apt / and most convenient to
preserve this precious wine of the life / or state of perfection. Where I say:
most convenient: I do not deney / other degrees to be convenient and very
convenient. For that is the thing yt these new heretics done ley unto the
charge of religious persons / that is where the religious persons say / that
the state of religion: does best of all other states co^munly / keep the said
state of perfection The said heretics done threpe upon them / and falsely done
accuse them: that they put the^ self / and done affirm them self to be only
in the state of perfection And that they done despise all other sorts / or
degrees of people in comparison unto them self / which thing no manner of good
religious persons: ever said or thought / but rather the contrary / they done
suppose al other persons better tha^ they ben / natwithstandyng: yet do I judge
(as I said) that religion monastike duly kept: is the most apt vessel / the
most ready way / and most sure mean to preserve / and continue the life and
state of perfection / wherein the holy sacrament of baptyme / does put and set
all persons that duly done resceyue it. And yet in that state of baptism
duly kept: ben degrees of perfection meritorious. That may be proved by the
gospel. For our savior him self i^ his acts of our instruction: did not
always keep one manner / or one form / but sometime he showed him self as a
person universal / and did accompany himself / and be familiar / in eating
and drinking / spekyng or talkyng with persons of low degree / wherewith ye
phariseis / and scribes were / slaundred and took occasion / and sometime he
showed him self of high and singular perfection in fasting.xl. Matthew. 9. B.
days / in prayer / and specially in his tra^sfiguracion. In the which those
persons that were present: were so rauisshed that they would have dwelled
still there: and never to have descended unto the life they used before / and
yet was that life: much happy and gracious wherein they lived with their
master / and much more perfect: than was ye life of many other good and
devout persons. So tha^ appears yt i^ ye pure state of christianite: been
diverse degrees of perfection. And as it were two manner of lives distinct and
diverse / and yet both of high perfection / which ben co^munely called. The
life active / and the life contemplative / and some persons done put the
third life and done call it the myxte life. But our lord and savior spoke
but of tweyne / preferryng the tone / and yet allowyng and praysyng both. Sayng
unto Martha that the tone life is necessary / that is the life active / without
which no person may be saved. But yet is the the other life of contemplacion:
more noble and excellent why should than these new heretics say / that the
people should be all of one form of living / sithe our Savior himself /
did express and set forth tweyne / both in his own co^uersacion / and also
in the said words of the gospel / where he preferred the life of
contemplacion / sayng. Maria optimam partem elegit. Mary (says he) has chosen
the best part. Who now (by good reason) will blame or dissalowe the^ / that
(with Mary Magdalene) done chose the best part? or who will not rather praise
them that so do? I trow none. But religious persons done take that part /
and most nere done follow the same. Ergo religion is the most apt and
convenient vessel / the most sure and ready mean to preserve / keep / and
continue. this precious wine of the life of perfection. And so is our purpose
of this pore labor: concluded and ended / after our pore understanding and
rude manner. I beseech you apply all unto the best / and so accept my good
will and mind / in our lord god and most sweet savior Jesus Christ / who
preserve you al in his grace and mercy. Amen. And of your charity to pray for
the said wreched brother of Syon / Richard Whytforde.

YEt wha^ I had thus finished my matter: I was required (because I had made
mention of the two lives called active / and co^templatiue) I should show
forther unto the unlearned people what is meant by those terms / active / and
conte^platiue / and to show some example of both. And I answered the truth /
that the request did pass mine understanding or felyng. I might peradventure
guess thereat / and do (according unto the common proverb) as ye blind man
does cast his staff. Wherefore I will not take upon me to make any work / or
treatise of that matter / natwithsta^dyng I am content to show my pore mind as
unto the understanding of the terms. This term active: is as much to say i^
english / as apperteynyng / or bylongyng unto an act deed / or work / or
unto acts / deeds / or works / done or wroght outwardly unto the knowelege of
outward persons. And the persons yt done use such works or deeds: ben
called active persons. And the life or state and manner of living / of the^ yt
(for ye most part) ben occupied in such manner of ac^es / deeds / or works:
is called a life active. And unto this life done apperteyne and bylonge: the
precepts and commandments of god specially of the second table. And the
commandments also of the new law of Christ and of the church / and
the.vii. works of mercy / with other good deeds or works done in clean life.
For the works of sin: ben deed / and the life of their workers: is not
worthy the name of life / but rather of death. For death it is in deed / and the
persons that done use it ben deed. So the byshope did answer saint Johan the
euangeliste wha^ he asket him for a young man that he left in his keeping / he
is deed (said he) what manner of death? said saint Johan / he is (said he) deed
in the sin of the world. All manner of good works (than) done apperteyne
unto the life actyue. Now for the other life which is called co^te^platyfe:
this term co^templatyfe: is as much to mean: as apperteynyng or belongyng
unto contemplacion / and that life is called contemplatyfe: that (for the most
part) is given and applied unto co^templacion / and the persons that done use
and ben co^munely occupied therein: ben called contemplatyue persons. This
term contemplacion: in plain english: is as much to say: as a dilligent
beholding / or inward lokyng with a desire of heart And this beholdynge or
lokynge (after the common significacion / and use of this term co^templacion)
does apperteyne and bylongyng rather unto ye soul or mind: than unto any
bodily sight. As when a person would (for very feruente devotion and desire of
our lord) give and apply himself (with dilligent study and of purpose) to
sequestre / and withdraw or put away all his heart and mind (as much as is
possible for the time) from all bodily and worldly things / and to fire or
fasten the same upon things celestial and heavenly / beholding and lokynge
thereupon with the eye / and sight of the soul or mind by cogitacion / thought
/ meditacion / or remembrance And because this thing may be done by diverse
manners / and diverse degrees of fervor and desire diverse doctoures and
contemplatyfe persons: have set forth in writing their minds therein / some i^
english / and mo in latyne / and (I doubt not) in all other tongues / or
langages. Among the which: I am required to translate one little work of a
great clerk / called master Johan Gerson / which work can not be made ready
to be prynted at this time. Vale in Christo.

Imprynted at london in Fletestrete / by me Robert Redman / dwelling in saint
Dunstones parysshe / next the church. In the year of our lord god a thousand
five hundred and.xxxii. The.xxiii. day of March.
