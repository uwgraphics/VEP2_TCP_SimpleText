A RELATION OF THE State of Religion, and with what Hopes and Policies it has
been framed and is maintained in the several states of these western parts
of the World.
HAving now almost finished my intended course of travel, and coming to cast
up (as it were) the short account of my labors, I shall here endeavor
briefly to relate what I have observed in the matter of Religion, my time
being chiefly employed (as was from the first my principal design) in
viewing the state thereof in these Western parts of the world, their divided
factions and professions, their differences in matters of faith, and their
exercises of religion, in government Ecclesiastical, and in life and
conversatio^, what virtues in each kind eminent, what eminent defects.
Moreover, in what terms of opposition, or correspondencie each stands with
other, what probabilities, what pollices, what hopes, what iealousies are found
in each part for the advauncing thereof: and finally, what possibilities and
good means of uniting, at leastwise the several branches of the reformed
professors (if unity universal be more to be desired then hoped in such
bitterness of mind, and equality of forces as leaves on neither side,
either disposition to yield, or doubt to be vanquished.)

In the midst of these thoughts not intending to deliver a full report of all
these points, which would too much exceed a reasonable proportion, but
restraining my self chiefly to such parts and places as may seem most
nessarie for one of my Country to know. The Roman Religion


1 FIrst, the Roman Religion, framed in those middle times when there was no
man to control them, did light into the ha^dling of such men as made their
greatness wealth and honor, the very rule to square out the Cannons of faith,
and then did set Clearkes on work to devise Arguments to maintain them.

2. This Religion seems notwithstanding at this day, not so corrupt in the
very doctrine (and in their Schools, where yet manifold oppositions do hold
them in awe, that has caused them to refine it) as it is in the practice here
of, and in the usage among themselves, wherein they are so gross: as that
sundry men whom the reading of their Books has allured, the view of their
Churches has averted from their party.

3 I must omit an endless multitude of their superstitions and ceremonies, for
they are enough to take up a great part of a man's life to peruse, being
without uniformity, and different in diverse Countries, and withal so
childish and vnsavourie, that as they argue seelinesse and rawnesse in their
inuenters, so can they bring no other then disgrace and contempt to those
exercises of Religion wherein they are stirring.

4 How they communicate divine honor to Saints and Angels, by building
Churches, erecting Altars, commending prayers, and addressing vows unto them,
in worshipping their Images, going in pilgrimage to their Relics, attributing
all kind of miracles both to the one and to the other, I will in this place
restrain my self especially to Itali^, where it has wrought this general
effect, that men have more affiance, and assume unto themselves a greater
conceit of comfort in the patronage of the creatures and servants of God, then
of God himself, the Prince and creator* And touching the blessed virgin, the
case is clear, that howsoever their Doctrine be in schools otherwise, yet in
all manner of outward Actions, the honor which they do unto her, is double,
for the most part, unto that which they do our Savior: where one professes
himself a devote or peculiar servant to our Lord, whole Towns sometimes, as
Vienna, etc. are the Devoti of our Lady. The stateliest and fairest Altars are
hers, for the most part, where one prays before the Crucifixe, two pray
before her Images, where one vow unto Christ, ten vow unto her, and not so
much to her self, as to some particular Image of hers, which for some notable
power and grace of operation of miracles they chiefly serve, as the glorious
Lady of Loretto: the devout Lady of Rome: the myraculous Lady of Provensan^:
the Annuntiata of Florence, all whose Churches are so stuffed with vowed
presents and memories, as they are feign to hang their Cloisters and
Churchyardes with them. And such as their vows are, such are their
Pilgrimages; and to nourish this honor, for one miracle reported to be wrought
by the Crucifixe, not so few, perhaps, as one hundred are voiced upon those
other Images, neither will I omit this no less certain, though less
apparent, that where one fasteth on Friday, which they account our Lords day,
many fast on Saturday which they account our Ladies day, in honor to her. In
all which the people do but follow their guides; who, as in the measuring of
their devotion by tale on beads, do string up ten salutations to our Lady,
for one of our Lords prayers. So themselves also in their Sermons, make their
entrance with an Aue Maria, yea a solemn divine honor which they have, most
commendable, if it were well used: that at Sun rising, none, and Sun setting,
upon the ringing of a bell, all men, in what place soever, house, field,
street, or market, do presently kneel down, and send up their united
devotions to heaven. This honor is by them chiefly intended to our Lady, the
devotion is the Ave Maria, and the bell that ringeth to it, has also that
name. They teach in pulpit, that nothing passes in heaven without her express
consent. That the style of that court, is, Placet Dominae, that matters of
Justice come properly from Christ, and matters of Grace from her, that it was
the vision of a holy man, that certain that would have been condemned by
Christ, in regard they were her servants, have bin absolved by her
intercession. So the principal streams o^ affiance and love, are diverted
from him, and turned upon those unto whom so great honor is not due, nor so
undue honor can be acceptable.

5 Their Liturgies being not understood by the people, are not able to hold
them occupied with any spiritual contemplation: for supply whereof they hold
them to their charming with their beads in the mean season, which being so
unsavory a food as it is, they use it accordingly: when they are weary of it,
they entertain the rest of their time with talk and mirth, which their
Priests themselves also at their leisures forbear not, not forgetting yet at
certain pauses to show devotion, wherein their outward iestures are decent,
reverent, and significant. And this honor is to be yielded to the Italian
nation, that he is naturally not vndevoute, were his devotion duly guided and
cherished, and not starved and quenched in the dark mist of a language, which
he neither understands what is said to him, not yet what himself says.

6 The best part of their exercises of Religion, are their Sermons, wherein
much matter, both of faith and piety is eloquently delivered, by men surely of
wonderful zeal and spirit, if their interior fervor were correspondent to
their outward ^ervencie; how beit they are sometimes mingled with so palpable
vanity (as besides their other poverties, as forced allegories, and unnatural
interpretations, wherein they are fervent,) they have legends of Saints, and
tales (at which children with us would smile) solemnly historized in their
Cathedral Pulpits; yet what religiousnesse soever is the peoples minds may
wholly be attributed to their Sermons, whither the better disposed people do
resort.

This one thing I cannot but highly commend in that sort and order: they spare
nothing, which either co^t car* perform in enriching, or skill in adorning the
Temple of God, or to set out his service with the greatest pomp and
magnificence that can be devised. And although for the most part, much
baseness and childishness is predominant in the masters and contrivers of
their ceremonies, yet this outward state and glory being well disposed, does
engender, quicken, increase, and nourish, the inward reverence, respect, and
devotion which is due unto sovereign majesty and power. And therefore,
howsoever some will not be persuaded in it, yet in the zeal of the common Lord
of all, I choose rather to commend the virtue of an enemy, then to flatter the
vice and imbecility of a friend.

7 But to return to the Church of Rome, and to come to the consideration of
their penance and confession, out of which, so great good is promised to the
world, and the want thereof so much vpbraided to their opposites. I must
confess I brought with me this persuasion and expectation, that surely in
this must needs be a very great restraint to wickedness, a great means to
bring men to integrity and perfection, when a man shall daily, as it were,
survey his actions, censure with grief, confess with shame, cure by council,
expiate with punishment, extinguish with firm intent, never to return to the
like again; whatsoever had defiled or stained the soul, (neither doubt I but
it had this fruit in the first institution, and has also with many at this
day, yea and might perhaps have bin restored better in reformed Churches, to
there primative sincerity, the^ utterly abolished, as in most places it is:)
Notwithstanding, having diligently searched into the meaning thereof in those
parts, I find, that as all things whereof humane imbecillitie has the
custody and government, fall away, decaying by insensible degrees, from their
first perfection and purity, and gather much soil and dross in using: so this
as much as any thing. For this point of their religion, which in outward show
carries a face of severitie and discipline, is become of all others, the most
remiss and pleasant, and of the greatest content to the desolutest minds, the
matter being grown with the common sort to this open reckoning; What need we
refrain so fearfully from sin, God having provided so ready a means to be
rid of it when we list? yea, and the worser sort will say; When we have sinned
we must confess, and when we have confessed, we must sin again, that we
may also confess again, and with all, make work for new indulgences and
iubiles; making acount of confession, as drunkards do of vomitting: yea, I have
known of those that carried show of very devoute persons, who by their own
report, to excuse their acquaintance in matters criminal, have wittingly
perjured themselves in judgment, only presuming of this present and easy
remedy of confession, and others of more ordinary note amongst them, who when
their time of confessing was at hand, would then venture on those actions which
before they trembled at, as presuming to surfeit, by reason of the neighborhood
of the Physician, which Physician also himself is perhaps more apparently
infected with the noisome disease his patient discloseth, then the patient, who
is not any way bettered by the connsell which the Physician gives.

But this must be granted to be the fault of the people, yet a general fault
is it, and current without controlement; howbeit, neither are Priests, nor the
people to be more excused on their part. The Priests will tell the penitent,
that God is merciful, that whatsoever sins the penitent commits, so long
as he continues in the Church, and is not a Lutheran, there is, good remedy
for him.

And for Penance, it consists ordinarily but in Avemaries and Paternosters,
with Almes-deedes by those that are able, and fastings by them that are
willing; yea, I have known, when the penance for horrible, and open
blasphemy, besides much other lewdness has been no other, then saying of
their Beads thrice over, a matter of some hours muttering; and which in Italy
they dispatch also as they go in the streets, or as they Pardone and
Indulgences.
ride, or do their buisinesse at home, making no other of it, then as it is,
two lips, and one fingers work. But were the penance by the Priests enjoined,
never so hard and sharp, the Popes plenary pardons sweep all away at a blow:
Now of these they have granted (and this man especially) so huge a number, as
that there are few Churches of note in Italy, which have not purchased or
procured a perpetual Indulgence, by virtue whereof, whosoever shall at
certain set yearly days, being confessed, and having communicated, or as in
some pardons, having but only an intent to confess and communicate in time
convenient powers out his devotions before some Altar in that Church and
extends forth his hands in alms, in behalf thereof, (which clause in all
former grants was expressed, but is now left out for avoiding of scandale but
is still understood and practiced accordingly) has forthwith remission of all
sin and punishment; yea, if the worst fall out, that a man be so negligent as
to drop into Purgatory at the time of his decease, which but by very supine
negligence can hardly happen; yet few Cities are there, wherein there are not
one or two Altars privileged, Prodefunctis, where for every Mass, a soul is
delivered, and so a great multitude of A^tisons must needs make their ware
cheap. I will not here warble long upon this untuneable harsh string, neither
will mention perhaps, the fourth part of that I have seen, much less rake old
rustie stuff out of the dead dust and darkness, wherein time and shame has
suffered it to rest: only for example sake, and for verifying what I have
said, I will set down some of that which is now in use at this day, which is
printed on their Church doors, and proclaimed in their Pulpits.

8 In the Ermitanes of Padua, their Preachers publish pardon of plenarie
indulgence from Baptism, to the last confession, with eight and twenty
thousand years over for the time ensuing. The pardon of Alexander the sixth
for thirty thousand years; to whom soever before the Altar of our Ladie^,
shall say a peculiar Ave Marie. At the Sepulcher of Christ in Uenice, is a
stately presentation, whereon is wrtten, Hic situm est corpus Domini nostri
Jesus Christi; (yet inferring no real presence there as I take it) with verses
annexed of, Conditur hoc tumulo, etc. There is hanged in a printed Table, a
prayer of Saint Augustines, a very good one indeed, with indulgence for
fourscore and two thousand years, granted from Boniface the eight, and
confirmed by Benedict the 11. to whosoever shall say it, and that for every day
toties, quoties, etc. (which is somewhat worth) that in a few days a man may
provide for a million of worlds, if they did last no longer then this did in
Saint Francis Church. At Padua I heard a Reverend Father preach at large the
holy history of the divine pardon of Sisa ab omni culpi and poena, granted by
Christ in person at our Ladies suit, unto Saint Francis, extending to all such,
as having confessed and communicated, should pray in Saint Francis Church
there, yet sending him to his Vicar, Pope Honorius that then was to pass it,
with many other apparitions and delectable strange accidents of great content to
pleasant minded hearers, which pardon is since enlarged by Sixtus the fourth,
and fifth (which both were Franciscans) to all lay brethren and sisters that
did wear Saint Francis Cordon, in what place soever. Gregory the thirteenth
has granted to the Carmine at Syenna, for every Mass said there at the Altar
of the Crucifixe, the deliverie of a soul out of Purgatory, to the Carmine at
Padua more liberally, for to every one that shall say seven Aves, and seven
Pater nosters, before one of their Altars on the Wednesday in Easter week, or
kiss the ground before the Altar of the blessed Sacrament with the usual
prayers for the exaltation of the Church, extirpation of heresy, and unity of
Christian Princes, plenary Indulgence for himself, and the delivery of what
soul out of Purgatory he pleases. To the fraternity of the Altar of the
Conception of our Lady in Duamo, or the Cathedral Church in Padua, confessing
and communicating at their entry into that society, full remission of their
sins at the hour of their death* naming but Jesus with their mouth, or if
they can not, with their heart: the like is ordinarily granted to all other
Fraternities. To every Priest as often as he shall say five printed lines,
importing that he will offer up the precious body of our Savior, so many
fifty years pardon. By this Pope, this one amongst many others innumerable to
the Friars, and lay Fraternities of both sexes of the Carmine in Syenna for
every time that they are present at their solemn Processions, plenary
Indulgengences for all their sins past, and 40 years, and 7 days over, to
some for to come, and this for ever, with exte^t of like grace to all other,
that by their presence shall honor those processions, but to last no longer
then till the year of Iubile. Now besides these and infinite other of this
style, there are Indulgences more free, and less restrained then for time,
place, or duty, to give them by grant from Pope John the twentieth, every
inclining of the head at the name of Jesus, gets twenty years pardon, a
matter in Italy, no not at this time unpracticed. And to grace that ceremony
the more, I have heard sundry of their renowned Divines teach in Pulpit, that
Christ himself on the Cross bowed his head, all Altars of station, which are
in very great number, have their certain perpetual Indulgences indifferent
for all times, sundry Crosses graven in Pavements of their Churches, have
Indulgenges annexed for every time they are kissed, which is so often by the
devouter sex, that hard Marble is worn with it. The third and fourth Mass (as
they say) is a preservative and ransom of his parents from Purgatory, yea
though they should be sung without any such intention, which causes many warye
men which would be sure from Purgatory, to make some one of their children a
Priest always. The saying of the Beads over, with a Medall or other trinket
of the Popes benediction appendant, gets plenarie Indulgence and deliverie
of what soul out of Purgatory one pleases.

9 For to speak also somewhat of their life and conversation, Their
conversation of Italian Romanistes.
and as briefly as may be (being a theme Itake very small delight to handle)
neither being of any great profit to be known and yet being known
sufficiently to all men, too much to some, who not content to spot themselves
with all Italian impurity, proceed on to impoyson their Country also at their
return hither, that we need not marvel if those rare villains which our
ancestors never dreamed of, do now grow frequent, and such men as they would
have swept out of their Cities and streets, as the noisome disgrace and
dishonor of them, and confined to a Dungeon or other desolate habitation, do
vaunt themselves now, and with no mean applause, for the only gallants and
worthy spirits of the world.

But to touch so much of their lives as shall be necessary for this purpose,
and rather the causes then the effects themselves, it is not to be marvailed,
if the glory of their Religion, (consisting most in outvvard show, and the
exquisiteness in the number of intricate dumb Ceremonies, if their devotions
being not seasoned with understanding requisite, but prised more by tale then
by weight of zeal, if as by the virtue of their Sacraments, of their acts of
piety, being placed more in the very massy materialitie of the outvvarde
work, then in the purity of the heart from which they proceed) it is not,
I say, to be marvailed though the fruits also of their conversation be like
unto those roots, rather such as may yield some reasonable outvvarde
obedience to Laws, then approove that inward integrity and sincerity of
that fountain from whence they issue. For although in their civil carriage one
toward another, they have especial good virtues, well worth the imitating,
being a people, for the most part, of a grave and stayed behavior, very
respective and courteous, not curious, or meddling in other men's matters, besides
that ancient frugalitie in their diet, which to their great case and benefit
they still retain.

And there be also amongst them, as in all other places, some men of excellent
and rare perfection, yet can it not be dissembled, but that generally the
whole Country is strongly overflovvne and overcome with wickedness, with
filthiness of speech, with beastliness of actions, both governors and
subjects, both priests and Friars, each striving (as it were) with other in
impudency therein, even so far forth, that what in other places vvoulde not
be tolerated, is there in high honor, what elsewhere even a lose person
would be ashamed to co^fes, their priests and Friars refrain not openly to
practice, yea, if any man forbear the like, they find it very strange, and
hold integrity for little better then seeliness or abiectnesse. I cannot here
forget the saying of an Italian Gentleman of very good quality, but in
faction Spanish, at my first entry into Italy: namely that the Italians were
excellent men but for three faults they had: in their lust they were
unnatural; in their malice unappeasable, and that they would deceive all men.
Unto which he might truly have added; They spend more upon other men, then upon
themselves, they blaspheme oftener then swear, and murder more then revile or
slander: notwithstanding, this testimony I yield, not only willingly, but
gladly to them: (for what joy could it be to the heart of any man, to see men
fall irrecoverablely from the love and laws of the Creator:) That at one time
of the year, (namely at Lent,) they are much reformed, no such blaspheming or
durty speaking, their vanities of all sorts reasonablely laid aside, their
pleasure abandoned, their apparel, their diet and all things else composed to
austerity and state of penance. They have daily their preaching with collection
of alms whereof all men resort: and to judge of them by the outward show, they
seem to have generally a great remorce of their wickedness: in so much, that
I must confess, I seemed to my self in Italy, to have learned the right use
of Lent, there first to have discerned the right fruit of it, and the reason
for which those sages at the first did institute it; neither can I easily
accord to the fancies of such (as because we ought at all times to lead a
life worthy of our profession) think it therefore superstitious, to have one
time wherein to exact or respect it more then another: But rather do this
conceive, that seeing the corruption of the times and wickedness of man's
nature is now so exorbitant, that a hard matter it is, to hold the ordinary
sort of men at all times within the lists of piety, justice, and sobriety, it
is fit therefore that their should be one time at least in the year, and that
of a reasonable continuance, wherein the season it self, the use of the world,
and practife of all men (for even the Jews and Turks have their Lent, though
different) the commandment of superious, and in some the very outward face
and expectation as it were of all things, should constrain men (how wicked
and retchlesse soever) for that time to recall themselves to some more severe
cogitations and courses, lest sin having no such Bridle to check it at any
time, should at length wax headstrong and unconquerable in them; that on the
other side being thus necessarily invred for a while, at least wise to make a
bare show of walking in the paths of virtue, they might afterward perhaps
more sincerely, and willingly persist, or at least wise return more readily
unto them some other time. And verily I have sundry times had this cogitation
in Italy, that in great looseness of life, and decay of discipline in those
parts, it was the special great mercy and grace of God, that the severitie
of Lent should be still preserved, least otherwise the floods of sin growing
so headstrong, and outrageous, and having no where, either bound or bank to
restrain them; might plunge that whole Nation into such a gulf of
wickedness, and bring them to that last extremity, which should leave the^
neither hope for better, nor place for worse: yea and I was so far from
thinking the institution of Lent superfluous, or the restraint in it
unprofitable, that I rather inclined to like the custom of the Greek Church,
who besides their great Lent, have three other Lents also in the year, though
the other neither so long, nor yet so strict a general observation. Two things
are further to be added in the honor of Italy: Their Monasteries seemed, for
the most part, to be greatly reformed of that they have been, and of that
they still are in France, and other places, where their looseness of
government, and often scandalles ensuing, does breed them a reputation clean
contrary to their profession, and the reason is whi^^ the Monasteries and
Covent of Friars are not reformed: there is a fear that the Pope has, that
overgreat severitie would cause a great number to disfrier themselves, and
fly to Geneva, upon hope of more liberty, which he estemeth an
inconvenience, more to be shunned, then the former mischeife. An other thing
very memorable, and to be imitated in Italy, is the exceeding good provisions
of Hospitals and houses of piety, for old Persons enfebled, for poor folks
maimed or diseased, for Gentillitie impoverished, for travelers distressed,
for lewd women converted, for children abandoned, which the devotion of former
times have founded and enriched, and this present age does very faithfully
and discretly govern, and if it were not for those houses, in the number,
goodlynesse, and great revenewes whereof, Italy exceeds any one Country in
the world, it might be said to be p^ore and miserable: for though it be
incomparably the richest Nation in Christendom at this day in all the West
parts, by reason of their long peace, and their neighbors long wars, yet
considered that their wealth there, is so ill digested, and so unequally divided
in the body thereof, by the infiniteness and eversucking veins of their
taxes and customs, carrying all their blood to the higher parts, and leaving
the lower ready to faint, starve, and wither, It is not untruly said, that
the rich men of Italy are the richest, and the poor the poorest creatures,
that any one Country can yield again, both which in a well pollicied state
were to be avoided. Besides these Hospitalles, they have their houses of free
loan to the poor, which is so^e help, seeing Italy of all other places is
most infected with Usury*

But now to come to the view of their Ecclesiastical government, how it is
referred to the conduct of souls to their true happiness (which should be the
natural and proper end of that regiment, whereof I can say little,) and how it
is addressed to the upholding of their worldly power, and glory of their Order,
to the advancing of their part, and overthrow of their opposites, which I
suppose to be the chief point they now respect; as I think it may be truly
said, that there was never yet state framed by man's wit in the world, more
powerful and forcible to work those effects, never any more wisely contrived
and plotted, more constantly and diligently put in practice and execution, that
if the foundation be free from untruth and dishonestie (for rottenness of
heart is an infirmity which will ruin all strength builded thereon) their
outward means were sufficient to subdue a whole world. Now as in every Art and
Science there are some certain propositions, upon the virtue whereof all the
rest depend, so in their Art also they have certain assertions which as
indemonstrable principles they urge all to receive and hold in this manner. ^
That they are the church of God, within the which there is great facility, and
without which there is no possibility of salvation. 2 That divine prerogative
is granted unto them abve all the people in the world, which does preserve them
everlastingly from erring in matters of faith, and from falling from GOD. 3
That the Pope being Christ's deputy, has the keys of heaven in custody, to
admit in by Indulgence, and shut out by excommunication, as he shall see cause.
4 That the charge of all souls being committed to him, he is thereby made
sovereign prince of this world, exceeding in power and majesty all other
princes, as far as the soul in dignity does exceed the body, and eternal
things surmount things temporal: and seeing the end, is the ruler and
commander of whatsoever do tend unto it, and all things in this world are to
serve but as instruments; and the world it self but as a passage to our
everlasting habitation. 5 That therefore he that has the managing of this high
honor to be the supreme conductor unto it, has also power to dispose of all
things subordinate as may best serve to it, to plant, to root out, to
establish, to depose, to bind, to loose, to alter, to dispense, as may serve
most fit for the advancement of the church, and for the atcheving of the
souls felicity, wherein whosoever oppose against him, whether by Heresy or
Schism, they are no other then very Rebels or seditious persons, against whom
he has unlimited and endless power, to proceed to the suppressing, ruining
and extinguishing of them by all means that the Common-welth of God may
flourish in prosperity, and the high way to heaven be kept safe and open for
all Gods loyal and obedient people. In these points no doubts or questions
are tolerable And whosoever with them join in these, shall find great connivence,
in what other defect or difference soever: this being the very touchstone by
which all men are to be tried, whether they be in the Church, or out of the
Church; whether with them, or against them: and by this plott have their wits
erected in this world, a Monarchy more potent then ever any that have been
before it: A Monarchye, which intitling them ( de iure) to all the world,
lays a strong foundation thereof in all men's conciences, (the only firm
ground of obedience in the world) and such a foundation, as not only holds
fast unto them whatsoever it feazeth on, but works outwardly also by engines,
to weaken, and undermine the states of all other Princes how great so ever,
and that in such sort, as by possessing themselves of the principal places,
the hearts of their subjects (as being those from whom they have their
principal good, even the happiness of their souls) to incite upon every
conscience a gaynest their natural Sovereign at pleasure, and by a writ of
Excommunication to svbdue, or at leastwise greatly to shake whom they list,
without fighting a blow, without leavying a Soldier; and lastly, a Monarchy
which as it was founded by mere wit, needs not any thing but mere wit
to mainetaine it, which enricheth it self without laboring, warreth without
endangering, rewards without spending, using Colleges to a great purpose, as
others can fortresses, and working greater matters, partly by Scholars, partly
by swarms of Friars, than else they could ever do by great garrisons and
armies. And all these maintained at other men's charges, for to that rare point
have they also proceeded, as not only to have huge rents themselves out of
other men's states, but to maintain also their instruments out of other men's
devotions, and to advance their favorites, under the fair pretense of
providing for Religion, to the very principal preferments in foreign Princes
Dominions. That no man need find it strange, if finding the revenew of skill
and cunning to be great, and their force mighty, especially what they work
upon simplicity, and ignorance. They enclosed in times past all learning
within the walls of their Clergy, setting forth Lady Ignorance for a great
Saint to the Laity, and showing her unto them for the true mother of Devotion.
And assuredly, but for one great defect in their policy, which was hard in
regard of their own particular ambition, but otherwise not impossible to be
avoided; That they choose their Pope lightly very old, and withal, without
any restraint of all Families and Nations, whereby they are continually subject
to double change of government: The Successor seldom prosecuting his
Antecessors devices, but either crossing them through envy, or abandoning them
upon new humor, it could not have been, but they must have long since been
absolute Lords of all: which defects notwithstanding (so strong was their
policy by reason of the force of their Cardinal fonndation:) That no Prince,
or Potentate ever opposed against them, but in fine, even by his own Subjects,
they either maistered him, or utterly brought him to good conformity, by great
loss and extreamitie, t^ll such time as in his latter age the bottom of the
foundation it self being stoutly discovered, has given them a sore blow, has
changed in great part the state of the question, and has driven them to a
re-inforcement of new inventions and practices.

12 Howbeit those positions being the ground of their state, and the hope of
their own glory, in them they admit no shadow of alteration, but endeavor
still per fas and nefas, even by all the means in the world to strengthen
them, and (amongst their manifold adversaries) hate them most of all other, who
have labored most in stopping of that foundation. And seeing that by reason of
this bookish age, they have not that help of ignorance which in times past
they had, they cast about greatly to soake and settle them in men's persuasions
and consciences by another way: They tell men, that the very gound whereon we
build our persuasion of the truth of Christianity it self, are no other then
credible: That the proofs of the Scripture to be the word of God can be no
other at this day than probable, only being impossible for any wit in the
world to produce, exact, necessary, and infallible demonstrations: Either that
the holy Apostle Saint Paul had his calling from above, or that those Epistles
were of his writing, so likewise in the rest, and that the chief proof that
we have thereof, is the testimony of the church, a thing which their very
adversaries are forced to confess. Now that this probable persuasion of the
truth of Christianity does afterward grow to an assuredness thereof, this
issues from an inward operation of Gods divine spirit, the gift whereof is
faith; and that faith being a knowledge, not of bare science, but of belief,
which searches not the particular necessity of the verity of things
delivered, but relieth in general upon the approoved wisdom, truth and
virtue of him that does deliver it. Then surely, whosoever will have necessary
proof of the several Articles of Religion, does but wittily deceive himself,
and by overcurious endeavor to change his faith into science, does loose that
which he seeks to perfect: If then without faith there is no possibly of
Salvation, this surely must needs be the hie way to perdition. Now seeing
christianity to be a doctrine of faith, a doctrine whereof all men, even
children are capable, as being gross, and to be believed in general: The high
virtue whereof ^s in the humility of understanding, and the merit in the
readiness of obedience to embrace it (for these have been always the true
owners of faith.) And seeing the outward proofs are no other than probable,
and of all probable proofs, the Church testimony is most probable: what
madness were it for any man to tire out his soul, and to waste away his
spirits, in tracing out all the thorhy paths of the controversies of these
days, wherein to err is no less easy than dangerous, what through forgery
abusing him, through Sophistry transporting him, and not rather to betake
himself to the right path of truth, whereunto God and Nature, Reason and
Experience do all give witness: and that is to associate himself to that
Church, whereunto the custody of this heavenly and supernatural truth has
been from heaven it self committed, to weigh discretely which is the true
Church, and that being once found, to receive faithfully and obediently
without doubt or discussion whatsoever it delivers. Now concerning the first
point some doubt might be made, if there were any Church Christian in the world
to be showed which had continued from Christ's time down to this age, without
change or interruption, this only excepted: But if all other have had their end
or decay long since, or their beginning but of late, if theirs be founded by
the Prince of the Apostles, with promise by him, That hell gates should not
prevail against it, but that himself would be assisting to it, until the
consummation of the world, which has continued on, now to the end of a
thousand six hundred and four years, with an honorable and certain line of
two hundred and forty Popes, all being Successors of Saint Peter; both
Tyrants and Traitors, both Pagans, and Heretics, in vain wrestling raging
barking, and undermining, if all the lawful Councels that ever were in the
world, being the general Senates of Gods officers and Ministers have from time
to time approved, obeyed, and honored it; if God have so miraculous^y blessed
it from above, as that so many sage Doctors should in^ich it with their
writings, such armies, yea millions of Saints with their holiness, of Martires
with their blood, of Virgins with their purity, should sanctify and seal it;
if their Church have been a ruin always to them that opposed against her, a
stay, repose, and advancement to all her followers; if even at this day in such
difficulties of rebellions and revolts of her nearest children, yet she
stretches out her arms to the uttermost corners the world, embracing whole
Nations into her bosom; If lastly in all other opposite Churches whatsoever,
there be nothing to be found but inward dissension and contrariety, change of
opinions, uncertainty of resolutions, robbing of churches, robellion against
Governors, confusion of orders, nothing to be attended but mischefe,
subversion, and destruction (which they have well deserved, and shall assuredly
have) whereas contrary, in their Churches, the unity undivided, the obedience
unforced, the resolvtions unalterable, the most heavenly order reaching from
the height of all power, to the very lowest of all subjection, with admirable
harmony, and vndefective corresponde^cie, al tending to the same way, to the
effecting of the same work, did promise no other than continuance, increase,
and victory. Let no man d^^bt to submit himself to this glorious spouse of
God, ^^ whose head is the blessing of God, in whose hand is the power of God,
under whose feet are the enemies of God, and to whom round about do service all
the creatures of God. This then being accorded to be the true Church of God, it
follows that she be reverently obeyed in all things, without further
inquifition, having this warrant, That whosoever hears her, heaeth Christ, and
whosoever hears her not, has no better place then a Publican or a Pagan. And
what folly were it to receive the Scripture upon the credit of her authority,
and not to receive the interpretation also upon her authority and credit? And
if GOD should not protect his Church always from error, and peremptorily
command all men to obey her, then had he made but slender provision for the
Salvation of mankind, to whom error in matter of faith is certain
damnation; which conceit of God (whose care of us, even in all things
touching this transitory life, is so plain and evident) were ungrateful and
impious. And hard were the case, and mean had been his regard of the vulgar
people, whose wants and difficulties in this life will not permit; whose
capacities will not suffice, to sound the deep and hidden mysteries of
divinity, to search out intricate controversies, if there were not other, whose
authority they might rely on: Blessed therefore are they which believe and have
not seen, the ^^erite of whose religious humility and obedience, does exceed
perhaps in honor and acceptance before God, the subtle and profound
knowledge of many other. And lastly, if any man, either in regard of his
vocation, or reason of his leisure, list to study the controversies, let him
take heed he come not with a doubtful mind unto the^, (for diffidence is as
the sin of rebellion) let him be steadfast in faith, let him submitt his own
reason to the Churches authority, being the house of God, the pillar and
ground of truth, let him be fast and immoveably built upon that foundation,
and let his end only be this; to furnish and arm himself in such sort, as
to be able to withstand and overthrow those heretics, when, they shall at
any time chose or chance to encounter, This is the maine course of of their
persuading at this day, whereby they seek to reestablish that former
foundation: In the unfolding whereof, I have been the longer because trial
has taught me that not by some men's private election, but as it should seem
by common order* direction, or consent, they have relinquished all other
courses, and do hold them to this as the most effectual means, by the way of
persuasion to work this design. In considering whereof, there comes to my
mind, that diversity which a wise Philosopher has intimated in the wits of
men; That some are of so sharp, deep, and strange discourse, that they yield
not their assent unto any thing until they have found out, either some proper
demonstration for it, or some other certain proof whereon to ground it
^suredly, Others are so shallow and weak in that faculty, that they fear
always error: and therefore do more willingly accord to whatsoever some of
account for wisdom do barely affirm, then to any thing which this reason
alone (which they suspect) infers. Now these latter exceeding the other, as
far in number, as in worthynesse and honor of nature, they are exceeded by
them; the Romanist taking a course so fitting to the feeble and fearful
humor of this sort, do greatly sway with them, whereas if they meet with one of
the former, of more tough constitution, that will not be carried away with those
plausible declamations, nor yield his consent in gross, without particular
examinations, they bestow small cost on him as having small hope to prevail:
wherein I hold them wise in the rules of policy; that having found by
certain and vnfaileable experience, that the ignorance of the Laity was the
cheifest and surest finewe of their greatness and glory, they now being not
able to keep them longer in that blind ignorance, do cunningly endeavor so
to lead them out of the briars, as to enter them withal into a second kind
of ignorance; that being not content to see utterly nothing, at leastwise they
may be persuaded to resign up their own eye sight, and to look through such
spectacles as they temper for them.

13 This being the maine groundwork of their policy, and these the
general means to build and establish it in the minds of all men, the
particular ways they hold to ravish all men's affections, and to fit each
humor, (their jurisdiction and power being but persuasive and voluntary) are
well nie infinite, there being not any thing, either sacred, or profane, no
virtue or vice almost, no things of how contrary conditions soever, which they
make not, in some sort, to serve their turn; that each fancy may be satisfied,
and each appetite find what to feed on; whatsoever either wealth can sway
with the lovers, or voluntary poverty with the despisers of the world; what
honor with the ambitious, what obedience with the humble, what great
employment with the stirring mettald spirits, what perpetual quiet with heavy
and restive bodies, what content the pleasant natures can take in pastimes and
iol^itywhat contrariwise, the austere minds in discipline and rigor; what
love, either chastity can raise in the pure, or voluptuousness in the
dissolute; what alurements are in knowledge to draw the contemplative, or in
actions of state, to possess the practique dispositions; what prerogative of
reward can work with the hopeful; what terrors, doubts, and dangers with the
fearful; what change of vows with the rash, of estate with the inconstant;
what pardons with the faulty or supplies with the defective; what miracles with
the credulous, what visions with the fantastical, what gorgeousness of shows
with the vulgar and simple, what multitude of ceremonies with the
superstitious, what prayer with the devoute, what works of piety with the
charitable, what rules of higher perfection with the elevated affections, what
dispe^cing with the breach of all rules with men of lawless conditions: In
sum, what thing soever can prevail with any man, either for himself to
pursue, or at leastwise to love, reverence, or honor in another, (for therein
also man's nature receives great satisfaction) the same is found with them, not
as in other places of the world by casualty, blinded, without order, and of
necessity; but sorted into great parts, into several professions,
countena^ced with the reputatio^n, honored with prerogatives, and facilitated
with provisions and yearly main tenance: and either as the better things
advanced with ex pectation of rewards, or borne with, how bad soever, with
silent tolleration, what pomp, what riot, to that of the Cardinals,? what
severity of li^e comparable to the Heremits and Cap^chi^s, who wealthier then
their Prelates, who poorer by vow and profession, then their Mendic ants; on
the one side of the street, a Cloister of Virgins, on the other a stye of
Curtezans, with poblique permission: to day all in maskes, with all looseness
and foollery, to morrow all in processions, whipping themselves till the blood
follow: upon one door, an excommunication, throwing down to hell all
transgressors, on another, a jubilee or full discharge from all
transgressions. Who more learned in all kind of sciences then their Jesuits;
who more ignorant then their ordinary Mass priests; what Prince so able to
prefer his servants and followers as the Pope and in so great multitude; who
able to take deeper or readier revenge of his enemies; what pride equal to his
making Kings kiss his pantables, what humility greater then his shriving
himself daily on his knees, to an ordinary Priest, who more difficult in
giving dispach to the greater, who easier in giving audience to the meanest:
where greater rigor in the world, in exacting the observation of the Church
laws; where less care and conscience of the commandments of God: To taste
flesh on a Friday where suspicion might fasten, were a matter for the
Inquisition: whereas on the other side, the Sunday is one of their greatest
market days. To conclude, never government, never state in the world so
strongly compacted of infinite contrarieties, all tending to entertain the
several humors of all men, and to work what kind of effects soever they
shall desire, where rigor and remissness, cruelty and lenity are so
combined, that with neglect of the Church to stir ought, is a sin
unpardonable, whereas with duty toward the Church, by intercession for her
allowance, with respective attendance for her pleasure, no Law almost of God
or Nature, so sacred, which one way or other, they find not means to dispense
with, or at least wise, permit the breach of, by connivence and without
disturbance.

But to proceed to their more particular proiectes, and more mystical devises,
for the perpetuating of their greatness; there was never yet state so well
built in the world, having his ground, as theirs has, in the good will of other
and notwithstanding by his own maine strength and power, that could longer
uphold it self in flourishing reputation and prosperity, then it could make
it self necessary to them by whom it subsisted. All callings of men, all
degrees in commonwealths, yea particular great personages, are then wayning
in their greatness, when they decay in their necessarinesse to them from whom
they have it, which the Papacy nothing ignorant of, has by secret cunning, so
deeply engaged and interessed from time to time, the greatest Monarchs in
Christendom, in the upholding of his estate, that without the Papacy, sundry
of them have no hope, and some no title to continue in their Dominion. For (to
omit things more apparent and in the eyes of all men,) they have pretended
authority to excommunicate and depose them, to discharge subjects of all oaths
and bonds of obedience, to oblige them under pain of damnation to rise against
them, to honor their murderers with the title of Martyrs (for to that degree
of extremity has some of their sect grown.) The effect of which proceeding,
some Princes have felt, and most have Dispensing within degrees forbidden.
feared, and few at this day list to put it to adventure: the te^pering with so
unlimited power of Princes mari^ges, by dispensing with degrees, by the law of
God and the world forbidden, by loosing and knitting marriage, by devise at
pleasure; by legittimating unlawful and accursed issue, and thereby advancing
into Thrones of regalitie, oftentimes base, sundry times adulterous, yea,
sometimes incestuous, and perhaps, unnatural of springs does not Reason
foretell, and has not experience thought, that both the parties in such
marriages, and much more their whole issue, are bound in as strong a bond to the
vp-holding of the Popes infinite authority and power, as the honor of their
birth, and the title of their Crown are worth? It was a s^ely conceit in them
which hoped that Queen Mary would not uphold the Popes authority in England,
by reason of her promise when a greater bond to her, then her promise did
press her to it. What man ever in the world, stuck faster to his chosen
friend, then the late King of Spain Philip did to the Papacy?
(notwithstanding with the Popes themselves, his often ielousies and quarrels)
who ordained moreover, that all his heirs and successors in the estate of the
Low Countries, by virtue of his late transport, shall for ever upon their
entry into those Seigniories, take an oath for the maintaining of the Papacy
and that Religion. Is not the reason apparent, that if the Papacy should
quail, his only son whosoever descend of him, is dishonured and made
incapable of those great Estates and Kingdoms which now he holds, yea and a
fire kindled in his own house about the title to them? neither is it to be
admitted into any conceit of reason, but that this young King will be as sure
to the Papacy, as his father, being borne of a marriage prohibited by God,
abhorred happily by Nature, disaproved by the world, and only by papal
authority made alowable. For (for my part I hold not that opinion improbable)
that the marriage of Uncle and Ne^ce, (as it was in this case) was contrary to
the law of Nature, and not to Gods positive lawonely, seeing the Uncle has a
second right and place of a father. But howsoever that point stand, wherein I
dare not affirm ought, it is creerely contrary to such a positive law of God,
as the reason and cause thereof must needs continue unto the dissolution of
the world, or overthrow of mankind. And therefore, in reason and law, no way
agreeable or dispensable with, but by the same or higher authority, then that
which first did make it: that the Pope need not think that they do him so
apparent wrong, who invest him with the title of that man of power, who sitting
in the temple of God, exalts himself above God. For what may it seem else,
bearing himself head of the Church, to take upon him to council, or
authentically to allow of the breach of Gods law, without having his express
and precise commission for so doing: Though I am not ignorant, that they have
distinctions for all this, which were a merry matter, if Sophistry were a
proper science of sal vatio^. But by this and some other marriages, those
strainge relations of aliance have grown: that K. Philip (were he alive might
call the Archd. Albert, both brother, cosen* nephew and son; for all this were
he unto him, either by blood or affinity, being uncle to himself, cosen
germain to his father, husband to his sister, and father to his wife. and to
come a step nearer home the same rule of Policy made me greatly fear (til now
that god by death has prevented the mischeife) howsoever hitherto, what for
fear of sca^dalizing, what for other respects the Pope made show, not to be
forward to co^se^t to a intended marriage betwe^ a married K. and his Mistress,
much less to legittimate the children adulterously begotten, by finding
nullities on both sides in the former marriages things made of purpose, as he
knows, to cloak a falshoode, that yet notwithstanding himself or his
successors, would yield to it in the end, if any color in the world could be
laid up on the matter, to salve the credit of his not erring Sea: And he
might see good hope for that race to prevail, deriving the sucession also of
his other great Kingdom upon issue, whose title must hold upon his
legittimation he might be better assured of it, then he has been hitherto,
and have them ever firm and irreconcilable adversaries, to all those, whither
subjects or neighbors, or whosoever, as should oppose against his Soveraigntie
and vnstinted power. So searching and penetrant is that Sea, to strengthen it
self more by the unlawful marriages of other men, that ever Prince yet could
do, by any lawful marriage of his own,

15 The dispencing with oaths, and discharging from them, especially in
matters of treaty between Princes and Estates, is a thing so repugnant to all
moral honesty, Dispensation with oaths.
so injurious to the quiet and peace of the world, so odious in it self, so
scandalous to all men, that it may be, they adventure not to play upon that
string in this curious age, so often as heretofore, for fear of discording all
the rest of their harmony. Clear it is, that heretofore this made them a
necessary help for all such Princes, as either upon extremity, were driven
to enter into hard conditions, or upon falsehood and dishonesty, desired to take
their advantage against their neighbors when it was offered: In which, Princes
having no means to salve their credit with the world, but only by justifying
the unholiness of the Art, by the Popes holy authority interposed in it, were
afterward tied firmly to adhere unto them. And this was the cause that
Francis the first of France, with whom (immediately upon his oath, given to
Charles the fifth, for performance of the articles, accorded at his delivery (
Clement the 7. dispensed, and by probable conjecture, had promised to dispense
with his oath, before he had made it upon hope whereof also he took it: the
effect was for the Popes behoof, that ever after there was strict love and
amity between them testified finally to the world by that famous marriage
between the son of the one, and the kinswoman of the other. And verily,
though I hold in general too much suspitiousnesse, as great a fault, and as
great an enemy to wisdoms, as too much Incredulity (it doing oftentimes as
great a vvrong to friends, as the other does receive vvrongfull hurt from
dissemblers:) yet vievving the short continuance of sworn leagues at this
day, the small reckoning that Princes make of oaths solemnly taken, whether
to neighbors or subjects; not faith but profit being the bond of aliance and
amity, which altering once, the other have no longer during: it makes me
think it not possible, that Popes unlimited fingers may be stirring even at
this day more often in secret, in untying those knots of the bonds of
conscience then the world is ware of: at leastwise, that by authority and
imitation of his example, Princes assume unto themselves a like faculty of
dispencing with their own oaths, whenever they can persuade themselves it is
behooveful to their kingdom, as he when to his Church. But howsoever that
stands, this is very apparent, that by this Doctrine and policy, the Popes
opposices and enemies (especially the states and Princes of the reformed
Religion) are inestimably prejudiced, being reduced hereby to a continual
uncertainty and confusion in all their weightiest actions, counsels, and
resolutions, there being a warrant for all men to break league and oath with
them, and no need of particular dispensation from his holiness. Their Church
long since by her rules, and some of great reckoning amongst them, more lately
by their writings have published and preached to all the world, that faith given
to heretics is not to be kept; that leagues with them are more honorable in
their breaking, then in their making, denying that right unto Princes of
Christian profession, which Christians unto Heathens, Heathens one to another,
of how different religion soever; yea al honorable princes unto very traitors
and rebels, have always kept vnviolable. And finally, if father Parsons at his
last coming to Rome, pretending to make peace betwixt the E^glish scholars,
and the Jesuits (who were charged with too much indirect dealing, and large
imblessing) and set^ing down certain indifferent Articles between them to
that purpose, whereby each part should be bound to desist impugning of the
other, did by handling the matter with such conveiance and cunning, (imitating
therein a rule of fast on the one side, and loose on the other, in the ground
of their order) as first to swear the Scholars, to observe that which was
their part, and after to leave the Jesuits unsworn to theirs, to effect his
secret and ambitious intent; and to the great grief of the Scholars, made the
Jesuits their governors: what other account can be made of these leagues and
peaces betwixt those of the Roman, and of the reformed religion, but that the
one side being tied by oath, and the other left free, (for so are they taught)
they shall so far-forth have performance and continuance, as shall be to the
advancement and profit of that party which esteems it self at liberty, the
sacred, the sovereign instrument of all justice amongst me^, what is it, what
can it be in the world but an oath, being the strongest bound of conscience?
This is the end of strifes particular; this is the sodder of public peace, and
the sole assurance of amity between diverse nations, which being made here
below, is enrolled in his high Court, whose glorious name does sign it, who
has made no grant of access to his celestial palace, but to such as have
sworn true, though it redound to their own damage, yet swarve not from it;
that nothing but mischief can be presaged to the world, in this age most
wretched, wherein Pe^iuty has undermined the tribunals of judgment, which has
chased out true justice out of the world, and left no place for a just man
where to stand against the crafty: But what may be said when he that sits
in the Temple of God, shall so far advance himself above God; as to dispense
with oaths made sacred by the most holy and high name of God? when he that
professes himself sole vmpire and peacemaker of the world, shall cut in
sunder those only finewes that hold peace together? when the father of Princes
shall carry himself with so wicked partiality, and cast (by dissolving of oaths)
affliction on the party he hates, and making the other perpetually obnoxious
to him to work his own certain advantage from both? and lastly, by making of
that ancient bridle of the unjust, to be now an only snare to entrap the
innocent, and impose that blemish upon Christianity, which the Pagans in their
natural morality have abhorred?

I will not here omit one other great help, which casualty rather then cunning
may seem to have wrought, it falling out often in the affairs of men, that
where wisdom has furnished out sundry aids and instruments, there some also
do frame themselves (as it were by chance) resulting out of the concurre^ce of
diverse accidents with the former, as at this day the greatness of the house
of Austia, extending it self well nigh to all quarters of Europe, and
confining with many of the Popes principal adversaries, who having long since
upon the rich purchase which they had of the Indies, devoured in assured hope
and conceit, the Monarchy of our Western world, and finding no fitter means
to enlarge their temporal Dominions, than by concurring with the Pope, in
restoring his spiritual, have linked themselves most fast with his Sea, and
investing themselves voluntarily with an Office of their own direction, have
taken upon them to be the executioners of his Excommunications, that having
title from the Pope who gives his enemies the foil by distracting their own
Subjects from them, upon fear of his curse: the rest they may supply out of
their own force and opportunities: having erected for this purpose that
superpolitique and irrefragable order (as they count it) of the Jesuits, who
couple in their persuasions, as one God, and one Faith; so one Pope also, and
one King, bearing the world in hand, and there is no other means in the world
for the Church to stand, but by resting upon this pillar, and by uniting in
this sort all the forces of the Christians: this the only means to vanquish
the Archenemy of Christianity, that the Italians may not brag to have been
the only men, who have subdued the world unto them by their wit, the Spaniards
having prooved so good Scholars in their Schools, that though they follow
them in their grounds of pretending the advancement of Religion, and in their
instruments of religious Orders, to practice men's minds with, yet in this they
outgoe them, that they use the Popes weapons, lightnings and thunderings, and
terrors for instruments of their own greatness, and his hope of reestablishing
his spiritual reputation by them, to the immoderate increase of their secular
power by him, that the Pope also himself must in the end be constrained to
cast himself into their arms, and to remain at their devotion, acknowledging
him henceforward for his good Lord and Patron, who^ he has heretofore governed
and commanded as his Son, a point which as some of the ministers of Spain, in
the height of their pride have not been able to hold in, but have braved the
assembly of Cardinals to their beards, that they hope ere long to see the day
that their master should tender half a dozen to the Pope to be made Cardinals
at once, whereof he should not dare to refuse to choose any one. And the
Cardinals themselves should as little da^e to choose any other Pope then whom
he named, so their too important pressing of the Pope in these latter times to
serve all their ambitious and raging turns* in the long preiudicing the
liberty of the Conclave in their elections have given them good assurance,
that they speak as they mean, that their brags are hopes and purposes, and
these threatenings (being the natural fruits of the Spanish hautines and
insolency, who in the pride of their Monarchy are grown now also to swear by
the life of their king) have extremely perplexed some of the later Popes, and
driven them to very extraordinary and desperate resolutio^s, which they have
paid for de^rly, and in general, have made it enacted for a rule in that sea,
not so much to seek the repairing of their foreign spiritual authority (if it
cannot be done but by means of so huge inconvenience) as to strengthen and
make themselves great in their temporal estate at home, yet seeing France,,
beyond all hope of Man reunited within it self, and likely to flourish as in
his former prosperity, whereby they shall be able to balance these
Monarchies, as to make that part the heavier, to which they shall propend (an
ancient rule and continual practice of that Sea) I should not greatly doubt,
but that they will be content again henceforward, so long as matters stand in
the terms they do, to entertain that good correspo^dencie with the house of
Austria, as to serve them with their Excomunications, that they may be served
by them with their Executions. The sweetness whereof, as the Spaniard has
long since tasted, in effect (having seized on a Manor, by that only pretense,
and of late times in high conceit and hope, trusting to have embraced both
Frannce and England by the same means) so I doubt not but that other branch
of the house of Austria in Germany, which has engrossed, and in a manner
^ntailed to their house, so many elective states; the Empires, the kingdom of
Bohemia with his dependa^ces, and of Hungary, and were likely also of late to
have added the Princedome of Transylvania, whenever they should att^ine quiet
and security from the Turk, which has no great unlikelihood to be compassed
in short time, would take the same course against the Protestants of Germany,
having so many Prelates and o^b^rs there to assist them, (who by rooting the
Protestants out of all their estates have prepared a good ground for such a
future exploite) howsoever the Pope himself does yet forbear his thunders,
having learned by his loss elsewhere, that it argues in these actions, more
courage than w^^te, to make noise before the blow be ready. Now, as these are
the hopes of the house of Austria, for the enlarging of their estates, and
molesting of their neighbors, so for the entertaining of perpetual unity and
love amongst themselves they use the grand preservative and help of marriage,
the only sure bond of amity in the world. Insomuch, that by continual
inter-marrying amongst themselves, they remain still as brethren all of one
Family, and as arms of the self same body: These take I to be the means
whereby the Papacy has assured so many of the greatest unto it.

17 To descend from which, to those that are next to them in degree, as the
nobility, and other persons of worth and quality* the Papacy is not
unprovided of his Instruments to work upon these also; she has her baits to
allure them, her hooks to retain them* I will not stand much upon the
benefit their confession does herein yield them, whereby prying into the
hearts and consciences of all men, they attain knowledge of the secrets, they
sound the dispositions, they discover the humors of all the most respective and
able persons, of what country, or calling, place, or quality soever* A matter
of singular consideration in the managing of affairs, of principal importance
for the well guiding of Councelles: The ignorance whereof has been the cause
of error in the wisest deliberations, and of uncertain success in the most
grounded resolutio^s: to omit the great wealth which they heap thereby,
persuading their Penitents, especially in that only hour of agony and
extremity, to ra^some their sins committed against God, by consecrating their
goods unto the Church of God, whereby they have prevailed in all places (so
far the Jesuits above all other, who are noted and envied by other orders of
friars, for engrossing the commodity of being rich men's Confessors, when good
is to be done, with whom their prankes in that kind have been so rare and
memorable, that most states at this day have been forced, by public order,
to limite the proportion of that kind of purchase) for in that case they can
easily extenuate those other helps of Indulgence, and of Requiems, and their
privileged Altars. And yet without touch of the Popes omnipotency: They count
them but simple folks, that cannot use their several devises, without crossing
one of the other, how contrary soever. They can tell them, that it may be for
want of contrition in themselves those sovereign pardons wanted a fit
Subject to work on; and so for other after-helps, the want of intention in the
Priest may frustrate the Mass of the prerogative of virtue, whereby their
souls may perhaps fry in Purgatory, when their friends shall imagine they
shine in Glory, that the only sure way of having good, is doing good. And what
good to be done at his death, but by bestowing well of his goods? And where
better bestowing them than upon him that gave them? And to GOD they are given,
when they are given unto his Ministers.

18 And here I will no other than mention only the Cardinals.
help which the choice of their Cardinals does yield herein, whom they
choosing a great part of the most noble and potent families, that either
voluntarily desire it, or otherwise can be induced to accept it, they both give
good satisfaction to all foreign Nations, and especially hold Italy to them
in special devotion, and strengthen themselves with the favor and support of
those men's ki^reds, whom they have placed in the next step to the top of
their glory; yea, and oftentimes by means of these Car, dinals (their assured
instruments) they insinuate themselves into the swaying of the government of
those estates, wherein, either by their Nobility, or other worth, they bear
authority; A policy of long vsag^ and observed by many.

19 But Jewels are rare, and for few men's wearing* the multitude and diversity
of men of spirit requires also store and variety of competent living and
preferments to entertain them with good content and corespondencie; a thing in
all estates of very necessary and chief regard, wherein, although the Papacy
seem at the first blush to have no furniture extraordinary above other
Princes, save only in one kind, for men of Ecclesiastical calling, by which
he is able to advance men of learning incomparably above any other Prince in
the world, as having welnie all the Archbishopricks and Bishoprics in Italy,
with other Church Livings almost half the benefices in Spain, very many
Ecclesiastical preferments of all sorts in other countries at his bestowing.
And if we look into the use and practice of these times, it will appear,
that even by Ecclesiastical livings, he partly accommodateth, and partly
suffers to be accommodated, all professions and ages, though neither fit nor
very capable of Ecclesiastical order, what by dispensations or tollerations
to be administrators to Abbeys, Bishoprics, and other benefices as is used
in France. What (as in Italy and Spain) by assignations of yearly pensions
out of their revenewes, which being so great as they are, they may easily, and
having hope of aspiring they may willingly bear: and most of this out of the
dominions and territories of other Princes, and without any charging or
impoverishing of his own: A choice and refined piece of high Quintessence of
wit, which yet never State could distill out of their brains to aspire unto,
besides the Papacy. To let pass the infinite number of Honors and Lyvings,
what Ecclesiastical, what subordinate, and ministerial to them, and what also
in part temporal as belonging to the Knights of the holy Orders, which are
many. All which, although not directly in his own donation, yet in that they
have their right, either grounded, or greatly favored and continued by his
religion: And in decay of that (as experience has showed) were likely to
quail, are strong proppes to the upholding of the Papacy* arming so many
tongues and hands in the defense thereof, as either are, or have hope to be
advanced by it, each drawing his friends and followers with him. A sweet
enchanter and deceiver of men, is the hope of honor and worldly profit, which
lulling often even in the better sort) the conscience asleep, does awaken
withal, and sharpen the wit, to find out arguments for the prooving of that
conclusion, which affection before has framed, and by custom continues, and
ingendreth in them a persuasion that they have done well, in that which at the
first, their own knowledge could say otherwise; how powerfully them may it sway
with that other sort of men, whose belly being their god, make their appetite
their sole Religion? which if the experience of former times has not
sufficiently affirmed, it were to be wished perhaps, that more fresh proof
might have been given thereof once again in this kingdom of France* where
some of the wisest and chief have thought, that if the King has accorded to
the Cleargies late supplication, to bestow Church Livings upon fit men, and
only of Ecclesiastical calling, Those Princes and Peers, which n^w in regard
of that particular commodity which they reap from the Church in terms as it
stands, would have unsheathed their swords in defense thereof, would soon
have turned themselves another way, to the utter razing of it, that they might
satisfy their greediness with the spoil of that state, whose pay they could
no longer have.

20 But for the Clergy themselves, who are in all places under the Papacy,
great in number and power, they are most firmly assured to that Sea, what by
the multitude of exemptions and prerogatives above the temporalty, which under
the Popes protection they securely enjoy, what with expecting no other then
utter sacking and ^uine, if the opposites of the Popes should happen to
prevail, so discreet and violent have bin their car^iage in most places,
where they have bin able, eitheir to bring or to pull in their reformation:
yea herein also it has be^alne, as in some other things, that not only casual,
b^^ eve^ more cross accidents have redounded to the Popes great advantage and
benefit. The part which in this age has ^^^ raised against* having wrought
this affect, to ^^^^ the rest more firm, more serviceable, and more zealous
toward him, insomuch whereas in France he was smally regarded of any, but
stomaked at by the Princes, impeached, abridged, and appealed from, by the
Prelates; and lastly, either despised or neglected by the people, the hatred
and rancor conceived against his enemies with eagrenesse of oppositio^,
kindling, and having long continuance therein, has strongly settled and
produced effects of clean contrary nature; the Princes have joined in holy
league, for the upholding of him, the people with all fury have raged, have
fought against, have murdered and massacred his opposites in all places, and
the clergy of France, which heretofore withstoode him in many Councels, does
now call maynly for his Counsel of Trent to be admitted A Council of all
other most partial unto him, and carried by him with such infinite guile, and
craft, without any sincerity, upright dealing, or truth, as that themselves
will even smile in the triumphs of their own wits, (when they hear it but
mentioned) as at a master Stratageme. Yea, so strongly has this opposition
fastened his Clergy unto him, that the name of a General Council is now the
most plausible, which in former time was the most fearful thing to him in the
world, and whereunto he was never brought with any better good will, then an
old bitten Bear is drawn to the stake to be bayted, by his enemies, who dare
tugge him in company, at whom in single they scarce durst bark: so powerful
is the nature of all opposition to increase despite and hatred against the
enemy, and to make friends, especially those that are interessed in the same
cause, to cleave more close together. Yea rather, so wise is the ever admirable
Creator, even in all his works, of what nature so ever, as to temper the very
accidents in the life of man, with such proportion and counterpoise, that no
prosperity without his inconvenience, no adversity without his comfort, to
chase out of man's life security and despair, the only enemies of all virtuous
and honest courses. To each thing has the goodness of that Architect imparted
a peculiar badge of honor, that nothing should be dispiseable in the eyes of
other* the prince in majesty and sovereignty of power, the nobility in wisdom
and dominative virtue, together with the instruments thereof, as riches,
reputation, allies, and followers, and the people in their multitude are
respectable and honorable, which multitude being of so great consequence in
matter of state, the policy of the papacy has not neglected, but provided both
reasonable intertainment for them, and fit means also to practice and work upon
them: here comes in those heaps of their religious orders, and that multitude
of Friars which abound in all places, but wherewith Italy above all does swarm.
A race of people in former times honorable in their holiness, now for the most
part contemptible in their wickedness and misery; always praying, but seldom
with sign of devotion; vowing obedience, but still contentious, chastity, yet
most luxurious; poverty, yet every where scraping and covetous: which I speak
not of the^ all, there being many among them of singular piety and devotion in
their way, but a very small part as they generally reported where ever I have
come. But to return to the aid which the Papacy do reap from them, the only*
contentfull care that the ordinary sort of men have in this world, is for the
providing for their children, to leave them in good estate, and not inferior,
but rather above their ancestors, which those that have many, not being able to
perform, for all it is a great ease to them (and such an ease as even Princes
and great Peers themselves sometimes disdain not, but are rather glad of) to
discharge their hands of some of them, especially of such as by disgrace, or by
defect of nature, are either more backward, or less lovely then other, at an
easy and small ra^e, and yet with honorable pretense, namely by consecrating
them wholly to the service of the Creator, and providing higher place for them
in his celestial Kingdom. For such is their opinions of these orders of
religious and Angelical perfection as they usually style them. The Friars also
themselves, having names given them by their governors, each according to his
merits, importing no less, and as they increase in their holiness, so
proceeding in their titles, from Padre benedicto, to Padre Angelo, then
Archangelo* Cherubino; and lastly Cerephino, which is the top of perfection:
but for their own high conceit of their perfection and merits this example may
serve. I have heard one of their most renowned C^puchines for zeal, sanctity,
and learning, preaching in a principal place before the Bishop, in sharp
reproof of their forsaken crew of blasphemous gamesters, pray solemnly to God
(though acknowledging himself first in humility a great sinner) by his
merits, and discipline, by the tears which his eyes had often shed, by those
many sharp voyages, which for the love of God he had made, by that
chasticement which he had often given himself, because they did grieve (
animam pauperis which was himself) that if there were any, notwithstanding his
admonitions, which should still persist in that wicked gamestry, he would
strike them ere that day twelvemonth with some markeable punishment. The same
man at an other time in an extacie of charity, calling God, all his Angels,
and Saints to witness it, to strip himself of all his merits, there before
the little Crucifix, embracing, and kissing it, and to pray it to reward them,
upon his dearly beloved Auditorie, for whose sakes he was contented also to
be reputed the greatest sinner of all the assembly: Such being their
perfection then in desiring it, must needs issue of an honorable affection.
Now although Italy being a thirsty Manager does in his heart greatly repine at
a custom which their Nunneries have of late brought up, being indeed
constrained to it by the excessive multitude, which in the former respect are
thrust upon them) which is, not receive any gentleman or merchants daughter,
without the dowry of 200, crowns at least, and fifteen or twenty crowns
yearly pension during her life, and ten yearly rent to their house for ever.
Neither admit they of any man's daughter without some crowns also in name of a
dowry at their spiritual marriage to God, and those shall be but serving Nuns
to the former. Yet finding two charges, this is far the easier, they are
content to swallow down that, which by champing on the bit, they can not
remedy. But the orders of religious men bring them an other ease also: It
disburtheneth their country of an infinite number of discontented humors, and
dispairing passions, whosoever in his dearest loves has prooved unfortunate,
whosoever cannot prosper in some other profession which he has been set to,
whomsoever some notable disgrace or other cross in estate has ber^aved of all
hope of ever rising in this world, whosoever by his miscariage has purchased
so many enemies, as that nothing but his blood can yield satisfaction to their
malice* All these, and many others reduced to like anguish of mind, and
distress, or otherwise howsoever out of taste with the world, have this haven
of content always open to fly to, when they can find no other place of repose
to stand in: then resolve they to go Friars (as they phrase it) yea whosoever
by his monstrous blasphemy or other like villainy has deserved all the tortures
and deaths in the world, if (before the hand of Justice lay hold upon him) he
voluntarily profess himself a Cap^^hine or Hermit, or of such like strict
order, the Pope forbids any further pursuit* as thinking his voluntary
perpetual penance sufficient. And in this manner is the greatest sort of their
gentry Capuchins, for so are the most of the order by birth. Neither is this
religious life (save in some very few Orders) so severed from the world and the
commodity thereof, but that it enjoys as many contentments as a moderate
mind need wish and moderate affections can find means also to satisfy them
selves at pleasure: In sum, they are rather discharged of the toil^s and
cares, than debarred of the comforts and solace of this life. Neither is there
almost so mean a Fria^ among them, that has not some hope to be Prior of his
covent, and then perhaps of that resort or province, and lastly, not impossible
that his good fortune may so accompany his merits, as to attain to be the
General of all his Order. And the Generals are as likely to be made Cardinals
as any men. And finally, sundry of them within the memory of man, have been
advanced from the preheminences of the Cardinals dignity, to the soveraigntie
of papal glory.

Hope is a sweet and firm conpanion of man, it is the last thing that leaves
him, and the highest things it promises him, it makes all toiles supportable,
all difficulties conquerable. Now the multitude of these Orders, and good
provision for them being so great an ease to all sorts of men in their private
estates, as they generally account it: It must needs be a great bond of their
affection unto the Papacy, under which they enjoy it, as by whom alone those
Orders are protected, and whom his adversaries do seek utterly to exterminate
and ruin. I shall speak little of the particular persons that enter into
those Orders who draw thereby their whole race the more to favor, that way
(which in so infinite a number of them must needs be of great moment.) Against
this might be objected with great reason, the inestimable damage which the
public do thereby receive, as in Italy for example, perhaps half of the land
in many places thereof, and generally a full third, besides their other vailes,
being appropriated to this sort of people, and other persons ecelesiasticall,
yea and of the people themselves, perhaps a quarter of a million at least in
that one Country, having withdrawn themselves thereby from all service of
Prince, or people, or Country, and confined themselves to their Cloisters
life, living only upon the honey, which the toyling Be does gather, with
perhaps an other quarter of a million of an other sect (I may err in both
numbers, but I aim as near the truth as by conjecture I can, proportioning
the places where I have not been with those where I have been) who have
abandoned themselves to another trade as idle, but more wicked, devouring with
men's goods, their bodies and souls at once, which may be the cause that that
country (though as populous as it can well bear, yet comes manifold ways
short of that strength which in former times it has had, either for defense of
it self, or offense of his neighbors; yet notwithstanding these are Theoremes
which few list to speculate. The whole world running mainely to things
sensible and present, and to that which profits them in their own
particular, though it brings with it a certain hurt and final ruin of the
public, without the safety where of to them that judge things rightly,
neither any particular estate can prosper, nor the most prosperous estate
continue long.

22 But the benefit which the Papacy does draw from these Friars consists
in this point, accommodating and yielding content. It stands in the multitude
of hearts, of tungues, and pens (dispersed in all countries, but united in his
service) of men of most fury, and furious zeal, who with incessant industry
and resolutenes incredible, give over no travel, leave no exploit so difficult
or desperate unattempted for the vphoulding of the Papacy, and advancing of
that religion. On which all their comfort and credit in this life, all their
hope of prerogative in the life to come depends, being of the other side
esteemed for the most lousy companions, the most unprofitable droanes, the
most devouring locusts, the most reprobate, ignoble, ignominious, and wicked
race, that ever the world was pestred with; in sum, more vile than the very
mire they tread on. There was never yet state so well plotted in this world, or
furnished with such store of instruments to employ in his service, as to be able
to practice and persuade with the multitude (otherwise than in their public
assemblies, or other meetings) the Papacy only excepted, who by reason of the
infiniteness of these religious people, all made out of other folks stuff,
and maintained at other folks charge, is able, and does deal in public and
private, as occasion requires with men, women, and children, of how mean
estate soever, instructing, exhorting, confirming, adiuring and kindling them
in such sort, as makes fittest for their dri^e: and for the end proposed,
though there is difference in force of operation, between private perswations,
and those public preachings, where the hear^rs, according to the use of man's
nature, neglect that in particular, which is commended to their regard in
common, though easy to conceive; yet they only can sufficiently perhaps
esteem who have seen a Friar, an abandon of the world, a man wholly rapt with
divine affections and ecstasies, his apparel denouncing all earthly vanities,
his countenance preaching severitie, penance, and discipline, breathing nothing
but sighs for the hatred of sin, his eyes lifted upwards, as fixed on his
loyes, his head bowed one the one side, with tenderness of love and humility,
extending his ready hands to lay hold on men^ souls* to snatch them out of the
fiery laws of that gaping black Dragon, and to place them in the path that
conducteth to Paradise. When such a man* I say, shall address himse^^e to a
woman (whose sex has been famous ever for devotion and credulousnesse) or to
any other vulgar person, of what sort soever, persuading and beseeching with
all plausible motions of reason, yea with sighe^ of fear, and tears of love,
instanting and importuning no other thing at their hands, then only this, to
be content to suffer God to save their souls, and to receive them unto
everlasting happiness, which they shall certainly attain by rancking
themselves with the heavenly armies of God, (that is) by joining themselves to
the Church of Christ, and his Vicar, And this again and again, are sundry
times teached and pursued with show of incredible care of their good, without
seeking other meede or commodity to himself, save only of being the
instrument of a souls salvation. Is it to be marvelled, if such a man be
received as an Angel of God, sent expressly for their salvations, to whom he
comes, though he prevail and possess them in such forcible sort, as that no
access remain for any contrary persuasion; that nothing so violent which
they will not attempt, nothing so dear, which they will not bestow for the
advancement of that Church, by which themselves hope finally to be so highly
exalted? And although all Friars (being of so diverse metal) are not able to
play their parts so naturally, and with such perfection as some that I have
seen, yet being trained up in the same school, they all hold one course: and
certainly by their dealing with men at single hand in private by particular
applied persuasions, (which though they use not continually* yet do they not
neglect it whenever ^ opportunity does require. They prevail as (experience
does daily show) exceedingly.

23 What now may I say of their readiness to undertake, Bloody executi^ns by
Friars and Priests.
and resolutenesse to execute? what act how dangerous and desperate soever,
that may tend to the advancement of their side and order. I need not seek
far back, nor far off for examples. The late Henry of France, slain
traitorously by a Iacobin, and this King wounded by a Scholar of the Jesuits,
the one for want of zeal only in their violent courses, the other as
misdoubted of sincerity in his conversion, may show what measure their
professed enemies were to attend, if they could have as open and ready access
unto them. Again, this King went in danger of his life, a long while sought by
a Cap^^chin, having undertaken it (as it was said) at the instigation of
certain Jesuits of Lorreine, to dispatch him, whose picture being brought to
Paris by the Marquise Du Pont, search was made for him, and at length he was
taken, and executed, together with another Iacobine for the same crime. And
what may it be thought these men would not do, being commanded by their
Generals, whom they have vowed to obey? And in the Popes necessary service,
and with his expressed desire, who are carried with so desperate rage and
fury against whatsoever impediments their bare conceits, without vvarrant of
higher authority present unto them, and is in violent attempts to be executed
by themselves: they are men resolved, and hardly, as having no posterity to be
oppressed by their ruin, (which of all other things does most contain men in
duty,) So in exciting the multitude of sedition or tumult in favor of their
cause, and of their Catholic religion, they are as sedulous and secret, using
opportunity of confession to practice the vulgar, with annexing such
conditions to the absolutions they give them, as the turn they intend to
serve, requires. A point very memorable, in weighing the manifold fruits
which at this day that Sacrament bears for the Papacy, as has been
discovered at Paris that certain Confessors, having taken a solemn promise
of their penitents, that they would live and die in the Catholic religion, yea
and die for it also, if need shall require, have enjoyed them thereupon, to
oppose by all means against the verefying of the Kings Edictes for the
Protestants. Soon after ensued a general rumor and terror of new massacres,
though upon no ground that I can learn. The multitude of friars


24 But amongst many other points to be regarded in these Friars, the very
multitude it self seems to me to be one, not of the least confederation, if
the Papacy being reduced to any terms of extremity, should resolve to put
them in arms for their final refuge and succor. The Franciscans alone in the
time of Sixtus Quintus, their fellow and Father, are said to have been found
by survey to be thirty thousand. the Capuchins, a late branch of them, do
vaunt to be eight thousand at this present. The Dominicans strive in competency
with the Franciscans in all things. The Jesuits being great statists, are
withal, exceeding rich, and many: but for the greediness of wealth, and rare
practices to get it, infamous in all places. The Garmelitanes and Augustines,
have their hives in every garden, and everywhere swarm. The other orders of
Friars and Monks, being exceeding many, complain not of paucity in their
several professions. In some other Countries they are sown, but Italy is
thick strowed with this kind of people, whose number perhaps in the whole, may
pass a million of men, of the which, one half at the least, either are, or
would grow to be of lusty able bodies not unfit to be soon employed in any
warlike service: if the Pope having played away the rest of his policies, were
brought to his last hand, to set up his rest upon those men, what should hinder
him from raising huge armies of them in all places? their course of life,
perhaps their vows and profession, whereof himself has the key to lock and
open at pleasure may breed unwillingness of mind, or backwardness of such
actions, which cannot be imagined to them that know their eagerness of spirit,
and consider withal, their standing with his estate, and falling with his
ruin. Then for their unaptness and vndisposition of body, their fasting,
watching, lving on the ground, enduring cold, exact keeping of orders and
obedience to their commanders, ought to make them fit to all military
discipline. Then for the difficulty of assembling them in such case together.
Here needs must I speak of the exactness of their order and government,
being such as needs not yield to any. I know to that purpose, each order
has his General residing at Rome, for the most part, to advise with the Pope,
and to receive his direction from him, which being men of great reputation and
power, are chosen though in show indifferently by all the Masters, that is,
Doctors of their order whatsoever: yet in election it is so finely and
cunningly contrived, that the voices of Italy are far predominant, even as in
the election of the Pope, the Italian Cardinals; so in their modern general
counsels, the Italian Bishops do far exceed all the rest of Christendom;
that so the safety of the papal sea, and the greatness of Rome, may rest
assured.

These Generals have under them their Provincials as Lieutenants in every
province or state in Christendom. The Provincials have under them the several
Priors of covents. And those their companies. A commandment dispatched away
from the General, passes roundly by the Provincials to the Priors with all
speed, being received by the inferiors, they address themselves to the
performance; yea though it command them a voyage to China or Peru, without
dispute or delay they readily set forward. To argue or debate on their
superiors Mandates, were presumption, proud curiosity to search their reasons;
to detract or disobey them, breach of vow, equal to sacrilege; So that as in
a well disciplined army, the General guiding, the Soldiers follow; he
commanding, they obey, without further delay or question: So those have no
other care than to perform with dexterity, what Mandate soever their General
in the plenitude of his authority shall address to them. This order, this
diligence, this secrecy, this obedience, in a people that may wander without
suspicion in all places, and find good relief and aid in their passage, will
answer the former objection. To add the good grace wherein they are generally
with the vulgar, the means which they have to provide all things necessary
with their repositories of Relics and silver Images, what with Church-place
and treasure, wherein some of them are exceedingly rich, and daily increase,
unless the world should with general consent bend against them, it may be (if
the times should enforce such employment) they should be able (being associated
with such friends as they should find) to make a very strong part in all
places for the Pope, especially considering that these forces should be then
raised out of their enemies countries, and so weaken them, as blood drawn out
of their own bodies. And that no man may deceive himself with that error:
That in these professors of peace, there is no humor of war, that minds wholly
possessed with sweet contemplations, can embrace no thought of bloody
resolutions: let him but a little dive into the late French troubles, he shall
find that the military companions of the leaguers, were oftentimes even
stuffed with Priests and Friars, tall men and resolute, he shall find that of
these people, there have served (what in field, what in garrison) at one time,
sufficient to have made a great army of themselves only. He shall find, that
at Orleance, a Capuchin being expressly sent to that purpose by his Prior, went
up and down the streets with a wooden cross, crying, come forth good
Christian, destroy the enemies of the Cross of thy Savior: and therewithal
put to the sword at sundry times, six score of the reformed religion, until
he left none remaining. Lastly, he may understand, that more lately in Paris,
some of them in their sermons have incited (not obscurely) to a new massacre,
complaining that the body of the Realm is sorely diseased, being surcharged
with corrupt humors, as not having been let blood this five and twenty
years, as it ought. To conclude, I conceive this force of Friars, to be so
great, (what in regard of their very multitude, what by reason of their deadly
rage against their opposites) that it would be hard for any state to bring in
the reformed religion, without discharging it first of this difficulty and
burden. In Germany the first reformers of religion in this age, were friars
themselves, who being men of great mark and reckoning amongst their own, drew
their Covents and other troops of their Order with them, and thereby set the
rest in such amazements, that the Pope grew into a general great jealousy of
them all, doubting their universal revolt from his obedience. In England they
were with great policy and practice dissolved, bofore any innovation in
religion was mentioned, whereas to have done both together, had been perhaps
impossible. But first clear preventing them of pretense of religion, and after
finding their religion clear stripped of that Patronage, they were more
quietly minded, and this more quietly reformed. In France this king upon that
outrage against his person, smoked the Jesuits out of his nest, in most parts
of his kingdom. If he had done the like to the Dominica^s, (a most potent and
flourishing order in Spain above all other) in revenge of the murder of Henry
the 3. his predecessor, or if he would or could do it now to them, and to the
Capuchins, (who at this day next to the Jesuits, are of greatest renown) in
punishment of their late practice, so fortnately discovered, and so chastise
the schools always, when he took their scholars in so enormeous falts, there
were great hope for the reformed religion in time to prevail, which is now
prejudiced and persecuted by these Friars, that hardly can it keep foot on the
ground it has. Thus much of the strength which these religious orders do yield
the Papacy.

25 To this may be added the like invention of spiritual Invention of
spiritual fraternities.
fraternities and companies, perhaps equaling, yea exceeding n number the very
orders of Friars: in which* under the protection, and in honor of some saint,
or of any other holy man or religious Minister, and oftentimes annexing
themselves to some of the orders of friars, the lay people of al sorts, both
men and women, both single and married, do inrole themselves into one or more of
these societies, approaching so much nearer to the state of the clergy, unto
which sundry of the^ are no other then annexaries and appurtena^ces, whereby, as
they tie themselves to the orders of them, cosisting in certain extraordinary
devotions and professio^s, bearing also certain times some badge of their
company: so are they made partakers of al such spiritual prerogatives, either
by partnership with other Churches merits, or intrest in sundry Indulgences,
some half plenary, some whole, some for the time past, some before hand for
sundry years to come, and chiefly for the avoiding or speedy dispatch out of
purgatory, as the Pope or his predecessors, for the encouragement and comfort
of the Christian people in their devotion and charity, have thought good to
grant unto them. These fraternities are not yet grown into any great request
in other ^ollicies of the pa ^acie against the opposites
places, howbeit in Italy they have so multiplied, that few (especially of
that vulgar and middle sort of men, who affect any reputation of devotion) but
have entered into some one of them, and sundry into many; the assurance of whom
unto Papacy, must needs be doubled, since love grows according to the
proportion of hope.

26 Now come I to the last rank of the Roman policies, aranged against their
professed and feared enemies, whereby they do seek to re-enter where they have
been disrooted and practice as well for the wasting away of their opposits
where they are, as for shutting them and their doctrine out, where yet they
have not been. I will not here exemplify upon things manifest and ordinary,
being high ways, so plain that a guide were needless; their persecutions,
confiscations, tortures, burnings, secret murders, general massacres,
exciting of inward seditions and outward hostility against their adversaries,
their oppressing and debasing of the^ where themselves are the stronger, are
things whereof they were none of the inventors, though perhaps the co^me^dation
of the exact refining of them, of straining the^ to their highest note, of
sedulitie and perseverance, putting the^ in execution, may be more due and
proper to them then to any other; neither yet will I meddle greatly with their
Art of slandering their opposites, o^ disgracing their persons, misreporting
their actions, falsifying their doctrine and positio^s, (things wherewith their
pulpits do daily sound and their writings swell again.) But they are not the
first, neither, that have run this black course, no more then the former red:
others have done it before them, ye the buying of men's consciences, by
proposing reward to such as shall relinquish the protestant religion and turn
to theirs, as in Ausbarie where they say there is a known price for it, of ten
florence a year. In France, where the Clergy have made co^tributions for the
maintenance of runnagate Ministers, is a devise also ^^esh and of easy
conceit. I will rather insist upon their inventions less trivial, and more
worthy to be regarded. A wonderful thing it is to consider the great
diversity of humors or tempers of mind, which this age has produced in this
one point we speak of, touching the means of growing onward upon the
adversary part. Puritaines
A sort of men there lives in the world at this day whose leaders (whether
upon extremity of hatred toward the Church of Rome, or upon selfe-liking and
singularity to value their own wits and devises) did cut out in such sort,
their reformation of religion, as not only in all outward religious services
and ceremonies, in government, and Church discipline, they do strive to be as
unlike the Papacy as is possible: but even in very lawful policies, for the
advancing of their part, do disdain to seem to be imitators to them, whom
they so much abhorred, much like stowt ^arted, selfe-witted Captain, who
scorns to imitate any stratageme before used by the enemy, though the putting
of it in exploit, might give him assured victory: Neither do these men's
Protestants
scholars, as yet one whit degenerate, yea perhaps that disease (if I may so
censure it) has tainted, in some degree, all the protestant party, who never
could find the means in all this age, to assemble a general Counsel of all
their side for the composing of their differences, and setting order in their
proceedings, for want I must confess of some oportunities, but of a great
deal of zeal also in their governors, (as to me it seems:) neither yet
have they in any one of all their Dominions, erected any college of more
contemplative persons, to confront and oppose against the Jesuits, but have
left this weighty burden of clering the controversies, of perfecting the
sciences, of answering the adversaries writings, (of exceeding huge travel)
either upon their ordinary Ministers to be performed at times of leisure from
their office of preaching, (and then is it done accordingly) or upon such as in
Universities, having some larger scope, shall willingly and of their own
accord undertake it for sometimes: whereas on the contrary side, the Papacy
seems to me, very diligently and attentively to have considered and weyed, by
what means chiefly their adverse part has grown so fast, beyond either their
own expectation, or the fear of their enemies, as in less then an age to
have won perhaps the moity of their Empire from them. And those very means,
themselves have resolved hence-forwards to appy, in strong practice on their
side also, that so, as by a countermine, they may either blow up the minds of
their adversaries, or at leastwise give them a stop from any further
proceeding, like a politic General, who holds it the greatest wisdom to
out-goe his enemies in their own devices, and the greatest valor to beat him
at his own weapons. I will not here presume to press in with my determination
upon this great difference and question, although it seem to me, to be no
other then a plain quarrel, between stomach, and discretion: A small deal
of wisdom, me think, might decide it, especially considering that all good
things are from God, though they be found in his very enemy: and whatsoever is
not unjust (being used in a good cause) is good.

27 The first and chief means, whereby the reformers of Religion prevail in
all places, was their singular assiduitie Preaching.
and dexterity in preaching, especially in great cities, and Palaces of
Princes, whereby the people (being ravished with the love and admiration of
that light which so brightly shined unto the^, as me^ with the Sun, who are
newly drawn Publishing treatises of piety.
from dungeon) readily followed those who carried so fair a lamp before them.
Hereto may be added their publishing of treatises of virtue, of piety, of
spiritual exercises and devotions, which engendered a firm persuasion in the
minds of men; that the soil must be sound, and good, from whence so sweet,
wholesome, and heavenly fruits proceed. Now although the opinions of the
Papacy, and of a great part of the reformed religion be as opposite herein,
wel-nie as hot and cold, as light and darkness; the one approving no devotion
severed from understanding, the other thinking the understanding to be a means,
rather to divert and dazzle the devotion, then to direct and cherish it. And for
preaching in like sort, the French Protestants making it an essential and
chief part of the service of God, whereas the Romanists make the Mass only a
work of duty, and the going to Sermons but a matter of convenience, and such
as is left free to men's leasures and oportunities, without imputation of sin:
yet in regard of the great sway (which they have learned by their loss) that
those carry, in drawing of men's minds and affections, they have indevoured in
all places in both those kinds, to equal, yea and to surmount their
adversaries. For although in multitud of preachers they greatly come short,
(being an exercise wherein the secular priests list not to distemper their
brains much, but commend it in a manner wholly to their regulars and friars) and
these (thinking the country capacities to blockish, or otherwise not worth
bestow ing so great cost on (do employ themselves wholly in cities and other
places of great resort, all which they have great care to have co^petently
furnished: yet in the choice of them whom they send out to preach, in the
diligence and pains which they take in their Sermons, in the ornaments of
eloquence and grace of action, in their show of piety and revere^ce toward
God, of zeal toward the truth, of love toward his people, which even with
their tears they can often testify, they match their adversaries in the best,
and in the rest far exceed them. But herein the Jesuits carry the bell from all
other, having attained the co^mendations. and working the effect of perfect
orators: And of those besides, certain drawn yearly by lot from their general
residing at Rome: their choice preachers are sent abroad amongst Infidels and
heretics; at Lent in especial they are sent out, one in each city in Italy with
yearly charge, and the custom of Italy is for the same man to preach every day
in the lent without intermission (if their strength do serve them) so as six
days in the week to preach on the Gospel of the days, and on the S^terday in
honor and praise of our Lady: so in every yearly change there is the delight
of variety, and in the daily continuing of the same, the admiration of
industry. Some such like course it is to be thought, that the Jesuits hold
also in other Countries, their proiects being certain and exactly pursued. But
wonderful is the reputation which redounds thereby to their order, and
exceeding the advantage which it gives to their side, for books of prayer and
piety, all countries are full of them at this day, in their own language, to
stopp in part, the out-crie of their adversaries against them, for imprisoning
the people wholly in those dark devotions, and especially to win the love of
the world unto them, by this more inward and lively show of sanctity and
godliness. Yea, herein they conceive to have so far surpassed their opposites,
that they forbear not to reproach unto the^ their poverty, weakness, and
coldness, in that kind, as being forced to take the catholics books to supply
theirs, which as in this it cannot altogether be denied to be true, so on the
other side, it had bin greatly to be wished, that these books of Christian
Resolution and exercise, had bin the fruits of conscience, rather then of the
wits of those that made them, which in some of them, as father Parso^s by name,
have bin otherwise, besides the rest of his actions unsuitable to those
resolutions. Some of them also more zealous in their way have not forborne to
confess, that by performing so good works with a good mind, to a good end, and
conforming their own lives and demeanors acordingly, they might have prepared
men's minds to an hope of a through reco^cilatio^ whereas now, by using holiness
it self for a mere instrument of practice* and to win men to their party, they
cannot but drive the world into such a laborinth of perplexities ielousies, as
to suspect always their policies and despair of their honesties.

28 A second thing whereby the Protestant part has so greatly enlarged it
self, has been, their well educating of youth, specially in the principles of
Christian Religion and piety, wherein their care and continuance, is even at
this day in many places very worthily to be commended of all, and imitated by
them, who hitherto have bin more remiss in educatio^ of youth, and sowing in
those pure minds, seed of virtue and truth, before the weeds of the world do
ra^cor and change the soil, being by the consent of the most renowned wise men
of the world, a point of incomparable force and moment, for the well ordering
and governing of all kind of states, and for the making of Commonweals ever
happy and flourishing for all education confor ming to the laws and customs
in being, does uphold states in the terms wherein they are. The first
seasoning with opinions and accustoma^ces whatsoever; being of double force to
any second perswations and vsages: not comprising herein those nimble and
quick-silvered brains which itch after change, liking in their opinions, as in
their garments, to be noted to be followers of outlandish fashions, as being of
a more refined and sublimated temper, then that their Country conceits can
satisfy. Here in then the Papacy were taken short by the protestants (even as
in the for mer) and mightily overonne e^e they were aware thereof:
notwithwa^ding, as difficulties do rather kindle then dau^t the generous
spirits, and add that to their diligence, which was wa^tting in their
timelines, so these men have bestirred themselves so well therein, to follow
the trace which their adversaries had led them, that in fine they have in some
sort out-gone them in it, and quoted them in all, one only excepted, that they
respect not much instruction of their children of the meaner sort as being
likely to sway little, whereas the Protestants seem in religious instruction
indifferent to both. But for the rest, what is it they have omitted, what
Colleges for their own, what Seminaries for strangers, to support and
perpetuate their factions and practices in their e^emies dominions have they
not instituted almost in all parts in Christendom, and maintain still at
their own and their favorites charge? Is it a small brag that some of their
side do make, that their English Seminaries abroad send forth more Priests,
than our two Universities at home do Ministers? Behold all the Jesuits the
great Clearks, Politicians, and Orators of the world, who vaunt that the Church
is the soul of the world, the Clergy of the Church, and they of the
Clergy, do stoop also to this burden, and require it to be charged wholly
upon their shoulders, in all places wheresoever they can plant their neasts,
their open free schools for all studies of humanity. To these flock the best
wits, and principal men's sons in so great abundance, that wheresoever they
settle, other Colleges become desolate, or frequented only by the baser sort,
or those of the heavier metal. And in truth such is their diligence and
dexterity in instructing, that even the Protestants themselves (in some
places) send their sons to their Schools, upon desire to have them prove
excellent in those Arts they teach* besides, being in truth but a bait and
allurement where^vnto to fasten their final and principal hook, they plant
in their Scholars with great exactness and skill the roots of their Religion,
nourish them with an extreme hatred and detestation of the adverse party. And
to make them for ever intractable to any contrary persuasion, they work into
them by great cunning an obstinacy of mind, and sturdie eagrenesse of spirit,
to affect victory with all violence of wit in all controversies, than which no
greater enemy to the finding out of truth which (being pure and single in his
own nature) appears not but to a clear and sincere understanding whom
neither the fumes of fiery passion do mist, nor sinister respects or
preiudices sway down on either side, from the pitch of just integrity,
neither think I any unfitter sort of men in the world to be employed in the
contemplation and search of truth, than these hot men and headie, who being
sudden in their actions, seize lightly on that which comes first to hand,
and being stiff in their resolution, are (...)sported with every preiudicate
conceit, from one error (...) another, having neither the patience they should,
to weigh all points diligently, nor the humility to yield up their own fancies
to reason; neither yet that high honorable wisdom as to know, that truth
being the mark they profess to strive at, in the overthrow of their errors,
they attain the sum of their desires, and remain conquerors, by being
conquered: yea sundry times have I seen two eagre disputers loose the truth,
and let it fall to the ground between them, which a calm minded hearer has
taken up and possessed.

But these Jesuits (presuming perhaps of the truth before hand, and laboring
no other thing than the advancing of the party) endeavor (as I said) by all
means, to imbrede that fierceness and obstinacy in their Scholars, as to
make them ho^^ prosecuters of their own opinions impatient and intractable of
any contrary considerations, as having their eyes fixed upon nothing, but only
victory in arguing, for which cause (to strengthen in them those passions by
exercise) I have seen them in their bare Grammatical Disputations, inflame
their Scholars with such earnestness and fierceness, as to seem to be at
the point of flying each into others face, to the amazement of those strangers
which had never seen the like before, but to their own great content and
glory as appeared. Over and above all this, they have instituted in their
schools a special fraternity, a congregation of our Lady, with certain
select exercises and devotions, into which (it being a reputation to be
admitted) it must cause (in congruitie) the forwardest of their scholars, to
fashion themselves by all means as to content their humors, and so to be
received (in show) into a degree of more honorable estimation (but in truth)
into no other than a double bond of assurance.

I shall not need to insert here their singular diligence, and cunning, in
enticing ((...)) the most noble of their Scholars, oftentimes the most adorned
with the graces of nature and industry (especially if they have any likelihoode
of wealthy succession)* to abandon their frindes and to profess their Order (a
thing daily practiced in ^ll places by them) yea wheresoever they epsy any one
of rare spirit, they will be tempering with him, though he be the only son
and solace of his father, whereby (though they draw on them much clamor and
stomach, yet do they greatly thereby enhaunce the renown of their soci^ty, by
furnishing it with so many persons of excellent quality or nobility, whom
afterward they employ with great judgment, as they find them fittest.
Neither yet do they here make an end with this part, but this Order has also
their solemn cha^echising in their Churches on Sondaies and Holidaies, for all
youth that will come, or can be drawn unto it, that in no point the diligence
of their adversaries may vpbraide them: But this point of their Schools in
instructing youth, is thought of such moment by men of wisdom and judgment
(being taught so by very experience and trial thereof) that the planting of a
good College of Jesuits in any place, is esteemed the only sure way to
replant that religion, and in time to eat out the contrary. This course hold
they in all Germany, in Savoy, and in other places, and the excluding it from
France is infinitely disliked; and that which makes them uncertain what will
become of that kingdom.

29 A third course that much advantageth the Protestants Offers of disputation.
proceeding, was their offers of disputations with their adversaries in all
places, their i^erated and importunate suites for public audience and
judgment, a thing which greatly assured the multitude of their soundness whom
they saw so confident in abiding the hazard of trial being that, whereof the
want is the only prejudice of truth, and the plenty, the only discovery and
ruin of falshoode: they standing in like terms, as a substantial just man,
and a facing shifter, where^of the ones credit is greatest there, where he is
best known, and the other where he is least, And by reason the Romanists were
not so cunning then in the questions, nor so ready in their evasions and
distinctions, as they are now grown, the effect of these disputations (whether
received or refused) was in most places such as to draw with them an immediate
alteration of religion. Hereto may be added those admirable pains, which those
first reformers undertook and performed, in translating the Scriptures
forthwith into all languages, in illustrating all parts thereof with ample
Comments; in addressing Institutions of Christian religion; in deducing large
histories of the Church, from the foundation to their present times; in
furnishing all common places of divinity with abundance of matter; in exact
discussing of all controversed questions: and lastly, in speedy reply to all
contrary writings, the greatest part of these labors tending to the
justifying of their own doctrine, and to the discovery of the corruption and
rottennes of the other, that they might overbeare these with the streams of
the evidence of Reason, by the strength of whose power they complained, to be
overborne. There is scarce any one of these kinds of writings, (save the
translating of the Bible into vulgar language) wherein the Romanists have not
already, or are not like very shortly, either to equal, or to exceed their
adversaries in multitude of works, as being more of them that apply those
studies in diligence, as having much more opportunity and leisure in exactness,
as coming after them and reaping the fruits of their travels, though in truth
they come short, and in ingeniositie, being Truths companion: But as for the
controversies themselves, the maine matter of all other therein, their industry
is at this day incomparable, having so altered the tenures of them, refined the
states, subtilized the distinctions, sharpened their own proofs, devi^ed
certain, either answers or evasions already resolved on, for all their
adversaries arguments, allegations, and replies; yea they have differences to
divert their strongest oppositions, interpretations to elude the plainest text
in the world; circumstances and considerations, to enforce their own seeliest
conjectures; yea reasons to put life into their deadest absurdities: as in
particular a very fair case in schoole-learning they have, to justify their
Popes grants of many score thousand years pardon, that in affiance of this
furniture, and of their promptness of speech and wit (which by continual
exercise they aspire to perfect) they dare enter into combat even with the
best of their oppugners, and will not doubt, either to entangle them so in the
snares of their own quirks, or at leastwise so put off his blows, with the
wards of their distinctions, that an ordinary Auditor shall never perceive
them to be vanquished, and a favorable Auditorie shall report them
vanquishers. Whereupon now to be quitte with their adveisaries, and by the
very same Art to draw away the multitude, they cry mainely in all places for
trial by disputations. This Campion did many years since with us. This, as I
passed through Turricke did the Cardinal Andrea of Constance, and his Jesuits
with their Ministers, being by ancient right within his Dioces* not long
before, the same was done to them of Geneva. And very lately the Capuchins
renewed the cha^enge, in which parts I observe this discreet valor on both
sides* that as the Romanists offer to dispute in the adversa^ies own Cities,
which they know their Magistrates will never accord; so the Ministers in
supply thereof, offer to go to them to their Cities, and that is now as much
disliked on the other side, each part being contented that the fire should be
kindled rather in his enemies house then in his own: yea there are not wanting
some ^^^peters amongst them, that have been talking a long while (whether out
of their own dreams, or out of the desires of greater persons, which I half
conjecture) of a general solemn conference to be sought and procured, of the
choice and chief every way of both the sides, under pretense of drawing
matters to some tolerable composition: But in truth (as I conceived) rather to
over-beare and disgrace the contrary cause, with their variety of engines, and
strength of wit to we^ld them at all af^aies at pleasure, than upon sincerity
of affection, or probability of any unity or peace to ensue; so great is
their hope of having cure by the weapons, from whence heretofore they have had
their wounds.

30 A fourth way that mightily afflictes the Papacy, and consequently
advaunceth the reformation and her proceedings, was a course, in my opinion,
surely more excusable, A discovering ^he blots of their opposites.
where it cannot, that commendable where it can be spared: and that is the
discovery of the private blo^es of an enemy further then the question in hand
does constrain, howsoever the Protestants (at leastwise some of them) by
example of those ancient and reverent Orators ripped up to the quick, the
lives of their adversaries in their particular actions, especially of their
Popes, and of their Prelates, as also of their Votaries of all sorts, and
sexes, wherein the store of matter was huge, the quality of it so enormous,
loathsome, ugly, and matchable in all kind of villainy, to the veriest monsters
of the Heathen, the persons defiled with it, of so imminent place in the
steering and upholding of their Church; and lastly the truth thereof, so
undoubted and certain, being drawn in times past out of their own stories
and Authors printed and approved amongst themselves to be true, for that
present, being, of things done ordinarily for the most part, and openly in the
sight of all men in Rome, and in Italy, (even as they continue perhaps not
much better in many things at this day,) that publishing and presenting it to
the prepared minds of the world, besides an extreme horror and detestation
which it brought, did work in them this persuasion also, that it could not be
but Hell gates had prevailed against that Sea, whose Governors, whose
Prelates, whose Priests, whose Virgins, had lived most of them so long time
in the ^awes of the Prince of Hell: Neither that it was probable they had been
careful in preserving the doctrine of Christianity, who had been careless
of all parts of Christian life and honesty. And as in their lives, so in
their writings also, of doctrine and devotion, and in the actions concerning
them; their deifying of the Pope with most impious flattery; their abusing of
the Scriptures, with all irreverence and profaneness; their iugling with
their Images, to make them sweat, weep, and bleed, to ra^e in the people a
devotion toward them of Heathenish Idolatry, their forging of Miracles, in
exorcismes, in cures, in apparition of souls for their lucre and advauntage,
their granting of Pardons for some prayers before Images, for many thousand
years, their Pardon for sins to come, before they be committed; their
shameless ridiculous tales of our Savior, and the holy and blessed Saints,
making marriages here upon earth, between him and some of our women Saints,
with infinite store of childish vanity and sott^sh absurdity, (as to their
adversaries) though themselves seemed (I must confess) to conceive otherwise
of them, some of their graver Doctors both preaching them in Pulpit, and
publishing them new^ly in elaborate and ample Histories; their promising to the
use of certain devotions to our Lady, to have a sight of her sometime before
their dying days, and much more, their falsifying and forgeries in all matters
of antiquities, thrusting in, cutting out, suppressing truth, suborning fained
writings, as their turns did require; all which, though being objected in
this sort to themselves, they had either their allegations of good intent, to
defend, or at leastwise the commiseration of humane infirmity to excuse them,
yet were they not so washed away from the minds of the people, who could not
conceive this house to have been guided by the Spirit of God, wherein they saw
so many foul spirits of pride, and hypocrisy, of lying and deceiving, to have
borne so great office so long, and without controlement. These things being
perceived by the favorites of the Papacy, to have made so deep impression in
the minds of all men, and to have greatly prejudiced them in their more
plausible allegations, men's hearts being already taken up and fraught with
detesting them, they cast about for revenge and redress in the same kind, not
as the plain blunt Protestant; who finding all the matters made ready to his
hands, bestowed no other cost, but the collecting and setting it in some order
together; but like a supernatural Artisan, who in the sublimitie of his
refined wit, disdaines to bring only mere Art to his work, unless he make
also in some sort the very matter it self. So these men in blacking the lives
and actions of the reformers, have partly devised matter of so notorious
untruth, that in the better sort of their own Authors it happens to be
checked: partly suborned other Post men to write their Legends, that afterward
they might cite them as approoved Authors, and Histories, as is evident in the
lives of Calvine, and Beza, written by their sworn enemy Botsacke, the twice
banished and thrice runnagate Friar, and Physician, for those names his often
chaunges, and hard chances have given him. This man being requested by their
side to write thus, is in all their writings alleged as Canonical. But in
this kind, surely methinks the conditions of those parties are too unequal,
for the Protestant whatsoever he has either in impeaching his adversary, or
clearing his own actions, unless he can directly prove out of the
adversaries own writings, it is with them as nothing, and nobetter than as are
testes domestici in the law, whereas the Romanist whatsoever he slanderously
surmiseth, unless the other party be able, by direct proof to disproove it,
(which being to justify in the negative, is always very difficult, and for
the most part impossible) he triumphs as in a matter of truth* not to be
gainsaid. And whosoever makes this account, that in these kind of blows,
even where the wound is cured, the scarre lightly contieth. At this present
they give it out, that they have a book in hand of the lives of the Ministers
of England; wherein it were to be wished, that some, who by their dissolutenes
and corruption, have given occasion of offense against the order it self,
might by their exemplarie punishment with all expiate the reproach, though at
these men's hands who in disgrace of our Prelates, have cited Marprelate in
their late books for a great Author and witness, and others of like and less
indifferency and honesty: the innocent and culpable are to expect perhaps like
measure. Then for the measure and doctrine of the Protestants, the books of
some of our own Countrymen, besides many other, are famous, who have taken a
toil (how meritorious God knows) surely very laborious, out of infinite huge
Volumes which that part has written, to pick out whatsoever (especially
severed from the rest) may seem to be either absurdlly, or falsely, or ^ondly,
or scandalously, or dishonestly, or passionately, or ^luttishly, conceived or
written: for even in that kind, having the advantage of the homely phrase of
our country, and namely in those times they have not spared, and these with
their crossenesse; and contradictions one of another s^t cunningly together,
they present to the view of the world, and demand whether it be likely that
these men should have bin chosen extraordinarily by God, to be the reformers of
the church, and treasurers of his truth, who besides their virious lives, and
hateful conditions; in their more sober thoughts, and very doctrine it self,
were possessed with so fantastical, so wild, so contrary, so furious, so
maledicent, and so slovenly spirits, wherein, as they do in some sort immitate
their adversaries, so yet with this difference, that the one has objected that
which either (as being the approoved doctrine of their church) was with such
public authority delivered to the people, or else, which was so usual amongst
their Canonists and Clergy, as might plead uncontrolled custom to show it
lawful, whereas the other part finding very small store of that nature, have
run for supply to every particular man's writings, wherein so huge a multitude
of authors and works as this age over-rancke therein, and men's fingers ever
itching have produced, it had been surely a great miracle, if they had not
found matter enough, either worthy to be blamed, or easy to be deprav^d in
their enemies writings: One of the most renowned Sages and Fathers of the
Ancients having found so much to condemn and retract in his own. And if the
Protestants should list to requite them in that kind, they might perhaps find
stuff enough (I will not say to lade an Argosy) but to overlade any man's wit
in the world to reply unto. But verily these courses are base and beggarly even
when singleness of mind and truth does concur with them: and far unworthy
of an ingenious and noble spirit, which soareth up to the highest and purest
paths of verity, disdaining to stand raking in these puddles of obscurity,
unworthy of that charitable and virtuous mind which striveth by doing good to
all, to attain to the high honor of being an immitator of God, who is sorry
of those very faults, which are in his enemies, and discloses them no further
than is necessary, either for defense of impugned truth, or for warning to the
world to avoid the contagion of the disease, or seducements by the deceased.
But if to this baseness of discoveries other injustice be also added, if malice
do prefer them, if slight increase them, if falsehood and slaughter ^aint
them* then do they not only abuse men from the dignity of their nature, but
even associate them with the foul enemy and calumniator thereof, whose name is
the slanderous accuser of his brethren. I suppose there was never man so
patient in the world (that pattern of all perfection, our Savior Christ
excepted) but if a man should heap together all the choleric speeches, all the
wayward actions that ever escaped from him in his life, and present them in one
veiw all continuate together (as is the fashion of some men) it would represent
him for a furious and raving bedlem, whom displaying al his life in the same
tenor it was led, the whole world might well count of his stayednesse, and
admire him for his moderation and magnanimity. They that observe nothing in
wisemen of virtue, but their fault* and imperfections (from which neither the
wisest nor perfectest have been free,) what do they but propose them as
matter of scorn, and abhorring whom God has as it were marked out for
patterns of honor to immitate? Yea this age has brought out those cursed and
these accursed wits, who by culling out the errors and shows of error, by
formalizing the contrarieties, misinterpreating the ambiguities, intangling the
obscurities, which in the most renowned Authors for humane wisdom that were
ever in the world, their envious and maliciously fine brains could search
(immitating him therein, who by his Labors of the very same nature, though
with less and no ground at all against the sacred Bible, purchased the
infamous name of the enemy of Christianity) have done that hurt unto the
studies of learning, which nothing but the utter extinguishing of their
unlearned works can expiate.

31 The last means I will hear speak of, were used in setting forward this
reformation of religion, was the deligent compiling the histories of those
times and actions, and especially the Martyrologie of such as rendered by their
deaths, a testimony of that truth which was persecuted in them: These
memories and stories presenting generally to the world, the singleness and
innocence on the one part, the integrity of their lives, the simplicity of
their devises, the zeal of their desires, their constancy in temptations,
their tolleration in torments, their magnanimity, and celestially inspired
courage and comfort in their very agonies and death, yielding their bodies with
all patience to the furious flames, and their souls with joy to the hands of
him that made them. On the other side, representing a serpentine generation
wholly, made of fraud, policies, and practices, men lovers of the world, and
haters of truth and godliness, fighters against the light, protectors of
darkness, persecuters of marriage, and patrons of brothelles, abnegators and
dispencers against the laws of God, but tyrannous importunators, and exactors
of their own: men false in their promises, treacherous in their pretenses,
barbarous in their executions, breathing nothing but cruelty fire and sword
against me^ that never offended them, save in their desire to amend them, which
they could not endure (and much of this, set out in sundry places with
pictures, to imprint thereby a more lively sense of commiseration of the one
part, and detestation of the other) bred in men's minds a strong conceit, that
on the one side Truth and Innocence was persecuted, on the other violence and
deceit persecuting, that the one part, contrary to al humane probability,
being nourished with the only dew of divine benediction, flourisht in the
flames, and as camamile, spread abroad, being troad under feet, the other,
notwithstanding al humane and infernal devises, yet cursed from above, faded,
not unlike to come to ruin. The Papacy being netled extremely with these
proceedings, has resolved to give over the kindling any more of those
unfortunate fires (save in some secure places, to maintain the usage of that
law) the ashes of which they have perceived to have been the seed of their
adversaries, but rather by secret making men away in their Inquisitions* and by
general massacres to extinguish them. Then to affront them in the same kind of
Martyro^ogies and Histories they have first caused stories to be written also
in their favor. making in them a representation of authority, and justice
proceeding by pollitick execution of Law, in the necessary defense of God
Church, and of all Catholic States and Princes, against a company of base
rebels, of vow-breaking-Friars, of Church-robbing politicians, and
Church-raizng soldiers, of infected, and infecting, both Schismatiques and
heretics, innovators of orders, underminers of government, troublers of
states, over-turners of Christendom; against whom, if they have not yet
sufficiently prevailed, it is to be attributed only to the force of popular
fury, and not to any strength and goodness of their cause, much less to any
celestial and divine protection. Next for Martirologies, they have England for
their field to triumph in, the proceedings wherein against their late Papists
and accomplices, they aggravate to the height of Neroes and Dioclesians
persecutions, and the sufferers of their side, both in merits of cause, in
extreamitie of torments, and in constancy and patience to the renowned Martyrs
of that Heroical Church age, whereof (besides sundry other books) they have
published a great volume lately to the world in Italian, compiled with great
industry, approved by authority; yea some of their books also with pictures
illustrated: in sum, wanting nothing save only truth and sincerity. An
easy thing it is without growing to the extreme impudency of palpable lying,
by leaving out the bad on the one side, and the good on the other, by enforcing
and flourishing all circumstances and accidents which are in our favor and by
elevating and disgracing of all the contrary, by sprinkeling the terms of
honor wholly on the one part, and of hatred and ignomie on the other, to make
their tale turn which way shall please the teller. But writers of histories
should know, that there is a difference between their profession and the
practice of advocates, pleading contrary at the bar, where the wisdom of
the Judge, pickes the truth out of both sides, which is entire perhaps in
neither.

32 And verily in this kind, both the Protestants and Papists seem generally
in the greatest part of their stories, to be both too blame, though both not
equally, having by their passionate reports much wronged the truth, abused this
present age, and prejudiced posterity: insomuch, that the only remedy now
seeming to remain, is to read indifferently the stories on both parts, to
count them as advocates and to play the Judge between them. But partiallity
seems to be the chief fault of the Protestant, love and dislike sometimes
dazeling his eyes, drawing him from an Historiographers into an Orators
profession, though some of them have carried themselves therein with commendable
sincerity, even as some also of the other part have discharged themselves
nobly. But surely the Priests and Friars which have written in that kind, have
strangely behaved themselves, and disclosed how small reckoning they make of
truth in any thing, their devising, their forging, their facing, their peecing,
their adding, their paring, having brought, not only their modesty, but their
wits also in question, whether they forget not what it was they undertook to
write, a work of story, or of poetry rather, which Arts though like yet
(ought they to know) are different. And for these Martyrologies, to speak of
England as they do, (let the truth of Religion be indifferent on whether
side) unless difference be made between men, who suffer for their consciences
only, their very adversaries having no other crime to object against them, and
those who either in their own particular persons, or at least wise in their
directors, whom they have chosen to follow, and vowed to obey, are convinced to
have attempted against the Prince and state, and to have practiced the
alteration and ruin of both. If no difference be to be made between these men's
sufferings, let all things be a like, let the persecuting of the sheep and the
hunting of wolves be one. But enough, and too much perhaps of these comparisons
and imitations.

33 I will join only heereto their policy of news, Inventing of false
n^we^,
for some kind of resemblance it has with the former. It could not (I must
confess) settle in my conceit of a long time, that men of their wisdom, so
well furnished with better means, should descend to that base and vain devise
of inventing and spreading false news in their favor, being an odious kind
of abusing the world; and such also as in the end, being choked with the
truth, redoundes to the deep disgrace and discredit of the Authors, being
accounted no other then the trick of a bankerupt. Howbeit, finding by
experience that this is frequent amongst them in other places: at Rome above
all other, it was almost their ordinary practice; from whence, during the time
of my abode in Italy (besides other less memorabl) there came first solemn
news that the Patriarchs of Alexandria with all the great Church of Africa had
by their Ambassadors submitted and reconciled themselves to the Pope, and
received from his holiness absolution and benediction, there being no such
matter as I learned afterward of a great Bishop, who has particular
acquaintance and intelligence with that Patriarch. Another time that the King
of Scots amongst many acts worthy a Christian Prince, had chased away the
Ministers, yea and executed two of them, consiscating their goods, and
bestowing them upon the Catholics, which news was soon after recalled from
the same place. Not long after that, Beza the Arch-heretick, and Calvines
successor, drawing toward his death, had in full Senate at Geneva, recanted
his religion, exhorting them, that if they had care to save their sovles, to
seek reconciliation with the Catholic Church, and to send for the Jesuits to
instruct them. Whereupon, both himself by special commission from the Pope,
was absolved by the Bishop of Geneua ere he died, and the City had sent an
embassage of submission: the beginning of which news it was my chance to
hear, as being whispered among the Jesuits two months before it brake out.
But when once it was advertised so solemnly from Rome, it ran over all
Christendom, and in Italy was so verily believed to be true, that their were,
as is said, who rode on very purpose to see those Ambassadors of Geneva, yet
invisible. And to make up the full measure of that worthy policy, being
afterward at Lions and understanding that the Post of Rome, who then passed
by for Spain, gave confidently out, that he left the Queen of Englands
Ambassadors at Rome, making great instance for agreement and amity with his
holiness, and to have her recatholised and absolved, news, as to me the^
seemed cut out purposely for Spain, and to comfort their favorers and affected
adherents: finding also by the observation and judgment of some wise men, that
the Jesuits are the Masters of that mint, and that all the coins are of
their stamp, yea, and that the glorious news of the miraculous proceedings of
the Fathers of their society in converting the Indies, are not thought much
truer. And lastly, perceiving that the doctrine of all that fide in the cases
of conscience, making it lawful for them to equivocate with their adversaries
in their answers, though give upon their ^athes, whenever their lives or
liberties are touched; yet the Jesuits are noted by some of their own friends
to be too hardy equivocator^, and their equivocations too hard, whereof they
give this example of a Jesuit, who instructed, a maid servant in England, That
if she were examined whether she knew of any Priests resorting to her masters
house, she should swear (if she were put to it) that she knew not of any,
which she might do lawfully with this secret intent, that she knew not of
any, (viz. with purpose to disclose them.) Though others defend this as a point
of allowable wisdom, all these things considered, it has made me to mitigate
my former imagination, and to deem it not impossible, that this over politic
and too wise order, may reach a note higher then our gross conceits, who
think Honesty the best policy, and Truth the only durable armor of proof,
and may find by their refined observations of experience, that news make their
impression upon their first reporting, that then if they be good, they greatly
raise up the spirit, and confirm the mind, especially of the vulgar sort, who
easily believe all that their betters tell them: and afterward when they hap
to be controlled, men's spirits being cold, or not so sensible as before, they
either little regard it, or impute it to common errors and uncertainty of
things, yea and that the good news comes to many men's ears, who never heard
of the check it has, and at leastwise it may serve their turn for some
present exploit, as Merchants do with their news, (whether imitators or
imitated of these men, I know not) who finding some difficulty in
accommodating their affairs, have in use to forge letters, or otherwise raise
bruits, either of some good success in their Princes actions, (as our men they
say at Constantinople) or of some great alterations in some kind of
merchandise, (as certain not long since have done at Paris) which may serve
for that present instant to expediate their business; yet surely methinks
these learned fathers should consider that though lying be held for a
necessary fault in Merchants, (if any fault be necessary, which for my part I
hold not) yet it cannot be admitted for an allowable policy in Divines, being
the offspring of that arch-enemy, both of the Dietie and Divinity: and if a
dead fly do viciate a whole box of sweet ointment, so a little folly may
blemish greatly a very wise man, and some falsehood discredit the delivery of
much truth. Then verily I crave leave at their hands, of advancing them in the
rest of their supersuttle inventions, I arrange this amongst the poor
policies of the hospital of the desperate.

Now these being weapons wherewith they fight against their adversary, they
whet the^, by framing an utter breach or separation in all religious duties
between their party and their opposites, not only in such points as wherein
they descent, (which is the part of all men which list not to wound their own
consciences,) neither yet in all ecclesiastical duties alone, (which sundry
other Churches, ancient and modern, have done, and still do,) as thinkking
that the good things which heretics retain, are vitiated by those bad,
wherewith either their faithes or functions are stained, though perhaps there
be a dram more of zeal then charity, in the ingredience of that Canon, unless
the heresy be capital and directly opposite to the glory of God, or honor
of our Savior. But the Church of Rome at this day has strained that string,
as to stretch it out to all divine duties whatsoever, though not
Ecclesiastical, but performed by private persons, and in several, as occasion
serves; neither to such only as faith has revealed to us Christians, but even
those which the light of Nature has taught all men in the world; yea, Pagans
and Barbarians as yielding glory to God, imploring his aid and favor*
tendering him thanks for benefits, in none of which actions may they join with
the Protestants, being so commanded by the sovereign Lord of their Church. If
a Protestant begin to settle himself to pray, with that prayer which the
lips of our Savior has sanctified and taught, it is now so polluted by
passing through his lips, that a Roman Catholic may not stay in the room,
if he use that voice which all the creatures of God in their several
languages do daily sound forth and say; God be praised; or, Glory be to
the Highest. The Romanist alone is silent, and may not join his assent, if at
meat he yield thanks unto God for his blessings, be it but with Deo
gratias, (which was ever in Augustines mouth though this chaseth not a
Catholic from his dinner, (which were to his loss,) yet must he forbear his
Amen unto it.

On the contrary side, some Roman Catholics will not say grace, though be
at his own Table, when a Protestant is present, thinking it better to leave
GOD vnserved, then that a Protestant join in serving him, though the Custom
of giving GOD thanks at meals, is generally amongst these Catholics grown
clean out of use both in France and Italy, for ought I could see: as not
knowing that the Popes pardon is gained by the use of grace in cups. In
sum, they are more averse to join with a Protestant in doing honor to GOD,
then the very brute beasts, if beasts by proper speech could sound forth Gods
praise, as the legends of their Saints in their favor do fancy, wherein how
religiously they have proceeded for the amplifying and advauncing of Gods
service, that GOD does know: how politiquely for the strengthening of their
own part amongst their enemies, that the world may know by these few
considerations; First by this course that they keep their lay followers in a
perpetual dark ignorance of the Protestants faith and religion, having made
it an high degree of deadly sin, either to read their books, or to hear
their Sermons, or to be present at their Service, or any way to communicate
with them in religious duties whatsoever. Whereby, whatsoever their lay
multitude co^ceiveth of the reformed religion; or of the points of doctrine
which therein are taught, is that only which the enemies thereof do tell them,
who reports according to the disease of their own stomachs, and as I may
represent it, in most odious and hideous form to the hearers.

So that now no more mervaile (which experience does teach,) that seldom or
never a lay Catholic can be found, that conceives rightly of any (almost)
of the Protestants propositions, since seldom or never was Roman Priest yet to
be shown, that has not falsified and depraved them utterly in reporting them.
Whereas, if those lay Catholics should once open their cares to know the
Protestants opinions from themselves, that hold the^ (which was the use of the
old world in their ingeniovs simplicity and singleness of proceeding) they
would not be found, either so absurd perhaps, but that a reasonable, or so
wicked, but that a religious mind might embrace them.

Then secondly* by this means they do knit their own fact on more fast
together, and unite them more soundly to the head thereof the Pope, since no
service of God, but in his communion, and with him no conjunction without utter
separation and estranging from his enemies, whereas if his party should but
join with the Protestants in such service of GOD, as are allowed by both, this
concvrring with them in some actions, might abate that utter dislike which they
have of their whole way, yea and happily taking a liking of them in some
things, they might be drawn still by degrees to other; and finally, step
away or grow cold in their first affections. For factions, as by disparitie of
mind they are raised: so by strangeness they are continued and grown
mortal; whereas on the other side, they are slaked by intercourse, by parley
they are reconciled, by familiarity extingushed. A memorable example of the
virtue of this policy our own Country in these latter times has yielded,
wherein the first reformation under King Edward, the Pre^ates and Clergy
having before discarded the Pope, did easily join with the Protestants, though
not in their opinions, yet in the public service of God in the Churches, being
indifferently composed, and offensive to neither part. And but that the Pope
soon after upon extraordinary cause, was restored to his former authority by
Queen Mary, that faction had in likelihoode bin long since ended. But after
that the Pope was once again admitted, and had liberty to temper with his
party at pleasure, in the second reformation by her Majesty, not a Bishop of
his could be persuaded to come to our Churches but choosing rather loss of
living; and the greatest part also of Recusants, which have since been
continued by their followers to this day. Notwithstanding our service be less
offensive to them, then in King Edwards, and in no part opposite to any point
of their belief. But so it seemed good to their pollitique Governors, by this
utter breach and alienation, to preserve and perpetuate the remains of their
party, and that in the midst of their more potent adversaries, though armed
with Laws, quickened with suspicions, yea exasperated by their often dangerous
practices against them.

Now in that they proceed also a step further, and inhibite their party,
not only the reading of the Protestants books, and repair to their Churches,
but also joining with them in any service of God, in whomsoever, or in how
lawful sort soever performed, thereby do they engender in them an extreme
hatred, and bitter detestation of their opposites. For if the Protestants, by
reason of their enmity with the Pope, and swarving from his way, do stand in
te^rmes of so deep disfavour with God, that the prayer it self do turn into
sin; that their humble thanks givings are abominable presumptions; that to
join with them in praising the Creator of the world, is no better then treason
to his Majesty: then surely, woe worth the hour wherein they were borne, and
blessed be that hand that shall work their bane and ruin. Then no stay or
doubt, but what the Pope directes, that boldly to be executed against these
enemies of God: And this have they set up as a Crown, and accomplishment, to
the rest of their practices against their adversaries: for now is their
faction, not only kept on foot, and continually maintained without decay* but
enflamed also with such hatred of their enemies* that they are ready to any
violence, that opportunity shall devise. For as diversities of judgments do
grow unto dislikes, and dislikes by oppositions do issue into factions; so
hatred in factions does break out into seditions* and attend only advantage
to use force against these they hate: whereas on the contrary side the
Protestants (being not armed, nor quickened up with such stings of hatred as
his adversaries) is more cold and careless in his opposite desires, and
exceeding inferior in all strong attempts and practices. But certainly
howsoever in this crafty kind of policy, which has too much bewitched the
wits of this age, and does too much tyrannise over that ancient true
wisdom, wherewith the world in fore-times was more happily governed, these
courses may seem very fine and effectual for the atchieving of that end
whereto they are framed; yet hard (I suppose) now it would be to be shown,
how they can stand with the principles and rules of that Religion, whose rote
is Truth, whose branches are Charity, whose fruits are good deeds,
extending and ever offering themselves with cheerfulness unto all men, to the
encouraging of friends, and reclaiming of enemies, to the amending of the
worse, and the accomplishing of the better and noble minds, in the high
vertuousnesse thereof, does carry it self in all actions, with such
moderation, and measure, as that it neither hate his enemy so much in regard
of his wickedness, but loves that whatsoever in him has resemblance of
virtue; neither yet fear him, so much for his mischievous desires, as to rage
and grow fierce upon him in his weakness, but contenteth it self so
farre-forth only to repress him, as may dis-inable him thence forwards from
doing hurt unto others, how much more may it seem reasonable, that the
heavenly affections of a Christian rejoice for whatsoever goodness appears
in any man, as finding there some liniaments of his Creators Image, detest
nothing but impiety and wickedness the worlds dishonor.

And lastly, in the true and serious worshipping of God, do join when
occation offers, with whatsoever of his creatures in united affections, to
cheer up his service, where scandal (by show of approving that which is
evil in them) does not hinder: But the world in the besenesse of his metal,
now in the last and woo^st, and in the weakness of his old and decayed
years, laying the ground of all his policy, in fear and jealousy issuing
from a certain consciousnesse of his own worthlesnesse, and for want of
virtue, holds this course for the best, which works with the greatest
advantage, and most secret, against those which either are, or in time may
become concurrants or ennimies, letting pass with some terms of spiritual
commendations, those ancient and more noble ways, which being derived from
the high Policy whereby the Papacy does exclude the sound of reformed
religion.

principles of true wisdom and virtue, must needs be of great force, both for
the upholding and effecting of all worthy and honorable desires, were Spanish
inquisition.
there afirme mind to pursue them, and a strong arm to weild them; both which
to this weak world are wanting Council of Trent
but of this matter sufficient.

It is now time to come to the view of those mea^es which are used by the
Papacy, for excluding of all access and sound of Religion, in those places
where their power remains yet vnabridged: wherein (as in other like cases
before) I will lightly pass over that which is apparent to all eyes: and that
is, what service their Inquisition does therein, being in truth, the principal
and most forcible engine in accomplishing that work, and such as wheresoever
it, and the coundell of Trent can be thoroughly planted and established, (as in
Spain and all Italy, saving only in the kingdome^ of Naples, where the
tyranny of Spain is an Inquisition sufficient (as the Inquisition is also of
the two, the better) that it does rid the^ of fear, and their adversaries of
hope, of letting in the reformation unless perhapes in some universal deluge
of war, when the execution of laws and such searchers shall be forced to
cease. For this Inquisition being committed lighthly to the most zealous,
industrious, and rigorous Frias that can be found in all places, who leave no
one rule thereof unpracticed, taking hold of men for the least suspicion of
Heresy, or of affinity, or commerce with Heretics that may be, as the bare
reprooving sometimes the lives of the Clergy, or having any Book or edition
prohibited (though yet with some regard of the nature and quality of the
persons seeing many men make those octions su^icious, which otherwise would not
make the man) discovering men, by the pressing of all men's consciences, whom
they charge under an high degree of damnation (being a case reserved, and
wherein not any under a Bishop or Archbishop can absolve them) as I have seen
in their printed instructions at Scienna, to apeach even their nearest and
dearest friends if they knew, or did but suspect them to be culpable therein
proceeding against the detected, with such secrecy, and severitie, as that
first they shall never have notice of their accusers, but shall be urged to
reveal their very thoughts, and affections: Secondly, if by long inquiry
they be taken tardie in any one thing delivered in their opinions, or can be
convicted thereof by any two witnesses, they are cast and gone.

Thirdly, if nothing fall out to be prooved against them, yet will they hold
them in their holy house diverse years, sometimes in great anguish and misery,
for a ter^our to other, and for their exact trial. And lastly, besides all
other tortures and scorns, if one be touched the second time, nothing but
death without remission. This does so sweep all the quarters and corners where
it walks, that as a sheering wind it kills all in the budde, no wit nor
provision being possible to avoid it, yea, is such a bridle to the very
freedom of mind, and liberty of speech which they of their own way would
otherwise use, That many of their Catholics elsewhere who would die perhaps
if need so were, for their religion, yet abhor the very mention and name of
the Inquisitio^, as being the greatest slaverie, that ever the world has
tasted: and that the Venetians themselves could never yet be brought to admit
in other sort, then with certain very favorable exceptions for strangers
(who are generally also in Italy little searched into their consciences, by
reason of the gain that comes by their repair, but may pass well enough if
they give no scandal) and with retaining the sovereign sway thereof in their
own hands at all times. But to let the rack of men's souls thus rest as an
invention, fitter for the religion of Antiochus, and Domitian, or Mahomets
Alcheron, than for the clemency of his Gospel, who was Prince of mildness
and mercy, it is a wonderful thing to see what curious order and diligence
they use, to suffer nothing to be done or sprung up among themselves which may
any way give footing to the Religion they so much Suppressing the holy
Scriptures.
hate: And first for the scriptures, For So Much as the reformation seems
grounded upon them, having striven to square it out wholly by that rule, as
far forth as their understanding and wits could wade. And forasmuch as ^^ is
a thing which the Romanistes deny not, That a great part of their Religion
has other foundation, which seems in many points to swarve much, yea and
plainly to cross the scriptures, as an ordinare Reader by his mere natural
wit, not fashioned by their distinctions, nor directed by their glosses would
expound it. For this cause though heretofore to stop their adversaries mouths,
always yelping and crying with hateful soundes. That they would not suffer
the poor people to hear GOD speak to them, that they starued and murdered
their souls in ignorance, robbing them of the bread of life, the voice of
Christ, and cramming and choking them with their empty superstitions, their
poisoned Idolatries. That their scriptures would show them that their
worshipping of Images was ever with threats prohibited in the law of God: That
their praying in unknown languages, and by tale* is plainly reprooved, their
invocating and praying to saints, a matter there never heard of, that their
ceremonies were vanities, their traffic for souls very sacrilege, their
Miracles delusions, their indulgences blasphemies, that it would discover their
Church to be the body strangely infected and polluted with foul and pestilent
diseases, And finally, that their not erring and incon^oleable Lord of Rome was
no other than that imperious bewitching Lady of Babylon: though, I say, as
well to beat back these irksome outeries of their adversaries, as also to give
some content and satisfaction to their own, that they might not think them so
terrible afraid of the Bible, they were contented to let it be translated by
some of their favorers into the vulgar, as also some number of Copies thereof
to be saleable for a while at the beginning. Yet since having huisht that
former clamor and taken better provision for the establishing of their
affatres, they have called all vulgar Bibles straightly in again (yea the
very Psalms of David, which their factious Preacher Bishop Pa^gorola
translated) as doubting else the vnavaleablenesse of those former
inconveniences.

To let pass these hard conceits which they breed in the multitude, as
touching the inextricable obscurity of the scriptures, the easiness to
mistake it, the daungerousnesse to err by it, having raised in some places
such base and blasphemous proverbes concerning it, I would rather themselves
would extinguish them, than that I list to give life by recording them in this
place, neither yet in their very sermons, though they preach always in a
manner of the Gospel of the day, do they read or any way recite the text, but
discourse only on such points of it as they think fittest, without more
solemnity, that no sound of Scripture may possess the people, although the
use in France be otherwise for that matter, yea some parts of Scripture, as
Saint Paul's Epistles they are so jealous of, and think so dangerous, that (as
I have heard credible report, (for my self did not see it) some of their
Jesuits of late in Italy in solemn Sermons, and other their favorites
elsewhere in private communication commending between them Saint Peter for a
worthy spirit, have censured Saint Paul for a hot headed person, who was so
transported with his pangs of zeal and eagrenesse beyond all compass in most
of his disputes, That there was no great reckoning to be made of his
Assertions, yea he was dangerous to read, as savouring of heresy in some
places, and better perhaps he had never written* Agreeably to which I heard
other of their Catholics deliver, that it has been heretofore very
seriously consulted among them, to have censured by some means, and reformed
the Epistles of Saint Paul, though for my own part, I must confess I cannot
believe this point, as being an attempt too abominable and blasphemous, and
for these times too desperate a scandal. But howsoever, he of all other is
least beholding to them, whom of mine own knowledge and hearing some of them
teach in the pulpit, not to have been secure of his preaching, but by
conference with Saint Peter, nor that he durst publish his Epi stles, till
Saint Peter had allowed them, these orders they have taken to avoid danger
from the written word, advauncing in steed thereof, the amplitude, the
sufficiency, and infallible certainty of GODS Oracles and words not written,
but delivered by the custody of his holy Church by speech only, which Church
has delivered her mind in the Council of Trent, whereto al those that are
solemnly made Doctors in Italy must subscribe.

35 And as in the foundation of the Reformation which is the Scriptures, so
much more in the edifice it self, the doctrine and opinions they beat away
all sound and echo of them, being not lawful there to allege them, no not
to glaunce at them, nor to argue and dispute of them, no not to refute them: In
ordinary matter of com munication to talk of matters of religion is odious and
suspicious, but to enter into any reasoning, though for Argument sake, without
other scandal, is prohibited and dangerous Yea it was once my fortune to be
half thretned for no other fault than for debating with a Jew, and upholding
the truth of Christianity against him, so unlawful are all disputes of
Religion whatsoever: And the Friars even in France, in their indevours to
convert other, will say it is lawful to persuade them, but not to dispute with
them. But in Italy this is much more exactly observed, wherein their Divinity
disputations in their Universities or Colleges (as some such disputations they
have, but very slight and vnfrequent) I could not perceive that ever they
debated any question at this day controversed otherwise than as ever among
themselves, and between the Schoolmen. And which was more strange to me till
I sounded the reason, in no place of Italy where ever I came, could I have
any of their Preachers treat of any point in question between them and the
Protestants save only at Padua, where, in respect there are always diverse
hundredth of strangers of the adverse part, it is otherwise practiced. But in
all other places, for ought I could perceive, either they mention now no
adversaries, or if they do (which is very seldom) yet do they not unfold
their opinions and arguments, but either from other Chimeraes of their own in
steed of them, and so flourish about or two in canvasing their own shadows,
as is usual in France also, or else dispatch them away with certain general
reproaches, and then (as I have heard) some of them will formally conclude. But
what do I name Heretics in an assembly of Catholics? Howbeit they are not
so forgetful and careless of their cross neighbors, as this course might
seem at the first blush to import; but those offices they do, they do them
to the best purpose, teaching the people sometime in pulpit, much more in
private conference, and in their confession, that the Lutherans and Calvinists,
are blasphemers of God, and of all his Saints; and above all other, that they
despise and vilify our Lady, saying plainly, she was no better than one of
their own wives. That they abolish the Church Sacraments, the only means of
salvation, that where ever they come, they either raze or rob Churches, and
make stables of them, that in England they have neither Churches, nor any form
of religion, nor serve God any way, that the English Nation (since their
falling away from their Church) is grown so barbarous, that their students are
very Cannibals, and eat young children, and that there is no kind of villainy,
which is not current amongst them. And that above all other places, Geneva is
a very professed Sanctuary of Rogerie, giving harbor to all the runnagates,
traitors, rebels, and wicked persons of all other Countries: By which speech,
very generally in Italy, spread and believed, some memorable accidents have at
some times happened, Sundry of their prigging and loose Friars, hearing Geneva
to be a place of good fellowship (and thinking the worse prankes they played
with their own, ere they came there, to find the better welcome at their
coming) have robbed their Convents of their Church-plate, and repositorie, and
brought away the booty in triumph to Geneva, Custom of Geneva.
under the color of being reformed in their Religion, where their advancement
has been straight to the Gibbet for their labor; a reward unexpected, and
such as caused them to complain pitifully of their wrong information. For such
is the extraordinary severity of that City, as to punish crimes committed
without their estate, with no less rigor, then as if they had been done
amongst them. And not many years since, it was the lot of a Spanish Gallant,
who stood upon his State, and carried a Mint about him, to repair thither to
have stamps made him for the coining of Pistolets. His defense was, that he
understood that their City was free, and gave receipt to all offe^ders: but
withal (said they) when they were come they punished their offenses; a
distinction which the poor Gentleman never before studied, and the learning of
it then cost him no less then his head-peece. And as by those kinds of
slanders, so also to harden men's minds, against them, they will tell of
strange miracles have befallen them; a point wherewith the Pulpits of France
do also ring daily, where in the siege of Paris, they were grown to that
audaciousnes, as to persuade the people there (who generally believed it) that
the thu^der of the Popes excommunications had so blasted the Heretics, that
their faces were grown al black and ugly as Devils, their eyes and looks
ghastly, their breaths noisome and pestilent, much like to the Servide Madon and
Bollonia, whom I heard in Pulpit among a multude of modern miracles, which had
fallen out to their punishments who were excommunicated (the continuing wherein
a year without seeking absolution, incurreth suspicion of heresy) tell this
also of an heretical gentleman of Polonia, who talking at a solemn dinner
against the Pope, the bread of his trencher grew black as ink, and upon his
repentance it returned to his former whitenes. A thing happened but lately, and
reported by the Popish Ambassadors to a Cardinal, by the Cardinal to a
Bishop, by this Bishop to this Friar, an imitation perhaps of that renowned
miracle of eating tables for hunger, threatened by that winged Prophetess, with
like deduction of credit, Quae Phaebo pater omnipotens mihi Phoebus Apollo
Praedixit vobis furiarum ego maxima pando: And these things are in steed of
refuting the Protestants religion, which are not in vain: for the vulgar sort
of people, who believed (as they say) God and Pope, think all Gospel that
their Friars tell them. And I have heard some conjecture at others to be
Lutherans, only by reason that they were so monstrous blasphemers as they were;
but all are not of that stamp, those Gentlemen and others that have traveled
abroad, and those also at home, that are not paisionately blind, but discreet
and inquisitive of the truth of all things, howsoever dissenting from them, yet
have no such conceit of the Protestants opinions or actions. But the most
strange thing (as to me it seems) of all other; is, that those principal
writers, who have employed themselves wholly in refuting from point to point the
Protestants doctrine, and arguments, are so rare in Italy, as by ordinary
inquiry (I believe) are not to be found. The controversy of Cardinal
Bellarmine, I sought for in Venice in all places, neither that, nor Gregory of
Valenza, nor any of such quality, could I ever in any shop in Italy set eye on,
but in stead of them, an infinite of mere invectiues and declamations, which
made me intertain this suspicious conjecture, that it might be their care, that
no part of the Protestants positions and allegations should be known, they
were so exact, as to make discurre^t in some, even those very books, which
were constrained to recite them, that they might refute them in such wise, as
not to suffer them to be commonly saleable, but only to such, and in such
places, as the superiors shall think meet: but the truth of this conjecture I
leave to further enquiry. The conclusion is this, no sound of the reformed
religion, either stirring in Italy, or by any humane wit now possible to be
raised, for to bring in from foreign places any heriticall writing, though it
were without malice, it were two years straight imprisonment (as they say) if
he escaped so. So far are they from their adversaries, either simplicity, if
their cause be bad, or honesty, if good, who not only in the most of their
Replies, print both together, to give means of indifferency in judging to the
Reader, but even permit their adversaries (yet unanswered) disputers to run
current among them, so they be in the Latin, and not purposely written (as some
are) misdrawing the multitude. It remained now to restrain the Italians from
going abroad to foreign Countries where those contagious sounds and sights
might infect them. Herein the nature of the Italian does supply, who wonders
at us Englishmen that come traveling so far thither, himself having no
humor to stir one foot abroad. And indeed little need, considering how all
nations in Christendom do flock to him, but not so for merchants, these fly
abroad in exceeding abundance to all places, and in wealth (where ever they
come) overtop all other, such is their skill, their wit, their industry, their
parsimo nie. Behold then this late Popes exploit in that point, he has, by his
painted Bull, under pain of excomunication, forbidden them all repair for
traffic to heretical countries, whereupon some (as I hear) are retired from
England and other in other places are said to have importunated and obtained
some out chapel to have their Mass in. Thus has every gap his bush, each
suspicion his prevention.

36 One thing only remains as a garland to all the rest: It were a hard state
and tyrannical, where the Superiors should assume to themselves all license
of doing, and not permit the inferiors, at least wise, liberty of speaking,
which is but a slender revenge for so great a wrong as ill government; yet such
as by giving vent to the boiling fumes of ha tred, does evaporate and aslake
that heat which otherwise would flame out into fire and mischief. For which
cause the wisest me^ have bin always pleased, that loosers should have their
words. And they that endeavored to bridle men's tongues by sharp laws (whom they
rather should have charmed and held in tune by their own integrity) have
learned that things violent are seldom permane^t, that the enjoying of too
much patience, makes me^ break into mad nes. Yea, I have heard men of great
experience and judgment say, that the best way to reconcile country enmities
is, to let the good men chide a while heartily together, and their stomakes
once being disgorged, a peaceable motion will find good audience, so necessary
are these evaporations to the mind of the multitude, which may serve for a
justification of the wisdom of the Papacy in those former free times when
they; and others said, what each humor advised. But little was it then feared
which since has followed, little was it then imagined, that the time should
come, when the world awakened by the cries of a Friar, should look so broadely
about, and search so narrowly all the sleights and hid corners of the Papacy*
what their doctrine had been, what their lives, what their scopes, what their
practices. Not so many of the consecrated Divines, patrones of the Roman state,
with thousands of prayers and vows daily adored: nor so many of their
inshrined and myracle-woorking-Images, to whom such store of la^pes and pure
candels were daily burning, so much incense perfumed, so long iournies to
pilgrimage performed, such abundance of gifts and glad offerings presented,
One whom lastly, so many, so devout, so humble hung down heads, and bowed
knees, and beaten breasts, and lifted up eyes attended, did ever fore tell
so notable a calamity. It was not then thought that their would arise a
generation, who would allege in good earnest, that, diverse hundred of years
since, as also more freshly, sundry of their own Authors and followers, had
(in bitter detestation of their monstrous abomination) described out the Pope
for the antichrist foreprophesied; called Rome, the very Babylon and temple of
heresies, the corrupter of the world, the hate of heaven, and in effect, the
very gate or hieway to hell: that the lives of their Prelates, Priests, Friars
and Nuns, (not for some particular offenses which will always befall, but
for the ordinariy tenor and course of conversation) had been so reported by
men of their own religion, that an honest adversary cannot read them without
sorrow, nor a modest, without shame and blushing: that the iniquity of their
chief See has bin so exorbitant, as to have raised among themselves this
saying, amongst other concerning it, engrossed in their own book; That the
worst christians in Italy are the Romans, that of the Romans, the Priests are
the most wicked, the lewdest Priests are preferred to be Cardinals, and the
badest among the Cardinals is chosen to be Pope. Neither was it then foreseen
that the world entering into these considerations, would think that they had
reason, which called for a reformation, that it was not a fatal calamity of
this age, but a supernatural blessing of God from above, after the kindling of
many precursory lights of knowledge, and furnishing other instruments to serve
thereto, to direct a mere accident of scandal of their part, namely, the
indiscreet proclaming and seal on their pardons (as the wisest and worthiest
of their own Historiographers reports it) to the provoking of certain men of
more zeal, and courage, than policy, or skill in conducting their actions;
who without any such premeditated intent, yea and drawn into the listes, and
held in them against their will, by the violent pressing and insulting of their
adversaries, having been forced to sift thoroughly the Romish doctrine and
practice, have discovered therein those errors and abuses, which it was hie
time to be swept and purged out of the Church, and that the establishing of
this reformation, how imperfect soever, to be done by so weak and sinple
means, yea by casual and cross means, against the force of so puissant and
politic an adversary, is that miracle which we are in these times to look
for; wherein it pleases God (whose goodness does always speak out) to renown
his higher wisdom, in guiding this untoward world by ordinary courses, as in
fore-times his power by annexing therein his often extraordinary wonders. But
the Papacy at this day, by woeful experience, what damage this license of
writing among themselves has done them, and that their speeches are not only
weapons in the hands of their adversaries, but eyesores and stumbling blocks
also to their friends, under show of purging the world from the infection of
all the wicked and corrupt books and passages, which are either against
honesty or good manners; for which two purposes, they have their several
officers, who i^deed, blot out much impiousnes and filth, and therein deserve to
be both condemned and imitated (whereunto the Venetians add also a third to
let nothing pass that may justly be offensive to Princes) have in truth,
pared, and lopt off al whatsoever, in a manner, their watchful eyes could
observe, either free in disclosing their abuses and coruptious, or saucy in
construing their drifts and practices; or dishonorable to the Clergy, or
undutiful to the Papacy: these editions only authorized, all other are
disallowed, called in, consumed, with threats to whomsoever shall presume to
keep them; That no speech, no writing, no evidence of things past, no
discourse of things present: in sum, nothing whatsoever may sound ought, but
holiness, honor, purity, integrity to the unspotted spouse of Christ, and to
his unerring vicar, to the mistress of Churches, to the father of Princes. But,
as it falls out now and then, that wisdom and good fortune are the ruin of
them, that too much follow them, by drawing men sometimes, upon a presumtion of
their wit and cunning in contrivements and of their good succes withal in one
attempt, to adventure upon an other still of yet more subtle invention, and
more dangerous execution, which breaks in the end with the very finenesse it
self, and overwhelmes them with difficulties: So it is to be thought, that
their prosperous succes in pruning and pluming those latter writers affected
with good ease, and no very great clamor, as having some reason, and doing
really some good, was it that did breed in them a conceit, that it was
possible to work the like conclusion in writers of elder times, yea in the
fathers themselves. In all other monuments of reverend antiquity, and the
opinion of possibility redoubling their desire, brought forth, in fine, that
Index expurgatorius, whereof, I suppose, they are now not a little ashamed,
they having by misfortune lighted in their adversaries hands (from whom they
desired by all means to conceal them) where they remain as a Monument to the
judgment of the world, of their everlasting reproach and ignomy. These purging
Indices are of diverse sorts, some work not above 800. years upward, other
venture much higher, even to the prime of the Church, the effect is, that
forasmuch as there were so many passages in the Fathers, and other ancient
Ecclesiastical writers, which their adversaries producing in averment of their
opinions, they were not able, but by tricks and shifts of wit, to reply and
to ease themselves, of that wit, labor, and quality, perhaps indede, more
commendable in some other trade than in Divinity, where Verity should sway,
where the love of the truth should assubiect or extinguish wholly all other
passions, and the the eye of the mind fixed attentively upon that object,
should divert from the regarding of other motions whatsoever. Some assemblies
of their Divines, with consent, no doubt, of their redoubted superiors and
soveragnes, have delivered express order, that in the impressions of these
Autors, which hereafter should be made the sca^dalous places there named,
should be clean left out, which perhaps (though in this present age would have
finally prevailed to the reclaiming of their adversaries) it would have bin
great assurance to the retayning of their own, to whom no other books should
have bin granted; yea perhaps, Time and Industry, which eat even thorrow
marbles, extinguishing or getting into their hands all former Editions: and for
any other new to be set ^u* by their adversaries there is no great fear, whose
books being discurrant in all Catholics countries, their want of means
requisite to utter an impression, would disharten them from the charge, the
mouth also of Antiquity should be thoroughly shut up from uttering any syllable
or sound against them.

Lastly, by adding words where opportunity and pretense might serve, and by
drawing in the marginall notes and glosses of their friars into the text of the
fathers, (as in some of the^ they have already very hansomely begu^, for the
mouth of antiquity should be also opened for the^) Their remained then only
the rectifying of S Paul, whose turn in all likeliehoode, (if ever) should be
the next, and other places of Scripture, whose authority being set beneath the
Churches already, it were no great matter to submit also to her censures,
especially for so good an intent, as the weeding out of heresies, and the
preserving of the Catholic says in his purity and glory. But above all other,
the second Commandment (as the Protestants, Grecians, and Jews reckon it)
were like to abide it, which already in their vulgar catechism is discarded as
words superfluous, or at leastwise unfit or unnecessary for these times: and
then, without an Angel sent down from heaven, no means to control or gainsay
them in any thing. But these are the dreams, perhaps, of some over-passionate
desires, at leastwise not likely to take place in our times. But what is it
which the opinions of the not possibility of erring, of the necessary
assistance of Gods spirit in their Consistories, of authority unlimited, of
power both to dispense of Gods laws in this world, and to alter his arrests
and judgments in the other (for thereunto do their pardons to them in
Purgatory extend). What is it which these so high and fertile opinions are not
able to engender, and powerfully to enforce, and to execute, carrying men away
headlong with this raging conceit; that whatsoever they do by the Popes, they
do by Gods own commandment, whose Lieutenant on the earth he is, by a
commission of his own penning: that is to say, with absolute and unrestrained
jurisdiction, that whatsoever they do for the advancement of his See and
Scepter, they do it for the upholding of the Church of Christ, and for the
salvation of men's souls, which out of his obedience do undoubtedly perish.
And verily it seems, no causeless doubt of fear, that these humors, so
forward, so ventrous to alter and chastise with palpable partiality, the works
of former times in any age, which has so many jealous eyes on their fingers,
so many mouth^s open to publish their own shame, such store of coppies to
restore and repair whatsoever they should presume to maime or deprave that in
former ages, when there were few copies, small difficulties, no enemies, as it
is found by certain and irresragable arguments; that bastard writings were
forged in their favor, and fathered on honest men, who never begat them. So
also they might besides, by their choppings and changings, puttings in, and
pvttings out, suppress many good evidence which they perceived were not
greatly to their purpose should be extant. But of all others, in reforming and
purifying of Authors, the care and diligence of this Pope does far exceed,
who not content with that which has been done in that kind before him, nor
thinking things yet so bright as they should be, causes much to be perused and
skowred over anew; yea, and it is thought, will cassiere some worthy Authors,
who as yet (though with cuts and gashes) hold rank amongst them. And for a
further terror, not to retain books prohibited, I have seen in their printed
instructions for confession, the hearing or reading of books forbidden, set in
rank amongst the sins against the first Commandments. And for further
provision, the Jews (who have no other trades to speak of, then loan of
money and old stuff) are inhibited in many places the meddling any more with
books, for fear that through error or desire of lucre, they might do them
prejudice. Neither is it lawful in Italy to carry books about from one place
to another, without allowance of them from the Inquisitor, or search by their
authorities, wherein as I confess, they have neglected nothing which the wit
of man in this kind could possibly devise. So yet it may be doubted, that as
too much wiping does in the end draw blood with it, and soil more then before;
so these too rigorous cuting off of all Authors tongues, leaving nothing which
may favor any freedom of spirit, or give any satisfaction for understanding
times past, may raise such a longing for the right Authors in the minds of all
men, as may encourage the Protestants to reprint them in their first
entireness, having hope given to vent them, although in secret. These have I
observed for the complots and practices of the Roman Church and Papacy, not
doubting but that they may have many more, and much finer then I can dream of:
and yet in the surveying of these altogether, me thinks they are such, that it
causes me in generality of good desire to wish, that either the cause which
they strive to maintain, were better, or their policies whereby they maintain
it, were not so good.

37 Now to take a view of the present state of the Papacy, or rather of some
points therein more requisite to be known: First, to consider it in his own
proper and peculiar Dominions, namely, in the Seigniories and Territories which
the Pope holds in Italy, (for as for Avignon with his County Uenassive in
France, by reason of the ill neighborhood of the Protestants of Grange, it has
yielded him (I ween) in these latter times no great matter) yea, rather it
has been an overcharge unto him: for which cause, they like well to be under
the Pope, as bringing more unto them, then he takes from them. I take it at
this day, of the four great States of Italy, (by reason of the access of the
Dukedom of Ferrara, escheated to him of late) to be clearly the third at
least, and to surmount the great Dukes, which it has well-nie surrounded also,
yea, question might be made concerning the second place. For although the
Venetians in amplitude of Territories far, and in greatness of revenewes not
alittle exceed it: yet (besides other difficulties and charges of necessity, to
which they are more subject) in military force they greatly come short, the
popes men retaining still the brave hearts of their ancestors, and breeding
among them plenty of able leaders, whereof at this present, both the great
Duke and Venetians, do serve themselves, whereas the Lumbards, wherein is the
scumme of the states of Uenice, are as heavy and unwarlike, as their soil is
deep and fat: inso much, that the Venetians are driven to seek abroad, and
especially to the Grecians, from whom they are to have at all times, ten
thousand at call. But on the contrary side, being to be alleged, that the
Uenetians are by sea puissant, where the Pope can do nothing, I suppose they
may still hold the second place of greatness. The first even in Italy without
other respects, being incomparable due to the Spanish mightiness; and this in
possession: Besides which, all Italy holding, partly of the Pope partly of the
Empire, (save the City of Uenice, who acknowledge no Lord) of the Pope the
Kingdom of Naples and Cicile, with their dependants, the Dukedomes of Parma,
Valencia, and Vrbin, besides other less quillets of these. The Duchy of Urbin
no great thing, but full of goodly men, and of some 100000. crowns revenewes,
is in great probability to devolve to the church ere long, the Duke being in
years, and without heir, though as now unmarried, by his old wives decease of
late. But the Jesuits labor hard that he so remain, persuading him that
Bigamy is not so acceptable an estate to God. Here is also possibilities of
the cheating of Parma and Placentia, there being but the young Duke, who
remains still unmarried, being withstood, as it is thought, in his long love
to Florence, both by Spain of old, and now by the Pope, (also besides, the
great Duke is not hasty to forgo his Neeces portion) and the Cardinal
Furnesy his brother, who in that case I believe, should find as difficult a
suit at Rome for dispensation to marry, as the Duke of Farara did before him,
for a transport of his tenure. Of Naples I can say nothing, either for
probability or possibility, as things now stand, only it is apparent that the
Popes have a very great desire unto it, and opinion of good title also even in
present; but the unfortunate success and fearful example of Pope Sixtus
Quintus does fear them, who of a simple Friar, being advanced to the Papacy,
by the favor of Spain, whom of long he had served, foreseeing very plainly
the inevitable bondage, which together with all Italy, the very Apostolic
Sea, and Lady Church did grow into, perceiving their irreligion in
encroachmentes upon their Church-rights, their tirannous importuning him to
serve their turn and humors, their bravadoes, threats, insolences, and
lording over him. When his eyes did see this daily, and could not remedy it
otherwise, being constrained by these iminent dangers and present indignities,
he durst harbor in his mind the afflicted forsaken thoughts of Paulus
Quartus his predecessor, and embrace a design of chasing the Spaniards out of
Italy, and especially of recovering the Realm of Naples to the Church, which
has now but a quit-rent, of four thousand crowns out of it, being one of the
richest places that is in the world. For the effecting of which purpose, by
enhaunsing his impostes upon all commodities, after the example of the other
Princes and states, his neighbors, and by other devises together, with good
managing in short time, he raised five millions of treasure, a good ground of
war. And moreover, after the example of the same Paulus Quartus, who brought
into Rome it self, two thousand Almanes Lutherans, to oppose against the Duke
of Alva, King Philips General in Italy, yea, and was content to endure quietly
those abuses and despites which they daily offered to his Images and
Sacraments, and sundry other devotions, as remains in a report of credit not
to be excepted against. So this Sixtus began covertly to seek strength from
the Protestants, propounding to favor this French Kingslabours, yea and
desiring to entertain good correspondency with England, conunending her
Maiestics government above all Princes in the world, by which neglect ^ee drew
upon him so great offense of the Spanish party, and especially of the
Jesuits, from whom also as being too rich; for vows of poverty he took at
one clappe above 20000. crowns rent, and bestowed upon Saint Peter, as I have
heard reported, as they have styled him an Avarist, that the devil, with whom
he had intelligence, came and fetched him away, being in truth, one of the
worthiest Popes this age ha^h seen. The vnpropsperous events of these high
indevours, and his precipitated ruin, who dared to advance them, having been
poisoned by Spanish practice, as the wisest there say (and whilst my self was
in Italy, a Priest, one of the Popes subjects, reported in secret, that there
was lately a supplication pute up to his Holiness, by a person unknown,
craving absolution at his hands, for making away of a Pope, which was thought
could be no other then this Sixtus,) does terrify them that come after from
venturing themselves in the like, and for imitating his actions, whose end they
have cause to tremble at.

So Naples remains not in his view that has most right to it, but in his
hands and arms that i^ strongest to hold it. And this for the Popes temporal
state, which may perhaps yield him now near two millions of yearly
revenewes, by reason of the great increase Ferrara has brought, and be able to
make at home for their own defense, some hundred thousand fighting men, or
thereabouts, if need were.

Besides which rent arising at home at his own state, that which he sucketh
out of foreign parts is not small even at this day, though nothing perhaps
in comparison of those former rich times, when money came in daily so flush from
all quarters, that there temporality, (which now they make their principal)
was then but an accessory addition to their greatness. For among other blows
which Luther has given that See, it has compelled them, besides the entire
loss in Countries revolted, even out of those which stick to them, to draw
more moderately then before, for fear of offending: yea, they have been also
in these latter times, forced to share or yield up into the hands of great
Princes (of France namely, and Spain, for the better assuring them) a* great
part of those fleeces, which themselves were wont to share from the Clergy
heretofore, without any partners: howbeit in Italy and some other places, their
annuities and tenths, do still run current, (besides the Spogly, as they
term them, or strippings which they have of Clergy men at their deaths,
unless in their lifetime, by some yearly pension they list to redeem) and
amount (no doubt) to a good round sum. His gain out of Spain is thought
matchable very near to that of Italy, which the Kings thereof do and will
more contentedly endure, for the better assuring of the Papacy unto them, which
otherwise were likely to run mainly with France; I would not report it, but
that I have it from me^ good of place, that Pius Quintus, under pretenses
(after the Council of Trente) of reforming their Clergy and such like
affairs, was complained on to the Counsel of Spain, to have drawn fourteen
millions from them out of the Kingdom. what gains their pardons bring, I
cannot estimate, they being not sold now to particular persons after their
former usage, saving in Spain and the appurtenances to them, whereof also the
late King himself was said to have the greater share and in regard thereof, to
have pressed it mightily upon his people. It is to be presumed, that such a
multitude of general, perpetual, and plenary indulgences, for all persons,
times and offenses, as are granted to the religious houses, and to some other
Churches of Italy, and to sundry in France also, yield somewhat to the holy
father, in way of thankful acknowledgment, considering that their gain by them
is nothing.

The Cordeliers at Orleance, at the publishing of one indulgence, picked up
(as they say there) four thousand at a blow. But howsoever the mistrie of that
secret stands, this is plain and apparent; that the Popes are contented to
use their religious houses, as very spunges, to drink what juice they can
from the people, that afterward, he may wring them out, one by one into his
own cesterne. The Covents have from him these indulgences of grace to remitte
sins, and free souls from Purgatory: at the yearly publishing whereof in
their Churches, there stands in some convenient place, the box of devotion,
with some poor begging crucifixe likely before it, and two tapers of each side
to see the chinke to put money in. What man can be so unthankful, so stony,
and dry-harted, as to give nothing to them, who have forgiven him so much,
especially, there never being wanting some holy pretense to encourage, nor many
an eye open to see their good doing;

Besides this, the Pilgramages to their miraculous imager, which drew great
commodities to their Cities also and states, wherein the people not ignorant
thereof, help to set them a working: a consideration that brings contentment
therewith no less to the Princes. So sweet is the taste of gain from
whatsoever, the visiting of their holy relics, (both which have their
offerings) the purchasiing of masses, both auxiliatory and expiatory, their
rewards for praying, their collections for preachings, besides sund^y other
duties, amongst which their obi^^s which are so beneficial, that their account
is from a rich man, to draw viis and modis, some hundred at his funeral, or
else it goes hard: yea, this is so certain, and so good a rent unto them,
that if any man should be buried without their solemnity, and some of their
odors to accompany his coarse, he should be thought a very heriticke, and to be
sure to have some bad brute set abroach concerning him; as fell out not long
since to a welthie Citizen of Lucca who willed by his testament, to be buried
in the night, without their ringing, tapering, censing, attending, or singing,
had a rumor soon spread on him by the belly devote Friars, whom hunger and
loss of hope, have made wickedly irefull, that he was haunted and molested
with rattes on his death bed: these means extraordinary, be sides these
ordinary revenewes, increasing often by inheritance, discending upon them,
which happen to any of their brotherhoods, goes (to the convent for ever: such
is the law of Italy) being granted or permitted by the Pope to the Friars, and
all to enrich them. The law requires, reason and equity allows, and their
vows of poverty advises, that when they grow too rich his Holiness should
let them blood in their over-full veins, for his necessary sustenance, as did
Sixtus, who pared away the superfluities of sundry rich Covents, as fitter for
his high estate and honorable designs, then for them, who had poverty in
their vowed recommendations: This Pope deals more gently by way of loanes,
which may perhaps in the end come all to one reckoning. Besides the which, when
war against the Turks, or Heretics, or other enemies of the Church, or any
other great affairs requires employment of the Church treasure, then are taxes
and subsidies imposed, or requested to a certain proportion, upon the
revenewes of all Abbeyes, and other religious Covents in Italy, besides the
rest of the Clergy, which can be no small matter, as was done these last
years for the service of Hungary. I might add hereunto the toll of his
foreign commodities, the fees of dispensations, chiefly in prohibited degrees
for marriage, and infinite other expeditions, wherein his Papal authority does
accommodate, and is accommodated reciprocal of all Nations; but this is
sufficient to verify that assertion, that eve^ at this day those out-incoms
are good helps for an extraordinary odd share when need is. And yet all this
notwithstanding the treasure of the Church is small. Sixtus Quintus left five
millions by his great reckonings and husbandry: his successor Gregory the 14
wasted four of the^ i^ten months and less, above his ordinary revenews, in
pomp and riot. This man is very chary over that one remaining and disstilleth
all other devices, rather then set finger to that string* which yet his late
Prowesses have caused him to assay. But were the Church rent and gain how huge
soever; two assiduall Horseleaches which never leave sucking it, will never
suffer it to swell overgreat in treasure. The first is the high place of
honor, which he takes far above all other Princes and Monarchs in the
world, which draws him to inestimable charge in all places, to carry it
wi^h countenance and comeliness requisite; being forced thereby in his own
train, in the intertainment he gives Princes, in the allowance he gives his
Legates, Nuncioes, and other Ministers, which according to his own greatness
are sent into other Countries, and lastly, in furnishing out the multitude of
his actions and practices over the world, do raise his charge, for the most
part, according to the proportion of his high estate (for Honor and
Frugalitie, are the unfittest companions that can be). It is Liberality and
Expense, that both breeds and maintains honor; neither can a judicial man
perhaps wish worse to his enemy, than to have an honorable calling, and a
poor living.

Another thing which keeps the Papacy always so bare, yea, and makes their
temporal state the worse, governed in Italy (for so it is counted) is their
often change of Popes, by reason of their years, the infinite desire each
has to advance his kindred, his children first if he have any, as Paulus the
third, who left his base issue no less than Dukes of Placentia, and Parma:
Gegorius the thirteenth more lately, who made his base son Duke of Sora, and
Castellane, of Saint Angelo. And if they have no children, or list not be
known of them, then their Nephews and other kinsmen, which is common to them
all: yea, it often falls out, that those Popes, who have not any known
children of their own, by extending of their love larger to a great multitude
of their Nephews, yet desiring for their own renown, and perpetuating of
their own name, to raise them to a great estate and wealth as they can
possibly) do consume more the goods and treasure of the Church, than those
other, who have their loves though stronger, yet to fewer, as was apparent in
the two Gregory, the thirteenth, with his few sons, and the fourteenth with
the multitude of his Nephews and Kinsmen: and these men being raised often
from the bottom of baseness to the height of pride and power, having no hold
in their hand, nor scantling of their fortunes, as having never been in middle
state, which is the measure of both extremities, do fall into riot, able to
ruin a Prince, and rage and ravine in their Offices and Government, as they
that knowing their time short, mean to use it to the full proof. The examples
of both are many, and fresh, which for their foulness and baseness, I list
not to repeat, for which cause it was a good help to Sixtus Quintus to be
Pope, that he had small kindred, though the ground is mooveable, seeing
pedegrees change (for the most part) together with men's fortune, which as a
conscionable Arbirator, neither annoyes the poor ever with multitude of
kinsmen, nor discomforts the rich with paucitie.

39 For the sta^e of the Clergy under the Papacy, it varies as the
Countries. In Spain the Prelates are exceeding rich in revenewes. The
Archbishoppricke of Toledo, not inferior to some Kingdoms; in Italy the
livings of Prelates a^e competent, considering the excessive multitude: yet
with so great diversities, as some mere Bishoprics are above two thousand
Crowns rent, and other some under a thousand Crowns. But the custom of Italy
which auoydeth, yea, and blames multitude of Servants, and great
house-keepings in all sorts and degrees* makes (...) all matter sufficient,
and a great superfluous. Besides, there to have many livings, is a matter of
cred^^e, and not of profit only, though as wise men as they have thought
otherwise of it, to be a private great burden, and a public great mischief.
The Parish Priests in Italy, who have no^ the Tenthes, which in a Country,
whose soil yields three harvestes in sundry* places, all in one year,
would amount to an huge matter; and considering the great rents and rackes
would be unsupportable, but have in stead of them certain farms as gleabe
land appropriate, and some certain small quantity out of the increase of
their neighbors, are so provided for, that the meanest lightly which are their
Curates, have a hundred crowns a year, and the Piovatri which are Priests of
mother Churches from two hundred, to five hundred and upwards sometimes, which
they help out with masses as occasion serves, which are still in Italy as
cheap as a groat. In Germany the Prelates are lightly great Princes, and great
Nobility is required to have those places. In France the Clergy has been
in fore-times most flourishing, their revenew amounting when land and all
things were cheapest, to six millions in the whole, besides their great place
in the state, and ample jurisdictions in their precincts: at this day they are
fallen generally, especially the inferior part, into great misery, and
beggary, accompanied with all base and vilde conditions, whereby the common
people is grown utterly also without knowledge of God, or sense of religion,
being fallen into those terms, that plenty which should make men thankful,
makes them wanton, and affliction which should make men repentant, makes them
desperate, and nothing can better them. The whole Realm in sum, has been
scourged with a three stringed whip, War, ill Government, and Injustice,
whereof the two latter are likely to last still, whiles on the one side, the
places of Justice are sold, as by the Drum on the other side. The Church
Prelacies, and other governments of souls, are made the fees and charges of
their Courtiers, and soldiors* whose merits would have rewards, but suting to
their quality, which in such a realm as that, could not want, but for want of
indifferency, and measure, heaping all upon a few, and most, where are less
deserts: whereas these so unfit and ill suited recompenses, distemper that
harmony which should be in ^ flourishing state, and fill the land with all kind
of corruption, and confusion.

40 But to return to the Papacy, or rather to the Pope himself, and first to
his election, the right whereof having been of old in the Clergy and
people, and from thence transferred to the Emperors nomination, is now wholly
remitted to the college of Cardinals, so that two third parts of their
voices that are present are requisite to him, that either by adoration or
scrutenie shall carry it away which double proportion of voices to agree, makes
this election of greater difficulty, and gives occasion of rarer devises in
it, than I suppose are to be found in other parts of the world. I have heard
that in these latter times a Cardinal of Sicilie, whose holiness and learning
advaunced him to that dignity; (for of some, such always there is care to
make choice for diverse considerations) entering the Conclave to an election, and
exspecting that by incessant prayer as in times of old, some divine
inspiration should have pointed out Christ's vicar, But finding when he was
there, nothing but practicing, and canvassing, promising, and terrifying,
banding, and combining, setting some up for stalles, only to ease passage for
others, who were reserved unto the last course, when other men's hopes and
angers being spent and evaporated, had abated the prime edge and strength of
oppositions; In sum, being himself also assaulted by all means, yea tugged
and haled now by one party, now by another; the good man aghast, as in a matter
clean contrary to his fore-framed expectation. Ad hunc modum (said he ( fiunt
Pontifices Romany. There with all, so soon as the Conclave was broken up he
retired to his country, and never saw Rome again. But the matter of greatest
mark herein at this day, is the power of the K. of Spain in swaying those
Elections, who by pensions, by perferments, by hopes of the highest, has
assured a great third part of the Cardinals to him: And to be always at his
devotions in all Elections, whereby having the exclusive (as they term it) no
Pope can be made but with his liking. He prodeeds on by his Ambassadors to name
also some five or six unto them, whereof please they but to choose any, he
shall rest well satisfied: which course though it mightily distaste the rest of
the Cardinals, who are hereby for ever debased from their chief desire, yea
and inwardly much afflict: the great states of Italy, who are loath to have
their Pope of a Spanish Edition, yet there is no remedy, one of these in fine
they must needs choose, the discretion they can have, is only this, to choose
such of them as is like to prove least to his purpose.

A memorable example hereof in the election of the said Gregory, where the
greatest part of the Cardinals enflamed against the King, and banding
against him, yet in conclusion, after two months imprisonment in the
Conclave, were forced to relent, and to choose one of his nomination, or
otherwise a clear case, no Election at all, which whether there were or no,
made no matter to Spain who stands upon a sure ground in his exclusive
obstinatenesse. The nessesitie of the Church, the state of the Papacy, their
own present condition, the disorders of the city of Rome, and of all their
territories which in want of a Pope, and this locking up of the Cardinals
in a cellar, do swarve exceedingly, did maynly cry out to have some Pope or
other, which at the last they yielded to, by consenting upon a favorite, yea a
subject of Spain also, for such was that Gregory, howbeit the maine matter
runs not with him so clearly, they being not the same men that are chosen,
and that are Popes: But changing with their estates both name and nature also,
yea sometimes not easier to find two diverse men of humors more different,
than is the same man in his Cardinalship, and in his Papalitie, whereof no
better witness than Sixtus Quintus, the most crooching humble Cardinal that
ever was lodged in an oven, and the most stowt resolute Pope that ever ware
Crown: in his Cardinalshipe, a mere vassal and slave of Spain, in his
Papasie, the most dangerous enemy that Spain ever had in the world: in sum,
who in his Cardinalship was scorned as a base Friar, in his Papacy was
reverenced as a Prince of great worth and spirit; neither is there any marvel
to be made of this difference, seeing the means of obtaining and maintaining
the Papal honor are so clean contrary, seeing in the one state they fashion
themselves to all other men's humors, in the other, they look all men should
accommodate themselves to their honors. And lastly, seeing these Princes, whose
favors are the only hopes to compass this place, and their power quelling
down the estate. For this cause as in general the Cardinals do, in their
hearts favor France above Spain, both as being the weaker part, and the
further neighbors, and the only hope to maintain counterpose against the
others greatness. So let the king of Spain make what choice among them of a
Pope he can, he shall find that as long as these reasons continue, whosoever
sits in the seat, will more respect his own safety, than the service of his
preferrors, even as does this very Pope, who for that cause is conceived to
have made some alteration of inward friendshippes, though holding good terms
of love and loyalty with both. But this uncertainty and mutability of the new
Popes affections does cause both the K. of Spain and other princes of Italy,
above all other things, to aim at a man of calm nature, and not of stirring
metal, that if they cannot make any great account of his friendship, yet his
natural disposition and temper may assure them, that he shall not be a raiser
of new stirs in Italy, and diverse of them to scamble somewhat for there own,
have bin as on the other side, a special good inducement to the Cardinals,
in his age and sickness, that the place may be soon void again; for the
gaining whereof there is always practicing and plotting immediately upon the
Election.

41 Thus is the Pope made, who has his council of cardinals to attend and
advise him, he chosen by them. and they created by him, whose number may
amount, they say to 72 but many places are kept void still, to serve for
desperate pushes: for these there are some 20. being lightly the yo^ger sons
of Dukes and Princes, who) in case their Ancestors states should descend up on
them, with dispensation from the Pope, may resign up their hats among the
Cardinals for their own honor, and for the gratifying of the world,) are
sorted out and divided, all the orders of religions, and all the nations of
christendom, whereof they are appointed the particular protectors in the Court
of Rome, As the Protector of England now is Cardinal Caietane, a very stout
man of Spanish faction, who has been Legate into France, and more lately
into Poland, but now returned.

42 Now for this Pope, who is by country and birth, a Florentine, was chased
from thence with his father upon a conspiracy against Don Cosmito; I have
little more to say, than what I have before touched, he is reputed to be a
man of a good calm disposition, and not too crafty* yet close, and one that
can hold his own well enough, kind to his friends, and devout in his wa^es,
and thinks without doubt, that he is in the right: he will weep very often
(some conceive upon a weakness and tenderness of mind, habituated therein by
custom,) others say upon piety and godly compassion. At his mafles, at his
processions, at the fixing up of his iubilies, his eyes are still watering,
sometimes streaming with tears, insomuch, that for weeping he seems an other
Heraclitus, to balance with the last Gregory another Democritus for laughing*
Touching his secret life the Italians speak somewhat diversely, especially for
his younger years. But men's tongues are always prone to taint their
governors, and the worse men speak worse, in hope to lurk themselves under
the blemish of their betters. For my part, hearing no extraordinary badde
matter against him, but only by suspicion, I judge the best, and howsoever, I
had rather preserve the credit of a bad man, than stain or impair it in a
good. For his years, he does not much exceed three score, but is troubled
with the dropsy, and that caused (some say) accompanied with a thirsty
infirmity, for a Prelate he has good comendations, an enemy to the
licentious lives of the Friars, yea to the pomp* also, and secular braverie of
Cardinals, howbeit more desiring reformation in both, then daring to attempt
it in either, for ought as yet appears. Very magnificall and ceremonial in
his outward comportment, in his private, carriage humble, as his friends say, in
managing the Church temporal goods, rather trusty than liberal, but of
their spiritual treasure of supererogatorie works large, bountiful in
Indulgences and Pardons which they vse^ not only as charitable reliefes of the
needy, but as honorable gifts also to reward Princes that have presented him.
In these I should think him very exceeding wastful, but that where the
treasure is infinite, there the spender in ordinary estimation cannot be
prodigal. For a Prince he has been somewhat defective heretofore, as being
neither of deep resolution, nor of great spirit. But fortunate men are wise,
and conquerors are valiant. And surely this man's proiects and attempts have so
well prospered, what in the matter of Ferrara, what in working the great peace,
(the honor whereof by them often is wholly attributed to the pope* though others
say he was importuned to deal in it by the Spaniard, being so tired and
waisted out with troubling his neighbors, that in fine he delighted not in any
thing but in peace only,) that he has purchased him the opinion not only of a
fortunate and wise Pope, but of one who does sincerely affect the quiet of
Christendom, and thinks nothing remaining to the height of his glory, but to
be the Author of an universal league, and war against the Turk against whom
he has sundry times given aid already, and that for that end
(notwithstanding his ability and opportunity, what by his excommunications,
what by his ready army to have righted himself yet has he laid by his own
particular pretenses, as well against the great duke of Tusca for Burgo di San
Sepulcr^, which belongs to the Church, as also, and more principally against
the Venetians for Romgo and the Polissina, which they have rent by war, and
retain from farrara, not to mention that ancient quarrel touching the
Patriarkship of Aqueileia, whose territory even all Friuli their state has
usurped, that no private nor temporal commodity of this Church and Sea, might
give ^^pediment to the public good, in withstanding and repressing the grand
enemy of Christendom. These thoughts surely are honorable, neither unnecessary
for his own future safety, considering how near a neighbor the Turk is to
him, and how often his state has bin afflicted by him and sometimes in hazard.
But now for his near neighbors the great Duke, and the Uenetians as their
States; so their loves and his, are but neighbourly, they thinking his growing
to be their stop and endaungering, But the Uenetians perhaps fear him, and
the great Duke hates him more. The Uenetians having still painted in their
great Palace, and daily before their eyes, the extremity which former Popes
excommunications has brought the^ to, having their state as ill seated* in
regard of potent neighbors, who all gape after them upon any advauntage, as any
that I know again in the world. The Turk confining and bordering with them on
the East; the King of Spain on the West; the Emperor on the North, and the
Pope on the South, who can never want pretense, they holding that which they
list not yield: besides some iealousies and discurtesies passed lately between
them and the Pope and his Cardinals. The great duke, not only for that
hereditary enmity first, and that personal discourtesie since, and what for
effecting that title of King of Tuscanie, whereof his wife is written Queen by
some already: and having gotten as is said the Emperors liking, the Pope denied
him in putting him off, with a distinction, that he was content he should be K.
in Tuscanie, but not of Tuscanie which scholasticall subtilties plain suitors
love not, but much more care for the corresponde^cie of conference and favor
which is thought to be between the Pope, and those popular Florentines; who
distasted with their home government, once free, now almost servile, live
elsewhere abroad, and at Rome in exceeding store, specially seeing not only the
Pope in the faction of his particular family, but all popes in the affection
which the Papacy both engender, do naturally more desire that their neighbors
states should be popular, as having the ground of their greatness in swaying
the multitude. But generally the Duke of Tuscane will be always regardfull to
hold the best correspondency with the Popes that may be, as having their state
very often to assault on that side, the rest being surrounded by the Appennine
and the Sea. To conclude, this Pope, where there is no private cause of
disfavoring his person, or disalowing his place, carries the name of a good
Pope, and they which do subtly see the points of goodness, more then
curiously, will say, that ^ius Quintus was a good Prelat, but no good Prince,
that Sixtus Quintus was a good Prince, but no good Prelate. Gregory the 13. a
good Prince and Prelate, but no good man, this Pope, both good man, good
Prince, and good Prelate, and so I leave him (wishing his daily increase in all
parts of true goodness, whereof his Church has too little) and himself
happily (as other good men) nothing too much: returning to the Papacy.

43 The next point which comes to be considered, is, The foreign strength of
the Papacy.
what power it is at this day in this world, by reason of those nations, which
either in whole or greater part still adhere unto it, which are Italy with his
Islands, Spain with his Indies, Germany with his skirts, which I count the 17
provinces of the Low countries, on the one side, the 13 Cantons of Suizzers,
and 3 leagves of Grisons on an other, and Bohemia with his Marquisate of
Moravia and Slesia on the third. And lastly, the great united, well seated,
fruitful, populous Kingdoms of France, with his neighbors of Loraine and
Savoy, whom though Princes of the Empire, whenever themselves list, and find
it for their profit, yet in regard of their greater affinity to France, both
in language and fashion (which associate also affections) I annexe unto it, of
all which, some brief seems necessary to be taken. For as for Poland and
Transylvania, with Valachia and the remains of Hungary, by reason of their
near and dangerous confining with the Turk, together with the multitude of
Religions, which are swarming in them, (in Poland especially, of which it is
said by way of bi-word, That if a man has lost his Religion, let him to go
seek it in Poland, and he shall be sure to find it, or else make account that
it is vanished out of the world,) there is no great reckoning to be made of
their force either way. Then England, with the more North Kingdoms, Scotland,
Denmark, and Sweden, (whose King notwithstanding is of the Roman faith now,
but has few there that follow him.) They are accounted to have wholly cast off
the Papacy* for albeit they make reckoning of many savourers in them, as of
four thousand sure Catholics in England, with four hundred English Roman
Priests, to maintain that militia, who upon quarrel with the Jesuits,
affectors of superiority, and disgracers of all that refuse to depend upon
them, have instantly demanded of late, a Bishop of the Pope to be cosen by
them, and to be resident among them: yet this is so small a portion, being
compared with the whole, as not to be esteemed, especially seeing in Italy
counted wholly theirs, there are full four thousand professed Protestants,
that have exercise of their Religion also in the valleies of Pimont, and
Salusto, besides sundry Gentlemen who live abroad, and resort to them. In
Lucca also a great part are thought favorites of the reformation: some of that
sort there are scattered in all places, especially in Venice. But their p^ucity
and obscurity shall enclose them in a Cipher: so that Italy we will account it
to stand wholly for the Papacy, though the Princes, and other free States
thereof, little like the Popes enlarging his temperall Dominion at home, being
already of a large sise in proportion with theirs, and especially for those
pretenses, which his Sea never wants, and those extraordinary advantages with
concurrence of his spiritual supremacy, do give him by interdictions,
excommunications, discharging oaths of obedience, which above all other they
have greatest cause to fear, both in regard of their huge company of Priests,
Prelates, and Friars, wherewith he has fortified himself mightily in their
States; As also, for that discontent which their cruel impositions,
extortions, and oppressions have bred in their own subjects, who wish rather,
that all Italy were reduced into the hands of some one natural potentate,
whose greediness, how great soever, they were able to satisfy, And of the
Popes above all men, who promises much lenity by his late example at Ferrara,
where he remitted many imposts which their late Dukes had raised, than to be
thus daily racked and devoured by so many petty Tyrants, as it were with their
prowling Gabil^ieres, whose ambitions and emulations, whose prides and
pleasures, thirteen millions of yearly revenew which Italy now yields
them, is not able to satisfy; though I say for these causes the Princes and
States of Italy no way favor the Popes strength in his temporality at home,
considering vvithall, what swelling and turbulent spirits mount sometimes into
that Chair, have purposely set Italy on a flaming, for that in the sacking of
many, themselves might get somewhat for the advancing of such as nature and
blood did cause them to love best; yet on the contrary side, for his
spiritual power and soveraigntie abroad, they vvish it vpheld and restored (if
it were possible) both for the honor of their nation (which is thereby their
triumphant Queen of the world) and much more for the commodity, which by
vicinitie they and theirs reap thence in more abundance than all other
together, what by sharings, as occasion serves, in his booties abroad, what
by being always in sight to receive favors at home, what by that which
sticks to them in very passing through their Territories.

Then to exclude any innovation, the care of their own safety, and not quiet
alone* persuades them, it being dangerous in a body so full of diseases and
discontented humors to change or stir any thing, seeing all alteration sets
humors on working, and one humor on foot, quickneth up all other, what allured
by Sympathy, what by Antipathie provoked, the end thereof is, either the
dissolving of Nature by length of conflictes, or the disburthening of Nature,
by expelling that which before did oppress it. For this cause no audience to
be given to the reformation, as enemy to their peace, which is the Nurse of
their riches, and sole Anchor to their safety. For it were but simplicity to
think that conscience and love of truth did sway the deliberation, the World
having in most places done Religion this honor, as to remoove it out of those
secret dark Cabinets of the heart, where the jealousy of some devout dreams
of the Gardens of Paradise had imprisoned it, and advaunced it unto the fairest
sight and show of the whole world, even for to make a mask of it, or rather, a
very vizar, with mouth, eyes, and nose, very fairly painted and proportioned
to all pretenses and purposes. And others yet of more gallant and free spirit,
have given it general passage, to go whither it self lists, so that it
come not near them: It does much grieve me to speak, yea the very thought of
it must needs bring horror and detestation, what a huge multitude of Atheistes
do brave it in all places, and there most, where the Papacy is most in his
prime: What renouncers of God, blasphemers of his only begotten Son,
vilanisers of his Saints, and scorners of his service, who do think it a
glorious grace to adore a King of a Country; But to name or to think
reverently of the Creator of the World, to proceed from a timorous
base-mindednesse, and abiectnesse. Of so deep reach and judgment, are these
pedlers in their proportions, who do know no other Magistrates, but those of
their parishes. These men are favorable alike to all Religions, but can best
endure that wherein they are least checked, and may range with most impunity.

But for the Souldiarie of this age, a profession and an exercise, reputed in
old time for an only School of Virtue, but now defamed with all manner of
vice and villainy: in old time such, That the wisest Philosophers thought it
reason sufficient, why the Lacedaemonians were more virtuous than other Nations,
because they followed the wars, (at this day a cause of clean contrary
effect) those desperate Atheismes, those Spanish renouncings, and Italian
blasphemings, have now so prevayled in our Christian Cu^pes, that if any
restrain them, he shall be vpbraided as no soldier, nor gallant-minded
man, that the very Turks have the Christians blaspheaming of Christ in
execration, and will punish their prisoners sorely, whenas through impatience
or desperateness they burst into them. Yea the Jews in their speculations of
the causes of the strange successes of the affairs of the world, assign the
reason of the Turks prevailing so against the Christians, to be their
blasphemies and blaspheamous oaths, which wound the ears of the very heavens,
ann cry unto the high Throane of Justice for speedy vengeance. As for Princes
and great persons, it is a rare thing, and surely an happy, wheresoever it
falls out of them, that any of them has any extraordinary store of
religiousnesse of any sort. Their example (I do speak of many of them) which
might be the sovereign restorers of virtue, and reestablishers of a happy
world, with the endless bliss^ of many millions, now perishing through their
default, is at this day the only ruin and despair of goodness, having
forgo^ten whose Lievetenants they are in the world, for what end they are
placed, for what cause they are honored; and most of all, what great account
they have to pass at the last Audit, when their favorites and fancy- feeding
flatterers shall all shrink from them, and nothing but their own deeds and
deserts accompany them. But all of these, whether Atheistes in opinion or
conversation (between whom is small choice) being reckoned or let pass to
make up the number; yet hold I that from Italy there are more wishes tha^
other helps, to maintain the Papacy abroad, by reason of the partition of it
in such a multitude of States, where the greater do nothing but Lymbick their
brains in the art of Alchumie, and ballancing* to enrich themselves: by the
one, drawing gold out of all things, and by the other, to poyse their
neighbors, and to keep them of equal weight, their adding some help with their
hand where the scales are lighter, and the lesser States fly most to the
protection of the chief, as the cities of Genovay and Luca, the duke of
Urbin, the seignior of Prombino, with certain other, who all recognizing the
king of Spain for their Patron, as casting by him to be sufficiently secure
from the encroachments of those other three. And counting that from him the
united consent of all the rest, will still preserve them to whom his
greatness is fearful, and his growing would be pernicious. There have been
of them also, as the last Duke of Ferrara, who has entertained both amity and
straight intelligence, with sundry of the Protestant Princes of Germany, upon
purpose to hold their neighbors, and especially the Pope in, and off calling
the Protestants to their succor, if they should either assail, or otherwise
provoke them. And thus much for Italy.

44* The next is Spain, reputed wholly the Popes also, as having been long
time governed by the most devoted King, and longer curbed by the most cruel
Inquisition that ever the world had, for the upholding of that way, how be it
the State of Spain is not to be passed so lightly over, wherein (although my
self have never been) yet by manifold inquiry and information from some of
their own and others, who have been in it, men of knowledge and credit. Thus
much do I conceive as touching the state of their religion: that of a Nation
that aims so apparently at the Monarchy of the whole west, it is at this day
none of the most puissant to atchieve the same, their Country being so
generally exhaust of men, what eaten up by long war, what transported into
their huge number of Indian Collonies, that their Cities remain now wholly
peopled with women, having some old men among them, and many young children,
whereof the grave attends the one, and foreign service the other: a fit state
for an Amasonian Empire to be revived in. So likewise for a Kingdom that has
the surname of Catholic, none in greater danger in the world, either wholly, or
in great part, to cast off Christianity, unless grace from above, and better
wisdom do stay the increase of those pesti^ent ranks of Mahometisme, and
Iudaisme, which threaten the final decay and eating out of Christianisme. And
to carry this matter with an indifferent course of repose, neither aggravating
so much as some do in their doubts and iealousies, nor yet extenuating it so
much as othersome in their confidence and iollitie, seeing fear casts beyond
lightly, and hope short of the very danger.

There is in Spain a sort of people of the Mauran^, (as Ma^^^mi.
they term them) who are baptized Jews and Moors: and many of them in
secret, with all circumcised Christians, who are spread over the whole land,
but swarm most in the South parts confining with Africa, and are in such
store, as in many places (as some say) they exceed the true Christians by no
small proportion. For as for the Inquisition, which was instituted of purpose
against those mungrell Christians, some hundred years sithence, at what time
King Ferdinande, by chasing the Jews and Moors, and Arabians, out of the
Realms of Spain, merited the name of King Catholic: great numbers of them
chose rather to make change of their religion in show, then of their Country in
deed, and consented to receive baptism, which in secret they polluted, or
denounced by circumcision, or other superstitions, wherein the Arabians and
Moors concurred with the Jews, and so continued with a false face and double
heart, and have transmitted both the one, and the other to their offspring to
this very day. This Inquisition being first brought in to chastise these
miscreants, and received in Aragon, (a freer State then the rest) for term of
eighty years: (besides that, it is theirs in right, long since expired and
holds only by title of the Kings pleasure and possession: And the Portugalles
have now again renewed their old suite, together with their old offer of
eighty thousand crowns, to buy it out in their Countries for their persons,
which it is thought this young King has meaning to accept) the eye and edge of
it has been so wholly of late times convetted to the rooting out of their
formed religion in all places that the other sort by neglecting them, have
grown in strength, and by their strength now begin to despise their
chastisers, whom fear (they say) inforceth often to wink at many things,
which no eye open but needs must see. Thus fares it with gardens wherein
greater care is taken to pull up the suspected herbs, then to keep down the
apparent weeds: what further hopes this sect may have I know not. This is
clear, that a great part of the Spanish Nobility is mixed at this day with
Jewish blood; they which say least and speak favorably for the honor of
Spain, will say, their are of them a hundred thousand families, in which at
the least are a hundred thousand men able to bear arms, All which though
conforming themselves in some sort and outward show to the Christian re
ligion, yet are thought in heart to be utterly adverse from it, and to retain
an inward desire to return to that superstition from which their ancestors by
rigor and terror were departed.

And the Jews will say in Italy, that there come diverse Spaniards to them to
be circumcised there, and so away to Constantinople: to plant in the East. The
State of Spain is in often fear of those men's rebelling, and specially that
they would join with any enemies that would invade them. For although they are
forbidden to have any arms, and yearly search made for it over all Spain, in
an unknown and least suspected instant, yet is there no doubt but armed they
are, and have their secret caves and devises to conceal them. This sort
continually growing by living quietly at home, and the other part decaying
daily by foreign employment, what the issue may be, though reason may
probably conjecture, yet time only and proof can give assurance, by marrying
of their younger brethren with the Jews, for wealths sake, upon whom in time,
the elder failing, the honor and house has descended. But to leave these
Maurani, another pestilent sect there was not long since, of Illuminati in
Aragon, whose founders were a hypocritical crew of their Priests, who
affecting in themselves and their followers, a certain angelical purity fell
suddenly to the very counterpoint of justifying bestialitie. But these men and
their light are quenched some while since. The last and obscurest sort, are the
poor persecuted Protestants, against whom, all laws, and wits, all fortunes
are strongly bent: all which notwithstanding, there are thought to be no fewer
then twenty thousand in Civil it self, who in heart are that way: amongst
whom, certain books of their religion being secretly dispearsed, the
Inquisitors for their number sake, who were to be touched, were required to
forbear, and to provide some other way. In sum, I have heard some of their
own Country and religion acknowledge, that among other things, the scandals
of their Clergy, and Friars, especially in forging miracles in their spirits
and images, does draw the people to loathing and suspicion of their way. And
were it not for the Inquisition, it is thought generally they would fall away,
and turn Protestants in short time. They have in Spain (as is told me) a
Crucifixe, whose hair and nails fall agrowing now in this old age, as in a
dead man executed, the rest not stirring: at which, the devout men of the
Clergy girke up their eyes, and the wiser of the laity wagge easily their
heads. The holy Nun of Portugal, of whom the Spaniards taken prisoners in
1588. made so much talking of, who had the five wounds bleeding on her, and the
print of the crucifixe in the skin of her breast, to whom that invincible
Army repaired for benediction to set forward their victory, is lately
discovered and condemned for a Sorceresse, by a general complaint of that
whole sisterhood, who hating her for her arrogance, and watching her fingers,
in fine, discovered, that the one was but a forced rawnesse of the flesh,
caused by fret^ing herbs and waters, when she went to show her self; and the
other came by a continual binding of a little graven crucifixe to that part
which was so printed. The famous Lady Guadalupa, who transporteth through the
air such prisoners in Africa as vow themselves to her, is said by some to
have her credit impaired, by occasion of a fugitive servant, who being run
from his Master, was suborned by the Friars to play that flying part,
complaining that our Lady for the wickedness of this age, did restrain those
graces, but yet that it was a godly act to maintain men in their devotions. In
fine, he was disclosed and seized on by his Master. But this is more certain
and of more general report, that for the weeping and sweeting of their images,
they have had a trick in all places to boar holes behind them, and put to
them the new cut sprigges of a vine, which being of a bleeding nature, and
dropping easily through the thin plaster, remaining vnpiersed, make show of
tears or sweat, as they list; yea, some of their Italian Friars have
confessed withal, that their fashion is when their Gimmalls are all in tune,
for a miracle to enjoin some seely old woman in her confessions, to say her
devotions before the Altar, where the Image prepared to play a miracle does
stand, abusing the weakness of her sex and age, to report that confidently
which her pronnes to think our Lady might extraordinarily love her, made her
easily believe. Wise Gentlemen that have been at the exorcising of spirits,
have observed plain arguments of intelligence between the parties as in
actors of Interlude, though this should away: and so were heard to avouch the
multitude of the Indemoniati in Italy, (whereof most are women) being so huge,
even as of witches in Savoy, of which some are daily cured in show by their
Exorcismes: but for one that is helped, twenty is either past their curing, or
otherwise, as in counterfaits unwilling to be cured. In sum, the falsehoods in
all these kinds are grown so so ordinary and palpable to themselves, that
some of their better Prelates have caused an Image of our Lady to be taken
away off his place, upon the broaching of a report, that it discovered it self
for a wonder-worker. So unsavory is the food of fools, to the taste of wise
men; and such is Gods curse upon all forgery and falsehood, as in the end, to
overthrow that which chooses it for his foundation, as has happened already
in some places. and may with time in other.

45 Touch Germany, I have seen an old estimate Germany.
of it by such as favored the Papacy, that in the beginning of Ferdinand,
there was not past one twelfth part remaining Catholic, which now in my
understanding must needs be otherwise. For comprehending in it Bohemi^ with
his appurtenances, I should think that near a sixth part were devoted that
way, their number being increased, and perhaps doubled since that time, by the
sedulitie of many of the Prelates and other great Princes. The Dukes of
Bavaria, who using the advantage of the Interim on their part, have forced
those Protestants which were in their States to quitt, either Religion or
goods and Country. The same has been attempted by the Arch Duke of Austria,
and in some places, as in their Country of Firoll effected. But in Austria it
self not so, wherein the number of Protestants exceedes and is fearful to
their opposites, though the public exercies of their religion is restrained in
some of the chief Cities, as in vienna; but the most part of the country are
of it, so are half the nobility. The Duke of Cleves a third Prince, affected
the same way, has showed himself a little more moderate then some other, so
advised by neighborhood. The free Cities which are of very great number and
strength, have all (save some very few) freede themselves from the Pope either
in whole, or in greater part: the State of the Empire for that point,
containing in it a very huge circuit of territoryes, full of mighty Princes,
and well fortified cities: that if it were more strictly united under one
Monarchy, and not rent into factions with diversity of religions, breeding
endless iealosies, heart burnings, and hatreds, it needs not other help to
affront the great Turk, and to repulse his forces to the security of
Christendom.

But in this so unequal proportion of adherents to the Papacy, two things
there are which gives them hope of better, if prosperous success do second
their well contrived proiects. The one is the creating the Emperor always of
their own party, whereof they assure themselves by these considerations; First
the^ is no house in Germany at this day, of that infinite greatness as is
requisite to withstand the Turk in his encroachments, the house of Austria set
aside, who by their alliance, or rather near entireness with Spain, and
sundry elective Kingdoms which run necessarily upon them, shall be always
able to make head against any power in the world. And by their own state,
confining so immediately with the Turks, shall be necessarily enforced to employ
the uttermost drop of their blood to keep them off: next, whenever the
matter grows to the Election one of another new Emperor, they shall always
have the casting voice with them or rather in them, having entangled the States
of Bohemia in such bonds, and promises. Besides, there is no other whom they
may make choice of, that they may make no other account of it, then as being
half hereditarie. And lastly, their late policy now strengthened, by usage
of declaring a King of Romans in the Emperors life time, whilst his presence
and power may govern the action, do assure them, it shall always pass with
them roundly and quietly.

The other ground of their hope, is the division of the Protestants into their
factions of Lutherans and Calvenist^, as they style them, wherein the Ministers
of each side, have so bestirred themselves, that a coal which a wise man with
a little moisture of his mouth would soon have quen^hed, they with the wind
of others have contrariwise so enflamed, that it threatens a great ruin and
calamity on both sides. And though the Princes and heads of the weaker sides
in those parts, both Palgrave, and Lansgrave, have with great wisdom and
judgment, (to asslake those flames) imposed silence in that point to the
Ministers of the one party, hoping the charity and discretion of the other
sort would have done the like: yet it falls out otherwise, the Lutherane
Preachers rage hitherto in their Pulpets against the other as much as ever, and
their Princes and people have them in as great detestation, not forbearing to
profess openly, they will return to the Papacy, rather then ever admit that
Sacramentarie and Predestinarie pestilence. For these two points are the
ground of the quarrel, and the latter more scandalous at this day then the
former. And some one of their Princes, namely, the Administratour of Saxony,
is strongly misdoubted to practice with the Emperor, for the joining of the
Catholic and Lutherane sect in one, and by war to root out and extinguish the
Calvinists, the most plausible motion of the Emperor that ever could happen.
Neither is there any great doubt, but if any stay and agreement could be taken
with the Turk, all Germany were in danger to be in vproare within it self, by
intestine discention: howbeit, all the Lutherans are not carried with this
stern humor: but they only which are called Lutherani rigidi, the greater
part, which are perhaps the Molles Lutherani, are quiet enough. Neither account
they otherwise of the Calvinists, then as of erring brethren, whom the Rigidi
have (as is said) threatened to excommunicate as Schismatiques and Heretics.

To this lamentable extremity has the headiness of their Ministers on both
sides brought it, whilst in the peremptorinesse of their poor learning, they
cannot endure any supposed error in their brethren, whereof themselves, even
the best of them perhaps (if they were well sifted) would be found to be full
enough: (such take I to be the condition of all men of this world, that in
their ignorance of all actions, save of their Schools and books) make more
account of some ill shaped Sillogisme, then of the peace of the Church, and
happiness of the world, the end whereof will be, that their enemies shall
laugh when themselves shall have cause to weep, unless the gratiousnesse of
God stir up some worthy Princes of renown and reputation, with both sides to
enterpose their wisdom, industry, and authority, for the uniting of these
factions, or at leastwise, for reconciling and composing those differences in
some tolerable sort. A work of immortal fame and desert, and worthy of none
but them, of whom this wicked base world is not worthy. But hereof I shall
have occasion to speak in his due place; for this place it suffiseth, that
these intrinsicall quarrels, are the hopes which make their enemies hold up
their heads, and quickneth their expectations to see the blades of these
reformers drawn one against another, that themselves being called to the
beating down of the one party, may afterward in good time assail the other.
In the mean season, planting in all places their Colleges of Jesuits, as the
only corrasive medicine to fret out their adversaries: Now on the other part,
the hopes are also not few: besides, their over-topping of them so much in
multitude and power.

First the Germans bearing a natural stiff hate to the Hopes of the
Protestants.
Italians for his winding and subtle wit, (which dispiseth and would ransacke
him, but that he opposes a proud stoutnesse, and intractable obstinacy,
which serves always as a wall of defense to simplicity) will hardly (what
tempering soever the Princes make) be brought ever to reaffect the Papacy,
whose sleights and devises they are thoroughly acquainted with, and have in more
detestation, than any Nation whatsoever. And for their own inward
dissentions, it is to be hoped, that though no courses were taken to compound
them, yet never will they be so mad, as to decide them by a general open
war, having on both sides, the Turk, Pope, and Emperor to join them in
friendship. For although the contention of brethren be bitterest, yet a
common strong enemy always makes them friends again. And as for the
Administrator so much suspected, who prowles, as some say, in the practices for
his own greatness) his authority is but short, and expireth within three
years.

Then for having an Emperor of some more indifferent family, though their
desire be in that point of all other greatest, yet their hope is (as I
suppose) least* and that which is, seems to be grounded upon Electors of
Collen, either if the old Elector Gerardu^ Thrachesius should live so long,
whom in that case they might by force restore to his place from which he
stands now by force rejected, yet retains his claim still, and style of
Elector. Or if some other of that See, might be induced to follow the steps of
two of their ancestors, who have turned Protestants, of which cause that place
will be always in danger, by reason of such vicinitie and intermixing of their
state with Protestant Princes. Besides, in Collen it self the religion has
already sooting, or at the leastwise might be drawn to that civil
indifferency, as in preserving their freedom of election, to change once in
an age that family of Austria wherein the Empire having continued these seven
discents, may in time be established by prescription. And lastly, for the
Jesuits their great Patron and planter, the old Duke of Bavaria, having now
retired himself into their College, and resigned his state to his Son
Maximilian, who it is thought does disfavour them, as much as his father doted
on them. These and other such chaunges may give stay to their proceedings. But
to leave these hopeful speculations on both sides; and to take matters in
terms they stand now, and may so continue. The benefit which the Papacy may
expect from the Empire, is rather to keep matters in that stay they are, then
any way to restore it where it has been disposed. For although the Turkish
wars should cease, which is not unlikely, considering the calm nature of
both Emperors, who take more delight in Chambers then fields, yet shall our
Christian Emperor be enforced still in fortifiing and mainteyning Garrison all
along his Frontires and confines, so to exhaust his own treasure, and employ
his people; so that he will not be able to do elsewhere any extraordinary
matter, without help extraordinary, which is never over-readie. And time
which may prodvce many accidents in his favor, may also produce in his
disfavour as many. And by so many the more, as the ground out of which in those
parts they may grow, is manifoldly larger against him then for him.

Now for the low Contreys, the Papacy has two thirdes with it, and of the
Switzers and Grisons, two thirds, against it also. The Protestants are lightly
the wealthier, the low Cuntries switzers and Grysons
and the Papists more warre-like which may sufffice for those parts of France;
how much the better is it known unto us at home, so much the less shall I
need to speak much in this place. Neither is it very easy to proportion the
parties, by reason they of the Religion are so scattered in all places; yet in
Poicton almost all, in Gasconie an half; in Languedocke, Normandy, and other
West Maritine Provinces, a reasonable strong part, as likewise in sundry
mediterrane parts. But whatsoever is the proportion of the number to their
opposites (which is manifoldly inferior, not one to twenty,) their strength is
such, as the wars have witnessed. And specially at this day, notwithstanding
such massacring them, so general arising of the whole realm against them, by
the uttermost extremity of fire and sword, to exterminate them, they are
esteemed to be stronger than at any time heretofore. In sum, so strong, that
neither have their adversaries any great hope to win, and themselves not in
fear to be borne down by wars; that their practice of peace (which has
sorely already bitten and afflicte their states) by depriving them of place,
of office, and honor in the realm, confining the exercise of their religion
into chambers and remote corners, did not impoverish, debase, and dis harten
the party, and so withdraw those from them that otherwise would stick to
them. That is it which they misdoubted, and by the Edict now past and verified,
have sought to remedy. But looking more attentively into this party, I find,
that as conscience, in what religion soever does even in the mists of error,
breed an honestnesse of mind, and integrity of life and actions in whom it
settleth: So divine and pure virtue, as the love of the Creator. which is the
ground of all that merit the name of Religious; so also, that in them that
affect the greatness singleness and in a manner, a very careless
simplicity in their Religion, as contenting themselves with the possession of
the rich treasure of truth, and for the preserving of it, or themselves,
recommending those cares to God only, yet tract of afflictions, much miseries,
often overreaching by subtlety of adversaries, does finally purge out those
gross witted humors, and does engender a very curious and advantageous
warines in all their proceedings, having learned by experience, the wisdom of
the Aphorisine: That a small error in the foundation and beginning of all
things, does prove in the proceeding and end of them, a great mischief, as
has fallen out in their men, who do as far herein out go their opposites,
in all civil policies, as in other places they of the Religion are lightly
outgone by them, which next unto divine blessing which accompanies good
causes, where wickedness or wilful witlesnesse does not bar against it, I
account their chief reason of their present strength and assurance, by their
providence in their capitulations, by their resolutions in their executions, by
their industry, and dexterity in all occasions presented, they have possessed
themselves of an exceeding great number of strong towns or places, there is
scant any office or estate can fall void, but that they lay in by all means to
get into it. They have Synods for their Church affairs, their conventions and
counsels for their civil, their people is warlike* for leaders (a matter of
maine importance,) they are above their adversaries, having besides those three
of principal and known name, other in Gasconie of less place and degree, but
in skill and valor not inferior to the best. In fine, they have learned the
wisdom of Spes sibi quisque, etc. the contrary whereof before, brought them
so near to their ruin. But now touching the weakness of them of the Roman
Religion, in comparison of that strength which their multitude should promise,
much more may be said. First one great part of them are in heart with the
reformed Religion, though for worldly respects they hold in with the other:
also will begin to disclose themselves daily, those things being not settled in
reasonable sort, which have hitherto been but in motion: Secondly, they are
not all Papists that hold with the Mass; but the Catholics are here divided
into as different opinions, and in as principal matters as the Protestants in
any place that ever I heard of, although their discretion and moderation is
such, as not to interrupt the common concord with private opinions.

The ground of which disagreements in opinion (as I do take it) is the ancient
diversity between the Roman Church and the Gallicane, which in many ceremonies
differs much from the Roman Church, as (to omit sundry other) in the priests
Lotions at the Mass, and in their walking hymmes at Vespers, and in some of
them rather runs with the usage of the Greek Church (as in their holy bread on
Sundays for them that do not communicate) so also in the very head point of
their ecclesiastical government, it holds the general Council to be above
the Pope, which opinion is at this day very current and strong, even among such
Catholics as favor the Papacy, which I reckon for the first difference
touching the estate of the Church, which calls into question, in whom the
very Soveraigntie and Supremacy thereof is placed. An other sort are there
which hold their Church to be the true Church, although they acknowledge sundry
errors of abuses of less importance, both in doctrine and practice. But for
the the Pope they hold resolutely, that he is that Antichrist, which sitting in
the Temple (that is in the true Church of God, for even by his very being
Antichrist, some prove they are the true Church (does advance himself above
God, as they think apparent by his dispensing with the law of God, by the
marchandizing of souls, in his purgatory pardons, releasing them in an other
world; whom divine sentence has bound, as also by his Indulgences for great
sums of money in this world. And not least of all by his arrogating the
impossibility of erring, being a property peculiar unto God, and not
communicated, but only at times to the extraordinary Prophets, as all Churches
in the world besides the Roman acknowledge. This sort spreads far, and as
themselves will say of the learned sort, three parts of four consent in this
opinion. And they which are most devoted to the Pope, that in that respect do
hate this realm above all other, confess that Lawyers are greatly infected;
in which regard also some, term these the Parliament Catholics. The opinions
thus prevailing among the Catholics of France, it is not to be marvelled,
France.
that the realm was so ready upon the Popes refusal to re-blesse the king
upon conversion to them, to withdraw utterly from the obedience of his Sea, and
to erect a new Patriarch over all the French Church. The now Archbishop of
Burges, who was ready to accept it; and but that the Pope in fear thereof did
hasten his benedictionit had been effected, to his utter disgrace and decay:
As the proffer and probability thereof will hold him in awe, and in good
temper of carriage to his kingdom, and content to bear indifferent sway with
them in any things; as on the contrary side, his great doubt of the French
unsoundness to him at the heart, will cause him the less to favor any of
their footings in Italy.

Now these men, though they dislike also of the reformed religion, as having
brought in an extreme innovation of all things, in stead of a moderate
reformation of what was justly blameable, yet will carry themselves always in
likelihood in an indifferent neutralitie, rather than by extinguishing the one
extreme to overstrengthen the other. A third part of this side we may make the
Royalists, who as much as they dislike the attempts of the Protestants in
alteration of religion, so much and more do they hate those mischevous courses
taken by their adversaries against them, which have threatened so near ruin
to the whole state of the kingdom, that it may show half a miracle that it
has ever recovered, being so long a time at the very point, either of
shivering in pieces, (as has happened heretofore in other countries in like
case,) or of rendering it self into the servitude of that hateful name of
their neighbors. This part having by experience learned the wisdom to know,
that the quarrel of religion is but a cloak of ambition for the great ones. At
this day many Traitors intents pass under catholic pretenses; that the
Protestants will be always a sure enemine to the Spanyard; and to all his
favorites, partisans, and pensionaries: that whilst he may be suffered to
enjoy liberty of conscience, without any disabling or disgrace in the state, he
will be in all occasions ready to serve the King to his utmost, and forward by
deserts to maintain his favor; that it is not so easy a matter to extirpate
them, as some think, having so deep root in the realm as they have, besides
the favor of so many great princes their neighbors abroad, who are engaged
and embarked in the same very cause. And that although it were to be wished for
the happiness of the kingdom (which during this diversity and dissension in
religion shall breed greater security to their neighbors than to themselves;)
that if it were possible, some course were taken for a final reuniting of all
into one profession, yet this being not to he hoped for in this exasperation of
minds on both sides, must be commended to time, which works out many
things, which effects even wonders, on a sudden. And finally, to some
general good way to be taken by the joint consent of wise and worthy princes
for effecting like unity over all Christendom, if it may be: In these
considerations, this part, which with his appurtenances is now the greatest,
will never advise the King to become head of a party again, so long as he
may be absolute co^ma^der of the whole having found the sidening course in
such strength of both partts to be a false ground ruinous to them that take it.
To these may be annexed those moral me^ (as they call them) who think not these
diversities of opinions of any such moment, as that they ought to disioyn the^
who in the love of God, in the belief of the fundamental Articles of Christian
faith, in integrity and honesty of conversation, (which are the greatest
bonds) remain united, much less that they ought to enrage men's minds so
far, as to cause them to take arms to decide the quarrel, which are not those
Instruments wherewith either error should be razed, or ^ueth or religion
planted. And finally, to this part may be added all those who affect a quiet
world and peace above all things, which is the desire of those lightly, who in
a middle degree of condition possess also a moderate temper of affections,
which is ordinarily the greatest part in all well ordered commonwealths. And
withal, far surest and firmest to the state. None of these will be easily
drawn to enter into any violent course against those of the reformed religion,
so long as they have discretion, by no jealousy to provoke them. The last
part is indeed of the vowed and sworn enemies the Leaguers and rebels (as
some name them) once the greatest and most favored part of the realm, at this
day not so; their plausible pretenses being now dismasked, and their disastrous
success in their disorderly actions, which has brought things to the very
counterpoint of that they aimed at, and left nothing but a memory of much
trouble and misery, with the wasting of the people, the sacking of Cities, the
harrowing and desolating of the Country, with imminent danger of utter
overthrowe for ever of the realm, making them hateful and despised in those
very same minds, wherein they were erstwhiles inshrined with all dovotion, which
reasons have so abated also the haughtiness of their hopeles heads, who lately
breathed nothing but Crowns and Scepters, but glory to their followers, and
have turned their song of Soveraignety to a more peaceable and calm tune of,
Nec veterum memini L^torve malorum, howbeit right zealous men of the baser
sort, lighty possessed with ^riars, who fill them with furies against their
religion, are as malicious and ragefull against the Protestants as ever; and
thirst after nothing so much as to imbrew themselves once again in their
blood, which they stick not to profess, and indede, had they heads and
opportunities, would accomplish.

46 The number of these is very great and desperate, but impuissant, base,
and broken, with these in heart join in a manner all the Clergy, who count
their religion and reformation their bane, and the very calamity of their
estate for ever. Agreat error among other (as was observed by the worthy
Chancellor Mounsier W. L. Hospital) in the plottes and procedings of the
first Protestants of France, to alienate so respected and potent a part of the
Realm, by leaving them no hope of any tolerable condition, under the reformed
state who^ by following the wiser courses of their moderate neighbors they
might have gained to them in greatest part as others did Now this part which
are the only assured enemies of the Protestants, and of whom they make account
that they will not fail them at a need does come short of them perhaps in
strength, though in multitude they far exceed them, whereas this is also not
to be least considered that as in the body of a man the humors draw still to
the sore; so in a state, all adverse and discontented persons do associat
themselves lightly to the part grieved and persecuted. This take I to be the
present estate of the factions in France: For matters of Religion submitting
my opinion (as in all other things) to be censured and reformed by whomsoever
with more experience and deeper judgment shall have waded in and weighed these
considerations. But to make any far reach or coniectnre for the time to come,
that will not I be so saweie as to do in French affairs, whose Minds are so
full of Quick silver that the ^imble wits would take it, perhaps in
dudg^o^, that any should presume to amagine they would plod on, in any tenor
with that dull constance which their hevier mettald neighbors do use,
beingable even in fresh experience to boast, that their lightness of spirit
and mutabilitie of resolutions, have suddenly recovered them from these terms
of extremities which in the hands of any constant nation in the world, had
been a very long cure, if not desperate and curelesse. But verily this
dissension and diversity in Religion, is still a very great weakness and
disease in their estate, and such as will be always a matter of jealousy
amongst themselves, of assurance of their neighbors; of joy to their enemies:
For Loraine, and Savoy, with the Vallesi who confine on Savoy, they run wholly
in a manner with the stream of the Papacy, though in both parts there be store
of Protestants, and that the men of the better sort, but without any public
show of their Religion, save only in some out Shyres of Savoy near Berne,
and Ceneva What Madam the Kings sister may effect in Loraine or contrariwayes,
her self may suffer, time only by trial is able to ascertaine. These
perticulars thus admitted, it will be to great diffcultie to make some
co^paratiue estimate of the whole strengh of the Papacy, in respect of the
Priests, being the part now only on foot against them. For as for the greek
Church, the case is evident, that though it be granted, that they exceed any
other, yet are they so oppressed under Turkish tyranny, or removed so far
off, (as the Moscovite, and some others) that they come not into any account in
the surveigh of the strength which now we speak of. But for Western and
Latin Churches in the general division into the part reformed, and part
Papal admiting them in number and circuit of territories to be near equal
As considering the huge com-passe of Germany, an Empire possessed so wholly in
a manner by the Protestants, I can make no other exposition. In other points
we shall find great odds and advantage, for strength indifferent, kind on
both sides; First, the kingdoms and States of the Romish part, lying nearer
the Sun, are not only in riches, both natural of their soil, and
accessorie, by great opportunity of traffic to all parts of the World, by
manifold degrees superior to their Northren adversaries but also in a
finenesse and subtlety of wit, which having that other instrument of wealth to
work by, does far pass in all ordinary and orderly actions. That
robustiousnesse of body, and puissance of person, which is the only fruit of
strength, that those colder climates do yield, though sometimes
extraordinarily, it is known and to be granted, that those Septentrionall
inundations by their very violence and multitude, as in people more
generative, have so wholly diluviated over all the South, that as a raging
tempest, they have ruined those powerful and flourishing Empyres, in the
suddenness of an instant, which had been many ages in rearing and spreading
it self over the world.

37 But these have been no other than currentes, or brooks of passage, soon
up, soon down, soon come, soon over-gone; neither have the Northern people
ever yet for all their multitude and strength, had the honor of being founders
or possessors of any great Empire, so unequal is the combat between force,
and wit, in all matters of durable and grounded establishment. An other point
of great advantage ^n the self same side is the uniting of their forces into
four heads, which uniting is a very redoubling of strength in all things,
they have on either parts, first and principally the Pope himself seated
royally and pontifically in the midst: and chiefest regarding the rich Sun
in hie glorious rising, and the Moon^ in the height of her beautiful walk, on
his left hand, the Emperor. The ancient Romans of honor, on his right hand:
The King of Spain, the new planet on the West, at his back the French King,
the eldest Son of the Church, mighty Monarchs, opposed as brazen walls
against his enemies on all sides about him: And the lesser Prince and States of
Italy, as matter rather of solace and honor then otherwise, and to exercise
himself as his humors of favors or displeasure shall advise, whereas on the
contrary part the only puissant Prince, in any comparison with those other,
is her Majesty of England, whose State is so divided from all the rest of the
world, that it is the less fit in that respect for the rest to make head at.
The other have the Pope as a common father, adviser, and conducter to them all,
to reconcile their iarres, to appease their displeasures, to decide their
difference, and finally, to unite their endeavors in one course, to instance,
to press them, to remoove stops, to add encouragement by aid from himself
above all things, to draw their religions by consent of Counsels, to an unity,
or likeness and conformity. In all places a principal pillar or stay to the
unlearned multitude, of glory to themselves, of vpbraidings to their enemies:
whereas on the contrary side, the Protestants as severed bands, or rather
scattered troops, each drawing adverse away, without any means to pacify
their quarrels, to take up their controversies without any bond to knit their
forces or courses in one: No Prince, with any pre-eminence of jurisdiction
above the rest; no Patriarch, one, or more, to have a common superintendance,
or care of their Churches for correspondencie and unity, no ordinary way to
assemble a general Council of their part, the only hope remaining ever to
assuage their contentions, and the only desire of the wisest and best minds
amongst them. Every Church almost of theirs, has his several form and frame
of government, his several Lyturgy and fashion of service. And lastly, some
several opinion from the rest, which though in themselves they be matters of
no great moment, being no differences essential, or in any part capital, yet
have they been, are, and will be as long as they continue, causes of dislikes,
of iealosies, of quarrels, and of danger.

In sum, what unity soever is amongst them proceeds only from the mere
force and virtue of verity which all persons seek for, which, though it be
incomparably the best and blessedest, and which alone does unite the soul with
God; yet for order in the world, for quiet in the church, for avoiding of
scandal, for propagating and increase, of what great power that other unity
is which proceeds from authority, the Papacy which stands by it alone may
teach us. These then are the advantages on the part of the Papacy. But now
one disadvantage (such is the nature of all things) impeacheth and diverteth
all other their forces, and that is their vicinity with their grand enemy the
Turk, who by land and Sea presses hard both upon the Emperor, Pope, and
the Monarchy of Spain, and drives then oftentimes to such ecstasies of
devises, that Spain has no other shifts to clear himself, than by diverting
him upon his own dear brethren of Austria, and causing him to sall foul
upon his friend the Emperor, wherein he is driven yet to a twofolde charge,
both in bribing the Bas shawes, to draw their Lord into Germany, and in
supporting their Emperor with money to withstand him. The Emperor on the other
side calls the Protestants for his aid, without whom the whole Empire were
in danger to wreking: The Pope, who of all other is in deepest fear, though
not yet in the nearest, knowing that the final mark that the Turk shoots
at, is Italy, as thinking that to be the banner now only remaining to be
set up for the accomplishment and the perfection of his Empire. And that the
wars with the Emperor, are but to open that land passage, forasmuch as by
Sea he has always prooved the weaker, bestirres himself on all sides in the
best sort he is able, both in sending such aid as his proportion will bear and
especially in soliciting of the Princes of his part to enter into a common
league, and war against him, giving overture of like desire for the
Protestants also* but the Protestants would know what security and quiet they
shall have from himself first, their near and stern, and unplacable enemy,
before they waste out themselves, in giving aid unto him against a common
enemy indeed But one who is furthest off from them of all other* who as now
is desirous enough to entertain friendship, and who at the worst hand carries
no more cruel hate against them and their profession, neither condemns their
religion more than the Pope their fellow christian. Then for his Catholics
and Polakers they clearly slip collar, both for the natural hatred they bear
the Germans; and for that they are in peace and amity with the Turk, paying
a certain tribute. And although his near neighbors, yet not in his way, which
is not the North; but to the sun, and to the South parts, and mainely and
plainly to the conquest of Italy. The Venetians are content also to live
rather as free tributaries to the Turk* as they now are, than as slaves unto
Spain, who in joining with them heretofore in league against the Turk, and
Pope Pius Sixtus, did contrary to his oath and bond forsake them, and suffer
them to be beaten, being left alone to the Turks fury. And all this to the
end, that having their state utterly maimed and broken by the Turk; they might
be constrained wholly to cast themselves, their soveraignetie, and city, into
the arms and embracements of Spain for safegarde. With this unchristian
treachery have they charged him heretofore, though now all being quiet, they
are content to put an unacceptable motion to silence, by demanding of
impossible conditions of security. Then for France it is far off; and
looks that the nearer be (as they ought) more forward first, and requires
also with reason some breathing time to revive himself after his weariness by
his late pangs. Lastly, Spain has so much to do with England, and the
revoulted Provinces, that he thinks the time gained that the Turk
forbeareth him: So that in the end the whole burden must rest on the Emperor,
with that small help that Italy and some others do yield him And were it not
his good fortune, or rather, Gods good providence, that the very same plagues
that have ruined the glory and grace of Christendom, should now infect also the
grand enemy thereof, namely, Effeminatensse and Avarice, whereof the one is the
corrupter of all sound deliberations, and the other the quailer of all manly
executions, which prevailing in his estate, as they do at this day give hope
that his tyranny grows toward his period, and for the present proved so, that
a weak defendant may shift better, having no other than a cowardly assailant.
This matter would have grown to that extremity by this time, as could have
called the King of Spain with all his forces to some more honorable
enterprises than he has hitherto undertaken. And this is the bridle that
holds in the Papacy with all her followers from any universal proceeding by
force against the Protestants, who herein are greatly advantaged above them, in
that either their oposites lie between them and the Turks, or in that their
Countries coasting so much as they do toward the North are out of his way and
no part of his present aim. But those advantages and disadvantages of the
Papacy equally weighed, I suppose this disadvantage more mischievous for the
present, as procee^ding from outward force in the hands of an enemy, and the
other advantages more stable, as springing from the inward strength of their
own wealth and order.

48 This then being so, and that all things considered, there falls out, (if
not such in differencie and equality, yet at the leastwise, such a proportion
of strength upon both sides, as bereaveth the other of hope ever by wa^re to
subdue them,) seeing (as the Proverb is) A dead woman will have four to
carry her forth, much less will able men be beaten out of their homes, and
seeing their is no appearance of ever forcing an unity, unless Time, which
eats up all things, should bring in great alterations: it remains to be
considered, what other kind of unity poor Christendom may hope for, whether
unity of Verity, or unity of Charity, or unity of persuasion, or unity of
authority, or unity of Necessity, there A project of union.
being so many other kinds and causes of concord: A kind of men there are whom
a man shall meet with in all countries, not many in number, but sundry of them
of singular learning and piety, whose godly longings to see Christendom
reunited in the love of the Author of the name above all things, and annexed
in brotherly correspondencie and amity, as beseems those, who under the
chief service of one Lord, in the possession of one ground and foundation of
faith, do expect the same final reward of glory (which proceeding from the
Father and Prince of Peace, rejects all spirits of contention, from ^^taining
it) has entered into a meditation, whether it were not possible, that by the
travel and meditation of some calmer minds that at this day usually write, or
deal on either side, these flames of controversy might be extinguished or
as^aked, and some tolerable peace re-established in the Church again. The
iustnes of their virtuous desires to see it so, has bred in them an opinion of
possibility that it might be wrought, considering first, that besides infinite
other points not controuersed, there is a full agreement in the foundation of
religion, in those same Articles which the twelve Apostles delivered unto the
Church; perhaps not an abridgement only of the faith, but even as a
touchstone also of the faithful for ever: that whilst there was an entire
consent in them, no descent in other opinions should break peace and
communion. And secondly, considering also there are in great multitude on both
sides, (for so are there undoubtedly) men ^ertuous and learned, fraught with
the love of God and the truth, above all things, men of memorable integrity of
heart and affections, whose lives are not dear unto them, much less their
labors to be spent for the good of Gods Church and people, by whose joint
indevours, and single and sincere dealings in common conference for the search
of truth, that honorable unity of verity might be established. But if the
multitude of crooked and side respects, which are the only olouds that eclipse
the truth from shining more lightly on the face of the world, and the only
pricks which so enfroward men's affections, as not to consider and follow what
were for the best* do cause that this chief unity finds small acceptance,
as it is to be feared at leastwise, that the endlesnesse and ill fruits of
these contentions which tend mainely to the increase of Athenisme within, of
Mahomatisme abroad by which obstinacy the Jews shake the faith of Christians,
taint the better minds of acerbity, and load the words with poison, which
break so out in their actions, which themselves think holiest, namely, the
defense of Gods truth, which each side chalengeth; that in thinking they offer
up a pleasing sacrifice to God, they give cause of wicked joy unto his and
their enemies; that those woeful effects with very tedious weariness, may
draw both parts, in fine to some tolerable reconciliation, or to some unity of
charity: at leastwise, to some such as may be least to eithers prejudice. Let
the one side give over their worshipping of Images, and offfering supplication
to Saints, their offensive ceremonies, their indulgences, their using of
strange language not understood in their devotions; (al which themselves
confess, not to be necessary orders of the Church and such as at pleasure
she may dispense with) yea Pope Clement the seventh gave some hope to the
French king, that he would not be stiff in things of this quality, and that
the respect of time might justify the alteration; and some of the later Popes
condescended to them of Bauaria, about the cup of the Sacrament, hoping that
would have contented them, which since, they, or their successors have taken
from them again: On the other part let the Protestants (such at leastwise, as
seek to purge out that negative and contradictorie humor, of thinking they
are then rightest when they are vnlikest the Papacy; and then nearest to God
(...) furthest from Rome.) Let them, I say, look with the eye of charity upon
them, as well as of severitie, and they shall find some excellent order of
government, some singular ^elpes for increase of godliness and devotion for
the conquering of sin, for the profiting of virtue: and contrariwise, in
themselves, looking with a more single and less indulgent eye then they do,
they shall find there is no such absolute perfection in their doctrine and
reformation, as some dreamers in the pleasing view of their own actions do
fancy: Neither ought they to think it strange, they should be amiss in any
thing; but rather a very miracle, if they were not so in many; For if those
ancient Fathers and Sages of the Church, who with greater helps, being nearer
the time of purity, with equal industry, so spending their lives with less
cause of vnsinceritie, having nothing to seduce them; notwithstanding, were not
able in their weakness and blindness of their humane nature in this world,
to soar up so high always in the search of truth, as to find out her
right State in the height of the heavens, but sometimes Error to be dwelling
nearer them in steed thereof: How less likely that our age, more entangled
with the world, further remooved from those faultlesse institutions, and so
bitterly exasperated with mutual controversies and conflictes, should attain
to that excellency and perfection of knowledge, which (it may be) God has
remooved from man's reach in this world, to humble him, and to increase his
longing toward another world. And as the present time does discover sundry
errors in the former, so no doubt will the future in that which is now present:
so that ignorance and error, which seldom go severed, being no other then
inseparable companions of man, so long as he continues in his terrestrial
pilgrimage, it can be no blemish to them to revise their doctrine, and to
abate the rigor of certain speculative opinions, especially touching the
eternal decrees of God, the quality of man's nature, the use of works,
wherein some of their chief Authors have come to such an utter opposition to
the Romist doctrine, as to have exceedingly scandalized all oath Churches
withal, yea and many of their own to rest very ill satisfied. The state of
truth is aloft, that of vertve in the midst always; both places of honor,
but neither truth nor virtue draw to an utter extreamitie. And as in some
points of doctrine, so much more in their practice, in order of government and
ecclesiastical degrees, in solemnities and stateliness in the service of God,
in some exercise of piety, devotion and humility, especially in set fastings,
accompanied with due contrition of heart and prayer. Besides, in many other
ceremonies, they might easily with out offense of conscience at all, frame to
draw somewhat nearer to their opposites then now they are, which yielded on
both sides a general and indifferent confession and sum of faith, an uniform
Lyturgy, a correspondent form of Church Government to be made of the points
both should agree in, and to be established universally throughout all
Christendom, that this all Christians should necessarily hold, and this their
Divines in Pulpits should teach, and this their people in Churches should
exercise: which done, the unity of communion should remain vnviolated for all
other questions to be confined to the Schools, the Counsels, and to the
learned languages which are the proper places to try them; and it should be
lawful for each man to believe as he found cause, not condemning others with
such peremptorinesse as is the guise of some men of overweening conceits: and
all this to be done by some general counsel assembled and composed
indifferently out of both sides, m^ns minds being before hand prepared and
directed to this issue and conclusion.

But now, if either the obstinacy of the Popes ambition, or the wilfulnes or
scrupulositie of any opinionative Ministers should oppose against, and impeach
the unity of Charity; then the unity of authority to be interposed to
assist it. That is, the Princes of Christendom to press this agreement, to
constrain the Pope to content himself with that temporal state which the
skill of his ancestors have got, and left him. And for his spiritual, to be
such as the ancient Councels had limited. And for all other gainsayers to
censure or punish them. Now for the Princes with joint assent to do this, how
many have mighty motives to enduce them. The service of Christ, the honor of
Christian Religion; the peace of Christendom, the strengthening of Christians,
the repulsing and overthrow of all Turks and Infidels: and these in general.
In particular, the assuring of their own lives and persons, which so many,
under pretense of Religion daily conspire against, the quiet and secure
enjoying of their rich states, and kingdoms, the transmitting of them to their
posterity, without question or opposition. And lastly, the deliverie of their
miserable subjects (which should be dear unto them as children) from those
extreme vexations of spirit and body, and those inestimable calamities in
their states and conditions, wherewith these dissentions in Religions and
effects thereof do now afflict them. And this is in general, the sum of the
discourse of that kind of people which do show them (and they are for the
most part) Protestants though perhaps not running iump with their side in
every thing: also many of the other part, are carried with the same good zeal
and affection, to the like desire and intention. But these are of the moderate
sort of the Catholics, and not of their Clergy. And such lightly as have
but an indifferent conceit of the Popes claim and proceedings, of which sort,
amongst the wise sort of the layity, are very many. But now in exacter
consideration of this motion, there appears for the effecting of it, sundry
difficulties, so great, that they draw to be next neighbors, to so many
impossibilities, whereof I will mention only two of the chief. For as for the
thing it self, I must confess for my own part, the greatest desire I have in
this world, is to see Christendom reconciled in the badge of their profession,
and that without the ruin or subversion of either part, which cannot be done,
but to the inexpressible mischief and misery on both sides, and with the utter
inhazarding both of Christendom and Christianity, and that any peace were
better then those strifes, which did not prejudice that higher peace between
God and men's consciences: then for the way they purpose, it seems for the
generality of it, there is no other now lef^ (seeing the opposition of extremes
is no way peaceable) but by extinguishing the one, or drawing both to some more
temperate and mild estate. But in this cause, two things do clean shorten
this hope: The first is, the vntractablenesse of Papacy to it, who in so many
conferences as they have made in this age, have always ere they parted,
plainly discovered, they came not with any such intent as to yield any thing
for peace, much less for truths sake, but only to assay, either by manifold
persuasion and entreaty to reduce, or otherwise to entrap and disgrace their
adversaries. And if some one of them have showed himself more flexible at any
time, it has been his utter discredit with his own party for ever after; a
very stern proceeding of theirs, admitting the fundamental positions whereon
the Papacy is built as good as necessary. For if divine authority do concur
with them in all their ordinances, if Gods spirit assist them in all their
decisions, and all possibility of erring be exempted from their Pope and
Church, what temaines there but only that they teach we believe, they command,
and the world obey. Indeed in humane governments, where reason is shut out,
there tyranny is thrust in; but where God commands, to a ^e reason is
presumption, to oppose reason, flat te^ellion. To this miserable necessity
have their assertions tied them, which they have laid for their foundation,
miserable to themselves, and miserable to the whole world. What can be more
miserable to an ingenious good mind, then to have entangled himself in such a
Laborinth of perplexity and mischief, as to have left no place for the
acknowledging of his errors, without ruining his estate, (when as error is
only purged by acknowledging, and doubled by denyiing it?) And to what a
miserable push have they driven the world, either in their pleadings against
them with such force of evidence, or in their joining with them, as to stop the
mouth of the one, and to hang the faith of the other, on this unnatural
paradox; I and my Church cannot possibly err? And this you must take on our
words to be true. For as for their coniecturall evidence out of the
Scriptures, there seem to be as much, or more for the King of Spaines not
erring, as there is for the Popes, it being said, That the heart of the King is
in the hand of God, a divine sentence is in his lips, and his mouth shall not
transgress in judgment. But now, as by these means they have debarred
themselves from acknowledging, and consequently from being controlled of error
in matters of doctrine, so on the other side, to reform any great matter in
their practice, were to open the eyes and mouths of all men against them, who
now in the obedience of their blindness, stick fast unto them. Let them
suspend from hence forwards, the worshipping of Images, the flecing to Angels
and Saints by vows and prayers for pattonage, besides the great loss it would
bring unto their train in their offerings; What a iealosie would it breed in
the heads of their own, that they had led the world all this while on the
blind side, and that other things perhaps were introduced for gain, and
corruptly continued as well as these. Then for their adversaries, their own
manner of saying is, yield one thing unto them, and yield all, since all hang
upon the same Prince, and by the same string that any one does. So that it
seems not to have been unwisely conceived by him, who said; that to persuade
the Pope to any such reformation, was to persuade him to yield up his keys
and Crown, and to return to the order of his predecessors and other
Patriarchs, which to do, as yet he shows no intention. Than to hope, that
though himsefe and his Sea should withstand it, yet the learned of his side
might be enduced in other places to some treaty of accord, they know them not,
which would have that conceit of them.

For though it were perhaps not untruly said of a great man of their own,
that the Popes not erring was but an opinion of Policy* not of Theology, to
give stay to the La^tie, not stop to the Divines, of whom (in such infinite
controversies and iarrings about interpretations of Texts and conclusions of
Science, wherein many have spent a large part of their lives) Never any yet
went to be resolved by the Popes, as knowing it to be true which their own
Law delivers, that in holiness many an old woman, and in knowledge, many a
Friar might out-goe the Pope, but in power and authority the whole world was
under him: yet at this day they do so generally all cling unto him, and draw
by his line, as having no hope, either of standing against their opposites, but
only by him, or of unity amongst themselves, but only in him, that touch him,
and touch them; yea, they think some of them, the name of Paptist to be as
good and a more necessary name at this day then of Catholics, the one
showing only their unity with their body, the other with the head of the
Church, which is now more needful. It remains that Princes take the matter
in hand, and constrain the Pope and other to yield to such accord as they
should think reasonable. Indeed this were an only way to effect it: for Reason
is a good Orator, when it has force to back it. But where are those Princes?
they dream of an old world, and of the heroical times, who imagine that
Princes will break their sleeps for such purposes. If there were at this day,
a DAVID in Spain, a JOSIAS in France, or Ezechias in Italy, a Coustantine in
Germany, the matter were ended in a very short time. But take men as they are,
and as they are like to be (being brought up in the midst of their
factions and flatterers, where they seldom hear truth, and if a good motion,
by chance be set on foot by one part, it is sure to be straight crossed,
through the watchful industrious envy of the other), the world may hold it
self reasonable happy and content, if the civil State be vphelde in any
tolerable manner, and not think that they should care greatly for reforming
the Church, and much less for the uniting of the State Ecclesiastical, the
dissentions whereof, have, and daily serve so many men's turns. And though it
is to be acknowledged and thankefully commemorated, that this age has not
been so utterly ba^^en of good Princes, But some have deserved to have been
enrolled amongst these Worthies; yet the ambition and incroaching humors of
certain, and want of corespondencie requisite in others, have stopped perhaps
those honorable thoughts and designs, which had else been employed for the
universal good of Christendom. In sum, there is small hope remaining in
this part, the world having extinguished the care of the public good, by an
over-care of their private, and each proiecting to pass their own time
smoothly over, in pleasure, and recommending posterity to the Stars and
Destinies), these reasons, together with the long continuance of this division,
whereby both parts are formalized and settled in their opinions: insomuch, that
at this day there are but very few, (in comparison of former times) that are
gained either way: do make me despair greatly of any success by that
course, and so esteem of that plot, as an honest hearty desire, but no
probable design, and as a cabinet discourse of speculative consideration,
which practice in the world, and experience does need to certify.

The next point is, whether necessity (which overrules all frowardness and
sturdinesse of humors and passions) may not press them to some unity, if the
Turk grow still great upon them, as hitherto he has done, he shall leave no
hope for Christendom to resist, But in their inward concord. True it is that
a foreign enemy is a reconciler of brethren; and that common danger holds
them together, as long as it lasts, which else should fly asunder upon
every light occasion. But herein me thinks, it comes first to be
considered, whether the Turk be so fearful a Monarch as is commonly
conceived, especially since his late so huge enlargement toward the East, that
which most men esteem in him the grand cause ofterrour, seems to me a
chief argument of the contrary at this present, and that is the hugeness of
his Empire. For Empires are then at the strongest, when they are at their
biggest, there being a certain due proportion in all things, which they
breaking, the that exceed, as well as they that comeshort, may be acco^un ted
huge add vaste, but not great, since that is great properly which is great in
the actions, which one as often impeacheth by vnwildinesse in the big, as by
weakness in the little. But if to this be adjoined, (as it sometimes fall out)
that there be but a little soul to moove this vaste body, (which makes some
of the biggest men, to be neither wisest nor valiantest,) and that the
government (which is the soul of the state) is scant and feeble, not able to
embrace nor order so huge affairs* then is their no greater presage of ruin,
the^ the very massinesse it self, which every strong push or iustle makes
reele and totter for want of that inward strength which were requisite to hold
it steddie. And this take I to be the state of the Turkish Empire at this day
which being a mere tyranny as aiming only at the migh tinesse and security
of their great Lord, the sole absolute commander, without any respect to the
benesite of the people under him, save only so far-forth as may serve upon his
greatness: and for that cause in his jealousy and distrust of his own,
keeping territories half desolate, waste, and vn-inhabited, his subjects
without heads of Nobility to lead them; without hearts to encorage them to
seek their liberty or deliverie, abusing them by all kind of bestiall
education, and oppressing them by all sorts of extortion and outrage, giving
the land where he conquereth to his Soldiers, and Timarri, which scattered
over all parts of his ample Empire, are the only contented people, and
strength (in effect) he has, as being bound by their tenures to serve whither
soever he calls them, and without his charge. This being his state, it is
clear, that the wildnes and lying waste of his Country, is to the great
diminishing of his own wealth and revenue, which is less than some one of our
christian princes be at this day, though his Empire be larger then all theirs
together. The vnpopulousnesse, together with the baseness and feebleness of
such as are weak, that no one Country is a defense for himself, but must have
the concourse of very many of the rest to assist it: And lastly, the huge
circuit of his soil and confines, embracing (as is esteemed) eight thousand
miles of land, and of sea, as many, is the cause, that his Timarri cannot
assemble together* but in very long time, wherein oportunities are often lost,
besides the trying both of themselves, and their horses, before they arm. And
the truth here of is assured by fresh experience, he having done no great
matter in all his wars of Hungary, to speak of, only Germany with some
small help of Italy, being opposed against him: But if we consider the
effeminatenes of the education of their great Earls in these times: a thing
which they are advised and constrained unto, even contrary oftentimes, to the
manliness of their own natures, and al to keep the father from jealousy of
his own son, whose bravenesse of mind, and warlikenesse, is still
suspected, And use, having once soaked into their bones in youth, does for ever
after loose the sinews of manly dispositions, and assubiect them to the
softness and baseness of pleasures: considering also the avarice and
corruption which reigns there, all peace and war, all frenships and
enmities, all favors and wrongs, all counsels and informations, being grown
to be saleable. If these be as they are, the signs of the diseased, and
prognosticators of a ^ying Monarchy, much more of a tyranny; then surely have
we not now so great cause to dread him, as to blame our selves, and our
wrangling who choose thus in practicing to exterminate each other, to trace out
a dishonorable and fruitless life. At the end finding our selves at the
same, or worse terms then when we began, rather then establishing first a
firm accord at home, to attempt with unity, zeal, love and forces, so just,
so Christian, so honorable, so rich a war. And verily, if but Princes
confining upon him (though agreeing among themselves for the most patte in
Religion) were not so strongle infected with emulationand home- ambitions, as
^o condescend to pay Tribute to the Turk in several, for so do they as a
redemption, each of them of their peace, whereof it has no longer assurance
the^ his pleasure, which with double as much underhand bribes and presents must
be daily sweetened. And which is yet worse, when he list, comes to invade any
one of them (as he does for his very exercise, and avoiding tumults at home)
the rest do hold off from giving succors to their neighbors, for fear of
drawing on revenge upon themselves some other time, which is the cause of the
Polonians and Venetians at this present, who scarsely dare so much as pray
against them in their devotios, otherwise then in their hearts, which I ween
they do duly. where it not I say that their private ambitio^s, fears, and
mistrustes did drive them to make so abject and unchristian choice, as to
inthrall themselves into such bonds of tribute, and slaverie, to so proud, and
insole^t, and wicked enemy rather then to join in one course, for the ^oo^ing
of him and his tyranny out of this part of the world, it were not so much to
be doubted, but the fear now of this side would soon turn to the other,
seeing that one good blow to a body so built, and so full of distempers were
able to put the whole in danger of ruining, and shivering. These reasons indu^e
me not to think that the danger from the Turk should be so great, as to
enforce the Christians to run mainly to an accord: and though it should, yet
without other sounder working by perfect composing of all inward dissension,
this would be but a civil accord, and only for this time, which (the fear
once past) would dissolve of it self, and the former contentions revive as
fresh as ever. For the bond of common fear, is the strongest indeed of all
other, but the shortest withal, which nothing during the danger is able to
break, and the danger once past, falls in sunder of his own unsoundness,
howbeit if the Turk should set foot in Italy, and abate the Popes strength,
by possessing his State, then would I not doubt much, but that both himself
would be content, and all other Princes forward, that some such v^itie, as is
before spoken of, might be established. Unity of persuasion
But that is a case as unlikely in short time, as in tract of time not
impossible to happen if some manly stow^e Turk, should succeed these woman^sh.
There remains then, the unity by persuasion only, which both sides seem now
to ^est on, each practicing and hoping in tract of time to eat out the
strength of th^ther, by his industry, in drawing away by persuasion his
followers and adherents wherein the Protestant accoun^eth his advantage so much
the greater, in that the unity of verity is it which he persuades; and
truth being by so infinite degrees stronger than vn^r^et^, having God to
bless it, heaven* and earth, and all the creatures of GOD to witness it; and
falshoode it self (which is always his own cut-throte, by his crossing and
con^rariety) to yield confession unto it, unless the fault be exceedingly in
the ^a^dler and pleader, it must needs in the end maugre the malice of all
enemies, and craft of all inventions, prevail and have the victory, although
the utter abolishment of the Kingdom of Antichrist they refer with the
prophecy to the appearance of our Savior in judgment and triumph, now
shortly approaching. On the other side, the Papists hope that their persuasion
being seconded by so great Princes authority, and fat^ered, by so many
collateral aids, of motives, and practices, leaving nothing v^assayed which
may prejudice, inflict, or annoy their opposite; and providing as they do, a
perpetual succession of instruments to be employed in each kind over all
parts of Christendom, they shall in the end tire, eat out, and utterly
consume the strength and stomach of their vnpolitique and divided adversaries.
In the number whereof, though they score up all religions, especially christian,
that acknowledge not the Pope, and the threefold plenitude of his supernall,
terrestrial, and infernal power, extending to heaven in canonizing Saints, to
the lower parts of the world in ^reeing from Purgatory, and over the earth in
being the universal guide and pastor of all mem, yet are they not affected to
all their opposites in like sort (speaking of such as with whom they live and
daily converse,) For, to omit the Jew whom they monk with their M^ssias so
long in coming, as also the G^aecian whom they pity with their Patriarch
under the Turkish slaverie, their hatred is to the Lutheran, the Author of
their calamity. But hatred and fear both of the Calvinists only, whom they
account the only growing enemy and dangerous of their state. For Lutherans in
Germany.
as for the Lutherane he was long since at the highest, and if he fetch an inch
forwards one way, for an ell he loses an other, it is only by a kind of
boisterous force and violence against the Ca^vinists as in Strasborough of
late. The reason ^herof (besides the absurdities of the ^biquitary Chimera)
^ath perhaps been in part, for that their opinion took up his seat in
Germany, a stiff people, but on heavy, which will hold their own well, but
gain little upon other men, whereas the other falling upon a livelier metal,

of the French especially, who are always stirring and practicing upon their
neighbous. And more vehement for the while in whatsoever they affect, has had
a very huge increase in latter time, notwithstanding those massacres which have
been used to extinguish them, and still growing forwards in all places where
once it takes, and overtoppeth them now, from whose root at first it sprung.
This therefore by all means they seek to repress, giving some blind hope to
the Lutherane of quiet and toleration, so he will join against these a while
the sretters out of both: But of all places, their desires and attempts to
recover England have been always* and still are the strongest, which in their
more sober moods, so many of them will acknowledge to have been the only
nation that walk the right way of justifiable reformation, in comparison of
other, who have run headlong rather to a tumultuous innovation (so they
conceive it) whereas that alteration that has been in England* was brought in
with peaceable and orderly proceeding, by general consent of the Prince and
whole realm represe^tatively assembled in solemn Parliament a great part of
their own Clergy according and conforming themselves unto it, no Luther, no
Calvine, the square of their faith, what public discussing and long
delberation did persuade them to be faulty, that taken away: The succession of
Bishops, and vocation of Ministers continued, the dignity and state of the
Clergy preserved, the honor and solemnity of the word of God not abused, the
more ancient vsages not cancelled. In sum, no humor of affecting
contrariety, but a charitable endeavor rather of conformity, with the Church
of Rome in whatsoever they thought, not gain saying to the express law of
GOD, which is the only approoveable way in all new reformations: yet
notwithstanding, in regard of the power and renown of the Prince, and of their
exemplarie policy in government of the state, in regard that they concurring
entirely with neither side, yet reverenced of both, are the fitter and abler to
work unity between them; and to be an vmpire also and directer, a swayer of
al, whenever there should be an occasion of assembling of their councels, or
conioyning their forces, for their common defense, and especially, for that it
is the only* Nation of the Protestant party, able to encounter and affront
their king Catholics proceedings for the rooting out of heresy, as their
actions both by sea and land have manifested. Of all places in the world they
desire most to recover it, making full account that the rest would then soon
follow and apply to them of their own accord one after another. But to as
high a tide as they are risen in their desires thereof, to as low an ebb, are
they fallen in their hopes, being less now (for ought I perceive) than ever,
having seen her Majesty kept, and almost myraculously preserved, their
treasons discovered, their excommunications vanished, their armies defeated,
their cartels and books answered, their chief champions discouraged, wasted,
deceased; those that remain, though many, yet few of ability, insomuch (were
it not for some hope of reformation which time may bring) their fou^ders were
likely to withdraw from them ere long their stipends, which get them but a name
of fruitless liberality. And this is all I can say for any hope or means of
this general unity; and so much I leave and recommend it to God, as being both
our best and now only remaining policy, to address our united and general
supplications to his divine power and majesty. That it may please him, by that
ever-springing fountain of his goodness and gracious mercy, even beyond all
humane hope (if it may and so with his blessed will) and by such means as to
his Divine wisdom are ever in readiness, to effect those things which to man's
wit may seem impossible) to extend his compassionable and helping hand, over
his miserable, defiled, and disgraced Church, persecuted abroad, and
persecuting it self at home, confined by Tyrants into a corner of the world,
and therein raging and renting it self into fitters to purge out of men's
minds that ambition and vanity, which so bewitches them with the love of
Pomps and glories of this perishing and ending world, which in the breathing of
a breath they will loathe and despise as nothing, and to graffe in them a pure
and single eye, to behold the eternal truth (which seen) breeds love, and
love, conductes to happiness; To root out all gall and acerbitie on both
sides, and to bend their hearts to charity, that being reunited in the
pilgrimage of this life, this country of our terrestrial bodies, we may after
our service and course therein accomplished, ascend under the conduct of our
Savior, before ascended to our everlasting rest, in the country of our
celestial Souls, there in society and unity of Saints and Angels to
enjoy the happy vision of the all glorious deity, and to sing his praise for
ever.

I should here make an end concerning the Church of Rome, but that a question
incident to the matter, which last was spoken of, being moved by many, and
diversely answered, does sommon me to deliver up my conjecture also; and
that is, upon what ground of equity or policy the Pope should suffer both
the Jews and Graecians to have public exercise of their religion in Italy,
yea in Rome it self, under his Holiness nose, and only the poor Protestant
must be persecuted and chased, if it be possible, out of the world; no view of
his religion to other, no exercise of it to himself permitted. For as for the
Graecians they have a Church at Venice, with an Archbishop of Philadelphia, a
Bishope of O^igo, and sundry other Priests to govern it. And the Italians also
do often repair unto thiere Mass. They have their Mass also in Greek with
leavened bread and other schismatic ceremo^ies at Rome it self and in
Naples they say their priests retain their wives still by permissio^ from the
Pope; in regard that in these places they acknowledge the Pops pre-eminence and
power, which at Venice they do not, but a mere primacie of order, which the
ancient Councils thought good to give him. No more do Grecians in Apuglia, and
Calabria, about Otranto, and at Cassana, nor in Cortu, and other Islands
adjoining to that coast, being the old remains of the Occidentall Grecians,
and who have always, and do still follow the Greek Church in all things,
though these in Calabria, and Apuglia be subject to the King of Spain, and in
his power to root out when soever himself lists. And yet even in Italy it
self does he suffer them and their Religion, who never could be induced to
tolerate the Protestants in any the remotest corner of his huge scattered
Monarchy, though the Grecians are condemned Heretics, even in matter of the
Trinity, and perpetual oppugners of the Papal right and authority. Then for
the Jews, they even swarm in the most of the chief parts of Italy, at Rome
specially where the least number I could ever hear them esteemed at, is ten
thousand and upwards, though others say twice as many. They have there, at the
least, four or five Synagogues, both there and elsewhere; their Circumcision,
their Liturgies, their Sermons in public, and all that ^i^t may resort unto
them: yea, in means of enriching themselves, they are so much favored, that in
all places they are permitted to strain up their usury to eighteen in the
hundred upon the Christian, (for among themselves they no where use it) whereas
also that sum in a Christian is not tolerated, which causes many of the
Christians to use these Jews underhand, in improoving their unlawful rents to
their utmost proportion. They have also in some places and it may be in all, a
peculiar Magistrate, to decide any controversy between Christians and them,
with particular direction to favor the^ in their trades. And lastly, where
France has banished that race, in Avingnon only the Popes city are they
harbored and retained. Some answer to this demand in defense of the Pope, that
the Church has no authority to chastise the Jews, who never were within the
Church, but are as enemies in even terms, whereas the Protestants are either
unnatural or rebellious children, who have flung out of the Church; or the
issue of such, against whom her authority is endless, and unrestrained, to
take all courses possible to reclaim them for ever. This answer seems
faulty, both as short of the question, seeing it extends not to the
Grecians, who are in the very same role of Heretics, and Schismatics,
flingers out of the Church; and for that there is difference between
exercising jurisdiction in punishing an enemy, and not harboring and
cherishing him, and his unlawful and scandalous religion in our very bosoms,
as is done in Italy, who have called the Jews in thither, yea, and still do
entice them whom France, England, and Spain, have banished from the^ long
since. Others leaving these quirkes of justice, hold by the text of Charity,
That it is a Christian act to harbor a harmless enemy, and especially that
it is of al other most befitting the Church, who has hereby also better means
to reduce them to the Faith: And so in fine to save their souls, which is the
sum of their endevors. And in fortifying this answer, there is to be
alleged for the first point, that the Jews have their Service in Hebrewe, and
the Grecians in Greek, which Italy understands not, yea, and that they have
purged the Hebrewe Liturgy from all points wherein they did impugn or
scandalize Christianity. And for the second point; that the Jews are bound to
repair at some times to the Christian Sermons by which means some few of them
have been converted and more may be when God shall please so. But neither
seems this answer so perfect as were requisite, for the Jews do make their
Sermons or expositions of the Law in the Italian language, though the text of
Scripture they cite in the original. And although they have purged their
Liturgies, as they say, yet leaving them Circumcision, they tolerate that
which is now intolerable. And as for their gayning of any souls among them,
if they gained not more Crowns, that reason would not stand: for if any credit
may be given to the Hebrews themselves, as many Friars become Jews, as Jews
become Friars, of both sorts some, but few of either. But of the good provision
they have taken to convert them, and of the fruits thereof I shall speak
hereafter: In the mean time, this I ask: would they suffer the English
Protestants to have an English Church there, none understanding their language,
neither in service, nor Sermons, yea and purging their Lyturgy of whatsoever
may seem to impugn or deface their religion (if there be any thing in it of
that offensive quality) as for my part I know nothing, but think rather, with
great judgment it was purposely so framed out of the grounds of Religion,
wherein both sides agree, that their very Catholics might resort to it,
without scruple, or scandal, if faction more then reason did not sway. Then for
repayring to their Sermons they know by experience they will not be backward,
especially having the opinion of great men (as some say) that it is not
unlawful. And lastly, what reason why they should not be as hopeful to gain
English men's souls as Jews? yes, their hope is greater, else would they not
be at such cost upon the one abroad, and bestow so little labor upon the
other at home. To this question they would answer; first, that there were
more danger of flocking away their people, if they should have but once a bare
view of our Churches, as being more infectious, therefore no policy. And
secondly, to what purpose the making of any such motion, what need unto us, and
unto them what profit? This answer deduced from policy and profit I take to be
the right answer. Also to the first principal question, and neither of the
former drawn from Justice or Charity; For there is no cause of any fear at
all, either of the oppressed Grecian, or of the obstinate Jew, bearing a mark
of ignominy and reproach in all places, yea, they remain the rather as
examples, and spectacles among them, of contempt and misery; the one for the
ungrateful refusal of Christ himself; the other for his sedition against the
Vicar of Christ, as they infer against him: whereas to give the Protestant
any foot amongst them, were the next way to leave themselves no foot to stand
on: On the other side, by extending pity toward the afflicted, and dismayed
Grecian, whom the very hand of God has laid as low as the very dust, they
saw some hope of regaining him again under their subjection, which were to
them a reputation and strength inestimable, and such as they cunningly by false
bruits, cause the wicked daily to feed on. Then for the Jew, the profit by him
is exceeding great, and greater in proportion of number then by the very
Curtesans, and that as well to the Pope, as to other Princes of Italy, to whom
they pay a yearly rent for the very heads they wear, besides other means, to
rack, and wrack them in their purses at pleasure: which gain, as it is a
piece of a cause why the beastly trade of the one; so it is the entire reason
why the cruel trade of the other is permitted: they being used as the Friars,
to suck from the meanest, and to be sucked by the greatest; insomuch, that the
Pope besides their certain tribute, does sometimes (as is said) impose on them
a subsidy for ten thousand crowns extraordinary for some service of state.

52 Now to consider a little, what probability of their conversion there is in
these parts. And by the way to touch somewhat of their religion, and usage.
Thus stands their case; they have a religion, though something strange to our
conceits, as being framed, not only out of the law of the old Bible, but also
out of sundry capricious fancies and fables of their Rabbis, yet so hansomly
peeced and glued together, that one part seems to hang to the other not
absurdly. And that which they hold, they are so perfect in, that they will give
both a probable account of it out of certain Moral Philosophy, and reason,
(wherein they are well seen) as also make some show for it out of the Bible it
self, wherein they are the skilfullest men (I believe) in the world. And needs
must they be so, setting their children to the Hebrew language at three years
old, and following no other study save of the Bible, and writings upon it all
their life long, except some few that betake themselves to Physic. Touching
God and his nature: Their opinions are for the most part very honorable and
holy, save that they deny the trinity. Touching Angels, but weak, and soyled
with much Poetry, Touching the nature and condition of man, very exquisite,
and for the most part, drawing near unto truth. But for the three states of
the soul of man, they run some more strange courses, holding the creation of
them altogether with sundry of the ancient, and others, the (...) of Pythagoras
(though not to different species) and Platoes Purgatory of Virtue and Vice,
and man's course; in both they think not much amiss, so that to the expiation
of sin, they hold nothing necessary but the repentance of the sinners, and
the mercy of the Forgiver, which in that case is always ready; For reward,
that it comes wholly from the bounty of God, without desert, yet different in
degree, according to the works of each man. That the general law of all men is
the law of nature only, which who so keeps, it shall lead him to bliss, in
what Religion soever, though the Hebrews, unto whom the law of Moses was
peculiarly given, by observing it shall have a prerogative of glory.

They prefer the civil life before the solitary, and Marriage before
Virginity, as being to Nature more agreeable, to mankind more profitable, and
consequently to God more acceptable. Their belief of the end of the world, of
the final judgment, of the restoring of men's bodies, and of their happiness
everlasting in the height of the heavens, is good in the general: But as they
think it a bad opinion which some men seem to hold, That God in his
everlasting and absolute pleasure should affect the extreme misery of any of
his creatures, for the showing of his justice and severity in tormenting them;
Or that the calamity, casting away, and damnation of some should absolutely
and necessarily redound more to his glory than the felicity of them all,
considering that his nature is mere goodness and happiness, and has no
affinity with rigor or misery: so contrariwise they think with Origin, That
hell, in the end, shall be utterly abolished: And that the Devils themselves
after a long course of bitter repentance and punishment shall find mercy at
his hands that did create them, That the World may be entirely restored unto
that purity wherein Almighty God at the first did make it. And to that
perfection and happiness whereto each part of it in his several degrees was
destined by him, from whom nothing but goodness and blessedness could
proceed: Their Lyturgie in the kind of it, is not much different from ours,
consisting in Psalms, and Prayers with sundry short Hymns and Responds of
Lessons: One out of the Law, and read by some chief person, an other out of
the Prophets, correspondent unto the former in Argument, but is read by some
boy or mean companion; For they will in no sort do honor, neither attribute
they that authority to any other part of the Bible that they do to their Law,
which they do usually carry about their Synagogue at the end of their Service
in procession, with many ornaments of Crowns and Scepters, the children
kissing it, as it does pass by them. And sometimes do they make proclamation,
who will give most to their treasure, to have the honor of that time of taking
out of the Law. But for the manner of performing their service and their
behavior thereat, it is different from all other that ever I saw; They chaunt
it in a strange wild halowing tune, with imitating sometimes trumpets, and
ecchoing one to another, and winding up by degrees from a soft or silent
whispering to the highest and lowdest notes that their voices will bear, with
continual great wagging of their bodies, and exultation, as it were, in some
savage and raging solemnity, sometimes all springing up lightly from the
ground, and with as much variety as wild work will receive, They wear
certain Ornaments of imbrodered linen, cast mantle-wise about their
shoulders, which are their Philacteries edged with knotted, fringe, according
to the number of the Commandments, and serving as local memories of the Law.
The reverence they show, is in standing up at times, and the gesture of
adoration in bowing forwards of their bodies; for kneeling they use none, no
more than do the Graecians; neither stir they their bonets in their
Synagogue to any man, but remain still covered: They come to it with washed
hands, and in it, they burn Lamps to the honor of God: but for any show of
devotion, or elevation of spirit, that, yet in Jews could I never discern;
but they are as reverend in their Synagogues, as Grammar boys are at School,
when their master is absent: in sum, their holiness is the very outward
work it self, being a brainelesse head and soulelesse body. For
circumcision they use it to the dead as well as to the living, yet no way think
it necessary for the infants salvation: They are a subtle and advantageous
people, and wonderful eagre or gain, insomuch, that whosoever deals with them,
needs let his wit go with his belief, or else his findings shall come short
to his expecting; as earnest to make Proselits as ever were their ancestors,
and as obstinate against Christ as the Priests that condemned him. In other
points they are, perhaps, rather to be commended than otherwise. Their care of
avoiding fornication is such, that they do marie their sons at eighteen
years: but adultery they would pupunish with death, if they had liberty; when
they break the Law, they come to their Rabbi for punishment, yet without any
particular disclosing of their fault: they keep their fasts and feasts very
duly: But as the Christians fast the night, so they the noone always: They
are charitable among themselves, leaving no poor vnrelieved, no prisoner
vnransomed, which makes them good price upon every pretense. And although for
their usury and guilefull dealing they are generally hated there, and handled
like very dogs, yet some of them I have known m^n of singular virtue and
integrity of mind, seeming to want no grace but the faith of a Christian:
Each Synagogue has his Rabbi to expound their Law, to instruct their
children, to decide their differences. For their Massias, they say now, seeing
he stays so long, he shall be a forerunner of the end of the world, and
shall gather by his power, all nations into one fold, and so resign them up
into the hands of that eternal Pastor. But it does seem they expect him out
of the East, whither the Spanish Jews fled, and have exceedingly multiplied,
for those do they hold to be of the Tribe of Judah, and the other in Germany
and in Italy to be of the Tribe of Benjamin, who in honor of the more noble
Tribe, and to correspond with them the better, do learn the Spanish tongue
which those still retain.

53 But now to come to the point which I principally intended, which is, what
probability there is of their conversion Touching the Jews conversion.
in Italy: Three great impediments, besides their natural and inrooted
obstinacy I suppose there are which hinder it. The sca^dals of the Christians,
the want of means to instruct them, and the punishment or loss which by their
conversion they incur. A scandal it is to see man's law Scandals given ^o
the Jews.
preferred before Gods, to see so great a matter made of eating flesh upon a
friday: and that adultery should pass for so ordinary a pastime; a scandal
are all these blasphemies darted up with hellish mouths against God and our
Savior, so ordinarily and openly, that some of them are become very
Interiections of speech to the vulgar, and othersome mere phrases of gallantry
to the braver: a scandal is the forging and packing of miracles, wherein the
Friars and Jews concur in equal diligence, the one in contriving, the other
in discovering them. And surely this is an exceeding great scandal to them;
seeing truth is of so pure and victorious a nature, that it refuses to be in
league with any falsehood in the world, much more disdaineth to be assisted by
it: neither can there be a greater wrong done to a true conclusion, then to
endeavor to prove it by an untrue allegation: a scandal is the alterations
which they are forced by the inquisitors to make in their Authors and monuments
of antiquity, thinking that these devises are our best evidences. But of all
these alterations, they keep a note for a time: A scandal is the vowing and
praying to Angels and Saints, which they hold to be the duties peculiar to God
only, and so has it been esteemed among them in all ages: yea, and they note
that the Christians pray more often and more willingly unto Christ's mother,
then unto Christ himself, or to God. But the greatest scandal of all others,
is their worshipping of Images, for which both Jews and lurkes call them
Idolatrous Christians. Now this is so much the greater, and of more indignity,
for that they generally conceive it to be a thing which Christ himself
expressly commanded, and that in the Gospel of Christ, written by the
Evangelists themselves; that the Decalogue should be recited with omission of
the second Precept, as one of their greatest Rabbines contested with me, being
induced into that error by some Catechism of the Christians, which he had
seen with that fault. Now when they come to conference with the Priests and
Friars, (as sometimes they do), they vpbraid this as a pere^ptorie exception
against Christ: those good men deny it not for fear of scandalizing their own,
but letting it pass for current; that Christ, whom the Jews call a Carpenters
son, was an Image-maker: or howsoever, an Author of the worshipping of them,
seeking to sa^^e up the gash which they have made in the plain words of that
Law which was written by the finger of God, with their speculative plasters of
distinguishing between the Image of the true God, and the Idols of the false
gods, of (...) and (...) of intention instrumental, and final in worship; all
which are the vnfavorest dregs to the Jew in the world, who faith; there was
never yet Nation in the world under the Sun, so blockish as to worship a
stock and stone, as a final object, but only as a representer of some absent
divinitye, and that the heathen themselves call them the Effigies and symulacra
of other; yet such Effigies, as that the divine power by his virtue, did
sometimes inhabit and work miracles by, even as our Lady does in her images in
diverse places of Christendom; whereby, if the poor idiot were deceived among
the Paga^s, to think sometimes that very image some diviner person, as clear
it is, that the like befalls infinite simple christians, seeing their images
either to groan or to weep and bleed, as they do often, and so infinite
cares wrought by viewing and touching them: And for their degrees of worshipe
between Gods image and the Saints, they cannot perceive them, they kneel to
them alike, they pray to them alike, they vow to them alike, they incence them
alike, they burn candles to them alike, they clothe them alike, they offer
gifts to them alike: the difference (if it be any) is in their mental
affections, which whether the blunt and vndistinguishing wits of the vulgar
do observe, they suppose a small measure of discretion may conjecture. In like
sort, for their distinction between the images of the true God, (...) of the
false gods: they tell them that in other cases that might have his place; but
now in this law, it being expounded in other places as prohibiting this base
and se^suall seducing kind of worshipping God himself by an image (if any
image of God were possible to be made) That thus the law it self does plainly
deliver: thus they which received the law understood it, thus al their holy
ancestors and learned doctors have still interpreted it* and thus has their
nation in all ages believed: and therefore they say, for their coming to the
Christians sermons; that as long as they shall see the Preacher direct his
speech and prayer to that little wooden crucifixe that stands on the pulpit by
him, to call it his Lord and Savior, to kneel to it, to embrace it, to kiss
it, to weep upon it, (as is the fashion of Italy) this is preaching sufficient
for them and per swades them more with the very sight of it, to hate Christian
religion, then any reason that the world can allege to love it: and those be
the scandalls which I heard themselves allege they take on that side, besides
their Transubstantiation, which they can at no hand digest: The particular
scandalls from the Protestants, is their mutual dissentions which they hold to
proceed from the want of the unity of truth in their foundations, otherwise
save for their general exceptions against Christianity, they hold their
religion very conformable to the law of Nature, which they account the
principal. But were all the vnneedefull scandalls in those parts removed, yet
is their no good means there of the Jews conversion used. They complain
first, that the new Testament, being the ground of our religion, they cannot
see it. That Italian translation which they had, is called in, and taken from
them, it is printed in Hebrew letters, but not in Hebrew language, at
leastwise, not in such as they can understand. With Greek and Latin their
nations never meddled: besides which, the Inquisitors have inhibited and taken
from them, all books that were ever published in that theme on either side,
as well those that have bin written in defense of christian religion, as also
the contrary against it, alleging they will have no disputing in matter of
religion either way, much like to an Edict set up at Dola, in the french
County, where the Jesuits reside, forbidding any talk of God, either in good
sort, or in bad. Then lastly, for those few sermons they are bound to repair
to, seldom are they directed to the points they stick on, but hold on their
usual tenor, as respecting merely the Christians. The last discouragement to
men, especially of their metal, is, that at their conversion to Christianity,
they must quitte their goods to the Christians. And the reason is, for that in
baptism they rerenounce the devil and all his works, part whereof, are the
Jews goods being gotten, either of themselves, or of their ancestors by usury.
Now this is such a cold comfort to a man set on the world, (as that Nation is
wonderfully) that for my part I have not hard of any co^verted in those parts,
save some Physicians, with some of their children, who by friendship to the
Pope, have obtained dispensatio^ to retain their goods still, in as much as
they were gotten by their honorable profession. But if on the contrary fide,
the Christians would again in their charity, give somewhat for the competent
entertainment of such as for Gods sake did give up their own, I could not but
well commend that rigor of justice, which the bountifulness of this mercy did
mitigate and asweeten. But being no such matter, there remains nothing for a
Jew converted, but to be friared, a trade which of all other they lest can
fancy, as being contrary (as they allege to Nature it self) which has made
man sociable, and each helpful to other in all civil duties, a trade never
commanded or commended by God, never practiced nor counseled by their renowned
ancestors, who received continual instruction and inspiration from above,
which none of their Patria^kes or Prophets has given example of. Only in
three or four thousand years, Elias and some one other, has been found,
upon very extraordinary cause, to have taken also an extraordinary course of
life, though of other nature, and to other purpose then the votaries of our
times. And these are the terms that the Jews stand on in those parts: and so
must I leave the^ to the merciful care of God, an unblessed and forsaken
people, obstinate within, and scandalized without, indefatigable in their
expectations, intractable in persuasion, worldly, yet wretched, received of
their enemies, but despised and hated, scattered over all countries, but no
where planted, daily multiplying in number, but to the increase of their
servitude, and not to their power. In sum, a long continued and marked
example of Gods just severitie to abate their pride, that glory even as they in
their ancestors and founders, Gods Temple, and Oracles, promises, and many
prerogatives, long continuance in honorable estate and glory, (which things,
if they were sufficient to preserve any seat in the world, even their seat had
been preserved by them) and to proclaim to the whole world, that there is no
assurance of the favor, protection, and assistance of God, (without which all
falls to ruin) but in believing in his Son, and in keeping his
commandments. And this also may serve touching the Church of Rome sufficient.
The Greek Church.


Next follows the Greek Church inthralled (all in a manner save the
Muscovites and Candians, with some few other of no great name or number) under
the Turkish tyranny: of which Church, as their far distance from us
requires not to speak much, so their uniformity in misery, yields not
much to be spoken for their Religion, except only their ancient error,
touching the proceeding of the Holy Spirit from the Father alone, wherein they
have long dissented from all Latin or West Churches. In other points they
seem to stand in some middle terms of opinion, between the Romish and the
Protestants, in the more weighty, or at the leastwise in the dominative. With
Rome they concur in the opinion of Transubstantiation, and generally in the
service, and whole body of the Mass, in praying to Saints, in auricular
confession, in offering of sacrifice, and prayer for the dead, and in these,
without any, or with no material difference. They hold Purgatory also and the
worshipping of pictures: but for images, they will not so much as endure them
in their Churches. As well for the proclivitie they have to train away the
ignorant into the crime of Pagan errors, as also to avoid that similitude
between their Churches and Heathenish Temples of Idols, which imagery does
cause. And for their pictures, they kneel to two only, to Christ, and our
Lady: the rest they pass over with an ordinary reverence. For Purgatory they
hold none, in hell, or in the skirts thereof, or by any outward torment, but
that the souls of the faithful are not received into glory, till by an
extreme compunction and anguish of mind, they have worn out those stains
with which the same, and the pleasures thereof in this life, defile them. In
sum, those opinions which grew into the Church before that separation
between the Greeks and the Latins, and all those ceremonies which were common
unto both, they still retain, as their crossings, and tapers, with certain
other. But for these superstitions which have crept in fresh memory, or which
were as ancient, yet not so current; and in general, all those Canons of the
Romish faith, which have been thrust on the Church in those times, by the
unaccountable power and pride of the Papacy, tending to the advancement of
their own Sea, and to the exempting of their Church and doctrine from trial,
by those Anabaptifticall fancies of the spirit, that man's them, and protecteth
them from error in their consultations or resolution touching matter of faith,
extenuating the sufficiency and authority of the Scriptures in comparison of
their spirit, or Church guided by it; all these things they abhor no less
then the Protestant: they hold understanding requisite to concur with
affection, for the accomplishment of devotion in praying to God. And although
their Lyturgies be the same that in the old time, namely; Saint Basills, Saint
Chrysostomes, and Saint Gregory's translated, without any bending of them to
that change of language which their tongve has suffered, yet do they say,
that alteration is not so great, but that their people with small accustoming,
understand the language well enough. But by praying with Saint Dominickes round
counters, they esteem of it no better then those heathenish repetitions, and
unnatural lip-labor which our Savior censureth: neither can they believe
that the Apostle James the lesser, who is painted under the Papacy with his
great beads at his girdle, even as Mary Magdalen lightly praying before a
crucifixe, was Saint Dominicks disciple, but a wiser man's far, and one that
introduced a better fashion of praying, if the world would have bin contented
to have followed his prescripts. In like sort, for the holy water so much used
under the Papacy, they believe no such fear, that the devil should have of it,
nor svch force in it as to purge sin as their neighbors do teach: they repute
it a very vain opinion, that the Church cannot err, both in the whole, and in
every part thereof: and consequently, that their neighbors of Rome had bestowed
their pains better, which they have spent, in proving and persuading that they
cannot err, in providing and caring more not to have erred. They acknowledge
that there is sufficient doctrine in Scripture for salvation, though to the
ancient vsages of the Church, and writings of the fathers, they yield due
reverence. Three things in the Pope they condemn, especially his pride, in
arrogating of so exorbitant a jurisdiction over all Churches, contrary to the
decrees of antitient Counsels, and upon no shadow of right or good foundation,
but chiefly in usurping that temporal tyranny over Princes and the States, in
deposing of the one, and disposing of the other at his absolute pleasure; his
cruelty in persecuting other Christians with such extremity (for their
different opinions) his presu^ption in mounting to the seat of God, by
dispencing with the law of God and granting pardon for sin, and liberty out of
Purgatory, which they account to be of those royal prerogatives incident to God
only. For as for the doctrinal foundations of these indulgences, the overplus
of merits and satisfactions, in some being more the^ they needed, or then were
to be required of any joys of heaven, in their particular persons, and
consequently remain as a perpetual treasure to the Church, to be conferred by
the Pope, on his weaker and lesser deserving, or rather less satisfying
children (for so is their opinion) so far are they from prising m^^ts at such
an estimable value, that contrariwise they concur in assertion with the
Protestants, that it is impossible for any creature to merit, as by way of
right, the least dram of reward at, his Creators hands; the service of ten
thousand millions of worlds, being not able to add any shadow of perfection to
him, who is perfection it self, having whatsoever is good or desirable within
himself, even from all eternity, in infinity of degrees and with
impossibility of any the least addition. But whatsoever reward is bestowed upon
the Creature, flows forth from the mere bounty and gratiousnes of the
Creator, who as in goodness alone and mere grace did make him, so also in
mere grace does advance him to that high happiness. That service intermediall
which he requires, is a gracious disposition of sweetest harmony, from the
inexplicable wisdom of a Lord and Father, still abounding and enlarging his
hands in all bounty and goodness toward his sons and servants, and destined
to no others then to the creatures mere benefit and advancement only; that by
his requisite indevors in those honorable ways of wisdom and virtue, of love
and thankfulness, and of imitating of his Maker in doing good in the world, he
may grow to a higher degree of glory, which is proposed and reserved by that
great rewarder in the height of the heavens, as a full and final
accomplishment of his whole deserts, as the Crown of his celestial
blessedness. Now, as in this opinion they agree in general with Protestants
doctrine, so do they mightily dissent from that doctrine, touching the eternal
counsels of God, which Calvine (as some conceive) first reveiled or rather
introduced into the world. And since, some of his friends and fellows have
seconded, as thinking it very injurious to the goodness of God, and directly and
immediately opposite to his nature, in regard whereof, one of their Bishops
has written a book against it, which has bin sent to Geneva, and there
received. Thus much of their doctrine, which though it may better and fuller
be taken out of their Books, yet have I thought not inconvenient to deliver
this in brief, how I have found them also in speech and conference affected.

55 Their Liturgies, for the most part, are those three I have named, all
which they use for varieties sake in the several feasts and times allotted for
them. For the form and ceremonies, they much resemble the Latins, though of
the two the French Mass more than the Italian, not only in their holy bread,
but especially in their Altar, which with great mystery (as is said) they both
enclose from the people, that the Arcana of those their ineffable crossings and
convertings, may not be prostituted and Polluted by unsanctified view, whereas
the Romans lie open on all sides to all eyes. In their host they use leaven,
which the Latins avoyde. They elevate it forward, which the Latins do
backward, and near the body of the Church, which the other do at the Altar.
In their crossings they are very plentiful, but herein swarving from the
Latins. The Greek, who is more nimble therein, begins his cross on the
right side, and the Latins on the left, each with his several mystery. They
have also a shifting* in one, and the same Mass, from one Altar to another,
which the Latins have not, who contrariwise have in a Church a dozen Masses,
sometimes all going at once at several Altars, which the Grecians use not for
ought I could see; they have much ado with their lights, in putting them out,
and in again, at several times and parts of their service, and their Liturgy
is much intermedled with singing performed in a tune, neither artificial nor
altogether neglected, but grave alternated and branched with diverse parts. At
the Creed the Priests come forth to the door of the chancels, and hold up a
little imbrodered picture of Christ, toward which they do reverence, and
pronounce their be liefe. Their gesture, or reverence, are the very same with
the Jews, standing up and bowing forwards their bodies at times; for kneeling
they use none, save only (as they say) one day in the year. At there coming,
they bow themselves thri^e toward the Altar, and three times cross themselves
at their departure, having taken their holy bread with kissing their Prelates
hands, from whom they receive it, they finally salute the pictures of Christ,
and our Lady, kissing their hands which are plated over with metal for
wearing. But the Grecians pictures of Christ, and of our Lady, are nothing like
the Latins, but as different as any two ordinary faces that a man shall see.
The most uniformity therein that I have seen, is with us in England, For in
Italy there is little, especially of our Lady, whose very pictures, which they
say S. Luke himself partly did draw, and partly begun, and an Angel did
finish, may argue more devotion toward her in the drawer, then acquaintance,
unless her face were very variable or their skill very slender. Somewhere,
as at Loretto, she is painted like a Blackmore: In sum, they have so little
knowledge of her countenance and favor, that in some places they will assemble
diverse of their fairest Curtesans, to draw the most modest beauty of a Virgin,
out of the flagrancie of harlots. But to return to the Grecians, and to come
now to their government, which is ancient, by Patriarchs, Archbishops, and
Bishops, with other orders inferior, unto whom the people carry exceeding
respect, as it were, to the public fathers, and heads of their nation;
notwithstanding that calamity wherein the tyranny of the Turk has plunged
them. They have also a religious order amongst them, of S. Basil, the great
founder of the East Monks; and S. Benedict of the West. These only have their
vows of chastity and austerity, and may not marry, which to the rest of their
Clergy is not prohibited; they have also their proper habit, but shaven they
are not, for ought I could discern; no more are their Priests, being a
ceremony so bald, that some Priests in France are ashamed of the mark, and few
of them have it that can hansomly avoid it. But as in the multitude of their
religious orders, they differ much from the West Church, the Grecians having
only this order of S. Basil, and the Latins having multiplied therein to
greater store and variety, then are professions in a common wealth, or trades
in a city, so also in their use and course of life. For the Roman monks by
withdrawing them selves from the society of other men, and living and dying
within their Cells, do bereave the world of that benefit, and of that duty and
service wherein each man is bound to the behoof of other, alleging in place
thereof the blessings which by their assiduitie and fervor in prayer not
interrupted nor cooled by secular co^merceme^ts, nor drawn down upon the
world, do grow unto the Church, whereas the Grecians continue that more
approved institution of them by spiritual meditations, and exercises, and by
severitie to make themselves fitter to serve in the Church of God, in
ecclesiastical calling with exemplarie holiness. And accordingly their Prelates
and other principal priests are chose in many places out of one of their
order, and in greatest part these guides of their Church, have a wonderful
care, and are continually pricked with the motion of much fear and grief of
heart, lest their persecuted flock, gasping in helpelesse and comfortless
exreamitie of all misery, having famine of soul, and great blindness within,
for lack of a Pastor, and means to maintain them, without, seeing nothing
but triumphs over Christ, and scorners of his religion, insolences, and
violencies against their persons, oppressions, and extortions upon their goods,
rapines, and murderings upon the very souls of their children; (a case to be
bewailed with tears of blood by all Christian hearts that knew it, hearing the
only anchor and stay of there souls (which is the expectation of the coming
of Christ, and of future salvation) daily derided and blasphemed by the pride
of the mighty. And finally, seeing no shadow of any hope of deliverie from
this calamity, (under the burden whereof they groan) should in the end fall
away, and revolt to Turcisme, inviting them thereunto with so many baits of
pleasures, of freedom, and of worldly glory. In which fearefulnes of mind,
the only remedy remaining, is the vertuousnes of their own example, in
constancy and patience, and avoiding of all scandal to their people, which is
the cause that they will not hear of any reformation of any thing: not, I
suppose, for any presumption or obstinacy of mind, as disdaining reformation,
but all trembling at alteration which must needs accompany it, least their
people perceiving how they had bin amiss in something, might suspect the
possibility of like error in the whole, and fall mainly vvhither the force of
power, and vvorldly prosperity (a chief argument to the vulgar mind) should
sway them: and on the other side, their doubt of further exasperating the Turk
in his cruelty against them (considering that in Greece and in all those parts
of Europe, the Christians under the Turk, do very manifoldly exceed in
number the Mahometitians themselves) may be a cause, why in their general they
hold so small intelligence, and correspondence with the West Church of one side
or other, and are like to continue so, whilst their thraldom and cause of that
fear shall last, though in their particular, they will declare a brotherly
affection of both, and desire of the unity of all in one truth. But for the
Turk himself, he makes full account, that whenever the West Christians
should shortly invade him, these Christians under him would run to their
aid, if they saw any likelihoode that they should prevail. And this has
been seen already more then once by example, and he provideth accordingly.

The Moscovites are a great Church, a free and puissant, not Schismatics from
the other Grecians (as some in disgrace Moscovites.
of both deliver) though, perhaps, not co^curring fully in all points, neither
is it true which other of a contrary co^ceipt have rumored, that the Patriarch
of Constantinople had removed his Seat to Mosco, whither he went, only to erect
that See into an Archbishopricke, which before it was not, and returned. But
the Turk to keep the Moscovits from stirring against him, causes the
Tartarians to make often incur sions and roads into their country, that so
being held always in awe on one side, they may have less stomach on the other
to embrace any thoughts or dessignes of interprising or combining with other
Christians against him. It were needless now to enter into any view of their
lives, neither could it serve either way to their honor, or reproach of their
Religion and government, being maimed, interrupted, or stopped in his operations,
of what quality soever, through his tyrany, who strives to plant barbarousnes
among them, as knowing, that neither civilitie founded his Empire, nor with
civilitie could it long continue. But the case is general, and experience shows
it in all places, that the afflicted in all religions, how contrary soever,
are, for the most part, men of conscience and honesty, save only where hopes
draw other humors to them. For it cannot come from less than a virtuous
affection, to prefer the sincerity of conscience before worldly glory,
howsoever it may be stained with erroneous opinions: as on the contrary side
even the purest religion in prosperity draws it to an infinity of timeseruers,
who being trained up in the exactions of cup discipline, make their Randevous
where the best cheer is stirring, and follow Christ upon a sharp devotion, but
to his bread, not to his doctrine. In which regard, the fruits of life in
diverse religions and governments are not to be compared, but where their
prosperity and adversity are equal; So falls it out in this particular we now
speak of, where the Grecian who is counted by the corruption of his country, to
be naturally a crafty merchant, a seditious person in all kinds of government,
is now become humble, obedient, and peaceable; and at divine service gives show
of more devotion than the Romanist in any place, for ought I have yet seen.
But the lamentable calamity of this afflicted and distressed Church once
flourishing in all worldly glory (now such as it has pleased the wild bore to
leave it) is able to dissolve a marble heart into streams of tears, and causes
me, in true sense of compassion of their misery, to wish with the humble
petition of a mind pierced with grief, to the just Judge of the world, redeemer
of mankind, and savior of his people, to cast down his pitiful eyes upon
them; to behold on one side his triumphing fierce enemies persecuting without
measure; on the other, his poor servants trodden down and persecuted without
help, hope, or comfort; to dissolve the pride and power of the one, to comfort
the astonished and wasting weakness of the other, with some hope of succor and
final delivery; to inspire the hearts of Christian Princes, (their neighbors)
compounding or laying aside their endless and fruitless conte^tions, to
revenge their quarrel against their unjust oppressor; to deliver now, at
length, the Church of that bane, the world of that ignominy, mankind of that
mo^ster of Turkish tyranny, that has too long reigned and laid the earth
desolate: A small thing were it, if this revenue and treasure were only
supplied and maintained out of their goods and labors, or if their bodies and
lives were only wasted and worn out in his works and slaueries, it might be
suffered, for goods are transitory, and death the end of all worldly miseries:
But to be forced to pay a tribute also of souls to his Mahomet, to have their
dearest children snatched out of their bosoms, to be brought up in his impious
abomination, and to be employed in murdering them that begat them, and in
rooting out of the faith, wherein they were borne and baptized, and which only
were able to bring their souls into happiness. This surely is a calamity
insupportable, and which cries out unto God in the heavens for relief. How
long shall that hateful name of that cursed seducer vpbraid the glorious and
lovely name of our Savior? How long shall his falsehood insult over our faith?
how long shall his barbarism oppress our civility, and his tyranny affront
the true honor of all lawful government? but how long soever, this stands firm
for ever, that the judgments of God are just, and directed in his sharpest
chasticeme^ts to the benefit of the world and instruction of men, and sound to
us: that if those people amongst which our Savior himself co^versed, at what
time his beautiful steps honored this world, with those Churches which his
Apostles so industriously planted, so carefully visited, so tenderly cherished,
instructed, and confirmed, by so many peculiar Epistles, and for whom they sent
up so many servent prayers; yea, to whom are remaining those particular letters
which the spirit of the highest indicted in the very heavens, and sent down
unto them. Aforewarning of that plague which is since befallen them, if besides
these spiritual prerogatives and graces, the puissance and glory of the great
empire of the world; the christian empire of Rome being translated unto them,
and seated in their lap and with promise of perpetuity to their present
prosperity, such then was the strength thereof: Notwithstanding when they fell
away from their first zeal and charity, when knowledge, the right mother of
humility, made them swell, when they envied each others graces, which they
ought to have loved, when abou^dance of all things bred wantonness instead of
thankfulness. In fine, when they forgot the Author of all their bliss, and fell
to snarling and biting one another, insteade of putting up and forgiving of
offenses, if not for the name of Brotherhood, yet for his sake, who was father
and equal lord of both: it pleased God to suffer a base thief and a wicked,
with a train of vagabondes (to the eternal reproach of all their wisdom and
policy) to advaunce himself so by his industry and their security, and to
grow to such an height in his successors and folowers, as to be a terror and
amazement to all the world, and to themselves an inexplicable and vnsuccorable
calamity to strip them of all those graces and blessings which ungratefulness
would not acknowledge, pride and wantonness did abuse: And to heap on the^ as much
misery, as the cruelty of a barbarous and merciless tyrant can infflict upon
such as have no means to appease him, save their calamity alone, or to
withstand him, besides their patience, then surely we who come short of them
so far in pledges of favor, and equal them in our faults, And they who have
had in particular the like threatening caveats of cutting off: notwithstanding
the virtues of their honorable ancestors* may think it high time to enter
into a more serious cogitation of their ways, to turn all their policies and
contentio^s against others, into an humble and sincere examination of our
selves, that repentance and amendment may prevent those punishments which our
wickedness has deserved, and obstinacy now highly does provoke.

58 It remains that I should proceed to the churches reformed, of which there
are many things also to be said; But my length in my former (drawn on by
multitude and variety of matter still freshly presenting it self contrary to
my intention) does cause me to defer the rest till some other occasion. In
the mean while it does humbly and gladly submit it self to be censured and
controlled by those of wisdom, experience and judgment. For howsoever, I
have waded herein with that vprightnes of mind, which becomes a lover and
searcher of truth: And have also to my best, avoided that ras^nes and lightness
in belief, which they that are subject unto, shall swallow down many a
morcell, which will fill them with wind insteade of good juice and
nourishment: yet viewing on the other side in such a multitude at this day,
perhaps with like integrity, equal warines, more diligence, and manifoldly
more means of certain informations, have delivered either histories, or other
particular relations, how few there are that have not stumbled upon many an
error, where they thought was nothing but plain ground and truth: I cannot
have any affiance or presumption of my good fortune, as to hope to be the man
alone that should hit truth in all things, But rather as foreseeing almost an
impossibility of not often erring in matter.

FINIS.
