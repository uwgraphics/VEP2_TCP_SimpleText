the eleventh of the Apocalips) calling all the estates of men to the right
path of their vocation, wherein are contained x^i. lessons to twelve several
estates of men, which if they learn and follow, al shall be well and nothing

The voice of one criyng in the deserte.

Luke. iii. Make ready the Lords way. Make his paths strayte. Every valey

be crooked shall be made straight and hard passages shall be turned into plain
ways, and al flesh shall se the health of God.

WHo so would that all things were well,
And would himself be without blame:
Let him give ear, for I will tell,
The way how to perform the same.
First walk in thy vocation,
And do not seek thy lotte to change:
For through wicked ambition,
Mani men's fortune has been strange
The Beggars lesson.
IF God have laid his hand on the,
And made the low in all men's sight:
Content thy self with that degree,
And se thou walk therein upright.
If thou I say, be very poor,
And lack thine health, or any limme:
No doubt God has enough in store.
For the if thou wylt trust in him.
If thou will trust in him I say, Esai. xl.

And continue in patience:
No doubt he will feed the always,
By his merciful providence.
Call thou on him, and he will move,
The hertes of the^ that dwell the bye:
To give the such things for his love
As serve for thy necessity.
When Daniel was in the den
Dani. xiiii.
Of Lions, having naught to eat:
Abacucke was sent to him then,
With a pot of potage and meat.
iii. Reg. xvii.
And when Elias fled away,
From Ahab and queen Iesabell:
The Ravens fed him by the way,
As the story of kings does tell.
Psalm. cxlvii.
And as king David does record,
The Ravens birds left in the nest:
Are when they cry fed of the Lord
Though they know not to make request
Trust thou therefore in God above,
And call on him with confidence:
Psa. xxxii.
And doubtless he will men's hertes move
To feed the of benevolence.
But if at any time thou lack,
Hebru. xii. Apoca. iii.
Things nedeful, yet do not despair:
As though the Lord did the fo^sake,
Or did to the displeasure beat.
But in such case call to thy mind
What plenty God has to the sent
Tob. xiii.
And thou shall well perceive and find
That thou shall many things misspent.
Then think Gods justice could not leave
The vnplaged for that thou have:
Sapi. x
Mispente the gifts thou did receive,
To live upon and not to waste.
The^ must thou needs give god glory,
For his upright and just judgment: Luke. xv.

And be most earnestly sorry,
For that thou have his gifts misspent.
But if thou find thy conscience clear
As few men can I am right sure:
Then let Jobs trouble be thy chere,
That thou may patiently endure,
Yea though thou should peri^he for fode Luke. xiiii. Math. v. Psa ix.

Yet be are thy cross patien^ely:
For the end shall turn to thy good,
Though thou lie in the streates and dye.
Pore Lazarus died at the gate,
Of the rich man (as Luke does tell) Luke. xvi.

But afterward in rest he sat
When the rich glutton was in hell.
S^ay thou thy self therefore upon
These examples confortable: Mat. xi.

And doub^les thy vocation
Thou shall not think miserable
Neith^r shall thou grudge or repyne,
That thy poverty is so great:
But shall thy self ever incline,
To Gods will who does the viset.
Thou shall not grudge, when you doeste crave
Of any man his charity:
Though at his hand thou can naught have
But shall pray for him hertely.
That if he have this worldely riches,
And yet has not Godly pitye.
The spirit of God will him possess: i Iho. v.

Math. xxii Luke. xx. Act x. Romans ii.
And teach him to know his duty.
Thus doing thou do walk vpryght
In thy calling thou may be sure:
And art more preciouse in Gods sight,
Then men that be rich paste measure.
Thus leave I the in thy calling,
ii. Timo. ii. Tob. iii.
Exhorting the therein to stand:
And doubtless at thy last ending,
Thou shall be crowned at Gods hand.
The Servants lesson.
BRother come hither unto me,
And learn some part of discipline:
For I am sent to enstruct the,
And teach the some Godly doctrine.
I am sent to call the I say,
Back from thy stout and stubburne mind:
Take heed therefore, and bear away
Such lessons as thou shall here ^inde.
First considre that thy calling,
Is to do service and obey:
Luke. xvii.
All thy masters lawful biddynge,
Bearinge that he shall on the lay.
If he be cruel unto the,
And over charge the with labor:
Call to the Lord, and thou shalt be,
Shortly out of his cruel power.
Remember thou Jacobs kynred,
That in Egypt were sore oppressed:
But when they were most hard bested, Exodus i.

The Lord brought them to quiet rest.
They could not cry so sone but he,
Had heard and granted their request: Exodus i. iii.

And right so will he do by the,
And se all thy great wrongs redrest.
He will I say deliver the,
Out of bondage and servitude.
And bring to pass that thou shall be, Math. xxv.

Master of a great multitude.
And because thou did walk upright
Showing thy self obedient:
Thy servants shall have still in sight, Math. vii. and.xiiii.

The fear of God omnipotent.
And like service as thou have done,
Thou shall have done to the again:
For sense the world was first begone
Never true servant lost his pain.
Jacob served full fourtene year,
And dea^t truly with his master:
As in the Bible does appear, Gene. xxi^.

And was exceadinge rich after.
Fourtene year he served Laban,
Who was made rich by his labor:
But afterward Jacob began,
To grove to much greater honor,
Laban was never of such might
As Jacob was within short space:
For his true service in Gods sight,
Had purchased him favor and grace.
Thus see thou how god does regard
The good service of servants true
And how he does in them reward
The service that is but their due.
It forces not what manner man
1 Petre. ii.
Thy master is, so that thou be:
In thy service a christian,
Doing as Christ commands the.
But if thy master be wicked,
And would have the do wyckedly:
Then se that thy faith be pitched
On thy Lord God most constauntly
Call to thy mind good Daniel,
Who served his prince fayethf^lly
Notwithstanding he was cruel
And eke his Lord Gods enemy.
Serve him truly I say, for why,
God has bade that thou sholdest do so:
But do thou nothing wickedly,
Neither for well nor yet for woe.
Se thou serve him as faithfully,
As he were thy Lord, and thy God:
^olo. iii. Ephe. vi.
Not with eye service faynedly,
Neither for the fear of the rod.
But for the conscience thou do bear,
To thy Lord Gods commandment.
That is for love, and not for fear,
Of any worldely punishmente.
Do thus and then thou shall be sure,
Thy Lord will ever prospere the:
And at his good will and pleasure,
Thou shall not miss to be made fre.
But if thou will be still sturdy,
And do thy service with grudging:
The Lord shall ^lage the worthily,
With manifold kinds of scourginge.
Thou shall be put to drudgery,
Many a day^, ma grea thine head:
And be kept still in slavery,
Al thy life days till thou be dead.
And if thou chance to renew away,
Either thou shall be brought again:
Or else when thou do chance to stay,
A worse master shall the retain.
Once thou ^halt be certain of this,
Tha^ if thou ref^se thy calling:
Of misery ^hou ^halte not miss,
Th^^gh thou esca^e sudden fallinge.
Yea though thou do prospere a while
And se^^e to have fortune thy friend:
Yet thou do but thy self begile,
For misery shall be thine end.
For as thou did thy master serve,
So shall al thy servants serve the:
And as thou did his goods preserve
So shall thy goods preserved be.
And beside this Gods wrath is bent,
Toward the for disobedience:
Wherefore unless thou do repent
He will add thereto vehemence.
He will plage the here wonderously,
And at the end cast the in pain:
Where thou shall lie eternally,
And wys^he to be a slave again.
Repent therefore, I the advice,
And seek thine own salvation:
And then thou must in any wise
Walk still in thy vocation.
Do thy service diligently,
And show no disobedience:
Be thou not stout, but still apply,
And do all things with reverence.
Refuse nothing that must be done,
But do it with all redines:
And when thou have it once begone.
Then set a side all slouthfulnes.
Be true, trustye, and trifle not,
Be gentle and obediente:
And blessyng shall light on thy lot,
For doing Gods commaundem^nt.
To make an end have still in mind,
Thine estate and condition:
And let thine heart be still enclinde,
To walk in thy vocation.
The Yeomans lesson.
THou that art borne the ground to till,
Or for to labor with thine hand:
If thou wylt do naught that is ill,
Desire not idle for to stand.
But se thou do plowe, plant, and sow,
And do thy nedeful business:
As one that does his duty know
And will not the Lords will traunsgres.
For what do thou if thou desire,
To be a lord or gentilman:
Other then heap on the Gods ire,
And show thy self no christian?
For Christ's sheep do hear his voice
Which bids the work busily: John. x. Exodus xx.

Six days, and in the seventh rejoice
And give somewhat to the neady.
It does also bid the beware,
Of the desire to be alofte:
For he that does for honor care,
Falls in Satan's snares full often.
Have mind therefore thy self to hold
With^^ the bosides of thy degree:
And then thou may ever be bold
That God thy lord will prosper the.
And though the Lord give the plenty
Of corn, cattle, and other thing: Prou. xxiii. Psalm. lxii.

Be thou never the more gredy
Nor set thy mind on gatheringe.
But think the Lord does these things send
To the as to his stuard true:
That wilt not his goods wast and spend,
But bestow the^ where they be due.
And if with thy labor thou get
Money much more then thou do need:
Do not thy mind on raiment set
Neither on deuity fode to feed.
Set not (I say) thy mind on pride,
Neither upon deliciouse fare:
Neither forget at any tide,
To give the pore that thou may spare.
But when thou have sufficient,
i. Timo. vi.
Of fode and honest apparaile:
Then hold thy self therewith content
As with the wage of thy travail.
The rest if ought remain unspent,
Upon thine own necessity)
Bestow as he that has it sent,
Has in his word commanded the.
And if thou find not written there,
That thou may heap thy chest with gold
To bye great liuelode for thine heir.
Ho^e dare thou then be so bold.
How dare thou be bold I say,
To heap up so much go^lde in store:
Out of the due that thou should pay,
To them that be pore, sick and sore?
Psalm. v.
Woe be to them sareth Esai,
That heap together horse and Land:
As m^n that wo^lde never find stay,
Til all the earth were in their hand.
What, will ye dwell alone (sareth he)
Upon the earth that is so wide?
Will you leave no part thereof fre
From your vnsacrable pride?
Ye need not to be so gready,
For the Lord does you plainly tell:
That great houses shall stand empty,
And no man left therein to dwell.
And Moses says that thou shall build
Houses and never dwell therein: Deu. xxviii.

Thy self nor leave them to thy child.
Nor any other of thy kynne.
And why? because thou have no mind
To keep the lords commandment.
But sekest ever for to find.
Ways to increase thine yearly rent.
No manner threatnynge can the let.
From purchasinge the deuel and all
It is all fyshe that comes ^oner.
To ma^ntayne thy great pride with all
Well turn again ^ the advice.
And I ^iue to walk in thine estate:
And set gods fear before thine eyes.
Lest when thou would it be to late.
And have in thy mind evermore,
This rule of thy profession: i. Cor. vii.

Which is in deed gods holy lore.
To walk in thy vocation.
But if the Lord do the not bless.
In thy labors with g^eate plenty
Yet thank thou him never the less.
Thou have more then thou art worthy.
If thy Landlorde do raise thy rent
Se thou pay it with quietness:
And pray to God omnipotent,
To take from him his cruelnes.
So shall thou heap coals on his head
And purchase to thy self great rest.
By the same man thou shall be fed,
By whom thou wast before oppressed
For God who rules each man's heart,
Shall turn thy Landlordes heart I say:
And shall al his whole life convert
So that he shall be thy great stay.
Or else if he be not worthy,
To be called to repentance:
No doubt thy Lord will him destroy,
Or take from him his heritaunce.
Sure thou shall be he will the set
Fre from thy Landlordes tyranny:
For he did never yet forget
Any that walked orderly.
But if thou will needs take in hand
Th^ne own wrong for to remedy:
The Lord him self will the wtstande,
And make thy Landlord more gredye.
And where before thou paiedst great re^t
Thou shall now lose thy house and al:
Because thou could not be content
With patience on him to call.
In like sort, if thy prince will take,
More tribute the^ thou can well spare:
Se thou pay it him, for Gods sake,
Whose officers all princes are. Math. xii.

For in his need boeth thou and thine,
Are his to maintain his estate:
It is not for the to define,
What great charges thy king is at.
Yea though thou se evidently,
That he wastes much more then need:
Yet pay thy duty willyngely,
And doubtless God shall be thy mede.
Now touching thy religion,
If thy prince do command the ought:
Against Gods Euangelion,
Then pray for him still in thy thought.
Pray for him still, I say that he
May have Godly understanding:
To teach Gods word to such as be,
Committed to his gouerninge.
And se thou do not him despise,
But answer him with reverence:
And though you might, yet in no wise,
Do thou forget obedience.
Take not his swerd out of his hand,
But lay thy neck down under it: Romans xiii.

(Yea, though thou might his force wtstande)
For so to do for the is fit. Math. xxvi.

Thy master Christ has taught you well
When he would no resistance make:
Neither against ^he powers rebel
When men were sent him for to take.
Yet if the Lord have given to the
Such knowledge that thou art certain
Of thy fayeth knowing it to be
Of the truth do therein remain.
For though man may thy body kill
Yet ought thou not him to fear:
M^t x.
For he can do thy soul none ill.
Wherefore be bold, do not despair.
Behold I say Christ to confess
Without fear of this worldly pain.
For when thou shall be in distress
Mat. x.
Christ shall acknowledge the again.
Christ shall acknowledge the I say
If thou conquer by sufferyng:
Luke. xxi.
And do thy self hereupon stay,
That thou must walk in thy calling
But if thou do lyf^e up thy sword
Against thy king and Sovereign:
Math xxvi
Then art thou judged by Gods word,
As worthy therewith to be slain.
Yea, thou may not grudge or repine
Against thy king in any wise
Though thou should se^^laine with thine
Tha^ he were wicked past al sise ^eyen
For it is God tha^ appoynteth,
Kings and rulers over the route:
^roue. viii.
And with ^is power he auoynteth
Them for to be obeyed ^o doubt
^^. x^x.
If they be euel, then think thy sin,
Deserves that plage at Gods hand:
And se thou do forth with begin
Thine own wyckednes to withstand.
Corah and dathan did Rebel, Nom. xvi.

And thought yt they them selves could point
A better priest in Israel,
Then Aaron whom god did annoynte
But what came of their fantasy?
Was not destruction their end?
God did destroy them suddenly
Because they would his works eme^de.
Let this example suffice the.
To keep them obedience
To such as god shall set to be
Over the in preeminence.
If thou do th^s, thou shall besure
That god thy lord will ever se
That though thy rulars be not pure
Yet they shall ever defend the.
Contrary wise, if thou Rebel.
Be sure the lord will the destroy
Which thing has been declared well.
Within this realm very lately.
For notwithstanding that our king
And eke our rulars euerychone
Be merciful in their doing
Yet have the Rebels cause to move.
And why? because no rebels shall
Escape gods hand unpunished
For god him self does princes call
His Christ's and his anointed.
Who so therefore does them resist
Roma. xiii.
The same resists God certain
For god him self does them assist
Against them over whom they reign.
If thou therefore find the grieved
With men set in authority.
Seek not thou to be avenged
Eccle. xxviii.
But let God take vengeance for the.
Let me take ve^gaunce (says the lord)
Romans xii.
And I will pay them al their hyre
Do thus, and scripture does record
That thou shall have all thy desire.
Thou shall have thy desire, I say
Upon the wicked maiestrate
If thou wylt keep thy self always
Within the bounds of thine estate,
Thus leave I the, with threatenyng
To the thy souls damnation
If thou mislikynge thy calling
Wylt needs chayng thy vocation.
The lewd or vnlearnned priests lesson.
THou that art lewd without learning
Whom commonly men call sir John,
Give care for I will say somethynge
Concerning thy vocation.
Thou art a man void of knowledge
And eke of all good qualities
Only mete for to diche and hedge
Or else to plant and gra^se men's tres.
Thou art not as you would be calde
An offerar of sacrifice
^or though thy cro^ne were.iiii. times balde
Yet can you not so bear our eyes.
For it is plain in holy write
That none can offer sacrifice Hebru. ^^

For sin, either in flesh or spirit
Though he be both learned and wise.
For Christ was once offered for all
To satisfy for all out sin
And has made fre that erst were thrall
The faithful floke of Iacobes kin.
To offer sacrifice therefore
Thou art not called I tell the plain
For Christ lives for ever more Romans vi.

And can no more for us be slain.
Thy state therefore and thy calling
Is none other b^t for to wyrcke Gene. iii. ^oh. v.

And not to live by forstalling.
And name thy self one of the kyrcke
If thou therefore wylt live for aye
And reign with Christ for ever more
Desire no more masses to say
But get thy fode with labor sore. Exh^. iiii.

Give over all thy typpillinge
Thy tavern gates, and table play.
Thy cards, thy dice and wine bibbling Eph^. ^.

And learn to walk a sober way.
And if thou have any liueing
i. Timo iiii.
So that thou nedest not to labor
Se thou apply the to learning
With al diligent endeavor.
But to this end se thou study
That when thou have the truth learned
Thou maiste profit other thereby
Whom in time past thou have harmed.
And se thou go not Idly
From house to house to seek a place
To say men a Mass secretly
Their favor thereby to purchase.
Put not the ignorant in hope
That they shall se al up again
That has been brought in by the Pope
And all the preachars put to pain.
But if thou can do any good
In teaching of an A. B. C.
A primer or else Robinhede
Let that be good pastime for the*
Be ever doing what thou can
Teaching or learning some good thing
And then like a good Christian.
Thou do walk forth in thy calling.
But if thou wylt knoweledge reiecte
And al honest labors refuse
Then art thou none of gods elect
Romans ^vi.
But art worsse then the cursed Jews.
Repent therefore I the advice
And take wholesome counsel by time
And take good head in any wise
That knowledge double not thy crime.
Thus leave I the, making promise
To make for the peticion
That thou may leave the popishnes
And walk in thy vocation.
The Scholars lesson.
COme hither young man unto me
Thou that art brought up in learning.
Give ear a while, I will teach the.
How thou shall walk in thy calling.
First mark wherefore schools were erect
And what the foundars did intend
And then do thy study direct
For to attain unto that end.
Doubtless this was al their meaning
To have their contrie furnished.
With all kinds of honest learning,
Whereof the public wealth had need.
Call thou therefore to memory,
What knowledge thy country does:
And apply the same earnestly,
By all the means that thou can make lack
And when thou art determined
What knowledge thou will most apply
Then let it not be loytered,
But seek to get it spedily.
Spend not thy time in Idleness.
Nor in vain occupacyon
But do thy self wholely address
To walk in thy vocation.
Se thou do not thy mind so set
On any kind of exercise:
That it be either stay or let
To thy study in an wise.
To fyshe, to foul, to hunt or halke
Or on an instrument to play
And some whiles to comune and talk
No man is able to gain say.
To shore, to bawle, or cast the bar
To play reuise or toss the ball
Or to ^enne base like men of war
Shall hurie thy study naught at al.
For all those things do recreate
The mind if thou canste hold the mean
But if thou be affectionate
Then doste thou lose thy study ^eane.
And at the last thou shall be found
To occupye a place only
As do in Ag^^me ziphras round.
And to hinder learning greatly
For if thou had not the lyueyng
An other should that would apply
Him self to some kind of learning
To profit his country thereby.
If thou therefore will not be found
Worthy gods indignation
Make thy study perfect and sound
And walk in thy vocation.
Let not time pass idelly
Lose not the fruit of any hour
Or else suffer him to supply
Thy place that will him endeavor
Thou do but rob ye co^mone wealth
Of one that would be a treasure
Better thou were to live by stelth
Then for to work such displeasure,
But happily thou will say again
Shall I surrender my living?
Shall I not thereupon remain
After I have gotten learning?
Yesse thou may keep thy liueyng still
Till thou be called otherwise
But if thou wylt regard gods will Luke. xix.

Thou must thy self still exercise.
When thou art thoroughly learned
Then se thou teach other thy skyll
If thou wylt not be reconed
For a seruau^at wicked and Ill Luke. xix.

Teach them, I say, that thou do se
Wyllinge to learn thy discipline
And unto them se thy life be
A book to lay before their eine.
Let them never se the Idle
Nor hear the talk indiscreetly
And by all the means possible
Let all thy doings edifye.
Romans ^iiii.
Th^s leave I the, wyshinge that thou
May by this admonition
Hensf^rth desire (as I do now)
To walk in thy vocacion.
The learned man's lesson.
THou learned man, do not disdain,
To learn at me a simple might
Thy g^eate abuses to refrain
And in thy calling to walk right.
Thou art a man that sit hie
In the simple men's conscience
To live therefore dissolutely
Thou should be unto them offense.
Offense, I say, for they should think
All that thou do to be godly
Wherefore do not at this thing wyncke
But do emend it spedely
Emend thy wicked life I say
And be (in deed) a perfect light
As Christ our savior does say
Math. v.
And let thy works shine in men's sight
For it is thy vocation
i. Corh. i^.
To lead other the ready way
How great abominacion
Art thou then if thou go astraye?
But therein lies the whole matter
To know which way you should them lead
Wherefore I will the not flatter
But tell the truth wythouten dread.
Thou must thy self humiliate,
And acknowledge thy wicked sin Math, vii.

And strive to enter the strait gate
Where few men do find away in
This way thou can not walk so long
As thou wylt travail sea and land
And frame all the words of thy tongue
To get promocion at man's hand.
Thou must humble thy self I say
And not aye seek to be alost,
For he that walks in rough way
And looks hie, stumbleth full often.
Thou must acknowledge that you art
Through sin unworthy thine estate
And that thy discipline and art
Can not bring them at that gate.
Thou must, I say, strive to enter
And not to get promotion
Thy life thou must put in venture Ihon. x.

For Christ's congregation.
How do thou walk in this calling
When thy mind is earnestly bent:
To gather up each man's falling,
By all the ways thou canste invent?
Give ear I say, therefore thou fool,
And learn thy first lesson again:
Enter into Gods holy schole. Math vii

And do not his docrtyne disdain.
He wylleth the first to apply
uke. vi.
Thy mind to knoweledge and to take
The great beam out of thine own eye
And thine abuses to forsake.
And then he would that in no wise
Thou should be stacke or negligent
To pycke the motes out of men's eyes
Teaching them how they should repent
If thou wylt that they do repent
Tite. ii.
Repent thou first, that they may see
That the whole some of thine intent
Is to make them like unto the.
For if thou wylt them to refrain
Murder, thesse, whoredom and Incest
If they se thief things in the raygne
They will all thy doctrine deteste.
If thou forbid them gluttony
And will them the flesh for to tame
They myll defy the utterly
If they se the not do the same.
If thou tell them of apparayle
Or of ought wherein is excess.
Then will they say, thou do but rail
Unless thou be therein faltnesse.
What should thou speak of usury,
When thou do take unlawful gain?
Or rebuke men for Simonie.
When nothing else does in the raygne
May not the lay man falsely say,
I learned of the to by and sell,
Benefices, which to this day
Thou can put in practice full well?
Why should not I, as well as thou
Have benifices two or three?
Sense thou have taught me the way how
I may keep them and blamlesse be?
I can set one to serve the cure
That shall excel the in learning
More then thou do me I am sure
And also in godly lyueynge:
I can keep hospitalitye
And give as much unto the pore
In one year as thou do in three
And will perform it with the more
Alas that ever we should se
The flock of Christ thus bought and sold
Of them that should the shepperdes be.
To lead them falsely to the fold.
Repent this thing I the advice
And take the to one cure alone
And se that in most faithful wise
Thou walk in thy vocation.
Then shall no lay man say by right
That he learneth his mysse of the
For it is plain in each man's sight
That thou do walk in thy degree.
More over, if thou chance to be
Made a prelate of high estate
To thine office lo^^e that thou se
And lea^e not thy flock desolate.
And first before all other things
Timo. v.
Seek thou to find good ministers
And appoint them honest lyueynges
To be the peoples enstructers.
Let none have care within thy See
In whom any great vice does raygne
Timo. v.
For where mysslyueyng curates be
The people are not good certain.
zach. xxxiii.
And for them all that do perish
Through thy defalte, thou shall answer
Wherefore I do the admonish
To look ernestly to this gear.
Look unto it thy self I say
And trust not to a trifellar
That will allow all that will pay
Son what unto the regester.
Se that they do enstructe the youth
Of each parri he diligently
And train them up in the lords truth
So much as in their power shall lie.
Now if so be thou be called
To be thy princes counselor
Be ware thou be not corrupted
By the vain desire of honor.
Be not careful how for to hold
Thy self still in authority
But to speak truth be ever bold
According to gods verity.
Wyncke not at faltes that thou shall se
Though it be in thy Sovereign
But do as it becomes the
Exhort him al vice to refrain.
If thou perceive him ignorant
In any point of his duty
Se thou do him not check or taunt
But tell him with sobriety.
Tell him his falt, I say, plainly.
And yet with al submission,
Lest thou do seem to speak vainly.
For getting thy vocation.
Thus have I told the as I would
Be told if I were in thy place.
To the intent that no man should
Have cause to tell the to thy face.
Thus do I leave the with wyshynge
To the a will for to advance
Gods glory by godly learning
And not thy lyueyng to enhaunce.
The Physicians lesson.
Give ear master Physician,
And set a side thine vrinal:
And that with expedition
For I, the last trumpet do call
Give care I say, and mark me well.
And printe al my words in thy mind:
For each thing that I shall the tell
Thou shall both true and certain find.
God made the to succor man's need.
As Jesus Sirach wrytteth plain
^^^lt. xxxviii.
But by due proof we know in ded
That many thousands thou have slain.
But now am I sent from the king
Of power and domination
To call the from thy murtherynge
To walk in thy vocacion.
First, where thou dydest her to fore use
To have respect to the rich man
I would not now thou should refuse
To help the poor man if thou can.
Help him I say though it be poor
And has nothing wherewyth to pay
For his master has yet in store
Jacob. ii.
A crown for him at the last day.
And if thou do on him thy cure
For his sake yt ga^e herbs their strength
Thou shall undoubtedly be sure
He will rewa^de the a^ the length.
This master of his does regard
Mercy so much that he has told
Al his that they shall have reward
Matt. ix.
For geueynge water thin and could.
And thynkest thou that he will not
Reward them that give medicine?
Thou have no such mistrust I woe
In his promies that is divine.
I say therefore, if thou can cure
The pore man's so^e or malady
Of thy reward thou shall be sure
If thou wylt show on him mercy,
But if thou suffer him to lack
Thine healpe because he lacks goulde
No doubt when thou shall a count make
Thy confidence shall be full cold.
Then show thy writting if thou can
Whereon thou bear the so bold.
That thou wylt viser no sick man
That cannon live thy pursse with gould
Bring forth thy writting then, I say
If thou have any such in store
Whereby thou may require each day
A noble of goulde, or else more.
And show by what right you may take
Two pense for the sight of water
When thou know not thereby to make
The sick man one farthyng better.
Yea if a man should try the well
To prove what thy cou^tyng can do
He should find that thou can not tell
Whether the man be sick or no.
I grant the water shows something
But not so much as thou do crake
Neither is thy labor condyngue
That thou should money for it take.
But if so be thou can espy.
By the water what is a mysse
Teach him how to seek remedy
And worthy some reward, that is.
But if thou do but guess, as does
The blind man that does cast his staff
Though thou by chance hit one the soth
Thy labor is scrase worthy crafe.
Thou do burgess money to wine
And with strange words make me^ aghast
And yet thou thynckest it no sin
To cause pore me^ their goods to wast.
But no^e I say to the, ^epent
And do thy self hensforth employe
To use the gift God has the sent
To the profyt of thy contrere.
Let not lucre make the profess
Before thy knowledge be perfect
For he that ministers by guess
Shall not so sone heal as infect.
Apply the earnestly therefore
To get phisickes perfection,
That thou may ease the sick and sore
And remedy infection.
And shut not up thine help from such
As stand in most need of the same:
And certes thou shalt gain as much
By them, as by men of great fame,
Math. xxvi. Luk^. x.
For God him self has promised
To make for them a recompense:
Wherefore doubt not to be paid,
Both for thy labor and expense.
But if thou will not take my read,
But follow after lucre still:
I will put the out of all dread,
Thy last reward shall be full ill.
For when cruel death shall the stynge,
And thy life from the separate:
Then shall thou se thou have nothing,
Thy silly soul to recreate.
Wherefore I must needs greatly fear
That in that extreme Agony:
Thou will of Gods mercy despair
And so perish eternally.
Take heed therefore, take heed by time
Let not slyppe this occasion:
But spedely repent thy crime,
And walk in thy vocation.
The Lawyers lesson.
NOw come hither thou manne of law,
And marcke what I shall to the say:
For I entende the for to draw,
Out of thy most ungodly way.
Thy calling is good and Godly,
If thou would walk therein arighte.
But thou art so passing gready,
That Gods fear is out of thy sight.
Thou climest so to be alofte,
That thy desire can have no stay:
Thou have forgotten to go soft
Thou art so hasty on thy way.
But now I call the to repent,
And thy gredines to forsake
For Gods wrath is against the bent
If thou wylt not my warning take.
First call unto thy memory
For what cause the laws were first made
And then apply the busily,
To the same end to use thy trade.
The laws were made undoubtedly
That all such men as are oppressed:
Might in the same find remedy
And lead their lives in quiet rest.
Do thou then walk in thy calling
When for to vex the innocent:
Thou wylt stand at a bar ballyng
With all the craft thou can invent?
I say ballynge, for better name,
To have it can not be worthy:
when like a beast without all shame
Thou will do wrong to get money
Thine excuses are known to well
Thou say thou know not the matter
Wherefore thou say thou can not tell.
At the first whose cause is better.
Thou know not at ye first I grant,
But why will thou be retained
Of plaintiff or defendaunt
Before thou have their cause learned?
For such a plea I blame the not,
When neither parties right is known
But when thou thy self do well wot
Thy client seaketh not her own
It were a Godly way for the,
To know the end ere thou began
But if that can by no means be
To make short suite do what thou can
If thou be a man's attorney
In any court where so it be:
Let him not wait and spend money
If his dispatch do lie in the,
Apply his matter earnestly
And set him going home again,
And take no more then thy duty Luke. iii.

For God shall recompense thy pain.
If thou be calde a counsellar.
And many men do seek thy read:
Se thou be found no triffellar
Either for money or for dread
But weigh men's matters thoroughly,
And se what may be done by right
And further as well the neady
As thou wo^ldest do the man of might
Se thou have no respect at all
To the person but to the cause
And suffer not such truth to fall, Leuit. xxx

As thou findst grounded on good laws
If any man do the desire
Him to defend in do^nge wrong
Though he wo^ld give the tri^le hire
Yet give none ear unto his song.
Fere not his power though he be king
A duke, an earl, a Lord, or kinght:
But evermore in thy doing
ii. Par. xxii.
Have the Lords fear present in sight.
If thou be judge in commune place,
In the kings bench, or Eschequier
Or other court, let not thy face
Be once turned to the bryber.
Beware yt bribes blind not thy sight
Deu. xvi. Eccle. xx.
And make the that thou can not se:
To judge the pore man's cause aryght,
When it is made open to the.
Why sholdest thou still admit delays,
In matters that be manifest,
Why do thou not seek all the ways.
That may be, to rid the oppreste
To thine office it does belong,
Leuiti. xix.
To judge as justice does require:
Though the party that is to strong
Would give the house and land to hire.
I have no more to say to the,
But warn the that thou be con^ente
To live only upon thy fee
Fearing the Lord omnipotent.
And for to se that no man wreste,
The laws to do any man wrong:
And that no poor man be oppreste,
Nor have his suite deferred long.
Now if thou be Lord Chauncelour,
As Censor over all the rest:
Se thou do thy best endeavor,
To se all open wrongs redrest.
And of this one thing take good head
That among them that do appeal:
Thou do not for favor or mede
Suffer any falselye to deal.
Beware of them I say that use,
First for to tempt the commune laws
And yet the judgment to refuse
When they be like to loss their cause,
Beware of them, and let them not
Abuse the court in any wise:
To weary such as by just lot
To claim their right do enterprise.
When they shall make peticion,
Examine them diligently:
And grant not an Iniunction
To each false harlot by and by.
Grant thou not an Iniunction
To him that does naught else entende:
But by subtyle invention
His own falsehode for to defend.
I n^de not to tell any more,
Of thy duty thou maiste it se:
In Gods sacret and holy sore
If thou wylt thereto apply the.
Thus leave I the thou man of law*
Wyshynge the to be as willing:
To follow as I am to draw
The back again to thy calling.
The Merchants lesson.
Now marcke my words thou
Marchaunte man,
Thou yt do use to bye and sell,
I will enstruct the if I can,
How thou may use thy calling well.
First se tho^ call to memory
The end wherefore al men are made
And then endeavor busily
To the same end to use thy trade.
The end why all men be create
As men of wisdom do agree
Is to main^ayne the public state
In the country where they shall be.
Apply thy trade therefore I say
To profit thy country wythal:
And let conscience be thy stay
That to polling thou do not fall.
If thou venture into strange lands,
And bring home things profitable:
Let pore me^ have them at thine hands.
Upon a price reasonable.
Though you may thy money forbear
Til other men's store be quire spente
Yet if thou do so that thy ware
May bear high price, you shall be shente
Thou shall be shent of him I say
That on the seas did prospere the
And was thy guide in all the way
That thou wentest in great ieopardye.
For he gave the not thy richesse,
To hurt thy country with all,
Neither gave he the good success
That thou sholdst therbi make me^ thral
But thy richesse was given to the
That thou might make provision:
In far contreys for things that be
Needful for thine own nation.
And when by Gods help you have brought
Home to thy co^try am good thing
The^ should you thank him that al wrought
For thy prosperouse returnyng.
Which thing thou can not do in deed,
Unless thou walk in thy calling
And for his sake that was thy speed
Content thy self with a living
But oh me think I write in vain,
To marchaunte men of this our time
For they will take no manner pain.
But only upon hope to clime.
So sone as they have ought to spare,
Beside their stock that must remain:
To purchase lands is all their care
And all the study of their brain.
There can be none unthrifty heir
Who^ they will not smell out anon
And handle him with words full fair
Til al his lands is from him gone
The fermes, the woddes, and pasture
That do lie round about London
Are hedged in within their mowndes, grounds
Or else shall be ere they have done
They have their spies upon each side
To se when ought is like to fall:
And as soon as ought can be spied,
They are ready at the first call.
I can not tell what it does mean
But white mea^e bears a great price
Which some me^ think is by the mean
That fermes be found such marcha^dice
For what is it when the poor man
That erste was wont to pay but lite
Must now needs learn (do what he ca^)
To play either double or quite?
If ye ask of the coliar
Why he sells his coals so dear:
And right so of the wodmongar
They say merchants have all in fere.
The wod (say they) yt we have bought
In times past for a crown of gold
We can not have if it be ought:
Under ten shyllynges ready told
I am ashamed for to tell,
Half the abuse that all men see:
In such men as do by and sell,
They be so bad in each degree.
I will therefore do what I can
To make plain declaration
How thou that art a merchant man,
May walk in thy vocation,
Apply thy trade as I have told,
To the profit of thy country
And then thou may ever be bold,
That thy Lord God will guide thy way
Thou shall not need to purchase lands
Neither to take leases in grounds
That when thou have the^ in thine hands
Thou may for shyllinges gather pounds
Thou shall nor need to bye or sell
Benefices which should be fre:
To true preachers of Gods gospel
To help the^ with that hel^les be.
No more shall thou need for to lend,
Thy goods out for unlawful gain
In such sort that by the years end,
Thou may of one shilling make twain Luke. v^

Thou shall aye have enough in store
For the and thine in thy degree:
And what should thou desire more,
Or of higher estate to be?
Let it suffice the to marye
Thy daughter to one of thy trade:
Why should thou make her a Lady
Or bye for her a noble ward?
And let thy sons euerychone
Be bound prentise years nine or ten
To learn some art to live upon
For why should they be gentilmen?
There be already men mow
That bear the name of gentil blood
Tell thou me then, what need have thou,
So vainly to bestow thy good?
^or thou can not promote thy son
But thou m^st bye him land and rent
Whereby some must neades be undone
To bring to pass thy fond intent.
Some man perchance, need does compel
To morgage his land for money
And will thou cause him for to sell,
The liuelode of his progeny?
Tell me if you would have thy son,
(If happily he should stand in need)
To be so served when thou art gone
Of merchants that shall the succed?
Do thou as thou would be done by
As very nature does the reach
Math. vii.
And let thy love and charity
Unto all the Lords creatures reach.
And if any man stand in need
Lend him freely that thou maiste spare
Luke. vi.
And doubtless god will be thy mede
And recompense the in thy ware
Math. v.
Be just, plain, and not deceitful,
And show mercy unto the pore:
And God that is most merciful
Shall evermore increase thy store.
And in the end when nature shall,
End thy peregrination:
Thou shall have Joy among them all,
That walk in their vocation.
But if thou do refuse to walk,
In thy calling as I have told
Thy wisdom shall be but vain talk,
Though thou be boeth ancient and old
Say what thou wylt for to defend
Thy walking inordinately:
Thou shall be certain in the end
To be damned eternally. Mat. vii.

For in the world there can not be
More great abomination
To thy Lord God, then is in the
Forsakynge thy vocation.
The Gentilmans lesson
THou that art borne to land and rent,
And art clipped a ge^tilman:
Give eat to me, for mine curent
Is to do the good if I can.
Thou art a man that God has set
To r^le the route in thy country,
Wherefore thou had need for to get Eccle. vii.

Good knowledge rather then money.
For ignorance shall not excuse
When all men shall give a rekeninge.
And the judge will money refuse Math. xvi. Romans ii.

And judge after each man's doing.
First I advertise the therefore,
And require the in Christ's name:
That of knowledge thou get the store,
And frame thy living to the same
Get the knowledge I say and then
Thou shall perceive thine own degree:
To be such that among all men,
Thou have most need learned to be.
Thou shall perceive you have no time
To spare and spend in banketyng
For though thou watch til it be prime,
Thou shall have enough to doing.
Thou shall not find any leisure
Math. xii
To dice, to card, or to revel:
If thou do once take a pleasure
In using thine own calling well.
For parckes of Dear thou shalt not care
Neither for costuous buildyng:
For apparel, or for fine fare
Or any other worldly thing.
Thy mind shall be still ravished
With the desire to walk upright.
And to se all vice punished,
So much as shall lie in thy might.
Thou shall delight for to defen^e
The poor man that is innocent:
And cause the wicked to emende,
And the oppressor to repent.
Thou shall have delight in nothing
Saving in doing thy duty:
Which is under God and thy king
To rule them that thou do dwell by.
Thou shalt not think yt thou may take
Thy rent to spend it at thy will
As one that should no recknyng make, Romans xiiii

For ought that he does well or ill.
But thou shall find yt thou art bound
And shall answer much more straightly Luke. xii.

Then the pore men that till the ground
If thou regard not thy duty.
Thou shall not find that thou may reise
Thy rent or leauy a great fine
More then has been used always
For that only is called thine.
For as thou do hold of thy king
So does thy tenant hold of the
And is allowed a lyueynge
As well as thou in his degree.
If thou therefore would not thy king
Should take of the more then his due
Why wylt thou debate the living
Of thy tenant and cause him rue.
For knoweledge will tell the that thou
Must^ do as thou would be done by Math. vii.

And right so will she tell the how
Thou maiste discharge all thy duty
She will teach the to be content
With that thou haste by heritage
And eke to live after thy ren^e
And not to fall into outrage.
If thou may dispende. xl^li,
Thou majesty not live after.lx.
Neither may thou enclose thy ground
That thou may make it yerly more.
For knowledge will teach the to seek
Other men's health more the^ thine own
And rather to feed on a leke
Then one house should be overthrown.
Thou shalt by her learn that you art
A father over thy country
And that thou ough^est to play the part
Of a father both night and day.
Thou shall by knoweledge understand
Psalm. lxxxii.
That thou must succor the neady,
And in their cause such men wtstand,
As show them selves over gready.
In fine knowledge that is Godly
Will teach the all that thou shall do
Belonging to thine own duty
And other men's duty also.
Get the knowledge I say therefore
That thou may be worthy thy name:
For without her thou may no more
Be calde a Ge^tilman for shame.
For without knowledge thou shall be
Of all other most out of frame:
Because there is nothing in the
That may thy lust chastise or tame.
Without knowledge, you wylt follow
Thy flesh and fleshly appetite:
And in the lusts thereof wallowe
Setting therein thine whole delight
Without knowledge you wilt oppress
Al men that shall be in thy power.
And when they shall be in distress
Thou wylt them cruelly devour
Without knowledge thou will araie
Both the and thine past thy degree
And eke maintain outragiouse play
Til thou have spent both land and fee.
To make an end, unless thou have
Knowledge remayninge in thy breast
Thou shall be worsse then a vile slave
That does al honesty detest.
Get the knowledge therefore I say,
And eke the fear of God above:
And let thy study be always
To know what thing does the behoue.
But first before all other things
Set the Lords fear before thy face: Psa. xxxiii.

To guide them all thy doings
That thou delight not in trespace.
For he that does delight in sin,
Shall never govern his life well:
Nor any Godly knoweledge wyn,
For wisdom will not with him dwell. Sapie. i.

Then seek for knowledge busily
And leave not of ty she be found
And when thou have her perfectly
To the Lords fear let her be bound
And let them two bear all the swea,
In thy doings early and late:
Let them agree and end their plea
Before thou do appoint the state.
By their advise survey thy Land
And keep thy courts does far and nere
And se they do fast by the stand,
In thine housekepynge and thy chere
Gave them present before thine eyes,
In all thy deeds what so they be:
In cessions and eke in assise,
Let them not be absent from the.
Let them rule al thy familye
And eke enstructe thy children young:
That they may thine office supply
When with his dart death has the stonge
And last of al, leave them to guide
Thy children and their families:
That thine house and stock may abide,
And r^le the route in godly wise.
No more to the have I to say,
But that thou keep Gods fear in sight
And make it the guide of thy way
As well by bright day as by night.
So doing I dare the assure
That in the end thou shall obtain:
The bliss that shall ever endure
With Christ our master for to reign.
The Maiestrates lesson
WHo so thou be that God does call
To bear the sword of punishemente.
Mark well my woo^des, and take the^ all
Accordyngly as they be meant.
When thou art in Authority
And have the bridle rain in hand
The^ be well ware that Tyranny
Do not get the within her band.
Look not upon thy sword always
But look some time on thy balaunce
And se that neither do decay
In the time of thy governance.
For, to punish with equity
Is and aye shall be bysemynge
Where as to ^ewe extremity
Is found rather a blood suckeynge.
If any man be accused
Se thou hear him indifferently
And let him not be punished
Till thou know his cause thorowli
If he have wrought against ye laws
So that i^stice would have him dye
Then ^n thy balaunce lay his cause
And judge him after equity
If he did it of ignorance,
Of need or by compulsion
Or else by fortune and by chance
Then must thou use discretion
Consider what extreme need is
And home force may the weak compel
And how fortune does hit and mysse
When the intent was to do well
And though the evidence be plain
And the accusares credible
Yet call to mind the elders twain
Dani. xiii.
That Daniell found reproueable
And if thou find them false or vain
Forged to work their brother ill
Then let them suffer the same pain
That he should have had by their will
Much might be said in this matter
Out of the works of writters old
And for to prove it the better
Many late stories might be told
But I leave this to the study
Of them that have had exercise
In judgment, in whose memory
It is as still before their eyes.
I thought mete to touch it only
That thou might have occasion
To call to mind the chief duty
Of thy state and vocation.
Which is to scanne the evidence
And eke to try the accusars all
Though they be men of good credence
Lest happily the just be made thral.
Moreover, it behooves the
If thou wylt walk in thy calling
To se that all good statutes be
Executed before all thing
For to what end do statutes serve
Or why should we hold parliamente
If men shall not such laws observe
As in that court we shall invent?
And what thing shall a realm decay
So sone as when men do neglecte
The wholesome laws, as who should say
They were in deed to none effect?
For in that realm the myghtie shall
Work after their fancy and will
For there the pore may cry and call
For help and be oppressed still.
Se thou therefore to thy duttie
In this behalf boeth day and night
And let none break such laws f^ely
But let the^ know yt laws have might
Let them all know I say that thou
Art set to minister justice
And that thou made thereto a vow
At the takeynge of thine office.
Wincke not at things yt be to plain
Lest godli knowledge fle the fro
And thou flyt into endless pain
At such time as thou must hense g^.
For if thou wylt not minister
Justice to them that do oppress
What are the people the better
For the, when they be in distress?
The heauenli housband man therefore
Who planted the vice to suppress
Shall dry thy ro^e for ever more
And give the up to wyckednes. Ihon. xvi

Be ware of this vengeance betyme
Lest it come on the suddenly
When you would feign repent thy crime
But shall dispere of gods mercy:
For what thing causes men dispeire
Of gods mercy at their last end
But their conscience that says they were
Told of their fault and would not mende.
If thou therefore do se this thing
And wilt wincke at it willingly
I say that when death shall the stinge
Thou shall dispeyre of gods mercy.
Yet have I more to say to the
Concerning thy vocacion
Which if it grow still must needs be
Double abhominacion.
For he that byeth, must needs sell
Thou know already what I mean
I need not with plain words to tell
If sin have not blinded the cleave.
Se unto it I the advice
And let not offices be sold
For god will punish in strait wise
Such as with him will be so bold.
He will not aye suffer his flock
Of wolfes to be so devoured
Neither shall they yt would him mock
Escape his hands unpunished.
Exo. xiiii.
His arm is as strong it was
When he plaged King Pharao
In Egypt, and can bring to pass
All that he lists now also.
He spent not all his power upon
The ^ynge Nabuchodonozer
He shall never be found such one Dani. iiii.

That he should not have might in store.
Take heed, take heed, I say therefore
That thou fall not into his hand
For if thou do thou art forlore
Thou can not be able to stand. Hebru. x.

Yet one thing more I must the tell
Which in no wise thou may forget
If thou wylt profess gods Gospel
And thine affraunce therein set.
Thou must not covet imperie
Nor seek to rule strange nations
For it is charge inoughe perdie
To answer for thine own commons.
Let thy study therefore I say
Be to rule thine own subjects well
And not to maintain wars always
And make thy contrei like an hell.
Let it suffice the to defend
Thy limits from invasion
And therein se thou do entende
Thine own peoples salvation.
For, mark this. If thou do invade
And get by force commodity
The same shall certainly be made
A scorge to thy posterity.
This have I said, to call the back
i. Reg. xiii.
From the Philistines station
Trusting thou will my counsel ta^
And walk in thy vocacion.
The woman's lesson.
WWho so thou be of woman kind
That lokest for salvation.
Se you have ever in thy mind.
To walk in thy vocacion
If thy state be virginity
And have none housband for to please
Then se thou do thy self apply
i. Cor. vii.
In christen manners to increase
If thou be under a mesties
Se thou learn her good qualities
And serve her with all redines
Haueyng gods fear before thine eyes
If thou se her wanton and wild
Then se thou call upon god still
That he will keep the vndefylde
And keep from the all manners ill
Avoid idle and wanton talk
Avoid nyce lokes and daliaunce
And when thou do in the streets walk
Se thou show no light contenaunce.
Let thine apparayle be honest
Be not decked paste thy degree
Neither let thou thine head be dreste
Otherwise then besemeth the i. Timo. ii

Let thine hear bear the same color
That nature gave it to endure
Lay it not out as does an whore
That would men's fantacies allure
Paynt not thy face in any wise
But make thy manners for to shine
And thou shall please all such men's eyes
As do to godliness enclyne.
Be thou modeste, sober and wise
And learn the points of houswyfry
And men shall have the in such price
That thou shall not need a dowry
Study to please the lord above
Walking in thy calling upright
And god will some good man's heart move
To set on the his whole delight.
Now when thou art become a wife
And have an housbande to thy mind
Se thou provoke him not to strife
Lest happily he do prove unkind
Acknowledge that he is thine head i. Co^. xi.

And has of the, the governance
And that thou must of him be led
According to gods ordinance
Do all thy busynes quietly
And delight not Idle to stand
But do thy self ever apply
To have some honest work in hand
And in no case thou maiste suffer
Thy servants or children to play
For there is naught tha^ may sooner
Make them desire to ten away
Se thou keep them still occupied
From morn till it be night again
And if thou se they grow in pride
Then lay hand on the bridle rain
But be thou not to them bitter
With words lacking discretion
For thine housband it is fytter
To give them due correction
But if thou be of such degree
That it is not for the semely
Emonge thy maidens for to be
Yet do thy self still occupye
Do thy self occupy I say
In reading or heary^g some thing
Or talking of the godly way
Wherein is great edifiynge
Se thy children well nurtered
Se them brought up in the lords fear
And if their manners be wicked
In no case do thou with them bear.
And if thine housbande do outrage
In any thing what so it be
Admonish him of his last age
With words mylde as becomes the.
And if he do refuse to hear
Thy gentle admonition
Yet se if thou can cause him fear
Gods terreble punission
Do what thou canste him to allure
To seek god by godly lyueynge
And certainly thou shall be sure
Of life that is everlasting
For though the first woman did fall i Timo. ii.

And was the chief occasion
That sin has pearsed through us all
Yet shall thou have salluation
Thou shall be false I say, if thou
Keep thy self in obedience
To thine housband, as thou dydste vow
And show to him d^e reverence
But in faith must all this be done
Or else it doe^h nothing avail
For without fay^h naught can be wone Hebr. xi.

Take tho^ never so great travail.
Thou must believe and hope that he
Tha^ bade the be obedient
Will be right well ^leased with the
Because thou hold the content
Now, if thine housband be godly
And have knowledge be^ter then ^hou
Then learn of him all thy duty
And to his doctrine se thou bow
Se thou talk with him secretly
Of such things as do the behoue
And se thou observe thorowlye
All such things as he shall aproue
Seek to please him in thine array
And let not new tryckes delight the
For that becomes the always
That with his mind does best agree
Delight not in vain tatyllars
That do use false rumors to sow
For such as be great babbelars
Will in no case their duty know
Their coming is always to tell
Some false lie by some honest man
They are wrosse then the deuell of hell
If a man would them thoroughly scanne
They will find fault at thine array
And say it is for the to base
And happily ere they go away
They will teach the to paynt thy face
Yea if all other talk do fail
Before the idle time be spent
They will teach the how to assail
Thine housbande with words vehement
Thou maste swear by gods passion
That long before thou saw his head
Thou hadest each gallant fassion
And wylt again when he is dead
Thou must tell him that he may hear
With a loud voice and eke words plain
That you wilt some time make good chere
With right good felows one or twain.
I am ashamed for to write
The talk that these gossepes do use
Wherefore, if thou wylt walk upright
Do their company quyte refuse
For they are the deuelles ministres
Sent to destroy all honesty
In such as will be their hearars
And to their wicked read apply
But thou that art Sarais daughter i. Pet. iii.

And lokeste for salvation
Se thou learn thy doctrine at her.
And walk in thy vocacion.
She was always obedient
To her housband, and calde him lord
As the book of gods testament Gene. xviii.

Does in most open wise record.
Follow her, and thou shall be sure
To have as she had in the end
The life that shall ever endure
Unto the which, the lord the send
Amen.
The Book to the Reader,
It pleased mine Author to give me to name
The voice of the last trumpe (as Saint Ihon does write)
Thinking thereby to avoid all the blame
That co^munely chaunseth to such m^^ write
Plainly to such me^ as walk not upright
For truth gets hatered of such as be il
And will suffer nothing that bridleth their will
I sought do displease you, let me bear the wyre
For I am the doer of that which is done
I barcke at your faults, but loath I am to byte
If by this barking ought might be won
And for this intent I was first begone
That hearing your faults ye might the^ emende
And reign with your master Christ at the end.
