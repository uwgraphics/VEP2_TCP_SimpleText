To the Reader.
GEntle Reader, is such a stale title to put upon you, that not knowing your
disposition to this same universal gentleness, and perhaps at this time, so full
of melancholy, as maks you unfit for any such kindness: I had rather say, you
that read, if you have so much idle time to pass away, as may be somewhat
better then lost, in perusing this change, or rather dream of the change of
times, I pray you for this time to have patience, and if an other time in this
you take pleasure, I will as I can take a time to run a better course to your
contentment. Friar Bacons Brazen head, was said (in lest) to have spoken of
three times: The time was, The Time is, and Time shall be: Now for my self, I
cannot go so far: what was, at least of late, I have a little read, heard,
and understood* of the time present I only dreamed: but of what ^s to come, I
can say nothing: and therefore making no Chronicle of the first, and only
showing my dream of the second, I will make no Prophecy of the third, but
leave all to Gods pleasure: and so, leaving you to judge of all times as you
have reason, I take my leave of you at this time: but rest at all times.

Your friend as I find cause and time, William Terilo.

A piece of Friar Bacons Brazen-heads Prophecy.
Time was, Time is.
WHen I was but a Boy
And plaide with little Girls:
And more esteemed a toye
Then precious stones, or Pearls,
Then Natures love, that knew no pride,
With little would be satisfide.
Then friends would not fall out,
But soon fall in again:
When none would go about
To lay a wicked train:
But kindness was in such request,
That malice knew not where to rest.
Content was then a king,
Although he ware no Crown:
And it was a wondrous thing
Would make a Maiden frown,
When it was no little grace to Nature
For to be called a gentle Creature.
The Milke-maydes paile was sweet,
The Shepherds Cloak was clean:
And when their Loves did meet,
They did no falsehood mean.
While Truth did in their passions try,
There could not pass a thought awry.
Then observation found
The passage of those parts:
Where Reason laid the ground
Of all Experience Arts.
While Love was ruled by Grace,
To seek his spirits resting place.
Then praise grew of desert,
Desert of true conceit:
Whose tongue was in the heart,
That could not hide deceit.
But he or she, was held a fiend,
That would be false unto a friend.
Then Shepherds knew the times
And seasons of the year:
And made their honest Rimes,
In mirth, and merry cheer.
And Sim and Su, would kindly kiss,
When nothing could be meant amiss.
Then Sheep eyes were not watched,
That Lambs did waking keep:
And when the Hen had hatched,
The Chickens might go peep.
When snares were set, both day and night,
To hang the Buzzard, and the Kite.
The Hen, the Goose, the Ducke,
Might cackle, creake, and quacke:
When not an Owl would pluck
A feather from her back:
Except she crowed, or would not lay,
Then roast her on a holy day.
The Butchers then would keep
Their flesh from blowing Flies:
And Maidens would not sleep,
But in the morning rise,
And hunt a Flea so in the bed,
He knew not where to hide his head.
Then neither Wolf nor Fox,
But that did fear the Hound:
Nor greatest headed Ox
But to the yoke was bound:
Nor drawing Tit, but knew who there,
Nor Ass, but did his burden bear.
Then Oats were known from Rye,
And Barley from the Wheat:
A Cheese Cake and a Pie,
Were held good country meat.
When Ale and Spice, and Curdes, and Cream,
Would make a Scholar make a Theme.
And then when wooers met,
It was a sport to see
How soon the match was set,
How well they did agree:
When that the Father gave the child,
And then the mother sat and smilde.
Delays were then like death
To any kind desire:
When no man spent his breath
To be no whit the nigher.
But Truth and Trust so deerly loved,
That what the one did, the other proved.
Then Cock a doodle do,
The houre's divided right:
And old to whit to whoo
Did watch the winter night.
And in the Springs the Nightingale
Did tell the woods a merry Tale.
Then Beetels could not live
Upon the honey Bees:
But they the Drones would drive
Unto the doted Trees.
When he that wrought not till he sweat,
Was held unworthy of his meat.
Then were no pitfalls made
But in the frost and snow:
Nor VVoodcocks in the glade
Could by the Springes go.
And not a Bird that bare a winge,
But that would stoop unto his winge.
Then Russet cloth and Frize
Did walk the world about:
And no man would despise
The inside for the out:
But he that paid for what he spent,
Was welcome where so ere he went.
Then were there no devises
To draw on fond desires:
But Chapmen knew the prices,
The sellers and the buyers:
And simple Truth no cunning used,
How simple Trust might be abusde.
The Markets then were served,
With good sufficient ware:
And Cattle were not staru'de
When Mowcher and his Mare
Would bring in such a sack of Rye,
As tried the Millers honesty.
Then John, and Ioane, and Madge,
Were called the merry Crew:
That with no drink could fadge,
But where the fat they knew.
And though they knew who brewed the Ale,
Yet must it stand till it were stale.
Then was good fellowship
Almost in every house:
She would not hang the lip,
He would not knit the brows:
But he would smirke, and she would smile,
That all the house would laugh the while.
Then Handkerchers were wrought,
With names, and true loves knots:
And not a wench was taught
A false stitch in her spots.
When Roses in the Gardaines grew,
And not in Ribons, on a shoe.
Then painting only seru'de,
For Paper, Wood, and Cloth:
When health was most preseru'de,
By labor, not by sloth.
When few that did of Physic hear,
But they were stricken with a fear.
Then he that heard of war
Was in a woeful case:
Except it were so far
He could not fear the place.
When Peace and Plenty were so sweet,
As trod all Fortunes under feet.
The Taber and the Pipe,
The Bagpipe and the Crowde:
When Oats and Rye were ripe,
Began to be alowde.
But till the Harvest all was in,
The Moris Dance did not begin.
A City from a Town,
Then by his wall was seen:
And none did wear a Crown,
But either King, or Queen:
And ever upon Easter day,
All Jack a Lents were cast away.
Then Cloakes were for the rain,
And Feathers but for beds:
Sheep Russet would not stain,
There were no greenes nor reddes:
Carnation, Crimson, yealow, blew,
Plain people no such colors knew.
The Horse, the Cow, the Hog,
Were kept for work and wealth:
The Pus-Cat and the Dog,
For safeguard from the stealth:
Of Rats and Mise, and Wolf, and Fox,
When few had keys unto their locks.
Then Owls nor Night Ravens were,
No tellers of ill happes:
When Faith had never fear
Of any Thunder-clappes:
But look what weather ever came,
Was welcome in Gods holy name.
Then Monkies, Baboones, Apes,
And such il-fauour'd Creatures,
Of such strange fashioned shapes
Were hateful to our natures:
When who heard tell but of a Bear,
But he could scarcely sleep for fear.
No Parat, Pie, nor Dawe,
Was idely taught to prate:
Nor scarce a man of Law
Was known in all the state.
While neighbors so like friends agreede,
That one supplide an others need.
The shepherd kept his sheep,
The Goat-heard kept his heard:
And in the Sun would sleep,
When were no Vermin feared;
For every Curre would bark or bite,
To put the wicked Fox to flight.
And then a good gray Frocke,
A Kercheffe, and a Rail:
A fair white flaxen Smock,
A Hose with a good wail.
A good strong leatherd winter shoe,
Was well Iwis, and better too.
Then Iwis, well, go too,
Were words of no small worth:
When folks knew what to do
To bring their meanings forth.
And wink, and nod, and hem, and humme,
Could bring my finger to my thumb.
No cutting of a Card,
Nor cogging of a Dye:
But it was wholly barde
All honest company:
And fair square play with yea and naie,
Who lost the game would quickly pay.
No matches then were set
For younger brothers lands:
Nor Usurers could get
Men's goods into their hands:
But such as had their wits awake,
Could smell a Knave before he spoke.
And hardly in a year
A man should meet a Thief:
When Corn was nere so dear
But poor folks had relief:
And wickedness was loathed so much,
That no man loved the tickle tuch.
Then love went not by looks,
Wherein lay venim hid:
Nor words were Angle-hookes,
When men knew that they did,
But honest hearts, and modest eyes,
Did make the Lovers paradise.
But now that world is changde,
And time does alter Creatures:
Whose spirits are estrang'de
From their own proper natures:
While woeful eyes may weep, to see
How all things are, and what they be.
Now every idle Boy
That sells his land for Pearls:
Fsteemes his wealth a toye,
To give to idle girls:
While graceless love, in Natures pride,
With sin is never satisfide.
Now friends do often fall out,
But seelde fall in again:
While many go about
To lay a wicked train:
Where malice is so in request,
That kindness knows not where to rest.
Content is now unknown,
In either King or Clown:
A sight too common shown,
To see a Maiden frown:
When she is held a foolish Creature,
That shows to be of gentle Nature.
The Milke-maydes Paile is sour,
The Shepherds Cloak unclean:
Where Love has not the power
To find what fancies mean:
While Faith does so much falsehood prove,
That many lie, which say they love.
Now observation finds
By all Experience Arts:
How Machauilian minds
Do play the devils parts:
While love (alas) has little grace
In worshipping a wicked face.
Now praise must follow pride,
And Flattery wayt on wealth:
And tongues to silence tide,
Except it be by stealth:
While he or she that cannot feign,
Must die a friends-ships fool in grain.
The seasons of the year
The Shepherds do not know:
While mirth and merry cheer
To grief and sorrow grow:
While if a couple kindly kiss,
The third thinks somewhat is amiss.
Now sheepes-eies are so watched,
That Lambs can hardly sleep:
For when the Hen has hatched,
Ere well the Chicken peep:
The Buzzard and the Kite so pray,
That half the Brood is stolen away.
No Butcher now can keep
His flesh from blowing flies:
And Maids will lie and sleep,
That do not love to rise:
While every bed so swarms with fleas,
I wonder how they lie at ease.
How neither Wolf nor Fox,
But can beguile the Hound:
Nor gallant headed Ox,
Will to a yoke be bound:
Nor drawing Tit, but skornd who there,
Nor Ass, that will his burden bear.
Wheat, Barley, Oats, and Rye,
So like are in the blade:
That many a simple eye,
May Soon a fool be made:
While Curdes, and Cream, and Ale, and Spice,
Will bring out but a poor device.
Now Cocks dare scarcely Crow,
For fear the Fox do hear:
Nor shriche-Owle but will show,
That Winter time is near:
And Philomens amid the spring,
So fears the worm, she cannot sing.
And now when Lovers meet,
It is a grief to see:
How heavily they greet,
And how they disagree:
While that the fathers eyes are blind,
And that the mother is unkind.
Delays to near disdain,
Do feed upon desire:
And breath is spent in vain,
Where hopes are nere the nigher:
While Truth and Trust have too much proved
They hardly find where to be loved
Now humble Bees can live
Upon the honey Bees:
That not a Drone dare drive,
Unto the doted trees:
While he that works not for his meat,
Will live upon another sweat.
Now pitfalls are so made,
That small birds cannot know them:
No VVoodcockes in a Glade,
But Netts can overthrow them:
And not a paltry carrion Kite,
But braues a Faulcon in his flight.
Now velvet, cloth of gold,
And silks of highest price:
Does make the good free-holde,
Chaung title with a trice:
While he that spends and will not pay,
Is welcome, when he is away.
Now words of strange devises,
Do cheat upon desires:
While cunning sellers prices,
Do cosen simple buiers:
While truth is all so sildome used,
That honest trust is much abused.
The markets now are saru'de
With much unsavory ware:
And cattle often staru'de,
When that the Millers Mare
Can scarcely bring a sack of Rye,
That one may be a sauer by.
Now John and Ioane, and Madge,
Can make no merry Crew:
The baily with his badge,
So braues it in his blue:
None dare discharge a Carier,
For fear of master officier.
And now from every house
Good fellowship is gone:
And scarce a silly mouse,
Finds crummes to feed upon:
While, lowre, and poute, and chafe and champe,
Brings all the household in a dampe.
Now clockes are for the Sun,
And feathers for the wind:
Sheep Russet to home spunne,
While a fantastic mind
Must have a color strange and rare,
To make a mad man stand and stare.
The Horse, the Cow, the Hog,
Are chiefly kept for breed:
The Puscat, and the Dog,
To keep the plough-mans feed:
While not a lock but has a kay:
For fear the Cupboord run away.
Now Owls and night-Rauens are
Ill fortunes prophecies:
When faithless spirits stare,
If any storm arise:
And if the weather be not fair,
Why fools are almost in despair.
Now Monkies, Baboones, Apes,
Are taught to pranke and prance:
While many a Wizard gape,
To see a monster dance:
And not a woman that will fear,
To see the baiting of a Bear.
Now Parats, Pies and Dawes,
Are finely taught to prate:
And worlds of men of law,
Are needful in the state:
Where Neighbors live so unlike friends,
That men would judge them to be fiends.
And now a Satin gown,
A petticoate of silk:
A fine wrought bugle Crown,
A Smock as white as milk:
A colour'de hose, a pincked shoe,
Will scarcely make a Tit come too.
Now as God Judge my soul,
Besides my faith, and troth:
On every wassell bowl,
Is thought a simple Oath:
While stamp and stare, and clapping hands,
Will scarce make up a beggars bands.
Now Sempsters few are taught,
The true sticht in their spots:
And names are sildome wrought,
Within the true loves knots:
And Ribon Roses take such place,
That Garden Roses want their grace.
Now painting serves for faces,
To make the foul seem fair:
And health in many places,
Must not abide the Air:
And few that have been bit with fleas,
But run to physic for their ease.
Now war makes many rich,
That else had been but poor:
And makes a soldier itch,
Till he have scratcht a Boore:
For peace and plenty breed such pride,
As poor men's fortunes cannot bide.
The Taber and the Pipe,
Are now out of request:
And ere the Rye be ripe,
The bird will leave the nest:
And Moris dances do begin,
Before the harvest half be in.
Now many a Towns mud wall,
Does put a City down:
And Mistress Finicall,
Does wear a Bugle Crown:
And many a Rascal Mall-content,
Will make his Easter day in Lent.
Now cogge and foist that list,
Who will that wit gain say,
That learnes fools had I wist:
That will and cannot play,
While fair, and square, and pitch, and pay:
The gamster calls fools holy day.
Now worlds of Matches set,
For elder brothers lands:
And usury does get,
Great wealth into her hands:
While he that will not watch a knave,
May bring a beggar to his grave.
Now hardly in a day,
But one shall meet a thief:
Where wealth is hid away,
And poor have no relief:
And wickedness is used so much,
As who but loves the tickle tuch.
Now love goes so by looks,
Men know not what they do:
And words are poisned hooks,
That catch, and kill men too:
While wicked hearts and wanton eyes
Make hell in steed of paradise.
Now surely thus it is,
It is a wonderful change:
Where all goes so amiss,
Or else my dream is strange:
That shew'de me such a world of woe*
But God forbid it should be so.
For dreams are idle things,
And surely so is this:
For true appearance brings,
No proof of such amiss:
But every thing in such good course,
As God forbid it should be worse.
For Lovers must be kind,
And Neighbors must be friends:
And when the folks have dinde,
Set up the puddings ends:
For it is an ancient rule in truth,
That thristines is good in youth.
Old men must have their saying,
And rich men must have place:
Suitors must bide delaying,
And children must say grace:
And thiefes must hang and knaves must shift,
And silly fools must have the lift.
And Law must speak, Wit judge,
Men live until thy die:
And Snot must be a snudge,
And love have leave to lie:
And wretches work, and wantons play,
And who can hold that will away?
And wagges must sing, and dance,
And gamsters plot for gain:
Who likes not of his chance,
Take by to help the maine:
For he that walks without a head,
May quickly bring a fool to bed.
Women must have their wills,
Though men would say them nay:
Some are such needful ills,
They cannot be away:
And he that gives the humme a hemme,
Will sometimes fall aboard with them.
The Horse must have his hay,
The Dog must have a bone:
The Ducke must have a Bay,
The Hawke must have a stone*
And Ihon must not be kept from Ioane,
For Love can never live alone.
And therefore thus in brief,
Let peace endure no strife:
Let no man offer grief,
Unto his neighbors wife:
Let fair play pass through every hand,
And let him fall that cannot stand.
Let God be served, obai'd,
The King both served and lou'de:
Church honored, duties paid,
Malice from minds remou'de:
And it may hap to come to pass,
To be as well as ere it was.
And blessed were the days,
If so the world did go:
That wit a thousand ways,
Might reasons comfort know.
Whil birds might sing, and men might speak,
And malice might no music break.
That eyes might look their fill,
Words might be uncontrolled:
And art might have the skill,
To find the stone for gold:
And Jealous eyes might all be blind,
That ouerlooke an honest mind.
That wealth should have her grace,
In liberality:
And honor give a place,
To every quality:
While panders, iesters, fools, and knaves,
Might walk about like silly slaves.
A word might be a band,
Where needles were an Oath:
While yea and nay might stand,
In steed of faith and troth:
And tuch, and take, and pitch, and pay,
Might drive all cunning tricks away.
A wink, a nod, a smile,
Might show the judgment just,
Where Truth could not beguile,
Her honest meaning Trust:
But one in two, and two in one,
Might make the merry world alone.
That quarrels might not grow
Of swaggering, nor quaffing:
But who begins heigh ho!
Might set the house a laughing:
When not a thought of villainy
Might come in honest company.
And Gossips might be merry
And tattle when they meet:
And cheeks as red as cherry,
Might show the wine is sweet:
When Lovers are in talk so sad,
As if thy were already had.
Power should be fearde for Grace,
And Law obeyed for love:
And Virtue take her place,
In highest hopes behoue:
And Wisdom only honor God,
And so should sin be ouertrod.
Naught should be scornde but Folly,
Nor in regard but Reason:
And nothing lou'de, but holy,
And naught in hate but Treason:
And naught but slander banged,
And naught but Murder hanged.
And then the world were well,
But when will it be so?
(Alas) I cannot tell,
And therefore let it go:
And as God will, so let it be,
It shall be as it list for me.
Let every man mend one,
And I will not be out:
And Lohn be good to Ioane,
Or else he is a Lout:
And Peter weaue, what Parnell spunne,
Good night John Line, and I have done.
FINIS.
