Here begyn^eth a new Treatise divided in three parties.

The first part is to know, and have i^ mind
The wretchedness, of all mankind.
The second is of the co^dycion and manner
Of the unsteadfastness, of this world here.
The third part i^ this book you may read
Of bitter death, and why it is to dread.
THe might of the Father almighty
The wit of the Sone all wytty
And the goodness of the holy Ghost
God and Lord of myghtes most
Be our help / and our speed
Now and ever in all our need
And specially at this beginning
And bring us all to good ending.
AMEN.
BEfore or that any thing was wrought
And or beginning was of ought
Before all times we should mean
The same God, was ever in godhed clean
And ever is full in his godhed
And three persons, and in onelychehed
And would ever with the father and the sone
With the holy Ghost in one head bewone
And is Lord in substance and being
And ever was without beginning
Beginning of him, might there never none be
For ever he was God in Trynyte
And ever is wise, and full of wit
And ever almyghtye God as he is yet
That might was ever in his trone
There was never God, but he alone
The same God was without beginning
And maker first of all thing
Without beginning we shall him call
And endless Lord, of creatures all
And end of all thing is he
As men may in holy books se
And as he made all thing
So shall he at the last, make anendynge
Of all things, both in heaven and hell
Of man, of fend, and of angel
That after this life shall evermore leave
And all other creatures to death be dreue
But God that us made, and the world began
Is now and ever shall be, both God and man
And all thing, through his might made he
For without him, may nothing be
All thing he ordained after his will
In his kind to stand still
And therefore creatures, that dombe be
Can no reason, but buxom men them se
Loves him, as the book bears wytnes
In their manner, and as their kind is
For all things that, God has wrought
Does their kind, and passes it naught
And loves their maker, and honor in kind
And so in that manner, they have him in mind
And sith creatures, that reason has none
Loves him in kind, that they have taken
Than should man, that has reason and fay
His Lord honor, by all manner of way
And not to be of worse condycyon
Than the brute beestes, that can no reason
For all thing that God made, both more and less
Man is pryncypall, and should all other pass
As ye shall here afterward soon
That God made of all thing, for man one
For God to mankind, had great delight
Seeing that he made all thing, for man's proffyte
Heaven, and earth, and all the world broad
He made first, but man till the last abode
And him in likeness, of semely stature
As him thought most worthy creature
Passing all beestes, that have any kind
And gave him reason, both wit, and mind
Ever for to know, both good and evil
And thereto gave him wit at will
Both to choose and to hold
Good or the evil, whyther he would.
GOd ^rdeyned man also to dwell
In earth here, both in flesh and fell
And know his works, and him honor
And keep his commandments, in every hour
And if a man to God, boxum become
To heaven bliss, he shall be nome
And if he will from goodness wend
To pains of hell, that has none end
Therefore I hold a man wood
That takes the wicked, and leueth the good
And God made man of most dygnyte
And of all creatures in earth most fre
For after his lykenes, he made him ywys
As he should have part of his bliss
And most God our Lord to him gives
More than to any creature, that in earth lives
For when Adam, had done amysse
And for his sins, brought from bliss
God took mankind, for his sake
And for his ^oue, hard death can take
And with his blood, again him bought
And after to heaven bliss him brought
Thus great love, God showed unto man
And much more kyndenes, than I tell can
Wherefore every man, both learned and lewed
Should think upon the love, that God showed
And that kyndenes, have in his mind
That God has done, to all mankind
And serve him both night and day
And find to please him, in all that he may
And spend his w^ttes, in his service
And them will hold in all manner wise
But a man know kyndely what God is
And him self also, that he be one of his
And how a man greueth God, that does naught well
And makes him through sin, both fearse and fell
And how mercyable God is, night and day
And how grievous, to every man's pay
And how ryghtfull, and how sothfast
And ever more has been, both first and last
And what he does to all mankind
That ever should have him in mind
For the way that brings a man to heaven bliss
And brings a man also out of anguysshe
Pryncypally, that is the way of mekenes
Dread and love of God, in all symplenes
Than may that, before the way of wisdom
Unto the which way, may no man come
Without full knowing, of God here
And of his power also, and his work so dear
And or that he may, that knowing win
Him behooves, to know him self within
And else he may no knowing have
The foresaid way of wisdom to crave
But many men has good understanding
And yet be of many things unknowing
And of some things has knowing none
That might often make Gods will to be done
Such men had need, to learn every day
How that they should here God pay
And know the thing, that might them led
To mekenes and love, and God to dread
The which is the way, as I tell ywys
That leads a man even to heaven bliss
For in great perryle of soul, is that man
That has wit and mind, and no good can
And will naught learn for no saw
The works of God, neither his law
And knows not the ten hestes
But lives as unskillful beestes
That has neither reason nor mind
But leueth ever against his kind
For he excuses naught his uncunning
That uses not his wit in learning
And namely of the thing, that he should know
That should make his heart full low
And he that can naught, should learn more
To know what him needs in Gods lore
For an uncunning man through learning
May be brought to good understanding
And of many things, both know and se
That has been before, and after shall be
That to mekenes might move his will
The more to love God, and to fly the evil.
MAny man delyteth, tryfles to here
And about folly, sets all his chere
And evermore is besy, both in will and thought
To learn things, y^ helps the soul naught
And things, that needful were to know
To lysten or to learn, they be full slow
Therefore no wonder, though they gone amysse
For ever in darcknes, their going is
All far from the light of understanding
And from things, that falls to the right knowing
Therefore every christen man and woman
That has any wit, and reason can
Should be besye by all manner of way
To learn such things, that longs to the say
And evermore learn, both loud and still
Which is the good way, and which is evil
And he that the right way, of knowing will look
Should thus begin, as tells the book
First for to know, him self in clennes
And than may he come, to all mekenes
For that is the ground of all to last
In whom all virtues be set fast
For he that knows it, and well can se
What him self was, and is, and after shall be
The more wyser man, he might be calde
Whyther that he be young man, other old
Therefore every wise man, first must lere
For to know him self, while that he is here
And if he know him self, within and without
Than shall he have ever, God in doubt
And upon his ending, his thought must be cast
And upon the dredefull dome, that shall come last
And also know, what this world is
That is but vanyte, and full of wretchedness
And forsake sin, and foul lusts all
And think what shall after this life fall
For knowing of all this, should him led
To have mekenes in mind, and also dread
For so may a man, come to good living
And at the last, have good ending
And when he shall, out of this world wend
Come unto the joy, that has none end
The beginning of this matter is
The right knowing of a man him self ywys
But some men has great lettynge
So that they may not have full knowing
Of them self, that first they should know
And with mekenes ever make them low
And of that matter, four things I find
That makes men's wits, full blind
And the knowing of them self lets
youth the which him self, he forgets
Therefore saint Bernarde, speaks to us
And in his writing says all thus.
Forma favor popu^i, sensus Iuuenilis opesque
Suppi puere tibi, noscere quid sit homo.
That is favor of fool, and much fayrenes
And hete of youth, and mothe riches
Blyndeth a man's reason and mind
For to know him self, what he is of kind
And thus these four, lets him in sight
So that he forgets him self out right
And makes his heart, proud and hawtey^e
And all waywarde, from God his souereygne
For these nouryssheth both pomp and pride
And makes other sins in them to bide
For in what man any of these four is
Seldom is seen in him, any manner mekenes
And lets a man, that he may not s^
The manners of the world full of vanyte
Neither the time of death, when he shall come
Neither when he shall hence, to dome be nome
Neither he ne can understand ne se
The perryll that after this life than shall be
To all sinful men, that loves folly
Nay the joy that good men, shall have so hy^
But in great delytes, sets their hertes fast
And fares as their life ever more should last
And gives them here to all ydlenes
And to such things, that no profit is
And such men be not with reason lad
But in their folyes evermore be sad
And things that they should dread, they know not
Therefore they have no dread, to set on their thought
And that is for defaute of knowing
Of things, that might to dread them bring
Yet some men, will not understand
Such things, that might them bring to shonde
For they will here nothing, that them mysspeaketh
Therefore saint David in his book thus says.
Nosuit intellegere vt been ageret.
He says, man has no will to be snell
To understand things, to make them do well
These words be said by them here
That will naught understand, neither do lere
To dread God, and to do his will
But follows their lusts, and lives full evil
And for defaute of true faith, this may be
For they lives nothing, but they ^t se
But grutcheth when they should ought lere
Therefore says the Prophet, in this manner.
Non crediderunt set murmurauerunt.
The Prophet says, that they beloved naught
But grutched, and were heavy in thought
Thus fares many men, that lives nothing
That men tells them, against their liking
But grutcheth and waxes all froward
When men speaks ought, that them thinks hard
Some can in book, such things read
But lyghtnes of heart, brings them dread
So it may not with them dwell
As God witnesses in the Gospel.
Quia ad tempus credunt, and in temptationis recedunt.
He says for the time, some leave a thing
And soon passes there fro, in time of temptynge
As witnesses the prophet saint David
In a verse of the Psalter, that accords therewith.
Et crediderunt in verbis eius, and laudauerunt laudem eius.
He says in his works, they byleued well
And praised his works, as they cought somdell
But soon they had his works forgyt
And thought of his counceyll, no more to wit
Such men be ever unsteadfast
That neither love ne dread, may on them last
But who that can naught dread, may soon l^re
That hereth this matter, with good ere
With such things, that he may conceive thereby
And do good deeds, and fly folly
Therefore these books, be out draw
Of diverse matters, that be of Gods law
To lewed men, that be not of understanding
And of latin speech, be all uncunning
To make him self, first for to know
And all sins, away to throw
And to bring them, to perfyre dread
When they this treatise, will here or read
That shall move his conseyence within
And through that dread, may alone begin
Through comfort of the joys of heaven bright
As men may hereafter have a sight.
Here begins the first part of this book / that speaks of man's
wretchedness.
First when God made all thing of naught
Man of the foulest matter was wrought
That was of earth, to skyles to behold
That is for almyghtye God so would
Of soul matter, make man in despyte
Of Lucyfer, him therewith to a twyte
When he fell in to hell, for his pride
And many one mo, that fell that tide
For they should have the more shendshype
And the more sorrow, when they took keep
That man of so foul matter, should dwell
In that place, from whens they fell
An other cause is, for man should se
That a man the more meker should be
Ever when he sethe, and thinks in thought
Of the foul matter, that he was wrought
For God through his great might
Would sign that place in heaven bright
That was made void, through sin of pride
Would have it filled in every side
As through virtue, of holy mekenes
That contrary to all manner of pride is
He thought to amend it in some wise
Wherefore men should, Lucyfer despise
For there may no man, in to heaven come
But he that in deed is meke and buxom
And so tells the Gospel, and says to us
That God spoke to his dyscyples, and said thus.
N^si eff^ciam^ni sicut prouuli: non intrabitis in regnu^ ce^oru^.
He says, but ye be as meke as a child
That is to understand, both meke and mylde
ye shall not come by any manner of way
In to the kingdom of heaven on hey
But one thing, makes most meke a man
To think in his heart, as often as he can
How he is made of foul mattere
Fouler thing in earth, is none here
And so says saint Job, in his morenynge lay
What is a man here, but earth and clay
And powder that with the wind do breketh
And therefore the good man, to God thus speaks.
(...) queso quod sicut lutu^ feceris me, and in pu^uere^ reducis me^
He says think Lord, how thou made me
Of sou^e ^arth and clay, in this world to be
And thereto shall I turn, at my last end
^uen again to powdre, and to naught wend
And than says our Lord, of myghtyes most
To every man, that has in him the holy Ghost.
Memen^o (...), and in cinerem renerteris.
He says, think man that ashes art now
And into ashes again, turn shall thou
Than of this, every man should have mind
And know the wretchydnes, of his own kind
For here a man's life, well cast may be
Pryncypally to tell in parties three
That been maked, to our understanding
Beg^nnynge mydwarde, and last ending
These three parties spaces, may be told
Of every man's life, both young and old.
Of the beginning of man's life.
THe beginning of a man's life, first is
Conceived in much wretchydnes
Therefore I think, or I further pass
Tell what every man, in ye beginning was
Man was beget, as well it is know
Of foul sede, within a woman sow
And man synfully, conceived was
In his mothers womb, in a preuy place
And how his dwelling was there ydyght
Saint David tells, and witnesses full right
Ecce in iniquitatibus conceptus sum? and in peccatis concepit me matter mea.

Behold he says, what man's kind is
In wretchydnes, I am conceived ywys
And also my mother, has conceived me
In many sins, and much vylte
For there dwells a man, in a dercke dongyon
That is full of fylth and corrupcyon
Wherein he had, no manner of fode
But foul glat, and waltsome blood
And when that he hither come was
From his mother womb, that foul place
And was here brought, in to this worlds right
He had neither power, ne might
Neither for to go, ne on f^te stand
Neither to crepe in fete, ne in hand
Than has a man less might, than has a be
When he is new borne, and seems leest
For when a be is ybore, than it may go
And does his kind here euermo
But a man has no might, in his yongeheade
For he may not go, but as men does him lead
For he may another go nor crepe
But lie and spraule, cry, and weep
For a child is not fully ybore
That it ne cries as thing forlore
And by that cry, men t^ll can
Whyther that it be woman or man
For when it is borne, it cries swa
And if it be a man, it says.A.
And that is the first letter of the name
Of Adam our father* that brought us in blame
And if it of a woman's kind be
When it is borne, it sounds.E.
(...) the first letter, who that takes head
Of the name of Eve, that brought us in dread
Therefore a wise Clarcke, made in this manner
A verse that tells, of that same matter.
Dicentes.E.vel.A. quotquot nascuntur ab Eua.
All he says, that comes of Eve
May for nothing, that letter leave
When they be borne, what soever they be
He cries first.A. other else.E.
This is of our life, the first beginning
And after our birth, sorrow and weeping
And to wretchydnes, our kind styrreth us
And Innocent the bishop, therefore says thus.
O^^ nascimus ciusa^te^ vt nature nostre miseria^ exprimamus.
He says, we be ybore here euerychone
Making sorrow and reuthly moan
All for to show, our great wretchydnes
Of our kind, that is full of brotelnes
And naked we come hither, and bare
And so we shall all hence fare
Upon this think all, that any good can
For thus says saint Job, the holy man.
Nudus egressus sum ex vtero matris me^: et nudus reuertar illuc.

Naked he says, in to this world I come
When from my mothers womb nome
And naked I shall turn hence away
And so shall all at the last day
Thus is a man, at his first coming
Naked and bare, and brings nothing
But a skin foul and waltsome
That is his garment, when he shall come
And that is a blody skin full thynne
That he brought, and was wound in
When he in his mother womb lay
Forsooth this was a simple array
And thus is man made, as ye may se
In much wretchydnes, and captyuyte
And afterward lives here, but a few days
As Job openly unto us all says.
Homo natus de musiere breui viuens tempore.
He says, man that is borne of a woman
Lives here little time, and soon is tan
And every man is borne to nothing else
But to travail and sorrow, as the book tells.
Homo nascitur ad faborem: sicut A uis ad volandum.
He says man is made, to travail aryght
As the foul is made to his flight
For little rest he has i^ his ly^e ywys
But ever in travail, full ^esye is
And yet is a man, when he is bore
The fende^ of hell, and all ylore
Untyll he through grace, again ben ynome
And to baptyme afterward come
Therefore every man, shall understand so
That his life, is but sorrow and woo.
Of the mids of a man's life.
THat other part of man's life, men calls
Is the mydwarde, that after youth falls
And that is first, from man's beginning
Of every man's life, until his last ending
And how a man afterward, is foul become
Saint Bernarde thereof* has wytnes nome.
Homo (...) aliud est quod Sperma
Sactus, fte^^orum and ^f^a vermium
Saint Bernarde witnesses, as the book tells
That a man in this life, is nothing else
But a foul slyme, horrible to all men
And is a foul sake, of stynkynge fen
And also worms meat, that they will have
When that he is dead, and laid in grave
But some men and women, fair they seems
To sight without, as men it demeth
And shows nothing, but the white skin
But who that might openly look therein
A fouler caryon, might there never be
Than men should on them than se
Therefore who that had a sharp insyght
And had as clear eyes, and also as bright
As has a be, that Lux men calls
That may se through thycke stone walls
Than little liking should a man have
To behold a woman, or after her crave
Than might he se, without any doubt
As well within, as he does with out
For if a man might se her within aryght
It were full dredefull, to every man's sight
And so foul every man within is
As the book tells, and witnesses all this
And therefore, I hold a man nothing wise
That makes him self, of to much pryse
Sith he may every day, both here and se
What that he is here, and what he shall be
But a proud man, of this takes no head
For him fails reason, that should him led
When that he is young, and loves playinge
Other has wealth at his liking
Other that he be brought, in to great worshype
Than he of him self, take^h he no keep
For him self than he knows all there leest
And fares than as unreasonable be
That follows his own will, and nothing else
As say. it David witnesses, and tells.
Homo cum in honor esset non intellexit comparatus est in mentis insipientibus.

He says, when a man in worship is brought
Right good understanding, has he naught
Therefore he may be lykened, both in flesh and bone
To beestes that reason and wit can none
Therefore every man, that has wit and mind
Often should think, on his wretched kind
And that with fylthe he is all ynome
As he man se every day from his body come
Both at nose and at mouth, and byneth also
All manner corrupcyon, comes him fro
And how foul it is to every man's sight
Saint Bernarde witnesses to us full right.
Si diligenter con^ideres quid per os quid per nares ceterosque meatus corporis
tui egreditur: vilius fterqui linium nunquod videres.

He says man, wylt thou inwardly se
And behold, what thing comes from the
Through nose and mouth, contynually
And through other places of thy body
A fouler dunghyll, saw thou never none
Than is a man, made in flesh and in bone
For in all that time, that a man here lives
His own kind, no good fruit gives
Whyther that he live short time, other long
But things that stynketh, wonder strong
And foul fylthed, and nothing else
As Innocent the great clarcke, in a book tells.
Herbas inquit and arbores diligenter iuuestiga, ille de fe producunt flores
and frondes and fructus: and tu de te lendes and pediculos. Ille autem de se
effundunt oleum and vinu^, and tu de te, sputum, vrinam, and stercus. Ille de
se spirant suanitatem^^ tu abhominationem ^tercoris.

This Clarcke tells thus in his book
Thou man he says* behold well and look
Herbs and trees, that in earth does spring
Take thou good head, what they forth bring
Herbs brings flowers, and makes sede
And trees fruit, and branches sprede
And thou bryngest forth, of thy self here
Both nyttes, and ly^e, and other vermyne yfere
Of herbs and trees, spryngeth bawme good
Both oil and wine, in help of man's fode
And that comes from the, does foul stynke
As dounge and pysse, and spatlynge
Of herbs and trees, comes good sauoure
And of the man, foul breath and sour
For such as the tree, bears with the bows
Such is the same fruit, that thereon grows
For a man is as a tree, that stands not hard
Of whom the crop is turned downwarde
And the rote is an hye, toward the fyrmament
As witnesses in this book, the clarcke Innocent.
Quid est homo secu^dum formam nisi quedam arbor euersa cuius radicis ^unt
crines trinicus est caput cum collo, stipes est pectus cum alno, ram^et vlne
cum tibiis fro^des st. digiti cum artil. hoc est folium quod a vento rapiter,
and stipula que a sole siccatur.

He says what is a man, but in shape as a tree
Turned up so down, as men may se
Of the which the rote, that thereto belongs
Is the here on thine head, that thereon hangs
Than is the stock next the rote growing
That is thine head, with thy neck showing
The body of the tree, that is set thereto
Is thy breast, with thy womb also
The bows be thine arms with thy hands
And the legs with thy fete, that thou on stands
Men may them branches, by reason call
The toes, and the fete, with thy fynges all
Life is the lefe, that hangs not fast
That will away, with the wyndes blast
And a man that is both young and light
Though he be never so hardy in fight
And comely of shape, and lovely of chere
yet syckenes and anger may him dear
And his might and fayrenes abate
And bring him soon, in to low state
And soon change his fair color
And make him fade, as does the flower
For a flour, that is fair to man's sight
Through storms it fades, and leseth his might
Angres and euylles, and myschyfes both
Often comes to a man, that be him loath
As fevers and dropsye, and Iaundyse also
Tysyke and the gowte, and other euylles mo
That makes his fayrenes, away for to wend
As storms does their flowers shende
This should be ever ensample to us
Therefore saint Job, in his book says thus.
Homo quasi flos egreditur and contritur and fugit velud vmb^a, and numquod in
eod. etc.

Man he says, as flour is bright
When it comes first to earthly sight
And soon is broke, and passes away
As does the shadow, in so^mers day
And never in the same state dwells
But evermore passes as Job tells
Of this the Prophet witnesses ywys
In a psalm of the Psalter that says this.
Mane sicut herba tran^eat mane floreat and trans^at vesp^re descidat. etc.

The Prophet says thus, in that case
A man passes away, as does the grass
Early beginning of the day
He floureth, and soon passes away
And at even, it is down brought
That fades and wexeth all to naught
In the beginning of man, him was give
Nine hundred year, in earth to live
As Clarckes in books, bears wytnes
And says, that man's life is draw to shortness
For God would, that it should so be
And God said him self, so unto Noe.
Non permanebit spiritus meus in homine ineternumque caro est: erunt enim dies
illius centum viginti anni.

My Ghost he says, shall not ever dwell
In man that is made of flesh and fell
His days shall be to live in here
An hundred, and also twentye year
But so great age, may no man bear
For death will him, in shorter time dear
For the complexyon of every man
Is now more febler, than it was than
Therefore man's life, might shorter be
For now it is feblest, all for to se
For the longer, that a man shall life
To more sorrow, he shall be dryfe
And less think, that this life is sweet
As in the psalter, witnesses the Prophet.
Si in potentatibus octoginta anni amplius little labor et do^or. etc.

If in strenghthes four score year, might befall
The more is their travail, and sorrow with all
But now much shorter be man's days
As Job the good man openly says.
(...) quid non paucitas di^rum meorum finietur breu^.
Now he says my short days that few were
Shall come to end, in little time here
And when a man waxes to be old
Than begins his kind, to be feable and cold
And than changes his complexyon
And his manners turn up so down
Than waxes his heart, full heavy and hard
And his head feeble, and ever downwarde
Than reueleth his face, evermore and more
And fouler waxes, than it was before
His wit is short when he ought thinks
^is nose droppeth, his onde stynketh
His sight waxes dym, he looks under the browe
His bark is crooked, he stopeth full low
His ears waxes death, and heard to here
And his tongue to speak, is nothing clear
Soon he is wroth, and waxes all froward
To turn him from wrath, it is hard
He is couytous, and fast holding
And heavy of chere, and ever lourynge
He prayseth old men, and holds them wise
And young men him lysteth to despise
And often is sick, and begins to groan
And often angrye, and playneth him soon
An these things, to an old man befalls
That Clarckes propertyes of age calls
Thus men may se, that read can
The condycyons, that be in an old man.
Here ye may here of the end of a man's life.
THe last end of man's life is hard
When that he draws to deathwarde
For when he is sick, in any wise
So feable, that he may not arise
Than be men in doubt, and uncertain
Whyther he shall ever recover again
And yet can some men, that be sley
Know whyther he shall life, or dye
Through certain tokens, in pounce and breath
That falls to a man, that draws to death
For than begins his front downewarde to fall
And his brows waxes heavy with all
And the left eye of him, shall seem less
And nerer than that other eye was
And his nose before, shall sharp become
And his chyne than down shall be nome
And his pounce, shall have no meuynge
His fete wax cold, and his womb does clynge
And if a young man, nere his death be
Ever he is waking, for sleep may not he
And if an old man, draw toward death
He shall not from sleep, keep him uneath
Clarckes tells, that these tokens echone
Be in a man, when he shall dye soon
For when a man lives, he is like a man
But when he is blodeles, and becomes wan
Than may a man his lykenes there se
And all changed, as never had been he
And when his life, is brought to the end
Than shall he hence in this manner wend
Both poor and naked, as he hither come
When from his mothers womb, he was nome
For he brought with him, nothing that day
And so he shall hence pass away
But it be only a wyndynge cloth
That shall about him be wrapped forsooth
For when the life wynde^h from him away
Than is he but foul earth and clay
That tourneth to more corrupcyon about
Than any caryon, that lies there out
For the corrupcyon of him in every side
If it lie above ground long, in any tide
It might than the air so corrupt make
So that men should their death thereof take
So soul stynkynge it is, and so vyolent
And so witnesses, the clarcke Innocent.
Quid enim fetidius humano cadau^r^
Quid (...) homine mortuo. etc.
He says, what thing may fouler be
Than a dead man's body, is for to se
And what is more horrible, in any place
Than is to beheld a dead man's face
And when it is, in earth by wound
Worms will do eat it, in a little stounde
Till that foul fless^e, away be ybyte
And thus I find, in holy book ywryte.
^um autem moritur homo hereditabit ^erpente^ and verines.

The book says, that when a man shall dye
As his kind heritage, he takes the way
To worms and adders, that foul be of sight
For to them falls man's flesh by right
Therefore shall every man after earth sleep
Among foul worms, that on them shall crepe
And they shall gnawe his foul ^arkayes
And so says holy wryt, and speaks this ways.
Omnes enim in pu^uere doimien^ and ver^es operient (...).
That is in earth, shall sleep every man
And worms shall ear them, from the ^oe to the pan
For in this world, so wytty man is none
Neither so fair in flesh ne bone
Neither Emperor, King, ne Cease^
Ne none other Lord, what state he have here
Neither rich, ne poor, ne bond, ne fre
Learned ne lewd, what ever he be
That he ne shall turn, after his last day
To earth and to powdre, and to foul clay
Therefore in my thought, I have much wonder
(...)
That no man in earth, uneath will it se
What he was, and is, and what he shall be
But who that will here, in his heart cast
What he first was, and shall be at the last
And also what he is, while he lives here
He should than find, full little mat^ere
To make any mirth here, while he dwells
As a wise vereyfyour in his verse tells.
Si quie sentuet quo tendet and vnde veniret
Numquod gauderet: set in omni tempore fleret.
He says, who that will feel and se
Whence he comes, and whyther shall he
All manner myrthes, he should forsake
And ever weep, and sorrow make
For who that of a man, had than a sight
When worms had gnawen him out right
And eaten his flesh, in to the hard bone
So horrible a sight, saw he never none
As he might se in that carkayes
As saint Bernarde witnesses and says.
Post hominem vermis, post vermen fetor and horror
Et sic in non hominem, vertitur omnis homo.
He says after death, man is worm become
And after worms, to stenche he is nome
And so every man, here turned shall he be
Fro man in to no man, as it were not he
Thus may mense, as it is write
How that a man, in his mother is behyght
And of this matter, more might I tell
But no longer thereon, think I to dwell.
Here begins the second part of this book / that speaks of the world.
ALl this world here, both long and broad
God it made, for man's good
And al other things, as clarckes can prove
He made only for man's byhoue
If a man love any thing more by any way
Than he does God, that in heaven is on hye
Than is that man to God unkind
That so little on him, sets his mind
For God is more worthy, loved to be
Than any creature, that men may se
Sith he is the beginning of all manner thing
And of all thing, make shall an ending
And thus I say by them, that gives them often
To the worlds liking, that thinks them lofte
And loves all thing, that thereto falls
And such men worldely men me calls
For their love most, in the world is set
The which the love of God, slaulyche does let
And for the love of this worlds vanyte
A man at the last, for barred may be
From the hye heaven, where all joy is
There a man shall dwell without end ywys
But a great clarcke tells, that is Bartylmewe
There be two worlds, pryncypally to eschew
And that one world, is inuysyble and clean
And that other bodily, as men may seen
And the ghostly world, that no man may se
Is the hye heaven, where God sytteth in trynyte
And thither shall we come, and there live ay
If that we thytherwarde, hold the right way
Now will I no longer, upon this matter stand
For soon after it shall come more to hand.
BUt the same world, that men may here se
In two parties well devised may be
For both parties, men may well know
For that one is hye, and that other low
The hyer lasts from the moon full even
To the highest place, of the sterred heaven
And that world, is bright and fair
For there is no corrupcyon, but clean air
But sterres and Planettes, bright shynynge
As every man may there have understanding
But the lowest world, that may befall
Conteyneth holly, the Elamentes all
And in this world, is both well and woe
And often time changes, both to and fro
To some it is soft, and to some men hard
As ye shall here soon afterward
But that world, that passes all manner thing
Was made for man's, endeles dwelling
For every man, there shall have a place
Ever to be in joy, that here has grace
And that was made, for our advantage
For there is ordained, our kind heritage
But that other world, that lower is atwyne
Where that the sterres and planettes be set in
God ordained only, for our behoue
By this reason, that I shall prove
For the air from thence, and the hete of the Son
Susteyneth the earth here, where that we wo^ne
And noryssheth all thing, that fruit here gives
To help man and be, that in earth lives
And tempreth our kind, and our complexyon
And sets the times of the year, in their season
And gives us light here, where that we dwell
Else were this world, as dark as hell
And the lowest world, was made for man
And for these encheasones, that I tell can
For man should therein, have his dwelling
And live in Gods service, and do his bidding
And hold his commandments, and done his will
Them to know and keep, and fly all evil
And here to be proved, in ghostly battayles
Of many enemies, that man often assayles
So that through ghostly might and vyctorye
He may get to him endeles glory
And have than the crown, of endeles bliss
Where all joy is, that never shall mysse
Twain worlds together, here may befall
That all men may earthly call
One is this dale, that is our dwelling
Another is man, that is therein abiding
And this same dale, that we dwell in
Is full of sorrow, and all manner sin
That of wise Clarckes, in books called is
The more world, that men may know by this
And of the less world, yet will I naught speak
For in to that matter, soon I will brek^
And of the more world, yet will I tell
Or I go further therein to dwell
Than will I tell, afterward as it falls
The cause why men, a man the world calls.
THe more world, God would in earth set
For it should to man be subget
Man to serve, after his own delight
And so God ordained, for man's proffyte
But now this world, that man lives in
So wicked is, and so full of sin
For many makes the world, their soueraygne
So that all their works, tourneth in to vain
And some man does thereto, all that he may
To serve the world, both night and day
But this world, is nothing else
But the condycyon of men, that therein dwelles
For the worldely men know may naught
But by the condycyons, that they has wrought
For what might men by the world understand
If none worldely men lived in land
But he that serves the world, and has thereto love
Serves the world, and nothing God above
For the world is here, the deuylles servant
And he that it serves, and thereto will grant
And many a man now after the world lysteneth
But I hold him not wise, that thereon trusts
For this world is false, and deceyuable
And in all things wonderly unstable
Therefore I hold a man nothing wytty
That about the world, makes him besy
For a man may not Gods servant be
But he the manners of the world will fle
(...) he may not love God, but he the world despise
(...) the holy Gospel says in this wise.
^emo potest duob^s (...) ^eruire a^t vnum odio habebit (...) and vnum
sus^inebit and asterum contemp^^et.

He says, no man can serve God at will
Neither two lords, that he ne does full evil
For else he shall hate one in his deed
And that other love in his manhede
Other he shall maintain that one outryght
(...) that other despise, and set full light
The world is Gods enemy, and so men should it call
For it is contraryous to his works all
(...) so be euerychone, that the world loves well
As the holy euangelyst, says in the Gospel.
(...) vust esse amicus h^ius mu^d^ inimicus dei co^stitultur.
(...), he that will the worlds friend be
Gods enemy, forsooth than is he
And sore worldly men greueth God ywys
Therefore the Apostell, in his epistle says this.
No^^te diligere mundum nec ea que in mundo su^^t.
Love naught the world says he
Ne nothing that in the world may be
For all that is in this world, that any man te^^ can
Other it is couytous, or lust of flesh of man
Other couytous of eyes, that men may with look
Other pride of life, as witnesses the book.
Omne quod est in mundo aut est concupiscentia carnis aut concupiscentia
ocu^orum, aut superbia vite.

Couytous of flesh, that is seeing
That parteyneth to a man's lust or liking
Couytous of eyes, as every man may guess
Is riches that comes to a man with bliss
And pride of life, that men keeps in thought
And ever desires, to great honor to be brought
And lyckynge and lust, of flesshely majesty
Engenders the foul sin of lecherye
But God made the world, as he is wytnes
For to serve man, in all manner of goodness
Wherefore is man servant to the world than
And make him the worlds bond man
Sith he may serve God, and ever be ^re
And out of the worlds thraldom be
But would a man know right as he should
What the world is, and her falsenes behold
He should have no will, as I understand
After the world any thing to fond
Lo what says Bartholomewe, the great clarke
That speaks of the world, and of her warke.
Mundus nichil aliud est quod quod^am exilium erumpna, labor, dolor, doso,
and tristicia plenus.

He says that the world, is nothing else
But an hard exyle, that a man in dwelles
Both darcke and dym, and a doleful dale
That is full of sorrow, and eke of bale
And a place full of all wretchydnes
Of anger and travail, and all besynes
Of sorrow and sin, and of all folly
Of shendshyp also, and eke vylonye
Of flyttynge also, and of much taxyinge
Of much greuaunce also, and much mourning
Of all manner of fylth, and corrupcyon
Of much wrath, and extorcyon
And fill of gyle, and of falshed
Of great debate, and contynuall dred
So that in this world, is naught man to auaunce
But much sorrow, and hard myschaunce
And pomp and pride, with foul couytyse
With vain glory and sloth, that men often use
The world to him draws all men
And so dysceyueth his lovers then
And to many is grievous, and to few avails
For his lovers, he dysceyueth and fails
And all that despyseth him, he awayteth fast
And thinks them soon, in to myschyfe cast
For them that he loves, he will socour
And make them rich, and great of honor
And to begyle them, he thinks ar the last
And into great myschyfe, he will them cast
Therefore worldly worship, may be told
I vanyte, that dysceyueth both young and old
And worldly richesse, how so it come
I hold naught else, but as fantome
The world has many a man, with vanyte defiled
And with pomp and pride, often them begyled
Therefore an holy man, as ye may here
Speaks unto the world, in this manner.
O munde inmunde vtinam ita inmaundus esses vt me non tangeres, aut ita mundus
esses vt me non conquares.

And that is in english, thus much for to me^^
O thou world he says, that ever art unclean
Why might thou not ever so unclean be
That thou should never nyghe me
Other be so clean, in thy works all
That thou make me in to no sin fall.
How the world may be lykened unto the sea.
THe world may by many encheason
Be lykened to four things by good reason
First may the world be lykened ywys
Most proprely to the sea, that long and broad is
For the sea after her own certain tide
Ebbeth and flows, and may not abide
And through storms waxes kene and blows
And than ryseth tempests and strong wawes*
So fares the world, with his favor
Brings a man in to riches and to honor
But afterward, than he casts him a down
In to much pouerte, and trybulacyown
And those be the great storms and kene
That brings a man, in sorrow and tene.
How the world may be lykened unto a wyldernes.
YEt may the world, that is broad and wide
Be lykened to a wyldernes in every side
That is full of bestes that be wild
As Lions, Lybardes, and Wolfes vnmylde
That will strangle men and dystroye
And slay their beestes, and sore them noye
So is this world full of mysdoers all about
Of many tyrauntes, that brings men in doubt
That ever be besy, both night and day
Men to annoye, in all that they may.
How the world maya be lykened unto a Forest.
ALso the world lykened may be
To a forest, that stands in a wild country
That is full of thieves, and wild our laws
That often times to such forest draws
Hau^teth their hyre pass, robs and reueth
Both men and women, and nothing leueth
So fares this world, that we in dwell
Is full of thieves, that be deuylles of hell
That us awayteth, and ever be besy
(...) to ^obbe and reave our goods ghostly.
How the world may be lykened to a battle in a field.
ANd yet is this world, as ye shall here
May thus be lykened, in the fourth manner
To a fair field, full of diverse battayles
Of strange enemies, y^ each day us assayles
For here we be brought in great doubt
And set with enemies, all hard about
And pryncypally, with these enemies three
But against them, well armed we mught be
That is the world, the fend, and thy flesh
That each day assayleth us like fresh
Therefore us behooves both day and night
For to be ready against them to fight
THe world, as clarckes does us to understand
Against us fyghteth ever, with double hand
Both with the right hand, and the left also
That ever yet, has yben our flesh fo
And wealth the ryghthande, may ben told
And the left hand is hap, and angers cold
For the right hand, assayleth men some while
With wealth of the world them to begyle
And that is wealth, without anger and dolor
Of worldly riches, and great treasour
And with the left hand, he assayleth estsoone
And makes men sorry often, and groan
And that is anger and trybulacyon
And also pouerte, and much persecucyon
Such things Clarckes, the left hand calls
That in this world, among men falls
And with the world comes dame fortune soon
That either hand changes, as the new moon
For ever he tourneth about her whele
Sometime in to woe, and sometime to well
And when she lets the whele about go
Sometime she tourneth from well in to woe
And eftsoon again, form woe in to bliss
And thus turned her whele often is
And that whele Clarckes, naught else calls
But hap or chance, that suddenly falls
And such hap, men holds nothing else
But wrath or have, that in men dwelles
Therefore worldly wleth, is ever more in doubt
While dame fortune, tourneth her whele about
Wherefore perfyte men, that good life led
The wealth of the world, sore they dread
For wealth draws a man from the right way
And ledeth him from God, both night and day
Thus may each man dread wealth, who that can
And so says saint Jerome, the good holy man
The more he says, that a man waxes up right
In wealth other in any worldly might
The more he should, have dread in thought
That from the bliss, he ne fall naught.
Quanto magis in virtutibus crescimus, can to (...) ^mere debemu^nt sublimius
corru^mus.

To this accords a clarcke SEneca the wise
That counceyleth us, the world to despise.
Tune salubre consiliu^ ad^oca cu^ tibi affudu^t mu^di despera.
Seneca says, and gives good counceyll
When this world makes his merucyll
Than seche thy wit, and after counceyll^all
That much wealth make the not fall
For welthynes is but a shadow somdele darcke
And so says saint Gregory, the noble clarcke.
(...) fortunis timenda est: magis (...) prospera quod adnersa.
Saint Gregory says in this ma^er
That if every hap be for to dread here
yet is hap of wealth to dread more
Tha^ any (...) sorrow, though it grieve sore
For anger man^es life cle^seth and proves
And wealth to sin a man soon moves
And so may man his soul lightly spyll
Through welthes, that men have at their will
And so comes afterward, to endless pain
And so witnesses, the doctor sayn^ Au^ayne.
Sanitas continu^^, et rerum habundancia eterna dampnacionis sunt indicia.

He says contynuall hele, and worldly well
As to much ruches and goods feel
Be tokens as in book written is
Of hell dampnacyon endless ywys
And to these words, that some men mysspeaketh
Accords saint Gregory, and thus he says.
Continuus successus rerum temperasium eterne dampnacio^^ est iudicium.

He says, that contynuall hap coming
Of worldly goods, is a tokenynge
Of dampnacyon, that at the last shall be
Before God, that then shall fall without pity
But the world prayseth none men only
But them that to the world be happy
And upon wordly things, sette^^; their heart
And ever flies the simple state of pouerte
Such men be besy, and gathers fast
And fares as their lufe should evermore last
To them the world is queynt and favorable
I^ all thing, that thinks them profitable
And can much of worldly quey^tyse
The world calls them good men and wise
And to them falls riches many fold
But it is their dampnacyon, as I have told
For in heaven, may no man have an home
That follows the world, and his wysoome
And such wisdom, says a wise clarcke and (...)
That before God, it is hold but folly.
Sapiencia hu^u^ (...)
But many to the world, mothe lystet^
And he is not wise, that thereon trusts
For it ledeth a man, with wrynches and wyles
And at the last him it begyles
A man may be calde both wytty and wise
That sets the world at little pryse
And hates the things, that the world loves most
And thinks to bliss, to bring his ghost
And to the world trusts right naught
But ever in that other world, sets his thought
For no sure dwelling, shall we here find
As the apostell Paul witnesses, thus sayende.
Non manentem ciuitatem hi^ habemus set futuram inquitimus.

He says, no sure dwelling here have w^
But seek we another, that ever shall be
And as ge^^^s have our so^^urne
A little time till we hence turn
And that may fall rather than we wen^
For man is here, but as an alya^e
To travail here in way all times
To wend in to our country, as does pylgryines
Therefore the Prophet, unto God speaks thus
As David in the Psalter tells to us.
(...) aduena ego sum apud te (...) vt omnes patres mei. etc.

Be thou still Lord, says he
For why, I am coming toward the
And a pilgrim, as all my fathers were
Thus may, every man se, that lives here
That is to say, Lord be thou not still
That (...) make me here know thy will
And (...) to my soul thou give
That may make her, both glad and blyue
And say thus thereto, I am thy salvation
For thou art my pilgrim trow in devotion.
Of two ways in this world.
TWo ways there be in this world full ryfe
One is way of death, another of life
This world is the way and also passage
Through the which lies our pylgrymag^
By this way all we must needs go
And each man beloueth, that it is so
In this world be two ways of kind
Who that will assay, the soth he may find
One is the way of death here told
And that other is the way of life hold
But the way of death, seems large and easy
For that may us led, even and lightly
To the horrible land of darckenes
Where sorrow and pain is, and wretchydnes
But the way of life, seems narowe and hard
That ledeth us, even to our country ward
And that is the kingdom of heaven bright
Where we shall be in Gods sight
And as Gods sons there ben ytolde
If we do well, both young and old
For the way of the world, is here unstable
And our life also, well chaungeable
As often is seen in many manner wise
Through tempest of wethers, that makes men anguyse
For the world, and the worldly life yfere
Changes full often, and in diverse manner
And in her state dwells but a while
Unneth the space of a little mile
And for the world is so unsteadfast
For all thing thereon soon is ouercast.
Of the unsteadfastness of this world.
GOd ordained, as it was his will
Uaryaunce of the season to fulfill
And diverse wethers, and other seasones
In token of the false worlds condycyones
That so unstable be to man's hand
That little time in their state may stand
For God will that men through tokens may know
How unstable the world is in every throw
So that men thereon the less should trust
And for no wealth thereon, to much have lust
The times changes often, and be not in one state
For now is the morenynge, and now it is late
And now it is day, and now it is night
And now it is darcke, and now it is light
And now is there cold, and now great hete
And now it is dry, and now it is wete
And now it is hayle, and snow full strong
And now fair wether, and Son shine among
And now is the wether clear, and fair with all
And now it is darcke, and rain does down fall
By all the varyaunce men may understand
Are tokens of the world, that is varyande
^et there be mo tokens, that we may lere
Of the unstableness, of this world here
For now is great mirth, and now mourning
And now is laughter, and now weeping
And now men be well, and now be woe
And now is a man friend, and now is fo
And now is a man light, and now is heavy
And now is a man glad, and now is drery
And now have we joy, and now have we pyne
And now have we cattayle, and now we it tyne
And now we be rich, and now we be poor
And now we have little, and now we have more
And now we have rest, and now we have travail
And now find we our strength, what it may avail
And now we be great, and now we be bare
And now we be well, and now we be in care
And now we be light, and now we be slow
And now we be hye, and now we be low
Now love, now hate, now peace, and strife
All these be the manners, of man's life
That ever betokens much unsteadfastness
Of this worlds wealth, that so chaungeable is
And as this life is ever away passing
So is the world every day apparynge
For the world to her end draws fast
As clarckes by many things can cast
Therefore the world, as clarckes has me told
Is as much to mean, as the world that is old
For two earthly worlds to this life befalls
As told is before, as clarckes it calls
But the more world, and also the less
Full chaungeable be, and away does pass
The more world is this world, long and broad
But the less world is lykened to manhood.
How the rowndenes of this world is lykened to a man.
ANd as the more world, is rownde yset
So is the less, as a man that is mer
For in y^ bread of a man, as god world send
As much space fro the long fyngers end
Of the right hand, the arms out spredynge
To the fyngers end of the left hand out stretchynge
And also fro the top above at the crown
Straight to the soole of the foot there down
Than if a man his arms out sprede
No more is the lenght of him, than is the bread
And so may a man be met all about
Ever as acompas, him self without
And thus has the less world, that a man is
Even after the shape of the more world ywys
But these two worlds, the more and the less
At the last time away shall pass
For the more eldre, that they shall bear
The more they enpereth, and become feblere
As me ^ may se, that gives here intent
And so witnesses the great clarcke Innocent.
Senuit iam mu^dus v^erque and mayor mundus and minor and quanto proluxius
vtriusque senectus producitus tant^ deterni^ vtriusque natura conprobatur.

He says, as it is in latyne told
Either world, now waxes full old
And the longer that their time is here sought
And the age of either, other forth ybrought
The more in malice, and in feebleness ywys
The kind of ey^her other m^^led ^s.
Of the condycyons of worldly^^^,
OF those worldly me^ / great outrage me^ may se
Of pomp and pride, and all vanyte
In diverse manner, and in diverse guyse
That now is used in many manner wise
In worldly having, and hye bearing
As in idle apparyle, and foul werynge
The which asks over great costage
And at the last, it tourneth to much outrage
For such dysguysynge, and such manner
As young men now has, as we may lere
For now is every day contynually say
That might before, have be by no way
For thing that sometime was called vylonye
Now young men holds it for great curtesye
And that men sometime for curtesye would call
A^we in little time to bylonye it is fall
For now makes men so often their chaungynge
In many manners, and also of diverse clothing
Nowemen uses short clothes, and now wide
And other while narowe clothes, and over side
And some have their clothing, hanging as stools
And some goes tatered, as it were fools
And some goes wryckynge toward and fro
And some goes skyppynge, as does ado
And so uses men all the new get
And therewith the devil takes them in to his net
And through such uncomely pomp and pride
They ne wot whyther they may gone or ride
For so much pride, as now is ywene
Was never before, among men seen
For such guyses, that comes of wantonhede
I trow that they may be tokens dread
Of great myschyfes, and hasty to understand
That is now in to this world co^mande
And therefore Gods wrath, with them shall mete
As witnesses David the prophet.
Etirritauerunt deum in vanitatibus suis.
And they meued him to wrath says he
In their new fyndynges of vanyte
This may be called, as the book proves
By them that such dysguyses uses
For such men therewith God greueth
And therefore from them his grace he reueth
And God at the last to them will send
Great vengeance, but they them amend
God suffers them a while to have their will
And in their folyes, for to abide still
And that may be known, by many manner of guyse
As saint David witnesses in this wise.
E^ dimisi ^os secundum desideria cordis eorum.
The prophere David speaks, and says thus
In Gods name, as the Psalter tells us
I let them he says, without all manner couerte
After iustes and liking of their own heart
And in their new fyndynges, they shall go
Well may this be said, by them and other mo
That God suffers in folly, and their time leseth
And after their lusts, new fyndynges cheseth
That to the world makes them gay
And from God tourneth, both night and day
And at the last they shall hence wend
To the (...) that be without end
Therefore I counceyll all vanyties to forsake
And in this world, betymes amends make
yet has the world, that is so treacherous
Many other manners, that be contraryous
For now is virtue turned in to vice
And plays mirth and game in to malice
And now is devotion, in many a man's side
Turned all in to boste, and to foul pride
And now is wit and wisdom, hold folly
Both among young and old, turned to trecherye
And now is folly, hold great wisdom
And thereto is turned now, both master and grome
And now is clean love, turned to lecherye
And all ryghtfulnes in to trecherye
And thus is this world, turned up so down
To many a man's soul, great dampnacyown
But such seems as they were wode
For good thing they hold evil, and evil thing good
Woe shall they be therefore, as clarckes can tell
For God him self, witnesses it in the Gospel
Woe to you says Christ, that thinks with your will
That evil thing is good, and good thing evil
That is to say, that them self should be woe
That in this world, myslyueth their life so
And thus is the world, and man's life therein
Full with vanyte, and wretchedness of sin
But some men loves, so much this life
And also the world, that is full of strife
And so they think, never to wend there fro
But ever to dwell here, if it might be so
And loves so much this worlds vanyte
And never desires here, in other life to be
But would a man, well him understand
That the world is besy, a man for to sho^de
And what he shall have thereof at the last end
When he shall from the world wend
Than should him list, both night and day
To forsake myrthes, and sing well away
A man therefore must such works forsake
And to Gods mercy, all his heart take
And led here his life, in mekenes and pouert
In f^stynge, and in penance, and other works smert
And know his conseyence, that is inward
To have the joy of heaven than afterward
And thus should every man, him well be think
If he will Gods grace in him synke
Now have I told you in diverse manner
The condycyons of man's life, and of the world here
And now I will pass furthermore
And speak of the third part, and of his lore
That tells specially, as I shall read
Of death, and wherefore it is to dread.
Here begins the third part of this book / that speaks of death.
DEath is most dredefull thing that is
In all the world, as the book witnesses this
For there is no quycke thing living
That against death is sore dredynge
Flees it as long as he may / but at last it is deaths pray
And when death comes, and makes debate
All thing he brings, in to another state
For no man may against him stand
Whyther he come by water, or by land.
Of three manners of death.
AS Clarckes find written, they redeth
Three manners of death ben y^ men dredeth
One is bodily that after kind does wend
And ye other ghostly, that other without end
And bodily death, that kyndly is wrought
Is when body and soul, a sonder is brought
Death is full hard and bitter, as I shall tell you hereafter
For ghostly death is departing of sin
Between God, and man's soul within
For right as the soul is life of the body
Right so the life of the soul, is God almighty
And as the body is without any doubt
Dead as stone, when man's soul is out
So is the soul of man dead also
When almyghtye God departs there fro
For where sin is, the devil is of hell
And where sin is, God will not dwell
For deedly sin, and the devil, and he
In one place, may not together be
And when man's soul, is bound with sin
God is thence, and the devil dwells therein
Than is the soul dead, before God in deed
While sin and the soul, dwells in one stead.
How a man's soul is dead through sin.
AS a man's body may be s^awe
With w^pyn, that to him may be draw
So is the soul slain through foul synn^
(...)
Than is ghostly death for to dread more
Than any bodily death, though it grieve sore
And in as much, as the soul pryncypally
Is more worthy, than a man's body
For though a man's soul, through sin be dead
And departed from God in his manheade
yet it might ever live, and hard pain find
But the body is deed anon through flesshely kind
But of bodily death is none again tournynge
For of all earthly death, it makes an ending
And that is the way, that we must wend
To ^oye other to pain, that is without end
Nevertheless if the soul with sin be slain
yet he may through grace, be quycked again
For God bought it dear, upon the rode tree
In the joy of Paradyce, with him for to be
For all ghostly wounds, that be of fynne
May here through penance, take hele to win
And though God ever be ryghtfull and mighty
yet he evermore is full of mercy
And to save man's soul, more ready is he
Than any man will, to his mercy fle
For the life of the soul, pleases him more
Than does man's death, as says his lore.
No^o mortem peccatoris sed magis conuertatur vt viuat.

I will not the death of a sinful wight
But he turn him, and do penance right
Than may a sinful man, that his soul has slawe
Be turned to grace, and from dampnacyon be draw.
How in hell is death without end.
ENdeles death, is death of hell
That they shall have, that there shall dwell
For hell is counted a peryllous place
For there is endeles woe, without any grace
Care and sorrow, that never shall lynne
yet may not the soul dye therein
And it might dye, as the body does here
Of all her pain, than delivered she were
For the death of hell, is evermore living
And is strong death, evermore lasting
Of this death men may read and look
In the Psalms of David in his book
Taht speaks much, of the pains of hell
Therefore upon this matter, I will no longer dwell
what manner thing is death.
DEath is naught else sothly
But departing between the soul and the body
And as I have somdele before said
This may be called a deaths brayde
And a very remembrynge of man's life
When the soul parts from the body with strife
As ye may know in your thought
That kyndely darckenes is to be felt naught
But where that no manner light is se
Proprely there is darckenes in every degree
So that darckenes is dyreyuynge of light
So is death of life, when a man is hence twyght
Thus fares death, that all men dredeth most
When the life fails, they yield up the ghost.
Men dredeth death for four things.
Four encheasones in books I read
Why men death so much dread
One is for death is strong and fell
And has more pain, than man can tell
Another is, for the sight that he shall se
Of horrible deuylles, that about him shall be
The third is for acompte that he shall yield
Of all that he has done in youth and elde
The fourth for he is ever than uncertain
Whyther he shall wend to bliss or pain
He woteth not than, how he shall fare
For death is bitter, and full of care
And so it seems well, as says the book
For when Christ dyed in manhed that he took
And or he dyed upon the holy rode
For dread of death, he sweet drops of blood
For he wist, or he to death began pass
What the hard pain, of bodily death was
Than may we know thereby full well
That the pain of man's death, is hard to fel^
And of that death, I may think wonder
For all thing death may break asonder
As it shows by many ways to us
Therefore an holy man, in his book says thus.
Mors soluit omnia.
Death he says, undoes all manner thing
And of man's life, makes an ending
Wherefore death is greatly to be dred
As hereafter it shall be more plainly showed.
Of the first encheason why men dredeth death.
First a man should dread death in his heart
For the pains of death, that be full smerte
That is the last, and also the end
When the soul from the body shall wend
A sorrowful departing is that for to tell
For they love together, evermore to dwell
And none of them, would froin other go
So much love, is between them two
And the sadder that two be together in love
As a man and his wife, through God above
The more sorrow, and the longer mourning
Shall be between them, at their departing
But the body and the soul, with the life
Loves more together, than does man and wife
And whyther that they gone, in good way or evil
Ever together they would be still
But there is encheason, as men may se
Why that they would ever together be
For encheason that God, through his might and wy^
That body and soul, first together knyt
Another is, for that one may nothing do
But if that other, will help thereto
The third is, for they shall together come
Before our Lord God, to their dome
The fourth encheason is, when they come there
Together they shall dwell, without any where
Therefore the more is their pain and care
When that one shall from that other fare
And this departing, may be called death
That flies about, as does a man's breath
Through all lands, both far and nere
And spares nothing, for any powere
For prayer ne gyf^e, that any man may give
Where that death comes, he suffers no man to live
For he ^e spares neither hye ne low
That he ne reueth their life in a little throw
So death has no mercy of no wight
As saint Bernarde witnesses full right.
^on miserietur in opie nec reuereiur diuiciis nec sapientie, nec moribus, nec
etati.

He says that death of pouert no mercy takes
Neither to rich men, reward he has
Neither to wisdom, that men can show
Neither to old men, for their days be few
Death will have neither reverence nor favor
Neither frendshyp of king, ne Emperor
Neither of bishop, ne yet of prelate
Neither of other, what soever they be of state
Therefore saint Bernarde, says thus in his writing
For every man, should dread deaths coming.
Mortem esse co^munem, cunctis scito viuentibus.
Understande thou he says, that death is
To all common, both to more and less
And thus shall death bysyte every man
And yet what he is, no man dyscerne can
But the pain of death, that all shall feel
As tells a Philosopher to us full well.
HE lykeneth a man's life unto a tree
That were waxynge, if it might be
Through a man's heart, wrotes to spring
And in every place, a branch growing
And the crop at y^ mouth, out come might
And to each a ioynte, a root were dyght
And every vain, that is in a man's body
Had a rote fastened full hard thereby
And to every finger, and toes also
Were a rote from the tree growing thereto
That in each lymbe, that is in every side
The rotes of the tree, should thereon betyde
If that tree were so sore pulled out
That the rotes should arise all about
Than should the rotes, the joints strain
And each bone, and synewe also with vain
Than a more pain, can no man cast
Than this (...) long as it might last
And yet the pain of death is hold more
And harder in his time, than this wore
Therefore every man before as it is said
May greatly dread, the hard deaths brayde
But the most dread is then all within
If a man's soul be in deedly sin
And therefore the Prophet, says thus in his book
And warns us echone thereto to look.
O mors quod amara memoria tua homini iniusto.
O thou bitter death, and dredefull says he
Full grysely thing it is for to think on the
And namely to that man, that is full of sin
Wherefore his conscience, is grieved within
Therefore me thinks a man is not sly
That makes not him to death ready
For so certain in earth, is no manner man
That his ending day, forsooth tell can
Neither the time of death, can not look
And so saint Bernarde says in this book.
Quid in rebus hymanis certius est morte
Quid incertius hora mortis inuenietur.
He (...), what is to a man more certain
Than is death, that is so sudden
And what is also more uncertain thing
Than is the time of deaths coming
Therefore saint Austyne, the holy man
Says thus in his book, as I prove can.
^rscis qua hora veniat more ideo se^per vigila vt cu^ veneri^ te peratu^
inu^niat ^ te^pus illius forte nescis vt se^per ideo ee^s peratus.

Man thou know not says he
What time deaths coming shall be
Therefore wake as thou had ever knowing
The tide and time of deaths coming
That death find the when he shall come
All ready to God and buxome
For thou should not, perchance know
The coming of death, to hold the law
And in thy conscience, to make the yare
For when death comes, he will not spare
Than behooves us our life so to cast
As every day of our life, were the last
And every day us aredy to make
As we should each day, the death take
And not abide, till death us vysyte
For saint Austyne in his book thus does write.
(...) nobis vltimu^ dies vt obseruerentur been ceteri di^^
Raro enim perantur remedia, cum mortis veneru^t pericula.
The last day of man here says he
For all other days, better kept should be
For men ordeyneth remedy to late
When perils of death stands at the gate
And in the same state, that he is than
He shall be demed when he is gone
Therefore every man, for dread of lettynge
Should not abide, deaths coming
But make him ready, or he death feel
And than after keep him self well
For when death is to the gate come
Than to late has he his warning nome
For death from a man, his mind byreueth
And no kyndely wit in him byleueth
For than shall he find such pain and dread
That he shall think upon no mysdede
But in this pain, and in nothing else
As the holy man, saint Austyne tells.
Timor mortis totam vitam sibi vendicat lt de peccatis tunc libeat cogitare.
etc.

Dread of death he says, when he assayleth a man
Changes the soul, and makes the body wan
So him lust than to have no thought
Of the sins, that he has here ywrought
Therefore every man amend him here
Or death come and send his messengere
And if a man will before beware
Than of all sins, death shall find him bare
His messenger, well may be called syckenes
That goes before, and brings him indystres
For syckenes often times, pyneth a man so
That for great syckenes his mind is go
For than may ^e think, upon nothing else
But upon the pain, that upon him dwelles
But when death comes to him soon afterward
Than pains shall be (...), that be more hard
For than shall he be let in such dread
So that of him self, he takes little head
And that is reason, for he would naught
Whiles that he might, have God in thought
Therefore he shall then lose clean his mind
And thus we may (...) saint Austyne find.
Hac animaduersione percuttitor peccator vt moriens obliuiscatur sui. qui dum
viueret oblitus est dei sui.

The sinful man he says, as it is write
With the pain of death, shall be ysmyte
That for the pain, that in him shall fall
Forgets him self, when he hence shall
For while that he lived, at his own will
He forgate God, and his hestes would not fill
And also synnefull men, have here no grace
To have repentance, neither time ne space
Thus shall he dye, and so lose heaven bliss
And be put in to pain, without any lysse
For they be unkind, and to God vncurtayes
Therefore saint David, in the Psalter thus says.
(...) sicut homines inoriemini, and sicut vnno de prin^^pibus cadetis.

And sareth thus to men, ye shall dye all
And as on of the princes ye shall fall
That is ye shall dye in the same manner
As all men dyed in this world here
And as the gostes, that fell from heaven
And were put to hell, with an horrible steven
Therefore to every man, it were wisdom
To amend him of sins, or death come
And have God in mind, while his life is
As the Prophet commands, and says this.
Memento creatoris tui antequa^ veniat tempus visitationis tue.

Think man he says, and have in thought
How that made the first of naught
While thou lyuest, and or thy time be
When God with death, will vysyte the
For death clean man's mind breketh
And therefore saint David to God thus speaks.
Domine non est in morte qui memor sit tui.
Lord he says, that man alive is naught
That in time of death, has not the in thought
But men may understand thereby
The death of soul, through sin namely
For the man that of God myndeles is
It seems in soul, that he dead is
For God vysyteth us by every manner way
Where that the tokens of death feel we may
For if we could us well understand
The tokens of death, each day does us fond
Wherefore me thinks, all that here seems
Is more dead than alive, as wise men demeth
For the book tells, and witnesses before
That a man anon as he is bore
Begins toward his death to draw
And with diverse euylles, often is guawe
As angers and syckenes, that falls all day
The which deaths throws, call we may
And in other ways, and perils many one
That often greueth men, in flesh and in bone
Than is our birth here but abiding
A bodily death, that is our ending
For the longer, that a man waxes old
The more may this life death be cold
Than seems our life here nothing else
But as it were death as the book tells
And to that other life, come we naught
Till death this life, to end has brought
But when death of our life, has made an end
Than know we naught, whyther for to wend
Whyther that we shall to well other to woe
But certes to that one we shall go
And to good men, than death is the way
To the joy of heaven, that lasts ay
And to the wicked men, that passes that enter
In the pain of hell, they shall ever be
Therefore saint David the holy prophet
Thus speaks to God, with words sweet.
Qui ^xaltas me de portis mortis vt annu^cie^ oe^s lands tuas.
Lord almighty God, forsooth thou art he
That from the gates of death, have take me
So that I may tell passing all things
The great multitude of thy praysynges
In the holy gates of thy daughter Syon
That gate as Clarckes tells, that can thereon
Is holy Church, that God first chea^e
Through the which, men comes to the gateof peace
And by the gates of death, as we may se
The bitter death of hell, understand may be
From that same place, God keep us might and day
And grant us his love, as he well may
Therefore we should him serve, and his will worche
In the true believe of holy Church
So that we may, than afterward wend
To the cytte of peace, that has none end
But all men that shall to that place come
Hence shall wend through death all and some
But that death to them is nothing evil
That lives here in earth after Gods will
And in such holy life steadfastly dwells
As saint Austyne the holy man, in a book tells.
Mala mors illi putanda non est, quem in vita sua boni actus processerunt.

He says men should not, to them evil death wene
That in good deeds, would his life mean
For nothing makes a man so hye of boste
As evil deeds that follows the death most
For all be deedly, that sin will do
And therefore saint Austyne, says thus thereto.
Non potest male mori qui been vixerit and vix been moritur qui male vixerit.

He says, he may no evil death have
That lives on earth through Gods law
But uneath may men by any reason
Dye in good death, that leads his life in treason
But that man, that hates this lyfes liking
Dare never dread of deaths coming
or after his death here, no pain him deres
As Caton witnesses in this verse.
Non metuit mortem qui sit contempnere vitam.
He says, he that can this life despise
Shall not dread death, in no manner wise
For so did martyrs, that their death sought
For after this world, nothing they wrought
And also holy men, wylled to death be dyght
To dwell in heaven, with God almyght
As the books of their lives, tells to us
For so did an holy man, that says thus*
^upio dissolui ^ esse cum christo.
I covet he says, hence for to wend
Out of this life, and be with Christ without end
For holy men, thought here this life
Was nothing else, but sorrow and strife
Therefore they coueyted, the end of their day
As says an holy man, as I tell may.
Melius est dies mortis quod dies natiuitatis.
He says, better is the day of death alone
Than the day of birth, that is full of moan
For a good man dies, for to go unto rest
Their life is endeles, and joy alther mest
When the soul from the body shall begone
As in Apocalypse, witnesses saint John^.
Beati mortui qui in domino moriuntur.
Blessed be all they, in deed and in word
That dies here in earth, in the honor of our lord
For all that men seth in good life end
They dye with God, and to him shall wend
In to the joy of heaven, that is on high
Well is him that through death, that stead may nyghe
And doubteles, though holy men dyed here well
yet the pains of death they shall feel
But when they shall, a new life win
When the body and soul, departs atwynne
Somedele they shall than have dread
Through mankind, and through manhede
Sith that Christ dred death in his passion
Through kind of his flesh, as it was reason
Than ought a man both less and more,
The bitter pains of death, dread full sore.
The.ij. encheaso^ why me^ dredeth death.
THe second encheason is, as I in book read
Why that death is so greatly to dread
For the dreadful sight of many foul fendes
That a man shall se than, and few other friends
When that this life here draws to y^ end
And woteth not whyther he shall with them wend
For when the life of a man, is in doubt
Than will deuylles come him about
To take the soul, with them away
In to the pain of hell, and that is their pray
For as wode Lyones, they shall than fare
And on him grenne, rore and stare
And horrible rollynge, and on him blere
And with hydeous lokes, to make him fere
And so they will stand, at his ending
If that they might, in wanhope him bring
Through such thretuynge, as they will than make
And through dread, that they shall take
Through hydeous syghtes, that they then will show
The horrible company, that stand shall in rewe
And therefore the prophet saint Ieromye
Witnesses these words in his prophe^ye.
Omnes amici eius apprehend crunt eam inter angustias.
He says, that among his anguysshes great
His enemies should him take, and naught let
Than is no wonder, though the deuylles come
To the sinful man, when death has him nome
As the devil to saint Bernarde came at the last day
To bring the holy man, in to great afray.
How the devil came and appeared unto saint Bernarde.
IT is found in the life of saint Bernarde
When he drew to his death, ward
That the devil of hell, so horrible of hew
Asked of saint Bernarde, with words few
Wherefore he asked the kingdom of heaven
Sith he had gylt in the sins seven
Then answered saint Bernarde to him this
That I am not worthy, I wot ywis
Through my^e own sins, it for to have
(...) I shall hence wend to my grave
But through my lord Jesus full of might
That all thing governs, as it is right
As through right of his fathers heritage
And also for christen men's advantage
And through right of his hard passion
That he suffered here, for our salvation
That heritage freely, he granted me
And also that other part to him should be
Of whose right, I ask that heaven rich
After his mercy, that nothing is lyche
When the devil hard him thus say
As overcome he went his way
And anon saint Bernarde, when this was done
Came again to his mind, that erst was gone
And anon dyed afterward the
And even his soul to bliss began go
But it is more wonder all for to tell
Why that God suffers, the devil of hell
To appear to him, that is of might most
When that he dyed, and gave up his ghost
For the great Clarckes, witnesses it
In their own books, that be of holy wryt
Than seemed it well, that God would thus
Suffer the devil of hell, to appear to us
In time of death, at our last end
When we shall all hence wend
But a strong pain, to us that shall be
The great sight of deuylles, that than we shall se
For they be so horrible, as tells the book
And so black, and dredefull upon to look
So that all manner of men, that I may deuyse
Of the foul sight of them, may sore agryse
For all manner men, that be in earth alive
So horrible a sight, can never descryue
Nor none so qu^ynte a payntour, yt might bring to pass^
Neither man so wytty, never yet was
That could ought ymagyne, of their horryblenes
Other paynte any point after their lykenes
For their shape in this world, may no man make
Ne se the same form, that they have take
But if the deuylles, had of God so large powere
In their own form, to show them here
Lose they should their mind, and be sore aghast
For cause that they be in to such form cast
But so hardy man was never yet none
That lived in earth, in flesh and bone
If he saw the devil, in his form aryght
That he ne should for dread of that foul sight
Anon right to dye, other to lose his wit
As soon as he had beholden it
But in the same form, as I tell can
Sethem never here no lives man
But only to them, that death is nere
For God has bynome them their powere
So that they may tempte no man, ne grieve
Further then our lord God, has given them leave
But anon as death asayleth a man
In the foulest form, they will appear than
For because that every man, dredynge should be
Against the same time, that he should them se.
BUt to you all, I will tell sothly
Wher^ore the deuylles be all so gresely
For when that they were Angels bright
As tho y^ be in heaven, before Gods sight
And from yt place, through sin they fell
And anon byco^men foul fendes of hell
And were horrible fygured through sin
And so they were all wrapped therein
For if sin ne were, they had be still
Bright Aungelles, as they were through Gods will
And now they be horrible, and unseemly
And that was through sin of pride only
Than is sin fouler, and more loathsome
Than is the devil, that from hell may come
For Clarckes tells it, that be of co^nynge
That sin is so foul, and so horrible a thing
That if a man might se, before him his sin
In the same lykenes, that he falls in
He should rather than for dread it fle
Than any devil of hell, that he might se
Than is the soul of a sinful man within
Fouler than the devil, if he be in sin
Therefore a man should, where that he wendes
More dread sin, than any sight of fendes
That shall come to him, at his ending
For his sins indyspayre him to bring
Of which sins, he would him not shryfe
Ne take no repentance here in his life
For us behooves euerychone, in Gods own sight
yield our accomptes of wrong and of right
And of all things, that ever we have wrought
Both in work, and in will, and every mysthought.
Of the third encheason why men dredeth death.
THe third encheason, is to our understanding
Why every man dredeth deaths coming
For all thing shall be showed and se^e
Both good, evil, foul, and also clean
And there ben rehearsed, as the book tells right
Between foul fendes, and Aungelles bright
Than shall they despute there, all our life
With great sorrow, both care and strife
For in the same time, all thing shall be known
And in the same day, nothing ben hydden
But only sin, that is cleansed here
And all good deeds done in good manner
Than shall we all there, both here and se
All manner pryuyties, that ever wrought we
And therefore God says in his Gospel
In the same manner, that I will you tell.
Niehil opertum quod non reuelabitur.
There is no manner of thing here so hydden
That ne shall than be showed and known
And still there abide must we
Till there all our life clean examyned be
Therefore saint Ancelme, as the book tells us
Speaks to the soul sharply thus
Thou wretched soul says he, what might thou wyn
When thou from thy body depart shall atwyn
For than behooves the acomptes to yield
Of all that thou have done in youth and in elde
From the beginning, that thou could wit
Unto the last day, for thou might not flyt
And than shall welaway, forsooth he thy song
For thou have spended thy life here in wrong
And than shall all thy sins here ben showed
Whyther so that thou be lered other lewed
Of which sin, thou shall more dread
Than of all the deuylles, that thither the will led
And thus shall every man, at his ending
There be brought to an hard reckoning
For no sin than to him shall be untold
Be it never so pryue, other kept in hold
And I find written, three causes why
That no man may trust than sykerly
Upon his good deeds, that he has done here
And the causes why, be good to lere
One is that all things, that good be
From God they come, and not from the
So that all good deeds, that here be wrought
Be Gods own deeds, and ours right naught
But all our sins, that we may do known
Comes all from our selfs, and they be our own
And an other cause there is also
For because that we be ready euermo
An hundred times rather to do sin
Than once a good deed here to begin
And thus we may acompte, re^en, and read
An hundred sins against one good deed
The third cause is, for to show among
For often times our deeds be done with wrong
And not in good manner, as they ought to be
And perchance they be done out of charity
And therefore our good deeds, pure good are naught
But saint Austyne says, our evil pure evil are wrought*
Omnes iniusticie nostre quasi pannus menstruatus.

He says, our good deeds may be seen
As a cloth defouled with thing unclean
Therefore for certain knows no manner man
How he shall fare, when he his way take can
But we shall believe without any manner dread
That every man shall have after his own deed
But thereof be we not syker in our life days
As witnesses an holy man, and in this manner says*
Nescit homo vtrum sit dignus pro actibus suis amore vel odio.

He says for certain, a man knows naught
Though he have here, never s^ much good wrought
Whyther that he be worthy after his deed
To have the love of God, other else hatred
And also Isodore, as the book tells us
Accords well thereto, and says all thus.
Seruu and dei dum bonum agit, vtrum sit ei ad bonum incertus est. etc.

He says, the man that is Gods servant
That to all goodness, makes his haunt
yet is he nothing certain in thought
Whyther it be good to him, other it be naught
Wherefore our living is here full hard
As witnesses the holy man, saint Bernarde.
Quis potest hic vitam suam ducere sine tribulatione and dolor.

He says, who may here this life led
Without trybulacyon, anger, and dread
Therefore saint Bernarde, says thus here
And speaks of man's life, in this manner.
Terret me tota vita mea que diligentur discussa apperet michi aut peccatum,
aut sterilitas, aut res sunilata et imperfecta. etc.

Saint Bernarde, the holy man says this
All my life here, sore greueth me ywis
For if it well and even dyscussed be
Nothing else it seems to me
But sin that the soul most dereth
Other barayne thing, that no fruit bears
And if any fruit might thereon seem
It must thus be said, ryghtly to deem
Other a faynynge thing, to show in sight
Other a thing that is done naught by all right
So it may for nothing ben forth brought
To please almighty God, that made us all of naught
So that all a man's life, is with sorrow lad
Therefore no wonder, though a man selde be glad
What may a sinful man say thereto
Sith he that was an holy man of life euermo
Could no manner fruit in him self se
Than may another man, dread and sorry be
Of this life here, that ever is so unclean
In the which there may no fruit be seen.
Of the fourth encheason why men dredeth death.
THe fourth encheason is, and the last to tell
Why men dredeth death, yt is so bitter and fell
Is for a man knows not whyther to wend
To joy other to pain, after his lyfes end
For so wise a man, was never yet none
That wist when to death, he should gone
Ne whyther he should from hence fare
To joy without end, or else to care
For when deuylles and the Aungelles bright
Has desputed our life aryght
Whyther that God will us dampne or save
For than our dome we shall have
And whyther that we shall to joy, or pain
And therefore in certain puts us saint Austayne.
Been de die nouissiino vnusquisque pensare debet quia vnumquemque in eodem
statu quo inuenerunt eum suus nouissimus dies: talis eum dominus iudi cabit in
nouissimo iudicio. etc.

Every man he says, that hence shall away
Should have dread of his last day
For in what manner state, that he than be found
In such he shall be demed, in a little stounde
Therefore the last day, that may us befall
Our day of dome, we may well call
But at our last day, when Gods sone shall come
Than with our bodies, up we shall be nome
Before our Lord God, that almighty king is
That all thing shall deem that day ywis
For all bodies shall wend in to that place
Where souls shall be demed, through Gods grace
And other they shall have full joy yfere
Other full pain, when they be there
And afterward, they shall both together dwell
Whyther that they wend to heaven, other to hell
But here in earth, shall the bodies all
Abide till the day of dome shall fall
And that day shall be full straight and hard
As this book tells son hereafterwarde
But the sinful soul, goes than to hell
There without end, in pain for to dwell
But the good soul than goes full even
Without any lettynge, in to the bliss of heaven
But many a soul, that God will save
He grants them mercy, that it will crave
For in the bliss of heaven, may no soul be se
But he for his sins penytent before he
Other here does penance, as Clarckes tells
With a contryte heart, who God forgyueth
And when manues soul, is cleansed well
Of all deedly sins, and also of venyell
Through penance here done, and also almysdede
Aungelles full soon to heaven shall him led
Or else when it is passed from the body away
Into the pain of hell, that shall last ay
Therefore every man, that can wisdom
Should here beware, or that death come
And make him all ready, and cleanse him clean
Of all manner of sins, that none be seen
So that death him find clean of all
When the body and soul depart shall
And evermore think, upon his lyfes end
While that he lives here, or he hence wend
And so he may him keep, from the deuylles seruyse
And thus teaches us all, Solomon the wise.
In omnibus operibus tuis memorare nouissim^ tua.
He says think every man, on thine ending day
If that thou thynkest, almighty God to pay
Ever when thou thynkest any thing begin
Than shall thou not fall in to any manner sin
And think that thou shall dye, and know never when
Another in what state thou might be than
Therefore upon the morn, when thou see light
Think that thou may dye, long or it be night
And when thou go to bed, if thou be wise
Think that thou shall dye, happily or thou arise
For saint Austyne the holy man, says thus in his book
Let ever thine heart, thine last day look.
Now have ye hard, this treatise yrade
And this in your conscience openly sprade
For the love of our lord Jesus
Pray for him that this book drew
And for him also, that redeth it here
Whyther so be that he go far other nere
As for the most sinful man, that lives by bread
That God forgive him his sins, or he be dead
And that God save them both, from all wyckednes
And maintain their lives in all goodness
And bring them both to that joyful place
To endless joys, in sight of Gods face
Unto that same joy, he us bring
That for our love, maked al thing
Send us to that joy, that is fair and bright
Where evermore is day, and never night.
Amen.
