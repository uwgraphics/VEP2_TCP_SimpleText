Mr Thomas Coriat to his friends in England sends greeting: From Agra the
Capital City of the Dominion of the Great MOGOLL in the Eastern India, the
last of October, 1616.



Thy Travels and thy Glory to ennamell,
With Fame we mount thee on the lofty Cammell;
But Cammels, Elephants, nor Horse nor Ass
Can bear thy Worth, that worthless do surpass.
The World's the beast that must thy Palfrey be,
Thou rid'st the World, and all the World rides thee.
At London printed by I. B. 1618

Certain Verses in commendations of this mirror of footmanship, this
Catholic or universal Traveler, this European, Asian, African Pilgrim,
this well letterd, well litterd discouerer and Cosmographicall describer Master
Thomas Coriat of Odcombe.
O Thou whose sharp toes cuts the Globe in quarters,
Among Jews and Greeks and tyrannizing Tartars:
Whose glory through the vastie Welkin rumbles,
And whose great Acts more then nine Muses mumbles,
Whose rattling Fame Apollo's daughters thunders,
Midst Afric monsters, and amongst Asian wonders.
Accept these footed verses I implore thee,
That here (Great Footman) go on foot before thee:
To sing thy praise I would my Muse enforce,
But that (alas) she is both harsh and hoarse:
And therefore pardon this my Loves Epistle,
For though she cannot sing, I Will make her whistle.
IN PRAISE OF THE Author Master Thomas Coriat.
THou that the world with pleasures full have pleasur'd,
And out of measure many kingdoms measured.
Whilst men (like swine) do in their vices wallow,
And not one dares for's ears thy steps to follow:
Not one within the Compass of the Cope,
Like thee that dare suruay the Horoscope:
For who is he that dares call it a lie,
That thou have trotted into Italy;
By th'edge of France, and skirts of Spain thou have rambled,
Through Belgia and through Germany thou have ambled.
And, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Austria,
Pruce, Poland, Hungary, Muscouia,
With Thracia, and the land of merry Greeks,
All these and more applaud thee, that who seeks
Upon the top of Mount Olimpus front,
Perhaps may see thy name insculp'd upon it,
And he that durst detract thy worthin Europe,
I wish he may be hanged up in a new rope.
It were a world of business to repeat
Thy walks through both the Asiaes, less and great,
Whereas (no doubt) but thou have taken suruay
Of China and the kingdom of Catay.
The East Indies, Persia, Parthia, Media,
Armenia, and the great Ass-iria,
Caldea, Jury, (if we not mistake us)
Thou have over looked the Sea called Mortuus Lacus.
And I durst venture somewhat for a wager
Thou have seen Ionia, Lidia, Misia Mayor,
Old Iliums Ruins, and the wracks of Priam,
But of Invention I (alas) so dry am,
I beat my brains, and with outrageous thumping,
My lines fall from my pen with extreme pumping.
Auaunt dull Morpheus, with thy Leaden spirit,
Can matter want of him that wants no merit?
As he through Syria and Arabia's coasting,
My lines from Asia into Afric poasting,
I Will follow him along the River Nilus,
In Egypt, where false Crocodiles beguile us.
Through Mauritania to the Town of Dido,
That slew her self by power of god Cupido.
The Kingdoms vnsuruai'd he will not leave one
From Zona^ oride, to the Frozen Zone.
With Prester John in Aethiopia
And th'ayrie Empire of Eutopia.
A LITTLE REMEMBRANCE OF his variety of Tongues, and Politic form of TRAVEL.
A Very Babell of confused Tongues
Unto thy little Microcosme belongs,
That to what place soever thou do walk,
Thou will lose nothing through the want of talk.
For thou can kiss thy hand, and make a leg,
And wisely can in any language beg,
And sure to beg it is policy (I note)
It sometimes saues the cutting of thy throat:
For the worst thief that ever lived by stealth,
Will never kill a beggar for his wealth.
But who is it but thy wisdom does admire,
That does unto such high conceits aspire.
Thou take the bounty of each bounteous giver,
And drink'st the liquor of the running river:
Each Kitchen where thou come, thou have a Cook,
Thou never run'st on score unto the Brook;
For if thou did, the Brook and thou would gree,
Thou runst from it, and it does run from thee.
In thy return from Agra and Assmere
By thy relation following does appear,
That thou do purpose learnedly to fling
A rare Oration to the Persian King.
Then let the idle world prate this, and that,
The Persian King will give thee (God knows what*)
And furthermore to me it wondrous strange is,
How thou do mean to see the River Ganges,
With Tigris, Euphrates, and Nimrods Babell,
And the unhappy place where Caine slew Abell.
That if thou were in Hebrew circumsised,
The Rabbyes all were wondrous ill advised:
Nay more, they were all Coxecombes, all stark mad
To think thou were of any Tribe but Gad.
Sure, in thy youth thou eat'st much running fare,
As Trotters, Neates-feete, and the swift-foot Hare,
And so by inspiration fed, it bred
Two going feet to bear one running head.
Thou fil'st the Printers Press with Grief and mourning,
Still gaping, and expecting thy returning:
All Pauls-Church yard is filled with melancholy,
Not for the want of Books, or wit; but folly.


It is for them, to grieve too much for thee,
For thou will come when thou thy time shall see.
But yet at one thing much my Muse does muse,
Thou aust so many commendations use
Unto thy Mother and to diverse friends,
Thou have ^^membred many kind commends,
And till the last thou did forget thy Father,
I know not why, but this conceit I gather,
That as men sitting at a feast to eat,
Begin with Beef, Porke, Mutton, and such meat;
And when their stomachs are a little cloyd,
This first course then the voyder does avoid:
The anger of their hunger being past,
The Pheasant and the Partridge comes at last.
This (I imagine) in thy mindedid fail,
To note thy Father last to close up all.
First to thy Mother here thou do commend,
And lastly to thy Father thou do send:
She may command in thee a Filial awe,
But he is but thy Father by the Law.
To hear of thee, mirth every heart does cheer,
But we should laugh outright to have thee here.
For who is it that knows thee, but would choose,
Farther to have thy presence then thy news.
Thou show how well thou setst thy wits to work,
In tickling of a misbeleeuing Turk:
He called thee Giaur, but thou so well did answer
(Being hot and fiery, like to crabbed Caneer)
That if he had a Turk of ten pence bin,
Thou told'st him plain the errors he was in;
His Alkaron, his Moskyes are whim-whams,
False bug-beare bables, fables all that dams,
Sleights of the Devil, that brings perpetual woe,
Thou wast not mealy mouthed to tell him so.
And when thy talk with him thou did give ore,
As wise he parted as he was before:
His ignorance had not the power to see
Which way or how to edify by thee:
But with the Turk (thus much I build upon)
If words could have done good, it had been done.


The superscription, Sent from Azmere, the Court of the great and mightiest
Monarch of the East, called the Great MOGVLL in the Eastern Jndia: To be
conuaid To my dear and loving Mother Mris: Garthered Coriat, at her house in
the Town of Evil in Somersetshire.

I pray you deliver this letter at Gerards Hall to Christopher Guppie a
Carrier, (if he be yet living) or else to some other honest trusty Messenger,
to be conuaid with all convenient speed to the place aforesaid.

Master Thomas Coriats Commendations to his friends in England. FromAgra the
Capital City of the Dominion of the Great MOGOLL in the Eastern India, the
last of October, 1616.
Most dear and well-beloved Mother,
THough I have superscribed my letter from Azmere, the Court of the greatest
Monarch of the East called the Great Magoll in the Eastern India, which I did
to this end, that those that have the charge of conueiance thereof, perceiving
such a title, may be the more careful and diligent to convey it safely to your
hands: yet in truth the place from which I wrote this letter is Agra, a City in
the said Eastern India, which is the Metropolitan of the whole Dominion of the
foresaid King Mogol, and 10 days iourny from his Court at the said Azmere.
From the same Azmere I departed the 12 day of September, An. 1616, after my
abode there 12 months and 60 days; which though I confess it were a too long
time to remain in one and the selfsame place, yet for two principal causes
it was very requisite for me to remain there some reasonable time: first to
learn the languages of those Countries, through which I am to pass betwixt
the bounds of the Teritories of this Prince and Christendom, namely these
three, the Persian, Turkish, and Arab: which I have in some competent measure
attained unto by my labor and industry at the said Kings Court, matters as
available unto me as money in my purse, as being the chiefest or rather only
mean to get me money if I should happen to be destitute, a matter very
incidentall to a poor Footman Pilgrim, as my self in these heathen and
Mohammedan Countries through which I travel: Secondly, that by the help of one
of those languages, I mean the Persian, I might both procure unto my self
access unto the King, and be able to express my mind unto him about the
matter for the which I should have occasion to discourse with him. These were
the reasons that moved me so long to tarry at the Mogols court, during which
time I abode in the house of the English Merchants my dear Countrymen, not
spending one little piece of money either for diet, washing, lodging* or any
other thing. And as for the Persian tongue, which I studied very earnestly, I
attained to that reasonable skill, and that in a few months, that I made an
Oration unto the King before many of his Nobles in that language, and after I
had ended the same, discoursed with his Majesty also in that tongue very
readily and familiarly; the copy of which speech, though the tongue it self will
seem to an Englishman very strange and vncuth, as having no kind of affinity
with any of our Christian languages, I have for nouelty sake written out in
this letter, together with the translation thereof in English, that you may
show it to some of my learned friends of the Clergy, and also of the temporalty
in Evil, and elswere, who belike, will take some pleasure in reading so rare and
unusual a tongue as this is. The Persian is this that follows.

Mogoll, before diverse of his Nobles.

The English of it is this.
LOrd This is the ordinary title that is given him by all strangers
Protector of the world all hail to you* I am a poor Traveler and world seer,
which am come hither from a far country, namely England, which ancient
Historians thought to have been situated in the farthest bounds of the West,
and which is the Queen of all the Islands in the world. The cause of my coming
hither is for four respects. First to see the blessed face of your Majesty,
whose wonderful fame has resounded over all Europe and the Mohammedan
Countries. When I heard of the fame of your Majesty, I hastened hither with
speed and traveled very cherefully to see your glorious Court. Secondly, to
see your Majesty's Elephants, which kind of beasts I have not seen in any other
country. Thirdly, to see your famous River Ganges, which is the Captain of all
the Rieuer of the world. The fourth is this, to entreat your Majesty that you
would vouchsafe to grant me your gracious Pass that I may travel into the
Country of Tartaria to the City of Samarcand, to visit the blessed Sepulcher
of the Lord of the Corners (this is a title that is given to Tamberlaine in
this Country in that Persian language, and whereas they call him the Lord of the
Corners, by that they mean that he was Lord of the corners of the world, that
is, the highest and supreme Monarch of the Universe): whose fame by reason of
his wars and victories, is published over the whole world: perhaps he is not
altogether so famous in his own Country of Tartaria, as in England. Moreover, I
have a great desire to see the blessed Toombe of the Lord of the Corners for
this cause; for that when I was at Constantinople, I saw a notable old building
in a pleasant garden near the said City, where the Christian Emperor that was
called Emanuell made a sumptuous great Banquet to the Lord of the Corners,
after he had taken Sultan Batazet in a great battle that was fought near the
City of Bursia, where the Lord of the Corners bound Sultan Batazet in fetters
of Gold, and put him in a cage of Iron. These 4 causes moved me to come out of
my native Country thus far, having traveled a foot through Turkey and
Persia, so far have I traced the world into this Country, that my pilgrimage
has accomplished three thousand miles, wherein I have sustained much labor and
toil, the like whereof no mortal man in this World did ever perform to see
the blessed face of your Majesty since the first day that you were inaugurated
in your glorious Monarchall throne.

After I had ended my speech, I had some short discourse with him in the
Persian tongue who amongst other things told me, that concerning my travel to
the City of Samarcand, he was not able to do me any good, because there was no
great amity betwixt the Tartarian Princes and himself, so that his
commendatory letters would do me no good. Also he added, that the Tartars did
so deadly hate all Christians, that they would certainly kill them when they
came into their Country. So that he earnestly diswaded me from the iourny, if I
loved my life and welfare; at last he concluded his discourse with me by a sum
of money that he threw down from a window through which he looked out, into a
sheet tied up by the four corners, and hanging very near the ground a hundred
pieces of silver, each worth two shillings sterling, which cou^teruailed ten
pounds of our English money: this business I carried so secretly by the help of
my Persian, that neither our English Ambassador, nor any other of my Countrymen
(saving one special, private, and intrinsical friend) had the least inkling of
it, till I had thoroughly accomplished my design: for I well knew that our
Ambassador* would have stopped and Barracadocd all my proceeding therein, if he
might have had any notice thereof, as indeed he signified unto me after I had
effected my project, aleaging this forsooth for his reason why he would have
hindered me, because it would redound some what to the dishonor of our Nation,
that one of our Country should present himself in that beggarly and poor
fashion to the King out of an insinuating humor to crave money of him, but I
answered our Ambassador in that stout and resolute manner after I had ended my
business, that he was contented to cease nibling at me, never had I more need of
money in all my life then at that time: for in truth I had but twenty shillings
sterling left in my purse by reason of a mischance I had in one of the Turks
Cities called Emert in the country of Mesopotamia, where a miscreant Turk
stripped me of almost all my moneys, according as I wrote unto you in a very
large letter the last year, which I sent from the Court of this mighty Monarch
by one of my Countrymen that went home by Sea in an English ship laden with
the commodities of this India, which letter I hope came to your hands long
since. After I had been with the King, I went to a certain noble and generous
Christian of the Armenia^ race, 2 days iourny from the Mogols court, to the
end to observe certain remarkable matters in the same place, to whom by means
of my Persian tongue I was so welcome that he entertained me with very civil
and courteous complement, and at my departure gave me very bountifully twenty
pieces of such kind of money as the King had done before, cou^teruailing 40
shillings sterling. About ten days after that, I departed from Azmere the
court of the Mogol Prince, to the end to begin my Pilgrimage after my long rest
of fourteen months back again into Persia, at what time our Ambassador gave
me a piece of Gold of this Kings Coin worth four and twenty shillings, which
I will save (if it be possible) till my ariuall in England: so that I have
received for beneuolences since I came into this country twenty marks sterling
saving two shillings eight pence, and by the way upon the confines of Persia
alitle before I came into this country three and thirty shillings four pence
in Persian money of my Lady Sherly: at this present I have in the City of Agra
where hence I wrote this letter, about twelve pounds sterling, which according
to my manner of living upon the way at twopence sterling a day (for with that
proportion I can live pretty well, such is the cheapnes of all eatable things
in Asia, drinkable things costing nothing, for seldom do I drink in my
pilgrimage any other liquor then pure water) will mainetaine me very
competently three years in my travel with meat drink and clothes. Of these
gratuities which have been given me willingly, would I send you some part as a
demonstration of the filial love and affection which every child bred in
ciuility and humility ought to perform to his loving and good mother: but the
distance of space betwixt this place and England, the hazard of men's lives in
so long a ioureny, and also the infidelity of many men, who though they live to
come home, are unwilling to render an account of the things they have received,
do not a little discourage me to send any precious token unto you; but if I
live to come one day to Constantinople again (for thither do I resolve to go
once more by the grace of Christ, and therehence to take my passage by land
into Christendom over renouned Greece) I will make choice of some substantial
and faithful Countriman, by whom I will send some pretty token as an expression
of my dutiful and obedient respect unto you. I have not had the oppertunity to
see the King of Persia as yet since I came into this country, but I have
resolved to go to him when I come next into his Territories, and to search him
out wheresoever I can find him in his Kingdom; for seeing I can discourse with
him in his Persian tongue, I doubt not but that going unto him in the form of
a Pilgrim, he will not only entertain me with good words, but also bestow
some worthy reward upon me beseeming his dignity and person; for which cause I
am provided before hand with an excellent thing written in the Persian tongue
that I mean to present unto him: and thus I hope to get beneuolences of worthy
persons to maintain me in a competent manner in my whole pilgrimage till I come
into England, which I hold to be as laudable and a more secure course then if I
did continually carry store of money about me. In the letter which I wrote unto
you by an English ship the last year, I made relation unto you both of my
iourny from the once holy Jerusalem hither and of the state of this Kings
Court, and the Customs of this Country, therefore I hold it superfluous to
repeat the same things again, but what the countries are, that I mean to see
betwixt this and Christendom, and how long time I will spend in each country,
I am unwilling to advertise you of at this present, desiring rather to signify
that unto you after I have performed my design then before; howbeit in few
words, I will tell you of certain Cities of great renown in former times, but
now partly ruined, that I resolve (by Gods help) to see in Asia, where I now
am, namely ancient Babylon and Nymrods Tower, some few miles from Niniue, and
in the same the Sepulcher of the Prophet Jonas, spacious and goodly; Caire in
Egypt, heretofore Memphis, upon the famous River Nilus, where Moises, Aron, and
the children of Israel lived with king Pharaoh, whose ruined Palace is showed
there til this day, and a world of other mouable things as memorable as any
City of the whole world yields, saving only Jerusalem: but in none of these
or any other Cities of note do I determine to linger as I have done in other
places, as in Constantinople, and Azmere, in this Eastern India, only some
few days will I tarry in a principal city of fame, to observe every principal
matter there and so be gone. In this City of Agra where I am now, I am to
remain about six weeks longer, to the end to expect an excellent opportunity,
which then will offer it self unto me to go to the famous River Ganges, about
five days iourny from this, to see a memorable meeting of the gentle people of
this country called Baieans, whereof about four hundred thousand people go
thither of purpose to bathe and shave themselves in the River, and to sacrifice
a world of gold to the same River, partly in stamped money, and partly in massy
great lumpes and wedges, throwing it into the River as a sacrifice, and doing
other strange Ceremonies most worthy the observation, such a notable spectacle
it is, that no part of all Asia, neither this which is called the great Asia,
nor the lesser, which is now called Natolia, the like is to be seen; this show
do they make once every year, coming thither from places almost a thousand
miles off, and honor their River as their God, Creator, and Savior;
superstition and impiety most abominable in the highest degree of these brutish
Ethnicks, that are aliens from Christ and the commonwealth of Israel. After I
have seen this show, I will with all expedition repair to the city of Lahore,
twenty days iourny from this and so into Persia by the help of my blessed
Christ.

Thus have I imported unto you some good accidents that happened unto me since
I wrote a letter unto you the last year from the Kings Court, and some little
part of my resolution for the disposing of a part of my time of abode in Asia:
Therefore now I will draw to a conclusion; the time I cannot limit when I shall
come home, but as my merciful God and Savior shall dispose of it. A long
rabble of comme^dations like to that which I wrote in my last letter to you I
hold not so requisite to make at this present: Therefore with remembrance of
some few friends names, I will shut up my present Epistle. I pray you
recommend me first in Odcombe to Master Gollop, and every good body of his
family, if he lives yet, to Master Berib, his wife and all his Family, to all
the Knights, William Chunt, John Selly, Hugh Done, and their wives, to Master
Atkins and his wife at Norton, I pray commend me in Evil to these, to old Mr
Seward if he lives, his wife and children; the poor Widow Darby, old Master
Dyer, and his Son John, Master Ewins old and young with their wives, Master
Phelpes and his wife, Master Star and his wife, with the rest of my good
friends there, (I had almost forgotten your husband) to him also, to Ned Barber
and his wife, to William Ienings: commend me also I pray you, and that with
respectfull and dutiful terms to the godly and reverent fraternity of
Preachers that every second Friday meet at a religious exercise at Evil, at
the least if that exercise does continue, pray read this letter to them, for I
think they will be well pleased with it by reason of the novelties of things.
And so finally I commit you and all them to the blessed protection of Almighty
God.

From Agra the Capital of the Dominion of the great Mogoll in the Eastern
India the last of October 1616. Your dutiful loving and obedient Son, now a
desolate Pilgrim in the World. THOMAS CORIAT.

The Copy of a speech that J made to a Mohammedan in the Italian tongue.
THe Copy of a speech that I made extempore in the Italian tongue to a
Mohammedan at a City called Moltan in the Eastern India, two days iourny
beyond the famous River Indus, which I have passed, against Mahomet and his
accursed Religion, upon the occasion of a discurtesie offered unto me by the
said Mohammedan in calling me Gtaur, that is infidel, by reason that I was a
Christian: the reason why I spoke to him in Italian, was because he understood
it, having been taken slave for many years since by certain Florentines in a
Gally wherein he passed from Constantinople toward Alexandra, but being by
them interrupted by the way, he was carried to a City called Ligorne in the
Duke of Florences Dominions, where after two years he had learned good
Italian, but he was an Indian borne and brought up in the Mohammedan Religion. I
pronounced the speech before an hundred people, whereof none understood it but
himself, but he afterward told the meaning of some part of it as far as he
could remember it to some of the others also. If I had spoken thus much in
Turkey, or Persia against Mahomet they would have roasted me upon a spitt; but in
the Mogols Dominions a Christian may speak much more freely then he can in
any other Mohammedan Country in the world. The speech was this as I afterward
translated it into English.

But I pray thee tell me thou Mohammedan, do thou in sadness call me Giaur?
that I do quoth he, then (quoth I) in very sobersadnes I retort that shameful
word in thy throat, and tell thee plainly that I am a Musulman and thou art a
Giaur: For by that Arab word Musulman thou do understand that which cannot be
properly applied to a Mohammedan but only to a Christian, so that I do
consequently infer that there are two kinds of Muselmen, the one an
Orthomusulma^, that is a true Musulman which is a Christian and the other a
Pseudo-musulman that is a false Musulman which is a Mohammedan. What, thy
Mahomet was from whom thou do derive thy Religion, assure thy self I know
better then any one of the Mahometans amongst many millions: yea all the
particular circumstances of his life and death, his Nation, his Parentage, his
driving Camels through Egypt, iria, and Palestina, the marriage of his Mistress,
by whose death he raised himself from a very base and contemtible estate to
great honor and riches, his manner of cozening the sottish people of Arabia,
partly by a tame Pigeon that did fly to his ear for meat, and partly by a tame
Bull that he fed by hand every pay, with the rest of his actions both in peace
and war: I know as well as if I had lived in his time, or had been one of his
neighbors in Mecca, the truth whereof if thou did know as well, I am
persuaded thou would spit in the face of thy Alcaron, and trample it under
thy feet, and bury it under a Iaxe, a book of that strange and weak matter,
that I my self (as meanly as thou do see me attired now) have already
written two better books (God be thanked) and will hereafter this, (by Gods
gracious permission) write another better and truer, yea I would have thee know
(thou Mohammedan) that in that renouned Kingdom of England where I was borne,
learning does so flourish, that there are many thousand boys of sixteen
years of age* that are able to make a more learned book then thy Alcaron,
neither was it (as thou and the rest of you Mahometans do generally believe)
composed wholly by Mahomet, for he was of so dull a wit, as he was not able to
make it without the help of another, namely a certain Renegado Monk of
Constantinople, called Sergis. So that his Alcoran was like an arrow drawn out
of the quiver of another man. I perceive thou do wonder to see me so much
inflamed with anger, but I would have thee consider it is not without great
cause I am so moved, for what greter indignity can there be offered to a
Christian which is an Arthomusulman, the^ to be called Giaur by a Giaur: for
Christ (whose Religion I profess) is of that incomparable dignity, that as thy
Mahomet is not worthy to be named that year wherein my blessed Christ is, so
neither is his Alcoron worthy to be named that year wherein the This do all
Mahometans call our Gospel or the History of our Saniour, written by the four
Evangelists.
Iuieel of my Christ is. I have observed among the Mahometans such a foolish
form of prayer ever since my departure from Spahan, (which I confess was no
nouelty unto me, for that I had observed the like before both in Constantinople
and diverse other Turkish cities) that what with your vain repetions and diverse
other profane fooleries contained therein* I am certain your prayers do even
stink before God, and are of no more force then the cry of thy Camel when
thou do lade or unlade him: But the prayers of Christians have so prevailed
with God, that in time of drought they have obtained convenient abundance of
rain, and in time of pestilence a sudden cessation from the plague, such an
effect of holy and fervent prayer as never did the Words that the Mahometans
do often repeat in their prayers.
Scofferalahs, or the Allamissel allow of any Mohammedan produce: yet must we,
whose prayers like a sweet smelling sacrifice are acceptable to God, be
esteemed Giaurs by those whose prayers are odious unto his Divine Majesty: O
times! O manners! Now as I have told thee the difference betwixt the effect of
our Christian and your Mohammedan prayers, so I pray thee observe another
difference betwixt you and us, that I will presently intimate unto thee: thou
by the observation of the Law of thy rediculous Alcaron do hope for Paradise,
wherein thy Master Mahomet has promised Rivers of Rice, and to Virgins the
embracing of Angels under the shaddowe of spacious Trees, though in truth that
Paradise be nothing else then a filthy quagmire so full of stinking dung-hils
that a man cannot walk two spaces there but he shall stumble at a dunghill
and defile himself, but where this Paradise is, not one amongst a thousand of
you knows, therefore I will tell thee, it stands in a Country situate
betwixt Heaven and Earth called Vtopia, whereof there is mention in the third
book of thy Alcaron and in the seven and thirty Asaria, but expressed with
those mystical and obscure terms that is very difficult to understand it, for
this Vtopian Paradise I say as the reward of al your superstitious mumbling in
your prayers, and the often ducking down of your heads when you kiss the
ground, with such a devout humility forsooth, do you Mahometans hope in
another world: But we Christians hope to live with God and his blessed Angels
for ever and ever in Heaven, as being a proper and pecullar inheritance
purchased unto us by the precious blood of our Christ, yet must we be reputed
Giaurs by those that are Giaurs? One thing more will tell thee (O thou
Mohammedan) and so I will conclude this tedious speech, whereunto thy
discurtious calling of me Giaur has enforced me, and I prithee observe this
my conclusion.

Learning (which is the most precious Jewel that man has in this life, by
which he attaineth to the knowledge of divine and humane things) comes to man
either by revelation which we otherwise call inspiration, or by industry:
Learning by revelation I call that which God does infuse from above by his
special grace, unto those who^ he will use as the instruments of his glory, who
without labor or travel do aspire to a most eminent degree of knowledge.
Learning by industry I call it that which a man does purchase to himself by
continual writing and reading, by practice and meditation: now by neither of
these means have the Mahometans acquired any mean, much less any singular
learning, for as Mahomet himself was a man of a very superficial and mean
learning, so never was there any one of his Disciples in any part of the world
that was endued with any profound knowledge* but we Christians by the one and
the other mean, have attained to the most exquisite science that can be
incident to man: I mean the blessed Apostles of our Savior.
some of our men that never were brought up in Studies having been so expert in
a general learning (only by Gods special illumination) as those have spent
forty years in the practice thereof, and others by continual practice of
writing and reading, have been so excellent, that they became the very Lamps
and Stars of the Countries wherein they lived. These things being so, it cannot
possible come to pass that the omnipotent God should deal so partially with
mankind as to reveal his will to a people altogether misled in ignorance and
blindness as you Mahometans are, and conceal it from us Christians that bestow
all our life time in the practice of divine and humane disciplines, and in the
ardent invocation of Gods holy name with all sincerity and purity of heart? Go
to then thou Pseu-domusulman, that is, thou false-beleeuer, since by thy
injurious imputation laid upon me, in that thou calledst me Giaur, thou have
provoked me to speak thus. I pray thee let this mine answer be a warning for
thee not to scandalize me in the like manner any more, for the Christian
Religion which I profess, is so dear and tender unto me that neither thou
nor any other Mohammedan shall scotfree call me Giaur, but that I will quit you
with an answer muchto the wonder of those Mahometans*

I pray you Mother expect no more letters from me after this till my arrival
in Christendom, because I have resolved to write no more while I am in the
Mahometans Countries, thinking that it will be a far greater comfort both to
you and to all my friends whatsoever, to hear news that I have accomplished
my trauelles in Mahometisme, then that I am coming up and down, to and fro in
the same, without any certainty of an issue thereof; therefore I pray have
patience for a time: about two years and a half hence I hope to finish these
Mohammedan trauelles, and then either from the City of Raguzi in Sclauonia
which is a Christian City and the first we enter into Christendom, from those
parts of Turkey by Land nere unto the same or, from famous Venice, I will very
dutifully remember you again with lines full of filial piety and officious
respect. I have written two letters to my Uncle Williams since I came forth of
England and no more, whereof one from the Mogols Court the last year, just at
the same time that I wrote unto you; and another now, which I sent ^ointly by
the same Messenger that carried yours out of India by Sea. Once more I
recommend you and all our hearty wel-willers and friends to the gracious
tuition of the Lord of Hosts; I pray you remember my duty to Master Hancoke
that reverend and Apostolical good old man, and his wife, if they are yet
living; to their Sons Thomas and John, and their Wives.

FINIS.
Master Thomas Coriat.
SOme may perhaps suppose this Prose is mine,
But all that know thee will be sworn it is thine:
For (as 'twas said b'a learned Cambridge Scholar)
(Who knows the style, may smell it by the Collar):
The Prose (I swear) is Coriats, he did make it,
And who dares claim it from him, let him take it.
THE AVTHOR OF the Verse, takes leave of the Author of the Prose, desiring
rather to see him, then to hear from him.
THose Rimes before thy meaning does unclose,
Which men perhaps have blundred ore in Prose:
And it is a doubt to me, whose pains is more,
Thou that did write, or they that read them over:
My Scullers muse without or Art or skill,
In humble service (with a Gooses quill)
Has taken this needles, fruitles pains for thee,
Not knowing when thou wilt do as much for me.
But this is not the first, nor shall not be
The last (I hope) that I shall write for thee.
For when news thou wast drowned did hither come,
I wrote a mournful Epicedium.
And after when I heard it was a lie,
I wrote of thy suruiuing presently.
Laugh and be fat, the Scullers book, and this
Shows how my mind to thee addicted is;
My Love to thee has ever more been such,
That in thy praise I nere can write too much:
And much I long to see thee here again,
That I may welcome thee in such a strain
That shall even crack my pulsiue pi^mater,
In warbling thy renown by land and water:
Then shall the Fame which thou have won on foot
(Among Hethens, Jews, Turks, Negroes (black as soot)
Ride on my best Invention like an Ass,
To the amazement of each Owliglasse.
In praise of the Author,
Till when fare well (if thou can get good fare)
Content's a feast, although the feast be bare.
Let Eolus and Neptune be combinde,
With Sea auspicious, and officious wind;
In thy return with speed to blow thee back,
That we may laugh, lie down, and mourn in Sack.
J. T.
