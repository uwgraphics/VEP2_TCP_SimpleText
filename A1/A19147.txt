A JUST DEFENSE OF THE SLANDERED PRIESTS:

Wherein the reasons of their bearing off to receive Master Blackwell to
their Superior before the arrival of his Holiness Breue, are laid down, and
the imputation of disobedience, ambition, contention, scandal, etc. is by able
arguments and authorities removed, the objection of the adverse part
sufficiently answered, and the Popes sentence in the controversy truly related.

By John Colleton.

THe author of the Apollogy alleges the place following to show the
difference between his Libell and the books he impugneth. And we of purpose
make choice of the same, leaving the reader to judge whether he, or we, more
directly and in better temper insist in the state of the controversy, and
answer the objections.

SApitisne inter verum falsumue discernere? inter inflatum and solidum? inter
turbidum and tranquillum? inter tumidum and sanum? inter probationes and
criminationes? inter documenta and figmenta? inter causae actionem, and causae
auersionem? Si sapitis, been and recte; si autem non sapitis, nos vestri curam
gessisse* non poenitebit, quia et si cor vestrum ad pacem non conuertitur, pax
nostra tumen ad nos re^ertitur.

Augustinus contra Petil. cap. 79.
DO you know to distinguish between true and false? between solid and puffed
up? between turbulent, and quiet? between swelling and sound? between
probations and criminations? between instructions, and fictions? between
handling the cause, and running from the cause? If you know this, well and
good; if you know it not, we are not sorry, that we have had this care to
instruct you, for albeit your heart be not turned to peace, yet our peace
returns to us.

M. VESTRIVS BARBIANVS.

To the Reverend Priests, and Catholic Layty of our Country.
MAny can witness (dearly beloved in our Savior) how willing I was to
surcease, and did in deed break off, when I had composed the one half of the
treatise ensuing, holding then, the proceeding therein a labor and charge
needless, because four of our brethren were going to Rome for his Holiness
decision, and end in the controversy. But in this suspense of mind, and
intermission of the work, our Archpriest on the 26. of January last,
promulgated the Popes Breue of the 17. of August next before, after he had kept
the same three months or longer in his hands, as it is said. In which Breue,
both we were demanded what cause we had, why we did not obey the Cardinal
Protectors letters erecting the subordination, and judgment therein given:
That doubtless, we ought to have obeyed, and admitted the authority. Which
demand and judgment, beside many other places in the Breue, were evident
arguments unto us, that the same was granted upon wrong information, and Ca.
si 15. de fill praesb. li. 6. and ca. si motu proprio de praebend. li. 6.
consequently of no sufficient force to bind. For had his Holiness or the
Cardinal Prefect of the Breues, bin truly informed of the case, neither his
Holiness, nor the Cardinal would without peradventure ever have made such a
demand, or given like sentence against us. And as little would either of their
sacred persons, have omitted to comprehend the Jesuits under the censure of
the Breue, or let to reprove their fault, had they known that the Jesuits
were the prime authors, the only stiff maintainers, and reuiuers of the crime
against us. Moreover, at the very time of the promulgation of the Breue, there
came forth first the Apollogie and then the Appendixe with license of our
Archpriest, as written by the united Priests in due subordination unto him:
books that most sharply inueigh against us, for not receiving the authority at
first, upon sight of the Constitutiue letter. For which causes, and for that
sundry persons of good place, have of late affirmed, that Fa. Lister could and
would defend his position of our schism against any scholar in the world, and
also because certain* favorites of the Jesuits hold opinion, that the Breue
does not clear us from schism, but leaves it doubtful and undecided; and
finally, for that some of their most devoted, are so full spirited, as they
stick not to report, that the cause why the Pope declared in the manner he has
done for us, was not for that our cause was just, but upon a prudent
consideration of not giving coffeehouse to the king of France and our
State: I say for these causes and some other like, and to give satisfaction to
all parts, who upon any of the former grounds or colors have conceived amiss
of it, I thought it my bounden duty (especially my brethren most earnestly
importuning me) to resume and finish the poor labors which I had begun and
laid aside.

When the Cardinal Protectors letters were showed unto us for institution of
the authority, we took our selves unbound, before God and man, to subject our
selves thereunto, his Grace not sending with the Letter Constitutiue any
rescript of his Holiness, or other Canonical testimony for proof of such
his jurisdiction in our country: and we rested the more confident, and secure
in this opinion, both in respect it appeared most manifest unto us, that the
authority was procured by false suggestion, and by a man much disliked of our
Prince and state, and who sought to rule and command our Clergy: and also for
that it was propounded unto us by M. Blackwell with apparent falsities, and
with orders directly tending to tyranny, namely that we should not discuss
the Protectors authority, nor the institution of our Superiors, nor make any
secret meetings for aduising one the other, when as the condition of our state
embarreth us to meet publicly, nor write letters to any beyond the seas,
without his priuitie. For these reasons, and for that the authority it self
was most strange, never heard of in the Christian world, merely penal,
without mixture of any benefit to our selves, Church or country, of most
absolute sovereignty, without tie in the proceedings to any form of law,
other then the arbitrarie pleasure of the Archpriest: and the receiving of the
said authority, (the same being a superior prelature) expressly, and under
heavy penalties forbidden Ext^^u. Iaiuncl. c. Bulla 2. Iulij 2. and Iulij 3.
constit. 34.
by the constitutions of holy Church, except the party preferred thereunto,
do show the Letters of the Sea Apostolic (such as the Cardinals were not) for
proof of his promotion.

Notwithstanding all these exceptions and iustifications of our bearing off to
admit the subordination: we nevertheless offered to obey Master Blackwell in
the mean, though not to receive him to our Superior, till such time as the
Pope should make forth his Breue, or otherwise confirm him in his place, and
likewise protested under our hands, that no sooner should any such Breue or
confirmation appear, but that it should find us ready most absolutely to
receive the authority. But this was not deemed sufficient, nor ought could
satisfy, but our present submission. Which because we deferred to make, and
did not yield to acknowledge him for our Superior upon testimony of the
Cardinals letter, father Lister diuulged his condemned Treatise against us; his
Superior father Garnet, and M. Blackwel approved the same. They taught, that
our company was to be shunned: that our faculties In Fa. Listers treatise, and
in Fa. Garnets letter of the 7. of March.
were lost: that our selves were excommunicated: that none under mortal sin
could inuit us to say Mass: and those that did participate with us in
Sacraments, made themselves also partakers of our wickedness. Which inflaming
matter of dissension, and intolerable reuiling against us, lasted some
months: and when at last the Popes Breue arrived, we were content
notwithstanding the sharpness of the premises, to forgive all for peace sake,
and received the Subordination in as large manner as it was proposed.

Presently upon this atonement and remission of the former defamations, Father
Jones raised another paradox, far more strange and absurd then that of Father
Listers, and our Archpriest soothed it to be true, vidz. that whosoever did
stiffely maintain, that we had not incurred the crime of schism by the
prorogation of our refusal to receive M. Blackwell for our lawful Superior,
he himself ipso facto for such his maintenance incurred the censures of holy
Church. At this time also M Blackwell published a resolution, which (he said)
he received from our mother city, declaring the refusers of the appointed
authority were schismatikes, and commanded that none should absolve us in
confession, unless we did first acknowledge so much, In his Letter to Master
Clearke.
and likewise menaced, that if we did persevere in the contrary opinion, he
would deal with us as a Prelate for appeasing the same. Upon which order, and
threate of our Archpriest, and as well for satisfaction of our ghostly
children, as to make a final end of the controversy, we offered to dispute
the question with the Jesuits, the authors of the Calumniation: but being
denied this just request by our Archpriest, we sent (compelled thereunto) to
the University of Paris, with humble petition to that venerable company of
the Sorbons, that they would vouchsafe to deliver their opinion and censure in
the case. Who freeing us from schism and all sin in the nature of the act,
our Archpriest made forth eftsoons a decree, prohibiting 29. of May 1600.
under grievous penalties either directly or indirectly, the said censure of
the famous University. And within short time after, his 18. of October. 1^00.
Reverence published another decree, wherein he by virtue of his authority
iudicially declared us to have been truly disobedient to the Sea Apostolic,
and rebellious against his office, for not admitting the subordination at
first, and forbad us under present loss of all our faculties, and of being
ipso facto suspended and interdicted, neither to presume our selves, nor any
other for us, to defend our former disobedience any manner of way by word or
writing. Yea his Reverence enacted further in the same decree, that we (as. 5.
if we had bin boys in some Colleges under the Jesuits, and that it behooves
also, that some jealousy were cast abroad of our demeanure) should not have
any secret meetings, or communication together, save such only as tended to the
increase of piety and hospitality, or of humanity and peace. A law of that
quality, notwithstanding the smooth pretext, as the christian world never
heard the like to be made for Priests and Pastors, sent by the sea Apostolic
for reducing others to the Catholic faith. By which, and some other of our
Archpriest his decrees following in the discourse, the reader may judge, both
what an unworthy and servile bondage he and the Jesuits, (whose counsel, or
direction) he exactly follows in all things) have, and would more, of all
likelihood have brought upon us ere this day, if we had not appealed and wrote
to his Holiness, and also whether there remained any other refuge unto us then
to appeal and try the accusations before that Tribunal, unto whose judgment
both they and we must stand.

Further, we have several times sued for peace at the hands of our
adversaries, even upon uneven conditions: namely, before the first Breue,
before and after our appellation, and before our brethrens preparation to Rome:
but they of the other side evermore rejected all our offers, nor would accept
of any conditions, wherein our utter discredit, and their victory (though in
vnrights) should not appear to the world. The holy Ghost writes, and the
words are true as well Eccle. 41.
touching the spiritual as carnal parent: the children complain of their
wicked father, because they live in reproach for him. And S. Thomas 22. q. 73.
art 4. ad. 1. and quodl. 10. q. 6. art 13.
with all other school Divines teaches, that a man is bound to defend his
good name, when the wrongful deprauing thereof turns others to detriment.
Likewise the same Doctor 22. q. 72. art. 3. c.
writes, that one may be bound to purge his good name, even in respect of
doing good thereby to the defamer, viz. when through the checking and
repressing of his boldness, the party is learned to be more wary and temperate.
Which is also the command of holy writ, answer a fool according to his
foolishnes, least he seem wise Proverb. 26.
to himself.

We trust by the little which is said, that both the necessity, and justness
of our defense appears: and so much the more, by how much the wrong
testimony which our Archpriest lately gave on the ninth of May 1602.
concerning the Popes declaration in the matter of our imputative schism,
rebellion, and disobedience, was injurious unto us, in that his Holiness
clearing us of the three foresaid crimes, M. Blackwell in a public Letter
under his hand and name, denies the same, and makes his Holiness and the two
Cardinals, Burgesio and Arragone to speak much otherwise: yea his Reverence in
an other Letter bearing the same date, and addressed to the Priests of our
country, renews all his former decrees and prohibitions, continuing the
censures and penalties before annexed unto them. Whereby, if the like
oppressions, exceeding the bounds of his jurisdiction, and contrary to the law
of God, nature, and man, (as is proved in the Discourse) did or could bind,
alas what infinite turmoile and harrowing of consciences do follow, when so
many Priests of the Realm were suspended, and deprived of their faculties,
from the first time, In his decree of the 17. of Ianuar. 1599.
that they either diuulged any book set out since the year of our Lord 1597,
by which the fame of any clergy Catholic person of our nation may be hurt by
name; (of which quality the Treatise against the factious, the Apollogie, the
Appendix with some other, must needs be accounted by the self Letter and
tenor of Decree) or directly or indirectly maintained in word or In his decree
of the 29. of May. 1600. In his decree of the 18. of October. 1600.
writing, the censure of the University of Paris: or presumed in like manner to
defend their disobedience to the Sea Apostolic, and rebellion against the
office of the Archpriest, who did not at first subject themselves to the
Subordination, upon the arrival of the Cardinal protectors Letter
Constitutiue. Which several Decrees, each of them bereauing the offender ipso
facto from all his faculties, have (if they be of force, as our Archpriest now
again the 9. of May affirms they are) so entangled the Priests, as of
likelihood few, or not many, retain their faculties, and consequently, their
penitents bound (o the perplexity and horror) to iterate their confessions
made since that time unto them.

Father Parsons showed his nature, when plotting the authority, he made the
taking away of faculties the branch of the Archpriests jurisdiction, and our
Archpriest in my opinion, could not devise a more pregnant mean, how to
disquiet the spiritual repose of thousands (a thing which Prelates should most
of all shun, as being most oppositely contrary to the end of all
Ecclesiastical laws) then to annexe the loss of faculties to his Decrees in
the manner he has. Nor can I conceive the reason why his Reverence at this time
reualidateth and inforceth the penalties of his Decrees, since he has often
annexed unto them the censure of Interdict, a power which is not expressed in
his authority, and which if he do take, as he says he does, a iure communi,
in that he is constituted Archpriest, then were the six Assistants very
unadvised, and whosoever gave allowance thereunto, in writing to his Holiness
Nuncio in Flaunders, for his Grace to be a mean to Cardinal Fernesio our
Protector that the Archpriest In their Letter of the 2. of May 1601. A charity
well sorting with their most sclaunderous information.
might have authority from the Pope to excommunicate some four or six of the
master ringleaders of the faction. Because if he have authority a iure
communi by virtue of his Nauar in ma. ca. 27. nu. 159. and 168.
office, to suspend or interdict, he has also authority to excommunicate. But
these points are treated in the Discourse at large, where I hope the Reader
shall find enough to acquiet all scruples, that may this way arise. For taking
leave, we heartily request the Reader, and our fellow brethren chiefly, to
peruse our Reasons and proofs with indifferency, and as their understanding
shall then direct, so to speak for us in places where they hear truth and our
actions expugned.

quantum oporteat cum pati pro nomine meo. Imo Catholicos ipsos ac Sacerdotes

Smi D. N. summa prudentia, ac paternus amor remedium salutare per Dei gratiam
diebus praeteritis adhibuerit, cupiatque ad huius Collegij Romani exemplum,
quod summa pace, ac tranquillitate fruitur, reliquis quoque in partibus eandem
curari, and conseruari animorum concordiam, sine qua nihil bo^i exitus sperari
potest, speciali mandato nobis iniunxit, vt h^^c rei procurandae omni nos qua
possumus vigilantia impendamus, quod perlibenter quidem facimus, eo quod hoc
cardine potissimum totius causae momen* tum versari non ignoremus.

Cum igitur non parum interesse ad hoc ipsum nonnulli censeant, si subordinatio
aliqua inter Sacerdotes Anglicanos constituatur, and rations ab ipsis
Sacerdotibus pro ea re redditae a Smo D. N. probate fuerint, nos Stis suae
pijssimam prouidentissimamque voluntatem sequentes, hoc ipsum statuere
decreuimus. Atque pro ijs quidem Sacerdotibus Anglicanae nationis dirigendis ac

cui vices nostras pro tempore delegemus, inducti relatione, ac fama publica
virtutis, ^ruditionis, prudentiae, ac laborum tuorum in ista vinea Anglicana
per multos annos excolenda. Facultates autem, quas ad hoc ipsum tibi
concedimus, hae sunt: Primum vt caeteris omnibus Seminariorum Sacerdotibus
saecularibus (vt iam dictum est) authoritate Archipresbyteri praesis, quoad
Sm^s, aut nos eius mandato aliud statuerimus. Deinde vt eosdem Sacerdotes
dirigere, admonere, reprehendere, vel etiam castigare possis, cum erit opus,
hocque vel facultatum sibi a quocunque, seu quandocunque concessarum
restrictione, aut etiam reuocatione, si id necessitas postulauerit. De ijsdem
praeterea Sacerdotibus disponere, and de vna residentia in aliam (cum mayor Dei
gloria animarumque lu^rum illud exigat) mouere, ac commutare: dubia quoque and
controuersias exorientes audire, and pro rerum aequitate ex aequo bonoque
determinare: schismata, diuisiones, ac contentiones amouere, vel etiam
comp^scere: earumque rerum causa quemcumque Sacerdotem ad te vocare, ac
conuenire: plures etiam vnum in locum conuocare, cum necesse fuerit, and cum
sine probabili periculo fieri posse in Domino videbitur: congregatis vero
praeesse, eisque proponere, vel quae istis obseruatu necessaria iudicaueris,
auditis assistentibus, de quibus mox dicemus, vel quae huc, aut ad Doctore^
Barrettum Collegij Duaceni praesidem (cui his etiam in rebus specialis a nobis
Sm^ iussu tributa est potestas vt vobis assistat) scribenda duxeris. Quod si
quis his in rebus (quod futurum sane de virtute omnium confisi non timemus)
inobedientem se, aut inquietum, aut contumacem) ostenderit, hunc, post debitas
admonitiones ac reprehensiones fraterna charitate praemissas, liceat etiam
poenis coercere Ecclesiasticis, ablatione nimirum facultatum, vel suspensione,
quoad se em^ndauerit: vel si hinc etiam emendatio non sequatur, tunc vel ad D.
Barrettum vel ad nos scribatur, vt vel inde euocetur, qui eiusmodi est, vel
grauioribus etiam censuris istic humilietur. Vt vero facilius, suauiusque hanc
sollicitudinis partem tibi commendatam exequi possis, sex quoque consultores,
seu coadiutores assignamus, qui oneris participatione nonnihil te labor leuare
possint. Ioannem nimirum Bauandum, and Henricum Henshaum Theologiae Doctores,
Nicholaum Tiruettum, Henricum Shauum, Georgium Birkettum and Iacobum Standisium

praeter hos istic eligendi, ijsdem habitis antiquitatis, grauitatis ac laborum

atque concor(...), non parum etiam authoritatis atque existimationis, quam in
prouincijs habent, in quibus vices tuas nostrasque gerunt. Omnes vero 12. tam a
te qua^ a nobis nominatos tibi subordinatos esse oportebit, vt melius
conscruetur vnionis ratio, ad quam omnia diriguntur tuendam. Cum vero eos
delegeris ad hoc munus quos maxim idoneos in Domino iudicaueris, admonendos
nos curabis de eorum nominibus, ac qualitatibus. Ipsi etiam quoad fieri sine
periculo possit, suis literis saltem hoc initio significent, quo a^^mo sint ad
hoc praestandum, quod ab ijs pro conseruanda union postulatur. Deinceps vero
tum ijs, tum tibi iniungimus, vt sexto quoquo mense si fieri possit communibus
vel priuatis literis ad nos datis de statu rerum apud vos scribatis, vt ex ijs
Smo D. N. referamus quae scituerunt digna, vel quae causae vestrae interesse
iudicabuntur, vt a sua Ste cognoscantur. Si quis vero ex his duodecim, quos
tibi in consilium rei melius paragendae assignauimus absens fuerit, aut captus,
carcereque detentus, aut extra Angliam egressus, aut infirmitate, morbo, aliove
iusto impedimento retardatus, quo minus officium suum implere possit, aut recte
in eo non se gesserit, facultatem tibi facimus, alium eius loco substituendi,
ita vt nos deinde ea de re literis tuis admoneas. Si vero Archipresbyter ipse
moriatur, vel ex Anglia egrediatur, vel in hostium manus incidat, sic vt
officio suo commode fungi nequeat, tum antiquissimus ex consultoribus qui
Londini per id tempus, vel proximo Londino resederit, vices Archipresbyteri
sustineat quoad nos admoniti alium assignemus.

Illud denique vel imprimis scire debetis, quod iam supra attigimus, praecipuam
Smo D. N. meamque his in rebus intentionem eo ferri, vt disciplina
Ecclesiastica quantum per temporum, hominumque rations istic fieri possit,
conseruetur: and prae caeteris pax vnioque animorum atque concordia inter
fratres, ac Sacerdotes, nominatim etiam cum patribus societatis ^esu, qui vna
nobiscum laborarunt in eadem vinea, quod sua Ste dignata est quibusdam
Sacerdotibus hinc in Angliam discedentibus, nuper ore proprio me praesente
serio, ac instanter praecipere, neque hoc sine iustissima causa. Nam patres
illi non solum hic, atque alibi strenue impigreque laborant pro causa Anglicana
sustinenda, fundandis Seminarijs, iuuentute instruenda, egenis fouendis,
alijsque medijs plurimis, verum etiam in Anglia quoque eadem charitatis opera
prosequuntur, hocque vsque ad sanguinis profusionem, vt euentis, factisque
demonstratum est. Cumque nullam ipsi habeant nec habere pretendant in
Sacerdotes saeculares iurisdictionis, aut potestatis partem, neque vllam illis
molestiam exhibere, manifesta sane hostis astutia, ^c diaboli fraus censenda
videtur, ad vniuersum opus Anglicanum ^^ertendum comparata, vt quisquam
Catholicus aemulationem in eos exerceat, vel excitet, cum contra potius omni
amore, ac reuerentia prosequendi sunt, quo ipsi maiore alacritate Sacerdotes,
ac reliquos (vt hactenus) officijs, beneficijs, ac paterna plane charitate
complectantur, and sic coniunctis animis operisque, opus hoc sanctissimum
promou^atur. Vnde si quis fuerit, qui hanc concordiam labefactare studeat, eum
iuxta Apostoli praeceptum, and Apostolicae sedis intentionem notare debebitis,
vt vel admonitione corrigatur, vel paena coerceatur. Reliqua si qua erunt ea
vel in instructiones his annexas conijcientur, vel postea perscribentur, cum ex
literis vestris intellexerimus quibus amplius rebus istic indigeatis.

Vt finem igitur imponam nescio quibus vos alloquar potius verbis quam illis,
quibus toties Apostolus suos alloquebatur simili in causa, and non dissimili
fortasse occasion, neque tempore. Idem sapite, pacem habetote. Et adhuc long
instantius. Si qua consolatio in Christo, si quod solatium charitatis, si qua
societas spiritus, si qua viscera miserationis, implete gaudium meum, idem
sapiatis, candem charitatem habentes, vnanimes, idipsum sapientes, nihil per
contentionem, nec per manem gloriam, sed in humilitate superiores sibi inuicem
arbitrantes, vt non quae sua sunt singuli considerantes, sed ea quae aliorum.
Hanc Apostoli regulam, atque exhortationem si sequamini, omnia vobis tuta

Romae. R.ae V.ae Vti Amantissimus frater Henricus Cardlis Caietanus Protector.

The English.
Henry of the title of S. Potentiana Cardinal Caietane, Chamberlain of the
holy Roman Church, Protector of the English Nation:
to George Blackwell English Priest, formal Batchelour of Divinity, laboring
in the English vineyard, wishes health.
IT is known, and almost by daily experience found true, the divine providence
so ordaining for the trial and exercise of the good, that where greater
exploits are done to the glory of God, there also are the more vehement
attempts of Satan and the common enemy, to withstand or hinder the same.
Neither certes for these latter years space, have we seen a more famous
example, then in the English cause, which as it has received of our Lord very
singular grace of piety, fortitude, patience and constancy, and most renowned
glory both of Confessors and of Martyrs also: so in like manner is it known to
have endured most sharp assaults from heretics, in such sort, as that has
place in it, which the holy Ghost uttered of the elected soul, God has given
her a strong conflict that she might overcome. And Christ our Lord of the
vessel of election, I will show him how much he must suffer for my name. Yea
Satan has not God pardon the informer.
feared to assail Catholics themselves, and some Seminary Priests, who
hitherto have showed themselves leaders, and chieftaines of the rest, to all
praise of noble virtue, that he might make them to bicker one with another, and
break down the wall of union, whereon all the hope of Christian piety
rests. Against which attempt of the enemy Great peace when two cannot speak
together without a third, nor the students of one chamber recreate with their
f^llowes of another chamber.
beginning also of late to manifest it self at Rome, whereas the high wisdom
and fatherly love of his Holiness, has through the grace of God applied these
days past wholesome remedy, and desires that after the example of this Roman
College (which enjoys great peace and quietness) the same concord of minds,
without which nothing of good success can be expected, should be so^gh^ for
and conserved in other parts also, has by special comma(...)ent given charge
unto us, that we should employ our selves for the procuring of this thing with
all the diligence we can, which very willingly we take upon us to do, because
we are not ignorant that hereupon the moment of the whole cause depends.

Forasmuch therefore as some men think it would not a little avail to this
very thing, if a subordination were constituted among the English Priests, and
the reasons yielded by the Priests themselves for We know not to this day who
were th^se Priests, or what were the reasons they yielded.
the same matter were approved by our holy Father: we following the most godly
and most prudent will of his Holiness, have decreed to ordain the same, and
for directing and governing these Priests of the English Nation that now
converse in the kingdoms of England or Scotland, or shall hereafter reside
there, while this our ordination shall continue, we choose you, to whom for the
time we commit our steed and office, induced upon relation and the public fame
of your virtue, learning, wisdom, and labors taken for many years in the
trimming of this vineyard. And the faculties which to this purpose we grant
unto you, are these.

First that you have the title and authority of an Archpriest over all the
seminary secular Priests as is now said, until his Holiness or we by is
commandment, shall institute another kind of government: then, that you may
direct, admonish, reprehend or also chastise those Priests when need shall
require: and this either by restraining of faculties granted unto them, by
whom, or whenever; or by reuoking their faculties if necessity shall
constrain it. Besides, to dispose of the same Priests, and to remove and
change them from one residence to another, when Gods greater glory and gain
of souls does require the same. Also to hear their doubts and controversies
arising, and for the right of things to determine them according to reason and
equity. Likewise to remove or repress schisms, divisions, and contentions:
and for these causes to call and convent any Priest before you, yea to summon
many to repair together in one place, when it shall be necessary, and shall
seem in our Lord that it may be done without probable danger, and to be
chief over the assembled, and to propose unto them either the things you shall
judge necessary to be observed by them, the assistants being heard, of which
we will speak anon, or the things you shall think needful to be written hither,
or to doctor Barret President of the College of Doway, to whom by commandment
of his Holiness, we have given special authority to assist you. And if any one
in these matters shall show himself (which truly putting trust in the virtue
of all, we do not fear that it will fall out) disobedient, unquiet, or
stubborn, it is lawful, after due admonitions and reprehensions first used in
brotherly charity, to correct this party by Ecclesiastical penalties: that is
to say, either by taking away of faculties, or suspension, until he shall
amend himself; or if by this mean amendment follow not, then let notice be
sent either to Doctor Barret or to us, that he who is of such obstinacy either
be called from thence, or there humbled with more grievous censures.

And to the end you may the easier and with the more contentation execute this
charge of care commended unto you, we assign likewise six consultors or
coadiutors, who by participation of the burden, may somewhat lessen you
labor, namely John Bauen and Henry Henshaw, Doctors of Divinity, Nicholas
Tirwit, Henry Shaw, George Birket, and James Standish, who was lately with us
in Rome, which by the relation of many we understand to be of the more ancient
and best deserts. We also give you authority to choose six other beside
these, the same respects being had of auncientnesse, gravity, A good
direction, howsoever follovved.
and their travails, but chiefly of their prudence, moderation, and their love
of union and concord, not a little also of their authority and estimation,
which they have in the provinces where they supply your steed and ours. All
which twelve nominated as well by you as by us, shall be subordinate unto you,
that the means of union may the better be conserved, to the maintenance and
preservation whereof all things are directed. And when you have chosen those,
whom you shall deem in our Lord to be most fit for the office, you shall
advertise us of their names and qualities, and let themselves also so far as
it may be done without danger, signify by their letters how they stand
affected to perform this which for the conservation of unity is earnestly
desired of them. Afterward we enjoin both them and you, to write every sixth
month if it may be, common or private letters unto us, of the state of matters
with you, that of these we may relate to his Holiness such as are meet to be
known, or the things that shall be deemed profitable to your cause, to the end
they may be known to his Holiness.

And if any of these twelve which we have appointed to give counsel unto you,
for better managing of the affair, shall be absent, or dead, or taken, or
imprisoned, or departed out of England, or let by infirmity, sickness, or
any other just impediment, whereby he cannot fulfill his office, or shall not
well demaine himself therein: we give you power to substitute another in his
place, so that afterward you advertise us thereof by your Letters. But if the
Archpriest him elfe dye, or leave England, or shall fall into the hands of his
enemies, so that he cannot conveniently exercise his function: then let the
auncientest of the consultors who at that time shall reside in London or
nearest to London, execute the office of the Archpriest, until we
understanding thereof, assign another.

Finally, you ought chiefly to know that which before we have touched; his
Holiness principal intention and mine in these affairs to tend to this end,
that Ecclesiastical discipline so much as due consideration of times and
persons will there suffer be maintained, and above the rest peace and union of
minds and concord between brethren and Priests, particularly also with the
Fathers of the society of Jesus, that have labored together with you in one
vineyard.

The which thing his Holiness vouchsafed of late with his own mouth in my
presence earnestly and instantly to give in commandment to certain Priests
departing from hence into England, neither without just cause. For these
Fathers not only here and otherwhere, do with courage and diligently travel
for supporting the English cause, by erecting Seminaries, by instructing youth,
by cherishing the needy, and by very many other means, but also in England
too, they prosecute the same deeds of charity, and this even to the sheding of
blood, as the event and deeds have demonstrated. And whereas they Would this
were true.
have no kind of jurisdiction or authority, nor pretend to have, over the
secular Priests, neither any way to disquiet them; certes it seems to be a
manifest subtilty of the enemy and deceit of the devil, complotted for the
overthrow of the whole English cause, that any Catholic should practice or
stir up emulation against them, when contrariwise all affection and reverence
is rather to be showed toward them, whereby they may with the greater
alacrity embrace the residue of the Priests (as hitherto) with good offices,
benefits, and altogether with fatherly charity, and so with united minds and
labors, this most holy work be set forward.

Wherefore if there shall be any who goes about to weaken this concord, your
duty shall be to note him according to the precept of the Apostle and intention
of the Sea Apostolic, that either he may be reformed by admonition, or by
discipline corrected. The residue if there shall be any remaining, shall either
be specified in the instructions adjoining to these, or written hereafter when
we shall understand by your letters what further things you there want.

Wherefore to conclude, I do not know with what words better to speak unto
you, then with those which the Apostle so often used to his in the like cause,
and perchance not in unlike occasion nor time. Be of one mind, have peace. And
yet more instantly. If there be any consolation in Christ, if any solace of
charity, if any society of spirit, if any bowels of commiseration fulfill my
joy, that you be of one meaning, having the same charity, of one mind, agreeing
in one; nothing by contention, neither by vainglory, but in humility, each
counting other better then themselves. That every one not considering the
things that are their own, but those that be other men's.

If you follow this rule and exhortation of the Apostle, all things shall be
safe unto you, and glorious as hitherto. If ye suffer your selves to be thrown
down by the wiles of the enemy from this stability of concord; yours and your
own countries cause will dash upon great rocks, which God auert, and evermore
defend you: and I very heartily commend me to your prayers most loving fathers
and brethren, and Christ his most reverend Confessors.

admodum Rdo ac dilecto in Christo Georgio Blackwello Angliae Archipresbytero
salutem in autore salutis.
ADmodum Rde ac in Christo dilecte vti frater. Vehementer sane delectati sumus
ijs literis, quas satis frequentes ad me his diebus tum charitas tua, tum
consultores etiam tui Presbyteri assistentes, alijque viri graves non pauci
dederunt de iusta laetitiae, communique approbatione subordinationis illius
quam Smus Dominus iustissimis, pijssimisque de causis per nos in Clero isto
Anglicano instituendam curauit; hoc enim and a virtutis vestrae singulari
opinione, and vitae quoque professione excellentis expectandum omnino erat, vt
qui ad restituendam Christi Vicario, sedique Apostolicae obedientiam debitam
tot pericula, ac labores obitis, ipsi obedire eiusdem Sta sedis ordinationibus
non recusetis, sed alacri potius animo (quod fecistis) summi pastoris vestri
statuta ad vtilitate^, pacem, and corroborationem vestram edita, obuijs (vt
aiunt) vlnis amplecteremini. Itaque ex hac vestra, bonorumque omnium
presbyterorum adeo prompta hilarique obedientia quam literis contestati sunt,
cum Smus Dominus, tum ipse etiam pro officij mei ratione, ac eo praeterea quem
in vos sentio singularem amorem, gaudium profecto atque aedificationem non
mediocrem accepimus, quam optassem quidem perpetuam, vel certe diuturnam. Sed
posterioribus quidem nuncijs turbari aliquantulum cepit, cum esset perlatum
quosdam (vti fieri solet) refragari cepisse ac contentiones ciere,
conuenticulae quoque agitare, vt superiorum mandata in questionem vocentur.
Tandem denique ad Stem suam per ministros in partibus borealibus (vti videtur)
existentes, significatum est duos ex Anglia presbyteros a tumultuantibus his
emissos iam esse qui huic subordinationi Ecclesiae Anglicanae Stu suae iussu
institutae contradicant. De qua re factus certior Smus permolesto animo (prout
aequum est) accepit, voluitque before de perturbatoribus informari. Cumque
charitas tua nihil adhuc certi hac de re, neque de hominum istorum moribus vel
actionibus ad nos scripserit (quod tuae sane modestiae ac pietati tribuitur ne
facile ad fratrum descendas accusationem) nunc tamen Smo id postulante, vt
informatio debita de omnibus habeatur, faciendum tibi erit omnino, vt rerum
veritas per te patefiat acceptis and ad nos transmissis (quo ad commode ac sine
periculo fieri poterit) bonorum tecum conspirantium sententijs, ac reluctantium
etiam separatim, not at is nominibus, causisque percensitis quas reluctationi
suae praetendunt. Quod vt facilius citiusque ex nostrae ordinationis
authoritate persicias, hoc tibi caeterisque presbyteris iniungimus, vt statim
ac diligenter fiat. Variaque harum literarum authographa ad te mittenda
iussimus, quo facilius multis ad rei peragendae breuitatem ostendi possint,
Dominum praecantes vt magna bonorum snorum abundantia vos complete, and pace
veraeque charitate, quae perfectionis omnis vinculum est, dignos efficiat.
Neque defatigemini animis, vt Apostolus hortatur, si difficultates ac
contradictiones nonnullas in hoc vestro regimine experiamini, id enim vel
optimis semper Ecclesiarum rectoribus ab initio contigit, and idem Apostolus
ipsius Christi Domini exemplum vobis proponit, Qui talem ( inquit) sustinuit a
peccatoribus aduersum semetipsum contradictionem. Sed omnia tandem ipse Dominus
pacabit, fluctusque, exurgentes compescet, vosque de laboribus vestris ac
patientiae cumulate remunerabitur. Ipse vos custodiat semper.

The English.
Henry Cardinal Caietane Chamberlain of the Church of Rome, Protector of
England, etc.
to the very reverend and beloved in Christ, George Blackwell Archpriest of
England, greeting in the author of health.
Very reverend and beloved in Christ as our brother: undoubtedly we took
singular great contentment in the frequent letters, which both your charity,
your consultors the assisting Priests, and many other grave men sent unto me of
late, concerning the just gladness and common approbation of the subordination
which his Holiness upon just and godly causes appointed to be instituted by us
in this English Clergy. This truly was always to be expected, as well from
the singular opinion of your virtue, as also from the profession of your
excellent life; that ye, who vnder-go so much danger, and take so great pains
in againe-restoring due obedience to the Vicar of Christ and Sea Apostolic,
your selves refuse not to obey the ordinances of the same holy Sea; but rather
with cheerful mind (as you have done) you would embrace with open arms (as
the Proverb is) the appointments of your highest Pastor, decreed for your
profit, peace, and to make you strong. And so upon this yours and all good
Priests, their alike ready and joyful obedience, and which they testified by
letters; both his Holiness and my self, as the duty of my office required,
and for the love beside which I feel to be singular toward you, took certes
no mean joy and edification, which I could have wished to have been perpetual
or of long continuance. But upon later intelligence it began to be somewhat
disturbed, when news came that some (as it is wont to happen) enterprised to
repugne and to raise up contentions, also to make conuenticles to the end to
call the commandments of superiors into question. Finally in process it was
signified to his Holiness by Ministers abiding as it seems in the North
parts, that two Priests were sent out of England by the tumultuous, which
contradict this subordination of the Church of England instituted by
commandment of his Holiness. Of which thing his Holiness being advertised,
he took it (as it was meet) very grievously, and would be more fully informed
of the perturbers. And since your charity has not as yet written any certainty
unto us of this matter, nor of the manners and actions of those men (which
doubtless is attributed to your modesty and piety, as one who is not easily
moved to accuse his brethren) yet now his Holiness commanding the same, that
due information be given of all, you must needs labor that the truth of things
be laid open by you in taking and trasporting unto us (so far forth as
conveniently and without danger it may be done) the judgment of those good
men that accord with you, and in noting the names of the contenders apart, and
in signifying the causes which they pretend of their reluctation. The which
thing that you may by the authority of our ordination perform with the more
ease and speed, this we enjoin you and the rest of the Priests, that it be
forthwith and diligently accomplished. And we have commanded that many copics
of these letters be sent unto you, to the end they may be showed to many for
quicker dispatch of the affair: beseeching our Lord to fill you with the great
abundance of his blessings, and make you worthy of peace and true charity,
which is the bond of all perfection. Neither be you weary, fainting in your
mind, as the Apostle exhorts, if you meet with some difficulties and
contradictions in this your Regiment, for that has always chanced even from
the beginning to the best governors of the Church: and the same Apostle
proposes unto you the example of Christ himself our Lord, Which (says he)
sustained of sinners such contradiction against himself. But our Lord will
appease all things at last, and allay the swelling God grant it.
sourges, and reward you abundantly for your travels and patience, who always
keep you.

Rome 10. of November, 1598. As your brother Henry Caerdinall Caietane
Protector.

The Reasons whereupon we delayed to admit the Archpriestes authority, until
the arrival of his Holiness Breue.
The first Reason.
FIrst it appeared manifest unto us, even by the very express words of the
Cardinals Letter, by which his Grace instituted the subordinatio^, that the
same was procured by wrong information, and consequently void, and of no force
to bind us to the acceptance thereof. We say void and of no force, because
several Canons do so forcibly undo and annullate whatsoever is procured by
wrong information as they make surreption, (that is, as are the words of the
law) Ca. super literis de rescrip.
when a truth is suppressed, or a falsehood suggested. So clear and infallible
a cause of f^ustrating all graunts as this manner of speech is often used in
them: Ca. si is de silijs presb. lib. 6.
Nullius penitus esse momenti veluti per surreptionem obtentum, and Ca. simot^
proprio de praebend. lib. 6.
veluti surreptitium nolumus vires obtinere, to be utterly of no moment as
obtained by surreption; and like as matter surreptious or gotten by wrong
information, we will not that it should retain any force. As though the
supreme Pastors would have said wrong information is of that certain undoing
and destroying qualititie, as in obtaining of what grace soever it be found to
have place, it presently marreth and makes the grant of no effect. And that
this is so indeed, and no wresting of the words of the law, let the best
Co^mentors bear witness for us. The Gloss, which next after the text of the
law, is of greatest authority, has these words: Clemen. de praebend. Ca. 1.
Literae gratiae vitiautur, and sunt ipso iure nullae si fierint obtentae per
surreptionem: Letters of grace (of which kind must needs be his Holiness
grant for the subordination) are void and of no force by the law it self, if
they be odtained by surreption. To which Panormitane the Prince of the
Canonists assenteth: Part. 2. consil. consil. 38. nu. 1.
Surreptio in literis gratiosis vitiat gratiam ipso facto, and quicquid vigore
talium literarum secutum est: Surreption annulleth ipso facto, the letters of
grace, and whatsoever followed by force of such letters. And Decius with
infinite other writes the like: ^^ Ca. post remo de Appel. nu. 39.
Impetratio surreptitia non tenet, licet esset sanctus illequi impetrauit. A
petition obtained (of the Sea Apostolic or other prelate) by surreption is of
no force, a^beit he were a Saint that obtained the grant.

Neither are the aforesaid Canons antequated but still in force, that in what
grant or letters of grace soever the realnesse of surreption is found, the
same loses his validity as Sa a divine, and Rebuffus a Canonist (both
writers of this age) do testify, Sa. verb. gr^
Gratiam Papae surreptio facit nullam: Surreption makes the grace which the
Pope gives of no force, Rebuff. in praxi tit. quae opponi possunt contra
Bullam.
Surreptio and obreptio possunt opponi contra Bullam, and si oppositio ista
vera sit, non potest euitari. Surreption and obreption may be opposed against
the Popes Bull: and if this opposition be true, there is no shift at all nor
means of avoiding, but the Bull of necessity loses his force. And if
surreption and obreption may be excepted against the Popes Bull, and do vitiate
the same: no doubt they work the like effect, and may be excepted against a
verbal grant of his Holiness, or a Cardinal Protectors Letter. It has been
showed before that surreption is, when a troth is concealed, or an untruth
suggested: and obreption, as In Ca. cu^ dilecta de rescrip. nu. 5.
Pope Innocentius defines is, quando per alicuius operam factum est quod
impetratae literae effugiunt plenam intelligentiam Papae vel alterius qui
necessitate iuris vocandus est: when by any ones labor (that is by cunning and
crafty circumuention as In Ca. cum dilecta de rescript. nu 7.
Panormitane interprets the word) it is compassed that the letters obtained
passed not with the Popes full knowledge, or wi^h like priuitie of another, who
was by order of law to be made acquainted therewith.

Or let the case be, that there were no direct authority to be brought for the
proof of this assertion, as the choice is manifold even out of the text of the
law Ca. super literis and C^. co^stitutus and Ca. adau. lientiam. 2. de
rescript. and Ca. dudum. 2 de electione and C^. 1. and 2. de fill. presb. lib.

Civil: yet it seems that the verity thereof might not amiss be proved in
this sort. Graunts extend not their force beyond the intention and meaning of
the graunter, his intention and meaning being the self form, and the only
true rule and limits of what he grants. If therefore his Holiness had no
further intention to grant or command the institution of the new authority,
but as the information was true (as of likelihood he had not) and if not, then
it follows the causes and information being untrue, that the grant was of no
effect in regard it had not his Holiness intention, will, or meaning, to give it
life, vigor or validity. And this we take to be one of the principal
grounds, why the received Gloss uses these words: In Ca. sua nobis de ossi.
vicar.
Literae per surreptionem obtentae non conferunt iurisdictionem. As if one
should say, what is obtained by means of wrong information, lacks the Popes
consent, because he grants it not, but upon credence that the information
was true, which being not true, he had no intention to grant it: and having no
intention to grant it, it follows that no jurisdiction was conferred, because
the axiom has Ca. fin. de prebend.
Actus agentium non operantur vltra intentionem and mentem eorum: Acts do not
work beyond the intention and meaning of the agents.

And if our adversaries will needs here contend, that the Popes Grant, and
the Cardinals Letter for the new subordination was matter of justice, and not
of grace and favor only, (as how they can say it, we do not know) and
therefore the authorities before going make nothing for us, or against them. We
answer, that admit the subordination be matter of mere justice, nevertheless
the reason immediately precedent does hold, and the stronger: because in
rescripts and grants of justice, this condition Si praeces veritate nitantur if
the causes alleged in the petition be true, is always to be understood, even
by the express direction and command of the Ca. ex part 1. de rescript.
law it self. And we add further, that the subordination being procured by
surreption, our bearing off to admit the same, could neither be unlawful, or
justly offensive to any one. For although letters or graunts of justice, are
not void ipso facto in that they were procured by surreption, yet may the
parties prejudiced by the grant, most lawfully forbear to obey the tenor,
alleging and proving the surreption as the words of the gloss do most
manifestly imply. In Clem. de praebend. ca. 1.
Literae iustitiae obtentae per surreptionem non sunt ipso iure nullae, vt
literae gratiae, sed veniunt annullandae per exceptionem: Letters of justice
gotten by surreption, are not void ipso facto, as are letters of grace, but
they are to be annullated by excepting against the surreption. Which difference
all the Rebuff. in prax. tit. differentiae inter rescripta gratiae and
iustitiae. Master Blackwell himself is witness hereof, who took exception
against the exception.
Canonists put between letters of grace and justice. So that we excepting
against the surreption* as we did at the first showing of the Cardinals
Protectors Letter, alleging that the means were not true, by which Fa.
Parsons had procured so fruitless and strange subordination, what fault
possibly could be in us, doing no more or otherwise herein, then what all laws
and practice thorough out the Christian world* do license, allow and approve.

Now the reasons why we did fully persuade our selves, that the causes alleged
and set down in the Constitutiue Letter were not true: and consequently that
the authority did not bind us, as obtained by untrue suggestion, were as well
several truths concealed, as falsities related, and to name some of either
sort.

One of the truths concealed, was our design at that time and readiest purpose
to make suit by Supplication to his Holiness for creating of Bishops in our
Church. To which we were not only carried by a longing desire we had to reduce
(as much as in us lay) the broken state of our Church to an uniformity of
Ecclesiastical Hierachie, and customarie regiment with all Christendom, but
also by a most sensible feeling of those manifest damages we daily sustain,
and which day by day more increase upon us, for lack of such sprituall
comforts as accompany that divine and sacred kind of government: to wit, the
ministering of the Sacrament of Confirmation, the consecrating of holy Oils,
with many more. The first whereof a comfort so many ways necessary for increase
of strength and true courage in these our no weak combats, as not any thing
(the infinite number of our lay Catholics considered, who never received the
benefit of this Sacrament) can lightly appear to be of greater or equal
necessity.

It is now more then 40. years past since we had a Catholic Bishop at
liberty in place to exercise his function: and for these latter twenty years
and somewhat more, our Country has not had a Catholic English Bishop either
in prison or out of prison: albeit, Ireland an Island subject to her Majesty,
and traveling in like diversity of Religions as England does, was never in
all this while destitute of one, two, or more, made successively by the favor
and appointment of the sea Apostolic. Undoubtedly if our brethren and the
Catholics of our Realm, would seriously ponder on the several graces, which
issue from this Sacrament as from their native fountain, and of other no
common benefits which attend upon that form of government, as the shadow
does upon the body: they would not only Dionisyus Eccl. Hierarchia. Ca. 2.

with one consent subscribe to this our aforesaid intended suit, but would also
most willingly join in one supplication with us to his Holiness, that it would
please him either to appoint Suffragans, or give Episcopal authority to some
such as should live and converse among us. For to what other thing can we more
impute the grievous defectio^ and fall of so many from the Church in the time
of their trial, then to the want of the Sacrament of Confirmation, in which,
the fullness, strength, and special protection of the holy Ghost, both firmly
to believe, and constantly to profess our faith, are given in such measure, as
the grace of Baptism, according to the doctrine of Divines, is thereby
perfected: and the like difference wrought in the soul of the receiver, as is
betwixt the state and strength of a man and a child? For as we do not receive
so great strength and quantity of body in our birth, as we do after by the
benefit of food and sustenance: so (the Sacrament of Baptism and Sacrament of
Confirmation working alike in spiritual matters, as do our birth and
nourishment in natural) the grace and spiritual fortitude we receive in
Baptism, registring us in the family of Christ, is not of that degree,
actiuitie, and operation, as is the grace which given us in the Sacrament of
Confirmation, enrolling us the professed soldiers of our heavenly Captain
Christ Jesus.

Certes how meanly soever the grace of this Sacrament is now thirsted after,
or the use thereof sued for: yet no less renowned a Saint and Clarke in Gods
Church then Pope Clement writes, that Omnibus Epist. 4. ad Iuliu^ and Iulia^^
festinandum est sine mora renasci Deo, and demum ab Episcopo consignari, id
est septi form^m gratiam Spiritus sancti percipere, nam alioqui perfectus
Christianus nequaquam esse possit is, qui iniuria and voluntate, non autem
necessitate compulsus, hoc Sacramentum praetermiserit, vt a B. Petro accopimus,
and caeteri Apostoli praecipiente Domino docuerunt. It behooves all men without
delay, to make haste to be borne anew to God, and after to be consigned of the
Bishop, that is, to receive the seuenfold grace of the holy Ghost: since
otherwise he cannot be a perfect Christian, who through injury to himself and
default of his own will, and not compelled by necessity, omitteth to receive
this Sacrament, as we have received of S. Peter, and the other Apostles, have
taught by our Lords commandment. Memorable also is that saying of Epist. 1.
ca. 7
Pope Vrbanus: Omnes fideles per manus impositionem Episcorum Spiritum sanctum
post Baptismum accipere debent, vt plene Christiani inueniantur: All faithful
people ought after Baptism to receive the holy Ghost by imposition of the
Bishops hands, that (in the day of resurrection) they may be found fully
Christians, (beautified with the ensign or character of the Sacrament of
Confirmation.) And memorable also is that saying of In Epist. ad Episco.
Hispan. cited de consec. distin. 5. ca. 2.
Pope Melchiades: In Baptismo regeneramur and vitam, post Baptismum confirmamur
ad pugnam: in Baptismo abluimur, post Baptismum roboramur: and quamuis continuo
transituris sufficient regenerationis beneficia, victuris tamen necessaria sunt
confirmationis auxilia. Regeneratio per se saluat mox in pace beati saeculi
recipiendos: confirmatio autem armat and i^struit ad agones mundi huius and
praelia reseruandos. In Baptism we are regenerated to life, after Baptism we
are confirmed to fight: in Baptism we are washed: after Baptism we are
strengthened. And albeit the benefits of Baptism be sufficient to those that
depart out of the world immediately, yet to such as live longer the helps of
Confirmation are necessary. Regeneration of it self saves those that
incontinent are to be received to the peace of the happy world: but
Confirmation armeth, furnishes, and instructs those that by longer life are
reserved to the conflict and warfare of this world. By the doctrine of which
three Popes and great Clerks, it appears that the Sacrament of Confirmation
is the complement and perfection of Baptism, Council. Trid Sess. 7. Ca. 1. Co^.

to confer the fullness of the holy Ghost, to attain a special perfection,
and derive the more abundant helps unto us, of confessing our faith when his
honor and the edification of our neigbours requires: and by it also to
receive a distinct and indelible character or badge of being assigned the
public soldiers of Christ in the noblest cause (his faith) upon earth.

Right excellent also to this purpose are the words of Sermon. 1. de dedicat.
Eccle.
Damianus: Decretales paginae and sanctorum patrum instituta decernunt, non
esse differendam post Baptismum sacramenti huius virtutem, ne nos inermes
inueniat fraudulentus ille contortor, a quo nemo vnquam nocendi inducias
extorsit. Delibuti igitur vtri^sque roris vnguento, illo sanati, confortati
esto* securius descendamus ad singular certamen. The decretall pages and the
institutes of holy fathers have decreed that after Baptism the virtue of this
Sacrament is not to be deferred least that guilefull racker of our souls
(Satan) find us unarmed, from whom no man ever has wrested the league of
truce that he should not hurt him. Being therefore anointed with the sweet
oil of both deawes (Baptism and Confirmation) in that healed, in this
strengthened, we may the more securely cope or descend to handy gripes with our
ghostly enemy.

To conclude, Hist. Eccle. lib. 6. ca. 35. ex Epi. Cornelij Pont. ad Fabiu^.
Eusebius attributes such exceeding force and working efficacy to this
Sacrament, as he doubted not to say, that Nouatus, who after became an
Ach-heretike, could not merit the grace and assistance of the holy Ghost, in
reason of his wretchlesnesse and lack of devotion, in that being baptized in a
dangerous fit of sickness, he was not likewise at that time signed and
fortified with the sacrament of confirmation. And thus much of the importance
of our intention and first truth, which as we verily thought was kept secret
from the understanding of his Holiness: wishing every one maturely to consider
of that little which is said, and what Divines do further add in this point,
for exciting all Christians, not only most heartily to affect, but most
studiously also to get timely ministered to themselves.

Another truth secreted, was the great contention and scandalous The second
truth secreted*
debate reigning between the Jesuits and some of the secular Priests, by
reason of an affected superiority, which the Jesuits after the decease of good
Cardinal Allen, labored to place in father Weston over his f^llow prisoners
in Wisbish, by much his elders, as in years, so in sufferance also for the
Catholic cause. And it was not thought that this manner of seeking to bear
rule, would take up so or consine it self in that castle. The humor was deemed
to be more active, and that it would soon enlarge in self to the Priests
abroad. Neither was this opinion conceived without cause, in respect of the
question that master Warpoole now a known Jesuit and Father Minister at
Valodelide, proposed to a student in Rome, demanding of him what he would say,
when no Priest should find harbor or welcome any where in England, unless he
came recommended by some of the Jesuits. And after the secret Jesuit (for so he
was at the time when he used th^se speeches) had continued a long discourse, in
showing the ample and manifold conueniences that would ensue upon so good an
order, he would needs without denial have the student at the end of his tale,
to declare also his conceit in the matter: and when by earnest importunity he
had won him thereunto, and the student had showed plainly his auersion from
liking any such practice or sovereignty over the Priests, the Jesuit
incontinent bewraied no little coffeehouse. Again, that which yet brought
more evidence to the matter, was a Treatise which a special favorite of the
Jesuits compyled, and which was given abroad to others to read, wherein it
was discoursed, that none were sit to have the guiding of souls: nay, special
heed to be taken that none such be chosen to be guides, who were not addicted
to Religion, or had not that way relation or dependence. Which injurious and
disgraceful assertion, being excepted against by one or more of the auncientest
Priests in our Realm, was notwithstanding so little reuersed or disliked, as
more stiffely then before maintained, both by the Author of the Treatise, and
by the chief of the society, with some other of the same company.

Now then, these and more like particulars, which if need require will be
easily produced, yielding sufficient conjecture, if not remonstrance, of the
hearty desire the Jesuits had, to have the secular Priests under their
direction: we thought meet, the sooner also for avoiding the bad and
ignominious reports, which were spread abroad every where of us for not
stouping to the foresaid subjection: as that we were forsooth men, who would
not live under discipline, or could away with obedience, being, as it were,
given over to follow the sway of our own fancies, and unwilling to have either
other rule, or Superior to direct us, then our own will, or what the love of
liberty should prescribe: we say, to avoid this fowlest obloquy, and to the
end the occasion of variance between them and us, might be taken away in the
root, we desired the ordinary government by Bishops.

Which intention and petition of ours, if it had been made known to his
Holiness, together with the ground moving us thereunto, and the causes of the
dissension (as they were not hid from the procurers of the authority) we most
certainly assured our selves, that either his Holiness would not have appointed
this kind of government, (to which the Jesuits are no way subordinate) or not
have placed it in such a like favorite of theirs, as themselves only had
purposely culled out to serve their turns. Or could we win our thoughts, that
his Holiness knowing how all things stood with us, would nevertheless have
erected this kind of superiority, and have appointed Master Blackwell for the
Superior: yet the whole world cannot make us to believe, or once to doubt that
his Holiness pious and prudent disposition, his high commended vigilancie, and
zeal of justice, would if his blessed Fatherhood had been truly and fully
informed of our case, have ever annexed such a tie and instruction to the
authority, as that our Archpriest should consult and take advice in all
matters of moment with the Provincial of the Jesuits: whereas father Garnet,
who then had, and now has the room, was And let our adversaries answer this.
the chief of the one side in the difference: so that herby, he is become borh
party and counselor: plaintiff and judge: assistant, defendant, and in
Commission for arbitrating his own case, and the causes of his fellow brethren
of the same society under his guiding. An exorbitant most contrary to the
laws of all Nations, and opposite to the nature of justice, even by the light
of nature.

But to leave to stay longer about the truths which we took to be The first
falsitie expressed.
concealed, as a matter wherein ignorance or forgetfulness may plead the
informers excuse, and to come to the falsities, wherein not ignorance or
forgetfulness can have place, as in the former, but mis-affection or fraud, or
a worse godfather must name the child. The sole cause alleged in the Cardinals
letter, and which (as there appears) was made the principal motive and
ground of the new institution, was, a debate or variance fained to be between
the Seminary Priests and the Catholic laytie of our nation. A fiction no
less slanderous, defaming both clergy and temporalty, then the same is open
to every man's check. For what Priest or lay Catholic in England can warrant
and verify the assertion with any one instance, or being acquainted with what
has passed in this kind, cannot, if he has will, witness the contrary?
Neither is there need we should produce more or clearer evidence, for disproofe
of the slander, then Master Blackwels own letter which he wrote to Cardinal
Caietane immediately By likelihood no holy haters of their own praises.
before the institution of the authority: and which for the sundry praises it
gave to the societies high labors, and charities here, is registered in our
English College at Rome, as a perpetual memory to all posterity. For the
writing whereof, together with a Sermon he made in setting forth their merits,
he was in many men's opinion, chosen to the office he possesses In this letter
he confidently affirms, that for this latter twenty years space and more, he
never heard of any dissension, Cuius afflatus paulo molestius aliquando
commouit: which was The self words of the Letter.
not blown over without the least trouble. Which testimony of Master Blakwels
to the Cardinal, cannot in his own conscience be understood of the Jesuits
and Seminary Priests, but only of the good agreement between the secular
Priests and the laity. This we say, because for the space of the latter two
years immediately before he wrote the said letter, not only the whole realm
was grievously scandalized, but the Pulpets rung also every where with the
great contentions, which were between the Jesuits and the Priests at Wisbic^h
And these scandalous stirs were so little unknown to Master Blakwell, as
himself indicted a general letter unto them, persuading to mutual peace and
concord. Yea further at the very same time when he addressed his letter to the
Cardinal, he could not be but weeting to the reuiuall of the old, and increase
of the new dissentions at the same place, and among the said persons, and which
also were of no small moment, and of much disedification. By all which it is
most evident, that if Master Blackwels words were true, auowing that there was
no dissension in our country, Cuius afflatus paulo molestius aliquando
commouit: they were only true in the secular Priests and the laytie, and not
between the Jesuits and the Priests; and consequently the dissension which
was suggested to be between the Seminary Priests and the laytie, and for
appeasing whereof the new authority was ordained, was a mere device and an
apparent falsitie, the dissension being wholly (which was concealed from his
Holiness) betwixt the Jesuits and the Seminary Priests. And to the redress
whereof, this authority no whit auailed, the Jesuits who were the brewers and
principal cause of all the broils) being altogether out of the compass of
the Archpriests authority and jurisdiction, unless it be to direct him in the
execution of the same.

The second falsehood uttered, was, that Master Standish (whom The second
falsitie expressed.
the Jesuits employed in negociating this business with his Holiness, as is
confessed in the Apology, and who had at that time given his name to be one of
their order) told his Holiness (but by what kind of equivocation or strange
subintellection we know not) that he had the consents of the Priests in
England, and came in their names to entreat the appointing of a superior:
whereas in truth he never acquainted the body of our Clergy with his going,
and less with the business he went about. Nay he was so cunning in cloaking
his intention, that even to those Priests (who were not also above two or
three) from whom he could not conceal his journey, he pretended the cause of
his voyage, to be a long desire he had to visit the holy places, and perhaps
to enter into religion, forgetting therein the advice of S. Paul, Non
ambulantes in astutia, not walking in craftiness, intending one 2. Cor. 4.
thing, and making semblance of another.

To conclude our first reason, the information being faulty, as well for truths
concealed, as for untruths delivered, yea the very groundsell of the authority
(we mean the chief and maine reason, and which is preferred to the first
place in the Constitutiue Letter, and given as the sole and principal cause of
instituting the subordinatio^) being not only untrue, but co^taining beside a
very grievous touch both to the secular clergy, and confessant Catholics of
our country, as that the devil had made an assault to set us together in
tumults, when not the least breach or variance was known, or ever extant
between us: we assured our selves, the case thus standing, that we might most
lawfully, and in wisdom defer our obedience to the new authority, till we
had disclosed the drift to his Holiness, laid open the fraudulent and bad
dealing, practiced by the complottors and procurers of the subordination, and
the likelihood of the broiles to ensue between the Jesuits and the Priests,
whilst the Jesuits having thus cunningly gotten the choosing of both our
Archpriest and Assistants, and consequently derived power to themselves, to
make and multiply what ordinances they pleased in our Church, for curbing and
afflicting any one that should withstand. Res ipsa loquitur. No more words
need, the effects themselves do witness.

The second Reason.
THE second reason of our bearing off was, for that admitting the information
to be true, which the procurers of the authority gave up to his Holiness (as
how little sincere it was the reason precedent sufficiently shows) we stood
nevertheless morally assured that our delay could not be offensive, being
intended for no longer while, then till sending to his Holiness (which was
done with greatest speed) and unfolding to him the true state of all matters,
we might receive direct knowledge what was done: namely whether the
subordination was proposed only and upon our liking, to be confirmed (which
appeared most probable) or whether it was so peremptorily decreed (which we
could not believe) as whatsoever our exceptions might be against it, it must
notwithstanding be in force and continuance. And here, to make our discourse
the more perspicuous, and to lay certain grounds for supporting the same, we
put down the propositions following.

The first proposition.
NO delegatine authority, by whom, or of what matter soever can any way be
rightfully extended beyond the limits of the commission and case expressed.
The proves. In ca. Sol^t de sent. excommu. verb. per superiore^ lib. 6.
Delegata potestas est stricti iuris, and idsolum potest quod ei specialiter
est commissum, and sine quo causa expediri non potest. Delegatine authority (as
writes the Gloss) appertains to a strict law, and can only be extended to
that which is expressly committed, and without which, the cause cannot be
effected: or not commodiously effected as In ca. De testibus Col. 3. de test.
Aretinus, In ca. vt debitus honor de appella nu. 73.
Decius and Consil. li. 1. tit. 31. de offi. Iudi. ord. nu. 4.
Navarre do enlarge the Gloss. Again potest^s delegata non est extendenda ad
causam non expressum. Delegatine power (as writes In ca fin. de ver. sig. nu.
5.
Panormataine) is not to be stretched to a case not expressed in the
commission. Again, Lib. 3. tit. ^. sed sine.
Sieve vni, sieve pluribus, sieve a principe, sieve ab alio mandata fuerit
iurisdictio, mandati forma diligenter custodienda erit, nec aliquid contra quam
sibi mandatum fuerit, delegatus sibi tentare audebit. The words of Lancelot
whether jurisdiction shall be given to one or to many, by a Prince or by an
inferior, the form of the Mandate must be diligently observed, neither shall
the delegate adventure to attempt any thing beside that which shall be given
him in commission. To this purpose likewise writes In ca. eam te de rescript.
nu. 6.
Innocentius, and Lib. 1 de iudi. de leg. 8. nu. 10.
Speculum and others. And the places in the law, on which they ground their
sayings, are: in ca. Prudentiam, in ca. cum olim 2. in ca. venerabili de offic.
de leg. in ca. cum dilecta de rescriptis and alijs.

The second Proposition.
When a cause or matter is delegated, it follows not that all things
thereupon which may any way avail or bring furtherance to the business, are
delegated by virtue of the same commission, but such accessories only as
without which the business cannot be well and commodiously effected. A verity
partly taken out of the text of the law, Ca. Suspitionis de offi. iud del.
Sicut iurisdictio, sic and caetera sine quibus explicari causa non potest
intelliguntur esse commissa. As the Jurisdiction, so other things also without
which the cause cannot be dispatched, are understood to be committed: and
partly out of Verb. de* legatus* nu. ^.
Sil^ester Gemianus and Veru: whom there he cites. Id propter quod facilius
causa expediri posset, non venit nisi express committatur, and quamuis causa
delegata intelligantur omnia commissa, sine quibus causa expediri non potest,
non tamen omnia concessa sunt, quae possunt valere ad causam expediendam. That
through the which the cause may more easily be effected, does not fall under
the delegation, except it be expressedly contained in the commission: and
although the cause being delegated, all things are understood to be committed,
without which the cause cannot be effected, nevertheless all things are not
granted which may avail to the effecting of the cause.

The third Proposition.
When the commission runs in general terms without any express form or
limitation, the party delegate may use his discretion, and do any thing that so
serves to the accomplishment of the affair committed, as without it the same
cannot be well or commodiously effected: but if there be a certain form
prescribed (as there is in the Cardinals letter) that form is strictly to be
observed, and in no substantial jot to be gone from. The first part is proved
in the Chapters: Praeterea and prudentiam de officio and potestate Iudicis
delegati: and the latter, in the Chapter Cum dilecta de rescriptis. And both
the one and the other are jointly affirmed in the Gloss In ca. praeterea de
offic. iud de leg verb. simpliciter.
Cum simpliciter mandatur sine aliqua forma expressa, delegatus omnia potest
sine quibus causa expediri non potest, sed si certa forma esset data, illa
seruanda est. When the commission is in general terms without any express
form, the delegate or party commanded, may assay and execute all things,
without which the cause cannot be effected: but if there be a certain form
set down, that is to be kept. And how strictly it is specified in another
place, where this direction is given* Gloss. in ca. cum delecta de rescriptis.
Forma mandati diligentissime seruanda est. The form of the mandate is most
diligently to be observed.

The fourth Proposition.
WHen the form of the commission is broken, the limits of the Mandate are
transgressed. The proof Ca. prudentiam de offi. iud. del.
Mandati siquidem excedere fines probaretur, si quis citra formam rescripti
accepti praesumeret iudicare. He certes is proved to exceed the bounds of the
Mandate, who presumes to proceed beyond the form of his commission.

The fifth Proposition.
Whosoever goes beyond the limits of his commission, being the bounds of his
authority, Ca. venerabili de offi. del.
offends, but works nothing. Offends, because he usurps authority,
using that he has not, and works nothing, because Glossa in c^. hac
constitutione de offic. iud. deleg. li 6.
Processus delegati excedentis fines suae potestatis non valet. The process of
a delegate exceeding the limits of his commission is of no force. And
Panormita^ in ca prudentiam de offi. iud. deleg. nu. 5.
vbi datur certa forma procedendi, processus corruit non solum si aliquid
attentatur direct contra formam sed etiam citra vel praeter formam, where
there is a certain form given of proceeding, the process falls, and is of
no effect, not only if an attentive be made directly contrary to the form,
but also if any thing be enterprised beside or out of compass of the form.
Neither do any Canonists make question, but that the form of the Mandate or

laws, whether the particulars of the form prescribed be pretermitted or
exceeded.

The sixth Proposition.
THe formal and proper object of disobedience, that is the thing without which
there cannot be properly disobedience, is the superiors precept. D. Tho. 22.
q. 104. art. 2. Co. and in res. ad 2.
Tacitum vel expressum, either tacitiue or explicitiue. Tacitiue, when the
imperative or commanding will of the superior becomes kowne to the subject
after any signified manner soever. Explicitiue, when the precept is given in
more express and plain terms. Whence it follows, that no one is bound
under sin of disobedience to obey the will of a superior of what degree
soever, unless he signify the same his will to be a commandment. A
proposition which De veritate q. 23. art. vlt.
S. Tho. (whom both Verb. praeceptum nu. 2.
Siluester and De sept. pec. mort. ca. 15. verse sept. est.
Cardinal Tolet cite to this end) affirms in these words: Licet sciam
voluntatem praelati nisi tamen express praecipiat, non teneor. Although I know
the will of my Prelate, I am not bound to accomplish the same, unless he
expressly commaundme. The like also has In Man. ca. 23. nu. 36.
Nauar, where he declares when and how the sin of disobedience is committed:
Peccat (says he) qui deliberate omittit facere quod iubetur satis aperte a
superiore. He sins who deliberatly omitteth to do what is plainly enough
commanded by the superior: ergo what is not commanded, or not so plainly
commanded, as it may be Understood to be a command, the fulfilling thereof, ne
is, nor can be properly an act of disobedience in the subject: disobedience
always presupposing a known command of the superior.

The seventh Proposition.
THe accomplishment of any superiors precept, may be prolonged or omitted
without sin, fault, or breach of obedience, if a reasonable, just and lawful
cause occur, and no peril of scandal probably appear evident. For if the
cause be just and lawful, the act proceeding from the same not tainted by any
ill circumstance, must needs be of like quality. Yea a further truth, the
cause that bona fide D. Th. 22. q. 147. art. 3. and Caict. ibi Pal. in 4. did
15. q. 4. Sil. ver ieiunium. nu. 21 and Caict. in Sum. ver. praeceptum
and to the doers understanding seemed just, though in truth and in it self it
were not just, excuses the omission from mortal sin.

The eighth Proposition.
THe subject probably thinking that his superior commanded the thing he did by
reason of wrong information, and that he would not have commanded it, had he
known the truth, and for that cause deferring to execute the commandment,
and aduertising his superior with speed of the truth, and reason that moved
him to defer, with express submission also to do as he should after direct,
neither commits the sin of disobedience, nor violateth any other moral
virtue, as it appears plain not only by reason, but also by the authority
of the Ca Si quando, and ca. pastoralis de rescrip.
Canon law and the doctrine of In Man. ca. 23. nu. 38.
Nauar.

The ninth Proposition.
NOne are bound to obey the commandment of their superior wherein he
exceeds the limits of the authority he holds over them, in respect the
inferior is only bound to obey his superior in the thing in which he is his
inferior and subject, and in no other. 2. 2. q. 104. art. 5.
Non tenetur (says S. Tho.) inferior suo superiori obedire si ei aliquid
praecipiat in quo ei non subditur. The inferiout is not bound to obey his
superior, if he command him any thing in which he is not his subject, or in
subordination unto him. A doctrine so generally true, that if the Pope himself
should command beyond the bounds of his jurisdiction, none are bound to obey
as writes In ca. inquisitioni de sent. excom. nu. 4.
Pope Innocentius, De pecca. morta. ca. 15. verse. sextis est.
Cardinal Tolet, and others.

The tenth Proposition.
NO subject is bound to obey and execute the commandment of his superior,
when in Gre. de. Val. To. 3. disp. 5. q. 14 punct. 4. and disp. 7. q. 3. punct.
2 and To. 4. disp. 7. q. 17. punct. 2.
reason and wisdom he cannot (as having clear evidence to the contrary)
acquiet and conform his understanding to the judgment of his superior, or
think the commandment to be right or just, or binding, or under his
authority. An assertion so certainly true, as to doubt thereof, were to call
into question whether man should be governed like a beast, or that he could
surprise and dispose his understanding, how, and as he listed, in matters
wherein he has a demonstratiue, or evident certitude in judgment.

The eleventh Proposition.
ALthough in doubtful matters that bring no detriment with them to the
subject, the subject is bound to obey his superior, because the superior is
in the possession of his authority, and consequently his title and interest
the greater and abler: nevertheless in such doubts as on which Adrianus
Quodli^t. 2. Sotus de ratio. tegendi, and deteg. secren. chapter 3. q. 2. Concl. 2.
and 3. Salon. To. 2. disp. de tributis and vectiga. art. 3. controuer. 8. verse.
ad intelligendu^
great prejudice attends the execution of the superiors commandment, the
subject is not bound to obey, so long as he is prudently doubtful whether he
be bound or no. Which position is true, and holds if the prejudice redoundeth
but to a third person, and more if to himself, and most of all, if to a
community or multitude. The reason: because the subject is likewise here in
possession of the peculiar, be it his honor, fame, goods, liberty, life, or
the like, in which his obedience would turn him to detriment. And no one is
bound to surrender and deprive himself to his own prejudice of that he has
in possession, unless the right and interest of the claimer be very certain
and manifest, which cannot be as long as the subject prudently doubts of the
superiors authority in the particular commanded.

The twelfth Proposition.
THe subject may without mortal sin disobey his Ecclesiastical superior
annexing no censure to his command, so that he were not carried by contempt to
the neglecting of the command. A conclusion of P. 2. in. 4. q. de voto dissicu.

Gregorius de Valentia, where he defines contumacie that makes a mortal

excommunication, this, or that, to be done or not done. Which kind of
commination, or any other, the Cardinal Protector, neither did in his own
person, nor in the person of his Holiness so much as in the least manner once
insinuate in any part of his Graces Letter Constitutiue.

The thirteenth and last Proposition.
A Superior proceeding unjustly (as he does when he commands more then the
place and authority he holds gives him leave) may without all imputation of
blame (the peril of scandal ever excepted) be as lawfully resisted as an
Nauar. in ca contingat causa 5. nullitatis n 8
adversary, as a D. Tho. 22. q. 69. art. 4. c.

tyrant or foreign enemy. So that to disobey a Superior, enlarging his
precepts beyond the utmost bounds of his authority, is so far from the
nature of criminal disobedience, as it cannot be said to be the least sin:
yea the case may be such, as it were sin and perhaps great sin to obey. For
none will deny, but that there is D. Tho. 22. q. 104 art 5. ad 3. and. D.
Bernard. Epist. 7.
a kind of obedience which is indiscreet or unlawful, agreeable to that Canon
of holy Church collected out of S. Gregory, 3. p. pastoralis cura. 2. q. 7.
ca. admonendi.
Admonendi sunt subditi ne plus quam expeditsint subiecti, ne cum student plus
quam necesse est hominibus subijci, compellantur vitia eorum venerari. Those
that live under subjection are to be admonished that they be no more subject
then is meet, lest whiles they endeavor to show more subjection to men then is
necessary, they be compelled to worship their vices.

THese grounds being laid, we proceed and affirm that the Cardinals Letter, as
it is plain to the Reader, makes no mention at al of any Mandate or
Commission which his Holiness should give, other then that he should employ his
endeavor to make peace in our Country, to the example of the peace and
quietness established in the English College at Rome. And how this
commandment did communicate authority to the Cardinal to institute an
Archpriest over us, with like jurisdiction and sovereignty as is expressed in
the Letter Constitutiue, appeared a more strange point unto us, then we could
understand, or find out any ground, or show of reason, how the said
commandment of his Holiness could any way be in such sort possibly extended,
and retain force to bind. For what necessary connection is there between
making of peace in our Country, and instituting of an Archpriest over one part
of those that were at variance, with jurisdiction to spoil them of their
faculties, to remove them from their places of residence, to deprive them of
the use of their Priestly functions, and to afflict and unable them to do good
in our Church, and in no degree to subordinate the other more principal part
of the contenders to the least jot of the same jurisdiction? We say, what
necessary and straight conjunction is there between the two precedents, that
Commission being granted to labor and effectuate the one, viz. peace in our
Country, authority must thereby be thought to be granted to erect and
appoint the other, viz. an Archprist? Must the assigning of an Archpriest with
such jurisdiction be holden alike intrinsicall or dependant an accessorie to
the taking up of dissension, and of making peace, as not ordaining the one, the
other could not be effected? None will say it that shall compare them together,
and none can say it, that have well looked upon the sequel: conte^tio^, strife,
debate, variance, broiles, scandal, parts-taking, enmity, slanders,
calumniations, wrongs, injuries, being now most rife in our Church, and never
heard of before. Neither any marvel at all, whiles one who was unknown unto
us to have any such authority, nor many years ever holden but for our back
friend, would institute in our Church a new form of government, the like
never heard of in the world, merely penal, wholly consisting in punishing,
and in punishing contrary to the form of law, that is, without citing,
without trial, without proof of the accusation. And to bring this
intolerable burden upon us, without making so much as any one of our body
privy thereunto, and also to give us none other satisfaction of this his
Graces strange proceeding in our Church, but only the warrant of his own
Letter, and the same not addressed to us neither, but to the superior only,
whom himself without all our consents or weeting preferred to the office, by
the sole information of him, whose busy head and actions have been the cause
and increase of much trouble and persecution in our Church and Realm. And who
being a member of another body: and professing also a mortified state, and to
have relinquished the world, seeks nevertheless to be our great master, and
to rule all: and would to God but to rule, and not to domineere or tyrannize
rather.

Let any practiced Governor Ecclesiastical or temporal, or any one of common
understanding in the world, tell us whether this platform, this new and
strange kind of government, and as strange a manner of proceeding in it, were
a mean to make peace, or not rather the high way to break peace, to kindle
debates, to multiply dissension: and as it were to strike up an alatum of
troubles in our poor afflicted Church, too manifoldly (if it pleafed God to
the contrary) already tossed?

The new authority therefore being in it self no greater a help to the
setting forward of peace, and in the sequel so preiudicious; the first,
second, third, and fifth Propositions, show that his Holiness commanding the
Cardinal to bestow his pains for the establishing of peace and concord, to
the pattern of the peace wrought in the English College at Rome, did not
therein for ought appears, or may be gathered out of the Constitutiue Lettet,
give commission to his Grace to enact the foresaid jurisdiction.

Again, the second, third, and fifth Propositions declare, that the enacting
of the like authority, not being so nigh linked and united an accessorie to
the principal in charge, as the one might not be well effected without the
institution of the other, declare we say, that we were not bound by any law of
holy Church or duty of obedience, to subject our selves to such his Graces
ordinance: because his Grace seemed eue^ by the tenor of the self
Constitutiue Letter, to have exceeded the limits of his Holiness Commission
unto him, in that receiving but a commandment to make peace, he made an
Archpriest, and endued him with largest punishing jurisdiction and sovereignty
over us. Neither of which were behooueable, or not so behooueable to the making
of peace, as that peace could not be made without these, as is already showed.
And therefore his Graces decree, touching the subordination could not, at least
in the judgment of our own thoughts bind us, the same appearing unto us to be
an excesser or too great an enlargement of the delegation committed. Plain by
the authorities and proves laid down in the said Propositions.

But if our adversaries shall here say, that the Constitutiue Letter makes
mention how his Grace in ordaining the new authority, followed therein the
will of his Holiness: we may answer, that imagining as we did, and upon most
pregnant grounds, that father Parsons was the inditer of the letter, we had
little reason knowing him as we do, to credit every word therein, especially the
matter being so greatly prejudicial to our selves, Church, and Realm, and so
fit a rise or step besides, to his further designs.

Another reason also, and which more induced us not to believe every word in
the Cardinals Letter, was the report it made of the fatherly charity which the
Jesuits exhibited toward all Priests in our country, and that they molested
no one. An affirmance so far from truth, as to doubt whether it be true or
no, were to doubt whether ye be cold or fire hot, or whether there be a Sun
in the element. For who can deny, unless he be resolved to deny any thing how
apparent or demonstrable soever, but that all the Clergy and sociall
dissension in our Realm proceeded from some of the fathers of the Society? The
dissension at Wishich from fa. Weston assuming superiority, the dissension now
on foot, from fa. Lister the author, from fa. Garnet the approuer: from fa.
Jones the increaser, from fa. Holtby the maintainer, and from some other of the
Society, the abettours of our most grievous wrongs and infamy.

Thus no doubt we might answer, and neither idly nor untruly, yet we will not
thus answer, but refer our selves to the sixth Proposition, which yields
another kind of reioynder, and brings more light and help to our cause and
innocence.

For the said Proposition teaches, that the formal object of obedience is the
known precept of a Superior, not the sole will, unless it be an imperative
or commanding will, and so notified as the subject understand it to be a
command.

So that admitting we had been bound to heleeue every word in the Cardinals
Letter, as how little we were bound it will appear anon, and more in the next
reason: yet the Cardinal using but these words ( Nos Stis suae pijssimam
prouidentissimamque voluntatem sequentes, hoc ipsum statuere decreuimus. We
following the most godly and the most provident will of his Holiness, have
decreed to appoint a subordination among the English secular Priests) we could
not see how this related will of his Holiness did put on the nature of a
precept, especially after so express and certain a manner, as that we were
bound (all causes how just soever set aside) to obey forthwith the new
authority, and not respite our absolute submission thereunto, no not so long as
til we could se^d to his Holiness for more direct and assured knowledge in the
matter.

Beside, the reasons were neither few nor vulgar, but many and very material,
which drove us to think, that if his Holiness had possessed such a
determination, as at unawares without any one of our assents or priuitie, to
appoint us a superior, and with so large sovereignty over us, yet that he
would never have used so little favor toward us, who live in the midst of so
many miseries, and daily spend our lives for the truth and primacie of that
Chair, as to enact the authority in so powerable a manner, that even at the
first appearing thereof, and by the bare Letter of one Cardinal only, it
should be the crime either of notorious disobedience or schism (an
impossibility) even not to prostrate our selves, and surrender our full and
absolute obedience thereunto, without either making question how it come, or so
much as to send to his Holiness for understanding whether it was his ordinance
or no.

First the mild and sweet disposition of his Holiness nature forbad us so to
think: then the quality of our pressures: the ancient Canons Distinct. 63. Ca.
Si ^n plebibus.
of the holy Church allowing Priests the election of their Archpriest: the
deserts of our poor estate, serving God in the degree of Priesthood without
either enjoying or expectance of Church living; yea and which did most of all
deforce us from entertaining so hard a thought of his Holiness love and
pastoral regard toward us his afflictiue laborers, was the most respective
and honorable speeches, which himself used to some of our brethren: namely
that he would not appoint any order of government in our country, before the
good A ground of surreption.
Priests in England (so gracious were his Holiness words) should advertise
him, what kind of government were fittest and best sorted with the miseries of
our Church.

That his Holiness used these speeches, there be two Priests or more in England
that will depose it: and father Parsons himself having more then once reported
so much, cannot without doing wrong to his religious profession, deny or unsay
the same, So that the question rested, whether of these two we should sooner
and were more bound
to believe, the Popes own word or the Cardinals Letter. Either the Popes word
related unto us by several of our brethren of good report, and the immediate
hearers thereof, or the Cardinals Letter penned as we no whit doubted, by our
boldest adversary containing apparent untruths, as before is showed, and will
hereafter more appear.

And now, the matter of our choice to whom we should give more credit, being
of this quality: whether sooner to believe the Popes own word, or the
Cardinals Letter, was it possible that father Lister or any other of less holy
profession and of meaner parts, could embolden their pens and tongues to
by-name us so prodigally as he and some of his complicers have done? Or could
it be thought credible, that our superior, who by his place and order of
charity, is the more invited to love us, and bound by justice wherein he may to
defend us, would entreat his children (our trespass no greater) in so unkind
and hard a manner as he has done and continues? Let others, who can,
answer. We will return and proceed in our proves.

Senior Acrisio of the Popes Fiscals, and who had commission to examine master
Bishop and master Charnocke in their imprisonment at Rome, has given very
good testimony, and with like circumstances as not lightly any evidence may
deserve more belief. For this officer having by himself and father Parsons
taken the examination of the two prisoners, and demanded of like as many
questions of them, as were thought necessary, he told them that now he was to
make relation of all things to his Holiness, and therefore counseled them to
commend the cause to God by prayer, adding that it were not amiss also, if
they would enjoin to themselves three days fast that week, for better
prospering of the affair. A spiritual task which the prisoners gladly
undertook, and performed in the time prescribed.

The next week Senior Acrisio came to the prisoners, and among other matters
very confidently affirmed to them both apart, that the new superiority was not
instituted by his Holiness command, as his Holiness himself (with whom the
day before he had conference about the same point) told him, and yielded for
reason, that he durst not enact a form of government in our country (o the
strange information that was given against us) for that he would not adventure
to have his authority contemned of the Priests in England.

What better proof (if Senior Acrisio Priest and his Holiness Fiscall, be an
honest man in his words) can be demanded then this, for justifying the delay we
made in subiecting our selves to the Arch-priests authority? What argument
taken from the event of the matter, can be of more force to show, that we had
reason to suspe^d our belief in many particulars of the Constitutiue Letter:
or what more pregnant conjecture can there occur (the Fiscals words being
true) then that Fa. Parsons of likelihood has told many a good tale to his
Holiness for inducing him to conceive alike hardly of out whole secular
Clergy, as scarcely harder could be conceived, had we bin the lozels of the
world, and not our loyalty, obedience, respect, love, dutifulnes, and
sufferance for the eminency of that Sea, equal with the merits of any Clergy
in the world?

The same officer also, or another of greater calling, which is more This
letter is in the English book.
likely, told master Bishop, as himself witnesses in his letter to Fa.
Parsons, that his Holiness had at the most, no other purpose touching the bond
and imposition of the authority, then that it should be proposed to the Priests
in England, for trial whether they thought that kind of government fit and
sorting with the state of their country, and then as they should make known
their opinions therein, his Holiness intended to establish or change it.

And beside the report of the Fiscall herein, strengthened by so solemn and
particular circumstances, the busy, busy endeavors of the society to get
Priests to set to their names to a letter beginning with Olim dicebamur, in
testimony of their applause and thanksgiving to his Holiness, for appointing
the authority, and his Holiness long delay (a full twelve month or
thereabout) to confirm the same, is argument evident enough (if no invincible
proof) that the truth and process of matters, were no other then is said.

Or if in so probable a truth, there need more conjectures, the hardness of our
two brethren their entreaty by Fa. Parsons, the like, as never had a president
in that place, does not a little confirm that all was not sound and
justifiable. For undoubtedly if there had not laid a pad in the straw, or some
secret hid in the deck of the stratageme, which Fa. Parsons would not have his
Holiness and others to see: what need was there for him to procure (doubtless
by no charitable or true information) the imprisoning of his contrymen, of
Priests, of laborers in Gods vineyard, of those who for zeal of religion, had
made themselves incapable of favor in their own country, and one of them
relinquished a rich inheritance; to procure the imprisoning of those who for
many years space, had continually ventured their lives, and with good profit,
for reducing of souls to the obedience of the Sea Apostolic: to procure the
imprisoning of those, who with all submissiuenesse of duty came a long and a
chargeable journey to his Holiness foot, out of love and conscience to unfold
all things to his wisdom, and for truer understanding of his Holiness
pleasure? What need was there not only to imprison them before they were
heard, or could come to the presence of his Holiness, but to apprehend them
with Isberze by night, with torches most infamously, and himself (a religious
man) to be the leader and chieftaine? What need was there to imprison them
apart, to rifle them of all the instructions, letters, and notes they brought,
to keep them close without license so so much as to hear Mass, even upon
some of the chiefest feasts in Gods Church? What need was there for himself to
be their Iailour, New years day and Twelfe day.
and keeper of the keys of both their chambers? What need was there to deny
them to have their learned counsel or Advocates which they severally and
earnestly requested, and which seemed so just a petition as father Holby in his
discourse of the last of June 1601. auoweth under ferious protestation, that
they had it granted unto them, and brings it in, to imply their greater
guiltiness, for that having their learned counsel and pleaders allowed, were
nevertheless condemned and found worthy of the punishment laid upon them,
which was to be banished, and confined in the banishment, without any
contribution or relief at all toward their maintenance? What need was there,
their arrest and imprisonment being so publicly known as it was, and the
whole course and manner thereof being so strange, as it could not but give
token to every one of some notable and heinous crime in them, to try them after
in secret in the College, and to suffer neither scholar of the house, nor
externe, nor any at all, to be present at their trial, beside the two
Cardinals their Judges, Senior Acrisio the Fiscall, father Tichborne the
Notary, Doctor Haddocke, and master Martin Array advocates for the Archpriest,
himself, and the two prisoners, to the end no doubt, that none might
witness, lament, and admire, for what sinful trespass (so to call their
Christian intents) they were so long and so straightly imprisoned, and
condemned to the sufferance of so greatly infamous and extreme punishment?
What need was there never to release them of their durance, no not after their
trial before the two Cardinals, until such times as his Holiness had
confirmed the authority by his Breue? What need was there that in the very
grant of the prisoners liberty, they must be enjoined under heauiest penalties
to depart the city within twelve days, and that the days of the one must be
expired too, ere the other might be enlarged, or set foot out of the College?
What need was there that the prisoners being to be exiled and confined, might
not yet (as they instantly desired) be confined together in one place or
province? In fine, what need was there that our two brethren might not at least
going both one way for many hundredth of miles to the places assigned of their
confinement, could nevertheless upon their instant desire be suffered to take
comfort one of the others company, being both Priests, in so wearisome,
dangerous, and desolate a journey?

Undoubtedly these and other like vsages insinuated something: they had their
meaning: fa. Parsons is wise, and therefore how little soever his complexion
inclines him to pity, yet he would not show the like extremities for
manifesting his inclination and potencie only. He devised the platform of the
government: our brethren disliked it. Enough: Or if we should add more, what
must we say? The authority being a bird of fath. Garnet and father Parsons own
hatching, and the man whom they promoted thereunto of their own choosing: also
the form of the subordination creating themselves in truth and underhand, the
appointers of the Archpriest, the designers of the Assistants, the makers of
our laws, the dispensers, the disposers, the directors, the commanders, and
our great masters in all things. Their stomachs were too great not to have the
subordination to go forward, howsoever father Parsons his soul lay at pawn in
the Interim, as well for his usage toward our two brethren, as also for abusing
therein of the Sea Apostolic.

Neither among so many strange wonders, could we marvel at any thing more,
then what the cause or drift might be, why father Parsons coming on a time
from his Holiness, told one of the prisoners M. Charuock
that he had never so much ado, as to persuade his Holiness, that he and his
fellow Agent were Catholic Priests and not heretics; a thing as father
Parsons auowed, which his Holiness would not believe of a long while. O good
God, to what times are we reserved to live in, either for that so unjust an
information should be given to the highest Pastor against virtuous Priests, or
that an ancient religious man, should in such sort gloss and counterfeit? For
it cannot be possible, if his Holiness stood so conceited, but that very
impious untruths and with greatest color of truth were inculcated to his
Holiness, ere his practiced and aged judgment could entertain and ground so
bad an opinion of English Priests, as they coming so far off unto him,
should be of any other religion then Catholic.

Two Priests to come out of England to Rome, and purposely to his Holiness
Chair, and in a message and supplication from Priests: whereof a good many
were then, are now, and had been a long while in durance for the Catholic
cause, and in an affair merely belonging to the Roman Religion, with a pressed
readiness also to follow and obey his Holiness order in the same, as under
their booke-othes they assured, are (we trow) no tokens of heresy, but ablest
demonstration of conuincing the contrary.

What should then be the cause that his Holiness was possessed with so hard an
opinion against them, and consequently against us all, from whom, and in whose
names they came? Was it the matter they came about? Impossible, if right
information had been given: because they came only to understand the truth
concerning the institution of the new authority, and to open to his Holiness
wisdom, our difficulties about the same: and to acquaint him with the
spiritual wants of our country, with humblest petition for supply. Cardinal
Caietane (who had most cause to stretch the action to the hardest sense against
us, in that it might bear some sembla^ce of an opposition against his
ordinance) and Cardinal Burghesio openly acknowledged at the time when our two
brethren appeared before them, sitting in judgment upon their cause, that they
could not find fault with the intention and matter they came for. And if the
intention and matter were lawful or not justly to be blamed, as both their
Graces affirmed, let our adversaries tell what might the trespass be, why his
Holiness mind was so greatly auerted, or rather his holy zeal incensed?

The messengers were reported, the one to be a Maultster and a Horse-courser,
the other for an incontinent person. O tongue liberty whither runnest thou? O
father Parsons how credulous are you in bad matters? Let but this latter be
proved, notwithstanding you said (who perchance counts such a saying no bad
policy) that a Priest swear it, and two other Priests took their oaths that
they heard him swear it, and we do all here yield our selves without further
conviction to be traitors to God and his Church, and crave the faggot.

There was a night-cappe with a border of black silk two fingers deep, a
dozen of silk points, fine sockes, a sword, and a dagger found in their
chambers, and matter of much good sport made thereat: father Parsons the
chiefest doer, having now forgotten how himself went attired when he lived in
England, and how some of his brethren here now go more costly then any Priest.

The messengers were accused, that they came to Rome to renew the stirs in the
College. The apprehension of M. Dudley, M. Barrowes, M. R^wse, and M. Watson:
the remove of Fa. Weston, M. Archer, M. Southworth, and M. Pound, from Wisbich
to the Tower: the great search made by the Officers for our Archpriest, was
laid to their charge, as a complot agreed on before their going, and after
executed by us here their confederates. To make the bead-rowle long enough, it
was objected that M. Doctor Bagshaw had a pension of fifty pound a year of
her Majesty: that we dealt with the Counsel and took direction from them.
The fall of M. Ithell, and the Apostacy of Friar Sacheuerill, were laid
warmely in their dish, with a long rabble of surmises, what would become of some
others if they hold on? Were not these fine exceptions (we appleale to the
whole world) or accusations rather? Who would ever think they could have bin
spoken without a vizard, or objected by any who before had not shaken hands
with all shamefastness? Alas alas, whither do unruly humors drive such, as
serve them? For could there be grosser tales devised, if one would have fabled
for the whetstone? or more infamous slanders coined, if there had been a
dispensation granted to forge at pleasure? That these things were laid in the
dish of our two brethren, and against us their fellows, it cannot with any
truth be denied, or but with the abandoning of a great deal of modesty be
stood against. For sundry Letters containing the greatest part of the premises,
and which father Parsons had the perusing of, and was the inditor or prompter
of all, or most of the contents, and which also himself sent open into
England, to and for our Archpriest and others to read, are yet extant, and
both the priests living against whom the said counterfeit crimes were objected,
and who are ready to witness, or if need so require, to depose so much as
before is rehearsed.

But what would we infer out of all these? Verily not that father Parsons did
accuse them and us to his Holiness in all the foresaid crimes, for then
undoubtedly his manners had been so far discrepant from the etymology of his
religious name, as black is from white, or hell from heaven. Nevertheless we
cannot but assure our selves that he or some other (and none but himself has
the office of informership in the English affairs) played a monstrous bad part
in inciting his Holiness by untrue and ungodly suggestion to conceive so
infinite hardly of our two brethren, as not to be brought but upon long
persuasion to think them to be Catholic Priests.

Now although the reasons, testimonies, and probabilities already alleged may
sufficiently declare, what grounds we had to believe that his Holiness did
neither command the institution of the new authority, nor was privy to the
particulars: yet because we desire to abound in the purgation of our good names
(being all that we have to leese, and better then great riches) we will add a
few more for fuller Proverb. 22.
proof and testimony of the issue.

It seemed then a matter most improbable unto us, that his Holiness carrying a
singular praise for his wisdom and clemency in governing, would ever appoint
so barren an authority in our poor distressed Church, as this appeared to be,
consisting wholly in a liberty and freedom to punish without the admixture of
the least comfort redounding to any thereby. Yea it appeared incredible in our
understanding, that his Holiness after so many tokens of favor and compassion
toward our miseries, would ordain the like strange and penal government,
and not so much as to give us notice thereof from himself by Breue or missiue
letter: knowing that without such immediate notice or other Canonical
certitude, we could neither in discretion, wisdom, nor conscience, admit so
mere a burden void of all manner of commodity in our Church.

When his Holiness made Cardinal Allen of blessed memory, our Superior, he
declared it by a Breue, notwithstanding the state and rich deserts of the man,
our founder in learning and common parent. Note the precedent.
Which president and foregoing example, did in a sort command us to believe,
that if the new subordination (far more strange and in some points more
ample too, then the authority of the good Cardinal) had been the binding
ordinance of his Holiness, his pastoral wisdom would in like manner have
vouchsafed (specially conferring so large jurisdiction upon a private man, not
in dignity before, nor of any mark or reckening in comparison of the true
virtuous, a like wise, and most learned Allen) to publish and attestate such
his fact to our Church by a Breue or some other kind of Apostolical writ. And
we were alike through settled in this opinion, as we reckned the contrary a
plain derogation to his Holiness wisdom, clemency, judgment and
compassion.

Another probability* The Constitutiue Letter as M. Blackwell read it unto us;
directed (except our memories do much deceive us) that the rest of the
Assistants who were left to the Archpriest to choose, should be selected out of
the number of the auncientest Priests, that had their places of residence in or
nearest about London, to the end (as the reason was adjoined) that he might
upon every occurrance, have some ready at hand to consult withal. The
breaking of which prescript, form and direction, did secure us that the Letter
Constitutiue was not the ordinance or commandment of his Holiness. For if it
had been either, as there wanted not reason to move us, so did we thoroughly
presume, that neither M. Blackwell nor the Jesuits (in truth the chief
Electors) receiving express direction to choose the rest of the assistants
among the elder sort of Priests, residing in or nearest about London, would
ever have been so venturous, as contrary to the selfeforme of the Commission,
not only to choose two, three, or four of the Assistants, but the whole number
of them in places furthest remote from the place assigned. And that such a
direction was expressly contained in the Cardinals Letter, as it was showed
unto us by M. Blackwel, M. Charnocke, and my self (who were first of al sent
for before him to acknowledge the authority) are ready to witness, and beside
the record of both our memories, the presumptions ensuing do not a little seem
to confirm the same.

Anon after that M. Blackwel had chosen the full number of the Assistants, a
Gentleman very inward with him in these affairs, brought their names unto me
in writing, which when I had read and saw that some of the^ which were chosen,
dwelt in the North, another in Wales, another in the West Country, and others
in place far distant, and no one, in or near to London, the place assigned:
I demanded why M. Blackwell had not chosen his Assistants according to the
direction of the Cardinals Letter out of the number of the auncientest Priests
in and about London. The Gentleman not denying but that the Cardinals Letter so
prescribed, gave this answer: that if M. Blackwell had chosen the Assistants
according to the direction of the Cardinals Letter in and near about London,
this inconvenience had followed, that he could not have had, or not so
conveniently by much, so ready aduertisements from those parts and quarters of
the Realm, where he has now chosen the Assistant, as by this mean (his
Assistants there residing) he shall have.

Which reason how weighty soever it appear, yet because in Delegations, and
no less in subdelegation, the Ca. Cum dil^cta. de rescriptis, and glossa
ibidem. Ca si cui de elect. li. ^ and glo. ibidem and glo. in ca. Praeterea de

form of the rescript is of the substance of the Commission, and strictly to
be observed, and not to be gone from, or what is done to the contrary to be of
no force and void in law, as the third, fourth, and fifth Propositions teach.
For which respect, and also because the reason alleged in the Cardinals
Letter, for having the rest of the Assistants to be chosen in and near about
London, was expedient and very behouefull: we could not think that M.
Blackwell or the Jesuits would ever (in any such ouert and actual manner at
least) transgress the direction and selfe-forme of the Commission, had he, or
they taken the Constitutiue Letter to be the ordinance of his Holiness, and
not for the plot of father Parsons, receiving reputation by bearing the
Cardinals name, but the thing it self left wholly to the others order,
framing, and direction.

Another proof or presumption, though not so forceably concluding, and which
time (a good decypherer of matters) has sithence discovered, is the appearing
of a second form of the Constitutiue Letter as we take it, or at least wise of
a copy of the Constitutiue Letter, subscribed and signed with the Cardinals
hand and seal, as was the Constitutiue Letter it self. And that this is true,
thus we make plain. The Constitutiue Letter which M. Blackwell first showed
unto us, bore date the 7. of March, 1598. as himself will not deny, nor can,
if he then showed us the true Letter, because the Popes Breue confirms it by
that date: and about some four months after the atonement made upon the
arrival of his Holiness Breue, my self entreating M. Blackwell for a sight
of the Cardinals Letter, to the end I might once thoroughly see (as wisdom and
conscience did require) to what I was bound: he sent me the Letter which is
verbatim set down in the beginning of the book, and which was subscribed and
sealed with the Cardinals name and signet: and his name so far as we could
guess (for more Priests saw it beside my self) was written also with his Graces
own hand. But this Letter bore no date at all, either of the day of the
month, or year of our Lord, as I can well prove (if it be denied) by
sufficient witnesses.

And being in this manner infallibly sure that there were two several Letters
Constitutiue, both attested with the Cardinals hand and seal, the one with
date, the other without date: and therefore not to be said that the Cardinal
out of his provident wisdom, sent two Letters of one purport into England, to
the end that if one miscarried, the other might come to M. Blackwell his hand:
for that a Letter bearing no date, can carry little credence, and consequently
not sufficient to work so great and effect as was intended, the erection and
establishment of a subordination, both merely penal, and without example from
the beginning of the world.

Hereupon, I for my part do not see the counter-euidence, why M. Charnocke and
my self should distrust, or not rather trust our memories agreeing both in
one, and little doubt but the Constitutiue Letter which M. Blackwel first
showed to us both, differed from the other which he sithence sent unto me to
read. And not only in the matter about choosing the Assistants, but in another
point also more importa^t: which was, that the offenders should dicta causa, be
heard to speak and answer for themselves, before condemnation or punishment
infflicted: a right that nature and all laws prescribe. I use the Latin words
( dicta causa) because I seem and have since ever seemed to remember the very
words themselves, which makes me as in this, so in the former also the less
doubtful by much, whether my memory fails me, yea or no in the said
particulars.

Neither can we yield a reason why fa Parsons or some other might not as well
alter the Constitutiue Letter in these points, as he or some other altered the
sentence of the two Cardinals, Caictane and Burgheso, in the exile and
confinement of our two brethren. And that their honors sentence was altered in
the copy, which was sent into England by fa. Parsons (unless some other besides
fa. Parsons writes to our Archpriest of such matters) and which M. Blackwel
read to M. Mush and me, and showed the same to others, is so apparent a truth,
that M. Blackwell can in no sort deny it. The sentence in the original was,
that in virtue of holy obedience and under censure of present suspension from
divine offices, they should not ( pro tempore for a time) presume to go into
England, Scotland, or Ireland without the express leave of his Holiness or
the Lord Cardinal Protector: but in the copy it was thus changed, that under
the foresaid censure they should not presume to return or go into any of the
said kingdoms for the space of ^. years. So that the words ( pro tempore for
a time) in the original signifying an indefinit space of time, were altered in
the copy which was sent into England, went here current and none but it, into a
determined and set space of time, contrary to the words of the original, and
more then could be collected out of the tenor, nor the sentence ever so
interpreted to our brethren on whom it passed.

Now if fa. Parsons dealt thus boldly in the sentence of the two Cardinals,
what reason can be yielded why we should discredit our memories standing upon
so many presumptions, rather then think that fa. Parsons would strain
courtesy to change or get to be changed the Letter Constitutiue, a device and
plot of his own, and whereof he has the whole managing.

That which we would add further in this point, is: that his Holiness
confirming only that Letter of the Cardinal which bore date the 7. of March,
in which the abouenamed particulars were expressed (unless as is said, our
memories do wonderfully deceive us, whereof yet we have no more doubt then of
what we doubt least) it follows, if so the said particulars were indeed
expressed in the Constitutiue Letter which his Holiness confirmed, that the
election of the Assistants made by M. Blackwell is frustrate, and likewise all
such censures and penalties as he has imposed upon us, otherwise then the
form of his Commission gave him authority to do. And consequently rests
bound by the prescript Ca. sin. de ^a^^s. ca. sacro de sent. excom. Glossa in
ca. quo^^m cotra de probation. v b. negligentiam. Nauar in man. ca. 25. nu. 12.
Siluest. v'b. index 1. nu. 17. and omnes.
rule of law and conscience to make us rateable satisfaction to the measure of
the infamy and damages sustained: great and very great both.

For proof of the premises Pope Innoccntius the third writes, Ca. C^m
dilecta, de rescriptis.
Processum contra formam rescripti attentatum, irritum decernimus and inanem.
We define that the Process be of no effect and void which was either begun or
proceeded in, contrary to the form of the Commission. The like to this, has
Pope Bonifacius the eight. Ca. Si cui de elect. lib. 6.
Si cui eligendi potestas data suit, and iuxta traditam sibi formam non
eligerit talis electio non valet nec robur obtinet firmitatis. If power of
electing be given to any one, and he shall not choose according to the limit or
form prescribed, such an election is void ( Glossa. Ibide ^^b. valcre.
ipso iure) and retains no force.

Now, that he who receives Commission to cl^use for such a cause, such persons
to his Assistants, as have their residences at such a place, breaks the form
of his Commission if he choose them otherwhere. there can be no question made
thereof, and consequently the Panormit. in ca. prudentia^ de ossi. iud dele.
n^. 5. and Ant. F^an. in ca. cum post deelectione.
act he does therein is of no validity, nor can bind any one to take them for
Assistants.

The third and last principal reason, why we could not think the new
subordination to be the ordinance of his Holiness, or appointed by his
commandment, was in respect of the rigours it contained, a note farthest
removed from his Holiness nature, and course of proceeding. For instances.

First, it appeared incredible that his Holiness tender compassion toward
the several and heauiest afflictions that the laws of our Country lay upon
us, would to the increase of our burden institute a mere penal jurisdiction
in our Church, carrying only power to punish and afflict us more: yea, and in
such sort (as we took the case) to punish and afflict us, as not after any
condign satisfaction and worthiest amendment, the Superior had authority to
restore the offender, 24 q. 1. ca. Si ^etrus. and. did. 21. ca. inferior. and
depaenit. did. 1. ca. verbu^. and Silu^ster. verb. Absolu. 1. nu. 3.
to that which before he deprived him of, namely his faculties, the only
instrument and mean of doing good to others, and for himself to live by. For
although in Censures of holy Church regularly he that has authority to bind,
has also authority to loose, and contrary wise he that has authority to
loose, has authority to bind: yet it followed not at least in our
understanding (the taking away of faculties being no censure) that because the
Archpriest had authority given him to take away faculties, granted by whom or
whenever, therefore he could give or restore them again, after he had once
taken them away, in regard his authority being delegatine and after a prescript
form it could not (at least as we thought) be extended beyond the cases
expressed. And therefore no express signification being made of any such
authority in the Constitutiue Letter, that he might restore again all such
faculties as he had for any cause taken away, we thought the subordination to
be much more rigorous or defective in this point, then that it could be the
ordinance or commandemement of his Holiness.

A second instance. It appeared incredible that his Holiness bearing so great
commendation for mercifulness and lenity as he does, would nevertheless
enact a new kind of punishment for the Priests of our country only, ^ighting
in more blood for maintaining the sovereignty of that Chair, then any other
Clergy at this day in the world. We presume to say a new kind of punishment
for the Priests of our country only, because the ancient and usual manner of
punishing Priests in other countries, that show themselves disobedient,
unquiet, or stubborn, against their Ecclesiastical superiors, is by
imposition of censures, that is by debarring them the use of their Priestly
functions, not by taking their faculties quite from them. But in the new
subordination, authority is given not only to suspend or debar us from the
use of our faculties, but as if that tie and punishment were too slight, or
brought not misery enough upon us, we must have all our faculties taken quite
and clean from us, given by whom and whenever. A kind of jurisdiction
seldom heard of, and never used upon any Pastors, such as all the Priests in
our country are after a sort reputed to be, and so named in the 9. Instruction.
Nor was the jurisdiction ever practiced in England while good Cardinal Allen
lived, but an extremity taken up only since Fa. Par. began to sit at stern,
and thereby become more bold to unmask his violent nature. Yea as M. Blackwell
now demeaneth the matter, and says he has good warrant for it, not only al
our faculties must be taken wholly away from us upon due conviction of a fault,
but the like prosecution must be made upon us without trial, without proof,
without summons, merely at the arbitrary disposition of himself, that is (as
the event has hitherto showed) when and so often as he shall imagine or be
pleased to pretend a cause.

A third instance. We could not believe (the action being without an example in
Gods Church) that his Holiness determining to make a superior over our whole
secular Clergy, would institute no greater a prelate the^ an Archpriest to
take the charge: especially if his Holiness then meant so much, as in his
later Breue is sithe^ce appointed, that he should also be a superior over the
laity, as well honorable as worshipful. And not only to govern all the
secular Priests residing within the realm, but to govern, direct, and command
us if so we do or shall reside in the kingdom of Scotland,

A scope which convinced our understanding, that the subordination was not the
appointment or decree of his Holiness, but some fine descant or politic
device plotted by father Parsons for serving some turn appertaining to state
matters. We wish it were not so, but it is too plain: for if consideration of
matters of this quality were laid aside, what reason can be given that an
Archpriest residing in England, should direct and govern his Countrey-priests
in Scotland, where also no English Priests at the time of instituting the
authority, or since is known to reside? But father Parsons harboring some
watchful bugs in his breast, and forecasting matters a far off, thought it
good wisdom to prevent the contingent, which his own fear or surmizes
suggested, and to forelay what might fall in time: verifying therein the words
of our Savior, The children of this world, are Luke 16.
wiser then the children of light in their generation.

A fourth instance. On the one side it appeared strange, that his Holiness
having set so long in the Chair as he has, and receiving aduertisements of
the miseries of our Church, could be so little weeting to the state of Priests
and lay Catholics in our country, as to think Priests might be removed from
one residence to another by authority, and not great and open danger to ensue.
And on the other side, if so his Holiness were ignorant of the laws of our
country, or did not understand the miseries and dangers we live in, what sin
could our prolonging be, of not subiecting our selves to the new authority,
till we had informed his Holiness therein, and showed how inconvenient, nay
how dangerous, or truer, how impossible it was for any such jurisdiction to be
practiced in our country, unless we did wilfully lay open, not only our
selves, but our Catholic friends to the hazards of a thousand ieopardies? Let
that point of the subordination, the terms of our realm, and the nature of
requisite circumstances be considered together, and the demonstration is made
of as much as is auerred.

We will here let pass in silence that one of the Assistants (the Jesuits
chief solicitor in forwarding this new authority at Rome) was the man, who
first suggested that clause of removing Priests from their places of residence
to be inserted in the jurisdiction of the Archpriest, alleging such a cause
for his good deed, as howsoever his discretion served to tell it, yet our
conscience, and fear of prejudice to many, especially if the faculty should
happen to be practiced as has been already threatened, will not give us leave
to recite it.

Alexander the third writing to the Archbishop of R^uenna, and pointing out the
respect and duty we should bear to the Sea Apostolic, uses these words: Aut
mandatum nostrum adimpleas, aut quare Ca. Si quando de rescript.
adimplere non possis rationabilem causam praetendas. Either regardfully
fulfill our commandment, or allege a reasonable cause why you cannot. As if
the good Pope would have said, the commandment of the Sea Apostolic, or of
any other superior ought to be carefully executed, unless there be a
reasonable cause to the contrary. Neither is this a false gloss or an
enlarging of the Popes words, being the same with the written Gloss: Mandatum
superioris debet adimpleri vel Glossaibidem.
reddenda ratio quare non adimpletur. The commandment of a superior ought to
be accomplished, or a reason rendered why it is not accomplished. And in
another place: Oportet mandatum Domini Papae Glossa in ca. cum ten^am^ur de
praebend.
adimplere, nisi subsit ratio non adimplendi. It behooves to fulfill the
commandment of the Pope, except there be a cause of not fulfilling it.

And it is likewise a received doctrine among all D. Tho. in sen. did. 15. q.
3. art. 4. ad quartum quaest. ad 3. Sil. verb. lex. nu 8 Graff. p. 1. Li. 2.
ca. 36. nu. 16.
divines, that an exception of reasonable cause excuses from sin, and is to
be admitted in all precepts soever in positive laws.

A document which our adversaries seem by the nature of their proceedings to
be little acquainted withal, in that they did so rashly and most wrongfully
condemn us, we wot not of how many enormities, without so much as suspending
their judgments, till they had heard or enquired after our reasons, or known
what we could say for justifying, or excusing our bearing off, by them so
peremptorily condemned.

O Lord, who could think, the contrary being not seen and felt, that men of
learning, men of religion, men that must be accounted of a passing mild
spirit, would censure, adiudge and diuulge that action of ours to be so
grievous a crime as they made it, being in his nature no other, then which
Popes themselves have decreed to be lawful, and millions of true obedient
children have without scruple committed?

To wade further, be it that we knew the Archpresbitership and the jurisdiction
adjoined, to be the commandment, or immediate act of his Holiness, as before
the arrival of his first Breue (the whole time of our bearing off) we n^ did,
nor could win our thoughts to suspect any such matter: what, must it by and by
put on the nature of enormious disobedience, and we wot not what else, to
defer the accomplishment of the said commandment upon manifest evidence of
untrue and most ignominious suggestion expressed in the front of the same
Letter, wherein the commandment it self was signified, and alleged also for
the chief and sole cause, why the subordination was instituted? Verily if such
auouance be thoroughly and uprightly looked into, there cannot but appear in
them matter of dishonoring the Sea Apostolic and supreme pastors, as that
having made forth their commandments, upon information cannot, or must not,
after permit that any delay be made by the subject in executing the
commandments, how wrong and detractiue soever they shall think, or know, the
information to be: then which, what is farther from reason, or can deeper
distaine?

But leaving to others to comment upon the paradoxe, we desire the adversary
that can say most in the cause, to particulate the reason, which in our duty
and love toward his Holiness, should have moved us to think that his mild
and sweet course of proceeding with all other nations, had so maruellously
changed it self toward the professant Catholics of our Realm, his
oppressed children, as to grant authority to the Archpriest to place and
displace Priests in their houses, harboring them of charity, when but an
inckling of receiving any Priest into their house is matter enough to occasion
trouble, and the proof or knowledge thereof a sufficient cause utterly to
undo the^ and their whole family. A jurisdiction therefore far more
inconvenient and hurtful, then we could any way believe his Holiness ever
appointed: nay our understanding gave us that we could not but with breach of
bounden duty think that his Holiness would ever assign such a faculty as we
for the foresaid cause and prejudice, as also for that it gives authority to
the Archpriest to dispose of the persons of secular Priests, a thing never
heard of: yea in the consequence to dispose of our lives too, in regard that
all Catholic houses, whither he may remove us, be not alike safe and free from
danger.

What shall we say? We could no way imagine that this so rare and ample
jurisdiction came from any other then from the heads of father Garnet and
fathers Parsons, as bearing the right stamp of father Parsons nature, and
sorting with other his forcible policies. For by inuesting the Archpriest
(their own at commandment) with this sovereign kind of jurisdiction, they
knew they had a mean always ready at hand, to help when they would, their
brethren the Jesuits and other their devoted friends to the best places in our
Realm, and thereby, to draw to their party such of the laity, as they would
fainest have to comply and advance their proceedings: First by removing the
Priest they keep, if he be thought an impediment thereunto, and after by
placing another Priest in his room, who must prepare and win them, in the
manner he shall be directed.

A fifth instance. It seemed most improbable unto us, that his Holiness
knowing in what deep disgrace we live with our Prince, and in what utter
contempt and scorn with the greater number of our Realm by infinite (and this
for no cause more, if for any so much, as for honoring and maintaining the
supreme dignity of that Chair) would nevertheless, add this hard favor and
increase of dishonor to our other afflictions: as that we should in no
change, have the election of our superior, but the Cardinal Protector (a
stranger, and who being a chief patron of our oppositors, has showed
himself always a back friend to our party) should without any of our voices,
or the least advice taken from us, evermore of himself appoint our Archpriest.
A greater disgust then we could persuade our selves, that his Holiness for the
compassion and respect he bears toward our miseries, would ever show,
specially to our whole Clergy.

And certes we could not reckon this so strange a prouiso, but for a cunning
devise of they two foresaid Jesuits, both to prevent that none might be chosen
to the place, but such as themselves should well like, and have the preferring
of, and by the intersession and mean of this favor bestowed, evermore to make
themselves the proprietaries and commanders of our Archpriest, and have him
ready to execute all their designs: punish, remove, disgrace, whom, when, and
how they should appoint.

In brief, the speeches that M. Blackwell himself used not long after the
receipt of the Constitutiue Letter, bred at that time an assured opinion in us,
that the authority he claimed, was not the institution of his Holiness. The
speeches were these: [That if we would accept of the subordination appointed,
and should obediently demean our selves thereunto, his Holiness intended,
after some trial of our carriage under this form of government, to make
Bishops in our Church, and to allow them as large pentions as the revenues of
Bishoprics in our country amounted to in a Catholic time.] Which words
sounding very unlikely in our ears, what could we in reason think, but that,
if the authority had been the act of his Holiness, such gross inducements
little needed: and consequently the using of them did more and more confirm
us, that the subordination was only a platform of the Jesuits, put in
execution by the Cardinal without any commandment of his Holiness, for
erecting the same in particular with the faculties adjoined.

And to make this of the more probability, there occurred three other special
presumptions, the one was certain speeches, uttered by a Senior Assistant: The
second, the devising of [ Olim dicebamur] for A letter of thanksgiving the
eighth of November 1599.
gathering of names: The third, the order of swearing Priests of the Colleges
ere they should have faculties given them for England.

Touching the first, master Terwit the second Senior Assistant very inward
with the Jesuits in most of the affairs spoke (as we were told) upon what
occasion himself better knows, that the new authority, meaning the
subordination was but to continue for a year or two, being only procured for
curbing master Mush and Collington, with a few others. Which words howsoever
we deserved them at his hands (as I for my part never saw the man in England
but once, and then, but for a dinner while only, when also there passed no
occasion to my knowledge, that might conceit him so hardly against me, but
rather the contrary) yet they could not but give us cause to doubt, and the
more we knew him to be great with Fa. Parsons and Fa. Garnet (the only
archcontriuers of the subordination) the better ground we thought we had to
believe the speeches, and his words being true, we assured our selves that the
subordination was not the act nor commandment of his Holiness: for then, it
could no way probably be in their power to let it dye in the time mentioned, as
it did easily lie in their power to let it fall at the end of that time, if the
subordination were the mere ordinance of the Cardinal his grace, he being so
near alyed in affection to father Parsons in particular, and to the whole body
of the society in general.

Touching the second. The Jesuits or our Archpriest, either, or both
aduertising father Parsons that some refused to receive the subordination, and
excepted against the Cardinal Protector his letter, as insufficient to
establish the kind of government it appointed: What did father Parsons but
presently invented (as notice was given us) this piece of sinenesse, that
forsooth his friends here, the Archpriest and the Jesuits, should frame a
letter of thanksgiving to his Holiness for instituting of the new
subordination in our Church, and procure the subscription of as many Priests
hands thereunto as they could. Whereupon a common letter was anon penned for
rendering thanks to his Holiness, in making us happy and fortunate through
the very great, wholesome The words Olim dic^^am^r.
and singular benefit which it had pleased his Pastoral care to bestow upon
us, by commanding our most Illustrious Protector Cardinal Caietane to
institute the form of government, now by him erected in our country.

To which letter (of like for the better drawing on of others to follow) the
Jesuits who were not within the lists of the subordination, did first of all
put to their names. Neither did their charity or forwardness content it self
with this, but as, if the blame should have lighted only on them, if any had
been slack or neglected the homage, they and their friends spared no labor or
persuasion of moving and soliciting others to give their names: yea the
business was so effectually prosecuted, as some were made to believe it was
sin, others told to be schism not to give their names, and all brought to
believe, that his Holiness looked to receive thanks.

Strange, that the greatest personage in the world, an old man, virtuous, holy,
humble, wise, cumbred with a thousand affairs, so as he can hardly give
audience to hear matters of weight, should look to receive thanks, and in a
letter subscribed with two or three hundredth names, and for conferring no
greater a benefit then for commanding Cardinal Caietane to institute an
Archpriest with jurisdiction only to punish (for at that time master Blackwell
had no other authority) such as were before overwhelmed in misery, and every
hour in danger of leesing their lives, for defending the divine rights of his
Papacy, and for maintaining Christ's truth, and the nobliest cause upon earth.
And with whose names must this letter be subscribed? with a Catalogue of names
of poor Priests, distressed persons, beggars, neither known, nor ever heard
of by his Holiness, and distant by more then a thousand miles from him.

But had his Holiness expected or exacted thanks at the Priests hands of our
country, yet who would think that our Archpriest and the twelve Assistants,
being our heads, and consequently the principal persons in our body, had not
been a competent and sufficient number, or at the most with six or ten other
of the ancientest Priests, to have joined in such a letter of humbling thanks
to his Holiness in their own, and in the behalf of the rest. Or admit it be
decorum to subscribe such a multitude of names in a letter to his Holiness,
and in no greater affair then to give him thanks, yet the procuring of every
Priests name mattered little, but was rather superfluous or a vanity, the rest
giving thanks in the person of all, except his Holiness should have taken
tale how many by name had thanked him.

We should marvel if father Garnet and father Parsons did not laugh in their
sleeue, notwithstanding themselves were the plotters of the device, when they
saw the oversight of our brethren, and how easily most of us were won to give
thanks for a subordination, being a staff for themselves, their deputies, and
successors, to beat us withal at their pleasure, except we did still sing
placebo, and bow down our necks to what yoke soever their enterprising
natures thought meet to lay upon us.

But howsoever they delighted themselves with this, yet if father Parsons were
made acquainted with all particulars, he could not but wish that master
Blackwell had used some better pretense for suspending three Priests from the
use of their faculties, then because they would not upon his command confirm,
his authority under their hand The words of our Archpriests letter of the 4. of
April 1599. which is set down in the book to the Inquisition.
writing, as a certain witness of their obedience, and by putting too their
names: the Priests themselves knew not to what, unless it were to [ olim
dicebamur.] A cause we dare say, that since the beginning of Christianity,
there was never Priest suspe^ded for the like. For the subject to be punished
because he will not confirm the authority of his Ecclesiastical superior
under his hand writing (an exaction of al incongruency, for what inferior can
confirm the authority of his superior, that being an office of a superior to
the superior) or put his name to a letter of thanksgiving for a new increase
of subjection, is a course so contrary to reason and justice, and so repugnant
in it self, as it can hardly admit any color, cloak or evasion.

Neither in truth do we think that the rendering of thanks to his Holiness
was the ground, and true cause indeed why so many names were gathered with like
ado: but rather that the impulsive and real cause thereof, was, for that the
Jesuits having devised the authority to subordinate (as it seems) our whole
Clergy to themselves by choosing and directing the Archpriest, got the
Cardinal Protector to erect the same by his letter, not doubting but that by
the place and power of the Cardinal, we would all swallow the hook. But
seeing themselves deceived in the conceit, they threw about with speed how they
might bear out the action, and in fine maugre the might of such as withstood
them, atchieue their desire (a desire perchance neither a little nor a short
while lo^ged after) and resolved: that a Letter of thanksgiving should be
drawn to his Holiness, and as many Priests labored, as the Arihpriest,
themselves, and their friends could prevail with, to put to their names, that
so having once gotten their names, fa. Parsons might after use them to his
Holiness and the Cardinals, for a proof and contestation of the Priests
great willingness and applause to the subordination, and that they all with
one voice entreated the confirmation thereof: when the truth was that most of
those, or rather all (a very few excepted) who gave their names, would never
have done it, but upon conceit that his Holiness had already decreed the
subordination, and did full heartily repent the folly when it was past, and
they saw the policy.

Lo, the only ground and true cause impulsive and final, and which deeds
themselves have sithence witnessed, of framing ( olim dicebamur) of gracing it
with the Jesuits names in the first rank, and of procuring the subscriptions
of Priests thereunto, with greatest expedition, importunity, and with all sorts
of postulation. Lo also one forceable motive, which then induced us to think
that the subordination was neither the commandment, nor the ordinance of his
Holiness: for then what needed the like shifts of descant or so much cunning,
or plainer, so guilefull a project and prosecution?

To come now to the other presumption of swearing of Priests, or binding them
by solemn promise to obey the Archpriest, ere they may have faculties given
them in the Colleges from whence they are sent. Which exaction or constrained
oath, we took to be most needless, had the subordination been the ordinance
of his Holiness and so known. For who can in reason or with good conscience
doubt, whether the Priests that come into England upon zeal with peril of
life, to reduce others to the obedience of the Sea Apostolic, would in
themselves as ringleaders, first abandon the same by withdrawing their bounden
obedience from any Superior, whom they should know, or probably understand to
be lawfully appointed ouerthem? So that the hearing of this exaction, did so
little stagger and appale us in our conceived opinion, as it much fortified,
and brought us in a thorough belief, that the subordination was not the act or
command of his Holiness. For if it had been, and that it could have been so
proved, (as if it had been either, it might most easily have been proved) no
doubt but wisdom, love, and charity, in the Rectors of the Colleges would
have invited specially father Parsons, both in respect he lived in Rome, when
the subordination was granted, and governed al or the chiefest Colleges,
rather to have given satisfaction and Canonical sertitude of the subordination
it self to the Priests, then through default thereof to leave them doubtful
in mind, and oblige their consciences by oath.

And when was it ever seen, that any much less Priests, the franchised
children in Gods house, should be compelled to swear obedience, before they
knew, or any legal or sufficient proof made binding them to know (as neither
was done) that the party to whom they should swear obedience was their
superior?

To shut up this our second reason, we will grant to our adversaries, that his
Holiness commanded a subordination, and enjoined the Cardinal most directly to
ordain government among us, as to our understanding the same did not appear
in any part of the Cardinals Letter and his Holiness Breue was not then extant
(for no sooner was it extant, but that we presently submitted our selves
without the least exception or repugnancy) yet the principal mark and end of
his Holiness, being to establish peace, no doubt his bessed fatherhoods will
and pleasure was, that such a subordination and form of government should be
instituted, as might avail to the making and continuance of peace. Therefore
the Archpresbytership accompanied with no benefit at all, but only with
jurisdiction to afflict us, as namely to restrain or suspend our faculties, to
take them quite away, to remove us from our places of residence, to command
what he lists, and as the authority is now practiced to suspend, from use of
al Priestly function, to interdict both Clergy and Laity, to multiply
Decrees upon Decrees, and in such manner and matter, as if we were no longer the
children of the free woman, but of the bond woman, and our state and persons
Gal. 4.
become so servile, as there remains no right in us to resist any injury,
defamation, or oppression soever.

Now if this kind of subordination bringing no commodity with it, but all
plenty of discommodities, hurts, and annoyances, be, or could be, a mean to
make peace, the motive and end of instituting the authority, or as much as
tend that way in it self, or not rather yield occasion of hafting new
quarrels, a thing quite contrary to his Holiness design in granting the
delegation to the Cardinal: not only our wits and judgments, but common
reason also, is utterly eclipsed in us. For we confess, we cannot see how by
common reason, it may appear likely to any man of judgment, that peace would
follow, or that peace could be any way effected (which the sequel has hitherto
verified) by the erecting of this subordinatio^ including the seminary Priests
only, while the total mass and life of the whole contention, was not
between the seminary Priests among themselves, or between them and the
Laity, but betwixt some of the secular Priests and the Jesuits, over whom the
Archpriest has so little jurisdiction, as the chief of the Jesuits is by a
special prouiso added to the Cardinals Letter, joined after a sort in
commission with the Archpriest, in that the Archpriest is directed by virtue of
the said Instruction, to do nothing of weight, without the priuitie and advice
of the other.

What more plain, then if two be at variance, the mean of according them by
authority, ^e is, nor can be, by having jurisdiction and command over one of
them, and none at all over the other, but by carrying authority over both, as
our Archpriest does not.

Again, what equity or justice, (the parent, Nurse, and preserver of peace,)
can any one in reason exspect, when he that is most engaged in the difference,
and a party also, is appointed Counselor and aduiser to the Judge, and the
Judge prescribed to do nothing of moment without him? Too strange a form of
Justice, as we thought, for his Holiness to be the setter down of, and so unfit
a mean to peace, as what can able and further contention most.

Touching also the composing of the dissension, pretended to be between the
secular Priests and the lay Catholics, this authority appeared in like manner
very defective in the means of taking it away, if there had been such a
difference, in regard the Cardinals Letter gives the Archpriest only
authority over the Seminary Priests, and makes not even the least mention of
any jurisdiction or power given him over the laity, as he that peruseth the
Constitutiue Letter (the true and sole lists of his whole authority) cannot
but see.

Or if any will show themselves to be of so weak judgment, (as once a
special Agent of our adversaries did, upon warrantise as he said from father
Parsons) as to auow, that the Archpriest holding authority over the Priests,
Confessors to the Laity, he holds likewise authority over their ghostly
children, it were undoubtedly a strange consequence, and which brings a new
doctrine into the world. For hereby it cannot but follow, that when a religious
man (a thing most common) is Confessor to a King, or Pope; the chief of the
house or company whereof the religious man is a member, having by the rules
and vow of religion jurisdiction over the Confessor: he has likewise
jurisdiction by this reason over the King, or Pope, to whom the said religious
man is ghostly father. But let the sequel be good, as in common reason it is
most absurd, yet even in this manner the authority is in it self far short
of effecting peace. For not all the Lay Catholics, and most probably not
such, between whom and the Priests the contention was, or was like to be, are
under the charge of the Seminary Priests, but under the guiding of the
Jesuits, and consequently no whit at all under the jurisdiction of the
Archpriest, if the former doctrine were current, that he that retains
jurisdiction over the Confessor, retains jurisdiction over his ghostly
children.

Further, these that were in this manner under the direction of the seminary
Priests, were not, neither would be, nor perhaps could be so tied to continue
with them, but that they would leave them at their pleasure, and when they
thought good. Nay it cannot be doubted but they, meeting with such an occasion,
would not fail to change their ghostly father, and go to confession to the
Jesuits for ridding themselves from all such authority of the Archpriest. An
inconvenience as none greater, and which by likelihood would in short while,
set our whole Church on fire. Wherefore the authority of the Archpriest
appearing unto us, neither available to the making of peace between the
secular Priests and the Catholic laity, if they had been at variance, as it
was suggested: neither a mean to atone the debates between the Jesuits and
the Priests, which was concealed: and his Holiness motive and intent of
commanding a subordination to be instituted, being a pious and zealous desire
of according all differences, and making perfect peace: it seemed clear unto
us, that his Holiness never meant, that this kind of subordination afflicting
only, and furthering nothing else but the increase of our miseries, should be
brought into our Church: but some other more profitable kind of regiment, that
might encourage, strengthen, and support the natural infirmities of man, in
these troubles and hot times of Catholic trial. All which considerations and
precedent profes, did more then problably assure us, that it could hide neither
offense before God or man, and less the crimes objected, to defer our
absolute submission, until such time as his Holiness should make known his
particular commandment, or ratify and approve the Cardinals act after some
authentical manner.

The third Reason.
OUR third reason was, that supposing the information had been true, and that
his Holiness had given also a plain, and direct commandment to the
Cardinal to ordain an Archpriest with like power and sovereignty over us as
is challenged, and that himself likewise had nominated M. Blackwel, and
appointed the Cardinal to choose him to the office, and further that all these
particulars had been clearly and most expressly set down in the Constitutiue
Letter, as how little any of them were, the Letter it self does best testify,
and the former reason has sufficiently showed: yet not knowing these things
otherwise to be true, but by the sole testimony of the Cardinals Letter, we
did and do still think, that we were not bound to believe, in such a general
innovation and prejudice of our Church, the like vntestified, and single
relation, without Canonical certitude of such his Holiness delegation to his
Grace, or Commission by word of mouth, or other derived authority, in what
manner, or under whar title soever.

For who can doubt, but that it is most meet and requisite, that the greater
and more strange the authority is, which is claimed, the more Canonical and
evident ought the proofs to be, by which it is claimed. To make an Archpriest
superior over the Clergy of a whole Realm, to direct, to reprehend, to
chastise, and prescribe as he lists unto them: to remove them also from their
places of reside^ce, the same being in temporal men's houses, and of alms: and
not only in this nature to command them, while they reside in the same
kingdom with him, but also to hold and exercise the same jurisdiction over
them, if so they reside in an other kingdom, governed by an other Prince, and
distant by many hundredth miles from the place of the others abode. These are so
rare novelties without example in holy Church, as no proves, but such as are
legal, can seem warrantable or sufficient enough in the case.

And because this very point which we are now entering into, is the hardest knot
in the whole controversy, and in which the principal issue most lies, we
think good for the more perspicuitie of the discourse, first to make a
division of the means, by which the Cardinal might receive authority from
his Holiness, to constitute such a subordination in our Church. And then, to
prove that his Graces Letter (whether patent or sealed, as to my remembrance it
came sealed up according to the Roman manner with a labell) was no such proof
as could either in law or conscience bind us to admit the subordination
appointed without further specialty of such his Holiness Commission unto him,
then the credence and testimony of his Graces Letter either patent or close
sealed.

Touching the first, it seems clear that his Grace received authority from
his Holiness, to constitute an Arch priest over us, either by way offormall
delegation, or by way of Commission by word of mouth. This is so evident and
manifest by the tenor of the Constitutiue Letter (if a commandment to make
peace, be a Commission to institute an Archpriest) that if our adversaries
shall gainsay it, they seem not to love truth, but rather to affect
contention.

And if his Grace received authority from his Holiness by way of formal
delegation, then his Grace not showing us the Popes rescript, or a contestified
copy thereof for testimony of the delegation, we were not bound by law or
conscience, to admit the subordination upon the sole credence of his Graces
Letter patent or close sealed.

Pope Innocentius in his decision to the Bishop of Baia registered among the
Decretals, priuiledgeth all persons not to believe another to be a delegate,
unless he first prove the Delegation: his words be these. Ca. Cum in iure de
offi. delc.
Nisi de mandato sedis Apostolicae certus extiteris, exequi non cogeris quod
mandatur. Except thou remain certain of the madate of the sea Apostolic,
thou art not bound to execute the thing commanded. But what manner of
surenesse or certainty that is, here it rests to be explaned, which is here
understood by the words ( nisi certus extiteris, except thou remain sure.) The
expositors both ancient and modern affirm, that to the making up of this kind
of surenesse, is necessarily required either the sight of the original of the
delegation, or at least a contestified copy thereof. In sua Eoclesiastica rep.
de iudice delegat. nu. 5.
Delegato non creditur dicenti se delegatum nisi id literis probet, idque
probare debet per originale, vel per exemplum ex originali solemniter sumptum.
Credence (as writes Zecchius) is not to be given to a Delegate affirming
himself a Delegate, unless he prove the same by a rescript, and he ought to
prove it by the original, or by an example taken solemnly (that is, according
Ca. pen. and vlt. d^ fide inst. and ca. Significauit and ca. Albericus de
testib.
to order and form of law) out of the original. The very same has
Panormitane touching the means of proving a Delegation. In ca. cum in iure de
offic. del. nu. 6.
Mandatum delegationis primo potest probari per orginale: secundo per exemplum
solemniter sumptum ex originali. The mandate of a delegation, may first be
proved by the original: secondly by an authenticke copy of the original. The
like do the authorities also conclude that follow. Innocentius, In ca. cum olim
^ssemus de priuil and exces. priuil. nu 4.
Delegatus no^ probat mandatum nisi literas ostendat. The delegate does not
prove his madate except he show the letters. Durandus, I. i. 2. de.

Delegatus nihil potest facere nisi ostendat literas suae delegationis. The
Delegate can do nothing unless he show the letters of his delegation. Egidius,
Decisione 7. de off. deleg.
Delegatio Papae non potest probari nisi per literas. The Popes delegation
cannot be proved but by Letters. Bouerus, Verb. delegatio. nu. 10.

praesentata, alias secu^. A Delegatio^ may be proved by witnesses after it
has been once showed by a rescript, otherwise not. Bollemera, Conclu. 110. nu.
15.
Delegatus ante receptas literas suae potestatis, non potest vti jurisdiction
sibi demandata. The Delegate cannot use the jurisdiction committed unto him
before he have received the Letters of his authority. Pope Boniface the eight.
In extrauagante iuncta de elect.. Sane.
Dicenti se delegatum sedis Apostolicae, non creditur vel intenditur nisi de
mandato Apostolico fide doceat oculata. Credence is not to be yielded or his
words to be harkned unto, who shall affirm himself a Delegate of the sea
Apostolic, unless by eyewitness he prove the Apostolical mandate. The
Gloss, In ca. cum in iure, de off. dele.
Nisi delegatus ostendat iurisdictionem suam, non est ei credendum si dicat se
delegatum. Except the Delegate does show the instrument that witnesses his
iuris^iction, he is not to be believed if he affirm himself a delegate. And
in another place, In ca. 1. de sensibus exact. li. 6. Postquam verb. in
scriptis casu. 25
Scriptura requiritur in Delegato Papae. A Letter instrument is required in the
Popes delegate for proof of the delegation.

All which authorities, and other that might be alleged make the case plain,
that neither credence is to be given to a Delegate, unless he prove the
delegation, nor that the delegation can be otherwise proved, but by showing
either the original, or an authenticke thereof, and consequently neither being
showed unto us, as our adversaries themselves will confess, we were not bound
to believe the delegation. And here we might end this member, save that
perchance our oppositors will reply and say, that we take our mark amiss, in
regard the party Delegate was a Cardinal, and therefore not tied to make
either of the two foresaid proofs, but that his Graces own word was of
authority enough to bind us obey the ordinance, without further proof of the
delegation or tenor of his Holiness grant. To which we answer.

First, that Imola and Antonius de Butrio, with sundry others of the In ca.
quod super his. de fide instrumentoru^. Ca cum in iure de offi. deleg.
best writers, affirm that the aforesaid words of the Canon ( Nisi de mandato
sedis Apostolicae certus extiteris, exequi non cogeris quod mandatur: Unless
thou be certain of the Popes mandate, thou art not bound to execute the thing
commanded) have their full force and strength, and are to be extended to the
estates and personages of Cardinals, and that they as well as other Delegates
are bound by this place of the law to prove their delegation, or no tie to
ensue. Which is also the opinion of Benedictus Vadus. In repertorio verb.
Cardinal.
Cardinalis qui asserit se delegatum, non creditur ei nisi ostendat literas. A
Cardinal auouching himself a Delegate, is not to believed unless he show the
rescript of the delegation. And it is likewise the opinion of Conradus, Li. 2.
ca. 2. de Cardinalibus. 3. nu. 22.
Non creditur Cardinali asserenti se esse delegatum nisi ostensis literis suae
delegationis. Belief is not to be given to a Cardinal, affirming Himself to
be a Delegate, except he show the letters of his delegation. Semblably to this
also writes Felinus, Ca. super his de fide instru. nu. 10.
Sicut dicenti se delegatum non creditur nisi ostensis literis, ita nec
Cardinalibus. As belief is not to be given to one auowing himself a Delegate
except he show the Commission, so likewise neither to Cardinals.

Again the same author handling this question of purpose: whether a Cardinals
word be sufficient to prove a delegation to himself, resolves no in the
Silogismes following. In ca Super his. de fide instr. nu. 12.
Credere alicui propter eius dignitatem est stare praesumptioni: sed textus in
Canone dicit (nisi de mandato sedis Apostolicae certus extiteris exequi non
cogeris quod mandatur: Ergo non sufficit iuris praesumptio. To believe another
in regard of his dignity, is to rely upon a presumption: but the text of the
Canon says (except thou remain sure of the mandate of the sea Apostolic
thou art not bound to execute what is commanded:) Therefore a presumption of
the law does not suffice. And in another place in words and sense almost
coincident. In ca. cum in iure de offi. del. nu. 7.
Vbi requiritur certitudo, non sufficit probatio presumptiua, sed credere
dignitati est adhaerere praesumptioni: ergo non satisfit isti Gloss. in l. c.
de fide instrum.
textui (nisi certus extiteris de mandato sedis Apostolicae exequi non cogeris
quod mandatur.) Where a certainty is required, a presumptiue probation is not
sufficient, but to give credit to dignity, ( that is to a Cardinal in
respect of his dignity) is to adhere to a presumption: therefore it does not
answer or satisfy this text of the law (except thou remain sure of the
mandate of the sea Apostolic thou art not bound to execute what is
commanded.)

What plainer proves can be desired, or which can more convince the authorities
being taken out of the best writers in the argument? To descend therefore to
the second member.

If the Cardinal received authority to institute the subordination by way of
commission from the mouth of his Holiness only, and not by way of delegation
in writing: yet that we were no way bound to accept of the subordination, upon
credence of the Cardinals sole letter, without further proof of such his
Holiness commission unto him, we declare and make manifest by the authorities
following.

Panormitane In ca. sicut nobis de sententia excommu. nu. 5.
Non creditur Cardinali asserenti aliquid in praeiudicium alterius, and ideo si
Cardinalis dicat Papam sibi commisisse aliquid viuae vocis oraculo, tendens in
praeiudicium alterius, non crederetur sibi nisi aliter probaret. Belief is not
to be given to the word of a Cardinal if he affirm any thing to the prejudice
of another; and therefore if a Cardinal say that the Pope has committed such
or such a thing unto him by word of mouth tending to the prejudice of another,
he should not be believed, except he otherwise prove what he affirms.
Filinus In eodem ca.
Non creditur etiam Cardinali quando agitur de praeiudicio tertij. Et hoc est
adeo verun^ quod Papa non potest facere de potestate ordinaria quod credatur
vni soli in praeiudicium alterius. Belief is not to be given even to the word
of a Cardinal, when a third person is to receive damage thereby And this is so
undoubtedly true, as the Pope cannot appoint by his ordinary power, that credit
should be given to one only in prejudice of another. Decius In ca. causam quae
de off. deleg. nu. 25.
Non creditur etiam Cardinali vbi tractatur de praeiudicio alterius. One ought
not to believe, no not a Cardinal wherein the prejudice of another is treated.
The Doctors of the Rota In decisio 33. de probationib in anti. nu. 1.
Non creditur assertioni Cardinalis nisi circa iurisdictionem eius. The
assertion of a Cardinal is not to be believed, but in matter belonging to
jurisdiction, rising out of his office and not in other. The additions upon the
chapter, quod super de fide instrumentorum in Panormitane Sub. nu. 5. lit. ^.
dicto Cardinalis in hijs quae concernunt alterius praeiudiciu^ non creditur.
Belief is not to be given to the word of a Cardinal in matters that concern
the prejudice of another. Which Position the foresaid writers prove by several
Ca licet. 2. de testibus and 3 q. 9. ca. iudices.
passages of the Canon law, specially by this that follows Ca. cum a nobis de
testibus.
Canonica and Ciuilia iura sequentes districtius inhibemus ne vnius iudicis
quantaecunque fuerit authoritatis verbo credatur in causis sieve super
testamentis, sieve quibuslibet alijs contractibus quaestio agitetur, salua in
omnibus sedis Apostolicae authoritate. Following the Canon and Civil laws we
very strictly inhibite that credit be given to the word of one Judge of how
great authority soever he be in causes whether the question be made upon
testaments, or upon other contracts whatsoever, the authority of the Sea
Apostolic reserved in all things. Neither is this only an ordinance of the
Canon law, Civil, and National, but a Decree beside of nature her self in
cases of moment, as witnesses S. Thomas and his Expositors. 2. 2. q. 80. art.
2.


Nevertheless because the Canonists write in the outer show diversely in this
point, some that belief is to be given to the assertion of a Cardinal: other
that belief is not to be given: they, meaning in matters not prejudicial:
these in matters that bring detriment with them: and in these matters also
which bring detriment with the^, some write that a Cardinal his auowance is to
be believed, some other the contrary that it is not, the former authors
understanding in matters of small or indirect damage, the latter in matters of
great and direct prejudice. Therefore to the end that no exceptions be taken,
nor place left to counterplead, we think good to annexe the words of Nauar,
who as he carried a most singular account over all Christendom for learning and
sound judgment in his faculty, so does he open this difficulty and discusseth
it far more distinctly then any other, and reconcileth the authors in the
differences aforesaid. His words be these. Credendum est Cardinali etiam in
preiudicium tertij tribus concurrentibus. Lib. 3. consil. de testament. co^s.
11. ^u. 8. and. 9.
Primum quod testetur de commissis a Papa sibi aut alijs per eum deferrendis.
Secundu^ quod sint solita concedi. Tertium quod non vergant direct in
praeiudicium aliorum, sed tantum indirecte and per quandam consequentiam. A
Cardinal is not to be believed yea to the prejudice of a third, three things
co^curring. First that the testimony he gives be of things committed by the
Pope unto them. The second that his testimony be of such things as are usually
or wont to be granted. The third, that the things do not redound directly to
the prejudice of others, but only indirectly and by a certain sequel or
implication.

Of which three specified conditions, all and every one of them being
requisite, the first only is to be found in our case, and neither the second
nor third. Not the second, because the subordination which the Cardinal by his
Letter Constitutiue erected, is not a customarie kind of subordination, or
which is usually granted, but rather an authority whose like in all
circumstances was never granted, as is manifest by that which has been
rehearsed in the second reason. And the third falls in as little with our
case, because living by the use of our faculties, it cannot be, but a very
great, direct, and immediate prejudice to be deprived of them, merely at the
arbitrary pleasure of another, without iuridicall proof or lawful conviction
of any condign or proportionable demerit. Which prejudice appears also by so
much the greater or more infinite, as the retaining and use of our faculties,
are the ablest, if not the sole means both of gaining and releeuing souls,
the end why we took Priesthood upon us, a profession in so great dislike and
persecution with the state.

Again, what more apparent prejudice either to Priests or to the Catholic
laity, then that authority should be given (the straight condition of the laws
of our Realm considered) to change and remove Priests from one residence to
another, we being endued with no Church living, nor the lay Catholics bound by
as much as the least show of charity, to maintain any one in their houses, but
such as themselves shall choose or cast affection unto, in regard they must
venture therein the utter loosing of all their goods, life, state, and the
overthrow of their whole posterity. And neither must they make this venture for
a week, two, or three, but must set down their dwelling in the hazards of the
casualty, so long as they entertain the Priest, and ever after during their
lives, and the laws of the present state.

Moreover can a separation be made by authority of the Postour from the flock:
of the Guide from the charge: of the Priest resiant from his acquaintance and
place of abode, and no speeches to grow and be spread thereof? Most improbable.
And not much less unlikely is it, but that the walking up and down of such
speeches in many men's mouths, will quickly lay open the state of such
Catholics from whom they are, and to whom they shall be in such sort removed,
to danger, havoc, and ruin.

Another prejudice, and which does not so much directly follow upon the
subordination, as it is intrinsecall and incorporate thereunto, the prejudice
being expressly and by special prouiso enacted in the Constitutiue Letter
itself; to weete, that the nomination and choosing of the Archpriest, should
not appertain (notwithstanding the large jurisdiction and command he carries
over all) either to the company of the twelve Assistants, or to the whole body
of Priests within our Realm, who are to obey and live under his rules, but
that in every change of the Archpriest, either by death, apprehension, leaving
the Realm, or other accident, the successor is to be assigned by the
Cardinals Grace only, a forrainer to our nation, aparted by many hundredth of
miles from us, a stranger to our affairs, and neither acquainted with all the
sorts of our pressures, nor with their measure and quality. Which prouiso
seemed also the more straight and prejudicial unto us, in respect the Cardinal
Protector was like to receive no other information, to direct his honor in the
election of the next Archpriest, but that which father Garnet and father
Parsons the authors of all our troubles, and the master parties of the one
side of the difference, should then again suggest, and rule all in the second,
third, and every change, as they did in the election of M. Blackwell, and
consequently our poor clergy never lack matter of disturbance, unless we
accommodate and prostrate our selves to father Parsons humor and the direction
of the Jesuits in all things.

And here we cannot but wish to God that father Parsons policy and the
seeking of himself, would once at length redound more then it does, to the
good of our Church and Country: we mean his cunning policy in preventing
that none of our nation come to preferment or credit in the Court of Rome, or
have means to inform his Holiness of the true state of matters, but that
himself must be the sole agent and informer, or some such his creatures as
shall not fail to second his driftes, and run in one and his own current
with him.

We hope none of judgment, and acquainted with the ouer-ruling humor that
reigns in some persons, but will soon affirm the precedent inhibition of
debarring us the choice of our own Superior, being so many as we are in
number, to be no little or light prejudice, specially if he maturely consider
of the reasons that S. Leo the great, gives in a case not unlike to ours. Vt
nullus inuitis and non p^tentibus ordinetur, ne plebs inuita Episcopum non
optatum aut contemnat, aut oderit, and fiat minus religiosa quam conuenit, cui
non licuerit habere quem voluit. That no one be ordained over others, who^ to
have they are unwilling or not desirous, lest the people so constrained either
contemn or hate the Bishop whom they wished not to have, and thereby become
less religious the^ is meet, in not being licenced to enjoy whom they desired.

Neither can we name or report this bar, less then a prejudice unto us,
because holy Church her self governed by the wisdom of heaven, has ordained
that every Ecclesiastical congregation and College of Priests should have the
choosing of their own Prelate: yea Ca. 1. de electione, and glos. ibid.
and that the Prelate not after this wise chosen, may be lawfully refused as
one promoted contrary to the discipline of Canonical order. Hard, that we
being so many in number as we are, and the whole Clergy of a Realm, and
neither living all vncollegially through our own default, but by the
necessity of the time, should thus, both first and last, and in every change,
be deprived of having the election of our Prelate.

At the first, whiles we lived without a Superior, it might perhaps seem no
great disfavor to have a Superior appointed unto us without our assent, or
priuitie, or voice, or advice in the election: but now when we appear in a
sort collegiated, by living all in obedience under one Superior, and under a
received and set form of government, to have the same measure and disfavor
nevertheless continued, yea to have the continuance thereof expressly and by
particular caution enacted, it cannot but be deemed a prejudice by any upright
judgment, and a much higher disgrace and impeachment to our whole Church, then
(as we hope) our long travails, the burden of our poverty, the weight of our
other pressures, the daily venturing of our lives for the gain of souls, the
store of blood we have that way yielded, the fruit which has come thereof, and
our maintaining the rights of the Roman sea, either have, or by Gods grace
with our wittingnes ever shall deserve of Peter's Chair, or at the hands of his
Holiness.

Now if our adversaries can answer and show wherein we are mistaken, or how
the precedent reasons or authorities conclude not for us, whether the Cardinal
received his authority by way of formal delegation, or by way of verbal
commission: we beseech them of charity to communicate their knowledge, and we
promise them, they shall find us thankful, and most ready to recant our
error and ask them pardon.

And this being proved, that we were not bound by law or conscience (for that
cannot be against conscience in which so many approved authors do agree to be
lawful) to subject our selves to the subordination his Grace erected upon the
sole credence of his Letter without further testimony that his Holiness gave
him Commission to institute the same in specie, with all the branches and
faculties: it rests for cleerer remonstrance of the truth and satisfaction of
al doubts, that we answer the reasons which our adversaries make for proof
that we were bound to believe and obey the Cardinal Protector his Letter,
before the appearing of his Holiness Breue in Confirmation thereof.

ONe of the chief reasons that our adversaries bring for proof of M.
Blackwell in his 12. questions to the Priests, 14. of March 1600. Fa. Holtbey
in his discourse the last of lune 1601. and in the Apology fol. 108. Destatu
Ill. DD. Card. nu. 9.
such our bounden duty is, that his Grace was Lord Protector of our Nation,
and the distributer of faculties to Priests in their mission from Rome for
England.

To which we answer: first, of the two dignities Cardinalship and
Protectorship abstracted and considered apart each from other, no doubt the
title of Cardinalship is the greater, and by so much, that hardly there is any
resemblance to be made between them, as is to be seen by comparing the
prerogatives together, recounted and laid down by Zecchius in his book de
repub. ecclesiastica. And therefore if we were not bound, (as is abundantly
proved before we were not) to believe a Cardinals word in a matter of like
prejudice, much less were we then bound to give credence to the word of a
Protector in the same.

But be it for further proofe-sake, and declaration of more our advantages, that
the office of a Protector does in right challenge more belief, then does the
state of a Cardinal, and that the two sovereign dignities and offices meeting
and residing in one personage, as they did in Cardinal Caietane, could not but
impose a straighter bond by much upon us to believe and obey the particulars of
his Graces Letter subscribed and signed with his own hand and seal, then could
the like Letter of any other Cardinal, who was not our Protector, nor had the
distribution of faculties in the missions.

To this we say, that the authority of our Protector thus compounded and
enlarged, remains nevertheless a definite authority, and falls under the
name of authority: but the text of the law above cited is, Ca. cum a nobis de
testib.
Quantaecunque authoritatis, etc. How great authority soever the affirmer is
of, he is not in things hurtful to another to be believed upon the sole
testimony of his own word. And Inca. praeterea de dilat. n. 5
Panormitane cited by Verb delegatus nu. 5.
Syluester writes, that quantumcunque est persona authorizabilis, what high
and ample authority soever the person bears, he is not in praeiudicialibus
in matters of prejudice, to have belief built upon the credence of his own
word only. What need more proves? It is very manifest by the unanswerable
authority of the text it self above cited, salua in omnibus sedis Apostolicae
authoritate, that the privilege of being Ca cum a nobis de testib.
believed upon the sole warrantize of his own word in cases of prejudice, is a
respect peculiarly reserved and appropriated to the supreme dignity of the Sea
Apostolic.

Or if on the other side, our oppone^ts will, as a principal man among them did
once boldly affirm, that the Cardinal did not so much institute this kind of
subordination in our Church by virtue of any delegation received of his
Holiness, as he did it by virtue and office of his Proterctorship. A conceit
that M. Blackwell himself in some of his To my self the 8. of August, and to
M. D. Bishop, and my self the 17 of Aug. 1598.
Letters, which he wrote incontinent after the receipt of the Constitutiue
Letter, seems to beat about, if not to infer, calling the subordination,
Statuta, constitutionem, institutionem, ordinem, prudentissimam prouisionem
Illmi Domini Protectoris. The statutes the constitution, the institutions, the
order, the right prudent provision of our most illustruous Protector.

Now if our adversaries beaten from their other holds, will retire (as some of
them have, to the succor of this poor shift) alas the fortress they fly too
is but a paper wall, a descant fit only to deceive the ignorant. For the
office of a Protector consisting (as Zecchius relates) Destat. Illarum D^rum
Cardin. nu. 9.
in proposing the elections and other causes of the Province, or Country,
whereof the party is Protector in the sacred consistory: and in answering the
reasons, doubts, or exceptions, which the Pope, or any of the Cardinals shall
there move, touching matters by him propounded, neither did nor could impart
like jurisdiction and sovereignty to his Grace, as thereby to institute of
himself any kind of government, and much less so strange a kind of
government in our whole Church. For why, is there any kind of semblance or
society, any alliance or conjunction between authority to propose elections,
to prefer the suits of our Country, to yield satisfaction to what is objected
in that most honorable assembly of the Pope and Cardinals (the offices of a
Protector) and the jurisdiction of erecting a subordination, the like whereof in
all points was never heard of in our Church before, if ever any where else in
the Church of God? The sequence is so incongruent, that none of judgment will
make it, and none but such as are wedded to their own folly, will ever stand
therein, carrying no more coherence then that chalk being white, must needs
without doubt be cheese, or because the advocate moves and pleads his
clients cause, therefore without question he has authority to determine and
give final sentence in the same.

Touching the other part or member of the reason, that we are bound to admit
what Cardinal Caietane assigned, in respect his Grace had the distribution of
faculties to our Priests that come from thence, we think no answer fitter
then silence, in respect it bewrays so great shallowness and defect of
judgment. For if we were in this regard bound to believe the Cardinal on his
word, because he had authority to delegate faculties, it follows directly,
that we are in like sort bound to believe the President of Doway, the Rectour
of the College at Valedolid, father Parsons and so many of the Jesuits as have
authority to give faculties, upon credence of their own word: yea the ground
and respects being one, we are likewise bound if the former reason be good, to
believe our Archpriest and his successors, of what bad quality soever they
happen to be, upon testimony of their own word, because authority to
delegate faculties, is now annexed to the office: and so any of this number may
at his pleasute, by borrowing leave of his conscience, innouate, set up, pull
down, chop and change what he lists in our Church, by saying only he had a
commandment from his Holiness without showing script or scrowle, or other
assurance for proof thereof, then his bare word, and we bound forsooth under
crimes of greatest infamy, to admit the same and subject our selves: the^
which, what greater folly, what fouler distain to the dignity of our
Priesthood, or what in his nature or consequence lays open a wider gap, to
let in intrusion, confusion, and all utter havoc both of order and
discipline, in the house and Sanctuary of Almighty God, and spouse of our
Savior?

ANother reason which our adversaries use for confirming their Position against
us, is the variety of the testimonies they showed unto us besides the
Constitutiue Letter, for proof that the subordination was erected by his
Holiness priuitie and command: namely a second Letter of Cardinal Caietanes,
signifying that his Lordship received a charge from his Holiness to institute
the subordination he did: a Letter of the Popes Nuntio in Flunders: a Letter of
Doctor Stapletons, on other of Doctor Barrets, an other of father
Bellarmines, since Cardinal: an other of Doctor Worthingtons: and two other,
from our two brethren which went to Rome in the affair, all attestating (as
our adversaries are pleased to report) the subordination to be the
commandment of his Holiness.

A fair show, to carry away the vulgar and credulous, but of too light
substance by much, to persuade any of judgment, who have but looked upon the
Canons of holy Church, were all true that is said, as when the particulars come
to scanning, we trust neither all, nor the most part will so fall out.

And first it is clear by the authority above rehearsed out of Innocetius,
Panormitane, Speculator, Felinus, Egidius, Bellemera, Bouerus, Zecchius,
Conradus, the very choice of both the ancient and modern Canonists, that all
Papal delegation especially communicating jurisdiction in penal matters, must
of necessity, ere any be bound to obey, be first proved either by showing the
rescript of the delegation, or an authentical copy thereof. Neither can such
a delegation, justly according to the form of the law be proved by record of
witnesses, save when as Bouerus notes, the original has been showed before,
as the Verb delegatio. 7. nu. 10.
original of this delegation (if so the Cardinal his grace received
authority from his Holiness by way of formal delegation) was never, if ever
extant to be showed. Which saying also of Bouerus is not generally to be
understood in all kinds of Delegation, but in such only, as do not derive a
plurality of particular jurisdictions, the contrary whereof the new
subordination does, containing at least ten several jurisdictions, and as many
more instructions. For in delegations of this sort, proof is to be made by
showing of the original, or an authentike copy thereof, and not by the sole
record of witnesses, as after the allegation of In prohemio super, Clement.
Barbatia, the Doctors of the Rota, have Decisione quae incipit, Quod licet
Romana curia.
in plain terms decided, and who also quoteth these words of Baldus for
ampler proof of the assertion. Gratia Papaefacta super jurisdiction non
potest probari per testes. The grace that the Pope gives communicating
jurisdiction, cannot be proved by witnesses.

And the reason is plain and invincible: for where many particulars (c) In ca.
1. de allodijs col. 3. in tit.
are delegated, and those vndepending one of other, as in the new authority,
there the volubilitie of humane memory, and the strict necessity of neither
adding nor detracting considered with other circumstances: namely, that words
may often bear diverse senses, and do take their limitation and truest
exposition from that which went before or followed after in the same
Commission, there we say where these thing meet, the proof of the delegation,
cannot without suspicion of error be made by report of witnesses, but ought
only to be made by showing the original, or a testified copy, as the
authors before cited do write.

Which reason also seems as strongly to conclude that the faculties and
jurisdiction given to the Archpriest, and particularized partly in the
Constitutiue Letter, partly in the instructions, and partly in the additions,
being many in number, and distinct without dependence each of other, cannot
well for the same cause and fickleness of memory, be proved by witnesses, but
rather require for due proof the showing and comparing of an authenticke note,
or abstract of the things in particular, which were granted to the Archpriest
or Cardinal by his Holiness, which hitherto we never saw, nor heard tell of,
nor, which perhaps was ever extant, notwithstanding the just necessity
thereof. Nevertheless we will yield to our adversaries, to the end to make our
justification the cleerer, and the less impugnable, that the like delegation
or commission may be proved by witnesses, though the original, nor any
authenticke copy were ever showed before. Which was never affirmed by any
writer, or ever practiced (as we think) no not where oppression and bondage
reigned most.

Yet here we trust that yielding thus much voluntarily, our adversaries will not
(an inch so freely and friendly being given them) take by and by an^ell, and
think it enough to prove the delegation or commission in general, and not
also to prove the tenor in particular. For if this large scope were once in
ure and admitted, the next may be to bid all order farewell, as wherein
discipline is rifled, tyranny set free, the practice of holy Church turned
vpside down, and the arayes of all Christian peace and quietness utterly
broken: in regard it follows hereby, that whosoever can prove a delegation
or commission, may forthwith incroch and challenge thereupon to order all
matters, either out or in his commission, as he lists, without restraint,
limit, check, or gainestanding of any, as having by the former scope
authority for his warrant: which is so very absurd, that he scarcely deserves
the name of a man, and less the praise of scholership, who shall show himself
so very a babe as once to affirm it.

And now here we demand, who in the ranks of the foresaid witnesses (which are
yet all that our adversaries themselves claim witness of) does in his record
descend to the specifying of any one particular contained in the commission?
Let the testimonies be reuiewed and compared with the Constitutiue Letter, and
we are content to make the adversary, who is most against us, our Judge in the
case. For to begin with the first and take them all in order: The second letter
of Cardinal Caietane, which is set down verbatim in the beginning of Angles.
p. 2. in 4 q. de rest. leg. paenal. diff. 1. con. 1.
the book (were it not contrary to the natural form of justice observed
among all nations, be they Christians, Jews, or Pagans, for any one in the
exterior Court to bear witness in his own cause) neither auerreth nor
specifieth any one particular of his Holiness commission unto him, other then
the commission it self in general terms, as all men may be their own
informers that will read the Letter.

Moreover there be certain clauses or points interlaced in the said Letter,
which did so little inuit us to believe the residue therein mentioned, or what
his Grace had written before in the Constitutiue Letter, as they most mightily,
more then ever before, caused us to doubt of the process. For some part of the
contents courteously finds fault with master Blackwell, for that he had not
written to Rome of our manners or actions in so long while, and rendering his
excuse, lays it in his modesty and charity, in that he would not be easily
moved to accuse his brethren: a property wherein one of his greatest facilities
did, and does consist, as we then knew, and have sithence more abundantly felt:
nor can himself deny this much, and father Parsons letter to master Doctor
Bishop of the ninth of October 1599. and the late Apology do verify it
apparently.

Another piece of the letter imposes a commandment or two upon our
Archpriest, both to certify the names, manners, and actions of the tumultuous,
and the causes which they pretend of their reluctation, for so the letter
terms us, and the justifiable demand we made for Canonical proof of his
Holiness commission, ere we did absolutely engage and subject our selves
thereunto. Injunctions which certes we could not believe nor suspect to proceed
from order of his Holiness, notwithstanding so much was expressly signified in
the letter. [ Nunc tamen Smo id postulante, vt informatio debita de omnibus
habeatur faciendum tibi erit omnino. Yet now his Holiness commanding the same
that due information be given of all, you must needs do it.]

The reasons why we could not believe or suspect thus much, were: first because
his Holiness was at Ferrara three hundredth miles, or thereabout from Rome at
the time when the Cardinals letter was written: for his graces letter bore date
from Rome the tenth of November 1598. and his Holiness married the King of
Spain and the Duke of Burgundy at Ferrara on the 12. of the same month, two
days after the date. Again, his Holiness for a good while before had not
been in Rome, being in his journey toward Ferrara, nor was the Cardinal one
of his attendants in the journey. And to think that aduertisements of like
quality, and small moment, as this business of ours was, passed this while
too, and fro, between his Holiness, and the Cardinal, were a very improbable
conceit, considering the continual travel of his Holiness, and the hourly
access of all sorts of people unto him, and for that his Holiness intended
ere long to return to Rome, where the Cardinal might have personal
conference with him about the affair, and in time convenient enough, the
matter being but only to inquire how a few poor Priests have lived, and to
understand from their adversaries the causes they pretend, in dislike of a
government already in being.

And albeit these were the respects which inclined us to doubt whether his
Holiness enjoined any such commandment as the letter specified, yet that
which indeed far more settled the doubt in our thoughts, was the partiality or
injustice, in that our adversaries, and those that made a chief party, and
were most interessed in the controversy, should have the certifying of what we
could say either in clearing of our selves, or against them, and so have the
telling of both tales, theirs, and ours. Beside, it seemed strange that we
being defamed but of one crime (if it be a defamation and a crime to do as the
Ca. si quando de potest. iudicis deleg.
laws of holy Church license and direct when doubt is made either of the
commission, or of the specialties therein contained) we must have our manners
or actions without any specification of, or in that particular ransacked, and
laid open to the world. The first kind of partiality or injustice not
tolerated among the Heathens, and the later (if by our manners and actions the
course of our life be meant, as the exception taken against the negotiators and
other our brethren do verify) as contrary as what may be most contrary to the
express Canons of the Sea Apostolic. Inquisitio fieri debet solummodo super
illis Ca. inquisitionis de accusat. ad haec and ca. qualiter el. 2. eodem.
( criminibus) de quibus clamores aliqui praecesserunt. Inquisition ought only
to be made concerning those crimes of which some clamorours reports have gone
before.

That master Blackwell was willed to make inquisition of our manners or
actions by way of authority, and consequently by way of inquisition, the words
of the said letter do attestate. For the Cardinal having before signified the
Popes commandment to master Blackwell, that he should not fail but send
notice of our names* manners, or actions, his grace immediately adds: Quod vt
facilius citiusque ex nostrae ordinationis authoritate perficias, hoc tibi
caeterisque Presbyteris iniungimus vt statim ac diligenter fiat. The which
thing, that you may by the authority of our ordination perform with the more
ease and speed, this we enjoin you and the rest of the Priests, that it be
forthwith and diligently accomplished.

But the most we would infer of the premises is, that these things being part
of the contents of the Letter, and sounding so hardly both against the common
form of justice, and the decrees of Gods Church, we could not imagine, either
the same to be written by any order received from his Holiness, or written at
all by the Cardinal, but we took the letter for an extrauagant of father
Parsons, subscribed by the Cardinal without perusing it before, only upon
confidence of father Parsons judgment and sincerity in managing the affair he
had begun. Nevertheless we can but muse, why father Parsons would have other
men's lives and actions informed, when if his own life and disposition were
unripped, they would perchance bring as little edification to the world, as the
life and transgressions of some other. But the old saying is, Non videmus
manticae quod in tergo est, we do not see the part of the wallet that hangs
behind, where, father Parsons of likelihood (as this his forwardness should
show) has bundled up the frailties of his own life, and there keeps them
without looking on them, and thereby comes to have leisure and appetite to
gaze upon the life and cariages of some of the secular. But to proceed in
examining the rest of the testimonies.

Secondly his Holiness Nuncio in Flaunders in his Letter to master Blackwell,
and which our adversaries allege as a testimony against us, made no mention at
all of the tenor of the commission, nor of any particular that should be
contained therein. Our adversaries themselves will not deny this, or if they
do, we must say there is no truth in their words. The whole that his Lordships
letter can be drawn to make against us, or to testify for them, was in that
his honor writing to M. Blackwell, wrote unto him by the name and title of
Archpriest: which also happened (as we think) through this occasion. After
father Parsons had won the Cardinal to solicit and erect a subordination in
our Church, the like as himself thought fittest, he sent a copy of the
Constitutiue Letter to the Nuncio in Flaunders, and to others there to read.
Whereupon the Nuncio seeing master Blackwell to be constituted Archpriest by
the Cardinal, gave him also that title. And what is this for proof of the
commission, specially for proof of the tenor, the thing which is to be
witnessed (as is declared before) or else what is witnessed to be little worth?

Thirdly touching the testimony of D. Stapleton, the most and all that he wrote
to the Nuncio concerning the authority of master Blackwell, and which our
adversaries lay hold on for reckord against us, was, that his Holiness had
made him Archpriest. Which thing also he did neither write by way of
affirmance, or to testify so much, but only accidentally by occasion of
another matter, to weete, what he thought fittest to be done about master
Tempest. For at that time the Nuncio had sent M. Tempest unto him with his
accusers to be examined in the points, for which the Cardinal Protector had
taken away his faculties, while he was in the way downwards from Rome, and
given likewise order to the Nuncio, that he should be stayed in the
Lowcountries, and not suffered to go into England.

Now when Doctor Worthington and master Caesar Clement his accusers, had
charged him before Doctor Stapleto^ with as many things, as they thought good,
or as their instructions from father Parsons directed, and he had made his
answer and purgation thereunto: Doctor Stapleton aduertising the Nuncio by
letter, how the matter passed before him, and withal giving his honor to
understand, what he thought meetest to be done in the cause, wrote: that
master Tempest might well be dismissed and suffered to depart into England, and
as he should there demean himself, so to receive again his faculties of the
Archpriest, whom his Holiness had constituted superior in England. By all
which, being the whole sum of that Doctor Sapleton wrote to the Nuncio, what
more may be gathered, then that Doctor Worthington and master Caesar Clement,
relating the contents of the Constitutiue Letter, or showing a copy thereof
unto him, which at that very season was newly come to Bruxels, and made common
to many, the other incidently thereupon inserted in his foresaid Letter to the
Nuncio the words above mentioned. Which in no sense can justly be reckened a
testimony, the writer by evidence of all circumstances thinking nothing less
in using the words, then as a witness to testify the commission, or that the
subordination was the ordinance of his Holiness by what he did say.

But whatsoever Doctor Stapletons intention was therein, either to witness or
not to witness the subordination, as it could not be to witness it,
understanding the same but by report: yet our adversaries themselves will not
say, that the good man did particularize or testify the tenor of the
commission, or any one jurisdiction contained therein. Or had he rehearsed in
his letter some more or few particulars of the commission, as he did not, yet we
desire to know, what reason or fatisfaction can be yielded, why he might not as
well have erred in relating the tenor (and consequently neither bond, nor
wisdom in us to believe his words) as he did in saying that M. Tempest upon
desert of his good carriage in England, might have his faculties restored unto
him by the Archpriest, when M. Blackwell at that time had no authority at all
(as himself both confessed and practiced) either to restore him, or give
faculties unto any other upon what necessity soever.

We will not stay here to ask the cause, why D. Stapletons letter addressed to
the Nuncio upon the aforesaid business, was brought over with other like into
England, and here showed for testimonies. But although we will not stand to
demand the reason hereof, yet we cannot but give all men to know that our
suspicion, doubts, and mistrust of the validity of the new authority, were no
whit lesned thereby, but very much increased, seeing what mean proves were
mustered, and as it were marshalled in the forefront of the army of proves
against us.

Fourthly, concerning the testimony of M. D. Barret, there was yet much less
cause why he should be brought for witness, unless the necessity be such,
that any thing must serve that can make the least show of sounding against us,
we never saw or heard but of two letters that he should write, the one to the
Popes Nuncio in Flaunders concerning matters belonging to Master Tempest, the
other to master Blackwell himself. In either of which, no other testimony was
given, then that he named master Blackwell Archpriest, and wished that those
effects might follow upon the authority, which the author in the institution
of the authority intended, without naming who he was. And what we pray could
this possibly make to the proof of that which was then in question, and which
we stood upon to know after an assured and requisite manner, viz. whether the
Cardinal received a commandment from his Holiness to erect such a
subordination with like jurisdiction in all points over us. Well, it must
needs argue a rich wardrope, and good proves no doubt to lie in store, where
such poor stuff is brought forth for show.

Fifthly, touching the testimony of father Bellarmine, (of whose letter our
impugners seem not to make the least account) first we say that to this day
there be very few of our company who ever saw the letter: and for certain,
neither of these two, whom Master Blackwell calls the Princes in the action
(and has sorest punished for defending their own and their brethrens good
names against the slanders imposed) ever cast eye thereon, or the same ever
sent by any or offered unto them to read, till after the arrival of his
Holiness Breue, and our absolute admittance of the authority. And therefore
whatsoever testimony it carried, it could little condemn or blame those, that
knew no more thereof. But what might the contents be of the letter, or to whom
was the same written, and to what purpose?

The letter was written to father Parsons, in answer of a letter of his, and
to do him to understand, that the two English Priests, of whom he wrote unto
him, were not as then come to Ferrara, and that his Holiness was much incensed
upon news of their intention of coming, and determined to imprison them.
Again, that father Parsons needed not to come to Ferrara about that business,
in respect his Holiness intended to make no long stay there, and that if in
the mean, the two Priests happened to come, he assured that their audience
should be put off, till his Holiness came to Rome.

This for so much as our memory serves, was the contents of the letter. And
now what proof of the tenor or any particular of the commission is there
named in all this, no word, or syllable so much as pointing thereunto?
Nevertheless we will not gainsay if father Bellarmine wrote such a letter, but
that the displeasure which his Holiness is said to take for their coming (if
so the cause of his displeasure was their coming and not rather wrong and
sinister information) may in some sort not amiss argue that his Holiness was
privy to the erecting of the subordination, but it can no way argue that this
or this was the tenor of the commission, or these the particulars of the
jurisdiction given. A point much more important to be testified, then the
commission in general, ere any be bound to render their particular obedience.
For being in possession of our particular freedoms, no reason to render them
up by constraint (as every bond brings a constraint) into the hands of
another, before he has sufficiently and according to law in that matter proved
his right thereunto, as was showed at large in the eleventh Proposition. And
the same appears also plain by this place in the Decretals: Antequam
exprimantur res, delegatus nequit iurisdictionem exercere. Before the things be
expressed C. 1. Pastoralis d^ rescript in fi^e.
( wherein the Delegate has authority) the Delegate cannot exercise
jurisdiction: and consequently none bound to obey in the same. And what in this
respect is true in Delegations, holds also in commissions by word of mouth.

We omit to lay down the reasons we had of not giving over light credit to
what was auerred in the Letter, if so it had been showed unto us before the
coming over of his Holiness Breue, and our acceptance of the authority. The
style sauoured little or nothing at all of the temper and mildness wherewith
the good religious father was known to abound: Then the Letter was taken not
to be of his hand writing: and sithence it has been acknowledged that it was
but a copy, and not the original it self. Again the contents greatly
derogated from the native and sweet disposition of his Holiness, as in like
measure and without knowing the cause, to be offended with any, for repairing
unto him, and much less with Priests coming from a Realm so far off, and
so well deserving of holy Church, and in the general cause of many. Lastly the
Letter passed through the hands of father Parsons, and some other unto us, whom
we accounted of no such integrity, but that circumstances considered, we might
in wisdom mistrust least something therein might be added or altered, for
making the famous Clarke to speak harder against us.

Fifthly touching the testimony of Doctor Worthington: none of us know, or
were ever told to this day, what he either said or wrote in witness of the
authority or tenor thereof, or in commendation of our delay. Nevertheless
let his record be what it can be, we hope by Gods grace (when one opponents or
himself shall acquaint us therewith) to be able so to answer it, as that it
shall neither convict us of the crimes objected, nor of any other faulty
transgression.

Lastly concerning the testmonie of our two brethren the negociators of the
affair: we marvel why either The 14. of March, 1600.
our Archpriest in his twelve proposed questions, or The last of June 1601.
father Holtby in his discourse, should so earnestly object their joint
testimony against us, when the first Letter of all that we received from M.
Charnocke, came to our hands together with the Breue, at which time we
presently yielded our obedience.

We do not deny but that M. Bishop in his Letter of the 22. of February 1599.
according to the Roman account, which was delivered unto us some seventeen or
eighteen days before the receipt of the Breue, made mention that M. Charnocke
had written unto us at the same time, but we did not receive his Lettter,
before the coming of the Breue, as our Archpriest, father Garnet and some
other can witness, if they please to remember themselves. So that what
testimony soever M Charnock gave in the said Letter, it makes little against
us, because we absolutely admitted the subordination, and subjected our selves
so soon as ever we saw his Holiness Breue, before the reading of M. Charnockes
Letter, as the Gentleman can testify who first brought us the copy of the
Breue testified with the hands of our two brethren in Rome, M. Bishop and M.
Charnoke to be a true copy, whereby it unquestionably follows, that the
breach of promise wherewith father Holtby charge us for not submitting our
selves upon certificate received from our two brethren, is an untruth, as there
be many more in that Letter-treatise.

These notwithstanding, let us hear what were the letters and acknowledgements
of our 2. hrethre^, by mean whereof they are brought for witnesses, or as a
confirmation of blame against us. They both wrote that they heard Cardinal
Caietane affirm, that what was done touching the Archpriest, was done by order
from his Holiness: and that they heard so much also by others, not expressing
the parties names of whom they did hear it. Again that they repented
themselves of taking the journey, chiefly of the inconsideration they committed
therein, and that they requested their humble commendation and duty might be
done unto our and their Superior the Archpriest.

Lo the auowances and writings of them both, and which M. Bishop signified in
a Postscript only, upon occasion by like, that father Parsons reading his
Letter (as he did, and prescribed or approved the points to be treated of, in
all the letters that either of them wrote unto us, during the whole time of
their imprisonment, which was full four months) and finding that principal
Verb (the former signification) missing, he would not, but needs have the
said complements added in a poscript.

Certes that they repented themselves of taking the journey, being kept before
the writing of the Letters eight weeks (from the 29. of of December till the
22. of February, in close and straight durance, under the iay lourship of
father Parsons their chief adversary and examiner, was no strange news, and
less strange that they sorrowed the inconsideration they committed, which as
themselves have sithence expounded, they principally meant in not taking the
names of more Priests with them, or in a better form then they did, and
specially because they omitted the procuring of the King of France his Letter
in their behalf to his Ambassador in Rome, which was promised, and another to
his Holiness himself for request of favorable audience in their suit: matter
of just sorrow, they smarting after the rate they did for omitting of the
helps, upon confidence only of the most behoueable and reasonable petitions
they were to propose.

But of what persons, beside the Cardinal his Grace did our two brethren
remaining close prisoners, hear that the Archpresbytership, and the faculties
adjoined, was the order of his Holiness? Had any of those access unto the
prisoners, which lived near about his Holiness, or were often in his
presence, and so by likelihood might hear when the commission was given, or
after talked of? Were other strangers or their contrymen in the city
allowed to come unto them? Were the students of the College licensed at that
time to visit the prisoners, and have communication with them?

No, no, they were alike straightly kept, as they were not suffered to consult
or speak with any, nor the one of them with the other. What then? did his
Holiness Fiscall (who was appointed to examine the prisoners, but not long
after surrendered the office to father Parsons) report so much unto them? It
cannot be said, because the same man at the end of all their examinatio^s and
resiftings, told the prisoners (as they both witness) that the subordination
was not the ordinance of his Holiness. Of whom then had the prisoners that
intelligence? undoubtedly either from father Parsons or father Owen, who only
had recourse unto them: relators that must needs have belief given to their
words, because the one was a chief deviser of the authority, and his
reputation lay in gage to have it go forward: the other, a profiting scholar
in father Porsons studies, and his right hand in this busisinesse, as the
service following declares.

When master Charnocke wrote his letter unto us, by the appointment of the
Cardinals for a final end of their durance, as father Owen reported, and
father Parsons had the perusing thereof a night and a day, it was brought
again unto him by father Owen, with order from father Parsons to add that the
subordination erected was the order of his Holiness, who answering he could
not write so, because he knew it not, the other replied, that the Cardinal
protector said it when he sat in judgment in the cause, and that father
Parsons affirmed the same, and therefore he might well and truly write, that to
his knowledge the Archpresbitership was the appointment of his Holiness.
Whereupon the prisoner being willing to give the fathers the most contentment
he could, for his speedier riddance out of prison, promised him to write in so
large a manner in that point as possibly he could with any truth, and
accordingly signified in his Letter, yet not that he knew the subordination to
be the order of his Holiness, but that he heard the Cardinal to affirm it,
and also understood it by credible relation of others. The like wrote M.
Bishop, and not unlike upon the same persuasion.

But neither the one nor the other of our brethren, nor the Cardinal Protector
in the Constitutiue Letter, nor any other, of whom witness is claimed, did
ever in the least word affirm that the faculties and jurisdiction annexed to
the Archpresbitership, (the only point which was most needful of all other to
be descended unto, being the most material, and which alone for the
amplenesse, rigor, and vnusualnesse thereof, caused our delay) were the
ordinance or commandment of his Holiness. A thing worthiest of special note, as
that most manifests the headie violence of our adversaries, and how beyond
all color of reason, they have proceeded in their accusations and outcries
against us.

Now touching the commendation and duty our two brethren sent to be done, to
our and their superior the Archpriest: who could think, reading the passage,
but that somewhat lay hid, and was insinuated by the words, that they being
prisoners in Rome, should as it were, hunt after so impertinent an occasion of
calling M. Blackwell their Superior, and direct commendations unto him by that
title, when as we were right sure, they both well knew that the Cardinals
Letter made him but Superior over the Priests residing in England and
Scotland only, and not over any, whiles they lived any other where. And one of
them being sithence asked the meaning of the said words, answered, that the
authority of the Archpriest, not stretching to any out of England, this clause
[ so far as I can so far distant] used in the same sentence where he
rendered his duty, did show that he wrote it only to make fair weather with
father Parsons, and the sooner to get himself released of the imprisonment he
endured.

But would our adversaries indeed understand the truth, how much or wherein our
two brethren do either bear witness against us, or condemn our standing off,
to yield our obedience until the coming of his Holiness Breue? Let them
read M. Bishop his answer to father Parsons Letter, and the censure upon the
same, both printed in the English book, and written when they were not in
hold, and then tell us the particularities wherein they give testimony against
us, or find fault with our delay. In the mean, there are none but must see
that all the testimonies which are brought against us, proceeded from one head,
and take their whole force from the Cardinals word, and not from his Graces
word as auowing the particular faculties and jurisdiction annexed to the
Archpresbytership to be the command or appointment of his Holiness, but from
his Graces word only that he received a Commission to make peace in our
Country, and that following the will of his Holiness he decreed a
subordination. We therefore being not bound to believe (specially to obey, as
has been sufficiently proved before* the Cardinals word, himself writing and
affirming it, we were less bound by all consequence to believe and obey the
same related or witnessed unto us by others.

And here I think good to advertise, touching the report I have made of all
the precedent testimonies, that I do not so a^^ow it, as that I engage my word,
the report to be in every jot one with the Letters themselves: for this were
(the imperfection of man's memory considered) to ground certainty upon
uncertainty, especially the time being long since I read most of the Letters,
and never read them but once, nor could be admitted to copy them forth: when
also I feared no accident less, then that matters would fall out as now they
do: or that we should ever have had occasion to prove our selves no disobedient
run-agates from the Church of Rome, or from the supreme Pastor thereof, who
with semblable peril of life, and renunciation of worldly preferment, have for
many years labored to reduce other to the sheepfold, and due obedience of the
same Church, and highest Pontifex.

That which I have said is the whole truth of my own thoughts, and as much,
and not otherwise then my memory upon best recalling of matter could suggest.
If our adversaries will have the foresaid persons to speak more for them, or
in another tune against us: let them produce their Letters, and out of them
all, enforce the most they can against us. The quality and manner of their
dealing with us hitherto does not put us in hope, they will much spare us: and
we on the otherside, have as little fear (truth and sincerity encouraging)
but that we shall be well able to free our selves of as much, as all corners
being sought, can be objected in our rebuke. And certes the force of the
foresaid testimonies (if such far off speeches from the point, vnintended and
accidental, may be called testimonies which Pope Calixtus 3 q. 9. testet. si
debitum.
denies) will appear very weak, and be most easily avoided, if the ground
they stand upon be advisedly pondered. For if any of all the parties, of whom
our adversaries claim testimony should be demanded 4 q. 2. and 3. si testes.
null. ^s idoneus. Siluest. verb: testis nu. 2.
(Cardinal Caietane excepted, who neither might fitly bear evidence in his
own cause) the reason why they so wrote, or what knowledge or certainty they
had of the thing they affirmed: would they, or could they truly, yield another
reason for such their affirma^ce, the^ that they heard it to be so by report,
or that they had read the Letter Costitutiue? We believe verily no, and how ca^
we believe otherwise, one living at the time of the grant of the Commission in
Louaine, others in Bruxels, an other in Doway, an other we wot not where, all
distant a thousand miles from Rome where the authority was granted, save only
Cardinal Caietane and father Bellarmine, since made Cardinal.

And first, to hear a thing by report, is no good ground or sufficient
warrantise, for any one thereupon to witness the same to be true. For the
Ecclesiastical Canon has Testes no^ de alijs causis, vel negotijs dicant 3. q.
9. testes.
testimonium, nisi de his quae sub praesentia eorum acta esse noscuntur. Let
not witnesses give testimony of other causes or matters, but of those which
are known to be done in their presence. And Innocentius affirms, that if one
bearing witness of a thing, and being asked how he knew it to be so, as he
witnesses it to be: his testimony is nothing worth, if the can render no
surer cause of his testimony, then that he heard it by report. Si dicit, ego
scio quia sic omnes dicunt, non valet eius testimonium, In ca. cum causam de
testi. and attest. nu. 3.
quia mal^m and insufficientem causam reddit sui testimonij. If the Testis say,
I know it, because all men do so report, his testimony is not good, because he
assigns too weak or insufficient a cause or ground of the testimony he
bears. And the same holy Father and Pope reputed the glory of the Canonists,
has these words in the Nu. 2.
same place: Officium testis est proprie dicere veritatem de ijs quae percipit
quinque sensibus corporis. It is properly the office of a witness, to tell the
truth of those things, which he knows by one of the five senses of the body.
Consonant to this is that also which Siluester writes: Requiritur Verb. testis
nu. 6.
quod testis testificetur de auditu proprio, scilicet quantum ad sonos, vel
devisu quantum ad visibilia, and idem de alijs sensibus, non de alieno: Glos.
in l. in s^m. ff. de aqua pluuia, arcen.
quia non est proprie testimonium. It is required that a testis should bear
witness of the things himself heard or saw, and so the same of other senses,
and not of things he takes by report, because this kind of evidence is not
properly a testimony. Neither do other authors new or old disagree in this
position. Benintendus Conclu 67. nu. 10.
Testis de auditu non solum non plene probat, sed etiam non facit
praesumptionem sufficientem ad transferendum onus probandi in contrariu^: A
witness speaking by hearesay does not only not fully prove, but fails to make
so much as a sufficient presumption of enforcing the adversary to prove the
contrary. Again, and which comes a little nearer and more distinctly to our
case, the same author has these words almost immediately ensuing the other:
Ibid. nu. 11.
Testimonium de auditu and relatione alterius nullam facit probationem in
negotio de recenti gesto. Testimony given by hearsay and upon report, makes
no presumption in a matter newly done. Speculum Li. 1. de test. 1. nu. 53.
Testimonium de auditu alieno, s^z. quod audiui dicit non valet. A witness upon
hearesay is little worth. Panormitane In ca. ex literis de consuetu. nu 4.
Testis interrogatus quo modo scit, debet dicere, quia vidi and audiui. A
witness being asked how he knew the thing he testifies, ought to be able to
answer, because I saw it and heard it. For that as Barbatia records Super
Clem. in rubrica de elect fo. 97. col. 4
In vsu and auditu, fundatur testimonium. Testimony touching mattet of fact, is
founded upon assurance of the eye and ear. The author comprising the verdict
of the other three senses, under the nobleness and generality of the eye and
ear.

On the other side, if our adversaries shall say, that the above named
witnesses or any of them did read the Constitutiue Letter, and therefore wrote
as they did: we ask them what manner of ground this is, and wherein it
differs from the kind of testimony that follows? John imagines that Peter
gave him a box on the ear, and thereupon frames a bill of complaint against
Peter: and when he had framed it, shows the same to sundry of his friends.
After, the matter is brought to trial: Peter denies the giving of the blow,
John auerres it: the fact rests to be proved by witnesses. John in this mean
while understands, that those his friends to whom he showed the bill, have
sithence addressed some Letters to certain of their friends, and uttered some
words concerning the contents and drift of the bill, and thereupon calls them
to witness, and brings their said Letters into the Court: and they coming
to give evidence, the Judge asks whether they were present, and did see when
Peter gave John this blow: and they answer no. The Judge demands further*
what then is it which they can say for testimony of the fact. Marie quoth
they, we did read his bill of complaint before the suit was commenced, and
thereupon wrote the Letters we did, thinking that Peter had given John the
blow. Surely if such a piece of evidence and claim of testimony, being one
with that which is brought against us, should come before the Judges of the
Kings Bench, or Justices of Oyer and determiner, they might perhaps sport
themselves not a little at the folly. But the least cards must be all
coat-cardes against us.

For conclusion of our answer to this second objection, and for a brief
recital of that has been said before in this third reason, we beseech our
impugners to consider vnprightly and seriously, as before God in the court of
their own understanding: first, whether truth, reason, demonstratiue practice,
and the voice of all laws speak not more for us then for them: nay whether
they all do not combine and plead wholly for us, and altogether against them:
namely that every delegation must be proved by showing of the Commission or
authenticke copy thereof, and not by witnesses, especially if the delegation
or verbal commission shall impart a many of particular jurisdictions, as this
of his Holiness did to the Cardinal with like number of faculties. Then
whether testimonies not founded upon evidence of the eye or ear, but grounded
only upon report or hearesay, are of any force, or make a presumption in law,
in a matter lately done.

Thirdly, whether it be enough in law or conscience, when a delegation or
verbal commission is granted to one, deriuing many distinct and several
jurisdictions, each bringing their porper and increasing prejudice to others,
whether it be enough we say to testify the commission in general, and not for
the witnesses to descend to the testifying of the particular tenor of the
commission. And if in all these three understanding be convinced by the
evidence and proves aforegoing, then we instantly pray them for the love of
their own souls, not to be ashamed to confess the truth, and surceasse
further contention, remembering what the holy Ghost writes: Est confusio
adducens peccatum, and est confusio adducens gratiam and gloriam: there is a
confusion that brings sin, and there is a confusion that brings grace and
glory.

A Third reason that our impugners make against us, and seem in the force
thereof to take no small contentment, is, that at our first coming over, we
were, and are still believed to be Priests upon our word, without showing our
letters of orders, and that folk come to us, without making question either of
our Priesthood, or of our jurisdiction to hear confessions: and how then? our
selves being in this sort believed upon credit of our own word, could we
refuse to believe our Cardinal Protector, upon evidence of his Graces letter,
hand, and seal? Do we look that others even in that tribunal of loosing from
sin, should rely upon, and trust our bare word, and use us without scruple in
the court of their soul, and we in the sensible feeling and continuance of
this supreme credence and favor, so to forget our selves and our duty, as not
to give belief to the word of a Cardinal, of our Protector, of his Holiness
Counselor in all matters incident to the government of the Universal Church?
A fault that can no way be excused, and which cannot but condemn us with as
many as are wise. Well: let us notwithstanding the peremptorinesse of the
accusation, have leave to answer and clear our selves as we can.

First we desire to know of what kind of fault did this our reproved demeanor
condemn us? Not of the crime which was first objected. For to refuse to obey a
Cardinal Protector his letter in matter of like prejudice, and in authority
derived by commission from his Holiness without further proof, then his
Lordships own letter for testimony thereof, has no more affinity with that
crime, then white has with black, or things that are lawful with things
unlawful. Of what other offense then, did our foresaid demeanor condemn us?
Forsooth of enormious disobedience. What, is the matter so certain? Yea. Then
against whom immediately did we commit this enormious disobedience, against his
Holiness, the Cardinal, or master Blackwell? Not immediately certes against
his Holiness, because there is no disobedience, and much less that, which can
be called enormious, D. Tho. 2. 2. q. 105. art. 1. cor. Greg. de Vale. ibidem
punct 3. Siluester verb anobedientia and omnes.
but consists in the breaking of a known precept: and we neither understood
at that time, nor did know before we read it in his Holiness Breue, when we
presently yielded our obedience, that his Holiness had given commandment for
such a subordination to be directed with like jurisdiction as is set down in
the Constitutiue Letter, ne did the Cardinal any where specify or relate so
much. So that we having no understanding of such his Holiness commandment,
before the coming over of the Breue, and then submitting our obedience
thereunto without any delay, how could our demeanor be immediate and enormious
disobedience against his Holiness?

If our adversaries will gainsay any of the premises, as we hope the evidence
of the truth, nor their own consciences will give them leave, it rests (and
it is our request unto them) that they would tell us, when, to whom, and in
what form his Holiness gave such a commandment, and that we had also
understanding thereof, whiles we detracted to obey the subordination. An issue,
which we are sure all the world, nor the Angels of heaven can make true against
us, and which not verified, it remains impossible to prove that we were in
the action of our bearing off, enormiously and immediately disobedient against
his Holiness.

Not against the Cardinal as our Protector, because we neither knew nor heard
that his Lordship was by prerogative of authority, any otherwise a superior to
the Priests in England, then as other Cardinal Protectors are over the
Clergy of the countries or Provinces whereof they are chosen Protectors. Who
neither practice nor claim, as all Christendom is witness, any such
jurisdiction over the Priests, as either to ordain new superiorities amongst
the^, or to have the choosing of their prelate, or to increase the rules of
their subjection, or any otherwise to alter the form of their usual
government.

Not against the Cardinal as Delegate or Commissioner, because we were not
bound either to believe or obey him in that place, before his Grace had showed
us the rescript of the delegatio^, or otherwise authentically proved his
Holiness commission unto him, as has been abundantly declared before.

Not against the Cardinal as the distributer of faculties to Priests in their
commission for England, because the authority to institute an Archpriest with
like jurisdiction as is specified in the Constitutiue Letter, was not delegated
in that commission, nor ever so claimed, nor yet to this day so interpreted.

Not against master Blackwell and the twelve Assistants, because we being not
obliged (as is said) to obey the Cardinal in regard of the none-proofe of the
delegation or commission by word of mouth: we could not be bound to obey master
Blackwell or the twelve Assistants, taking their whole authority from the
Cardinal. Nemo in alium potest Glos. in c. Si. cui de elect li. 6
plus iuris transfer quam ipse habet. No man can transfer more right to
another then himself possesses. And therefore being not bound as is proved
before to obey the Cardinal in constituting the subordination, by reason his
Grace had not first showed or proved his commission, we rested less bound to
obey master Blackwell and the twelve Assistants, because what was defective in
his Grace the principal, or of no sufficient power to bind, must needs by all
necessary se^quell, be as much if not more defective, and of less force to
bind in the secondaries, or his Graces subdelegates.

Or if now our reprouers shall say that although our detracting to subject our
selves to the Cardinals order, were neither the crime they first took it to
be, nor enormious disobedience, yet the same could not but make us guilty of
some other great offense. Of what by name? Surely of the like offense by
coherence (the argument being brought a simili, of likeness between matters)
as those should commit, who should refuse to believe us to be Priests upon our
word, and would not but upon surer proof, use us in that function.

Now then what kind of offense might this be? To hear Mass, is by the
straight condition of our laws, the forfeiture of an hundredth marks: to help
a Priest at Mass, or to be confessed of him, is made an act of felony: to
relieve, abet, harbor, or maintain him, no less, What fault then not to
believe such or such an one to be a Priest, or not to partake with him in
Priestly functions, except he know him to be a Priest by other proves, then
upon the bare reckord of his own word? Verily the fault is so little, as none
of judgment will take it, but for an act of prudence: and the contrary, for a
fail of due consideration, if not for a fact of too much aduenturousnesse or
temeritie.

And our conscience here prompteth that our fault-finders, as full of
exceptions as they are against us, ne have, ne will, entertain any one as
Priest, and less subject themselves in confession unto him, of whom they shall
have no further surety what he is, a spy, or an honest man, then the parties
bare affirmation of himself.

But we wot how our contradictors will reply at last, when all other pretenses
be taken from them, to weete, that our distrust and prolonging to obey the
Cardinals order, was an injury to his Grace, and could not but derogate from
the honor of his high estate. This is the most that we think can be objected,
and to this we answer. First, that it is a received proposition in the civil
and common law, and reason conuinceth, that Non facit alicui iniuriam qui
vtitur iure suo. Ca. cum ecclesia de electione and l. iniuriaru^ 1. ff. de
iniurijs.
He does injury to no one, that uses his own right. We therefore using no
more then our own right in the above mentioned delay (and that kind of right
too, which the Canons of holy Church, the uniform consent of all writers, and
the general practice over all Christendom, does absolutely afford and assure
unto us) can never acknowledge, that our precedent demeanor, was, or could be
possibly, any injury to his grace. For can contraries be both true, or one and
the self action, be just and unjust, right to one, and injurious to another?
Siluester declaring the Etymology, or interpretation of the word [ Iniuria]
writes: Iniuria, est quasi non iure. Injury, takes her Verb. iniuria ante..
Aristoteles. 5. Ethn. ca. 1.
name of a defect of right. And the Philosopher opposes injury, as a contrary
to law or right. So that what is done lawfully, or by good right according to
law, cannot without the abuse of the term, be counted an injury.

Again, the not yielding of that to any man of what high degree soever, which
the law of holy Church does prohibit, or not grant it should be yielded unto
him, is neither injury nor the diminishing of reputation. And that our demurre
to admit the new authority was of this quality, it is plain by the authorities
that have been alleged, and will yet appear more evident hereafter.

Saint Augustine writes, and his words be registered in the Decrees, Lib. 19.
contra Faustum ca. 25. 14. q. 1. quod debetur.
Peccat qui exigit vltra debitum. He sins who exacteth beyond his due. Which
without peradventure holds as well in points of sovereignty and command, as
in matters of worldly substance, if not more, in respect that the abridgeme^t
of freedom is more irksome to man, then any mean loss of the goods he
enjoys. And therefore whatsoever our hard friends be pleased to deliver
abroad of his Graces intention, yet we cannot think that he intended to exact
that belief in us, and obedience to the contents of his Letter Constitutiue,
as upon the sole view thereof (his honors jurisdiction being a delegatine
power) we should incontinent captiuate our understanding and bow down our
necks to the yoke, without asking for other proof of the delegation and the
tenor thereof, then the credence of his own word alone.

Or if his Lordship had this meaning, as we shall not believe he had, to exact
so undue a tribute at our hands, yet that being more then our debt, and
repugnant to the order in Gods Church, how could our prolonging or not taking
his Graces word for full and sufficient warrantise of what he said, be either
sin in us, or an injury to his honor, when the learned writ and the
doctrine is received of all men. Quamui^ alias iniuria fiat ei cuius dicto
credi deberet, si ab eo exigeretur Gloss. in institut. Lancelot. li. 1. de
confirmatione electionis tit. 9.. patet, vreb. literas.
scriptura: secus tamen esset in casibus requirentibus a iure scripturam.
Although it should be otherwise an injury to exact of him the sight of his
commission, whom it is meet to believe upon his word: nevertheless it is not
so in these cases, in which by the assignement of the law a letter or written
testimony is required. And that the law not only licenseth, but appoints the
proof of a delegation to be made by showing the Delegators letters, the
authorities before quoted do very amply demonstrate* as also that commission
given by word of mouth in matter of prejudice, ought and must be attestated
otherwise then by the self and sole auowance of the commissioner, and likewise
that belief in cases of Bart. in l. palatinos cod* de collation fisc. l. 10.
Jason. consil. 72. nu. 3. and co^sil. 104. Alciet. in ca. cum contingat nu. 35.
de iurciur. Co^radus li. 2. ca. 2. de Cardinalibus.. 3 nu 22.
great prejudice is not to be given to the word of a Cardinal.

But now let us consider of the arguments, that our opponents make against us.
The Catholic laity of the Realm (say they) believe us to be Priests upon
credit of our own word, without showing them our letters of orders: Ergo we
were bound to believe our Cardinal Protector, affirming that he received a
commandment from his Holiness, to erect a subordination. Again, the layty
believing us to be Priests upon our word, resort in confession unto us without
moving question of our authority: Ergo we ought to have subjected our obedience
to his Graces order, and subordination appointed without making stay, or
demand for any further proof or confirmation thereof.

Good consequences: whether the antecede^ts be true or no. What, must the
favor we receive of the laity in not examining whether we be Priests or have
faculties or no, bring an obligation upon us to obey our Cardinal Protector
upon testimony of his own word alone, and not only in things of direct and
greatest prejudice, but even in things wherein the laws of holy Church give us
leave not to obey? Strange, that the voluntary favor of the laity, and in a
case too, wherein themselves receive commodity, as they do by partaking with us
in the exercise of our Priestly functio^s, must be of consequence to bind us to
accept of, and endure the foresaid detriments. Surely such favors are less
worth then thanks, and such solid arguments or fond deductions, fitter to be
used in a matter of sport, then for condemnation of Catholic Priests.

To believe one to be a Priest upon the affirmance of his own word, or
because he says so, is no matter of prejudice to the believer, or to any third
person: for neither is the believer or any other brought thereby within
compass of an enforced superiority, or of having their former liberty
abridged* and penalties imposed at the arbitrarie disposition of their hard
friends: but in our case, and supposed obligation, it fares much otherwise,
because the preiudices that attend the Constitutiue Letter, are many, and of
mightiest prejudice, as has been declared in the beginning of this reason. And
therefore by the rule of common wisdom, stronger and more assured proof was
both to be made and expected, for believing the authority and all the
particulars thereof, commanding a present subjection, then for believing John
Astile to be a Priest, so long as none are bound, but all left whol^y to their
own choice, either to hear his Mass, or receive Sacraments, or enter
acquaintance with him.

Moreover the law of humane courtesy inuiteth to believe the word of another in
auowances of no prejudice, the like as this is: to believe John Astile to be a
Ptiest so long as there is no band to partake with him in any spiritual or
indomageable action; but neither man's law, or Gods law, celestial or worldly
wisdom, does prescribe that we should believe another upon warrantise of his
only word in matters, that after, will we nill we, bring with them store of
prejudice, and a constrained bond of obedience, which evermore and with all
persons, is reckned for most irksome. But on the other side, it cannot be
showed any where certain, neither is there any such custom in the Church of
God, as that the laity are left free at their own choice, whether to believe
or not to believe a Priest to be Priest, unless he first show them his letters
of orders, this being an Tit. de Clericis pereg. per totum. did. 71. and 52.

exaction which only belongs to Bishops and such Curates to make* as shall
admit unknown Priests to say Mass or minister Sacraments in their Dioces or
jurisdiction.

Or let us grant to our adversaries, that the lay Catholics of our Realm
have Pastoral or Episcopal authority to call us to prove our ordination. What
may they do? No more certes by the Canons of holy Church, then to examine and
call such to this reckning as are Council. Trid vbi supra
Vagi and ignoti Lyndvvood vbi supra.
de quorum ordinatione non constat, wandering and unknown Priests of whose
ordination there is no certainty. Lyndwood commenting upon our country
constitutions* has these words: Lyndvvod lib. 1. in ca. cu^ quanta de cler.
pereg verb. constiterit.
vir been not us and bonaefamae, qui vbi conuersatus est, longo tempore habitus
est pro ordinato, non cogitur nec per literas nec per testes probare
ordinationem suam. A man well known and of good fame, who in the place where
he lived was a long time counted a Priest, is not to be constrained to prove
his ordination either by letters or witnesses. And Pope Innocentius the third,
resolving the doubts which the patriarch of Jerusalem moved unto him touching
such as came into his Dioces without their Dimissories or testimonial l^tters,
writes: Ca. tuae fraternitatis de Cler. pereg.
Nisi legitime tibi constiterit sieve per literas, sieve per testes ( Inter eodem
tit.
sieve per idonea argumenta) de illorum ordinatione canonica, qui penitus sunt
ignoti, non debes ipsos permittere in tuis plebibus celebrare. Unless thou
do assuredly understand either by letters or witnesses, or by sufficient
arguments their Canonical ordination who are utterly unknown, thou ought
not to permit them to celebrate before thy Diocesians.

Now how can it be conceived, that we are wandering persons utterly unknown,
or that our initiation or receiving of Priesthood appeared neither by letters,
witnesses, or other able arguments, being trained up as we were in a known
Seminary, and taking holy orders by the appointment of the superior, the
whole house likewise witnesses thereof, and many of our fellows here in
England ready from the eye to attestate the same, the frequent correspondence
also between the chief of the Seminaries and others in our country, and
almost a weekly intercourse of persons too and fro, with many other pregnant
and most forcible presumptions: we ask how it can be conceived,
notwithstanding the counterpleading of all these contrary apparances, that we
be persons utterly unknown, and by sequel such as may be suspected whether we
be true Priests, or but disguisers and miscreants? If our judgment shall be
taken in our own case, we think there is little reason for any man to call
our Priesthoods in doubt, were our own words of no credit, and consequently
the auauncing of the favor we receive in being believed to be Priests upon our
own relation without sight of our letters of orders, to be but an idle
flourish, and as weak an argument, as what is weakest to prove that we were
bound to obey what our Cardinal Protector ordained, without making question of
his Graces authority, or looking for further proof then the testimony of his
own word for warrantise thereof; but such truths must have like proves.

To end all in few words, we ask our adversaries what is our duty to do if
the laity shall refuse to believe one, two, or more of us to be Priests, and
will not have communion in divine Service and Sacraments with us as with
Priests, until we show them our Letters of orders, or shall otherwise
according to law prove our selves to be men of that calling? Will they out of
their wisdom, and charity give us other counsel, then to have patience in
the interim, and to procure with most convenient speed satisfaction and legal
testimony to their doubts and exceptions? No truly: well, then we not holding
our selves bound to admit the subordination upon credence of the Cardinals
word, until such time as his Grace had either showed the rescript of the
delegation, or proved his verbal commission, or obtained from his Holiness a
confirmation of the authority erected, what was the part of our Archpriest,
the society, and their adherents to do in this point? not as ours was in the
former, to patient our bearing off, and procure so soon as they could one of
the foresaid proves for our due satisfaction, either a sight of the Commission
it self, or an authentical proof thereof, or else some Papal instrument for
testimony of that which his Grace had brought into our Church and imposed upon
us. It cannot be denied the cases being alike, or rather our case infinitely
more demanding that right of justice.

And if this had been their duty, as the lots changed, it would soon have
been proclaimed, then what thanks did we deserve in saving them that labor
and charges, and undertaking to our great cost, the discharge of that business
for them? We desire not to be our own judges, nevertheless can we think but
that our pains therein craved a gentler recompense at their hands, then to
imprison those that were sent about the business, and not only to imprison
them (a thing never heard of as we think since S. Peter sat first in the
Chair, the nature of the affair considered) but to raise most fabulous and
sinful reports of them, and dub both them, and us, with the surnames of all
impiety, as of faction, emulation, ambition, scandal, rebellion, highest
sacrilege, disallegiance to the Sea Apostolic, renegacie from the spouse of
Christ, and of what not, implying turpitude in this kind? A strange requital,
and so strange, as inhumanitie it self could hardly deal less charitably, or
more unconscionably with us, had we been Jews or Turks, and the only dross
of either nation: but our Lord Jesus give us ever his grace to possess our
souls in patience, and incline our disturbers to reuerse at length their most
uncharitable slanders, the cause and continuing occasion of all the scandalous
broile among us, past, present, and to come.

We have been the longer in refuting this weak and ungrounded reason, because
not only the vulgar, but father Holthy in his discourse of the 30. of June,
1601. and diverse other both of the Laity and Clergy, Secular and Religious,
have it most frequently in their mouths, and enforce the objection as a most
mighty and choking argument to convince what they most ignominiously burden us
withal.

A Fourth reason that our oppositours bring for proof and maintenance of the
crimes they impute unto us, is, the fewness of our number, being as father In
his said discourse the 30. of June.
Holthy writes, but twelve or thirteen in all, or as Doctor Haddock and M
Array in the libel dated the 10. of January 1599. and given up to the two
Cardinals Protector and viceprotector against M. Bishop and M. Charnocke.
other make the account but ten: and In his letter to M. Bishop the 9. of
October 1599. and in the Apology.
after father Parsons manner of numbering us, much fewer then ten.

First let us admit that these men write a truth, as how far their words
swerve from all truth, it comes after to be examined, yet we are to demand
of them and the rest of our impugners (who think the fewnes of our number,
matter and evidence clear enough to condemn us by) whether the cause we stand
in be naught in that we are but five, ten, or twelve which defend it. If they
say yea, as they must, or else bewray their own reason: then must it follow by
force of the same reason* that the cause of S. Thomas of Canterbury in defense
whereof Gulielm. Neubrigensis lib. 2. ca. 16.
no one Bishop adhered unto him in the whole Realm, nay, all subscribed to the
Articles he stood against, was treasonable, rebellious, or unlawful: then the
cause that Bishop Fisher died for, and the causes that infinite other of great
Holiness maintained, having fewer and incomparably fewer of the clergy
united to them in open defense of the same* then are now, or were at first of
our company, were likewise either treasonable, or rebellious, or unlawful:
which we are sure our adversaries will not say, and yet they cannot but say it,
if they stand to the trial of the reason they make against it, or shall not
acknowledge the unsoundness or inualiditie thereof.

For further satifaction in this point, we refer our adversaries to the daily
judgment, which experience makes the surest confutation of all other; whether
the small number of open defendants (especially when the sword of authority is
drawn against the matter or action defended, as it is in our case) be a
sufficient warrantie in conscience, for any one of understanding to infer that
the cause they stand in, is wicked or ungodly, or not meet for men of quiet
natures, or Priests to be seen in. Verily the question is so clear and
demonstrated by daily experience, as he that should make doubt hereof, might
not amiss seem to have lived out of the world, nothing being more frequent in
the world, then for truth to find fewest defenders, when authority, humane
favor, and temporal gain be her impugners.

But to underprop this weak reason, founded upon our small number, father
Holthy fortifieth and gildeth the matter in this wise. It is Page 2. and 5.
well enough known (says he) that those who received the authority, far
exceeded the other, who deferred their obedience, not only in number, being
twenty for one, but in all things else, setting their presumptuous minds and
busy heads ^side. And, it is too too clear, that the refusal came not either
of ignorance or infirmity, but of plain malice, of an obstinate will not to
obey, and from a proud presumptuous mind and seditious spirit. Also, it is
manifest that some of the best among them, were ever noted for busy and
seditious spirits, yea no one of their chiefest almost, but he was noted with
some particular fault or exception: but among their brethren (who embraced
their authority) there were many which lived without touch of discredit, and
every way better qualified then any of them. Thus much father Holtby. And
father Parsons in the Apology strikes this key often, as the music perhaps
that best contenteth his ear: yet because the untruths in that book be
innumerable, and because another intends to display them in part, we mean
not here to insert any of his course reports, but will return to father
Holtby, and demand of him the reason, why, if the ill habites and sins he
vpbraideth us with be notorious, he did not name the persons he meant, but
uses the deprauing words in such general manner, as the Reader is left (a
condemned Nauar. in Man. ca. 18. nu. 18.
kind of detraction) to apply them to whom, and to so many as he lists of
our company. Or if the wicked qualities and enormities he obiecteth, be not
commonly known to reign in us, why did the religious father (he and his
accomplices being the Sotus de inst. h. 5. q. 7. art. 3. Valenti Tom. 3 disp. 5.
q. 14. punct. 3.
assailers, and we the party assailed, a material difference and which
puts great odds in the case touching the lawfulness or unlawfulness of
revealing secret sins) thus inordinately publish and blaze our dishonours to
the world, in addressing the discourse to one, but communicating the same to
many ere it came to that one bodies view.

We expect his answer, and how he will clear himself of both, either being a
foul transgression: and in the mean do hold this position, that truth out of
what mouth soeuet it comes, ought to be Gloss. in ca. quaeritur 2. q. 7.
verb. praeponimus.
preferred and not impugned. A lesson of Christian doctrine and which our
Savior in his own fact did not let to manifest in commending the censure of
Luke 7.
the Pharisie with a recte iudicasti, thou have judged aright, albeit he
perfectly knew him to be most envious and arrogant. So that how exorbitant
soever our natural inclination and qualities be, and with what particular
faults or exceptions never so greatly distaining, the chiefest of our company
go marked, yet if we maintain a truth, the maintenance is not to be
calumniated, either in that we are but few, or because we are (admitting the
relgious man's slanders) busy headed, proud, and presumptuously minded,
seditiously spirited, and well known to be ever noted with particular faults
or exceptions. In which treatise also, the same discrupulous father forbeareth
not to condemn us, for not yielding our obedience at first before notice of
his Holiness Breue, of (to use is own words) a most grievous and damnable,
most enormious, notorious, public and heinous sin, breeding open scandal,
and making us infamous for rebellion coming from plain malice, and conuincing
us to have a seditious and most presumptuous spirit, etc.

Touching the lesser faults or ill properties imputed, we answer no more, but
that we know now who can first throw the stone at us: for Ioh. 8.
it were indecent, or a point of hypocrisy, to twite other with particular
faults, except he himself were free. And concerning the criminous, we are to
put him and his Superior in mind, that there is D. Tho. 22. q. 62. art. 2. ad
2^ Caietanus ibid. Sotus de iustitia lib. 4. q. 6. art. 3. ad 4 arg. Nauar. in

satisfaction due unto us, and we demand it, unless he shall prove (to which
we challenge him) both that we were culpable in the manner he specifieth, and
that the offenses were notoriously known.

Now for the comparison, we are very sure that not all nor the most part in our
Realm, do think that M. Doctor Bagshaw, M. Doctor Bishop, M. Bluet, M. Mush,
M. Tailor, so much inferior as father Holtby makes them to any of the elder
Priests that are of the contrary side: nor yet M. Doctor Norres, M Champney,
M. Bennet, M. Drurie, second by so great odds to any of the younger sort in any
one quality or talent soever: nay rather if the matter were to pass by verdite
of most voices, it is certain that father Holtby would be found partial, if
not detractious in the comparison.

And concerning the report that he and others make, and seem to glory much
therein, that we were but ten or 12. at most, who stood off, to admit the
authority, we say no more but that fath* Parsons (through whose irreligious
dealing our two brethren were spoiled of their notes and schedules they
carried, and which he sent afterward into England or the most part of them)
can witness that there were thrice ten within one who gave their names:
whereof some also wrote that there were many more of their brethren, which
disliked the form of the government appointed, or rather that they were but
few, which were willing to receive it, if they might any way choose. And indeed
what one commodity spiritual or temporal, either to Priest or lay person did
the authority bring with it, to inuit any one of judgment Aggredi. Sathanas
non dubitauit, vt inter se collideret.
to like thereof: unless apparent preiudices, slander, that the secular
Priests and Laity were at great variance, and the mighty increase of our
miseries or new seruitudes must be counted commodities?

But howsoever our adversaries do please themselves in our small number, yet
there are few in our Realm of any acquaintance with Priests, but know there be
mo then ten inwardly for us, for one against us. We wish from our hearts that
every Priest would show himself outwardly, as he is affected in his thoughts,
and then we should little doubt but that our small number (so great a beam of
the eye of our cause) would quickly wax the greater part, and the reckning
that our adversaries make of twenty for one, to be on their side against us,
would far fall out to be truer in the count for us.

A Fifth objection which our oppositours make against us, is the grievous
condemnation that publickely passed upon us at Rome, by sentence of the two
Cardinals, Caietane and Burghesio, and by the contents of the Breue and his
Holiness judgment. The auowances of our Archpriest in his decrees of the 29.
of May, 1600. and of the 18. of October following, and in his Dimissories to
me, and refutories to all the other Appellants of the 20. of December.

His words in the former decree are these. Whereas after the condemnation at
Rome of the two Ambassadors (he means Master Doctor Bishop and Master
Charnoke) together with all their accomplices here, and also the Popes Breue
confirming the Cardinals Letters, as, Validas ab initio, (that is of force from
the beginning) and utterly condemning and inualiditing all things done to the
contrary.

His words in the latter decree, these: Vt omnes occasio in posterum tollatur,
vel minimae litis de hac praeterita controuersia commouendae: quoniam ex
literis nostrae institutionis datis Romae die 7. Martij 1598. potestas nobis
concessa est, de dubijs ac controuersis inter nos exorientibus determinandi,
eaeque literae a Smo D. N. die 6. Aprilis 1599. confirmatae sunt; omniaque and
singula illis literis contenta de expresso mandato and ordine, and cum
participatione and certa scientia sua facta and ordinata fuisse declarante,
adeo vt suum plenarium effectum sortiri and plenissimam roberis firmitatem
obtinere debeant: atque irritum and mane sit quicquid secus per quoscunque
commissarios aut iudices attentari scienter, vel ignoranter contigerit:
propterea nos ex authoritrte hac nobis a Smo D. N. commissa pronuntiamus and
declaramus primas illas literas institutionis nostrae omnes Catholicos in
Anglia vere obligasse: eosque quinostrae authoritati scienter quouis modo
repugnarunt, vere inobedientes fuisse sedi Apostolicae, and in nostrum officium
per eandem sedem institutum rebels.

The English.

That al occasion hereafter may be taken away eue^ of moving the least strife
of this controversy past, because by the Letters of our institution given at
Rome the 7. of March 1498. authority is granted unto us to determine the
doubts and controversies that rise between us: and these letters were
confirmed by his Holiness the sixth of April 1599. and declaring all and
singular the things contained in these letters to have been done and ordained,
by his express commandment and order, and with his participation and
certain knowledge, in so much as they ought to have their fullest effect, and
obtain greatest firmness: and that it be void and of no validity whatsoever
shall happen otherwise to be assaied wittingly or ignorantly by what
Commissioners or Judges soever. Therefore we by this authority committed unto
us by his Holiness, do pronounce and declare these first letters of our
institution really to have bound all the Catholics in England, and those who
wittingly any manner of way impugned our authority, to have been truly
disobedient to the Sea Apostolic, and rebellious against our office
instituted by the same Sea.

The words he uses in the dimissorie and refutory letters, are these:
Manifestum est quod ipsorum progressus etiam ante Breue Apostolicum in grauem
condemnationem Romae duorum Illmorum Cardinalium, and etiam suae Stis iudicio
prolapsi fuerint. It is manifest that their proceedings (he means our delay
and sending to Rome) even before the coming of the Apostolical Breue were
sharply condemned at Rome by the sentence of two most illustrious Cardinals,
and also by the judgment of his Holiness.

Were not our deseruings very ill if these things be true? Or being untrue, was
not our superior forgetful in reporting after this manner, that is: untruly of
the Cardinals, unjustly of his Holiness, and most wrongfully against us his
subjects and brethren? None can deny it. Let us then examine the matter, and
see whether the reports be true or no. And here first we protest that we cannot
conjecture the reason why his Reverence calls master Doctor Bishop, and
master Charnocke, two Ambassadors (by which name they are also styled in the
Appendix) considering they were imprisoned before they were Fol. 22.
heard, and after exiled a part and confined in their exile, a kind of entreaty
which was never used by that Sea toward any Ambassadors if toward any other
person. To think our Superior used the word as a mock, placing it as he did
in a public Decree, seems so much or infinitely to derogate from the gravity
requisite, as we cannot well admit the thought, albeit we know not what other
meaning he could have.

But to let this pass and come to what is more material.

After the comdemnation at Rome of the two Emb^ssadors together with all their
accomplices here] we are very sure that our greatest adversaries themselves will
not say that there passed any other condemnation upon our two brethren at Rome
or elsewhere, save that sentence only which the two Cardinals Caietane and
Burghesio gave in writing under their names, and in this there is no mention
made of their accomplices, nor any word in the whole sentence that can in the
least manner sound that way. And to the end we be not our own judges, but that
other may see the truth as well as our selves, the sentence is verbatim set
down, and after translated into English.

The English.
To the reverend in Christ, Father Rector or Vicerector of the College of the
English in the City. The Decree or definitive sentence of the most Illustrious
Cardinals Caietaine and Burghesio in the cause of William Bishop and Robert
Charnocke.
Reverend father in Christ as our brother. Whereas of late by commission from
his Holiness we have heard and examined the cause of two English Priests, to
wit William Bishop and Robert Charnocke, which have been for the space of some
months detained in this College, it appeared unto us to be in no case
expedient for the English cause, that the said Priests should immediately
return to those parts, where they have been at variance with other men of
their order; and now having conferred the matter wi^h his Holiness, and being
again certain of his pleasure therein, we think meet to decree and appoint
the very same. Wherefore we ordain in his Holiness and our own name, and do
strictly command the foresaid Priests William and Robert in virtue of holy
obedience, and under pain of suspention from divine offices, to be incurred in
the fact it self, and under other censures and penalties to be inflicted at
the appointment of our holy father, that without the express leave of his
Holiness, or the most Illustrious Cardinal Protector, they do not for the
time presume to go to the kingdoms of England, Scotland, or Ireland, but live
quietly, peaceably, and religiously in other Catholic countries, where we have
assigned them: and endeavor as well by letters, as by messengers, and by all
other means, that peace and union be conserved among the English Catholics at
home and abroad. Which things if they truly and really perform, their license
to return may the sooner after be granted unto them. But in the mean while we
command these things to be rightfully observed and faithfully executed, and
that your Reverence signify thus much unto them in our name. Given at Rome
from our Palaces the 21. of April 1599.

Your Reuerences as brother, H. Cardinal Cai^tane Protector, as brother C.
Cardinal Burghesio.

NOw let him whosoever would soonest find a hole in our coat, teach us in what
part of the sentence we their accomplices here are mentioned, or point us to that
word in the whole Decree, which can any way justly or colourably be stretched
to such a meaning or implication. And if neither of these can be showed, as
most sure it is they cannot, how can we with any regard of truth, or moderation
of speech be said to be condemned?

Again delegatine Judges of what estate soever they be, receiving authority by
Commission from their superior, to hear and determine the cause of such and
such persons by name (as did the two Cardinals from his Holiness, as their
sentence it self bears witness) cannot extend their censures and
condemnation to any of the said persons accomplices, not expressed in the
Co^missio^, how guilty soever they know them to be. The reason is, because they
have no authority nor jurisdiction over them, as the first, fourth and fifth
Proposition teach in the second Reason, and may be further declared by this
similitude of the cases. The Q^eenes Majesty gives a Commission to two of her
privy Counselors to arraigne John Astile and John Anoke for treason
committed: Now we ask whether these privy Counselors, may by virtue of this
limited and particular commission proceed upon and condemn such co^plices of
the said traitors as their honors by sifting matters may find to have had their
finger in the treason, without any personal trial or summo^s of the^; for
thus also it fared in our case. We assure our selves that none will say they
can, and those that are studied in the laws do knew they cannot; and that the
laws of our country (reasons voice) have provided punishments condign for so
exorbitant a presumption.

Furthermore howsoever the condemnation given by the Cardinals upon our two
brethren, may be lengthned to reach unto us, yet the punishment imposed (a
correlatiue in a kind to the condemnation, and which cannot but concern all
those on whom the condemnation passed) ne did nor could possibly any way agree,
or so much as point to their accomplices here. For this being, that those on whom
the condemnation was given should not presume to go into the kingdoms of
England. Scotland or Ireland without express leave of his Holiness or the
Lord Protector, it could in no congruencie in the world appertain to us who
were in England long before, and at the same time even to the knowledge of the
Cardinals themselves, when their Graces delivered the sentence, if both their
Graces did expressly set down such a sentence (as the speeches and carriage of
Cardinal Burghesio to M. Charnocke seem in a sort to admit a doubt, least the
inditing thereof were the left hand work of father Parsons, as the words [ in
isto Pregnant suspicion of father Parsons cloaked dealing.
Collegio detenti detained in this Colledge] contained in the sentence, and the
sentence being dated from their Palaces, yield no improbable conceit, together
with other grounds touched in the censure upon father Parsons letter to M.
Bishop.

Moreover, if condemnation passed upon us at Rome, as accomplices of our two
brethren, then does it necessarily follow, that we were their accomplices in the
crime they were condemned for. And what crime was that? for maintaining
controversies as the sentence expresses, with other men of their order. Well,
but what kind of controversy did they maintain? and with what men by name?
and how came our partaking with them so notorious, as that we might rightfully
be condemned (for what was not rightfully done, can never be but injuriously
objected) without summons or relation from us, what we could say for our
selves? The sentence does neither specify what were the controversies, nor
name the men, with whom they maintained them. Wherefore it were well, and but
the due tribute of charity (considering the infamy that grows unto us by so
public an affirmance of our condemnation at Rome) that declaration were made
both what the controversies were in particular. and the names of the persons
with whom they were maintained, and also our notorious participation in the
same that so our country might be informed of the particular: and our selves
^ake notice of the offense we committed, which without such help, we cannot
hitherto call to mind.

To say that the controversies, and the persons with whom they were maintained,
was the delay which our two brethren and our selves made in admitting the new
authority after sight of the Cardinal Protector his Letter: and in their going
to Rome by our persuasion, for more certain knowledge of the subordination,
and how fully it was established, and for informing his Holiness, as well of
the inconveniences thereof, as of the needs that abound in our country, were,
as we think, to charge the two Cardinals with ignorance or error, or both. For
if this were the controversy, and the Archpriest the party with whom it was
maintained (as if not, the whole world cannot prove us to be their accomplices in
any other controversy) then we must ask this question: whether M. Blackwell
was at that time, when we delayed to subject our selves unto him so authorized
our Archpriest, as we were bound under sin or other bond to admit him before
the coming of his Holiness. Breue If he were not, as the foregoings show he was
not, and the ensuings God willing shall prove that we could not admit him
without transgressing the laws of holy Church, then the nonadmittance of him
was not to maintain controversies, but to defend, we say not our freedom
(though if it had been so, the endeavor had been most lawful and honest) but
to defend truth, to shun penalties, and for conseruing order and the
Hierarchy of Gods Church inuiolated. Actions which no way approach to that
degree of deformity, as to deserve exile and also confinement in exile, and in
Catholic Priests, that had many years ventered their lives in Christ his
cause, and the banishment and confining therein to be inflicted upon them by
personages of Ecclesiastical preeminence.

If on the other side, M. Blackwell was so fully and absolutely constituted our
Archpriest, as we could not without sin protract the submission of our
obedience unto him: then must we crave pardon to think that the two Cardinals
mistook in their sentence, quid pro quo, one kind of sin for another, the
less for the greater. For the only and sole cause which their honors allege
in the sentence of banishing and confining our two brethren, was for that they
had maintained controversies with men of their own order.

So that if the bearing off to receive M. Blackwel in the authority he claimed,
were indeed the maintaining of the controversies which their graces meant in
their sentence (as needs it must be if M. Blackwel wrote a truth in affirming
us to be condemned at Rome as their accomplices, we being at no time their
accomplices in any other controversy) then as we have said, their Graces
mistook the less sin for the greater, controversy for disobedience, or
truer for rebellion: Panorm. in ca. s^ne 2. de ofsic. iud. deleg. nu. 4.
rebellion being when one will not obey, or shall impeach the jurisdiction of
his Superior: or for a far greater sin, if all be true which has been
objected against us. Neither were their honors, as it seems, only mistaken,
or spoke improperly in this, but also in another point of like moment, viz. in
that M. Blackwell being lawful Superior to our two brethren (as it is
supposed) and in many respects of more then Episcopal jurisdiction over them,
nevertheless their Graces did not otherwise name or more particularly style M.
Blackwell, then by comprising him under the general term of other me of their
own order, for so run the words in the sentence, as the Reader may see: nor
is there any other cause at all alleged why they were banished and confined,
but for that they had maintained controversies with other men of their own
order, and therefore not expedient to the English cause that they should anon
return to those parts where they had so demeaned themselves.

Errors of that nature, as it were hard to think their graces would commit,
considering their long practice and place, but chiefly in respect of the
unusual and grievous punishment imposed, and for that by this general or
improper speech, neither the punished were let to understand the nature of
their offense (a default in justice) nor satisfaction given to the world, why
so heavy chastisement was taken of Priests coming so far off to the Sea of
Rome.

Considerations which force us to think, that their Graces meant not by the
said words of the decree, the controversy which our two brethren had with the
Archpriest, in not admitting his authority upon sight of the Constitutiue
Letter, but the maintaining of some other controversy, albeit we wot not, nor
can guess what controversy that should be, or with whom.

Again the words of the decree are for maintaining controversies with other
men of their own order. Which being spoken in the plural number, and none can
say that either of our two brethren maintained controversies, or had so much as
unfriendly speech with any one Priest (M. Blackwell excepted) in reproof or
dislike of his admitting the subordination. Which conuinceth except the
sentence were erroniously give, that their Graces could not not understand by
maintaining controversies with other men of their own order, the difference
between the Archpriest and them concerning the receiving or not receiving of
the Subordination.

And to show the advantages that commonly concur with all truth, and do
abound in this, we will grant to our adversaries that the Cardinals understood
no other controversy in their sentence, then that which our two brethren had
with our Archpriest about the subordination, and wherein we were their
accomplices, and that also the punishment inflicted, was such as it might as well
appertain to us as to them (as how merely impossible it was so to do, it has
been declared before) yet what sequence can be inferred either in equity
(which is justice tempered with the sweetness of mercy, and evermore
chalengeth her due place in judgments given by such personages because justice
without mercy is cruelty, as S. Chrysostom writes) or in rigor, extending
all things to the highest severity that can be? Must the condemnation that
passed upon our two brethren be stretched, and needs inuolue us their
accomplices, neither summoned to the trial, nor named in the sentence, nor
specified in his Holiness Commission to the Cardinals, or we otherwise under
like authority or jurisdiction of their graces? Certes both reason, learning
common sense, and the custom of all Nations, Heathen and Christian do
counterpleade: nor all ages, as we think, can yield one president from the
beginning of the world to this present day, where and against whom any
iuridicall condemnation (as that is maintained to be which passed against our
two brethren) has been in like sort extended, were the persons to Did. 86.

whom it was extended of never so base calling, and the fact they committed
never so notorious and execrable. Circumstances or material points which
greatly alter our case: for Popes, Councels general and provincial, and
famous Emperors have decreed sundry privileges for the more just and
respectfull proceedings against men of our function. Yea the holy Apostle for
the more reverence of Priesthood, omitted not to give direction likewise in
this affair, and the fact also wherein our two brethren were condemned not the
most heinous even by that species or kind of the offense, to which the
Cardinals themselves raunged, and entitled it by: viz. the maintaining of
controversies with other men of their own order.

It is a received Proposition among the Canonists, and alleged by Pope
Innocentius the third, and Pope Gregory the ninth that Ca. dilecto de prebend.

Regulariter alijs non nocet res inter alios iudicata. Regularly a matter past
in judgment between others, hurts none but the parties themselves against
whom the judgment was given. Which saying howsoever it may be understood and

several exceptions, and hardly can our case though racked never so hardly, be
brought under any of them all) yet it is most certain that the prejudice it
can bring to their accomplices or fellows in the action, is but Panor. in ca.
quamuis des^^. and reiud. nu. 3. and Couarun. a^ pract. quaest. ca. 13. nu. 4.
a presumption, or at the worst hand, according to the opinion even of those
that are most large in the matter, but Bartholus in l. admonend^ff. de iureiur

a presumption only or half proof, but a full proof, that is an evident,

such as the edict auoweth and diuulgeth us to be condemned of.

Or if there were no authority or verdict of general practice to prove that a
judgment passing upon certain persons by name, he does nor can extend it
self to the inuoluing of their accomplices, yet the drift of common reason and
the avoiding of several inconveniences ensuing thereupon, would convince no
less. For such a consequence and order of justice, once in ure and admitted,
none that had fellows in any action (how just and honorable soever the same
were) could assure themselves not to be condemned therein, or not fear
probably to be condemned, in regard the adverse part might single out one or mo
of the company (to which attempt such ministering of justice would be a good
allurement) and call them to trial who either by error, negligence, or ill
pleading, or by underhand packing or cousinage, might leese or betray the
cause: and then the judgment given upon them* must by this new form of
justice inuolue and condemn all the rest of the partisans or accomplices,
neither cited to appear, nor weeting to the trial, or yet named in the
condemnation. An enlargement and subintellection which the 3. q. ^. ca. Omnia.

laws of holy Church forbid, and which going once for justice, would soon
occasion a thousand trecheries, and put out of joint all the commonweals in
the world. Which we do not say to insinuate a fault in our brethren, but to
show the non scquitur or discoherence of the inference, that because forsooth
our brethren were condemned, (upon what unconscionable information father
Parsons better knows) therefore we being their accomplices were also condemned,
notwithstanding we were neither summoned, nor privy to the trial, nor named at
all in the sentence, nor specified in the Judges Commission.

Panormitane the choicest expositour of the law, gives several examples
wherein the sentence given against one offender, does not dilate it self and
damnifie the complice or concurrent in the same fault, as namely In ca. qua^nis
de sent. and re iud. nu. 25.
one being condemned for producing false witnesses, it follows not thereupon
that the witnesses were false. Likewise Nu. 26.
a notarie condemned of making a false instrument, does not infer the
condemnation of the party through whose solicitation he did it. Again, Nu. 27.
two brothers by father and mother, marrying with two sisters of like sort,
within the degrees of consanguinitie, the condemnation of the one brother, does
not extend it self to the condemnation of the other brother, nor indomageth
his cause or plea. In brief, the condemnation 2. q. 4. interrogatum.
of the Adulterer, implies not the condemnation of his fellow the adulteress,
or the contrary, but the party not confessing the fault is left to his or her
purgatio^. The reason of all which is (as has been said before) for that
conviction might happen to pass upon the suspected delinquent, either by fault
of not joining issue well, or by default of unskillful pleading, or by
corruption of justice, or by testimony of false witnesses, or by partiality
of the Judges, or the like. But of this enough, the adversaries assertion being
alike weak, and contrary to all form of law.

To come now to another part of our Archpriests affirmatio^, viz. that the
Popes Breue confirms the Cardinals Letters, as, Validas ab initio, having
force from the beginning, and utterly condemns and inualidateth all things
done to the contrary. First, howsoever some of those particulars may be
deduced, as illations out of the Breue, yet it is most clear, that not all,
nor the most part of the words are to be found in the Breue. And to the end,
that all which we are to say in disproofe of these auowances, may the more
ealsiy be understood, and that all persons may consider the inferences and
manner of proceeding on both sides, we thought good to annex and English his
Holiness Breue word for word as exactly as we could.

FOr future memory of the thing, etc. Among the weightiest cares of our
pastoral solicitude, that surely of conseruing and propagating the Catholic
Religion possesses the chiefest place: and therefore what things soever are
done and ordained to this end, upon our commandment by the Cardinals of the
holy Roman Church, we, that they may take due effect, do fortify the same with
the strength of a pastoricall confirmation. For as much as of late our beloved
son Henry, presbyter Cardinal of the title of S. Potentiana, Chamberlain of
the holy Roman Church, and Protector of the English nation with us and the Sea
Apostolic, has by our commandment for the happy administration and
governance, and for the mutual love, peace, and union of the Catholics of the
kingdoms of England and Ireland, and for the conseruing and augmenting of
Ecclesiastical discipline deputed by his letters patents dispatched, which
begin in this manner, ( It is known and almost by daily experience found true,)
and end after this sort: ( And I very heartily commend me to your prayers most
loving fathers and brethren, and Christ his most reverend confessors, the 7.
day of March 1598. our beloved son George Blackwell English Priest, Bacheler
of Divinity, for his piety, literature, zeal of Catholic Religion, and his
other virtues to be Archpriest over the English Catholics, with certain
faculties by him, and other twelve Priests his Assistants respectively to be
exercised, as is more at large contained in the said Letters patents, whose
tenor we will have reckned or expressed, as if they were word by word in these
presents inserted. And we desiring the foresaid deputation, and all things
contained in the above mentioned Letters patents, as done and ordained by our

inviolable firmness, and do supply all and singular defects if any happened in

ignorantly, notwithstanding the constitutions and ordinances Apostolical, and
whatsoever else to the contrary. Given at Rome at S. Peter's under the fishers

M. Vestrius Barbianus.

TO avoid all doubtful understanding of words, and here first to agree of the
issue, that when the point is debated, the difference be not found in the end
to consist only in the diverse taking of words, and in no diversity of matter:
we request leave of our Archpriest to move this one question, whether by the
foresaid asseueration, viz. that the [ Popes Breue confirmed the Cardinals
Letters, as validas ab initio, and utterly condemned and inualidated all things
done to the contrary] he meant that the said Breue did so confirm the
Cardinals Letter Constitutiue as it had force from the beginning, to bind us
under the crime of schism or enormious disobedience to accept presently of the
subordination, without delaying our submission in the manner we did, that was,
until the appearing of his Holiness Breue; or whether his meaning by the
foresaid words were only that the said Letter had an obligatiue force from the
beginning in it self, in that it was written by lawful and sufficient
authority, to wit, by special commandment of his Holiness: but yet it had
no force actually and forthwith to bind us to receive the subordination
assigned, because there wanted either some Papal instrument, or other, more
authentike proof, then the Cardinals own affirmation for testimony of such
his Holiness commandment, and grant of the particular faculties enacted. If
our Archpriest understand this latter sense in his auowance (as the cause
whereupon, and the end why he used the words, with the circumstances of both,
do all gainsay and most plainly contradict that his Reverence had any such
meaning) we assent and say the same with him, that the Popes Breue confirms
the Cardinals letter as validas ab initio, and utterly condemns and
inuali^ateth all things that from thence should happen to be attempted to the
contrary. But on the other side, if our Archpriest meant by his words, that
the Cardinals Letter Constitutiue was of force from the beginning, to bind us
to admit of the subordination appointed, without staying for further proof or
confirmation (as with no color it can be denied but that his Reverence had
this meaning, for otherwise how could he possibly declare, especially in a
public Decree, that all the Catholics in England who any way before the
coming over of the Breue had impugned his authority, were therein really
disobedient to the Sea Apostolic, and rebels against his office, and that the
Pope in his Breue declared no less by condemning utterly all things done to
the contrary, under which no doubt our prolonging must needs be implied) then
under his good leave, we must say that he is much mistaken, and offers wrong
to his Holiness, in reporting him to write, that he does not, and perhaps that
too, which in equity he could not. Or howsoever this be, yet his Reverence may
do well to tell us and the world beside, being possessed with his former charge
against us, in what words of the Breue either expressly or implicitiuely in the
said condemnation contained of all things done to the contrary? We say done,
signifying actions that passed before the promulgation of the Breue, as did our
deferring, and not actions enterprised since the publishing thereof. For as we
will most willingly grant that his Holiness annulleth all actions succeeding
the date of the Breue, attempted by whom soever: so must we agnize that we can
neither see nor conjecture in what part of the Breue, or by what words thereof
his Holiness either condemned, or taxed the actions performed before the
setting forth of the Breue.

If the Cardinals letter was of actual force to bind from the beginning, from
whence did it take vigor? It is a general proposition among Speculum de
probat. 3. nu. 15.
the Canonists, that Creditur literis cuiusque de hijs quae facere potest vel
debet ratione officij sui. Belief is to be given to every man's letters, in the
things he can, or belongs to him to do by virtue of the office he bears.
But it has been made very manifest before, that the Cardinal could not
institute such a form of government in our country by virtue either of his
Cardinalship, or Protectorship: and therefore the letter his Grace wrote for
enacting the same, was by virtue of some extraordinary jurisdiction, and not
by any quality of his foresaid dignities, and consequently the jurisdiction
being extraordinary, we were not bound to give such infallible credit, and
height of obeisance to his Honors letter, as by and by to prostrate our selves
to the subordination his Grace appointed, being alike unprofitable, imperious,
and most burdensome, before his Grace had proved the commission by other
means, then by witness of his own word. A verity so clearly showed before,
and with that force of authorities, as it were superfluous to seek to confirm
it with more.

To say the Pope has declared that the Cardinal his letters are from hence of
force, and that all things therein passed with his Holiness full knowledge and
participation, makes no more for proof of the crimes objected against us,
then the promulgation of a law does prove those to have transgressed the law,
who between the making of the law, and the promulgation thereof, committed
such acts as the said law prohibited. Which is so feeble a proof (the
promulgation being of the distinct. 4. ca. in is^is. D. Th. 1. 2. q. 90. art.
4. ca. de legibus l. leges and in authentica and omnes tum Canonistae tum
Theologi.
essence of the law, and without which the law not binding,) as none can be
weaker.

And now to come to the last part of the foresaid auowance, where our
Archpriest writes, that our proceedings even before the coming over of the
Breue were sharply condemned by the sentence of the two Illustrious Cardinals,
and also by the judgment of his Holiness. It has been showed that no such
condemnation passed upon us, either by sentence of the two Cardinals, or by the
judgment of his Holiness. And we further affirmed, that what condemnation
soever passed upon our two brethren, by sentence of the two Cardinals, yet
that, that condemnation and sentence cannot truly and properly be called the
judgment of his Holiness. For although the said Cardinals took their
authority from his Holiness of being judges in the cause of our two brethren,
nevertheless the sentence they gave was their own act and judgment, and not
the act and judgment of his Holiness, as is most ^eare by this, that their
graces were delegatine judge, in the cause, and his Holiness the Delegator.
For to delegate and to be delegated, being two distinct things, and not
competible in one person, in one and the same respect: it follows that the
sentence of the delegatine Judge or Judges, is not the sentence and judgment
of the delegator, as witnesses Decius in these words, Licet Decius in ca.
(...)rnimus de iud^ijs n. 35
delegatus habet potestatem, a delegante, tamen iudicio suo iudicare dicitur,
vt est textus in ca. Prudentiam de officio deleg. Although the Judge delegate
have his jurisdiction from the delegator, yet the judgment which he gives in
the cause committed, is his own judgment, as has the text in the Chapter
Prudentiam de offic. deleg. Which position is also manifest, in that
Appellation from the Judge delegate to the delegator, is very frequent, and
holden by Decius in rubrica. de offic de leg. nu. 5. Siluester verb. Appellatio
nu. 9. li. ff. si quis, and a quo l. praecipimus. c. de Appel.
all writers for the most orderly Appellation. Which could not be, if the
sentence of the Judge delegate were the sentence or judgment of the delegator:
for then such Appellations were from a sentence to the giver of the same,
neither fit, nor like to relieve; nor ever used, but when sentence was given
upon wrong information, and by the supremest Judge only.

The infere^ce we would make out of these is, that admitting the two Cardinals
giving sentence upon our two brethren, had inuolued and condemned us their
accomplices in the same sentence; as there is no such thing nor by justice could
be, yet their Graces giving that sentence as delegatine Judges, neither did,
nor could but make the same sentence their own sentence, and not the sentence
and judgment of his Holiness, and consequently we cannot but reckon this
auowance of our Archpriest [ that our proceedings yea before the coming of the
Breue were very grievously condemned by the judgment of his Holinesse] among
the many of the other wrongs that his Reverence has done us, unless he shall
prove the defaming assertion otherwise, and more substantially then because the
two Cardinals condemned our brethren to be banished and confined.

And to end our answer to this fifth objection brought against us, we do most
certainly assure our selves, that if his Holiness were made acquainted with
the manner and nature of things as they proceeded, he would so little give our
Archpriest and father Parsons thanks for making him the prompter or approuer
of the said sentence against our two brethren, as he might peradventure sharply
rebuke their boldness therein. For who can think that his Holiness
compassionable and bounteous nature, would not only inflict banishment and
confinement in banishment for an action lawful, yea, prescribed by the
Ecclesiastical Canons, as when Ca. Si quando de rescript.
doubt is made (as sincerely and before God we had great doubt of the Cardinals
authority to institute such a kind of powerable subordination in our Church) of
a delegates commission, then to entreat the stay of execution, till the
graunter of the commission might be advertised of the matter, and the truth
understood. Offices, which we performed: for, both we requested master
Blackwell very earnestly to forbear the absolute assuming of the authority,
with promise notwithstanding to obey him though we would not fully and
perfectly admit the subordination, before more certain knowledge came, that
his Holiness stood privy and consenting to all and every branch of the
subordination and jurisdiction granted to the Archpriest: and also made him
acquainted with our intention of sending to Rome about our doubts. Yea master
Bishop, the Sunday before he and our brother began their iourny, went to him,
renewed the petition, gave him a note under his hand and name, of the
particulars about which he meant to deal with his Holiness, and received a
counterpane or another like note of master Blackwell (which he carried to Rome
with him, and which of likelihood the Fiscall or Fa. Pars. rather, took from
him* with the other schedules, when at their apprehension he bereft them of all the writings they brought) testifying that such and such were the matters that
he went to Rome for, and to propose to his Holiness. What more plainer or honest
dealing could be desired on our part? Or what should we further add? Master
Blackwell himself, in the sixth of his twelve questions which he proposed to
us to answer unto, dated the fourteenth of May, acknowledges, that, Quod ante
suum discessum agnoscere suum Archipresbyterum visi sunt, and quod illo
conscio, and non contradicente, quamuis improbante, iter arripuerint, That both
our brethren did seem before their departure to acknowledge their Archpriest,
and that they took their journey with his priuity, and not contradicting
though not approving.

Another material evidence of disprouing that which has been objected against
us was, that when our brethren were first committed prisoners, they both took a
corporal oath, and one or both protested Agnized in the Apology fol. 130.
under the same as well for themselves as for us their associates, that if his
Holiness thought not meet to incline to our petition for changing the
subordination into some more profitable kind of government, but would ratify
or confirm that which was erected, yet that we were content and ready to yield
all obedience thereunto. We ask here again, who can think that his Holiness
compassionable and bounteous nature, would not only enjoin banishment, and
confine them in banishment, for an action of this quality, and vested with no
other circumstances, but would also beside the nature of the punishment, which
drew infamy upon their persons, and consequently sure to alienate men's minds
and charities from releeuing their necessities, not so much as contribute one
penny of maintenance* having the distribution of the fragments that remain in
the twelve baskets, Luke 9.
we mean of all the charities abounding in Gods Church, either to carry them
to the places assigned being Priests, or there to live by after their coming.
We therefore as we have said, do most confidently assure our selves, that if
his Holiness should once come to know (as we doubt not but God in time will
work it) the true story of these stratagems, that his mature consideration
will give father Parsons and our Archpriest little thanks, in making and
diuulging him to be the decreer, or director of the judgment that passed upon
our two brethren.

A Sixth reason which our adversaries form against us, and seek to vndershore
it with authority, is an argument they draw from this place of the gloss:
Octauum priuilegium quod Cardinali asserenti se In extrauag. excerabilis Ioa^.
22. de praebend. verb. sublimitatem eorum. Ca. 8 fol. 108.
legatum creditur absque literis. Did. 27. ca. nobilissimus. It is the eight
privilege of a Cardinal, that if he say he is the Popes Legate, belief is to
be given to him though he show no letters. Out of which place father Parsons in
the Apology infers, that because the superiority and jurisdiction of a
Cardinal Legate is a far greater matter, then was the authority which our
Cardinal Protector took upon him in ordaining the new subordination, and
because the assertion of a Cardinal in affirming himself the Popes Legate, is
to be credited though he show no letters for testimony thereof in regard of
the known privilege Vbi supra and fol. 114.
due in this case, to the highness of his estate, therefore our Cardinal
Protector testifying and professing to us and the whole world in his Letters
patents under his hand and public seal, that he instituted the subordination
(this authority whereby he did it being not so great as the authority of a
delegate de latere) ex speciali mandato Smi upon special commandment of his
Holiness, was to be believed without showing the Popes Letters, or making
other proof then his Graces own affirmation for the truth or testification of
the Commission.

This is the deduction and argument that father Parsons makes, and in his own
words so near as they could be used, the form and strength of the argument
not omitted. To which we answer, first, that the consequence is not good,
then, that what is alleged for fortifying the same is either false or of no
moment. For declaration. First it comes to be noted, that the words which
immediately follow in the place where fa. Parsons takes the foresaid passage,
be these* Licet aliqui hoc reuocent in dubium, albeit some doubt of this eight
privilege. And certes all men do not think, if the Pope should send a
Cardinal Legate into France or Spain, or into any other Catholic kingdom,
especially about matter disgustfull, that either of their two Majesty's most
Christian or most Catholic, would readily receive him as such a person, and
admit the execution of his office without showing the Popes letters for
testimony of the legation. Neither in show (be it spoken under leave, and with
due submission to holy Church) does such refusal deserve any great censure,
because several Steph. Papa did. 63. ca. lectis Nicholaus Papa did. 97. ca.
nobilissimus and ca. de man. prin. l. vnica.
Popes beside the demonstration of daily practice, have testified that it is
not the manner of the Apostolic Sea to receive an Embassage from any person
whatsoever without letters in the credence of the Ambassador. And therefore
that holy Sea, not accustoming to receive or believe any Ambassador without
letters from the Prince or Potentate he comes from: it seems to follow not
amiss, this action of the highest Sea being as an exampler for other, that
Kings or other temporal and supreme Magistrates are not bound to receive, and
give credit to the word of a Cardinal Legate, unless he show the Popes
letters for witness of his commission. But these notwithstanding we grant as
the truth is, that a Cardinal Legate ought to be believed upon his word,
without showing the Popes letters for testimony: yet we resolutely deny, that
a Cardinal delegate is to have the like credit given to his word in the
charge or matter committed unto him, as father Parsons infers, except he
first show the Popes letter, or otherwise prove the Commission. A verity which
has been sufficiently, if not more then enough confirmed before by diverse
authorities out of all the chiefest Page 58. 59. and sequentib.
writers new and old upon the law. Nevertheless to abound in our proofs of
this material point, we will add one authority more, and such an authority
as concludes for us and against our adversaries, whether the Cardinal
instituted the subordinatio^, as his Holiness delegate by a rescript* or as his
co^missioner by word of mouth only. Si de magno alicuius praeiudicio agatur non
creditur Cardinali testanti sibi aliquid a Papa viuae vocis oraculo ma^datum,
nec creditur ei asserenti esse delegatum nisi literis ostensis. If the question
be (says Zecchius) of a matter that is very De statu. Ill^ Cardinalium nu. 9.
verse. 6.
indomeageable to another, a Cardinal is not to be believed upon his word,
testifying that the Pope enjoined him such a commandment by word of mouth:
neither is belief to be yielded unto him, if he affirm himself a delegate,
unless he show the letters. And the author proves both parts of the
assertion, by the testimonies of sundry other writers which he there cites.

Further, beside the pleading of authority, the reason is manifest why credit
is given to the word of a Cardinal, naming himself a Legate, without showing
the Popes letters, and not to the word of a Cardinal affirming himself a
delegate, or to have received such a Commission by word of mouth, except he
show the Popes letter for testimony of the delegation, or prove the verbal
commission after a far more authentical manner then by the sole record of his
own word or missiue Letter patent or sealed.

For when the Pope sends a Legate de latere to any Prince, Zecchius de statu
Ill^i Legati nu. 2.
Country, or Province, he never sends him but with the advice and consent of
the residue of the Cardinals, which makes the mission very notorious. Again,
a Cardinal legate departing upon like occasion from the Court of Rome, takes
his dispatch and leave of his Holiness and the other Cardinals with great
solemnity, goes likewise toward the person and place assigned after a most
honorable manner of attendance, accompanied with others of rare parts* and when
he comes near to the confines of the Country or Province whereof Idem
ibidem nu. 3. and speculum de Legate. 4. superest.
he is made Legate, he aduertiseth the nighest Bishop of his approaching at
hand, who presently is to command his Clergy to give their attendance and
meet the Legate on his way coming, and to bring his Grace to the Cathedral
Church or any other that is nearer, with all suitable preparation and
entertainment. Which kind of ceremonies with other complements, do ever make
all laterall legations most aparant: but in delegations, and more in
commissions by word of mouth, there is no such solemnity nor manifestation
used: which yields a most material cause why credit is and ought to be
given to the auowance of a Cardinals affirming himself a Legate, without
showing the Popes Letters, and why the like credit is not by any bond due to
be given to the word of a Cardinal, if he affirm himself a delegate, or
shall say he received Commission from the Pope by word of mouth to do this or
that.

To put another difference between the cases, a Cardinal Legate receives the
mass or body of his authority Speculum vbi supra, nu. 14. Zecchius vbi supra.
nu. 4. Siluest. verb. Delegatus. n. 22 Cucchus lib. 1. Tit. 25. de off. and
potest leg. Staphilus eodem tit. and alij.
a lege communi from the supreme dignity and office he holds: but a
Cardinal delegate Commissioner or executor, takes not only the subject, but
the limits and specialties of his whole jurisdiction from the Popes rescript or
verbal direction, and therefore ought to prove the particular tenor by other
means then by the sole credence of his own word, especially because, as
Gloss. in ca. 1. de rescript. verb. proc^ssus.
ordinary jurisdiction, the ca. 2 de offi-Legat. li. 6.
like as is legation, is matter favorable: so all delegatine jurisdiction is
matter displeasant, or burdenous: and matter that is burdenous requires in
common reason a more full and strict proof then matter importing favor. And
further, that which makes yet the case somewhat more clear, is the received
positio^ among the Canonists, that although Pa^^rm. in ca. quod translatione^
de off. leg. nu. 10.
a Cardinal is to be counted a Legate upon his word, nevertheless if he
claim any jurisdiction more then he has from the constitutions of the law by
office of his Legateship, he is not to be believed upon his word, but must
prove his claim and saying, either by showing his commission, or by testimony
of witnesses, or after some legal manner: which makes plain in the
consequence, that where a Cardinal has not the authority he claims by
virtue of ordinary jurisdiction founded in his person as in an ordinary,
there he is not to be believed upon credence of his sole word, but must
authentically prove what he affirms ere any be bound to obey.

Which precedent differences and disparitie if father Parsons had considered,
he would never have made so ignorant inference, as he did upon the place of the
Gloss before cited: nor would he have so weakly reasoned if the subject he
wrote of had been matter of state, or belonged to the genealogy of Princes.
Yet why say we thus, since even in his book of Titles he reasons as shallowly
or more unaptly, making (forsooth) the successiue reign of two Queens
immediately one after another, a let and cause why a woman should not succeed
her Majesty in the Crown, for that as he writes, our Nation will not endure
a third Queen, meaning the old Countess of Darby who was then alive, and
aiming perchance also in the speeches at the Lady Arbella, grossly forgetting
in the mean, how the principal drift of the whole book tended to the
advancing of another title, and a forrainer of the same sex. The like feeble
reasons he also makes for discrediting the titles of other great personages.
But to proceed to answer his other former auowances in our own matter.

He affirms, that to be the Popes Legate, is a far greater case then this
of ours is, meaning the authority of Cardinal Caietane in instituting the
subordination: and we affirm that a delegate in the cause committed unto him
by his Holiness (as the instituting of the subordination was by his own words
committed to Cardinal Caietane) is of greater jurisdiction in the same cause,
then is a Legate general. And that which we say is the express law Ca.
conflituisti de off legate.
and so interpreted by the best expositors: Speculum de legato, 4. superest.
nu. 48.
Is cui aliqua causa specialiter delegatur, mayor est Legato generali quantum
ad illam. He to whom a certain cause is delegated by special commandment,
is greater in the same then is a Legate general. To which words of Durandus,
In ca 2. de offic. leg. nu. 6.
Panormitane, In ca sane 2 de offic. delegat. nu. 1.
Johannes Andreas, and Ibid nu. 1.
Felinus, most agreeably consent.

Yea we add, that the jurisdiction of Cardinal Caietane was not only
superior and greater in the cause committed, then the jurisdiction of a
Cardinal Legate in the same, if there had been any such resiant in our country,
but that the jurisdiction and authority granted unto his Grace therein was
far more ample, then custom or the constitutions of holy Church do allow to
a Cardinal Legate, as is to be seen by comparing the faculties which his Grace
subdelegated to Master Blackwell with the jurisdiction that De Legato 4
superest.
Durandus, Titut. de legato.
Staphilus, Lib. 1. de institu. iur. can. Tit. 15.
Cucchus, De statu. Ill ^ Leg. nu. 4.
Zecchius, and other that particularize these several jurisdictions ordinarily
belonging to a Cardinal Legate. For what Cardinal Legate can give authority
to an Archpriest, to remove Priests from out the houses where they are
harbored of charity, and know not how otherwhere to hide their heads? Again,
what Cardinal Legate can subdelegate authority to an Archpriest, to recall
faculties granted by the Pope himself? Jurisdictions surpassing the ordinary
authority of any Legate. But of these and some other like, more will be said
in the next reason.

Further, the religious man affirms, that the Cardinal testified and Fol.
108. and 114
professed to us and the whole world in his letters patents under his hand and
public seal, that he instituted the subordination by special commandment of
his Holiness. Alas, what needed this amplifying of words or untruths rather?
For first how can it well be verified that his Grace testified and professed so
much to us, and the whole world, when he never wrote a word of that or of any
other matter unto us, and addressed the Constitutiue Letter by name to M.
Blackwell only? Again, how can it be truly said, that he testified and
professed it in his Letters patents and under his public seal, when the
Constitutiue Letter came close sealed, according to the Roman fashion of
sealing missiue Letters with a labell? A particular which I seem very
perfectly to remember, and the more perfectly by this token, viz. that when M.
Blackwell shewwed the said letter unto me to read, he bid me beware of brusing
the seal. Which words the Letter being foulded up, and consequently the seal
not to be seen that was put too in the inside after the subscription, made me
to understand them, of the seal which I saw on the back of the letter
remaining (the labell being cut and the seal not touched when the letter was
first opened) fair in his full print or purtraite.

Notwithstanding, because our memories may deceive us, we will not stand upon
it, nor was it alleged to the end to weaken thereby the validity of the
contents of the Constitutiue Letter the force thereof Tholcsanus in Tit. de
rescript. li. 1. ca. 2. nu. 13
being one and of equal degree, whether the same came patent or close sealed.
Neither was the said Letter ever denied by any, to be the Cardinals Letter,
though we al did most assuredly a certain our selves that you father Parsons
had the sole penning thereof, and not of the Letter alone, but of the
instructions and additions also.

The only cause why we touch these, is, least some hearing the Constitutiue
Letter to be named Letters patents, may thereupon imagine it to be of such
irrefragable authority as the word signifies in the laws of our Realm. And
perchance not to unlike purpose was that added, which follows ( under his
hand and public seal) to the end that others reading the words, might
conceive the seal fixed to the Constitutiue Letter to be the seal of some
public office, and therefore great rebellion to disobey, or except against any
jot of the conte^ts. And as by these we would not deny, but that the Canonists
affirm the known seal of a Cardinal, to be an authentike seal, and to make
the conte^ts of the letter whereunto it is put, of a very reverent and singular
respect: so likewise it is certain, that the same Canonists affirm, that a
letter signed with a Cardinal his seal, co^taining matter preiudicious to
another, and received by Commission from his Holiness, ne does nor can claim
Panorm. in ca. quod super de fid^ instrument. nu. 5. and the other Authors
quoted fol.
the like sovereign credit, as the parties prejudiced, remain obliged either
by law or conscience to obey the same. Marie, that a Cardinal his seal is
called a public seal, as father Parsons phraseth it, is more (as we think)
then he ever read, or Canonist ever wrote.

But the truth of the other assertion, to wit [ the Cardinal testified and
professed to us and the whole world, that he instituted the subordination by
special commandment of his Holinesse] is more doubtful by much as being
under the check and controlment of so many, as shall happen to read the
Constitutiue Letter. For in what place thereof* can so much or half so much be
showed, unless the letter must be read with spectacles, that have virtue to
make that to appear to be written therein is not? The Cardinal only
affirms, that his Holiness enjoined him by special commandment to make
peace in our country, after the example of the peace and quietness made in
the English College at Rome. Which commission or authority to make peace, is
(unless we be infinitely deceived) a far different thing in nature, from the
authority to institute an Archpriest, with like ample and exorbitant
jurisdiction in our whole Church. Verily the proportion seems to be so
little, and the dissimilitude between the means of making peace, and it, (the
quality of the subordinatio^ and the manner of bringing it into our Church
considered) as there could well no hope be conceived of peace to follow,
through the institution of such a subordination, except we would make the
fathers of the Society our directours, and remain evermore their obseruant
pupils.

If it be replied, that the Cardinal wrote in the Letter Constitutiue, how in
decreeing the subordination, he followed the will of his Holiness: We answer,
that to follow the Popes will in doing of a thing, differs much from
receiving of a special commandment of doing the same. Neither does it
appear in the Cardinal his Letter that his grace followed the will of his
Holiness, in erecting this subordination in specie, with the jurisdiction,
faculties, and instructions adjoined: nay the contrary seemed plain, in that
his Holiness willed the Cardinal by special commandment (as his Grace
relates the words in the Constitutiue Letter) to labor the effecting and
establishing of peace in our country, which standing, his Holiness intention
and will could not be, but that such a subordination should be ordained among
us, as might most avail to the making and continuing of true peace, and in
which principal quality, the new subordination being most defective (if not
part of the faculties annexed of a quite contrary nature) what inference more
direct, then that the Cardinal only followed the will of his Holiness in the
name of a subordiuation, (a point of less moment) and not in the substance,
matter, specialties and form thereof, points incomparably more important?
Which, how imperfect a manner it is of following his Holiness will, we leave
to others to judge.

Finally, where you father Parsons do say, that his Holiness commanded the
institution of the subordination in respect of the division and dissension
raised in England between Priests and Jesuits, or Priests and Priests, we
are glad to see you to correct the defaming error (though the whole Realm
could reprove you if you did it not) which your self inserted, in the
Constitutiue Letter, making the cause of instituting the subordination, to be
dissension between the Secular Priests and the Lay Catholics. And as we are
glad of this, so may we not omit to note the policy, that you, laboring to
erect a subordination, concealed that from his Holiness which was true, and
which most needed reformation, (to wit, great dissension between Jesuits and
some secular Priests) and pretended other untrue matter, viz. strife among the
Secular Priests, and debate between them and the lay Catholics, a most
injurious calumniation. And when by this cunning finenesse of masking matters,
you had obtained your desire, that is, such a form of government as your
selves made choice of, neither comprising your brethren here, as it had been
reason it should, being the more potent part of the contenders, but in steed of
this justice and equality, made you and them in truth the electours of our
Archpriest, and our Archpriest commanded in matters of weight to seek your
judgment and advise: In the ninth instruction.
then when matters be compassed, and all things that your selves assigned, most
strongly confirmed, to agnize or color the former untruth (which as it seems
could not be but a studied falsehood) by rehearsing many distinctiue causes, is
proof of wit, and the more, by doing it in such a language, as those who by
authority ought most to punish and remedy the fault, cannot understand the
abuse.

For concluding our answer to this sixth objection, we say no more but wish
the Composer to arm himself with patience, by considering these words of holy
Scripture, qui inconsideratus est ad loquendum Proverb. 13.
sentiet mala: He that is in considerate in his speeches against another, must
not think but to feel the rebukes due unto his folly.

A Seventh objection which our adversaries allege against us, is, that we
being the persons, who In the Apology. fol. 101.
went about to erect sodalities, to Ibidem fol. 105.
ordain new associations, to Ibid. fol. 90.
make a certain government among our selves without consent, counsel, or
notice of any Superiors, and this to the prejudice of others (the most part of
our brethren reclaiming and misliking the same.) And were Ibid. fol. 100
so seruent in this point to have a subordination and government among our
selves, as without all superiors authority we would have set up our
association: Did nevertheless Ibid fol. 104
when the institution of the Archpriest came into England, and was promulgated
by the prudent and godly letters of the Protector, and ordained for
conservation of peace by the highest authority that is upon earth, begin
(having resolved to be unquiet) first to stagger and doubt, and then to
discuss our superiors commandment, and lastly to contemn it. Which sin of
ours ^n the letter of the six Assist^nts to the Nuncio in Fla^ders, 2. of May
1601.. 7.
can no where else be placed, but in the highest greece of disobedience, seeing
it was committed against the supreme Pontifex himself, and against the
dignity of the whole Roman Court. The objection is laid down in their own
words, as it is to be seen in the places quoted, neither have we wittingly
omitted ought, that themselves add of weight to this purpose. And now to
answer directly hereunto.

First we acknowledge, that some of our company went about (though after, and
not with like fervor, as M. Standish now an Assistant did, being the first
motioner of the matter and chief prosecutor) to erect a sodalitie of such as
would give willingly their word and names to observe certain rules that should
be agreed upon and deemed fit for the good of themselves, and many other,
during the present state of things. The cause of this project, were certain
hard speeches which some indiscreete persons (either the too zealous followers
of the society, or some of the fathers themselves, or both gave forth, against
the secular Priests in general, that they liked not to live under obedience,
or to have other Superiors then the direction of their own wills. Which report
(put away the working of diseased humors) grew chiefly and outwardly of this
cause, for that many of our brethren in Wisbich refused to accept father Weston
to their Superior* and to accept such orders as he the said father Weston and
his party (whereof many were secret Jesuits, and none so ancient either in
years or in sufferance for the cause, as were sundry of the other side, and of
lesser talents also,) thought fit to appoint. To remove this exception, and to
let the authors of the report to see in our deeds, that we were no such
worshippers of our own wills, nor so auerted from the duties of obedience, but
that we would in the degree that becommed secular Priests, both relinquish the
one, and bind our selves to the other, and also to give helps and provocation
to our nature (dull by inheritance) of going the more forward in virtue, we
thought good, if not necessary, to unite our selves and agree upon some
certain rules, and choice of a superior, for the better observing of
discipline and the said rules.

The rules that were set down to be observed by the sodality intended, were
first some eighteen (as M. Standish can record, who taking them to translate,
showed them to fa. Garnet, and not unlike, to other of the society) containing
chiefly, matter of increasing sociall and mutual love: and this not only
between Priests that should be of the sodalitie, but between them and all
Priests, as the rules themselves yet extant in the first draught can witness:
namely of surnishing Priests at their first coming: of releeuing the needs of
other, especially of prisoners and persons fallen into trouble, or decayed for
harboring of Priests: of preaching monthly or catechizing weekly: of
aduenturing upon any danger for saving or comforting a soul in extreme
necessity, being requested thereunto: of disliking no one, for not being of
the sodalitie: of declining al such occasions as might breed variance with
others, especially with the fathers of the society, and if any like cause be
offered by them, to acquaint the superior of the sodalitie with it, that he
might forthwith, before the matter grew to head, or be known to many, confer
with the Superior of the society for redress, and a charitable end of the
difference: of spending daily some time in meditation, or in reading some
spiritual book: of conferring about difficult and intricate cases, and never
upon his own judgment to resolve such, without taking the advice of other his
brethren: of making a general confession every half year, for the half
year past, and of other like points. And none of all the rules to bind under
mortal sin, save only, that the superior should not incorporate, or vow
himself a member of another body, before such time as he had relinquished the
office. If they of the North not knowing what we had done in the South, drew
other rules, or more, what skilled that, since they stood contented to accept of
those rules which most voices should approve, and ours of the South, not
theirs of the North were approved?

And now, this being the design intended, the cause why it was intended, and
the breuiate of the rules, we ask the six Assistants, that sent the letter of
information to his Holiness Nuncio in Flaunders against us, we ask father
Parsons the writer of the Apology, and (so far as in duty we may) we ask
also their superiors, by whose allowance the said Apology was printed, what
it was, that was so greatly amiss, either in the circumstances, or nature of
the design, as might deserve the reproaches, which the said letter to his
Holiness Nuncio lays upon us, for having such a purpose?

When the matter was broken to father Garnet, for understanding his liking and
opinion in the same: he answered, that it was the best thing which was taken in
hand in all this Queens time, if it could be effected. Likewise when the
affair was communicated to father Weston, he seemed to like it very well. And
if they have since changed their minds, yet we request father Parsons (the
maker of the Apology) and ou^ Archpriest (the allower of the printing thereof
and of the Appendix) to show the reason why they term the setting down of
For. 7^.
Rules in Wisbich by the eighteen Priests, and the electing of father Weston

a holy and quiet purpose, and so Fol. 90.
mainely deprave and condemn the sodalitie we intended, whereas the rules of

more easy or commodious, nor more Fol. 72.
auance honest, and civil conversation among those that should live under the
orders (the qualities which the Apology attributes to the said rules) then
were the rules of the sodalitie we went about to make, and perhaps not equal
to ours in the foresaid qualities, and incomparably behind ours in other
respects, more general, and releeuing the distressed.

Or howsoever their rules exceeded ours in goodness, or ours theirs in that, and
in forwarding a common good, yet it cannot be denied, but that we, who
labored, or rather proposed the instituting of a soliditie, did surpass them
in this one point, viz. in desisting from prosecuting M. Blackwell, M. D.
Bauine, and M. Tiruit.
our purpose, as soon as we first understood that some two or three of our
brethren misliked our endeavors, holding it for more charity to surceasse that
for peace and quietness sake, which might occasion good to our selves and
others, then by proceeding in a matter we were not bound too, to kindle the ire
or emulation of a few. The like, if the greater and better part of the
prisoners in Wisbich (for so our Archpriest and father Parsons styleth them)
had been pleased to have done, as by no persuasion they could be brought unto:
O Lord, what tumults, what broiles, what scandal, what infinite detraction had
there been left vncommitted? And it is worth the labor to note, who they were
that principally opposed themselves against the institution of the sodalitie,
albeit none were to be of that company, but with their own liking and
entreaty.

Doctor Bauen the senior Assistant, stood so stiffly opposite against the
introduction of the sodalitie or association, as he let not to affirm when
his opinion was asked therein, that if the Pope should appoint a Bishop in our
country, during the present state of matters, he would be one that should
resist, and inform his Holiness of the inconvenience and hurt, which the
bringing in of such authority would work in our Country. And M. Blackwell
only of all the Priests in our country, wrote certain reasons in dislike and
condemnation of the Sodalitie: to wit, that as by the rules of Physic and
Philosophy, it was no wisdom for any, who had a long while kept their health
by living in such an air, or by feeding on such meats after to change the
same air, or alter their customarie diet: and as it is a dangerous error in
civil policy to seek to change the form of government, under which they
have enjoyed long peace and happiness: so is it folly, or great temeritie,
having lived so many years in peace and quietness in our Country, as we
have, without any association, or other superior, to begin now to set up new
authorities, and bring in innouations. Yea he added further, how unfit, how
unprofitable, and how prejudicial it was for any one person to take upon him
the Ecclesiastical government in our Country, and that if he lived to the
change of Religion, he would deal for dividing the Bishoprics into more
Diocesses. Which reasons concluding directly and most strongly against the new
authority, were anon of likelihood either soon forgot, or began to appear of
no force when himself was chosen Archpriest.

In like manner, when father Parsons last traveled from Spain to Rome, he so
greatly disliked the making of a superior in England among the secular Priests,
as he made it the ordinary subject of his talk during the whole journey,
devising more and new reasons daily for remonstrance Inconstancy in the Noter
of inco^stancy.
and proof of the inconveniences. But after his arrival in Rome, and
conference with M. Standish and father Baldwine (whom father Garnet had
employed as his agents in the business unto him) he soon altered his mind,
understanding of like, by intelligence from father Garnet, how probable it was,
that in short time the Priests would agree upon some form of government, and
therefore it imported him with speed to prevent our intentions, least we happened
in the mean, to make choice, of a kind of government and governor which would
impeach their designs, and make way to the diminishing of the reputation they
now carried in our Country, which was and is the swaying of all things as
themselves think meet.

Neither is it unlike, the thing being constantly auerred by many, but that
father Garnet sent father Parsons notice of the man whom he should promote, and
of the authority and particular jurisdiction which he should procure unto him
over us. Hence came that place of Scripture into father Parsons head, together
with his analogicall exposition. Act. 6.
Crescente numero discipulorum, factum est murmur Graecorum aduersus Hebraeos,
etc. When the multitude of Priests increased, and the former spirit in many
of them decreased, there began presently murmuration and emulation against the
fathers of the society. Hence proceeded the manifold and long faction laid
down in the eight Chapter of the Apology, where father Parsons cunningly
fashioneth a narration lasting for four of the first leaves, but with addition
of more untruths then he used full points in the tale. Hence suddenly arose an
urgent, or as it were, a fatal necessity in fa. Parsons conceit, of making a
Superior in England over the secular Priests, an affair which himself a
little before in his journey from Spain to Rome (as has been said) spoke so
much Lo, the deceiving and presuming nature of the man. (o) Fol. 100.
and often against, and from prosecution whereof, himself advised us by M.
Champney to desist, as from a matter of contention. Hence finally are the words
of the Apology, o It seemed in all good men's opinion (and in the Jesuits
above the rest) that the only or chief remedy of avoiding murmuration and
emulation in the secular Priests, against the fathers of the society, would be
to have a subordination of the secular Priests among them selves, whereby the
fathers of the Society might remain forth of all occasion of contention. Good
Lord must the taking away of emulation and heart-burnings in the secular
Priests against the fathers of the Society, be made the motive and end why
this subordination was instituted? Who can believe it, that shall look into
the particulars? or who will not but auow the contrary, that shall consider how
and by whom the same was procured? For is it likely or possible in reason, that
that kind of subordination should extinguish emulation, or make agreement, or
not increase m^rmur and debate, which the more principal and oppressing party
in the contention should devise, and get to be ordained without consent or
notice of the other party that suffered the oppression? And who we pray,
plotted this kind of subordination but father Garnet and father Parsons? Who
nominated the Archpriest but they? Who devised the jurisdiction but they? Who
framed the authority? who annexed the instructions? who made the additions?
who chose the assistants but they? Who conferred with Cardinal Caietane? who
informed his Holiness? who procured the confirmation, but father Parsons only,
or such as himself did set on work, and put in their mouths what they should
say? In brief, who ever had part, voice, or consent in any point belonging to
the particulars of the subordination, save these two, and perhaps some other
few of their consorts, whom they thought good to acquaint with the affair?

And this which we say, is so clear to every one that will not blind his own
understanding as the Sun when it shines. Nevertheless if witnesses be
demanded at our hands, we will name no other but father Garnet and father
Parsons themselves, having their own words for testimony. For when father
Garnet asked M. John Benn^t for his name to olim dicebamur, that is, as has
been signified before, to a pretensed Page 50.
letter of thanksgiving to his Holiness, for institution of the authority,
and seeing him to be unwilling to give his name, told him that the
subordination was the fact and prosecution of father Parsons his old friend,
and therefore stood assured he would not deny the grant of putting too his
name. Likewise father Parsons in his speeches with M. Charnock at Rome among
other things freely acknowledged, that hearing how we went about in England to
make a superior among our selves, he thought it wisdom to prevent the
effecting of such our endeavors, by choosing and promoting one to the room
whom they knew to be their friend, and would comply with them. But why stand we
about the proof of these? the apparent managing of the affair, the condition
of the particulars, the manner of the process, the nature of the
circumstances* the ground, the end, the scope, and all other accessaries being
more evident then boldness (we will not say impudency) it self can deny?

Neither was this form of government, devised only by the foresaid pair of
fathers, and by their means brought vnweetingly upon us, but they keep
themselves evermore close at the stern directing, ruling, prescribing,
guiding, as universally and absolutely, as if themselves were the Archpriest or
any other higher superior over us. And whether now this kind of subordination
thus plotted, thus effected, thus executed, thus continually carried against us,
be the only or chief remedy (as father Parsons auoweth) of avoiding
murmuration and emulation in the secular Priests against the fathers of the
Society, and whereby they might remain forth of all occasion of contention,
this we leave to the indifferent to judge, the contrary appearing plainer to
us, then that any doubt can be made thereof. But to return.

We ask of father Parsons and the six Assistants, who seem to have beaten
their wits for finding matter wherein and how to condemn us, whether by seeking
to unite and provoke our selves to virtue through the erecting of a Sodalitie,
among such only, as should like and desire to be thereof, we became thereby
obliged in conscience to accept of any subordination which himself and his
consorts should by wrong and sinister suggestion, get to be proposed or
ordained against us? If they say yea, it rests, that they prove the bond, a
work impossible: or if they say no, then why does he in the Apology, and the
other in Ca. 1. 6. and ^.
their letter to the Nuncio in Flaunders of the second of May, dilate as they
do, and so injuriously infer thereof against us? It has been enough and
enough declared before, that we were not bound to admit the subordination upon
credence of the Cardinals Letter, and being not bound by any virtue of the said
Letter, we trow, our travels to make a sodalitie, did not bind us thereunto: if
so, they had not been broken off as they were, before the institution of the
subordination, and we all conjoined in the sympathy or mutual embracing of
one desire to sue to his Holiness for obtaining of Bishops in our country. We
say no more, but that if father Parsons or the six Assistants had stood so
indifferently inclined to favor our atte^pts in going about to ordain a
Sodalitie, as he shows himself prone and ready not only to excuse, but to
commend and justify the league and orders of the Agency begun and prosecuted
in the Castle of Wishich, calling the same Fol. 66.
a congregation according to the fashion and example of those private
congregations of our Lady, allowed by the Sea Apostolic in diverse Countries:
no doubt both he and they, had lessened their account in the day of their
doom, when they must answer for the wrongs they do us.

Touching the prejudice which by instituting the Sodalitie should be intended
to others, we would feign know, what prejudice that could be in particular,
when every man was lef^ free to his own choice, and no one to be misliked if he
would not be a member thereof, and others tied by a new obligation to love,
reverence, and stead him wherein they could. Neither do we take it to be true,
that the most part of our brethren did reclaim and mislike the institution of
the Sodalitie, as may be gathered by the small number of those that manifested
their dislike, being as we have said before, but very few, three only of note,
M. Doctor Bauen, M. Blackwell, and M. Tirwit, and by the company of those that
expressed their good liking thereof, which were more the^ 20. times so many as
those that impugned the same, by the account and reckord of such as negociated
the affair, and dealt with others for understanding their affection or
aue^sion therein.

To that wherewith the objection charge us, that [ when the institution of
the Archpriest came into England, and was promulgated by the prudent and godly
letters of the Protector, we (having resolved to be unquiet) began first to
stagger and doubt, and then to dis^usse our Superiors commandment and lastly
to contemn it:] we answer, that if the Cardinals Letter had been the Popes
Letter, or an Apostolical Breue or Bull, as it was not, and the degrees of
belief due to the one exceedingly surmounting the degrees due to the other,
yet doubting as we did, or truer, being right assured as we were in our own
understanding, that the said Letter was procured by surreption or obreption, or
both; what fault was it in us to stagger and doubt, and discuss our Superiors
commandment, when no writer ancient nor modern, but holds the same for most
lawful? Institut. moral. p. 1. li. 5. ca. 14. quaeritur. 4.
Non negamus literas Apostolicas recognosci quidem and discuti debere, cum sint
dubiae. sint n^^ne subreptitiae an legitimae. It is not to be denied (writes
Azore) but that Apostolical Letters may and ought to be considered of and
discussed, when they appear doubtful, whether they were procured by wrong or
right information. And the same Author in another place has these words, Idem
ibidem quaeritur 7.
Fas est etiam Laico de literis pontificijs cum dubiae sint and incertae, ^ona
side probabiliter, ambigere, disputareve. sint n^^ne Pontificiae, sint ne^ne
subreptitiae. It is lawful, even for a lay man, having no corrupt intention,
probably to question and dispute, whether the Popes letters appearing doubtful
and uncertain, were indeed his Leters, or gotten by surreption.

Again, the Canonists note many things which may be opposed against the Popes
Bull, and Rebussus in p^axi. Tit. Quae apponi possunt contra Bullam.
Rebuffus puts down 29. exceptions, whereof some, if they be found in the
Bull, cannot be salued, but do utterly inualidate and frustrate the same: some
other that may be amended, and the Bull after to be of force. Now if it were
unlawful (as father Parsons makes it to be (though all the learned besides
himself do with one voice witness the contrary) to scanne and discuss the
Popes Bull, how should the said defects or matter of exception be opposed? And
if this liberty be granted against the Popes Bull, or Apostolical Letters,
no doubt, the same freedom or much greater, is allowed against a Cardinals
Letter, instituting a strange subordination afflictiue and most rigorous. But
the father would have us (and we commend his wit therein) to practice perfect
obedience, that is, as Divines teach, D. Tho secunda secundae q. 104. art. 5.
D. Bonaue^. q vlt. Durandus q. 4. Cordubensis in exposit. Regulae ca. 10. q. 2.
Valetia To. 3 disp. 7. q. 3 punct. 2. Angles. par. 2. in secundu^. lib. Sent.

not only promptly and readily to do whatsoever we are commanded* without
considering the authority or end of the Commander, but to prevent also the
commandment of our Superior in all things wherein we know before, his will
or pleasure. And yet, if we should follow the fathers exhortation in this
point, and not content our selves with performing the obedience we are bound
too, and which D. Tho. vbi supra ad tertiu^.
suffices under tie of sin, we do not see, how, showing this perfect
obedience, we ought to have admitted the subordmation, because the Extrauagant
Iniunctae, and the Paulus 3. Constable. quae incipit, cum nobis. Julius 2.
Constitut. quae incipit, Romani Pontificis. Julius 3 consiit quae incipit,
Sanctissimus.
constitutions of other Popes do forbid to receive any such superior Prelate
to the office, and dignity he claims, without sight of the Popes Letter for
testimony of such his grant, and the parties promotion. Neither can that in
truth be called perfect obedience, but rather indiscreet and sinful, which
transgresses the ordinances of holy Church, as undoubtedly we should have
done, had we received M. Blackwell to the office of the Archpresbytership,
before the showing of the Popes Letters for his preferment thereunto.

No doubt* but the utter face of the persuasion which the sons of Jacob used
to Sichem, was good and holy, as being the act of Circumcision, Genesis 34.
the chiefest Sacrament of the old law, yet Sichems obedience thereunto, was
the cause of his death, and of the slaughter of many mo. Again, if we look
upon the outside of David's counsel to Vrias, in 2. Reg. 11.
exhorting him to take his ease after his wearisome journey, there appears
naught but goodwill and kindness, and yet David had a subtle fetch therein,
and more respected his own good in the counsel, then he did the welfare of
Vrias. Neither did the enemy of mankind, let to candie and cloak his
persuasion to our unfortunate mother Eve, with an outward show of godliness,
Eritis sicut Dij scientes bonum Genesis 3.
and malum: Ye shall be as Gods, knowing good and evil: but what drift he had
therein, all her posterity feels. We know, how excellent a virtue obedience
is, especially that kind which father Parsons would have us to practice, and
which spiritual writers call, Caecam obedientiam, blind obedience, for that it
closes the eye of our will, and leads the judgment of our understanding, as
the guide leads the blind man, agreeable to this saying of S. Gregory: Vera
obedientia nec Praepositorum Li. 2 ca. q. in li. 1. Reg.
intentionem discutit, nec praecepta discernit, quia qui omne vitae suae
studium maiori subdidit, in hoc solo gaudet, si quod sibi praecipitur,
operatur. Nescit enim iudicare, quisquis perfect didicerit obedire. True
obedience neither discusseth the intention of his Prepositors, neither scanneth
their commandments, because he that has subjected the whole course of his
life to the direction of his superior, ioyeth only in this, if he do as he is
commannded. For he knows not to judge, that has perfectly learned to obey.

But as we wot the thing that father Parsons counsels us too, to be right
good in it self, being the perfection of the D. Tho. 2. 2. q. 104. art. 3.
worthiest of al other moral virtues: so do we fear, least he seek therein
the increase of sovereignty, and absolutely without contradiction to rule in
our Country, as already he has not blushed to vaunt himself of the command
he holds in England (we speak from report of an eye and ear witness) as
well over many of the Laity, as of the Clergy, which vain brag he would
easily make good with advantage, could he once bring us to a blind kind of
obedience, neither to discuss the commandments of our Archpriest, whom he
directs in all things, nor the ordinance of any other superior, upon what
false information soever the same was enacted. Volo vos sapientes esse in bono,
and simplices Romans 16.
in malo: I would have you (says the Apostle) to be wise in good, and simple
in ill. Which God of his mercies make true in father Parsons, and in us all.

Concerning the other part of the charge, that having resolved to be unquiet,
we would not desist, till lastly we fell to contemn our superiors
commandment. Here we have good cause to ask father Parsons how he knew, being
no Prophet, nor the son of a Prophet, that we had resolved to be unquiet, for
so much was neither written in our foreheads, nor manifested in the nature of
our actions, doing nothing (as we have often said) more then what the Canons
and constitutions of holy Church, and the uniform consent of all writers allow
and direct. But notwithstanding the justness of the cause, we will not trouble
him with this demand, having another question of more weight to be assoiled,
viz. that he tell us and the world, unless we and the world must hold him for
more then a vain speaker, wherein and how we contemned the commandment of our
Superiors, that is (as Divines and the Summists write) in a thing D. Tho. 2. 2.

we were bound to obey them, and did not obey the^, for this respect only,
because we would not be subject to their commandments. A slander which he nor
our adversaries shall ever be able to prove, and not proving, we trust he will
make conscience to reuerse the words, as he must needs if he love his soul:
and the sooner if by the gradation and form of speech he used, he intended to
give aim to the Reader of our nigh approaching or perfect arriual to that
degree of sin which the holy Ghost mentioned by the pen of Solomon. Impius cum
in profundum venerit peccatorum contemnit: When the wicked is sunk to the
depth of mischief, he contemns the commandments of Almighty God, and of
his Deputies upon earth.

Finally, touching the remnant of the objection unanswered, to wit, that our
sin [in refusing to subject our selves to ^he new subordination before it was
witnessed or approved by his Holiness Breue] can no where else be placed, but
in the highest greece of disobedience, seeing it was committed against the
supreme Pont^fex himself, and against the dignity of the whole Roman Court:
We refer the Reader (the assertion being most ignorant and vncolourable) to
that which has been said before Page 29. and sequen ^ib.
in our second Reason, and Page 85 and 86
in our answer to our adversaries third objection, and to that which God
willing, we shall hereafter touch in both the Reasons that follow.

AN eight objection or shift which our oppositours devise for maintaining their
feeble assertions, and for finding a way out of the straites, which their
afterwits saw, would mightily enuiron them, if they should still hold and
maintain Our Archpriest in his letters in the 8. and 17. of August, see page 67.
as they did at first, the subordination to be the act and ordinance of our
Cardinal Protector, because to acknowledge this much, did and would ever most
hardly rub upon them, either to show the rescript of his Holiness delegation
to the Cardinal, or to prove his Holiness verbal Commission unto him, or
drive them to recall (unless they should show themselves of worse conscience
then they seem to be) the temerarious and too too uncharitable censures which
they had most wrongfully laid upon us, and dinulged every where, for not
yielding our obedience (no law nor rules of conscience binding us thereunto,
without proof first made in that behalf of the Cardinals authority) to M.
Blackwell upon view of the Constitutiue Letter: to correct this error, father
Parsons in the bill of complaint, which M. Haddocke and M. Martin Array
exhibited to Cardinal Caietane, and Cardinal Burghesio the tenth of January
1599 against M. Bishop and M. Charnocke, affirms his Holiness to be the
institutor of the subordination, and the Cardinal a witnesse-bearer thereof.
His words in the foresaid bill are these:. 1.
Cum Smu^ D. N. hierarchiam quandam Sacerdotum saecularium inter se sub vno
Archipraesbytero and duodecim Assistentibus per Illmi Cardinalis Protectoris
Literas ordinasset:. 2.
statim atque D. Georgius Blackwellus Archipresbyter constitutus, authoritatem
suam Illmi Cadinalis Caietani literis testatam, Roma transmissam, perhumaniter
vocauit ad se duos, ijsque exposuit quid sua S^a^ instituisset, etc. When his
Holiness had ordained by the letters of the most Illustrious Cardinal
Protector, a certain Hierarchy of Secular Priests among themselves, under one
Archpriest and twelve Assistants, and as soon as M. George Blackwell was made
Archpriest, and had received his authority from Rome, testified by the Letters
of the most Illustrious Cardinal Caietane, he courteously invited two Priests
to come unto him, and declared what his Holiness had instituted, etc. Moreover,
our said adversary, as he wrote these words in the names of master D. Haddocke
and M. Martin Array, so keeping his old wont still, to mask and vent his
untruths under the persons of other men, comes in his Preface to the Appendix
(set forth as he gloseth by the Priests that remain in due obedience to their
lawful Supeiour,) to interlace his short notes by way of parenthesises upon
his Holiness Breue, being of his own procuring and suggestion of the points. The
words of the Breue and his parenthesis are these: Vos filij praesbyteri qui
libenter institutum a nobis Archipraesbyterum suscepistis, valde in Domino
commendamus, etc. You Priests that did receive willingly the Archpriest
appointed by us (mark how he says not that he was instituted by the Cardinal,
but by himself) we do highly commend you.

Which passages, seeming so to auow the subordination to be the act of his
Holiness, as the Cardinal was but a witness, or at most, a mere Excecutor
thereof, do, no doubt, if they were true, much weaken part of that which has
been alleged before, as showing it to be spoken besides the matter. But let us
examine the truth of the assertio^s by the tenor and self words of the
Constitutiue Letter, the rule and only touchstone for trial of the premises.
And to cite but one place of many for avoiding tediousness.

Cum igitur non parum, etc. Since therefore some men think, that it would not a
little avail to the procuring of peace and concord, if a subordination were
constituted among the English Priests, and the reasons yielded by the Priests
themselves for the same matter, were approved by our holy Father: we following
the most pious and prudent will of his Holiness, have decreed to ordain the
same, and for directing and governing the Priests of the English nation that
now converse in the kingdoms of England or Scotland, or shall hereafter reside
there, whiles this our ordination shall continue, we choose you, to whom for the
time we commit our steed and office, induced upon relation and the public
fame of your virtue, learning, wisdom, and labors taken for many years in
the trimming of this vineyard. And the faculties which for this purpose we
grant unto you, are these: First, that you have the title and authority of an
Archpriest over all the Seminary secular Priests, to direct, admonish,
reprehend, or also chastise them when need shall require: and this, either by
abridging or taking away their faculties.

Now let the indifferent judge whether the Constitutiue Letter does more show
his Holiness or the Cardinal to be the institutor of the Subordination, or
whether it conuinceth not, that the Cardinal had a greater part in the
institution thereof, then the part of a witness or of an Executor only.

The Cardinal writes to M. Blackwell: We choose and substitute you to be our
vicegerent. Ours (says the Cardinal) not the Popes. In what? In directing and
governing the English Priests. Where? In the kingdoms of England or Scotland.
How long? So long as this our ordination shall endure. Ours, again, not the
Popes. Upon what cause? Induced thereunto (mark who was induced, and
consequently who elected the Archpriest,) by the common brute of your virtue,
erudition, prudence, and the long continuance of your labors, to the splendour
of the English Church. To what end? To direct, admonish, and correct the
seminary secular Priests. In what sort? By restraining or taking away their
faculties. Who gives him this power and jurisdiction over his brethren? The
faculties which for this purpose, we (says the Cardinal, not the Pope) grant
unto you, are these. Ergo the Cardinal was more then a witnesser of the
subordination, because a witnesser has no authority to delegate. And as
little can the executor call the fact of his superior his own ordination, or
yield the reason why he made choice of such a deputy, as the Cardinal does
both. Because as 2 p. Consil. Cons. 11. nu. 4.
Panormitane writes, and other Glossan ca. super Quaestionum de off. Deleg.
Silu^st. ver. Executor nu. 1. Fumus ^od. v^r. nu. 1. and in l. Executorem. c.
de exec. rei iud.
authors agree in the same: Executor est ille, qui habet nudum ministerium
facti, in exequendo dispositum per alium. He is called an Executor that has
the bare ministry of a fact, in executing things disposed by an other, that
is, as the same Author interprets in another place, In ca. super Quaestionum
de off. Deleg. nu. 10.
his Superior.

Again the Cardinal writes: We following the will of his Holiness, have
decreed to ordain the subordination. Ergo if the Cardinal decreed it, as
himself affirms, he was more undoubtedly then a witnesser or an Executor
thereof: and giving authority to the Archpriest to dispose of secular Priests
in our Country, to remove and change them from one residence to another, to
hear and determine their doubts* with other like faculties, which without
question are the substance, the principal part, the very sinews, heart, and
life of the Subordination: it follows of necessity, that his Grace carried
another person in instituting the subordination, then the person of a witness
or an Executor only.

Furthermore if his Grace decreed the subordination, as nothing can be plainer
spoken by himself, then that he did, he either decreed it without authority,
which we trust our adversaries will not grant; or by authority from his
Holiness: because neither of his two titles, either of being Cardinal, or of
being our Protector, did give him sufficient jurisdiction to institute so rare,
ample, and sovereign superiority over us. And if by authority from his
Holiness, then we have what our adversaries would seem to fly from, and
Throughout the second Reason and in the beginning of the third.
all the authorities before quoted do stand in full force against the^, in
respect that that which is in this sort done by the authority of another, is a
delegatine act, and binds the doer to show or prove the commission ere he can
compel belief or obeisance in the process: Gloss. general. in ca. Si eu^ de
Praebe^d. li. 6.
verbum [authoritate nostra] inducit actum delegationis. The word [ by our
authoritie] induces an act of delegation. And that the Cardinal did choose M.
Blackwell to be Archpriest, by authority and commission from his Holiness, it
is witnessed Of the 17. of August. 1601: Note the wresting sincerity of the man.
in the new Breue (even whence father Parsons culled the sentence in which he
inserted his pare^thesis above mentioned) where the words are these, Habita iam
a biennio super hac re, matura deliberatione, bonae memoriae Henrico
Praesbytero Cardinali Caietano nuncupato nationis Angloru^ Protectori,
co^misimus, vt viru^ alique^ probu^, qui hoc onus ad communem Catholicorum
vtilitatem posset sustinere delegeret, eumque Archipraesbyterum eiusdem Regni
Angliae authoritate nostra constitucret. Having had mature deliberation for two
years space of this matter, we gave commission to Henry Presbyter, Cardinal
Caietane of good memory, that he should choose some honest man who might bear
this burden to the common profit of Catholics, and by our authority
constitute him Archpriest of the same kingdom of England.

Or why stand we to prove this evident truth by the testimony of his Holiness
Breue, when father Parsons the drawer of the forefaid Bill of complaint against
our two brethren, and the markeman and inserter of the parenthesis,
acknowledges both in the Fol. 7.
first and in the Fol. 99.
eight Chapter of the Apology, that the Cardinal instituted the Archpriest by
commission from his Holiness. His words in the first place are: his Holiness
gave full commission to Cardinal Caietane the Protector to appoint the same
(viz. a government) with convenient instructions, which he presently did. And
in the second these: his Holiness committed the institution of the matter
(that is, of instituting an Archpriest) by special order to the Protector to
be done in his name. Which auowances of father Parsons, whether they be true or
not true in themselves (as true they cannot be, if Signior Acrisio Fol. 139.
and 121.
the Popes Commissarie and Canon of S. John Laterans, as he styleth him, be a
true man in his word, for he told our two brethren remaining in prison, that
the subordination was not the commandment of his Holiness, as his Holiness
himself newly affirmed unto him, adding for reason, as it has been Page 34.
before specified, that his Holiness durst not command it for fear of having
his censures contemned by the Priests in England) yet they manifest thus much,
that even by his own confession the Cardinal was the institutor of the
Subordination.

And now if we add to these, what it is to delegate, and who is a Delegate,
there can (we hope) remain no doubt, but that the Cardinal was the Popes
delegate in the erecting of the subordination, and by consequence not such a
bare publisher and witnesser thereof, as our adversaries would feign have him to
be, for ridding themselves out of some narrow straits, by reason of the
authorities aforegoing, that otherwise press exceedingly and ineuitably upon
them, and as clearly excuse us of all blame for not surrendering our obedience
to M. Blackwel upon view of the Cardinals letters, before either his Holiness
had ratified the fact, or given notice unto us of such his pleasure, or the
Cardinal proved his commission after some authentike or legal manner. Of
which, no one was done, so long as we bore off, and so soon, as to our
knowledge either was done, we presently submitted our selves. In rubri. de off.
deleg. nu. 13 l. delegar^ff. de nouationibus.
Delegare est vice sua alium dare: to delegate (says Decius) is to appoint
another in his stead. Siluest. verbo Delegatus. nu. 1.
Delegatus quoad ecclesiasticos, est is ^ui a summo Po^tifice vel ordinario,
causa committitur, aut ab eo, qui extraordinaria jurisdiction aliquid potest.
A delegate, as the word appertains to ecclesiastical persons, is he, to whom
a cause is committed by the Pope or Ordinary, or by him, who through
extraordinary jurisdiction can delegate or appoint that charge to another.

By which definitions it is very apparent (the tenor of the Constitutiue
Letter, the words of the Breue, and what father Parsons himself acknowledges
in the Apology, considered) that the Cardinal Protector was his Holiness
delegate in erecting of the subordination, and consequently we not bound (as it
has been often said) to obey his Grace, till such time as he showed the
rescript of the delegation, or proved his Holiness verbal commission, giving
him authority to delegate the like ample and extrauagant jurisdiction to the
Archpriest, as is specified in the Constitutiue Letter.

Neither are the distresses of our adversaries relieved a whit, if they should
contend (as what untruth is there, which will and wit cannot in some sort
flourish over) that the Cardinal was but an Executor in the institution of the
subordinatio^, because Doct de rota decis. nou. de off. Dele. decis. 6. n. 2

every Executor is a delegate, and his authority delegatine: and therefore not
to be obeyed, unless he prove the commission and the tenor. And besides the
authorities Page 58. and sequentibus.

the civil law, and recorded by In compend. Resolut. verbo Executor.
Brunorus, makes the case plain, and confirms abundantly. Executori,
dicenti se potestatem habere ad exequendum ex mandato principis, non creditur
sine literis, nec sufficit exhibere literarum transumptum sed originale
exhiberi debet: Belief is not to be given to an Executor, affirming himself to
have authority to execute by the commandment of the Prince, without showing
his letters: nor is it enough to show the transumpt or copy of the letters,
but he ought to show the original. Neither is the force of the authorities
avoided, in that the Executor was a Cardinal, because in matters of like
damage no one is bound to believe and subject himself upon the sole word of a
Cardinal, as Panormitane, Felinus, Alexander de Imola, Antonius de Butrio,
Benedictus Valdus, the Doctors of the Rota, Navarre, Siluester, Zecchius,
Lancellotus, Conradus, Bartolus, Jason, with others Page 60. 61. 62. 66. 89.
before cited do teach, and no author impugnes, that we can learn of.

There be other objections which our adversaries make, as that none but a few
women adhere in opinion unto us, Father Holtby in his discourse of the last of
lune.
that we cannot pretend ignorance, nor except against the sufficientnesse of
the promulgation, and such like, not worth the answering. Nevertheless
concerning the first, we hope the sentence of the university of Paris, given
in our behalf will not admit it to be true, if so there were no other at all
that did participate in the opinion with us, as perhaps, if voices were cast,
there would be found as many for us as against us. And concerning the judgment
of Priests, who should best know what they did, we are right sure that we have
6. for one, if not ten, or rather sixteen that conspire in opinion with us for
one that dissenteth. And as for the two latter and such like, we utterly
disclaim the patronage, standing more assured of the strength and justness of
our cause, then to fly to such pretexts for succor.

And here to conclude our third Reason, we comfort our selves in the grounds
precedent, that howsoever the large potencie and aliance of our adversaries may
happen to ouersway, yet that the day of judgment, if not the seat Apostolic
before, will declare us guiltless of the crimes objected, and that the measure
which has been met unto us, was and is most oppressing, injurious, violent,
and spiritually hurtful to many.

The fourth Reason.
THE fourth Reason of our standing off, was, that admitting there had no
surreption appeared in the Constiutiue Letter, nor obreption, but that all
things had passed by true and full information, and with perfect knowledge of
his Holiness (as the day of judgment will declare for us, that at the time of
our delay, we did morally assure our selves in both, to the contrary) and that
not only his Holiness commanded the institution of the Archpresbytership with
the faculties and instructions annexed, but that he himself was indeed the
immediate and sole institutor thereof, and that also the Cardinal had
certified this much unto us in plain terms, and that finally the preiudices
which accompany the authority, did neither license us to suspend our belief,
nor could any way hold us excused for not believing his Grace on his word, (as
how little true all these things were, the reasons aforegoing have, we trust,
sufficiently showed:) yet we thought our selves secure in conscience, and free
from touch of the least disobedience, if his Holiness promoting M. Blackwel to
so large, and much more in some respects, then episcopal authority, we
refused to receive him to the dignity and ministration of the office, before
such time as he did show us the Popes letters for testimony of his promotion.
This we took to be lawful, and the reason why we took it to be so, was the
De electione ca. 1.
extrauagant, Iniunctae of Pope Bonifacius the 8. where these words are read:
Praesenti itaque perpetuo valitura constitutione sancimus, vt Episcopi and alij
Praelati superiores quocunque nomine censeantur, qui apud sede^ Apostolica^
promouentur, aut confirmationis munus recipient ad commissas eis Ecclesias
absque dictae sedis literis huiusmodi eorum promotionem seu confirmationem
continentibus accedere non praesumant: nullique eos absque dictarum literarum
ostensione recipiant aut eis pariant vel inte^dant. Quicunque vero ipsos absque
huiusmodi dictae sedis literis recipientes vel obedientes eisdem, tam diu sint
a beneficiorum suoru^ perceptione suspensi, donec super hoc eiusdem sedis
gratiam meruerint meruerint obtinere. We by this present constitution (says
Pope Boniface) continuing for ever, do decree, that Bishops and other superior
Prelates, by what name soever they are entitled, who are promoted by the Sea
Apostolic, or receive the benefit of confirmation, do not presume to take the
charge of those churches committed unto them, without the letters of the same
Sea, containing such their promotion or confirmation: and that none without
showing the foresaid letters, receive, obey, or reverence them for such. And
whosoever shall receive or obey them without the testimony of such letters from
the said Sea, remain so long suspended from receiving the fruits of their
benefices, until they shall deserve to obtain the relaxation of the said
censure from the Sea Apostolic.

That M. Blackwell was constituted a superior Prelate, and consequently in
this point, comprised under the words of the Extrauagant, it appeared in that
himself had no Ecclesiastical superior in the whole Realm, but was as
Metropolitan, and all the secular Priests of our nation residing in England or
Scotland appointed his subjects. A prelate of higher superiority in this kind
then ever England had, were Cardinal Wolsey the counter-partie of the
comparison. And that he was also contained under the other part of the
Extrauagant, to wit, the Church or Churches committed unto him, seemed most
plain, having our whole Catholic Church both the Secular Clergy, and
Laity, committed to his charge, as his Holiness two Breues do testify. To
One of the 6. of Apill 1599. the other of the 17. of August 1601.
avoid that is said, and exempt M. Blackwell from being comprehended under this
latter part of the Extrauagant, upon pretext that there are no Ecclesiastical
revenues (an evasion of his own) belonging to the Church or Catholic
multitude, whereof he is appointed Superior, is not only to make the good Pope
and prudent Governor of Gods Church to regard temporalities, more then he did
order and reformation in Gods house, but most oppositely to contradict the
Proeme of the same Extrauagant, where the holy Pope dilateth of the great
peril and spiritual prejudice which follows upon the admitting of Prelates
to the dignity and office they claim, and would assume to themselves before
they have made lawful proof of such their promotion, and orderly calling to
place of government. For removing of which inconvenience, the Pope ordained
that no Bishop or superior Prelate promoted by the Sea Apostolic, should
^auar in c. accep^^ de restitu. sp^li^t. of posit. 8. ^u. 39.
be received to the dignity and prelature bestowed upon him, before he show
the Letters of the same Sea, for testimony of such his Ecclesiastical
preferment.

Moreover, if our adversaries shall deny M. Blackwell to be any like superior
Prelate, as is understood in the Extrauagant: we answer, that granting it to be
true which they say, although for the Reasons aforegoing, the same may seem
somewhat in congruent: nevertheless other Popes who have sithence succeeded,
have in such cases extended the same prohibition and penalties to inferior
Prelates, as writes Par. 1. Instit. mor. li. 5 ca. 2. quaeritur. 5.
Adzore, and cites for instance the constitutions of Constitut. quae in^ipit,
Cu^ nobis.
Paulus tertius, and Constable. quae incipit, Sanctissimis.
Julius tertius. And certes, we are of opinion, that there is no man of
understanding, who shall consider the ample jurisdiction that our Archpriest
carries over the whole secular Clergy, but will easily think that he may
well be included under the name of a superior Prelate, specially if he reflect
upon the words immediately ensuing, Quo^unque nomine censeantur, by what title
or name soever the superior Prelate be called.

Beside, there are many branches of his authority which do either equal or
exceed the jurisdiction of a Bishop in the same points. For demonstration, S.
Thomas writes Quodlibet. 10. art. 10. ad 3. and Tol^t. de 7 pecc. mort. c. 21.
Ibidem.
that the secular clergy are not bound to obey their Bishops, but in matters
that belong to their Clergy state, and not in the general disposition and
course of their lives: this being, by the opinion of the same Saint and
greatest Clarke, that kind of obedience which the religious vow and ow to their
Prelate, and is an overplus to that which the Secular owe and are bound to
render to their Bishops. But the jurisdiction that the Constitutiue Letter
gives to our Archpriest over all the Seminary Priests of our nation,
residing in England or Scotland, is to direct, admonish, reprehend, and
chastise them whichout limitation in or for what: yea as him self affirmed to
me, at the first showing of the Constitutiue Letter, we were bound to obey him
in all things. So that in this point his jurisdiction cannot be less, and may
with facility be understood to be more then Episcopal over us.

Again, the form of the Constitutiue Letter imparteth jurisdiction to our
Archpriest to hear and determine our doubts and controversies, and may take
away our faculties if we impugn or disobey his resolution, or show our selves
unquiet in any thing he shall command. A sovereignty, which if it does not
surpass, yet certainly it is not inferior to the amplest authority in this
kind, that ever any Bishop or Archbishop had in our country: specially, if it
be considered, that the hearing and determining of our doubts and
controversies, are like to be and must be (the dangers of the time so
enforcing) demeaned without advocate, without pleading, without legal
process, without tribunal, or before any other Judge then the Archpriest
himself, who, as matters have hitherto happened, has been a chief party in
all the differences.

Further, the Constitutiue Letter communicates jurisdiction to our Archpriest,
to remove us from the places of our residences being in Lay men's houses, and
living upon their charities. And the ninth instruction gives him authority
over the Catholic Laity to remove the Priests they keep, and assign them
others in their room. The words of the said instruction are, Vtrique scili^et
Sacerdotes incolae seu parochi, and Domini laici apud quos viuunt, scire
debebunt in potestate vestra esse pro maiori Dei gloria, Sacerdotes ab vna domo
vel residentia in aliam mutare; neque agree quisquam id far debebit, aut
obluctari, sed Dei gloriae, A pretext soonest devised, and a ready mean to
help the Jesuits or their auowed friends to the best places, and to wreak
their displeasure upon who^soeuer Arg. D. Tho. 2. 2. q. 104. ar. 5. cor. Et

animarumque saluti suum gustum postponere. Both the Priests that are resident,
and the Lay persons with whom they reside, must know, that for the greater
glory of God, you have power and jurisdiction to change Priests from one
house or residence to another, and that neither of them ought to take it hardly
or strive against it, but to conquer and subordinate his or their liking to the
glory of God and health of souls. A faculty so little second to the
authority of the highest Archbishop in the world, that it may be a question,
or rather no question, whether, circumstances considered, it be not greater
then Papal, our own and our benefactors lives depending thereon. Our own
lives, for that, put from our acquainted harbor, many of us us do not know
where next to hide our heads: theirs, in regard that such remoues by
authority, can hardly, or not hardly be kept secret: and growing to be known,
our patrons that harbored us of charity, become discovered, and by every base
and hungry companion that shall get knowledge of the matter, may inform her
Majesty's Officers, and procure their houses to be searched, and their goods to
be seized on, their servants examined, their children rifled, their wives
thrown out of doors, their lands consiscated, themselves committed to prison,
arraigned, convicted, executed, and their family for ever after utterly ruined
and overthrown.

And here the opportunity of the place offers an occasion to speak a word or
two, in answer to that which father Parsons obiecteth and inculcateth in his
books and writings against us, to wit, that we should affirm that the Pope
could not lawfully appoint such a kind of subordination over us: and likewise
that his Holiness could not essigne us a Superior without our priuity and
consent. Assertions which hitherto I cannot find by the search I have made, in
any books of ours: nevertheless we do not deny touching the first, but that
some of us have said by way of reasoning, yet still with reservation of our
duty to the Sea Apostolic and his Holiness, that we did not conceive how
his Holiness could give authority to our Archriest to place and displace
Priests living of temporal alms in Catholic houses, since by the laws of our
Country, the entertainers must and do venture their lives and all that they are
worth in the action: and that the Priests also, who are so removed, cannot but
receive thereby some flaw or blemish in their credit, as being reputed unfit or
insufficient for the place they were removed from and consequently much hindered
for getting other places, and in the mean, not unlike to fall into the hands
of the enemy for want of convenient maintenance or harbor to shroude
themselves. And now if this doctrine seem unsound or absurd, or other then most
conscionable, we request father Parsons and father Garnet (whom we no whit
doubt to be the deuisers of the faculty, for that we cannot think that ever
such a rigor was of his Holiness setting down, or ever fully understood by
him with the truth of all circumstances) to instruct us in the difficulty, and
manifest the grounds of the contrary unto us, and we promise by Gods grace,
that their labor shall not be lost, but that they shall have us forthwith to
change our opinion, and to yield them thanks for the charity.

Concerning the other assertion, that we should say, His Holiness could not
assign us a Superior without our priuity and consent, we take it to be more
then all our adversaries can prove that we ever spoke. And as for the citing of
the Did. 61. ca. Nullus inuitis and did. 63. ca. si in plebibus and ca. 1. de
electione.
Canons that permit or authorize the Clergy to choose their Superior, they
were not cited by any of us to the end to prove that his Holiness could not
appoint us a Superior, without asking our voices, or acquainting us first with
the dessigne, but were only alleged, to show that it was a custom received in
holy Church, and not yet discontinued every where, that the Clergy should have
the choosing of their own Superior, and which being a favor allowed to many
by the Sea Apostolic, and by censure of common reason, a great furtherance to
peace and of electing the fittest person; we could not think if his Holiness
had been rightfully informed, but that his pastoral love and benignity would
have granted us (venturing our lives as we do for the primacy of his seat,
and oppressed with many sorts of afflictions) the choosing of our Superior, or
at least not to have given (as the Constitutiue Letter specifieth) the
perpetual election of him to the Cardinal Protector, a stranger unto us,
unacquainted with the difficulties of our country, and distant by more then a
thousand miles from us. To this end were the Canons alleged, as the
circumstances and drift of the places where they are alleged, do witness. And
therefore we cannot but fear a sinister intention in father Parsons, and in
our other adversaries, that thus add to and wrest our words to the sense and
purpose which themselves like best. But to return.

The Constitutiue Letter gives also authority to our Archpriest to take away
faculties granted by whom soever and he has de facto taken away such faculties
from some of us, as his Holiness himself immediately gave to the parties from
whom he took them. A larger jurisdiction then any Metropolitan, Patriarch or
legate Cardinal in the world has, as we think, adjoined to his person or
office. Which supereminencie, together with the reasons aforegoing, seems
most apparently to enforce, that M. Blackwe^^ cannot be but reputed such a
superior Prelate as is intended by the words of the Extrauagant. Episcopi and
alij Prelati superiores quocunque nomine conseantur: Bishops and other
superior Prelates by what name soever they are called. Or if we should
denominate the authority according as it is practiced, we must needs call it a
high prelacy, because it either dispenses with the law of God, nature, and
man, or violateth the same.

IT either dispenses with the law of God or violateth the same, because what
God commands our Archpriest forbids: for example, God commands, Libera
eum qui iniuriam patitur, deliver him Eccl. 4.
who suffers injury. Again, Liberate vi oppressum de ^nanu calumniatoris.
Ier. 22.
Deliver ye the violently oppressed from the hand of the calumniator. Prou. 24.
And in another place, Erue illos qui ducuntur ad mortem. Rescue them who are
(unjustly) lead to death. But now our Archpriest prohibiteth under heavy
penalties, even when our good names were rather in the act of dying, then in
leading to death, and after the University of Paris had given sentence for us;
not only our lay friends, or our fellow Priests, but also our ghostly fathers
(who by privilege of that office, knew, saw, and were feelingly sure of the
wrong and calumniation objected) to defend us by word or writing directly or
indirectly, although they were bound by the foresaid law of God, and by the
right of truth, charity and Nau. in Manu. ca. 24. nu. 17. 18 and 22 and ca.
14. n. 10. Decretum 18. October. 1600.. 4.
justice, to speak in our purgation. The words of our Archpriests decree and
prohibition were these: Prohibemus in virtute sanctae obedientiae omnibus
praesbyteris, etiam sub p^na suspensionis atque interdicti, (quort^m
absolutionem n^bisipsis reseruamus) addo ettam amissionis omnium facultatum
ipso facto incurrendarum: Laicis vero sub poena interdicti ipso quoque facto
incurrendi, ne quisquam illam praeteritam inobedientiam (vnde tanta inter nos
extiti: pacis perturbatio) quouis modo, verbo vel scripto direct vel indirecte
defend^re praesumat. We prohibit all Priests in virtue of holy obedience, and
under pain of suspension and interdict, (the absolution of which we retain to
our selves) I add also under pain of leesing all faculties, to be incurred in
the deed it self: and the laity under pain of interdict to be likewise
presently incurred, that no one, any manner of way, in word or in writing,
directly or indirectly, presume to defend the foresaid disobedience past, which
bred so great contention among us.

Which part of our Archpriests decree, may seem the more severe,. 3.
in that he himself in the paragraph next before (having sentenced and
denounced to the whole Realm, that we were truly and really disobedient to the
Sea Apostolic, and rebellious against his office instituted by the same Sea:
would immediately after (the condemnation bearing no more truth then the
foregoings have showed) forbid us and all others, in the manner as is set
down, not to defend that disodience by name, Which ^red so great contention
among us, which as the whole world knows, was for that we would not yield our
selves guilty of the crimes, and most grievous abominations that were
objected and maintained by the Society and their adherents against us. And
indeed had not father Lyster, father Garnet, and father Jones, with some
other, most dispiteously, and alike unjustly massacred our good names, or our
Archpiest not approved and patronized their infinite wrongs done against us,
undoubtedly all had been at quiet long since, and never grown to the thousand
part of that most rufull excess, to which the violent prosecution of their
wrongs, and the unconscionable seeking to oppress us by strong hand, have
carried the contention, and do still alas increase and nourish the flame.

ANno Domini millesimo sexcentessimo, die tertio Maij, propositum f^it
facultati theologiae Parisiensi, quod literis cuiusdam Illmi Cardinalis, quidam
Superior Ecclesiasticus in regno quodam censtitutus est, cum titulo and

omnes alios presbyteros in eadem regno commorantes. Cardnalis autem in illis
suis literis declarauit, se id fecisse iuxta voluntatem and beneplacitum summi
Pontificis.

Multi autem ex illis Presbyteris recusarunt subsignare authoritati eiusdem
Archipresbyteri, priusquam ipse obtinuisset literas Apostolicas confirmationis
suae tenorem continentes, tum quia no^um omnino erat and in ecclesi^ Catholica
hactenus inauditum, illud genus regiminis, vt Archipresbyter vniuerso regno
preesset, and talem iurisdictionem haberet in singulos eius regni Sacerdotes:
tum etiam, quia ex quibusdam verbis illarum literarum Illmi Cardinalis visi
sunt sibi videre, talem Archipresbyterum and authoritatem eius ex falsa
informatione a summo Pontifice fuisse concessam: tum denique, quia in electione

The English.
IN the year of our Lord 1600. upon the third day of May, it was proposed to
the faculty of Divines of the University of Paris, that by the letters of a
most illustrious Cardinal, an ecclesiastical Superior was constituted in a
certain kingdom, with the title and dignity of an Archpriest, to have
authority and jurisdiction over all other priests residing in that kingdom.
This Cardinal did also declare in those his letters, that he did it according
to the will and good liking of the Pope.

Notwithstanding many of these Priests refused to subscribe to the authority
of the said Archpriest, before he had obtained letters from the Sea
Apostolic, containing the tenor of his confirmation, as well because that
kind of government was altogether new in Gods Church, and hitherto never heard
of, that an Archpriest should have charge over a whole kingdom, and such
jurisdiction over every Priest in that Realm: then also for that it seemed to
them by certain words of the Cardinals letters, that the Archpriest and his
authority was granted by false information: then lastly, because they noted
great partiality in the choice of the Archpriest and of his Counselors. Upon
which, and some other reasons, these Priests sent messengers to the Pope, for
laying open unto him these their difficulties, and therewithal to signify
their greatest readiness, as in this matter, so evermore in all other to obey
his Holiness.

The Archpriest and those who are of his side, accuse the other Priests of
schism, in that they deferred to obey the Cardinals letters, which moreover he
said were written according to his Holiness mind and pleasure.

The question then is, whether these Priests be schismatickes, and if not,
whether they did commit at the least some grievous sin?

The head and chief men of the faculty of divinity in Paris, chosen out of
the whole company, assembled together in the house of their seniour Beedle, in
the year and day above written, after full and maturest consideration had of
the matter, gave this censure.

First, that those Priests who upon the above named causes deferred to obey,
were no schismatickes.

Secondly, that they committed no sin at all in that fact, in it self
considered.

By commandment of our Deane and Masters deputed and selected by the whole
faculty of divinity in Paris. Delacourt.

The Decree of our Archpriest in prohibition of the foresaid Censure.
IN Dei nomine amen: In the name of God Amen. We George 29. Maij. 1600
Blackwell Archpriest of England, and Protonotarie Apostolical, by the
authority sufficiently and lawfully committed unto us, do strictly command in
virtue of obedience, and under pain of suspension from divine offices, and
loss of all faculties in the fact it self to be incurred, all ecclesiastical
persons, and also all lay Catholics under pain of being interdicted
semblably in the fact it self to be incurred, that neither directly nor
indirectly, they maintain or defend in word or in writing, the censure of the
University of Paris, whether it be truly given or forged, whether upon true
information or otherwise, as being prejudicial to the dignity of the Sea
Apostolic, and expressly contrary to his Holiness Breue, and to the sentence
iudicially given by the two Cardinals appointed judges in our cause, and to our
common peace so much wished for by his Holiness. And this we inuiolably command
to be observed under the pains before specified, and greater also according to
his Holiness pleasure.

In this Decree, there occur many things that seem very strange: namely,
that the sentence of the University is prejudicial to the dignity of the Sea
Apostolic, and expressly contrary to his Holiness Breue. O Lord Christ! O
Sir, our Superior! who are we, or what may our cause be, that not to be
adjudged renegates from the Sea Apostolic, or traitors to God by sin, must
be accounted a prejudice to the dignity of the sea Apostolic? strange, and
so strange as it astonieth. You say, that the sentence clearing us of schism
and sin, is expressly contrary to his Holiness Breue. We beseech you to
quote the words, to show the place: for if it be expressly contrary, as you
say, then the contrariety must needs consist in plain terms, not in
deductions or inferences upon the tenor or purport of the Breue. Or if this
much be not to be showed (as all the labor under heaven can never show it,
because neither of the two words [schisme, or sinne] is used in the Breue, nor
we that prolonged the yielding of our obedience, any where specified in the
same:) we then pray you to frame the arguments which conclude and infer so
much. For verily, we for our parts, do not see (as is said before Page 109. 110
and 111.
in the place where we have discoursed of this very point) how any such
infere^ce ca^ with understanding be made. Or if understanding be misled to
make such an inference: yet we protest that we cannot co^nceiue how the
authorities that contradict the verity of such an inference, and which we have
alleged Page 58. and sequentibus.
before, ca^ possibly be answered or colourably shifted off. Or were all the
Canonists deceived, and their authorities worth nothing, yet if M. Blackwell be
such a superior Prelate, as is contained under the words of the former
Extrauagant, and as his former faculties and largest jurisdiction must in all
reason make him: then is it dead sure, that no such inference can be made,
because that cannot be schism or sin, which the Extrauagant decrees, and
commands to be observed, under the pain of leesing the fruits of their
ecclesiastical livings, that shall presume to transgress the precept.

And as we cannot conceive how the censure of the University could be
prejudicial to the dignity of the Sea Apostololicke, or expressly contrary to
his Holiness Breue: so can we less imagine, how the same censure can be
reckened prejudicial to our common peace, so much wished for by his Holiness,
unless our purgation of schism and sin, be such a bar or adverse
hinderance of peace, as the one cannot stand or be effected except the other be
repealed. Which lack of charity, howsoever it may sort with the kind of
peace, that perhaps some of our adversaries affect, whose passion of
ouerweening of themselves, is so puissant, as they can hardly, if at all, count
that peace for peace, wherein our discredit is not proclaimed: yet we are sure
that the stiff seeking of our dishonor cannot sort with that peace which his
Holiness wishes to be among us. For this being a charitable peace, and
charity not rejoicing 1. Cor. 13.
upon iniquity, but rejoicing with truth, the fathers of the Society,
especially our Superior, should rather congratulate that we were acquitted by
public sentence of a famous university, in the crimes objected upon error,
then by opinionatiue defending their rash and temerarious judgment, make
nouissima peiora prioribus, their last actions worse Math. 12.
then their first against us.

Concerning the other reason which our Archpriest alleges also, as part of
the cause why he did so severely prohibit the defending of the censure of
Paris, viz. for that the same was prejudicial to the sentence iudicially given
by the two Cardinals appointed judges in our cause: we know not where to take
the first exception, the whole and every word thereof lies so loose and open.
Father Parsons in the Apology, will Fol. 133.
not have the said sentence given so much by way of a judicial sentence, as by
way of a letter, under the two Cardinals their hands and seals. So that if we
may believe father Parsons, the sentence was not iudicially given. Neither were
the two Cardinals appointed judges to decide whether our deferring (for the
causes rehearsed in the question) to receive M. Blackwell our Superior upon
view of the Cardinals Letter, were schism or sin, the matter merely
considered in it self, abstracted from all circumstances: nor yet were their
Graces appointed judges in the cause of any one of our whole company, save
only in the cause of M. Bishop and M. Charnocke, as the title of the decree,
and the decree it self does witness. Again, their Graces sentence does not
signify, that they inflicted the punishment upon our said two brethren, for
refusing to subscribe to the new authority, or for coming to Rome; because
there is no such thing set down: nay the contrary is expressed, in that the
causes for which they were restrained from coming into England, or for going
into the kingdoms of Scotland and Ireland, were only (as the words of the
decree do testify) for maintaining controversies with other men of their own
order, and for that it appeared in no case expedient for the English cause that
they should return into England. Now to mainetaine controversies with other
men of their own order, and to appear not to be expedient that they should
forthwith return into England, are things different from deferring their
obedience to the Archpriest, and from sending or going to Rome, for fuller
knowledge of his Holiness pleasure, and to lay open our difficulties unto him.
Besides, if the cause, in which the two Cardinals were appointed Judges, See
more of this point page 101. and sequentibus.
was the refusal to subscribe to the authority of the Archpriest instituted
by the Letters of Cardinal Caietane, and for sending to Rome: then was
Cardinal Caietane appointed judge in the cause that most nearely concerned
himself, a thing against law, and so intolerable in the ministering of
justice, as his Holiness would never have assigned him judge therein, nor the
Cardinal for edification sake, have used the office, especially in designing
the punishment. Or to grant (which is no more so, then a fox is a fearnebush)
that the two Cardinals had given sentence in the same cause before, and
otherwise, then did the university. What then? must the censure of a renowned
university, one of the most famous in Christendom, be so lightly set by,
abandoned, detested, and that in a matter of fact, as whosoever shall either
defend or maintain it directly or indirectly, in word or writing, must, if he
be a priest, be presently in the fact it self suspended from divine offices,
and leese his faculties? or if such a delinquent be a lay Catholic, he must in
like manner be interdicted ipso facto? A rigor, as the like whereof all the
Annals and records of all the Prelates actions since Christ's time hitherto,
cannot, as we assure our selves, yield one instance or near example.

But that, which of all other points in the decree seems to be most out of
rule, is the imposing of so heavy penalties for the direct or indirect
maintenance of the censure. Whether the university gave the same upon true
information or otherwise. This, this appeared so strange, as we hardly durst
believe our own eyes, before we read the words over and over gain: nor
should we so have believed the same, had the decree not come forth in the hand
writing of our Superior, and under his seal. For, was it ever heard, that one
Prelate, and of no higher calling the^ an Archpriest and Protonotary
Apostolical, being also but a Bachelor of Divinity, and never reader in the
faculty, would not only, so ouerrule the ce^sure of a whole university, but
so farfoorth to reject it, as to bereave Priests of their faculties, to suspend
them from the altar, to interdict the Laity, man and woman, young and old,
vulgar and noble, whosoever shall maintain the same so much as indirectly, and
this, Whether the information given to the university were true or false. Was
it ever heard, that Priests, having no other means to maintain themselves by,
then by use of their faculties, and living every hour in danger of death for
profession of their faith, should be spoiled of their faculties, disabled to do
good to others, put from the altar, robbed of their maintenance, debarred from
Sacraments, and incur all these spiritual punishments, for defending the
censure of a most learned, famous, and Catholic university, in a matter
neither decided by any decree of holy Church, nor contrary to any express
authority of holy Scripture? Was it ever heard, that men and women, leesing
all their goods, and two third parts of their lands, only because they will
not go to a contrary Church, and daily hazarding their lives and the utter
ruin of their whole posterity, for profession of the Roman faith, for
receiving Priests, for releeuing their necessities, for the glory of Gods
Church, for preservation of Religion, for good example to their The penalties
following the censure of interdiction.
even christen, should be exiled from use of all sacraments, put from being
present at divine Service, and dying not to be interred in Christian manner,
and to be thus disgraced, maligned, defamed and spiritually afflicted for
adhering to their friends, approved to be honest by long trial, for taking
part with their ghostly fathers in a matter of fact, discussed and determined
to be lawful by public censure of a renowned university? Was it ever heard,
that the like measure has been met by an Archpriest to Priests, by a Superior
to his subjects, by a father to his children, by a labourer to his brethen
coadiutors, by one living in persecution, against his fellows in the same
persecution, and this by the counsel and direction of religious persons, who
must not be counted sicut caeteri homines, as the rest of workmen in the same
vineyard? O heaven! O earth! are ye not astonished, or do ye not close your eyes,
from beholding the injustice, the inhumanitie, the unnaturalness, the
oppression, the affliction unspeakable, enough to stumble any that are not
well stayed by grace?

But besides these exceptions of our Archpriest against the censure, father
Parsons as one being inured with the trade of devising shifts, descends in
the Apology to other particulars, and tells us that the said definition of
Paris in very deed very little releeueth our case, and Fol. 115. and sequentib.
that we might well have spared to print it. but for making a vain flourish
with ostentation of an Academicall sentence. And why so? Marie because the
information that was given to the Doctors, was wrong and defectuous, and that
there was no man of the Archpriestes side to reply or tell the tale as it ought
to be, and tell them how false the information was. Is all this true? then we
pray tell us what man was at Rome, when you labored and informed the Cardinal
and his Holiness about instituting the subordination, to reply or tell them
how false the information was? Had not you father Parsons, the drawing of the
Constitutiue Letter, the setting down of the instructions and additions? The
day of judgment will declare you had, howsoever you cloud matters now from
the sight of those that will not see light when the Sun shines. Were there
any Priests in England which were to live under the subordination that had a
part, a voice, or were made privy to the design, save happily some two or
three, of whom father Garnet your inciter and aduertiser stood wholly
possessed, and had the commanding of their pens, tongues and travels?

You write in several places of the Apology, that both the Laity Fol. 98.
99. and 117. and alibi.
and Priests desired by their letters, and expressly demanded of his Holiness
a subordination among Priests. Show their letters, or give us some secret
notice of their names, that the truth may be known, or we shall not believe
you, but take thi^, as we must do innumerable other, for escapes of your pen
and memory. You write likewise, that if those reverend learned men had been
indifferently instructed in the case how it passed, they would have been of a
far other mind and judgment then to clear such a fact. And we do as verily
believe, that if his Holiness had been indifferently informed how matters
pass in England between the secular Priests and the fathers of the Society,
he would have appointed a far other form of Subordination, then such as
inlisteth but one side of the contenders, and makes those that were their
oppressors before, more potent to exercise their spleen, and exempteth them
from out the compass of the jurisdiction appointed over the other. Rome,
father Parsons, cannot persuade us, that ever his Holiness pious and tender
conscience would suffer you to sit as you do, at stern, making laws for us,
choosing our Superior, directing* governing and reigning as a Vice-pope over
us, had he been indifferently given to understand of our Princes hateful
auersion from you, and that not for your good deeds, or leaving the world, and
the general auersion likewise, that most of our Priests conceive of your
insinceritie in many matters, and truthlesse dealing. Finally you add that
they would not have cleared such a fact as has caused so many sinful
scandals. Here we must entreat you to name what kind of cause our action of
delay was, of the sinful scandals that have followed. You must needs range it
(as we think) under that kind of cause, which is called causa sine qua non,
the cause without which the ensuing fact had not been committed, which as you
know, the Philosophers term, stolidam causam, a foolish cause. And sure, if
our bearing off, and sending to Rome was lawful in it self, as beside the
decision of Paris, the authorities before going do prove inuincibly: your
reason, for that such our fact has caused so many sinful scandals, is weak
and childish. For has not the institution of your own order, approved by the
Sea Apostolic, to be good and holy, been the cause sine qua non, of many
sinful scandals? the world will witness, yea, in that many, some by their
pens, some by their tongues* some after another manner, have spoken and done
that, which was very sinful, and which they would not have done, had your
order never b^ne founded. You know what the Prophet and the Apostle writes,
and of whom: Ecce pono in Sion lapidem offensionis and Esa. 8. Romans 9.
petram scandali. Behold I put in Syon a stone of stumbling and a rock of
scandal. And yet we are more then sure, that you will not infer any of our
Saviors actions to be unlawful, albeit they caused many most sinful scandals
in the kind of cause above mentioned.

But now, let us see how you show the information given to the Sorbon Doctors
to be wrong, defectuous* false and sinistrous. For every of these is your own
Epitheton. You make 6. exceptions to this purpose. The first is, that we in
proposing the question, said only, that an ecclesiastical Superior was
co^stituted by the Letters of a most illustrious Cardinal, not telling the
Doctors that he was Protector of the nation, which does much increase (as you
say) his credit for matters touching the country under his protection. The
inualidity of this exception is refuted before: and the Cardinal not
instituting Page 66. and 67.
the subordinatio^ by any virtue of his Protectorship, but only by commission
from his Holiness, what did the adding, or not adding that the Cardinal, who
was his Holiness delegate in the action, was also Protector of the nation,
import? since the institution of the subordination did not belong to his office
of Protectorship, and consequently we not bound to obey his letter until he
had proved the commission, because Literis cuiusdam credendum est, de his quae
facere De probati.. 3 nu. 15.
potest vel debet ratione officij sui. Belief and obedience says Speculator,
is a tribute due to be given to the letters of those that command the things,
which appertain to their office. So that, the ordaining of the subordination
being a thing not belonging to the office of his Protectorship, we held it
superfluous to set down in the state of the question, that the Cardinal who
by his Letters instituted the subordination, was also the Protector of our
nation. And whereas you say, that the adding of being Protector of the nation
does much increase his credit for matters touching the Country under his
protection: we say the same, if either you mean [by matters] such as belong to
the office of Protectorship, or do mean that the title of being Protector does
much increase his credit, though not so much as we were bound to believe and
take his Graces word for warrantize of his Holiness commission unto him. But if
you mean another, or greater increase of his credit then either of these, then
we descent from you in opinion, and assure our selves, that ye can never make
good by reason or authority that which you say herein.

Your second exception. That we putting down the question, did but only
signify that the Cardinal did it according to the will and good liking of the
Pope, but did not tell them that it was, expresso mandato, by his Holiness
express commandment, which the Cardinal sets down clearly in his Letters.
Father, your little sincerity, or rather boldest audacitie amateth. For, where
does the Cardinal clearly set down in his Letters, that he received an
express commandment to erect a subordination? Certes, either your ignorance
appears gross and very faulty, that would not ouerview the letter before
you affirmed out of it a matter of such weight: or your audacitie in the
affirmance: there being no such commandment. We grant that the Cardinal in
the beginning of his Letter makes mention of an express commandment
received from his Holiness to make peace in our country, to the example of
the peace in the English College, but what is this to an express commandment
of erecting a subordination, especially so afflictiue and burdenous in our
whole church? How little these two do follow one another, and how the express
commandment of doing the one, is not nor cannot be the express or tacitiue
commandment of doing the other, the three first Propositions with sundry other
places in our Page 23 and ^4.
second Reason, do manifest and confirm abundantly. When the Cardinal came
in his Letter to appoint the Subordination, he made this entrance: For so much
as some men think it would not a little avail to the making of peace, if a
subordination were constituted among the English Priests, and the reasons
yielded by the Priests themselves (which was but M. Standish only, so far as
yet we know) for the same, were approved by our holy Father: we following the
most godly and most prudent will of his Holiness, have decreed to ordain a
subordination. Where is the express commandment you talk of, and which, as
you say, the Cardinal sets down clearly in his Letter, we mean, an
express commandment of instituting a subordination? Verily we must answer you
with a Non est inuentus, except you can lend us a spirit to find that which is
not. We propounded the question in as full or more large terms then the
Cardinal used: for his Grace wrote sequentes voluntatem, we following the most
godly and prudent will of his Holiness, have decreed to ordain a
subordination. And we, in the state of our question wrote, that the Cardinal
did also declare in his letters unto us, that he decreed the subordinatio^
iuxta voluntatem and beneplacitum, according to the will and good liking of his
Holiness. So that where the Cardinal said, he did institute the subordination
following the will of his Holiness, we added that not only he did it,
following his will, but that also he did it according to his Holiness good
will and pleasure, which is somewhat more ample, or of greater emphasis.

Your third exception. We concealed another thing uttered also in the Cardinals
Letters, to wit, that a subordination was demanded by Priests letters to his
Holiness. What? did you dream when you wrote this? for where, we pray, is it
uttered in the Cardinals letters, that Priests in their Letters to his
Holiness did demand a Subordination? Fie, what failings are these? must we
think the cause you plead, no better, but that it requires to be vpholden
with such apparent falsities? The Prophet says, in detestation of idols,
Lingua ipsorum polita a fabro, ipsa etiam Baruc. 6.
inaurata and inargentata, falsa sunt, and non possunt loqui. Their tongue is
polished by the Carpenter, and themselves being gilded and siluered over, are
(notwithstanding) counterfeit and cannot speak. We know not what Art has
polished your pen, but certain we are, that howsoever, the counterfeits she
draws, show fair to the outward view, yet looked into and examined, they are
false, and, as idols, speak little truth. Again, how shall we know, that his
Holiness allowed of the reasons? You set it so down indeed, in the Cardinals
Letter, and we believe it so far, as it is meant by the reasons touched in M.
Standish his oration to his Holiness, a bird (as all men think) of your own
hatching: but if you understand by the words, the reasons that the Priests
yielded in their Letters to his Holiness, when they demanded a subordination
of him, as the words themselves must needs infer: then we do not believe it,
because we cannot think, that any of our fellow Priests did ever write such
letters to his Holiness. But let it be true, that his Holiness allowed of the
reasons which the Priests made in their Letters unto him for a subordination:
yet we know, and not only by his Holiness words to some of our brethren, but
even by the record of your own reports, that his Holiness yielding to grant
a subordination, would not assign the particular subordination till he had
received signification from the priests in England, what kind of subordination
An holy prudence, that those who were to obey and bore the heat and burden of
the day should make choice of the subordination and superior.
we liked, and best agreed with the state of our country. And thus having his
Holiness word for warrant, related also by your self to some of our company:
had we not good reason (we ask the indifferent and all of judgment) to think
(we not aduertising his Holiness of the kind of government we thought
fittest) that surreption was used in the information, and consequently to delay
as all laws permit, the submission of our obedience, until the truth and
state of matters were better known? Undoubtedly these, howsoever they appear
to other, convinced our understanding, and bid us not to fear sin, neither
to doubt but that his Holiness would take in good part, if not thankefully,
our sending unto him about the premises.

Your fourth exception: We said (in putting down the state of the question
unto the University) that many of us refused to subscribe to the authority as
though we had been a great multitude, or the mayor part. Good sir where do you
read that this word [ multi many] must be taken for a great multitude or for
the mayor part of that company whereof it was spoken? The Canon has 4 q. 3.
si testes.
Pluralis locutio duorum numero contenta est: the speaking in the plural
number, is verified in the number of two. And Panormitane writes, that In ca.
ad nostram de reb. ec. alienat. nu. 5.
Duo dicuntur multi, two are called many. And although the words [ many and
few] do take Gloss. in ca. Latores de Cler. exco^. vel depos. verb.
Multitudinem.
their most proper and relative denomination of the number whereof they are
auerred to be many or few: yet no doubt, fewer after this account would bear
the name of many, then so great a multitude or mayor part as you require, and
seem to infer that the Doctors understood by our words in the proposing of
the question, and that they made it one of the causes why they cleared us from
all sin in the nature of our fact.

Undoubtedly sir, to make that this your fourth exception should carry any
weight* it is of necessity that you first prove (and yet it is a thing which
you can never prove) the small or great number of the refusers to subscribe, to
be of that intrinsecal aliance or essence with our fact, as it made the same in
his own nature sin or no sin. For if the nature of our fact in delaying
our obedience, and sending to Rome, were not changed by the small or great
number of us, who in such sort prolonged to receive the authority: what
skilleth it, or what difference can it put, the fact considered in it self,
(for with that limitation the university delivered their censure) whether the
doers were many or few, one or a thousand, this being but an accident and a
circumstance, and of no such omnipotency, as could possibly change the nature
of the fact in it self considered? Further, if notwithstanding that which we
have said, the exception must still appear of force (as all that are of
judgment do well see, it cannot) yet the same is doubly satisfied in our Page
92.
answer to the fourth objection of our adversaries, to which place for
avoiding of unnecessary repetition we refer the Reader.

Now that which you add for explication or better proof of the exception,
bewraieth a worse conscience. Your words be these: That not being the twentieth
part at the beginning of those that admitted the government, if we have
increased our number since, it has been by as false information as this was to
the Doctors of Paris, and by persuading them to the participation of our
liberty and freedom from all government, which is a sore bait for young men,
as all the world knows. Is this your charitable judgment father, that
neither we, nor our brethren had better ends in our actions then you specify,
and which you reckon by verdite of the whole world, a sore bait for young men?
But let us see, now you have passed your censure over us, how true the same is.
The censure consists of these three points: first, that we seduced our
brethren by false information: then, that we persuaded them to the
participation of our liberty: thirdly, that this liberty and freedom from
all government, was a sore bait for young men, as all the world knows. So
that you make the means, by which we drue our brethren to our side, to be
sleights and leasings: and our end, why we drew them, no other then to have
them our fellows in liberty, and in such a liberty as all the world knows,
to be a sore temptation to young men.

Touching the first, what false information could this be in particular by
which you say we beguiled our brethen? were not all our brethren who have since
turned for us, or manifested themselves to be of our mind, both eye and ear
witnesses of all matters as well as our selves? were they not evermore lookers
on, and priuier to our adversaries proceedings, then any of us, from whom they
were more auerted? Surely if you know what the particular information was, by
which we won the^ to our part, you may do well to set the same down: or if in
case you do not know the information in particular, then we ask you with what
conscience do you so confidently auerre it to be false? not knowing it what it
was? When you shall open this much, we doubt not, but that we shall be also
able to give you and the world satisfaction to the contrary. In the mean, we
deny your speeches to be true. But what say we? do we deny them to be true,
since you affirm no more, but that we increased our number by as false
information, as was the information which we gave to the university, and which
being true, as we maintain, and the other information to our brethren, by your
own words, but as false, we are content if this much do please, to allow the
comparison? Nevertheless the truth is, that the information and motives which
invited some of our brethren to manifest themselves, and drew others to amend
their former hasty error in receiving so fruitless an authority, upon the
sole warrantize of the Cardinals Letter, was times deciphering The true causes
of the increase of our numbers.
of matters, the love of truth, the direction of their own consciences, the
inward working of their compassion, the sorrow and grief their hearts felt, by
seeing how unjustly we their brethren were slandered, and how violently beyond
all measure, extremities were carried and prosecuted against us: and this upon
no color or inducement more then because we were few. So that compassion of
our miseries, and love of lessening the burden by dividing it among more, were
the means and information that increased our number, and not the participation
of our liberty, and the sore bait thereof. Neither is there scarce any one
Catholic or Protestant in our country, that marks how matters pass, but
can tell, that we only, and none but our party are punished by the
Archpriest. Which thing whether it be true or no, or not more then our words
import, let the taking away of faculties from several of the Appellants since
the making of the appeal: let the suspending and interdicting of us: let the
solemn declaration which he made by his letters addressed to that end,
Vniuerso clero Anglicano, caeterisque In his letter of the 21. of February,
1601.
Christi sidelibus in Angliae regno commorantibus: to the universal English
Clergy, and other faithful people of Christ, abiding in the kingdom of
England: let his refusing of our appeal, In the same Letter. In his letter of
the 16. of May 1601. D. Bagshaw. In his Letter the 18 of March 1601. M.
Colleton.
let his strange inuerting of our words: let the contumelies in calling one of
us, Erraticus and per saltu^ ascendens Doctor, a wandering Doctor and ascending
by iumpes: and another, the son of Belial: let the exempting of us from
having part of the common diuidents, if we be prisoners, or if we be at
liberty: let their excluding of us from all places and favors where the
adverse part can prevail: let the disgraces, the obloquies, the slanders that
are every where in city and country spread, tennised and maintained against
us, and the freedom, and rich friendship which our brethren of the other side
find, bear witness and decide, whether the participation of our liberty, and
the freedom we enjoy, above our fellows of the other party, be a sore bait
for young men: or not rather most potent means to deter both young and old
from taking part with us.

Moreover there be some Priests in our country, who for that they The rigor of
the government.
be destitute of friends, and know not how possibly to live, if they should
openly appeal, or otherwise manifest their conscience in matters, have written
and protested to his Holiness that they dare not appeal, by reason of the
foresaid extremities. Again, our Archpriest In his Letter of the 21. of Febr.
1601. Stilo Romano.
warns and exhorts in our Lord all Catholics, Vt omnibus modis quibus
possunt, nos vitent: that by all means possible they should shun our
company: and taking us to be breakers of peace, he wishes them as they do
show themselves patrons and foster-fathers of the Church of Christ, Omni open
atque opera iuxta Apostoli praeceptu^ etiam confundere nita^tur: that they
would labor by all helps and furtherances to confound us according to the
precept of the Apostle. Likewise one of the Assistants M. Standish words to M.
Dr^w^e.
said, that he would no more from henceforth account the Appella^ts his
brethren, nor otherwise esteem of the^, the^ of B^l and Top^lif. Also another
Priest of like forwardnes advises that our company should be shu^ned M. G.
as his, who has a plague sore running upon him. And some Priests that are not
known to adhere unto us, have told us, that if their benefactors did know they
were in our company, they would discontinue their charities, and withdraw their
good affection from them. All which, to our seeming do convince, that the
benefit and liberty we enjoy, by appealing is not so sweet a bait for
misleading young men, as the matter is made, but rather, most sower auersions,
and such as he that is a young man, and not a senior in virtue and in contempt
of worldly favors, will beware as of his undoing, how he appeals, or have
commerce with us in the cause.

And albeit we have staid long about the confutation of this reason, yet here
we cannot omit to note one thing more, viz. that you having otherwhere affirmed
that we were not above ten, or not so many, and In the libell the 10. of
January 1599. In your letter to M. Bishop the 9. of October 1599.
repeating also in this very place that we were not the twentieth part, at the
beginning, of those that admitted the government, would nevertheless after
the reading of our appeal, and seeing thirty of our names thereunto, make a
doubt by an if, whether we have increased our number since. Certes how slow of
belief soever you would make your self to appear in this point, yet our
Archpriest is not so incredulous: for he said not long since, by credible
relation, that the Laity had need to stick unto him, for the Priests were
fallen away. Neither do we doubt, if there were a commission granted to
examine every Priest on his oath how he likes the government, but that the
number of those which would depose for it, would be very small, and hardly
twenty besides the Assistants in all England, if all the Assistants should take
these oaths for the allowance thereof, as we doubt they will not.

Your fifth exception: that we pretended only to refuse to subscribe to the
authority of the Archpriest before he had obtained letters from the Sea
Apostolic for confirmation, as who would say that this being done, we meant
to be quiet. Sir, how highly you esteem of your own credit, yet deeds being
ever of more power to persuade then words, we hope, especially having
thousands of witnesses on our side, that our deeds will be credited before
your words. Did we not all presently upon the arrival of his Holiness Breue,
receive the authority, and subject our obedience to M. Blackwell? the matter
is plainer then can be denied, and it is acknowledged by our Archpriest, and
fuller by father Garnet in their letters which are set down in the tenth
Chapter of the Apology, yea your self intitleth that Chapter in this manner:
of the Fol. 146. and 147. Fol. 148.
ending of all controversies upon the publication of his Holiness Breue. But
you call in doubt whether the peace that was made, and our accepting of the
authority were inwardly and sincere, or outwardly only for a show to satisfy
the world for a time. What shall we answer? you know those words of Solomon:
Multos supplantauit suspitio illorum, and in vanitate detinuit Eccle. 3
sensus illorum. Suspicion has deceived many, and detained their judgment in
vanity of error. And you know also, from what bad roots S. Thomas teaches
the sin of suspicion to grow, and chiefly 2. 2. q. 60. art. 3. c.
from this, that being culpable our selves, we become easily inclined thereby to
deem others guilty of the same faults, according to that saying of Scripture
cited by the said Doctor for proof of his words, In Eccle. 10.
via stultus ambulans, cum ipse sit insipiens omnes stultos aestimat. The
dissembler or frail person esteems all others to be like himself.

Let us now see the grounds upon which you build so sinister a conceit, as that
neither our admitting of the authority upon sight of the Breue, was more then
a pretext, nor the peace which some of us made, other then counterfeit,
concluded only in external show for the time, Fol. 148.
upon assurance that there would not want some probable occasion afterward A
charitable surmise of a religious man. Fol. 149.
to break again, and to lay the cause of breach upon the otherside. The only
conjecture you allege of so hard a surmise, is part of an appeal which you
cite in this manner. We whose names are underwritten do contest that we do
appeal, and to have appealed by our former writing, from you to the Sea
Apostolic, as well for our selves as for all our brethren, who have adjoined
themselves unto us in this cause, or shall adioyne themselves hereafter. 6.
Maij 1599.

And having rehearsed this whole passage, you add immediately: By this Appeal
not only for themselves but for all others in like manner that shall join
themselves unto them (which is against the nature of all just appeals) is
easily perceived that an egregious faction was meant. O Lord! who did ever
hear a weaker presumption of so grievous a charge? we did appeal for our
selves and others, which is against the nature of all just appeals. Ergo we
dissembled the peace we made after: Ergo an egregious faction was meant before.
Good consequences. Abel offered Genesis 4.
to God a pleasing sacrifice: Ergo his brother Cain justly killed him. As good
a sequel. The Egyptians oppressed and miserably afflicted the children of
Israel: Ergo the children of Israel committed sin in resigning Exodus 1. 3.

out of the bondage. Mary Magd^^e^ wrought a good work in pouring the box of
precious ointment upon the Mark. 14.
head of our Savior: Ergo Judas taxed her worthily: which follows as well,
as your argument or presumption against us, that therefore we doubled in the
making of peace, as having an intention afterward to break again, and to lay
the cause of breach upon the other side, because we appealed for our selves and
others adhearing unto us. And where we pray you, do you find it written, that
to appeal for others, who have or shall join themselves unto us in the same
cause, is against the nature of all just appeals? Panormitane, the approuedst
Author of all the expositors of the law, calls this manner of appealing,
common and usual. Nota [adhaerentes eisdem] pro communi consuetudine
appellantium, In ca. Olim de accusat* nu. 2.
qui appella^t pro se, and sibi adhaerentibus. Note, says he, by the words of
the law [ adhaerentes eisdem] for the common custom of Appellants, who appeal
for themselves and for those that adhere unto them: which form also of
appealing, he proves to be lawful by the first Chapter, De officio Iudicis
delegati, and by the Chapter, Olim de accusationibus, inquisitionibus, and
denunciationibus. Or be it that the form of our appeal made it doubtful
whether we intended thereby to make an egregious faction, and to that end
dissembled the peace (as how little these things could be doubted of by the
nature of the appeal and our actions, there are none, who are not disposed to
pick quarrels but do see:) yet D. Aug. li. 2. de Sermon Domini. ca. 28.
those that are brought up in the school of charity, know that dubia in

the better sense, and that we ought not without manifest conjectures D. Tho. 2.
2. q. 60. art. 4.
to suspect ill of another, and less, make known and publish our suspicion.

And touching the beadroll of defamations, which you say might have been laid
down against us, if there had been any man there present of the superiors
side to inform the good Doctors: as of pride and arrogancy, of our
disobedient and tumultuous behauiors, of the revel we kept throughout England,
by writing, sending, and persuading against the Popes ordination; what reasons
we invented to discredit the Protectours letters and person, as also the
Archpriest our immediate superior appointed: what terrors we cast into lay
men's heads of admitting foreign authority from the Pope: which tends to a
worse consequence then all the rest. Sir we hope that neither God nor good man
gave you the dispensation you take in deprauing us, and that in points most
open to disproofe. For first concerning the pride and arrogancy you impute
unto us, in that being scarce ten against 300. we durst make so dangerous a
division among Catholics in the sight of the common enemy, and in time of
persecution. What was the dangerous division you thus exaggerate? was it more
then a suppliant entreaty we made to M. Blackwell, that he would not enforce
us to take him for our superior, before such time as we should receive more
certain and particular proof, then yet we did of his Holiness commission to
the Cardinal Protector, for instituting the subordination? Neither did we
barely entreat him to this, but to the end we might the sooner win him
thereunto, we offered and promised to obey him in the mean space, albeit we
would not admit him to the authority he claimed. And that this was our
petition and offer, and consequently the whole division at first, M. Blackwell
himself cannot deny, who in his reioynder to the said petition termed the
same an insolent request, In his Letter to M. Heburne the 2. of March.
adding, that for him to yield thereunto, was nothing else but to yield unto
undutifulness, and to give a preferment to our private inventions. And for the
more clearenesse of this point, because it is of moment, we will here put down
two several writings of others, whom our Archpriest counts the chief of the
faction, and which do most apparently witness so much as is affirmed.

The English.
The year of our Lord 1599. the 8. of March.
I Am demanded whether I will accept the Archpriest for my Superior, and
submit my self unto him. whom some affirm to have been appointed Superior
over all the English Clergy by commandment of his Holiness, some others say
without his commandment, by the most illustrious Cardinal Protector only.

I say, that whereas by occasion of this authority, and by the first
promulgation thereof, many grievous scandals and contentions have grown in the
English Church, and more do grow daily upon that occasion, and whereas it is
affirmed by many Priests, that this authority was not instituted by the
commandment or mandate of his Holiness, but procured by surreption at the
instance of some particular men, without the consent or notice either of all,
or the most part of Priests: in the mean while, since there is order taken by
common suffrage and request of the same Clergy of sending certain to Rome,
to the end to crave of his Holiness the constitution either of Bishops or
suffragans in sundry Provinces of the kingdom, and to appoint them our
governors for releeuing the great necessities of the English Church: and
lastly whereas certain Priests are already gone to Rome to certify his
Holiness of all these affairs, and to advertise what his Holiness shall in
every thing determine and command to be observed: to wit, whether he will
ordain Bishops or an Archpriest over us: I do therefore say, that I can make
no answer to this demand, till such time as it shall more fully appear, what
his Holiness will decree and establish touching this controversy. But so
soon as ever the sentence and decree of his Holiness shall be made known unto
us, I protest I will be ready most promptly, and willingly, to obey the same
in all things. In the mean, till the things be known, I will in nothing
contradict the Archpriest, whom they report to be constituted Superior over
us, neither resist his authority of what nature soever it be, to the end that
Christian peace and charity may remain sound and unblemished in all respects
among us.

This much I John Mush Priest do attest under mine own hand.

Very reverend Sir,
ALthough some be pleased to pass their hard censures of me, yet by the record
of my own conscience, I both fear and am loath to offend, and do no way
affect ignorance: I requested you once heretofore, and now again with all
imstance and like humility do redouble the petition, that I may receive from
you perfect notice of all such particulars wherein your authority binds me to
obey. Suffer not (good sir) an unwilling mind to err, I hope I ask no other
thing, then what of right to me belongs, nor after an undue manner. Verily,
if I see my self, I dare affirm my will and care for such, as I would not for
ought advisedly disobey in any command whereto the most of your authority
stretches* or may justly be extended. In other points wherein my understanding
holds me not tied, I must confess that the manner of usage I have received from
you, and the hard conceits which you carry of me diuulged and brought by many
ways to my hearing, have made me much less respective and of more unfriendly
demeanor then otherwise I should have been, or by nature am inclined to. Fare
you well. 11. of August. 1598.

By him who desires to see and amend that is or has been amiss. I. Colleton.


These show how dangerous the division was which we made among Catholics in
the sight of the common enemy, and in time of persecution, as you describe and
amplify the matter. Neither was the division greater between us, nor
otherwise known but by their own publishing, til such time as father Laster
diuulged his discourse, and our Archpriest decided our disobedience to be alike
enormious, as we could not defend the same without mortal sin. And now also
after the increase of so many wrongs, what have we done? Mary we made suit to
dispute the case with the fathers of the Society, and refused to grant our
selves to be so desperately fallen from grace, and the unity of Gods Church,
as they would needs make the world and our selves believe that we were. Again
being denied this, we sent to the university of Paris for their censure in the
difference. Further, being debarred also under heauiest penalty to maintain
even indirectly the sentence which the university gave for us, we appealed,
having no other refuge, to his Holiness, for redress of the oppressions. And
here lo, was the beginning, progress and quality of the division.

Now we must demand of you father Parsons, that knows thus perfectly how to
aggrauate the matters you take against, whether our delay and sending to Rome,
and our promise to obey M. Blackwell in the mean, were like to make so
dangerous a division, etc. as was the treatise of father Lyster, specially
approved and praised in the rate it was, and highly commended by your self?
Sure if our disunion in not consenting To M. Charnocke whiles he was prisoner
in Rome.
to our other brethren, wherein all learning was with us, and the ordinances of
holy Church against them, and we not knowing when we first dissented, but that
they would demur as we did, about the absolute admittance of the authority,
were a thing so dangerous (as you relate) to be attempted among Catholics in
sight of the enemy, and in time of persecution: the other division which father
Lyster and other of the Jesuits made, was beyond all proportion more
dangerous, as wherein so many fails of modesty, learning, judgment,
civility and charity hudled together. But as our proverb is, some may better
steal a horse, then some others look over the hedge.

For our tumultuous behauiours, for the revel we kept in writing, sending and
persuading against the Popes ordination, for the conuenticles and tumults we
made to draw men into faction, because you barely affirm them without making
any proof, or descending to any one instance, we will leave those that know us
and our actions, to judge of the truth of the accusations, and to take you for
such a one herafter, as the liberty of your pen deciphereth you to be. But
touching the reasons we invented (as you say) to discredit the Protectors
Letters and person: because you set them down in another place what they were
in particular, we will answer unto them. You affirm, that to diminish his
Graces estimation with the Catholics, we wrote he was Protector of the
English College at Rome, and afterward honored by the title of Protector of
England, but Page 17.
we did not grant (say you) that he was so indeed: was not this a high point
in a low house trow ye, and worthy to be taxed by a religious pen? Could his
Graces estimation, especially being more then a tweluemoneth dead before the
writing of the words, be diminished with the Catholics of England thereby,
who never knew him, nor scarce ever heard whether there was such a man or no?
or was our acknowledging of him to be Protector of the English College at
Rome, and our granting that he was afterward honored by the title of
Protector of England, a denial that he was so indeed? who would thus infer
that had his wits about him? But you go onward, and make another reason of our
discrediting his Grace, because (forsooth) we no plainer acknowledging him to
be Protector of England then is said, did add that we were not bound to
believe him in a matter of so large a consequence as the institution of the
Archpriest, without Bull or Breue. A reason much like to the former. For it
has been showed before, that it is no discredit Page 62 and 88.
to a Cardinal not to be believed on his word, in matters greatly prejudicial
to others because according to the Maxim, Non attenditur Decius in ca. Causam
quae. de offic. Deleg. nu. 26.
illa presumptio, quod quis praesumatur bonns, vbi agitur de praeiudicio
tertij: for a man to be holden good, is no presumption to be regarded, where
the matter concerns the prejudice of a third person. You fashion a third
argument for proof that we labored to discredit our Protector, because we
wrote (you say) that he was known to be allied to (...) said to be ruled
altogether against the English scholars and Priests, whose Protector he
pr^tended to be. Are not these weighty exceptions? Will you infer it a
discredit to the Cardinal to be allied to your General? or if not, why do
you allege it? And touching the other part of the reason, are we the first, or
only men who report that the Cardinal was said to be ruled by persons of your
Order, against the scholars and Priests? You would be loath to feed all those
that have, and do make this report besides us. Did his Holiness himself allow
the scholars appellations from the Cardinal Protector, as reputed partial on
the Jesuits side and gave them other visitors, namely Cardinal Sega and Senior
Moro at one time; and at another time, Cardinal Burghesio and the same Senior
Moro? It is strange to see how fondly you reason and leese your self. A
fourth reason of yours consists in that we wrote that his Graces Letters drew
on a general and extreme persecution upon our necks, and consequently were not
to be allowed by us. Sir, here we must tell you that you clippe our words, and
maime or inuert the sense: for these are our words in the place you quote:
[What reason is there that his Graces bare Letters, the contents whereof drew
on so great and extreme persecution upon our necks should be allowed of by us
as a sufficient proof of the delegation?] Now mark how you change them. We
made them a demand, and you make them positive, without asking the question.
We said, the contents thereof drew on so general and extreme persecution;
pointing by the word [so] to the mere punishing jurisdiction, which the
Cardinal gave to the Archpriest, without counterpoise of any commodity at
all, and to the increase of our danger and our Princess disfavor through the
institution thereof: and you turn the word [so] into [a] which cutteth away
the reference. And in stead of our demand, whether his Graces bare letters, so
prejudicial unto us, ought without any further evidence, to be allowed by us,
as a sufficient proof of the delegation: you come in with a consequently they
were not to be allowed by us, omitting that addition of ours, as a sufficient
proof of the delegation. And if doubt be made, whether the contents of the
Constitutiue Letter can be said to draw on a persecution, let the Jurisdiction
granted to the Archpriest, of removing us from the places of our residences:
of binding us to stand to his decision and arbitrament, in the doubts and
controversies that shall arise: of prescribing what he lists, and of forcing
us to obey the same under loss of our faculties: Let these and other of like
quality declare, whether the contents of the Cardinals Letter may not bear
the name of moving a persecution, when the person to whom the like ample
authority was committed, was promoted to the office, and directed in the
execution thereof, by those that are the chiefest and most potent parties of
the other side of the difference: yea, the very setters down of the
ordinances. Verily whatsoever others may think in this point, yet we that are
the sufferers, and against whom the spleen is borne, do feel more
aggrieuances, and a heavier weight of persecution by the use or abuse of the
jurisdiction granted, then we do by the strait condition of the laws of our
country. In brief, for conclusion of the premises, and for binding up all to
our greater reproach, you say, It is sufficient to show our passionate and
discomposed minds, for that, the Cardinal protector now gone to God, having
been to all our nation a most dear patron and father in all occasions, we
notwithstanding, in all speeches and writings do speak every where very
unkindly and irreverently of him. Sir, if we should ask you, what these
vnreuerent speeches and writings were, the instances would be to seek, unless
you devised matter of your own coining Or to let this pass, whom should we
believe, you, or the famous Cardinal Allen gone also to God? who told M. Mush,
that the said Protector never did, nor ever would, as he feared, do good to our
country. And we are sure, that few or none tasted any part of that you
report, except M. Haddocke (who left our camp, without any great loss to our
cause) and perchance some other devoted persons whom you recomme^ded. And here
we humbly request, that we may not be thought to write this (being more then
any of us wrote before) either upon another motive, or to other end, then we
did; that is, to purge our selves of the note of hateful ingratitude, which
you impute unto us, and to show how little belief you deserve in many of your
writings.

Touching the last calumne in the beadrole, vz. the terrors we cast Fol. 117.
into lay men's heads, of admitting foreign authority from the Pope, which
tends (you say) to a worse consequence then all the rest, and by which (as
Fol. 14. 15 and 16.
you write in another place) his Holiness and all other godly and learned men
may see and pity us, but especially our spirit of vindicatiue and maleuolous
proceeding, etc. We answer; that you seem by this course construction of our
words, to carry a very sharp disposition of wounding us in the speedingest
place you can. Is your religious charity no more? That which was affirmed, was
only that by the opinions of diverse men In the copy of Discourses. page 6.
of judgment in the laws of our country, this our admitting of the
Archpresbyteriall jurisdiction, may (by law) and will (by likelihood) be drawn
within the compass of an old law of Praemunire made in a Catholic time,
because it is an external jurisdiction, brought into our Realm against the
will and notice of our Prince and country. This was the sum, and the worst
of all that was written: and the cause of the writing was to yield a reason why
we deferred to receive the Subordination upon view of the Cardinals Letter;
namely, because the prejudice it might this way turn us unto, was great, and
great by an ancient law of the Realm. Which brought us into a most certain
opinion, that we were no ways obliged in conscience (notwithstanding the
contrary position of the Jesuits and our Archpriest) to admit the
Subordination upon the sole credence of the Cardinals Letter, the prejudice we
should incur by the admitting thereof, being as we have said, so great to our
selves, and profitable to none; and consequently, that which most of any other
thing did justify our delay. Because no writer, who is See the Authors quoted
page 61. 62. ^ 89.
largest in the prerogatives of Cardinals but does hold, that in matters of
very great prejudice, a Cardinal is not to be believed upon his word, in
things that he relates to have received from another. So that the cause which
enforced us to mention the said law of Praemunire, being no other then to
justify our bearing off, or to free our selves in the crimes objected against
us by father Lyster and others, and our words also which ensued in the very
next page, witnessing that his Holiness least command should ever bind us,
though with hazard and loss of our lives, to accept of any Ecclesiastical
jurisdiction which he should appoint and make known unto us, after a Canonical
manner: we cannot but marvel, what passion guided or rather blinded your pen, in
running thus eagerly upon us without just or colorable cause given, if you had
been pleased to understand our intention and words aright. And we marvel the
more hereat, in respect you fall into this inuectiue humor, after our deeds
had verified our words, and we really admitted the subordination, according to
our promise, upon the first appearance of his Holiness Breue, notwithstanding
the danger of the foresaid law of Praemunire, standing in force and inlisting
us within the penalties thereof for so doing. A fact, wherein we little doubt
whether the clergy of France or Spain would have followed us, if the case
had been theirs, but would have respited their acceptance, notwithstanding the
Breue, till his Holiness had been otherwise and fuller advertised, and the
mischief provided for.

But now we being so few, that is to say, some five or six, and such as we
Fol. 15 and 119
were; (for so scornefully do you terne us) small account perchance is to be
made of our right, specially standing against the design of a Jesuit: we have
to allege, Nulla erit distantia personarum, ita paruum audietis vt magnum.
That in discussing of rights, there is no difference Deuteronomy. 1.
of persons or number to be respected, but the case of the few and small is to
be tendered as well as the case of the many and great.

Your other assertions that we by our foresaid naming of the Statute of
Praemunire labored to cast terrors into lay men's heads of admitting foreine
authority from the Pope, and that we would have the Princes consent to be
needful for the legitimatio of the new authority, and denominate our selves,
being but some five or six, to be the Country, and that we also opposed our
selves against the Subordination, for that his Holiness had not asked our
consents. These are so ill deductions, so far fetched, and sauouring so
strongly of the old leven, that whosoever reads them must hold you far gone
in passion, or drowned in indignation against us. Did the Subordination
concern any lay man at all, when we mentioned the Statute of Praemunire? The
Constitutiue letter is as flat as flat may be, against any such inference or
interpretation. For it only instituteth M. Blackwell Archpriest over the
Seminary priests abiding in England or Scotland, and gives him not the least
authority in the world over the Laity, or so much as once touches any such
matter. How shamefully therefore do you wrest our words, since when we first
wrote them, the Subordination implied none of the Laity, and were only
printed to show, by reason that we were no such lewd persons, nor entangled in
the censures of holy Church, as father Lyster with his adherents did most
ignorantly or most uncharitably censure and diuulge us to be. We assure our
selves father Parsons, that your restless spirit and pen, your enterprising
and busy actions have turned heretofore our Catholic Professants to infinite
prejudice; for to no known cause can we impute so much the making of the
severe laws of our country, as to your edging attempts and prouocations. And
as we assure our selves of this: so do we fear least this your notorious
playing and descanting upon our words, and your forward endeavors to Fol. 15.
110. 117. and 132.
draw all things after your own by as, may more endomage their hard state,
then they will be ready or have cause to thank you for. Did you mean to bid
all truth and modesty farewell, when you determined to put down in print that
here is nothing but maleuolence and disobedience Fol. 15.
discovered, with desire to bring the Archpriest and all those which obey him
within the compass of temporal laws and treason. Has our mention of
Praemunire so soon hatched treason? And are you sure that so wicked a desire
did possess us? Fie, fie, the liberty of your pen and conscience appalleth.

To end our answer to this your fifth exception against the Censure of Paris,
we would know what decision others do think that the said Doctors would have
given in our case, if we had laid down in the state of the question, that the
chief plotters, and procurers of the Subordination were some of the fathers of
the Society, and none their cooperators or vnder-workmen in the action, but
such only as were suborned or set on by them: that those who defined our
bearing off and sending to Rome to be the sin objected, were some of the
Society: that those who reported us to be excommunicate, irregular, without
faculties, infamous persons, sacrificers in mortal sin, and the giuers of
poison in lieu of medicine, were some of the Society: that those who most
precisely abandoned our company, and would not execute any divine office in
our presence, nor in the presence of our lay-adherents, were some of the
Society: that those who broched our troubles, reared the tumults, revived the
contention, disquieted our Catholic communion, made parties or faction among
Priests, kindled dissension between the laity and clergy, made dislike and
division betwixt nearest friends, and blew the coals to all our stirs, were
some of the Society, acknowledged in the Epistle of Pius Greil fol. 7. who
first entering into our labors, we welcomed with all honor, we gave them the
pre-eminence, we acquainted them with our friends and places, we extolled their
order, and in a sort received them as the Galathians did S. Paul, that is, as
Angels of God, and with like tender affection, as if it could have been, we
would have plucked out our own eyes to have given them unto them. We say, if
we had particularized these things in the body of the question as we did
conceal them, and did not so much as insinuate that any father of the
Society had a finger or his assent in the accusations: what would the learned
Doctors have said, how would they have blushed and blessed themselves at the
demonstration of the ingratitude?

Your sixth and last exception: That no man was present in Paris to tell the
Doctors how falsely we put down in the question, that it seemed to us by
certain words of the Cardinals letters, that the Archpriest his authority was
granted by false information, and that partiality was used in the choice of
him, and his assistants, and that our messengers to Rome, were not sent to lay
open our difficulties to his Holiness, but rather to contradict and make a
broyle in Rome. Sir, we pray you to tell us whom you take your self to be?
Must these be false because you affirm them so, without making any proof at
all of their falsitie? Verily we repute you for no such man as yet: and how
little these your words do deserve such a respect, let the instances set down
in our first Reason declare, which do Page 16. and sequentem.
manifest false information most apparently. Yea good nature would rather have
commended the temper of our information, then reproved it, we saying no more
but it seemed to us by certain words of the Cardinals Letters, that the
Archpriest his authority was granted by false information etc. when the
matter we auerred, was most evident by the testimony of the whole Realm. For
who is so shameless as will affirm, either that the Catholic Laity were at
dissension amongst themselves, or the secular Priests amongst themselves, or
that both of these two were at variance one against the other? Auowances
expressed in the Cardinals letter, and alleged as the sole cause of
instituting the Subordination. Sure, how worldly wise soever you are in other
points, yet in this you show little: that would iterate and contend to bear
down a matter with the sole weight of your own denial, wherein there be
thousands that know and can convince the contrary. Saint Thomas, and common
reason teach, that peccare mente obstinata aggrauat 2. 2. q. 88. art. 6. c.
peccatum, to maintain an untruth with a wilful mind, increases the malice
of the sin.

And whether partiality was used in the choice of the Archpriest and his
counselors, or no: we leave it to the common voice of our brethren to
determine, and to the woeful effects which have merely proceeded from the
imperfection and distemperature of the manner of governing: hoping that there
are none of right judgment, but will see by the pieces of letters and other
writings which follow, that we had reason to note partiality in the choice of
the Archpriest and his counselors. Tantum absunt illi pij patres ab omni

The English.
So far are these holy fathers estraunged from all appetite of seeking to
bear rule, as in every place they prefashion unto us an exemplar of rare
humility, mildness, patience, piety and charity. Certes we should be very
ungrateful if we should not honor them as our fathers, embrace them with love
as friends, reverence them with duty as liberal benefactors, with study to
imitate them as masters, acknowledge them with affection of piety, as the
chiefest adiutors and most earnest mainntainers of the safety of our country,
and the good state of our Church tossed with sundry tempests. Those that
diminish their praises, neither know themselves nor them. For who are they
amongst us that furnish Priests at their first coming from beyond the Priests
that are now most defamed.
seas, but the Fathers of the Society? The harbourlesse are received by them,

destitute of meat, drink and money, are maintained by them, and those that
cannot tell where to abide, because they are unknown, have horses and other
things necessary for their iourneys most readily of them, and places also most
prudently designed where they may commendably apply their labors in recovering
the lapsed, in strengthening Catholics, and in propagating the service of God.
Neither is their charity contained in these bounds: for we our selves who have
for many years born the burden and heat of the day, do freely confess to have
had from their fountains in our necessity, greatest succor and consolation.
If your Grace did know what sums of money the Fathers of their proper
patrimonies have consumed (for it is little that comes to them of alms) in
such and other deeds of charity, and how promptly they have always showed
them selves in releeuing prisoners, and others incombred and oppressed with
diverse difficulties of things and times: I doubt not but you would by and by
restrain the unbridled boldness of those who gored with the pricks of envy,
have any whit dimmed the estimation and charity of the Fathers Thus far M.

generally reported, was his greatest furtherance. And since his promoting

to all parties, he would choose some one or more of the Assistants that were
left to him to nominate, out of the number of those of the other side, but he

administratione remouerentur. Non enim vuae ex spinis colligi possunt, nec ex
tribulis ficus. That is: Ye desire that some of yours, admitted to the
communion of our authority, may be chosen into the number of the counselors.
But what other thing would ensue thereof but a monster, composed of contrary
and diverse dispositions of mind, repugning one the other? This will not be to
make peace, but after the manner of fighting clouds, to send forth the
lightning of dissension, by whose force we all should be slain, and burnt with
the heat of the flame. That no such thing might happen, our most Illustrious
Lord Protector has most prudently provided, that those who were the authors of
making war and bicke^ings with the Fathers, should be removed from all charge
and government of matters among us. For grapes cannot be gathered of thorns,
nor figs of thistles.

Moreover the said Cardinal Protector, or to speak as the truth is, father
Parsons in his name, used these words in the sixth Instruction annexed to the
Subordination: Licet Superior ille ex consultoribus Archipraesbyteri non sit,
quia tamen summopere expedit suaque Sanctitatis id omnino cupit, atque
pracipit, vt inter Patres and Sacerdotes summa sit animorum vnio, ac consensio,
and quia dictus Superior pro sua in rebus Angliae experientia, pro eaque quam
apud Catholicos habet, authoritate plurimum poterit, ad omnes Sacerdotum
consultationes adiument^ adferre, curabit Archipraesbyter in rebus maioribus
indic^um quoque eius consiliumque acquirere, vt omnia ordinatius ac maiori luce
ac pace ad diuinam gloriam dirigantur. That is: Although the Superior of the
Jesuits be not one of the Archpriests Assistants, yet because it is very
greatly expedient, and his Holiness does wholly desire and command, that there
should be nearest union of minds and consent between the Fathers and the
Priests, and because the said Superior, for his experience in English
affairs, and for the authority which he has with the Catholics, can most
benefit and further all the consultations of the Priests, the Archpriest in
greatest matters shall take care to seek his judgment and counsel, to the
end that all things may the more orderly and with greater light and peace be
directed to the glory of God.

Now we appeal to the judgment of the wise, whether these things do not seem
(and this was all that we said) to bewray partiality in the choice of the
Archpriest and his counselors. Or whether the contention now on foot among
us, (and for appeasing whereof the Subordination is said to be instituted)
being betwixt the Jesuits and the Secular Priests, were like by this choice to
take an happy or a peaceable end, when the Superior appointed, had before so
engaged him self in the false praises of the one side, and alike untruly
derogated from the due deserts of the other: when all the Assistants must be of
the Jesuits party, and none for us whom they impugned: when father Garnet our
capital adversary, by express order must be called to consultation in all
matters of moment, and nothing pass without his advice: when his calling also
to consultation must be holden for a supreme benefit and furtherance of
matters, and for a greater increase of order, light, peace, and the glory of
God; and yet the admitting of any of our side to the same consultation, must be
deemed as little consonant to peace and reason, as for men to seek grapes upon
thorns, or figs upon thistles: when finally some of those that were chosen
Assistants, and perchance chosen for so kind a part, had testified to the
Cardinal under their hands in the behalf of the Jesuits, that they knew
the accusations which were exhibited or given out to be exhibited in a
memorial against them to be false: (a testimony which they could not possibly
give in the manner they did, unless they had been their guardian Angels, and
present at all times, and every where with them:) undoubtedly if these and
other perticulers we could recite bear no note or badge of partiality; then
surely neither heat is a quality of fire, nor moisture of water, nor the nose
a visible thing in a man's face.

Now then if you father Parsons strive to inualidate the censure of Paris, and
would make it of no force, because no man was there present to speak of the
Archpriests side, nor to reprove the reasons of our Information; how infinitely
more may we return the same arguments back upon you, for weakening or
avoiding the force of the Constitutiue letter, and his Holiness two Breues? For
who was there in Rome that advertised either the Cardinal or his holiness of
the state of matters in our country, but your self, and such trunks as you
spoke through? Who was there that informed either of them how ill and iealously
our Prince and the State would conster any form of government your self
should erect or procure? Who was there to controwle the falsities of your
reasons, to check your slanderous reports, to discover the end of your drifts,
or to acquaint them with your unconscionable trade of dealing? Who was there,
to give them to understand how contentious you have bin ever counted, and how
ouerlong and troublesomely you have marchandized the Crown and Kingdom? Who
was there to show his Holiness the contrarieties of the first Breue to the
Cardinals Letters, and of the second Breue to them both, and how grossly you
carried your self, especially in setting down the points of the later Breue, in
which the demonstrations of surreption are so plenty, and palpable, as the
meanest capacity may feel and handle them? Briefly, who was there in Rome, to
inform his Holiness or that highest Court, how deeply, several of your
actions have derogated from the most venerable reputation of that divine humane
Consistory, and how your oppressions and crafty stoppings of justice has
scandalized infinite in our country, as well Catholic as Protestant, that we
say nothing of foreign Potentates? Verily we assure our selves, that if these
things had been delivered to his Holiness, and all matters, how they passed,
uprightly unfolded, his holy zeal of justice and most compassionable heart,
would never have suffered you so long to sway matters as you have done, and much
less would his blessed fatherhood have refused our appeal without plainer
decision of our case in the accusation and injuries objected, and without
restoring us to the use of our faculties, or commanding the least satisfaction
for the damages sustained being innumerable and most great, yea and that
without making mention at all of the Jesuits, or comprizing them under the
censure of the Breue, notwithstanding they were the only authors of the
calumniation imputed, and the most stiff and continual maintainers thereof.

Albeit we have been long in our reply to these exceptions, nevertheless we
must crave the Readers patience, to touch a by-point or two which the father
interlaceth in the treaty of the said exceptions. The first is, that whereas
the Sorbone Doctors, did according to custom observed in all other the like
resolutions, set down the persons, day, year, and place, where, when, and by
whom, the case was decide^; Father Parsons, for that we should know, he keeps
his old wont of gibing, gives a pretty frumpe by clipping their words, and
adding of a parenthesis. Their words were these: Viri principes etc. The chief
and principal men of the faculty of Divinity in Paris, selected out of the
whole faculty assembled together in the house of the Senior Beadle etc. Which
passage father Parsons curtalleth and carpeth at in this manner: No marvel if
these Doctors that were chosen Fol. 116.
to meet in the Senior Beadles house about this matter (for so it is set down
also in this printed book) did lightly ouerpasse the matter etc. Where it is
to be noted that in stead of [ chosen or selected out of the whole faculty of
Divinity, and assembled together in the house of the Senior Beadle] he loppeth
the words and says, were chosen out to meet in the Senior Beadles house: as
who would jest, that these famous clarks were chosen out to meet in the
Beadles house, and not selected out of the whole faculty to resolve all doubts
which should happen to be sent to the University for their resolution. Or if
father Parsons had no intention to gibe by contracting the words, then let him
tell the reason why he added the parenthesis [ for so it is set down in this
printed booke] the words being the words of the Doctors themselves, and put
down for the causes above mentioned.

The second thing we will touch, is, the favor that father Parsons pretends
to show us, in that he will not impugn the censure of Paris further, then for
that it cleared us from all sin, for of the other Fol. 115.
point of schism, he says, he will not talk at all. Are we not greatly
beholden unto him? His holiness second Breue was not extant when he wrote the
Apology, as himself gives notice in the Appendix* and therefore that was no
cause why he omitted to urge this point against us. What then might it be, that
caused this favor in him toward us? Was it in respect he misliked the
imputation of that crime? No, for he commended the Treatise of father Lister to
M. Charnocke; and said to M. Barnby in approuance thereof, that if we should
reconcile any body, we did no more then if we should reclaim one from Atheism
to heresy. Or did he befriend us thus far, in regard that by conniuence of the
fault, he might the sooner atone the difference, or for that he would not
taint our good names? Let his deprauing terms, let his exaggerations, his
fetching of matters a far off, his bewayling our state, his winding of himself
into narrowest creekes for small advantage against us, his fear of our revolt,
his doubtful and half speeches wounding us deeper with the reader, then if he
had spoken all he could and plainly. Let the inuectiues and bitterness he uses
throughout the Apology and the Appendix, bear witness whether he omitted to
handle that point for benefit of the common cause, peace, or our good names; or
for that the assertion was so absurd, so childish, so contrary to all
learning, judgment and common sense, and for such condemned also by some of
the best in his religion, Fa. Magio and others.
as without utter wrack of his credit, he could not occupy his pen in defense
of the paradoxe. What others will think in this point, we know not, but our
selves seem most sure hereof.

The other points that we would have the reader to note in the delating and
proof of the exceptions, are the words he uses, that he will Fol. 115.
not presume to determine any degree of sin touching the deferring of our
obedience to the Archpriest, but will leave that to God and to the offenders
consciences: and likewise his declaration, that well we might have spared Fol.
118.
to print the Censure of Paris, but that M. Champney would make a vain
flourish with the ostentation of an Academicall sentence. Of like he wrote the
former without any deliberation, or did not afterward remember what he had
written, because in the eleventh chapter he defines resolutely, Fol. 172.
that we were bound under grievous sin by all rules of true divinity to have
obeyed with far less evidence then was showed unto us. Which doubtless
seems to be written when his judgment was asleep, as may appear by that
which is said before, Page 61. and 62. Deuteron. 19.
and by the text of holy scripture: In ore duorum vel trium testium stabit omne
verbum. In the mouth of two or three witnesses every word shall stand. And
touching his opinion, that we might well have spared the printing of the
Censure of Paris, we need say no more but that such outfacing words do way
little with the wise, who know, that where shame is not, the like words may be
spoken of any truth in the world. And likewise know, that put case all the
exceptions were true which are alleged against the Censure, yet the same
Censure does clear us of father Listers imputation, and of enormious
disobedience: because if it were either of these crimes, our deferring could
not be but sin in the fact considered in it self, which the censure denies,
and that we had so wicked and devilish intention as to cut our selves from
holy church, or rebel against any lawful superior, in a deed lawful in it
self, as the University defined our deferring to be, we think our
adversaries will Math. 7. Romans 14. Iac. 4. D. Tho. 22. q. 60. art. 2. and 6.
and q. 67. art. 1.
not say it, and we are sure they cannot say it without guilt of usurped
judgment, and most grievous sin to their souls, and so leaving these
matters, we will return and prove that the authority as it has bin
practiced, infringeth, or dispenses with the law of nature.

THe authority as M. Blackwell has hitherto demeaned it, either dispenses
with the law of nature, or violateth the same, in that he, by virtue of the
authority prohibited the accused to defend Clem. ca. pastoralis de re iud.
caet^ru^.
themselves. A right (if any other) taught by nature her self. And that he
has thus done, the proves be many, and undeniable. Father Lister accused us of
a foul crime: the infamy was diuulged in all parts of the Realm, and in many
places beyond the seas: our company grew thereon to be shunned: our benefactors
were put in fear that their souls would find smart in the next world, for
harboring of us in their houses: several means were practiced, and attempts
given to remove us, * and not to leave us where to hide our heads. * Father
Garnet In his letter the tenth of November.
the superior of the Jesuits affirmed that we ministered, and received
sacraments in deadly sin, that we gave poison in liew of medicine, that we
were such, by the opinion of all the learned, as his brother Lister had
censured us to be, that our criminous, sinful, irregular, and excommunicate
state, was so plain and notorious, as none under sin could forward, or
assist us in the exercise of our functions: Priests were dealt withal, and
favors promised, so as they would affirm or report us guilty of the crimes
objected. To make our oppressions great enough, a Roman resolution without name
of the author was published against us by our Archpriest, and direction given
by him, that none should absolve us in confession, before we would acknowledge
and make satisfaction for the enormities wherewith we were charged. Likewise,
to increase our burden, father Jones gave forth, and our superior said the
position was true, that whosoever maintained us not to be the abandoned
creatures which father Lister judged us to be, incurred ipso facto for such
their defending of us, the censures of holy church. What shall we say? Our
Archpriest himself charged us with enormious disobedience and to live a
graceless state: and in * In his letters of the 21. and 27. of February, and
of the 14. of March 1600.
the letters wherein his Reverence thus censured us, (which were also made
common over the Realm) he forbad us (being no otherwise condemned) under
threate of suspendin^ us presently from the use of our function either by word,
or writing, to defend the disobedience imputed. Again, there was neither
mean, nor measure observed, in multiplying of afflictions upon us: M.
Blackwell in his decree of the 18. of October 1600. denounces, and declares
us to have bin truly disobedient to the Sea Apostolic, and rebellious against
his office: and in the next paragraffe of the same decree prohibiteth all of us
in virtue of holy obedience, and under pain of suspension and interdict, and
under loss of all our faculties ipso facto to be incurred, not any manner of
way, by word or writing, directly, or indirectly, to presume to defend the
disobedience whereof he immediately before condemned us. Was there ever greater
injustice heard of upon earth? Can that ecclesiastical, secular, or profane
Judge be named, who before Iuridicall condemnation forbad under like, or so
grievous penalties, any offender guilty of what crime soever to defend his
reputation? Pope Clement the fifth affirms, that focultas defensionis Clem.
ca. pastoralis de re iud.
quae a iure prouenit naturali adimi non valet, liberty of defending our self
proceeding from the law of Nature cannot be forbidden. And what is more
ingraffed in nature, or a deeper instinct thereof, then not being convicted,
nor condemned, to defend our good names?

We do not deny that the deferring of our obedience to the Constitutiue Letter
and Archpriest, was notorious, we mean publicly known, but that this
deferring and protracting of our subjection till the coming of his Holiness
Breue, was either enormious disobedience, or any of the other crimes pretended,
this we deny to be notorious, or to be true at all. That kind of defense
which consists in denying the unlawfulness of a fact acknowledged to be done,
cannot be taken away by the prerogative of the Prince, or by any law. Sum
accusatus de homicidio, fateor, sed volo me defendere quia feci me defendendo,
ista defensio tolli non potest: I am In ca. ex part 2 de offi. delegat. nu. 4.
says Felinus accused of Homicide, I confess the fact, but I will defend that
I did it in my own defense, or upon some other lawful cause, this defense
cannot be impeached. The like has In ca. dilecti de except. nu. 13.
Panormitan, In repert. verb. defensio.
Benedictus Vadus, and others. And if this kind of defense, so intrinsecall a
right of nature and justice could be, or were once imbarred, alas, what
oppressions would there presently appear in the world, what villainies swarm
every where? For would not every charge, even against innocence it self be a
condemnation, when the party charged, and not condemned by law, must not be
permitted to speak in his own defense, nor in purgat on of the sclaunder
objected? Non sufficit quod factum sit notorium nisi etiam sint notoriae
qualitates ipsius facti, scilicet quod nulla defensio, sieve excusatio competat.
The notoriousnes of the fact is not sufficient, as In sua prac. cano. li. 3. de
modo procedendi in criminibus notorus conclu. 1.
Alfonsus Vilagut writes, for the Judge to proceed to the condemnation of any
one, unless the qualities, and all the circumstances of the same fact be
likewise so notoriously ill, as no defense, excuse, or tergiuersation can be
pretended to the contrary: which if it be so, how much more does the same hold
true, ere the Judge or ecclesiastical superior can forbid the accused to
defend their vnguiltines, especially before trial and iuridicall condemnation?

other of account; that a statute or decree which prohibiteth the accused to
defend themselves, is of no validity: by reason it impugneth the very instinct
of nature, and of that kind of intrinse call instinct of nature which most
properly belongs and proceeds from reason. Alas 1 Cor 4.
must now the ministers of Christ, and the dispensators of the mysteries of
God, be inferior to the Bandite or outcast of the world, in so conscionable a
duty? Must Priests being called the Malach 2.
Angels of the Lord of hosts, the children S. Ambr.
of S. Peter, and the vicars of the Apostles, not receive that tribute of
justice which cannot be denied to the Devil? Undoubtedly if this, being the
practice of the authority and our case, be not to break the law of nature,
or to dispense therein, our wits, judgment, and common reason are clean
extinguished, and all the learned must needs go to school again; but to the
third breach.

AS the authority is practiced, it either transgresses the law of man and
holy church, or else makes our Archpriest a dispensor with himself in the
same. And to begin our proves hereof with his transgressings of the
Constitutiue Letter. The said letter, only makes him Archpriest over the
secular priests, and gives him no jurisdiction at all over the Laytie,
especially to interdict the^. Also the letter gives him authority to
restrain, and take away priests their faculties, but grants him no
jurisdiction to impose any ecclesiastical censure either suspension,
interdict, or excommunication upon them. These things are all apparent in the
letter, save that only about the censure of suspension, there may some vain
cavil, but no substantial doubt be made, if places be conferred together, and
no words oueruiolently divorced from their fellows in the same clause. The
words which can only make for show of aucthority to suspend are these, Si quis
his in rebus In the constitutiue letter page 2.
inobedientem se, aut inquietum, aut contumacem ostenderit, hunc, post debitum
admonitione^ ac reprehensiones fraterna charitate praemissas, liccat etiam
paenis coercere ecclesiasticis: ablatione nimirum facultum, vel suspensione, If
any one in these matters, shall show himself disobedient, unquiet, or
stubborn, it is lawful after due admonition and reprehensions, first used in
brotherly charity, to correct this party by ecclesiastical penalties, viz.
by ablation of faculties or suspending. Our Archpriest, and the maintainers of
his claim of having authority to suspend us from the Altar, and other divine
offices, do separate and abstract the word [ Suspending] from the word [
Faculties] and would have it to signify the general Censure of suspension,
and not the penalty of suspending faculties only. To which we answer, that
the said separation, and understanding of the word, cannot be true, because the
Cardinal particularising the faculties he gives to the Archpriest, makes no
mention of suspending from the Altar or other divine offices, but only
rehearses these two, facultatum restrictio, aut etiam reuocatio, si id
necessitas postulauerit, the restraining of faculties, or also the reuoking of
them if necessity shall require it. So that in the first place, the Cardinal
declares the faculties he gives to the Archpriest for him to chastise us, if
need be. And in the second he directs him when, how, and upon what cause, he
should use the said punishing faculties.

And thus having showed the reason, and our own grounds, why we assure our
selves that our Archpriest has not authority to suspend us from the Altar,
or from any other divine office, save only from the using of our faculties, let
us see the proofs by which he practices and justifies the contrary.

After that M. Blackwell had suspended and interdicted me and diverse others, I
addressed this Letter following unto him.

SIr, M. Iackson has showed me the By which he suspended and interdicted eight
of the prisoners in Framingham and my self.
writing that Master N. delivered him from you. These are (as much as I may
without prejudice to my appeal) to request you, first to give me to understand
by what authority, you interdicted me, in respect that neither the letters
patent, nor his Holiness Breue, nor any addition that I ever heard of, gives
you any show of the like jurisdiction. Secondly, if you have more authority
then the Constitutiue Letter, the Additions, Instructions, and the Breue
import, yet to vouchsafe to let me know the ground and warrantize you proceed
upon, in suspending and Because as Nauar writes li. 5. cons. de sent. exco
cons. 65. nu. 5. that no one can be declared excommunicated, suspended, or
interdicted without summo^s, and being heard before: and if without these he be
declared, the declaration is none by the law it self.
declaring me to be interdicted without citing me before. Thirdly, that being
the imposer of these heavy censures, you would not refuse to acquaint me by
what law or right you can (having admitted my appeal) take this severe
course, so infinitely both to my own hurt, and to the temporal, and
spiritual damage of many others. Fourthly, to instruct me, by what rule of
conscience you charge me with fraud, and so grieuouslie punish me for the
same, making it a cause of inflicting the censures, for that M. Thrensham,
master Cope, and M. Button, who sithence have renewed, and sent their several
appeals to master Blackwell.
three names were put to the appeal, which the parties themselves, whose names
they were, do now deny to have yielded their consents thereunto, wherein I am
as free, be it true, or be it otherwise, from all fault, (the setting down of
their names being no act of mine) as your self, or any man in the world. You
say, because I sent you the appeal, a weaker color could not be set out: I
expect a better reason, or else I must think the injury to be most great.
That M. Trensham was put down in the appeal by the name of Potter, (this
being the name whereby he was usually called both in Rome and Wisbich, and
taken to be his right name) is so light an error, as amongst the wise, not
worth the reckning of. I desire to receive your answer and satisfaction to
these, and in writing, as you delivered my rebukes. Or if you mean not to
deal so charitably with me, I would by these advertise you, that there is
small reason why I should make scruple to serve God in wonted manner. Our Lord
forgive you and father Garnet, if his advise be to these afflictions, as
without his advise, one of the Instructions directs you not to do any thing
of weight: I leave, not mistrusting but when the extremities are truly known,
a good part of Christendom will cry shame upon the injustice and measure.
Tenth of March when I received yours 1600.

Your Reuerences John Colleton.


M. Blackwell either disdaining, or not thinking it meet, notwithstanding the
just petitions of my letter to return me answer, wrote a letter to M. Iackson
for him to show unto me, which was also diuulged in the North, and God knows
in what other parts of our realm, if not every where. In which letter after it
had phansied his revenge to call me the son of Beliall, and to apply these
places of scripture unto me, ab immundo quid mundabitur, and a mendace, quid
verum dicetur? Et, Eccle. 34. and 14.
qui sibi nequam est, cui alij bonus erit? What shall be cleansed by the
unclean, and what truth can be spoken by a liar? And he that is wicked unto
himself, to whom will he be good? He goes on, and uses these words, But my
authority in interdicting is denied, when it is evident both His letter to M.
Iackson the 18 of March 1600.
by the letters of mine institution, and also by the Breue, that I may,
inquietos paenis coercere ecclesiasticis: and that I am appointed
Archipresbyter Catholicorum Anglorum pro foelici gubernio and regimine, ac
mutua dilectione catholicorum etc. The wayward man is to know that the
Canonists agree herein, that, qui habet iurisdictionem in foro externo, potest
infligere censuras: yea he may read that, Praelatus inferior Episcopo, potest
facere statuta penalia contra subditos, statuendo paenam ad eius arbitrium.

him what I may do ex iure communi, if other sufficient warrant wanted. My
ground I rest upon, in declaring him to be interdicted without Citation before,
is to be found out of Siluester verb. Citatio nu. 5. Write to him and to M.
Clarke, I mind not, until I write to punish them farther etc. Hitherto the
words of M. Blackwell, and for more perspicuitie we will accommodate, and
distinguish our answer by parts, according to the parcels of his proofs and
allegations.

First where as his Reverence affirms that both by the letters of his
institution and by the Breue he may correct the unquiet by ecclesiastical
penalties: we grant it to be true. Nevertheless, if he will infer hereby (as
he must, or else what he says is to no purpose) that therefore he has
authority to suspend from the Altar and to interdict, we deny the consequence.
And the words immediately following in the Cardinals letter do utterly
contradict any such illation, in that they limite and specify, what penalties
these should be, namely, ablatione facultatum vel suspensione, either by taking
away of faculties, or by suspending the use of them, as it has bin proved
before. Neither is there any one word of suspending from the Altar, or
interdicting, either in the Constitutiue Letter, or his Holiness Breue.

Again, let the word [ suspending] be extended, contrary to the tenor of the
Cardinals letter, and the circumstances of the place, to signify the
ecclesiastical censure of suspending from the practice of all divine
functions, as our Archpriest would enlarge it unto: yet nevertheless how can
the censure of interdict (which he has imposed upon certain of our company by
name, as well as the censure of suspension) be understood, to be contained under
the limits of his authority, when neither the letters of his institution, nor
his Holiness Breue do express, or imply in general or particular terms any
such jurisdiction, as may be seen by every one who will but read the said
letters and Breue? And here we can but note the indirect or deceitful dealing,
which is offered in citing places so by halfes, for proof of the things they
would prove against us, as if they did not maime or divide the sentence, by
leaving out words which immediately follow in the place, the very same
authorities which they allege for proof of matters against us, would most
disprove their own sayings. For example: After that our Archpriest had
interdicted some nine of us by name, I wrote unto him the aforesaid letter,
requesting his Reverence to advertise (if he would have us to obey him therein)
by what authority he inflicted the like Censures upon us, because neither the
Constitutiue letter, nor the additio^s annexed thereunto, did give him any such
kind of jurisdiction over us: who to prove that he had authority to interdict
us, affirms that by the letters of his institution, and also by the Breue, he
may inquietos poenis coercere ecclesiasticis, correct the unquiet with
ecclesiastical penalties, leaving forth the words which immediately followed,
and which specified with what ecclesiastical penalties he should correct,
ablatione nimirum facultatum vel suspensione, namely, by taking away their
faculties or suspending. Which words, and part of the sentence, if M. Blackwell
had not left out, the very place he alleged for proof of his authority, did
most clearly demonstrate and convince the contrary. Neither is this the first
time, that such kind of foul play has bin offered us: for in the third of the
twelve questions (which our Archpriest, or father Garnet in his name proposed
unto us to be answered, in stead of granting the dispute we entreated, In sua
eccle. rep. de statu Ill. Cardinal. nu. 9.
for ending of the controversy) the like pranck is practiced, the propounder
alleging Zecchius to affirm that, against us for them, which if the whole
sentence had bin taken, and not cut off guilefully in the mids, it had made
most strongly for us against them. Zecchius words are these, Cardinali
creditur testanti sibi aliquid a Papa viuae vocis oraculo mandatum, vt quod
restituat aliquem natalibus, si tamen de magno alicuius praeiudicio agatur, ei
non creditur. A Cardinal is to be credited on his word, affirming that he
received a Mandate from the Pope by word of mouth, namely, that he should make
such an one a Gentleman, who was of base blood before: but if the matter
whereof the Cardinal gives testimony, concern greatly the prejudice of an
other, then is his sole word of no sufficient power, to bind any to believe
him. Now the proposer of the twelve questions (were he father Garnet, or M.
Blackwell) assumed only one part of the sentence, as every one may see, where
the difficulty lay not, and which made for them, and omitted the other part,
that belonged to the state of the difference, and which made most strongly
against them. But can these odd shifts and paring of sentences proclaim other
then a bad cause, and lack of sincerity in the mainteiners? No, no, the wise
do note it.

Secondly, whereas our Superior affirms in his letter, that he was appointed
Archpriest of the English Catholics, for the happy rule and regiment and
mutua^ love of Catholics etc. we pray him to show us when, and by whom he was
appointed Archpriest of the lay Catholics. The Constitutiue Letter makes him
Archpriest but only over all the secular English Priests residing in England or
Scotland. And though his Holiness first Breue (for his second was not extant
long after M. Blackwell wrote these) signified that the Cardinal had by his
commandment for the happy rule and government, and mutual love, peace, and
union, of the Catholics of the kingdoms of England and Scotland, and for
conseruing and augmenting ecclesiastical discipline, deputed M. Blackwell
Archpriest by his Letters patents over the English Catholics: Yet no such
thing appearing in the said Letters, M. Blackwell can no more rightfully style
himself the Archpriest of English Catholics, (because per confirmationem
Papae, nihil noui iuris datur. No new Glos. in ca. Quis nesciat. did. 11.
verb. Autoritate and Glos. in ca. quia diuer sitatem de concess. Praebend.
verb. forma co^muni.
right is given by the Popes confirmation) then John Astile can write himself
the Lieutenant of the Shire, because the Queen commanded the Lord Keeper to
appoint him so, who nevertheless in the commission he sent him, made him but
Justice of peace. And whether John Astile be Lieutenant in this case or no,
there is none of judgment, especially of knowledge in the laws, but will say
he is not, because he is no more, nor can be taken for other, then the writ of
Commission ordains him.

Thirdly, to that M. Blackwell says, that the wayward man is to know, that the
Canonists agree that he which has jurisdiction in the exterior court, can
inflict censures: we answer, that it is true in any who has jurisdiction in
the exterior court by virtue of any ordinary office or delegatine, unless
there be a form prescribed together with the grant of the delegatine
authority, how he shall punish and proceed with the contumacious or
delinquents. For if there be such a specification or limitation added to the
authority, then that form is most strictly to be observed, and any thing done
beyond it, is of no obligation: Vbi datur certa forma procedendi, processus
corruit non sol^m Panorm. in ca. Prudentiam de offic. deleg. nu. 5.
si aliquid attentatur direct contra formam, sed etiam citra vel praeter
formam. Where there is a certain form given of proceeding, the process
falls, and is of no effect, not only if an attentatiue be made directly
contrary to the form, but also if any thing be enterprised beside or out of
the compass of the form; Again, Subdelegatus delegati Idem in Can.
venerabili de off. deleg. nu. 1.
Papae si excesserit formam rescripti, processus est nullus. The Subdelegate of
the Popes delegate, if he shall exceed the form of his commission, the thing
that he does therein, is of no force. And that M. Blackwell was the Cardinals
Subdelegate, none can deny who shall read the Constitutiue Letter.

Now the ordinary authority that M. Blackwell has, being the only authority
of an Archpriest, which gives him no jurisdiction at all in the exterior
court, because as the Canonists yield the reason, the Ioannes Andreas in ca. 1
de Archip. nu. 3. Lancelottus in Insti. nu. Ca li. 1 tit. 14. Hostiensis in
sumn^a, de offi. Ar hipraesb. nu. 2.
Archpriest supplieth the stead of the Bishop in celebration of certain
spiritual things, as the Archdeacon does in matters belonging to jurisdiction:
and therefore the Archpriest has no power in the exterior court, as the
authorities ensuing do prove. Z^cchius de Eccl rep. ca. 24. nu. 14.
Archipresbyter iurisdictionem habet voluntariam, non tamen contentiosam. An
Archpresbyter has a voluntary but no litigious jurisdiction, that is,
Schardius in suo Lexicon. verbo Iurisdictio.
he can exercise no authority by compulsion, but only where the parties are
willing. Ioannes Andreas in ca. ministrum de Archipraesb. nu. 3.
Archpraesbyter punire aliquem non potest authoritate sua, sed de praecepto sui
Episcopi. An Archpriest cannot punish any body by his own authority, but upon
commandment of his Bishop.

Of the otherside, touching his delegatine authority, the particulars and the
form thereof are set down, and therefore not to be extended to any thing that
is beyond the limits of the said form: or if in case it be further extended,
nevertheless the like extension is of no validity nor binds any to obey, as
the first, third, fourth and fifth Propositions Page 23. 24. and 25.
laid down in the second Reason do most evidently teach and convince. So that
the uttermost of the authority concerning the inflicting of penalties upon the
disobedient, being (as has bin before proved by the express words of the
Constitutiue Letter) only to abridge, suspend the use, or wholly deprive us of
our faculties, and neither to suspend us from the Altar, interdict or
excommunicate: it follows directly that he can do none of these. Or if the
words in the Constitutiue Letter [ vel suspensione, or suspending] must be
taken for the general censure of suspending from what our Archpriest lists,
and not for suspending from the practice of our faculties only, as the
circumstance of the place, but especially the Cardinals rehearsing of the
faculties, which he granted to the Archpriest, does most apparently gainesay,
and utterly contradict any such ample signification of the word suspending: yet
is it most certain that he can not interdict, for this authority is no where
specified either in the Constitutiue letter, additions, instructions, or his
Holiness Breue. Again, it appears by an other reason, that notwithstanding
the general signification which the word suspending may bear, yet for that
the matter is penal which is imported, the said word ought to be taken in a
strict sense, because as Siluester writes Verb. Excommunicatio 1. nu. 6.
Cum verba sint ambigua and generalia, and factu^ odiosum and alteri parti
praeiudicatiuum, debet fieri interpretatio stricta. When the words are
doubtful and general (as in our case) and the fact displeasant, and
prejudicial to an other, there ought to be made a strict interpretation, and
the words not to be trained to the largest sense.

Fourthly, touching the authorities, his reverence cites out of Zabarella and
Zecchius, that an inferior Prelate to a Bishop, may ordain penal statutes
against his subjects, and assign the penalties as he will himself: and that a
single prelate having jurisdiction, may interdict: and that also lower prelates
then Bishops, may prescribe laws in a manner episcopal to their subjects. We
answer. Let it be so, that a lower prelate then a Bishop can do these things,
yet how does it appear that himself is such a Prelate? I wis when this is
proved, he being but an Archpriest, we shall see greater wonders, then ever any
Canonist read or heard of. For if he can do these things by the authority and
title of an Archpriest (as it is most sure by the places alleged before, and
by the uniform consent of all writers that he can not:) then these and other
like particulars, which his Reverence has adventured upon, being more, and
beyond the form of the Constitutiue Letter; it follows most certainly,
both, that he could not do them, or if he should do them, yet that they are of
no obligation. First that he could not do them, is very clear, because he
could do no more in matters not belonging to the office of an Archpresbiter
(which are all things requiring jurisdiction in the exterior court, as it has
bin proved before) then was expressed in the commission or instrument of his
authority: And secondly that if he should do them, they are of no obligation,
is also clear, because whatsoever is done without authority D. Tho. 1. 2. q.
96. ar. 4. c. and 2. 2. q. 60. ar. 2. and 6.
ne does by law, nor can bind in conscience: and therefore I can but marvel
what moved his judgment to write that my book may teach me what he may do ex
lege communi by right of the general law, if other sufficient warrants wanted;
when having but a delegatine authority in all matters appertaining to the
exterior court, and this also in a set form prescribed unto him, (which he
could not exceed without the usurping of authority, a Idem, ibidem, and Nauar
in man. ca. 27. nu. 8.
mortal sin of his own nature) would notwithstanding claim, or seem to
claim an increase of his punishing jurisdiction ex iure communi, from the
general law, since the amplenesse thereof was particularised in the same
Instrument, in which the office and prelature were granted unto him.

Lastly concerning his ground in declaring me to be interdicted without
citation before, I little doubt, but that under his leave, he is greatly
mistaken in the matter. For Siluester in that place only says: In facto
notorio potest ferri sententia contra absentem non citatum, quando certum est
absenti nullam competere desensionem. Sentence may be given in a notorious fact
against a party absent, and not summoned, when it is certain that he can
allege no pretense for justification or excuse of the fact. Our Archpriest in
the letter or instrument, in which he suspended and interdicted me, and
redoubled the taking away of all my faculties, lays down three causes of
such his process against me. First, for that I confessed to have given consent
to the prefixing of the reasons set before the Appeal: whereby, the same being
the breaking of his decrees, I incurred, as he says, the censure of
suspension, interdict, and the loss of all my faculties. Secondly, for that I
wrote other Letters not unlike to those which the Appellants of Wisbich had
addressed. Thirdly, for that I sent him the Appeal, wherein three of the
Appellants, whose names were subscribed thereunto, had seriously or by other
protested their vnwittingnes to the said Letters prefixed before the Apeale.
These were the causes, which our Archpriest yielded for inflicting the
abouenamed censures and penalties upon me, as the words of the Instrument it
self do show, which follow.

Quoniam autem D. Ioannes Colletonus non solum ob priores illas literas 21.
Febr. 1601 stylo Romano.
praetensae Appellationi praefixas (quae verius titulum libelli famosi
sustinerent) quibus ipse fatetur se consensisse: sed ob recentes etiam 29.
Ianuarij emissas, harum posteriorum Wisbicensium non dissimiles, in poenas
easdem incidit: eum quoque declaramus similibus censuris ac poenis innodatum,
sicuti per praesentes eum innodamus. Quod profecto vel eam solam ob causam
facere necessario deberemus, quod D. Doctori Georgius Trenshamus (que^ illius
libelli fabricatores Potterum nominant) Iacobus Copus, Richardus Buttonus,
partim sub proprio chirorapho ac iuramento, partim (sicut audiuimus) sub
grauibus protestationib. negant se illis Literis consensisse. Cuius fraudis
culpam, nos sane nescimus in quem potius conijciamus, quam in D. Colletonum, a
quo illae Literae ad nos transmissae sunt: that is, And because Master John
Colleton not only for those former Letters prefixed before the pretended
Appeal, (which may truer bear the title* of an infamous Libell) whereunto
himself does acknowledge to have given his consent: but also in respect of his
Letters lately sent the 29. of January, not unlike to these later which came
from Wisbich, has fallen into the same penalties: him likewise we declare to
have incurred the like censures and penalties, namely suspension, interdict,
and the loss of all faculties, as we by these presents do impose upon him.
Which truly we ought necessarily to have done, though it had bin but for this
only cause, that Master George Strensham (whom the framers of that Libell call
by the name of Potter) James Cope, Richard Button, partly by their own
handwriting and oath, and partly (as we have heard) by serious protestations,
do deny ever to have given their consent to those Letters. The blame of which
fraud we truly know, not to whom we should rather impute it, then to M.
Colleton, who sent us the Letters.

Now, that neither of these three imputed offenses were so notorious as our
Archpriest by law or conscience could declare me to be suspended and
interdicted, or could suspend, interdict, or reduplicate the taking away of my
faculties without citation before, or hearing what I could say in the matter, I
lay this ground: That a fact be so notorious as the ecclesiastical judge may
declare the doer to have fallen into censures, or to impose censures upon him
for the same without summons, it is not only of necessity (as it has been
above proved out of Alphonsus Vilagut, Panormitane, and Felinus) that the fact
it self be notorious, but that also the nature and the circumstances of the
said fact be likewise notorious, that is, so manifestly and palpably faulty, as
no color or tergiuersation can be pretended. For then only (as the 2. q. 1
Prohibentur part. 2. and sequenti. and ca. Tua. de cohab. Cler. and ca. Vestra
eod. ti^.
Canons teach) may the judiciary order of citing be omitted, when the fact
which is to be punished is apparent, known to many, and can neither be denied,
nor justified by any shift or pretext soever. Qualities, which can not fall in,
or sort with any of the foresaid three offenses objected. And to show that they
can no way agree with the imputed offense of subscribing my name to the
Appeal, or with yielding my consent to the reasons prefixed before the same,
we will first set down the two branches of the decree, for breaking of which,
our In his Letter to the Assistents of the 28. of Nouemb. 1600.
Archpriest affirms that we incurred the censures of suspension and
interdict, and the loss of our faculties, and then after prove that our
default therein was not so notorious, that he could without citation declare us
to have incurred the said censures and penalties.

Prohibemus in virtute sanctae obedientiae omnibus praesbyteris and sub
Decretum 18. October. 1600.
poena suspensionis atque interdicti, addo etiam amissionis omnium facultatum
ipso facto incurrendarum ne quisquam praeteritam inobedienttam quouis 4.
modo, verbo vel scripto, direct vel indirecte defendere praesumat.

Prohibemus sub poena suspensionis a diuinis and amissionis omnium facultatum ^.
ne quis sacerdos vllo modo suffragia vel scripto, vel verbo, danda ambiat, vel
det ad quamcunque causam, quam antea nobiscum vel cum duobus Assistentibus
nostris non constat fuisse communicatam: that is:

We prohibit all Priests in virtue of holy obedience, and under pain of
suspension and interdict, I add also of leesing all their faculties, to be
incurred in the fact it self, that none presume any manner of way, by word or
writing, directly or indirectly, to defend the former disobedience.

We prohibit under pain of suspension from divine offices and loss of all
faculties, that no Priest in any sort, either by writing or word of mouth,
seek or give voices in any cause soever, not known to have bin communicated
before to us, or to two of our Assistants.

Now, though by the setting down of our reasons why we did appeal, and the
giving of our names to the appeal, were a notorious or public fact, which had
many witnesses and could not be denied: nevertheless the nature and qualities
of the fact were not so certainly and openly known to be criminous or ill, as
that no circumstances or causes might occur to make the same both lawful and
commendable. To defend our good names, being priests, and tootoo wrongfully
assailed, and to secke redress by appellation to S. Peter's chair, of most
unworthy oppressions heaped on us and the Catholic Laity, even to the scandal
and injury of religion, are circumstances, and such approving qualities of our
fact, as do make our breach of the decree not only no apparent offense, but
most evidently free it from all blame, or rather highly commend it. And to the
end that the unskillful in the Latin tongue may see how unjustly our
Archpriest has proceeded against us, as well in calling our reasons a In his
letter to Master Mush the first of March 1600.
libelling, and In his letter to M. Iackson the 18. of March 1600.
seditious letter, as in suspending, interdicting and taking away our faculties
for putting our names to the Appeal, we will here set down the whole Appeal
it self in English truly translated, omitting the Latin, because that is
already printed in our book to his Holiness.

To the very Reverend, Master George Blackwell Archpriest of the Seminary
Priests in England.
VEry many, and most unworthy are those things, which for these two years
last past, we have endured at the hands of the fathers of the society of
Jesus, and of your Reverence, both approving and multiplying their injuries
done against us.

Among the reasons, why hitherto we have borne with silence so unjust burdens,
our a^fiance was not the least, that the equity of our cause by little and
little deeper seen into, some ease or tolleration of our said burdens, would
in short time grow unto us. But having now by more then long try all found,
both our selves to be deceived in our hopes, and also the weight of our
afflictions so excessiuely increased by reason of such our qualited patience;
that not only we our selves, but a great number of lay Catholics, most
deservedly dear unto us, are thereby also maruellously oppressed, so that we
are enforced by appealing to flee to the sea Apostolic in most humble manner
for succor. The reasons of which Appeal, are these that ensue.

First, for that your Reverence has often approved the too great The first
cause.
injuries and reproach, which the Fathers of the Society in word and deed,
most wrongfully laid upon us: as namely when father Lister Jesuit composed,
and had set forth a treatise of Schism against us (who upon just causes,
deferred for a while, to subject our selves to your authority, till either by
view of Apostolical letters, or other canonical proof, the same were showed
to be instituted by his Holiness command, and enjoined unto us) in which beside
other unseemly speeches, he has these slanders in the fifth paragraph.

These factious persons are stricken down with the dolor of their own ruin,
in that they have resisted the ^opes decrees: they have lost their place among
Priests: they are debarred the practice of their holy function: their
judgment is to be contemned; and already they are condemned by the holy
Apostolic Church.

And in the conclusion or seventh paragraph, these.

1 Ye are rebels.

2 Ye are schismatiques, and are fallen from the Church and spouse of Christ.

3 Ye have trodden under foot the obedience you ow to the Pope.

4 Ye have offended against all human faith and authority, by rejecting a
moral certainty, in a moral matter.

5 Ye have run headlong into excommunication and irregularitie.

6 Ye have lost the faculties by which you should have gained souls to Christ.

7 Ye have raised up so great scandal in the minds of all the godly, that as
infamous persons, you are t^nesed in every man's mouth.

8 Ye are no better then soothsayers and Idolaters, and in regard ye have not
obeyed the Church, speaking unto you by the highest Bishop, you are as ethnicks
and publicanes.

When after the publishing of these detestable untruths, we made petition to
your Reverence, to know whether you did approve these defamations against us,
you answered under your own handwriting as follows, To Master I. C.
26. of March 1599.
I allow of the said discourse and censure.

George Blackwell Archpriest.




Furthermore, when at an other time we made humble request to your Reverence,
for the reuoking of the said slanderous treatise: you wrote back this
answer. To Master I. M. I. C. and A. H.
April. 1599.
Your request is, that we should call in the treatise against your schism, and
this is unreasonable, because the medicine ought not to be removed, before the
sore be thoroughly cured; if it grieve you, I am not grieved thereat.

George Blackwell Archpriest.




Also in your letters of the foureteenth of March, in the year following, we
having then written again to your Reverence about the several infamies
wherewith three of the Fathers of the Society had charged us, and specifying
some of them in particular, you gave this answer. To Master I. C. Th. M. To.
D. A. H.
You note in these terms condemning untruths, not seeing how truly and
i^stlie your condemned deserts did draw such names upon you before your
submission, and these names might have taught you, how each man's iniquity
evermore hurts himself, never profits.

George Blackwell Archpriest, and Protonotarie Apostolical.




In brief, when father Henry Garnet provincial of the Jesuits in England,
writing to one of our ancient Priests, auowed among other indignities, this
ouerbold assertion.

To Master I. C. Ye have in the judgment of all learned, incurred the most
shameful note of schism.

And turning his speech to the Priest himself, thus. You have so entangled
them whom you have brought to Christ, or whose pastor and father you have been,
as if they shall receive Sacraments of you, if they shall induce you to say
Mass, or shall assist you in celebrating, they seem to partake with you in
the crime of exercising your function unworthily, and in liew of a medicine,
carry away poison

7. March. 1599.



And when the Priest to whom the foresaid Letters were written, had reioyned,
complaining of the injury, your Reverence in behalf of father Garnet, thus by
letter answered him again.

You ought for their writings and admonitions to have thanked them in most
dutiful and humble manner. And after a few lines: I will defer to chasten you
for a while, in hope of your recovery, and therefore this shall be to you, but
as a messenger of punishment for your disobedience, and as an advertisement for
you to view advisedly, how ignorance, error, pride, and obstinacy, have
drawn you within the compass of schism. The second cause.
The second cause is, because notwithstanding we ever by word and writing,
protested our ready obedience, to all and every commandment of his Holiness,
and that neither Breue nor other binding testimony, should sooner at any time
be showed unto us, but it should find us submissiuely obedient in whatsoever:
neither was this more or otherwise, then what our deeds themselves made good.
For as very many can witness, no moment passed between the showing of his
Holiness Breue, and our acceptance or absolute submission to your authority:
yea further, we were then also content merely for peace sake to remit all the
reproach, infamy, calumniation, all and singular injuries that were most
riotously spent, in the interim, as well against our selves, as our best
friends: we say, that notwithstanding all this our pressed readiness and
submission, your reverence diuulged the resolution following; which tootoo
unlucky fact, was the total cause of these our new debates.

We have received a resolution from our mother City, that the refusers of the
appointed authority, were schismatiques. And surely I would not give
absolution to any that should make n^ conscience thereof. And a few words
between. And therefore my direction is, that they make account thereof, and do
make satisfaction before they receive the benefit of Absolution.

And according to the purport of this dispersed resolution (which albeit by
your own affirmance, you received it either from father Warford, or father
Tichburne, two English Jesuits resident at Rome: yet your reverence did so
propose and grace the same, as many then did, and as yet some do believe, that
the said resolution came as a definitive sentence, from the sea Apostolic)
your self would not restore M. Benson to the use of his faculties, neither
upon his own humble suit, nor mediation of his fellow prisoners, who also had,
and then did, suffer very hard imprisonment with great constancy, unless he
would first agnize and testify under his hand, that he was grieved for his
adherence to the schismatic conuenticle, your reverence being pleased, to
dubbe our company with so hateful a name.

Also in your Letters to an other Priest, bearing date the 22. of February
1600. thus you write.

To Master I. M. I determined that hereafter, whosoever had faculties of me, he
should first be content to recall his peevish opinion (tearming the opinion
peevish, that does not hold us for schismatiques.)

Furthermore your reverence affirmed (which shook and galled the new peace not
a little) that assertion of father Jones, a Priest of the To Master I. C.
Society, to be true, auowing all those to incur presently, the censures of
holy Church, who should stiffely defend, that we were no To Master R. D. Tho
M. A H. etc.
schismatiques: which position you again ratisied in your Letters given the
14. of March 1600.

The third cause. The third cause is, because that after the contentions thus
revived by your reverence and the Fathers of the Society, we, who evermore
most desired peace, did never but find you partial on our adversaries side,
and toward us and the cause in controversy, a hard superior, and so
exceeding proane to have us generally condem^ed, that you spared not to forbid
us to defend our own good names, under threat of grievous punishment, as is
manifest by your Letters of the 12. and 17. of February, and the 14. of March,
where these words are read.

If ever I can find hereafter, that either by word or writing you justify
your enormous disobedience (viz. in delaying to yield your selves absolutely to
our authority, before the coming of his Holiness Breue) as void of sin,
this being a sign of want of grace, and the maintenance of sin, which is a
high pride: I will suspend you from your function, as unworthy to exercise the
same.

Likewise when we, to take away the scandal, which by reason of this our
imputative schism, was rife every where, and to make peace again in our
Church now a long while most miserably rent through this mutual discord,
besought most earnestly your Reverence, and the Fathers of the Society, that
it would either please you to leave off to renew the calumny of schism
against us, or afford your assistance and furtherance, that the question might
quietly be conferred of or disputed, by some of either side, before three or
four of the seniour Assistants, and one ancient Priest of our part, as
vmpieres and determiners of the whole controversy: your To Master I. C. F. C.
I. M. etc.
Reverence utterly rejected the petition: in what sort, the words of your own
letters do best testify, 14. and 16. of March.

Your petition is a tumultuous complaint.

Your prescriptions (so tearming our supplication) are as empty of due
consideration, as they be blown out with the spirit of a tumultuous
presumption.

Your supplication cauilleth against my proceedings, and the speeches of my
best friends. I shall much muse, if ye shall not be abashed of this your
attempt.

Moreover, when several detractiue letters written by Father As that to Master
A. G. the 13. of July 1598. and to his friend the 20. of Febr. 1599. and to M.
Bish. the 9. of October. 1599. and others.
Parsons and others, and made common in our country, did daily more and more
wound in credit both our selves and our dearest friends: and when for this
cause our ghostly children (who together with us, were both reputed and shunned
by you, as schismatiques, or at the least as very grievous sinners, and for
none other fault, save only for that they took our part, and relieved our
miseries) very instantly dealt with us, that now without any further delay, we
would address our selves, to free both their and our own innocence from the
crimes and calumniations imputed: Wherefore as men thereunto obliged in
conscience, we determined as well for the removing of infamy from our
priesthood, as to bring quietness of conscience to such as are under our
charge, to diuulge a temperate apology: which intention and design of ours
being understood, your Reverence anon prohibited under heavy censure and forfet
of faculties, the diuulging of such a defense, and to this purpose used a
smooth pretense of godliness and peace, viz. least the lawful state might be
troubled, or any man's good name receive blemish, as is apparent by the
specialties that follow.

I George Blackwell Archpriest in England, in virtue of holy obedience, and
under pain of suspension from your office, and loss of all faculties in the
deed it self to be incurred, do prohibit all Priests, to diuulge any book
set out within these two years, or hereafter to be set out, by which the
lawful state may be disturbed, or the fame of any clergy Catholic person, of
our English nation may be hurt by name: and the same commandment is given to
the laity under pain of being interdicted,

17. January 1599. George Blackwell Archpriest.


The severity of which edict appears so much the greater, in that your
Reverence afterward declared, that you took the word [ booke] in the
signification which it carries in Bulla coenae domini, where heretical books
are forbidden, so as now we fall into the aboue-mentioned penalties, if we but
diuulge the least writing or defense, whereby any english catholic Clergie-man
(such as all our hard friends be) shall or may receive blot or hurt in his good
name; neither skilleth it whether justly, or unjustly, upon desert or
without, the edict containing no such limitation or prouiso at all. And being
after this manner suspended and deprived of faculties, we are therewith bereft
of all the means, of getting sustenance, harbor, or other temporal succor,
these every way depending on the practice of our priestly function and use of
faculties.

Finally, seeing that there was neither mean nor measure kept in opprobrious
speeches against us, nor that we might any way obtain a friendly discussing
and ending of the matter between our selves, no, nor as much as to be licenced
to defend our cause or good name, either by word or writing: we especially for
the greater safety of our conscience, held it our bounden duty to propose the
whole difficulty and state of the controversy, to the Divines of the
University of Paris, to the end, that they taking pity of the calamity of
our Church, and the sooner, through the mediation of our humble suit, would
vouchsafe to deliver their censure and opinion, in the difference. Which good
and charitable office, they no sooner performed, but your reverence enacted a
decree, that no one upon pain of heauiest forfeitures, should any way
maintain the censures of so great and famous Clarks. The state of the
question, the resolution of the University, and the edict of your reverence,
follow word by word.

In the year of our Lord 1600. upon the third day of May etc. as it is verbatim
set down in the page 146.

The fourth cause.
The fourth cause is, because your Reverence does very earnestly defend
whatsoever the fathers of the Society either speak or do against us, in so
much that when we refused to obey them in that counterfeit imputation of
schism, and required a retractation of that foresaid infamous Libell, your
Reverence stood so mightily against us, that for this cause the 17. of October
1600. it pleased you to revoke and wholly to take away all faculties from two of
our most ancient and reverend Priests. By which fact, very many of good place
and account, were touched with so great grief, scandal, and offense, that
every where they bewailed and complained of this calamity, and so much the
more, for that these were the special men, that had longest and best deserved
of our Church, and being greatly loved of Cardinal Allen of pious memory, were
by him honored with special and extraordinary faculties above the rest.

Furthermore, although your Reverence could not but see, that all these
perturbations of peace and concord which are now in our Church, took their
beginning at first, and continued afterward upon no other cause or motive, but
the defense of father Garnet and father Listers paradoxe of the imaginatiue
schism, and the patronage of that more improbable assertion of father Jones
abouesaid; and albeit likewise, that your Reverence very well knows, that all
these mischiefs or home-dissentions might at the beginning, and may yet
without any difficulty, be quenched by the retractation of these opinions: yet
for all this, your reverence had rather that all places should be disquieted
with the trouble of these variances, and that masters and servants, parents and
children, husbands and wives, pastors and sheep, Priests and lay people,
should grow to a hurly burly and mutual contention, yea and that Priests
themselves should fall at iarres by means of this controversy, then that those
three fathers of the Society should revoke their errors, or by acknowledging
their temeritie, make satisfaction to those whom they had offended by such, and
so great an injury.

The fifth cause.
The fifth cause is, that seeing the holy Canons do ordain, and the laws of
nature it self and of all Nations do require, that no man being accused, ought
to be condemned of the crime, or endomaged in his goods or fame, or suffer any
punishment in his person, till he be first in some sort cited, and permitted to
answer unto the crimes objected: yet your Reverence does testify by your own
writing, that you in no sort are bound to any of all these rules, either in
judging or punishing, and this also, by the will of his Holiness himself. By
which new kind of judgment and authority never heard of since the world begun,
your Reverence has lately taken away all the faculties from From Master I. M.
and I. C.
our two Priests as is said before, and there is none of us, but may justly
fear, least that ours likewise be taken from us, how much soever this course
of proceeding seem to violate the express tenor of the Letters patents of the
most illustrious Cardinal Caietane, Protector of good memory, by the which,
your authority was delegated unto you, as does manifestly appear to him that
reads the same, your R. own writing we will here set down word for word.

It is not his Holiness intention, nor never was, that in exercising of my
authority for correction of manners, and conseruing of our ecclesiastical
discipline and peace in this time and in these difficulties, that we should be
bound in any wise to the form of contentious or Court trials, especially in
the reuocation of faculties, the grant whereof, as also the continuance is to
be deemed merely voluntary, whereas delegated faculties do cease, without any
crime committed, at the only pleasure of the graunter, or of one that has
authority from him.

To Master R. Chapter

The last cause is, for that your Reverence has by ordayning The sixth cause.
decreed (we will use your own very words) and promulgated a degree, wherein
you have pronounced and declared all us, who before the coming of the
Apostolic Breue, made stay of submitting our selves, for many causes, unto
your authority, to be in very deed disobedient to the Sea Apostolic, and
rebellious to your office instituted by the same See; and have moreover, under
pain of suspension, interdiction, and loss of all faculties to be incurred
ipso facto, prohibited us, that by no means we should presume either by word
or writing, directly, or indirectly, to defend that our delay; wherein your
Reverence and the Provincial father of the Society of Jesus, with others your
accomplices, do affirm and boldly maintain the nature of deadly sin, and very
schism it self to be included: and many mo through your authority and
persuasion, have commonly holden us, and do still repute us as men guilty of
the said enormities. Whereupon we cannot but wonderfully admire the too too
great severity of this decree, both depriving us of the reputation of our good
names, and bringing burden intolerable for many respects upon us. For seeing
we are commanded, both by Gods law and man's, yea by the very instinct of
nature it self, and lastly by the reason of our office, to defend our fame,
and so near as we can to preserve it from touch or blemish; your Reverence
has expressly forbidden us this duty, under most grievous ecclesiastical
penalties and censures. And whereas beside, we took our orders of Priesthood
(by which institution of life we fell into the heavy displeasure of our Prince,
and are made incapable of all temporal commodities, and are every minute in
continual danger to loose our lives) only for the recovery of souls, and for
propagating the Catholic faith: your Reverence has bereaved us of that
special thing, which before others, was most necessary to the attayning of the
same, viz. the use of our faculties, for this only cause, that we labored to
free our good names from infaming calumniations, as we are bound to do. Whereof
it must needs follow, that we shall in short space be brought to unseemly
beggary and want of all necessaries, and soon after, to most certain
destruction of life. We purposely omit here to make any mention of that
prohibition of yours, to wit, that no man go about to seek or give any
voices, or make any meetings or assemblies. Which restraint is thought to be
ordained by your Reverence to this end, that all courses may be debarred us by
these means, both of repelling unjust oppressions by mutual connection of
voices and wills, and likewise of appealing to Peter's Chair.

With the like severity, your Reverence in the same decree, does also thunder
the penalty of interdiction to be incurred ipso facto, against all the laiety
that submit not themselves to your sentence or judgment in this controversy.
The sharpnes of which hard dealing, may justly seem to them for this cause the
more violent, in respect that the penalties which they are charged by the laws
of our country, become so much the heavier and more burdensome unto them. For
those that are of ability, pay twenty pound a month to the Queens Eschequer,
and those that pay not the former sum, forfet all their goods, and two third
parts of their lands: and if it can be proved that they have heard Mass, they
pay one hundred marks. Likewise if they receive any priest into their house, or
otherwise relieve his wants, they loose all their goods, lands, and life. Which
being so, they think your Reverence deals too severely and unjustly with
them, by inflicting this censure of Interdict, whereby they neither can receive
Sacraments, nor be present at divine Service, nor yet be buried after christian
manner, if either they defend the sentence of the most famous University of
Paris (as appears by the Decree of your Reverence before alleged) or take
upon them in any sort to defend the good names of their ghostly fathers, or any
way clear those from the imputation of schism, by whose good means they were
either first brought to the obedience of the Sea Apostolic, or continued in
the same, and do well know by their long conuersing with them, the sincere
integrity of their lives. The Decree is, as follows.

We by our authority received from his Holiness, do pronounce and declare,
that those first letters of our Institution, did truly bind all the Catholics
in England, and that those who have any ways wittingly impugned our authority,
were truly disobedient to the Sea Apostolic, and rebellious against our office
instituted by the same See. And a little after.

We forbid all Priests in virtue of holy obedience, and under pain of
suspension and interdict (the absolution whereof we reserve to our selves) I
add also, the loss of all their faculties to be incurred ipso facto: the
Laiety likewise, under pain of interdict to be incurred ipso facto, that none
of them presume in any wise by word or writing, directly or indirectly, to
def^nd that former disobedience, the cause of so great perturbation of peace
amongst us.

Instructed by long experience, what great inconveniences have grown to the
upholding of discord by those privy meetings, which in former years we have
prohibited, so far as they have bin the nourishments of schisms: do
therefore once again strictly forbid all such assemblies, commanding all our
assistents, and other reverend Priests, that they advertise us of all such
meetings and assemblies, which tend not to the furtherance of piety and
hospitality, or of ciuility and peace. And we prohibit under pain of
suspension from divine functions, and loss of all faculties, that no Priest,
in any wise by word or writing, go about either to seek or give any voices
for what cause soever, before the same be known to be communicated with us, or
with two of our assistents.


These things are in the aforesaid Decree.

For which intolerable wrongs and oppressions, and many other indignities
which we have endured these two years space and more, and for that likewise we
do not know, whether your Reverence has any authority at all to make Decrees,
seeing no such faculty appears in the Constitutiue Letter.

In the name of God Amen. In the year of our Lord 1600. 13. Indiction, the 17.
day of the month of November, and in the 9. year of the Papacy of our most
holy Father Clement by the providence of God the eight of that name. We English
Priests, whose names are underwritten, finding our selves agrieued in the
premises, and fearing more grievous oppressions in time to come, do make our
appeal and provocation to the Sea Apostolic, and ask of you Master George
Blackwell, the first, second, and third time, instantly, more instantly, and
most instantly our Apostles or dimissory letters, submitting our selves, and
all we have, persons, faculties, goods, and rights, to the tuition, protection,
and defense of our most holy Father Clement the eight, and to the Sea
Apostolic. And we make this our appeal in our own names, and in the names
both of the Clergy and Laiety, of which later, there are many hundreds, whose
names for just causes are concealed, that adhere unto us by means of the
controversy of schism, or in any of the aforesaid matters, or dependence, or
prosecution thereof, or after any other sort: desiring, if there be any thing
to be added, taken away or changed for the more validity of these presents,
that the same may be added, taken away, or changed, as the form of law shall
require.

Since the making of this Appeal, there are others who have subscribed
thereunto, and given their names, as Master Doctor Norris, Master Roger
Cadwalader, and Master Jasper Lobery, beside some other, who for fear of the
extremity used against the Appellants, durst not (their friends being few, and
their state mean) manifest themselves to our Archpriest, but sent their
Appeals by our brethren that are gone to Rome. The Letter following was sent,
together with the Appeal.

VEry Reverend Sir, we send you our Appeal herein enclosed, and have prefixed
the reasons: to the end, your self denying to mitigate the rigor on foot
against us, our country may see, till further satisfaction come forth,
whereupon the discreet may suspend their condemnation of us. Another cause
that alike moves us thereunto, was, the affiance we hold, that your Reverence
understanding our grounds in this full manner, would neither reject the appeal,
nor blame us for the making, and less punish us for a necessity so many ways
behoouable. Again, our poverty, want of means, skill, and friends, to
prosecute the matter, did not a little persuade the particularizing of some of
our pressures; in regard the persons, whose helps we are to solicit in the
managing of the business, may the more willingly, viewing the measure of our
oppressions, yield us their most furtherance. How long, and with what
coffeehouse of my fellows, I have prolonged the sending of the appeal, in
hope of a more quiet issue in the difference; none almost that are of our side
but can witness. And now being brought in despair of expecting any such good
end, by the tenor of your yesterdayes Letter, I can but grieve, and commend
the success to God. Concerning that part of your last Edict, which forbids
under heauiest penalties, either to give, or collect suffrages upon any cause
soever, before the same be communicated to your self, or to two of your
reverend assistants, how hard soever the Iniunction appears, yet for
obedience, we acquaint you by these, with our determination of procuring other
our brethren to subscribe to the appeal; and as their names shall come to our
hands, so to send them unto your Reverence. Thus beseeching the goodness of
almighty God, ever to guide you, to the doing of his holy will, I take my
leave. November. 25. 1600.

Dutifully yours, I. Colleton.

Now our precedent appeal being a grauamine from aggreuances, we were
consequently bound to Pan. in ca. vt debitus de appel. nu. 38. and in Clement
ca. appellanti d^ appel. nu. 1. Decius in ca. vt debitus de appel. ^u 83. and
alij.
express particularly the causes of our appellation, Clement. ca. appellanti
de appel.
nor could we by law allege any other causes though never so notorious in the
prosecution of the appeal, then such only as we had before set down in the
same. Which plainly shows the necessity we had to particulate and prefixe
them in the manner we did. And to the end they might appear not to be feigned,
we quoted the letters, annexed the date, and cited the words which deliver the
aggreuances. Again, it seems most strange how this orderly course (the
Canons Ca. super ^o secundo de appel.
licensing every one to appeal upon reasonable cause, and none of the causes
rehearsed, carrying with them but sufficient matter of appellation) can be
called either a seditious pamphlet, or a libelling letter (as our Archpriest
uses them both) when the substance of all that we a^^rred was wholly taken out
either of his own letters, or out of their writings In his letter to M. Mush
the 21. of Febr. 1600. Math. 26.
whose counsel (by his In his letter to Master T. B. and in his letter to M.
Mush the 1. of March 1600.
own affirmance) is the stay, and their friendship the continuance of our
whole catholic state, and whom to follow is his comfort, except we must be
entreated as our Savior was by the high Priest, who for repeating the high
Priests words, was said to blaspheme; And so we alleging what our Archpriest
and some of the Fathers wrote and maintained against us, the allegations must
be termed libelling and seditious, whereas we rehearsed but their own words,
and such as themselves diuulged, justified, and seemed to take pleasure in. Yea
further, our repeating of their words, and this also by way of appeal to his
H^lines, must be so notorious and heinous a crime in us, that for the same we
must be even after appellation suspended, interdicted, bereaved of our
faculties, and publicly declared without citation before to be such, and the
subscribing likewise to the foresaid repetition defined a breach of wholesome
decrees. Undoubtedly, if this manner of proceeding be not to infringe or
dispense in the laws of holy Church, or not rather to turn vpside down the
hierarchy of all ecclesiastical discipline, there was never hitherto disorder
in the christian world. 11. q. 3. nemo. 2.
Nemo Episcoporum quemlibet sine certa and manifesta peccata causa communione
priuet ecclesiastica: Let no Bishop says the Cannon, deprive any other from
ecclesiastical communion, without certain and manifest cause of sin. And
which cause also by the 1. q. 6. ca. Nono.
constitution of Pope Nicholas, ought to be proved before the censure be
inflicted: or else the Prelate so indiscreetly offending is to be punished with
the same penalty, and to make Ca. sacro. de sent. exc^. and ca. Cum
medicinalis cod. tit. lib. 6.
satisfaction for the domages sustained.

The second cause that our Archpriest alleges for suspending, interdicting,
and reduplicating the taking away of my faculties, is for writing a letter the
29. of January, which as he says, is like to those which the Appellants of
Wisbich addressed unto him. And what those were I know not: but the letter for
which he punishes me in so rigorous sort, is the letter that follows, and
which I wrote to a lay Gentleman, taxing me of several faults, and in reply to
one of his, as the tenor shows.

Sir, I wrote to know whether you spoke the words, not whether you spoke them
lately, or long since; neither did I auerre more then that only the notice of
the speeches was given me the night before the date of my letter.

You say, you know not wherein you have charged me with ambition, spite, and
revenge. Sir, read but over my letter again, and consider of the words you
are said to have reported of me, and you may easily see wherein, and how, you
charge me with the said enormities, for reckning me (as you do) the chief of
those whom you call contentious, what follows more directly (if I be chief
of the said company, and that also the total cause of the stirs, another
affirmance of yours, is or was no other, but because my self was not appointed
Archpriest) then that I am through this my continual maintenance of the
controversy upon the foresaid wicked ground, both ambitious, spiteful, and
even great with revenge, yea and envy too.

You also affirm, that you took a great dislike at the last time you talked
with me, by reason of certain words I then used of spite and revenge against a
religious person, that beholding as in a glass such imperfections in a man of
my sort, it has made you ever since the more heedfull to shun the fault.
Sir, I am glad that my frailties are steps to your vprising in virtue. But
touching the truth of your affirmations, what might the words be that I then
used, and which so mightily disliked you? I remember that when you extolled
father Parsons, auowing him to have procured, and done more good to our
country, then any other that lived these many years: I answered, that I could
so little be of that opinion, as I verily thought him of meaner deserts in that
point, then any other that was a Catholic and loved his countrymen. And thus
much I hope I shall be able to make good by evidence of more particulars, then
your self or any other shall be able to disprove. Further I recall, that when
you would free father Parsons from writing any untruths, I replied and said, I
could reprove his pen of many, which now again I should have no scruple to
double speak it, might not the same minister an occasion of a new dislike unto
you; yea and to all too that he has showed in some number of his actions as
little sincerity, as truth in his writings. No doubt you will here cry fie on
passion. But patient your self, and think if I be put to prove it, I may
perchance show it to be rather the issue of true charity, then of choler or
passion. For father Parsons being but one, and one who already in many places
carries but a hard report; and those of whom he takes his pleasure being
many, and such as every where most men speak well of, and the matters wherein
they are accused by him very foul: reason and conscience tell, if proofs were
alike of both sides (as I take them to be much unlike) yet that it were a point
of greater charity rather to think that father Parsons strained a point in
the accusations, then to condemn so many as stand accused, and of like
offenses.

Moreover where you say I exacted an oath of you for concealing my speeches, I
verily think you are mistaken. My reason is, because I do not remember that
for these many years space, I ever exacted an oath of any in what secrecy
soever, but only contented my self with an assured promise. Or be it as you
say, I do now free you of the bond, and give you most frank leave to diuulge
it to whom, and how many, you please.

You notify in your Letter, that you never regarded to put your self in my
company since you heard me speak such uncharitable words (as you term them)
against a religious person. Well, I hope as good men as your self will make no
conscience to be in my company.

But why I pray you do you specify thus much of your disposition unto me, the
knowledge thereof no more auailing? Is it for that my self and the world
should see how exactlie you obey the commandment of holy scripture, Cum
detractoribus non commiscearis, Company not with detractours? I do not believe
it, because I can not believe that you are alike ignorant, as to take that to
be detraction which is spoken in refutation of defaming untruths, in defense of
innocence, and in preserving the odor of our good names, as also in
discharging the bond that God nature; and the duties of our function lay upon
us, being Priests as well as father Parsons, and having the particular charge
of more souls then (I think) he has, and abiding within the reach of our
countrie-perils, from which he long since forsaking our camp, has rescued
himself. Or if you be so ignorant, that you know not to put difference
between chalk and cheese, yet why are you more nice to come into my company,
then you are to converse (and most affectionately) with others, who by tongue
and pen, in secret and in public, and with discovery of infinite more
passion, have at once ransacked the good name and estimation of many Priests,
whereof some also (how vile a wretch soever my self am) are imputed no whit
their inferiors, either for virtue, judgment, experience, sufferance, or
learning, except in the glory of a religious name, or title of authority. I
say ransacked their good names and estimation, by denouncing them to be
schismatikes, to be fallen from Gods Church, to be excommunicate, irregular,
without faculties, to minister Sacraments unworthily, to continue in a damnable
state, to bring mortal sin upon those that partake with us in Sacraments, or
serve us at Mass, and delivering the precious body of our Savior to our
penitents, to deliver poison. But I will leave you to your partial scruples,
and stir this puddle no further, nor ask you more questions, but descend to
another point.

Whether the Letter you wrote right before the coming over of his Holiness
Breue, were fullest of most unseeming and bad terms, let the by-words and
assertions following taken out of the said Letter, and by you imputed unto me,
bear witness for me: namely, disobedient, factious, directly against the
authority of his Holiness, as all but wilful blind men may easily discern:
obstinate, resisting lawful authority: wilfulness, obstinacy, disobedient
disposition: my credit to be in the waine: my present state is adjudged
schism; and my persisting therein feared a revolt. Now Sir be judge your
self, whether these terms (and yet these were not all that your Letter
contained) be not in number sufficient, and of that quality, as may well
verify that your Letter was fullest of unseeming and bad terms? Certes
whatsoever you think, my self made always conscience to show your Letter to
any Lay person, nor did the party either read the same, or heard it read to
my knowledge, what intelligence soever was advertised of her speeches thereupon
unto you. And for Priests, I never showed it to any, who did not condemn it
for a most bold and uncomely kind of writing, that I say no worse.

You advertise, that one who endured the authority as impatiently as my
self, is become an Apostata, and that other of our company live si
scandalouslie, as good men think them nighest to ruin. Sir, if by the
Apostata you mean M. Butler (as I think you can mean none other) then must I
say you do us injury, for Master Butler never took part with us, for ought
that ever I knew or heard, but was always of out Archpriest his side, and now
since his fall, has not let to insult and prefer his case before ours, in
respect his faculties were never taken from him, as Master Mushes and mine
were, and still are. And by whom you mean the other part of your speeches, I
neither know nor can conjecture. But if you understand them by any of those
that subscribed to the Appeal, or that refused to give their names to the
cunning drift of olim dicebamur, I am the more sorry, but shall not believe
you, till I see it true in the effect.

Moreover you avouch, that those men which now are most obstinate to obey,
labored all they could at Rome to make me and other their friends Archbishops
and Bishops. Surely, hardness of belief in the reports that make against us, is
not your fault, God grant your facility or rashness therein be no greater.
What were their names Sir, that so mightily labored our promotion at Rome? My
self knows none that were there to labor it, save only Doctor Bishop, and
Master Charnock, and the one of them living out of the Realm, is no way
subject to Master Blackwels authority, and therefore neither most obstinate,
nor obstinate at all to obey as you affirm. But did these two or either of
them labor to make me, or any others within our Realm, I say not Archbishops,
for that is too fabulous, but Bishops? Let the records of their examination be
reueiwed, and it will evidently appear that neither of them ever named other
for Bishops, but only Doctor Elie, and Doctor Barret. And how did they also
labor this preferment? You say, that they labored it all they could. And what
possibly could that all be, when they were committed close prisoners, and
apart, ere they had entered into any course of dealing, or thoroughly mentioned
their intentions, and so continued in that kind of indurance, till father
Parsons had made all sure by getting forth a Breue for confirmation of his
plotted authority. Me thinks you should do well, for so much as you write,
that some are most obstinate to obey, to particularize their names, and let us
and others know them. But I dare say, you can not name the Priest in our
company, who has refused to obey Master Blackwell since the confirmation of
his authority, in any point, or jot soever, that our reason, reading, and the
counsel of the learned, has thought us bound unto* or not clearly resolved
the contrary.

You say, you will prove where one at least of my friends said, that for
certain I should be a Bishop. Sir, I could wish I did know whether the
intelligencer did here my friend to appoint the time, when, or within which, I
should be made a Bishop; for if he did, and the time be past, he, or you, or
both, may boldly tell my friend (unless difference in your states do make it
ill nurture) that his certainty did greatly deceive him. But let this be as
it may be, yet what worthy exception can the report bring against me, unless
I had all the toongs of my friends tied in a string, as they can not speak
ought belonging unto me, but by my assent or prompting? Can you, or your
intelligencer, or any other prove, or will say, that I soothed my friend in the
speech, or that I heard it, and did not reprehend him, or her, whatsoever the
speaker was, for the same? If you can prove thus much, you say somewhat,
otherwise proving what you can, you say nothing that is material against me in
this point.

Finally, to that you say, that if at the first the authority had bin cast
upon me, as it was upon Master Blackwell, I would upon such good grounds as he
did, have accepted and exercised the same, with out testimony of a Breue to
confirm it; I thus answer in few words: I confess I knew not of certainty
what I should have done if the accident had so fallen out; but if you will have
my conjecture, and what my thoughts now give me, I do verily persuade my self,
that if I had made, and set down in writing the like reasons in the
disallowance and reproof of the other kind of government before intended, as
Master Blackwell did, and so greatly to his own liking, I should not
doubtless so at the first and with like applause, have admired and
congratulated the authority. For what one reason did his Reverence allege in
mislike of the government he impugned and went against, which did not conclude
as much and as directly against this subordination, which, his complying with
the Jesuits, and actioning for them, (as beside other To the Cardinal
Protector.
testimony, his letter of the first of January bears witness) have solicited
and procured to himself? The chief reason he used, and which carried most
weight was, that we Seminary priests having lived now in England* more then
twenty years in great peace, and with like fruit of our labors, without any
superiority constituted among us, it could not be thought either wisdom, or
policy, or other then extreme folly, if after so long experience of a happy
state, we should go about to ordeine a subordination; and therefore he for his
part did condemn, and would ever be against any such innovation, during the
present suite and afflictions of our Country. Again, when Master Blackwell
reasoned with me in this matter, among other exceptions, he insisted most in
this, that the kind of government purposed was very defective, prejudicial,
and faulty, in that it did assign but one only Superior over all the
Priests throughout the whole Realm; adding, that if he should live to the
conversion of our country, he would for so much as should lie in him, solicit
that the Bishoprics might be divided into more Sees: for that as he then
affirmed, the Dioces were greater, and the vnder-pastors more in number then the
travels of one man could well govern: And therefore admit (quoth he) that we
should have a Superior appointed, yet it were most unmeet, that there should
be but one made in the whole Realm.

By that which is said I would say, that how desirous soever you or others
think me of authority (a fault of which mine own conscience does not much
reprehend me, and I thank my Lord Jesus for the grace) I should not, having
before used the like reasons, and speeches, have accepted of the authority in
the manner that Master Blackwell did, or if so I had with most joy accepted
thereof, yet without all peradventure I should not before the receipt of a
Breue or other Apostolical instrument, alike violently have enforced the
submission of my brethren thereunto, with like speed, with like constraint,
with like condemnation, and wrack of their good names, and trouble of no fewer
(as I think) then of a thousand souls.

To make an end, I let pass unanswered the exception you amplify against me,
for writing, that you were in times past beholding unto me, and that you spared
not to interpret the words in the sense that was furthest from my meaning, and
thereupon also to infer, that most pleased your self. For my leaue-taking I
pray you if you write again (which I do not desire) that you would write more
to the purpose, and with fewer fails, or not to mislike if I omit to answer
you. Fare you well, January 29. 1600.

Yours in charity I. Colleton.

I Hope the truth of the contents, but especially the nature of the occasions
which enforced me to write, being the defense of my vnguiltines, do
sufficiently of themselves without other justification, clear me from blame,
or undoubtedly from that manifest kind of blame, as might justly, or colourably
induce our Archpriest to lay so heavy censures upon me, without so much as
citing me before, or examining the particulars and such proofs as I could make
of that I had written. This I trust is so evident to common sense, and palpable
to the dullest understanding, that it were wast labor to dilate thereof, and
greater idleness to stand to confirm it by authorities. For against whom should
the imputative offense be committed? Not against the lay Gentleman to whom I
wrote, for I did but answer to what he objected, and (if I may be my own
judge) in no degree of like quicknes, as his accusations, or truer, his egging
slanders did pattern unto me: not against father Parsons, unless the man
must be alike privileged, that what soever he say, or do, and how usurpingly
soever he shall prosecute and enlarge the same, all notwithstanding must be
bound, under the present clapping on of Censures, not to touch, no not in a
private letter, his least imperfections, albeit they smart never so deeply
through his intemperate humor: not against father Lyster, and his soothers,
because I repeated but their own words, and such as themselves diuulged both
here, and in other places beyond the seas, with great applause of their
ignorant favorites. And if against Master Blackwell (as I do not see how it
can be so taken, because in one point I wrote no more then his Reverence
affirmed unto me: and in the other, I said only what my self should not have
done, as my thoughts then gave me, if so I had bin in his place) yet the injury
I did him, being properly against himself, he could not by the 4. q. 4. Ca. 1.
and 23. q. inter quaerelas.
Cannons of holy Church be judge in his own cause, and inflict the
punishment. A transgression whereof Saint Gregory reprehended the Bishop
Ianuarius with no less words then these: Nihil te ostendas de caelestibus
cogitare, sed terrenam te conuersationem Epist. 34.
habere significas, dum pro vindict a propriae iniuriae (quod sacris regulis
prohibetur) maledictionem anathematis inuexisti. Si tale aliquid denuo feceris,
in te scias postea vindicandum. You show that you have no thought of heavenly
things, but signifyes an earthly conversation, whilst for reuengement of your
own peculiar injury (which holy rules forbid) you impose the curse of
excommunication. If you shall do the like again, know that punishment must be
done upon you. And thus having briefly showed that my letter could not be
justly a cause of the censures and penalties inflicted, for that it neither
wrought, nor inferred a correspondent injury to any person therein specified; I
will descend to the other cause which as yet remains unexamined.

The third and last cause which our Archpriest alleges for suspending,
interdicting, and redoubling the reuocation of my faculties, is: for that there
were three names subscribed to the Appeal, and the Priests whose names they
were, denied to have consented to the letter, or causes prefixed before the
Appeal. The blame of which fraud, his Reverence knew not (as he writes) to
whom sooner to impute it, then to me the sender of the Appeal unto him. When
the will is vehemently bent unto a thing, she occupies oftsoone the
understanding in devising reasons to make it lawful, wherein often she shows
her self so powreable, that enchanting the understanding, she makes it to
receive in gross error, in stead of truth. What could be written with less
reason, or more contrary to the ordinances of the Catholic Church, then for
our Archpriest to declare by a public instrument, addressed to the whole
Clergy, and Catholic laytie, that I had fallen into the Censures of
suspension, and interdict, and incurred the loss of all my faculties, having
taken them from me almost half a year before, and at that present to impose a
new the taking away of them again for a fault (to use his own words) which
indeed he knew not, on whom rather to lay it, then on me? Yea and to add,
that he ought of necessity so to do, having neither cited me before, nor any
way heard or demanded, what I could say to the contrary. God, who is the
viewer of all secrets, and to whose eyes (as the Apostle Hebr. 4.
writes) all things are naked and open, would not condemn our Protoparents
Adam, and Eve, notwithstanding his divine Majesty most thoroughlie knew, they
had transgressed his commandment, Genesis 3.
before he had both summoned Adam to appear, and heard his and Eues defense in
the matter. And if almighty God knowing not only what we can say, but what we
will say in defense, would for example to man, specially to superiors,
vouchsafe notwithstanding to cite and hear the offender before he proceeded to
condemnation, and the inflicting of punishment: how much more meet, and
necessary is it, that inferior Judges, who know nothing but by receipt of
their eye, and ear, should not without summons and examination before, punish
or condemn any, but where the fault and circumstances are most certain, alike
apparent, and altogether incapable of any defense or tergiuersation? Of which
kind we are very sure that none of our actions were, which our Archpriest has
hitherto censured, and sore punished in us without citation, without trial,
without any legal process or inquiry, what we could say for our selves: and
this only, upon pretense that our offenses be notorius, or manifest, and
therefore no need of citation or trial. A threadbare shift, and which cannot
cover the injustice, because that may only be called Gloss. in 1. q. 2. Ca.

notorious or manifest in this matter, as all the Canonists teach, which is by
the nature and evidence of the fact so apparent, as it can neither probably, or
without blushing be denied, nor any defense, or tergiuersation pretended,
Panor. in ca. bonae memoriae de elect. nu. 5.
vbi factum est adeo notorium, quod nulla defensio potest parti absenti
competere, tunc non requiritur citatio: sed vbi factum non est ita notorium,
tunc requiritur citatio, alias sententia sieve processus factus est nullus,
where the fact is so notorious that no defense can appear to be made by the
party absent, then citation is not required: but where the fact is not in such
sort notorious, then summons must be made, otherwise the sentence or process
is of no validity. Now that the fraud which our Archpriest imputes unto me,
is not so notorious or manifest; his own words in the same place do apparently
declare, in that his Reverence says, that he knew not on whom rather to lay
the same fault then on me. Which words cannot but imply an uncertainty, and
consequently not possible that the fact could be notorious in relation to M.
Blackwell, to whom it ought of necessity to have bin notorious, if so his
Reverence, in the sentence and declaration which he made of me without citing,
would not have broken the 2. q. 1. Deus onmipotens.
law of God, In Clem. pastoralis de re iud.
Nature, and Bartola. in L. filius familias ff. de do^.
all Nations.

Touching the suspicion conceived, I am as clear of the fraud his Reverence
obiecteth, as any man in the world, for I was neither the setter down of any
of the three names, nor the motioner, as M. Clarke, M. Mush, and M. Hebborne,
with some other can witness. And to infer as M. Blackwel does, that I was guilty
of the fraud, because I sent him the Apeale, is so weak a proof, as there
needs no disproofe. But what might this notable fraud be, which at least in
the punishment is so exaggerated? forsooth 3. of the apela^ts who have since
renewed their apeale, denied to have given their consent to those letters, which
indeed are the causes which were prefixed before the Apeale. A capital
offense, Priests giving their assent and voices to the making of an appeal,
for relieuing such and such oppressions, and leaving the form and causes
thereof to be drawn by others, they after protested, that they were not
consenting to the said causes which were yielded in particular for proof of
the agreeua^ces.

A Second principal point wherein our Archpriest seems to transgress his
Commission, is, if not in making Decrees, yet undoubtedly in annexing such
censures and penalties as he does unto his Decrees. It has bin showed before,
that in all probability our Page 182. ex sequ.
Archpriest has no authority to suspend from the Altar; and for most
certain, he has no authority to interdict Priests or any Catholic:
therefore these Censures annexed to his Decrees, neither is nor can be less
then an unlawful excess of the authority granted. But let us suppose that
the word [ suspending] in the Constitutiue Letter, gives authority to the
Archpriest to suspend from the Altar, and ministration of all Sacraments: and
let us also suppose that the words [ ecclesiastical penalties] do give him
authority to interdict, whereof there is no color at all, as we have proved
before: Page 185.
yet because the Cardinals letter so co^strued, does not give our Archpriest
authority to use these censures how and when he lists, but only that he may
inflict these censures, if we after due admonitions and The words of the
Constitutiue letter page 2.
reprehensions first used in brotherly charity, shall show our selves
disobedient, unquiet, or contumacious in the things he commands to be
observed. So likewise the authority of restraining, or reuoking faculties, is
not granted him absolutely to exercise at his pleasure (as he seems to
pretend in his Letter to Master Charnock) but only when need shall require
the one, or necessity constrain the other: that is, as the Cardinal himself
explaineth the particulars, when we after the foresaid admonitions and
reprehensions shall demaine our selves disobediently, unquietly, or
contumaciously against his commandments.

From these premises we infer, that albeit our Archpriest has authority
to make Decrees, which we neither deny nor affirm, though we rather think he
can not, unless he first summon us, and propose (as the Constitutiue letter
directs) the things he intends Page 6. 3.
to decree: yet we assuredly believe that his Reverence has no authority nor
jurisdiction at all, to annexe the censures of suspension, or interdict, or the
penalty of leesing our faculties to be incurred ipso facto, if we disobey and
break his Decrees. And the reasons why we be thus persuaded, are, first
because this were presently, before any fact done by us, to pass and impose
the said censures, and ecclesiastical Vgolinus ta. 1. ca. 9. 6 nu. 3.
penalty, and to lay them in the Decree, for it, to execute them, without any
his further concurrance, when the offense is committed. But our Archpriest
has no authority to pass and inflict a Censure, or to restrain and revoke
faculties (as appears by the tenor of the Cardinals letter) save only after
the committing of an offense, and after charitable admonitions and
reprehensions for the same: and therefore till the offense be committed, and
the reprehensions first used, he can not pass and impose any censure or
penalty. And although the publishing of a Decree be a sufficient admonition,
yet the publishing thereof does not nor can not supply (as we think) the
reprehensions, which by the prescript form of the Constitutiue Letter is to be
used before the inflicting of the said penalties.

Again, the edition of a Decree is Panor. in caaeum a consu^tudinis de cod.
tit. nu. 6.
a thing of greater authority, and distinguished from the exercise of bare
jurisdiction, because one may appeal from the sentence or judgment of his
superior, but not from Panorm. in ca. ex li^eris de constit. nu. 9 and Silu.
verb Appell. nu 6.
the penalty or mulcte of a statute: and also because Decrees be certain and
perpetual, but the exercise of jurisdiction variable, according to the
conditions of persons. Wherefore it seems that he, who has but only
authority to impose Censures, or other ecclesiastical penalties, as time,
place, the condition of the offender, and the nature of his offense shall
require, as the Cardinals letter gives our Archpriest no more, can not by
virtue of the same authority make Decrees, and adioyne those penalties unto
them, which he may impose upon the offender after the offense committed:
because as Panormitane writes: In ca. cum consuetudinis cod. tit. nu 6.
potestas habens arbitrium imponendi paenam, non potest a principio per sua
statuta declarare paenas. He that has authority to inflict punishment
according as he shall think good, can not by his statutes before the trespass
be committed, declare the penalties he intends to impose. Briefly the
Arch-priests authority in the exterior court being wholly delegantine, and
in a set form, and no part thereof containing like jurisdiction as to make
Decrees, and annexe such penalties, the fifth Proposition in the second Reason
Page 25.
teaches, that what he does therein, is of no obligation, because Pano^m. in
ca. quae in de co. stit n. 1.
statutum excedens fines potestatis statuendum est ipso iure nullum, the Decree
that exceeds the decreers authority, is absolutely none at all.

A Third principal thing wherein our Archpriest seems to transgress the
laws of holy Church, is, that the sacred Canons Ca super co 2. de appel.
giving all men leave to appeal Ca. de appel. ^od tit.
even for the smallest injustice, and commanding the Superior Ibid. and ca.
vt debitus cod. tit.
to admit every such Appeal, his Reverence notwithstanding imbarreth us to
appeal by collection of names, unless we have first his license thereunto.
Again, thirty of us having joined in one Appeal, and some more since, all
alleging the same causes, and proving them to be most weighty and true,
nevertheless his Reverence refused to admit the Appeal, save only for one of
the whole number. Courses which most directly cross both the rules of law and
conscience. And to prove the particulars.

First, that his Reverence has in the foresaid manner debarred us to appeal,
and that he has also (which is much more) punished us for appealing, it is
clear by the testimony of his own Decrees, and other writings. Prohibemus
autem sub paena etc. We prohibit (says our Archpriest in his Decree of the
18. of November 1600.) under pain of suspension from divine offices, and
leesing all faculties, that no Priest after any manner either by writing or
word of mouth, do seek or give voices in any cause soever, which is not
certainly known to have been communicated before to us, or to two of our
Assistants. Secondly, when signification was given to our Archpriest (which
was performed in the letter that accompanied the Appeal, and is set down
before) that Page 1003.
we intended to move some more of our brethren to give their names to the
Appeal, he presently wrote a letter with this addressed, dated the 28. of
November 1600. To the Reverend and dearly beloved in Christ my Assistants and
felow-priests, in which the words following are inserted: Quoniam sunt quidam
qui in eo cauillati sunt, quod collectionem suffragiorum ad notitiam aut meam
aut Assistentium deferri mandauerim; cognoscite in hoc hunc f^isse meum sensum,
quem sic declaro, vt communicationem facerent collectionis suff^agiorum cum
Superiore, cuius consensus exquirendus and habendus est. Atque illud praecipue
intendimus: quod Decretum antecedentibus temporibus confi^matum fiat
authoritate Ill^^ (bonae memoriae) Cardinalis Caictani. that is. Because there
are certain that have cauilled, for that I commanded the collection of
suffrages to be imparted to me, or the Assistants, know ye in this thing, this
to be my meaning, which thus I declare, that they should communicate the
gathering of voices with the Superior, whose consent is to be asked and
obtained. And this was that which we chiefly intended: which Decree in former
times was confirmed by the authority of the most Illustrious (of good memory)
Cardinal Caietane.

By which passage, and that which was rehearsed out of the Decree, together
with the cause, for which his Reverence made this explication, it very plainly
appears, that he forbids us either to appeal, or at least to give, or
ask names for making of an Appeal without his consent. And that this is no
more nor otherwise, then our Archpriest himself acknowledges, his words
ensuing in the same letter do testify: Quod enim in suis literis p^sucrunt
d^^r^ta qu^d^m nostra 18. Octobris edita, plane constat eos non ignorasse d^o
i^a potissinum, quae in ipsorum literis Cotinentur, quibus s^b gra^^bus p^^n^
praeteritae inobedientiae de fensionem and collectionem collattenem^e
siffragior^m express prohibuimu^. Quae tamen ills omnes (si omnes quod non
credimus vere subscripserunt) manifiste transgressi sunt. Quare ^os sane non
vid^mus, qua ratione ab illis poenis liber^ esse possint, qu^tquot hu^^ friuol^
appellationi vel subscripserunt vel consenserunt. That is. For that they have
put down in their letter certain Decrees of mine, set forth the 18. of
October, it is very evident, that they were not ignorant especially of these
two things contained in their letters, by which we expreslie forbid under
grievous penalties, the defense of their former disobedience, and the
collection or joining of voices. Which things they all (if all, which we do not
believe, have indeed subscribed) have manifestly transgressed. Wherefore we
surely do not see by what means they may be freed ( that is, of suspension
from divine off^ces, and of leesing all faculties) how many soever have either
subscribed or consented to this frivolous appeal.

What more evident, the premises put together, then that our Archpriest,
stiling his prohibitions by the name of Decrees, and prohibiting us under pain
of suspension, and loss of faculties, to collect names for making an appeal,
and after censuring us to have incurred the said penalties for collecting and
joining names to and in one appeal, does plainly forbid us either to appeal,
or at leastwise as we have said, to seek or give names for appealing together
without his obtained consent. And if either, as there can be no evasion in the
latter, then considering his Reverence did make this prohibition by the name of
a Decree, it seems infallibly to follow, the same Decree being a violation,
restriction, or abridging of Ecclesiastical liberty, that he by making and
publishing the same, incurred the 15. excommunication in Bulla Per Clement. 8.
anno 1598.
Caenae domini, and those that Gloss in ca. nouerit de sent. e^com. verb.
s^riptores.
wrote* the same Constitution, or counseled or aided him in the making or
publishing thereof, or have presumed to judge according to the contents, seem
also to have incurred the excommunication of Pope Honorius the third, registered
in the Ca. noucrit de sent. excom.
Decretals.

That the above mentioned Decree of our Archpriest is against the honor of
ecclesiastical liberty, it appears by several heads. First, for that by
the name of ecclesiastical liberty, that liberty Innocentiu^ and Panor. in

(as all writers affirm) is understood, which the whole universal Church
inioyeth, and the faculty of appealing without the Superiors leave, is a

the law Valent. to. 3. disp. 5. q. 13. punct. 3.

example of S. Paul, who appealed to Caesar, but also by sundry Papal
constitutions, as of Pope Epist. 1. 2. q. 6. ^. Omnis oppressus.

and a nullo prohibeatur. Let every one that is oppressed freely appeal (if he
please) to the judgment of Gloss. ibidem.
Bishops, and be hindered by none. Also of Ibid. c. ad Roman. 2.
Pope Zepherinus: Ad Romanam ecclesiam ab omnibus maxim tamen ab oppressis
appellandum est, and concurrendum quasi ad matrem vt eius vberibus nutriantur,
authoritate defendantur, and a suis oppressionibus releuentur: All persons
especially the oppressed, may appeal to the Roman Church, and have recourse
to her, as to their mother, that they may be nourished with her paps, defended
by her authority, and relieved of their oppressions. According to which
sayings, and many 2. q. 6. per totum.
more like in the Canons, Pope Ca. super eo 2. de appel.
Alexander the third writes: Sacri Canones singulis faciunt facultatem
appellandi: That the sacred Canons do give every one leave to appeal.
Therefore the Superiors leave is not necessary, as Master Blackwell in his
decree exacteth, and consequently thereby abridging the rights of
ecclesiastical liberty, incurreth as we have said the censure of
excommunication in Bulla coenae domini.

Secondly, the foresaid Decree of our Archpriest impeacheth the right of
ecclesiastical liberty, because illud statutum dicitur contra libertatem
ecclesiasticam per quod prohibetur personis ecclesiasticis illud quod neque
iure diuino, neque humano prohibitum est. That constitution is against
ecclesiastical liberty (as writes In ca. nouerit. de sent. excom^. 4.
Felinus) by which ecclesiastical persons are forbid that, which neither by
divine or human law is prohibited. And it can not be showed out of either
law, that Priests be debarred either to seek or give voices for joining in one
appeal, without consent and leave of the Superior. We will here omit for
brevity sake what In summa verb. excom. ca. 31. verse. quinta nota.
Caietaine In margarita sua super decret. verb. ecclesia.
Baldus, and Verb. immunitas 2. n. 2.
Siluester write in the explication of the word [ ecclesiastical libertie] and
set down the excommunication it self, which peradventure best declares, what
is signified by ecclesiastical liberty. In Bulla coenae dom. Clemen. papae 8.
anno 1598.
Necnon qui statuta, ordinationes, constitutiones pragmaticas, seu quaeuis alia
Decreta in genere, vel in specie, ex quauis causa, and quouis quaesito color,
ac etiam praetextu cum suis consuetudinis, aut priuilegij, vel alias
quomodolibet fecerint, ordinauerint, and publicauerint, vel factis, and
ordinatis vsi fuerint, vnde libertas ecclesiastica tollitur, seu in aliquo
laeditur, vel deprimitur, aut alias quouismodo restringitur, seu nostris and

indirecte, tacit, vel express praeiudicatur. The english. We excommunicate
and anathematize all and singular persons, who shall make, ordain, and publish
statutes, ordinances, constitutions pragmaticall, or any other Decrees in
general or special, upon any cause or devised color, and under pretense of
any custom or privilege, or in what other sort soever, or being made or
ordained, shall use them, whereby ecclesiastical liberty is taken away, or
any way diminished or depressed, or after any sort restrained, or prejudice
inferred by any manner of way, directly or indirectlie, covertly or expressly,
against our rights, or of the Sea Apostolic, or against the rights of what
other Churches soever.

Now whether the state of ecclesiastical liberty, by the foresaid Decree of
our Archpriest, especially expounded as himself enlarged it, and is before
set down, be either disanulled, impeached, diminished, or any way directly or
indirectlie, implicitiuely or expressly streited, we leave to others to judge,
when as the same Decree forbade us under threat of suspension from divine
offices, and forfet of all our faculties, either to seek or give voices in any
cause soever, without his consent and leave, and that we should not collect and
join voices in making an Appeal to his Holiness, unless we have his assent
thereunto, and has sithence punished our attempt therein, both by declaring
that we incurred the foresaid censure and penalties in breaking his Decree, by
subscribing our names to the Appeal, and by suspending and taking away our
faculties for the same cause, as the foregoings do most manifestly convince,
and hundreds beside can witness?

Tenaunts oppressed by their temporal Lord, may without his license by all
laws confer and combine themselves in one complaint, for reformation of
their injuries: likewise subjects receiving wrong through the ignorance or
corruption of any under officer, or vicegerent, may unite themselves, give, and
gather names for manifesting their pressures by way of Supplication to their
Prince and Sovereign, without the parties consent or priuitie, who unjustly
afflicts them: yea the contrary in either example or infinite more that might
be alleged to the same purpose, were plain tyranie in the secular state. And
if in the civil regiment these things be alike lawful, and sometime
necessary, can they be unlawful, or may they possibly be prohibited in
ecclesiastical government, and the rights of ecclesiastical liberty not
infringed? No, no, the matter is plainer then it can be doubted of. And if so,
then did our Archpriest (as we fear) and some other cooperators who are
comprehended under the Canon of Vbi supra.
Honorius, incur excommunication in the nature of the fact: and because the
said decree, is not yet cancelled, nor revoked, but rather still extended
against us, we think further that his Reverence after absolution falls
again so often into that censure, as he makes use of the decree against us,
which has bin not seldom. And it is strange, that the nature of the decree
considered (which can by no shift of wit be truly salued from being against the
rights of ecclesiastical liberty) our Archpriest was not afraid to let pass
in a common letter under his hand and 28. of Noue^ber 1600.
seal, that the above mentioned part of the decree containing such od stuff,
was confirmed by Cardinal Caietane in his life time. A report, which for the
distaine it brings to the dead, we should not believe. Or if it be true, yet
we hope, it was but a slye finesse of father Parsons, winning the Cardinal to
confirm what his grace looked not into; for that no Cardinal whosoever, has
authority to decree any such extremity. But howsoever the same was, it can
not but witness a very severe course intended, when such a decree importing (if
we mistake not the case) sacrilegious injustice, was beforehand devised and
ratified.

A Fourth chief particular, wherein our Archpriest seems to have transgressed
the laws of holy Church, is, in that many of us joining in one appeal, and
alleging the same causes, his Reverence admitted the Appeal for one, and
rejected it in the behalf of all the rest. For either the said Appeal was
just or unjust, in respect of us all, or none, in that we were all united in
the action, and yielded the same reasons. And if unjust, then did our
Archpriest violate the sacred canons in approving it toward one, because they
prescribe, that when the appeal is unjust, the Superior should not defer
thereunto. Ca. cum appellationibus eod. tit. lib. 6. and idem habetur cap. cu^
speciali. porro.
Appellationibus friuolis nec iustitia defert, nec est a iudice deferendum.
Neither does justice allow frivolous appeals, nor ought the Judge to admit
them. And the Gloss Ibidem.
goes further, Iudex a quo, non debet defer appellationi friuolae, quae
interponitur sine causa, vel causa est irrationabilis, aut est fals^, imo si
deferat, peccat mortaliter: The Judge from whom Appellation is made, ought not
to admit a frivolous Appeal, which is interposed without a cause, or upon an
insufficient or false cause: nay rather if he defer thereunto, he commits
mortal sin. The like has In ca. de priore de appel. nu. 2.
Panormitane, though not in so plain terms; and Siluester Verb. appellatio,
nu. 13
calls the deferring to an unjust appeal, malice and imprudency. And the
reason why it is sin, is plain, because in receiving an unjust appeal, the
course of justice is broken, and iniquity patronised.

Of the contrary side if the appeal were just, then did his Reverence more
grievously offend in not admitting the same. 2 q. 6. decr^to. Note the
punishment and censures of not admitting a just appeal.
Si a quoquam secus praesumptum fuerit ab officio cleri submotus, authoritatis
Apostolicae reus ab omnibus iudicetur: ne Lupi, qui sub specie ouium
subintrauerunt, bestiali saeuitia quosque audeant lacerare: He that shall
presume (says Pope Gregory the fourth) to reject a lawful and just appeal,
ought to be put from his office, and of all men to be judged guilty of
contempt against authority Apostolical, least Wolves that privily entered in
Sheep clothing, should not fear to vex and torment others with beastly
cruelty. Which injustice of not deferring to a just appeal Ca. de prior^ de
appell.
Pope Alexander the third terms a grievous excess, and prescribes, that he
who should presume to commit the offense is (if the appeal were made to the
Sea Apostolic) to be sent to the court of Rome, there to satisfye and be
punished for the transgression.

Or if finally, the appeal were neither apparantlie just, nor unjust, but
doubtful (as how it could so appear we do not see, because the causes
alleged therein, were most weighty, demonstratiue, and proved by several
testimonies out of Master Blackwels own letters and other his writings) yet
do the Ca. Cum speciali de appell. porro.
Canons in this case appoint the Judge to receive the appeal, as both the
Glossa in ca. Sacro de sent. excom. verb. ^^bitari. Durandus de appell. 9. nu.
5. Panormita. in ca. vt debitus de appell. nu. 30. and VVamesius ^od. tit. in

expositors of the law and Siluester verb. appell. nu. 13.
Summists testify: Si iudex de legitimatione appellationis dubitat Vbi supra.
debet and Vbi supra.
tenetur differ. If the Judge doubt of the lawfulnes of the appeal, he ought
and is bound to defer thereunto. And the reason is, because appellation does
always implie an injustice received, or intended: and in things doubtful, the
Salo^ de iustitia q. 63. art. 4. contr. 2. concl. 2. and regula 11. de reg.
iur. lib. 6.
divine law, natural and humane, declares, that the case of the agrieued or
sufferer is to be preferred.

A Fifth essential point wherein our Archpriest seems likewise to transgress
the laws of holy Church, is, that his Reverence having admitted my appeal a
grauaminibus futuris, from future agrieuances, and delivered me my apostles or
dimissory letters, would From the 20. of December to the 21. of February
following.
some few weeks after, notwithstanding this his formal allowance of the
Appeal, suspend, interdict, and redouble the taking away of my faculties, and
this upon no new offense which was notorious, but See these things set down in
his own letter page 190.
even for consenting to the prefixing of the causes before the appeal, which
himself admitted, and for making answer to a lay Gentleman his letter, the
copy whereof is set down before, and lastly, for that three of the appellants
did deny the giving of their assents to the said causes which were prefixed.

All Ca. super de appel. Ca. Romana. and ca. sia Iudice de appel. lib. 6.
Panormitan in ca. ad reprimendam de off. iudi. ordi. nu. 9. Silu. verb.

laws and writers do assign these two effects to every appeal admitted, viz.
the suspending of the superiors jurisdiction in the cause, from whom, and in
which, the appellation was made, and the reuoluing of the said cause to the
trial of the higher Judge, to whom the appellation was made. Hence it
appears plain that Master Blackwel admitting my appeal, and after
proceeding against me, in the very same kind of agrieuances for which I
appealed: and this his proceeding against me chiefly for annexing the causes
of the Appeal he allowed, without any new and notorious offense committed by
me, as the fore-goings do manifestly convince: hence I say it most evidently
appears, that his Reverence therein brake the laws of holy Church, unless
his authority be a transcendant above all the written rules either of law or
conscience.

A sixth particular wherein our Archpriest exceeds the limits of his
authority as we verily believe, is, his opinion and practice touching the
reuocation of faculties. What opinion his Reverence holds herein, his letters
to Master Charnock of the 17. of June 1600. This letter is set down page 199.
do manifestly show, wherein amongst other things he writes thus, Facultatum
concessio vt etiam duratio mere voluntaria censenda est, cum facultates
delegatae sine vllo prorsus crimine, solo nutu concedentis, vel ab co
potestatem habentis expirent: As the grant of faculties, so the continuation
of them is to be counted mere voluntary, since delegatine faculties expire
without any fault, upon the sole will of the graunter, or of the party that
has authority from him. A strange position, and which cannot but prognosticate
somewhat. See Panormitan. in ca. in singulis de stat. mona. nu. 7.


Cardinal Caietaine appointed Master Blackwell Archpriest, and gave him
Delegatine authority, as is plain by his graces words, cui vices nostras pro
tempore delegemus, to whom for the time we delegate our stead: and yet 6.
verse. 10. Note a contradiction between the two opinions.
father Lyster in his treatise against us affirms, that the Pope cannot
depose him without a crime committed: neither is the authority or office
wherewith Master Blackwell is invested, a like mean of his maintenance, as
the having of faculties is to Priests that live in our country, which puts
a material difference between the cases, and infers, that if Master
Blackwell may not, but upon a crime be removed by the Pope, much less may
faculties be taken away from Priests in England without any crime foregoing.

The donation of faculties to Priests in their mission, seems not so to
depend on the mere pleasure of the superior, as our Archpriest would
pretend, but rather to be an implicitiue covenant, and the performance thereof
due unto them by justice, unless their own misdemeanor bereave them of the
interest. For can their admittance into any of the Colleges; the addicting of
themselves to the study of Divinity; the taking of an oath to be made Priests,
and go into England when the Superior shall appoint, promise less then a
covenant on the Superiors side, to furnish them with faculties at the time of
their going, unless (as is said) their own deserts shall make them unworthy?
since the having of faculties is the chiefest mean of inabling the^ to do good
in our country, the end why they became Priests, and resigned the liberty of
their former state. And as the giving of faculties to Priests at their
departure for England, is not to be counted a mere voluntary favor, being in
truth the due hire of their travels, and alteration of their state; so neither
can the continuation of our faculties justly be deemed to depend in such sort
upon the will of the graunter, as that at his pleasure they expire and
determine, without any sufficient cause given. Undoubtedly, the disgrace, and
injuries which accompany such a fact, is an oppression that sends up his cry
to heaven for punishment upon the imposer.

An extremity, that men who have left the University, forsaken the
preferments of learning in their country, relinquished their patrimonies, lost
the love of their worldly friends, brought themselves in dislike with their
Prince, and the State, devoted their travels to the gaining of souls, and
hourly for that cause venture their lives, and floting beside in a sea of
difficulties, must after all these, and in the midst of these, be spoiled of
their faculties, yea, at the arbitrarie pleasure of another, and this sine
crimine, without any blame or fault. But who sees not how this doctrine of our
Archpriest tends to bondage and mere tyranny? For have Priests in our
Country either Tithes, Parsonage, or Vicaredge, or any other help of
maintenance (though they serve the Altar in more danger then any Priest in the
Christian world beside) then the voluntary charities of those, with whom they
deal? And with whom can they deal, being deprived of their faculties?

The Council of Sess 21. de refor ca. 2. and sc 1.
Trident enacteth several prouisoes, that Priests should not through
necessity of want be driven to beg, holding the same a reproach to the order.
The like also have the ancient Canons Did. 50. ca. studeat.
decreed, appointing that Priests, even guilty of murder, when their lives are
spared, should be allowed a competent portion for their maintenance, out of the
benefices they had when they committed the fact. And touching the censure of
suspension, all the Canons Panormit. in ca. pastoralis verum nu. 16. D^cius nu.
7 ibid. de app^ll^. Felinus in ca. Apost^licae de except. na. 12. G^mini mus in
ca. si compromissarius de elect. li. 6. and alij.
agree, that when one is suspended from the fruits of his benefice pro poena,
for punishment of a fault, his necessities are to be relieved out of the same
benefice: Glossa in ca. studeat d. st. 50. verb. and sin.
Licet clericus sit su^pensus ab homine vel Canone, tamen ei relinqui debeat,
vnde se and suos p^ssit suslentare. Albeit a Clergy man be suspended by his
Ordinary or the Canon, yet there ought so much to be allotted unto him, as
wherewith he may honestly maintain himself and his family. But our
Archpriest, as his own writings declare, seems to have little part of this
consideration and good spirit, when he teaches and diuulgeth that all our
faculties (being the only means we live by) may be taken away sine crimine
upon his only will.

The Cardinal in his ninth Instruction, calls those Priests that are
resident in Catholic houses, the parish priests of the same flock. Which if it
be so, then have they in respect of the said persons Henriquez de poeni. sacra.
lib. 3. ca. 6. nu. 6.
authority a iure communi, to hear their confessions, and absolve them of all
sins, from which ordinary Curates may absolve their parishioners. Nor can
this jurisdiction for any cause be taken away, so long as they remain their
Pastors, though the same may be suspended. But let this stand as it may, yet
it is very apparent, and none can deny, but that our faculties here in England
are in stead of Church-liuings unto us, and our only benefices. Rebuffus In
repet. de rescrip. coll. 2. ad medium.
writes and In verb. Papa nu. 12. and 13.
Siluester, and In 12. q. 2. non liceat.
Archidiaconus have the same, quod Papa post collata beneficia non habet
potestatem auferendi ea sine causa, that the Pope after induction has not
authority to deprive the incumbent, or take away the benefice without a cause:
and the same Author proves the position by Barbatia In ca. quod translationem
de offi. legate. nu. 121. invent. 16. qu. 7.
where he says, that it was defined by the Council, that none should be
deprived of their benefices nisi pro graui culpa, but only upon a sore and
grievous offense: Yea the contrary seems to be, as P. 2. lib. 2. cap. 18.
nu. 9.
Graffius writes, against the rights of moral equity, namely, that one
should be put from his benefice, which perhaps he atteyned to by much pain and
expenses, without any cause or fault foregoing, that could deserve the
deprivation. Which if it be true in the ablation of benefices granted, it
holds more true and stronger in the reuocation of our faculties, for the
causes abouementioned.

It appears by that little we have said, how unconscionable and extreme is
the opinion, which our Archpriest holds touching the voluntary grant and
continuation of our faculties. Let us now see the correspondencie of his
practice; and as we have always alleged his Decrees or letters for proof of
that we affirmed, so shall we do the like in this point also, being of
importance. And to the end no exception may be taken either for abridging or
dismembring his words, we will set down the whole Instrument by which his
Reverence first took away faculties from some of us.

The English.
To all my dearly beloved Assistants, and to the English Clergy, salutation.
BE it known unto you, that heretofore we suspended Master John Mush, and
Master John Colleton, from the use of their faculties, for their manifest
disobedience, and perturbation of peace: and afterward restored them upon
their submission. But now because they defend their cause, and require
satisfaction etc. and have sent us diverse letters full of contumelies and
calumniations, partly published against our selves, partly also against other
Superiors: and even at this very instant do go about many thing contrary to
peace etc. Therefore we George Blackwell Archpriest of England, do revoke from
these two all their faculties etc: commanding that you make the same known to
all Catholics, least perhaps they may receive Sacraments at their hands. More
of these matters you shall understand by our general letters: for credit of
which matters we have subscribed with our own hand these our letters sealed
with our own Scale. From London the 17. of October 1600.

Your servant in Christ George Blackwell, Archpriest of England.


Presently as I received the aforesaid Instrument, which was the seventh day
after the date thereof, I returned the letter following.

VEry Reverend Sir, at this instant Master Heborne delivered me a Letter
directed to your Assistants and the Clergy of England, giving them to
understand, that you have revoked all Master Mushes faculties and mine, with
an etc. And you specified four causes thereof with a second etc. The first is,
for that we defend our cause: then for that we ask satisfaction: thirdly for
writing unto you diverse letters full of contumely or calumniations; partly
published against your Reverence, partly also against other Superiors; and
lastly, for that at this present we busily bestir our selves in many matters
against peace, with a third etc. Moreover you command the said Assistants and
Clergy of England, to acquaint all Catholics with what you have done, least
happily they receive Sacraments of us: concluding, that they shall understand
more things out of your common letters. My humble request is, that you would
vouchsafe to express these residues at length and plainly, as also what
common letters you mean, and to whom we shall resort for a sight of them:
otherwise in my poor judgment the process will appear hard. For to diuulge
in this notorious manner the taking away of our faculties, which heapeth
discredit, and sundire other damages upon us, and alike vnperfectlie or by
halfes to recite the causes, and lay down the punishment, as the reader
through additions of et-cetera-es, is left, as it were to a wide scope, to
conceive what further bad matter or consequence he lists of our demeanor, or
state of soul; and not upon entreaty so much as to make a full and distinct
declaration in the premises, if the proceeding be iuridicall, or have
neighborhood with clemency, either my books be false, or I understand them
not. If your Reverence took but all our faculties from us, and the
et-cetera-es adjoined implie no Censure nor a notorious damnable state; then I
desire to know the reason, why we may not minister, and the Laity receive at
our hands the Sacrament of the holy Eucarist, baptism, or extreme unction,
which your causatiue ne, seems, and by congruitie of speech can not, as I
think, but deny. Concerning the causes alleged, I acknowledge, as I ever
have* so do I continually maintain that we were no schismatikes, for delaying
to subject our selves to your authority, before the arrival of his holiness
Breue, and that I also insist for the reuersement of father Listers pamphlet,
as most wrongfullie condemning us of that detestable crime. For the other two
offenses your Reverence charge me with, I deny them utterly, and do beseech
you most humbly to name the Letter, and particular the contumely or calumnes
in which I abused your Reverence, or forgot my self toward any other
Superior. The like I desire touching my busy practices against peace, and
with greatest instancie. Thus your Reverence in few words sees my grounds, and
understands my requests: I humbly pray the grant: and so with duty do
leave, beseeching God to guide you, and increase patience in me. 24. of October.

Your Reuerences, John Colleton.


Notwithstanding which earnest petition to our Archpriest for his answer to
the points, he, nevertheless as if he had bin more then the Metrapolitane of
England, and my self the meanest Priest on earth, returned me a ragged piece
of paper, such as would not much more then come about a man's thombe, with these
words written in it, legatur Suarez tom. 3. disput. 16. sect. 1. and disput.
72. sect. 4. eod. to. together with a few broken speeches by word of mouth,
either not appertayning, or not satisfying my demands, which also the
messenger being a lay person, would not put down under his hand nor attestate.
The places he referred me unto, teach, that Priests deprived of Ecclesiastical
jurisdiction, can not lawfully minister any Sacrament, and how many ways they
sin mortallie that minister a Sacrament unworthily, or others in receiving
of a Sacrament at the hands of an unworthy Minister. So that his intent in
quoting the places was plain, viz. that I could not, he having taken away all
my faculties, administer any Sacrament at all, and that I lived in notorious
mortal sin, and therefore none, without sinning deadly, could receive a
Sacrament of me. Wrongs, which as I pray God of his mercy to forgive him, so
do I hope, that neither he, nor all his adherents, shall be able to prove* if
they give hands, and devise all the quircks and quidities in the world for
bolstering up the slander.

And before we descend to the examination of the causes, which his Reverence
alleges in the Instrument for the punishment he inflicteth, it seems
necessary to speak a word or two, explicating the beginning of his Letter, as
also for declaring how and when he may take away our faculties by the
authority granted.

Some nine or ten days before the arrival of his Holiness Breue, for
confirmation of the new authority, Master Blackwell suspended See more of
this matter page 52.
the use of Master Mushes faculties, Master Hebornes* and mine, because we
would not admit him, before he should show his Holiness Letters for proof of
the promotion. Which refusal being lawful according to all laws, he terms
a manifest disobedience: and our receiving of him upon the first appearing of
the Breue, he names our submission; and the removing of the suspension, the
restitution of our faculties, all spoken improperly, and the first also very
wrongfullie.

Touching the other point, how and when his jurisdiction authoriseth him to
take away faculties, there can not be made a better declaration thereof, then
are the self words of the Constitutiue Letter, being the set form of his
Commission, and from which he can Gloss. in ca. cum dilecta de rescript.
not swerve a hairs breadth, which are these: To restrain or suspend the use
of faculties if there shall be need, or to take them wholly away if
necessity constrain. So that of force, either need or necessity must be the
antecedent to his correction: need, if he restrain our faculties, or
necessity if he take them away. And when is this? Marie as the same letter
specifieth and seems to limite, when his Reverence has summoned us, and
proposed with the advice of his Assistants, the things which either he shall
judge necessary to be observed by us, or shall think needful to be written
to Rome, or to Doctor Barret President of Doway, and we in the same matters
shall show our selves disobedient, unquiet, or contumaceous: then that his
Reverence after due admonitions, and reprehensions used in brotherly charity,
may either take away, or suspend our faculties. Which passage (being the words
of the Cardinals letter, and coming after the general grant of restraining
or reuoking faculties, and in the place where his Grace delivered the form,
how and when the Archpriest should use the said punishing jurisdiction)
appears to be the true, and intended exposition and limits of the former
clause [ when there shall be need, or necessity constrain.] Or whether this
be so or no, yet it is evident by the discourse of reason, and the testimony
of the learned, that this need or necessity Arg. gloss. in ca. vt debitus de
Appell. verb. ex rationabile.
must be construed according to the truth of matters, and not according to the
private conceit or opinion of our Archpriest. For howsoever father Parsons the
plotter and penner of the subordination, would perchance make our Archpriest
judge in the matter, and not truth and reason; yet we have no doubt, but the
Cardinal the institutour, and are most sure, that his Holiness the confirmer,
would have this [ need or necessitie] to be taken according to the verity of
the matter in it self, that is Arg. 11. q. 3. nemo Episcoporum and ca. sacro
de sent. excom.
for a certain and manifest need or necessity, and not according to any man's
formed fancy, or corrupt understanding. And if the Cardinal, and his Holiness
had this meaning by the words, as we may not mistrust but they had, then can
not our Archpriest, (words especially deriuing jurisdiction, being Ca.
intelligentia de verb. signif.
to be understood not as they sound, but according to the intention of the
speaker) suspend or take away faculties, but when there is a true and a real
need or necessity, which in this subject (the nature of the punishment, and
circumstances of place and persons considered) can not be, but a matter of
mortal sin, and such a mortal sin, as is clear by the evidence of the
transgression it self, and that the delinquent was admonished before of the
fault, and did not amend. For if admonition would morallie, or did reform the
party, there can be no necessity, or need either of repealing, or suspending
his faculties. Now to the examination of the causes.

The first cause that our Archpriest alleges is, for that we defend our
cause. O Lord, would not a man wonder to hear such a cause alleged, if so he
knew that we were never iuridicallie condemned, and less by such a superior
Judge, as from whose sentence we neither did nor could appeal. Verily the
ignorance or exigent must needs be great, when that is brought for a cause of
robbing Priests of their faculties in such a country as ours, which the law
of God, Nature, and all Nations does allow, namely, the uncondemned to
maintain and defend their vnguiltinesse, and the reputation of their good
names.

The second cause put down, is, our demand of satisfaction. Strange and very
strange how the asking of satisfaction, that is a recompense D. Tho. in 4 did
15. q. 1. art. 1. q. 3.
according to the equality of justice for injuries committed, can be reputed a
cause of taking away faculties from Priests living in England; and the injury,
for which satisfaction was demanded, not disproued, yea, in the immediate and
direct consequence approved to be a true and grievous injury by the censure of
a famous University. But what was the satisfaction demanded, and which did
alike aggrauate the matter, as for it our faculties must be taken away, without
proof of the cause or citation? Father Lister in a public Treatise condemned
us of Schism, our Archpriest approves the condemnation, and in several
letters not vnstiflie maintains the same: our ghostly children by his and
the Jesuits report, or defamations rather, were put in fear to have
spiritual participation with us: and we desired the retractation of the said
treatise, as also of the resolution which our Archpriest sent abroad as
received from Rome, charging us with the same crime. And are not these, trow
ye, capital demands, being duties of injustice by all laws; if so we be
clear of the crimes pretended, as now the Pope himself on the first of April
last, after the full hearing of the matter, and after all the accusations,
shifts, and descants, that father Pa^sons, his friends, and the advocates of
our Archpriest could amplify, has declared for us, and freed as well from
the imputation of rebellion and schism, as from the ignominy of the
disobedience objected, for not admitting the subordination, before the coming
over of his Breue in confirmation of the same. Who is more blind, than he, that
will not see? And holy scripture says, haec cogitauerunt and errauerunt;
excaecauit Sapient. 2.
autem illos malitia eorum, these things they have thought, and they have
erred, for the faultiness of their affection has blinded their understanding.

The third cause rendered by our Archpriest for the taking away of my
faculties, is, for that I wrote diverse letters unto him full of contumelies,
or calumniations, partly published against himself, partly against other
Superiors. In my requests above specified, I besought his Reverence to name
the letter unto me, or set down the words, wherein I had misdemeaned my self,
either toward him, or any other Superior. What could I do more, my self not
remembering any such thing, for coming to the understanding of my fault? But as
reasonable as this petition was, yet his fatherhood not liking, or not
vouchsauing to answer me directly, only willed me to recount what I had
written: and this was all that either then, or ever since I could receive from
him, touching the particulars of the foresaid general charge.

Let others judge of the course, and how far the same is from show of all
good dealing, that any Priest his faculties should be taken from him, upon any
general cause, without descending to the particular, or further proof of the
general, then by willing him to remember what he had written. The Sheriff of
London comes to Symphronius and takes away all his goods, pretending that he
wrote unto him certain letters, wherein sundry hye treasons were contained.
Symphronius robbed in this manner of his goods, demands the Sheriff who
made the seizure, to tell him what letters of his these were, and what were the
treasonable words in particular, for which he thus oppresses him? The Sheriff
bids him remember what he wrote, and other answer gives none. Who will
not admire the injustice, the party thus rifled, being neither condemned, nor
the treasons particularized, nor proof made of any? Again, how would our
Country exclaim of the cruelty, if the Lord chief Justice should put a
Counselor from the bar, and forbid him his practice, alleging for cause,
that he had spoken dishonourablie of him, but would not recite what speeches
they were, nor when he spoke them, nor suffer him to plead and prove his
innocence in the accusation? Our Archpriest his usage is in all points like:
he took away our faculties before the fault was proved, the use of them being
the only trade we have to live by; neither will he suffer us to argue and
defend our vnguiltines, but beside the prohibition and injustice, defameth us
in generalities: and requested to name the particulars, he refuses and bids
us to examine our selves: a reason that the greatest tyrant in the world may
yield for the fowlest wrong that can be committed. Some of my letters unto him
are set down before, others follow, as the contents of them do fall in with
the matter treated, and the reader may judge how full they are of contumelies
or calumniations, that is, of D. Tho. 2. 2. q. 72. art. 1. and q. 73. art. 1. c.
open reproachful words against his, or any other Superiors honor, and of
imposing of Idem 2. 2. q 68. art. 3. c.
false and malicious crimes upon either. Certes many of those that have already
seen my letters, rather take my manner of writing to the Archpriest for
ouer-ceremonious and submissiue, then for contumelious and calumniatiue. And I
verily assure my self, that the partiallest reader who shall not wilfully
depose all regard of equity and conscience, can not but witness for me against
the accusation; if he duly consider of the many injuries his Reverence has
done me, and the infinite prouocations which his common made letters have
given, especially that by name which he wrote to Master Iackson the 18. of
March. In which his Reverence not only calls me the son of Beliall, but
applies besides this sentence of holy Scripture unto me, ab immundo, quid
mundabitur, and a mendace, quid Eccle. 34.
verum dicetur? What shall be cleansed by the unclean, and what truth can be
spoken by a liar? Which words as well the ordinary gloss, as Lyra, and other
expositours, do appropriate to the Devil only, and can be verified of none
other, and much less of a Priest; who, how wicked and abominable soever his
inward life be, yet does he ministeriouslie cleanse, either when he baptiseth
or absolueth: and although the Devil sometimes tells truth, yet because he
never tells truth but to the end to deceive, and for that such acts D Th. 1.
2. q. 1. art. 3. and q. 19. art. 4. 6. and 7. and 2. 2. q 43. art. 3. and q.
64. art. 7.
take their denomination of the end: therefore the Devil always intending
deceit, no truth, as holy Scripture affirms, can be expected from him.
Which kind of habituate and obdurate wickedness and reprobation, being not to be
found in any mortal man, the place can not be truly spoken of any, but of the
Devil: and if of none except the Devil, doubtless his Reverence showed
either much spleen, or some ignorance in applying this sentence to me, whom yet
he has not proved to be of so infectious uncleanness and lying spirit, as
that I defile whatsoever I have hand in, and can tell no truth but to the end
to beguile.

Let the premises and other his writings be pondered, which are not scant in
his letters, and I do not doubt but that my reioynders will seem as temperate
and respective, as reason, duty, and priestlie mildnes did bind me unto. To
end this point, I do not remember that ever I mentioned any Superior in my
letters to him, save only father Garnet, neither him in any reproachful or
contumelious manner: which makes me the more to muse, with what liberty of
pen and conscience his Reverence could pretend and diuulge the taking away of
my faculties to be for writing letters unto him full of contention, or
calumniation against other Superiors; when I never touched in my said letters
but one only, and him after no unseemly manner, his approbation of father
Listers treatise, and the nature of his own assertions considered, which were
very false, injurious, and shamelessly detractiue against me in particular, as
the specialties of the Appeal do testify.

The fourth cause that our Archpriest gives for depriving me of my faculties,
is, for that even at the instant when he took them from me, I attempted many
things against peace. This he says, but does not specify wherein, nor would
his Reverence, when after I wrote unto him to know the particulars, answer me
a word. The truth was, that understanding our intention to appeal from him,
and thinking Master Mush and my self to be two of the chiefest in the action,
he knew no means how better to take his peniworths of us beforehand, then to
disfurnish us of our faculties. And to cloak the revenge, his Reverence
devised the foresaid four causes, with a coople etceteraes, as loope holes to
let in, what he, or his friends could afterward epsy out, of more truth or
moment against us. But let our encountering of father Listers paradoxe, and our
withstanding the imputation of enormous disobedience, be exempted (which
conscience and bounden respect of our good names tied us unto) and the whole
world can not give an instance, wherein we hindered the making of peace: nay we
above any others labored and pressed the chief means of establishing true
peace, as the discourse of the next Reason will demonstrate.

It appears by that little which is said in answer to the reasons of our
Archpriest, that there was neither need nor necessity, nor any just cause
occurring, why he should bereave us of our faculties, especially before
summons, and conviction of the fault. To say, our misdemeanors were notorious,
and therefore no need of citing or trial before the inflicting of the
punishment, is too bare a refuge, and over common, nor other, then may be
alleged in the wrongfullest accusation that can be imagined. The Canonists
Anto. fran. in ca. ad extirpandas de fill. presby. in lib. a. sub no. 4. Gloss.
in ca. ad nostram de emp. and rend. Speculat. li. 3. de notor. crim. 1. nu. 9.
teach, Quod licet notori^m non sit de necessitate probandum, tamen debet
prob^ri illud esse notorium, That although there be no necessity to prove that
which is notorious or public, yet there ought proof to be made that the same
is notorious. Which our Archpriest has not yet done, nor can ever be able to
do by all the conjoined forces of the adverse part. For that is Gloss. in ca.
v^stra de cehabi. cler. verb. notorium, and ca. tua, and ca. quaesitum cod. tit.
notorious in this case, quod ita exhibet se conspectu heminum quod nulla
potest tergiuersatione celari, which so exhibiteth it self to the eye or
understanding of all men, as that it can not be hid or excused by any color,
or tergiuersation soever: Or as In ca. vestra de cohab. cler. nu. 14.
Panormitane, and In 2. q. 1. ca. de manifesta.
Archidiaconus describe, a notorious fact or crime, cuius testis populus est,
and dissimulationi locus non est, whose witness is the people, and can not be
dissembled. But the two first offenses for which our faculties were taken away,
that is, for defending of our cause, and demanding satisfaction, do so little
offer themselves to the understanding of most men in the nature and liuerey of
notorious faults, as they hold the actions for most lawful: and the latter
two, viz. the writing of contumelious or calumnious letters, and my frequent
deuisings against peace, how can they be notorious and manifest to others, or
not admit denial or dissimulation, when my self who should best know, as
being most inward to mine own action and intention, can by no examination of
my conscience (holden neither for the dullest, nor the blindest) recount any
such transgression?

It is a general rule, without exception among the learned in the law A^to.

inflicted, without summoning the offender before, for a fault that is not
public or notorious, the process or penalty does not bind. Sententia lata
contra non ^^tatum, nulla est, nisi in facto notorio: A sentence (as writes
Verb. citatio nu. 5.
Siluester) given without citing the delinquent before in a fact that is not
notorious, is void, and of no effect. And Panormitane writes, In ca. vestra de
coha. cleri. nu. 18.
Quandoque potest competere aliqua defensio, quod est quasi regulare, and tunc
requiritur citatio, alias sententia non valebit: Sometime in facts that are
notorious, there may be place of defense, which is very common, and then
citation is so requisite, as without it the sentence is of no validity.

By which places and others before quoted it is very plain, that our
Archpriest did not only exceed the bounds of the Constitutiue Letter, in the
manner of taking away our faculties, but that he did also break the laws
Clem. ca. pastoralis de re iudica.
of Nature, and holy Church in such his enterprise, and the fact nevertheless
of no obligation: which may also be confirmed by other arguments.

There is nothing less doubtful either in the 12. q. 5. c. 1. and ca. 1. de
causa poss. and prop. and tit. vt lite non contesta. per totum.
Canon, or L. fi. c. si per vim sieve alio modo l. 2.
Civil law, then that no one can be deprived of the thing he possesses,
without judicial examination, and trial of the cause. Which without question
holds also true, as In ca. accepta de rest. spo. solut. oppositionis octauae
nu. 18. and 19. Pagi. 223.
Nauar writes, in ecclesiastical rights. So that the possession and use of
our faculties being unto us in steed of benefices, and in a sort, couenanted
for, and deserved, as it has bin before showed; it follows directly upon
the same reason, that we cannot lawfully be dispossessed of our faculties
before we be heard, and judicial examination had of the offense for which they
are to be taken away. But of that, which may not lawfully be done, there can be
no need or necessity, which are the limits and direction, when our
Archpriest may take away faculties, as appears by the Cardinals letter;
therefore this not observed but exceeded, D. Tho. 22. q. 60. art. 2. and 6.
Ricardus in 4. did. 18. art. 4. q. 4. Page 25.
his fact therein may easily be mortal sin to himself, but never of any
effect in us, because if he go beyond his commission, he goes beyond his
jurisdiction, and going beyond his jurisdiction, his fact is of no force, nor
obligation, but absolutely void in it self, as the fourth and fifth
propositions teach.

Again, the Divines and Canonists agree, that regular or religious Priests,
being once allowed by the Bishop to hear confessions, cannot again be
imbarred thereof, but Henriques li. 3. de poeni. ca. 6. nu. 6. Benedict 11. in
Extrauag. inter cunctas Pius 5. prop. mot. pro mendic. Sotus did. 18. q 4.
art. 3. Siluest. verb. confess. 2. nu. 11.
causa cognita and probata, upon examination and proof of the cause pretended.
Much more then, the priests in England, being sent with like danger of life
into our country, and having no other means of procuring harbor or
maintenance, then by use of their faculties, nor any way enabled, so much to
reclaim or profit others, as by exercise of that function, should not, nor
cannot by any law or rules of conscience (and the more for that also, the
loss of their faculties is a defamation unto them) be deprived of their
faculties, but upon judicial examination and trial of the cause, and crime
objected.

Hence, as by other perticulars, the injustice and oppression of our
Archpriest appear great in dispossessing us of our faculties, only upon the
bare naming of a cause, without citation or proof of the cause alleged, a
course contrary to law, divine, and ecclesiastical, and contrary to the
form of all practice in the christian world. Which measure also becomes the
more ouer-running in extremity and injustice toward us, in that his
Reverence, notwithstanding the long want of our faculties, would not restore us
to our former state upon the order, and commandment of his Holiness Nuncio in
Flanders, to whom himself assigned me in his dimissories, as to the Judge of
my appellation; a more direct, and less justifiable kind of disobedience by
many degrees, then we can be charged with, notwithstanding the condemnation and
outcryes that have bin made and continued for a long space most violently
against us. The words of the Nuncio his letter unto him, belonging to this
point, were these: Eo casu mittendi aliqui erunt, sufficienti procuratorio and
authoritate, ad ea quae hanc in rem necessaria erunt peragenda instructi (si
profectionem rations and negotia admodum Rd^ D. V. incumbentia non admittant)
interim eam monitam and rogatam cupimus, vt interea temporis omnia in antiquum
statum reponentur. To the end that all matters may be examined and discussed
before the Priests that are come from England, go forwards in their journey to
Rome, some are to be sent with sufficient information and authority for
accomplishing the things that are hereunto necessary, if your Reuerences charge
and affairs may not suffer your personal repair unto me: in the mean
season, whiles these matters be a treating, we admonish and will you to set all
things in their old state.

Some week or more after I had sent the Nuncio his letter unto our
Archpriest, and receiving no answer from him, I addressed the Letter
following.

Very Reverend Sir:
I Sent you some few days past a Letter from his Holiness Nuncio in Flanders,
with a copy of an other of his to the Priests of our Country in general. I
doubt not but that you have received them; and receiving them, not I alone, but
other also of my brethren do marvel (the contents and the solemnity of the
feast considered) that we have not as yet heard from you. By reason of which
delay, these are very earnestly to beseech you to advertise us, whether you
determine to restore us to our former state, as his Honor in the said Letter
directed and willed you to do. Which due of justice we expect the more to
receive at your hands, in regard the thing his Grace 3. q. 1. in multis ca. and
eadem, q. 2. ca. Oportet and ca. Si Episcopus.
enioyneth you is none other then what the Canons of holy Church not
vnstrictly command, the use of our faculties being unto us in lieu of
Ecclesiastical livings, and the means of our maintenance. Let us therefore
(we again beseech you good Sir) understand your full mind in the point, and
receive notice of the time you assign, for the appearance of some of the
Appellants before the Nuncio, there both to answer to that your self or your
Procuratours shall object, and to prove the auowances in the Appeal, and other
iniustices received: that so his Lordship hearing both parties face to face,
may the more maturely judge, and relate to his Holiness at full (to whom other
of our associates in the action are gone) the beginning, process, and true
causes of the whole dissension between us. Your Reverence has often affirmed
(and in that you have published the same, our adversaries make it an assured
ground of diffidence or despair in our cause) that your Proctours in Flanders
and at Rome have long expected, attending our coming, which how true soever it
may happen to fall out at Rome, yet we are very sure, that the truth was
otherwise in Flanders. For our brethren coming thither, neither found nor
could understand of any such Proctours, and less so amply furnished as your
In which among other things these words were written, Illic pro nostra
defe^sione extabunt vari^ Ill^ Cardinalium literae: illic prodibit Breu^
Apostolicum: illic patebunt omnes occultae vestrae machinationes contra pacem:
illic circa literas meas, fallaciarum vestrarum omnem caliginem discuss^m
videbitis: illic calumni^ vestrae, and s^ditiosae vestrae literae proferentur,
and rerum omnium vestrarum opertarum fiet vobis iniucunda patefactio. There,
for our defense shall diverse letters of most Illustrious Cardinals appear:
there shall come forth the Apostolical Breue: there shall all your
machinations against peace be laid open: there shall ye see all the darkness of
your crafty devises about my letters put away and disparkled: there shall your
calumniations, and your seditious letters be brought forth, and an unpleasant
discovery shall be made of all your hidden matters. 20. of December. 1600.
dimissories reported; yea, and which takes away all color of doubt that may
be made hereof, the Nuncio himself in the Letter I sent you, wrote unto you to
send over (if your other affairs should not license your personal repair)
some with full instruction from you to relate and negotiate the difference: a
travel and charge which his wisdom would never without doubt have put you
too, had your Proctours bin there attending, or so much as showed them selves
before his Grace, during the time of our brethrens being with him. And that
your Proctours at Rome expect our coming thither, is an affirmation that
likewise claims in our conceit no great belief, because father Parsons (the
only man by all likelihood who must provide and inform them) has labored
both the Popes holiness and Cardinal Fernesius our Protector, utterly to
forbid our coming to Rome in the cause, and has further solicited as well the
Nuncio in Paris, as the Nuncio in Flanders, to dehort (for I will not say to
stay, though that were the word that the party used who sent the intelligence)
our brethren at their coming by them, from going onwards to his Holiness.

No more, but God give us all in our words and deeds to use the sincerity it
becomes, and then no doubt the controversy will soon take a sound and a
lasting end. Fare you well, with remembrance of duty. The feast of the
Innocents. 1601.

Your Reuerences, I. Colleton.

Our Archpriest notwithstanding this my Letter and earnest request, did not so
much as return one word in answer either by letter or message, albeit I sent
twice or thrice for his answer. Now to conclude this our fourth Reason, we
hope the premises have sufficiently showed, that the authority which our
Archpriest possesses, being very ample in it self, and infinitely more ample
in the practice, makes him a superior Prelate, and consequently his Reverence
contained under the Extrauagant Iniunctae before mentioned. And if so, as the
largeness of his authority and the scope of his Jurisdiction reaching over
England and Scotland, cannot but conclude him under the same: then all the
power, wit, and learning of the adverse part can never prove us to be in the
least point disobedient, either unto his Holiness, the Cardinal Protector, or
to Master Blackwell, because the said Extrauagant commands, and enacteth
under a heavy penalty, not to admit any Superior Prelate promoted by the sea
Apostolic to the dignity he is chosen to, without he first show the letters
of the same Sea for proof of the preferment. Of which kind, we are right sure
the Cardinals letter neither was, nor could be. Yea, to affirm a Cardinals
Protectors letter, either patent or sealed up to be an Apostolical letter,
were gross error, and perhaps heretical also, if ignorance do not excuse. For
such letters only are called Apostolical, and understood in the Extrauagant,
quae Bulla sunt munitae, whose seals carry the print or purtrait of a Bull, as
In ca. accepta de rest. spol. solut. opposite. 8. nu. 23.
Nauar, In reg. de non iudi. iuxt. form. q. 1.
Gomesius, and Gloss. regulae Cancel. 69.
others write, and the text of Ca. licet and ca. quam graui de crimi. falls.
the law seems to import. Neither can our adversaries wind themselves out
of the straites they are in, by saying that Master Blackwell was not promoted
by the Sea Apostolic, but by the Cardinal Protector. For let this be so, yet
what follows, when the Extrauagant does extend it self, as well to those
that have their confirmation from the Sea Apostolic, aut confirmationis munus
recipient, as to those that are immediately preferred by the same sea: and none
can deny, but that our Archpriest had the confirmation of his office and
dignity from the Pope? If then, the authorities and reasons afore-going do
convince, that we were not bound to receive Master Blackwell to the office
upon the sole view of the Cardinals letter, it follows, that no bond being,
no sin could be, because sin is always the breach of some bond; and if no
sin, no disobedience: if no disobedience, D. Th. 12. q. 71. art. 6.
no rebellion: if no rebellion, no schism: and if no schism, no
excommunication, no irregularitie, nor loss of faculties. And if none of all
these, then what wrongs, what oppressions, what ignominies, and those also most
grievous and slanderous, have father Lister, father Garnet, father Holtby, and
our Archpriest with their adherents, heaped in prodigallest measure upon us,
and on the necks of our ghostly children: and have not only hereby most
despituously massacred our good names, but also raised sociall contention,
turmoyled the inward repose of thousands, and set that on fire, which will
hardly be quenched this twice ten years as we fear. Our blessed Lord
forgive them, and grant us grace to redeem our sins, by remitting their
manifold trespasses done against us.

The fifth Reason.
THE fifth and last Reason of justifying our delay, was, that admitting there
had bin no surreption used in the information to his Holiness, or the Cardinal,
and that the Cardinal had received an express commandment from his Holiness,
to erect this particular jurisdiction by name, and that his Grace had also
signified the same in plain terms in the Constutitiue Letter; and that we
stood obliged to believe and rest upon the Cardinals word in so prejudicial a
matter; and finally, that the Extrauagant Iniunctae, did not as the same was
either set forth by Bonifacius the eight, or as it has bin since enlarged by
In constitutione quae incipit cum a nobis.
Paulus the third, In constable. quae incipit Romani Pontificis.
Julius the second, and In constable. quae incip. sanctissimus.
Julius the third, inuolue, or concern the promotion and office of Master
Blackwell, as how little true all these things are, the former reasons have
sufficiently declared: yea we took the hard conceit and indignation which our
Prince and the State carry against Father Parsons, (whom they reputed to be the
chief deviser of the subordination, and to have the whole ruling thereof) as a
just excuse of not admitting the authority, especially at the first appearance
thereof, upon the bare sight of the Cardinals letter, directed also to no more
then one. And the grounds why we took this to be a reasonable cause of
justifying our bearing off, were these that follow.

First, because the Magistrates have in their hands, and de facto have showed
to some prisoners at the time of their examinations for proof, and to
exaggerate the disloyalties and treasons objected, one, or mo letters which
they affirm to be father Parsons, wherein his concurrance and furtherance to
an invasion were expressed: then the man's restless tampering in State matters,
being reported to have proffered, and reprofered the Crown of our Country to
several Princes, now to one, now to another, as the meeting of matters and
oportunities could most recommend and credit his words, and entertain the
personage with hope thereof: thirdly, the incessant solicitation, which the
Magistrate protests, that he has used with foreign Potentates, and the
attempts, which, as the same Magistrate affirms, have thereon ensued for a
conquest of our country. So as the Magistrate understanding (as common fame
could not but bring it to his hearing) that the subordination was the work of
father Parsons, our fear was, least the politic State would deem us
coadiutors and creatures combined with him, if we had admitted the
Subordination upon no greater compulsion, then the Protectors letter, and
consequently, that we were persons who did deserve to be abandoned, and to have
the extremity of the laws prosecuted against us. Could we therefore in common
reason do less, matters standing in these terms, then defer our acceptance
of the authority, until his Holiness had commanded us by Bull, Breue, or
other papal instrument, or verbal message, to subject our selves thereunto;
that so the State might see, our receiving of the Subordination not to be for
any liking we carried toward father Parsons proceedings, but for obedience only
toward the Sea Apostolic, and in a matter wherein the obseruances of our
religion bound us, and the same not justly prejudicial to the temporal
state? Verily we took this for so reasonable and just a cause, as we could not
but stand thereupon, unless we would in our own understanding have showed our
selves cruel to our own innocence; of ill deserts toward the Magistrate, in
not removing his wrong suspicion of us when and how we might; ungrateful to
our benefactors; unmindful of our own lives; betrayers of the cause we
profess; enemies to the professors thereof; and injurious to the honor of
Priesthood: for that all these (her Majesty and the State not reading in our
actions, that we were true dislikers of all and singular his disloyal
practices and platformes) were like to receive increase of affliction and
blemish, by our admittance of the jurisdiction, before such time as his Holiness
had confirmed the same, and thereby through the virtue of his supreme
authority, freed both it and us, from having part in father Parsons
intentions, so far as they were any whit disloyal.

Neither is father Parsons holden only of our Magistrate for a Statist, or
marchandizer of the Crown and Diadem, though this were enough to estrange and
deforce us from having any connection, or partaking in ought with him: but his
travels and negotiations this way are become so notoriously known, that even
Pasquine in Rome (as intelligence is sent us) speaks in this manner of him:

If there be any man that will buy the Kingdom of England, Let him repair to
a Merchant in a black square Cappe in the City, and he shall have a very good
pennyworth thereof. Touching the proper nature of our delaie upon the foresaid
cause, we think, that the same will not only appear just and reasonable
before any Tribunal upon earth to our full excuse, but that it will be found
of that quality in the day of judgment, when Psalm. 5. Sophon. 1.
Justice will be judged, and Jerusalem searched with a candle. For what human
cause can be thought just or reasonable, if not the precedent, branching into
so many several and weighty consequences, as the premises deliver, and
reason makes manifest, if circumstances of time, place, and persons (the
direction of a wise man's aim) be vprightlie considered? And if the cause were
either in truth, or in semblance just, we mean, either just in it self, or so
taken in good faith by us, then our prolonging to subject our selves (supposing
the Cardinals letter had bin a binding precept unto us) was either no sin at
all, or not greater then a venial. No sin, if the cause were reallie just,
as witnesses Ca. si quando de rescript.

commandments of inferior prelates, but holds likewise true in the precepts

best writers do testify. Ca. si qua^do de rescript.

any thing (says Pope Alexander to the Archbishop of Rauenna) that may seem to
stir your mind, you ought not to be troubled therewith, but after diligent
consideration had of the nature of the business, either reverently to
accomplish our commandment, or yield a reasonable cause why you may not
fulfill it. And In ca. si quando de rescript. nu. 1.
Ioannes Andreas writes, Is ad quem rescriptum Papae dirigitur, debet illi
parere, aut iustam causam ostendere, quare non paret. He, to whom the Popes
rescript is directed, ought to obey it, or assign a cause why he does not obey
it. The same Ibidem nu. 1.
has Felinus; and In ca. cum teneamur de praebend. in apostillis ad Innocent.
Baldus writes further, Quod si in literis Papae dicatur districte
praecipuendo mandamus, tamen potest supersederi ex causa iusta: That if the
Pope do strictly command such a thing to be done, nevertheless the same may
be omitted upon a just cause. Likewise the Gloss affirms, In ca. cum
teneamur de praebend.
Quod ^portet mandatum domini Papae, adimplere nisi subsit causa non
adimplendi, That we ought to fulfill the commandment of the Pope, except
there be a cause of not fulfilling it. Also Graffius writes, alleging Saint
Thomas and Panormitane for proof of the position, P. 1. li. 2. ca. 36. nu. 15.
and 16.
Quod in omni praecepto legis positiuae, admittitur exceptio causa
rationabil^^: That in every precept of a positive law, the exception of a
reasonable cause is admitted. And the reason hereof is, because the laws of
the Church, or commandments of Superiors are not secundum se in their own
natures of the necessity of salvation (as are the precepts of God, D. Thomas
22. q. 147. art. 4. ad. 1. See the 7. 8. and 12. propositious page 27. See also
page 47.
being the precepts of the law of nature) but only by the institution of the
Church, or decree of the Superior, and therefore some causes or obstacles may
occur, whereby a party may not be bound to the observance of them. By all
which it appears, with how little judgment, or rather with what ignorance,
and childish reasoning, father Parsons in the tenth leaf of the Appendix
inueyeth, and infers against us, for affirming, that one may upon a
reasonable cause defer to fulfill the commandment of the Superior.

NOw for the more perspicuitie of all that has bin hitherto said, it seems
necessary, that we put down the whole race of the controversy, and what
offers of atonement we have made from time to time, that so the reader may see
whetherside has more inclined to peace, and sued for it. And to show this,
from the beginning of the difference, and how desirous we ever were to give
satisfaction to all parties who were scrupulouslie grieved at the manner of our
proceedings, chiefly of mine, on whom most blame was laid: I will here set
down two Letters for testifying of such our willingness, the one written to
father Garnet, the other to an earnest lay-fauorite, and patron of the adverse
part.

Very Reverend Sir:
Unwillingness to show my self either too quick in taking, or ouer-tender in
brooking injuries, has hitherto not a little (as to me seems) staid both
tongue and pen from due questioning and complaining; and would have done longer,
but that reports are now grown to the like head, as even fear of offending
through too great neglect of my good name, necessarily enforces a more
respectfull consideration upon me. My own ears have bin witness (good Sir) and
my friends every where give me to understand, how sinisterly I am talked of,
for wronging (that I use but one, and no harder a term, albeit many and much
harder be spread of me) the fathers of the Society. These are therefore to
beseech you, and in all right of charity to entreat the receiving of so much
favor, or rather not the undue tribute of justice from you, as to acquaint me
with those particulars, wherein I have reproueablie, either to your own
knowledge, or by such information as will be stood unto, miscarried my self in
word, deed, or demeanor against your self, or any of your society. I expect
my full charge, and do no way desire you to leave any point untouched, or not
amplified to the most, whereof you hold me culpable. Adding, that the plainer
you deal with me herein, the better cause I have to like you. Aduertising
besides, that for saving some of your friends credit so far as the delivery
of like untruths do discredit, it imports to allege the most you can against
me. If my leave be desired as no need, I yield it franckly, because I would
not willingly dwell in ignorance of my sins, nor omit satisfaction where I am
bound to make it. Thus in brief you have my request, and see the motives, I
pray afford me the performance with the soonest. Fare you well with very good
will, though the course (if with your priuitie) followed against me, shows
little good will. November 5. 1598.

By him whom plainness in the premises makes more yours: I. Colleton.

SIr, I perceive by the continuance of your hard speeches against me, uttered
even where they may work me most hurt, that there will be no end of the evil,
unless some means be taken that both you may urge whatsoever you can object
against me, and I on the other side, have leave and hearing to make my answers.
To which intent, I offer by these, to come where and when you shall appoint,
and do further beseech you, that you would have such present, as you think can
speak most, and best prove your and their accusations against me. I shall come
alone, only with the testimony of my own conscience; you may take to your
self as many as you shall think good: and if you and they shall justly prove
me to be faulty, in that I go charged withal, I will forthwith, God willing,
both ask you pardon, and be ready to make any satisfaction that shall be
thought fit. In the mean, it were good we remembered what the holy Ghost
writes, The abomination of men is the detractor. By which words, the wisdom
of heaven seems to affirm, that of all ill qualities which make men
hateful, and their company to be abandoned, the vice of detraction is the
first. Surely if the mouth speaks from the abundance of the heart, then what
suds must lodge in the heart of him, that depraueth the good name of another,
and incomparably more in his, who calumniouslie accuses his spiritual
father? For such a one the laws of holy Church reckon for an infamous person.
No more but what I write to you, the same I mean to your son Master N. Fare
you well the 28. of January.

Yours howsoever you repute of me, John Colleton.

TO the latter of these Letters I received no answer at all; and of the former
I received the answer that follows, which I thought good to set down
verbatim, both to the end that others might see wherewith I was charged, and
how I cleared my self: but chiefly because my reply could not be well
understood without the adioining of his answer, and for that some parts of my
reioinder did most evidently protest our readiness, of admitting Master
Blackwels authority, upon notice of the first canonical certitude that should
appear thereof, and consequently in all truth of learning, freed us of father
Listers calumniation imposed, and likewise convinced the author and approuers
of the same, either of very bold ignorance, or of unworthiest demeanure against
us, they having the said reply of mine almost three months, if not full out,
in their hands, before the setting forth of that proud and slanderous
treatise, the only soul and life of the whole contention.

My very reverend Sir:
IF you be sinisterlie talked of for wronging our Society: blame not Father
Garnets answer.
him (I beseech you) who, for all your strangenes ceasseth not to love you: and
whom, for your hurtful proceedings, love inforceth to pity you.

It has bin always my desire, since that we purged our selves (I hope
sufficiently) from the malicious slanders of some impudent libellers, that all
things should (as much as is possible) be utterly forgotten: and if all could
not be induced to love and affect us, to bear their auersion with patience and
silence, without following any course or pursuit against them: so, that if you
hear either your self, or by any others, any sinister reports against you,
you may examine them best, whether they be true, and the reporters are to give
account on what ground they utter them.

True it is, that as it has pleased God to give our Society part in many
glorious labors which in his holy Church are continually achieved: so also
very often times, yea ordinarily, does he make us Note the matter of this our
blame.
partakers of the afflictions and difficulties which do thence arise: and if
any worthy thing be accounted worthy of blame, we are lightly the first
which are blamed.

It has pleased his Holiness of late to ordain a certain government among
us. It has bin received with singular liking of the most and best. God forbid,
but that I and all my brethren, should have bin most ready to run whither
charity and obedience did call us, least by disobedience we should contemn
our Superior, or by schism and division be cut off from the head.

Some have refused to acknowledge this head, much more to obey him. Their
pretenses are in every ones mouth that have heard of this authority: It is a
thing devised by the Jesuits: The Superior is one of their own choosing: Why
should the Jesuits appoint us a Superior, more then we a General unto them?
It is the fine head of father Parsons that has invented this: He has given
wrong information to the Cardinal and his Holiness: The Cardinal was always
partial on the Jesuits side: Some of necessity must be sent to inform
better: The messengers must procure that some assistants be chosen, who may not
be thought to be partiallie affected to the Jesuits: They must propound, to
have the government of the College enlarged, as being ouer-straite, or
indiscreete for our nation: Yea they must make suite that the Jesuits be
removed from the government of all Seminaries of our nation: And touching the
mission of England in particular, all the Jesuits must needs be called away.

These and the like speeches having bin uttered by such, as either gathered
voices for another government, or are known not to favor this: what can it
argue else, but that such oppose themselves against the Society, as if no
authority were to be liked, but which may beat down the Jesuits, or set
them and other Reverend Priests together by the ears? And verily, the success
of matters since the authority of the Reverend Archpriest was diuulged, does
make many to fear, least the secret intention (yet not perceived of all) of
these which were the principal seekers, to erect a sodalitie, or other
superiority and subordination, was either ambitious, or seditious. For having
now that very thing which they sought for (although imposed on other persons
then they had designed) to reprehend and impugn the same, must needs make men
suspect, that they do it, either because they themselves are not chosen, or
because such were not chosen as might deal peremptorily with those which they
ought to tender. Both which affections, shows them doubly unworthy of
government. For what is so unfit for honor, as ambition? And what have we done,
that all should not affect us? Yea by Gods great goodness so it is (as we
think) that if any affect us not, the fault is in them, and not in us. So that
if they would have themselves, or others that do not affect us (though
otherwise seeming never so virtuous) to be chosen heads, let them first affect
us (so far as in virtue they ought) that they may be worthy of government.

Then you see (good Sir) it wants not probability, that if any give out that
you wrong us, it is because you are thought to draw back from your
Arch-presbyter, which you know whether it be so or no. And although I verily
persuade my self, that most of those speeches never proceeded from your mouth,
yet those that will be part of a discontented company, of force must be
contented to bear the reproach of many things which are done or said amiss by
a few, it being impossible that all men should distinguish, and apply every
particular to the true author. And verily, as it grieueth me oftentimes to
hear, and I reprehend it so often as I hear it spoken, that such a one, or
such another who is not joined to the Archpresbyter, is condemned, as opposite
to the Society: and condemn such manner of speech for a fallacy, which we
call as you know non causae vt causae: for in very deed, I would not have them
reprehended because they are opposite against us, but because they acknowledge
not their lawful Superior: so on the other side must I needs acknowledge
that it is, and by Gods grace will I always procure, that it shall always
continue: that those two things are so annexed one to the other, that whosoever
is opposite against our reverend Archpresbyter, must of force be consequently
opposite against us. And therein will we gloriari in Domino, if any be thought
opposite to us, who are opposite unto him. Therefore (good Sir) there is
nothing I more desire, there is nothing can be more honorable and profitable
for your self, then that you unite your self unto him, whom God has made
your Superior: who like unto him which is Princeps Pastorum, is in this our
particular church lapis qui factus est, non in offensionem, sed in caput
anguli, qui medium parietem maceriae soluat, qui faciat vtraque vnum: is the
only means to join us all together in perfect love and union, which we had
long since enjoyed, if his authority had bin admitted, as at this present
there is no hinderance at all of unity, but the refusing of the same. So that
we find true that which is most worthily said by Saint Paul, Non tenens
caput ex quo totum corpus per nexus and coniunctiones subministratum and
constructum crescit in augmentum Dei. And the cause of this refusing the head
he expressed before: frustra inflatus sensu carnis suae. With this head
therefore must I hold, to him must I be united, to him must we cleave. Qui ille
coniungitur meus est: qui cum illo non colligit spargit. And vnfaignedlie I
affirm unto you, that I continually pray in particular for your union unto
him, in respect of the love I have borne and do bear unto you: which shall not
decay, although you would with never so great contrariety of judgments and
opinions. And thus wishing you to follow that which is most to the glory of
God and your own souls health, I cease. 11. November. 1598.

Your plain friend, as you wished Henry Ga.

Very reverend Sir:
PErusing your Letter, I find little to the purpose, wherein I entreated your
answer. My desire was, to be advertised of all such wrongs, as either in your
own knowledge, or by auowable information, I had committed against the
Society: and you altogether leaving this point, amplify another matter.
Nevertheless, since you have taken pains to write, what better pleased you
then to satisfy my request, I shall not let for eauening your labor, to
return you also my opinion of that you have written.

Touching my strangeness, I pray consider, whether I can not with greater
reason except the same against you, then you against me. For you know the way
to me, I know not where to come to you: and while I did know, I was (as I
verily think) oftener then ten times with you for your once being with me.
Besides, in my knowledge, there was never any cause offered, why you should
estrange your self, and more then one given me, that might justly dissuade my
repair to you, as namely, when out of good will upon advertisement I told the
elder Gentlewoman of the safe shipping of her maide-seruant, she refused to
take notice, making a like strange of my speeches, as if I had bin a person
justly to be mistrusted, or not to be trusted with so small a secret. Again,
one of those that belong unto you, and who was very well and long weeting to my
free access in former time unto you, made pretty shifts in dissembling the
house and quarter where you abide. Both which in common reason, did, and must
bid me doubt, least wonted good will or trust, or both, be decayed in you and
in them toward me. If you shall say, that you have sent for me once or twice,
my being in Physic at those times (as the messenger could inform from his
eye) sufficiently excuses my fail: and verily since my better health, I have
several times wished for a guide to conduct me unto you, so little I did
affect to estrange my self, notwithstanding the utter show, or
counterpleadings of the aforesaid discurtesies. Master Blackwell in his last
speech with me, said, the Fathers of the Society had many exceptions against
me, which was one principal cause, why I wrote unto you in the tenor I did,
but now if strangeness be all, and the same no more deseruingly objected, I
see well a little can soon and easily be made much against me.

You say, Love inforceth you to pity me for my hurtful proceedings. Good
sir, in my judgment you should have showed as much love, and certes, love
better qualited, if it had stood with your good liking to have forborne alike
hardly to mis-censure my proceedings. I wot not of what hurt my proceedings
may be made the occasion, because the frailty of man may make what is perfect
good, to serve to shadow that which is ill. But how my proceedings may be the
cause of hurt, which requiring an intention, does make them truly hurtful, and
so denominate: this I see not, because I do not espy in my self any such
intent and meaning. And if you say my proceedings be of that quality in their
nature, you say more then I hope you shall be able to prove, and until you
prove them so, why may not my nay persuade as much as your yea, or more, in
regard you cannot be so privy to my actions, their circumstances, and my
intent, as my self.

Such as sinisterlie report of me* are (by the auowance of your own assertion)
to give account on what ground they uttered their reports. Father Jones
reported and affirms the same in his Letter to me, that I should call your
kind of governing the English College in Rome a Macheuilian government, or
worse. And when by letter I wished him either to prove that I spoke the words,
or disprove himself for doing me the injury, he returned answer: if I did
purge my self of Fishers confession, I should satisfy him. Verily as I wot
not what the father meant by this kind of reply, so the probablest meaning
that may be directly gathered of his words seems to be, that Fisher has
appeached me of such plentiful and bad matter against your Society, as until
I clear my self thereof, the good man cannot hold himself satisfied, and in
the interim my good name forsooth to be so deeply wounded, and publicly
depraved, as licenseth him to report as he did, or what he lists further of
me. My request is the performance of your own grant, that he give an account
on what ground he uttered the report, and if so any detractio^ be found in me,
I yield my self to fullest satisfaction: if in him, I dema^d my right. And
because this sore spreads in time like a canker by sufferance, the sooner
satisfaction be made, the better. But here I cannot but greatly marvel, with
what show of charitable dealing Fa. Jones or any of the Society can vpbraid me
with Fishers confession, whom your selves call (as I understand your letter) a
malicicus slanderer, and an impudent libeller. If you say the man is sithence
altered, I hope you have better proof thereof, and I desire to know it, then
that speaking to my reproof, he must make no lie, and no fault at all to
diuulge, or object the same against me: and in speaking to yours, he must tell
no truth, and a crime to repeat it, or once to think it of you. Your fortune
is good, my favor little; nevertheless, if conjectures upon likelihood of
circumstances may persuade ought, they plead for me against the assumption.
For what can carry more probability, then that he, who being at liberty,
free and out of fear, could and did dispense with his conscience for
slandering a meany, and such a meany as your selves be, who have so mighty
partners every where, would in his restraint, in the height of his distresses,
and for sooner ridding himself out of trouble, make scruple perdy, to wrong or
calumniate such a mean one as my self is, so far off also, and without all
acquaintance in that place? Again, whatsoever it be that he accuses me of, as
what it is I cannot imagine, he must needs take the same from the mouth of
another, or borrow it from his own invention: because he never knew me, nor I
him, or ever had conference each with other, by messenger, word, letter, or
otherwise. Nevertheless, since Fa. Jones lays his confession to my charge in
the discurteous manner he does, I must needs think (or hold the Father very
inconsiderate) that there is some surer proof for the verity of that I stand
accused of, then the only presumption of Fishers bare confession. Or if there
be not, as I request all that may be brought, to be brought against me, the
measure is very hard which is offered, in that his sole word must be a current
truth against me, whom your selves condemn, and are bound thereunto, under
loss of much credit, for a very dishonest, malicious, and lying person.

You affirm, that his Holiness of late has ordained a certain government
among us, and that Master Blackwell is our lawful Superior made by God. Good
sir, if you love not our errors, or more, if you love peace, Note these well.
prove your affirmations, and you end the difference. For undoubtedly our
souls bear witness that you are faultilie mistaken, if you take us for such,
that will neither obey what our holy Father the Pope appoints, or what God
himself ordains. Believe me I beseech you, that the reason why we delay in
the manner we do, to subject our selves to the new authority, is not because
we are in vain puffed up by the sense of the flesh, as you wrongfullie
insinuate: but because we neither see, nor can hear of any Bull, Breue, or
other authentical instrument, coming from his Holiness, for attestation and
declaration thereof. Which form of process, being ever the customarie use of
the Sea Apostolic, even in matters of much less moment, and incomparably of
lesser question, and failing in this, makes us greatly to misdoubt, or rather
puts us in undoubted assurance, that his Holiness was not the author thereof,
nor the appointer.

His holy Fatherhood well knows we have no Church-liuings, but live only of
alms, and that our miseries are in way of no other case, then the prison,
torture, and gallows, every miscreant having sufficient authority to
apprehend us: so that for his Holiness to increase the number of our pressures,
to make the burden of our crosses more heavy, not only by denying us the
choice of our own Superior, (a freedom and benefit which the Clergy every
where else, and by the Canons of holy Church enjoys) but by imposing also a
Superior upon us, without all our understanding, and not with the least notice
of our liking seems to our judgments to be a course of much greater
severity, then the mildnes of his Holiness nature, and the ripe wisdom of his
aged experience, would ever design, and less enact, and put in ure against
us. Further, his Holiness being for these forty years space our immediate
Bishop, how can we, without express certificate of such his Holiness pleasure,
admit another between his blessed Fatherhood and us, unless we would thereby
condemn our selves of want of love and duty toward his Holiness, and of
forgetfulness for several rich benefits received. They be in England who have
heard his Holiness to say, that he would not appoint a government in England
before (to use his own words) the good Priests there should advertise what
kind of government they thought fittest, and best liked. Therefore affirm what
you list, and tell your favorites, and the vulgar never so liberally, and
untruly to prattle of our misconceiued disobedience, yet we may not believe
the new authority to be the ordinance of that sea, having (by the record of
many) his Holiness own words to the contrary. There is an especial prouiso in
the Cardinals letter, that if it happen the Archpresbyter to dye, or be taken,
then the next senior assistant to supply that room, till there be another
chosen by the Cardinal. Verily if we had no other ground at all, but the
hardness of this prouiso, there were cause enough to assure our selves that his
Holiness had no part in the new authority. For who weeting to the abundance of
his fatherly love, care, and mild proceedings, can win his thoughts, or once
to fear, that his wisdom and rare clemency, would alike grieuouslie load
our miseries with so perpetual a burden, as neither first, nor last, nor at
any time to have the choosing of our own Superior, but must in all changes
stand to the appointment of a stranger, unacquainted with us and our State, and
who takes wholly his aduertisements or direction from others that are not of
our company, but incorporate to another body, and who more labor the glory
and advancement of their own peculiar as reason leads, then the good of
others, from whom they are by profession distinguished. Yea those that are the
Cardinals informers, and whom his Grace most willingly hears and follows,
are the chief parties of the one side in the difference, for ouerruling
whereof, the new authority was first thought on, solicited, and at unawares
brought upon us. Now the truth of the particular being thus, as every one sees
who is acquainted with the issue of matters, and will not close his eye, I
appeal even to the good opinion which your self holds of his holiness
disposition, indifferency, and justice, whether if he had bin the institutor
of this new authority, his wisdom and tender conscience would have permitted
the adding of so large a prerogative, or truer of so unequal a prouiso. I
think it an attribute of justice, if not a decree in nature, that the bond of
obedience ought evermore to bring some commodity with it: as the obedience of
the servant to his master receives wages: the obedience of the child to his
parent, the benefit of education: the obedience of the wife to her husband, her
maintenance and dowry: the obedience of the religious to his superior,
provision of all necessaries: the obedience of the Priest to his Bishop,
jurisdiction, and the appurtenances: the obedience of the subject to his
Sovereign, protection and the administration of justice: and generally
wheresoever obedience is due, there follows a correlatiue, I mean a good
depending which makes it due. You would have us to obey, and it is the scope
of all your travails. I pray name us the good that comes to us thereby, the
whole authority consisting only in the taking away of faculties, and in
distressing more our miseries? If the supposed authority had bin the action of
the Pope, no doubt his Holiness consideration for drawing men's obedience the
sooner thereunto, would have given to it some indulgence at least, if no
temporal or other kind of spiritual commodity. I shall be driven to touch
this point in mo places, being the directing cliffe to all, and therefore do
omit here to stay longer upon it, hoping what is already said to be sufficient.

You proceed to the reckning up of our pretenses, for so it phansieth your pen
to by-name the reasons following, as though all were false colors, and no
truth at all: and thus you repeat them, as objected by us.

1. It is a thing devised by the Jesuits.

I trust you will not make show to deny this, the truth being so clear as the
light of the Sun when it shines. And if you do, a number of conuincing
testimonies can be brought against you, and you by gainesaying so evident a
truth, will give us good cause to take heed, how far we believe you in
doubtful and unknown matters.

2. The Superior is one of the Jesuits own choosing.

This also we auerre for a certain truth, and auow further, that not only the
Superior* but all the assistants are likewise of your choosing, as Master
Blackwell himself, neither could nor did deem, nor seemed unwilling to
acknowledge. And what greater sovereignty would you seek to carry over us,
if you might have your wishes, being in the dignity of priesthood, and in the
labors for our country by many years our iuniors?

3. Why should the Jesuits appoint us a Superior, more then we a General to
them?

If the resemblance be not good, I pray show the difference that disproueth,
and the reasons why you may elect our Superior, and we not yours.

4. It is the fine head of Father Parsons that has invented this.

Omit the epitheton, I mean so far as it carries the nature of a quipping
word, and the residue we maintain, believing there is no one, who will not
wilfully blind himself, but sees so much. For what can be clearer if
particulars be compared, or what less denyable or more manifest, then that
whereof his own letters to Master Doctor Pearse, to Master Doctor
Worthington, and others bear witness infalliblie? Therefore good sir, where you
let not to affirm, that God has made Master Blackwell our Superior, you are
to prove, proving your assertion, that father Parsons act was Gods deed, and
what the one, the other did, which will be somewhat hard for you to do, in
respect of the indirect dealing which father Parsons used in sending over word
unto us, to desist from further proceeding to the choosing of a Superior, as
from a matter I wot not of what ill consequence, and he himself
notwithstanding to labor and effect it underhand, contrary to the purport of
his message and all our knowledges. The Cardinal addressed a letter (as you
know) to two reverend Priests while they were on the way to England, and in it
made special mention of two apostolical Breues, which his Holiness had then
newly set forth. The letter signed with his Graces seal, and subscribed with
his own hand, rehearsed the contents of both in manner following: Sua
Sanctitas Breue apostolicu^ edidit, Datum apud Sanctu^ Marcum sub anulo
Piscatoris, die decimo octauo huius mensis septembris praesentis anni 1597. quo
prohibet omnino, ne quis Anglicanae nationis, quoad illud Regnum ad religionis
Catholicae, ac sedis Apostolicae vnionem redierit, Doctoratus gradum in
theologia vel iure accipiat, nisi post cursum quatuor annorum expletum, alios
adhuc quatuor annos ad ea quae didicit perpolienda impendat, neque tunc etiam
nisi habeat suberioris Collegij in quo vltimo studuerit licentiam in scriptis,
cum Protectoris vel vices eius gerentis assensu, and qui secus fecerit, illum
poenam excommunicationis ipsi sedi Apostolicae reseruatae ipso facto incurrere:
neque praeterea gradum, quem accepit vllum esse omnino sed prorsus inualidum.
Edidit praeterea This Breue was never seen, for ought we ever heard.
sua Sanctitas aliud Breue exhortatorium, ac consolatorium ad Catholicos
Anglicanos pijssimum illud quidem, ac vere Apostolicum, quo eos ad constantiam
patientiam, longanimitatem, coeterasque virtutes hortatur praecipue vero
concordiam, pacem, ac vnionem, quae coeterarum omnium virtutum fundamenta sunt
atque vincula, eosque vitent, qui seditiones, ac diuisiones seminant. Good sir,
as I may be deceived, so perhaps I am, yet under correction I must think that
there may be framed out of these a dilemma, or forked argument, that makes
every way greatly for us. Either the reported Breues were set forth, or not set
forth. If set forth, then what should persuade, that his Holiness wisdom and
diligent regard, being alike circumspect and provident in making forth his
particular and special Briefes for ordering the precedents, would in enacting
this new authority (a much more jealous and contentious subject) forget, or
neglect, or refuse, to do the like or more? Shall we attribute to his sacred
fatherhood, prudence, vigilancie, and maturest consideration in small matters,
and take them from his Holiness in great? His Holiness possesses the Chair,
that has the promis of divine assistance. He is our holy Father, and
therefore retains care of continuing peace among us his children: as the
dignity requires, so his Holiness is full of charity, benignity, and
compassion, and therefore much unlike, especially while the Magistrate is in
drawing his sword against us, that his Holiness would appoint a mere punishing
authority, that never had an example, and not so much as signify to us the
constitution thereof, by Bull, Brief, or other Papal instrument, but as if
our case, function and travels were despiseable to leave us to the reports of
others for notice thereof: who, as to his Holiness knowledge deeds have proved,
incline more to favor that is against us, then to friend or causes. And to
say, as some say, or as they say who say most, that his Holiness wisdom
omitted to make forth a Brief thereof, for fear of trouble, and provoking the
State, is so light and superficial a reason, as it best answers it self in
his own weakness. For what greater trouble could such a Brief cause, which
the institution of the new authority causes not more? Neither do we demand
the transporting of the Brief, though we see no more danger therein then in
sending over the Cardinals letters, yea much less, because the pot that goes
often to the water, is likelier at length to return broken, then that which
was used but once. The favor and justice we sue for, is only canonical notice
of that which is done. For this we call, for this we have long and often
called, and for this shall we still continue calling, being both just and
reasonable, and the performance of no difficulty, nor requiring time, were the
authority his Holiness ordinance. On the other side, if no such two Briefes
were set forth (as I am sure you will not grant) then must father Parsons the
archdeuiser thereof be much too blame in getting the Cardinals hand,
subscription and seal to the aforesaid Letter, and just cause administered, why
we should suspect the like piece of cunning in other letters that have come
from the Cardinal. There is one clause chiefly in his Graces letter of the
tenth of November, which bearing little show of indifferency, makes us the
more to fear the like guile by father Parsons. For who ever heard, where there
was but an outward face of justice, that the Judge shall command one
adversary, to inform him of the life and manners of the other adversary, and
to lay down his causes and reasons for him in the matter in question between
them? The partiality appears such, as deforceth us to think that ever his
Grace read the Letter, but signed it, upon confidence of father Parsons
sincerity and wisdom. A smooth mean to deceive the best. You see good sir,
how either part of the proposition (and one must needs be true) makes in our
excuse, for not stooping down our necks to the yoke that father Parsons has
prepared, and by all means labors to enforce. If Master Standish be asked
the cause of his journey to Rome, the persuasions used to him to that end, the
helps he received, the companions he went with his long expectance for father
Parsons return out of Spain, who brought him to the presence of his Holiness,
the particulars of the oration he made, of whom he received the instructions,
his Holiness speeches in answer thereunto, he can inform enough, if your own
acquaintance with the plotting and process of the matter be not light
sufficient, to teach you who invented the new authority, who laid the ground,
who added the complements. I should stay my pen from writing it, if it auailed
ought to be silent in that which every man notes. It would make more to the
praise of father Parsons, if being a religious man, he were either less
active, or busied in matters directlier appertaining to his calling and charge.
For what has he to do with the Priests in England? How do we depend of him? At
what back-dore unknown does his authority or charge come in? Or what may the
rich pleasures be that his wit and travels has stead us in, and bound us to
him, why he should in this high presume of our patience, and yielding to
whatsoever he likes to appoint? Sundry of his devises, or to return the same
word back again that he gives us, disturbances, have so little made us
beholden unto him, that neither we nor our Country have received more
prejudice from any that seems to love us. He happy, we happier, if religion
were less worldlified in him, and state matter, and the designing of kingdoms
had not so great a part in his studies.

5. Father Parsons has given wrong information to the Cardinal and his
Holiness.

So far as the conjectures of all likelihood may auerre a troth, this is no
untruth, because we can no way conceive that the Cardinal or his Holiness would
ever have decreed such a penal form of government, consisting only in taking
away of graces, without bringing the least benefit to our country, or ease to
our afflictions, if their wisdoms had bin fully and rightfullie informed of
the true state and terms of our adversities. That I say nothing of the
designs and petitions which many of the ancients in our realm had assigned,
and were forthwith determined to exhibit them to his Holiness view, judgment,
and approbation. Further, if father Parsons had given true information to the
Cardinal and his Holiness, it follows necessarily that his credit is right
little or naught with either (which you would not have us to think) yea and
their loves and care also (which we shall never think) as little or less
toward the huge multitude of our manifold miseries, in reason their supreme
authority and compassion cannot be drawn to grant upon his information, and
soliciting no other favor then increase of penalties, and faculty to revoke
whatsoever our late Cardinal of blessed memory had obtained of the sea
Apostolic, as well to credit Priests the more, as also to manifest his greater
affection toward our Country: yea, and as though this had bin too little
severity, to inflict besides that kind of punishment, without annexing the
same to any crime or crimes, as no age since the beginning of the world (as I
verily assure my self) yields in all respect a president. All which
considerations command us to believe, that the Cardinal (especially his
holiness) had no part in setting down the particulars of the authority, or
were not well informed, but much more misinformed by father Parsons.

6. The Cardinal was always partial on the Jesuits side.

I wot not into what hard meaning the word partial may be drawn, therefore
we only affirm, that his Grace is no way a backfriend to your Society, but
every way most ready to do you all the pleasures and the best furtherances he
can.

7. Some of necessity must be sent to inform better.

I verily believe the necessity hereof, was many ways so importantlie great,
that unless our two brethren had out of their charity and due considerations,
adventured upon the difficulties of the journey, for learning the truth, and
his Holiness pleasure in all things, there had bin much more alteration and
questioning among us about the validity and bond of the authority, then now
is, or hereafter can be, having by their labors made known our case, and
submissiuelie referred our selves to his Holiness arbitement in what soever.
That the Cardinal by the title of his Protectorship, should have the like
sovereignty in England, as to enforce a Superior upon us, manger our
unwillingness, and without our priuitie, seems so strange a novelty, as the
like was never heard of in our country before, nor as I think ever had
instance in any other country heretical or catholic. Or if his excellency
have this ample jurisdiction, by any other title, grace, or privilege, it were
very meet we knew it, and after some authentical manner, especially since he
delegateth authority, even to take all authority from us, granted by whom
soever, or when soever: yea, to remove us from the places of our acquaintance
and residence, and by consequence to turn us to seek harbor and sustenance
among strangers: an extremity most seueare and most meruellous, the rigor of
the laws of our Realm, and the terms of the best condition that Priests
live in duly considered, which is mean and base enough, without this new
increase of our greater contempt and agrieuances.

8. The messengers must procure that some assistants be chosen, who may not be
thought partiallie affected to the Jesuits.

Sir, admit this were so, albeit I think there will be many other motions made
before, yet what kind of injustice, or uncharitable dealing can you deduce from
hence? Is there not good cause that at least some of the assistants (who have
by the verity of Master Blackwels words, every one in his own quarter, as
large authority to execute all extremities as himself against us) should be
perfitlie upright, without poize of biase or parcialitie? And I pray what
reason can you yield, or any other complice of the new authority, why the
Priests themselves of each quarter should not be franchised and allowed so much
favor, as to choose the assistant that must be over them, unless we must be
made yongmen still, or rather boys or children, and you our tutors to govern
and direct us in all things, and give our voices for us?

9. The m^ssengers must propound to have the government of the College
enlarged, as being ouer-straile or indiscreete for our nation.

As I cannot affirm, so will I not deny, but they may peradventure move such
a suit to his Holiness, and the sooner by much, in regard we hold the same no
prejudice, but a pleasure done to your Society, as being the self suit which
your General as your selves give forth, has made to his Holiness, and that of
late: and which also well established, could not fail to be but a marvelous
good furtherance both to the making and keeping of a perfect peace among us, and
likewise to the augmenting of your greater, or more general good name and
estimation. For from whence comes the cause of all, or most of our
agrieuances, but from the manner of governing that College? And what so
greatly weakeneth the good opinion which our Realm has conceived of your
Society, as the continual coffeehouse of the scholars there, and the
multiplicitie of their complaints here after their ariuall? Grief and shame
forbid me to rehearse their manifold exceptions, or to name the crimes, that
were after their departure f^o^ the College most injuriously imposed upon
them, and as full detractiouslie read openly in the Refectorie, and diunlged
to their foulest infamy. I omit these as points more odious, then willingly I
would any way occupy my pen in, and do only beseeke you, to tell me with
what indifferent person, you think it can find good hearing, that the Students
there, must not talk nor confer under three in a company: nor those of one
chamber speak or recreate with their fellows of another chamber, and that
they must have strangers to their prefects, whereby the d^e honor of our
nation, especially of the ^lder sort of Priests, and students (to whom that
^ffice always hitherto belonged) must needs be much impaired, if not
distained: also the number of scholars, which otherwise the revenues of the
College would serve to maintain, lessened, by so many at least, as the
company of the externe prefects amount to.

10. Yea the messengers must make suit that the Jesuits be removed from all
the Seminaries of our nation, and touching the mission of England in particular
all the Jesuits must needs be called away.

This amplifying speech and exaggeration is the addition of some cunning head,
and happily not by chance reserved by you for the last place, as by the
pretexed impiety and mustering whereof, all that went before, might the sooner
leese the credit of truth, and take unto them the show of words of malice, ad
excusandas excusationes in peccatis. For my own part I can say, and as I
verily think all my associates can auerre the same, that until the reading of
your letter, I never heard the least inckling of any such matter. Beside, grant
we could so frame our consciences, yet unless we should leese our natural
wits therewithal, we could not show our selves so very sooles, as to propound
the like motion to his Holiness, being the assured mean of drawing rebuke to
our selves thereby, and to stop his Holiness ears against the hearing of other
suits. And to speak my mind plainly as the quicknes of the premises
inforceth: without all question, it is a large freedom of tongue, that many of
your favorites use, if your selves be all clear. The fault is generally
noted, begins to be appropriated, dismayes not a few, and cannot but ere long,
purchase small commendation to your Society, if it be not eftsoone reformed.

In the paragraffe following, you infer as it were a conclusion, saying: These
and the like speeches having bin uttered by such as either gathered voices for
another government, or are known not to favor this: what can it argue else,
but such oppose themselves against the Society, as if no authority were to be
liked, but that which may beat down the Jesuits, or set them and other
reverend Priests together by the ears? The frank liberty of your pen
astonieth dear sir. For the disjunctive cannot be proved, and your illatiue
imports much detraction, charging us to have no other mark in our eye in the
association we labored, but the beating down of your Society, and the
setting of you and other reverend Priests together by the ears. Alas, could
not charity and your love of Priests, entreat your prei^dicate conceits so
much, as to think there was some other cause less wicked and more excusable,
why we embrace not the new authority, then for that no authority likes us, but
which treads the Jesuits under foot, and sows discord? Hard, that nothing
can be disliked in your actions, but by and by, it must be dubbed an
opposition, and every opposition also, to carry the like uncharitable gloses.
The form of government that was gone about by the assent and good liking of
those, that were to live under the same, was no whit in the outward letter
prejudicial to the Society, as both you and father Edmonds did severally
approve, and the rules themselves declare. And to presume a corrupt intention,
to fear false measure, and to suspect the lurking of notorious impiety, where
the ouert act is good, and the doers never detected of any treachery: if it be
policy, it is s^pientia huius mundi, the wisdom of this world, contrary to
the property of charity, quae omnia credit, which believes all things, if
not contrary to our Saviors prohibition, nolite iudicare, judge not.

You verily sooth, that the success of matters* since the authority of the
Reverend Archpresbyter was diuulged, does make many to fear, least the secret
intention (yet not perceived of all) of those which were the principal
seekers, to erect a sodalitie, or other superiority and subordination, was
either ambitious, or seditious. You still make little conscience to speak your
pleasure of us. Master Standish was the first and principal mouer (as I have
bin told) of the sodalitie, and who understanding that his parts were counted
by us not fit to bear office in the same, anon shifted sails (upon what
intent you may better ask him) and so leaving us, went to you, became an
agent, and by his industry or good fortune, has gotten an assistantship. If
in the former charge you mean him, he is of age let him answer for himself.
But if by it you point to me, and others, then let us see how you fasten the
fault of ambition or sedition upon us. You say because having now that very
thing which we sought for, although imposed upon other persons, do
nevertheless reprehend and impugn the same. Like truth, like proof. Is the
new authority good sir, that very thing we sought for? I could wish that
writing in a controversy, you would be better advised what you did affirm,
and how you did contradict your self: for not seven lines before, you called
ours another government from this, as indeed it is, and as different a
government, as chalk and cheese, white and black. For as chalk and cheese
agree in whitenes, and white and black in that they are both colors: so this
new authority with that we intend, agrees only in the name of a government,
and in all other points and properties, most discording and dissonant, as is
manifest by comparing them together. Ours constrained none to accept thereof:
this inforceth all. Ours communicated benefits: this penalties. Ours was to be
instituted by the good liking of all their consents that were to obey: this
enacted by whose means we know not, other then by the plotting of your
Society, unwittingly to us all. Ours a superiority entreating: this full of
commands. Ours never to have proceeded, unless the following of peace had bin
sure by the opinion of all or the most and wisest: this the more unquietness it
moves, the greater variance it stirs, the stifflier and with the more
earnestnes it is pursued against the refusers. Ours brought in it self
consolations to our aflictions, relief to our needs, succor to our
distresses, several commodities to our country, spiritual and temporal, and
a continuing mutualitie of good offices; not only between us, that were of
that sodalitie, but between us and our other brethren, and also between the
Clergy and the Laity: this, I mean as it has bin hitherto practiced,
harroweth men's consciences, brings Priests in contempt, makes laymen our
controllers, rayseth slanders, priuiledgeth the toungs of your followers,
preiudiceth our best friends, decays charitable alms, breeds faction, and
puts dislike between persons of nearest aliance. And none of these heanie
sequeles counterpoysed, by any spiritual good ensuing, either to us, or our
country thereby; nay both receive detriment in this kind also, as the new
authority is now and evermore may be demayned against us; as namely, trouble,
cumber, vexation of mind, scandal, and stumbling blocks, even in the way of
the good. Thus you see good sir, how little in our account, the new authority
is that very thing we sought for. And admit it were the selfsame with ours, as
you affirm it to be, yet have I to demand of you, why favoring the new
authority with the maine force of all your endeavors, by praising, writing,
subscribing, counselling, directing, soliciting, employment of your friends,
and what way soever you could, or can most grace, recommend, and promote the
same, did so little countenance and set forward the association we purposed,
being as you will needs have it, the selfsame thing with the other: I say,
did so little countenance and set it forward, as some of your brethren (what
part soever your self had therein) spoke liberally against it, dispraised it,
condemned it, gainestood it, and by cunning prevention overthrew it? Again, if
ours and this be all one, what may Master Blackwels reasons be, why he, having
written, and to so great liking of himself, against that which we purposed,
would or did accept of this with all readiness and applause, being as you
confidentlie affirm, the very thing which ours was, and which himself before
improued with many words? I will go further, and ask you that which is
hardlier assoyled. What moved Master Blackwell, if this and ours be one, to
discommend and glaunce so often and prettily as he has done, both in speech and
writing at the one, and so exceeding highly commend and extol the other? If he
or you seek to guild the matter, in respect, that this has the strength and
lover of authority, which ours had not, the shadow which hereby you would
seem to lay on, is nothing, because there is neither of you both, but well
knew, that it was never our intention to have the fellowship we solicited to
proceed, be in force or in esse, before the Popes Holiness had ratified and
confirmed the particulars. And the motive why we did acquaint the number of our
brethren with the design, before we sought for confirmation thereof, from the
chair of his Holiness, was not for an idle vaunt, or for an untimely, or
incongruent publication of our purpose (as Master Blackwell is still pleased
to hold the opinion) but for that we would not give our brethren cause of
offense, as justly we had done, by procuring the allowance, and establishing
of the association without their priuitie, advise and agreement first had
thereunto.

You demand, what you have done that all should not affect you, affirming,
that if any affect you not, the fault is in them, and not in you. Good sir, I
know not your faults, or if I did, I should refuse to compose the Letanie: yet
do I not think, you bear that kind of hatred to your selves, as telling your
own tale, you would hurt your own credits. There is no doubt but there are
many that do not affect all your proceedings, but where the blame rests
hereof, that is the doubt: you lay it in us, we return it to you, and I
beseech the mercies of Almighty God, that we may every one see his own fault,
agnize, and amend it.

You hold on, and make the degrees of affection which every one bears toward
your Society, a touchstone as it were for trying who are fit, who unfit to be
Superiors. I will repeat your own words as they lie together, to the end I be
not thought to misconsture, disioynt or wrong place them. If they would have
themselves or others that do not affect us (though otherwise seeming never so
virtuous) to be chosen heads: let them first affect us (so far as in virtue
they ought) that they may be worthy of government. The first parenthesis
shows naught that glistereth to be gold, unless it has your opinion for
foil. The residue lays in, as it were a caveat, or rather gives order, that
such as would be heads, must first affect you ( so far as in virtue they
ought) that they may be worthy of government. I must take leave to ask you
who shall judge of this measure and quality of affection, which of like
necessity you require? Others or your selves? If others, who are they, and who
made them the like officers? If your selves be the men, in what assurance can
you put us, that you will always judge aright? Forsooth the whisperings of
your own thoughts, the construction you shall be pleased to make of other men's
words, deeds, and demeanor, shall be the aim, rule, compass and light to
direct you. And what may this be other then for your selves to bear rule,
which if it be not your desires so to do, truly there is an untruth conceived
of you, and which has many belieuers, and which in the contriuing, and
managing of these latter actions, is no more hid, then what is most visible.
But I pray, what may the full meaning be of the condition you set down, and
which makes those only capable of superiority, or head-ship, that are
qualited therewith? Do they only affect you so far as in virtue they ought,
that have but one yea and one nay with you, and can dislike naught, and will
approve all, whatsoever you say or do, or go about? Or may they be said to
affect you so far as in virtue they ought, who carry a reverent respect
toward your Society, and toward your persons also, yet not so
affectionatlie, but will see and can dislike that is amiss in your actions,
and be further willing, to put their most help to the redress? No doubt if
this measure be of the size that contenteth, there are as many or more fit,
left vnchosen as chosen, upon suspect and jealousy only, that they affected you
not, so far as in virtue they ought. I have little fear but that Master
Blackwell well cleared himself of all suspicion that way, and affected you so
far as in virtue he ought, when in your behoof, and not without prejudice to
the scholars, he wrote a Letter to Rome, witnessing under his hand, that there
was no dislike or difference between the fathers of the Society, and the
Priests in England, albeit your self with show of grief voluntarily
acknowledged the contrary unto me not long before; yea complained thereof, and
expostulated the causes. He also affected you so far as in virtue he ought,
when for making up the fuller measure of your purgation, let not (as the
report goes) to touch three Priests at once with disgrace, by writing under
their testimonies and censure which they gave, concerning the particulars of
the memorial: Hij tres patres non been informantur etc. as if the three good
Priests had bin altogether strangers to the State and truth of matters, or
carried so loose consciences, as in so weighty an affair, would affirm they
knew not what, and to testify under their hands what themselves were ignorant
of. Likewise that party affected you so far as in virtue he ought, who
writing somewhat (as it was thought) with the largest in your and your
brethrens behalf, and being demanded by a familiar friend of his, how he
could verify the words, answered, he could do it by the figure hyperbole. If
such dealing and excess of truth be the mean of farming your good conceits,
I would be loath to become tenant, if I might have, as this good man had, an
assistantship for vantage. Others who spoke and wrote their conscience, and
delivered no more, then what their knowledge, judgment, and integrity led
them unto, and that also upon charitable considerations, and to good purpose,
were notwithstanding deemed thereby not to affect you so far as in virtue
they ought, and thereupon by the decree of your own order, reputed not worthy
of government. The particular is known, and after an undeniable manner, as
from his mouth, who carries greatest regard with you. By all that I have said,
I would say, that this your strange caveat or canon, and correspondent
proceedings, as well in appointing of our Superior, as in the choice of the
assistants, and in the devising of the instructions and form of government,
show apparantlie enough, how little you seek to have the ordering and swaying
of all things.

You affirm, that in very deed, you would not have any reprehended, because
they are opposite against you, but because they acknowledge not their lawful
Superior. I pray sir, how do these words comport with that you said before,
where you will have the want of affection toward you, a bar against
election? Will you make men vneligible, without a fault, or without such a
fault as is worthy of reprehension? or will you have such faults as make men
vneligible, to be soothed in them and not reprehended? One of these must needs
follow, by the sequel of your order: and either concludes more then my self
sees reason to maintain. But let this be as it may be, assuredly all men are
not persuaded, and some do feel, and will swear, that not only the
reprehending of your oppositors, but the punishing of them also, and with
extreme rigor enough, sets but as a gentle corrasiue to your hearts,
howsoever you grieve now, and would have that none be reprehended for being
opposite against the Society.

You give us to know, and seem to take a liking therein, that you will by Gods
grace, procure always, and to your uttermost, that whosoever is opposite
against the reverend Archpresbyter, must of force be consequently opposite
against you and your brethren. Howsoever you please your self in the needless
uttering of these voluntary speeches, my dulnes cannot conceive how this
spirit agrees with that of Saint Paul, factus sum infirmus infirmis vt
infirmos lucrifacerem, by compassion of the infirmities of all sorts I became
weak to the weak, that I might gain the weak. If it be a fault to oppose
our selves in the manner we do against the new authority challenged (as we
acquiet our conscience to the contrary, and think our selves well able by
sound and good arguments to uphold the lawfulnes thereof against whom soever
in our country) yet your Society being no party, nor bound to intermedle,
more indifferency, and less taking against us, had been in my poor opinion,
as charitable and more wisdom. For by making your selves a party without
cause, and so professed and forward a party, what could you get but
adversaries, and have debarred your selves from being mediators in the
difference, si fieri potest, quod ex vobis est, cum omnibus hominibus pacem
habentes, if it may be, as much as in you, having peace with all men.

That you say you will gloriari in Domino, if any be thought opposite to your
Society, who are opposite to our reverend Archpresbyter: I say no more, but
hope, that notwithstanding your gloriari in Domino, your glory in our Lord,
yet our Lord will not be in this, gloria vestra nec exalta^s caput vestrum, your
glory, nor the lifter up of your head.

You avouch, that the new authority is the only means to join us all
together in perfect love and union, and that there is now no hinderance at all
of unity, but the not admitting and refusing of the same. Sir, I can easily
believe you in this, for God forbid I should live the while, to account you, or
any of you, so ouerloaden with frailties, or surcharged with ill nature, that
having your desire, will refuse to contract love and union with those that
granted it unto you, and further, surrender themselves to your disposing.

That which follows in the same paragraffe makes me somewhat to muse, by
whose authority or example, you apply the words of Saint Paul, non tenens
caput, not holding the head, to the Archpresbyter. For if the holy Fathers of
Christ's Church, and the Popes themselves, other then in a general term, ever
abstained for reverence to the Apostles, from using their kind of blessing and
salutation, gratia and pax a Deo Patre and Domino nostro Jesus Christo, grace
and peace from God our Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ, I see not why you
might not very well for reverence sake, have forborne the application of that
passage to Master Blackwell, being literallie and ever principally referred
to our Savior, and never secondarilie applied to any but a Pope, nor can be
but incongruously, as my small reading and judgment gives me. A bold charge,
hard measure, that, for bearing off to subject our selves to the new
authority, until the return of our two brethren with true certificate of his
Holiness pleasure therein, we must be counted by you, non tenere caput ex quo
totum corpus per nexus and coniunctiones subministratu^ and constructum crescit
in augmentu^ Dei, not holding the head, whereof the whole body by ioints and
bands being served and compacted, grows to the increase of God: which is by
the prime and proper signification of the place, to apostatate or forsake
Christ, and in the second and largest sense, to be an heretic or
schismaticke. Take heed good sir, least for reproving others, you utter what is
not worthy of your self. I know you had not The insuings showed I was deceived
herein.
so ill a meaning, but the inferences be direct, and therefore I wish you
again to take better heed to the running of your pen hereafter.

You say, the new authority is received with singular liking of the most and
best, and that who is joined to Master Blackwell is yours, and qui cum illo
non colligit spargit, he that does not gather with him scatters. First, you
forget comparisons to be odious, and continue the citing of places vnprouable
against us. Then you sooth more then can be truly auerred in the eye of the
world: for by general opinion, there are of as good parts, and of as good
deserts, and of no less name, that have not, as have submitted themselves
thereunto. And for the number (a gay coate-card in all your mouths) I think
if there were authority from the sea Apostolic, willing every Priest to
deliver his conscience which of the two kinds of government he most liked, or
deemed fittest, either this of your and father Parsons devising, where an
Archpresbyter, the lowest Prelature in holy Church, and now And this time the
Laity were not comprised under the authority.
worn out of use, must absolutely command and prescribe to the Clergy of a
whole kingdom: or the other that we now principally sue for, which is the
Ecclesiastical and only usual regiment throughout all Christendom: I say, if
there were such authority granted, for coming to the true knowledge of every
priests opinion herein, there would be, as I am most assured upon good grounds,
ten for one, if not twenty, or rather hundreds of the Clergy and Laity with
us against you.

Now sir for conclusion, if the points of your Letter to me, or more, if the
contents of your Letters to others, whereof I have had some understanding: or
more then either, if the severity used in Rome and in England against our
cause and brethren, were vprightlie and iudiciallie weighed, doubtless in my
opinion there would appear little ground for the truth of that you say in the
beginning of your Letter, to wit, that if all could not be induced to love and
affect you, you would yet bear their auersion with patience and silence,
without following any course or pursuit against them. I pray, if the Society,
I mean the English and your adherents, should do their worst, what could there
be more done then is done against us? Could there be more horrible crimes
objected? Could what is objected be more openly or more against conscience
diuulged? Could promises be less kept? Could conditions be worse performed?
Could dissimulation be finelier masked? Could Priests sustain greater trial
of patience, then is heaped on them? Could the burden of their afflictions take
increase? Could their friends be more earnestly labored to withdraw their
good liking and charities from them? Could there be mightier shoouing, to
remove some of that coat from their places of residence? Could all assayes,
almost every way, to that end be less forborne? Could detraction be rifer?
Could calumniators swa^ue more? Could mo pratlers be found to tenise their
obloquies? Could harder censures be given of them or more liberally? Could
their lives be ripped up from a further period? Could their faults be liuelier
depainted? Nay, could faults of no faults be plentifullier created? Or could
all this, or more, go freer without satisfaction, less check, rebuke, or
controulement? Lamentable, that men suffering for being Priests, and suffering
the like extremities they do, should be deuoyded of faculties, and have doubts
thrust into their heads, and by parties of special name, to be also unlawful
for them either to use the altar, or to practice preaching. So that if
particulars be believed, small is the patience, less the silence, and sharp is
the course or pursuit that is followed against us. I write not these things to
the end I do or would charge any in particular, and much less you, then any
other: whom my love has a long while reverenced for virtue, and other good
habilities: but I rehearse them (and verily with tears) to move pity, to stir
up compassion, and if I might be so happy, to procure also the surceasing and
redress of these our common, but no common miseries. And one thing seems
more strange then all, that acquainting as we did M. Blackwell himself with
our purpose of sending to Rome for full understanding of his Holiness mind, and
to intimate to his wisdom the true state of our country, and the terms of
Priests, as his holy Fatherhood (by the relation of those that heard the
speeches) required us to do, yea some having made their appeal also from him,
yet that in this short interim till our just doubts be cleared, neither he, nor
your society, nor your copartioners, can be entreated to breath, and let the
difference sleep, till our brethren bring, or your selves show his Holiness
resolution, but will needs with tooth and nail, and with all earnestnes pursue
the challenged authority against us, and stop at nothing that lies in your
way, be it the general disturbance of us all, and the disquieting of the whole
realm, that I say nothing of the scandal nor of the edging of other persons.
A better temper would more commend. Undoubtedly, if our two friends return not
the sooner, nor you persuaded to desist from the busy course begun, assure
your selves you will bail our pens, and enforce us for defending of our good
names, to make known to the whole realm, the full state and process of all
matters in Rome and in England. Wherein, if there fall out ought, as it is
feared there will fall out much, little to the commendation of some of your
proceedings, you are to impute the blame to your selves, that thus mainely urge
the occasion. Good counsel to remember before hand, that had I wist is too
late. Neither were it amiss if you did less follow the begging of names to
Olim dicebamur, especially with less importunity; an office fullest of
suspision for you to take upon you: but all shows from whence the plot came,
and whither it tends, to have our heads under your girdles, in making and
ruling our Superior, and by consequence in working your pleasures in whatsoever
upon us. Patience. For taking my leave, I beseech you to consider the
dissension at Rome, to consider the differences in England, to look into the
causes and maintenance of them both, and if you do not espy that we have more
to say against you, then you against us, yet to think that our purgation when
it comes forth, will show you so much, and prove us also to have used more
plainness, forbearance, truth, silence and charity, then our oppositors have
done in their cariages against us. Thus have I (beloved sir) tired my self,
and long troubled you, beseeching you humbly of pardon, if I have any way
offended: and truly, if I knew the word, line, sentence, or particular which
were against bounden charity, I could labor rather to blot it out with tears
of blood, then ever suffer it to come to reading. Fare you well most heartily.

A Postscript.
GOod sir, let the length of my answer excuse that it comes in an other
bodies hand, and the reason why it comes so long after yours, was an
ague-doubtfulnes, whether I should reioyne or no: fearing least if I did, I
might move offense, which I am loath to do, and would not have set upon the
adventure, had your side taken up in any time, or observed any measure in their
hard speeches against us. The excess and surfeit whereof, has bin and
continues so great, that had men and women a charter to speak what they list,
of Christ his anointed, and that there were no such thing as the restitution
of fame, I see not well, how they could either less restrain, or more enlarge
their ignorant and slanderous babbling. I hope, conscience binding, and all
laws permitting us to defend our guiltlesnes against whom soever, you will
not dislike, and less misconsture, and lesser misinforme against this our
enforced appologie, but rather understanding the grounds of our refusal,
procure with all speed canonical certitude of that you would bring upon us,
which must and shall presently stint all disputes, and find us readily
obedient in what soever. Fare you well again, and our Lord protect you, and
give me of his grace to see his holy will, and follow it.

Yours in true love, John Colleton.

NOtwithstanding the serious and several auowances interlaced in the former
Letter, that the least Canonical notice, such as the law in like cases
prescribes, should presently without further question, have us ready upon the
first showing thereof, to subject our selves to the authority: yet did father
Garnet, and father Lister, the one in a Letter communicated to many, the other
in a diuulged Treatise, censure and condemn us of schism, and alike violently
prosecuted their opinion, as if the same had bin the sentence of all the
learned, or rather the declaration of the Sea Apostolic. Neither did this
their headie presumption correct it self in any time, but the passion endured,
and not endured only, but increased also to the heaping of most excessive and
intolerable injuries upon us. Nevertheless, our thirst after peace and
quietness was such, as we sent the conditions following to Master Blackwell
(who had now allowed the said Treatise of father Lyster, and taken on him the
patronage of father Garnets positions) that his Reverence conferring the matter
with the Fathers of the Society, the difference might be composed, and our
selves reunited in former love.

Conditions offered to Master Blackwell by the Priests, who delayed to receive
him to their Superior before the coming over of his Holiness Breue.
AS always we have, so now expressly again we do admit all Authority,
whatsoever his Holiness has instituted, and are most ready actuallie to obey
the same, when authentical proof thereof shall be showed unto us.

Further if that can not be showed, yet for avoiding slanderous reports, and to
the intent we may more peaceably exercise our functions, benefit and edify
others, we are well content voluntarily to subject our selves and obey this
form of government, with these Conditions following.

First, that we may be sufficiently advertised, how far this Authority
extends particularly over us, and that we may have a copy thereof.

Secondly, that you and the Society will consent with us to the sending over
of certain, who may thereby have the freer access to his Holiness, both to
inform him in our cause, and understand his holy Fatherhoods determination
therein: Always provided, that if their audience be prevented directly or
indirectlie by your or the Societies means, that then we fully revoke all
obedience here offered.

Thirdly, in consideration that two of our brethren employed in this business,
have bin, by information from hence, discredited and imprisoned, and so still
continue for ought we know: our desire is, that we may receive from you notice
of the crimes or misdemeanour laid against them, or have your testimony for
their good carriage and behavior whilst they lived here, or at least, that you
knew no defaming ill by them.

Fourthly, that whereas we all in general, and diverse particularly have bin
injured and defamed by a Treatise of Schism, diuulged by one of the Society,
the same may be reuersed, and we again restored to our credits.

Fifthly, that you would let us have your accord, and letters over, for
procuring order from his Holiness, that hereafter the Archpriest may not be
elected otherwise then by the consent and voices of our own body. Likewise
that the Assistants in respect they have (as it is affirmed) equal authority
with the Archpriest in the places where they govern, may not be chosen but by
suffrage of the Priests, who reside in the Shires or circuit over which the
Assistant shall be authorized.

Sixthly, that every one that shall be made either Archpriest or Assistant,
shall for avoiding tumult or perpetual contention through the confounding and
mixing of the two distinct States together, Religious and Secular, protest by
the word of a Priest, that he is not by vow, obedience, or other tie, in
subodination or incorporate to any other body or company then our own, and
that he will manifest so much, and surrender the place and authority he
holds over us, whenever he shall be thoroughly determined to change his
state and vocation.

Lastly, that for so much as the State is already maruellouslie incensed
against us, and the indignation increasing daily by the means of books,
letters, and plots touching State matters, neither meet in these times, nor
belonging to our function: our most earnest request is, that all proceedings of
this quality be by you utterly and presentlle forbidden: and that you, with
the joint petition of all the Assistants, would make instant supplication to
his Holiness for express prohibition thereof.

THe offer of these conditions, how well soever the same was meant by us, was
nevertheless alike offensiuely taken by our Archpriest, as his Reverence did
not only most peremptorily reject them all, but returned in his answer, that
impenitencie of heart, and an obstinate will of sinning being the more grievous
frenzy, drew us to the That is called by our Archpriest a destruction of
peace and order, which the Canons of holy Church appointed for the
preservation of peace and order.
making of the requests: and that our petition of having the Archpriest and
the assistance to be chosen hereafter by the voices of the Priests who were to
obey, was the destruction of peace, and the perturbation of order in the
Church, being in truth the express decree of holy Ca. 1. de electi.
Canons, and the customarie form of electing Superiors over the whole
Christian world. Again, his Reverence termed our demand of having the
treatise of schism reuersed, an unreasonable request, because. (as he gave the
reason) the medicine ought not to be removed, before the sore be thoroughly
cured, applying besides these words of scripture unto us, stiff-necked, and of
uncircumcised hearts and ears, always resisting the holy Ghost, with many
other alike exciting speeches.

Not long after the exhibiting of the aforesaid conditions, his Holiness Breiue
arrived, and we presently without any stay, received Master Blackwell to our
Archpriest, and yielded him our obedience: yea, such was our affection to
unity, as for desire thereof, we were content to pardon all the injuries and
defamations past, being many in number, and in quality most grievous. At this
very time our Archpriest wrote likewise a common Letter, willing and
commanding all Priests not to vpbraide and impute the fault of schism any
more unto us. Which favor (so to call the surceassing of most grievous wrongs)
we know not whether it moved sorrow or no in the Jesuits (who perhaps had
conceived some fear, least the concord begun, might diminish the authority
and sway they carried with the Archpriest, being linked now to his body, and
brethren) but most certain it is, that not many weeks after the making of
this general atonement, father Jones a Priest of the Society, gave forth,
and defended the assertion, that whosoever should stiffely maintain that our
refusal to the subordination appointed before the arrival of his Holiness
Breue, did not make us schismatickes, incurred by such his patronage of our
case the censures of holy Church. Which unreasonable position, our Archpriest,
my self acquainting him therewith, affirmed to be true; as there has bin
nothing hitherto written or spoken by the Fathers against us, which his
Reverence, how improbable and injurious soever the same was, has not soothed,
and to his power sought to justify. Neither did his Reverence after the
aforesaid prohibition, only allow and defend this strange saying of father
Jones, but also he himself diuulged a resolution, both declaring that we were
schismatics by our refusal, and directing all Priests not to apply the
benefit of absolution unto us, unless we did acknowledge the offense, and
make satisfaction for it. Which reuiuall of matters rising so directly, and in
points of like importance, both from the Society, and from our Archpriest, and
for that also some of our fellows were thorough the diuulging of the foresaid
resolution denied absolution in the sacrament of penance, and not suffered to
celebrate in some places where they came, and where before they had bin well
accoumpted of, we, not seeing a fitter mean either of easing our distresses,
or of relieuing our good names, framed the Petition following to our
Archpriest.

Very Reuend Father:
WE humbly beseech you, that the extreme necessity of the hard terms our
good names are brought into, may both excuse the boldness (if bounden endeavor
to put off so great a hurt may be called boldness) and incline your
consideration to take in good part the proposing of our request. Your Reverence
and others do still affirm, and seem to auow the opinion more and more, that
we incurred the crime and penalties of schism, in not absolutely admitting
your Authority before the ariuall of his Holiness Breue, our first certain
notice of his priuitie thereunto. Would God therefore it might please you
(dear sir) for perfect trial of the truth, and the through ending of the
controversy, to license, that we may confer, reason, or dispute the case
with the conditions under specified. Good manners, and more, the duties of
obedience, forbid us to name, or request you to be one of the disputants, being
our Superior, but if your own desires shall carry you to the yielding of your
most help, for better declaration and strengthening of the issue, we shall
heartily greet the favor, and rest fuller satisfied, in respect we wish the
uttermost that can be said and urged against us. For certes, if we see our
selves, we do neither affect to be misled by error, or dwell in ignorance, or,
presupposing that we are deceived, seek for ought more, then to have the noted
crime, fortified with the proofs that may most reprove and convict our
guiltines. Among all the means our poor wits could think of, this appeared
of most force and the readiest, as well to let the mistaken see their fail, as
also to mediate a general atonement, in regard the rules of conscience bind
to acknowledge a truth when it is evidently showed, and the agnizing induces
to satisfaction, and satisfaction has right and authority, as well to cancel
injuries past, as also to inuit love for the time to come. Two sovereign
effects, and being the native begetters and nourcers of peace, cannot but bring
great joy and edification to many. If therefore your better judgment shall
like to ratify this course, and vouchsafe to give us notice, the advertisement
will much glad us, and shall indebt us for dutiful thanks to your Reverence
for the kindness. Neither without good cause: for if the difference be not after
this way decided, alas we see no remedy, but of constraint our good names
bleeding alike pitifully as they do, and the wound so often and hardly rubbed
on as it is, we must either wittinglie suffer perpetual infamy to come upon
us, or take our pens in hand, and clear our selves as we may. A process
that fears, because great likelihood our apology shall receive an answer,
the answer require a reply, the reply occasion a reioynder, and so the
difference become a circle, that is to say, without end, unless How near is
this prediction true.
it be that lamentable end which the Apostle specifying, said, quod si inuicem
mordetis and comeditis videte ne ab inuicem consumamini, if ye bite and devour
one another, take heed least ye be not consumed one of another. To fly this
gulf, and eschew so idle wast of so much time, that we say nothing of the
scandal, we most submissiuely entreat your good Reverence, to grant for your
self, and solicit the Fathers, that we may in this sort (the shortest as we
deem, and the quietest of all others) stint and end the variance. And having
now good sir, proposed our request, and given you a feeling of our desires, it
follows that we suppliantlie beg of your good Fatherhood, which our hearts
perform in most respective manner, that you would not stretch our words beyond
our intention, which is only to make to appear, how earnestly we covet a
friendly conference, to hear what can be said, and be heard what we can say;
to the end the question to and fro largely discussed, the truth may lie open,
and all further contention dye for ever. Which being the all only scope and
mark of our design, propounded also upon hope of leave and under correction,
we trust there is no cause why we should fear to have our intercession for a
conference, named a challenge; our enforced defense, a voluntary opposition;
satisfaction to others, a breach of obedience; and the seeking of repose to our
own souls, undutifulness to our Superior, or contempt of Authority. An
entreaty that would make our case most miserable; laden till we be forced to
bemoane our agreeuances, and then more laden for making way to ease them. But
our hope is better, and we misdoubt no part of the precedent, in respect of
your own construction; but because the address (the purport so beseeking)
remains to be imparted by you to others, and perhaps not every one in
readiness to understand our meaning to the best; therefore we have presumed the
more expressly to signify what we would not have conceived amiss. And thus
(reverenced sir) being come to the end of that we would say, we leave, with
humblest request of pardon, and like defrayment of duty.

The first condition.
FAther Wallay, Father Lister, and whom and how many soever of the Society
they shall think good to choose unto them, to be reasoners, debatours, or
disputants of the one side: and of the other, three such Priests of our
company as we shall nominate.

The second.
The grounds, reasons, arguments, answers, reioynders of both sides, upon full
discussion and agreement to be set down in writing.

The third.
The vmpeers or arbitratours, to hear and determine of the weight, truth, and
coherence of all that shall be said or alleged by either side, to be two or
three of the senior Assistants, and Master Doleman. And that it be in the
choice of your Reverence to admit such of the Laity to be hearers of the
dispute, as to your wisdom for the quality of occurrances, shall seem meet.

The fourth.
That each of the foresaid arbitratours shall faithfully promise in the word
of a Priest, to proceed to the giving of sentence, upon the proof and
disproofe of either side, according to the dictamen of their consciences, and
inward persuasion, without delay, color, mitigation, and all partiality.

The fifth.
If the said arbitratours shall judge that our case was schism, and our selves
schismatics, then we to be bound most humbly to ask pardon on our knees of
your Reverence, and the Society, for hitherto defending the contrary, against
the verity of their and your affirmance: If of the other side, they shall
censure or deem that we were no schismatics, then the Society, especially
the penner, and the approuers of the pamphlet of schism, to acknowledge their
error, reuerse the tract, and make us some ratable satisfaction for the heap
of injuries and infamies sustained.

The last.
That it be lawful without offense or prohibition, for either side, after
sentence given and fulfilling of the premises, to seek (if it so please) a
resolution in the difference, from the Universities beyond the seas, upon show
and evidence of the said written dispute, grounds, reasons, proofs and
arguments, subscribed with the hands of the vmpeers and disputers of both
sides, to the end, it may manifestly appear to be the same, and no place left
to the other side to suspect any indirect dealing, either by adding, changing,
or subtracting ought, to, in, or from the original, and that none of the
foresaid arbitratours or disputants refuse or defer to put to his name, being
requested thereunto.

An Appendix.
Dear sir, after the writing of these, no weak doubt began to arise in our
minds, whether we had done well or ill, in not descending fuller into the
causes that induced, or truer constrained us, to the making of the foresaid
Supplication. And the more we chewed the doubt, the greater it waxed, and the
plainer we saw, how we had therein omitted the particularizing of that, which
would most justify the moving, and best plead the grant of our suit. May it
therefore stand with your good leave, that we here supply the defect, for what
you give not leave to, the same we revoke, and beseeke, it be holden unwritten.

1 The head sourse whence our agreeuances do chiefly spring, is the
retractation or vnperforming of that, which your self did set down under your
hand, and the testimony of one of your Assistants, namely, a prohibition,
willing, and if that were not sufficient, commanding all parties to desist to
inueigh or follow the note of schism against us, but contrariwise, to suffer
all matters past to quail, and to english your own Latin phrase, lie buried
in perpetual oblivion. Which charitable ordinance, and many ways most
needful, for making and conseruing peace, how much and how often it has bin
gone from, let the particulars declare that follow. One of us informed your
Reverence, that a Father of the Society (whom he named) affirmed, and stood
to the justifying of the assertion, that whosoever believes, or to use his own
word, holds opinion dogmatizando, that we were not schismatics, incurreth ipso
facto the censures of holy Church. Which license of speech (at leastwise
outwardly) you no way seemed to dislike, but answered, the position was true.
And if true, and we not deceived in the signification of the word, how many
good sir, of very good conscience, do there abide in a right doleful and a
most miserable plight of soul? All our ghostly children, not few in number,
and some of them of good quality, and infinite others beside hold opinion, nay
firmly, and most resolutely, and with boldest assurance believe, we were no
schismatics: and will the Father say that we, and they all, through this our
belief, live and continue in a damnable state, and under the heauiest curse
upon earth? Pardon, we can never think it, nor count it less in our selves
then rashest temeritie, even but once to surmise the same: yet unless the
Father be mistaken, or our selves beguild in the dark or incongruent senses of
his speech, we see no auoydance, but we must needs more then think it, being
bound, if his position be true, to believe and teach the verity thereof. Verily
dear sir, this touch, or somewhat more, sits so near, is of that nature,
reaches to so many, and goes vested with like circumstances, as by no warrant
of conscience, we may neglect the disproofe (were we through the virtue of
humility, or the holy contempt of our selves, never so greatly proane and
willing thereunto) as teaches Saint Tho. quodl. 10. quest. 6. art. 13. and
may be avouched by that known saying of Saint Augustine: Qui conscientiae
suae confidens famam negligit crudelis est: He is cruel, that neglects his
good name upon the cleerenesse of his conscience. And again, by that
exhortation of the Apostle, prouidentes bona non tantum coram Deo, sed etiam
cora^ omnibus hominibus, providing good things not only before God, but also
before all men. And the reason is apparent, for being pastors, and laboring
in the business of gaining souls, the report of a good name is as important to
us for the good of our neighbor, as a good conscience for our selves.

2 Further, your Reverence being sued unto by the whole number of Priests in
the Clinck for vouchsafing to restore M. Benson to the use of his faculties,
you refused, or thought it not meet so to do, unless among other points he
did first acknowledge and sorrow his long adhere^ce to the schismatic
conuenticle, meaning and so naming our company. Which form of speech, and
manner of proceeding, cannot but make plain to every understanding, how
desperately grievous you repute our state, and what miscreants we come to be
reckoned, when our Superior lets not to term our fellowship a
schismatical conuenticle, and that also by pen, whereunto then to a sodainnesse
of speech, a far more mature deliberation concurreth. Consider (in the name
of our Savior we humble the request unto you) the place you hold, the
authority your words bear, your writings more; and how thereby the weight of
our affliction, with the hauock of our credits daily increases, all or most
men taking your word for warrant against us.

3 Again, there is a Letter auowed to be written by your Fatherhood, as the
tenor can agree to no other, and the copies common, wherein the words following
lie word for word, without change or interposition. We have received a
resolution from our mother city, that the refusers of the appointed authority
were schismatics: and surely I would not give absolution to any that should
make no conscience thereof. Do they think that the scandal that did arise
thereof, that the discrediting of our Protectors authority, that the
opprobrious speeches against the Fathers uttered by them, that the danger they
drue me unto, may be free from sin? I hope they have not so senseless a
conscience. And therefore my direction is, that they do make account thereof,
and do make satisfaction before they do receive the benefit of absolution. The
order and manner of satisfaction, I refer unto the discretion of their
ghostly fathers which have not bin marked with this note of schism. O good
Lord help us, is our demand and standing off, only for canonical proof, that
the designed authority was the ordinance of his Holiness, or that it had his
Holiness approbation adjudged to make us schismatics, and the majesty of the
place remembered to credit our dome the more? And hereupon, as if all were by
and by an undoubted truth, whatsoever is advertised by some persons against us,
you, first soothing what you would do your self, command all other, that we
make satisfaction, ere the benefit of absolution be imparted unto us. An
ordinance only, and that seldom, annexed to public and horrible crimes: but
patience must be our remedy, and much patience seems not unneedful, albeit
our hope is, there may be some as mean scholars in Rome, as there are
elsewhere, or how singularly learned soever he or they were, that thus hardly
concluded, it infers not much, because as the evidence and information were
delivered, so without all doubt were we sentenced: and if these were either not
true or imperfect, as we assure our selves of the one or both, then must the
judgment depending thereon needs take the same dye, and be of like verity.
And if it be replied, that true and full information was given, then we ask,
why it is not added to the resolution, or otherwise showed unto us, to the end
our selves and others may be witnesses thereof, and have whereupon we may
justly alter and repent our contrary opinion? Besides, it were to good
purpose, and to our seeming not vnrequisite, that as well the names of the
resoluers, as also the most substantial reasons of such their opinion, were
likewise set down, and adjoined to the resolution. For without these or other
good specialties, what man or woman of conscience in the world, upon view or
hearesay of an vnauthored resolution, without show of proof, reason, instance,
example, or authority, will condemn so many as are of our side of so
irreligious a crime, and criminal outrage, whose proper entitie and nature
requires in the doer wittingnes, deliberation, obstinacy, and rebellion, and
that immediately or mediatlie, against our high Pontifex, and as Pontifex or
head of our Church: for upholding and maintenance of whose prerogatives, we
have suffered, and daily do, many sorts of pressures, calamities, and death it
self. A strange proposition, and much incredible. In like manner how is it
possible, that such a bare and naked resolution should weigh ought with us,
standing as we are verily persuaded we do, upon diversity of assured grounds
for the contrary, especially when we consider, who wrote the resolution over,
a puney in Religion, and fellow Jesuit with the creatours of our schism: at
what time? when a fear was conceived, least we had sent to the Sorbonists for
their opinion: why? because the usual aduertiser either had not (as may be
coniectured) or would not be seen to have his finger in so great an unright,
condemned ere we were heard to speak, or asked the reasons why we did prolong
our submission. To draw nearer, would not the ods in the judgment of all men
good sir, fall on our side, if to counteruaile this vnstrengthened resolution,
we should oppose the opinion and censures of our english Students and Doctors
at Doway, who (as an honest Priest reported Master Beisley.
that came from thence) make the discourse and proof of our schism, a mere
jest and matter of recreation, to sport themselves with by the fire, and cannot
believe but the author traveled when he penned it, in some forgetfulness of his
schollership, or distemper of head? Or, if we should seek to encounter the
said resolution by the suffrage even of such our fellow Priests here at home,
as have not bin marked with this note of schism, who being eye and ear
witnesses to all particulars, and not without some knowledge in the state of
most of our souls, and therefore by probability, as likely to see as far
into the point, as strangers, were we anon cast in the closing, or should we
leese thereby? If reports be true, or many of good understanding not deceived,
there are few of our said brethren either reverent for years, or specially
counted of for learning, virtue, wisdom, judgment, discretion, true courage
in Gods cause, or for any other good part, who do not greatly marvel at this
strange resolution, and not a little grieve to see and hear, how sharply, how
uncharitably, how iniustlie, we are dealt with, and what bond of endless
discord the pamphlet of schism (the occasion and origin of all) has most
unfortunately cast among us, which notwithstanding we do not rehearse, that
when the difference comes to trial, we intend to make benefit of such their
opinions, hoping without that help, to be able with sounder proofs to confirm
what we hold, then with such allegations. Now touching your Fatherhoods charge,
and our culpablenes in the other offenses specified, we omit to say much,
partly, in regard of duty, partly because we would not be thought tender in
taking, nor full of defending, partly also, for that the raising of scandal,
must fall in fine to their part, to whom the lawfulnes or unlawfulness of the
used process, and more the truth or untruth of our schism after deciding,
shall prescribe and give it. And as for the other three kinds of sin, of
discrediting our Protector, of uttering opprobrious speeches against the
fathers, and of drawing your self into danger, our only answer is, that
because the mentioning of them in this sort, brings a suspicion of their
ungodliness upon us all, we most heartily beseeke you, to nominate and take
condign punishment of the guilty, and thereby free the residue of so foul a
stain. Doubtless, if the taunts of our schism composed, and the plurality
of by-words which he spent in that paradox with less modesty against us, yea,
if his condemning untruths, in sentencing us to be rebels, schismatics, fallen
from Gods Church, offenders against all faith and humane authority,
excommunicate, irregular contemners, and treaders down of due obedience to the
Sea Apostolic, scandalizers of all the godly, infamous throughout every man's
mouth, no whit better then soothsayers and idolaters, and to be counted of as
ethnicks and publicans: if these we say with other intolerable defamations,
dispersed and sent to Rome against us for deeper deprauing our designs and
persons (which we can prove, some by letters yet extant, others by testimony
of credible relatours) were uprightly balanced, with that which we have said
or written against the Fathers, it would soon appear, and as manifestly as
light at noonetide, who have most exceeded, who have surfeited, and who remain
obliged to satisfye, for uttering, we may say lauishing, of loose, bad, and
opprobrious speeches. Is it possible, we mean Father Garnets words in his
letter to me of the 7. of March. 1599.
not for religious humility, or moral courtesy, but for gaul it self, or a
worse humor, to exaggerate matters heavier upon us, then to affirm, that if
those whom we have begotten to Christ, or who are our ghostly children,
should receive sacraments at our hands, they seem to receive poison in place
of medicine from us, yea also to commit grievous sin if they do but entreat
us to celebrate, or shall but help us at Mass. Surely, surely, had we defiled
our pens against the Fathers with like stuff and doctrine (Lord) how
frankly had we bin exclaimed against with open mouth, if not all the bells
both in town and country rung out Crucifige upon us long since, to our
everlasting ignominy? But the abomination and execration of our schism
commerited and importuned this, and a fuller measure of bitterness to be powered
upon us. Be it so, though we hope by all authorities to clear our selves from
any such tainder: yet the same being neither decided by sentence of holy
Church, nor in talk nor in the least suspicion, before it pleased the Fathers
to raise and spread the calumniation of us, we cannot but think we have
reason, to blame them of course and homely dealing, that having always honored
them in the degree we have, and they being neither our superior, against whom
our offense, if any were, was committed, nor in any way with us in
subordination unto him, but a distinct body from him and us, thus peremptorily,
thus eagerly, thus violently to censure and condemn their long welwillers, and
ioint-labourers with them in one vineyard. To say charity induced them to so
exceeding a process against us, were to speak voluntarily beyond all
likelihood of truth: for, if charity had bin the motive, charity being as the
Apostle writes, patient, benign, not provoked to anger suffering all things,
hoping all things, bearing all things, they would either have deferred the
denouncing of their cruel sentence upon us, knowing that we had long before
that time sent to his Holiness for understanding his pleasure, or have used
ciuiller terms, or at leastwise not interlaced so many frumps, and mightily
inciting scoffs, as they did in the treatise, fitlier beseeming a
Stage Player, then a religious person.

4 There remains one material point yet unremembered, and which puts us in
fear ofmo troubles at hand, viz. that part of your letter to Master Clearke,
wherein you signify, that you are content for the time to suffer us in our
opinion of schism, as the less evil, and will not deal as yet as a prelate
may do for appeasing the same. What course you intend against us good sir in
these your words, we know not in particular, but a warning they must needs be
unto us, either to address our selves, to take upon us without demerit, the
turpitude of schism, and thereby discredit our nation, stain our function,
leese our faculties, load our consciences, wrap our selves in censures, and
turmoile, if not agonize, the souls of our ghostly children, in breeding
doubts, whether their confessions made unto us, or hereafter to be made, be
good or no. On these mischiefs, great, and many, and very fearful, we must
wittinglie put our selves as is said, or prepare our patience to bear,
whatsoever it shall like our hard friends to advise, and your self to impose
upon us. Lamentable to remember how much the former glory and renown of our
english scholars and priests at Rome, are sithence the death of our blessed
Cardinal, eclipsed, or rather blotted, or rather then either, if we may so
say, defamed. Which evil hitherto outlandish and confined chiefly to that
place, begins now alas to creep hitherward apace, nay has already, found
large welcome in our realm, and gauled the reputation of Priests, impeached
the increase of Catholics, decayed the relief of prisoners, and raised the
like mutinies and debates in our country, as the general and Gods cause lies
groueling, amity pineth, peace droopeth, our adversaries rejoice, and
dissension and faction seem only to reign. Our good Lord for the infinitenes
of his mercy, guide and grant you good Father, the happiness to reform all,
and pardon the causers whosoever they be, that they feel not the smart of the
misdeede, in the reckoning of their last accounts. For conclusion, we appeal
honored sir, to the indifferency of your own thoughts, whether (these, and mo
of like agreiuance, which if we would, we could allege, being the adversities
of our present state) there be not greatest necessity of moving and
recommending this suit unto you, accounting the grant thereof, as we do, the
ablest mean of acquieting all differences, and of reducing us again to peace,
love, and union. Qui pacis ineunt consilia, sequitur eos gaudium, joy follows
the counselors of peace.

To take our leaves, we beseech you on our knees of pardon, loving Father, if
error in our understanding has misguided our pen in ought: for as for our
will, we do assure she is not accessarie, and we hope we carry the mind, what
decay soever other of late may note in us, that we would not wittinglie do the
thing, which our understanding shall give us to be unlawful. We misdoubted the
direct and lawful procurement of the authority upon more then pregnant
conjectures: we did morallie assure our selves, that it was not the
commandment of his Holiness: we eftsoone to our great charge, sent two of our
brethren to Rome, for understanding the full truth therein: we acquainted your
Reverence with our intent: we gave you a copy of such things, as we purposed
to move to his Holiness: we offered to obey you in the mean time, and did in
fact obey you, as by several particulars we can prove, though we deferred to
subject our selves absolutely unto you before receipt of notice from our
brethren or other canonical certeintie, that the authority was the ordinance
of his Holiness. When the Breue came, we by and by without any delay, submitted
our selves, labored our friends to do the like, showed our selves ready to any
service, and having bin almost infinitely wronged, as the particulars before
touched do in part declare, nevertheless for peace sake, and to make up union
again, we were content and willing to remit and forgive all that was past.
What could we do in reason, or out of reason, more then we did, and were most
desirous thereof, and now to have matters revived and prosecuted afresh against
us, what may our afflicted Church and our selves hope for, but to fall from
less quietness to less, if the sole cause of difference after this or by some
other good way be not removed and cut off? Which our all-mercifull God, through
the bleeding wounds of our sweet Savior, and the intercession of all our
english Saints, grant to the honor of his own name, and the weal of our
country. Fare you well most heartily, remaining obediently your Fatherhoods
children, who although we omit to subscribe our several names in respect ^^
the time, yet not unknown unto you by the imputed mark of schism.

AFter the receite of these, our Archpriest wrote an answer unto us, wherein
he did not only deny the grant of our foresaid petition, but threatened in the
manner as follows: If ever I can find^ In his letter of the 14. of March 1600
hereafter, that either by word or writing you justify your enormious
disobedience, as void of sin, this being a sign of want of grace, and
defense of sin, which is an high pride, and tending to the stirring up of new
tumults, and disturbance of our wished peace, I will suspend you from your
function, as not worthy to exercise the same. Hereupon, seeing our best
endeavors could receive no more favor from our Archpriest toward the removing
of the accusations, wherewith we were charged, we sent the state of the
question (taking this for the next remedy) to the University of Paris,
earnestly requesting that venerable company to give us their resolution in the
case. Who resolving it to be no schism, nor any sin in the nature of the
fact, our Archpriest presently upon the first notice of their censure,
published a decree, forbidding us under Of the 29. of May 1600.
pain of suspension from divine offices, and loss of faculties, to be
incurred in the fact it self, either to maintain, or defend, directly, or
indirectlie, in word, or writing, the said censure; and he likewise forbad the
Laity the same, under pain of being interdicted in like manner, that is, in
the fact it self.

Again not long after the said decree, his Reverence published an other of the
18. of October 1600. wherein he declared, that we had undoubtedly disobeyed
the sea Apostolic, and rebelled against his office, and did also therein
prohibit us and the Laity under the foresaid penalties, to defend the contrary
any manner of way whatsoever. Now what refuge was there left unto us, save only
to fly to his Holiness by way of appellation, and by laying down unto him the
particulars of our agreiuances? which our Archpriest rejected, allowing it but
in the behalf of one only, whose faculties he had taken away before. Further,
when his Reverence had thus wronged us, and also suspended, interdicted, and
dispossessed some ten of us of our faculties, Master Mush not many weeks
before he began his voyage to Rome, sent the conditions following to Master
Doctor Bauine the senior assistant, to the end that thorough his mediation and
furtherance, they might the sooner be accepted of by our Archpriest, and all
matters accorded.

The first condition.
THat our Archpriest with his Assistants, and the fathers of the Conditions of
attoneme^t offered by Master Mush.
Society, would be content to declare by a public instrument, that our
forbearing to admit the new authority before the arrival of his Holiness
Breue, was no schism, nor any such disobedience, but that we, notwithstanding
the same, might lawfully and with safe conscience celebrate divine mysteries,
and minister sacraments.

The second.
That his Reverence would make known by some common letter, that who soever
hereafter should renew this controuesie, he was and ought to be taken by all
men for a seditious person, and enemy to our churches peace, and the common
good of the Catholic cause.

The third.
That after the aforesaid two public declarations, our Archpriest would
restore every one to his former state and faculties.

The fourth.
That his Reverence would likewise be content that what Priest soever should be
accused, either to himself, or to any of his Assistants, or informed against
for any crime or misdemeanor, he the said Priest should not be condemned, nor
any way punished, before he were found guilty of the fault by just trial, and
personally heard to answer for himself.

The fifth and last.
That his Reverence would recall all his penal decrees, and not make any
hereafter, the burdens of the time considered, without urgent necessity, and
with the advice of eight or six of his Assistants, which conditions as
reasonable as we took them to be, either did displease, or not content,
because we received no answer unto them.

And now having thus signified how matters passed between us, we leave the
discrect reader to judge whether side in their actions have showed greater
desire of peace: we who received the wrongs, and did both pardon them, and
offered several conditions of reuniting our selves, or they who doing the
injuries, never made profer of reconciliation; nay sued unto, did exact such
kind of submission at our hands, as without defaming our selves unjustly, and
deadly belying our souls, we could not yield thereunto. And that these may not
appear bare words, without particular proof, we will here verbatim rehearse
both the declaration that our Archpriest made touching M. Drury, and the form
he sent him, wherein and how he should submit himself, and acknowledge his
guiltiness.

Vniuersis Catholicis Anglis Salutem. That is, To all english Catholics
greeting.
THese are to give you to understand, and are to declare, that Master Robert
Drurie Priest, has incurred the pains of suspension, and of the loss of all

his disobedient breach and contempt of my fourth and ^ifth penal decrees

The English.
IN. do confess and acknowledge to have complained upon no just cause of the
greeuances, and exceeding great mass of injuries imposed upon me, by the most
Reverend Archpresbiter, and to have laid the fault on him, of the discord,
tumults, and civil dissentions, and to have transressed certain wholesome
decrees of his, for all which I humbly ask pardon, and the restitution of
faculties, and absolution from Censures, if I have incurred any, and do revoke
all the former, and very heartily wish, that these things had never bin spoken,
or written, or approved by me. Moreover I swear, that I will carry my self
hereafter peaceably, and obedientlie, toward the said my Superior, and in
regard of my duty, procure so much as in me shall lie that others do the same.

THe disobedient breach and contempt which our Archpriest objected against
Master Drury was, for that he aue his name to an These two branches of the
decree are set down page 191.
Appeal to his Holiness, without acquainting his Reverence therewith before,
and without his license; and because he by appealing presumed to defend the
disobedience that was imputed to such as refused to admit the subordination
upon sight of the Constitutiue Letter. Two great offenses comparable to the
saying of a Pater noster, and touching the former. One and the first of the
six Articles St^p^etonus de tribus Tho nis p. 36. Quadrilogu^ lib. 5. ca. 8.
Surius in vita eius Matheus Parisiensis pa. 135.
in which Saint Thomas of Canterbury resisted the Constitution of King Henry
the second, was, Quod non appelletur ad sedem Apostolicam sine licentia Regis:
That no appellation be made to the Sea Apostolic, without license of the King.
Which gainestanding of Saint Thomas was counted so little a fault in him, as he
was Canonized for the fact, and God himself proved his virtue by testimony of
most glorious and infinite miracles. Our Archpriest decreed, that none under
pain of suspension, interdiction, and of losing their faculties, ipso facto,
should give their names or suffrages See page 216.
in any cause whatsoever, unless he did before make his Reverence privy
thereunto, and had his assent, comprehending under the clause [ of any cause
whatsoeuer] appeals to Rome, as himself interprets the words in his common
letters to his assistants, and makes the same most evident, in this his fact
of declaring Master Drewry to have fallen into the said Ecclesiastical
penalties, by his subscription to the pretended appeal. Stapleton in the life
of the former Saint, affirms, that the abouenamed Constitution substituted
the King in the place of the Pope, by attributing that power unto him, which is
proper to the Pope, and that it expressly contradicted the general Council
of Cap. 7.
Sardis, and takes away from that sacred consistory the pontificiall primacy
which was given to Peter by our Savior, and to those that should succeed him
to the worlds end. Which if it be true, as we are sure our Archpriest will not
deny, what can be less inferred, then that his said decree and declaration
does by so much the worse, and the more unworthily violate the rights of
Ecclesiastical liberty, above King Henry's Constitution, by how much the
office and person of an Archpriest, is inferior to the state and royal
sovereignty of a King, because the presumption of violating such preroatiues,
takes his degrees of deformity from the parties state and condition, who
let not to decree and publish such prohibitions to the prejudice and
infringing of the said Ecclesiastical rights and liberties? But of this matter
we have spoken before in our fourth Reason, where it is showed, that not only
the makers of such laws or Constitutions, but those that shall use or judge
according to the injustice of them, are excommunicated in the Bull of Coenae
Domini.

Concerning the other offense, for which our Archpriest declared Master
Drewry, who had long before, even at the first coming of the Cardinals letter,
most absolutely subjected himself to his authority, to have incurred the
foresaid censures and penalty, viz. for that by putting his name to the
Appeal, he adjudged him to maintain the disobedience objected. We hold it
also for no greater fault (admitting the subscription of his name to the
Appeal, were a defense of the disobedience pretended, as we do no way see, how
it could be) then 3. q. 1. Nulli dubium. Let such of our brethren well note
this place, as believed in their conscience we had wrong, and would not for
fear give their helps toward the redress, either by appealing with us, or by
manifesting their opinion for the better resolution of the doubtful.
is the doing of a good deed, and perhaps of bounden charity, according to
this saying of Pope Alexander, recorded in the Canons, Qui ex vestro collegio
fuerit and ab auxilio vestro se substraxerit magis schismaticus quam sacerdos
esse probabitur: He that is of your college or coat, and shall withdraw
himself from assisting you, does therein more approve himself to be a
schismatique then a priest. By which it appears, how vndeseruingly our
Archpriest inflicted his punishments, and how unconscionably contrary to all
truth and justice, he would have us in our submission to belly and defame our
selves. For it is to be noted, that this form of submission, or injurious
condition of release, was not sent to Master Drury alone, but the same was
exacted also of Master Mush, when he wrote to the Archpriest for the
restoring of his faculties, and of us all, especially of my self, when Master
John Benet upon direction from father Parsons, labored to compose the
dissension (into whose hands at that time as himself can witness, I committed
my whole particular, for him to make what end he thought sit, so willing I was
of peace, howsoever our Archpriest held me therein auerted:) which manner of
proceeding and exaction, so greatly distasted Master Benet, as whereas before
he would not grant to set his name to the Appeal, he then presently gave his
consent thereunto, saying; that he now saw no hope of compounding the
controversy by any other more peaceable mean then by appellation. The Prophet
writes, Erit opus iustitiae pax, Peace shall be the Esaias. 32.
work of Justice. And the Evangelists do note unto us, that our Savior stood
in the midst of his Disciples, when he said Pax vobis, Luke. 24. and John. 20.
Peace be unto you, signifying thereby that indifferency begets, and
continues peace. A virtue which our Archpriest has not hitherto much
observed, but rather showed himself ever most partial between the Jesuits
and us, as the particulars before going do convince: and so also may the words
which he used to me, at my last speaking with him, to wit, that whatsoever we
should say, or do against the Jesuits, he would take the same to be done as to
himself. Which considered, the nature of their injuries done against us, and
how little they seem to incline to satisfy, or desist from increasing of
them, may easily appear, and ^^stly put us in despair of enjoying peace, so
long as his Reverence holds his place and opinion. Our good Lord turn all
things to his honor.

To fold up the whole discourse, we do, and ever did very certainly assure our
selves upon the reasons afore-going, that our deferring to receive the new
authority, was lawful before God and man, as either commanded, or directed
by the Canons of holy Church, and not repugnant to the doctrine of any good
writer, ancient or modern. Idle therefore and ungrounded, are the exceptions
which our oppositors pretend, and the slanders they have raised of us (or if
they will not have ignorance to diminish their fault, the calumniations) toto
exorbitant, and excessive. Wherefore we hope, they will make us satisfaction,
especially for the temporal losses, that have directly accrued unto us by such
their defamations: and more, through the wrongful taking away of our
faculties. They know the Reg. 4. de reg^ur. li. 6.
rule of the law, the same Ad Macedoniu^ epist. 54.
being the maxim of Saint Austen: Peccatum non dimittitur, nisi restituatur
ablatum: The sin is not remitted, except what is taken away be restored, and
satisfaction made, where D. Tho. 22. art. 2. and 4.
there is ability of the domages incurred. And they know also, that Ibidem
art. 8.
restitution implies a negative precept, and consequently Ibidem 2^. q. 35.
art. 2. c.
that it binds them to make the same forthwith. Neither are they ignorant
that this right of satisfaction Siluester verb. Papa nu. 16.
being contained under the first conclusions of the law of Nature, remains
vndispensable by any power upon earth: so that knowing to what they are bound,
our demand and affiance is, that they will discharge the bond, and not as
witting offenders, deserve to be beaten with many stripes. They have the Luke.
12.
whole realm and a great part of the Christian world to their lookers on, and
therefore it would undoubtedly redound to their obliquie, and scandalize not a
few, if they should make no satisfaction for so grievous injuries and
detriments.

It has bin proved once or twice before, that the prorogation of Page 85. 86.
and 238.
yielding our obedience to M. Blackwell, was neither disobedience against his
Holiness, nor the Cardinal, nor against himself, notwithstanding the contrary
assertion of our adversaries, and the laying of a much fouler crime to our
charge; a crime, which for the object, or noblest good it impugneth (being the
D. Tho. 22. q. 39. ar. 2. Note the grieuousnes of our defamation.
unity of Gods Church his Dove and spouse) is worse then theft, adultery,
murder, or patricide, and worse then the most detestable outrage that can be
committed against our neighbor. We of purpose omit here to refute the
unworthiness of the imputation, because his Holiness himself has given sentence
against the same, and not only cleared our delay from the accusation of schism
and enormious disobedience, but from all kind of disobedience. And verily we
cannot but greatly marvel, how possibly so many of our adversaries, carrying
the reputation of learning and judgment, could conspire in so great an error,
unless the wisdom of God thought it fit for some cause to humble them, or
check the high opinion which many carry of their worthes, to the disgrace, if
not to the contempt of others their fellow-laborers, and perchance of equal
deserts with them, in the work they jointly have in hand. Obstinate
disobedience (and without D. Tho. 22. q. 39. art. 1.
obstinacy, there can be no schism) may be considered three manner of ways,
either against the thing commanded, or the person commanding, or against the
office of the commander, in not recognizing him for his Superior. And this
later kind of rebellion only makes the crime of schism, as Ibidem ad 2.
Saint Thomas, and all his Caiet. ibidem and in summa verb. excommunicatio. 7.
Banues ibide^ Valentia Tho. 3. dispu. ^ 3. q. 15. punct. 1.

par. tit. 13. Siluester verb. schisma ante nu. 1.
Summists do witness.

Hence it follows demonstrably, if our refusal to receive Master Blackwell
to our Archpriest, did, or could any way possibly make us schismatics, that
the only and principal cause of such our refusal, was, and of all necessity
must needs have bin, for that the Pope (note our words) or the Cardinal by
his commission, had (instituting the subordination) appointed him for our
Superior: which how far it was and is from all truth, let our sending to Rome
declare; let the protestations we made in our first letters, that the least
canonical notice, which should come from his Holiness, should presently stint
all disputes, and Page 269.
find us readily obedient in what soever: let our often repeated demand, and
continual insisting for a Breue, Bull, or other Papal instrument, Page 255.
for testimony of the Institution: let our prompt and real yielding of our
obedience unto Master Blackwell so soon as his Holiness Breue arrived: let
other our several actions and conclamations bear witness, decide, and denounce
to the whole world, whether we refused to receive him, because the Pope
appointed him Archpriest, or for the reasons alleged in the discourse before.
Verily the paradox of our schism, seems so ridiculous, and childish, and
without all show of learning, judgment and sense, as we cannot think, but
that the opinion, especially the long maintenance thereof, was in the authors
poena peccati, the effect and punishment of sin past. And because there can
be no demonstration or argument made so clear, but that he who is disposed to
wrangle, may easily devise somewhat to reply upon, we think it most convenient
for the through satisfaction of all parties, to set down here a copy of the
Letter which our brethren wrote unto us of late, aduertising what his Holiness
had declared in the controversy.

To the Reverend Fathers in Christ, and our brothers, John Colington, Anthony
Heburne, and the rest of their associates.
VEry reverend Fathers and brothers in Christ, we have exhibited to the right
noble Cardinals Burgesius, and Aragone, (whom his Holiness has appointed for
arbitrators in our cause, men renowned for their knowledge in the laws, and
experience in all occurrences, and grateful unto all men for their sincerity)
the reasons whereby we were induced to defer our obedience to the Archpriest
before the receipt and coming of the Apostolical Breue. Which being signified
unto his Holiness upon the 11. of April, it pleased the right worthy* Cardinals
to signify unto us his Highness mind the same day, namely, that in regard of
that our foresaid delay, we were neither schismatiques, nor rebels, or
disobedient, and that those confessions which were made unto such priests, who
for these reasons deferred their obedience, were in full force, and ought in no
sort to be reiterated, except perhaps some other cause or let did happen, then
that which took his original from the former dilation. These things we have
therefore thought good to signify unto you, partly that many consciences might
be thereby satisfied, partly also that we might excite you unto all modesty,
charity, and humility, as well in writing, as in example. The conclusion is,
we have a most pious and merciful Father, and a most just Judge, neither have
we any cause to suspect, but that very shortly we shall recover our ancient
peace and tranquillity. Rome the 15. of April. 1602. Your Reuerences brethren
and humble servants in Christ,

John Cecil. Thomas Bluet. John Mush. Anthony Champney.



Harum literarum exemplar cum vtroque Card. reliquimus, qui, communicato cu^
sua Sanctitate negotio, responsum tulerunt, Sanctitatem suam velle and iubere
vt haec ad vos scriberemus.

A copy of these Letters was left by us with both the Cardinals, who
communicating the contents thereof to his Holiness, received answer that his
Holiness willed and commanded to write these unto you.

We hope none will think that either our brethren in Rome whose names are
subscribed, or our selves would devise or feign such a letter: and the same
being taken to be a true letter, we have a great hope, that our adversaries
will now change their opinion, and from henceforth call us no more the
contentious Priests, because D. Tho. 22. q. 38. art. 1. and Caieta. ibidem.
contention imports an alteration against the truth. And therefore our
standing in the maintenance of truth and our good names against them, cannot be
called contention in us (being a thing D. Tho. and Caieta. vbi supra and
Valentia T. 3. disp. 3. q. ^4. punct. 2.
laudable and 12. q. 1. Nolo. D. Tho. quodl. 10. q. 6. art. 13. Nauar. t. 1. in
cap. inter verba. 11. q. 3. concl. 2. nu. 15
obliging) but in them only who so injuriously oppugned both truth,
ecclesiastical order, and our good names.

Likewise the adverse part obiecteth scandal unto us, but with less color of
pretense, then it imputes contention. For he that can be said to scandalize,
must have (as 22. q. 34. art. 1. ad. 4. and art. 3. Caieta. and Banues ib. de^
Valentia To. 3. dispu. 3. q. 18. punct. 1.
Saint Thomas and all his expositors do uniformly teach) either a formal and
express intention to draw others into sin, or do an act which of his proper
nature entiseth to sin: or thirdly (which is called scandal by accident) do
an act whereat others take scandal, albeit neither the nature of the act, nor
the intention of the doer, gave any such cause. Touching the first member of
the division, we are sure our adversaries will not say, that we had in our
deferring a formal intention to scandalize: and touching the second member, it
appears that our said deferring was not of his own nature induciue to sin,
because the same was no other then what the Canons command, or allow, as the
former reasons have showed, and as his Holiness by his late declaration has
made more manifest. It rests therefore, that if our said deferring occasioned
scandal, that is the spiritual ruin of others, it was merely through the
ignorance, or infirmity, or the malice of such as took scandal thereat. And
before this active scandal by accident can be imputed a sin to the giver, it
is of necessity (as all Divines agree, and common reason tells, for avoiding
many gross absurdities which otherwise would follow) that he Valentia vbi
supra puncto 2. and 4.
who this way is scandalized, must first note, or be bound to note, both that
another will take scandal at such his fact, and that himself be bound to
desist upon the same notice, or aduersion. Which two points and circumstances
our adversaries will never be able to prove to have concurred in the act of our
deferring. But of the other side, we little doubt, but that the condemnation
which they passed upon us for the said delay, and the great stirs, which by
the nature of such their actions have followed, have occasioned both many, and
most lamentable scandals.

Concerning the ambition wherewith some of us go charged by our adversaries,
we would know whether they accoumpt us void of all judgment: for if they do
not, how can they report us to be ambitious, when there is not scarce any one
of meanest understanding in our country, but knows, that no Englishman either
of the Clergy or Laity, can come to preferment in Rome, Spain, Flanders, or
any place where the Jesuits live, but only or chiefly by their mediation or
countenance? Yea, what Priest in England can come into credit with the
Archpriest, or hold so much of his favor as he possessed before, if the
Jesuits do not like well thereof? Also touching the future, none can be so
blind, as not to see, that the Jesuits affect, and hope to have the
distributing of promotions, and the ruling of all things, if our country
happen to turn Catholic. Of which hope and design of theirs, though there
be many other strong presumptions, yet none seem to conclude the same so
apparantlie, as does Father Parsons Babell, that is, his Castle in the air, or
book of Reformation, prescribing rules to all estates. So that our adversaries
knowing us voluntarily to have discontinued familiarity with the Jesuits, and
broken off all dependence on them, and nevertheless vpbraiding us with
ambition, they must needs take us to be very fools, not only in striving to
swim against the stream, but also desiring promotion, whereas we abandon all
the likeliest means of attayning thereunto. Or let these things plead for us
as they may, yet because my self by report am most condemned by name, for
traveling in the humor of seeking superiority, I must here crave a favorable
construction from the reader of my intents, for laying down the particulars
following, being enforced thereunto by the necessity of my own purgation.

When the sodalitie, or clergy association (so earnestly inueyed against, both
in the Letter of the six assistants to his Holiness Nunti^ in Flaunders, and in
several places of the Apology) was first intended to be erected, there were
of that company who labored me, that I would not refuse to accept of the
superiority: but can any one say, that ever I granted thereunto? Master
Standish, one of the chiefest promotors at that time of the said Sodalitie, and
whose testimony is freest from suspicion (being now become an adversary
thereunto) can witness no, and that I still insisted to have the Superior
chosen by two third parts of such, as should unite themselves for the
institution of the said Sodalitie. Again, to the end that the Superior might
this way be chosen, I named five or six ancient Priests, out of which the
election (as I thought might well be made; offering beside to contribute
largely toward the taking and furnishing of a house, for the use of the said
Sodality, so as they would exempt me, and make choice of an other.

Now if the precedent refusal and offer do not clear me of being desirous of
superiority, because the one may be interpreted for an external show of
humility only, and both dissembled by me, to the end to draw them the more
cunningly onward to the continuing of their purpose, of making me the
superior: yet surely the speeches which I used to Master Blackwell himself
about the same matter, will (I hope) free me with all men. Not long before the
instituting of the new authority, Master Blackwell dealt earnestly with me,
that I would desist from making or furthering any innovation through the
erecting of the Sodalitie, affirming, that it argued an ill affected humor in
me, to entreat others (for so he said, he understood that I did, though in
truth it was not so) to be of the Sodalitie, whereof my self was designed the
head. Whereupon, I then presently gave him my word to be his bondsman, if ever I
accepted thereof; and yielded him hearty thanks for his speeches, as having
given me a sufficient cause by them, to deny all my friends for ever taking
upon me the office, by how many soever the same might be importuned, and laid
upon me: which I trust is so plain and sincere a disproofe of that which is
imputed unto me, as it can admit no exception.

Moreover, when Master Bishop and Master Charnock were resolved to go to Rome
for giving his Holiness to understand what kind of government the Cardinal
Protector had instituted in our country, and how inconvenient the same was in
many respects, and withal to manifest unto him the lack of Bishops, which our
younger Catholics had for the ministering of the sacrament of Confirmation; and
how greatly that benefit was desired by many, I requested Master Bishop, that
if they should win his Holiness to grant Bishops, that in no sort he would
name me for any, assuring him, that if I thought he would, I should neither be
willing he went the journey, nor would contribute a penie thereunto. To speak
yet more foolishly, finding my self not so strong as I did desire against all
such temptations, and willing to strengthen my self more, I enjoined my self
a years penance (as the day of Judgment will declare) for the better subduing
of them, which spiritual task I performed, and found (God be ever thanked for
his infinite mercies) long before the penance expired, that holy fear and
hatred of like dignities, as I would not, nor I hope yet will stoop to the
ground to take up the best Bishopric in the Christian world with the charge.
Small reason therefore had our Archpriest to write as he did of me, and to
diuulge the copy of his letter, namely, that I was a man clowded in my
understanding, if not In his Letter to Master Hebborne of the 2. of March.
1599.
cloyed about my heart with too many fumes of ambition: And as little cause
also have many others (who percha^ce less know me) to prattle and enlarge
their backbitings of one, as they do.

Further, if there be any Priest, or lay person in England, with whom, at any
time I have conferred about deriuing Superiority to my self, let him not spare
to publish whatsoever I said unto him: but I think there is not that creature
living which can charge me with any such matter.

Of the otherside, if either Father Parsons or our Archpriest wrote the
Epistle of pious grief (as few doubt but one of them did) it is strange to see
the praises they deliver of them selves. And as for Father Parsons it is noted,
that he writes no book, discourse, nor scarce any letter of these stirs,
wherein he does not make mention of the Colleges he erected, or recount some
other good act of his own. Amongst many, the man is thought to be ill
neighbored, in that he is thus driven to praise himself, and few do think it
religious modesty, to farse books with their own commendations, and to set
them forth in other men's names: an exercise, that never any Saint or humble man
practiced. By which course of his, and some other of his dealings it is
vehemently suspected, lest he direct his labors to the making of himself
popularly famous, and prepare the way to a Cardinals hat.

By the erecting and managing of the Colleges, he comes to have store of
money for every expense, which otherwise he was like to fail of, nor could he
spend five or six crowns a week (as by credible relation he does) in postage
for Letters only. Again, the same employment and care of his in erecting and
providing maintenance for the Colleges, serves his turn for living in places
of concourse, here, there, and every where, but in a college of his order. A
liberty, which himself many years since so heartily desired, as he persuaded
some Priests to write to his General, how greatly it concerned the common
cause, and the good of our whole Nation, that he occupied himself in the
affairs thereof, and lived abroad in the world, where the doing of most good
should demand his presence. Moreover, by this opportunity, and by having the
Colleges under his own government, he inioyeth fittest means of picking out
the finest wits of our Students, and furnishing his own Society with them. A
service not ungrateful, and which increases his reputation with the General,
and other chief persons of the Society. In brief, through these means also,
and for that he presumes to be able to do much (poor man that he is) in
making our next King or successor to her Majesty, he gets acquaintance with
men of State, Princes, and Kings, and enters conference with them about the
same. An affair of no small contentation to the outward man (whom he is
thought not as yet to have fully cast off) and as potent and forward a help, as
ordinarily any can be, of working his own advancement, and of gaining a
scarlet cap. These, and other like respects are suspected to be the ends his
travels tend unto, and the cause of such a suspicion, seems doubtless to be
strong. For if he sincerely intended the good of our Church, and the increase
of learning, he would not have dealt with one of the ancientest Priests of our
Nation, about the dissoluing of the College at Reames, nor would he have
suppressed the Lectures of the College at Doway, whereby in short time,
through the discontinuance of the study, and practice of schole divinity, we
shall have no one of our secular Clergy fit to read, or grounded in the
faculty, but all esteem and helps that way, must come from the Jesuits, a
great honor to them, and dishonor to our Clergy. Further if Father Parsons
affected to have our Seminary Priests learned (a thing more requisite in the
secular, then in the Religious) neither he, nor any other Iesuit-Rector of the
Colleges, would send away the young Priests (if they resolved not to be
Jesuits, or did not show themselves zealous for them) before the finishing of
their whole course. Neither would they upon dislike, turn sufficient able wits
for the study of schole doctrine, to positive divinity. In few words, if the
credit of secular Priests, or the good of many were sought for, and not rather
the drawing of all things to the Jesuits more special reputation and
advancement, how could Father Parsons, and some other English Jesuits, make a
Monipolium, engrossing all things into their own hands, so much as no Priest
in our country, can send over his friend (how perfectly soever he know him to
be fit) to any of the Colleges, except the Jesuits be the mean and doers
thereof, or one other, whom they most absolutely direct, or rather rule, as
the master does the servant? Undoubtedly this was not the custom whiles good
Doctor Allen was President, nor yet whiles he lived Cardinal: and if such
policies, and seeking to sway all things (this latter being a demonstration of
highest ambition) do long stand, or redound to the authors credit in the end,
many are mistaken, who rather fear these sayings of holy scripture to be
thereby the sooner exemplified: Comprehendam sapientes in austutia eorum, and
deposuit potentes de sede and exultauit 1. Cor. 3. Luke 1.
humiles: God will comprehend the wise in their own wiles, and put down the
mighty from the seat, and exalt the humble.

An other thing, which the Author of the Apollogie obiecteth against Fol. 99.
me in particular, and whereof our Archpriest also would make In his Letter to
me vndated, beginning, Sir, I admonish you to reflect, etc.
a hard prognostication, is for that I had left the religious order of the
Carthusians. No doubt they carry a good will to discredit me, and the term,
scope, drift of the exception, do make it evident. Yea, some of their special
favorites (whom I can name) have so earnestly labored to wound me for this
cause in the conceits of my best friends, as they have spared no persuasion to
withdraw their affection and good opinion from me. The Apollogie affirms,
that Master Mush returning Vbi supra.
into England, and the Cardinal soon after dying, he joined with an other of
his own humor, that had left an other religion, namely the Carthugeans, and
they two with some few other determined to make a new Hierarchy of their own,
calling it an association of Clergy men with two Superiors as it were
Archbishops, the one for the South, and the other for the North. The untruths
that abound in the Apollogy, are very many, equal to the number of the leaves,
or perhaps of the pages, if not exceeding either. Amongst which rabble, the
passage recited, hudleth up four fayles in one. For neither did Master Mush
after his return into England join himself with me, neither did we two with
some few others, determine to make the Hierachie mentioned, and less to make
the same with two Superiors, and least of all, to make these two Superiors as
it were Archbishops, the one, for the South, the other for the North. The
falcitie of every member of this quadrible auowance, appears manifest in this
only, for that I never saw Master Mush nor he me, nor had any conference each
with other by letters, or messengers after his arrival from Rome, until some
fortnight before the coming over of his Holiness Breue in confirmation of the
Arch-priests Authority, more the^ tweluemonths after the first institution
thereof. So that, neither seeing Master Mush, nor having any corresponde^ce
with him, nor he with me, during the whole time that the association was in
speech, nor in many years before, how can it be said with any truth, that he
joined with me, or that we two determined to ordain a new Hierarchy with two
Superiors, and these to be as Archbishops? Further, so many as ever heard me
talk of the Sodalitie, or association intended, knew that none in England more
misliked the making either of two Superiors, or of certain other ordinances
then my self, and therefore the error was very great in affirming that we
joined in that, wherein we were most contrary. But to let these pass, and come
to the maine point.

I confess that I verily thought to have bin a Carthusian, and was in
probation with them full near eleven months: I acknowledge further, that I
resolved on that state of life in the exercise under father Cullume the Jesuit
then resident in Louane, when I was about some three or four and twenty years
old. But what, did I ever make a vow of religion, or was otherwise obliged by
any law of God, or man, to continue that state? No, my vpbrayders, nor any
other whosoever can say it. For what cause then do they lay this as a reproach
unto me? Was my conversation misliked during my being with them, or was I put
from them? I hope none will be so impudent as to auerre it, there being some
living at this day, who can witness that the Prior was heartily grieved for my
departure. What then was the cause why I did not continue? I may allege
sickness, for that I was long sick in the order, and so remained after, till I
was Priested, and returned to England. Likewise I may allege a mighty
oppression of sleep, not remoueable by any means that could be wrought or
thought on* But neither of these impediments moved me to leave the order. I
could never learn to sing nor tune six notes, although I had during my stay
with them, the change of six teachers, so little willing was the Prior and the
Couaunt to leave me. Father Slade, one that had bin of the Queens Chapel,
and taught the Countess of Oxford to sing, was my last teacher, and who after
long pains and trial, delivered my unaptness to the Prior in these terms,
That he could teach a Cow to bellow in tune, as soon as me to sing in tune.

Further, my state of body, and unaptness to sing was such, that two of the
Senior Monks of the house, advised me to content my self with an other state
of life, namely, to take Priesthood and go into England: Yea, Father Cullume
who was privy to all the motions that induced me to make choice of the
Carthusian life (which was chiefly my impediment of speech, for that I thought
my self thereby fitter for a contemplative, then an active life) wrote me a
Letter, persuading me (understanding the difficulties I traveled in, by
relation of others, and not from my self) to come forth, and betake my self
to some other state of life.

Now this being the truth, what cause has father Parsons, or our Archpriest
to twite me with leaving the Carthusians? Verily if father Parsons were the
setter down of this exception against me in the Apology, and that the same
was not added to the copy by father Garnet or Master Blackwell (the overseers
of the work, and unto whom father Parsons gave authority to add, and
detract what they thought good therein) I wish that he would remember the
speeches which himself used to me in Roane, and thereupon correct his bad
nature. For there, falling in talk with me after my banishment, he told me, he
understood, that I had some motion of entering into Religion, a course which he
thought not good for me, because he had learned how much I was inclined, and
cumbred with melancholy, and therefore advised me not to change my state of
life. So that for him to except in so spiteful a manner against me, for not
perseuering in that state of life, the like, which himself dehorted me from,
and gave his reason for the same, argues both the want of good nature in him,
and of honesty. But their anger being showed, let us see how Divines, and the
Canonists censure the case. Saint Thomas 22 q. 189. art. 4. ad 1m.
writes, Melius est intrare religionem animo probandi, quam penitus non
intrare, It is better, or of more merit, to enter into religion, with a mind
to make trial thereof, then not at all to enter. Which if it be true, as no
approved author denies, then why does Father Parsons, Master Blackwell, and
some other of their accomplices, impute my fact a fault unto me, when Saint
Thomas (received of all men in the same) prefers the doing before the
omission, or the not doing thereof. If they reply, that they do not blame, or
vpbrayde me for making trial, and entering into religion, but for that I did
not remain still in it: I ask them, what they count my discontinuance? sin,
or no sin: and if sin, what sin? Pope Gregory the eight defines the
question in this sort Ca. statuimus de regul.
Statuimus nouitios in probatione positos ante professionem emissam, ad priorem
statum redire posse libere infra annum: We decree, that Nouices in their
probation, before they be professed, may freely return to their former state
within the year. Freely, that is, as Panormitan Ibidem nu. 2.
and Verbo. reiigio. 5. nu. 8.
Siluester expound the word, sine licentia petita ab aliquo, without asking
leave of any one. And Caietane In 22. q. 189. art. 4.
writing of this point, says, Annus probationis a iure conceditur cum
liberate exeundi sine aliqua causa, The year of probation is granted by the
law with freedom to go forth without rendering of any cause. This, without
all question, is most true in the exterior court, and in face of the Church;
but how does the same hold in the tribunal of conscience, and before God?
Saint Thomas Vbi supra ad 2.
auerreth, Quod ille qui religionem ingreditur si exeat ex rationabili causa,
facit quod est licitum ei facere: That he who enters into religion, and goes
out again upon a reasonable cause, does that is lawful for him to do. And
Siluester Vbi supra.
writes somewhat plainer in that case, Qui solum proposuit perseuerare non
vouendo, potest intra annum ad saeculum redire, de iure quo ad ecclesiam, and
sine peccato quo ad Deum, si redeat ex iusta causa: Who only proposes to
persevere in religion without vowing it, may within the year lawfully return
to the world, as far as concerns the Church, and without sin before God, if
he come forth upon a just cause. Nor is the act of such his coming forth
scandalous, as both Vbi supra.
Saint Thomas and Caietane testify, and the later of the two teaches further:
Ibidem.
Ingressus religionem si ex sola liberate retrocedat, venialiter tantum
peccat. He that entered into religion, making no vow thereof, and afterward
goes out again upon no greater cause then for that he has a will thereunto,
sins no more then venially.

Now it only remains to know what is a reasonable and just cause, since no
Divine but holds, that it is lawful for any Nouice during the time of his
probation, to alter and discontinue his purpose, of being religious, upon a
reasonable and just cause. Vbi supra.
Saint Thomas, Caietane, Siluester, and others, give debilitie or weakness of
body for instance of a just cause. Which if it be so, as I think my
discreditors will not gainesay, then the same cause concurring, as it did in
amplest manner, in respect I was not only some months sick in the order, but
so continued a year and more after, and did not recover, until I had bin some
while in England. Yea it was misdoubted, least my disease, being an agew with a
swelling, and voyding blood at my mouth, would in short space have ended my
life, if I had continued fish diet, as of necessity remaining in the order, I
must have done. Nevertheless, neither this, or any other weakness, or
mightiest oppression of sleep, was the chief cause, whereupon I left the
order, but my unaptness, or truer, the impossibility, I traveled in for ever,
learning to sing, was that, which most of all discomforted me to tie my self,
because being professed and Priested, I was bound by the rules of the religion,
to sing Mass, when my week came by turns, and lightly some verse alone,
which I could never attain to. This was the principal let, this the cause,
which I took, and so did Cardinal Allen of good memory, Doctor Stapleton,
Father Cullume, with others, to be a most reasonable and just cause, or rather
an enforcing compulsion of leaving that holy and most religious order. The
Apostle Romans 11.
writes, Quis cognouit sensum Domini? Who has known the purpose of our Lord?
I hope he inspired the motion whereupon I made the trial, and I trust also it
was not against his good pleasure nor ingratitude, or inconstancy in me
(finding my self unfit to proceed) to leave the same, after trial and
experience made of my disabilitie. To conclude, whatsoever my vpbrayders are
pleased to write or report of me, I would not for a million (looking upon the
inferior and second causes of things) but that I had changed my purpose,
considering that by my return into England, my father, brothers and sisters
became all Catholics, which morally otherwise, was unlikely, and most of them
have sithence endured imprisonment for the cause, and my father ended his life
in Gloucester ioale for the same. Again since that time, which is now seven and
twenty years past or thereabouts, I have felt that incombrance of melancholy,
as God knows, what effect it would have wrought in me, if I had bin
sequestered from company, and lived a solitary contemplative life: Whosoever
therefore does, or shall mislike me, for that I left the Carthusians order, I
hope to bear his, or their aduersions with patience, if not with contentment.

Thus having yielded the reasons of our delay, and answered all the objections
of moment that our adversaries allege, we surcease, submitting the whole to
the censure of the Catholic Church, and heartily desiring the Reader to
inform himself of the truth without partiality.
