A complaynt of them that be to soon married,

For as much as many folk there be
That desire the sacrament of wedding
Other will keep them in vyrgynye
And will in chastyte be living
Therefore I will put now in writing
In what sorrow these men led their lives
That to soon be coupled to cursed wives
NOw am I in great myschefe and sorrow
To soon I put my body in gage
I live in care / night / even / and morrow
Little lacks that I ne enrage
To be to soon married I laid my gage
Cursed be the time that I it ever knew
The devil have his part of marriage
And of him that me first thereto drew
My heart right ill did me counsel
To a young woman me for to same
To soon wedde there they did me compel
Wherefore I hold my self in fame
By god I swear and by his name
I will all lovers clean dyscourage
That would not with there will take them a dame
And put them self in such damage
Better it were to be a man savage
Than to be take in that ylke lase
Gentell galauntes flee that passage
Beside that way look that ye pass
Go out of that way that will the chase
Go out of that way or ye be lost
Go ye therfro / turn ye your face
Go from that way to another cost
Go ye thense my friends I you pray
Go ye therfro I you do pray
Go ye from that hot flambe of fire
Go ye therfro as I you say
Or ye will repent an other day
Go ye therfro full loud I cry
Go ye fro the bond of welawaye
Which is the arc of all folly
Fle I pray you for gods sake
Fle this passage that is right dangerous
Fle ye from that peryllous lake
Of muddy mire so clam and comberous
Fle that dark place so myrke and tenebrous
Fle fro that ylke cursed temptacyn
I find it nothing auauntagyous
But it all tourneth in to perdycyon
Alas my brethren ye christian men
For god take ye in pacyence
To hear the sorrow that I in ren
For to acquyte my consyence
I require you in the reverence
Of the sweet vyrgyn mary
For to eschew all vnpacyence
Look to soon that ye not mary
The wise man us ensygneth and says
That none should other repreue
Of any vice / hurt / ill / or scathe
That they se of him morn or eve
I say it for I did my self meue
To learn to make plays Joyous
Keep him that will and me believe
For there may be many enuyous
Outragyous alas I did not think
Three times of that that I would do
But hastily I did me clynke
Unto my will and went thereto
Simple I was and humble also
Evil thought was not mine intent
Now have I for my labor lo
Anoye / thought / pain / and torment
Think thou now what it is of service
Think also what it is of franchyse
The seruytude of marriage
Before all other seruage lyse
All wise m^n does it despise
Let none take it nor other make
For it is the most fool enterprise
That any man may undertake
Take ye head where that ye go
Poor whystelers folysshe and sturdy
Be not assoted nor peuysshe also
So outragyus nor so hardy
That for one deed ne for a cry
Ye cast your self in such a snare
For ye shall not be wrynge nor wrye
Come out thereof therefore beware
Better ye were withouten harm
For to become a celestyne
A gray friar Iacopyn or a carme
An hermyte or a friar Austyne
Fle ye therfro / ye seek your fine
And the abregmente of your days
Wherefore do not your self enclyne
To enter with right and other ways
Man the wiche has no tytell
Nor seruytude by any sent
He is in his own frewyll
And at his good commandment
Man makes his auowe and talente
For all that god has him give
By no manner for to consent
For to bind him in seruytude to live
If thou know what charge it is
To take a wife and her to keep
So priest thou would not be ywys
At such a snare in for to crepe
Nor let thy self so to be yclepe
To be engloted in such a clyfte
Out of which thou may not pepe
Till that she be broke and ryfte
These relygyous maundiens
May well an other order take
So many chanons and dekenes
Officers their offices may forsake
None may ayenste them noise make
But we the which ben married
May nether mount nor yet down slake
So ben we in this point alyed
It is well knyte that is so bound
That no man can it undo
In wedding knote I have me found
That I counde not from it go
If I were lous no more there to
Would I return for so the certain
I read them that has been so
Beware and go not to it again
Certainly I will not blame
Marriage that god Instytued
But honor it wihouten grame
For the order should be worshypped
And I have me auaunced
Than I ought for to speak more
The charge to ill wives be deled
For I se ever each day wherefore
And for to give you for to wit
The pouerte that therein is found
I ought well to dysprayse it
For there I have be bound
Alas my work did little rebounde
And little befell to me than
Than to learn I did recounde
By my self or by some good man
I naught I wend that I had learned
I thought that I was full sage
But for all that I was clyked
As a bird is in a cage
That has nothing advantage
But as long as the cage may dure
In like wise I am in marriage
Enclosed needs I must endure
Endure I must who that nay says
For to endure I and constraynt
For I swear to you on my faith
The Joy that I make it is but faynte
I am so holden in fere and in craynt
That I am worse than dyseased
I am not come to that attaynt
That I thought in time passed
When that I was newely married
I had good time about three days
I was not chyddene haryed
I was fulfilled with love rays
I made gambandes / lepes / and plays
I held me neither nere ne far
But soon enough I had assayes
Of sorrow and care that made me bare
Rynnynge they came me to assail
On the other side right asprely
Full sore they made me to avail
Were it slepynge or wakyngly
Thought always was present me by
And yet before me made frontere
With them in their company
Great charge which bare the baner
About eight days or soon after
Our marriage the time for to pass
My wife I took and did set her
Upon my knee for to solace
And began her for to enbrace
Saying sister go get the time lost
We must think to labor a pace
To recompense that it has us cost
Than for despyte she up arose
And drew her fast behind me
To me saying is this the gloss
Alas pore caytyfe well I se
That I never shall have quod she
With you more than pain and turmente
I am in an evil degree
I have now lost my sacrament
For me be to long with you here
Alas I ought well for to think
What we should do within ten year
When we shall have at our heart brynke
Many children on for to think
And cry after us without fail
For their meat and their drink
Than shall it be no marvel
Cursed be the hour that I ne was
Made a none in some cloister
Never there for to pass
Or had be made some sister
In seruage with a clousterer
It is not eight days sithe our wedding
That we two together were
By god ye speak to soon of werkynge
But sir sithe it does you please
It pleases me as is reason
Your will does not me dysplease
It pleases me at each ceason
Ye be sir of this mansyon
And I am your chambere
I would feign find some enchesom
That lyenge deed I were on bear
Would to god that I were deed
Than should ye be quyte of me
In little while know you I did
And neither I perceive nor se
Ne know how that reason should be
That to me ye speak of that wyrke
By my soul I se at the eye
That of you I shall have but yrke
For god sir advise you well
That I did never business
In the house there as I did dwell
Many there were that put them in prese
Me for to love above excess
And yet I put them all away
Though they had much great richesse
No man but you was to my pay
Am I of such lygnage comen
For to have pain and great travail
I that was so derely holden
And never looked for none avail
No that thing should me prouayle
I was wont but to go and play
Dance and sing at each spousayle
And ye from me put all that away
Thanked be god ye have had of me
Of rich cheuaunce good and fair
Gold and silver great plente
Rentes and heritage you to prepayre
In all this country there is none air
Be ye never so rich of lynage
But he might of that affayre
Make rich all his parentage
I do not say that ye were dygne
To have one ten times better than I
Alas ye showed unto me sign
Of great grace wealth and curteysy
That when I herd any company
That spoke of you in any place
I had my heart rauysshed truly
For great pleasure and solace
when she had made her complaynt
Like an woman all an angered
She than seized under a faint
Full of sorrow and all be weped
The day and hour there she cursed
with a tryste heart wryngynge her hand
That ever she was nourysshed
For to espouse such an husband
when that I herd and understood
That the which she me reproched
I was abashed and still stood
And durst not to her be approached
Her tongue toward me was declyned
I wot not where that she had fysshte
The words that she there dysgorged
That I was feign to be whysshte
In this said dolorous song
I did me put for to have pease
Force it was in to be thronge
Yet went I not in with mine ease
But my wife me to dysplease
Abode not long for to perceive
The sorrow that did my heart peyse
where through she did deceive
Than came her mother to house
That found her how she was weeping
And soon she said my nowne sone dous
Why makes she that waymentynge
And said it was not her learning
To have her daughter so to be chydde
And that she had a perceiving
That I had her so an angered
By my faith said I good mother
Naught have I done nor her myssayde
Serve her I will as my sister
With good heart and will puruayed
For against her I nothing said
But that ways we must find
Us for to store and she me nayed
I wys she has to iyrse a mind
By god my fair sone you ne ought
So always for to threten her
For ywys she was never taught
For to work therefore dele softer
But she will do well here after
Wherefore speak no more I you pray
Never was I in such daungere
Wherefore I thank god night and day
Than comes her cosyns also
For to complysshe my passion
Her gosseps and her neighbors to
Semblynge like a prosessyon
God knew what desstruccyon
Drinking my wine all at their ease
All thing goes to perdycyon
Nevertheless I must hold my pease
To a feast they brought me on a day
About two or three mile hense
God knows what great Joy led they
Taking little intellygence
Her friends led her at mine expense
How that the game goes they ne care
I say that by experyence
It will make a man all threde bare
Now must they make a pilgrimage
To saint Lenarde or saint Laurence
For good they be for the great rage
That they have / as I may purpence
Who may than have any pacyence
For to se such derysyon
Trottynge always without resystence
And not kypynge their mansyon
Than must they have new habytes
Gowns and other a byllementes
Kings of of gold perles and cresolytes
Bedes and gyrdelles with long pendentes
I have nether house ne rentes
Whereon that I may live
A man with many such paymentes
May live long or ever he may thryue
wene ye that they take any keep
How that silver is spente anon
The devil brenne them on an hepe
Them and all their opinion
we give to them such abandon
Be they fair or be they foul
That we have therefore such guerdon
That we be caytyses be my soul
Almighty god give me suffraunce
For I am sore passyoned
with pain / sorrow / and dystourbaunce
As much as any man has suffered
But sithe I am thereto condemned
I thank our lord of paradyse
For thereto I am ordained
I se it is none otherwise
Considering that I ne may
Hyte / nor ho auaunte / ne arere
I wysshe my death every day
Hyde me I must never to appear
In donge stynkynge never to come here
Desiring death is my resort
Chowynge my bytte in this manner
without bydynge any comfort
You the which are clean acquyted
Pray ye for that pore caytyfe
The which is all dysheryted
And has yspended by his wife
His good that never in his life
Shall be rendered to him again
Wherefore I may with heart pensyfe
Cry out alas and thus complain
I make an end I live in great martyr
So do they that be to soon married
The thing that most of all I desire
Is that they be right well haryed
For by women men be so varyed
Each leseth his understanding
Wherefore I will that they be for prayde
That god give them sorrow everlasting
For such is my dyssynement
And will prove it before our lord
That women ben abusement
All about in play / strife / and board
To soon married may mete accord
Unto them would I or nay
I leave them here at this said word
And no more of them will I say
Right dear friends lovely I do you submite
Of my first work in to correccyon
But mine own will can not as yet
Endewe any thing of mine intencyon
Rather I will abide a little season
Than to put my wit before intellygence
Ventosyte must abide dygestyon
So I must do or I come to eloquence
Cunning must I have first of all
Or that I come to perseueracyon
Put forth I will and than somewhat call
Learning with good delyberacyon
And than I will with good intencyon
Note some works of god almighty
Desiring to come unto his regyon
Ever there for to dwell perdurably
Here ends a full doleful complaynte
Of many a man of there one concord
Lokynge with face pale wanne and faynte
Cursynge the time of their accord
Fynysssed and done the year of our lord
A thousand.CCCCC. and.xxxv. at London
