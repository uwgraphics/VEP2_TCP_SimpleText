The Plouumans tale compylled by sir Geffray Chaucher knight.

The prologue.
Here begins the Plowmans Prologue.
THe plowema^ plucked up his plowe.
When midsomer moan was come^ in
And said his beestes should eat ynow
And lige in the grass up to the chynne
They ben feeble both ox and cow
Of he m^nys left but bone and skin
He shoke of shere and coultre o^ drowe
And honge his harneys on a pynne.
He took his tabard and his state e^e
And on his heed he set his hat
And said he wolbe saint Thomas seek
On pylgremage he goth forth platte
In scrippe he bare both breed and lekes
He was forswonke and all forswatte
Men might have seen through both his chekes
And every wang toth and where it sat
Our host beheld well about
And law this man was sun ybrent
He knew well by his senged snoute
And by his clothes that were to rent
He was a man wont to walk about
He nas not always in cloystre ypent
He could not religeouslyche loute
And therefore was he fully shent.
Our host him axed, what man art thou?
Sir quod he) I am an hyne
For I am wont to go to the plowe
And erne my meat yet that I dyne
To sweet and swinke I make auowe
My wife and children therwyth to find
And serve god and I wist how
But we leude men been full blind.
For clerks say we shullen be feign
For her lyuelod swet and swynke
And they right naught us give again
Neither to eat ne yet to drink
The mow by law, as they said
Us curse and dampne to hell brynke
Thus they putten us to pain
With candles queynt and belles clyncke
They make us thralles at her lust
And said we mow not eles be saved
They have the corn and we the duste
Who speaks there again they say he raued
what man quod our host can thou preach
Come nere and tell us some holy thing
Sir quod he, I herd ones teach
A pressed in pulpyt a hood preachnyge
Say on quod our host, I the beseech.
Sir I am ready at your byddyng
I pray you that no man me reproach
While that I am my tale telling.
Thus ends the prologue, and here follows the first part of the tale.
A Stern strife is stered new
In many stedes in a stounde
Of sundry seeds that been sewe
It seems that some ben unsound
For some be great grown vngrounde
Some been souble, simple and small
Whether of hem is falser found
The falser foul mote him befall
That one side is that I of tell
Popes* cardynals and prelates
Parsons, monks, and freers fell
Priours, abbotes of great estates
Of heuyn and hell they keep the yeates
And Peter's successors they ben all
This is demed by old dates
But falshed foul might it befall
The other side ben poor and pale
And people put out of prease
And seem caytyffes sore a cale
And ever in one without increase
I clepeth lollers and lo^dlese
Who toteth on hem they been vntall
They ben arrayed all for the peace,
But falshed foul mote it befall.
Many a cou^treye have I sought
To know the falser of these two
But ever my trauyle was for naught
All so f^rre as I have go
(...) as I wrandred in a wro
In a wodde beside a wall
Tho fowls saw I set tho
The false foul mote him befall
That one did plede on the Popes side
A gryffon of a grimme stature
A Pellycane withouten pride
To these lollers laid his lure
He mused his matter in measure
To counsel Christ ever began he call
The gryffon showed as sharp as fire
But falshed foul mote it befall
The Pyllycan began to preach
Both of mercy and of meekness
And said that Christ so began us teach
And meke and mercyable began bless
The Euangely bears witness
A lamb he lykeneth Christ over al
In tokenynge that he mekest was
Since pride was out of heaven fall.
And so should every Christened be
Prestes, Peter's successourp
Beth lowlyche and of low degree.
And vsen none erthly honors
Neither crown, ne curious couetours
Ne pylloure, ne other proud pal
Ne naught to cofren up great treasours
For falshed foul mote it befall
Priests should for no cattle plede.
But chasten hem in charity
Ne to no bateyle should men led
For inhaunsyng of her own degree
Not wylne syttynges in hye see
Ne soueraynte in house ne hall
All wordely worship defye and flee
For who so wylleth highness foul shall fall
Alas who may such saints call
That wylneth weld erthly honor
As low as Lucifere such shall fall
In baleful blackenesse ybuylden her boure
That eggeth the people to error
And makes them to hem thrall
To Christ I hold such one traytrur
As low as Lucifer such one shall fall
That wylleth to be kings peers
And higher than the Emperor
Some that were but poor freers
Now woollen wax a warryour
God is not her governor.
That holds no man his permagall
While couetyse is her counsaylour
All such falshed mote need fall
That hye on horse wills ride
In glytterande gold of great array
I painted and portred al in pride
No commen knight may go so gay
Change of clothing every day
With golden gyrdles great and small
As boystous as it bear at bay
All such falshed mote need fall.
With pride punyshed the poor
And some they sustain with sale
Of holy church makes an hoar
And fylleth her womb with wine and ale
With money fylleth many a male
And chaffren churches when they fall
And tells the people a leude tale
Such false faytours foul them befall
With change of many manner meats
With song and solace syttyng long
And fylleth her womb, and fast fretes
And from the meat to the gonge
And after meat with harp and song
And each man mote hem lords call
And hot spyces ever among
Such false faytours foul hem fall
And myters mo than one or two
I perled as the queen's heed
A staff of gold, and pyrry lo
As heavy as it were made of lead
With cloth of gold both new and read
With gltterande gold as grene as gall
By dome will dampne men to deed
All such faytours foul hem fall
And Christ's people proudly curse
With broad book, and b^aying bell
To put pennyes in her purse
They woll sell both heaven and hell
And in her sentence and thou wylt dwell
They wyllen guess in her gay hall
And though the soth thou of hem tell
In great cursynge shall thou fall
That is blessed, that they bless
And cursed that they curse woll
And thus the people they oppress
And have their lord ships at full
And many be merchauntes of woll
And to purs penyes woll come thrall
The poor people they all to pull
Such false faytours full hem fall
Lords mote to hem loute
Obeysaunt to her broad blessing
They ryden with her royal route
On a courser, as it were a king
With saddle of gold glytteryng
With curyous harneys quayntly crallyt
Styroppes gaye of gold mastlyng
All such falshed foul it befall
Christ's mynisters clepen they been
And rulen all in robberye
But Antichrist they seruen clean
Attyred all in tyranny
Witness of John's prophecye
That Antichriste is her admiral
Tyffelers attyred in trecherye
All such faytours foul hem fall.
Who says that some of hem may sin
He shall be done to be deed
Some of hem woll gladly win All against that which god forbed
All holiest they clepen her heed
That of her rule is regal
Alas that ever they eten breed
For all such falshed woll foul fall
Her heed loves all honor
And to be worshypped in word and deed
Kings mote to hem knele and coure
To the apostles, that Christ forbede
To Popes hestes such takes more head
Than to keep Christ's commandment
Of gold and silver mote ben her wede
They holds him hole omnipotent
He ordayneth by his ordinance
To paryshe priests a powere
To another a greater auaunce
A greater point to his mistere
But for he is highest in earth here
To him reserueth he many a point
But to Christ that has no pere
Reserueth he neither opyn no joint
So seems he above all
And Christ above him nothing
When he sytteth in his stall
Dampneth and saves as him think
Such pride to fore god does stynke
An angel bad John to him not knele
But only to god do his bowynge
Such wyllers of worship must need evil feel
hey ne clepen Christ, but sanctus deus
And clepen her hedd Sanctissimus
They that such a sect sewys
I trow they taken hem amysse
In earth here they have her bliss
Her hye master is Belyal
Christ's people from hem wysse
For all such false will foul fall
They mow both bind and lose
And all is for her holy life
To save or dampne they mow chose
Between hem now is great strife
Many a man is killed with a knyfe
To wete which of hem have lordshyp shall
For such Christ suffered wounds five
For all such falshed will foul fall
Christ saed: Out glady^ percutit
With sword shall dye
He had his priests peace and gryth
And bad hem not dread for to dye
And bad them be both simple and slye
And carke not for no cattle
And trusts on god that sytteth on hye
For all false shall foul fall
These woollen make men to swear
Against Christ's commandment
And Christ's members all to tere
On roode, as he were new yrent
Such laws they make by commen assent
Each on it choweth as a ball
Thus the poor be fully shent
But ever falshed foul it befall.
They vsen no symonye
But sellen churches and prioryes
Ne they vsen no envy
But cursen all hem contraryes
And hyreth men by days and years
With strength to hold hem in her stall
And culleth all her adversaries
Therefore falshed foul thou fall
With purse they purchase personage
With purse they paynen hem to plede
And men of war they woll wage
To bring her enemies to the deed
And lords lives they woll led
And much take, and give but small
But he it so get, from it shall shede
And make such false right foul fall
They halowe nothing but for hyre
Church, font, ne vestment
And make orders in every shyr
But preistes pay for the parchement
Of riatours they taken rent
Therewith thy smere the ships sakll
For many churches ben often suspent
All such falshed yet foul it fall.
Some lives not in lecherye
But haunten wenches, widows and wives
And punysheth the poor for putrye
Them self it uses al their lives
And but a man to them shryues
To heaven come never he shall
He shall be cucsed as be captyues
To hell they said that he shall fall
There was more mercy in Maxemyen
And in Nero, that never was good
Than is now in some of them
When he has on his furred hoode
They follow Christ that shed his blood
To heaven, as buckette into the wall
Such wreches ben worse than wode
And all such faytours foul hem fall
They give her alms to the rich
To maynteynours, and to men of law
For to lords they woll be lyche
In harlottes son not worth an hawe
Soth fastenesse such han slawe
They kembe her crokettes with crystal
And dread, of god they have down draw
All such faytours foul hem fall
They maken parsons for the pennye
And canons of her cardynals
Uneaths amongst hem all any
That he ne has glosed the gospel falls
For Christ made never no cathedrals
Ne with him was no cardynall
With a Red hatte as vsyn mynstrals
But falshed foul mote it befall
Their tything, and her offering both
The^ clemeth it by possessyon
Thereof nyll they none forgo
But robben men as ransom
The tythynge of Turpe lucrum
With these masters is meynall
Tythynge of bribry, and larson
Will make falshed woll foul fall
They taken to ferme her sompnours
To harm the people what they may
To pardoners, and false faytours
Sell her seals I dare well say
And all to holden great array
To multiply hem more metal
They dread full little domes day
When all such shall foul fall
Such harlottes shull men dysclaunder
Aor they shullen make her gree
And ben as proud as Alexaunder
and said to the poor, woe be ye
By year each preeste shall pay his fee
To increase his lemmans call
Such heerdes shul well yuel the
And all such false shull foul fall
And if a man be falsely famed
And would make purgacyon
Than woll the officers be a gramed
And assyng him fro town to town
So need he must pay ransom
Though he be clean, as is crystal
And than have an absolution
But all such false shull foul fall
Though he be gyltie of the deed
And that he may money pay
All the while his purse woll blede
He may use it fro day to day
These byshopes officers gone full gay
And this game they vsen over all
The poor to pyll is all their pray
All such false shull foul fall
Alas, god ordained never such law
Ne no such craft of couetyse
He forbad it by his saw
Such governors mowen of god agryse
For all his rules is ryghtwyse
These new points ben pure papal
And gods law they dispyce
And all such faytours shul foul fall
They said that Peter had the key
Of heuyn and hell, to have and hold
I trow Peter took no money
For no sins that he sold
Such successors ben to bold
In wynnyng all their wit they wrall
Here conscience is waren cold
And all such faytours foul hem fall
Peter was never so great a fool
To leave his key with such a lorell
Or to take such cursed such a tole
He was aduysed nothing well
I trow they have the key of hell
Their master is of that place marshal
For there they dressen hem to dwell
And with false Lucifere there to fall
They ben as proud as Lucifarre
As angry, and as enuyous
From good faith they ben full far
In couetyse they ben curyous
To catch catell as couytous
As hounde that for hungre woll al
Ungodly and ungracious
And nedely such falshed shall foul fall
The pope and he were Peter's heir
^e think he erreth in this case
When chose of byshopes is in despair
To chosen hem in diverse place
A lord shall write to him for grace
For his clerk ano^e pray he shall
So shall he speed his purchase
And all such false foul hem fall
Though he can no more good
A lords prayer shall be spedde
Though he be wild of will or wood
Not understanding what men han read
A lend boster and that god forbede
As a good bishop is my horse ball
Such a Pope is foul be stead
And at last woll foul fall
He makes byshopes for erthlye thank
And nothing for Christ's sake
Such that been full fate and rank
To soil heal none head they take
Al is well done what ever they make
For they shall answer at one fors all
For worlds thank, such worch and wake
And all such false shall foul fall
Such that can nather Creed
With prayer shul be made prelates
Another can the gospel read
Such shul now welde hye estates
The hye gods frendshyp hem makes
They toteth on her sum total
Such bear the kyes of hell yates
And all such false shall foul fall
They forsake for Christ's love
Traueyle, hungre, thurst, and cold
For they ben ordered ever all above
Out of youth till they ben old
By the door they go, not in to the fold
To help their sheep they naught tarauall
Hired men all such I hold
And all such false foul hem fall
For Christ her king they woll forsake
And know him naught for his pouerte
For Christ's love they wol wake
And drink peyment ale aparte
Of god they seem nothing a^ferde
As iusty lives, as did Lamuall
And driven her sheep in to deserte
A^ such taytours shall foul fall
Christ has.xii. Apostels here
Now say they, there may be but one
That may not err in no manner
Who leueth not this ben lost echone
Peter erred, so did not John
Why is he cleped the principal?
Christ cleped him Peter, but him self chestone
All false faytours foul hem fall
Why cursen they the croysery
Christ's christen creatures
For between hem is now envy
To be enhaunsed in honors
And christen lyuers with her labors
For they leuyn on no man moitall
But do to death with dishonnurs
And all such false foul hem fall
What knows a tylloure at the plowe
The popes name and what he hate
His creed suffyseth to him ynowe
And knows a cardynal by his hatte
Rough is the poor vnryghtly latte
That knows Christ his god royal
Such matters be not worth a gnatte
But such false faytours foul hem fall
A king shall knele and kiss his show
Christ suffered a sinful to kiss his fete
Me thinks he holds him hye ynow
So Lucifer did, that hye set
Such one me thinks him self for yet
Either to the troth he was not call
Christ that suffered wounds wete
Shall make such falshed foul fall
They lays out her large nets
For to take silver and gold
F^llen coffers and sackes fetttes
There as they souls catch should
Her servants be to them vnhold
But they can doublyn their rentall
To bygge hem castles, and bygge he^ hold
And all such false foul hem fall
Here ends the first part of this tale, and herafter follows the second
part
TO accord with this word fall
No more English can I rynde
Show another now I shall
For I have much to say behind
How priests han the people pynde
As curteys Christ has me kind
And put this matter in my mind
To make this manner men amend
Shortly to shende hem, and show now
How wrongfully they worche and walk
O hye god nothing they tell, ne how
But in gods word, tells many a balke
In hernes hold hem and in balke
And preachin of tithes and offrende
And untruly of the gospel talk
For his mercy god it amend
What is Antichrist to say
But even Christ's aduersarye
Such has now ben many a day
To Christ's bidding full contrary
That from the troth clean warry
Out of the way they ben wend
And Christ's people untruly carry
God for his pytye it amend
That lyuen contrary to Christ's life
In hye pride against m^kenesse
Against sufferau^ce they vsen strife
And anger against sobrenesse
Against wisdom wylfulnesse
To Christ's tales little tend
Against measure outragiousnesse
But when god woll it may amend
Lordly life against lowlynesse
And demyn all without mercy
And couetyse against largess
Against truth treachery
And against alms envy
Against Christ they comprehend
For chastyte they maynteyne lechery
God for his grace this amend
Against penance they use delyghtes
Against suffraunce strong defense
Against god they vsen evil ryghtes
Against pytye punyshementes
Open evil against contynence
Her wicked wynnyng worse dispende
Sobrenesse they set in to dispense
But god for his goodness it amend
Why cleymen thy holy his powere
And wranglen against all his histes
His living folowen they nothing here
But lyuen worse than wytlesse beestes
Of fyshe and flesh they louen feestes
As lords they ben broad ykende
Of gods poor they haten gestes
God for his mercy this amend
With diverse such shall have her dome
That said that they be Christ's friends
And do nothing as they should done
All such ben falser than ben fendes
On the people they ley such bendes
As god is in earth they han offend
Sucour for such Christ now send us
And for his mercy this amend
A token of antichrist they be
His careckes ben now wide yknow
Received to preche shall no man be
Without token of him I trow
Each christen priest, to prechyn owe
From god above they ben send
Gods word to all folk for to show
Syn^ull man for to amend
Christ sent the poor for to preche
The royal rich he did not so
Now dare no poor the people teach
For antichrist is over all her foe
Among the people he mote go
He has bydden, all such suspende
Some has he hente, and thinks yet mo
But all this god may well amend
All tho that han the world forsake
And lyuen loly, as god badde
In to her prison shullen be take
Betyn and bounden, and forth ladde
Hereof I read no man be dradde
Christ said, his should be shende
Each man ought hereof be glad
For god full well it woll amend
They took on hem royal power
And say they have swerdes two
One curse to hell, one slay men here
For at this taking Christ had no mo
Yet Peter had one of tho
But Christ, to Peter smite began defend
And in to sheth badde put it in tho
And all such myscheues god amend
Christ badde Peter keep his sheep
And with his sword forbade him smite
Sword is no tole with sheep to keep
But to sheperdes that sheep woll byte
Me thinks such sheperdes ben to wit
Again her sheep with sword that contend
They drive her sheep with great dispite
But all this god may well amend
So successors to Peter be they naught
Whom Christ made chief pastoure
Aswerde no sheperde vsen ought
But he would slay, as a bochoure
For who so were Peter's successor
Sulde bear his sheep till his back bend
And shadow hem from every shoure
And all this god may well amend
Successors to Peter ben these
In that, that Peter Christ's forsook
That ^ad lever the love of god lose
Than a sheperde had to lose his hock
He culleth the sheep as does the coke
Of hem taken the woll vntrende
And falsely gloss the gospel book
God for his mercy them amend
After Christ had take Peter the kay
Christ said he must dye for man
That Peter to Christ began with say
Christ badde him go behind satan
Such cou^s^ylours many of these men han
For worlds well, god to offend
Peter's successors they ben for than
But all such god may well amend
For satan is to say no more
But he that contrary to Christ is
In this they learn Peter's lore
They sewen him when he did mysse
They follow Peter forsothe in this
In all that Christ would Peter reprehende
But not in that, that lo^geth so heuyn bliss
Gor for his mercy hem amend
Some of the apostels they sewe^ in case
Of ought that I can understand
Him that betrayed Christ, Judas
That bare the purse in every land
And all that he might set on hone
^e hid and stale, and myspende
^ys rule these traitors han in hand
Almighty god hem amend
And at the last his lord began tray
Cursedly through his false couetyse
So would these train him for money
And they wysten in what wise
They be seket of the self ensyse
From all sothnesse they ben friend
And couetyse chaungen with queyntyse
Almighty god all such amend
Where Christ on earth here efte sone
These would dampne him to dye
All his bestes they han fordone
And said his sawes ben heresy
And ayenste his commandments they cry
And dampne all his to be made
For it lyketh not hem such losenserye
God almyghtye it amend
These han more might in England here
Than has the king and all his law
They han purchased hem such powere
To take hem whom list not knawe
And say that heresye is her saw
And so to prysone woll him send
It was not so by elder dawe
God for his mercy it amend
The kings law wol no man deem
Angerlyshe withouten answer
But if any man these mysqueme
He shall be bayghteh as a bear
And yet well worse they woll him tere
And in prisone woll hem pende
In gyues, and in other gere
When god woll, it may mende
The king taxes not his men
But by assente of the commynalte
But these each year woll raunsom hem
Maysterfullye, more than does he
Her seals by year better be
Than is the kings in extend
Her officers han gretter fee
But this mischefe god amend
For who so woll prove a testament
That is natte all worth ten pound
He shall pay for the parchement
The third part of the money all round
Thus the people is raunsounde
They say such part to hem should apende
There as they grypen it goth to groude
God for his mercy it amend
A simple fornication
Twentye shyllynges he shall pay
And than have an absolution
And all the year vsen it furthe he may
Thus they letten hem go a stray
They recke not though the soul be brende
These kepen yuell Peter's key
And al such sheperdes god amend
Wonder is, that the parlyamente
And all the lords of this land
Here to taken so little entente
To help the people out of her hand
For they ben harder in their bond
Worse beat, and better brende
Than to the king is understand
God him help this to amend
What byshopes, what religions
Han in this land as much lay fee
Lordshyppers and possessions
More than the lords, it seems me
That makes hem lose charity
They mow not to god attend
In earth they have so high degree
God for his mercy it amend
The Emperor yaf the pope sometime
So high lordyshp him about
That at last the sely kyme
The prude Pope put him out
So of this realm is in doubt
But lords be ware and them defend
For now these folk be wonder stout
The king and lords now this amend.
Thus ends the second part of this tale, and hereafter follows the third
Moses law forbode it to
That priests should no lordshppes welde
Christ's gospel byddeth also
That they should no lordshyp held
Ne Christ's Apostels were never so bold
No such lordeshippes to them enbrace
But smeren her sheep and keep her fold
God emende hem for his grace
For they ne ben but counterfete
Men may know hem by her fruit
Her gretnesse makes hem god foryete
And take his meekness in dispite
And they were poor and had but lyte
They nolde not demen after the face
But noryshe her sheep, and hem not byte
God amend hem for his grace
Gyfon,
What can thou prech against chanons
That men clepen seculere?
Peli. They ben curates of many towns
On earth they have great powere
They have great prebendes and dear
Some two or three, and some mo
A personage to ben a playeng fere
And yet they learn the king also
And let to feruie all that fare
To whom that woll most give therefore
Some woll spend, and some woll spare
And some woll lay it up in store
A cure of soul they care not for
So they mow money take
Whether her souls be won or lore
Her profytes they woll not forsake
They have a gedering procuratour
That can the poor people enplede
And robben hem sa a rauynour
And to his lord they money led
And catch of quycke and eke of deed
And richen him and his lord eke
And to rob the poor can give good read
Of old and young, of hole and syke
Therwyth they purchase hem lay fee
In loud there hem lyketh best
And b^ylde also broad as a cite
Both in the East, and eke in the west
To purchase thus they ben full pressed
But on the poor they woll naught spend
Ne no good give to gods gest
Ne send him some that all has send
By her service such woll live
And trust that other in to treasur
Though all her paryshe dye vnshriue
They woll not give a rose flower
Her life should be as a myrrour
Both to lered and to leude also
And teache the people her lele labor
Such mister men ben al mysgo.
Some of hem ben hard nygges
And some of hem ben proud and gay
Some spend her good upon gygges
(...) (...) hem of great array
Alas, what think these men to say
That thus dispended gods good
At the dredefull domes day
Such wretches shul be worse than wood
Some her churces never ne sye
Ne never openye, thither ne send
Though the poor parishens for hu^gre dye
O penny on hem will they not spend
Have they receyuynge of the rent
They recke never of the remenant
Alas, the devil has clean hem blente
Such one is Sathanas soiournante
And vsen horedome and harlotry
Couetyse, pomp, and pride
Slouthe, wrath, and eke envy
And sewen sin by every side
Alas, where think such tab^de
How wol they accompes yield
From hye god they mow hem not hyde
Such wyllers wit is not worth a nelde
They ben so roted in richesse
Hhat Christ's pouert is for yet
Served with so many mess
Hem thinks that Manna is no mete
All is good that they mow get
They wene to live evermore
But when god at dome is set
Such treasour is a feeble store
Uneath mote they matyns say
For countynge and courtholdynge
And yet he iangleth as a iaye
And ynd^rstont him self nothing
He woll serve both earl and king
For his finding and his fee
And hyde his tythynge and his offryng
This is a feeble charity
Other they ben proud, or coueytous
Or they ben hard, or hungry
Or they ben lyberall or lecherous
Or else medlers with marchadry
Or maynteyners of men with maystry
Or stewardes* countours, or pledours
And serve god in ypocrysy
Such prestes ben Christ's false traitors
They ben false, they ben vengeable
And begilen men in Christ's name
They ben unsteadfast and unstable
To tray her lord, hem thinks no shame
To serve god they be full lame
Gods thieves, and falsely stele
And falsely gods word defame
In wennynge is her worlds well
Antichrist these serve all
I pray the who may say nay?
With Antichrist such shull fall
They folowen him in deed and fay
They seruyn hem in rich array
To serve Christ such falsely feign
Why, at the dredefull domes day
Sull they not follow him to pain?
That known hem self that they done ill
Against Christ's commandment
And amend hem never ne will
But serve satan by one assente
Who says soth he shall be shent
Or speaks against her false living
Who so well lives shall be brent
For such ben gretter than the king
Pope, Bishopes, and Chardinals
Chanons, Persons, and vycaire
In gods service I troue ben false
That sacraments sellen here
And ben as proud as Lucifere
Each man look whether that I lie
Who so speaks against her powere
It shall be holden heresye
Look how many orders take
Only o^ Christ, for his service
That the worlds gods forsake
Who so takes orders, or other wise
I trow that they shall sore agryse
For all the gloss that they conne
Al sewen not this assyse
In yuell time they thus begone
Look how many among hem all
Holden not this hye way
With Antichriste they shullen fall
For they woollen god betraye
God amend hem that best may
For many men they maken shende
They weren well the sothe I say
But the deuyel has foul hem blende
Some on her churches dwell
Appparailled poorly proud of port
The seven sacraments they done sell
In cattle catchynge is her comfort
Of each matter they woollen mell
And done hem wrong is her dysporte
To afray the people they ben fell
And hold hem lower then does the lord
For the tydynge of a ducke
Or of an apple, or an aye
They make men swear upon a book
Thus they foulen Christ's say
Such bearen yuell heaven kay
They mowen assoyle, they mow shryue
With men's wives strongly play
With true tyllers sturte and strive
At the wrestlynge, and at the wake
And chief chauntours at the nale
Markette beaters, and medlyng make
Hoppen and houten with heue and hale
At fair fresh, and at wine stale
Dyne and drink, and make debate
The seven sacraments set at sail
How keep such the kayes of heaven gate?
Men's wives they woollen hold
And though that they ben right sorry
To speak they shull nor be so bold
For sompnenge to the consystory
And make hem say mouth I lie
Though they it saw with her eye
His lemman holden openly
No man so hardy to axe why
He woll have tythynge and offrynge
Maugre whosoever it gruche
And twyse on the day he woll sing
Gods prestes nere none such
He mote on hunting with dog and biche
And blown his horn, and cryen hey
And sorcerye vsen as a wytche
Such kepen yuell Peter's key
Yet they mote have some stock or stone
Gayle painted, and proudely dyght
To maken men lyuen upon
And say that it is full of might
About such, men set up great light
Other such stocks shull stand thereby
As dark as it were mydnyght
For it may make no mastry
That it leude people se mow
Thou Mary, thou worchest wonder things
About that, men offren to now
Hongen broches, ouches, and tynges
The priest purchases the offrynges
But he nyll offer to none image
Woe is the soul that he for synges
That precheth for such a pylgrimage
To men and women that been poor
That been Christ's own likeness
Men shullen offer at her door
That suffer honger and dystresse
And to such images offer less
That mow not feel thurst ne cold
The poor in sprete began Christ bless
Therefore offreth to feeble and old
Buckelers broad, and sweardes long
Baudrke, with baselardes kene
Such toles about her neck they honge
With Antichrist such priests ben
Upon her deeds it is well seen
Whom they seruen, whom they honoren
Antichrists they been clean
And gods goods fasly deuouren
Of scarlet and grene gay gowns
That mote be shape for the new
To clyppen and kyssen counten in towns
The damoseles that to the dance sewe
Cutted clothes to sewe her hew
With long^ pykes on her shone
Our gods gospel is not trwe
Either they seruen the devil or none
Now ben priests pokes so wide
That men must enlarge the vestemente
The holy gospel they done hyde
For they contraryen in raiment
Such priests of Lucifer ben sent
Like conquetours they ben arayde
The p^ude pendauntes at her ars ypent
Falsely the truth they han betrayde
Shryfte silver such woollen ask is
And woll men crepe to the crouche
None of the sacraments save asks
Wy^hout mede shall no man touch
On her bishop their warant vouche
That is law of the dec^e
With mede and money thus they mouche
And thus they said is charity
In the mids of her mass
The nyll have no man but for hyre
And full shortly let forth pass
Such shull men find in every shyre
That personages for profit desire
To live in lykinge and in lusts
I dare not said, Sans ose ^eo dyre
That such ben antichrists priests
Or they yef the bishops why
Or they mote ben in his service
And holden forth her harlotry
Such prelates ben of feeble emprise
Of gods grame such men agryse
For such matters that taken mede
How they excuse hem, and in what wise
Me thinks, they ought greatly dread
They said that it to no man longs
To reprove them though they err
But falsely gods goodesse they fongeth
And therewith maynteine woe and werre
Her deeds should be as bright as sterre
Her living, leude man's light
They say the pope may not err
Need must that pass man's might
Though a preeste lie with his lemman all night
And tellen his fellow, and he him
He goth to mass anon right
And says he syngeth out of sin
His bird abides him at his ynne
And hyghteth his dinner the mean while
He syngeth his mass for he would win
And so he weneth god begyle
Hem thinks long till they be met
And that they vsen forth all the year
Among the folk when he is set
He holds no man half his pere
Of the byshope he has powere
To soil men or else they ben lore
His absolution may make them skere
And woe is the soul that he sings for
The Gryffon began for to threte
And said, of monks can thou ought
The Pyllycan said, they ben full great
And in this world much woe has wrought
Saint benet, that her order brought
Ne made hem never on such manner
I trow it came never in his thought
That they should use so great power
That a man should a monk lord call
Ne serve on knees, as a king
He is as proud as prince in pall
In meat and drink, and all thing
Some weareu myter and ring
With double worsted well ydyght
With royal meat and rich drink
And rydeth on a courser as a knight
With hawk and with hundes eke
With broches or ouches on his hode
Some say no mass in all a weke
Of deinties is her most food
With lordshyppes and with bondmen
This is a royal religion
Saint Benet made never none of hem
To have lordshyppe of man ne town
Now they ben queynte and curious
With fine clothe cladde and served clean
Proud angry, and envious
Malice is much that they mean
In catchyng crafty and covetous
Lordly lyuen in great likynge
This living is not religious
According to Benette in his living
The^ ^e^ clerks, her courts they over se
Her poor tenaunce fully they slyte
The hyre that a man amerced be
The gladlier they woll it write
This is far from Christ's pouerte
For all with couetyse they endyte
On the poor they have no pity
Ne never hem cleryshe but ever him byte
And commenly such ben common
Of poor people, and of hem begete
That this perfection han ynomen
Her fathers ryden not but one her fete
And trauaylen sore for that they ete
In pouert lydeth young and old
Her fathers suffers drought and wete
Many hongry meles, thurst, and cold
And all this the monks han forsake
For Christ's love and saint Benette
To pride and ease have hem take
This ryligion is yuell beseate
Had they ben out of relygion
They must have hanged at the plowe
Threshyng and dykinge fro town to town
Wyht sorry mete, and not half ynow
Therefore they han this all forsake
And taken to riches, pride, and ease
Full sew for god woll monks hem make
Little is such order for to praise
Saint Benet ordained it not so
But badde hem be cherelyche
In churlyche manner live and go
Boystous in earth, and not lordlysh
They dysclaunder saint Benette
Therefore they have his holy curse
Saint Benet with hem never mete
But if they thought to rob his purse
I can no more hereof tell
But they ben like tho before
And clean serve the dyuell of hell
And ben his treasure and his store
And all such other counterfaitours
Chanhus, Canons, and such dysgysed
Ben gods enemies and traitors
His true religion han foul despised
Of Freres I have told before
In a making of a Creed
And yet I could tell worse and more
But men would werien it to read
As gods goodness no man tell might
Write ne speak ne think in thought
To her falshed, and her vntyght
May no man tell that ever god wrought
The Gryffon said, thou can no good
Thou came never of no gentle kind
Other I trow thou waxest wood
Or else thou have lost thy mind
Should holy church have no head
Who should be her gouernayle
Who should her rute, who should her reed
Who should her forthren, who should avail
Each man shall live by his travail
Who best does shall have most need
With strength if men the church assail
With strength men must defend her need
And the pope were purely poor
Nedy, and nothing ne had
He should be driven from door to door
The wicked of him nolde not be dradde
Of such and heed men would be sad
And synfully lyuen as hem lust
With strength, amends such be made
With wepen wolves from sheep be wust
If the pope and prelates would
To beg, and bydde, bow and borowe
Holy church should stand full cold
Her servants sytte and soupe sorrow
And they were noughty foul and horowe
To worship god men would wlate
Both on even and on morrow
Such harlotry men would hate
Therefore men of holy church
Should ben honest in all thing
Worshypfully gods works werche
So seems it to serve Christ her king
In honest and en clean clothing
With vessels of gold and clothes rich
To god honestly to make offrynge
To his lordshyppe none is liche
The Pelican cast an houge cry
And said alas, why say thou so
Christ is our heed that sytteth on hye
Hedde^ ne ought we have no mo
We ben his members both also
And father he taught us to call him als
Masters to be called defended he tho
Af other masters ben wicked and falls
That takes maystry in his name
Goostly, and for earthly good
Kings and lords should lordshyp have
And rule the people with mylde mode
Christ for us that shed his blood
Badde his priests no maystershyp have
Ne carke not for cloth ne fode
From every myschefe he will hem save
Her rich clothing shall be ryghtwysnesse
Her treasure, true life shall be
Charity shall be her richesse
Her lordshyppe shall be unite
Hope in god, her honest
Her vessel clean conscience
Poor in spirit, and humilite
Salbe holy churches defense
What said the Gryffon may the grieve
That other folks faren well
What haste thou to done with her live
Thy falsheed each man may feel
For thou can no catell get
But lyueh in land as a lorel
With glosynge gettest thou thy mete
He fares the deuell that wonnethe in hell
He would that each man there should dwell
For he lives in clean enuey
So with the tales that thou do tell
Thou would other peopl destry
With your gloss, and your heresye
For ye can live no better life
But clean in hypocrisy
And bryngest the in woe and strife
And therwyth have not to done
For ye ne have here no cure
Ye serve the dyuell, neither god ne man
And he shall pay you your hyre
For ye woll fare well at feestes
And warm clothed for the cold
Therefore ye gloss gods heestes
And begyle the people young and old
And all the seven sacraments
Ye speak against as ye were slye
Against tythinges, offringes with your ente^tes
And on our lords body falslylye
And all this ye done to live in ease
As who says, there ben none such
And said the pope is not worth a pease
To make the people again him gruche
And this comes in by friends
To bring the christen in distaunce
For they would that no man were feendes
Leave thy chattrynge with mischaunce
If thou live well, what wylt thou more
Let other men live as hem list
Spend in good, or keep in store
Other men's conscience never thou nyste
Ye han no cure to answer fore
What meddell ye, that han not to done
Let men live as they han done yore
For thou shall answer for no man
The Pelican said, Sir, nay
I despised not the pope
Ne no sacrament, soth to say
But speak in charity and good hope
But I despise her hye pride
Her richesse, that should be poor in spirit
Her wickedness is know so wide
They serve god in false habyte
And turnen meekness in to pride
And lowlynesse in to hye degree
And gods word turn and hyde
And that am I moved by charity
To let men to live so
With all my conning and al my might
And to warn men of her woe
And to tell hem troth and right
The sacraments be soul hele
If they ben used in good use
Against that speak I never a dele
For then were I nothing wise
But they that vsen him in mysse manner
Or set hem up to any sale
I trow they shall abye hem dear
This is my reason, this is my tale
Who so takes hem vnryghtfullyche
Against the ten commandments
Or by gloss wreched lyche
Sells any of the sacraments
I trow they do the deuell homage
In that they weten they to wrong
And thereto I dare well wage
They seruen Satan for all her song
To tythen and offren in wholesome life
So it be done in dew manner
A man to houselyn and to shryfe
Weddyng, and all the other in fere
So it be another sold ne bought
Ne take ne give for couetyse
And it be so taken it is naught
Who sells hem so meye sore agryse
On our Lords body I do not lie
I say soth through true read
His flesh and blood through his mysterye
Is there, in the form of bread
How it is there, it needs not strive
Whethe it be subgette or accydent
But as Christ was, when he was on live
So is he there verament
If pope or cardynall live good live
As Christ commanded in his gospel
Against that woll I not strive
But me thinks they live not well
For if the people lived as god bid
Pride and highness he shylde despise
Richesse, couetyse, and crown hi^ head
Meekness and pouerte he should use
The Gryffon said he should abye
Thou shall be brent in balefull fire
And all thy sect I shall dystrye
Ye shall hanged by the swyre
Ye shullen be hanged and to draw
Who gives you leave for to preach
Or speak against gods law
And the people thus falsely teach
Thou shall be cursed with book and bell
And dysseuered from holy church
And cleney dampened into hell
Otherwise but ye woll worche
The Pellycan said that I ne dread
Your cursynge is of little value
Of god I hope to have my mede
For it is falshed that ye show
For ye ben out of charity
And wylneth vengeance, as did Nero
To suffern I woll ready be
I dread not that thou can do
Christ bad ones suffer for his love
And so he taught all his servants
And but thou amend for his sake above
I dread not all thy mayntenaunce
For if I dread the worlds hate
Me thinks I were little to praise
I dread nothing your hye estate
Ne I dread not your disease
Would ye turn and leave your pride
Your hye port, and your richesse
Your cursynge should not go to wide
God bring you into ryghtwysnesse
For I dread not your tyranny
For nothing that ye can done
To suffer I am al ready
Syker I recke never how soon
The Gryffon grynned as he were wode
And looked louelye as an owl
And swore by cokes heart blood
He would him tere^ every doule
Holy church thou dysclaundrest foul
For thy reasons I woll the all to rate
And make thy flesh to rote and moule
Lo^e^, thou shall have hard grace
(...) Gryffon slew forth on his way
The Pellycane did sytte and weep
And to him self he began say
God would that any of Christ's sheep
And herd, and ytake keep
Each a word that here said was
And would it write and well it keep
God would it were all for his grace
Plowman
I answerde, and said I would
If for my trauyle any man would pay
Pelycan. He said yes, these yt god han sold
For they han store of money
Plowman. I said, tell me and thou may
Why tellest thou men's trespace?
Pelycan. He said, to amend hem in good fay
If God woll give me any grace
For Christ him self is lykened to me
That for his people dyed on rode
As fare I, right so fares he
He fedeth his birds with his blood
But these done yuel against god
And ben his fone under friends face
I told hem how her living stood
God amend hem for his grace
Plowma^. what ayleth the Griffo^, tell why
That he holds on that other side
For they two ben lykely
And with kinds robben wide
Pelican. The foul betokens pryte
As Lucifer, that high flew was
And sith he did him an evil hyde
For he agylted gods grace
As bird flies up into the air
And lives by birds that been meke
So these ben flow up into dyspayre
And shended sely souls eke
The souls that been in sins seek
He culleth hem, knele therefore alas
For brybry gods forbode break
God amend it for his grace
The hinder part is a lion
A robber and a rauynere
That robs the people in earth a down
And in earth holds none his pere
So fares this foul both far and nere
And with te^porel strength there people chase
As a lion proud in earth here
God amend hem for his grace
Pelican
He slew forth with his wings twain
All droupynge, dased, and dull
But son the gryffon came again
Of his fowls the earth was full
The Pyllycan he had cast to pull
So great a nombre never seen there was
What manner of fowls tellen I woll
If god woll give me of his grace
With the griffon comen fowls feel
Rauyns, tokes, crows, and pie
Gray fowls, agadred well
I gurde above they would hye
Gledes and bosardes wherein hem by
White molles and puttockes toke^ her place
And lap wings, that well comes lie
This fellowship han for gerde her grace
Lange the Pelican was out
But at last he comes again
And brought with him the Phoenix stout
The Griffon would have flow full feign
His fowls that flewen as thick as rain
The Penyx tho began hem chase
To fly from him it was in vain
For he did vengeance and no grace
He slew hem down without mercy
There astarte neither free ne thral
On him they cast a ruful cry
When the Gryffon down was fall
He beat him not, but slew hem all
Whyther he hem drove no man may trace
Under the earth me thought they yal
Alas they had a feeble grace
The Pellycan then axed right
For my writing if I have blame
Who woll for me fight of flight?
Who shall shield me from shame
He that had a maid to dame
And the lamb that slain was
^^al shield me from gostly blame
For erthely harm is gods grace
Therefore I pray every man
Of my writing have me excused
^^ys wrythynge writes the Pelican
That thus these people has despised
For I am fresh fully aduysed
I nyll not maynteyne his manace
For the deuell is often dysguysed
To bring a man to yuell grace
wyteth the Pelican and not me
For hereof I nyl not auowe
In hye ne in low, ne in no degree
But as a fable take it ye mow
To holy church I will be bow
Each man to amend him Christ se^de space
And for my writing me allow
He that is almighty for his grace
