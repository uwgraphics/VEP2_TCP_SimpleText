Complaynt of the soul.

Cont^^^ (...) Heu infame. Furore consumor. Spes nobis nulla Animam ami^^mus.

Here begins a lamentable complay^t that ye soul makes of the wretched
life of the body.
TEdet (...) mea^ vite me^. My soul is weary of the life. For there I see no
thing but matter of sorrow myserye and sin. The part of my life passed is
full lamentable wha^ I remember it / the present part suppressed mine heart with
heaviness for it is unreformed. And ye great loss of virtue in these two
parts and abhomynacyon of sin puts me in great fere of the third part ye
which is to come. And if my life might be prolonged many years only in
virtuous uses / yet it might not recompense for the manyfolde offenses which I
have done in the present syghte of my lord god and terryble Judge of my life
which hates no thing but only sin. Alas than my soul may be full of sorrow
which has provoked my lord god / my most tender lover to be wroth with me
and to hate me more than I do a dog or a stynkynge carayne / for no thing is
so vile so loathsome so stynkynge nor so abhomynable in the sight or smelling
of man / as sin in the sight or smelling of god. Alas alas that I should
offe^de my lord god which has made me of naught and where he might have made
me a stone or an unreasonable be / he has made me to ye image of himself a
reasonable creature / and when I was lost redeemed me with ye precious blood of
his heart and suffered the most bytterst death for me / an^ in an my life he
has showed great kyndenesse unto nie / and I have showed great vnky^den^^^e
agayen to him / he loved me and I not him / for I will not do after the will of
him / but I set my will before his will / and ye pleasure of myself before the
pleasure of him / and in fulfyllynge my will I care not to dysplease him. And
thus I se not by him which has made so much of me he has made heaven and
earth for me / and has comen to this earth to teache me ye way of salvation /
and has ordained for me if I would love him the mestymable Joy of his
deuynyte and to receive the eternal kyngedome of felycyte All these things I
forgete / and I order myself by my lewd negligence and unhappy living to
lose the love of my lord god / and ye transcendynge Joy of his kyngedome. I
order me by my wretched life to everlasting pain / woo I be a vessel of death
of Ire and Indyngnacyon of god / he has made my soul by the sacrament of
baptyme a vessel of mercy and grace / and I have defouled it with abhomynable
sin / and made it with out his Inmesurable mercy vessel of dampnacyon to be
burnt in the fire of hell among the horrible fendes ever without ending.
Alas what shall I do what shall I say which have erred thus far out of ye
way of virtue and is casted deep in to the pytte of sin. A great cause I have
of lamentacyon which am in this great Ieoperdye of endless dampnacyon. I am a
waster and a dystroyer of my soul and body. I destroy the goods of nature /
of grace / and of the world as a man yt is worse than good in the sight of him
the which has given them to me to the intent that I should use them
virtuously. And in ye syghte of him which shall most bytterly punysshe him. I
use them vycyously I am closed in ye derke clouds of Ignorance / and
reprouable negligence of my lord g^d / of myself and of virtuous living.
All my life is sinful / and as a dry tr^e barayne and far from all fruit
of virtue I think not on the dreadful Judgment of god / where I shall stand
before the terryble Judgment of christ / and to render account for all the dydes
that I have done in my soul and in my body. O there I shall show an
vnfruytful life / and if there be any fruit therein it is but feigned and false
/ or imperfect or corrupted and other it is full little pleased or else
utterly dyspleased god. And notwithsta^dynge that every man there shall be
fed after this life with such fruit as that he has brought sorth in this
life / than my fedynge is like to be full bitter unto me. O how sorrowful I
ought than to be / for except yt I sorrow for my sin in this life. I am like
for to be brought to great sorrow after this life. O my synful soul. O my
miserable soul look upon thy self / see how thou art brought in to the great
derkenesse of sin so deep that thou canste not see thy self. See thou not
how you rennest in to vain thoughts and unlawful desires. Remember that all the
time yt thou lokest not upon virtue is lost and thou shall be shent therefore /
as much time yt lesest than which might turn the to great Joy in time
coming / and now all shall turn the to great punysshement except thou learn
to amend and to spend the resydue of thy time. O how aferde thou sholdest be
to have an vnfruytful life / for the vnfruytful life is a dampnable life as
almyty god which is very troth says Every tree which bry^geth not forth
good fruit it shall be cut down and cast in to ye fire. A mercy god what
shall I do than for I am so barayne so dry from all devotion and moisture of
contrycyon and grace that I am deapte and redye to the fire. A merciful lord
cut me not down by death to such time that my tree may have moisture through
thy grace and bring forth some profitable fruytes of penance / all my dydes
that I do art not suffycyent to recompense for ye mete and drink yt I receive
of y^ to my bodily sustenaunce. A where with shall I tha^ recompense for my
soul / my body / my wit / my herynge / my seeing / my speech / my health / my
bodily power / my life / and where with all shall I recompense for my sin / and
for yt loss of grace which passes these all / for none shall be brought to
dampnacy on but such as for lack of grace are defouled with sin who so
spends more in fedynge of a be tha^ it is worth in themself is not that
superfluous expense and vnproufytable. And yet mercyful lord ye nourysshest
daily and haboundantly an vnproufytable worm and stynkynge sinner. A good
lord thou would not that this wretch shall perysshe of whom thou do so
large expenses and so tenderly kepest it. Many good thou gyuest it unasked /
and from many evil things he preserved it vnthanked of it / thou kepest me /
you ledest me / and protectest me from many perils / and as an unkind
wretch I remember not this and I do not call in wealth to the but in great
sorrow and fere when than that I am like to fall. A good lord a more or a
greter wretch is there none in this world than I am / and a most unkind
katyf / a wretch / a worm / a vessel full of uncleanness and abhomynacyon
not worthy for to be called a man or a reasonable creature For I abuse that
reason / that memory / and that fredome of will which thou haste given unto
me with all the gifts and all the benefetes of nature and of fortune / and so
I am wors than a be the which has not the helps and have no reason for to
dyrecte their life to the honor and the worship of god as I have / they
have no fredome of will for to chose the good and to leave ye evil as I have. My
reason is given to me for to know my lord god / and for to know how I should
live to the pleasure of him and to think upon y^ life that is to come / and
holyly for to order mysefe thereto / and for to avoid the great tourmentes and
the endless trybulacyon the which after this life is ordained for sin. A
god mercy what great derkenesse am I in / and my soul is i^ manner made blind
y^ goostely syghte is gone. I look not up to my lord god with the sight of my
soul / but all my thought / all my memory / all my love / and all the great
pleasure in my soul is down ward / and all is to vanytees of this earth I am
erthly i^ my prayers / in me study / in my labors in my medytacyons / and in
all my conuersacyo^. I may well think that these words are verefyed of me.
The prophet Y say says. Earth earth earth here y^ word of god / for I am
made of earth / and hastily I shall turn to earth / and al my conuersacyon is
but earth. I am reputed good lord in the sight of the after my love / if I
love earth I am earth / if I love erthly things I am erthly / if I love
goostly things I am goostly / and if I love the good lord which art very
god than I am godly. A good lord I fere than that I am i^ thy reputacyon but
as vile earth. For in the earth and in the erthly things is ever my mind. I
keep it not upon the good lord / ne upon y^ holy ordering of my soul I have
suffered my self by wretched custom so long and so contynually for to run
from the and from actual thoughts of my soul and things which are
prouffytable for to promote my soul in virtue and in good works. Than now I
can not without great pain and without great labor for to fyxe my mind any
time or space upon the or upon the holy dyreccyon and ordering of my soul /
and I of a froward and of an obdurate will in wretchedness enforces not neither
care not myself for to take part against this miserable Inclynacyon of
myself / and so it goes al downewarde with me. I come not upward to the
neither I will not gretely apply myself for to come to the by actual
medytacyon and by parfyte love of the. I sleep. I dreme and y^ I shall find
when the sharp pains of death shall come for to open the eye of my soul /
for than I shall clearly se how vaynely and how synfully and how wretchedly and
how unhappy and how myserably and how vngracyously that I have myspended the
time of this life / y^ which time is given unto me only because that I should
spend it fruytfully in good and in virtuous lyu^ge unto the great honor and
to the great worship of our savior Christ Ihesu and unto the promocyo^ of my
soul in the glory of eternal life and of the heavenly felycyte / and also for
to avoid eternal dampnacyon which is ordained by y^ ryghtwysnesse of almyty
god to the Inordynate lyuers of this life / the which consume the goods that
they have receyned of god to their eternal reprove / sorrow and / pain: and
for to receive of almighty god finally perpetual dampnacyon.

VEdet animam meam vite me. I am weary of my life. It is so full of Ignorance
and of neclygence / so full of unhappy desires and of synful words so full of
forgetfulness and so full of evil thoughts / and so full of vnfruytful dydes
and works and so full of vnprouffytable heaviness / and so full unlawful
saddenesse and so full of vain Joys and sinful dylectacyons with foul
wretched and miserable pleasures / also it is full of pains with vnpacyence of
proud desires and with a full covetous mind / and with all these myseryes I see
how y^ my self is but a course and a rennynge to death / and now I am more
nerer it than when as I last spoke of it. The death comes shortly / and ye
life gooth away full fastely and full swyftely / and at y^ hour of death I am
like to be called for to render accomptes of my life / and I am unprovided and
unware for to co^tente the Judge of my life / and than I shall be most full of
sorrow and pain and lamente or complain the time y^ ever I came in to this
life / which so neclyge^tly has lost the profit of this. A good lord I am
ashamed and abashed of my life in y^ syghte of the good lord which all
thing seth clerly / and nothing may be hid from the. Sythen it is so that
shame is feere of rebuke and reprove / and there is no rebuke which that I
dread so much as I do the rebuke of the good lord / wherefore I am most
ashamed of my synful life in the syghte of the / and thus I am ashamed to live
/ and yet I am aferde to dye. For if I may avoid by the great mercy of god the
torments of eternal dampnacyon / yet I fere y^ I shall bear with me in to
purgatory the gylte of many sins / and I shall pay by great pain / the
duyte of many oblygacyons / grant me good lord perfyte fere of y^. For when I
shall not fere by death to come to the / for thy fere makes souls to declyne
and f^ee from sin. A good lord if I had thy fere perfytly I should be more
a dredde any thing to think or to desire synfully in the sight of the / than
I am to do sin in the sight of man. The sinful mocyons of my mind are so
abhomynable in the beholdynge of the as the did of shameful sin in the
sight of man than if I fered y^ I should be apunysshed and ashamed to think
any thing dyspleasynge to y^. I waute these fere of the / and why / for I have
not perfyte faith of the. A than I am unfaithful / and with out faith no man
may please the / and thus all my life is dyspleasynge unto the. A good lord
what shall I do for I want faith of the / fere of the / love of the / and dread
of the / but I want not the dread of the world / love of the world / and
shame of the world. And thus the image of my soul is defauted and made foul
i^ thy sight and is depreued thy great virtues where by it should be made fair
and acceptable to the what shall I do than but turn me to the and ask mercy
for that I have spenbed my life so myserably. A than I may call my soul a
sinful soul which is without dread of the and without shame of sin
understanding that after the order of thy ryghtwysnesse sin must have
sorrow / than my soul ought to have sorrow / and al my life should he we pynge
/ and who shall give teres enough to mine eyes that I may weep enough for my
miserable living / and lamente that I ever have spent so myserably my time
which I can not now revoke agayen / ne fruytfully recompense but by sorrow for
my sin. Alas I have lost the well of life and of al true solace / and I have
delued in the old stynkynge cysterne of sin / and the deceyuable water there
of which seems in y^ begy^nynge sweet and delectable / and now it is turned
in to bytternesse / abhomynacyon / and great sorrow. O most merciful lord
which art the well of pity and of grace from whom the flode of celestyall
glory does streme upon all the heavenly court. Replenysshynge them with all
pleasure and delectacyons passing y^ possybylyte of man's thinking / give me
good lord in this vale of my serye for the glory of thy name the spyryte of
compunccyon that I may bytterly weep for my sins and to be preuylegyate by
thy grace never from hens forward da^pnably to affend the. O merueylous god
how myserably is my soul / which only can not sorrow according to the
grievous offenses that it has done in this life but also it is in manner benomen
and deed / for it feleth not the great goostly sorrows that it has / whereby
except it have help by mean of penance it shall be brought to the bitter
pains of everlasting death. A I may curse sin the which has brought me so
far from the good lord / and so far fro my self that I have lost my
fely^ge y^ quyckenesse of my spyryte / and the goostyly taste of all sprytuall
pleasure and delectacyons in virtue. A miserable soul a sinful soul why art
thou so dulle and so slow to all good works which art to the pleasure of god
/ and to thy perpetual promocyon and endless Joy / perpetual bliss and
hertely gladness / why art thou so prompte and so ready to all wretchedness
and al works of abhomynable sins which are to y^ great dyspleasure of
almighty god / and to thy great pain and sorrow and dampnacyon both of soul
and of body. Why art thou so oblyuyous and forgetful of fruytfull and
virtuous doctrine / and so retenty^e of evil fpekynge and words Incytynge to
sin. Woo woo may thou be which leueste the way of virtue and chosest the
way of hyces / leuest the way of saluacyo^ and take the way of dampnacyon.
Thou haste life and death both laid before the / and which thou wylt thou
may chose. Love thou not life / hate thou not death love thou not
delectacyo^ and pleasure / hate not thou pain and sorrow. Alas how unhappy
art y^ than which chosest the way of sin / the way of death / y^ way of
pain and endless sorrow / and wylfully leuest y^ way of virtue which ledeth
to ly^e Joy and endless mirth with all y^ heart can think or desire
consolacyon. Thou rennes to bodily death and not only bodily whereby thy soul
shall be departed from thy body / but also the goostly sight of death where you
shall be for ever departed from the face and clear vysyon of god which is y^
life to thy soul like as thy soul is life to thy body / the pains of fire
and the terryble sight of the deuylles shall not be so grievous unto the / as
the sondrynge from thy lord god which full sure ye thou shalt se him in his
glory. Would not thou say that such a man were worthy sorrow and pain which
would chose to go that way were it never so pleasant there he knew certainly
/ if he continued therein that he shall be taken with thieves robbed and put to
the most bytterest pain of death. Then I counseyll the by times leave the way
of sin / for the end thereof is endless sorrow / and the pleasure y^ comes
thereof be it never so great it shall hastly pass. And if thou come to that
end thou shall take thy leave also true as god is true from all pleasures
without end. Our lord of his great mercy offered to the eternal pleasure for
a short temporal pain suffered according to the ordenau^ce of his will / if
you wylt refuse so great a lucre for so little a payment than thou art an
unhappy merchant. Then if thou wylt not follow the will of god in suffry^ge of
this pain / but will fulfill thynowne will in taking thy short and sinful
pleasures of this life / art not thou than worthy / by ye ryghtwysenes of god
to lose and be depryued of this perpetual Joy and pleasure you can not
resonably say nay. For thou that wylt refuse so inestymable a Joy for so
little a price / than you set little thereby / and in that thou dysablest thy
self to have it. And of very equity thou which wylfully and sy^fully forsakest
^^^^nal salvation / thou deseruest by the ryghtwysnesse of god to have eternal
pain and dampnacyon. Then behold upon the right side the mercy of god which
is ready to give the perpetual Joy for a short virtuous pain. And behold
upon the lift hand the ryghtwysnesse of god which shall give the eternal
pain for refusing of eternal Joy which thou forsokest for a short sy^ful
pleasur / tha^ beware what you do / he of his great grace offers the
perpetual Joy. And if thou wylt so lightly refuse it / than he thryteth the
with endelesse sorrow and pain that thou may not escape his hands / chose
ye now whether thou wylt for a little pain have endelesse pleasure / or for a
little simple solace have endelesse pay^e and sorrow / and one thou must needs
chose. I counseyll the to take pain and leave pleasure / draw the to the right
hand that thou be not found at the day of dome among the damned people upon
the lift hand / leave vain and sinful temporal Joy for the end thereof is
sorrow / if you lyuest after thy pselaunt desires of thy flesh it shall bring
the to endelesse and paynfull death / if thy flesh live after thy soul / and
thy soul after god / than thou shall live eternally. A my seek unstable soul
/ dulle soul / miserable and sinful soul / you would have health / strength /
love / and power: thou would be much made of / and have richesse / fredom and
fre^dshyp / you would be without fere without heaviness / you would be swyfte / light
/ ympossyble / why sekest you the gods in the regyon of death they are not
here they are only there where is very life / and no life may be called very
life but only that life which is eternal life / for there death has no power
any thing to mynysshe thy life or any thing yt apperteyneth to yt life / for
from y^ life death is perpetuelly exyled which makes this life no life / and
all thing to vanysshe away which perteyneth to this life. A my soul love
that life and that lord above all thing which shall give the yt Joyful life
that blessed life perdurable and eternal living what have thou in this mortal
life but labor werynesse sorrow and pain / with these thou begynnest life / with
these you co^tynuest thy life / with these thou shall end thy life / yt
pleasures are shortly passing / the sorrows and pains are long abiding /
and all erthly Joys are meddled with myserye of sin / thou thynkest sin is
but little / would god thou would call it to mind how grievous it is in the
sight of the great Judge of the world a* mighty god remember how grievously he
has punysshed syn^e / great part of the aungelles he cast out of heaven for
sin which are of all creatures most excellent in natural perfeccyon. O how
shall thou think tha^ that he shall spare the which art sinful / for thou
art no thing so precious i^ nature as the leest angel which was lost and
dampened for sin / and thy body is but a dounghylle and a sack of stynkynge
myste / than trust you that if you wylt not leave sin thou shalt perysshe with
them / for the ryghtwysnesse of god will punysshe sin / and right they shall
perysshe from y^ perpetual pleasure and glory of god which will not leave
sin / all we are exyled from paradyse for sin / all the world was drowned
except.viii. persons in y^ time of Noes floode for sin the five cytees of
which one was Sodom and Gomorre were distroyed with fire and brymstone and
sanke down for sin / the Egipcyans were drowned in the read see for sin /
ye children of Israel were killed a great nombre in deserte for sin / and now
all the.xii. trybus are in captyuyte for syn^e / translacyons of kingdoms and
Empyres fro man to man is for sin / batayles / pestylence / and hungre in
common plages of god contynually in some part of the world or upon the people
is for sin and finally all desire of sin shall cease from all pleasure and
turn to vnremedyable pains and sinners shall be put with sinners in
everlasting woo there as they shall never turn to Joy or pleasure again. A
wretched soul why sorowest not thou for sin / seeste thou not how my lord
loved the and hated sin which would suffer the most paynfull death to
deliver the from sin / learn to love thy lover but you hate thy lover / for
wha^ thou doeste syu^e thou doeste plainly that is i^ to make him to suffer
death again thou love syn^e which is the most gretest enemy for it shall
bring the except thou leave it to endless and horrible pain thou set test
little by sin a would god our lord might set so little there by / for than you
should be delivered from great fereheuynesse and pain which you haste
deserved for syn^e but woe should I be good lord for every transgressyo^ of thy
commandment for if there come none other thereof dysobedyence it dishonored
the / a how should I say that sin is little for I can not truly say yt the
dishonor of y^ is little / a how I bound to honor ye you desyrest it not for all yt you haste done to me but yt I should honor do to y^. I receive thy
benefetes and you may no thing receive of me but honor / you gyuest my
goodness and this may grow. I may give to y^ no goods whereby you may be
the better for my goodness may not grow. I may give to y^ honor and this
may not grow in y^ but in me / and when thyn honor grows in me than thy
goodness in me / and all the prouffytes of my dydes in to me and none to ye /
for I may by dydes no thing make ye to better / but I may make me y^ better by
thy grace i^ y^ I do honor to y^. A dear lord how woe should I than be to
dishonor the / and I may do no more dishonor to ye tha^ to do syn^e which
can not be done in mind in will ne did but in the clear sight of the / a how
woo should I than be to do syn^e and there by for to dyshonoure ye which art
my lord and my god / my maker and my redemer and preserver / and finally would
bry^ge me to se thy glory and to have with the honor in eternyte. A how shall I
say y^ sin is little sythen y^ syn^e dishonored y^ / and no thing should
be more shamfull and sorrowful in me than for to do any did to dyshonoure the.
Alas how may I find in my heart to to dyshonoure y^ which have none help but
only of the O wretched and miserable soul why remembrest thou not ye truth
of god / for thou know it well y^ it is Impossyble yt he should make any lie
/ and thou knoweste well that he promised no thing but that it shall be
fulfilled for the power is so great that no thing may let him / than thou
know verily that thou shalt appear before him and acompte all thy life / and
of all that thou haste received of him / what say thou art thou ready to thy
reckoning / canste thou show that thou have well expended and well used all the
goods that thou haste received of god / haste not thou vaynly lost and vaynly
suffered for to be lost many of these gifts of our lord god / and many thou
haste expended that thou haste to reason for to lay comfort the at thyn
acompte but that thou art worthy to be dampened for them. Alas sythe^ thou
canste not give a good reckoning of thy time expended / why wylt not you amend
the / and by the will spending of thy life to come for to procure the favor
of this ryghtwyse Judge / he is ready of his right great mercy to take one day
well spended for a year. O than sythen he is thus kind to the and thou wylt
continue in unkind unto him / this syn^e of unkindness and ingratytude / if
you have none other sin it is enough to procure the Ire or wrath of this Judge
/ why wylt thou than unkind soul daily multyply new offenses why remembrest
not you y^ great Ieopardy yt thou stand in for thine old sin. O wretch
learn to weep apply and to take wylful sorrow / y^ much cause have you to weep
and to sorrow / for if you might weep as much water as is in the sea yet it
were of thy self suffycye^te to wasshe thy soul from sin you do* as a
malefactor which has offended his prince and is sorry for to be taken and to
suffer great pain / and yet wylfully he will more outrageously offend him
knowing well that he shall suffer therefore the more pain / you say to me
that this prince is merciful. I say to the that he is mercyful to none but to
such as have mercy upon them self and will leave their wretched living / than
have mercy upon thy self and leave y^ myserye of sin / for thou shalt be
called sooner than thou trustest to thy acompte of all thy works of all thy
ydelnes of all thy words / of all thy silence / of all thy slepynge / of all
thy waking / of all thy sickness / of al thy health / of all thy richesse /
of all thy pouerte / of all thy fedynge / of all abstynences / and of all
thing that thou haste done and left undone to the leest thought of thy soul
/ and of al thing perteynynge to thy power which thou haste not ordained to
the will of god and salvation of thy soul / and thy body shall be punysshed
with y^ for it sinned with the and thou in it for the cause of sin is in it
and it shall have no pain but for the / for it might not sin but by the.
Alas why wylt not thou see whether thou go and behold y^ end of thy
passage that thou demest that thou go to pleasures / and as a blyndfull man
thou go even contrary toward pain / thou thynkest thou go for to have
thy will / and thou go there thou shall have all thing contrary to thy
will / and y^ desyrest mirth and thou take y^ way of endless labor and
perpetual pain and everlasting dampnacyon.

^Edet ai^am mea. n vite me. A my soul has a great cause to be weary of my
life / for I live not as y^ lover of god should live / but as a wretched catyfe
which forgeteth god / and deserved to be forgote^ of him. I have no mind upon
my salvation / my mind is rather upon thing of dampnacyon. I endure me not to
form me. I labor not to repress the wretched mocyon which I feel in me. I
suffer my mind at large to run in vanytees / as a creature that has no god
or Judge ne thing to answer for / ne thing to sorrow for ne to fere / for
help is offered to me and I will not ask it / it is offered to me and I will
not put my hand thereto mine enemies and mine accusers I consent to / and to my
lord and my lover I will not consent. A good lord what shall I do at y^
dredefull day of death at ye terryble dome in the day of Judgment. A how many
thousand sins shall come tha^ upon me without on^ prouysyon as they lay in
watch to take me which I see not now / and I took no keep to deliver myself
by plain confession and many a thing which I trust now is no syn^e shall
tha^ appear grievous syn^e / and many a deed which I trust now is good / than I
shall find them evil and black and abhomynable they y^ shall appear to me /
there I shall receive in soul and body much woo as I have done in soul and
body much wretchedness / and than shall I be w^ for I shall receive y^ woeful
and sorrowful endless pain when the time shall be passed except I leave now
sin and torn me to god and deserve by virtuous living to have mercy / there
shall be pain unprofitable and vnfruytfull penance / for that pain shall not
remeue the sin of them which in this life would not take wylful pain to be
delivered from syn^e and able to be dampened from grace that they shall have no
power to recompense and to satysfye for their offenses / for when grace was
offered to them they refused it / and when the time of penance was laid before
them / vnfruytfully and neclygently they passed it. O good lord now I ought
for to remember what I have done and what that I have deserved to receive for
my doing / all my years I should record in the bytternesse of my soul / and
say how my time is consumed without profit / and what woo I have wrought to
myself / if I could remember that I had done many good things than I should
be glad / but I remember y^ I have done many wretched and evil things and
few good / and therefore I have great cause to be woo / and if I will not
apply me to be woe where I shall be woo there I shall never depart therfro. A
woe woe be to this great hardenesse of mine heart / for these great hamers of
remembrance of eternal torments and most sorrowful vices are to light to
break it. O dullness insanable and unable to be heled all this sharp braydes
are not suffycyent to quycken y^ / they are all to blunt for the. Alas sythen
the great pains y^ god has ordained for sin are to little to put the in fere
/ and make the to be dylygent for thy salvation. A god mercy / a dedly dullness
y^ is in me sythen the terryble thondre of my sins and ghostly sight of y^
great abhomynable multitude of pains causes no quyckenes of deuocyo^ / no
myserye of teres / no fere of god in me. A woe may I be which feel myself in
this great myserye / not ready to arise but rather desired to fall deper. I am
worse than a stone / for it is descended of nature for to descend / but I
descend by malice against nature. A de^e lord I love more erthly vanyte than
I do y^ or the place of thy glory / my soul is crooked al down to ye earth /
for there y^ love is of the there it is fyxed and not upon y^ / and therefore it
looked not up to ye / here is matter of myserye in me to exyte an hondreth souls
to sorrow and make them continue vneasely in weeping but my soul is so dried
fro al moisture and grace y^ there comes no teres fro me and thus I may se
myself a dry stock / a seer tree ready to fire. A merueylous god how am I
comen to this dullness to this dryenesse / to this blyndnesse and derkenesse of
my soul / my soul is made bynome and Impotente to all perfyte deeds of virtue
/ and not only it wanted will / but in manner it wants power to do well / and
what has made me this feblenesse but only sin and what has made in me such
sin but only a crooked and froward will. A wretched dysposycyo^ of my soul
of the which I am cause myself / and therefore mine Impotensy / and
Indisposycyon to holy and perfyte living is none excuse to me / for this
myself has made me by long custom in lyuy^ge A good lord an unkind soul
am I to the. I can not dyssymyle to the / for no thing I may withdraw from
the sight of the / of a child thou have given me power to live virtuously and
to please the not for thyn avail but for mine avail for the endless promocyon
and Ioyefull reward to be received of the / you haste called me / and yet you
contynuest it by good thoughts / by good counseyle / by holy prechynges / by
virtuous examples / by great gifts / calling to me for to come to the. And I
as a wretch repel the and all the gifts y^ thou gyuest me I abuse to the
dyspleasure of ye and to the great accusacyo^ and without thy mercy to the
great dampnacyo^ of me I desire sudden sorrows and pains to come upon me
there thou haste given to me this respyte and time of great delyberacyon to
avoid the paynful doungen of hell and to come to the Joyful Empire of thy
glory there euerlastyngely for to dwell with the I attend it not wherefore I
deserve hastily for to be cast down by ye paynfull blastes of the great
horrible tempests of death. I know well y^ I may not here always abide / and
yet my mind / and my love is more here than there y^ I must always abide. A
merueylous god a great blyndnesse is in me that I should desire for to abide in
y^ same place of myserye there as I well know y^ I may not abide than for to be
in the place of bliss and of mirth and great felycyte there as I may come if I
will and for ever abide / god has made me a reasonable creature for to chose
y^ best life / and I make myself an unreasonable creature for to chose the
worste life / and I love y^ I should not love / and I hate that I should love /
and thus both my mind and my will I abuse unto my great hurt which thou haste
given me to mine help / if I should complain upon myself all that I can reduce
to my mind of mine own wretchedness and unkindness to god / remembry^ge the
great benefeytes and gifts y^ I have received of him / and how gentle a lord
he has been to me without my deseruynge certainly all the wretchedness and
dysco^mendacyon and that I can say of myself is to little in regard of y^
great dysco^mendacyon and blame which I have deserved / my wretched
dysposycyo^ is more ready to do evil than my memory and many moo if they were
knytte together with me are able to receive. I feel myself full of
wretchedness. I am prone and all ready to all evil / else dulle and slow to
all goodness A sythen I might here or see my defautes showed before me like as
thy be I should abhorte with myself like as with a toode or a serpent. A what
dread should my heart unbrace of that terryble Judgment which must be given of
myself at the hour of death where y^ most right wise Judge himself shall
accuse me / and mine own conscience shall witness against me how I have mysused
my soul and little heded the valor thereof which was bought with the
precyouse blood of christ very god and man creator and maker of the universal
world lord of heaven and earth to whose name all creatures shall do obedyence.
I shall give accomptes how I have abused my mind my will my body all my five
wits my tongue my beauty my health my strength conning virtue / how I have
mysordred myself my soul and body the evil mocyo^s both of soul and body
how I have not done y^ was in me to repress them but rather to keep / them and
to work them. All these good lord I forgete and of all these I shall give a
strayte accomptes. Also of mete and drink / gold silver and clothes / and of
all these which had been under my tuycion / as children servants / and of the
evil deeds that I have done / and of all the good deeds which I might have
done / and for sloth and sloggysshenes of myself I have left them undone of
all the time y^ I have received sythe^ I had use of reason. A dear lord what
shall I do at y^ dredful hour of reckoning where as shall be showed
ryghtwysnesse without grace if I now labor not for grace. O what shall I do
dry tree that I am and bring forth no good fruit in y^ church of god / but
rather sewed fruit by many evil words evil works and evil examples. I am
an vnproufytable tree apt and worthy to be cast in to endelesse fire. A what
shall I do that day when I shall give acompte of all y^ time given to me of
our lord how I have spend it to y^ honor of him. I may say nothy^ge is mine
own for I must give a strayte reckoning of all that I have. I am but as a
bailey and a mynystre under god and taken charge well to spend his goods dear
lord give me grace among al temporal mirth often to remember the bytternesse
of the dredeful account that I may that day receive y^ kyngedome of endelesse
Joy and mercy.

^Edet animam meam vite me. A dear lord seeing the myspendynge of my life I
am weary of my life. I myself am grievous to myself my burden is great and is
light to my body / but it is heavy to my soul / it is so great y^ it is like to
press me down from heaven unto the pytte of hell except special grace and
help of my sauyoure. O my merciful lord send me teeres y^ may lament day
and night my miserable life and wasshe away ye fylth of so long gaderynge of
my soul I am woo when I remember so long as I have been in this life and so
wretched / and my wretchedness daily greueth me / my mind is all occupied i^
vanytees and my will in frowardness / my mouth in shrewednes my body in
ydelnesse / and my works in wretchedness. A who shall give to mine eyes a well
of teeres y^ I may co^tynually weep and wayle my woeful life my neclygent life /
my unwise and folysshe life. I live not as a reasonable creature ought to live
reformy^ge my soul and body and my works to my lord which has ordained me
in this life y^ by my works well ordered to him I should come to his life
which life only ought to be called very life / for that only is life which
can not be ended by death and not ye life where we daily run to death / and y^
life only is health which can not be broken with sickness / and that only is
Joy which can not be Interrupted with sorrow and that only is perfyte bliss
which can not be melde with myserye of pain or sin. O you blind ass why
openst you not thyn eyes for to see the dyffrence bytwyxte life and death /
virtue / and vices / sickness and health / felycyte myserye / labor thou
wretch for to arise which lie ouercharged with old sins / put feere to
feere / weeping to weeping / except you aplyest thyselfe wylfully to sorrow /
y^ right wysnesse of god shall magre thyn head bring the to sorrow. A chose
than the less sorrow to avoid ye more sorrow / the temporal sorrow to auoyed
the eternal sorrow. Remembrest not thou y^ he shall Judge the whom you have
made by many fold offenses thyn aduersarye / to whom you have done dyspyte and
rebuke brekynge his commandment before his own face. A god mercy I ought to
be sorry in reme^brynge his kyndenesse to me and mine Ingratytude and
unkindness to him / and the more kyndenesse he showed to me ye more kind I
ought for to be to him / and more I am bound by y^ law of kyndnesse for to
please him / and the more my sin is. If I dysplease him awo ought I than to
be for like as kyndenesse is daily more and more / for y^ longer that he spared
me the more kyndenesse he showed unto me / so by the cyrcumstaunce of
unkindness / the more grievous is the sin in me. what shall I say to this
Judge sythen y^ only mine own kyndenesse is able to conuycte me which so
oftentimes calls me for to amend my life Inwardely Inspyracyon / and many a
thought y^ which he puts in my mind contrary unto mine own wretched
dysposycyon. And outward he called me by prechynge / and by much good
counseylynge / by redynge / by example gyuy^ge of such which has less wit
than I / less power to good works than I / god has given to me more precious
gifts and help to do well / and yet I do worse or not so well / am not I than
worthy before that ryghtwyse Judge to have great punysshement / he that is now
most pacyent to me if I amend not my life shall be most fell / and angrye
with me. And he which now is most lyberall to me / than shall be most hard to
me / and he which now is most meke to me than shall be most fellest / now
most merciful / than most rygorous and strayte in Judgment / I may not ^lee
this Judgment / always I am and shall be under his hand. Now I am under the
right hand of mercy / than shall I be under the heavy hand of his
ryghtwysnesse. woo es me woo is me whom have I offended / whom I have not
atte^ded / whom I have provoked to be wroth with me. Alas wretched what have I
done. I have dishonored my lord god. I have provoked almyty god to take
vengeance on me if his hand of mercy had not retained y^ sword of vengeance
I should have perysshed long before this for many times I have deserved
dampnacyon / but unto this time he has deferred y^ sentence / and ever abides
when I amend and come to reconsylyacyon. O wretched sinner why remember not I
of this life y^ uncertain is and for the time of this life the great kyndnesse
in god and gratytude / and how after this life none shall be taken to grace
which will not amend in this time and space. I believe as I were inmortall. I
fere not what shall fall / and mine old life customs has so tied me y^
without special help of my lord god I can not lose me. Help me good lord
from these dangers of dygnacyon and wrath of these I am benomen / my power is
naught without supportacyon and help of thy mercy. A what anguysshe shall be
in me if I do so unhappily gyde me to see ye terryble day where he which
has most loved me / and most done and most suffered for me shall accuse me
where he shall lay his wou^des against me / his cross / his spear crown of
thorns shall testefye against me / my good angel which has so holsomly at
many times counseylled me / and I have repelled and little set by his
cou^seyl this he shall witness against me / ll deuylles which have tempted me
to sin there shay^ accuse me / and there rehearse y^ words of my professyon
there shall he show openly all my sins in what thing y^ I have sinned / in
what place and time / and how I did syn^e / and what thing: not only that I
have done evil but what good works that I have left undone which I ought to
have. All the creatures of god of whom I have received any benefyte or profit
shall accuse me / for thy have served me by cause I should serve god and that I
have deceived them and done y^ was in me to rob them of their labors / y^
heaven / ye earth / the son what mind of man should not dread this terryble
Judgment / who should not dread y^ presence of the eternal Judge where all
sins shall be brought clerly in our sight and those things which we did with
great de^ecracyon shall be laid before us to our great sorrow confusyon and
detestacyo^. The Judge shall be above us whole hands we shall not escape / the
hell under us and the fendes ready to draw us thither / ye Judge angered without
forth / y^ conscience bytynge and tourme^tynge withinforth / and sythen the
ryghtwyse man scarsely shall be saved / the wretched sinner so vnbelapped with
wretchedness where shall become whom feere of dampnacyon and remorse of
conscye^ce shall shake and make him to cry for woo. A woe may I than be which
have so many matters in me to bry^ge me to y^ woo / it shall be Impossyble yt
day to hyde me / and it shall be to terryble and ferefull that day to show
me / and nedesly I must appear / and by myself without any procuratour and
answer for all y^ I have done here / and not only for mine own deeds but for
all perteyny^ge to my care and Iurysdyccyon where any defaute has been there I
ought to have help. O how shall I answer for many which am not able to
answer for myself. O my charge is great my remembrance is little / my harms
do multyplye and I seek no help. I run to death all vndysposed / my mind is
not with me. I am not with my self. I seek more for your advantage than for
myself my burden I shall only bear for myself. Now might I make it lyghter
but I enlarge it and make it heuyer my self / but now arise you sinner and see
how woo is thy sauyoure Christ Ihesu / he is called ye lamb of god by whom thou
art redeemed his merytes are suffycyent though y^ sins be never so grievous
call for help and thou shall not be shent / leave thy sins and change thine
entente and purpose to do well / change false pleasures in to paynfull solace
and in to sorrow / look up and dispeyre not for thou shall have help enough /
trust on hy^ whom you dredest / leave thy sin and flee to him you shall have
socoure in all thy needs / run again to him from whom y^ haste ron^en Cry
upon hy^ inportunely whom you haste offended most grievously / and of his great
mercy he may and will of all other help y^ most redely / and meke confessyo^
excludes disperacyon for there shall none be dampened but only for sins not
truly confessed. I mean of such which as have received ye baptysme of christ.
A Ihesu for thy holy name is as much to say by Interpretacyon as ye savior of
sinners / by his medyacyon Ihesu y^ holy name be verefyed of y^ in sauy^ge of a
great sinner / which have been by presu^ptuous will dysobedyent unto Ihesu /
forgete my pride and ordyne it not to death / but wasshe my soul from sin with
those stremes of the blood which ran from the fou^tayne of y^ right side.
Now behold sweet Ihesu with thine eyes of pity these syn^ers which calls that
sweet name that comfortable name of the / the name to sinners of most
delectacyon / the name of blyssed hope / the name of salvation / and
conuersacyon. What is Ihesu but our sauyoure and redemptour / wherefore Ihesus
for thy bitter passion be to me Ihesus / you haste made me now save me / thou
haste redeemed me from dampnacyon now deliver me than of thy goodness and now
suftre not me to perysshe for my wretchedness / suffer not wretchedness to lose
i^ me yt thyn Infynyte goodness yt you have given to me / take to the good lord
y^ which is thyn and remeue from wretchedness for y^ is mine. Now Ihesu /
Ihesu have mercy upon me this time of mercyfulnesse that I may escape the
terryble Judgment in the time of ryghtwysnesse / take me good lord in to thy
large bosom of mercy it shall be not less good lord / for the more thou
receyuest ye more it is / than thy mercy is large enough whatsoever we do
amysse and we call hertely this boso^ is than ready. Admytte us most lovely
Ihesu among the nombre of thyn elect children that with them we may
euerlastyngly laud the / and our profit fruycyon and glory in the among all
those which ^oue thy name Ihesu to whom be honor and glory by Infynyte
duraco^n of eternyte.

Amen.
Here ends a lamentable complay^t that y^ soul makes of y^ wretched life of
the body.
