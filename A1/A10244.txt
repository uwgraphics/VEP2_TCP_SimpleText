VALE.
To the Reader.
AFter I had finished though simply and rudelye this little Treatise of ye
praise and disprayse of Women: I thought it good gentle Reader to declare and
explane in some short preface, two principal causes which moved me thereunto.
The one was to the intent, that all those which at any time shall feel
themselves entangled with prompte, and tedie enclinacion to vice and evil, and
with great slacknes in furderinge that is good and virtuous may by diligent
perusing hereof, learn to a void and eschew such great crimes and grievous
offenses, as they shall see contained and written in their disprayse, and seek
diligently to embrace, and earnestly to follow those good conditions and
laudable virtues, which they shall playnlie perceive to be at large specified,
and abundantly set forth in their commendacions. The other is to the end that
the good examples of good and verteous women if no other thing will move them to
do that they ought, may incite and encorage them to do that is good and
verteous, and bring them to such confirmitie of honest life, that they may be
had in good reputacion before men, and found acceptable before God And the
evil examples of the wicked, may teach them to despise and utterly forsake
those things, that are naught and vicious, lest by to much enclining to sin,
and vice, they be counted as cast awayes before the world, and in time to
come fall into utter, destruction, for if the precepts of the good, will not
provoke and styre them to Godliness and spedy reformacion of life, in hope of
like reward that they have or if the testimonies of the wicked will not
withdraw or terrifye them from doing enill, for fear of like punishment,
surely what then may do it, I know not. These two consideratio^s (gentle
reader) did move me at this time to write ye I have written, desiring thee to
take it in good part such as it is and to esteem my good will and meaning
herein, not regarding the rude handeling of the matter fith. I did it in hope
to profit many, but surely to hurt none. And where as I have made the praise of
women to sound in such sort thoroughly, yt I might seem vehemently to
gainsay my self for speakinge so much in their dispraise, I did it being moved
thereto for diverse good considerations, which I mind not to recite, but leave
it unspoken of willing thee herein to use thine own judgment.

Here begins the Disprayse of Women.
MY pen prolong no longer time,
cut of this long delay:
And now begin to writ in time,
of that, that I shall say.
Take thou some pain a little space,
ne be thou ought ashamde:
When thou ofttimes in secret place,
with great despite art blamde.
Of this thou may assure thee,
none will thy truth dissame:
Save only those that pricked be,
and guilty of the same.
Spare not to speak, spare not to write,
spare not in words to tell:
Spare thou no time for to endite,
an ougely Monster fell.
This Monster is the woman kind,
whose ougelye shape and port:
I mean to paint, writ thou my mind,
not forcing her report.
This woman kind I know right well,
is comely to the eye:
Of perfect shape she bears the bell,
I can it not deny.
But in her fained covert breast,
strong poison she does hide:
And in her heart, as in a cheft,
a deadly stinge does bide.
Which geues an helples hurtful wound,
as has been brought to pass:
Much like the snake that under ground,
does lie, and lurk in grass.
She does annoy by sodden sight,
unless thou can beware:
And kepes the still in woeful plight,
once caught within her snare.
Her poison is so sweet and pure,
and of such strength and force:
That who so does that same devour,
is brought unto his corse.
Take heed therefore seek to discern,
b^ this that follows plain;
With earnest mind see thou do learn,
this monster to refrain.
For why? she is most proud, servile,
cruel without measure:
Reason and law she does exile,
to have her wicked pleasure.
She does all things without forsight,
all godly end despise:
In all extremes she does delight,
such is her wonted guise.
Temperate doings she forces not,
from virtuous men retire:
Her love to thee is fervent hot,
her hate is deadly Ire.
When flouth her slouggish limes do shake
she lies as a stone:
Or when a toye her head does take,
she hastes to be gone.
When mirth and joy is gone and past,
grave visage comes in place:
And makes her like a winters blast,
with froward frouning face.
When she by mirth does seek pleasure,
all sadness set a part:
Her iocond joy does want measure,
naught then may grieve her heart.
Then wanton wills talk does grow,
and laughing with excess:
Both, from her fained heart do flow,
Both are without redress.
Now bold she is, now does she fear,
now seems she mad, now wise:
Now she does laugh with pleasant there,
now tears fall from her eyes.
Now she will have it thus to be,
chance what may chance therebyt
Now from her self does dissagre,
beginning to reply.
It shall not be as I had thought,
no, no, it is not fit:
An other way yet have I sought,
such is her wandering wit.
Inconstancy in her does reign,
she wauerith full of change.
Often blabbing, talkatiue and vain
double tounged which seems strange.
Desiring honor, full of threttes,
disdainful, wishing blood.
Still chatchyng what an other gettes
covetous, nothing good.
Complaining often, a liar, envious,
quick to believe a tale,
Impatient, often tedious,
often dronken with good ale.
Often times she uses Magickes art,
with baudry her self defile,
She has a supersticious heart,
she is waywarde, rash and vile.
Disceytfull using wicked ways,
fine mouthed for dainty meat.
Riotouse, full of wanton plays,
naught may her mind entreat.
She deckes and trims her self at ease,
her face to beautify:
To frame her talk all men to please,
her wits she does apply.
Hateful anger she bears in mind,
till time do serve her turn:
Some sharp revenge for him to find,
who causes her so to burn.
She is unthankful, without faith, bold,
spiteful, of froward life,
In her all goodness waxes cold,
she ever stirs strife.
Oftimes if ought deserved be,
before thee it is set:
And spoke again, again to thee,
as though thou did forget.
If she offend in any thing,
she commonly does use:
By lofty looks and hie speakinge,
her gilty fault to excuse.
She scoldeth, grudgeth, and reject,
all friendship in disdain:
For naught at all does she respect,
but only private gain.
She sekes to mock and flatter much,
yea priuelie to defame:
She reprehendeth (beware of such)
craftly thy good name.
She filles she common peoples ears,
with triflinge talk and vain:
Augmentinge whatsoever she hears,
her mischiefs to maintain.
She fayneth that to come to pass,
which never was in deed:
That not to be which ever was,
each put in others steed.
Her tongue she teaches to intent,
meet causes to deceive:
And once made fit for such intent,
deceit does never leave.
Her forginge feigned countenance,
is ready at her will:
In earnest game a daliaunce,
to weep or laugh her fill.
From deceit thou can not flee,
her crafts thou can not shonne:
Such is the hurtefull policy,
that she by sleight has won.
Though she commit an heinous deed,
and thou perhaps in place:
Denienge still she will proceed
stubbornly to thy face.
What shall I say, thou must believe,
(seem it never so strange)
All that she speaks, and not believe,
if ought her mind do change.
Examples plain and manifest,
do teach, it to be true:
For while all vice out of her breast,
from time to time does grow.
By reading histories thou shall find
what cruel bloody factes:
Committed were by woman kind,
delighting in such acts.
Read Ovid, Virgil.
Virgill, understand
in them it does appear:
How Medea with bloudyhande,
murdered her children dear.
How Paris stole the Grecian rape,
to Troy, and how that she,
Who was in deed of comlye shape)
did willingly agree.
And how the Grecians sought the way, Ovid. Meth. lib. 8.

to have her home again.
And there by moved war to Troy,
which war ten years did reign.
How Scilla her fathers house forsook, Ovid. Meth. lib. 19.

what moved her to do so:
Her fathers purple hear she took
and gave it to his foe.
How Biblis wicked love did swell, Ovid.

to Cavvnus her brother:
How she was turned into a well,
hight Biblis and no other.
How Deianira to her fear,
a poisoned cote did send,
How he thereby with evil there,
his wretched life did end.
How Hippodame did deceive,
her gentle louinge Father:
By marienge without his leave,
causing his death rather.
Because he was by spiteful fate,
appointed for to die,
That day that she received her mate,
such was his destenie.
And how Lauania (to be short) Gene. 28.

most doubtful war did send:
Among the youthful Troyan sort,
which came to unhappy end.
And how Rebecca with a wile, Math. 14.

her son and eke her fear:
Did quite deceive and clean begile,
though they most simple were.
How Herodias with cruel heart, Gene. 3.

did wish John Baptist death:
And caused him by deadly smarte,
to yield up living breath.
Also how Eve from joyful place,
(alas, alas, the while)
Her posterity did deface,
and cast into exile.
Those and sundry more we find,
teachinge us to beware;
In trustinge of this monstrous kind,
whose mischief is not rare.
In time therefore take heed and learn,
this monster to eschew,
And eke with wisdom to diserne,
her wicked witles hew.
If thou will live in quietness,
expelling out of mind:
All wicked worldly wretchedness,
or if thou seek to find.
A blisfull happy state of life,
and long therein to dwell,
Beware a woman full of strife,
avoid her vile counsel.
The fearful bird him self does keep,
from hawk his deadly foe:
From raueninge woulfe, the seely sheep,
from cruel dog, the Roe.
From deceitful nets the wily heart,
with spedie flight does run:
Why sekest not thou in like part,
crafty women to shonne.
The affection of the Cocodrill,
is in her subtle eyes:
She sekes by art how to begile,
if ought she do devise.
When tears fall trincling from her eyne
fair words when she does feign:
Then does she most of al incline,
some mischief to obtain.
Trust not her diverse change of hew,
trust not her spotted faith,
Trust not her coulored virtue,
(I read of one that says.)
A glass does want the sharp and form,
which seems to appear*
And eke a woman's faith is torn,
though she thy eyes do bleare.
Both good and godly men there were,
in old and ancient time,
Most stout of heart, exempt from fear,
and void of heinous crime.
Which by their strength huge monsters flewe,
and made wild giauntes tame.
Strong cities eke they ouerthrewe,
and so increased their name.
Yet those by sleight were vanquished,
of woman's deadly hate:
And lamentably finished,
their lives of cruel fact.
Who has not read of Herculous,
whose spiteful envious wife:
Did cause him end remediles,
his fatal threde of life.
By geuinge him a cote to wear,
sprincled with poyso^ ^^onge:
Which seemed his tender parts to tear,
whereby he su^^red wrong.
Whereby also the wretch alack,
soon yielded living breath:
The putting it upon his back,
did cause untimely death.
Of Sampson strong what need I speak, Judges. 16.

the scriptures plainly show:
How Dalilahe her mind did break,
desirous for to know.
Where his chief strength did most depend, Gene. 19.

and when he had her told:
She brought him to most wretched end,
selling his life for gold.
Both David, 3. Reg. 11.
Lot, and Solomon,
I strike clean out of mind:
With thousands more that I could name
deceived by woman kind.
If such as those could not avoid,
their subtle crafty bands:
But with their pestilence were anoyde,
can we escape their hands.
No no, for why as I do here,
and as I plainly see:
They are as bad as ear they were,
or worse if worse may be.
A thousand ways ne do I feign,
her wits she does extend:
With labor, travel, and great pain,
her beauty to amend.
Her shinning forhead by art she sekes,
with golden roll to bind:
With purple culler on her chekes,
and if it want by kind.
She governs her steps by art,
her hear by art does place,
She tempereth her eyes by art,
her body and her face.
She seeks by art her self to paint,
because she would be fair:
Her greisly shape she does anoint,
in hope of some repair.
She calls to remembrance,
how she may bring to pass:
To frame her froward countenance,
by looking in a glass.
And with her lips she simpereth,
abroad as the does go:
Her shoulders eke she tempereth,
her fingar and her toe.
It is her common wonted use,
with naked breast to walk:
Which thing (in faith) is dangerous,
for in few words to talk.
It means naught at all but this,
(mark well what I rehearse:)
That where her poison planted is,
with greater stroke may perce.
I am compelled now perforce,
to draw unto some end:
For if I speak til I be whorce,
or if my pen I spend,
Unto the stalk to write my mind,
which busly could devise:
To speak more of this hateful kind,
yet would it not suffice.
Such is her craft and her deceit,
such be her wicked ways:
Which she does keep till death by sleight,
do end her hurtful days.
What thing in earth is found more rare,
then is a cole black swan,
Whom ancient writers do compare,
unto a good Woman.
Eke Solomon says thus to thee,
(whose words be wise and sound)
A good godly Women says he,
is scarsly to be found.
Take heed and look before thou clime,
lest suddenly thou slip:
Take heed (I say) whiles thou have time,
lest thou do feel the whippe.
Take heed, beware, be not to rash,
lest thou perhaps repent:
When thou do feel the scorge and lashe
to late thou may lament.
Like as the little foolish fly,
his pastime seeks out:
When he the candell does espy,
and fleing round about.
At length the seely wretch does close,
him self in fire flame:
And so his wretched life does lose,
in seking of his game.
Even so if thou will not beware,
but willingly be entrapt:
Within the Woman's wily snare,
wherein when thou art wrapped.
Thou may not well escape again,
no way is left to save:
Till thou be brought to deadly pain,
to thine untimely grave.
Let this that I have said suffice,
and print it in thy breast:
So shall thou be reputed wise,
so shall thou live at rest.
So shall thou not at all repent,
such well bestowed time,
So shall thou joy when some lament,
by voyding sin and crime.
So shall thou live in happy mirth,
and happlye end thy life:
So shall thou happly boast the birth,
which is exempte from strife.
So shalt thou this life once past,
in joy and bliss remain,
So shall thou have for thy repast,
all pleasure void of pain.
Here ends the dispraise of Women.
Here begins the praise of Women.
C. Pyrrye.
I Chanced once to come in place,
where I a book did find:
Which book did spitefully disgrace,
the gentle woman kind.
Then thus unto my self I thought,
good Lord what man was he:
That with such painful study sought,
disprayse of femenie.
How could he teach his pen to write,
how could his heart devise:
Such foolish fancies to endite,
that all men may despise.
How could his sclau^derous, hurteful tongue
the harmeles so difame:
How could he with a tedious song,
the seely women blame.
I think he was not of man's seed,
that this did take in hand:
Against poor wretches to proceed,
who could not him withstand.
Thus musinge did I sit long time,
at last my pen I took:
And so began to writ in rhyme,
against that shamles book.
Oh wilful witles man (quoth I)
thy pen why do thou frame:
To write thy mind so spitefully,
not forcing thy good name.
But in despite of them do speak,
to whom thou art most bound:
And in most slanderous talk do break
their goodness to confound.
Their labor and their earnest suite,
to thee is spent in vain:
For why? the reap at all no fruit,
but scorn and proud disdain.
Such is thy thankelesse hateful mind,
such is thy cruel heart:
Wherein thou show thy self unkind,
in plaing such a part.
I know no good, nor just cause why,
thou should them so dispraise:
Whose life I think assuredly,
is innocent always.
Perhaps thou do against them prate,
because they be to weak:
To join with thee in words of hate,
and so their anger wreake.
Perhaps thy foolish fancy sought,
some vain and worldly praise:
And so did make somthinge of naught,
which sounds to disprayse.
Perhaps some one did the displease,
in earnest game or jest:
And thou thy fury to appease,
do rail at all the rest.
The self same thing or some such like,
does move thy stony heart:
This deadly envious stroke to strike,
all just cause set apart.
I think thou do not call to mind,
in sickness or in health:
How we are help by woman kind,
whose care is for our wealth.
First (as thou know) she takes great pain,
by trauelinge in bed:
And grievous groninges does sustain,
before she see our head.
As long as we poor infantes are,
and naught our selfs can give:
So long the woman takes the care,
our bodies to releue.
When we would eat she makes the pape
she geues us quiet rest:
She dandleth us upon her lap,
we suck milk from her breast.
When we do naught but cry and weep,
then will she sing and play:
Or else will lay us down to sleep,
our cryenge so to stay.
When we can neither go nor stand,
by reason of our youth:
The louinge Woman takes in hand,
to help us this is truth.
Now when we come to further age,
and can both speak and go:
The woman's pain does not assuage:
she then has care and woe.
In seekinge how she may provide,
to keep us still in health:
And caring how she may us guide,
to live in honest wealth.
When grievous sickness does us take,
she then with busye pain:
Some boiled brath for us does make,
our bodies to sustain.
All kind of physic she does use,
that may be for our case:
No painful pain does she refuse,
our sorrow to appease.
She wakes the long and weary night,
She toyleth in the day:
Our safety is her chief delight,
She is our only stay.
For in all places where I go,
men give the only charge:
Unto their wifes (the truth is so)
because their wits be large.
Each thing to vewe and ouerlooke,
as need may her constrain:
The baker, bruer, and the cook,
no toil does she refrain.
She orders all, man not a whit,
as right and reason will:
Because she is of quicker wit,
her business to fulfill.
It can not be that we could miss,
this gentle Woman kind:
Whose presence is our only, bliss,
and cause of quiet mind.
Whose harmles helping hand we need,
in every thing we do:
And she is ready by her deed,
to put her help thereto.
Her counsel is both good and found,
in matters of great weight:
And doubtful things she will confound,
by skillful wisdoms slight.
The words proceeding from her breast,
are wise and full of skill:
All that she does is for the best,
she brydleth witles will.
Disdainful pride she does abbate,
her malice does assuage:
She bears not in mind long hate,
she loves not to rage.
All ill devise she does confound,
all rancor does expel:
Of quiet life she sekes the ground,
and long therein to dwell.
Vain triflinge talk she does refrain,
few words is her desire:
From quick belief she does abstain,
and flee from wreckful Ire.
She does nothing without forsight,
of good success in the end:
All modest mean is her delight,
to virtue she does bend.
Her listening ear she does incline,
grave wisdom to attain;
Against all vice she does repine,
and wickedness disdain.
A loathsome thing is lechery,
to her in deed or thought:
A hateful thing is bauderie,
which she does set at naught.
Blasphemous oaths she does despise,
false lying does detest:
She does obey in humblewise,
she keeps her behest.
To check, or taunt, she does refuse,
though why perhaps offend:
Her friendly council she does use,
our guilty faut to amend.
She is of chaste and honest life,
true love in her does flow,
She is a sober quiet wife,
her duty she does know.
All evil thoughts out of her head,
she seeks to remove,
Good cogitation in their stead,
her godly mind does love;
With ernest labor and great pain,
her living she does get:
The food that does her life sustain,
is gotten by her swet.
Her willinge heart does not withstand,
such as are poor in deed:
She stretches forth her helpinge hand,
according to their need.
Her countenance she does not spare,
in comely wise to keep:
And joy with them that joyful are,
and mourn with them that weep.
Her trusty tongue does not disclose,
the secrets of thy mind:
In hidden heart she does repose,
thy thoughts to her resinde.
Her harmles mouth his closed still,
from sclaunderous hurtful talk:
To have true virtue is her will,
and long therein to walk.
With wanton: eye she does not look,
on those that she does mote,
Nor gase (her fancy for to brook)
on either side the street.
She lifts up her listening ear,
till each man's tale be told,
If need require though she do hear
her talk she does withholde.
Her helping hand is very slack,
to do the thing is ill:
Wish fearful foot she steps not back,
all goodness to fulfill.
In desent order she does wear,
her garments on each side,
She goes not sluttish in her gear,
and yet she wants pride.
She eats her meat in sober wise,
to satisfy her need:
She drinckes no more then does suffice,
not using to exceed.
Whereby she seems to bear in mind,
man lives not to eat:
But for to live (by natures kind)
receaueth he his meat.
Abroad she does not revel much,
till need do her constrain:
Her self she does acquaint with such,
as virtue do maintain.
What will thou more? if I should write
each virtue she does taste:
The day and eke the candell light,
before my talk should waste.
Good godly men have wrote their mind,
in old and ancient time:
Much praising of this woman kind,
for wanting heinous crime.
Which if thou had observed well,
I think thy grudging heart,
Would not so much against them swell,
with words of deadly smart.
I think thou would not seek to spill,
their good and honest name:
In blowyng of a blast so shrill,
with trumpe of black diffame.
Thou do well know, but wilt forget,
thou see, but wilt be blind;
That they are clear from crime or spote,
by deed or inward mind.
Thy tongue I say will not confess,
that we to them are bound:
That we oftimes (truth to expres)
great good by them have found.
If I did want authority,
to furnish out my cause:
Or were it not for flattery,
then would I not long pause.
To show and set before thy face,
good women of renoune:
Assigninge the their dwellinge place,
yet living in this town.
But now my mind, my pen shall frame,
to set before thine eyes:
And speak of those, whose famous fame,
by virtue did arise.
And does continewe to this day,
and shall for ever last:
Though they by death were take away,
full many years now past.
We find that Ceres did invent, Ovid. Meth. lib. 5.

all grain to ynne and sow:
And for she was to wisdom bent,
most people did her know.
Honors divine to her they gave,
so did her deeds express:
With one consent all men did crave,
to call her good goddess.
The. A. B. C. Carmenta found, Iside. lib. 1. ant. 9.

whereby we do endite:
Whereby in wisdom we abound,
and learn the things is right.
And Pallas the through pured brain, Ovid. in fast.

so does the story tell:
Of oil and wolle first found the vain,
which is a great jewel.
Wherefore they did her then prefer,
before Lady Neptune:
To give the name as pleased her,
unto Athenes town.
And Soppbo eke the Poetresse,
with harp to singe did find,
Which does expel all carfulness,
out of a careful mind.
The malign sprite had Saul oprest,
and long in sorrow tide:
Tull David for to give him rest,
his warbling harp did guide.
Such pleasures we by women have,
whereby we be preserved:
Yet thou do seek them to deprave,
who have it not deserved.
Let this for truth in thine heart cleave,
for prove it so I can:
As many pleasures we receive,
by her as by the man.
But since Poetry does decay,
and is had in despite:
I will therefore without delay,
set forth in open sight.
Examples plain and manifest,
in holy writ found out:
Which being waied in even breast,
this slanders will confute.
To all that read it does appear,
how Michol David's wife:
Such trusty love to him did bear,
that she did save his life.
For bloody Saul, to have him dead,
his messingers did send:
But she found means that David fled
to escape such cruel end.
She through a window let him pass,
so that he went his way:
And in the bed where David was,
an Image did she lay.
Whereby king Saul his whole intent,
and purpose spent in vain:
To murder David he was bent,
he failed to obtain.
Iehosaba did not disdaiue, 4. Reg. 1^.

Iehoas life to save:
When Athlia with busye pain,
the same did seek to have.
Who kept Ionathas in a well,
when foes his death had sought,
The wife in Bahurin did dwell,
that this good deed had wrought.
Ionathas and his fellow eke,
this godly wife did hide:
That when their enmies did them seek,
then were their not espied.
The servants that were sent to look,
for them, did ask the wife:
Who said they past the water brocke,
thus did she save their life.
A maid was she that did discrye, Eodem.

A hitophels intent:
And showed the conspiracy,
that was to David meant.
To Ionathas declared she,
the things before unknown:
So from the snares escaped he,
that erst for him were sown.
When Moses by the rivers brinke, Exodus 2.

was in a basket put:
Where he was left to swime or sink,
being there so closely shut.
Compassion did the woman move,
when she did hear him weep:
She bare to him such earnest love,
that she his life did keep.
And like a mother did him find,
adopting him her son:
Beheld the loving woman kind,
this godly deed has done.
Who caused first let truth be said, 4. Reg. 5.

that Naaman had his heal:
From leprosy, it was a maid,
for she did first reveal.
A godly Prophet to remain,
and be in Israel:
Could ease her master of his pain,
and make him whole and well.
Whereas the new Egiptian King, Exodus 12.

against thebrues was bent:
Because they did increase and spring,
which thing for to prevent.
Commanded be good midwifes,
that were of thebriane line:
That they in no case spare their lives,
but kill the masculine.
Which thing to do they did refuse,
because it was not good:
And to the king they made excuse,
not shedding giltlesse blood.
The Hebrian wifes O king (said he)
are women stout and strong,
Before we com their birth always,
is done, which is not long.
Who killed king Abimelech, 2. Reg. 11.

I say who struck him down,
When he his furious mood to wreke
said seige to Thebes town.
A woman struck him with a stone,
and then the seige thereby
Was given up (his life once gone)
this is no legend lie.
When Haman for to have annoyde, Ec. 17.

the Jews had fully sought:
In that self place he was destroyed,
that he for them had wrought.
For godly Hester found the mean,
to save the Jews from death
By causing Haman quite and clean,
to yield up living breath.
Of many thousands was not one, 2. Reg. 14.

for all the pain they took:
Could make David to Absolon
once give a friendly look.
Until the woman did obtain,
as scripture does record:
That David called him home again
and was his gracious Lord.
Also we find that Debora, Judge 4

a prophetise that was:
Did show the death of Sisara
how, when, and in what place.
Which thing to her God did declare,
with many other cause:
To rid the Isralets from care,
and eke to judge their laws.
When Sisara fled from the throng,
then Iahel Abues wife;
(Whom God at that time made so strong
did riue his fatal life.
A solemn vow did Iepthath make, Judges. 1.

before the God of might:
If that he would his hand so slack,
that he prevail in fight.
Then would he give an offerings swet,
the victory once done:
Who was the next that he should mete,
out of his doors to come.
And as he came behold the chance,
his only daughter dear:
Met him with tymbrells and dance,
but when she drew him nere.
With furye forced his clothes he rent,
with visage pale and wan:
He seemed his promise to repent,
and thus his words began.
Alas daughter thou troublest me,
for I with willing heart:
Have made a vow to God (says he)
from which I can not start.
Then she unto her father spoke,
if thou unto the Lord:
(My father dear) a vow did make,
fulfill by deed thy word.
Even as thou will, do thou by me,
thy promise do not lose:
Since God has now avenged thee,
upon thy deadly foes.
Which words into her fathers breast,
his troubled thoughts to stay,
Did glide, and he from all unrest,
was worn clean away.
Perhaps since Iephthath did lament, 1. Reg. 25.

had not the woman ben:
He would have falsed his intent,
which had be shame and sin.
We read also that Nabigale,
by wisdom did assuage:
The wrath of David to Naball,
for he in kingled rage.
Pursued his oath and sought to kill,
the great and eke the small;
Not leaving one by his good will,
to piss against the wall.
But she to David victual send,
and went her self also:
Whereby she made him Nabals friend,
who was his deadly foe.
3. Reg. 14.
Abiah stricken with disease
did lie at point of death:
And of his sickness had no case,
ne wanted living breath.
I pray you then who took the care,
whose was the pain and woe:
To know how this young man should fare,
did not the woman go.
Yet verily we went to learn,
where he should live or dye:
And so the prophet discern,
Abihas destenye.
When as king David waxed old, 3. reg. 1

though clothes on him were cast,
He felt no heat but still was cold,
til it be fell at last.
One Abisag a Sunamite,
was found to keep him whot:
Who cherisht him both day and night,
and yet he knew her not.
The prophet told to the woman, 4. Reg. 8.

the death of seven year,
That was to come, not to the man,
but she unto her fear.
Did show the same with willing heart,
so they and theirs did pass:
And from the dearth did then depart,
to go where plenty was.
Was not the prophet Eliah sent, 3. re. 17.

to have the woman's aid:
Because that in the firmament,
the moisture then was stayed?
The scripture does declare it plain,
that she Eliah fed:
And save that she did him sustain,
perchance he had bin dead.
Likewise the godly Sunamite, 4. re. 4

gods prophet did entreat,
As often as he came in her sight,
she took him bread to eat.
Her husband eke she did require,
some place for him to make:
And he did grant her, her desire,
his hand he did not slake.
Until the Prophets house was down:
his table and bedsteede:
He found all things when he did come,
there ready for his need.
This do we see that women be,
to man profitable:
Thus do we see to indge of thee,
and of thy fond fable.
And though perhaps in sondrye case,
by strength things were not wrought:
Yet such is Gods abundant grace,
to end the same he sought.
And bring to pass by women kind,
according to his will:
For that they both with heart and mind,
his sayings do fulfill.
As we by Judith may discern, Judges. 13.

who in dead time of night:
Cut of the head of Holiferne,
and not by strength in fight.
The verteous Susan did not start,
from God her loving Lord:
But to his will with willing heart,
her doings did accord.
Wherefore God loved her wondrous well,
as scripture does declare:
He raised up young Daniell,
to plead her cause of care.
And prove her to be innocent,
before the peoples face:
When she was judged to be brent,
in open stret and place.
Sara Raguels daughter dear, Tobias. 3. and 6.

to seven married was:
And yet remained a virgin clear,
so god did bring to pass.
For he preserved the feminine,
because of virtuous life:
But strangled were the masculine,
in whom all vice was rise.
We find how Rahab did defend, Iosue. 2

the men of Ierico:
Wherefore the scripture does commend,
her and her life also.
We read that Marie Magdaline, Luc. 7.

with pitious weping tears:
The feet of Christ, had washed clean,
and wipt them with her hears.
And how by her contricion,
and by unfeigned faith:
Of sin she had remission,
for so the Apostel says.
In token man should be content, Gene. 22.

his wife always to love,
God gave a straight commandment,
to Abraham from above.
That he should follow Sara,
and do as she assignde:
So was expelled by and by,
Agar, this do I find,
This Agar was a strong harlot,
yet for repentance sake:
God did forgive and quite forgot,
the sins that she did make.
The Angel willed her to go,
again to know her dame:
And he that did her faults forgo,
would multiply her fame.
Again unto the house she went, 2. Reg. 13.

acknowledging her sin:
Where she by thangelles appointment,
was then received in.
Amon unlawfully did use,
her fair sister Thamare:
Fayning sickness (O fond excuse,)
and she thereof not ware.
Yet long did she lament the chance,
which was to Amons shame,
In token she took repentance,
though she were not to blame.
And whereas Sichem wickedlye,
with Dina of comelye shape: Gene. 34.

Comytted and that filthely,
most foul and heinous rape.
Yet was it not the woman's fault,
for she with willing heart:
When he began her mind to assault,
did not that wicked part.
Wherefore gods hand, (the truth is so)
as scripture does rehearse:
This wicked man with foundry more,
by sword to death did pearse.
Micheas mother of promise just, Judith. 17.

a mirror fit may be:
To prove all women true to trust,
how so they seem to the.
For she by vow her self did bind,
a graven sculpe to make:
Which vow always she bare in mind,
and did it not forsake.
Miriam to God did give the praise, Exodus 15.

for the death of Pharao:
Sounding timbrels with pleasant noise,
both she and diverse more.
This Miriam was a Prophetise,
Sister to Aaron:
She lauded God in foundry wise,
her instrument upon.
Of many more as yet I can,
a true rehearsal make:
By whose good life the wilful man,
example just may take.
As of good Ruth and Neomy, Ruth. 1.2. Match.

of her that did obey:
Gods will, and from all Idolatry,
did turn her face away.
And strengthened her sons to dissente,
and suffer for Gods laws:
Declaring his just judgment,
for this their righteous cause.
The women have most worthy praise,
for wisdom and mere pity:
With faith and fortitude always,
in most adversity.
As to two Prophets has been seen, 4. Reg. 22. Luc. 22.

I mean Oldah and Anne:
With Saba the most worthy Queen, 3. Reg. 10.

to Solomon that came.
Read the new Testamont likewise,
there written shall thou find:
That woman had the exercise,
of good and constant mind.
Of Christ's birth the mystery, Luc. 1.

Elizabeth did believe:
And not the man old Zachary,
whom the angel did repreeue,
Great was the love the woman bare, Ioh. 10.

in time of Christ's woe:
As Magdaline who had great care,
and from him did not go.
Though his disciples all were fled,
long weping did she sit,
And the sepulcre (he once head)
oftimes she did visit,
She and her compers with oiles pure, Ma^h. 5.

to show their earnest; zeal:
Sought Christ theu laid in sepulture,
in hope they might him heal.
For well they knews and did believe,
by his own saienges plain:
That in short time he would revive,
and rise from death again.
For the oil she spent God to her gave,
great praise, when as he sat:
At meat, and those men did deprave,
who did against her prate.
The poor (said he) from day to day,
amongst you shall remain:
But shortly I must hence away,
as I have told you plain.
Also he did her more esteem, Luc. 11.

who did but two mites send:
Then the rich man though he did seem,
much more then she to spend.
No kind of grace in her was hid, Act. 9.

who daily fed the poor:
I mean Thabita whom Peter did,
from death to live restore.
Ne yet in her than rather would, 3. Reg. 3.

her child forsake and leave:
Then Solomon asonder should,
his parts most tender cleave.
And Pilates Wife did more pity,
the troublous time of Christ:
Then all the men who standinge bye,
blaspheming did resist.
To whom think you did Christ appear
from death when he arose?
In faith for ought that I can here,
or ought I can suppose.
To Marie Magdaline I read, Math. 27.

and to his mother dear:
That first he showed him self in deed:
this thing in truth is clear.
We seldom find that Christ did blame,
one woman properly:
Or any one so fare past shame,
so little set our Savior by.
As Peter did Christ to deny, Iu^. 22

oftimes in open place:
For which offense Christ openly,
did blame him to his face.
And where the scribes maliciously, Ioh. 8.

to Christ had brought a whore:
He saved the woman graciously,
and said do so no more.
Which thing to man's rebuke did found,
but tell me if thou can:
Did he the like as thou have found,
at any time for man?
Likewise the wife of Cananie, Math. 15.

whose daughter was possessed:
With a devil, on Christ did cry,
to give her daughter rest.
To her Christ answered not again,
to thend all men might see:
What constant faith did still remain,
unto the femine.
We find at the Woman's request,
and at a needful time:
Christ being at a solemn feast,
turned water into Wine.
Also at the Woman's insteance, Ioh. 2.

raised Lazar whole and found:
Who then (such was Gods sufferaunce,)
lay four days under ground.
And he be wayled tenderlye,
to them that him often fed:
Martha the one, the other Mary,
for this their brother dead.
I never yet as I am ware,
did read that he did make,
Such sorrow or once took care,
for any one man's sake.
Thus women be not cast awayes,
by scripture proved plain:
Nor th^se that were of ancient days,
nor they that yet remain.
As I for witness could report,
a thousand more as yet:
But to thensent I may be shorfe,
I will their names omit,
I might repet Lucrecia, Ovid. in fast. lib. ^.

of chaste and honest life:
Here might I speak of Porcia,
and of Ulysses wife.
With sondrye more but as I say,
and as before I spoke:
I mind as briefly as I may,
some end hereof to make.
Wherefore do thou thy mind refer,
old ancient books to vewe:
Then shall thou see that women were,
virtuous, constant and true.
Then shall thou learn to be ashamde,
of this thy foolish fact:
In that thy spiteful pen was framde,
poor women to detract.
For though that Eve did first transgress,
whose fault brought us in thrall:
Yet Mary did the same redress,
and thereby losed all.
But since some women wickedly,
did ill in sondrie case.
Will thou therefore so spitfullie,
blame all with shamles face?
It foundeth much to thy great blame,
all fortes to reprehende;
Because that some without all shame,
did wilfully offend.
For as each tree that yet does last,
geues not his fruit a like:
But some give passing pleasant taste,
and some we do mislike.
Or as each clothe is not like bad,
for some is fine, some corse:
Some light of color, and some sad,
some good, and some far worse.
Or as each man is not alike,
for some are thick, some small:
Some pacient, some cholerike,
some short, some other tall.
Semblably of woman kind,
we al are plainly taught:
That some are of most virtuous mind,
and other some are naught.
Wherefore if righteousness should skan,
and judge in this one point:
She would condemn as well the man,
so durst I lay a wint.
Seek not sherfore thine own reproach,
thy name do not consume:
On others faltes do not encroche,
nor yet against them fume.
For of saint Paul this may thou learn, Romans 2.

it does no man beseem:
Worse of an other to descerne,
then of him self to deem.
What creature living under sky,
fish, foul, worm, or best:
But with his kind continually,
does live at quiet rest.
Save man alone who being rude,
out ragiously does speak:
And rail against his symlitude,
his furious mood to wreake.
It seems then a great abuse,
such frowardnes to have:
Yea, it is in manner marvelous,
the self same to deprave.
Whom most we ought to laud and love,
great foliy sure it is:
So sclaunderously them to reprove,
whom we not long can miss.
Wherefore all ye,
that this do se:
Judge them to be
most worthy praise.
The truth to tell,
I know it well:
They do expel,
all wicked ways.
With hand and to,
they do forgo:
We find it so,
things indiscreet.
With earnest mind,
this woman kind,
Her self does bind,
to virtue sweet.
Bear them good will
seek not to spill:
With voice so shrill,
their honest name.
For they maintain,
all goodness plain,
And so obtain,
most famous fame.
Seek not to scorn,
their faith untorn,
Which has forlorn,
all doublenes.
But rather prove,
their steadfast love:
And so remove,
all doubtfulnes.
Be true of heart,
take thou their part,
And as thou art,
a strong defense.
So they most meke,
will ever seek:
To do the leke,
in recompense.
Farewell adewe,
love woman kind:
For they be true.
