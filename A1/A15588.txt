Here begins the life of the holy and blessid vyrgyn saint Wenefryde /
IN the west end of great Britayn / which now is called England is a prouynce
which is named walys / This said prouynce was sometime inhabyted of saints of
many and diverse merytes / and embelisshed and decorate unto this day with
Innumerable prerogatyuys in many wyses / Among whom there was an holy and devout
man named beunow a man of hye merit / and this holy man lad religious life /
and was a monk in the said england / he edyffyed chirches / and ordained
certain brethren and prestes for to serve god in many places / and hit was so
/ yt by dyuyn prouydence he was warned and admonested to desire and ask of a
myzty man named Theuith a certain place to bylde on a chirch for his health /
which he dylige^tly demanded / and the seid theuith granted to him gladly and
with good w^^ and also co^mysed to him his douzter named wenefrede whom (...)
^^uyd tenderly for to be instruct and tauzt / prayeng him to bisech almyzty god
/ that he would dispose her conversation to the (...) and honor of him / which
thing god knowing what should ^^^we thereof would not suffer her to be lost ne
perisshed / for the maid wenefrede desired by an ardau^t desire to be the
temple of god in time coming / And such things as she understood by stryng of
her eres she held and enprynted fast in her mind / and that she conceived in
her thouzt / purposed verily ^acco^plyss^^ hast^ly in works / so then by
thynspyracion of the holy ghost this holy vyrgyn prouffytyng in virtues showed
unto ^er master fe^ now the very purpose of her mind saying / I have
determined in my self to forsake all the lust and plaisir of the world / and
have disposed to conserve and keep my virgynyte vndefowled unto Christ / which
thing o holy fader I byseche the deuou^^ly that thou wylt impetre and get
grant of my fader and mother / which thing he showed to hem / and they
gladly consentid / and therwyth were well pleasid / Then this holy vyrgyn
recordyng and desyryng tenprynte in her mind such holy words and lesso^s as
floweden out of the mouth of her master / suffered none er^^ely n^ worldly
vanytees to enter in to her / bnt lay often in the nyztes in the church / And
of time she solycyted the holy man to make a sermon / and to treat to her / of
her spouse Ihesu crist / and to show his works digne and worthy of laud and
p^ysynge / It happed on a sunday that her fader and mother were gone to the
Church / and this blessid virgyne was left for certain cause at home / and
one named Cradoke sone of king Alane entryd and saw this holy virgyne syttyng
by the fire / which anon as she saw the kings sone aroos / and humbly
demannded him what was his playsir / and he said to her / thou know well
that I am a kings sone / which have plente of rychesses and honors / and of
them shall depart largely to the if thou wylt consent to my peticion and
desire / she anon felyng ^ym to make his request for to have a do with her /
and a little case down shamefastly her chere dyssymylyd her to be a shamed that
he had founden her not well arrayed ne apparaylled / and said to him suffer a
while lest my fader come and I shall go in to my chamber / and shall come to the
again without taryeng / to which the young man granted / and she went in to
the chamber and by a bye door of the chamber she went out / and ran fast
toward the church / which so fleyng was anon known to the young man / and
then he being wood wroth by cause she fled fro him / by cause she would keep
her virgynyte / and with a suerd (...) followed after and ouert^ke her and
holdyng her with a stern (...) said to her in this wise / sometime I louyd the
/ and desytrd the to be joined to mine enbracementes / and now thou despysest
him yt desires the / Now know thou for certain yt either thou shall this
present time suffer me to have my will of the or without ^^ryeng I shall smite of
thyn head with this swerd The holy vyrgyn having her full hope and trust in
our lord answered him in this wise / I am coupled in matrimonye to the sone of
the everlasting king and Judge of al men / wherefore I may have none other / And
by cause I will not long abuse the why be I live I shall never love ne forsake
him / and therefore be thou assured that thy menaces / ne fair words /
thretenynges / ne promesses may depart me fro the swetenes of his love / to
whose enbracementes I am strayned and coupled by devotion / This becherous young
man herynge him self to be despised / and put fro his voluptuons desire took
out his swerd / and smote of the head of this blessed vyrgyne /

And anon as the head of the virgyne fylle to the earth / In the same place a
bright and fair well began to spring up / largely gyuynge out water and
plentyuously which contyn^eth to flow unto this day / gyuynge health by the
merytes of this blessed vyrgyn to many seek people and malades / Now was it so
that the place where her head was smyton of was hangyng of an hylle / and the
head rollyd down to the church door / and when the people in the church saw
the head / there was a great noise and rumor / in so much that her fader and
mother came / and saw how her daughter was biheded / whereof they were sore
basshed / and made a lamentable noise and sorrow saying that they had hoped /
that she should have been a servant of god and to have lived an holy life / and
when beunowe herd this noise and rumor / he came and saw; this head of the
holy vyrgyn and (...) none he took it up / and saw where the kings sone stood
a (...) his swerd on the grusse / to whom he said be king in his usage these
words / O thou wicked man which have (...) thy fair yongth / and art sone of
the bygnage of a king (...) slain by crime as an homycyde this noble vyrgyn
(...) pentest the not that have commysed so great a sin (...) troubled the
pees and have defowled the church by thy (...) and have gretely trespaced and
wratthed out lord / and (...) not / Now for as much as thou have not spared
the (...) have given reverence to the sunday / I byseche my lord (...) whom
thou have commysed sin unworthily that (...) the by digne recompensacion /
and these words said and (...) the young man forthwith fill down to therthe and
e^spyred (...) / and incontinent wonderfully the body of him so deed (...)
^yght and presence of many was molten and (...) in to therthe / and his soul
drowned in hell the^ (...) mother having no comfort / but wayl^yng the death of
(...) desired to make bewaillynges / and the holy man (...) to thaulter to say
the mass / which being fynyss^^d (...) people awaityng on him / and having
hope unto god / he went to the body lyeng deed / and unto the people made a
sermon (...) al other words he said how this blessid virgyn had / made a vow
to almyzty god / but for tacco^pliss^e the same by cause of her death she had
not time eo^grue to fulfylle it / and therefore I exhort and desire you to knele
down to ye ground and to pray deuou^^^ly unto almighty god that of his grace it
would plese him to reyse her fro death to life / to the end that many be the better
/ and more constaunt in the faith / and that much good should thereof enfolowe
/ After then this long prayer / the holy man beunowe aroose up holdyng his
hondes up in to heaven said / O lord Ihesu crist for whose love this holy virgyn
has forsaken all worldy things / and has desired heavenly things we humbly
byseche the with all our might and devotion that you at this time grant to us
theffect of our peticion and prayer / and for what cause this vyrgyne has
suffered death we know not but that she is in everlasting joys / having no need
of our company / thou nevertheless most debonayr fader grant to us thy sons
/ mekely besechyng the benyngne and exaudyble / that it may please the to give
thyn assente to our peticions and prayers / and command thou that the soul
of this holy vyrgyne may be brought ageyn to her body / and that she may be
restored to her first life / And that by the grace of thy mercy may magnefye thy
name / And after long space of life / she may return to the her spouse / that
is the only sone of god the fader with whom / and with the holy ghost lyuest
world without end / and when al had answered amen / he set the head to the
body / and the holy vyrgyne aroos / as she had arysen fro sleep / wypyng her
visage / and clensynge it fro the duste and swette / and replenysshed all the
assistentes stondynge with wonderful admyracion and joy / Nevertheless in the
place of her neck where as her heed was smyten of / And after by dyuyne
operacion was set on ageyn and resolydate / a lytil redenes in manner of a
threde went about the neck / and showed the place where as hit had be cut
of / And that ever after abode for to show the absicycion and thostencion of
the miracle / as long as the vyrgyn lyuyd / and alwey abode in one manner / and
the place where as her blood was shed was called first / the dry valeye /
And after that the head of the holy vyrgyne was cut of and touchyd the ground /
as we before have said sprang up a well of spryngyng water largely / enduryng
unto this day / which heleth al languours and sekenesses as well in men as in
bestes / which well is named after the name of ye vyrgyn and is called saint
wenefredes well and by cause there was much blood of her shed in ye well and
ye descente of ye hylle / ye stones yet in to this day appiere as well in the
well as in the river rennyng down al besparklyd with blood / which thing is
merueyllous / For yet at this day is seen the drops of blood / like as hit
was the first day / And the moss that grows upon the said stones / smellyth
like encence / which well (...) famous and of great renomme / and well known
/ to (...) goo thither / and endures as it did the first time / and the stones
as we said to fore ben yet daily blody / (...) with dropes of blood / showing
openly / that by the (...) of the said vyrgyne / all they that call on (...)
or disease / our lord shall case and deliver them /

Then for to know how this holy vyrgyne (...) lyuyd after that she was
trysed fro de^he to life (...) of life she had unto the end she departed (...)
world / ye shall here al alonge herafter following (...) Then after she was
thus ^ysed as aftre (...) that day after she was abiding all the (...) Beunowe
/ and intended with (...) devotion unto his sermons / and to all thynge^ (...)
to god / desiring with a (...) formed fully to serve and please (...) she
sufficiently Instruc^e and informed after (...) of the disciplyne of the holy
Church (...) desired humbly of her master to be (...) n^ the holy v^yle /
Saying / I may in no (...) thy feet unto the time / that thou ^as^ (...)
theff^^t of this holy pro^ession / and so thou to (...) in thabyte of relygyons
disciplyn / and that I may (...) thyn hondes in such wise that I may in the
inward (...) my soul persevere in the seruyse of our blessed lord (...) fader
I humbly byseche the / that thou will not (...) my peticion ne desire / but to
fulfylle my (...) late me make mine auowe as it (...) this holy man showed the
desire and will of this (...) to her fader and mother / and said to them / that
they should (...) the desire of her / for she was chosen of god / and had (...)
her his dyuyn grace / they then benyngnly (...) and the holy man then to
fore much people g^f / to her the (...) vayll / and professyd her / and hallowed
in the (...) of them (...) which blessed vyrgyne after tha^complysshement and
vow made of her holy desire / anon she flouryd in all virtue / and deuoutely
studied / how she might best observe the rewlys of the disciplyne of Relygyon /
And in short space she acquyred and was full Instruct in the perfection of all
the obseruaunce that thereto bylongeth / After this this holy man Beunow was
admonesshed by a vysyon / that he should depart thens / and goo dwell in
another place / to the end that he might auaylle and do much prouffyte to much
people / And there upon he called the fader and mother of the blessed vyrgyne /
and said to them / ye shall understand / that I must depart from hens / and
may no longer be here with you / For god has called me to another place /
wherefore / I exhort you / that ye besyly entende unto the admonycions and
ensamples of your daughter / knowing for certain that she is not ordained an
only ensample to you / but also a very ensample of health unto all people
herafter for to come / Then he turned him to the holy vyrgyne / and said to
her / Our lord almighty god has commanded / the for to succeed and follow my
labors and excercysitees / and to honor this habytacle / to follow the weye
of life / by me to the showed / And the same to show to other / Thy charge
shall be from hens forth for the love of god to haunte and dwell in this place
/ and to gadre and ^ssemble vyrgyns to live here in the seruyse of god with the
/ But one thing know thou for certain / that thou shalt not fynysshe thy
life in this place / For when thou have served god here in besy abstynence of
the body and afflyction of spyryte / by the space of seven year / hit behooves
the to goo to another place / which shall be showed to the by our lord / and
he shall adresse the thither / where thou shall enlumyne the derkenesse of many
hertes / And reteyne well / that thy memory and remembrance shall be clerly
spread in this world / and as much thou shall be more of merit / so much more
shall many be remedyed by the of their myseryes and hurtes /

When this holy virgin understood the departing of her master and doctonr
/ she was much sorrowful and heavy / And wept sorowfully for his departing and
absence / Then the holy man Beunowe ladde her by the right hand to the well
which sprange at the place where her head fylle / when hit was smyten of /
whereof we have to fore remembryd / and made her to stand upon a stone / which
lies there on the brynk of the said well unto this day / and is called the
stone of saint Beunowe of them that dwell there / And he said to her these
words following / Behold said he andsee here the steps of thy passion / loo
these stones here besprynct with thy blood show that thou have for gods love
suffryd here mar^^ dome / and to the perpetuel honor of the / and to the
monumente of many other they keep the shedynge of thy blood of which they ben
besprynct / fresshe and rody / Now therefore with a dylygent and good mind
reteyne and keep my words / that they may come reverently to the knowledge of
many (...) / Know thou for certain / that three yeftes ben given and /
granted to the of almighty god / which shall be (...) showed to the title of
thy lawde and praysynge / And shall be arettyd to the love of thy devotion in
the minds of them that shall come herafter / The first is this / that the
(...) besprynct and wette by spryn^lyng of thy blood (...) never in this world
be wasshen awey / and put out (...) the swyfte course of this water be taken
awey / but for (...) and showing of thy passion shullen alwey (...) blody /
doing miracle unto the glory of god and (...) geste / and also to the
tryumphe of thy chastyte / The (...) yefte or grant is this / that who someuer
he be / that is (...) by any Infortune / and requires the / and desires to be
(...) by the fro his dystresse or oppressyon / the first / the (...) the third
/ certainly the thyrdde time / if it be done effectu^lly with a good will he
shall enjoy that thing that he demanded and asked / And if hit so hap that
he get ne have not tht thing that he desired / ne that it follow not after
his reticion / know he for certain / that if there be any thing more godly
for the health of his soul / than hit / that he demanded yt it shall follow
and come to him for his good / for oftymes we of our frelnes ask and desire
things / which parauentur should torn more to our hurt / than to our well /
god knows what it best for us / The (...) yefte is thy^ / that (...) now I
shall depart and go for the for to dwell in a conuenyent place stondynge on
the sea side / which god of his benygne grace has granted to me / And though
hit be so / that I shall be far fro the / yet almighty god has commanded
the to remember me every year with thy yeftes / wherefore when thou wylt adresse
to me such a thing / as thou shall make ready for me / thou shall hastily come
with thy yeft to this present well / And what someuer it be / commytte his
first unto god / and after put it in to this well confidently / and thou
shall see anon that thing so put in be taken up fro the well / and be
led forth by the might of god by the coure of the water in to the great
floode unhurt / And by the wy^e of almighty god thorugh the flodes of the sea
/ it shall come unto the yate of my little lodge or dwelling by the tornynge of
the wawes vndefowled / And this behooves the to (...) every year / as long as
god will that I shall live / for god commanded the so to do / These three
things ben granted to the of our lord god / assigned specially / and given
to the by dyuyne prerogatyf / And as long as the world (...) endure / this
shall be magnyfyed to the halowyng of (...) memory and glory of thy lawde /
by the telling and (...) of much people / These things thus expressyd and
(...) / the holy man finally departed fro her / For which cause (...) year the
first day of May she sent to her master a (...) while he lived in the manner
as is before said / And though so be that the space between them / and the
distaunce was more than fyfty mile / yet nevertheless in space and time of one
night / by the rollynge of the wawes and stremes of thesee it was brought to
the yate of his monasterye / and was founden on the gravel of the Ryuage / And
the first yefte that she sent to him was a chesyble of her own making
which was founden unhurt / as before is reherced /

Hit happed that after this holy man Beunowe being aged departed out of this
world and deyde / whoos death when it was told unto saint Wenefryde / she
left for to send more any yefte to him / And she remembrynge his words that
she should after seven year goo in to another place for to dwell in / And after
seven year complete she departed fro that oracle and place / like as she was
warned by the holy man / And went unto saint deyfere / This man was an holy
man and great toward our lord keeping his commandments / and not departing
from his Iustyfycacions / And after when she was come as he was in the night
besy in his prayers and persevering in devotion / A voys from heaven souned in
his eres saying / Say thou to my most dear daughter wenefryde / that she go in
to the place which is called henthlacus / For there she shall obtain the
desire of her vow / and when he had told to her this / anon she took leave of
this holy man / and bad him fare well / And gladly went unto that place / And
there she finding saint Saturn / which knew by dyuyne reuelacion the
purpose of her iourneye and said to her theffecte of her coming / and gaf to
her this answer / There is a certain place called wytheryacus / where as is
Abbot Elerius a man of great virtues / he shall tell to the what the behooves
to do / which thing anon as she had understood / forthwith she took her
way and went to that holy man / whoos coming the holy man having knowledge
^^fore by the holy ghoost / went to mete her / and brought her in to the
Church / there for to pray and say her deuocions and that fynysshed he took
her by the hand / and ladde her (...) the Couente of vyrgyns / which was
there / to whom he said these words / loo almighty god has ordained this
(...) vyrgyne for to dwell with you / This is that maid (...) frede / whoos
clear fame now late has brought to your (...) which has despised for to
keep her chastyte the bla^dysshyng words / and the concupyscence of him that
persecuted her / And chase lever the smiting of / of her head / than to lose
her vyrgynyte / and rather to deye than to consent for to do sin / Therefore
now she is comen to you for to dwell with you And to abide here the day of her
departing out of this world wherefore be ye ioyefull for her coming / and
receive ye en^encynge her deuoutely / as celestyall tresoure dwelling among
you entendyng besyly to her works / and with all your entente following her /
For this place as long as the world shall endure / for her sake shall be
renommed by great fame / After thise words he turned him unto a lady which
was his own mother / and was prelate and chyef above the other relygyouse
nonnes / and said to her / O thou my most der^moder / I commytte to the
specially the cure and charge of this vyrgyne / which is well byloued to god /
thou therefore follow her stappes and works / And take thou the charge of all
things that long to her / And what thou may know that shall please her /
that do and execute dylygently and incontinent / These words fynysshed and
said / the holy confessor departed and went his wey / And saint wenefrede
remained and abode from than forthon with the maidens servants of god /
Then was in her / great abstynence / keeping her good and holy life / prayer
perseueryng / and humble conversation / Other vyrgyns took of her ensample of
pacyence and obedyence / They made her in all things that apperteyne to their
health / a forgoar and ensample to them / And in her were fonnden all things
plentyuously that were of honest and virtue / whereof for to recyte or reherce
of what abstynence that she was in her life / what anguysshes or what pain that
she suffryd in her body / what scarcenes or penance she excercysed it were
over long to tell / but shortly I shall say you / that she left no thing
undone that she knew might le to the health of her soul / or to the good
ensample of other / diverse and many of devout people came to her by companyes
desyryng to see this blessed vyrgyne / and to behold the place where as the
when was in her neck / that her head was smyten of for the love of Ihesu Christ
/ and by the prayer of the holy confessor was raised fro death and reuyued
again / And they held the place worthy of hyhe reverence in which she duel
^yd / to sum it suffysed only to see her / and to speak with her / And sum
were so importune / that they would not be content / but they might see the
place in her neck of the cuttynge of / of her head / and humbly prayed her to
show in to them / To whoos deuocions and requests she dredde to warn or gayn
say / lest their devotion might there by be lassed / or that they might depute
it to the pride of her / And when they saw in her neck the skin / and the
place of the cuttynge by a moch^ differente color unlike to the remenaunt /
they couthe / ne might not absteyne them fro weeping / blessyng and gyuyng laud
to almighty god in his great and merueylous works And returned home with great
wondre and ad myracion / On a certain day the blessid Elerius thabbot entryd
into the cloystre of the nonnes for to vysyte saint wenefrede / Then the holy
Abbot for occasion to show to her / that he often had remembryd in his mind
said to the holy vyrgyne saint wenefrede / I Joy gretely said he / that god
has provided the to come to this place / For to help to bring my body to
sepulture / And after my death that thou remember and have me in thy mind and
prayers / To whom the holy vyrgyne answered / Not so fader / shall it not be /
neither it is not so predestynate ne ordained of god / But it behooves the to
live after me / and first thou bring to the earth my lady thy mother after
that she shall be departed / and after certain years passed after that for to
burye my body / For thus god has ordained / And when this holy man had herd
these w^^des he took his leave and departed fro her / And soon after^ he fond
her prophecye true / For after a little time (...) his daughter deyde and
departed out of this world / And after that the holy saint wenefrede was made
prelate and (...) perist of all the covent of the nonnes / And had the (...)
governance of them many years / And at the last our (...) syd lord Ihesu
Christ desiring and willing to take (...) handmayde and servant fro the
lawrouse seruytude of (...) life / and to bring her to the rest of perpetuel
bliss On a night as she was in her oratorye / our lord let her have kn^^lege
of the day of her obyte and departing out of th^^ life which should hastily
ensiewe and follow / And anon as she understood and felt her self called and
vysy^ed by the grace of god / she with an holy devotion began to make her
ready unto the joys that she was called to / Then contynuelly in the nyghtes
she was prayenge in the Church / And in the day time she virtuously occupied
her self in all things longing to her cure and charge / And when this
rumor came to the knowledge of saint Eferius / he anon was in great anguysshe
and wayllynge for the departing of this holy virgyne / whom he entierly loved
/ knowing certainly / that she was endowed with specialle grace / And desired
for (...) synguler well / that as long as ^e should in the (...) of this life
endure / that he might dwell and avyde with her And this he desired with great
devotion Then after this the blessed vyrgyne began to suffer great sekenes
in all her body / And as the languour and maladye was vehement and encreaced
daily / she knew verily that she approached toward her last end / Then she
lift vy her mind toward almighty god / and humbly prayed him to hane mercy on
her / And that he would be the kepar and wardeyn of her soul / And that the
devil should have no pray of her / Then she did do call to her the holy Confessor saint Elerye thabbot which houseled her with the blessid body of
our lord / Then the day of the kalendes of Nouembre / she began to wexe
feeble by the dissolucion of her body / but for all that she rested not for all
her pain and sickness to preche and enfourme them that were assistent with
holy and blessid exhortacions Then when she was enfeblyd with ouermoche
pain / of grievous sekenesses / And felt well that on the morn she should
depart and fynysshe her bodyly life / she let do call to her saint Elerye /
and prayed him that her body might be buried / and put in the sepulture by the
body of saint Theonye / his mother / which request the holy man granted
benyngly / And then the holy vyrgyne entendyng with all her hohe heart in
prayer unto almighty god the day of the thyrdde Nonas of Nouembre / she
commended her spyryte in to the hands of her maker to be associate unto the
celestyalle company of saints / Then the holy man commendyng her soul unto
god / began to procure besyly / and make al thing ready that he saw
apperteyne to the exequyes of the blessed virgyne / And when all was done
that appert^yned to her funeral seruyse / he buried her in the place that she
desired / And with great wayllynges and lamentacions her body was leyd in the
sepulture / And in the same place the said body lay unto the time of king
Steven king of England / In whose time by dyuyne reuelacions and miracles
before going the bones of the blessed vyrgyne were translated unto thabbeye of
Shrewsburye / where much people coming by the suffrages and merytes of many
askyng remedy of their Infyrmytees and sekenesses have been heled and maade all
hole

Thus ends the martyrdom of this blessed saint / Saint wenefrede / which
passion and decollacion was the one and twentyest day of Iuyn /

And also as is before said the life which she after her decollacion lived by
the space of xv year / and the departing of her out of this life was the
thyrdde day of Nouembre /

And herafter by the grace of god shall follow the translacion of this blessed
vyrgyne saint wenefrede / how by great miracle her bones were brought to
thabbay of Shrewsbury / which translacion is hallowed the xix day of Septembre

which three festes ben solempnly hallowed in the said Ab^^ye of Shrewesbury to
the laud and praysynge of almy^^ty god / and of this blessed and holy vyrgyne
seynce wenefryde / To whom late us pray to be a specialle aduo^^t r^ce for us
in all things to us necessary and behoeffulle /

The Translacion of saint wenefrede
Fter that the blessed vyrgyne saint wenefrede shynynge by Innumerable virtues
was departed ente of this life unto the celestyall regne and bliss / many years
after king william regnynge / which first of the Normannes reigned in England
/ One Rogere Earl a noble man and shynynge in all honest of manner and
Rely^^yon began to edyfye a monasterye in the Town of shrewesbury To which
entendynge for to perform hit endowed it with his propre cost and expencys /
And ordained therein an Abbot / And constytued certain brethren monks for to
serve god / By process of time / that place encreacyng by the mercy of god
prouffyted much to many the way of health / And was renommed of good fame and
full of virtues unto all them that dwelled in that countreye / when then the
brethren of that Abbeye shone by virtues / And all that was virtuous they
began follow dylygently / Oftymes they complained among them self that they
had need to have relykes And for to get and purchase sum they did all their
deuoyr and dylygence / And for as much as in wales which was fast by them
they herd say that there were retained the bodies of many saints / whoos
merytes were preached in diverse places / And for to have sum of them they
studyred and sought all the means they couthe / knowing verily / that by the
suffrages of such one they might the better serve our lord and be kept the
better from all aduersytees / whoos daily seruyse they should keep with
devotion here in this world / to the end that he should to them be a patron in
heaven / For which to get / they dylygently endeuouryd them / And troth it is
/ that sithe many holy and excellent Confessors were in the said country /
they began to doubt whom they might specially desire and have / Hit happed
afterward that one of the brethren of that Abbaye was oppressyd by great
Infyrmyte / And the other brethren having great compassyon on him were sore
troubled for his disease / And for his health they prayed deuoutely with the
Inward devotion of their heart unto god / And sent unto other howses of
Relygyon prayeng them that they the same wise would have their seek brother
recommended in their special prayers / And specially they let have knowleg of
the grievous Infyrmyte of him unto the Monks of the church of Chestre / And
then they in the same astonyed in their mynydes went in to the Church for
to pray deuoutely for his health / which fylle down flat to fore the holy
Altar / and said with humble devotion the seven psalms / And one of them
named Randolf which was Suppryour of the hows a man of good life and simple
courage fylle a sleep / And he saw by a vysyon an excellent and fair virgyne
stondynge to fore him / which with a much plesaunt chere said to him these
words / what is this said he And for whom is it that ye thus prostrate pray
/ The monk answered / It is for a brother of our order which is payned by great
Infyrmyte / And for his health here we bye prestrate for to offer our prayers
to god for his health / To whom she said / I know well said she that that same
Monk suffers alienacion of his mind / but and if ye desire verily his health
/ late one of you go to the well of saint wenefrede / And in the church that
is there by / late him say mass in the remembrance of her / And anon the
seek brother shall be delyuerd of his sekenes / And this saying she vanysshed
awey / The monk awoke and common ageyn to him self / remembryng what be had seen
and herd in his mind / would not show his vysion to his brethren / dredynge
to be had in soorne of them / and that they would depute for a fantasye that he
had seen and herd / So after this nyghe upon a forty days / the seek man was
alwey gretely vexyd / and lay in his bed / And it was showed again to the
monks of Chestre of the great and grievous pain that the said Monk suffered /
And for to speak of him it gaf occacion to the monks of Chestre / And after
many words when they bewaylled the seek man / he that had seen the vysyon took
hardynes to him / And told to them of by ordrr what the holy vyrgyn had said to
him / Then they which before time had herd the fame of her / and knowing all
that many miracles had be done by her merytes / anon made them lyghtely to
bileue to that which was said / and also gaf faith to the vysyon / For sith
they were warned to go to her well / and in thonoure of her to say mass in
the church / they were called thereto by saint wenefrede / And said certainly
that she had appiered to the said brother / Thus then they taking their
counceylle to gyder / two monks were sent to the well of saint wenefrede /
And for to say mass in the church that was fast by / and there to pray for
the seek man / And it was so that the same hour that the mass was there songen
/ the seek Monk at shrewesbury was made al hole And thanked the said Monks
for his health / And a little while after / the same brother that had len seek
was ladde to the same place for to give laud and praysynge to god and to the
holy vyrgyne for his health / And when he had first made his prayers in the
church / And after had dronken of the well / And with the water thereof
wasshen / he was parfyghtely made hole / and returned to his monastery in good
health And fro then forthon the memory and remembrounce of this holy vyrgyn /
began tencreace more deuoutely in the hertes of the brethren / in such wise
that they esteemed them blessed and happy / if they might have and get a little
part cerelyque of her most blessed body / And though this seemed to them hard
and dyffyeyle / and supposed should pass their power / yet they ordained to
tempte and prove it / knowynye that there is nothing may resist the will of
god / prayenge him that he would be debonayr and helper to bring their purpos to
effect / by whoos will all things hard diffyale and impossyble without
doubt may lyghtely be brought by his might to hand / And thereof they doubted
not / That time that king harry the first an hyhe and excellent prince / and
friend of pees governed the Royamme of England / by whose auctoryte all the isle
obtained surete and pees / in so much that every man might go and ride
peasybly whyder someuer he would / By occasion whereof the said brethren sent
messagers in to wales for to know where the most and excellent relyques
rested / and in especial to seche where the tomb of the foresaid vyrgyne was /
And when they had found that place in which the bones of the blessed vyrgyn
wenefrede rested / they were glad and fulfilled with over great joy / And by
the consent of the Bishop of Banguour / in whose dyocise the place was / they
made the princes and noble men of the country to be consenty^ge and favorable
to them / This thing procedyng daily forward gaf great courage to the
brethren that they should come to thenteut of their desire But the death of the
foresaid king harry suddenly coming on oppressyd al Brytayne by over great stryf
and trouble / and constrained them a certain time to leave their erande and
desire / and the second year of king stephen the troubles ceased and the land
restored to tranquyllyte and pees / Thabbot of the foresaid monasterye by the
counceylle of his brethren ordained for to send in to wales the pryour named
Roberte with another Monk his felawe named Rychard / This pryour was much
dylygent in the procuracion of this thing / than the other messagers had been /
And sent his lettres and messages in the country / And had answer again /
that if he came him self / that he should return ioyefully / and have his
entente of that he desired /

Then he went / and came first to the Bishop of Banguour / And fro him he
was sent to the Prince of that country / And of him was benyngly received

And when he had showed to him by order the cause of his journey / he said to
him / and ansuerd in this wise I suppose that thy self / ne thy felawes have
not taken on you (...) g^^te a labor without the will of god / and of the
blessed vyrgyne / peradventure seeing not due reverence done to her of them
dwelling in this country / wherefore she desired to be (...) in to sum other
place / to thence that she be honored of ^^^^ungyers / whom they that duelle
here forgete / and (...) none reverence / wherefore I grant it gladly / and to
her (...) sir I knowledge me to assente / lest in resystyng and gaynsayenge of
hit / I be compellyd to suffer her indignacion (...) ^^uengyng it on me / And
though I be de^owled in (...) unclennesse / and am werst of all other men / yet
nevertheless (...) shall help to break up her tomb / and touching her holy
(...) I shall deliver them to you but if so be for the common ^^^^fyte of the
countreye I must needs otherwise entende* For pour labors and vysyons
manyfeste and show that (...) her will / that her bones be transported from
(...) / Therefore go ye confermed by the license of mine (...) unto the ^^ce
where the blessed vyrgyne rests / and as I suppose ye shall find sum
rebels against your disposicion / but tru^^e ye verily that the virgyne shall
appease them / whose affection has incyted you to so much labor /
Nevertheless I shall send a messager to tho men / in whose patrymonye the body of
the blessed vyrgyne rests / which shall inform to them my (...) and shall
make them somewhat the more reasyble to (...) said gaf them leave to goo forth
in pees / Then they wence strayte unto the place where the body of the
venerable wenefred was leyd / And they were of them seven persons / that is to
wit the pryour / And with him the pryour of Chestre named wulmare / and a
priest a man of great virtue named Idon born of the same country / a monk
also whom the pryour took with him / and three other men / And as they went
walking and speaking of the matter that they went fore / they met a man of the
same country / demanding of them which of them was priour of Shrewesbury /
To whom when he was showed said these words / I have an erand to the from
tho men that duelle in the place / in which rest the bones of saint
wenefrede which is called wytheryake / And let the have knowledge / that they
be moeued against the by great indygnacion / by cause that thou labourest to
have awey the bodies of saints buried by them / to whom they have committed
them self / and all their goods / And know thou for certain / that neither
the dread of the prince / ne the thretenyng of his lords / ne ye couetyse of
any money shall not make them to consent to you in this thing / And this said
/ he went his way / The pryour then and his felawes for these words were
heavy and soroufull / and what to do / ne whyther to torn they wyste never /
Then they turned them to almighty god And prayed to him with all the devotion
of their minds that it might please him to send to them his spyryte of
counceyl / And that he which only by the commandment of his word appeaseth
the tempests of the wyndes and the sea / that it plese him to appease these
inimytres / and to confedere the minds and courages of these men unto them /
they humbly praid Then they having very confidence in the holy ghoost held
forth their journey as they had begone / when they came nygh unto the place
where as were contained the bones of the holy virgyne / the pryour by
counceylle sent two of his felawes / that is to say the pryour of Chestre /
and the foresaid preestete fore which were well known in all the countreye for
to provide and solyeyte all things that should be necessary to them he
reteynynge his felawe with him abode that night in a thorpe by cause of the
message that he had herd / and was therefore sore troubled / and when he had
said the lauds of his matyn^sadde and an honest person in lykenes of a woman
appiered to one his servant saying these words / Arise anon / and say to
thy lord that he put awey his heaviness / and sorrows that he is oppressyd with /
And that he lift up his hope in god knowing for certain that he shall from
hens with great ioye^sse for whose love he is comen to this prouynce / shall
accomplysshe and fulfylle theffect of his desire / For in haste he shall have
that for which he shall Ioyously return home / and shall glade all his
felawes in his coming / Another vysyon that same night happed to the same
pryour / There was an Abbot a man of great devotion / which had been before time
fader of that same Abbaye of Shrewesbury / And having old age and full of
virtues departid out of this life named Godfrey / which ^^piered to him that
same night / and of the dread that he had ^^^med him saying / Be thou not of
faint heart but have (...) faith and trust / For we shall well euercome our
enemies (...) with them that shall assiste us by the help of god we (...)
vaynquysshe them / and know thou verily that we shall (...) opteyne that thing
which we with hyhe devotion so much ^^syre / After these words he vanysshed
aweye from his (...) Of these vysyo^s grew sum surete in their minds / and
(...) given to them an hope to opteyne that they sought And on the morn erly
they told what they had seen in their (...) gaf great comfort to the herers /
and suddenly one of the messagers that had been with them the day before came and
said that they myzt surely come / warnyng them to follow him / for that they
desired they should find / which anon took their (...) and came thither / and
first their prayers said / they called the (...) of the said place secretly /
and prayed him hertely that he would (...) helpyng to them / The priest patiently
heryng their words gaf to them an answer in this wise / I shall lightly (...)
your entente with good will / and by cause I shall the (...) be confedered to
you / and that I know the will of god and of the blessid virgyn touching your
desire I shall here in your presence show to you / On the satirday the vigyle
of after in the church which ye here see and behold I was all the night for
to sing and say matyns and ympnes when time was / and when I had said the
psaulter to fore the altar / I l^yd me down upon the (...) a little to take my
rest / and I saw a vysyon which much fered me / And by cause I should not
resist ne be rebel to you / by thretenynge he warned me / And as me thought
no great sleep oppressyd me / but as I had be half wakyng / a fair young man
having an augels chere stood before me and called me saying arise / I wenyng
that he would have awaked me that I should have begone my nocturnal office / and
ansuerd to him / It is not yet time to begin thoffyce / I will not arise / And
be then as me seemed went his way / And the second time he came / and called
me ludder / and said / arise / arise / and I would not take no head to his
words / and ansuerd him as I did before / And with my mantell that I ware I
couerd my head and fylle in to a sad sleep / and after a little while the same
young man came and with his hand drew awey by great strength the mantel fro my
head / and leyd it under my sholders saying to me the third time / Arise /
arise / arise / and follow me / Then me thought I aroos / and followed him /
And we came to the sepulcre of the blessed vyrgyne saint wenefrede / which
showing to me with his fyngre said / Mark dylygently this place / And the
words that I shall say reteyne fast in thy mind / if any come hyder this
year or the next which will remeue this stone / and remeue the earth / In no
wise gaynsaye it not / and if he will bear away with him the bones of this
blessed vyrgyn / repugne not there against / but put hond to / and in ahl
things that thou may help him / and if thou therein be nec lygent / and be
found a despysar of my words / which ben showed to the by gods
commandment / thou shall be payned by miserable and long languour and sekenes
/ and sone after lose thy self / This said / the angelyk visyon vanysshed away
/ Therefore be ye assnred that I shall help to speed your purpos And dylygently
mynystre to you after my might / Therefore of me be ye sure / and call the
other to you / which ye may applyr to your desire / for I will with all the
study and Industrye that I may and can shall execute your playsyre / and the
good will of them of whom the right of this town apperteyneth / I shall do my
best to bring them to your will / and by cause they now be here present / say
ye to them what ye will / for they be ready for to here you / Then the pryour
by the moyen of the priest or by his Interpretacion spacke unto all the
company of men that were there / And exposed to them the cause of his journey
/ And desired them by fair words / that they would give their assente /
showing no thing to them of their vysyons ne recytynge what had happed to
them / but only for devotion that they had to the vyrgyne they had taken the
labor on them / After many words and causes leyd / And after Innumerabro
incidentes / and reasons alleged / at last they were al acorded / And that
they desired / they benyngnly consentyd / The pryour and his felawes gyuynge
thankyngee to god / desired / that they should show to them the place / And
sothly the place where so much tresour was retained is a church yerde of
agood distaunce fro the chircheyerd where now the bodies of deed men ben buried
/ And in that church yerd resten the bodies of many other saints / And is
(...) so great renerence of them that dwell in the country / That none of
them dare presume to enter in to it / but if it be by ^^^se for to pray / And
when the said Monks with their (...) laushyp were brought to that place / the
said pryeure (...) before his felaushyp by thynstynct / as I suppose of the
(...) ghoost anon without any man ledynge or showing (...) strayte to the
sepulture of saint Wenefrede / And ^e which (...) uer was there before ne
knew by techynge of any man (...) place by the ledynge of god without going
out of the (...) came to the tomb of the blessed virgyne / And standing (...)
the head of the blessed vyrgyne abiding his felawes have admonysshed by a
dyuyne reuelacion within forth / that (...) was the sepulture of the blessed
vyrgyne / and there ^e should have that he desired / Then they coming that
sheld (...) showed the place / assigned to him that same place that in to fore
had chosen / and stood by / Then the people being remeued two of the monks /
with pykoys and spades began to dig in the ground / till they came to the
tresour desyird / And the other said and read their psalms / And when the
body was founden / they gaf and rendryd thankynges unto god / And took out
the bones fro the earth / And as they thought that time best for them / bond
them fair in their mantels / and honestly leid them therm / And they there
honestly took their love / commending them that there were to god / began to
return homeward with great joy / And so they went forth with great joy /
saying oftymes emonge other words that they had gotten a great tresour /
which was better than many and great Rychesses / And knew not of what meryce
hit was / besechynge almighty god that they might have sum token thereof /
And it was not long to / but that god would satisfye their will and desire /
For anon the day began to faylle and to wexe derke / and were lodgyd in a
good man's hows / And there they being set to souper they berd in the Inner
part of the hows / a seek man groan and gyuynge out a terryble voys / Then
the pryour demanded the cause of his disease / And it was answered / that there
was a man veyid with great sekenesses / And if he might be ^e^^d / he should
give a great reward therefore / Then the pr^cur took a little water / and
blessed hit / and he took a (...) of the pouldre or dust that was in her head /
and put (...) And badde to give it to the seek man / which anon after he badde
received hit slepte / And anon after he awoke / and aroos all ^^ele gyuynge
thankynges to god and to the blessed vyrgyne / And by this miracle / they were
confermed in the fayche / and were gladder than they were to fore / and more
devout in worshippynge of the vyrgyne / And many other signs and miracles
they had by the way / which affermed that hit was a godly yefte that they
bare / And when they came to a place upon a ten myte fro shrewesbury / they
resiyd / and tarried there / And when they should have departed / they ceude
not remeue the bones / wherefore they counceyled to gyder / And concluded that
the bones should be wesshen at that place / And then there was no water / but
anon sprang up there a fair well / which yet renneth a great course
contynuelly in to this day like to the rather well / In which well they
wesshe the bones of the blessed saint Wenefrede / And ever after the stones
that lie and rest in that water ben besprynct as it were with dropes of blood
in so much that for certain there has been certain devout persons / which
have done to beleyd certain white asshen aippes in this said well / And
when they have been in the water a seven days or there aboutes / they have
appieryd al besprynct as it were with blood And this is daily showed / which
is a great miracle /

Then they sent messagers unto the town of Shrewessbury / from whens they
were departed / And sent word to the monastery / that they had that / for
which they were sent fore / Then the congregation herynge these tidings
were right Ioyeful and thankyng our lord / concluded / that the bones should
be set in the church of saint Gyles / which is in Issuynge out of the
town / saying / that so holy a tresour ought not to be received in to the
monasterye without auctoryte and be (...) nediction of the bishop / and with
the great concourse of the people of that prouynce / This counceylle pleased
them all / And then they sent again the pryour to the Bishop / for to
conferme by his auctoryte what they should do with (...) a relyque / to them
granted from heaven / And in the menwhyle the Monks were departed for to sing
thoffyce of (...) day and night before the body of the blessed vyrgyne (...)
devout courage / To whom they song besyly on the day (...) me / much people
came / that were dwelling there in that (...) committing them self to the
prayers and merytes of the holy vyrgyne saint wenefrede / There was in the
same (...) a certain young man which was gretely veyyd with (...) ueyllous
sekenes / And was benomen in all his members in so much / that his head lowed
down almost to the earth / And in no wise he might lift up his head / And
when he ^^id of the noise of the coming of this holy vyrgyne / he did do be
made ready an horse / And by help of his Friends was (...) thereon / And holden
on both sides by the hands of two men And so brought to the church / where
the relyaues of saint wenefrede were contained and kept / And there abode all
might in prayer / And there was vxyd with much grievous pain / And on the
morn / when the day began to weye clear / And as the priest began
thoffyce of the mass / he began to amend / And anon was restored to his
first health And when the gospel was read / he left his bed / that be
lay on / And went hastily to the Aulder for to make his offryng to god / and
to the blessed vyrgyne saint Wenefrede yeuyng great thanks to god / and her
deuoutely / for the health that he had received / And retorued all hole and
strong on his feet to the hows of his fader and mother / which the day before
was brought thither on an horse by the hands of other / This great miracle
gladded the hertes of all them that there were gadred / And anon in short
space after was showed and told this miracle thorugh all the prouynce which
excyted much the minds of them that herd hit unto the devotion and reverence
of the blessed saint /

The name of her grew every day more and more / and the memory of her /
Then the pryour returned fro the Bishop bauynge his auctoryte / that all
they that in the worship of the holy virgyne / and in her honor were devout
should have gods blyssynge and his / And then a certain day was named / And
showed unto the paroches there about / that all they should be warned that
would come to the venerable translacion of this holy vyrgyne / Then on the day
assigned the monks went in procession with crosses and candellys / and
Innumerable multitude of people for to fetch the holy body of the blessed
vyrgyne saint wenefrede / every man knelynge with his knees / and many for joy
might not absteyne them from weeping / The couente of the brethren that went
out for to receive this holy Jewel / received celestyall bienfaittes by the
merytes of the blessed vyrgyne saint Wenefrede / For hit rayned by great
shoures al about in the feldes thereby / And the covent that were gone out
cladde them with precious ornaments of the church to mete with the blessed
body / and dredde not a little / that the ornaments and munymentis should be
sore hurt by the falling of the rain / but that they had begone in no wise
would leave / mekely prayed to our lord / that by the prayer of saint wenefrede
they might be kept dry / and that they might be preseruyd fro the falling
of the rain / Then in all that procession of them that went out of the
monasterye / And in the receyuynge of the holy relykes ye should have seen the
water of the shoures nyghe to the earth hanging over them / And the dropes
ready for to have fallen by the might of god retained / so that none fylle on
them / And where all the people that were there / being gretely aferd ^e^te the
great rain that was like to fall should have troubled and have fallen / yet by
the might and power of god / and by the merytes of the holy vyrgyn they were
withdrawn / which caused them to give the more worship and lawde to the
merytes of her. And at the last it pleased to all the people that the pryour
which had brought thither the venerable ^e lyques of the said holy virgin
should preche and inform the great multitude of the people of what virtue / and
of what merit this holy virgin was of / of whom that time there was made
the translacion / And when he had told to (...) all this / a long / ye should
have seen the shoures fall about nyghe to them / and fleing in the air /
and wetynge all the countreye by the infusion of the water / except only the
^re cession / then was the holy body taken up of the covent and / brethren /
And with couenable reverence syngyng on hye(...) synges and lawee to almighty
god / and brought to the monasterye / and set upon the altar / which was
made in (...) nour of the holy appostles Peter and pawle honorably (...) for
to show the prerogatyf of the same holy vyrgyne is (...) there to sekemen
health / and have been showed Innumer^^^^ virtues there to the glory and lawde
of almighty god / to (...) me be given honor glory and Imperye world without
end AMEN

Thus ends the decollacion / the life after / and the trans^^cion of saint
Wenefrede virgyn and martyr / which was raised after that her head had be
smyton of the space of yv year / reduced in to English by me William Cayton /
