To the Reader.
IT is not unknown (Gentle Reader) what diverse and su^drie commodities the
dilligent perusing, serching, and reading of Histories, (I mean, the life and
death of those that before us, good or ill, have been written off) bring to
effect, in those that either in the good rejoice (as of God) or seeing the
evil abhor it, as of Satan. As some reading of the insatiable greedy
aspiring minds of immodest persons, most loose and dessolute in life, using
in authority tyranny, highest in Princes opinions, most obstinate in
Rebellion, yea in their highest pomp and pride, seeing them by the least wink
of the ryghteous Judge, come to ruinous, lamentable and extreme myserie,
abhorring the same, forecast with themselves the like extreamities: So again,
others carefully noting the honest, good, and godly life, of learned, wise, and
grave men, in mind meek, in heart merciful, in office clement, the more Noble
the more gentle, the more in authority the more obedient, seeing how they by
the unspeakable goodness of God are preserved and vpholden against their
ennimies, persuade them selves also to imitate the like. Yet some to the
contrary will happily say, Histories are Fables, many of small authority,
therefore doutfull, and some very strange, and so far hence done, that scarce
credible. Therefore (good Reader) I have pende for thee a little piece of the
blessings of God to a Noble man, no stranger, but a neighbor, a most
faithful, trusty and true subject, that thou reading the same may imitate
the like obedience too thy Prince, the like regard to thy Country, and the
like revenge to thy ennimie, that God may bless thee in thy vocation. This in
part discharging my duty toward my Lord, and remembering him whom a
number shall miss, I wish thee health and happiness to Gods pleasure.

Thy friend, Rovvlande Broughton Gentleman.

The Author to carpers.
THou carping carle, thou thou that glad would catch
A faut, whereon to fret thy foming fangs,
Thou Momus thou, thou may go peak a patche,
And Zoylus too for all thy pa^ting pangs:
He lives by fame, whom thou would gladly bite,
And shall for ay maugre thy cursed spite:
And if so be my just report thou blame,
Truth is my shield, and thine shall be the shame.
Swythen Thorpe in praise of the Author.
THe force of death each simple creature knovves,
Sage Cato gone, grave Tullie buried lies,
In vain alas, O England, are thy vvoes,
For Paulets death, cease of thy careful cries
Though death by fate his aged corpse have slain,
In spite of death he living still shall rain.
His worthies such, O happy he the while
But by what means hear Broughton he does tell:
My Muse too base, too sle^der is my style,
In terms more apt he shows it passing well.
Thank him therefore, for thanks he ought to have,
Who makes men live when they lie dead in grave.
(...)am and obitum Clarissimi Viri. D.W.
LIteris tinctus, teneris ab annis
Dedidit sese studio Britanni
Iuris, and tandem fuit ad beatos
Vectus honores.
Stemma si spectes, genus atque stirpem,
Sieve maiores, atauosque claros,
Ex domo exiuit celebri, locoque
Ortus equestri.
Iste compleuit grauidatus annis
Lustra viginti: repetes and Vnum
Atque sex annes fere, si notaris
Tempora recte.
Qui pie viuit, sequitur senectus
I onga, nec tristis: neque talis aetas,
Integris vsquam videatur acris
Sine molesta.
Plurimos annos liceat videre
Qui pie viuit, liceatque prolem
Plurimam. stirpem numerare longo
Ordine natam.
Ad bonum summum vehit alma virtus,
Gloriam* famam decus, honorem
Lenitas semper parit atque prudens
Actio rerum.
Funus effertur lachcrymis coortis,
Corpus in terrae gremio quiescit,
Suauiter dormit, Deus ipse donec
Suscitet ossa.
Attamen coeli spatiosa tecta
Occupat men's, pars melior, magisque
Pura, congaudet, simul atque gestit,
Visere Diuos.
A BRIEF DISCOVRSE OF THE life and death of the late Lord Marquis of
Winchester, Lord hie Treasourer of England. etc.
AS season serve, so men apply
to frame their factes aright:
As day does serve for exercise,
so rest belonges to night.
The Summers sweat in time bestowed,
the Winter frost defendes:
And Winter does for Summers toil,
with restyng make amends.
That fertyll Summers sweat by care,
right fruitful does extend:
That same the barrayne Winter does
give time to waste and spend.
Then Lent, as all times else I wish,
to fast and pray men hie:
To purge their leperus consciences,
and Satan to defy.
To grant and with the Prophet sing,
that all flesh is but grass:
And every tree is rightly known,
by the fruit from him does pass.
As I the twelfe of March, last past,
these places did unfold:
Lo, in my Closet where I sat,
came in a mighty could.
That troubled all my sprites weak
and did their use bereave:
My sight, my voice, my memory,
all in a maze took leave.
ALECTO or MEGERA fell,
or else MEDVSA she:
Or other such from furious place,
me thought appeerd to me.
But that of mylder speech far much,
this while I mazed staid:
Me thought he opened wide his mouth,
and this to me he said.
Can thou (quoth he) with clownish cluche
be numbde, forget thy pen?
Will thou until so idle state,
transform thy fingers ten?
What has be witched late thy powers,
which thou wast wont to use?
Or where is now become the fruit,
of thy acquainted Muze?
Help now in dririe dole, now help
to wayle a woeful case:
His want I mean, whom all ye heavens,
allotted to the place.
If so that thou IGNARVS be,
of that which is befall?
As rudely as I can express,
behold thou shall know all.
And whilst he dressed him self to speak,
no sound he could arise:
But all maugre his heart, he made
two Cundits of his eyes.
And in a ruefull sort, he says,
my Lord, my Master dear:
Is sommoned before the Throane
of mighty JOVE t'appeare.
And as he living still increast,
By mighty JOVE his bownt:
So now to JOVE again he is
to render his account.
Whom? or who? or whence he is?
and of his pryme dissent:
Because all dumb amazde thou sitste,
to tell I am content.
About the time, from Christ's birth,
one thousand.iiij. hundredth sixty and five:
The fifte of EDWARD eke the fourth,
that time in England King alive.
At Fisherton, hight DALAMER,
this Subject true was borne:
Of worthy Parents, as the stock,
had long time ben beforne.
And at his birth, the golden Gifts,
that mighty JOVE could yield:
Descended from the Heavens above,
his person for to shield.
And down upon their flected knees,
the virtues all do bend:
Wtih elevated eyes and heart,
their prayers they extend.
To him that has the power of all,
from whence commes that we have:
That he their humble hestes would grant
and thus they began to crave.
Thou mighty God that guidest the Globe,
with Scepter in thy hand:
That make a footestole of the earth
by whom all thoughts are scande.
Even thou that do the Chariot guide,
that ronnes the world alonge:
Thou, thou, that do uphold the right,
and do defend the wrong.
Grant that we may in each respect,
our powers so apply:
Within this soul, that long he live,
and still may worship thee.
Grant that he may, a member make,
anixed with so me might:
To bear a subject trusty place,
in furtheryng still the right.
To whom the mighty Monarche he,
that all the world did frame:
Said, this was done before his birth,
and PAVVLET was his name.
And you that are my blessyngs too,
I give you charge to see:
Unto the soul, that by the fruit,
the world may judge the tree.
Then straight in spite of all that could
foul Satan well devise:
Gods blessyngs still erected him,
to honor high to rise.
When Ignorance with wilful mind,
his virtue would disgrace:
Nay, nay, quoth Prudence, pack thou hence
that lodgyng is my place.
When lothsom lurkyng treason sought,
a harbor in his heart:
Nay, nay quoth due obedience then,
that parcel is my part.
And when VVLCANVS he that frames,
the Thunder Bowlts of fire:
Came to infecte his modest mind,
with rash revenging ire.
Forgetfullnes supplied the room,
as this my self can show:
Besides a number of the leeke,
that many mo do know.
Mysused much in such a case,
as few have heard the like:
When proof was made to others shame,
reuendgment this did seek.
A needful cause the accuser forced,
his frindship to require:
He granted straight to his request,
and more then his desire.
My Lord quoth one, I muze to see,
you entreat your enemies so:
It me suffices my friend quoth he
he has the overthrow.
O worthy mind, that never lodgde
reuendgement in his breast:
Nor in a wrathful radge did let,
the same to go to rest.
PAVVLET quoth ha, within one man,
JOVE could no more contryue:
For his vprighteous dealyng, I
thought (Pawl yet) still alive.
But what of these, as many like,
that would him wring and wrest?
Judge of the fruit, what was the tree,
which God no doubt has blessed.
And now to thee that haste no power
to speak, as seems to me:
Even EX EPHEBIS sure thou shall
his education see.
From Scoole to Thaues Inn he came,
where so he plied his time:
That shortly to the Temple thence,
his forward youth did clyme.
Where he applied himself so well,
inclind to learned skyll:
Till utter Barrester he was,
he there continued still.
And in King Henry his time, the seventh
in worship did increace:
Beloved of his Prince he was,
made Justice of the peace.
And then high Shirife of the Shire,
within the County of South:
And in Commissions for the King,
commanded by his mouth.
And when that sapient Sire was dead,
whose wisdom ruled the Realm:
And left behind that valiant King,
and most victorious Gemme.
Henry the eight, whose thunderyng voice,
all Christendom did dread:
Who feared not the forrayne power,
Gods Church in truth to lead.
Who tumbled down Idolatryes,
and Pope ne Cardinal did
Esteem, that varied from the truth,
but their Decrees forbid.
By him did PAVVLET worship gain
as thou shall briefly here:
Even as it pleased God to bless,
so shall I tutch it near.
First was he Master of the woods,
and next was Master than:
Of Wards, and of the Liveries,
still thought a worthy man.
And then his worship to increase,
the King did make him Knight,
And then Controller of his House,
which seen so fit a wight.
He made was Treasourer of the House,
where so he likte the king:
That straight his highness thought it good,
to Honor him to bring.
And of his privy Counsel did,
Sir William Pawlet make:
Then Baron S. John PAVLO POST,
he did him eake create.
And after that Ambassador
he sent was into France:
Where he behaved him self so well,
and had such happy chance.
That so the king his wisdom wayde,
and lykte his noble mind:
He made him of the Garter Knight,
as in record we find.
Whose great regard for countries cause,
and fafety of the Prince:
Whose plyant heart so ready bent,
ill order to convince.
That King of famous memory,
to him had such regard:
As to the like so deutifull,
he highly gave reward.
He made him then Lord Chamberlayne,
where so he served the place:
That Lord great master was he made,
within a little space.
Then of the noble and poleteique,
the wise and grave consent:
Of all the worthy counsel he,
was made Lord President.
The king of liberality,
bit lyked well his grace:
To give to him a Royalty,
of Forest, Parck and Chase.
For justice of an Eyer he was,
whereby the grant is meant:
On Chasses Parks and Forests all,
on the hither side of Trent.
Thus did this noble subject live,
in just obedience due:
And whosoever ever lived amiss,
yet he was proved true.
And from the first unto the last,
of all his worthy raygne
Whose noble Graces loss alack,
full long we did complain.
Still PAVVLET under law, in love
in Princes favor stayde:
Which proved well at last when time,
that ATHRAPOS denayde.
Aye longer time her hateful hand,
from sharped sheres to save:
In clypping of the line of life,
that brought the King to grave.
Of his last will and Testament,
for that he had found him just:
He made him one Executor,
of that his latest trust.
If this suffiseth not thy mind,
thereto to bend thy style:
More of the hautie honor shall,
I tell thee in a while.
That well the world, may safely judge
as time and truth did hie:
Right by his virtuous noble fruict,
what sap was in the tree.
That peerless Pearl, right excellent,
that most triumphant king:
His Funeralles solemnized,
and finished every thing.
By right dissent, succeeded than,
that young and active Prince:
By whom the christian Church of God,
increaste his highly sense.
EDWARD the sixte of chyualrie,
in his years, none the leeke:
And surely in Diuynitie,
he was not for to seek.
Whose wholesome, good and godly laws
revived, floorysh yet:
With whom was Baron S. John thought
a Counselor most fit.
Then did that Sapient Christen king
Baron saint John's honor haunce:
To the Earldom straight of Wiltshire did
his Highness him advance.
And Marquis eake of Winchester,
the king did him creat:
Lord keeper of the privy Seal,
he made him after that.
And of the great Seal was he made*
Lord keeper eake likewise:
And thus in hautie honor did,
this subject true arise.
And of the counsel was he made,
Lord President again:
Thus trusty Subjects honor wyn,
that justly deal and plain.
High Treasurer of England too
that Office he him gave:
Who served the turn for Cou^treyes well,
and kept it to his Grave.
For in Queen Mary's time he was,
accounted as before:
And had the Office lastly namde,
and some kind honor more.
For Lord Liuetenant was he made,
of diverse sundry Shires:
And specially of London here,
amongst the noble Peers.
And still uprightly did he deal,
no blot abide might he:
Whose noble fruit did well approve,
what sap was in the tree.
And lastly in the noble reign,
of our most gracious Queen:
Whom God preserve in blessed days,
till Nestors years be seen.
To live, and long to raygne in peace,
Gods glory to advance:
That by her light, the Gospel may,
take place in Spain and France:
As doubtless, by the hand of God,
in spite of Christ's Foes:
Her Grace has well mayntaynde the right
withouten dealyng bloes.
Within her reign (O learned Prince)
was PAVVLET by her deed:
Thought fit to be a Counselor,
in case of doubt and need.
And by her Graces bounty had,
the Office as before:
Wherein he died in honor great,
and many a thing yet more.
What wars were there within his time,
where he or his were not?
Few or none I assured am,
but he or his were at.
As he a Subject dutiful,
five Kings and Queens did serve,
And never from the first to last,
from truth was found to swerue.
So has he childernes childerne left,
who so to duty bend:
That life and living glad would lose,
their Prince for to defend.
That he was blessed many ways
apparent may be seen:
For by the fruit, what was the tree,
a man may easelie deem.
The blessed, childernes childerne see,
the Prophet does relate:
And he, his childerns childernes childerne,
saw grown to man's estate.
One worthy thing, there is to note,
in charge, the which he gave:
When his and childernes childerne came,
his blessyng for to crave.
God bless you all, this was his phrase,
to those that kneeled down:
I charge ye on my blessyng, be
obedient to the Crown.
For that the King elected is,
and of the Lord appointed:
And cursed is the man (no doubt)
that frowns at his anointed.
O ghostly chardge, O godly man,
that youth does educate:
In due obedience to their Prince,
to live in their estate.
Well, from this vale of myserie,
the lord has taken him quight:
In better place (I hope) to rest
within his mercies sight.
AN. a thousand. iiij. hundereth, sixty five,
he was borne on Whitson night:
And lived a.C. six, three quarter and od,
by Computacion right.
AN. a thousand, five hu^dereth, seue^tie one
the tenth of March last past:
He vaded as a Candell does,
when week and all is past.
In perfect state of memory,
he cauld to God on hie:
For mercy by his only son,
and in this faith did die.
Whose life, whose death encoradge may
his issue to persevere:
To tread the steps that he has done,
in Fame to live for ever.
Hear have I now discourste to thee,
some of my Masters life:
But not the third of that I could,
for time does bid, be brief.
If this suffices not thy mind,
I think thou haste no will:
Or else foul CERCES has bewitched
thee of thy former skyll.
Else (doubtless) much unworthy art,
that clothyng for to wear:
And as a Servant to the Stock,
the countenance to bear.
Ill proves it surely by thy flouthe,
thy duty thou deest frame:
For living not for love beleeke,
thou bearst a Servants name.
Wherewith the tutch of that in deed,
the which in me was not:
I buckled to my answer straight,
and all my Mutes forgot.
I said: there is no cause, for why,
you ought to blame me so.
For no man can report the truth,
of that he does not know.
Unknown it was his death to me,
but of his honors state:
He lives not with pen I think
that it can all relate.
And then for me amongst the rest,
a Nouis to the thing:
By my unskillful dealyng may,
discredit much the thing.
To siner heads whose fyled verse,
in hauty style abound:
Belongs this so famous fact,
his honor for to sound.
Where flows the sweet distilling drops,
of fresh MINERVAS power:
To those that on Mount HELICON,
have bathde in silver shower.
For TMOLOS will give judgment sure
though MIDAS yet may be:
By judgment base my wylling friend,
yet TMOLOS will not gree.
My Hermonye much like to PAN,
the cuntrye turn may ease:
But fine APOLLOS music must,
the learned people please.
Yet fith by will I do desire,
the world his life might know,
That Subjects to their Princes might,
the more obedience owe.
And that again by duty bound.
I am no less to indyte:
To leave his glory to the world,
some EPITATHES to write:
And knowing it right requisite,
the common people might:
In that they read as touching him,
in knowledge have some sight.
I am content to bend my pen,
in rural ryme to paynte:
The tale that thou haste told to me,
and of thy heavy playnt.
And will deny in Hermonie,
contention for to make:
I but the plain song, no whitels,
to prick do undertake.
To set in parts, the learned must,
that Art can rightly use:
And let them descant who so list,
that my good will refuse.
Thou toldest me of his virtuous life,
a tale both long and wise:
And how that God preserved him,
in many a enterprise.
How still by friendship he did seek,
his foes his friends to make:
And their redoubled shames came on,
as they did brew to bake.
O wise and worthy learned man,
when England stood at stay:
For Ciuell wales or brutishe still,
went with the thing away.
What worthy who, like meretyng
a right memorial:
Without offense, within the world?
few to the Funeral.
So sound, so perfect, and so true,
unto his country Crown:
So just in every office found,
deseruyng such renown.
More redier suitors to dispatche,
more void of bribyng gain:
Despysing Amboderters name,
and speaking that was plain.
Deniyng to defer a suit,
and causes to prolonge:
More redier to assist the right
and to suppress a wrong.
O blessed of God, whose sacred soul,
the heavens (no doubt) has pearste:
Unto thy years, in thy estate,
full few have lived erst.
But such is God to those that have,
his fear before their eyes:
He geues long life and happy days,
and that none can devise.
Who meekely died in Christ's faith,
whom death could not torment:
But as a shadow vadeth, so
the soul of Pawler went.
Till then in perfect memory,
the pouerbe hitteth true:
Who lines well, dies well, says the sage*
for each shall have his due.
Whose soul, I hope with Abrahame is
quite free from all annoye:
With the father, the son, the holy Ghost,
in perfect state in Joy.
To which good place, god send us all,
in honor of the hiest:
To sing a Song of glory, with
the free elect of Christ.
An Epitaph.
A Baron borne to bliss, a Lord of wealth and wit,
A County eke of great account, for public weal most fit*
A Marquies of much might, of gentle manly race,
A rich and happy saged sire, a man that stood in grace
With kings, and to the crown a subject loyal true,
Has changde at last his happy life, and found a better (...),
