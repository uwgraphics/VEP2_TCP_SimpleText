Grace / peace / and mercy from God ye father of our lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
AFter that god had stricken our head shepherd under Christ / that worthy king
and confessor Edward the sixth / good Christian brethren / which he threatened
by his faithful servants long before / if we would not turn from our sins
and wickedness j perceived that it could not be avoided god so disposing the
matter / for our vutha^kfulnes but that the kingdom of God / at the least for
a time / must be taken from us / and the Christian flock dispersed. The which
thing began to appear to me more plainly / when j saw gods book
conteininge the word of life taken forth of the churches in the byshoprick of
duresme / and a foul sort of jdoles called lay men's books / brought in
therefore: when ye common prayer commanded by publyke authority / set forth
after. s. Paul's rule to ye edifie^ge of Christ's congregation in the vulgar
tongue / was against Gods law / and also against the laws of the realm /
bannishede / and in the place thereof a ki^de of prayer used far dissonaun te
from Gods law / and the example of the primitive church / in a strange tongue
/ farced full of superstition / jdolatrye / and false fables / having nothing
tolerable in it saving that ye people could not vndresta^d it / and therefore
were less harmed there by (although j suppose the popish prelates keep it in a
strange language / least that if the common sort of men should here it in their
own tongue / they would perceav it to be vain / false / lieng fables / and
therefore credit their doings much worse in all other things) but especially
when j saw the lords table / where on was ministered the holy supper of the
lord / according to his own institution and ordinance / was carried away /
the communion abhorred as heresye / and for these / Baals altares reared up /
and his prestes and mo^kish hypocrites / returned to their abominable /
blasphemouse / and jdolatrous mass as dogs to their vomit. Wherefore j began
to record with my selff / and call to my remembrance / not without earnest
calling on gods name for the assistaunce of his spirit min own state / and
condition / and to examine mor depelye / both the doctrine which j had taught /
whereof j perceaved that of necessity j must render an account and that wtin
short time / and also my duty of allegiance unto ye queen's highness / where in j
found my self so clear and blameles / that if the devel himselff and all mine
enemies should do their worste / they could not have accused me justly / another
of word nor deed perpetrated against her grace. And as co^cerni^g the doctrine
which j had taught / the more diligently j did examine it / by the holy
scriptures / and the testimonye of the aunciente fathers / the more sincere and
pure it appeared / j was the more earnestly persuaded / and settled in the
truth thereof / my conscience did more plainly lay to my charge / yt j could
not revoke / say against / nor dissemble it / without blasphemous contempt of
god / and most horrible denial of his son Jesus Christ. So yt j found no
fault in my selff as towching my preaching / but that as an unprofitable
servaunt / j did not so much as j ought to have done / although j had done
much more then some thought j should have thanks for. But what so ever me^ne
thought or spoke as towching thankful reward for my labor / j persuaded my
selff that j should have all things waied after equity / and therefore
considering both mine own integrity / that j had offended no law of the
Realm / but lived like an obedient subject / and also that the same men bare
ye chief rule under the queen's hyghnes / and should be my judges as did know
that ye swerd was delivered them for the defense of the good and obedient
subject / so sone as j herd tell that j was exempted the queen's highness pardon
/ j took my journey toward London with so much convenie^t speed as j might.
Where j found all things far other ways then j would have beleved if j had
not been put in experience thereof my selff. For j found in the place of equity
/ preindice: for law / lust: for reason / will: and soche as should have geven
sentence according as matter had been objected and justly proved / play both
the part of the accusare / of the witnesses and also of the judge: and gave
this sentence immediately / that j should other undo yt j had done / or else:
what that or else meant j knew well jnough / for j had the exposition thereof by
his own holy ghost. The^ my good lord chanceloure / who is always sure at a
need / perceiving that j stood to this that j had offended no law / to help at
a pinch / objected yea three or four times for failing a matter no less
malicious thene false. And because nothing should be left out that might help
forward the matter this good old father of Duresme who had played three parts
before right well / chargethe me with a matter not only malicious and falss but
so folish / yt j had much to do to refrain my self from laughter / j could
not chose but smile. At ye last my l. chanceloure after certain talk had unto
me and mine answer made / concludes that it was not only preachi^g wherwt j
must be charged / ye which he perceived j sufficiently defended by the kings
law (in deed j had asked counsall of them that were well learned in the laws of
the Realm) but also materes to wchi^g ye queen's highness / which were the same
wherwt he and the bushope of duresme had charged me before / as j learned by three
or four of the bushopes own serva^tes / who had made no falss report of
their master before in my materes / but as they wrote home to duresme to their
companions what things j should be charged wtal and what should be my judgment
/ so afterward j found it true. And therefore upon the monday at after no^ne
which was ye thirtyth of octobre / after it was told me by a friend of mine
dwelling in London / who is familiar in the bushopes house / and at that time
frequented it the more to here somewhat as towching me / that he had learned and
was credibly informed / both that all my goods at du^^sme was sensed in the
queen's graces name and that j my self should on the morrow be committed to the
tower / both because j had conte^ned the queen's hyghnes lettres / and also for
that j was a Scot. I say after j herd these things / co^siderig how many godli
learned preachers were imprisoned and commanded to their howses for religion
without all doubt / and yet an other pretense made / perceiving that abiding
could not profet my self nor yet the congregation / my departure might do
both / j committed my self in to the guidi^g of the lord / and went my ways
/ not makig any man privey to my departure. Meeveill not good brethren though
after that j was entered in to my journey / j were troubled with sundry cares /
but che^ly with this lest yt j should now be apprehended by mine enemies / and so
geve the^ that they would have been glad of / some honest color wherefore they
might have seemed justly to have wrought on me their will. For they that were not
a shamed to inve^t false and feined accusationes / how would they have reioysed
/ yea triumphed over me / when they might have laid to my charge flye^g the
queen's realm / and yt not only without her graces license / but being convented
before her hyghnes honorable counsall / and commanded to attend to they espied
a time for me. You may be assured a laweres wit wanting nether co^ning nor yet
good will / and having full authority to say and do what he lust / could
easily have a^plified this crime / and have formed of a small gnat a mighty
elephant. But after that the lord had delivered me / at ye least for this time
/ out of ye mouth of the lion / and saved me out of the hands of all mine
enemies / which hated me / j began to study with my self / and mor
diligently consider / to what end God had wrought thus my deliverau^ce / which
was not that j should now lyve as one that had no regard of gods glory / nor
of mine own duty. But that as j was appointed to be a workma^ in his vinyeard
/ and a watch man over the house of Israel / so j should now most earnestly
hunte these wild swyne that destroieth ye lords vinyeard / gather together / so
much as in me liethe the lords sheep / yt now are dispersed through out
montaynes / hills / and groves / and to geve them warning of the fearful
swerd that hangs over their heads.

Which thing j shall not cease to do / by the aid of Gods most holy spirit.

But for so much as j know right well ye prou^d papists / whose mouths ar full
of bitterness and cursed speech will not cease yea out of their pulpetes /with
bosting and gloriouse words to carp and sclandre me for my sodei^ deperture /
as though there by they had vanquished and overcome gods truth which j had set
forth: and my kinsfolks and friends will much lament my state / taki^g this
to vnki^dnes that j would not make them privey of my purpose / thi^ki^ge that
they should have turned my mi^de: and also which moves me most of all / the
weak flock of Christ who^ j had fed with the true doctrine of the gospel / may
by the subtle persuasions of the crafty hypocrites / be brought i^ doubt of
the verity thereof as though j my selfshold have forsaken it and there by be
offended / and be brought from god: j say for these causes / j thought it best
to answer the malicious hypocrites whose mouths although j could not stop / yet
at the least they should not herafter say but yt they were warned if yt they
would not cease to speak that they ought not they should here yt they would not /
and here by to satisfy my kisfolk and friends / who j know of friendship and
loving kindness look upon my matter with a wrong tie, and also to admonish the weak
christian brethren both to beware of the leven of the dissembling hypocrites /
whom although they be clothed in lames ski^nes / yet by their fruits / they
may know them to be ravening wolves / and also to confirm them selves in that
doctrine which j have preached unto the^ / which also they have received / and
not to be easily carried away into any other contrary / although an angel should
come from heven and preach it to them. Who so will advisedly behold / the
ma^ners and co^ditiones of the scribes and pharisees whilst Christ walked here
upon earth / what shyftes and practices they used to maintain their cloked
holiness / their dirty traditiones / and vainglorious estimation / and therefore
to deface Christ / and to suppress his holy word / and also will with judgment
compare our papish prelates with the whole rableme^t of their chikens unto them /
shall plainly se ours so likei^ co^ditiones and practices / and so lyvely
represent as it were the physnamie of their old au^cetours ye pharisees / that
he would say and affirm that they were eve^ the self same risen from death to
life again. Yea if bushop Caiphas were here in his own person he would for joye
burst out and say as Demea said by his son Ctesipho: Oh oh lachrumo gaudio,
laudo, patrissat, saluos sit: spero, est similis maioru^ suoru^. For what was
in ye pharisees of old time / wheri^ ours now do not excel the^? What pride /
what vai^glorie / hypocrisy / trust in their own righteousness / glory in their
works of devotio^ / covetousnes / traditiones / misco^struing of gods law /
superstition / hatred of the true religion / persequutinge of the prophets of
Christ and of his apostles / sclandering of Christ: to be short / what
wickedness either in ma^ners or in religion can be found in the^ but that the
like and much more does plai^ly appear in ours? yea ours have found out for us
an infinite rablement of jdolatries which they never herd of and would have
abhorred / as masses invocation of saints / worshipping of images and soche
like. But they could never away with Christ nor his apostles but always spak
evel of the^ / and of the gospel by cause it rebuked their vices: and what is
the cause that our bushopes and prestes may not now abide the self same
doctrine nor the preachers thereof but for yt they disclose their hypocrisy and
proud dissembling with god and the world? What will they now say by ye doctrine
and the preachers thereof? What shall now be the talk in alhouses / tabernes /
and bank quetes / what shall now a sort of lewd prestes ja^gle in their
assembles at merketes when they have all their cups in / what shall now
antichrists championes blouster and blow out at Paul's cross and else where /
but that soche preachers as had used that place now of late years were carnal
and fleshly gospellours / soche as would not lyve chaste / set naught by fasting
and prayer / and preached carnally carnal liberty / soche as spak to please
men for profet and promotion sake / last of all soche as were ra^k seditious
heretics / their doctrine was new / against the teaching of the catholic church
/ and at the last they began to suspect it themselves / and therefore durst not
abide by it but ran their way out of the realm. Shall not this be the sum
of their brawlinge divinity? But how much ar we bound to our hevenly master
Jesus Christ that both gave us warning yt they should thus en treat us / and
also for our confort / that he should taste of this kindness before us. Mat. x.
There is no disciple better then his instructour / nor no servant above his
master / it may suffice ye scholar to be as his teacher and the servaunt as his
master. If they have called ye master of the household be elzebul / how much
more his household servau^tes. But fear them not says Christ. But when these
spiritual preachers call us carnal gospelours what mea^ they there by? Mean
they that we be sinners / and that our flesh is not so subdued / but that it
will lust against the spirit? Or mean they that we have pleasure in sin and
in sinners? Or they call us sinners because we could not lyve chaste / yt is /
godlily without a wif? If they mean after the first sort / we confess with the
publican / that we be sinners / and say with.s. Paul / that the flesh striveth
against ye spirit / and yt spirit against ye flesh / in so much yt we do not
those things ye which we would feign do. If they vndrestand their carnal
gospellars after the second sort / we have to thank them; that they will both
show plai^ly whose children they ar (for here in they resemble the old pharisees)
and also that they will serve us here in as the pharisees did Christ / for the
self same thing was in this wise laid to his charge of the^ / and has
continued a common practice sense that time till now / and is not like to
decay in these men's hands / but if it be against there will. After our
savior Christ had dimissed Ioannes disciples and preached to ye people / they
praised god / but the pharisees and the laweres despised gods cou^sall / and
said / tushe he is but a gloto^ / and a swil boull / a boulsterar of publicans
and sinners. This was a common objection and sclander yt the pharisees used to
deface Christ's preachi^g / and dissuade the people from it / for he receives
/ say they / sinners / and eats with them.

What were these complaints and sclanderous accusationes wherwt they went about
to bri^ge Christ in hatred of the people / but the self same that now is
objected against us? Wherefore / say they / do not thy disciples fast? Wherefore
do they ye which is not leafull to do on the saboth? We and Ioans disciples
fast. No no even as he is him self / soche ar his disciples. He is wholly geven
to serve the bealy / he fasteth not / he neglects the saboth / he sets
naught by prayer / he is a carnal man wholly geven to carnal liberty and to
preach the same / and soche ar all his disciples. But we fast / we pray / we
chastise our selves / we are not like these men / we fast twice a week / we are
not so carnal as this man / and his disciples. Were not these the goodly and
holy perswasiones of the old Pharisees against Christ and his doctrine? Did they
not in defacing of Christ and his disciples avau^ce and set up them selves? Did
they not by this color of calling Christ soche a preacher of carnal liberty
/ crepe in to the consciences of the simple / there to place them selves surely
/ under the pretense of a more perfect holiness? And what mean our pharisaicall
hypocrites by termi^g ye preachers of Christ's gospel carnal preachers of
liberty but the self same thing? But this is to be noted of these hypocrites
in all their sermons / when they thus raill against the preachers / it is to
this end to diswade the people from the doctrine of only salvation by Christ /
and to keep this estimation of them selves / that they be holy / pure and godly
lyvers / and therefore men must here and follow the^ / al other ar but carnal
sinners. In this wise the pharisees persuaded the bli^de man / who^ Christ
restored to his sight again / saing / Geve God the praise as for this manne we
know is but a sinner. Joan. ix.
As though they should have said / beleve us / follow our doctrine / be our
disciple / for we be holy / we serve god / we keep ye ordinance of our mother
the holy church: and to maintain this their hypocrisy with all / when other
shyftes failed / they tell a false lie on Christ to bring him in hatred /
saing he is a sinner / and that they know it so to be. You may be sure these
honest men would not else have said it.

But if they should have hem examined what sin they knew by him / they should
have had nothing to say. And what j pray you knows our religious pharisees
by the preachers whom they call carnal / savi^g that which is confessed / that
we be all sinners / and have need of gods mercy? Do they know us to be
dronkerdes / theves / murtherours / whormongers common brawlers / or soche open
offe^dours as ye congregation took offense by our living / if they do let them
openly rebuke it / that other may be afeard to do the like: i. Tim. v.
let them prove it by two or three witnesses after.s. Paul's rule / and j for my
part shall not only make open confession / but also shall make open
satisfaction as the order was in the church of ancient time. If they have none
of al these things to charge us with all (if they had we should have herd tell of
it or now) thanks to god for his mercy to ward us / for this was only his work
in us / and god grant these unshame fast hypocrites true repentance / and
amendment of their lyves / for a nu^bre of them be notorious tabernhaunters /
common brawlers / very dronkerds / known sodomites / and manifestly proved
whormongers. And if they will say this is spoken of malice / j protest before
god that is not truly said / for j do not name them / because j love the me^n
although j hate their co^ditiones. As to wching fasting / prayer / and
preaching liberty / when did ever any preacher speak against true prayer /
Christian fasti^g / or set men at liberty to sin / but allwaies inveihed
against abuses in popish prayer and fasti^g / as Christ rebuked the prayers
and fastings of the pharisaicall hypocrites / which in deed was all one with
these men's prayers and fasti^gs. And the liberty we preached was not to geve
ye flesh occasion to sin / but to confort by the death of Christ the
conscience overcharged and looden with sin and soche bordens of pharisaicall
traditions / as they were not hable to bear. But this j know well they will
charge me with all, and many others / that herin j showed my self a carnal
preacher / for that j did not lyve a fool life without marriage as they do. If
they lyve chaste without marriage / let them geve god thanks therefore / j do not
envye them that gift of god. But surely god gave not me that gift / that j
could lyve a virginal chaste life / but after the manner of hypocrites / and
therefore did enter in to ye holy state of matrimonye / which is honorable
among all me^ / to the end j might serve god in pure chastity of matrimony.
Heb. xiij
And where as they say that although it be the gift of god / yet may we attain
it if we will fast and pray for god has made us a promise yt he will here
our prayers / and grant our petitiones. I grant he will so do if we ask
after his will / and if that the thing we crave appear to him yt it be
profitable for us / for he knows before we ask what thing we have need of.
And j doubt whether all the prestes that say / they have chastity / by this
that they pray and fast / as they say / optaine and have it or no? We read in
the scripture of many godly men / that earnestly and faithfully begged of god
that thing which they opteined not / and yet god herd them and loved them / but
he knew that to grant their petition was not so profitable for them. ij. Cor.
xij.
As.s. Paul testifies of him self / how he was vexed with the prick of the
flesh / the devels messinger / he did desire the lord thrice to be delivered
there from / but he opteined not / but had the assistaunce of gods grace
promised / where withal he was bid den to be content. I will not now enter in to
the disputation of this matter / j may be so occasioned that j shall speak of it
another time. But j will heri^ purge myself of this crime where of j and my
felowpreachers ar accused as carnal / because we are married / and j will purge
my self after the order of the canon law / as j saw it put in practice once in
Cambrige for the purgatio^ of an holy and learned virgin / if all unmarried
prestes be virgins. The order was that being accused of whordom / four or five
as honest as him self / and of no lower degree in the university / must after
he him self have taken an oath that he is no whormonger / swear yt they think
his oath to be true. Which done / ye matter stan death clear / and he may justly
take an action of sclander against them that accused him.

Now do j affirm before my judge Jesus Christ and his wholl church / that j
have not sinned / bycaus j tok a wif / and therefore am falsely accused as a
carnal or fleshly man for so doing: and for my purgation herin and to prove
my saing to be true in deed / and also to approve my doi^g herin / j take
witness to the law of god / the law of nature / and the civil laws till three
hundred years after Christ's ascension / the example of Christ's apostles / s.
Paul's cou^sall to the Corinthians and in many other places / the council of
Nice / and all the fathers of the church to the second Carthage counsel /
which was fowr hundred and twenty years after Christ's asce^sion. If these
suffice not or else may be excepted against / when j here it j shall answer it.
If these be allowable and sufficient then am j falsely accused / for all these
testify plai^ly that it is lawful and godly and in no wise forbidden but that
a priest may mary. Wherefore j end with this saing of.s. Augustine / quest.nou.
and veter. test. quest. c. xxvij. Talis est enim quoru^da^ versutia, quia vt
sanctitatis and castimoniae, amatores se simulent, nuptias esse dicunt
damnandas, vt per hoc commende^tur, and populum a veritate auertant. Soche is /
says.s. Austine / ye subtlety of some me^ / because they would feign them
selves lovers of holiness and chastity / they say marriages ar to be damned /
that by this means they might be commended / and turn the people from the
truth. Mark that.s. August. notes these men of hypocrisy / subtlety / of
seki^g worldly praise / and deceiving the people. Consider also that the
marriages of prestes were not forbidden in his time / but then this painted
holiness began as you may perceive by his words / and was confirmed by the
second Carthage counsel shortly after his death. When these subtle hypocrites
who condemn holy matrimony as carnalitie / and feine them selves chaste lyvers
to be esteemed in the world / and that they may the rather deceive ye simple
people / have ro^ne to they be wearye in this raze / then heap they this on
also to aggravate ye matter / and make us mor odious unto the people / that all
our preaching was but flatterye / to please the magistrates and the nobility /
that we might thereby avau^ce our selves and clyme to promotion: but here must
you note by the way: or else their tale is not worth a fart / saving your
revere^ce / yt look what crimes soever they lai to us they the^ selves be clear
and free from the^ / and they be replenished with ye contrary virtues. We are
carnal / they ar spiritual / we ca^ not lyve without wives / they live chaste
vergi^s our ladies husbands / we do no good works / all ye world may wo^dre
of yeir good works / we preached to please me^ / yei spar no man / we sought to
live jdlely and delicatly / yey study / they preach to their flok daily / we
sought for promotion / and would heap up livi^g upon livi^g / yei will none if
you will geve it the^ / or at ye most they will have but one at once: if they
thought yt you would not thus esteem and judge of them / they would no more
impute unto us these faults / for they should but loose their labor / and miss
of ye thing they hu^ted after. I dare say their own co^scie^ces does accuse
the^ of belie^g us when they say we flattred the magistrates. The rulers the^
selves took us so mothe contrary to flatterars and me^ pleasers / yt they did
much blame us of to bold and plain rebuki^g their sins / i^ so much they
would not at the last here no moo sermones / which was a manifest toke^ yt gods
plage was at hand / as i^dede it shortly followed / upon the^ and the wholl
realm. And for the lordly loyteri^g prelates with all their kennel of du^me dogs
/ j trust they will bear us witness we flattred the^ no deal. Who the^ did we
go about to please / ye poor sort? There was no promotio^ nor profet to be wo^.
God knows and let ye world judge / whether we sought more to please me^ and
to procureto our selves promotio^ / honor / estimation / ease / and profe^^or
yei yt now wipe their hands so clean. But let them wipe their hands so clean
as they ca^n / let them handle the matter never so coni^gly in charging other
with their own faults / yet will they be wraye them selves when they goo most
about to cover and hide their faults. But her in do we rejoice that our case
is at this present with these as.s. Paul's was with the Galathians and the
Thessalonians. for after he had instructed them perfectly and truly in the
doctrine of salvation / there entered in among them falss teachers which did not
only poiso^ the good doctrine of the gospel which they had received / with
observationes of Moses law / and superstitious ceremonies / but also the rather
to bring their wicked purpose to pass / did sclandre.s. Paul of flattery and
covetousnes: and therefore he writes to both the congregations and purges him
self of that falss accusation. Gal. j.
saing to the Galathians now whether goo j about to please men or no? j. These.
ij.
and to the Thessalonians we speak unto you not as men pleasars / but to please
god who tries our hearts. Nether have j lived among you at any time with
flattering words / as you know another by occasion of covetousnes / god is
witnese, nether seki^ge praise of me^ / another of you nor of others. We had
instructed ye people and taught ye pure doctrine of gods word / we had laid no
other foundation but Jesus Christ / and in comes a sort of falss teachers /
and does not only tread down the doctrine of Christ / and fill alful of
superstition / jdolatrie and falss religion / but to bring this the rather to
pass / do accuse us of those crimes they them selves ar only guilty in. this
has been the practice of all heretics and false teachers / sense the
beginning as does well appear to them that are exersised in the histories of ye
church / whom these hypocrites do follow so near / and have learned their
co^ning so perfectly / that thou may easily perceave ye greek proverb truly
verefied in them / (...) / (...). But what mervaill is it / though yei now
raill and rage against the ministers of gods word / call them heretics /
seditious / and new fangled fellows / when their auncetours ye pharisees did the
same against Christ and his apostles: wherein these antichrists birds would not
be one foot behind them if they durst for the people / who would not suffer
Christ to be evel spoken of by name. But that they dare not attempt against
Christ by name / they will do against his holy word under the name of new
learning / and new preachi^g against ye faith of our mother holy church. Do
they name it new learning because they have not be wonted unto it / but now of
late years? So may Christ be called unto the^ a new Christ / because they were
never acquaited with hime. Now many of yem have this acquai^tau^ce with Christ / yt
they know and co^fess him to be the only satisfaction for our si^nes / ye only
read mer / ye only mediator / our only ryghteousnes ye he offered upon ye cross
ous for all / did make by yt one oblation / not to be iterated / a full and
perfect sacrifice for all ye sins of ye wholl world. They will say ye they
have been so trained up in ye knowledge of Christ yt they know and co^fess all
this to be true. And thus far were well content to follow ye late kings
procedings. Yea they followed it as a currish dog does follow when he is drawn
against his will: then he draws bak with all his force to pull his neck out of
ye collar / and if yt will not be / he gooth on snatching and gnawing the ba^de
and cease not till he have gnawe^ it in sondre. Or do they name it new
because their holy father the pope / they and his wholl clargie / does so judge
it and can in no wise brook it. In this sense Christ him self called it new
learning when he answered Ioans disciples their question of theirs and the
pharisees fast. For when they misliked his doctrine because it was utterly
against them and they could in no wise away wtal Christ shows this reason of
yeir offense / old rotten vessels ca^ hold no new wine. This new wine of the
gospel ca^ not abide in a popish heart / replenished with superstition / jdolatrie
/ and falss religion but it must needs bespued out again or else ye vessels
will utterly burst in sundre. But they call it new learning and therefore the
teachers thereof heretics / because it is but a new kind of heresies found out
of late years by the germans and had been always / and is condemned by the
holy church. God has blessed the germans / his name be praised for it /
wondrefully with the sincere knowledge of his truth / and they do co^tinew there
in / and daily encreace / although our e^glish hypocrites brute abroad the
contrary. But yet they were not the first inve^tours thereof / for they her in
have taught nothing else but ye they received of Christ / and was the learning
of the church till antichrist of Rome waxed so strong that he banished Christ
and his gospel. And this doctrine which they call heresy is not at any time
condemned by the church of Christ / but by the church of antichrist / as shall
plainlye be proded when they have decreed against any particular perte there of.
But this must not be for gotten yt you vndresta^d when they speak of the
church / although they name it Christ's church / yt has always condemned this
doctrine / they mean in very deed a congregation of hushopes / monks and
friars / sworn soldiers to antichrist the pope. And think you this church
will decree any thing against it self?. And where they will defend them selves

did. viii. can. qui co^temp. Qui co^te^pta veritate praesumit consuetudinem
sequi, aut circa fratres inuidus est et malignus, qui bus veritas reuelatur,
aut in deum ingratus est, cuius inspiratione ecclesia eius i^struitur Nam
dominus in eua^gelio, ego sum, inquit veritas, non dixit ego sum co^suetudo.
Itaque veritate manifestata, cedat co^suetudo verita ti. Reuelatione igitur
facta veritatis, veritati cedat co^suetudo, quia et Petrus qui circu^cidebat,
cessit Paulo veritatem praedica^ti. Igitur cu^ Christus veritas sit, magis
veritatem qua^ co^suetudinem sequi debemus. He yecon temni^g ye truth does
presume to follow custom is other envious and malignaunt to his brethren to whom
ye truth is revealed / or else he is vnth ankfull to god by whose inspiration
his church is istructed / for ye lord in ye gospel says / jam ye truth / and
he said not / ja^ ye custo^. Therefore when ye truth appears / let custom geve
place to the truth / for Peter him self who did circu^cise / did geve place to
Paul preachi^g ye truth. Therefore seeing Christ is the truth / we ought rather
to follow ye truth then ye custom. Herin is to be marked this / yt the holy
father does geve example of.s. Peter who forsook custom to follow truth. Our
prelates say they be Peter's successors / why will they not the^ follow Peter
herin. They be his folowers in title and name but nothing in deed. Savi^g yt
they deny Christ and pluk out their swerds to persequut them yt serve and
beleve in Christ / as Peter did smite Malchus one of the^ yt came to apprehend
Christ. And yet they differ from Peter / yt where he of blind zeall drew out
his swerd to defend Christ / they of malicious purpose bend all their power with
fire and swerd to destroy Christ. And is it any merveill though we ru^ne away
from yt cruel claws of these wild beasts / in whose hands there is no mercy?
We fled not because we did suspect our doctri^e / but because we knew well
their cruelty. We went not away because we could not abide by our doctrine and
prove it true / but for yt truth could not be herd with indifferent judgment. j
pray you mark this practice / and look if the like were ever found in any
history? They cast the chiefest learned me^ in prisone / or commands them
to keep their houses and not to co^m a broad / or banisheth them the realm as
Peter martyr. I. alasco with others / and when they be sure of the^ / yt they
shall not meadle / for they were not hable to abide their lerni^g / then to
blind the eyes of ye people / they pretend a disputation / and call the matter
in to question / when there is no ma^n to answer the^ as they think and also
when they be already determined / let the truth apear never so plain to the
contrary / what they will decree. Then cries a stout cha^pio^ at paulls
cross boldly / wherbe our new preachers now? Why do they not now come forth
and dispute. Think you this lusty roysterki^ does not know full well yt they
be fast j nough / they may not co^m to answer hi^? Yet by those whom god has
delivered out of their hands / although they be nothing to be compared in
learni^g to them they have lokked fast vpe / it shall plainly apeare to all
indifferent men yt their doctrine is true / and may easily be mai^tained by the
scripture and testimony of the ancient fathers of christ's church. And yt the
contrary ca^ not be defended / another by gods word / the ancient church /
norby no honest way / and therefore they ar driven with shame j nough to bolster
and keep it up / with fire and swerd / with thus will we / and thus shall it be.
And by cause they would seem in the face of the world to do it by learni^ng and
the consent of most part of learned men of the realm / they gather a sort of
bli^de prestes to gether in to the co^vocation house whose lyvi^ges ha^geth / as
they call it of maki^g Christ's body / and of prete^sed chastity / being for
ye most perte / unlearned asses / and filthy whormongers / and these with a
showte of yea yeayea / or nay nay nay / must determine these matters: Act. xiij.
as if the masters of ye pythonise / which had a spirit of pytho and there by
brought to them great profet and Demetrius the gold smith with the wholl
congregation of the artificers / who had rich livi^gs by jdolatrie / should had
been appoi^ted clerks in the convocation house at philippos or at Ephesus and
with their yea yea or nay nay have determined this question / whether Paull and
Silas had been seditiouse heretics: would not / trow you / the more part have
cried with alowd voice yea yea yea? oh / aurisacra fames quid no^ mortalia
pectora cogis? Whether this stand with reason that those prestes whose living
depends only of superstition / jdolatrie and falls religion / and ar for the
most part blind ignorant asses / should be only judges in the waightye matters
of our religion / j report me to the indifferent man. Another practice /
which in very deed was / that moved me most to save my self from them by
flieng out of the realm / they have / not latly invented / but derived from
their forfathers ye jewish pharisees / and yet not put in ure of many years. And
that is / yt they will not leave a lyve one learned man in the realm which is
not of their own sect / no nor yet or they have done one noble mane that now
lives / although they will not pretend religion to be the cause / but invent
some other weighty matter. I must needs here geve the noble men warni^g of that
j herd / by cause j love them / and am sorye to here / strangers speak this
dishonor of the^ yt they are not hable to rule them selves and there for must
desire a pollshorne bushope to govern them and the wholl realm. At my last
being at London waitinge at ye parlame^t house of my lords of the counsall as
j was commanded / j met with a familiar acquaintance of mine / although not of
my opinion in religion / but one that for the matters of religion does favor
the popish bushopes / and is both familiar with the best of them / and also
taken to be a wise man and of a great forsyght as he is in deed. He asked me of
my state / saing thus unto me / did not j tell you yt your religion would not
co^tinew? And so would have persuaded me to have geven place / and revoked mine
opinion: where in when he saw he prevailed not / he said friendly / he was sorry
for me / and wished that he were of power to do me pleasure: to whom j said /
it was sufficient to me yt he would co^tinew his familiar friendship with me: and
there upon j charged him as j was often wont of friendship to tell me what he
thought of our bushoplike procedi^gs. Whereto he answered / as in matters of
religion very well. But in other matters nothing so. For / says he / j have
entered talk with some that be most nygh of their counsall / and j perceav this
by all their proceadings and purposes / yt they ar fullye bent to set up the
power of the clargie as high as ever they were above the laytye / and j have
good reasones that moves me also to think this to be true. Whereunto j said /
that can never be brought to pass. For although the noble men do favor their
religion / yet will they never suffer them to clyme so high again. Tush / says
he / they shall first of al help them to bring to pass at this parliament /
that they would / and then they will have their hedes off one after an other.
What / said j they will never so do for the nobilitye favors them. Yea
says he / and they favor some of them again. But they love none of them all so
well but they love them selves better. They see yt the wholl youth of the
realm and especially of the noble and the worshipful at infected with this
heresy and new learning / and they shall herafter undo again all yt they now
do / and then the latter end shall be worse then the beginni^g / and therefore
will they chopp of the heads of the fathers and thereby both their children ar
disenhereted / and shall be hable to do no harm / and also they may in their
place make noble men of their own kindred and fre^des. What / said j it were to
much cruelty / whereunto says he / yea yea they think it is better an
inco^venie^ce than a mischieff. God deliver the noble blood of england out of
the danger of these disse^bling wolves. But let the noble men consider how many
of their own friends and most dear derlings / with whom they were joined
inco^federacye for the bushop of Rome / wretched winchester and develish
dre^mi^g Duresme have brought to confusion / and they shall have sufficient
warni^g how they may trust these bloudye butchers. If doctor ridley were a lyve
the bushop of Duresmes chaplein and one hand / he would vouche it to his face /
as he ded ye last time yt ever he spak to him / yt he cares not whose blood he
shed to bring his purpose about And what would this insatiable bloudsoki^g
hypocrite have cared to have wrought my destruction / whom he took to be an
enemy to his develish devises. He invented al ye ways he could to bring me to
revoke the truth: he caused two noble men to charge me with preachi^g / as he
termed it heresy / he him self accused me that j had infected his wholl dioces
with new lern^ig / but when that would not serve / by cause j had done nothing /
but yt was confirmed by the laws of ye realm / he was not ashamed to lay to
my charge that j was not an english ma^n borne: that j had exercised his
office in his bushoprich / that j had brought i^ a wife of mi^e own i^ to yt
church where never woman came be for. And then the.l. chau^celour charge me with
contempt of ye queen's highness as though j should have received three letters of
co^mau^dme^t to repair and make mine appearau^ce before the counsall and would
appear for none of them. If both these butchers had been so well known to king
Henry the eight for rank traitors to the crown of england / as they were
i^dede / which now they show plainly as j am well known to be a mear natural
e^glish man / they should never have brought that noble realm now in danger to
be over run and conquered with strangers: the which thing men yt be half
blind may plainly see yei goo about. I never meddled with his office / j was in
danger of much displeasure as the honorable cou^sall did well know / by cause
j would not take upon me his office. And her in he utters his malicious
hypocrisy / and what an unshamefast bawd he has been / is / and will be to ye
monks of Duresme when he says there came never woman with i^ that house be fore
my wife came there. For he knows right well yt the church of Duresme was
replenished with married prestes be for bush. William by the help of lanfrank
archbushope of Cantourburye did optaine license from pope Hildebra^de to
banishe the married prestes and to bring mo^ks from warmouth and jarrow. And
also it is not unknown to hime nor to his chancellor nor to never one of his
officers / yt every monk of them all for the most part has a concubine in
the town / who has come and does come to their church and chamber / and no
fault found / but yt honest men of the town and also of ye country ar
offended therwt / but dare say nothing for fear of the great bawd there
patron. Yea ye bushope and his mo^ks knew full well yt j did know to much of
their juggling and there for it was time to rid me out of the way.

But when Winchestre came in also with his fallss accusation / (for j never
received one letter nor token of co^maundment / from here highness nor from her
honorable counsall / but a letter the post delivered me by the way as j was
coming to London) and laid it earnestly to my charge as though j had been a
stubbern rebel / j perceived they would serve me as they had done others /
mean to punish me for religion and pretend treason: and subornate two or three
falss witnesses as they have pleintie in store to affirm that j had made some
offense to the queen's highness / as their great gra^dsiers plaide with Christ /
saing that he did forbid the people to pay tribute unto Caesar. Where for j
thought it best to deliver my self out of their hands by forsaking my native
country / seeing there was another equity nor justice to be looked for although my
doctrine was never so pure / my behavoir never so upright / and j never so
hable to answer with truth to yt was objected. And therefore my friends and
kinsfolk have no cause to be sorry for me. For although j have lost a great
livi^g / al my goods / have not on farthi^g left me / am bannissed my native
country / shall use no more the familiar company of my friends / what have j
lost? Nothing / but shall be a great gainner: for if to save these things ama^
loose his soul / what has he won? And if the departure from these / have
ever lasting life to reward what damage is there? our savior Christ whose
promise is much more sure and preciouse then ye uncertain and flatteri^g
glory of the world / has made faithful promise / yt who so ever forsakes /
house / brethrene / systers / father mother / wife / children / or lyvelod for
his name sak / the same shall receave an hundred fould / and shall enheret ever
lasti^g lyff. Mat. xix. Mat. vj

In him only rests the whole riches of gods treasure / he is the only way to
everlasti^g lyff / where unto who so will attain must seek it in ye scripture /
in ye gospel of Christ / and not in the filthye damnable traditiones / and
develish doctrine of the papists. Wherefore dear brethren seeing you have tasted
of ye sweet bread of lyff / gods most holy word / take heed of the papists so
were leven that works death. And because j would you should not be ignorant /
how you ought to be have your selves where so much jdolatrie is openly
commanded / and how to learn your Christ's cross a new / j mean to bear
Christ's cross laid on your baks / to follow him strongly and not to fainte / j
have translated for you two sermones of yt great learned and godly man. I.
calvi^ made for yt purpose / and these have j done travailing / havi^g no place
certain where j will remai but j trust shortly to be where j will stikke down
the stake till god call me home again. But for so mocheas ye bushop of Duresme
did openly to my face call ye doctrine which j had taught in his dioces as
towchi^g the popish mass / heresy / jshall by gods grace / good christian
bretthre^ / declare and prove by ye testimony of the scriptures and also of ye
ancient fathers of christ's church / yt ye popish mass is the greatest heresy
/ blasphemy / and idolatry / yt ever was i^ ye church / which shall be the next
thing yt you shall look for from me by gods grace. In ye mean season /
remember good brethren / yt our vntha^k fulness was the cause of this our plage.
Let us cry therefore unto the lord / powri^g forth before him faithful tears
/ and he will delivere us that we may truly honor him i^ the gates of the
daughter of Syon / yt is openly i^ ye mides of ye faithful congregation. Ame^.

A sermon / where in all Christianes ar admonished to fly the outward Idolatry
/ taken out of ye iij. verse of the xvj. Psalm: I will not coi^cate with their
bloudye sacrifices / nether will j take their names in my mouth.
The doctrine which we shall entreat in this place / is plain enough and easy
/ saving that the greatest part of those that profess them selves to be
Christians / do seek out and bring / j can not tell what subtleties to cloak
their evel withal. But the sum of this wholl doctrine is / that after we
know the livi^g god to be our father / and Jesus Christ our redemere / we
ought to consecrate both body and soull unto him / who of his infinite
goodness has taken us in to the nu^bre of his sons: and to acknowledge withal
kind of benevole^ce / honor / and obedience / ye same benefit which our
most dear Savioure did vouch salf to bestow on us after he had bought it with
so great a price. And because we are bound not only to renounce all infidelity
/ but also to separate our selves from all superstitions / which do as well
disagree with ye true service of god as the honor of his son / and which can
by no means agree with the pure doctrine of the gospel and true confession of
the faith / j said this doctrine of it selve to be so easy / that o^lie the
practice and exercise there of ought to remain unto us / saving that many men
do seek certain deceitful shyftes / through which they will not be overcome
in that thing / the which is most chiefly condemned by gods own mouth. This
cause constrains us at this time to tarry longer in the declaratione of this
matter / that every man may know his own duty / and deceav not him self /
thinkinge that he is escaped when he is covered / as the common saing is /
under a wett sack. But for that there be many of this opinion / whose churches ar
thoroughly pourged from the filthiness / and jdolatries of the papisme / that this
argument or treatice is but supfluouse / before we pass any further / it is not
unprofitable to declare soche men most fowly to be deceived. First when it is
declared / how great an offense it is / for us to be polluted and defiled with
the jdolatours / feining our selves to cleave and consent to their impieties /
wear admonished to mourn for our former sins / and to ask of god forgevness
of them / withal humblenes / and in this thing to acknowledge the singular
benefit which he gave unto us / drawing us forth of that same filthe wherein
we were holden down and drowned. For we truly are not hable to set forth this
so great a benefit worthily jnough. And for that we know not what shall happen
unto us / and to what end god does reserv us / it is very expedient to be
prepared and armed in time / that in to what state so ever we shall comme / or
with what so ever temptations we may be oppugned / we never swerve from the
pure word of god. First it may be that many of this our church and congregation
/ shall travaill in to some papisticall co^trie / who ought greatly now to be in
a readiness and armed to battle. Then albeit god does geve us at this time
liberty / to serve him purely and godlily / yet we know not how long this
benefit shall co^tinew. Let us therefore take this time of our quietness and
tranquillity / not as though it shall always last / but as it were a time of
truce / wherein god does geve us leisure / to stre^ghthe^ our selves / least
when we shall be called to utter the confession of our faith / we be found new
and unprepared / because we co^te^ned the meditation of that matter in due time.
Nether truly ought we to forget in the mean while our bethren / which are kept
under the tyranny of antichriste / oppressed with most miserable bondage / but
to take care / remembrance / pity over them / and to pray god to strenghthe^
them with that co^stancye / which he requires in his word. We must also
admonish and solicit the^ by all ways / not to rest in places where me^ ar
fast on sleep in their voluptuousnes / but to apply diligently this thought /
and will / that they confess the glory due unto god. For we are not taught of
god only for our selves / but that every man after the measure of his faith /
should brotherli communicate with his neghbours / and distribute unto the^ that
thing he has learned and known in gods scholl. Now see we the^ that it is
profitable / yea truly necessary so well to our selves / as to our brethren /
that the remembrance of this doctrine should be renewed very often / especially
seeing the text it self which we shall expound / does led us to the same
purpose. David does openly protest / and as it were does make a sole^ vow /
that he will never be partaker in the sacrifices of jdolatours / and also ye he
will so detest / and grevously hate the jdoles that he will not at any time
once name the^ / as though he should defile his mouth in nami^g the^. This is
not the fact of some one mean man / but the example of David the most excellent
king and prophet / which ought to be unto all gods children / a certain common
rule to right and godly lyff. And to thentent we may the better perceav this
thing and more vehemently be moved with the true fear of god / the cause is to
be noted which he adds / wherein truly rests as it were a certain foundation
of that same alienatio^ and offense / where by he does most greatly abhor the
communion of jdolatours. The lord / says he / is mine enheritaunce. But is
not this thing common to all faithful and godly me^? There is no man truly which
would not glory in so excellent a thing. And this is sure without all doubt /
that god being once geven unto us in the perfone of his son / does daily
entise us to possess hime. But there be very few which are so affected in this
part / as the greatness and worthiness of this same matter should seem to ask and
deserve. Nether truly ca^ we by any means possess god / onles on this
condition that we also be come his. David therefore of good right / and worthily
did set the foundation of his godlynes / and religion in this sentence / and
reason / seeing that god is his cnheritau^ce / he will refrai^ from all
pollutions of jdoles / which do turn us from God him selff. This is the cause
why the prophet Esaias / when he had vpbraided the jews that they had geve^
themselves to falls and strange gods / whom they had made / added afterward /
these / says he / ar thy portion / signifieng by these words / that god does
deny to the worshippers of jdoles all bond and fellowship of covenant / and
disenheriteth the^ / and utterly depriveth them / of that so i^finitly great
benefit / which he would have bestowed on them / gevi^g him selff unto them.
Some man will except and say / that the prophet entreats in that place only of
the^ which put their affiance in jdoles / and deceaveth them selves through
opinion and incredulity. I grant / but this alfo j answer / if they that do
transfere gods honor unto jdoles / ar utterly separated and cut of from his
folowship / they also do err and decline fom what from him / which do fei^
them selves to consent to superstitions through fear and weakness of mind. For
no man can in heart or any conformable fashion or in will / and in purpose of
mind / or feining / or by any true or feined way approach to jdoles / but he
must so far go bak from god. Wherefore let this sentence be thoroughly persuaded /
and remain depely printed in our hearts / that they which seek god with a true
and pure mind / to the end to possess him for their enheritau^ce / will have
no communion and fellowship with jdoles / withwhome god has that divorce and
debate / that he would have all his to proclaim and make continual and deadly
war upon them. And in this place David by name does express / that he will
never be partakre of their oblations / nether have their names in his mouth and
talking. He might have said on this wise / I will not deceave my self with ye
u^wise and folish devotio^s of ye vnbelevers j will not put my trust in soche
abuses / nor j will neverforsake gods truth / to follow yes lies / but he
speaks not on this manner / but does ra yer promise co^sta^tly / yt he will
never be conversau^t among yer ceremoi^es. Therefore he does testify yt so far
forth as concerns ye service of god / he will abide continually in all purity
and holiness both of body and soul. And first in this place we must considre /
whether this be not jdolatrie to signify and declare by owtward tokens / our
agreament / with those superstitions / where with the service of god is corrupted
and utterly perverted. They yt swi^ (asye common sai^g is) betwixt two waters
/ allege this sai^g / sei^g yt god would be honored i^ spirit / jdoles ca^ by
no ways be honored o^les ama^ put his trust in the^. But to this may be
easily answered / yt god does not so require ye service / and adoration of the
mind / yt he grants and remitteth ye other perte of our nature unto jdoles
/ as though yt perte should seem nothing at alto belong unto him. For it is said
in many places / yt the knees must be bowed before god / and also ye hands
lyfted up to heven. What then? Surely the chief honor that god requires is
spiritual / but ye owtward signification whereby ye faithful do testify yt it
is god only whom they serve and honor / must so immediately follow / yt they
must at one time be joined to gether. But one place shall so suffice for all /
to confute that objection which they snatch of one word / that they shall be
plainly rebuked and co^victe. In the third chapt. of Daniel it is written yt
Sidrach Misach and abdenago / refused and denied under any manner of color / to
consent unto the superstition set up and erected by Nabuchodonosor / declaring
that they would in no wise honor his gods. If these goodly wittye sophisters
had been there at that time / they would have laughed to scorn the simplicity of
these three servaunts of god. For j suppose they would have tawnted them with
sochelike words / you folish me^ / this truly is not to honor them / seeing
you put no affiaunce in these things. There is no jdolatrie but where there is
devotion / that is to say / a certain be^ding and application of the mind to
honor and worshipe the jdoles. But these godly men did follow a better and wisar
counsall / for this answer which they made proceeded not of their own wit / but
rather of ye holy ghost / which moved them thus to speak / whom if we will
not resist / we must accept this place and this example / as a certain rule and
definition / that jdolatrie is an outward action against gods honor / yea
although it proceed not from the will and purpose of the mind / but be only
colorable and feined. In which matter they make goodli cavillationes yt there
is no jdolatrie at all when as our affiaunce is not put in jdoles. Yet shall
these men coutinually remain condemned by ye sentence which thee mightiest
judge has pronounced. But these men do contend only for ye name / only going
about somdeall to lesson their fault / which they can by no means defend nor
excuse. Yea they will grant that this thing is evell done and not rightly /
yet not with standi^g they would have this fact to be judged as a certain
venial sin. But although we grant them as towching the name that thing they
ask / yet they shall not get so much there by that they may make their cause
much the better. Let us say thus / that soche manner of feined worshipping of
jdoles / is not called jdolatrie / yet nevertheless it shall be a traitourous
entrepece against god / a certain fact repugnaunt to the confession of faith /
and a fowl filthy pollution most full of wicked sacrilege. I pray you when the
most sacred service and honor of god is so violated / that we falsely break yt
promise we mad to him / that through cowardice and fai^tnes of stomak we deny
crokedly and falsely our Christian profession / that we be come inconstaunt and
dowble / that we defile our selves fowly with those things / which god has
cursed with all kind of malediction: is this so light a matter that after we
have done it / we ought only to wipe our mouth / and confess that we have
committed a certain small fault? Let us therefore put away these shifts /
specially seeing they serve for no another thing but to make us bouldre / and to
geve us greater liberty to sin / and does nothing at al diminish our fault?
There be also other more impudent / which do not only / chau^ging the name /
goo about to persuade yt it is not so great and unworthy a sin: but do
plai^ly and precisely deny it to be sin. It is sufficient / say they / that
god be honored with heart and mind. Eve^ so truly if the heart it selff were not
dowble. For when the mind is truly sound and pure the body shall never be
drawn in to a contrary part. I would know of them what ye is that moves and
leads their feet to the temple. For when they goo to here mass / their legs
will never be stirred of their own morio^ / but must needs be moved by ye
i^ward power of the mi^de. The^ must they needs confess yt there is in them
selves a certain desire and motion of mi^de where of they be carried to worship
the jdoles / and chefely because they covet to apply the^ selves after their
will and opinion / which ar enemies to the truth / yea and do so conform them
selves to please them / that they do much more esteem their favor and their
own life then gods honor and glory. Besides this / their impudency is so
manifest and shamfull / that j am ashamed to dispute against it / as though it
had some color or lyknesse of reason / yet j must needs do it / seeing they do
please the^ selves so greatly / and arr / as it were men dronken in their own
opiniones and pleasures / fallen fast on stepe. They think this is jnough to
worship god in sprit / whose then shall the body be? Truli. s. Paull moves us
to honor god / both in body and spirit / for they be his own and belongs to
none other. God has created the body / and shall it be leafull for us /
therewith to serve and honor the devell as though he should seem te be the
author and maker thereof? It were better they would profess them selves openly to
be maniches and deny that god made the wholl man. If they had never so little
taste of the gospel they would not burst out in to so lice^tious impude^cye.
But now it is plain j nough / that they in no wise know / what is the power
and greatness of this benefit / to be redeemed with ye blood of gods so^n. And to
prove this true / how can we look for ye resurrectione of the flesh except we
beleve that Christ Jesus is the redemer both of bodies and souls? j. Corin.
vij.
.S. Paul also does admonish us / not to be ye servants of men / because we were
bought and purchesed with so great apece / which is ye blood of gods so^n. Then
he yt does join and addict him self to the wicked service of jdoles / does he
not tread u^dre his fete the most sacred blood of Jesus Christ / wherein does
consist the price of the eternal and i^mortall glory / which we look for in
our bodies? What reason is it ye our bodies should be defiled and profaned before
jdoles / sei^ge ye crown of eternal life is promised unto the^ in heve^. This
wallowi^g in sata^s stews and most filthye defili^g is it a mea^ and way where
by we may come to the ki^gdo^ of god? Morover it was not said with out a great
cause / our bodi^es at the temples of the holy ghost / therefore they wc perceav
not / that they ought to be kept in all holiness / do plainly show them selves
to perceave and vndresta^d nothing at all of the gospel. Also they declare yt
they know no whit at al what is the power of Jesus Christ and of his grace. For
when it is said on this wise that we are bone of his bones and flesh of his
flesh we ought to vndresta^d that we be joined with him both in body and
soull. Therefore no mane can defile his own body with any manner of superstition /
but he does separat him self / from ye conjunction and union / where by we are
made the me^bres of the son of god. But now let these wittye and subtle
doctors answer me / whether they have received baptism only in their souls /
or whether god has commanded rather and instituted yt this sign should be
impri^ted in our flesh. Shall the body then wherein ye mark of Jesus Christ is
printed / be polluted and defiled with so contrary / repugnaunt / and so wicked
abominations? Also the lords supper / is it received in the mind only / and
not also in the hands and mouth? Has god engraven in our bodies the arms and
badges of his son / that we afterward should pollute our selves with all
uncleanness / with most foul spotes and shame / and so vnsemly deform our selves /
yt no ki^de nor likeness of christian beauty should appear? It is not leaful in
coyni^g one piece of gold to pri^te two contrary coins / nether to set two
sealls the one repu^gnau^t to ye other / unto one writi^g: and shall a mortal
man take upon hime to countrefete and corrupt baptism / and the most holy
supper of Jesus Christ / and also be bold to say yt there is no evel in so great
and mischevous a fact? Soche men truly ar worthy / that their servau^tes should
persuade and make them beleve / they have a great pleasur to do them service
when not wtstandi^g / they geve them selves to sleep / pleasurs and al jdlenes
/ and do not move one finge to do any work at all. If they say it is not alike
reason / by cause we have need of their labor that be under us: j answer
although god have nonede of us / yet for that he will use our labor / service /
and obedience / to serve and honor him / truly it is to much unseemly / and
for us the greatest shame and infamye / to do all thing other wise then he will
/ and clean to be void of the study and duty which we owe unto him / yea
our shame is so much the greater / that the worm of the earth, and an vnliving
creature shall requiere more power over us / and honor then his creator. But
yet we must talk with these beasts more plainly. They say it is leafull for
them to feign and cloak what so ever they will among the papists / and to
conform them selves to that manner and fashion of religion / which is thought
most apt to norish superstition. Who is he then that geveth them bread to be
fed with all there? Who does make the grownd fertile to bring forth fruit? If
god do feed and norishe them i^ those places where they dwell as he does all
other men in the other parts of the earth / why do they not honor the gever
of that benefit with that part of themself / which is so bountefully
norished of him? Why do they rather obei and serve the devel with their bodies?
If these men were in any part christians / j would use with the^ more weighty
and higher reasons: and j would ask of them / to what end we lyve in this world
/ and where unto our life ought to be referred. But o miserable case that they
which with subtleties and shifts will dally with god / ar so brutishe / that
they must be handled / as men not only destitute of gods spirit / but in a
manner void of natural common sense. They think this is a sufficient excuse /
to say / they do nothing in this kind / but for fear of peril and daungere
/ but if this color may take place / then must we say that Joseph should have
done none evel / if he had committed whordom with his maistres when it was
violently offered him / seeing he should not have followed his own will / but have
geven place to necessity and violence which she did unto him. It should have
been a foolish fact of him / to enter soche peril and infamy / as after ward
he suffered by the false accusation of ye naughty woman / seeing he might have
escaped those evels if he had accomplished her will. But we ought rather to
follow ye example of Joseph / and allow the testimony of the holy ghost / who
does commend his constancye. If there be no wickedness in taking upon us
jdolatrouse religion when we do it to avoid the raging cruelty of the papists
/ the servaunt shall not sin / who for his masters pleasure / shall play the
bawd / kill / and play the traitor / for fear to displease him / under whose
power he is. But j abide to long in this matter / where in (as j said before)
there is no doubt or difficulty. It shall not befarr from the purpose to
consider in to how great confusjon they fall / which travail with all their
crafts to escape gods judgment. Others there be yt have found an other shyft
and sterti^g holle / they grant / yt the superstition of the ge^tles is a
wicked and detestable religion / but it is not all on reason of these and ye
superstitions which arr in ye papisme. As though all the false religion yt
ever was among ye heithe^ / was not a corrupti^g and depravatio^ of the true
religion of god. From whence did ye heathen draw and tak to them selves ye yr
ceremonies but of the holy fathers? In which doi^g this was their great fault /
yt they depraved and utterly perverted those things which they had received /
well and wisely i^stituted of god. But yet all the abominatio^es yt ever were in
the world have been cloked with a bewtiful title of god hi^ self and ye culture
of his religion. But those cou^trefet religions / had never yt co^me^dation /
power and authority / yt god did at any time approve those services and
co^gregations / or yt faithful me^ did use and frequent them. Goo to let us
proceed forther. Although j should grant the jdolatrie of the papists to be
unlike and differ from the superstition of the old ge^tles / yet ca^ they not
deny but god so earnestly did forbid the religion wickedly set up i^ be thel
/ as al other superstitions which were i^stituted and celebrated i^other
places. When ye calves were erected i^ Da^ and Bethel this was i^stituted and
done u^dre a certai^e color of his nae^ with had brought his people out of egypt
and iet ye same religion with was yer appoi^ted is manifestly against the
doctrine of ye law. God does co^de^ne al those ye goes thither to defile and
pollute them selves. And truly ye supper of Jesus Christ and the popish mass
arr no less repugnau^t and contrary the on to the other then the sacrifices of
Moses and Jeroboam. From whence then is this vispensation and license to goo
and here mass under this color yt the supper of Jesus Christ is but
transformed yea rather in deed deformed? But j say and affirm co^trariwaise /
that all they that do fear god truly and honor him godlily / ought so much
the more to hate and detest it / for that it does more openly violat and
profane the holy institution of Jesus Christ / then if it were not so
repugnaunt and contrary unto the same. Wherefore let us keep this common rule
generally / yt all the ordinance and inventions of me^ proponed and taken in
hand to corrupt the simple truth of gods word / and to pervert that religion
which he requires and allows / arr very sacrileges with which the
Christian man / may in no wise communicate / without that injury and
contumelye / which treads under feet gods honor most wickedly. I know well
jnough how grevous and intolerable this severe judgment seems to them / which
would after their own lust and delicat mind / be more nicely and mekly spoken
to and taught. Wherein what would they j should do? What moderation and lenity
should j use? Truly now j perceave how tender and deintie they arr / j covet so
much as may be to spare them / but both j and they must be condemned so sone
as god has spoken: therefore if we will tender our own salvation / let us take
it in good part. They say they fi^d no man more severe and sharp then j am /
but j will declare unto them / on the other part / that j handle them more
mekly and tendrely / the^ the truth of the cause / the worthiness of gods name /
and their own salvation did requier. Which thing being so in deed / truly they
can not excuse and deliver them selves from the necessity of that duty and
testimony / that the prophet Jeremy does requier of the Iues captives in
Babylon whom he not only forbids to come near ye abominations of the
Chaldeans / or colourably and feinedly to geve any consent to them / but also
does geve a plain commandment yt they should declare the wicked religion of
the Chaldeans to be unto them a most filthye savor. You shall say to them
(says the prophet Jeremy) the gods which have not made heve^ and earth shall
perish both out from ye the earth / and also from under heve^. There is also in
this place an other circumstau^ce to be marked / that when the prophet had
written his book in Hebrew / yet he put in this sentence expressed in the common
vulgar speech of ye Caldea^s / as though he would by this mea^s / constrain the
jews / to change from their tu^ge / to the end they might more apertly
profess ye hatred and disagreme^t they have with ye wicked jdolatours. Now let
our nice yonglings complain of me as though my advertisme^t excadeth all
measure / and yet j have not at any time desiered ye half part of yt duty
which ye prophet requiereth and asks so earnestly. But what so ever be ye
manner / other of my saing and moderation / or else of mi silence and
taciturnitie / never ye less we are tied and bound to that law which god does
geve unto us / And truly it is not without a cause / yt god speaki^g to his faith
full / says to them / you ar my witnesses and my servaunt who^ j have chosen.
Wherefore who so ever will prove him self to be a membre of Jesus Christ /
ought by all ways to declare / that ye praise and honor of gods name does so
apertain to him / that they which by their faining do hide and bury ye
testimony of his truth / do leave them selves inexcusable. What j pray you
is to be thought of the^ ye do al yeirlyfe time subvert ye same? Of what sort
ar yei yt do not only hide ye profession of ye Christian religion / and shows
no toke^ ye rof before me^ / but also commits many things / and thosmost
contrary and unseemly / This yerfore rests that gods childr^e wc live where
yes impurities and abomi^atio^s remai^ / do mourn after ye example of ye
godly man ^oth / and also speak so freely against so many and so great
abominable vices of me^ / as god shall geve to them power and opportunity. Let
us now com to show certain ki^ds of jdolatries / which are of most estimation
in yt is days. Among which sort / ye mass is chief / whereof j have towcht
somthi^g before. For although it be so famous and notable blasp. both i^
absurdite and greatness of mischef yt nothing ca^ be imagined mor fowl and
wicked / yet still beyer patro^s found for a^ evel cause / which do trifil forth
i^ this pert. But will yei nil yei / yei shall be compelled to co^fess this yt j
say / ye ye mass by it self is a denial of Ie. Christ's death / and a certai^
sacrilege inve^ted and ordained by satan to abolish ye sacrament of ye supp.
Nether ar yei able to deny but yt yer invocatio^ of saints / and suffrages for
ye dead / ar wicked abuses / whereby yt i^nvocatio^ of of gods n^a / a thing of
al o yer most holy is profaned And yei who emo^ge yepapist. do defile yem
selves with yes aboi^natio^s do think the^ selves guilty of no fawlte. What should
we do say yei? It is not leaful for us to correct and amend those things / with we
know evel and faulty / we are private me^ and yeiye have ye power and public
authority do earnestly defend yes things. Therefore we must suffer that violent
necessity. Igraunt all this to be true. But j say this is not to the purpose.
It belo^gth not to their office to correct and apoint a common order for the
people / nether does any man requier this at their hand / yet nevertheless they
arr admonished to amend them selves / and to institute an honest and manerly
behavour of private life / which thing without, al doubt pertains to their
duytye. Nether do we command the^ to cleanse the temples and the common
streates / but that every man keep his own body and heart in purity and
holiness / and labor by all means that god may be honored / served / and
obeyed / in his own house. For these arr far unlike and much dissonaunt / to
abolishe ye mass in any region / and not to be present at it / when as the use
thereof and that religion can by no other means be let. But they repete and
jterate their saing / that is / that they do not deny the death and passion of
Jesus Christ / seeing / they have no soche purpose / to worship it in their
mind. But j do ask of them / what is ye a Christen man does confess with his
mouth, but that same ye he beleveth in his heart? This is plain and manifest
jnough / that this thing which they do / is most disagreinge with the
confession of faith. So that / as much as in the^ lies / they do not only
hyde the true and propre testimonye of faith but also do utterly deny and
forsake it. I will yet talk with them something more familiarly and plainly.
For the papists do say the mass is a sacrifice wherein they will offer Jesus
Christ to reco^cile the^ selves to god. But if this be so / it follows that
Jesus Christ has not optained unto us by his death righteousness and eternal
salvation. Let them seek all the compases and shyftes they will / yet must they
come hereunto / that all which go to mass, under the name of devotion and
religion / do profess that they consent there with. Therefore as much truly as
in them lies they show ye they have not their redemption perfect jnough by ye
death of Jesus Christ. There be many that speak not so largely / nether suffer
their talk to wandre thorowout all sorts of masses / that is to say
sacrileges. They choose out one ki^de of masses only and yt they defend: it is
called ye parish mass / or ye high mass / for in this ye i think there is more
liknes and agreing with ye supper of Jesus Christ. And truly it might be said
not unaptly / yt al masses which arr said both of ye prestes of the lowest
degree / and also of ye canons / or of those prestes yt have certai^ chapels /
and al other which are founded by any man's will or yt ar so saleable ye they
be set forth daily to sale / yt al these j say are not unlike to harlots which
in ye stews setting them selves to sale without all shame and honestiel / do
make there bodies common to al me^ / but ye high mass to be very like yt same
harlot with does craftily abuse the honest name of an husband / to hide her
vnsha^fastnes / and to retain and defend the estimation of an honest and chaste
wife. Although this similitude does not agree on every part / because yt an
harlot joined in matrimony to an husband will have some sha^fastnes and
modesty / yt she will not set forth and make herself common to all yt comes:
but the parish or high mass is an whorish jdolatrie of al other most common /
ready and set forth to al men's desiers and wicked lusts: although these
filthy bawdes / do color and smoth here with this color and soche bewty / yt
they retain still some relikes of Jesus Christ's supper. It is with these as with the
thief who braggeth and bosteth him self then more highly and gloriously / when
he has wo^ne and is clothed with the spoils of him / who^ he has stain and
whose horse he rides on. We / say they / seek the supper of Jesus Christ /
and when we can not being oppressed under that tyranny / where in we dwell / have
the same pure / we must be content with that which is left to us / loking for
the helping hand of God. Forsooth a goodly and pretty excuse. By cause they have
no right and perfect use / of the supper / as though they had gotten a proviso
/ they witness and openly profess that they have not Jesus Christ the eternal
and only priest and therefore every weke do seek a new sacrifice / to put away
their sins. For all this is in the high mass as well as in that with is said in
the name of Nicholas or for the dead. In with thing they feign them selves to
worshipe an jdole / and yet do boste yt they seek Jesus Christ: and be cause
they would not seem to fight against god without swerd or buckler / they bring and
object the authority of this or yt ma^n / as though the absolution of any one
manne may exempt and deliver them yt they be not condemned of god. I will not
say yt they lie egregiously / when they alege soch men as they do for the
defense of their cause.

But in case it were so that a devout and godly man / were sometime of this mind
/ that he thought it was nothing evell to come to the high mass / yet afterward
when he knows the truth / if he does disalowe and condemn his former
judgment / his latter is so much the more to be beleved / for that God has
brought him / or rather compelled him to disalowe the same / and by cause he
perceveth and plainly knows / that he is overcome in that thing which he
before did greatly embrace and allow. But what need we herin to stir the
truth / as if we should bloundre and trouble a water that is pure and clear. Do
they think yt with the judgment and saing of a mortal man they may stop god
and hedge him in? We know that there is nothing besides the truth yt in judgment
ought to prevaill with out the respect of any person. This matter is soche / yt
the parish or high mass is i^stituted to sacrifice Jesus Christ / and to
reconcile the favor of god both for quick and dead / and also yt a piece of
bread should be there worshipped as though it were ye son of god. I do not
examine thoroughly all ye abominatio^s and wickedness / that arr in that mass for
they be almost innumerable. But j do rehearse only the worse and grosser. Now
let them yt do but feine a consent with soche wickedness and corruptions / wash
their hands so clean as they will / yet shall they never be more just and
innocent then Pilate. But this is a mervaill yt these good and religiouse
parishioners at easter time do seek some by chapel / or some mock christian monk
/ which may prepare and deliver unto the^ ye apish and cou^trefet supper. If
ye high mass is most nearest ye supper of Jesus Christ / as they say it is /
why do yei not observe and kept it? But now after that they have been at the
high mass every so^day through the year / because they would seem to co^icat in
the sacrament of the supper a right / they suddenly shake of and forsake the
high mass. But we should not mervaill at soch inco^sta^ ye cye / for this is a
sure and due punishment / for the^ which have laid no foundation at any time
of truth in there minds / ye they should always waver and be contrary to them
selves / in all things yey do and take in hand. As towching yt same
hypocritical supper / j know that they be of this mi^de / that they suppose it
to be the greatest iniurye to them selves yt may be when it is rebuked and
improved. But what ca^ we do in that matter sei^g it is nothing agreeable to
Christ's rule? Nether do j fide fault with this yt they do it secretly / for j
know that the supper was never better celebrated / nor more devoutly / then
when the disciples went in to some secret place / to fly the tyranny of the
enemies. But her ar two faults truly not to be suffered. One that they which
do make soche a supper and like apes do falsely and corruptly countrefet the
true supper of Christ / do feine that they keep and worshipe their mass. The
other is that the minister / which for the most part is some religious man the
rather to dissemble the matter / does not that office as a christian / but as a
pressed of ye popish profession, and in this they suppose they have an honest and
sure defense if the mass saier have not this purpose to show the bread and wine
to them to be worshipped / if he leave out the cano^ where in ar contained many
great impieties / and if he deliver ye sacrament to all yt be present under
both ki^ds. But when they shall come before ye highest judge the^ shall they
feel ye fruit yt they sought by soch glosi^g and lies / yea truly they ought
now already to perceav it. For j do judge those same goads and pricks where with
their co^scie^ces ar prikt and wounded to be agrevous feali^g of yt same
judgment. And truly this cause must be decided and plai^ly debated in yt same
place and court / where ye truth has her grave and true witnesses. For to be
short / they them selves do know them selves giltye of yt matter with they have
purposed to declare both to gods enemies and also to ye common people. But god
must neds deny him selff / if he allow the order and doing of that
profession. If all the men in the world with on mind and purpose would conspire
to pronounce these men ryghteous / yet none be he never so ready and mighty can
excuse and deliver them from this but they shalve thought to halte on both sids.

And god does declare by his prophet / that no so the haltig of any man shall be
ever allowed before him. As towchi^g the man whom they choose to be the
minister of their supper it is a folish thing to abuse his person / as though
they could seem to make him an apt man to that office and fu^ction. Yea but
the virtue of that same sacrament say they / rests not in the worthiness of
the ministres. That j grant and add this to also if any devel should ministre
ye supper / it should be never the worse. On the contrary part if an angel
singe mass yet then should it be no whit the better. But we are now in an other
question / that is / whether ordres geven by the pope to a mo^k do make him apt
to the office and function of a pastor. If they say contrary that they
perceave / that thing does make nothing to the purpose / and that they do not
choose him in that sort the thing it self shows contrary. But let it be that
they as towching the ministre have no soche respect. Yet must j abide in that
outward profession which they take upon the^ and worship / yea j must press it
earnestly / as a profession most contrary and unworthy a christen man. For
this is plain and manifest that they do and will defend and cover them selves /
under the person of a priest made for the nonce to color and dissemble.

But if they would rightly and law fully celebrat the supper / it were their
d^ietie so to separat the^ selves from the order and profession of jdolatours
that they should appear in that to have nothing common with them. But now they be
so far from this separation / yt they ascribe them selves in to their
fellowship and communion / and do every one of them feinedly profess them
selves to be me^bres of that body. After this they will compare us to the old
heretics / that did refuse the use of the sacraments for the vices of the
ministres / as though we do here respect the propre si^ncs of every man and
not rather the common state and condition. I do pass over this matter shortly /
by cause that which is spoken is sufficient jnough to convince so foul and
shamfull impudencye. But if these me^ be so folish and dull witted that they
perceave not this filthiness / the word of god must suffice us / as when the
lord says by the prophet Jeremy / Israel if thou doste turn / turn unto me.
In which words is most plainly expressed / with what simplicity and integrity
of mi^de we ought to deal and walk before god / with out any thought and will to
return to those things / which we know are not thankful nor allowed of him.
Which is a cause why.s. Paul also does testify yt he was sent to turn the
unfaithful from their vanities / unto the living god / as though he would say /
it is to no purpose to change some one old and accustomed evel with other
hypocrises and feinings / but utterly to a bolish al superstitions / that the
true religion may be set in her own purity and holiness. For with out this
faith and integrity / men never come the right way unto god / but do always
waver and ar vncertai^ to what part they may turn them selves. There be others
that are come thus far yt they disalowe and refuse the mass / but they would
have some patches kept still which they call gods service / least as some men say
/ they should seem to be destitute of all religion. And it may be that so me of
these be moved with a godly mind and zeall at the least j will so think / but
what so ever their zeall and purpose be / yet may we not say / that they keep
the true rule or any good measure.

Many say we may come to their baptismes / be cause there is no manifest
jdolatrie in them. As who would say / that this sacrament were not also
corrupted / and utterly deformed with all kind of corruption / in so much as
Jesus Christ may seem to be yet still i^ Pilates house to suffer all opprobries
and shames. To conclude / where as they sai yt this is the cause / why they would
retain some ceremonies / least they should appear to be void of al religion /
if one should examine their co^scie^ces / the same truly will answer / yt they do
it to satisfice the papists / and they change their countenance to fly
persequution. Other some do watch a time least they com in the mass whille /
and yet they come to the temple / that me^ should suppose they here mass. Other
some come but at evensong time / of whom j would know / whether they think this
to be nothing / that at that same time the jdoles be honored / that ye
pictures and images be sensed with fumigations / that a solemn prayer be made in
the intercession of some saint / and grownded on his merits / that Salve regina
be song with a loud voice / and that one very side a matter is herd so filled
and replenished with develish and cursed blasphemi that the mi^de shall not
only abhor the offen^ of the ears and eyes there present / but most
vehemently the thought and recordation there of. I do pass over that the singing
it self in an unknown tongue is manifest profanation of gods praises and of holy
scripture / ass s. Paul does admonish in the fourten to the Corinthes. But let
this last fault be forgeve^ the^. If they come to eve^song to geve some sign
and testimony of their Christianity / they will do this chefely on ye sole^
feasts. But the^ there shall be solemn ensensi^g the cheffest jdoles / and great
plenty of sweet fumigations powered out / the wc is a kind of sacrifice as the
scripture teaches. It was also a manner used among the Ge^tles / and whereby
they compelled the weak me^ to deny god. And for this cause the greatest part
of martyrs did suffer death constantly / for that they would not make perfumes
and burn incense to jdoles. When these men be come thus far / yt they receave
in there noses the savor of the sensours they also pollute them selves with
that pollutio^ with is most greatest and execrable there. And yet they think we
ought / to hide and cover this so great wickedness and mishef. But j beseech
the^ in the honorable and holy name of god / that they will diligently mark
this sai^g of the Psalm / yt jdoles ar so to be detested of the faithful and
godly man / that they should not be in his mouth or tongue / least ye talk had
of the^ should seem to co^taminat and defile him. This one word ought to fraie
and with draw us from all congregation and fellowship of jdolatours / by cause
that we livi^g in that congregation may easily be wrapped in and defiled. But
to speak plai^ly and freely what j think of al yes / with seek amea^ way betwixt
god and ye devel: yei have double and variable mi^ds / and j ca^ not fi^de out
a more apt and fete co^pariso^ to set yem out and pai^t yem in yeir lively
colors / the^ yt same which may be brought of Esau that same filthy and
double man. For when he saw his brother Jacob sent by his father Isaac in to
Mesopotamia to seek a wife / because the women of the land of Canaa^ did so
much mistike the father and his wife Rebecca yt they thought their life bitter
and irksom to lyve among the^ and rather wishes death / he marieth anew wife /
somewhat to satisfy his parents / but he does not put away the old. So yt he
does keep still yt evel whereof Isaac did so grevously complain / but somdeal to
amend the matter / he marieth anew wife. Eve^ so they that are so wrapped up in
the world / yt they ca^ in no wise follow god do me^gle and toss to gether many
and diverse ki^ds of religions and superstitions / yt ihei may apply and
conform the^ selves by some way to the will of god / and they always keep still
some corruption / so yt what soever they do / ca^ not apear to be pure and
sincere. I know also right well yt there be in those places many miserable souls /
with lyve there in great difficulties and cares / with truly coveteth to walk
rightly without hypocrisy / and yet can not lowse them selves / out of many
doubts and scruples / with is no merveill in so great and horrible confusion as
we see at this time in the papisme. Yea j do greatly pity their miserable
state / which seek means whereby they may serve god devoutly and live among the
enemies of faith if it may be possible by any ways. But what will we? I can do
nothing else to the one or to the other / but declare their error and sin / yt
they the^ selves may add the remedy. If they come herafter to ask of me this
or that more diligently and particularly / j will send soche curiouse
inquisitours to the common rule which have of god. I speak this for yt there be
some of this sort of men so importune / yt if a man should answer al their
difficulties and doubts / he should seem never to make an end of any thing. And
my think soche men may well be compared to the^ who after they be taught in a
sermon to use sobre apparel and decki^g of the body without al dissolute and
sumptuouse trimming / they would have the preacher to make their hoose and sewe
their shoes. Well what must we do the^? In this matter there is a certain thing
set before us where unto we ought to direct and conferr our wholl mind / study
and thought. That is yt the zeal of gods house may eat up our heart and so move
us / that we bear and take upon our selves / all dishonours / co^tumelies / and
opprobries / with ar done most unworthily against gods holy name. When soche
desire of gods honor / and ferve^t love shall be kindled in our hearts / not
like dry stubble sone set on fire and easily extinguished / but like a fire yt
burns continually / a man shall be so far from sufferi^g or approvi^g yes
aboi^atio^s wherwt the name of god most sha^fully and vnwortheli is polluted /
yt when he shall behold yem / he shall be hable in no wise to suffer
dissimulation / silence / and taciturnitie. And it is diligently to be marked /
yt he says / The zeal of gods house / yt we should know yt to be referred /
unto the outward order with is instituted in ye church / yt we should exercise
our selves in confession of our faith. I do not wey ye mockers with say / yt j my
self lyvig here without any danger / yea ratherin great quietness / do talk
goodlely of these matters. I a^ not he wtwhom these men have any thing to do / For
this is well known j have here no land of mine own. So may we think and say of
al these philsoophers with geve yeir judgment without knowledge of ye cause. For
seeing yei will not here god / who does now truly speak so jently to the^ / to
teach yem: j do declare ye day and judgment / at what time being called
before ye judgment seat of god / yei shall hear yt sente^c / against the which
yer shall be no answer / nor defense. For seeing yei will not hear him / as the
best and most meke master / they shall then know at the last / and feel him as
their most severe and just judge. At which time the stowtest and ye craftiest
of the^ shall perceave and know / yt they were deceaved in their opinions, Let
the^ be so well ezercised and prepared as they will / to obscure or subvert
justice and equity / yet their lawlike and judicial ornaments / and the badges
of the great dignity and power / wherewith they now prowdly wax insole^t / shall
not then geve them the victory. I speak this by cause counseilours / judges /
prortours / advocats / and soche other bearing the swinge in courts and
judgments / are not only bold to strive with God / and so to contend / that
they would seem / to have gotten a certain right to scorn and mock his majesty
/ but also rejecting all holy scripture / do spue out their blasphemies / as
the greatest sentences of the law / and most high decrees. These men who^ the
world does honor as certain jdoles / so sone as they have spoken one word /
can not suffer reason and truth to have any place to rest in.

But yet by the way j admonish and warn the^ before hand / that it shall be
better for them / to have some remembrance of that same horrible ve^gea^ce /
with is ordained for the^ yt change justice with iniquity / and truth with lye^ge.
Neyer ye doctors and cha^bremastres / ye delitiouse ba^ckettours and verai
voluptuose me^ / take any higher degree here / then that they may chatter in
their feasts and banquets and babble forth their words against the heve^ly
master / to whom truly al men ought to geve most dilligent ear. Nether can
their goodly and famous titles pluk any man from this judgment / in which the
lordly and reverent abbotes / priours / deans / archdecons / as chief masters
of the game shall be compelled to lead the dawnce in ye condemnation which god
shall make most grevouse. Now although the courtears ar wo^t to gratify men with
the spri^kling of their holy water let them not think yt they ca^ with yt kind
of doi^g satsfie god. To conclude / all jesters and praters let them hold
their tongue and boste not out their merry witty sai^gs / onles they will feel
his mighty hand / at whose word they ought to tremble. Where in their errovr is
to much folish yt beleveth by cause they take me for their adversary there for
they shall not have god to be their judge. Let them scrape my name out of their
books and utterly bloth it forth / specially in this kind of cause and
question / where in my purpose is only that god be herd and obeyed / not that j
should rule men's consciences after my lust / and charge them with any necesitie
or law. As for all others which do not so proudli dispi^se gods word / and
yet ar so delicate and weak that they can in no wise be moved / j do most
hertily be seche them / that they will take more thought and regard to their
own duty / salvation / and gods honor / and do no more flatter the^ selves /
as they have don hither to. Let them there fore open their eyes / and rear up
them selves that they may behold the miserye wherein they arr. I know well
jnough the evels / difficulties / and stoppes wherein they be wrapped among the
papists / j do not speak unto them / as though it were an easy matter in the
mides of the idolatries to take upon the^ and defend the pure and sincere
religion of god / but if they lack strength / j advertise the^ to fly unto god
the autoure of al power / yt they may be made strong by hi^ and learn to prefar
his glory before al things of this world. For j do earnestly desire that al
faithful men with ar miserably afflicted in the papisme / should vndrestand and
know this / how yt the prophet Jeremy remaini^g at Jerusalem in Iewri did se^d
this advertisment and exhortation unto the people with were holden captive and
oppressed in Babylon. If the tira^nye of the pope and of al his ministres be to
the^ sharp and cruel / they must considre / that the Jews also of that time
suffered heavy and bittre bondage / and yet they ar commanded in the vulgar
speech of ye country to execrate ye jdolatrie of ye Chaldea^s It is not
reason yt ye tyra^nie of men should break or any deal diminish from us ye due
honor we ow unto god. Her js no exception or pretense of privelege / with high
or low rich or poor may or ought to vsu rp unto the^ selves. Let al men there
for bow down yeir neck / and with most humility submit them selves to god. Let
ye poor man have yt true fear of god / let him not say vnconstau^tly j know not
what to do / least god answer him / nether know j what to do with ye. The rich
and wealthy men let them not lik drouke^ sloggards sleep in there wealth / and
consume in their prosperity / and aboundau^ce of all things / as it were in a
certain draff tubbe / but rather after ye example of.s. Paul / let them learn
to estem all yt / as dirtte and damage / wc does wtdraw us from godly and
christian life / or may seem any thing to hi^dre us. We also wc lyve here in
rest and quiet enioyeng ye use of ye greatest and si^guler benefits of god /
let us not for get ye j towched in ye begi^ni^g / yt we apply yes things to
our learni^g / yt what so ever herafter befawl us / or in to what so ev
country we shall beled / iet we may always constantly abide in ye pure
confession of our faith / detesti^g all jdolatrous religion / superstitions /
and abuses / wc ar against gods truth / do obscure his honor / and utterly
subvert his religion.

An homily containing An exhortation to suffer persequutio^ / yt we may there
in follow Jesus Christ and his gospel / taken of this sai^g / in ye xiij. Cap.
to the Hebreues. Let us go forth to him without the gates / bearing his
opprobrie.
ALL the exhortatio^s which ca^ be made to i^struct us to suffer patie^tly and
constau^tly for Christ Jesus name and his gospel / shall not much move us /
o^les we know and be perfectly persuaded of ye right / truth / and worthiness
of ye cause wherefore we contend. For when we be in that jeoperdie and danger /
that we must loose our life / we ought to be most certain of that thing /
wherefore we enter to so great peril.

But that constauncye and firmnes of mind can not be had / onles it be depely
founded in a certainty and sure persuasion of faith.

There be many which will unadvisedly and rashly ventre to dye for certain
folysh opinions invented of their own brain. But soche forwardnes of mind
ought rather to be thought a furiousnes then a christian zeall and love.

For assuredly there is no firmnes other of mind / or wit / or of common sense
/ in these men which do cast them selves in to peril with soche hargie rashness.
How so ever it be / god will not acknowledge and take us for his martyrs and
witnesses / without agood cause. For death is common for all men / and also the
condemnation of theves and of gods children / the sufferaunce of shame and
punishment seems to be all one / but god makes a difference betwixt them / by
cause he can not deny and forsake his own truth. This also is required yt we
have a sure witness void of al error of that doctrine / which we will defend.
Wherefore as j said / there is no exhortation so weighty / that can move and
perswadevs to suffer for the gospel / but if a true certainty of faith be
imprinted in our hearts.

For to put our life in danger / without any consideration unadvisedly / and
chaunceably / is most against nature. And so to do / should be thought rather
rashness / then Christian boldenes. Morover god aloweth nothing that we do onles
we be plainly persuaded that it is for his name sake / and for his cause that
the world is so against us / and does hate us.

But when j speak of soche certainty and persuasion of mind / j do not only
vndresta^d this yt we should know to discern and judge betwixt the true religion
/ and the folish opinions / and constitutions of men / but also that we be
thoroughly persuaded of everlastig life and the crovn promised unto us in heven
after our conflict in this world. Let us now mark well yt these two reasons do
partaine to our duty / and must be joined to gether / yt the one may in no
wise be separated and disioyned from the other. It is mete therefore to take our
beginning of this / that we vndrestand and know / what is our Christian
religion / what faith it is that we ought to hold and follow / what rule of life
god has geven us. Nether must we only have our mi^ds instruct with this godly
doctrine / but also have our minds so armed and prepared / that we may freli
and boldly damn all errors / lies / and superstitions / which satan has
brought in to the world / to corrupt the pure simplicity of gods doctrine.
Therefore it is no mervaill / that there is so small a number of men / that have a
ready mind and desire to suffer for the gospel / and that the greatest part of
them / that profess them selves Christians / knows not the power of the
Christian religion / and there own profession. Al men in a manner ar negligent /
and have no desire or very small / to here and read / who thinks it
sufficient / if they have gotten so me small taste of the Christian faith. And
this is ye cause why there is ^ene in these no surety and constancy of mind /
and yt so sone as they come in to any conflict / they ar so abashed / as though
they should bye and bye utterly perish. For with consideration our desire ought to
be greater to pur sue and search out most diligently gods truth / that therewith
our hearts may be persuaded with out any doubt. Nether is this al to have soche
knowledge and vndrestanding. For we see many so well travailed in gods doctrine
that they seem as though they were stained and died yer with / in whom never the
less there is no desire and love of god / no more truly then if they had known
nothing at any time of the godly doctrine / but by a certain unsure / light /
and wavering opinion. But what other cause is there of this so great
uncertainty and levitie / but that they did never perceave in there mind the
majesty of yt holy scripture. And truly if we would rightly way / that it is
god that speaks to us theirin we would here him with more diligence /
attention and revere^ce. If we would think in readi^g the scripture / that we are
in the schole and discipline of angels / we should have an other manner of desire
to exercise our selves in that doctrine / which is setforth to us / to confort
/ strengththe^ / and instruct our mi^ds. Now we see what is the way to prepare
our selves to patience and sufferaunce for the gospel / that is so to goo
forward in the doctrine there of / that being throwly persuaded of the true
religion and that doctrine which we ought to hold and defend / we may nothing
esteem / and despise all the fravds and illusions of ye devel / and all the
inve^tions of men / as things not only of no value / but also execrable / by
cause they vttrely corrupt the Christian synceritie. And herin we differ as
true martyrs of Jesus Christ / from the furiouse and stifnecked men / which
suffer for their own folish opinions. Secondly we ought to be so minded / that
being assured of the right and goodness of the cause / we should be enflamed with
this due desire to follow god whither so ever he shall call us / to embrace his
word with soche reverence as it is worthy / and being called bak from the
deceitful fashion of this world / as men ravished / with their whole mi^de and
endevoir should be carried to an heve^ly life. But o most miserable case / yt
when the light of god does shine unto us in these days so bright as it did
never shine in ye remembrance of me^ / yet so little zeal / favo2 and love
should be found. Wheri^ our misery is so much the greater / that in so great
filthiness and unthankfulness we are not overwhelmed with blushing shame. For we
must shortly come before yt judge / before whom our vice and evel with we by all
means go about to hide / shall be brought forth / with that rebuke and chek /
whereby the just cause of our destruction shall apear. For if we be so endebted
and bound to god / that for the knowledge he has geven us / we ought to geve to
him honorable and thankful testimony / why is our stomak so abashed and
fearful to enter in to the batell? Especially seeing god in this our age / has
so opened him self / that it may be rightly said and truly / that he has
opened and plainly set forth / the greatest treasurs of his secrets. May not
this be said / that we so think of god / as though we seemed to stand no need of
him at all? For if we had any consideration of his majesty / we durst never be
so bold to turn the doctrine / which proceadeth out of his mouth in to
philosophye and vai^ speculation. In fine we can have no excuse / but this must
be unto us the greatest shame / yea an horrible condemnation / that in so great
knowledge / obtained by the singular goodness of god we have so little love and
mind to defend and keep the same. For first / if we will call to our
rema^braunce the martyrs of old time / and compare their wondreful constancy
with this our te^dre slouthfulnes / we shall find passing great cause to detest
our own filthiness. For they were not for the most part so travailed and
excercised in the scripturs / that they could learnedly dispute of all matters.
But first of al / they knew and held fast this / that there is one god / who^
they ought to serve and honor: then / that they were redeemed with the blood
of Jesus Christ / that in him only and in his grace they should put their
affiaunce / and trust of salvation. Morover they did judge all other inventions
and ordinances of me^ / to worship god / so unworthy filthiness / that they
could easily condemn al jdolatries and superstitions: to conclude in few words
this was their divinity / there is one only god the maker of the whole world /
which has declared unto us his will by Moses and the prophets / and then by
Jesus Christ and his apostles. We have one redemer / with whose blood we were
bought / and by whose grace we hope to be saved. All the jdoles of the world / ar
to be detested and accursed. They came stoutly and boldly to the fire / or
other kind of death / and punishment / instructed with no other doctrine and
more hidden knowledge. And the number of them was not small / as of two or three
/ but so great that ye multitude of the^ / which were cruelly vexed and
tormented of the tyrants seemed innumerable and infinite. But we are so taught
and instructed / that we pass all our auncetours in knowledge and vndrestandi^g
of holy scripture. We think in our selves / and it is true / as touching the
vndrestanding of the scripture / god has e^dued us with so much knowledge / as
he has geve^ to any age at any time. And yet there is in us scantly the least
drop of fervent love toward god. There is no reason why we should norish this
nice cowardnes of mi^de / onless we would willi^gly and wittingly provoke ye
wrath and vengeaune of god / against our selves.

What must we then do? Truli we must tak to us astowt / bold / and co^sta^t
mi^d. We must chefely considre how precious and honorable the confession and
testificatio^ of our faith is before god.

For we do little know / how God does esteem this confession / when our life
which is of no value / is more set by and dear unto us.

Wherein our wondrefull and beastly folishnes is showed: for we can not in this
sort spare our life / but we must needs confess that we set more thereby / then
by gods honor and our own salvation. A certain hethen man could use this saing
/ that it is a miserable thing / to forsake and betray the causes why we lyve
for the conservation of life. Yet he and his lyk did never know truly / to what
end men were set in ye world / and where for they lived there in. They might well
say / that virtue is to be esteemed and followed / and that we ought to lyve an
honest life / without blame. But all there virtues were nothing else / but
colors and shadows. But we have better vndrestanding / whereunto our life must
be referred / which is / that we honor God / with all praise and glory /
that he him self may be our glory.

Without him / our life is miserable / the which we can not continue the least
moment but we shall heap upon our selves / a perpetual malediction. And yet we are nothing a shamed for the winning of a few days / for this feeble life / to
refuse the eternal kingdom / and to separate our selves from him / by whose
power we are continewed in this life. If a man should examine the most unlearned
/ yea those whose wit is so dased / and whose life so voluptuouse / that they be
most like to brute beasts / what manner of life is appointed them / they durst
not say plainly and openly / that it should co^nsiste o^lye in eating / dre^king
and sleapi^g, For they know that they ar created to a better / wort hier and
more higher thing: which is nothing else / but to serve and honor god with all
ki^d of honor / and to suffer our selves as good children / to be ordered and
rueled by our most bening father / that after the end of this fraill and unsure
life / we may be received in to his eternal heretage. In the apointing and
winning of this end / consists the chefest and greatest point of our
felicity / yea all the wholl weight of ever lasting life. But when we carrye
our mi^ds and thoughts an other way / and do snatch fast hold of this present
life worse then a thou sand deaths / what excuse can we have? For / to lyve
and be ignorant of the causes wherefore we lyve / is unnatural. But to forsake
the causes wherefore we lyve here / for the desire and love to prolong our life
as it were for three days in this deceatful world / and to be separated from
god the author of life / is soche a bewitching and furiouse madness / yt j know
not with what words we ought to express and show it. But what so ever knowledge
we have / and how so ever our life is appointed / for so much as not with
standing the persequutions ar no less and bitter / let us consider how and by
what mea^s the Christian men may confirm them selves in patiencye / and so
strengh then their minds / that they may constantly ve^tre to danger their
life for gods truth. This same text which we have recited / being well
vndrestonded may bring us to that indifferencye of mind / yea to that
willingness / that we shall not refuse to suffer death for gods name. Let us go
forth of the city / says the apostle / after the lord Christ / bering his
opprobrie. First / he does teach and admonish us / that although the swerds are not already drawn to kill us / or the fires kindled to broyll and burn us /
yet that we can not truly be joined with the son of god / so long as we have
the roots of our thoughts and desiers fixed in this world. Wherefore the Christen
man must always / although he be in quiet / have one foot lifted up ready to
the battle / and not only that / but also his mi^d must be vtterli separated
from ye world although his body be theri^. Althought this at ye first sight may
seem unreasonable / yet one saing of.s. Paull / ought to be sufficient to
persuade us / for that we be called and appointed to this / to suffer
persequution.

As though he should say / Soche is the condition of our Christianity / that
we must neds enter in and pass through this way / if we will follow Christ. In
the mean season / to ease our infirmity and to mitigate the tediousnes and
hevines / which persequutiones bri^geth / we have this great and sweet comfort
/ that we suffering all these inco^modities / opprobries and dangers of life
for the gospel / do as it were set our feet / in every fotestep of gods son
/ and do follow him as our prince and guide. If it had been only said unto us /
yt we must pass through all the opprobries of ye world to keep the christian
profession / and also suffer death freely and with out fear when so ever gods will
were / methi^k we should have had some color to answer and say contrary / that
it is a thing diverse and abhorring from our nature to wandre so with out a
guide. But seeing we are charged and commanded to follow ye lord Jesus / his
leadi^g ought to seem so right and honorable / that we have no just excuse to
refrain or refuse his commavndement.

But that we should have mor earnest love and desire toward this lawdable and
helthfull example / it was not only said that Jesus Christ does lead the way
as guide and prince / but also that we are made li^ke unto his jmage.

For so.s. Paul in the epistle to the Romans speaks / that god has chosen and
called all them whom he has taken in to the nu^bre of his children / that they
should be like and be fashioned after the jmage of him which is appointed
pattern and head over all. What / ar we so nice and tender yt we can or will
bear and suffer nothing at all? Then must we neds refuse gods grace whereby he
calls us to the hope of salvation and leads us there to by this way? Forthes
two ar so joined to gether yt the one can not be separated from the other /
that we be the members of Jesus Christ / and that by means of this conjunction
and communion / we be exercised with many afflictiones and calamities. This
same manner of our life so joined with gods son / and soche conformity to him
/ we ought to esteem mor then we do / and also to judge it not only by all
ways most worthy to be professed but also to be followed. The suffering of
calamities for the gospel / in the opinion and judgment of the world / is the
greatest infamy but seeing we know that all the unfaithful ar so blinded / that
they can see or ryghtly judge nothing at all / ought not we to have clear eyes
/ and to judge mor perfectly? It is shame to be afflicted and vexed of the^
that occupy the seat of justice. But.s. Paul does show us by his example /
that we have great occasion to glory in the scarres of Jesus Christ / and as
it were in certain marks imprinted in us / where with we being marked and decked
/ god does acknowleg and receav us for his servau^ts a^delect. And we know this
yt.s. Luke does rehearse of Peter and Joan / that they were very glad and
joyful / that they were thought worthy to suffer for the lord Jesus name /
sclandre rebuks and shame. Where in two things may be seen contrary in them
selves / shame / and honor / by this that the world running hedlong in fury
and madness does judge against all reason / and by this means does change the
glory of god with dishonor and infamy. Let not us now disdain so to be
despised and to be rebuked of the world / that we may herafter optaine with god
and his angels / honor / glory and praise. We see what great labors
ambitiouse men takes to obtain the order of some king / and after they have
at cheved it / what trivmphes they make: but the son of god does offer to us
his order / and yet every one dispiseth it / and is turned with the wholl
power of ye mi^de to ye vanity of ye world. I pray you when we behave our
selves so proudly and vntha^kfully / ar we worthy to have any thing common with
him? Although our vndresta^ding ca^ perceave and co^prehe^d nothing heri^ / yet
of a truth these ar the propre and honorable badges and arms of hevenly
nobility. Imprisonme^ts / banishments / maledictions / after the opinion of
men bring nothing else then great sham and infamy. But what does let us to see
what god does judge and pronounce of yes things / savi^g our own i^fidelitie?
Wherefore we must labor yt ye name of gods son be of soche authority / weight
/ and honor with us / as it is most worthy / yt we think we are well and
honorably dealt with al / yt his burns as it were certain badges ar printed in
us / or else our unthankfulness ca^ in no wise be borne. If god should persequut
us after our merits / has he not just cause every day to chastise and punish
us i^finite ways? Yea surly no deaths put unto us were able to reco^pe^ce ye
least part of our mischefe. But of his great and infinite goodness / he treads
under foot al our si^nes / and does vtterli abolish ye same / and whereas he
might punish us according to ye greatness of our si^nes / he has i^ve^ted a^
other merveilous way / whereby ye afflictions ar traduced from our deserved
pain and punishment / to a great honor / and a certai^ privilege and si^guler
benefit / because yt by ye partaki^g and sufferi^g of the^ we are received in
to ye fellowship of gods son. May it be o yer ways said or judged / then that
we / seeing we despise and disdain this so excellent and blisfull condition and
manner of living / have little profetted in the christian doctrine? This is the
cause why.s. Peter after he had moved us to lyve a godly and holy life in the
fear of god / far from that life wherefore other men as theves / whormongers /
adulterours / and me^killers suffer / by and by adds this / yfwe must suffer
as christian men / there in we geve glory to god for that great and singular
benefit / which he has bestowed on us.

Nor it is not for nothing that the holy man speaks thus / what ar we / j
pray you / yt we should be witnesses of gods truth / and as it were proctours
appointed to defend his cause. Behold we be miserable me^ as it were worms of
the earth creaturs full of vanities and lies / yet god will have his truth
defended by us / which is truly so great honor / that it seems not to pertain
to the angels in heven. This one reason well considered / ought it not to
inflame and stire up our minds / to offer our selves wholly to god / and to show
our wholl endevoire in so holy and excellent a matter to please him? And yet
many can not forbear / but that they will speak against god or at the least they
will complain / that he has no greater regard to ease their imbecillitie. it
is a merveilous matter / say they / that seeing god has borne us thus much
fovoure / that he has chosen us to be his children / yet he will suffer us to
be so cruelly vexed and oppressed of wicked men. I do yet answer these men /
that although we knew no reason why god does so deall with us / yet his
authority should be soche with us / that we should apply / and conform our
selves to his will. But now when we see Jesus Christ to be set for an example
to us / least we should seek any other / ought we not to think our selves
greatly happy / that we be so drawn after his jmage and liknes? Morover god
does set forth and she we plai^e and manifest causes / wherefore he will have us
to suffer persequution / emonge which / if there were non other but that reason
and advertisment which.s. Peter geveth / we must neds be very pevish and
sturdye / onless we be satisfied there with.

This is his reason / that seeing gold and silver which are corruptible metalls
ar purged and tried in the fire / it is reason that our faith also / which in
value excels all riches / be tried and approved with soche perils of life
and greves.

He could by and by after our calling / with out any conflict and suffering of
these calamities have crowned us. But as he would have Christ to rai^g in the
mides of his enemies / eve^ so he would have us also dwelli^g among yt selfsame
/ to bear and suffer yeir viole^c and oppression until we be delivered from
these afflictiones and calamities by him. And j am not ignorant / that the
flesh will then greatly spurn and refuse to be ruled / when it must be brought
in to this state / but yet the will of god must rule all our thoughts and
lusts. If we feel in our selves some contradiction and resistaunc it is not
greatly to be merveiled at. For that is planted and engraven in our nature to
fly the cross. Yet let us not abide still / in that tendrenes of the flesh /
but let us go on forward / knowing that our obedience is thankful and
acceptable to god / so that we cast down our senses and appetits / and do so
subdue them / that they be under his power. Nether did the prophets and
apostles com to death with mind / that they did not perceave their will to be
against it / and enclini^g an other way. They shall lead the whether thou wolds
not / said our lord Jesus to Peter. So when soche fear of death does prik our
mi^ds let us labor by all means / that we may have the overhand / or rather
that god may overcome / and in the mean while let us thus persuade our selves /
that it is to him a most pleasant sacrifice / when we resist our appetites /
and do so withstand them / that by this means being subdued under his power /
we may order and lead our life after his will and pleasure. This is the
cheffest and greatest battle / whereunto god will have all his with all there
power to apply / to the end they may labor / to cast down and depress all
that which does so much exalte it self in their senses / wits and appetits
/ that it does carye and withdraw themfrom ye way / which god does show to
the^. In the mea^ season / the co^solations ar so great and weightye / that it
can not be expressed / how much deyntie cowardnes is in us / when we wax
faint herted / and geve over for these perils and troubles. In old time the
number was almost infinite of them / which for the desire of a garland made of
corruptible leaves / did refuse no labor / pain and wrastlinge / and also
did so suffer death it self / that they might seem to have their life in no
price. And yet there was none of them / but did contend chanceably being
uncertain / whether he should win / or lose the game. God does set before us an
immortal crown / wheri^ we may optaine his own glory. And he has not
appointed us / an uncertain and chanceable conflict / but does promise soche
are ward / to the which we ought to conferr all ye counseills / studies / and
desiers of our life.

What is the cause / that we are so faint herted in the largenes and worthiness
of this honor / which is certain and eternal? Do we think yt this was spoken
in vain / that we shall lyve with Christ / if we be dead with him? The triu^ph
is prepared for us / but we so much as we may do fly from the conflict and
battle. But this doctrine is soche / that it seems plainly to disagree with
man's judgeme^t. This is true.

Nether also Christ / when he pronounces the^ blessed which suffer
persequution for right eousnes sake / does propownd soche a sentenc as ye
opinion of the world would allow or receav.

Yea he will have us to think / that to be ye cheffest felicity / which we
judge the greatest misery. We think our selves most miserable / when god does
suffer us to be afflicted and oppressed with the tyra^nye and cruelty of our
enemies. But we do wondrefully err in this / yt we set not before our eyes gods
promises / with do plainli confirm unto us / that al things shall come to our
profect / joye / and salvation. We cast down our stomakes and dispare when we
see wicked and naughty men / to have the overhand on us / and to do yt cruelty
to vsyt they seem to tread down our neck with their feet. But this same most
cruel vexation of the wicked / and so great trouble and confusion of things /
as s. Paul warns / ought rather to co^firm our mi^ds raise up and litte the^
in to heve^. For by cause of our own nature we are bent to ye study and love of
things present / and ar so inflamed yt wtour whole knowledge / mi^d and
cogitatio^ / we are occupied in to much levi^g and using this vanity: god /
when he suffers us to be thusevel vexed and handled / and ye wicked to grow
and flourish in all things / does teach and admonish us by these plain and
notable sings of his most just judgeme^t / yt / that day shall once come / when
all things yt be now troubled and confused / shall be sattled. But if yt same
time seem far and long to / let us fly to ye reamedie / and let us not flatter
our selves in our vice. For this is certain yt we have no faith at al onless
we cast ye eyes of our mi^de to ye honorable coming of Jesus Christ.

And because god would leave out no consideration / yt might be apt to move and
stir us / he does set forth on ye one part promises / on ye other pert
threateni^gs. Do we feel yt ye promises of god have not force jnough and
authority in us? To co^firm the^ wtal let us joi^ yerto ye threateni^gs. We
show our selves wo^dousti froward / sense we beleve gods promises no more yen
we do. When ye lord Jesus Chri. Mat. x. Luc. ij.
says / he will acknowleg us for his own and co^fess so of us before his father
/ so yt we also co^fess him before men / what should let us to geve to him that
confession / which he requires of us?

When men have done all they can / the worst yei may do is to take away our
lyves. How preciouse then shall the heve^ly life be unto us when it is compared
with this present life which is lost? It is not my purpose in this place to
collect all the promises set forth in the scripture to this end. Yet sense they
be repeated and so often times renewed unto us / we ought so to be exercised not
only in the readi^g / but also in ye knowledge and consolation of them / that we
might be as it were died and surely confirmed in them.

But if when ye plage hangs over our heads three or four of them are not
fufficient to confirm and strengthen us / truly an hundredth should be
sufficient to overcome al adverse and contrary temtations. But if god with
these great sweet promises can not entice and draw us to him / ar we not very
great dullerds / and betle heads / when nether the sever threatenings can work
any more in us? Luc. ix.
Jesus Christ does appointe adaye to accuse all them before his father which
deny the truth for fear of losing this life / for whom he declares
destruction both of body and soull to be prepared. Mat. x.
Also in an other place he protests that he will refuse all manner of
communion with them that deny him before men. These words onlese we be utterly
void of all sense ought vehemently to move our minds and so to fray us / that
for fear the hears of our head should stert up. But how so ever it be / onles
we be so affected and moved as the greatness of the matter and danger requires
/ there remains nothing else for us but to look for horrible and most
miserable confusion: wherein we may excuse our fault so much as we lust / and
we may say that in this great frailty and weakness of nature / we rather ar
worthy of mercy then of any severitie and sharpnes of punishment / it will not
serve. Heb. xj.
For it is written on the contrary part / that Moses after he had seen god by
faith was so hardened and strengthened / that no violence of temptation co^^melt
his mind / and be^d him from that great co^stancye. Wherefore when we be so
tender and flexible that there appear in us no power of firm and constant mind
/ we signify and declare plainlye that we be utterly ignorant of god and his
kingdom. Also when we are werned that we ought to be joined and cowpled with our
head / we have gotten a goodly color to exempt and separat our selves from
him / if we say we are me^ And were not yei yt were before us men so well as we
are? Yea if we had nothing else / but even the bare doctrine of godliness / yet
were al ye excuses with we can brig weack and of no value. But now ar we worthy
more greater chek and condemnation / sense we have so great and notable
examples / whose great authority ought vehemently to excite and confirm our
minds. There ar two chief parts of this our exhortation or consolation to be
considered. The firstis / yt this has been a common state to the universal
body of the church always and ever shall be to the end of the world / that it
was vexed with soche injuries and contum^ lies of the wicked / as it is
reported in the Psalm Psalm. ^.xxix.
/ They have vexed me eve^ now from my iouth hither to / and have drawn a
plough over and over e very pert of my bak. The holy ghost in this place does
bring in the old church speaki^g on this wise yt it should not seem now unto us
a new ying nor greavouse / if we see in these days our cause and condition to
be like. S. Paul also reciti^g ye same place of an o yer Psalm. where it is said
/ We were as it were sheep led to the slaughter / does declare yt this
pertained not only to one age / but it was and shall be the common / usual and
continual state of Christ's church. So yt if we see in this time ye church to be
so handled and vexed / by ye insole^cie and pride of ye wicked / yt some bark
at her / some bite her / mani afflict her / and always inve^t some mischef and
pestilent destruction to her / yea and set up on her without ceasig as it were
mad dogs and will de raveni^g beasts / let us call to remembrance yt she was
so vexed afflicted and oppressed i^ al times before. God does geve unto her
so^time / some rest and refreshi^g and as it were a time of true. And this is
yt wc is spoken in the psalm above alleg^d / ye righteous lord does cut i^
sodre ye cords of the wicked: and i^ an other place / yt he breaks their
rod / Psalm. c. xxv.
lest ye good being to much pressed should fai^t and move yeir hands to
i^iquitie. But god would always have his church to be tossed in this world / and
as it were always in a certai^ conflict / reservi^g for her quiet rest in
heven. The end of these afflictions was always blessed / yea truly god wrought
this yt the church always pressed with mani and great difficult calamities / was
never vttrely oppressed. ij. Cor. iiij.
As it is said in an other place / the wicked with all their labor did never
optain yt they desiered. S. Paul also does so glory of like happy end and
issue of afflictions / yt he shows this grace of god to be perpetual in his
church. We says he / ar pressed with all kind of afflictions / but we are not
killed with sorrow and care / we live in greatnede and poverty / iet ar we not
for saken we are cast down but we perish not / always carrie^g about the
mortificatione of our lord Jesus Christ / that his life also may be declared in
our mortal body. This issue and end / as we see that god has always made it
happy and prosperouse in ye persequutio^s of the church / ought to bolden us /
seeing we know that our fathers / who also acknowledged their frailty and
weakness / had always the victory over their enemies / by cause they continued
constant in paciencye. I do entreat this first part of my exhortatione briefli
/ that j may come the sooner to the second / which does more pertain to the
purpose. And that is / that we apply certain examples of the martyrs which
were before us / to our consolation and confort. And in this kind or nu^bre
there be not two or three / but a great and thik cloud as ye apostle writes to
ye Hebrews. Heb. xij.
Whereby he signifies / that there is so great a multitude of them / which has
suffered for the testimony of the truth / that so well the abundance of
excellent examples / as the most grave authority ought to provoke us to
co^tentatio^ patiencie / and moderation of mind. And least my oration should
wax to long in heaping up together an i^finite multitude of examples / j will
only speak af is jews / which suffered most grevouse persequutio^ for ye true
religion / both under ye tyra^nie of king Antiochus / and also shorthly after
his death. We can not say yt the^ the nu^bre of ye afflicted me^ was small /
when a great mighty army as it were of martyrs was prepared to maitaine and
defend ye religion. Nether can we allege yt they were certain excellent
prophets / who^ god had chosen forth and separated from ye common sort of
people / for there were women / boys / and infants / also in that nu^bre of
martyrs. Nether will we say yt they passed through ye persecution / only with
some light loss / without great peril of life / without great pains and
torments of bodies / seeing / there was no ki^de of cruelty vnproved in
afflicti^g / vexing / and torme^tig them. Let us here also what ye apostle does
say of them / and does set forth for us to follow.

Some says he / Heb. xj.
were hanged up like belles and stretched / dispising to be delivred yt they
might optaine a beter resurrection: other were proved with opprobrious words
and strippes / or with bonds and prisonment: other were stoned / or cut
insondre / or killed with the swerd: other some went wandering hither and
thither through hills and caves of the earth. Let us now come to make comparison
betwixt the^ and us. If yei suffered so mani and great torments for ye truth /
with was as then but obscure / what ought we to do in this great light / with has
shined unto us in this time? God speaks unto us now as with full mouth. The
greatest gate of the kingdom of heven is made open unto us. Jesus Christ
comen from heven unto us does so call us to him / that we have him present as
it were before our eyes. In to how great ingratitude and sha^full wickedness
shall we ru^n i^ to / if we have less stomak and love to bear and suffer for ye
gospel / the^ they had with did behold ye promises of god but as it were a far
of / who had but a very little door opened to enter in to ye higdome of god /
who had received only a reme^braunc and obscure testimoni in figures of Jesus
Christ? These great matters ca^ not be declared and expressed with any words as
they beworthy. Wherefore j leave them to be weied in every manes thoughts and
meditations. This doctrine as it has a common and universal reason / so it must
be referred to the exercise and order of every manes life. But every man must
apply it to his propre use and profett apt for his own co^solatio^. And j speak
this for this cause / least yt they with see them selves to be in no manifest
peril / should suppose this doctrine to be vain and not to pertain to the^.
Now they arr not in ye hands of tira^tes / but what know they how god will
deal with the^ herafter? Therefore we must be of ye mi^d and judgment / yt if any
persequntio^ / with we looked not for happen unto us / yt we fall not yer i^ to
unawares and unprovided / but yt we come to it prepared long before hand, but j^
fear yer be mani deaph ears to who^ yis my oration is made without fruit. For
yei yt live i^ quiet / havi^g all things at will / ar so far from prepari^g yem
selves to take and suffer death when need shall be / yt yei have no care nor
yought of servi^g god at al. But yes ought to be al our study co^tinualli /
espetialli i^yes great troubleso^ times / wheri^ we live i^ great peril In ye
mea^ time yei who^ god calls to suffer for ye testi^onie of his name / must
yinke i^verai deed yt they were prepared long before / and brought to this
suffrau^c of evels / by ye motion and certain judgeme^t of ye ^prit / yt yei
might bear yem selves yeri^ boldly and co^sta^tli. The^ also yei must
diligently call to yer reme^brau^c al ye exhortatio^s with yei have herd before /
and be so stirred up with ye advertisme^t of the^ / as ye valiau^t souldiare to
take his armor when he hereth ye trumpet blow. But what seek we?

Truly in yes perils we do nothing else: but seek shifts and ways how to
escape. I mea^ this by ye most pert of me^. For this same persequutio^s is as
it were a towche stone / wherwt god does try and prove who be his: but yer ar
few found of yt faith, cowrage and godliness to wards god / yt they will offer
the^ selves fra^kly and freely unto death for his names sake. This is a thing
almost incredible / yt yei with do glory / yt yei have some knowledge in the
gospel / arso impudent and unshamefast / they will use soch cavillations. Some
will say / what shall it availl to confess our faith before those stubborn
stifnecked men / which are purposed to war against god him self? Is not this
to cast pearls before swine? As who would say / Jesus Christ does not most
plainly declare / ye he does requier of us the confession of his name / yea
among most perverse and wicked men? But if this our testimony do nothing
profett to their edifie^g / yet shall it profett to yeir confusion. Always ye
confession of our faith does savor swetly before god although it bri^ge death
and destructjo^ to wicked men. There be other also which will say this / what
shall our death profett when it shall seem to geve more offense then utility?
As though god has left to them selves fre choice to dye when they will or when
they shall think it the most apt time of death? But we contrary wise do obey
him but as for the fruit yt must come by our death / we leave to the hand and
providence of god. Wherefore the christian man must most cheflye in what place
so ever he be / diligently se yt he lyve in ye simplicity and integrity yt
god requires / and yt he be not brought from yt mi^d and manner of godly and
holy life at any time with any dangers or threatni^gs. Let him eschew so mothe
as is possible the ragi^g madness of the wolves / so yt the same wtarenes be not
joined with the prudence and craftines of the flesh. First of all let him do this
/ yt he geve over and resign his life in to the hands of god the most
faithful keaper. When he has ordei^ed and kept diligently this manner and
fashione of life / if afterward he fall in to the hands of enemies / let him
think and perswad him self / yt he is brought in to yt place of god / for this
cause yt he may have him a witness of his son. Therefore sei^g he is called and
brought to yt confession by the certain decree of god / there is no way to goo
bak / onles he will be unfaithful un to him / to whom we have promised all our
endeavors both to lyve and dye: yea whose we arr although we had promised
nothing at all. I mea^ not herby to drive every man of necessity at all times
to geve a full and perfect confession of yeir faith / no not so^times when yei
be asked. For j know what measure and moderation.s. Paul used / who was as
ready with heart and mi^de to defend ye gospel as any other. Nether was this
spoken by ye lord Jesus and promised with out a cause / yt god would geve us in yt
time and matter / a mouth and prudence. As though he would have said / ye office
of ye holy ghost / is not only to confirm us ye we may be willi^g / bold and
strong / but also it consists i^ gevi^g us judgment prude^e and cou^sail /
how we may / as it be comes us / govern and rule our selves / in so great and
so herd amater. Truly this wholl treatise is to this e^d yt they yt be i^ soch
distresses should desire and receav from heaven yt moderation and prudence / not
folowi^g ye cou^sail of the flesh to seek some shifts to escape. But there be
yt do object in this place / yt the lord Jesus yea when he was asked would make
to the^ no answer. But j sat yt this suffices not to take away yt rule / with he
has geve^ to us / to witness our faith the^ when ye confession there of is
necessarily required. Furthermore / yt he did never disse^ble or keep silence
for this purpose to save his life. Last of al yt he did nevermake so doubtful
a^ answer / but yt it contained a^ apt testimony of that with he had spoken
before / or else did first satiffie the^ yt lay i^ wait to mark both his words
and deeds. Wherefore let al christians be well persuaded and sure of this thing /
yt no man ought more to este^ his life the^ ye testimony of ye truth wherein
god will have ye praise and glory of his name to appear. Is it with out acause /
yt he calls althos his witnesses (for this does ye word martire signify) who
ar brought to make answer before the enemies of faith and religion? Or is not
this rather the cause / for yt he would use all their speaki^g and whole course
of life to the confession of his name? Wherein every man must not so look to
his neghbour and fellow / yt he will seem to do nothing at al with out his example
and testimony. And this curiosity is so much the mor to be eschued because we are prone to this vice of our own nature. Peter when he had herd of Christ
that he should be led i^ his old age whether he would not he e^quired what
should be come of Ioa^ his fellow and companion. There is none of us / with to
avoid peril and danger / would not gladly make answer in ye wise / by cause
when we should suffer any thing / by and by this comes in to our mi^de / what
is the cause where for j should suffer more then others? But Jesus Christ does
cou^sail and monish other wise us al in common / and every man privately / to be
prepared and ready / yt as he calls on or other / so every man come forth
in his order. And j have showed this before / yt we shall be unarmed and
unprepared to take and suffer martyrdo^ / o^less we be fe^sed and armed with the
promises of god. Now remains to declare ple^tifully soche promises / not yt
we will set forth every one exactli / but to she we the chief and most
excellent thing / with god would have us to hope for / to comfort us i^ our
calamities. And there be three soche things: the first / yt sei^gal the times
both of our life and death do consist in his hand / he will so defend us by his
power / yt not one hear of our head shall faul but after his will. Wherefore al
faitful me^ ought yus to beperswaded / in whose hands so ever they be tossed /
that god in no wise will lay a side that governaunce and custody / which he
has taken upon him for the^ with so great care. If this persuasion of gods
fatherly care / and providence did rest and cleave deep in our hearts / we should
be delivered out of hand / of the greatest part of these doubts and
difficulties / which do now trouble and hindre our duty. We behold now the
bitterness of the tyraunts / and unbridled cruelty / brawlig pivishly in all
sharpnes of punisments. And here by we judge that god has no more care / nor
regard to defend and keep us in savetie.

And therefore we be so stirred and provoked / by our own reasons to look and
provide / for our selves / as though the whole hope of gods help and succor
were clean taken away. But on the other part / the so great providence of god
/ as he has showed unto us / ought to be unto us like a strong fenced castle
/ which can be over come^ with no power. Let us therefore learn and hold fast /
this short sentence / yt our bodies ar in his hand and power / who also did
creat them. And this is ye cause / wherefore god has delivered his / after a
merveilouse sort / and contrary the opinion and hope of al men / as Sydrach /
Misach / and Abdenago / forth of ye burning oven / Daniel, out of the lions
den / peter out of Herod's prison / where in he was shot and watched most
diligently fast bonnd in chains. By these examples he would declare unto us / yt
he could stay our enemies as it were with a certain bridle / and that he had
that power that when he would / he could preserve and as it were pluk us out of
the mouth of death it self. Not that he does always thus deliver his from soch
perils / but of right having the authority to apoint our life and death / he
will have us persuaded / that we are so continued and kept under his custody
and tuition / that what so ever the tyraunts do invent / or with what fury so
ever they set upon us / yet it is only in his hand to apoint life (...) death:
and therefore this matter ought only to be refferred to his will. But if he suffer
ye tyraunts to kill us / yet our life is unto him dear and much more set by
of him then it is worthy. Psalm. c. xvj.
The which he did plainly declare to be so when he pronounced by the mouth of
David / that the death of his saints was honorable and preciouse in his sight.
xxvj. cap.
And also when he said by Esaias / yt the earth it self should show forth the
blood that was shedd which seems al to gether hidden. Now then let the
enemies of the gospel be as bountiful and prodigal in shedding the martyrs
blood / as they will / yet this must be / that they shall make a reckening and
horrible account of the effusion of that dear and preciouse blood / yea even to
the vttremost drop. But now / in this time they do scornfully and prowdly
laugh / when they burn the faithful men / and after they have dypte and
washed the^ selves in their blood / they be come so dronken / that they care
nothing at al / what murders they do. But if we will have this stay and
moderation of mind / that we can pacie^tly abide / god will at the last declare
/ that it was not without a cause that he so greatly esteemed our life / and had
it in so great honor. In the mean while let us not take it to grefe / if it be
now bestowed to confirm and garnish the gospel / which excels heven and
earth in worthiness. And yt we may be mor surely persuaded that god will never
leave us as abiects in the hands of the enemies / let us not forget that same
saing of Jesus Christ / wherein he says / that it is he him self whom men do
persequut in his members. Act. ix.
God had said before by Zacharye / who so towcheth you towcheth the sight of
mine eye. Zach. ij.
This is much more expressed / if we suffer for the gospel sake / it is eve^ as
the son of god hi^ self were and suffered in yt affliction. Therefore let us
think so yt Jesus Christ must forget hi^ self / if he should have no care and
thought of us at yt time when we be in prison and danger of life for his cause
and glory: and let us also know that god will take all the co^ tumelies and
injuries / as done against his own son. Let us come to the second place of
co^solatio^ / with is one of the greatest among gods promises: that is / that god
will so hold us up with the virtue of his spirit in these afflictions / that our
enemies what so ever they do / nor satan yeir chief captain shall in any
thing go away with the over hand. And truly we do see how in that necessity /
he does show the succor and helps of his grace. For the invi^cible stowtnes
and co^sta^cye of mind with is seen in the true martyrs / is a notable token of
that same most mighty power with god uses in his saints. There be two things in
persequutions grevous / tediouse and intolerable to the flesh whereof the one
consists in the cheks and rebukes of men / the other in the pain and torment
of the body. In both these kinds oftemtations god does promise so his
assistaunce that we shall easily over come all the i^famie and violence of the
grefs and pain. And truly what he promises he does perform in deed with most
manifest and assured help. Let us then take this bucklere to defend us against
all fear / and let us not measure the power of gods spirit so sclendrely / that
we should not think and beleve / that he will easily overcome all the injuries
/ bittrenes / and contumelies of menn. And of this divine and invincible
operation / among all other we have a notable example in this our age. A
certain young man / who lived godlylye here with us in this city / when he was
taken at Dornick was condemned with this sentence / yt yfhe would deny the
confession of his faith / he should be but beheaded / but yfhe persevered in his
purposed opinion / he should be burned. When he was asked whether he would do /
he a^swered plai^ly / he who will geve me this grace to dye papatiently for his
name / will also work by ye self same grace / that j may abide broyli^g and
burning. We ought to take this sentence not as pronounced of a mortal man /
but of the holy ghost / that we should think / that god can so well confirm /
and make us over come al pains and torments / as to move us to take any other
kind of meaker death in good part. Yea we see also often times / what
constancye he geveth to evel and wickedmen / who suffer for their evel deades
and wickedness. I do not speak of soch as be obstinat and hardened i^ their
wickedness with have no repentance / but of them which do perceave consolation by
the grace of Jesus Christ / and so do take and suffer quietly and with good
will most grevouse and sharp pain: as we see a notable example in that thief
who turned at the death of our lord Jesus Christ. Will god who assisteth with
so great power wicked men ye suffer condingly for their evell acts / forsake
the^ who defend his cause / and will he not rather geve them invincible power?
The third place of promises / which god promises to his martyrs / is the
fruit which they ought to look for of their sufferi^g and of death it self /
yfnede so requier. But this fruit is / that after they have set forth and
honored gods name / and edified his church with their testimony / they may be
gathered to gether in immortal glory with the lord Jesus: But be cause we have
spoken largely jnough before of this reward of eternal glory / it is now
sufficient / to renew the memory of those things ye ar all ready spoken.
Wherefore let the faithful learn to rear up their head to the crown of
immortal glory / where unto god does call them / let them not take the loss
of this life grevously / co^sideri^g the greatness / and worthiness of the
reward. And that they may besure and perfectly persuaded of this so great a
good thing / as can not be expressed with any speech / nor in thought be
comprehended / nor with any honor jnough esteemed / let them have continually
before their eyes this like and conformable reason with our lord Jesus Christ
that in death it self they behold life / as he by ignominy of the cross and
infamy came to gloriouse resurrection / wherein all our felicity / trivmph and
joye consists.

Amen.
