To the most resolute and valiant minded Captain James Lancaster all increase
of valor with your most worthy hearts desire and prosperous success in all
your Attempts.
IT has been [right] worthy Captain, their custom in elder times amongst
some foreign nations which held honor in regard by all signs and shows of
toy to welcome home such Adventurers that for their Countries honor and Princes
benefit had any way adventured, not only doing them all the public honor
they could, but invested them with titles of all honor, (such Customs) albeit
among the vulgar sort, it be deuyed, yet doubtless those good minds which
honor arms, and their Country adventures, attribute unto them honorable
praise as they deserve.

Amongst many other (valorious Captain) that honor your worthy deeds desirous
to register your noble actions amongst the best deserving, as they woorthily
merit, though my slender skill be not such as may deserve to register so
notable and worthy exploite by you performed: yet have I boldly attempted to
set down the same, that our Countrymen specially such as stand upon terms
of being what they are not, envying the virtues and well deserving. Aduenturer
might blush to behold what you have performed, through Gods sufferance and
your politik and most valiant resolution: whilst they lie sweating one their
easy beds, of which I humblye crave pardon who intends well unto all men but
especial bend my devotion, unto such skillful adventures at sea, for that my
profession is such, who am, and ever will be ready in all true zealous affection
and do you all the best service I can or may, when and where it shall stand
with your good pleasure for to command me.

Your devoted vvellvv^iller. H. R.

Record may we his worthiness*

And you that saw the wealth he brought,

If London-mercha^nts dare to do,
such actions as he did*
Then why should not then acts be told,
why should his fame be hid.
Amongst the chiefest Cauilers,

THE most honorable Attempts and fortunate success of our worthy Citizen and
brave minded General Iemes Lancaster, and his Associates,
THAT a Prophet is not esteemed in his own Country, it has been often said,
and not so commonly said, but true said: as is mani^est in our ungrateful
Cuntreymen which hold Honors Champions in account longer then the present
occasion of use serves for them.

Which makes us so common a by word amongst other Nations for our
vngratefullnes: If we could as well imitate in good actions such noble
Strangers as have lived in elder time as follow, their vanities and manners in
all vicieus exercises, we might well be noted for the most only people of the
whole earth: Then might that most excellent Histories which now declare the
noble and bountiful minds of the Romans be shut up, and our Histories fill
the ears of all Nations with reports of our now living and brave minded
adventures, but those times be past, such men live not to recompense their
worthiness nor those of learning to give them their due.

If Room the abject of earth now for her vice, has been fur^shed with such
noble Citizens that gained both for their valor and bounty such eternal
p^arses, not ^nly for hazarding in many perrills their goods, but their own
persons, arming at nothing but honor: esteeming the goods gotten as things
transitory.

Why should not our thri^e famous City of London the only wounder of the
earth for beauty, government and wealth, hold their honor in like account?

The Romans exalted all men of worth for their virtues not regarding their
parentage, making the ig-noble and base horn tribunes Senators and Vice-rois
in their territories, h^^^ring them with all titles of nobility and honor,
and after their victoryes, caused them in tryu^phs, to ride throughout their
Cities erecting Trophies, in memory of their actions. Thorough which, they
encouraged the noble minded, and moved the most basest groom to adventure.

If such were the manners and conditions, of our minded cuntrymen how
flourishing an estate might we boast of: But we, forgetting virtue, esteem
wealth, not valor, (not men) before money, but money far before men:

Yet are there some of worship, Patrones of this famous and most renowned
City, who esteeming their Cuntries benifit, have by their great charge,
enriched the Common-welth: And ofther carfull love to their cuntry, enlarge^
the Navy of our Land, by their most bountiful exspences, so that thorough a
number of worshipful Citizens, our eneimies are weakened, our streingth
increased, our eneimies empouerished, and our Land enriched, all for our
cuntryes honor, where at they aim as is daily s^^e by the great adventures
they make.

And I could recite, but time causes me to admit them, and their worshipes
names in this place, not doubling but in time, some of good learning for honor
of our Land* will register their names to eternal honor, unto such I commend
them, to recou^t unto you, this latest and most rare exploit of a most resolute
and brave Gentleman a Citizen of this most famous City upon our enemies the
spaniards* wherein as he got fame by this most resolute and brave attempt,
purchasing there by his cuntries honor and benifit of our commonweal, and that
his virtues being a Citizen of this famous City of London though by birth
of gentillity might not be ob^cured, I have set down his proceedings in this
action, that our brave minded youths in time to come seeing what has has
bendone, by men of our time, may (...) to the virtues and end^^oring to deserve
like him, honor in his ^^ntry, and remain a terror to all enymies.

In September now last past 1594 these worshipful, grave Cityzens, and fathers
of ^^London^^, and most faithful subjects to our Prince, and Country, the
woorshipfull, John Wats, Alderman, master Paul Baning Alderman, master Suit
Salter, master Boreman and others of woorship in this most famous City,
desirous for their Cuntries honor and benefit to employ their substance,
victuled and equiped for all needful things is so hard and dangerous a voyage
appertaining three good Ships, videl, the Consent of the burden of 240. tons
or there about the Solomon of 170. tons or there about, and the Virgin 60,
tons or there abouts, appointing for Commanders in this voyage James
Lancaster of London Gentleman, General of the Fleet, Mun Barker of London
Viz-Admirall, and John Awdley of Popler near London their Reare-Admirall,
having in their company John Wats the Son of Alderman Wats a proper and
forward Gentleman full of resolution. And Simon Boreman son of M. Boreman
Owner of the Solomon, a toward and likely youth.

These forenamed ships fully equipped and furnished with all needful
provision most royally, departed from Blackwallrood near London, in October
last past, keeping our own Coast close abourd, where they met with foul
weather, such gusts and storms that the Solomon spending her Mast not far from
Darkmouth; they put into harbor and by the care and earnest industry of the
General and other having charge were shortly again provided, which done, the
careful General loath to make longer stay then was needful having a pleasing
gale for their purpose: put from Darckmouth the last of November following,
applying as wind served for their desired place.

But contrary to our expect, (as God by many favors tries his heople) not
fifty leauges from our own Coast we lost the Solomon and the Virgin, yet
being alone, in hope to meet them about graund Canaries or capeblanck we kept
our course for the place, and as God sent us favorable winds plied until we
came to the Canaries, but could hear no tydinges of our Consorts, which
greatly cumbred us: Thence went we bearing for Timreef, where in the moruing
early we had sight of a sail who being becalm^d under the shore, was towing
with their boat a head, having one other at her stearne, for this sail we
mande our boat apointing our men well for fight if need should serve them,
but the cowardly Portugales seeing our boat come, entered theirs, and leaving
the ship sought to save themselves by flight, but our men being full of
courage, hartned on with the brave imb^ld^ing speech of our General, and in
hope of some better good by getting the men, pursued them so fast and with such
e^ar desire, that they bourded them and brought them with their ship to our
General.

This was laden with Canarie wine, which came not unto us before it was well,
(and better welcome.)

This ship we maned and kept, plying that day and the next night there
abouts, the very next morning we had sight ^ one other, but not so much worth
as the first was, which had eighty tons of wine the other but forty.

To her in like manner we sent our Boat, but their Gunner being ^ drunken
Flemming standding on his terms, made a shot at her, and shot a propper
yo^ngmans arm, it we enforced them to strike, and to take that part their
Counreymen did.

A lamentable tale it were to discover the pittiefull looks of the poor
Portugales, who trusting to our Lady ha^ no hope of her son for comfort Well,
weeing possessed with this good liquor, a substance which must unite the life,
(praised God for it) and that other good releif we found amongst them being
therewith well refresh^d.

The Portugales h^uing their free passage, and an acquittance for deliue^^e of
their wines* were all set a shore, on Tene reefe making a quick return o^
their long voyage, who were bound for Margareta, in the Indies.

The men having their disharge, and all things out that might ^o^ us a^y good,
we left ye place plying for Cape-blanck: but before we come thither, we met
again with the Virgin there are Admyrall, who haling us told us for very
truth the Solomon was gonne for England, enforced so to do by spending her
m^^t, which we found contrary, for coming to Capeblanck we met the Solomon
who had fished with the Can^^ookes the best ^ish and other commodities he
found in ryfling twenty four ships and Caruels.

Of this good company we were all joyful, and had great hope of the blessing
of God in performance of our intended voyage, and so after some parle and
making frolic for ioy^ of our meeting* one with the other praising God f^r
all, we plied for Mayeo, where coming to ancor, our General and the r^st of
the Cap^anes went a shore to vein the place where we might in best safety set
our gallie together, which frame we brought from England* of purpose to land
men in the Country.

Here we discharged our great pryze of wine and set her on fire, but before
our coming thither, you shall understand we had sight of four sails which
was Captain Venard in his shi^pe the P^^v^^i^e* and a proper ^iskane which he
took at Capeblanck, the Welcome of Plimmought and her Pynnes, all which stood
with us. But they seeing our flagges expecting such good fellows as we, did
bear from us all the might, which our people took very unkindly that being
all friends they would neither enquire, nor tell us any news of our friends
but without making any show of kindness so to depart.

From Capeblanck we took likewise with us three ships viz. one dainty
Caruell and one Canter, with one other Bark for to serve us in the Country
drawing little water for diverse purposes.

As before I have said, the choice being made for the place to build the
Gallie, a shore it was brought, where the carpenters did their true intents,
and faithfully applied their work* still cheered unto it by the generals good
gifts bestowed amongst them, and kind usage of all the rest commanders, not
with out great care of the Captain for the saftie of them all by keeping good
watch, yet one negligent fellow which had no knowledge of the Cuntry straing
from his company, was by the Mooers taken, and very kindly used, and brought
a gain unto us, for which good, the general rewarded them well with gifts
very acceptabell* which they took as kindly.

While we were thus busily employed about the fores^yd gallie we descry^d at
sea 4 sails, which we had good hope would have proved Indies men or some to
have brought us what we looked for* but they proved, Captain Venard with his
fleet as a foresaid, who seei^g us at ancor came in unto us, a^cored also,
where spending some time, and being acquainted with ^ur Generals
determination, for la^ding consorted with us, and their b^lis according, to the
manner of the sea were made, and signed, of other part, whereby our strength
was increased to all our comforts, three weeks or there abouts we stayed in
this place, before the Gally was finished which done putting men into her, and
fitting her with ores, having 14 banks on a side, a maste and sail, the
commaundment of her was committed unto master Wats an honest skillful maryner.

From thence we put again to sea and hope of like success, and went for the
I Will Dett Brauo where we watered, which done we made no long stay after, but
bent our course as derectly as we could for the place, but before we came
thither we lost our Caruell and one of the other pryses, our own ships being
all well and in good saftie, which thanks to god, the comfort of all that
build faithfully upon him, by whose sufferance we recovered the place, making
our first fall with the land to the southward of Cape Augustine from whence we
applied still to our de^^red Port of Farnand Bucke, and did so much, that about
midnight, we came before the harbor where some plied up and down, holding that
the best policy, to forbear the entering till day might give them light, the
harbought being hard and therefore the more perilous.

Our Ships being in saftie well arrived, God was praised, and the General in
his boat went from ship to ship, willing them to make ready such men as they
could spare, with muskets, pykes bylles, bows, arrows and what weapons they
had to follow him: Him self, with fourscore men from his own ship,
embarked him self in the Gallie which carried in her prowe a good Sacare.

The Inhabitaunts which saw so much shipping, dreading what did follow, were
gathered together by estimatien to the number of 1000 men and from their
platform being oppisite with the harboughts mouth well planted with Cannon
periall and Sacars of brass plied upon us with them, our ships ryding within
Sacar-shot in the very face of them, yet did they not hurt any ship but our
Gunners borrowed little of them, but paid them well whatsoever they sent
amongst us* and with such sound payment, that two shot from the Admyrall by
Gods help and the Gunners good industry, beat their wateh-house about their
^ares.

This beginning made the faint hearted swades to quail that their hearts were in
counsel with there heels, which should be the best member, in the end by
general consent, they agreed* to see a littell more, entreating their heels
to be ready to make shifte for them.

But our General otherwise employed his men being shipped rowed to the shore,
all the night appointed with his companies, and encouraging his m^n in the very
face of the Platform and mouth of their Ordinance landed, leaping to the
waste in water, in the breach of the shore, his men following him leaving
their Gallye which beat so on the shore as she did little other service, a
notable policy of the General, if he had been matched with cowards*, which
the General little regarded making that a trial, and encouraging his men,
cried still Saint George brave gallants this is our own.

The white liuored Crauius as they be proud cowardes not respecting the
advantage they had of our people being so wette, which ^asely they might have
foiled, like harmless honestme^ trusting to their old freindly heels their
chiefest comfort, leaving the General in possesion of all, saved themselves
some in boats, which lay ready at the back side the house, others for the best
prize, made our men Judges who was the best footmen, flying so fast as a hare
from the egar greygound having not so much kindenes to bid them welcome, nor
honesty to bid them farewell, the day of our arrival was their Good-Fryday,
when by custom they usual whippe them selves, but God sent us now for a
general scourge for them all, whereby that labor amongst them might be well
spared, for small leisure they had to do that ^opperie.

The General waued the ships willing them to way and to come in, which they
did with all speed, himself taking order with his Associates of what they had
in possession, and turning the Ordinance bent them that way they expected any
anoyance from the towneward, made choice of a place convenient for to build a
baracad^, which strongly they fortified, brought the Ordinance from the Fort
and placed them in theirs, what they could best use, the rest they sent a
bourd, their ships keeping good and careful watch: Now it is to be
remembered, that in this (...) they ^ound three great Hulcks which came thither
^^ in Syaine to being those goods home which was there left, now two reares
since, by a Ca^^ck which was cast away.

Our General having in possession the Town with all the goods in the
Storehouses, sent for the Flemings and demanded what they did there: they
answered for these goods they came sent from Spain by the honors for them, and
so after some words between them agreed for their fraught home to England
unto which they yielded.

When these things were thus to our comfort accomplished, the General thought
it small policy to make longer stay, then was needful, and therefore took
order from every ship one to woork, ye other to watch for their security.
The first service was done, we vnladed our wine prize giving to every ship
equal portions, then making ready every ships hold, they brake the prize
making it to serve for a Lighter to lade and with her the Welcomes Pynnace for
the more expedition in their lading, so earnestly applying them selves as no
oportuniti was lost in porfourmance thereof, our wlling minds holding it no
trouble: watching by night, nor hard labor by day: but so vigilaunt they were
in all there actions as was requisite they should in so perilous a place,
otherwise, they had enjoyed their good fortunes but a small time, such was the
policy of those base roges, who in ye night at one time fyred i^. Caruills
apollic^e to their cost learned in England, but performed like them selves,
for the Caruills with the fire taking like harmless boats a quite contrary
way ran a shore consuming them selves without any anioyance to our ships as
they intended they should have done.

This device sorting to no better effect, they made rafts with old masts and
grapling them together and planting them full of light wood heath and such,
fired them and sent them amongst our ships, for this devise our General
ordained from every ship two boats to be ready a head each ship having in
each one of them a graplet to throw on the rafts which sunck them all and never
had an a^uantage to do us harm, these devises qualing by sea, every night
they gave us bra^ad^^^, one the shore bringing some few naked men with vows
and arrows before our scence, which shot often without doing ha^^^e, all
which was to draw us within compass of their ambushment, which they had laid
in hope we should have pursued them flying but our Generals and Captains had
more foresight then to venture them selves and us against naked wretches

When they law that all their devise was by policy frustrate thinking we
would be careless of their doing they began in the night to build a new
Forte in such a place as would have greatly annoyed us if they had gone forward
with it: But our General having intelligence of the same by some of the cuntry
people, would not seem unto them any way discontent but secretly in the
evening quietly gathering his companies issued upon them, put them from their
work, took four pieces of brass Ordinance and s^aying threescore of their
men put the the rest unto flight and returned with loss of one man, bringing
with him to our forte their Ordinance which they intended should have done us
the mischief, this their devises sorting to such ill success, ever pretending,
but never accomplishing any thing that ever did hurt us, our men with such care
employed them selves as was joyful to see them.

In this painful travel of fours we had sight o^a small man of war of Deep
in France who had pl^ed up and down two months yet durst not put in until
they had sight of Saint George which continually we bare in our tops, this
little Frenchman coming in saluted our Admyrall as he could after the sea
manner, and hoysing his boat came abourd to our General acquainting him with
his extremity wanting victuals, who like him self, py^tying his distress and
waying the want him self had endured in his last long voyage, with that noble
Gentleman Captain Raymond gave him wine, bread, pease and such victuals as he
had to their great releef.

This Frenchman reported that he not long before met with Captain Abraham Cock
who being distressed for water he re^eiued with one hogshed having but two in
all, and brought him to a p^ace where they both watered. Not long after his
arryuall, we had sight of three sails more which we hoped had been India
men, but proved Frenchmen. The Generell of this Fleet was that same which
brought our* General from Mona, after the loss of his ship, to our General
was heartily welcome as was most manifest by the entertainment he gave both him
and his whole complanie wherein showing him self a most brave and grateful
Gentleman far unlike such shauing people which never think of freindship
longer then they reap commodity, catch by all means they can, from such as
carry gentle and willing minds to deserve well to do good unto them that
seek their favor. Such vnt^^^kfull wretches I have oftentimes seen to beg
for releif w^ere their piteous moanes have been scorned.

But to out matter the General in this time being possessed with such welthie
commodities ^s he could not tell where to bestow after he had fraughted his
own three men of war, three flemish hulcks of great burden, three western
ships viz. the Perygrine the Welcome and their prize with two spaniards which
he found in the road gave franckly unto his good friend the Captain what he
would take of all such commodities as they had, which was clones, mace* pepper,
Sinemon and Calocowcloth Sugar and braffellwood whereof they had such store that
every night during the keeping their forte a shore they burnt by estimation
above two tons. With these commodities the french man lading his three
ships and the Deep man one, and yet the General to show his further
thankfulness unto him, gave him freely one other ship which came into the
harbought full laden with Negers and other c^mmodities, of which he took his
pleasure, this favor the frenchman took in very thankful manner, and wtih
diligence had purueyed to be gone with the Fleet, who being near ready to lean
the harbought, intelligence was given them by some of the country people that
ye Governor had provided for making a new sort, opposite of the mouth of the
harbourt, where perrilles were most incident, and where men should he most
busied in doing their labor to keep them from the danger of the bar, which
tidings nothing plesed him nor any of his company, wherefore sommoning the
chief of each ship, upon conference had of the dangers so bad a guest might
there breed being there planted it was concluded to make such power as they
could and to drive them from their labor, so to raze their fortification, this
being with advise platted and a general likeing of the devise, care was
likewise taken for perfourming the same, and every thing for the purpose
accordingly fitt^ed: which done, the General that had been often by flags of
truce sommoned to parle with their Governor, which continually he refused,
scorning to have familiarity with any his Princes enemies, as well to avoid
suspect of evil tounges as for his own reputation, was for this cause enuyed
of the General the more, which doubtless would gladly have been better
acquainted with him if possibly he might, and for the better bringing his
deuilish practices to effect, he first began this new fortification, which he
imagined our General would not endure, nor suffer him to perform, but
woorking by policy, he ambusht his people seeking thereby his overthrow, whom
God defended in dispight of what he could or might do, as the sequel shall
manifest, for he whose hope was neither in pope, saint or help of men,
determining as you have heard to effect this new resolved work, ranged his
companies and in most warlick and brave manner like a conqueror marched on to
their forte, where with such courage he assailed the defendants as made them
believe there should few escape, which made them play their old parts, and
trusting to their best friends, their nymble heels tournned their backs and
departed: Whose dastardly minds our men disdaining with eger pursuit followed
spoiling many, but they that thought on no manhood but policy, con^aide them
selves into a wood, closly followed of our people, into which, they were no
sooner entered, but in fight of our people was placed xvij. Ensigns that made
on toward them, and looking behind them they were backed with so many besides
those runawaies in the wood. This sight caused our people to stand and better
to consider for their safties what to do, who knowing that delay bread
dangers desirous to show their resolution in maintaining that honor which most
valia^tly they had already obtained, rather were desirous to adventure their
good fortunes with the swoorde, then to loose what they had so honorably
gained: subiecting them selves unto so mercelesse enemies.

And heeron resolving like Englishmen, who was as yet never known to forsake
the seildes where ten has been to one the enemy approaching one both sides,
there was no remedy but to look to them selves: which our General and his
valiant associates seeing, placing their companies as they could best one such
a sudden, both for defending them selves and annoying the enemy like men no
whit discomforted, beholding their huge numbers which were of horse and foot,
spaniardes and the Country people 5000 bravely and with great courage began the
assault applying their small shot so long as their poulder lasted, which
fiinshed throwing from them their shot betook him to their hand weapons with
which they did such wundrous spoil as the spaniards persuaded them that they
fought not against men, but some of a more horish condition.

A sore and cruel battle was there beer begone, and continued with so few to
such a multitude as seldom has been seen in the enemies country, whose
valiant hearts were never dared, nor for no extremity, although through their
hot and earnest labor in such a broyle and in a country so contagious, many
were distressed for want of drink, yet minded they what they had in hand more
then their bellies, playing the parts of men, and brave Englishmen defending
and annoying the enemy with such courage that the enemies wundred thereat,
evermore cheering them selves, and the General chearing all, crying out to the
terreur of the enemy Saint George, God for S. George Englands defense.

But in this glory when their hopes were such to escape all dangers, thorough
the mighty hand of our God which caused so many to fall before Sampson with
the iaw bone: behold a marvelous terror unto our men. The French Captain our
Generals great* Amico, leading threescore of his Cuntreymen was stain, at
whose fall his ^ollowers being discomforted began to fly, showing theirin
right parts of them selves: which our men perceiving, and knowing no cause,
made shift for them selves, as these cowards did, and recovered their botes and
their ships in good safety, backed from the raging pursuit of the enemy by
our ships.

In this conflict al^o was slain Captain Barker, Captain Cotton two most
brave and reso^ute Gentlemen and much lamented. (...) finished, (...) that
could (...), our General thought that he had done most honorably, and
generally the whole company, bewayling the loss of his good friend the french
gentleman slain, cried out of cowardice of th^se baser grooms his followers,
persuading him self that if they had stood with them the honor of this comrie
had been theirs, so great was all their hopes in his mercy, that in so many
perrils since they came from their own cuntry had so mightily preserved them.
Then labored our men to cloy that Ordinance we left in our Forte, which we
cam^ full of spykes, stones and other trumperle making them vnseruisable.

The General seeing what was done, and that there was no means to withstand
so great a multitude least armed with foolish hardines he should end ^^^ger the
honor he had gained, (then which) he rather would choose to dye, seeing it
would be hot abiding there, the enemy planting so near him commanded the
whole Fleet to make ready, bring their ancours abourd and upon the first of the
ebb to go out, which with such expedition was done, that their was no show of
any idle hands.

At this push, behold one other most marvelous favor of God toward us, the
winds which long before blew great and vehemently into the harbought mouth,
had altered her place and fitted our turns so that being ready to set sail we
had a fair top sale gale which carried us clear off the harbought and the
bar, without receiving any damage from the enemy, which shot franckly at us
a long time never hitting any one hull, but one, of our Flemings a great hulck
which was as fair a marck as a Church which wind lasted not long, nor found
we the like, in seven weeks after: thus being delivered from the hands of our
enemies having in our companies of english, french and dutch the number of
fifteen sails laden all deep with their commodities: The General commanded
the whole Fleet to beat for Peren-Iew where he determined to water and to take
such other provision as we could there get, sending the little Frenchman of
Deep which sailed well to purchase what he could for us, with this place we
fell about the midst of night, our General coming to ancour in the offine, put
out his lights that they might be thereby advertised what to do not
notwithstanding some put into ^^^ ha^ bought others ouershotte it, and we in
the Admyrall ryding a soute and most better rough, were feign to shift for our
selves, and put into the sea, where we lost our Fleet and never met them after
until our aryu^ll in ye downs, where it was said unto one General, to his
and all our comforts, that the Solomon with one ^sh hulck was come unto London,
The Peryg^ine the Welcome with their pynace and one other hulck laden were at
Plimmouth, and one of the spanish ships which we laded for our own use
arrived at Breast in Britain, the other by mischance coming foul of another
ship was broken down to the water which our men left in the sea, the
frenchmen with thou five ships are as we hear all arrived in safety* our
ship with the Virgin and one other hulck being the last that came home,
whose long stay made our freindes greatly to doubt of our well doings. But
praise to his ho^^e name that bath so preserved us all, and sent us with such
happy fortune amongst our friends with no great loss, though some we had,
amongst which, that ost their lives and most lamented was Captain Venard whom
we buried royally in the cuntry, the other our Master Chiurgion Randall Starkey
a man of singul^^ ^^ll and as good government as may be required, who of the
disease called the ^^u^ dyed and was there buried, and almost all our
Chiurgions* one only excepted, of whose help God be glorified, we had little
noode, until our arrival in the downs, where a most sore and greenous
misc^^nce befell us, through the ne^ligence of our master Gunner, whose
careless doings made us all full hea^^e, after a most trouble^ome and hard
adventures to be at our own doors when every man made ^^co^ing to sollace him
with his freindes, then by such a casual hap to be spoiled as we were, for the
Gunnor him self was slain with two others, and twenty others gre^^sl^^y h^^t.

A worthy ^^rour for all men of government taking charge, how so carelessely
they demaine them selves, looking with more care unto the charge unto them
committed, especially such as have the command of poulder and such like
substance which is not to be ^ested withal, the proof thereof has been to
often soon, to the great damage of the woorshipfull Owners. God g^ ^his may be
the la^^*

But especially Captain Randolph Cotton whose courage in midst of all broils
never quailed: this brave and worthy minded Gentleman albeit he had end^rde
most hard and ^r^^l crosses in his last adventure to the sea, accompaning that
most renew^ed and forward Gentleman Thomas Candish Esquire, who held him for
his virtues in great account: The remembrance of whose death; with gree^ he
often times bewailed, and the many cares and troubles of that most unfortunate
voyage not yet exiled out of his mind, deffrous to make once again trial of
his fortunes: arming his never conquered mind for the same, reseluing ^ther to
gain fame which before wealth he pryzed, not like those penny fathers which care
not who loose so they gain, expecting but opportunity and such company, as
he wished, rested so, until our Generals arrival at Darckmouth where he
made his abode, with whom having conference, and knowing his pretended voyage
was for these confines of Fernand Bucke, and that his determination was to
land, thought this a time fitting his mind, wherefore without any desire to see
his best friends, kynne or allies, which commonly draw men from many attemptes,
he not only adventured his money in the action but his body, with whose good
company the General was well pleased, and all the rest of his compeeres,
having great hope of his valor* which not only showed in his manly countenance,
but specially induced there unto by the rare reports of his forward attempts in
many other actions where he had charge as well by sea as by land.

An instance of which was manifested by those that acccompaned that most rare
and famous Captain and Nauigator John Va^es, whereby his good counsel in
times of extremities, and valiant courage in all times of service, he gained by
courtesy the sole love and general likeing of all the company.

All which good parts conioyning in this worth Gentleman, moved the General
with consent of his friends and compheres, to elect him for their principal
leader for their land service as one whose skil^ and most worthy resolution
they wholely under God re^yed upon* which was every way answerable to what
they expected, so that therein they were not deceived at all, as his ge^at care
in perfourming that charge was unto him committed did manifest,

For what many men accounted great pain and most troublesome labor he held
and esteemed as mere pleasure, such diligent care he had in keeping on shore,
such vigilaunt watch and ward both for his companies securite as his own, as
was necessary and most convenient to be used in a place of such danger.

Besides his hard labor in buylding three Baracadoes where he framed his hands
which in such labors had been usually accoustomed to toil and take pain,
whereby he might draw on others and the better to encorage them to their
business and careful industry,

Ever, and in every attemt showing both val^our and resolution in his actions
asswell seen at the supprizing of their enemies first begun forte, where
giving a most courageous onset, put them from their work and supprizing their
Ordinance, and with no small honor most valiantly brought it unto to their
Forte.

This worthy and most valiant Gentleman as he was forward to accomplish those
actions which to such valiant and resolute exploites belonged, so was he a unto
his followers as well of resolute assaults as of careful industry a spectacle
in his enterprises, never damited or receceiuing foil until the fatal time
of his death, which hononorably he received.

Thus showing him self a most woothy leader and faithful subject to his Prince
and Cimtrey, leading his companies to this venterous and rare exploite,
environed with the extremity of those base and cowardly peasants, who taking
him at a vantage was most butcherly murdered without regard either of his
virtues or valor.

But the cruel tyranny of those detestable wretches shall nor can blemish his
deserved fame nor oblivion extinguish his resolute actions, whereby he woorhyly
deserved such memory as tung or pen can or may render for requital as well of
his virtuous behavior, careful industry and resolution in all his actions,

With whom there dyed that valiant Captain Mun Barker, both which as long as
they lived so encouraged our people, that there was no fear amongst them, but
every one resolved to fight it out whose death was greatly lamented amongst us
all,

This Battle finished, and all men come abourde the ships that

Thus good Reader I have truly discoursed unto you the troubles of this our
voyage which to the glory of God and our Cuntries worthy deserved
commendations I have here explayned, that you which behold the wunders God
has done for us and our Country may with us and we with you praise him, and
heartily desire that never woorsse succes befall any of our nation* that as we
have done fight and adventure in such hassard for our Prince and Country whose
life and honor God ever maintain to the terror of all domestical enemies,
and the overthrow of all those that wish her or us ill.

A Commemoration of those worthy and valiant Gentlemen Captain Barker and
his friend Captain Cotton who in this most honorable Attempt lost their lives.
GAallants of England Marses chosen pheres,
Brave men of worth Chau^leres of Fame:
Lay arms aside, and pour forth brinish tears,
VVayling their loss whom cowarde foes has slain.
Barker brave man, the honor of thy name,
Whose hautye deeds, yet ill success in war:
In chiefest mirth does cause our tunes to jar.
And courtious Cottonne for his brave attempt,
Did well deserve a worthy Captains place
Their valiant force these spaniards proud have felt,
Which purchase fame unto their great disgrace
Pursuing foes like lions in their chase,
Fighting in right of cuntry and our Queen
Like men of worth, most resolute and stern.
In midst of broils where foes were ten to one,
Their shot being spent, a wunder it was to see:
How many spaniards, by them to death were brought,
Crying S. George, sweet England now for thee:
The warcke of spain, we have good hope to see.
This said those gallants, and even therewithal,
A luckelesse struck causde Barker dead to fall.
Whose death fearce Cottonne required so*
That many a foe, by him to hell was sent:
So showed this man of worth his force against foe,
Whose heart with rigor to revenge was bent.
But chance of war, has often wrong event,
In chiefest hope, to have a joyful day:
A cursed shot, his life has taken away.
Thus fought those men like champions of our Queen,
Having at most in all three hundred men:
Against five thousand which armd in feilde was seen,
Ranged to fight such cowardes still they benne.
Yet all their force they wayed notapyn.
But bravely then the onset on them gave,
And by their valor from their Fort them drove.
But dead they be, yea dead are both our friends,
Whose fames shall live eternized for ay:
That all may know how brave they made their ends.
Which whilst they liude in this most hardy fray,
Did scourge these curres and held them at a bay.
Whose senceles truncks though lo enterd they lie*
Their glorious souls both rest above the sky.
