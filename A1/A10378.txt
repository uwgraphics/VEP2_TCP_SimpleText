The Publisher's Advertisement to the Reader.
THis excellent Piece (model to that Heroic Work, The History of the World)
being an exquisite Abstract and Summary of all the famous Kingdoms and Empires
that ever were; how worthy it is of public view, will soon appear to a
discerning judgment. In this succinct Recollection is contrived (by a
Daedalean Author opus laudat. Ovid. de Ponto lib. 4 Eleg. 9.
Hand) the Apotelesma and effect of infinite Volumes; the Original, Progress,
and Duration of the most Glorious Monarchies and flourishing States of the
World. A Synopsis so mainly conducent and essentially necessary to the right
understanding of all Sacred and Secular Histories, as without the conduct
thereof (the like being never yet extant in English) small benefit can accrue
to ordinary Readers. To reduce such a World of Matter, into so compendious
Form, can be adiudg'd no less then an Herculean task. But of This, vulgar
Capacities are as incompetent Judges, as blind Men of Colors. This
Perspective is not fitted to the dull sight of Self-opinionate Ignaroes. To the
intelligent and judicious Peruser, if it prove a grateful work (as to such,
undoubtedly it will) the Publication may be justly reputed Operae pretium. Ave
(mi Lector) and fave huic Opellulae: cui intus Ambrosia.
