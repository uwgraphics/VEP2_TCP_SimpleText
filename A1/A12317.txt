TO THE WELL-AFFECTED AND INGENIOVS, OR NO MORE CVRIOVS THEN COURTEOUS READERS.
Fairly disposed Friends: Since the world (of Critiques) for custome-sake at
least, would take it else in scorn; it being grown so coy and squeamish, or,
good City-Dame, so much affecting, as we see, Court fashion, that with an oily
tongue she must be complemented with; otherwise in stead of courtesy nothing
but curiosity can be expected. Bowing therefore to, rather then of
singularity offering to infringe her doted-on Darlings customary proceedings,
that Momus so might have less cause to carpe and mow at what he cannot mend,
or Zoilus to bite and snarle at it, by this importunity I yield to be thus
ceremonious, Preface-wise to salute a World of (some captious and capricious,
no doubt, others more friendly) Readers; and thy self, perhaps, a more
judicious, and so less supercilious Censurer: for satisfaction to such thy
self, being somewhat here is to be said of this ensuing Treatise; let me find
favor to be borne with, in speaking these few words, more for fashion sake
then else, of that thou know before, or can not but streight-waies
collect, from the but viewing the first Pages of this present History.

History her Encomium needs not far fetching, so frequent in our mouths,
the Life, Light, and Mistress of Prudence: Life of past; Light of present;
Directresse of future actions: memorizing Monument, and Trophey of the worlds
ages and minority; Glass of Time; History so conspicuous in it self,
enueyled in the robes of Poesy, if worthily commendable, in many a famous
foreign Nations gests, I may well think it no ways disallowable in our own;
how-e're obscurity like a Cymmerian night, has ouer-clouded the infancy of
this our Island! still bearing sway with most, thereby yet proving us not
degenerate in that, from our not curious Ancestors, in conservation of
Antiquities, we quit as little, if not less industrious to observe and note
the same! when notwithstanding, with the envious Man's, and curious, our eyes
gaze on our Neighbors ground, his manners, seldom looking to our selves,
near home. We better skill the wars of Troy and Thebes, with the Pharsalian
fields, the halfe-feyned fights of Hercules, Achilles Turnus, Hector and
Aeneas, (I will not say of Amadis, Don Quixot, and such like) then as Heroike,
if not more warlike, and worthy to be renowned martial spirits of our own;
Danes, Saxons, Romans, Normans, Brittons, and other noble Captains here at
home; the great Britannicus Caesar's, Cassiuelane, Guider, Hengist, Arthur,
Egbert, Rollo, Alfred, Marcia's, Elfled's, and their equals, as truly
glorious and worthy Wights, in this our Sea-encompast little Bryttaine-World,
as ever were those halfe-deified and Pagan-sainted Heroes, of whose acts Homer
and Hesiods, the Mantuan and Theban Poets lays in that so famous and
triumphant wise resound! yet then I fear, we should not be the true, plain,
downright, shall I say, or fantastique Englishmen, if Apes, Toys, Monkeyes,
Parrots, and Baboones, or yond-sea Owls, other Country-far-fetcht and
new-fangle fashions, were not more fancy-able to our braine-sicke humors, and
plausible to our nice palats, then wiser and better objects, more profitable
and fitting matters, in staid and settled judgments, nearer concerning both our
selves and native home. Which being so, sans envy be it spoken, for correcting
our too generally corrupted judgments, in applause of any novel monstrous (I
might say Monsters) manners, as more especially strangers gugawes, and to the
present purpose, foreign stories near or far before our own; whereby the
same lie more vntrimd and trodden under foot; since, what Scholars study see
we? as nor Merchants traffic for those things, how good so-e're, that are
but seldom sought for, want vent, and are not saleable. This yet, incited me
the more to try new ways, that Novelty it self, and Nouelists fancying
fancy pleased, and others, the best at least, contented, Albion and her
Worthies might by this means, at all hands receive some, though the meanest
part of their true luster, due, ancient and deserved glory.

The aim of this discourse, the full scope of our Bryttish history, so
divided, that according to the ten great Real or apparent changes of Estate,
each several Book or Ode, from such mutation, take their subject and
beginning in historical order, and from some party of prime note,
denomination; the first treating of our first Founder Samothes and his
succession called Samothes; the second Albion, of him chief actor in the same;
the third the Giants of their rude regiment; the fourth named Brute, of his
next stablishing a Kingdom; fifth Mulmutius, of his re-vniting the distracted
Provinces; sixth Caesar, of his conquest, and the Roman Caesar's government; the
seventh entitled Hengist, of his foundation of the Saxon Heptarchy; eight
Sueno, of his, and the then rapines and oppressions of the Danes; ninth
Gulielmus, of his Norman conquest; tenth Iacobus, of him a plant of that
pacifique Olive, fortunate Peacemaker, of famous memory HENRY the seventh;
now anew also planting peace, and uniting four Kingdoms; whose other stories
on that occasion are briefly there displayed. In all which passages, what is
less lightsome, or delightsome, impute it, if not to the obscurity and
harshnesse of the matter, to his weakness, that yet was and is willing, far as
able, to give all best contentment in that kind. That Poesy should shadow
History, such (...), and pleasant study, I may hope to find out Patrons for
protection, as well as patterns, and those right ancient and worthy, for
imitation and excuse! What novel is should not for nouelty distaste; the
English Poem gloss to the stranger Idiome, that speaks perhaps such barbarous
States-matters, like our English Laws, but rude; the marginall notes serving
for illustration to them both, supplying the defects, guiding and supporting
the course of History: other Annotations, Analyzes, or Explications proposing
order, pointing at method, light and life of all discourse; as they cannot but
yield some profit, how-e're painful and laborious to me, I wish to thee as
useful and commodious, not doubting then thy well acceptance of the same! The
Title, suiting to the Treatise, (...)- Albion, or Antiqua-Albion, should seem
to promise Albions antiquities, and ancient story of our I Will! if alluding to
(...)- Olbion, as thou fauourest one, happily enjoy the other; and as a
Favorite of Albion may thou be favored in the highest Olbion; for whose
sakes I say, and wish to say,

Not censuring before thou read; not reading with preiudicate opinions of
thine own or others; and not condemning all, before thou have read all. As I
shall much expect such censure, and approve it; so shall I most respect the
Censurer! I will not be so rash or harsh to say, commend, or else comemend; yet
do conclude thus with the Poet,

This Treatise or Poem, according to the ten several great mutations and
changes of the state or name of this Island, is divided into ten Books, or
Odes, Whereof the
1. Contains, after an assertion of the story, a brief description of
Britayne and Ireland, with the first succession of Kings from Samothes
descended, A. M. 1787. till Albion, A. 2200. by the space of 400. years. 2. A
second race of Kings: Albion and Bergion, with their descent; according to the
ancient and Greek Histories, also an illustration of the present and
domestique, as well as some foreign Antiquities and Genealogies, together with
their defeat by Hercules, circa Annum 2250. 3. The Anarchy or Interregnum of
the Giants, that succeeded Albion and Hercules, from A. 2300. till Brute, A.
2850. being 500. years and upwards. 4. Brute, and his succession, Kings of
this Island, from A. 2850. till Malmutius Dunwallo, A. 3500. above 600. years.
5. Malmutius and his race Kings here, till the Romans Conquest under Julius
Caesar, which was A. 3900. about 400. years. 6. Caesar's Conquest, and the
Romans Government in Britayne, by their Presidents, and Deputy-Kings, from
Julius Casars to Valentinians days, A. 4400. near 500. years. 7. The seven

into Monarchy, by Egbert, King of West- Saxons, A. 4800. after near 400.
years. 8. The often invasions and rapines of the Danes, so continually vexing
the Land, and the Kings of England from Egberts time, till Harold and William
the Conqueror, Anno Christi 1060. near 300. years. 9. The Norman Conquest:
William the Conqueror and his issue, Kings of England: with the bloody faction
and schism between the houses of Lancaster and York, ended in Henry the
seventh, in whose issue also the Realms of England and Sotland grew united,
after 500 years from the Conquest. 10. The happy descent of King James from
Henry the seventh, whereby the union of the two Kingdoms of England is
accomplished, as under one Prince, so flourishing under one name of great
Britayne. In the end a brief touch of the Scottish, Irish, and French
Histories.
A more perfect and particular Type or Analysis of the first Book or Ode.
The first Ode contains,
1. As a Proaemium, a general deducing of History from the beginning, and
Noah: with an assertion of the story, and antiquities of this Island, compared
with those of other Nations, especially of these Neighboring and Northern
Countries.

2. A brief description, both of the Peoples and Situations of the Islands of
great Britayne and Ireland: according to the Rules (in so compendious limits)
of Chorographie, Geographie, and History.

3. The History and succession of the first race of Kings here, viz. Samothes,
A. M. 1800. his son Magus, his son Sarron, his son Druis, his son

Bright star's for heaven, heaven for earths use;
The flowery vales, the hills and woods,
Fresh Riuerets, and salt swelling floods,
Under this truth of the Creation of Heaven and Earth, the Poets would needs
inuolue great mysteries and fictions of their own, concerning Vranus or
Coelum, and Terra called Vesta, the most ancient of their Panym Gods, being
indeed in regard of their Pagan and Idolatrous worship, truly Terrae filij.

In this the truly golden Aurea aetas, The golden Age, under which term, the
Poets seem to set forth Paradise, and the happy estate of Man in his creation
and innocen^y: as under the title of the Iron Age, the fall of him at first,
with his degenerating more, to these present times.

Then Virtue fled; then Paradise
Did fade away; and in came Vice.

Like Ossa laid on Gygantes autem erant super terram in diebus illis, Genes. 6.
So in these Giants, as in the story of the Flood, the Poets seem to allude to
the history of the Bible, having perhaps read the same, as may be gathered by
Orpheus in his Hymns.

prouerib-wise, for an unfortunate possession, or an execrable and unhappy

As Church and Gods right would deface,

Or does what ere he can to tread

Many poor weeping states can tell
How ill Kings fared, where God not well;
God builds their houses that build his,
And pulls down theirs that pull down this;
Or if God should not vengeance take,
Sense shows how senseless they mistake,
With Tyrannous and Turkish might,
Or policy rather then right,
That think to rule; give leave, but mark,
Against mild Religions cause that bark,
How carnal, and on how weak grounds

And who will fear to sin, when sin

The end of the first Ode.
A brief type of the second Book or Ode of PALAE-ALBION, called ALBION.
The second Ode contains,
1. AN Apology for Poesy in general, and more expressly in respect of some
moralizing fictions, and supposed escapes in this present, or the like modern
History of our Land of great Britain.

2. An asseueration of the peopling of this Island soon after the flood, as
were the rest, by Noah, the great Belus or Saturn of Assyria, and his sons:
whose stories are compared with those ancient Panym fictions of Saturn, of
Creet, and under him the flourishing golden Age.

3. The coming in of Albion, and his descent from Neptune, the son of
Osyris, Jupiter, or Saturn of Egypt, the son of Cham, the son of Noah, who
with his brother Bergion, were Kings of this Island, Ireland, and the Orcades.

4. The overthrow of Albion and Bergion, by Hercules, the son of Jupiter,
Europs or Osyris of Egypt, who with his mother Isis came into Germany and
France, where he espoused the daughter of Lycus, King of Celts: whose issue
reigned there, and from whom the people and many of the chiefest places took
their names.

A brief type of the third Book or Ode of PALAE-ALBION, called GIGANTES.
The third Ode contains,
1. THe description of the confused Chaos of a Kingdom not well ordered: Seen
in the Anarchy or Inter-regnum of the Giants, the race or remnant of Albion,
and Samothes traynes, living disorderly like brute beasts, many hundreds of
years without any discipline of State or politic Government in their Land.

2. The coming in of Danaus daughters to these Giants, whence were descended
those monstrous Creatures, that Brute and Corynaeus found at their arrival
here; by reason whereof the stories of Belus and Danaus, with the occasion of
these Ladies coming, are briefly touched and set down.

3. The arrival of Brutus in this Island, and his adventures and travels to
Greece, and other parts of the world before he came hither: with a short
Apology, both for his and the other precedent Histories of Albion and Samothes.

CANT. I.
The Subject proposed of the present discourse, shadowing the turbulent and
confused state of a disordered kingdom, here represented in Albion.
NOw sing we the Interregnum next
Of Albion, never more perplexed,
Then now for want of Lords and laws;
Faith failing Priests, truth all men sawes;
For Albion slain, sans guide or grace,

Of whom and Danaus Daughters rise
Those monsters rude, were here, the same
Time Brute and Corinaeus came.
Thou sacred Quire that sits and sings
Amid's Parnassus pleasant springs,
Turn over the duskie leaves of fame,
And let me, pray, o'relooke the same;
That I may th'vn couth Lords repeat,
That sometimes held this floury seat.

And Irish Bergion fell, our I Will,

then,
For Tyrant Lords had she found men?
But they vnkinged, were found none,
Were fit to sit on regal Throne;
That knew what longed to Moral piety,
Much less to high and holy Deity,
Or could teach, guide, or rule; till here
Brute after many a hundred year,
Came in and found so rude a race,
As Devils seemed haunt, not men the place.
And for they were so rude a crew, Of these Giants, as no acts, but their
rudeness, so neither can Chronology be registered, saving only thus generally.

Albion slain and Hercules lived in Gaul, about, or before, An. 2300.

Brute came not till after, An. 2800. so this Interregnum continued five or
six hundred years.



From thence the fables happily grew,

The end of the third Ode.
A brief type of the fourth Book or Ode of PALAE-ALBION, called BRUTUS.
The fourth Ode contains,
1. A brief recapitulation of Brutus story, his descent and travels with the
adventures he found here, when he came into this Island: Quelling the Giants,
and establishing his Kingdom in Albion, called since Britannia or Brutania of
his own name.

2. Brutus Acts, Race, and succession of Kings here: viz. Brute, 2855. he
reigned 24. years, and divided his Kingdom among his three sons.

1. Locrine King of Loegres, or England, reigned 20. years; His wife was
Guendoline; His Paramour the beauteous Estrild. 2. Camber King of Wales or
Cambria. 3. Albanak King of Albania or Scot^and.
Madan his son, and Gwendoline, reign. 55. years. Mempritius his son,
reigned 20. years: He slew his brother Manlius. Ebranke his son, reigned
60. years: His sons conquer Germany: He builded Oxford. Brute Greene-sh^eld
his son, reigned 12. years. Lei^ his son, reigned 25 years. Lud-Rudibras
his son, reigned 29. years. Bladud his son, reigned 20. years: A
Magitian, he founded Bath. Leir his son, reigned 40. years. Expelled by his
elder Daug^ters, Gonorilla and Ragan, and their husbands; Is restored by
Cordyla his youngest Daughter whom he had rejected. Cordyla, daughter to King
Leir, reigned 5. years. Cunedagius, son to Ragan, slew his Cousin Morgan,
son of Gonorilla, and possessed the Kingdom, and reigned 33. years. Riuallo
his son, reigned 46. years. Gurgius his son, reigned 38. years. Syssylth,
Riuallo's son, reigned 49. years. Iago, Gurgius son, reigned 15. years.
K^mac^, son of Syssylth, reigned 54. years. Gronodugo or Gorbodugus, reigned
63. years: His sons Ferrex and Porrex being slain, began the Pentarc^y or
five Kingdoms in five several parts of the Land, which M^lmutius Dunwallo,
son of Clotenus Duke of Cornwall, reduced into Monarchy, after fifty years.
3. A remonstrance opposed to the erroneous retection of some supposed Errors,
by Polydore Virgill, an Italian writer, of our English Annalls: refelling some
of his errors; detecting and rectifying his vvrong co^putation of times and
calculating the K. reigns according to the same.

Also showing how unjust his and some of his Followers calumniations are, that
are made against the British and our Histories.

HENGIST and HORSVS, Brittons harms,
Their Ensigns signing both their names,
The Saxon Horse their Arms,
Brave warriors hither came.
Whose mighty stock,
Like Hydra bud,
So huge a flock
Of Saxon brood;
That Brytaine bends
To the Pagan force,
But late as friends
Called to their shores.
Kent first, her Kings,
West- Saxons then,
And Sussex sings
As Essex men:
East- Angles, and
Northumbers wild;
Last Merken-land
Great'st Kingdom stylde.
So while these reign,
Brittons race fails:
When Welsh-men feign,
Fly into Wales,
Leave Albions fair
And best parts free
To the Foe, to rear
Their Heptarchye;
Which flourisht long with fame
Till EGBERTS warre-like force
Brought all to one; and England names,
Fair speed to th'honoured Saxon Horse.

SWANVS.
The eight Ode contains,
1. The Original of the Danes, from old Dacia, by Danubius side, whose
offspring in Scandia sere vexed the Realm of England, first by Rouers, then by
the King. Iuarus in Ethelreds time, after by Hinguar and Hubba in Alfreds time,
and after, till Sweno made a conquest, though lost again by the succeeding
Kings. 2. The story of the chief Kings of England, viz. Egbert, A. 830. who
left his sons Ethelw^lf King, A. 839. he reigned 18. years. Adelstane Duke
of Kent.
Ethelbald, his son, reigned 3.

Ethelbert, his brother, reign. 5.

Ethelred, his brother, reign. 7.

Alfred, his brother, R. 29. he had great war with the Danes, and made Oxford
an University.

Edmond, his brother, R. 5. years.

Eldred, his brother, R. 9 years.

Edwine, Edmonds son, R. 4. y.

Edgar, his brother, R. 16. y. A right worthy Prince, especially in his latter
years.

Edward, his son, surnamed the Martyr, reigned three years.

Ethelred, his brother, he reigned in all 38. y. In his time Sweno got the
conquest of this land and tribute, and exiled him into Normandy.

Edmond, his son, surnamed Ironside, after the Danes were again expeld,
reigned 2. years. Canute, the son of Sweno, reigned 20 years.

Harold, his son, R. 3. years.

Hard^Knute, his brother, R 2. y.

Edward, son of Ethelred, surnamed Confessor, R. 23. years, a good Prince.

Harold, the son of ^arle God^ine, and Thyra, as some say, the after of
Canute, usurps one ear, and is dispossessed by William the Conqueror, An.
1066.


3. Certain fragments of the stories of the tributary and petty Kings of
diverse Provinces, set up, and for the most part subject to the former, viz. Of
East Angles King Offa, about the time of Ethelwolf.

King Edmond, his adopted son martyred by the Pagan Danes.

K. Guthrum, set up by the Danes, R. 12.

King Edrike, also set up by the Danes and last King of the East Angles,
reigned 14. saving that some name Turkillus or Turketillus the Dane, King of
East Angles, about Adelstanes time.


Mercians. Whitlafe, R. 15. y.

Fridulf, R. 13. y. ouerthrown by the Danes, whom Ethelwolf vanquished in Surrey.

Burthred, made King by Ethelwolf, married Ethelswide the Kings daughter, but
at last he fled from the Danes to Rome about Alfreds time.

Eldred, made King by Alfred, espoused the noble Lady Elslede, who also after
her husbands death governed the Mercians with great honor, and defended them
right nobly against the Danes: her brother King being much helped by her
martial aid and politic counsels, after whose death K. Edward took the land
of Mercians wholly the Crown.


Northumbers. Osfride and Ella rebel against Ethelred, and are slain by the
Danes, about the beginning of Alfreds reign,

Egbert, made King by the Danes, expelled by the Northumbers.

Ricsiga, King under the Danes, R. 3. years.

Egbert, a second, under the Danes, R. 7. y.

Guthred or Gormo a Dane, but God-sonne to King Alfred, reigned 11.

Sythrik, his son, reigned next, and espoused Edyth daughter to King Edward,
sister to Adelstane: but Aulafe and Godfride their sons, for moving some
sedition against Adelstane, were expelled, and fled, Aulafe into Ireland, God
fridus into Scotland; where they raised some powers, but were notwithstanding
at several times vanquished by Adelstane and Eldred. After that one Edrike did
claim the Kingdom of Northumberland: but was overcome by Eldred, about, An.
950. since when, Northumberland has only remained an Earldom or Dukedom.

Et minimus natu Alfredus, moderamine rerum

Quarti Ethelwolphi filij Alfredi Gesta florentissima.
PErfidiae interea fuso dant sanguine poenas,
Merciacique infidi, Ottadinique rebels;
Namque per id tempus Northumbria paruit Ellae,
Offridoque Anglumque iugo sua colla leuarat;
Cum ducis infoelix spensam violare Beorni,
Haud cunctatus erat Northumbricus ille Tyrannus
Osfridus; vindexque Thori laesique pudoris
Coniugis assertor, vocat in confinia Dacos,
Aspergensque odijs commissa ob crimina Reges,
Vallo ipsos Eboraci intra sua moenia cingit,
Nec vita and solio, ac spoliarat, destitit ambos:
Crimen adulterij Osfridus cum sanguine pensat,
Et pr^pe Vro-uicum locus est qui dicitur Ellae
Campus, vbicaesus cum sanguine nomina liquit.
Nacti opportunum Daci tempusque locumque, Qui vice illorum regulo^ alios

Nunc Regum ac scelus infandum quo pellere Reges
Nulli non libitum; illorum sibi Regna iugarunt;

Atque iterum a bellis sancito foedere cessit.

Tincta iugi, quantum sit onus regnare probarunt,
Vixque foret quisquam immensi per climata mundi
Cui tot in aduersis vel respirare liceret,
Nec tamen aut ferro contritus ponere ferrum
Decreuit! quanquam a Burthredo Regia Dacis,

The end of the eight Ode.
A brief type of the ninth Book or Ode of PALAE-ALBION, called GVLIELMVS.
The ninth Ode contains,
1. The Original of the Normans with their Conquest, and the great alteration
of the land under William the Conqueror, who was the son of Robert the
second Duke of Normandy, who was the son of Richard the second son of
Richard the first, son of William the first, son of Rollo the Dane, that in
King Alfreds time invaded England, and thence expeld, seated himself in
Normandy, and became Duke thereof; who receiving Christianity, was baptized
Robert, and so Robert the first, being the son of Guion a Noble man of
Denmark. 2. The Race and succession of the Normans, Kings of this Land. viz.
William the Conqueror, A. 1066. who R. 20. years.

William Rufus, his son, reigned 12. years.

Henry Beauclerke, his brother, R. 35. y.

Stephen, Grandchild to William the Conqueror by his daughter Adela, married
to the Earl of Bloys, he reigned 18. years.

Henry the second, grandchild to Henry the first by his daughter Maud the
Empress, R. 34 y.

Richard Coeur-de-Lyon, his son, R. 9 y.

John, called Without land, his brother, R. 17. y.

Henry the third, his son, R. 56. y.

Edward the first, his son, R. 34. y.

Edward the second of Carnaruon, his son, R. 19. y.

Edward the third, his son, R. 50. y. he instituted the round Table, and
first laid claim to the Crown of France.

Richard the second, his grandchild by Edward the black Pr^nce, R. 22. y.

Henry the fourth of Bolingbroke, son of John of Gaunt, fourth son of
Edward the third, R. 13. y. he began the bloody schism between the houses of
York and Lancaster.

Henry the fifth, his son, conquered France, R. 9. y.

Heney the sixth, his son, lost France, R. 50. y.

Edward the fourth, of the house of York, descended of Lionel, third son of
Edward the third: restored the house of York, and reigned 22. years.

Edward the fifth, his son, murdered ere he was crowned, reigned not one year.

Richard the third, his Uncle, usurped three years.

Henry the seventh, descended of John of Gaunt, of the house of Lancaster,
espoused Elizabeth eldest daughter of Edward the 4, of the house of York,
whereby the schism of the Houses, and Ro^es of Lancaster and York, was fully
determined, and ended, A. 1485. which had endured almost 100. years, to the
destruction of many hundred thousands.


3. The Union of the long divided and bloody schism between the Houses and
Roses of Lancaster and York (the red Rose being the cognizance of the House of
York, as the white Rose was of Lancaster) by the marriage of Henry the
seventh, with the Lady Elizabeth daughter to Edward the fourth, from whom also
sprang the Lady Margaret, whose marriage into Scotland has since produced
between those two long foesworne Kingdoms of England and Scotland, a no less
ha^py and blessed Union.

The end of the ninth Ode.
A brief Type of the tenth Book or Ode of PALAE-ALBION, called IACOBVS.
The tenth Ode contains,
1. The succession of the Kings of England, from Henry the 7. in whose issue
were united the Kingdoms of England and Scotland, viz.

Henry the 7. reigned 23. years.

Henry 8. his son, reigned 37. years.

Edward 6. his son, reigned 6. years.

Q. Mary, his sister, reigned 5. years.

Q. Elizabeth, her sister, R. 44. years.

James, the son of Mary, Q. of Scots, daughter of James 5.

K. of Scotland, (son of James the 4. and Margaret, eldest daughter of Hen. 7.)
now reigns, and Diu. V. R.

2. The descent of the Kings of Scotland from Ferguse 2. in the Romans time or
before, and so down consequently to this present age, with the original of the
Scottish Name and Nation; according to the judgment of the most approved
authors, that have written of the same.

3. The beginning and descent of both Irish and Scottish Nations, more amply
set down, with the Original of the now Irish and their several Conquests by
the English made of latter times, whereby the Kings of England came first to
be Lords, and since Kings of Ireland, as they are at this present day.

4. The descent of the Kingdom and Crown of France, to the king of England,
whereby are touched the descent of the Merouingians, kings of France, from
Pharamond; the Carlouingians, from Carolus Martellus, and Pepin: The
Capevingians or Hugonetts, (so termed for diverse respects, and partly in the
worst sense by the Guise) being the modern K. of France, from Hugh Capet; of
whose Line, Isabella the Heir, was wife to Edward the second, King of England,
in whose right Edward the third claymed, Henry the sixth wore the French Diadem.

The troublesome State of Scotland in Queen Mary's time; her Marriage with the

But say'n they, soon as Lennox fauor'd

And Mary Scot's young Queen was carried

Alas poor Nymph, as soon as borne
She Is crowned indeed, but with but thorn!
And married now, but all her joys

Soon dies her Spouse; her Sire These accidents happening near about the first

Her Mother now, and she young Prince,
In foreign shores, and scarce it is known,
Where Is Crown or Kingdom of her own:
So vexed they were with civil Wars,
So bruisde besides by strangers skarres.
As she was coming homewards, tossed
By Aeol's blasts to the English Coast,
And thence returned, domesticke crosses
She scarce regaines but with great losses,
Quenching those flames of fatal feud,
With Rivers streaming Scottish blood;
Yet soon as English Mary dies,
Too forward, seems, swaid by the Guise,
She took up the English Ensigns! France
Backs the Errors she did first advance;
Foolish France, must needs so much for strangers,

But after much their fruitless pains

Both Scot'sh and French o're-poiz'd with harms,
Both civil rew'd and foreign Arms.
So Mars fled, and Peace sweetly smilde

But shortly Henry Stewart crownde,

And she to Bothwell's Earl soon wed,

When she not daigning to be brought,
Fore her Realms Peers to answer ought,
Sans womanish fear, with threatening charms

But boots no braues, she imprisoned lies;
Bothwell, to Denmark fled, there dies.
And she from Keepers escaped prepares
Her Peers sore bale; but ill she fares,
From Scotland imprisoned, flying strife,
In England imprisoned ends her life.

Of choice wits now, as no Age, no Land more,

And such your Grace, thrice Royal pair, shall make,
Me sing your praise for loved Albions sake.

That sores above the vulgar low conceit,
Makes sure swift wing, at higher, holier things,
As Heaven, the source from whence such knowledge springs!
Yet since your Grace does sometimes please to look
On our mean Acts, as to me, to my Book,
Daigne to be Patron, and whats'ere you deem,
Your worthy censure I shall most esteem.
HONORATISSIMO DOMINO, GEORGIO, Marchioni Buckingham, aureae Periscelidis

WEnd thou thy ways dear Muse to Court, whiles I in Shepherds Weed,
Thus tune such homely Mantuan Lays on my poor Country Reed,
Or sitting on the lowly Downs, among my Syluan Swains,
Do moan my royal Mistress loss, to our sweet Arcadian Plains.
Whose daintiest Nymphs if they perhaps, shall grace thee so to make
Thee rest in Albions stateliest Towers, again, for her dear sake,
Do as those ancient Knights professed, with all respective duty
Thy best endeavors ever pressed to honor Virtue, Beauty.
I wish thee more, seek out the Man, whose Marquisate and Fame,
From Tityr's beech-tree shades renownd, derive their noble Name,
Admired of the vulgar sort, and of the Realm a Peer,
A chief flower of the Courtly train, and of his Prince held dear;
It Is he can give thee free access unto thy Kings good Grace,
Thou need'st not fear though thou so mean, and he so high of place,
Tender thy best deuoire and love; he cannot but protect
Thy suite, and goodness of thy Cause; a good Cause gains respect,
For goodness stands at Greatness gate, sole ay true glory shines,
Where Virtue free from flatteries fraud, guides, acts her blessed designs;
When after Ages all that dare boldly the truth auerre,
Proclaim them noble whose high Acts from Honors Laws not err.
So having gained thy Souereignes grace, soon all th'attending train,
Of Stars that on fair Sols Carre wait, will thee like favor daigne;
Those Stars that our Horizon sees, whom like the welkin clear,
Jove's Palace, Sols bright Zodiake holds, to glad our Hemisphere,
Their names should beautify these lines, but that these lines would blenne
Their Honors that should be descriu'd by Homers golden Pen.
Id'e hope you would pardon't yet, great Duke, allied to the House of Kings,
That Pans Pipe played, till Phoebus tuned his Lyres melodious strings.
And you both Earls, that Worsters wear, and Pembrookes ancient style,
Sydneyan Worthies, Cambrian Lords, and Leyster-graced Lysle,
Sussex, Essex, nor Oxford then, with Howards haughty Name,
And more brave spirits that there possess, place of respect and fame,
Should pass untold, save now I leave, to loftier lines this task.
And of the man first mentioned here, this Boon I humbly ask,
That as he is among his Peers possessest of chiefest place,
He Will daigne to be the means may gain, my Muse her Souereignes grace;
Who if he lending loving looks, on lowly Albion smile,
Her love and labors will not thus, leave honoring this our I Will,
But sing that sandy Seuerne-waues, Trent, Tweed, and silver Thames,
Shall loudly Echo forth her Lays, devoted to King James.

KInd Readers, were it your travels lain,
Toward Pilgrim-sainted David's shrine,
Where in an Antique sacred Cel,
Holy aged Heremits once did dwell,
There now by little Alluns side
My Master among his flocks, this tide
On Oate-reede tunes such rural Songs
To Cambrian Nymphs and Neat-heard throngs.
Sometimes he sat by silver Thames
Now rests near sandy Seuerne streams,
In valley low, where Syluan Swains
Replenish rude Meneuian Plains!
If Londay Nymphs can tell no news,
Hail Scalmey; and if they refuse,
Gresham, Ramsey, or those shreud Sea-markes,
Men call the Bishop, and his Clerks;
Pembrochian borderers, Neighbors near
To Deusland; they will direct you where!
Found tell him, pray, how by his lang
Absence, I have sustein'd much wrong;
For fearing words might breed unrest,
I for my silence have been pressed,
An so in Duresse forced aye,
To say what I would feign unsay!
Spare then sharp Censure, and supplant
These Errors, which I thus recant,
Pleading for pardon! would you please,
TO expunge, or mend such faults as these.

On whose plain song, Seld one more blessed,

My harsh tunes, notes rude Symphonie;
Thine, ancient Albions modern Glories;
Mine, modern Olbions ancient Stories;
This th 'only difference, mine is borne dying,
Thine sure on Fames wings ever flying.
Cease then my Muse, and yet disclose
A never dying Love to those,
That wish their Country well! Alhaile
Dear Olbion, may thy Fame never fail,
But be graced still, till at loves call,

That Brytaine love, would Honor nourish;
May they never fade, but ever flourish,
May be, Albion then, with Olbion may,
Ken many a fair and happy day!
Whiles Auon's clear source that hears thee sing,

Shall teach our Seuernes banks to sound,
With Echoes shrill, to the Sea-Nymph-round,
