LORD have mercy upon us. decorative border
O Death I will be thy death: O Hell I will be thy victory.

Thou shall not be afraid of the Pestilence that walks in darkness, nor
the Plague that destroys at noone day.

I have sinned, O thou Pres^ ver of men: I shall go the grave, and shall
return no more.

Watch and pray, for you know not when the Lord will come.

Preservati^ from Infection.
^ By Smell. 2. By Drink. 3. By Food.
Preservative when infected.
4. By sweating. 5. By ripening the Sore. 6. By ayring Clothes.
By Smell.
TAke white Sponge soaked in herb of grace water, which water is thus made:
Take a quart of Vinegar, half a pint of Rose Water, put in a hand-full of Rue,
and half an handful of worme-wood, and boil it to a pint: then take and dip
the Sponge in it when it is cold, and hold it to your nose when you go abroad:
and this is a good Preservative.

Aliter.
TAke of the best Cedar wood, and grate a small wooden box full, and let the
lid be full of holes, and smell to it.

By Drink.
TAke worme-wood, and herb of grace, and steep them all night in a pint of
beer, with a lemmon sliced, and drink them in the morning fasting.

By Food.
TAke a Wal-nut kernel, a corn of salt, four leaves of herb of grace; cut
all very small, and put them in a blue fig, and roast it; and fast one hour
after: but use it daily.

Aliter
TAke a toste of bread, and spread it over with Treacle and butter, and herb
of grace eaten with it is very good.

By Sweat.
TAke Endive water a quart, Century water a pint, Ivy berries half an
hand-full bruised. Boil these together gently a quarter of an hour, and when
you take it from the fire, dissolve therein as much Treacle as a Nut, and a
little Sugar, also put thereunto three spoonefuls of Vinegar. As soon as the
Patient does complain, and Nature being yet strong, give him fasting one good
draught thereof warm, and let him keep his bed, and sweat ten hours, or
less, as the strength of the Patient will bear. In his sweating give him now
and then Ale clarified, and into every draught put two or three spoone-fuls of
the decoction. When he rises, give him some broth, not made over strong,
neither with much spice: and be very careful to keep him from the air. This
decoction thus used will either force out the Sore, or else if the Patient
sweat thoroughly well, cure him without any Sore. And if thou find he be not
greatly eased within eight hours after his sweating, the next day use the like
order.

To ripen the Sore.
TAke of cloves of garlic 18. penny weight, of fresh butter 3. ounces, of
lemon the weight of a shilling, a white onion cut in pieces, a handful of
malloes, and a hand-full of scallions; boil these in a pottell of water, and
make of them a poultis, and lay to the Sore very warm. Renew it every day.

Aliter.
TAke a hot loaf newly drawn, and lay to it, but when you take it away lay a
fresh, but be sure to bury the bread after.

By Airing.
TO air a house, take Cedar or Juniper, Lavender, and dry Bays, and old
Rosemary, put them on a pan of coals in the middle of a house.

To air beds, or clothes.
TAke the same with Rose Water and Vinegar, and lay the Bed upon an hurdell, or
frame of a table, with staves to stay it up, and set two or three Chasing
dishes under: and this is an excellent receipt to air clothes.

A special means to preserve health.
FIrst, fast and pray, and then take a quart of Repentance of Ninive, and put
in two hand-fuls of Faith in the blood of Christ, with as much Hope and Charity
as you can get, and put it into the vessel of a clean Conscience: then boil
it on the fire of Love, so long till you see by the eye of Faith, the black
foame of the love of this world stink in your stomach, then scumme it off
clean with the spoone of faithful Prayers. When that is done, put in the
powder of Patience, and take the cloth of Christ's Innocence, and strain all
together in his Cup: then drink it burning hot next thy heart, and cover thee
warm with as many clothes of Amendment of life as God shall strengthen thee to
bear, that thou may sweat out all the poison of covetousness, pride,
whoredom, idolatry, usury, swearing, lying, and such like. And when thou
feel thy self altered from the forenamed vices, take the powder of
Say-well, and put it upon thy tongue: but drink thrice as much Doe-well daily.
Then take the oil of good Works, and anoint therewith thine eyes, ears,
heart, and hands, that they may be ready and nimble to minister unto the poor
members of Christ. When that is done, then in Gods name arise from sin
willingly, take up Christ's Cross boldly, stand unto it manfully, bear it
patiently, and rest thankfully, and thou shall live everlastingly, and come to
heaven safely. To which place hasten us, Lord, speedily. Amen.

The Brevity of man's Life, as well by reason of this, as all other Diseases.
LIke to the Damask Rose you see,
Or like the blossom on the Tree,
Or like the dainty flower of May,
Or like the morning to the day,
Or like the sun, or like the shade,
Or like the Gourd that Jonas had:
Even such is Man, whose thread is spun,
Drawn out, and cut, and so is done.
(...) the Blossom blasteth,
(...)
The grass withers, the tale is ended,
The Bird is flown, the Deaw's ascended,
The hour is short, the span not long,
The Swan's near death, Man's life is done.
Like to the Bubble in the Brook.
Or in a Glass much like a Look.
Or like a Shuttle in Weavers hand,
Or like a writing on the sand,
Or like a thought, or like a dream,
(...) of the stream:
(...)
Or like a race, or like a Goal,
Or like the dealing of a dole:
Even such is man, whose brittle state
Is always subject unto fare.
The Arrows shot, the flood soon spent,
The time no time, the web soon rent,
The race soon run, the Goal soon won,
The Dole soon dealt, Man's life is done.
Like to the lightning from the sky,
^ like a Post that quick does hye,
(...) short long,
^like a tourney three days long,
(...) like the show when Summer's come,
(...) like a Pear, or like a Plum:
^en such is man, who heaps up sorrow,
^es but this day, and dies to morrow.
^e lightning's past, the Post must go,
^he song is short, the journey's so,
^he Pear does rot, the Plum does fall,
^e Snow dissolves, and so must all.
Of man's resurrection.
LIke to the Seed put in Earths womb,
Or like dead Lazarus in his tomb,
Or like Tabitha being asleep,
Or Jonas-like, within the Deep,
Or like the Night or Stars by day,
Which seem to vanish clean away:
Even so this Death Man's life bereaves,
But being dead, Man death deceaves.
The Seed it springs, Lazarus stands;
Tabitha walks, and Jonas landeth:
The Night is past, the Stars remain:
So Man that dies shall live again.
Reader, I refer thee for thy better preservation, to the 4^. Prayer in the
Crumbs of comfort, being most effectual, with Remembrance of Deliberance, at
the latter end of the books: and to sing in times of heaviness Psalms ^8. and
91 etc.
