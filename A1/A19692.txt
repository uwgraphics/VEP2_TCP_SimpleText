TO THE READER.
HAving many years ago gathered and made this brief Collection of all the
principal matters contained in the New Testament, whereby I may say (I lost
not my labor) for I found it by good Experience no small help unto me; for by
it I could easily find any principal matter; Now although the chief use
thereof be for Divines and young Students, yet upon the desire of many good
Christians, which have found the like fruit and benefit, I was willing to
publish the same and make it more common; unto whom I wish, that reading over
the New Testament, they diligently observe the contents and chief matter
contained in every Chapter and Verse, and often repeat them over, and every day
to go through some Chapter or other; and the better to keep the Contents in
memory, to say over daily that which is past; whereby I have good proof, that
by this means, in short time one may readily tell what are the Contents of any
Chapter, and where any special matter is written, (which I conceive may be a
good Exercise for the trayning up of Children of ten years old and upward)
for by reading over these Contents, a man well exercised in the Scriptures, may
is one hour see the principal matters in the whole New Testament: One
special use thereof will be this* to fill the Head, and so the Heart, with
much heavenly matter, which is the best way to keep out idle thoughts. And
therefore now having my hearts desire in what I did expect, I have thought good
to publish the like on the Old Testament. For direction I need not say much,
for it is easily perceived, that the Figures at the beginning of each line,
stands for the Chapter, and the figures following the words, for the Verse.
