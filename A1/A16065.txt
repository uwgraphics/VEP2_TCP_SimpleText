Of the auctorite of the word of god against the bishop of london / wherein
are contained certain disputacyons had in the parliament house between the
bisshops a bowt the number of the sacraments and other things / very necessary
to be known / made by Alexander Alane Scot and sent to the duke of Saxon.

Math. x. Of the auctoryte of the word of god.
About.v. year agone I wrote to the noble king of scottys the father of my
contry complaining of a certain proclamacyon wherein the bisshops had forbidden
the holy scripture to be redd in the mother tongue. I answered also to certain
slaunderos lies of cochleus / whom the bisshops had hired to spewe out all the
poison in his belly against me. For I was at antwerp when a contry man of mine
whose name was John foster did send a so^me of money unto Cochleus by a merchant
from the bishop of. S. Andrews which gives him yearly so long as he lives a
certain stipend. And it cha^ced by the goodness of god / whereby he discloseth the
wickedness of these hipocytes / that a pistle of Cochleus which he sent unto a
certain bishop of pole / came unto my hands / wherein he complayneth that he
has great loss and euel fortune in setting forth of books for as much as no
man will wetesaue to read his books. And he beggeth a y^rely stipend of the
bisshops of pole saing that he has been nobly rewarded of the king of scottys
and of the archbisshop of. s. Andrews and of the bishop of glasguo. And were
it not for the love of my contry and of the kings grace I would cause his
pistle to be printed with the copy of the kings letters which he send unto a
certain bishop of pole / and because he shall know that I have a copy of the
kings letters the king does write manifestly that Cochleus book did more please
him for the co^mendacyon of King Ferdinandus and of Erasmus than for any study
or diligence of the author. I will not utter other things contained in the said
letters neither would I have disclosed thus much but that I would wissh that the
king were admonisshed to consider whether cochleus were a man worthy to be
presented with his letters and his princely reward or no. And because I would
avoid the furios envy of this blasphemos impudent rayler who^ the bisshops had
hired to bark against me (for beside slanderos raylyng words he made me no
answer at all / and he threatened me that he would send me home again if he
could bring it to pass / unto the bisshops with my hands bownd behynd me) for
the which cause / I say / I did cast in my mind to chang again that co^try
where I was specially seeing I was called in to Ingland by the right noble lord
Crumwel and the Archbisshop of ca^terbery. for the railyng wretch Cochleus did
manifestly wright that he was sorer grieved with me for dwelling in that place
where I did remain / than he was with my matter or with any other thing else. I
considered that christ gave place somtymes unto the furiosnes of the Jews and
again that curr dogs which be tied at men's gates to bark / wha^ no man is by
them tha^ they sleep and make no besynes at all. And therefore I thought to
avoid his railing writings by no means so well / as if I should goo in to
Ingland and even stopp mine ears at his rauyng. And in deed I was not deceived
/ for the serpent left his hissing / and I was lovingly received not only of
the Archbisshop / and of the honorable lord Crumwel / but even of the right
noble king himself also / and I was sent unto Cambridge to read a lecture of
the scripture there / but the cross follows alweys christ's doctrine / where
soever it goes / and the deuel has ever envy that christ should have any rest
/ for even in the wilderness he would not suffer him to be quiet a lone / until
he had brought him unto the cross. I had scasely declared out the.viij. psalm
/ but I perceived mine enemy going a bout to wrap me in contencions. the which
although I hate naturally and have studied always to my power to avoid them /
yet I never submitted my self cowardly to the deuel nor never recanted any
thing sins I had any knoulege of christ's true gospel. And when I would have
made answer there for such doctrine as I had tawght / I came to the schools of
the university where a great number of auditors was gathered / and there before
the whole multitude I tarried an howr or ij loking when mine adversary should
come. but he although he refrayned from disputacyon (for what purpose or
consideracyon I can not tell) yet he co^spired me such envy that there were some
that were not a frayd to threaten me that it should cost me my life which thing
after I had opened to the vychanceler by the council of certain of the wisest
men there / and saw him wink at the matter / I gave place to this malice also
and departed from thens / specially for as much as I perceived there were
statutes sent forth from the bisshops and from the whole council of the reame
which were such that it had been wickedness not to have spoken openly against
them and yet to have reproved them it should have been counted a point of
sedicyon. The man was not hyndered nor put in fear by me / but the chanceler
of the vniuersyte which sent me thither by the commandment of the king would
suffer none of his vniuersyte to speak against any of the common laws. wherefore
I determined with my self to serve the time and to change the preaching of the
cross with the science of physik wherein I had a little sight before / And thus
I went unto a very well learned phisycia^ called doctor Nicolas which has
practiced phisyk in london these many years with high praise / whose company I
did use certain years whereby I did both see and lern many things even the
principal points concerning that science. In so much that at length certain of
my frindes did move me to take in hand to practice / which thing I did I trust
not vnluckyly. But yet not withstonding this / contrary to all my expectacion I
chanced to fall again in to such a disputacyon as I was in before / and in
manner with like aduersarys / for before I was vexyd with my contry bisshops and
with an hired railer Cochleus about the reading of the scripture in the mother
tongue. And it fortuned me to have a like contencion with certain bisshops of
Ingland (which maynteyne still the bishop of rome so far as they dare)
whether all things necessary unto our salvation be contained in the scripture /
or but a part only and the resydue to be taken out of the gloses of the doctors
/ out of the acts of old councels and out of popes lousy decreys. And unto
this disputacio^ I came suddenly unprepared / for as I did mete by chance in the
streate the right excellent lord Crumwel going unto the parliament house in the
year.1537. he when he saw me / called me unto him / and took me with him to
the parlame^t house to westmyster where we fownd all the bisshops gathered to
gether. unto whom as he went and took me with him / all the bisshops and
prelates did rise up and did obeisance unto him as to their vicar general and
after he had saluted them he sat him down in the highest place and right
against him sat the Archibisshop of cantorbery / after him the Archbisshop of
york / and than London / Lincoln / Salisbery / Bathe Ely / Herford /
Chichester / Norwich / Rochester and Worcester and certain other whose names I
have forgoten / all these did sit^ at a table covered with a carpet with certain
prystes standing about them.

Than the lord Crumwel being vicar general of the reame / lord of the preuy
seal and chief secret counceler unto the king turned him self to the bisshops
and said. Right reverend fathers in christ / The kings majesty gives you high
thanks that ye have so diligently without any excuse assembled hither acording
to his commandment / and ye be not ignorant that ye be called hither to
determyne certain co^trouersys which at this time be moved concerning the
christen religion and faith not only in this reame but also in all nations
thorowt the world: for the king studieth day and night to set a quietness in the
church / and he can not rest until all such controuersis be fully debated and
ended through the determinacyon of you and of his whole parliament. For all
though his special desire is to set a stey for the unlearned people whose
consciences are in dout what they may bileue / and he him self by his
excellent lerning knows these controuersys welinough / yet he will suffer no
common alteracyon / but by the consent of you and of his whole parlame^t By the
which thing ye may perceive both his high wisdom / and also his great love
toward you / and he desiereth you for christ's sake that all malice obstynacy
and carnal respect set apart / ye will frindly and lovingly dispute among your
selves of the co^trouersys moved in the church and that ye will conclude all
things by the word of god with out all brauling / or scolding / neither will
his magesty suffer the scripture to be wr^sted and defaced by any glosys / any
papistical laws or by any auctoryte of doctors or councels and much less will
he admit any articles or doctrine not contained in the scripture but approved
only by co^tynuance of time and old custom and by vnwritton verytes as ye were
wont to do. Ye know well i^ough that ye be bound to show this service to
christ and to his church and yet notwithsto^ding his magesty will give you high
thanckes / if ye will set and conclude a godly and a perfight unity / whereunto
this is the only way and mean if ye will determyne all things by the scripture
as god comma^deth you in deuteronomy / which thing his majesty exhorts and
desires you.

When the lord crumwel had spoken his mind after this sort with high grauyte
(as he was a man of a great wit / of excellent wisdom and of goodly eloquence)
all the bisshops did rise up and gave thanks to the kings majesty for his
fervent study and desire toward an unite and for this vertuos exhortacyon most
worthy a christen king. After this began they to dispute of the sacraments.
And first of all the bishop of london which was an ernest defender of the
popes part / whom a litel before the lord crumwel had rebuked by name for
defending of vnwritton verites / this bishop of london / I say / went about to
defend that there were.vij. sacraments of our christian religion which he would
prove by certain stinking gloses and old lousy writers / and he had up on his
side the Archbisshop of york the bishop of lincoln / bath / chichyster and
norwich / The bishop of salisbery / Ely / herford and worcester and certain
other with the Archbisshop of Cantorbery / were against him. And after they had
made much strife and co^tencyon about the saings of the doctors one contrary to
a another / The bishop of cantorbery spoke and said thus. It besemeth not men
of lerning and grauyte to make much babbling and brauling about bare words so
that we agree in the very substance and effect of the matter. For to braule
about words Is the property of sophisters and such as mean disceight and
suttilty which delight in the debate and dissencyon of the world and in the
miserable state of the church / and not of them which should seek the glory of
christ and should study for the unity and quietness of the church. There be
weighty controuersis now moved and put forth / not of ceremonis and light
things but of the true understanding and of the right difference of the law and
of the gospel / of the manner and way how sins be forgeuen / of cowmforting
doutful and wavering consciences by what means they may be certifyed that they
please god seeing they feel the strength of the law accusing them of sin / of
the true use of the sacraments / whether the outward work of them does
iustifye man or whether we receive our iustificacyon through faith. Item which
be the good works and the true service and honor which pleases god / and
whether the choice of meats / the difference of garments / the vowys of
monks and pristes and other tradicyo^s which have no word of god to confirm
them / whether these / I say / beright good works and such as make a perf^ght
christen man or no. Item whether vain service and false honoryng of god and
man's tradicyons do bynd men's consciences or no. Finally whether the ceremonis
of confirmacyon / of orders and of annealing and soch other (which can not be
proved to be institute of christ nor have any word in them to certifye us of
remissyon of sins) ought to be called sacraments and to be compared with
baptim and the supper of the lord or no. These be no light matters but even the
principal points of our christen religion / wherefore we contend not about
words and trifles but of high and ernest matters. Christ says. Blessed be the
peace makers / for they shall be called the so^nys of god And Paul commands
bisshops to avoid brawling and co^tencion about words which be profitable to
nothing but unto the subversion and destruction of the hearers. and be
monissheth specially that he should resist with the scriptures when any man
disputes with him of the faith and he adds a cause where as he says. Doing
this thou shall preserve both thy self and also them which hear the. Now if
ye will follow th^se councellers Christ and Paul / all contencyon and brauling
about words must be set apart and ye must stablissh a godly and a perfight
unity and concord out of the scripture. Wherefore in this disputacio^ we must
first agree of the number of the sacraments and what a sacrament does signify
in the holy scripture / and when we call baptyme and the supper of the lord
sacraments of the gospel / what we mean thereby. I know right well that. s.
Ambrose and other autors call the wasshi^g of the disciples fete and other
things / sacraments / which I am sure you your selves would not suffer to be
nombred among the other sacraments.

This exhortacyon did the archbisshop make most soberly and discretely as he is
a man of a singular grauyte / with such swetenes that it did my heart good to
hear him And because I did signifye by some token of my countnance that this
admonicyo^ of the archbisshop did please and delight me excelle^tly well / the
lord cromwell bad me speak what I thought of this disputacyo^ / but he told the
bisshops before that I was the kings scolar and therefore he desiered them to be
content to hear me indifferently. Than I after the rude manner of the schools
rather than after any courtly solemnyte / bowing my knee for a token of curtesy
and reverence / as It became me / with out any preface at all / began to speak
after this manner. Right honorable and noble lord and you most reverend fathers
and prelates of the church / although I come unprepared unto this disputacyon /
yet trusting in the aid of christ which promises to give both mouth and
wisdom unto us when we be required of our faith / I will utter my sentence and
judgment of this disputacyon. And I think that my lord archbisshop has given
you a profitable exhortacion that ye should first agree of the significacyon of
a sacrament. whether ye will call a sacrament a ceremony institute of christ in
the gospel to signify a special or a singular virtue of the gospel and of
godliness (as paul namith remissyon of sins to be) or whether ye mean that
every ceremony generally which may be a token or a significacyon of an holy
thing / to be a sacrament. For after this latter significacyon I will not stike
to grant you that there be.vij. sacraments and more to If ye will. But yet Paul
seems to describe a sacrament after the first significacion whereas he says
that circu^cisio^ is a token and a seal of the rightwisnes of faith: This
diffinycion of one particular sacrament must be understood to perteine unto all
sacraments generally / for the Jews had but one sacrament only as all the
scholastical writers do grant. And he describes baptyme after the same manner
in the.v. to the Ephesians whereas he says that Christ does sanctifye the
church) that is to say all that be baptized) through the bath of water in the
word of life. For here also he adds the word and promise of god unto the
ceremony / and Christ also requires faith where as he says / who so ever
bileueth and is baptized / shall be saved. And s. Austen describes a sacrament
thus / The word of god coming unto the element / makes the sacrament / and in
a another place he says a sacrament is a thing wherein the pour of god under the
form of visible things does work secretly salvation. And the master of the
sentences does describe a sacrament no another wise. A sacrament says he is an
inuysible grace and has a visible form / and by this inuysible grace I mean
/ says he / remissyon of sins. Finally s. Thomas denies that any man has
auctorite to institute a sacrament. Now if ye agree unto this diffinicyon of a
sacrament / it is an easy thing to judge of the number of those sacraments
which have the manifest word of god and be institute by christ to signifye unto
us the remissyon of our sins. s. Austen says that there be but.ij. such
sacraments in the.cxviij. pistle unto Ianuarius: His words be these. First I
would have the to understood the sum and effect of this disputacyo^ / which is
this that our lord Jesus Christ (as he him self says in the gospel) has lade^
us but with a light and easy yock or burden. Wherefore he has glewed the
fellowship of his new people with sacraments / very few in number / very easy
to be kept / and very excellent in signifycacyon / which be baptyme and the
supper of the lord and such other if there be any moo commanded in the holy
scripture those except which were burde^s for the seruytute of the people in the
old law for the hardness of their hearts et ce. And again in the.iij. book of
the lerning of a Christen man he says the scripture has taught us but few
signs / as be the sacrament of baptyme and the solemn celebracyon and
rememberance of the body and blood of the lord et ce.

The bishop of london could scarsly suffer me to speak thus much / but he
brake forth and said thus unto me / where as ye affirm all right and true
sacraments to be institute of Christ or to have the manifest scripture to
prove them or that all sacraments must have a significacyo^ of remissyon of
sins / It is all false. Than I answered that I would prove all that I had said
to be true not only by the scripture but by the old doctors and by the schole
writers also.

But the bishop of herforth (whom the kings grace favored highly both for his
singular wisdom and lerning / which was tha^ new comne out of germany where he
had been Imbassytor) being moved with the frowardnes of this bishop of london
said unto me brother Alexander contend not much with him about the minds and
sayngs of the doctors and schole writers / for ye know that they in many
places do differ among them selfs and that they are contrary to them selves
also almost in every article. And there is no hope of any concord to be made if
we must lean to their judgments in these matters of controversy / and we be
commanded by the kings grace to dispute by the holy scripture / et c. And he
turned him to the bisshops and made a short and pythy oracyon. Think ye not /
said he / that we can by any sophistical suttiltes steal out of the world
again / the light which every man does see / Christ has so lightened the world
at this time that the light of the gospel has put to flight all misty darkness
and it will shortly have the higher hand of all clouds though we resist in
vain never so much. The lay people do now know the holy scripture better than
many of us. And the germans have made the text of the Bible so plain and easy
by the hebrewe and the greek to^g that now many things may be better understand
without any gloses at all than by all the commentarys of the doctors. And more
over they have so openned these controuersys by their writings that women and
childern may wonder at the blindness and falshode that has been hitherto.
Wherefore ye must consider ernestly what ye will determyne of these controuersys /
that ye make not your selves to be mocked and laughed to storne of all the
world / and that ye bring them not to have this opinion of you to think ever
more here after that ye have neither one spark of lerning nor yet of godliness
in you. And thus shall ye lose all your estimacyon and auctoryte with them which
before took you for learned men and profitable members unto the common wealth of
Christendom. For that which you do hope upon / that there was never heresy in
the church so great but that process of time with the pour and auctorite of the
pope has quenched it / it is nothing to the purpose. But ye must turn your
opinyon and think this surely that there is nothing so feeble and weak / so
that it be true / but it shall find place and be able to stand against all
falshode. Truth is the daughter of time / and time is the mother of truth. And
what so ever is beseged of truth can not long continue / and upon whose side
truth does stand / that ought not to be thought transitory or that it will ever
fall. All things consist not in painted eloquence and strenght or auctorite.
For the truth is of so great pour / strength and efficacite / that it ca^
neither be defended with words nor be ouercomne with any strength / but after
she has hidden her self long / at length she puts up her head and appears
/ and as it is written in Esdra / a king is strong / wine is strongar / yet
women be more strong But truth excellyth all.

He spoke many more things to this purpose and effect very discretely to the
high delight of all that hard him. And I thinking my self to be encoraged by
his oracyon / I began thus to reason against the bishop of london.

Sacraments be signs or ceremonys which make us certain and sure of the will of
god. But no man's heart can be certain and sure of the will of god with out the
word of god / wherefore it follows that there be no sacraments without the word
of god / and such as can not be proved out of the holy scripture ought not to
be called sacraments. The first part of this reason is Sanct Paul's own saing
the.iiij. to the Romans where he says that circumcisyon is a toke^ and a
seal of the rightwisnes of faith. Ergo it requires faith to certify man's heart
of the will of god. But the word of god is the foundacyon of faith / the.x. to
the Roma. Faith comes by hearing / and hearing comes by the word of god. For
the mind must be taught and instruct of the will of god by the word / like as
the ey is taught and instruct by the outward ceremony. And Paul by this saing
confuteth this opinyo^ that the sacraments should make me^ rightuos and just
before god for the very outward work without faith of them that receive the^
and after this manner does Paul speak unto the Ephesyans that christ does
sanctify his church through the bath of water in the word of life. And for as
much as he joins the word unto the ceremony and declares the virtue and pour
of the word of god that it brings with him life / he does manifestly teach
that the word of god is the principal thing and even as it were the very
substance and body of the sacrament and the outward ceremony nothing else tha^ a
token of that lively infla^macyon which we receive through faith in the word and
promise. S. Paul also in ministering the sacrament of the lords supper does
manifestly add the words of Christ: He took bread / says he / and when he
had given thanks he brake it and said / take ye this and eat ye this for it
is my body. Item do ye this in my rememberans. Beside this he teaches
evidently that only christ and none but he had pour to institute a sacrament
and that neither the apostels nor the church has any auctorite to alter or to
add any thing unto his ordinance / where as he says / For I received of the
lord that which I d^lyuered unto you et ce. To what purpose should he go a bout
to move the people to bileue him and to wi^ne their hearts with this
protestacyon if it had been lauful for him to have made any sacraments or to
have altered the form and manner of ministering this sacrament / as some men
both wickedly and shamelesly do affirm that the apostles did alter the form
of baptyme. Wha^ I had spoken thus much / the bishop of london did interrupt
me / and said / let us grant that the sacraments may be gathered out of the
word of god / yet are you far deceived if ye think that there is no another
word of god but that which every sowter and cobbler do read in their mother
tongue. And if ye think that nothing perteyneth unto the Christen faith but that
only that is writton in the bible / than err ye plainly with the Lutheranes.
For. S. Johan says that Jesus did many things which be not writton. And. S.
Paul commands the Thessalonians to observe and keep certain vnwritton
tradicyons and ceremonys.ij. Thessa. ij. Moreover he him self did preach not
the scripture only but even also the tradicyons of the elders Act. xvj. Finally
we have received many things of the doctors and councels by times which
although they be not writton in the bible / yet for as much as the old doctors
of the church do make mencyon of the^ / we ought to grant that we received them
of the apostles / and that they be of like autoryte with the scripture / and
finally that they may worthily be called the word of god vnwritton.

Now when the right noble lord Crumwel / the Archbisshop with the other
bisshops which did defend the pure doctrine of the gospel hard this / they
smyled alytle one upon a another for as much as they saw him flee even in the
very beginning of the disputacyon unto his old rusty sophistry and vnwritton
verites. And I would have disputed further with the bishop to have confuted
this blasphemos lie / But the lord Crumwel bad me be content for the time began
to go away and it was.xij. of the clock / and thus I made an end with this
protestacyon. Right reverend master bishop ye deny that our Christian faith
and religyo^ does lean only upon the word of god which is writton in the bible
/ which thing if I can prove and declare / than ye will grant me that there be
no sacraments but those that have the manifest word of god to confirm them /
unto this he did consent and than immediately that assemble was dissolved for
that day.

Now the next day when the bisshops were assembled again and I was present
with the lord crumwel / there came unto me a certain archdeacon in the name of
the archbisshop of ca^torbery which told me that the other bishops were
greuosly offended with me / that I being a stranger should be admitted unto
their disputacyo^ / which thing when I had showed unto the lord crumwel he
thought it best to give place unto the bisshops specially be cause he would not
procure me their hatred / for he knew well that if they had ones conceived in
their hearts any malice against any man they would never cease til they had
gote^ him out of the way / and they had before brought to death diverse whom
the king did highly favor / before the king him self (whom they moved by all
means to put them to execucyon quickly) could perceive and spy out their
craft and suttilty. But he bad me give him the paper wherein I had writton my
disputacyon that he might show it to the bishop of london and to the other
bisshops in the council / the co^tentes whereof was this.

Right honorable and noble lord / and ye right reverend fathers / yesterday
when I disputed of the sacraments with the bishop of london / we came thus
far that those only ought to be called sacraments which have the word of god
for them / and this point only remained to be further declared that nothing
ought to be taken for the word of god but only the holy books of the old and
new testament. For the bishop of london affirmed that the tradicions and
ceremonys whereof the old ecclesiastical writers do make mencyon / were received
of the apostles and given us of the fathers from hand to hand and therefore they
may be laufully called the word of god vnwritto^ / and our faith must be proved
by them as well as by the holy scripture which is writton in the bible.

Now I have determined to confute this saing and opinyo^ and to show by the
manifest testimonys of christ / of the Apostles of the prophets and also of
the old doctors that the Christen faith ought to lean only upon the holy
scripture and that the books of the old and new testament only ought to be had
and taken for the word of god. And because there hangs a another disputacyo^
upon this / that is to say / of the auctorite of the doctors and of councels /
I will also speak of them. For cochleus and other blasphemos liars which for
the bellys sake have salable tu^ges and in whom the saing which Paul alleges
against them that mainteyne wicked doctrine for their bellys sake does very well
agree / saing. The cretya^s are alweys false liars / wicked beasts and slow
bellys. These hipocrites I say / do plainly hold that the church (that is to
say the bisshops / as they understand) has pour to judge over the scripture
and to examyne it / and also that it has auctoryte to allow or to refuse the
gospel / and to dispense with the.x. commandments and to alter the form of
baptyme and to make new articles of our faith beside those which be contained
in the scripture. Some there be that speak yet more reverently saing that they
contend not of the scripture or of the word of god but of the exposicyon
theroff which they will have to be taken and sought of the church and of the
doctors which be allowed of the church / unto whose judgment they say we ought
to stand in all co^trouersys of our faith what so ever they dear whether they
have any scripture for them or no.

This sophistical suttelty although it has more coning than the first gross
blasphemy / yet it is to the same effect and they both have one end and defend
both one opinion. But yet / before the bishop of london / there was never none
so far past shame as to say that the rytes and ceremonys in the church which
can not be proved by the scripture ought to be called the word of god
unwritten* and that we ought to byld our faith up on them as up on the holy
scripture written in the bible.

This threfold maze / or rather one tra^^formed.iij. ways / covered and painted
with diverse words has those reasons only to confirm it which the bishop did
before allege for the vnwritton word / and certain other which I will rehearse
and confute in the end of this writing.

But first I will beat down this gross blasphemy / and I will show and
declare that our whole faith and all the articles of the christian religion be
contained in the scripture of the prophets and apostles / so that a christen
man is bownd to believe no other thing than such things as may be proved out of
that scripture.

This horrible blindness of men / and the boldness and malycyos obstinacy which
follows therup on (wherthorow they blaspheme god and his holy word /) is
rather to be lamented than to be convict with many reasons the thing being so
manifest. But the nerer that the brightness of the son of reightwisnes does
come / and the more clearly that the light of the gospel does shine / so much
more blinder and more obstynate are the unfaithful made / in so much verily
that they are more blynder now in the great light than they were before and they
stomble in very deed up on the stomblyng stone and up on the rock of sclander.
For the false teachers even when they were in the most blind darkness were never
so bold nor impudent as to break out in to such a blasphemy as to say the
church might make new articles of the faith not contained in the scripture /
or that it has auctorite to dispe^se with the.x. co^mandme^ts and to alter the
form of baptyme. Gerson / duns / dorbel / Decam / Tomas / Bonaue^ture / do
plainly condemn this heresy / and they affirm that the truth reveled of god
and contained in the body of the bible or in the holy scripture / is the
foundation of our faith / that is to say the thing where up o^ our faith ought
to be bylded / and they would never have byleued that there should ever be so
great blindness in the church that any man should be so bold as to affirm that
the articles of the christen faith ought to be sought not in the scripture but
in the gloses of men and in bisshops laws / or that man's tradicions / rites
and ceremonys received in the church and not contained in the scripture / ought
to be called the word of god vnwritton.

But I will cease my co^playning seeing I know that now is the latter time whereof
the prophets / christ / and the apostles did prophecy that there should come
false prophets which should face out the gospel and imagyne a new gospel even
stynking / hethenyssh / old wiuyssh and capcyos fables invented by the suttyl
wit of man as peter and paul call them / and of these false prophets (that is
to say Antichrist) did daniel christ and paul admonissh us that he should
extolle him self a boue god and should rob god of his name / pour / wisdom /
and mercy and should accuse him of right wisnes / cruelnes and weakness and
vnabylyte / which thing we do manifestly see in manner in all their doctrynes /
as in their pardons / in the popes your / in purgatory / in pryuate masses / in
the prayng unto saints / in worshipyng of Images / in the vows of monks and
pristes / and in all man's tradicyons. And I pray you is not this to accuse god
of ignorance / of malice and of sluggisshnes and neclygence / to say that god
has not writton in his holy books of scripture all things necessary unto our
salvation? as though either he did not remember althings when he gave the
scripture to be writton / or else that he could not tell all things or else that
he hid certain things from us of purpose that so he might damn and destroy us
where as he had said before evidently that we should be judged at the latter day
by the word which he had spoken unto us. But they be so blinded by the deuel
that they can not perceive the abhominacion of this blasphemy.

Now to confirm all godly minds / and to call them back from their dotyng I
have gathered in order certain testimonys which do evidently prove that the
wrytton word of god is the fowndacion of our christen faith and that all the
articles of our christen faith ought to be prouyd by the holy scriptures.

The first is in the.iiij. of Deuterono^ye shall not add unto the word which I
speak unto you neither mynissh from it. And who did ever expownd this to be
understand of the vnwritton word before these lying false prophetys and
antichrystes? And if it ought to be understood of the writton scripture only /
than do they plainly against gods word which Imagyne that there should be any
vnwritton word. But I am not ignorant how these mockers are wont to jest or
scoff a way and to face out this place / sayng that there is one kind of adding
which minyssheth / a another which alters / a another which makes largyer and
a another which fulfilleth / and they grant that this sayng refuses all manner
of addings saving the last manner / whereby the scripture is made more manifest
and open. But to confute this fansy and Imaginacyon the manifest scripture is
suffycye^t deute. the.vj. what I command that shall thou do only unto the lord
/ thou shall neither add nor minyssh any thing. And in the last chapt. of the
Apoca. Who so ever adds any thing unto this / the lord shall se^d him the
plages which be writo^ in this book / which place all the duns men even duns
him self grants that it ought to be understand of the whole scripture.
wherefore it is manifest that those sin against the commandment of god which
affirm that there is any word of god vnwriton / like as they do which expownd
the scripture after their own fansis or give judgment of the will of god with
out the manifest word of god. For it is a deuillyssh lie to say that the
scripture can not be understand with out men's comme^tarys or glosys / because
it is so dark and dowtful that it may be applied to confirm all manner of
heresys. In the.xxviij. of deuter. are proffred benedyccyons of all sortys unto
them that keep those things which are writton in the book of the law. And in
the.xxxij. chap. of the same book Moses does manifestly say thus: Set and fyxe
your hearts upon all the words which I testyfye unto you this day / that ye
may command your childern to keep and observe all things which are writton in
the book of this law: for they be not given and commanded unto you in vain:
but that every one of you should live after them. Mark / here is everlasting
life promised unto them which keep those things that are writton in the
scripture. And Moses does plainly say that this is the fynal and only cause
why god would have his word to be writton / that all men in general and every
one in s^eciall of what order / degree or occupacyon so ever he be / should have
the word of god where by they might be saved. whereupon it follows that it is a
manifest blasphemy to say that we may be saved or damned by any tradicyo^s of
man. And here they are conuyct to be starck idyotes which asscrybe this
ignorance and neclygence unto god / as though he either could not or else would
not commit all articles necessary unto our salvation to be writton in the holy
scripture. For they declare euydently that they know not the final cause why
the scripture is given unto us / but they Imagyne god to be like some ignorant
poet which has given us a patched and an vnperfight work. For god would that
in the scripture / his will should shine as it were in a glass / and that the
perfight image of his deyte (which paul calls the prynt and seal of his
substance) should appear therein. Item. s. John says that this word does shine
in darkness / and that it is the light which shines in men's hearts blinded of
the devil through sin: and that christ does open unto us the will of god through
his gospel / which will no mortal man did ever know / but so far as this
word which is in the fathers bosom / did open unto him. Wherefore we may perceive
that it is not only through the ignorance of man that the word of god is thus
blasphemed / but through the malice of the devil. For the deuel never cease to
disfigure this word / namely the son of god whom he despised before the world
was made / and shall fight with him even with all his pour until the day of
judgment.

In the.xvij. of deute. The king is commanded to have alweys in his hands and
in his sight / the book of the law / and to read out of it all the days of
his life / for this purpose that he should learn to fear his lord god. And for
his study and diligence this promise is made him / that he should live long and
that his kingdom should be given to many of his progeny and lynage. And would to
god all christen kings and princes would think surely the reading of the holy
books of scripture to be a part off their office, not to read them in late^
which they understand not / but so to read it as they may learn the will of god
/ how he will be feared by his word only / and not by any popish laws and man's
tradicyons. And if they would do thus I durst surely wara^t them both that they
should live longer / and also that they should have less tumult and sedicyon in
their life time. For now seeing they play the tyra^nes over the scripture and
over the readers of it / it is no meruel that god does ponissh them for their
cruelnes / and that there be few of them but that dye some shameful and cruel
death / for such is the end of tirannes wont to be. Ioachim king of Judah saw
all his sons headed and he him self (his eyes before put out) was bownd and
led presoner in to babylon / and it was said openly unto him because thou have
brent the book of Iheremy there shall be none left of thy sede which shall sit
upon the throne of david / and thy cark as shall be cast out in to the heat in
the day time / and in to the frost in the night time.

Antiochus which commanded the holy books of scripture to be burnt perisshed
miserably in desperacyon and through a meruelos fall. Both daniel and paul do
testifye that he was the figure of the last Antichrist that ever should be.
Wherefore I will not spend my words in vain unto these most damnable
Antichrists / but I write only for the comfort of the faithful / and for them
which sin through ignorance / if it shall please god to put in to their hearts
to knowledge the veryte and to repent and come out of the deuyls snare at whose
will and pleasure they are now led captyue prisoners. And because it were a long
work to search all the aucthorytes thorowt the scripture / I will allege but one
place more out of the law / and then will I come to the prophets and to the
gospel. In the.xxx. of deutero. it is writton thus / The commandment which I
give unto the is not above thy pour neither is it far from the / it is not
set in heaven that thou can laufully say / which of us all can clyme up in to
heaven to bring it down unto us that we may hear what it is and fulfill it:
Neither is it set beyond the sea / that thou can laufully say which of us all
is able to swymme over the sea and to fetch it unto us that we may hear what
it is and fulfill that which is commanded unto us therein. But the word is nygh
yea and very nygh unto the in thy mouth and in thy heart.

These words be spoken unto the glote^s and belly gods of this last time /
which for all the great pretense and outward show that they make of holiness /
and say that they murder men for the preseruacyo^ of the true faith and of the
autorycte of the church / yet they declare euydently enough that they deny the
virtue of holiness seeing they be spotted and shamefully defiled with blood /
murder / whordome / disceyte / and with all kinds of filthiness and of
wickedness so that it may manyfestly appear that they be fully persuaded that
god takes no care at all for mankind / yea that there is no god at all which
will ponish these abhomynacyons? Leo the.x. called a cowncel to determine
whether the soul of man were i^mortal or no / and when he had heard every man's
sentence and mind he said that the matter was more diffycult than that he could
determine or judge which part had strongar reasons for it / but whether the
soul were mortal or i^mortal / he said he would not defraude his soul of the
co^modytes delycyosnes and pleasures which were present / and if there were any
life after this / he would be content to make good chere with other there also
if he should see that they would be as good felows there as they were here This
was the voice of the high and supreme bishop / after whose sentence all men
must determine of the word of god / and up on whose arbyterme^t our faith and
salvation must depend / This I say / is the judgment of the holy see whereunto
men must sail out of Aphryca / Asya / and europe / Denmark / England and
Irland and out of all other lands even in to Italy unto this vicar of christ
and unto his.xij. Carnals the postys of the church / which succeeded the
apostels / to these must they come to ask council of the will of god / and of
the understanding of the scripture which in their own nacyons and in the
councels of their own contrys they can in nowyse understand But moses drawyth
us from this deuelissh sentence where as he says. The word is very nygh unto
the / even in thy mouth and in thy heart and before thy eyes / mark / says he
/ and remember that I have set it before thy eyes that thou may read in that
book yea and understand it also. For else in deed it had been but a very madness
to have writto^ such things as no man could understand. It had been much more
worship for god to have wryton nothing at all than so to have mocked man kind /
where as he said he had set before him good and evil / life and death /
blessyng and curse etc.

He meant not good and euel after the meaning of the serpent persuading Adam
that he through trangressyon of gods commandme^t in eating of the forbiddyn
fruit / that he should have the knoulege of good and euel that is everlasting
da^nacyon. for so meant the deuel.

But god will not be honored after the doctrine of the serpent / nor after the
doctrine of the deuel nor yet he will not be feared after the co^mandme^tes /
traditions and doctrines of men contrary to his word / or other wise than his
word appoynteth. He forbids all manner of honor and conde^nyth all manner of
worship and service done unto him / which he has not ordained or commanded.
For these things must be learned out of the word of god / and the will of god
both what pleases him and what pleases him noti / ^ known only by the holy
writto^ scripture. And if we believe not this / even heaven and earth at the
latter day / shall witness against us that we follow and obey the serpent (which /
is now waxen a great Antichrist) even wetyngly of a set purpose and obstynacy
contrary to the exhortation and monicion of Moses. For he says / I take and
call to witness heaven and earth that I have set before the in thy sight / life
and death / blessing and curse (not that curse that the puppy blows out under
the name of almighty god and the holy saints Peter and Paul) but even this
curse which / if we regard or obey the pope / we shall hear of christ go your
way ye cursed in to everlasting fire which is prepared for the deuel and his
messengers. For christ gives us warning there / as Moises did / of the belly
gods of the last time / of the false lying prophets and of the false christ's
which should imagyne a new word and a new Christ bownd to certain appointed
places days / meats / oaths / vows and bands to absteyne from the lauful
creatures and ordinances of god / which should drive christ out of the comp^ny
of men and out of the ordinary and common life / in to the w^ldernes again /
and shu^d shut him up in deanes and klosters / or presons rather / among the
captive presoners / he says also that they shall byld and confirm their
preaching / doctrine / and laws / not by the word of god / or by the holy
words of the old Prophecyes / that is to say by the scripture / but by false
signs and lying miracles / and that they shall so myghtily blind and deceive
the unfaithful and such as have not received the truth of gods word but have
suffered the^ selves to be led a way from it and to be seduced through miracles
/ that eue^ the elect / if it were possible / might be deceived. And he
monissheth us of these things so ernestly / that he calls upon heaven and
earth to bear him witness / that he did premonissh and declare these things unto
us before / of the Antichrists that should come / whereby he declares what
sorrow and care he takes for us and how sore he lamenteth that we should perissh
and be damned through such blasphemy of Antichrist. And even after this same
manner and with like words does the prophet Esaias thonder for the defense of
gods word against the doctrynes and tradicyons of men / saing. All flessh is
even grass / and all the glory of it / that is to say even his most excellent
wisdom and pour / is even like the flower of an herb. the grass widdereth
away and the flower of the herb falls a way for the spyryte and breath of
the lord has blown upon it. And the people be very grass. the grass / I say
/ widdereth and the flower falls / but the word of the lord endures for ever
etc. He threatens also everlasting night of infidelyte or vnbylefe / if we
believe either any new reuelacyons withowt the word of god / or else any
apparicyo^s of dead spretes. The words after the true hebrew text be these.
Shall the people seek council of their god / or shall they are council of the
dead for the living? shall they not rather look and search in the law of the
lord / and tak the testimony of god unto council? If they tell you not (says
he) according unto this word / they shall have no morni^g light. Sureli this is
a sore threatening unto them which understand what this voice is / what this
derknes signifies and who is the auctor and causer of it. John calls christ
the light that shyneth in darkness and that lightneth all me^ which come in to
this world / he says that the true life is in the word of god / and that life
is the light of men / and again that god is the light in whom is no darkness at
all / and that who so ever walks in darkness / has no fellowship with god. And
christ calls hi^ self the life of the world / and he says unto us. Walk in
the light while ye have it / that no darkness compass now etc. Now the deuel is
the prince of all darkness / he did first steal this light from mankind through
infidelite / he did first rob us of the true knowledge of god and brought us
in to all darkness of infydelite / and in to all kinds of errors. But the son
of rigtuosnes has restored this light unto the world again / and his coming
was unto us the bright morni^g whereof Esaias speaks in this place. And it is no
meruel that we have walked in a continual darkness thus long / for we have
forsaken the word of god and sought the light in the devils doctrine / in our
own wisdom / in man's tradicyons / and we have had so great confydence in
fantasyes / that we have byleued dead spyrites and made new artycles of our
faith even out of the appearing of them / as namely that there is a purgatory
after this life out of the which souls may be redeemed through the sacrifice of
the mass / which the pope and the devil have ordained to be a sacrifice for
the quick and the dead contrary to the institutyon and ordinance of christ.
But now let us hear what witness christ him self the everlasting word of god
gives of his scripture. For the same question was disputed of / eue^ in
christ's time among the high doctors which thought that the scripture without
the tradicyons of the elders / was not sufficient unto their salvation and one
of those doctors came to christ and said / master what may I do to enjoy
everlasting life? But christ sent this curios infidele unto the scripture /
sayng / what is writton in the law? How do thou read therei^? as though he
should say. Doist thou thinck that god is a wauerer or a changeling that will
alter his mind every howr as men change their laws / and imagine dayli new
opinions of god? I tell the the word of god continues for ever / and do thou
nothing but even the self thing only that thou seyst writton in the law / and
so thou shall live: he says not now how think thou / or how do thou hear
the pharisees and the scribes preach and teach / but he sends him to the
scripture and says what read thou there? Do that and thou shall live. And
although the scribes / pharisees and doctors did ever patch their laws and
tradicyons unto the word of god / yea and preferred the^ also before it / as
christ shows in the.xv. and.xxiij. of Matthew / yet all other among w^om the
true church did raygne had on judgment and bylefe / namely that the will of god
must be known by the scripture only and that a^l articles must be judged and
examyned by it / as christ declares where as he says unto the jews. Search
the scriptures for ye believe surely that ye shall have everlasting life in the^
by the which words christ testifies plainly that this was the opynion and
judgment of the o^d church / that all men should know the will of god by the
scripture only / and that they should judge all articles of the faith necessari
unto salvation / by that only. And where as he bids the^ exam^ne his
preaching by the scripture / he shows evidently euin the whole gospel to
beco^teyned in the old scripture. And who so ever denies the commandment of
Moses before rehearsed to perteyne unto us because the Apostles had not yet
writto^ their books / they be very asseheades withowt any knoulege or
vndersto^ding. For this rule did the Apostels follow when they testified un to
the church of the gospel / that no book should be received / except it consentyd
with the old scripture / and by this rule the church refused the books which
confirmed their storys by the prophets. And by this rule do the Evangelists
prove their writings / and Paul also procures auctorite un to his pistle to
the Roma.j. by this same rule / where as he says that his gospel was before
promised by the prophets in the holy scriptures. To this purpose also serve
these saings of christ. If ye believed Moses / ye would bileue me also / for he
wrote of me etc. and again this / Search the scriptures etc. for even they
bear witness of me. Now this controversy of the vnwritton word and of man's
gloses and tradicyons / if we will follow the council of our fore fathers and
stand to the judgment of the church in christ's time / I will lay this
sentence of the old church confirmed of christ for me / against all that my
aduersarys can make or say / writton in the xij. of John / The word which I
have spoken shall judge them in the last day. And if this word were not writto^
/ or if it were not all writton / who could besure and certain of his salvation
/ or of the will and pleasure of god. And if our faith and the salvation of
mankind did depend only of men's doctrine / so that the so^me and rule of our
religion were not writton in the scripture / who durst trust and bileue that
one hole / perfight and vnblemisshed sentence of christ were left unto us? For
seeing the deuel wresteth the scripture unto eueri wicked opinyon and durst
refuse the scripture through the Manicheis / as he does now adays cause it be
burnt by the bisshops / who dowteth but that he would rather have destroyed the
whole scripture at ones more than.xv. hundredth year agone / and to have set up
in the stead of it / his own blasphemes / and that they should have been called
the writton word of god rather tha^ the vnwritton and invented word. Oh lord /
the holy ghost had euel provided for us if he had left us in the holy scripture
only part of the word and will of god. And how could god have lauffully damned
us for receiving strange doctrines even after the commandmentes of the bisshops
if he had not left all things necessary for our salvation / writton in his holy
word? And again where as christ commands us to hear the church / if we
should not know the true church only by the scripture / but by pour auc torite
and saccession: who should have durst ones to have opened his lips against the
Idolatrissh service and false traditions of the bishops or ones have whisspred
against any wickedness / had it been never so manifest?

But they being thorouly bli^ded do not perceive this most shameful and
detestable blasphemy: They do not consider / what ignorance / neclygence and
unmercifulness they ascrybe unto god / wha^ as they say that god did not regard
that the word should be writton whereby he says that we shall be judged at the
latter day. But the holy ghost esspyed before the malice of the deuel and also
this blasphemy / and therefore to repress and confownd his purpose and tyranny /
and again to stopp the mouths of all other / he enjoined his scribes (that is
to say the Prophets / Apostels and evangelists) to write this word: that we
should have by us a sure and a perpetual testimony whereunto we might surely
trust and whereby he might show and declare him self to damn the wicked
lawfully. And he commanded the apostels that they should bear witness of this
scripture / and that they should reiecte all other writings whose so ever they
were / which went about to mix their lies with the gospel / like as. s. luke
in the prologe of his gospel / says / I thought it good to write unto the /
gentil brother Theophyl / all things which I have serched out with all
dilygence from the beginning / that thou might have a perfight ground to
bild thy faith up on which thou le^nydst in thy youth etc. By this so euydent a
testymony has the holy ghost stablysshed and confirmed our hearts against the
blasphemy of antichrist which accuses the holy ghost of most shameful wickedness
and vnrightuosnes / saing that he did not regard to write all Articles of our
christen religyon and faith / but that he would they should depend upon uncertain
doctrynes which the bisshops might make and alter as often as they list. And the
holy ghost was not content with this one testimony / but he caused the self same
evangelist which had promised him self to write all things from the beginnig
with all diligence / to testifye again that he had fulfilled his promise / for
in the begi^nig of the acts he says that he has writto^ in the story of his
gospel of all things which christ both did and taught eue^ until that day that
he left this world. And because there were certain which did falsely writ and
wrest this place / the holy father Chrysostom does expownd it thus / There be
some that enquire / how luke could wryght of all things which christ both did
and taught sei^g John says it were impossible to write all things / whom I
answer / says he / luke meneth not al things but of all things necessary unto
our salvation. But the holy ghost needs no help of animan to co^firm his
words / for he which is the most coning craftesman of all and has the
knoulege of all words did epsy before what cauillacyon the deuel would make at
that / and therefore he makes answer unto it even by the self same evangelist.
For where as Ihon had said that Jesus had done many miracles which be not
writto^ / he adds immediately and says / These be writto^ that ye should
bileue that Jesus is the son of god and that ye believing / should have
everlasting life hy his name. By th^s words it is manifest that the so^me of
all christ's doctrine and so many miracles also were writton / as be sufficyent
to confirm our faith and all manner of articles which we be bownd to believe.
For this article that Jesus is the son of god and the promised seed which
should break the serpents head and restore that life which the deuel had
stolen from us and had brought again and restored through the apperyng of the
gospel / that light which was darckened and hidden by the prince of darkness /
unto themyserable world sitting or living before in darkness and in the shadow
of death / this article I say is the so^me of the whole scripture and the
principal point or article of s. John's gospel. And for this articles sake he
says in his first pistel that he wrote all things unto all men / and that he
which byleueth in the son / has the witness i^ him self / that is to say /
he does understand the sum of the whole scripture. And because god would have
the holy books wr^tto^ testifye of this sede that was to come / namely / the
son of god / the whole scripture is a testimony of this christ and son of god /
and there are many t^m^s diverse witnesses alleged in the scripture to bear
witness of christ that he is the son of god conceived by the holy ghost / borne
of the virgin suffered death / and is risen up again etc. And unto this had he
respect when he said. Search the scriptures for they bear witness of me. And
peter speaks in like manner s^i^g. All the prophet^s do witness with him that
god forgeueth all the sins unto them which bileue and put their confydence in
this christ. And Paul says in like manner that rightuosnes was testified of /
in the law and in the prophets. Wherefore those testimonys which prove Jesus to
be the son of god do sufficiently prove also our whole christian faith / and all
manner of articles necessar^y to salvation and to everlasting life.

And it were no hard thing to dyduce and draw all the articles of the faith
even out of this one. For he that byleueth Jesus to be the son of god / must
needs also grant god the father almighty / maker of heaven and earth / to be the
natural father of our lord Jesus christ and that for his sake he is our father
and we be the sons of god for Jesus sake and through him. And christ says
believe ye in god? so believe in me also: do ye not believe that I am in the
father and the father in me? And John says / who so ever confesses Jesus to
be the son of god / khe has both the father and the son. Item who so ever
bileueth Jesus to be the natural son of god / must needs acknoulege that he is
that Emanuel of whom Esaias did Prophecy that he should be borne of a virgyn and
should suffer death like as other scriptures had before testified and he says
O ye folisshe hearts hard to believe all things which the prophets have told
you. Must not Christ needs have suffered all these things and so enter in to his
glory? Again it was impossyble that the son of god should be holde^ down of
death / but that he should break the pains of hell and rise up again. As
peter does prove in the acts out of Dauyd / and like wise Paul to prove his
ascensyon unto heaven alleges this verse out of the psalm / Thou did ascend
unto the highth / And tokest captyuyte prisoner / and gave diverse gifts unto
men. And dauyd speaks of this son saing The lord said unto my lord / sit at
my right hand until I make thy emnys thy fotestole: Which place paul expowndeth
of the kingdom of christ after his resurrection and ascensyon.j. to the
coryn.xv. Furthermore if thou byleuest Jesus to be the son of god / than thou
shall grant that he has sent the holy ghost to sanctifye the congregacyon that
is to say all the faithful according to his promise / and that he is the god in
whose name he commanded that we should be baptized / like as in his fathers name
and his. Ite^ all the prophets do bear witness of the holy ghost / namely that
we must receive remissyon of sins through his name and he promyseth that he
will raise us up again unto everlasting life. These things have I spoken the
more largely for the shameful cauellacyon and blasphemy of London which denies
that all the articles of our faith can be proved by the scripture / because. s.
John says that Jesus did many miracles which be not writton in this book.

Now will I allege the minds of Cirillus and. s. Austen to confute this wicked
and blasphemos opinyon.

Cyrillus writing upon John. the.xij. chap. speaks thus: John says there is
a great multitude and an infinyte number of the miracles which the lord did /
but those / says he / which we have showed you be sufficyent to them that
read them diligently for the stablysshing and confirmacyon of a perfight faith
/ and I am not to be blamed though I have not writton them all. For if all were
gathered one by one / none left out / the whole world would not receive the
multitude of the books. Wherefore all that he did were not writto^: But all
things which the writers thought sufficyent both for the faith and bylefe / and
also for the life and conuersacyon of men / that we might shine with a right
and perfight faith and with true works and virtues / and so come unto the
kingdom of heaven through our lord christ be wrytton / wherefore it is a newelye /
lately inverted in the deuels shop to say that all the articles of the christen
faith can not be proved by the scripture / and that men's tradicyo^s beside the
scripture be good works and please god. Now ye may see that the church in
Cyrillus time did not acknoulege this wicked blasphemy.

Austen affirms the same writing up on this place of John / these be writton
that ye should byliue etc. Our lord Jesus says he / did many miracles but all
be not writton / for those that should be writto^ were specialy chosen and pyked
out as many as were thought necessary and sufficient for the saluacyo^ of the
faithful. By these auctorites ye may see that they belie the old doctors which
say that they maynteyne any such blasphemy. But now to make an end of alleging
any more testimonies. I will cite only.ij. specyal and most faithful witnesses
against this deuelyssh sophistical cauillacyon and opinyon / namely Peter and
Paul and so will I make an end. For every man that has any wit at all may
plai^ly perceive that Peter wrote his second pistle against such blasphemers as
do imagine a new word of god beside that which is writton. For he calls the
scripture even a very true prophecy and he calls them false / or lyeng
Prophets which teach contrary to this prophetical and Apostolical prophecy or
any thing which is not contained in it. and he teaches this rule whereby we
should avoid all manner of lies that we should try and examine them by this
prophetical word or prophetical scripture whereunto he commands us to have a
specyal eye as unto the candel which dryueth out and banisheth away all darkness
and lies of the deuel. His words be these.

I write unto you this second pistle to prick you up and to quycke^ your hearts
that ye might remember the words which have been told now before by the holy
prophets / and also the words of our message and commandment which be the
Apostles of the lord and savior / for ye must know that in the latter days
there shall come mockers

Now these mockers he paynteth with specyal colors where by they may be known.
They shall bring in says he / pernicyos and damnable sects / or as Paul says
/ they shall speak lies in hypocrisy under the color and pretense of holiness.
Forbidding to mary and to absteyne from the meats which god has created to be
received of the faithful with thanks geuyng / And they shall deny the lord
(says he) which has bought or redeemed them / and the way of the truth shall
they slander and reuyle / as certain blasphemers do now a days speak
blasphemosly of paul / because he does manifestly confute man's satisfaccyons /
rightwisnes / and redempcyo^ by works. And therefore / says he for couetosnes
sake they shall make marcha^dise of now through fables and false doctrine
inverted of their own brains / and he compares the^ to Sodom and Gomor and he
says that they have eyes full of adultery. But their doctrine peter calls
disceitful fables and he says that their suttelty must be disclosed by the
lantern of the prophetycal scripture. And we have the word of prophecy / says
he / where unto ye do well to harken as unto a candel geuyng light in the dark
night till the day light appear and the morning sterre rise in your hearts /
for as much as ye know that no prophetycal scripture belongs to ma^s
interpretacyo^ nor it was never thrust unto us by ma^s will / But the holy men
of god were inspyred of the holy ghost / and moved to speak it.

This is a sure and a substancyal testimony to confute all manner of doctrines
and tradicyons beside the scripture / yea and to refuse all manner of doctors
and writars which speak any thing of their own brain without scripture to
confirm it. For. s. Peter puts a special difference between prophecy or
prophetical scripture / and an Interpretacyon which is invented of ma^s own
brain and tradicyons which are made and enjoined at man's co^mandme^t / and he
calls all manner of doctrines which be not contained in the scripture of the
holy ghost / capcyos and disceyghtful fables / and he ascribes an high
auctoryte unto the old prophecy and prophetical scripture. For when he had
alleged for his doctrine the divinity of christ which he had seen and the
voice of the father which he had hard / and again the witness of Moses and
Elyas (...) te in wickedness / and they shall subvert and bewitch their hearers
that they shall have great delight in the deuels cauillacyons and blasphemis.
Such falls and lying prophets does paul set forth in such lively colors as
they ought be painted with / and makes a comparyson between a faithful
preacher of the gospel and a false hipocryte and dissembler. And he describes
both by these tokens.

The tokens of a good and faithful bishop be these.
j. The husband of one wife. ij. Sobre. iij. Discrete. iiij. Lowely and meke.
v. A keeper of hospitalyte. vj. Apt to teach. vij. No dronkerd. viij. No fighter
/ but a just dealer / hating all quarelling and contencyon. ix. Not desieros of
filthy luker / but abhorring all couetosnes. x. Not doble tunged. ^j. No young
scolar / butt holding the mystery of the faith with a pure conscience.
False hypocrytes and dissemblers be these.
j. Forbydders of marriage. ij. Unthankful or unkind. iij. Geuyn to all
pleasures and riot. iiij. Proud and vayn glorros. v. Vnmercyful and cruel. vj.
Slanderers / blasphemers / seducers of other men in to errors / and suffering
themselves to be seduced. vij. Unchaste and given to all voluptuosnes. viij.
Impatient / braynles / braulers about words / froward and sensual minded. ix.
Couetos and lovers of them selves. x. Betrayers of secret council and
rass^blabbes. xj. Having a color and out ward shine of holiness / and yet
denye^g the specyal virtue and pyth thereof.
Now there is no man so blind or of ^o little wit which can not discern and
know false seducers from true preachers by these tokens / but yet because there
be many hipocrytes which pretend to be as holy and deuowt as angels through
their fylthy wyueles life / and abstynence from meats / and difference of
garments / he reproves this doctrine of theirs by name: saing that they shall
forsake the faith and the virtue and pyth of holiness. that is to say / the
rigtuosnes of faith / and that they shall teach lies and the deuyls doctrine
through hypocrisy / namely this / that marriage is unlawful and forbidden unto
certain persons. Item they shall put difference between meats and garments /
that one kind is more holy than a another. etc. And they shall affirm that these
doctrynes do conteyne in them salvation / the pyth of holiness / and the
perfeccyon of a christen man. And he says that these do turn and stopp their
ears from the truth and from the holy scripture / turning them unto vain
fables / that they shall not abide holsom doctrine nor the sweet word of our
lord Jesus christ that through faith is profitable unto true holiness / but they
shall procure them selves a multitude of masters / which shall preach unto them
after their own appetites / and that they shall dote about vayn questyons and
contencyons of words because the truth is taken from them and they shall believe
surely even luker to be holiness because they be infect and poisoned in their
hearts and minds / and they shall have but little delight or pleasure in the
doctrine of faith but put their confidence in opynions and articles inverted of
their own brains and of other men / and those shall they highly esteem even for
heavenly wisdom and true holiness. For thus does paul him self affirm unto the
thessalonyans / that god shall send them a strong and mighty blyndnes that they
shall believe lies and that all which believe not the truth and the holsom word of
our lord Jesus christ / shall be damned. he says also that they shall have
delyght and pleasure in vnrigtuosnes that is to say they shall think them selves
saved by those things which have no virtue of salvation in them / namely by the
works of their own hands which are not confyrmed by the word of god but only
by false and lying miracles. Such do not harke^ unto the angels singyng glory
be unto god above / and peace delyght and joy unto men in the earth etc. For
they can not delight them selves upon this infant / because he is simple
miserable / abject / and disfigured with the cross of affliccion / for they
think luker to be holiness / they seek riches and high empyres or kyngdoms /
they give no ear unto god speaking from heaven. This is my dearly beloved
son in whom I delight / but they delight in other things than in him / in
whom god would us to delight and rejoice. And there for paul bids us toshunne
them / saing / that they ought not to he herd / and that no man ought to
dispute or reason with them / but that we ought to fle from them as from an
infectuos canker / and to stop our ears at their bablyng and capcyos disceyght
full words and folissh and wicked questyons / and he will not suffer us to move
one hear bread out of the scripture to cople or reason with the^ / but to
resist and withstand them with the holy scripture / for he says. But thou
stand fast in those things which thou have learned and in those things which are
committed unto the / remembri^g of whom thou have learned them and that euersyns
thou wart a child / thou have known the holy scriptures which be able to make
the perfyghtly learned / through faith / unto the saluacyo^ which is in christ
Jesus / for as much as all scripture inspired by god / is profitable to teach /
and to reprove. etc. And paul reasons thus. A bishop ought to resist his
aduersarys with that lerni^g whereby he may be enstruct in the doctrine of
faith / eschew the doctrines of the deuel / and save both himself and his
hearers. But the holy scripture is such lerning / where for he ought to resist
by the holy scripture. which reason he proves by the propertys of a good and
faithful preacher. For the property says he of a true teacher is either.

To teach / to improve false doctrine to amend and edyfye / or to instruct in
rightwisnes.

For / as he says / a bishop must be apt to teach and to reprove the
aduersarys of the faith / and he must be such one as must be myghtie and also
able to conuynce them that be aduersaris to the truth / and further more such
as err through ignorance or infirmytie / they must reform them in to the right
way / finally it is necessary for childern to be norisshed with milk and
gentle instruccyons. Now if the holy scriptures be sufficyent to teach and
instruct perfyghtly / tha^ it must needs follow that all things necessary unto
salvation may be taught out of them. And again if they be sufficient to
co^uynce them which resist the truth or fight against the articles of the faith
and uphold the deuels doctrynes / tha^ it must follow also / that all heresis
may be confuted by them / and that they lie abhominably which imagyne a new
vnwrttto^ word for that cause. And this refuge or excuse to say that although
the scripture be profitable for such things / yet it is not sufficye^t. That is
false says paul / For I affirm / says he / that the holy scriptures do teach
us abundantly all things / whereby a man of god that is to say a christen man /
may be perfight and apt or ready unto all goodness. and thus it follows also /
that they teach lies which affirm any works to be good / that are not
contained in the scripture.

Now the other part of his reason he proves thus. Those which follow foliss^
questyons / contencyons of words / strange old wives fables / and to be short
/ the doctrines of men not contained in the word of god / do swerve and err
from the faith and are ungodly wiked hypocrites / wherefore if thou stand fast by
the holy scriptures and wade no further than they teach the / thou shall save
both thy self and also them which hear the from this capcyos snare and
suttelty of the deuel. Specially if thou will monissh the christen brethern
both of the holsom doctryn and also of the deuels erronios doctrine / as it
becomes a faithful minister of Jesus christ. Preach and teach these things
says he / to all faithful men / namely to such as may be apt to teach other
likewys. And again / If thou put them in reme^bera^ce of these things /
thou shall be a faithful minister of Jesus christ / brought up in the word of
faith and of the true doctrine which thou have followed until this day. But se
that thou banisch and contemn all unholy and old wyuissh fables / and rather
exercise thy self unto virtue and godliness. Take deligent head to thy self and
to thy doctrine and stand fast in it / for so doi^g thou shall save both
thiself and them that hear the. Afterward he gives him a commandment and says
this precept do I charge the with O son timothy / acordinge to the prophecies
that be past before thy days / that thou fight a good battle in the^ / with a
sure perfight faith and a good or right up conseyence / which / certain not
regarding have suffered great harm and loss in their faith etc. And even in
these words he teaches us to fight against the deuel even with the old
prophecy or prophetical scripture / and to confirm our faith by it and also to
form and rule our conscience by it. And he shows a cause / for else we shall
lose our faith as other have done / and we shall procure our selves a wavering
and a dowtful conscience. Finally he is not content and satisfied to have given
him this monicyon / but he also entreats and besechith him by all means /
saing I beseech the for gods sake and for our lord Jesus christ's sake which
shall judge both quick and dead at his coming / and for his kingdoms sake /
preach the word / be instant / be ernest and importune in season and out of
season / reprove / chide / and exhort with gentilnes or sobrenes and with
doctrine. For the time shall come wha^ me^ shall not suffer the holsom doctrine /
but they shall procure the^ selves masters acordi^g to their own affeccions and
appetices etc. This time which he speaks of hear / if it be not now / let us
never look for it. For now our faith is confirmed with a vnwritto^ word with
ma^s tradicyons / with custom / ceremonis / fathers and cowncels with out any
word of god / and the manifest scripture is moked out with every crafty
hipocrites Imaginacion and gloss. yea it is taken out of our hands and burnt.
Now if these men be not lovers of them selves and estemers of their own wisdom
/ if they be not couetos / if they be not arrogant and vain glorios / if they
be not braggers and blasphemers / which ymagin a new vnwritto^ word / if they
be not dissobedient and unthankful unto their parents which will not ones move
their foot out of their deanes to help an old man or to comfort their parents
lying at the point of death / if they be not unkind and unnatural which for
their feigned chastity dare not know their own childerne / if they be not truse
breakers that unmercifully war against virtue and godliness / if they be not
deuels and quarelers and the very members of the deuel / which do nothing but
ymagine cauillacyo^s to mock a way the truth / if they be not voluptuos /
ryetors / merciles neglectors of their office / despisers of all lerning and of
all true good works / if they be not traiteros betrayers of kings / kingdo^s /
and of the whole world / if they be not lovers of wordly pleasures and lusts
rather than lovers of god / which condemn matrimony lest they should be
compelled to mary wives / but might still live in whordome with other men's
wives / if they deny not the virtue / pyth and effect of godliness / and that
under a color and pretense of true holiness which esteem man's traditions higher
than the.x. commandmentes of god / and teach that their own tradicyons and
ceremonys be sufficient to make a perfight christian man that they may minissh
and drown the iustyficacio^ of faith / there were never none such nor never
shall be.

Paul when he should take his last vale of the church or congregation and bid
them farewell for ever / he called a cowncel whose auctoryte and testimony he
would have to be esteemed and regarded of all men / and in that council he
preached thus unto the bishops. I take you all to witness / and testifye unto
you all this day that y am innocent pure and clear from the blood of you all /
for I have kept secret from you none of those things which concern your
profyght and salvation / but I have opened unto you all the council of god for
the space of.iij. years / day and night without ceasing and I monisshed and
exhorted every one of you even with weping tears. For I know right well that
after my departing there shall come among you ravening wolves which shall have no
pyty or compassyon up on the flock / and certain among you shall teach false and
wicked doctrine to allure discyples after them / Wherefore take diligent head
both unto your self and to all your floke / and watch / remembryng that I have
monysshed you of these things / for the space of.iij. year together with great
lamentacyo^. And now brethern / I commit you unto the word of his grace which
is able to edifye you and to give you an inherytance with all them that be
sanctified. etc.

Here does paul monissh the council of the false and lying prophets and he
exhorts the whole church that they remember diligently his monicyon where of
he had put them in remembera^ce continually for the space of.iij. years that
they should take heed of those wolves which had devoured both bodis and souls
of men with wicked doctrine / opinions and tradicions which they would thrust in
to the church under this color and cloak / that the apostles could not teach
all things necessary unto our faith and salvation / and that all the articles
of the christen faith are not contained in the word of the grace of god. I have
taken you to record this day / says he / For this cause that if ye cast a way
and damn your selves through bileuing their persuasions / I am pure and clear
from your blood / and christ shall not reken unto me your damnacyon. For I know
that this thing will come to pass and I tremble and shake / every joint of me /
for the miserable perturbacyons and aduersites of the church wha^ the
prophecies which speak of the latter days / come to my remembrance. And I
feared lest christ should reken it unto me vnd lay it unto my charge / if I
should not have monished you before.

And this thing with the horrible blasphemys and Idolatry which shall opresse
the church / has made me so heavy and careful / and has caused me to water
mine eyes so often. But what shall I do when I hear danyel sayng. The
determinacion is concluded: I can no notherwise do than monissh you that ye
hear or receive no new opynions under any such cloak or color as though I had
not opened unto you all the council of god somoch as perteyneth un to you to
know / or as though I had hidden any thing from you which should be necessary
unto your salvation. I can not tell what to say more / but only to commit and
refer you unto the word of the grace of god / that is to say / to the holy
scriptures which all are able to edifye and to bilde you upon the true
foundation which is christ / whereupon the whole church / all the patriarckes /
prophets and apostles be bylded and grounded / Christ is the foundation of the
church we be the stones and stikes which are proved and assayed with diverse
tentacio^s and aflictions / The holy ghost is the master bylder or worck man /
and the word of god is the clay and lyme which holds the whole bildi^g to
gether. For by the word of god we are incorporate unto the church / and by it
we abide and remayn in the church. This word also incorporateth joins / and
groundeth us perfightly to christ / that we should not be drawn away and led
about with every blasing wynd of doctrine and so fall a way again. This is a
good bucler against all the fiery darts of the deuel. This is the stern
whereby alone / the ship of the church is ruled. This is the anchor which ones
broken or lost / our faith must needs utterly perissh. To this word peter
bids us look as unto a lantern which in the dark night of ignorance / of the
contempt of god of infidelite and of all weakness of such hearts as be blinded
of the deuel shows the light of faith and the knouledge of gods will that we
fall to no heresis nor receive the doctrine of the false lying prophets. And
by this light which chaseth a way all darkness of errors / Christ and Peter
command us to examen and try all manner of doctrine as by the true toche stone.
And Paul bids us ronn unto this in all storms as unto the most sure anckar
/ and to resist or withstand all manner of strange doctrines with the holy
scripture / and Christ does plainly pronounce that by this we shall be judged at
the last day. John writes / this to be sufficient to obtain ever lasting life
by. And christ sends the man which enquired of him by what means he might be
saved / unto this scripture / which luke says that he has writton with all
dyligence. Esaias sent them which sought new reuelacions unto this word / Christ
also sent them which required miracles unto this: saing They have Moses and
the prophets if they will not believe them / neither would they bylefe if any
should rise from death. By this word does Moses command kings to fear god /
and he bids the pristes to judge by this word / and at last he says / let
this word be writo^ out to you before your eyes / that no man may be excused of
ignorance / and he says further / that heaven and earth shall witness against us
at the latter day / that we give over our selves again freely / willingly and
wetingly unto the deuel / if we receive any doctrine not approved by the word
of god / or if we judge and determyne any thing of the will and pleasure of god
without some testymony of the holy scripture. Now these testimonys gathered out
of the holy scripture be sufficient against this gross blasphemy of the
vnwritton word.
