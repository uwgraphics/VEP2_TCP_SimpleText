To the Reader.
THere was upon a time an odd Country Riming Fellow, whose name was Cobbe:
where he dwelt, I find not; and what he was, it skils not: Only this I note
of him, that it seems by the Memorial I have of him, that he was in his time,
as (no doubt are many now adays) given to look so far above the Moon, that
as falling through the Clouds, when he wak't, he knew not where he was: but
strange things he had in his head, which he set down as oddely in writing:
where if you look for verse, you are out; if for Rhyme, you are in: now, if you
take delight in old idle Prophecies, strange Signs and Tokens, though they
never come to pass, and to read now and than of many a strange Madrigall
here you may have change to fit your choice; how they will fall fit with your
humor I know not, and therefore this is all I will say to you. I know the Book
Seller will say. What lack you, and I say, I wish all may like you; so, till I
see you, though I know you not when I meet you, to the Lord of heaven I leave
you.

Your well willer as to all honest Men. Richard Rablet.

COBBES PROPHECIES, HIS MADRIGALS, SIGNS, AND TOKENS.
WHen fashions make men's Bodies,
And wits are ruled by Noddies:
When Fools grow rich by fortune,
And wife must fools importune.
When Greyhounds must cry crauen,
And Mastiue Dogs must raven:
When Faulcons stoop to carren,
And Poulcats spoil the warren.
The Sun does leave his shining,
The Moon is in declining:
The Stars are ouer-shrouded,
The Sky is ouer-clouded.
The Air is all infected,
The Plague yet not respected:
No Charity nor pity,
In Country, nor in City.
The virtuous all disgraced,
The famous all defaced:
And rascal kind of people,
Shall look above Paul's steeple:
When Nightingales are scorned,
And Cuckoes are adorned.
And Black-birds leave their whistle,
And perch upon a Thistle:
And Oats are sown and gathered,
And Children are strange fathered.
And Swannes do loose their feathers,
While Geese fortell foul weathers:
When Horses tug at Cables,
While Asses keep the Stables.
When Virgins wait on whoores,
And Knights keep Beggars doors:
And Iackes like Knights shall Iet it,
Because their purses get it,
When Noble-minded Spirits,
Can have no hope of Merits;
But either quite discarded,
Or slenderly rewarded:
When Owls, and Apes, and Asses,
Shall pranke themselves in Glasses.
While better kind of Creatures,
Of far more dainty Natures,
Shall clad in cloth of lether,
To hold out wind and wether.
When Scholars mock their Teachers,
And Lay men laugh at Preachers:
And woodcockes learn of wizards,
To play the doting dizards.
When foul flaps shall be painted,
And fair paps shall be tainted,
And patience must content her,
That no man will lament her:
But all things topsie-turuy,
Do prove the world so scuruy,
That honestmen abhor it,
Why? then, who will care for it?
But, that no such ill season,
Where truth may dye by treason.
The wicked fool may flourish,
While none the good will nourish:
Or Earth be seen or heard,
To make the world afeard:
Pray all good hearts with me,
That it may never be.
WHen lack of grace turns good to evil,
And men leave God to serve the Devil:
And young men follow imperfections,
And old men dote in ill affections.
When Beauty is a bait of sinning,
While wanton threads, make wicked spinning,
And wealth does only breed ambition,
When Nature shows an ill condition.
And baseness buys the Badge of Honor,
While Wisdom weeps to look upon her;
When learning teaches but illusion,
Where fancies study but confusion.
When power is seen buti n oppression,
While conscience makes no sins confession:
When Lechery is Natures sollace,
And Robbery is Reasons purchase.
When peace does breed an ill security,
Where pleasure lives but in impurity,
When simple virtue is disdained,
And subtle vice is entertained:
If such a time should ever be,
That, I hope, never man shall see.
That so the wicked fiende should rage,
In every course of every age;
That lack of Grace should think it good,
To live upon the fruit of blood;
While Spirits careless of salvation,
Will headlong run unto damnation:
Pray to the Lord of heaven to mend it,
Or in his mercy, quickly end it.
When Tradesmen take no Money,
Nor Varmin hunt a Cony:
Old Mumpsie is no Meacocke,
Nor his proud Minckes a Peacocke.
The Soldier is not bloody,
His Ostesse is not muddy;
The Usurer not greedy,
The rich relieve the needy:
The Courtier is not haughty,
His Courtizan not naughty.
The wantons leave their winking,
The damned crew their drinking:
The Geese do leave their grazing,
And idle eyes their gazing:
Dame Parnell is no pratler,
Her parasite no flatterer:
The Chapmen leave their buying
And Sellers leave their lying.
The Skipper leaves his sailing,
The Oyster-wiues their railing;
The Farmer leaves his tillage,
The Beggar leaves the village.
When Snudges leave their sparing,
And Coseners leave their snaring:
When Thieves do leave their robbing,
And heavy hearts their throbbing:
When proud men leave their spighting,
And Poets leave their biting:
When Children leave their crying,
And old men leave their dying;
Strange will be the alteration,
Or else, a consummation.
When Ships do sail against the wind,
And Nature goes against her kind:
And tongues must say that black is white,
While mad men make a day of night:
When Reason must subscribe to will,
To leave the good and take the ill.
When Conscience sits and blows the cole,
While Patience lives on pitties dole:
And Wisdom shall be poor and bare,
While folly lights on Fortunes share;
And learning does but break the brain,
While bare Experience gets the gain:
And love is played on follies Stage,
Twixt Youth, and Ages marriage.
And Avarice with ielous eyes,
Does live in grief, while pleasure dies:
And man becomes but Moneys Slave,
While Virtue lives in Honors Grave;
When Nature thus does change her course,
From good to bad, from ill to worse.
And, hope of mendment will be small,
When thus the Devil works in all:
If ever man should live to know
The wailefull time of so much woe:
As God forbid should ever be,
That Ear should hear, or Eye should see:
Then hearty prayers would do well,
For saving of the Soul from Hell.
When the Fisherman drownes the Eele,
And the Hare bites the Huntsman by the heel:
When the Geese do drive the Fox into his hole,
And the Thistle ouertops the May Pole.
The Hering is at war with the Whale,
And the Drunkard forsweares a pot of Ale:
When the Lawyers plead all for pity,
And conscience is the Ruler of a City;
When the parson will his Tithes forgo,
And the Parish will pay him, will, or no.
When the Usurer is weary of his gain,
And the Farmer feeds the poor with his grain:
The Oyster leaves gaping for the tide,
And Lob. lolly will not dance with his Bride.
When Prentizes had rather work then play,
And Scholars cannot away with a holy day:
When brabbles and quarrels all cease,
And Armies yield their Armies to peace;
And peace such a power has won,
That Soldiers serve all with a Potgun.
When the Fletcher falls out with the Bolt,
And the wise must make cursie to a Dolt,
When the Night is brighter then the Day,
And the Clouds drive the wind away.
When the Snow and the Frost are fire hot,
And the Costermongers Apples will not rot:
When the Ass shall make Music to the Owl,
And the Slut will not wear her clothes foul.
When the Ship shall throw away her sail,
And the Dog shall leave wagging of his tail;
And the Rabbets shall run through the Hey,
And the Varmin makes the Warriner run away:
When the Cat is afraid of the Mouse,
And the Beggar will walk without a Louse.
When Connies do Castles undermine,
And Lords must wait while Lobcockes dine:
And rich men weep, and Beggars sing,
And every Knave will be a King.
Until the Gallows, or the Whip,
Do take a Villain in a Trip:
When all things thus do come to pass,
That by an Ox, and by an Ass;
The question shall decided be,
Why Dogs and Cats cannot agree.
When Mowles and Worms do look abroad,
And Snakes do combat with the Toade:
The Fleyes will not abide the sheets,
Nor idle people walk the streets,
When thus the world does come about
Within the course of Colin Clout:
Which never man I hope shall see,
God knows what then the world will be.
WHen the Winter to Summer turns,
The Fire cooles, and the water burns;
When the Fly put the Eagle to her flight,
And the day holds a Candle to the night:
When the trees bend down to the bushes,
And the Owl drives the Nightingale to hushes:
When the Hare falls to play with the Hound,
And the Worm scorns to creep into the ground;
When the Aspe with the Wolf makes a fray,
And the Mouse makes the Cat run away.
When the Owl teaches the Parrat to speak,
And the Goose makes the Gander to keake:
When the Market Cross is without Corn,
And not a house will yield a man a horn.
When the Clouds command the wind to be still,
And the Valley will ouertop the hill:
When the Storke is afraid of the Frog,
And the Cur runs away from the Hog.
When the Beggars will leave the high way,
And wantons will give over play;
When a Moris-dance is without a fool,
And a fool be without a Ladle and a tool:
When rich wares will be at low rate,
And a City will run out at the Gate:
The Sailer cannot away with a merry gale,
And the Constable is afraid of a pot of Ale.
When the Goose is mistaken for the Swan,
And the Goodwifeknowes not her good Man;
If the world were come to such a change,
The alteration would be very strange:
But rather then all should go so amiss,
Better be content with it, as it is.
When the day and the night do meet,
And the houses are even with the street:
And the fire and the water agree,
And blind men have power to see:
When the Wolf and the Lamb live together,
And the blasted trees will not wither.
When the flood and the ebb run one way,
And the Sun and the Moon are at a stay;
When Age and Youth are all one,
And the Miller creepes through the Millstone:
When the Ram butts the Butcher on the head,
And the living are buried with the dead.
When the Cobbler does work without his eends,
And the Cutpurse, and the Hangman are friends:
Strange things will then be to see,
But I think it will never be.
When the wind is always in one place,
All Horses are of one Race:
And all Men are in one case.
When all words have but one sense,
All Cases are in one tence;
And all Purses have but one expense.
When all hands do fit one Glove,
All hearts have but one Love:
And all Birds be but one Dove.
When all wit is in one head,
And all Corn makes but one bread;
And all ease is in one bed.
When all Truth is in one heart,
And all Knowledge is in one art,
And all Divisions are in one part.
When all sport is in one play,
When all feasts are in one day:
And all States are at one stay.
When all faces have but one feature,
And all Spirits are of one Nature;
And all worth is in one Creature.
Such wonders will be then to see,
As out of doubt will never be.
WHen there is nothing but sorrow and care,
And the fields are all barren and bare;
And the Beggars have a miserable share.
When the Markets are horrible dear,
There is nothing to drink, but small beer:
And the rich men keep beggarly cheer.
When the Children are bawling and crying,
And old folks are swearing and lying:
And sick folks are sighing and dying.
When Baiard is down in the mire,
And the fat is all in the fire:
When love has lost his desire.
When Masters do fall into rages,
And Servants are unpaid their wages;
And all their best clothes are in gages.
If ever it should come about,
To put the Cocks eyes clean out
And then hope to revel and rout.
Which I hope never to see,
But where all fair Gamsters be;
Good fellows will kindly agree.
God knows, for I cannot tell,
Who then goes to Heaven or to Hell.
When Preachers have loving Auditors,
And Borrowers have kind Creditors:
When Suitors petitions have comfortable reading,
And Forma pauperis has a favorable pleading.
When love is the whole rule of life,
And the Good man loves none but his own wife,
When there is no spleen, nor any spite,
But every one keeps his own right:
When all is as plain as the highway,
And all goes by yea, and by nay.
And one man so well loves another,
That there is nofalse Sister nor Brother,
No facing, frowing, nor fighting,
But one in another delighting;
No odds twixt the Groom and the Bride,
No envy, nor malice, nor pride.
No punishment, but for offenses,
No care, but all for expenses.
No time spent, but all business,
Nor sleeping, but all in heaviness:
No iarring, but all in jesting,
No friendship, but all in feasting.
No lawing, brabling, nor bribing,
No kind of scoffing, nor gibing;
No painting of ill-fauored faces,
Nor seeking of true loves disgraces:
No tale, but well worth the telling,
Nor savor, but well worth the smelling.
No Act, but well worth the doing,
No Wench, but well worth the woing;
If such a time were happily come,
To prove this true in all, or some;
Who would not joy in har^ to see,
And pray it might so ever be.
WHen toies and trifles stand for treasure,
And pain mistaken stands for pleasure:
When lust mistaken is for love,
A lack-daw for a Turtle-doue.
When Craft is taine for Honesty,
Hypoorisie, for Piety;
And babbling held for eloquence,
And baseness stands for excellence:
When truth shall be esteemed a jest,
And he that's rich, is only blessed.
While all the virtues of the mind,
Do all go whirling down the wind.
And brain spun thread shall be esteemd,
And Wisdom little worth be deemd:
And flatterers shall stand for friends,
To bring but fools to idle ends:
When nothing shall be well begun,
But crossed, or spoild ere it be done.
And every where the bad for good,
Shall be too much misunderstood;
While wilful folly should rejoice,
In making of a wicked choice:
And true discretion grieve to see,
In what a case the cursed be;
If such a time was never such,
Should come to curse the world so much:
As God forbid it should be so,
That Man should so much sorrow know;
That Devils so should play their parts,
Then up to Heaven with honest hearts.
WHen seven Geese follow one Swan,
And seven Cats lick in one pan:
When seven Iack-dawes follow one Crow,
And seven Archers shoot in one Bow.
When seven Cities make but one State,
And seven houses have but one Gate:
When seven Armies make but one Camp,
And seven States have but one stamp:
When seven Scholars have but one gown,
And seven Lordships, make but one town.
When seven Swagrers have but one Punck,
And seven trauailers have but one truncke.
When seven Horses saddle one Mare,
And seven Pedlers have but one pack of ware:
When seven Hackney Men have but one Jade,
And seven Cutlers have but one Blade;
When seven Butchers have but one staule,
And seven Cobblers, have but one aule:
When seven rivers have but one Fish,
And seven Tables have but one Dish.
When seven Lawyers plead but one case,
And seven Painters work upon one face:
When seven Ditties have but one Note,
And seven Fiddlers have but one Grote.
When seven Guls have but one throat,
And seven Truls, have but one peticoat;
If by the number thus of seven,
The one do make the odd full even:
That, in the sense of the conceit,
The seven to one do make up eight.
It seems not strange, yet unto me
It Is strange, now eeuen and odd agree:
Yet when it falls, it is no deceit,
That seven and one do make up eight.
When the Hen crows,
Then the Cock knows
what work must be done,
And when the wind blows,
Then the Sailer knows
what course must be run.
When the Mill goes,
Then the Miller knows
what Fish are a flote:
And when the tide flows,
Then the Water-man knows,
what to do with his Boat.
When the Grass grows.
Then the Mower knows,
what to do with his Sith:
And when the Farmer sowes,
Then the Parson knows
he shall have a Tithe.
When the Buckes take the Does,
Then the Warriner knows,
there are Rabbets in breeding:
And when the Bag shows,
Then the Milke-maid knows
the Cow has good feeding.
WHen the day peepeth,
And the Husbandman sleeps,
he loses the gain of the morning;
But when the Ducke quaketh,
And Sim his Susan waketh,
take heed of working for horning.
When the Bell righeth,
And Robin-redbrest sings,
up maids and make clean your Dairy;
But if ye lie and stretch ye,
Until the lazy catch ye,
take heed that ye meet not the Fairy.
When the Cow loweth,
And Cocke-a-doodle croweth,
up maids and put on your raiment:
For if ye keep your beds
Till ye loose your maiden heads,
take heed of a forty weeks payment.
But when the Star shoots,
And the Owl hooteth,
to bed then and take your ease:
But when ye would rest,
Take heed in your nest,
ye find not worse varmin then fleas.
When the Dog howleth,
And your Dame scowleth,
then wenches take heed of foul weather:
But when the Mouse peepeth,
And your Dame sleeps,
then laugh and be merry together.
When the Watch walks,
And at the door talks,
Lads and Guirles, look to your doors;
Then to bed roundly,
And sleep there as soundly,
as if ye were all knaves and whores.
When a man is old,
And the wether blows cold,
well fare a fire and a fur'd Gown:
But when he is young,
And his blood new sprung,
his sweet heart is worth half the Town.
When a Maid is fair,
In her smock and hair,
who would not be glad to woe her:
But when she goes to bed,
To loose her maidenhead,
how kindly her Good Man goes to her.
When the Grass does spring,
And the Birds gin to sing,
take heed of St. Valentines day;
Least while ye rejoice,
In lighting on your choice,
ye make not ill work before May.
When the Sun shines bright,
And the Day is light,
then Shepherds abroad with your flocks:
But if the Heyfer play,
And the Heard be away,
take heed the Bull prove not an Ox.
When the Corn is ripe,
And the Straw makes a pipe,
then to it with the Sith and the Sickle:
But when ye make the stacke,
If ye lie on your back,
take heed how ye laugh till ye tickle.
When the Apples fall,
And the Patridges call,
Then Farmers have home with your Corn:
But when ye make your Mowes,
Take heed to your Cowes,
they bear not a sheafe on a horn.
When the trees do bud,
And the Kids chew the cud,
then fall to your digging and sowing:
But if you seed be naught,
Or your work be ill wrought;
then blame not the ground for ill growing.
When the Sun is down,
And the Guests come to town,
long trauailers lightly are weary.
But if mine Oste be a good fellow,
And mine Ostesse be not yellow;
who then would not laugh and be merry.
IN the month of May,
Is a pretty play,
is called youths wooing;
But long it will not last,
For when that May is past,
there will be no doing.
For love is so quick,
He stands on a prick,
that likes no delaying:
For idle excuses,
Are but lues abuses,
that mar all the Maying.
The squint of an eye,
May often look awry,
in fancies new fashion:
But wink and shake the head,
And the color once dead,
there is the true passion.
When the eye reedeth,
How the heart bleedeth,
in silence true tears:
Then easily may the mind,
If that it be not blind,
see what the spirit bears.
For passions staid looks,
Are Truths only books,
where kindness best reedeth;
The time and the place,
In beauties best grace,
how love ever speedeth.
When the time of the year,
Does call for good cheer,
why should we not laugh and be merry;
When a Cup of good Sack,
That hurts not the back,
will make the cheeks red as a Cherry.
When the thread is all spun,
And the work is all done,
why should not the work-folkes go play:
When a pot of good Ale,
And a merry old tale,
would pass the time smoothly away.
When the Meadows are grown,
And the Grass abroad thrown,
for shame give the wench a green gown;
But when the Harvest is in,
And the Bread in the Bin,
then, Piper play laugh and lie down.
When my Dame falls to Bake
A Pudding and a Cake,
will make cheer in Bowls;
But when the Oil of Malt,
Makes the heels for to halt,
take heed of your lop heavy Nowles.
IN the old time,
When an odde-pumpe rhyme,
would have made a Dog laugh:
And the Ostesse of the Swan,
Would swinge her good Man,
with a good quarter staff.
When more then a good many,
Had nine Eggs a penny,
and Corn was six pence a strike;
Then true blind devotion,
Brought such to promotion.
As never I hope will be like.
When the Catkild the Mouse,
And the Dog kept the house,
and all was wholesome and cleanely;
And John and his Ioane,
Did live of their own,
full merrily, though but all meanly.
When Beef, Bread and Beer,
Was honest men's cheer,
and welcome and spare not:
And the Man kissed the Maid,
And was not afraid,
come who will I care not.
When right should have reason,
In time, place and season,
and Truth was believed;
When these things did go thus,
Which Truth does not show us,
the Charity flourisht:
When love and good Nature
In every Creature,
a kind Spirit nourisht.
But if that it were so,
As many do fear no,
that some were sore blinded;
What ever the cause was,
It Is now at another pass,
men are otherwise minded.
For such as have proved,
What is to beloved,
will ever be heedfull:
That nothing be wanting,
Though somewhat be scanting,
to comfort the needful.
And therefore no matter,
How ere fools do flatter,
their wits with their will;
I wish the time present,
In all true contentment,
to stay with us still.
IF the day were as long as the year,
And the Gossips were making good cheer,
they would think the time were but short:
But if they fall to brawling and scolding,
And the Beggats be at the upholding,
oh there would be delicate sport.
If the Apples were once in the fire,
Each Gossip had her pot by her,
and every one to her tale:
And the Wife that went once for a maid,
Would tell what tricks she had played,
oh there would be work for whole sale.
If the Wine once did work in the brain,
And the Wenches were right in the vain,
then talk of the reckoning to morrow;
Let Husbands take care for their wives,
And Gossips make much of their lives,
they are fools that will dye for sorrow.
IT was my hap of late by chance,
oh pretty chance;
To meet a Country Moris-dangce,
oh pretty dance.
When cheifest of them all the fool,
oh pretty fool:
Played with a Ladle and a tool,
oh pretty tool:
When every Younker shook his Bells,
oh pretty Bells;
Till sweating feet, gave fohing smells,
oh fohing smells.
And fine Maide-Marian with her smoile,
oh pretty smoile:
Showed how a Rascal played the Roile,
oh pretty Roile.
But when the Hobbyhorse did wihy,
oh pretty wihy;
Then all the Wenches gave a tihy,
oh pretty tihy.
But when they began to shake their Box,
oh pretty Box:
And not a Goose could catch a Fox,
oh pretty Fox.
The Piper then put up his pipes,
oh pretty pipes;
And allthe Woodcoks looked like Snipes,
oh pretty Snipes.
And therewith fell a showry stream,
oh pretty stream:
That I awakt out of my dream,
oh scuruy dream.
Signs and Tokens.
When Charing-Crosse and Paul's Church meet,
And break their fast in Friday street:
When Ware and Waltham go to Kent
Together, there to purchase Rent.
When Islington and Lambeth join,
To make a voyage to the Groine:
And Southwarke with St. Katherines gree,
To ride in post to Couentry:
When Turmele-street and Clarken-well,
Have sent all Bawdes and Whores to Hell:
And Long-ditch, and Long-lane do try,
Antiquities for honesty;
And Newgate weeps, and Bridewell greeues,
For want of Beggars, Whores, and Thieves.
And Tyburne does to Wapping swear,
Shall never more come Hangman there:
When blind men see, and dumb men read,
Which seems impossible indeed.
And by all rules that I can see,
I think in truth will never be.
Then, then ye may say then,
Knaves now will be honest men.
When Youth and Beauty meet together,
there is work for Breath;
But when they both begin to wither,
there is work for Death.
When Love and Honor work together,
there is work for Fame;
But when they both begin to wither,
there is work for shame.
When Hope and Labor go together,
there is work for gain,
But when they both begin to wither,
there is work for pain.
When Wit and Virtue work together,
their work goes well;
But when they both begin to wither,
there is work for Hell.
Let then perfections live together,
and work for praise.
For when their work begins to wither,
their worth decaies.
IF all Rules of Physic,
Had only help for the Tisicke;
And all Chirurgeries ground,
Were for the healing of one wound.
And all kind of preaching,
Were but for one Parish teaching,
And all kind of diet,
To keep one tongue in quiet.
And all kind of pleasures,
Were but for one man's treasures;
And all kind of learning,
Were for one points discerning;
And all kind of disputing,
Were fore one points confuting.
And all kind of writing,
Were for one man's delighting:
If there should be such a season,
All so to go against reason;
Which I think never to see,
Let them that know think what will be,
When the Rich are all agreed,
On the purses of the poor to feed:
And the wise men find out fools Lands,
To get them all into their hands.
And Wenches have tricks with their eyes,
To catch men, as Candles do Flies:
And Swagrers make the highway,
The cheifest part of their stay.
When Bawds and Whores study the Art,
To escape the Whip and the Cart;
And Cut-pursses all take their oaths,
To keep the Hangman in clothes.
When thus the Devil does lurk,
To fall with the world to his work:
Which would be a greatsorrow to see,
Pray, that it may never be.

Cobs talk with Wisdom.
COme Wisdom, let me speak with thee
a word or two,
Some blessed Lesson read to me
what I shall do:
What say thou? First, that Christ his Cross
must be my speed:
My labor else would be but loss,
what are I read.
With Alpha then I must begin
to find a friend:
To lead me from the way of sin
to comforts end;
And in Omega read the last
of all my love,
Wherein my soul all sorrow past,
her joy may prove:
I must not sin, I cannot choose,
ah woe is me,
To take the ill and good refufe,
through want of thee.
In Youth I scorned thine advice,
now I am old,
I hold thy counsel in more price
then purest Gold:
Thou readst me patience, I confess
it eases pain,
But little hope yet of redress,
thereby I gain:
Thou readst me penitence for sin,
with sorrows smart,
Oh there the sorrow does begin
that wounds my heart.
Thou readst me hope to heal my wound,
with sorrows tears;
But conscience makes my heart to swound,
with sorrows fears:
Thou readst me Faith, to hold my Hope
on Mercies Grace,
But when that Faith the gate would open,
fear hides my face.
Thou readst me love, the line of life
that leads to bliss;
But hateful sin has wrought the strife,
where no love is.
Thou readst me Truth yet in the word,
that fails no trust:
But it does only Grace afford
unto the just.
Thou readst me Mercy, yet will heal
the wounded heart:
To Mercy then let me appeal,
to cure my smart.
And with true faithful penitence,
to sorrow so;
That Hope with happy patience,
to Heaven may go:
And there with Joy at Mercies gate
receive that Grace,
Where never Soul that thou do hate,
may have a place.
FINIS.
