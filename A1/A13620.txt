IMPRINTED AT London in Fleete-streete by Thomas Marshe. 1581 Cum Priuilegio.

NICOLAI VDALLI CARMEN ENDECA syllabum ad libellum suum.
SI certum est tibi pertinax libelle,
In multas hominum manus venire,
Doctorumque libet subire nasum,
Sannas, verbera, iurgium cachinnos:
Per me fit tibi liberum vagari,
I quocunque voles tuo periclo,
Securus poteras domi latere,
Et mecum poteras manner tutus*
Nunc es publicus, haud meus libellus,
Nec possum tibi iam patrocinari,
Nec suffragia, gratiamque vulgi,
Aut vitam, geniumque polliceri.
Orbis sed tibi, multitudinisque
Standum iudicio, vel est cadendum.
NICOLAVS VDALLVS SVAVISSIMO DIScipulorum suorum gregi, salutem plurimam dicit.
QVANQVAM INItio quidem, vt ingenue fatear non mea voluntate ad hane docendi
prouinciam capessenda^ inductus, sed pertinacissimis eisdemque importunissimis
amicorum quorundam solicitationibus efflagitationibusque compulsus, partim,
nescio quo meo fato protrusus videri poteram: nunc tamen, postquam egregia
quorundam vestrum indoles, luculentam sane minimeque dubitatam spem ostendit,
fore aliquando, vt ad insignem aliquam eruditionem euadatis, ^a^tum abest, vt
me instituti, coeptique poeniteat vt nihil profecto, hodie prius habeam, aut
antiquius. Quapropter quam sort, nactus sum spartam, ornare (prout Graecorum
prouerbium admonet) mihi proposui, planeque constitutum habeo superis been
iuuantibus, in hanc gnauiter curam incumbere, insigniterque in eo elaborare, vt
vos ex immanissimis barbariei faucibus quamprimum eripiam, atque ex tenebrosa
abstrusaque inscitiae caligine vindicem, ad politioris literaturae puritatem,
lucem, claritudinem. Nec dici mehercule potest, quanto desiderio flagrem,
quantaque quum omnium qui literis sunt dediti, tum vestris duntaxat honest is
and rectis studijs proficiendi cupiditate ardeam. Iam inde enim ab co tempore,
quo ^n meam vos scholam and disciplinam recepi, parentis erga vos animum
induisse me fateor, semperque existimasse, in corundem me locum succedere, a
quibus traditi mihiad instituendu estis-Quod cum ita sit, vt est, quam mihi rem
gratam and iucundam, quam porro laetabilem and gloriosam putatis fore, si vos
aliquando ad eas in disciplina vires accrescere and peruenire videro, vt
exuperatis euictisque isti^ grammaticarum praeceptionum, and rudimentorum
difficultatibus, ac velut salebris, ad iucundissimam, eandemque multo vberrimi
fructus latinorum autoxum lectionem, studium transfer valeatis. Ad hanc autem
maturitatem cum animaduerterem, non alia demum ratione perueniri posse, nisi
quis in promptu iam ante, and ad manum habeat bonam atque adeo diuitem latini
sermonis supellectilem, sedulo equidem mihi faciundum putaui, ne vobis deesset,
vn^ de ea potissime facultas parari possit, and latini sermonis copia, puritas,
niror, elegantia, nullo aut certe quam minimo negotio perdisci. Scripsi itaque
vobis suauissimi tyrunculi, quasdam latin lo* quendi formulas, ad cotidiani
sermonis vsum and copiam sane quam accommodatissimas. Eas vero ex Publij
Terentij potissimum comoedijs delegimua, quod is scriptor ad inform and am,
instruendamque linguam puerilem maxim omnium idoneus, citraque, controuersiam
facile princeps videatur: vtpote per quem, ipsum Tullium Ciceronem, summum
alioqui latinitatis magistrum* ad tantum eloquentiae fastigium profecisse
constet, id quod quum ipsemet de se fatetur alicubi, imo potios gloriatur, tum
scripta cius vbique clamitant.

Porro Latin a ipse Angelice interpretatus sum, quo vos quoque latina
vernacule, aut e contrario latin vernacula absque molestia vel negotio, and
cu^ aliqua ratione ac gratia, nec interim ineptis prorsus atque absurdis (quod
plerique faciunt) sed appositis and accommodatis verbis reddere addiscatis.
Neque vero putetis velim, nullum esse operaeprecium, si quis latina apt in
maternum ver^ere sermonem calleat. Nam si Cicero quaedam ox Graecis tam poetis,
quam oratoribus ac philosophis, latin interpreta^do quae in suos referret
libros, operaepreciu^ existimare se fecisse nonnusqua^ gloriatur: si Terentius
plus sibi laudis statuit, maioreque gloriam posuit in vertendis Graecoru^
antiquis fabulis, quam inueniendis suis nouis: si ide^ Terentius rem nihilo
minus ingeniosa^ arbitratus est, ex bonis Graecis bona latina facere, qua^ si
ipse de suo noua excogitasset scriberetque, and posteris legenda traderet: si
denique ingenij argumentu^ and no^ postremae laudis op' existimatur, bona
vernacula sic verbis latinis mutare, vt interim seruetur vtriusque linguae
idiotissimus and gratia: qui minus id quoque ^ diuerso maximae laudi dari par
sit and vel summi artificis opus haberi conueniat, ex bonis latinis ^^^* licet,
reddere bona vernacula? Verum, vt redeam quo coepi tendere, nec lusto diutius
in his haeream, imo consilij vobis factique mei rationem compendio expediam:
addidi, ^^cubi opus id esse videbatur, quaeda^ velut scholia, quibus tum sensus
poet^ explicetur, tum verba ipsapaulo declarentur apertius. Si qua insignis aut
elegans incidit metaphora, indicaui, Si qua figura occurrit, admonu^. Si qua
fabula interuenit, non sum grauatus ^ltiuscule reperitam narrare, Si quid quod
adlatinitatem egregie faceret, sese obtulit, non commisi vt praeteriretur
silentio. Si quid ad rationem grammaticam pertinere visum est, non piguit
enucleare, Si quid prouerbij interspersum est, expos^^. Si quod vocabulum
obscurius iudicatum est, illustraui. Si qua formula a communi vulgarique, and
vsitata latin loquendi ratione paulo alienior apparuit, rationem reddidi,
citatis, vbi res posceret, atque adhibitis, ex optimis quibusque and
probatissimis authoribus ex^mplis ac testimonijs. Denique vt finem tandem
faciam, quicquid vsquam obiectum est, quod pu^rile ingenium iudiciu mue
retardare in legendo posse videretur* quantumuis id humile foret aut leave,
sedulo adnotaui, vestris scilicet studijs quam optime consultum cupiens,
omnibusque omnium vestrum commodis nusquam non libentissime deseruiens. Proinde
haee quidem quae commemoraui, omnia pingui, quod dicitur, crassaque ac rudi
Minerua tradidi, and vereor, ne quo rundam opinione, iudicio, sententiaque
nimis etiam any, nimis scrupulose, nimis denique vt ita loquar frustulatim
persecutus sim: vtique dum singula ad iudicij vestriim maturitatem and captus
teneritudi^em attempero. Sed nimis mihi in hoc duntaxat negotio, placuit illud,
quod dici solet indocti^s modo apertius, presertim, cum scirem quam maxim opus
esset, nil nisi velut premansum vobis in os inseri. Porro ipsum opusculum
FLORES TERENTII libuit in scribere, quoniam hae formulae quas vobis iam
nuncupamus ex eius poetae lepidissimis iuxta atque elegantissimis comoedijs,
quasi horto quodam fragrantissimo, and ad mira^^lum vario, amaenoque topiario
ordine omnes selectae su^t and excerptae. His igitur laborum nostrorum quasi
primitijs fruimini tanquam arrabone ac pignore tu^ nostri erga vos summi amoris
^um officij, ac fidei.

Quod si prodesse haec conducereque vestris studijs intellexe^imus: alia
fauente Christo dabimus propedie^ altiora atque maiora. Vest^ae aute^ parts
erunt suauissimi tyrones, omni quod aiunt pede sta^ re, omnibus ingenij neruis
contendere, ac modis omnibus curare, ne nostros sudores labore^que frustremini,
neue nostrum hoc tantum oleum and operam eludatis, sed potius vt conceptae de
vobis tum spei tum expectationi possitis per omnia respondere.

In the second Scene.
Vereor ne grauius tulerit, I fear lest he was discontented, or, I fear that
he took the matter grievously. Grauius pro grauiter: comparatiue degree used
for the post^iue, Ex Laurentio Valla. And the comparatiue so used we qualify
by adding this somewhat: as, Paulo grauius, somewhat grievously, or,
displeasantly.

Vereot ne aliorsum atque ego feci acceperit, I fear lest he took it otherwise
the^ I did it for Aliorsu^, to an other end or purpose, or another way: and it
may be said Aliorsum atque, Aliorsu^ quam, aliorsum ac.

17 Ita res erat, Such was the case.

18 Credo misera prae a more exclusit hunc for as, I ween the poor soul, or,
poor sely woman shut him out of the doors for love. For As is used with verbes
that betoke^ going, or moving forthward, as get thee forth, Exi for as I must
go forth. Eundum est mihi for as.

Ouidius.

Ipse licet venias Musis comitatus Homere, Si nihil at^uleris* ibis Homere
for as.

Foris, to used with verbes be tokening being, or, resting in a place, abroad,
or from home: as my father is forth. Pater est foris. I have some thing to do
at home, but abroad I have no business, Est mihi domi quod agam, foris nihil est
negotij.

19 Siccine ais? Say thou so?

19 Qua gratia te huc accersi iussi ausculta, Hear now the cause why I bad you
to be gone for, or called. Accerso, is, iui, accersere, and arcesso of the
third conjugation is to go call. Denotat enim actum corporis. Ex Val. cap. 23,
lib. 1. elegantiarum, Accerso, is, iui, ire, of the fourth conjugation is to
call. Albeit, Accersio as (Valla says in the place above cyted) is oftentimes
used for Accerso. Nevertheless, Accerso does also signify to send for, or cause
to to be called, as Pater and Praeceptor accersunt te, Thy father and thy
master has sent for thee.

20 Dic mihi hoc primum, Tell me this first.

21 Potisne est hic tacere? Can this fellow keep any counsel?

22 Lege hac, On this condition.

22 Tibi meam astringo fidem, I promise you faithfully, or, by my faith.

^3 Quae vera and iui ^aceo and contineo optime, Such things as I hear true,
I can hold in, and keep secret very well Taceo and contineo, here be taken for
on thing, and the one does expound the other. For this conjunction copulative,
and is often times put for id est.

24 Sin falsum aut vanum, aut fictum est, continu^ palam est, But if it be
false, or, a lie, or, else unlikely, and to no purpose, or else, feigned by
subt^^ty, out it goes by and by. Donatus in commentarijs. Falsum est quod
regitur id quod factum est. Vanum, quod fieri non potest. Fictum quod non est
factum, and fieri potuit, Vel: Falsum est fictum mendacium simile veritati:
Vanum, nec possible, nec verisimile. Fictum to^^ ^ine vero, sed verisimile.
Falsum loqui mendaci^ est. Vanum stul^i* fictum calidi. Falsum loqui culpae
est. Fictum* virtutis Vanum veco^d^^. Falsis decipim^r. Fictis delectamur. Van^
contemnimus* And Contineo for taceo, Metaphora est a vasis liquorem
continentibus, ^ metaphore, or translation taken of vessels th^^ can hold
liquor and not leake, nor run out*

25 Plenus rimarum sum, hac atque illac perfluo* I am full of chappes, or
hooles, and run out or, leake at this place, and that place, or eue^ where.
Tracta metaphora a vasis fractis, rim^sis, minimeque liquoris continentibus.
Perfluoris, luxi, Perfluere, perfluxum, is to run out (...) every part, or,
on every side. Vt Lagena ma^^ materiata, vel male compacta perfluit, Lagena, is
an earthen ca^^ken, or pitcherd, more used for wine then for water, which if it
be no^ just made or else crased, it will leake and run^^ out in every place.

Cave illi quicquam committas quod ^acitum* velis, nam vndique perfluit. Beware
that you trust not him, with any thing that you would have kept secret, for he
runs out in every part, as a broken pitcherd.

So in this place, hac, atque illac perfluo, id est, in modum non fidelis
lagenae, quae mihi committuntur* effu^do. And transfluo is of the same
signification, that perfluo is Valla. lib. 5. eleg. cap. 31

26 Taceri si vis, vera dicito. If thou will have it kept secret, tell truth.

27 Ea habitabat Rhodi, She dwells at Rhodes.

30 Arbitror, certum non scimus, So I think, but the truth, or, certaynty we
know not.

31 Matris nomen and patris dicebat, He told the name of his father and
mother, or, he told the names of his parents.

33 Per aetatem non potuerat, He could not, he was so young, or, because he
was very young, an elegant manner of speakinge, observed and noted apud
Hadrianum Cardinalem de ser. lat. Pl^. Epist. 190. Totum denique ordinem rei*
cui per aetatem non interfuisti, yea and all the whole course, or, order of the
matter, al which doing you were not present, because you were very young.
Liuius ab vibe condita, qui per aetatem ac valetudinem poterant which were of
age and in health, able so to do, or else, which were neither so young nor
sick, but that they might. Ibidem, omnes qui per aetatem arma far posse^t,
All that were of age, able to wear harnes Cicer. Caio. Mario. Cum per aetatem
posses venire tamen noluisti. Whereas, or* when you were of age able enough,
yet you would not come.

34 Mercator hoc addebat, The Merchant sayd^ this moreover, or, further.

36 Matter coepit educare ita vt si esset silia, M^ mother began to bring her up
as if she had ben^ her own daughter. Where note the use of the tenses of
verbes. It is to be said in the Lat^^ authors of old time, here, esset, and
not fuisse^ and yet many, etiam qui sibi videntur esse all^ quid posteriore
loquendi modo nunquam no^^ vtuntur.

38 Sororem plerique esse credebant meam. Many believed her to be my sister, Or,
many^ thought verily that she was my sister, or, man^^ believed surely that she
had been my sister, an^ the Latin phrase says esse and not fuisse.

40 Mihi reliquit haec quae habeo omnia, He le^^ me all this that I have.

41 Vtrumque hoc falsum est, Both this is fals^

44 Sine me pe^uenire quo volo, Let me come (...) that point that I would, or,
suffer me to sa^ that I would, or suffer me to tell out al my ta^s^pan^

45 Me a mare occaeperat, He began to love me, Occaeperat for Coeperat, The
compound for the simple.

49 In Cariam profectus est, He went forth or h^ is gone forth, or he has
taken his journey into the country of Ca^ia.

46 Interea loci, In the mean time, or, in ye mean^ space. Donatus in his
commentares upon the second Scene of the second Act of the same comedye
reads interea loci as it were one word Dia to hyphen, id est, per subunionem*
Subunio is a mark that the Greeks use when two sundry dictions or vocables
are to be joined into one, and so reads Donate here, Interea loci. Vt
pronuncietur acuta antepenultima: Duae, inquiens, parts orationis cum
coniunctae vnam fecerint, mutant accentum. Interea loci ergo, id est, interea,
in the mean while in the mean time or space.

^7 Post illa. i. ab eo tempore Since that time. Linacre in his sixth book,
which is entitled De figuris constructionum of the figures of construction,
understands tempora, and likewise in postea, and says that in these and such
other manner of speakinges, as Ex quo, ex eo, ex illo, postea, post illa, etc is
Eclipsis of this noune te^pus, as in these examples. Virg. Ex quo Titides.
Ide^. Ex illo fluere ac retro sublapsa reserri. Sueton in the life of
Domitianus. Neque cessauit ex eo tempore, and likewise in such as this. Ver.
Ante expectatum positis stat in agmine castris, for ante expectatum tempus. But
as the same Linacre in an other place notes, Post illa, is an Aduerbe of time,
or used aduerbiallye, and is made on word of twain. by Subunton, like as
Interea loci next before.

^^ Mea consilia tibi credo omnia. I commit all my secrets unto you, or, I
trust you with all my counsel, or, I show you allmy counsel, or, I hide
none of my secrets or counsel from you.

39 Ne hoc quidem tacebit, He will not keep that secret.

49 Dubium ne id est? Is there any doubt of that or* is that any doubt?

50 Hoc agite amabo, I pray you take heed to this, properly said in Latin as
before in Andria: Simo, Hoccine agis an non? Do thou take heed to this that I
say, or, not?

Ego vero istuc s* ago Yes forsooth sir (aunsweareth Dauus)

50 Matter mea illic mortua est. My mother died there.

51 Aliquantum ad rem est auidior, He is somewhat covetous for to get money.
Beade Laurentium Val libro primo elegantiarum cap. decimo sexto, These aduerbes
Tantum, qua^tum, aliquantum, multum, paulum, with others like be joined with
positiues, and words of like signification with positiues as Ta^tum probus
quantum doctu^, as honest, as well learned. Quantum potes, tantum elabora,
Labor so much as thou may, Tanto, qnanto, aliquanto, multo, paulo, with
other like, be joined with comparatiues as Cicer. Quanto mayor es, ta^to te
geras summissius, The higher, or, greatter man that thou art, so much the more
lowly behave thy self. Yet this notwithstanding, for as much as the said
words, Tantum quantum, aliquantum, etc. are changed into the nature of
Aduerbes, therefore they may sometimes be used for Tanto quanto, and the others
ending in o, especially if there be not such contraposition, or two diverse
things, that is to say, express and plain setting of one contrary against
another.

52 Forma videt honest a virginem, He saw that it was agoodly fair maiden, or,
he saw that the maid had a very good face, or, was very well faced, or, full

69 Cupio aliquos parare amicos beneficio meo. I would feign make, get or
purchase some friends by some benefit, or, pleasure, doing or she wing.

79 Amabo adi^ta me, I pray you help me, Amabo, is an Abuerbe of praying, and
is the same thing that we say in English, as ever I shall love you, or as ever
I shall do you a good turn, or, pleasure etc. and it has the second
syllable long Amabo as some pronounce it.

70 Adiuta me quo id fiat facilius Help me that it may be the more better or
more casely done.

71 Sine illum priores parts per hosce aliquot dies apud me habere. Suffer him
to have the pre-eminence with me, or, in my house for a few days, or, for
these two or three days.

72 Nihil respondes? Make you me none answer at all? or, will you not speak
to me? For in such manner of speakings, where as the phrase of the English
tongue uses to speak by the future time, the Latin men speak by the present
tence.

73 Ego quicquam cum istis factis tibi respondeam? Should I make thee any
aunsweare, or, should I speak unto thee, doing by me as thou do?

Problemes.

105 Profecto non plus biduum, In good sooth no more but two days. It is to be
noted that the Latin men did elegantly use Plus in such manner speaking (as
this is) joined some times with the nominative, and sometimes with the

joined with the nominative.

Liuius de bello mar. Plus quingenta ^^ominu^ ^eciderunt More then five hundred
men were slain. Idem de bello punico. Hominum eo die eaesa plus duo milia,

Vitruuius. Ita a pariete distant, vt ne plus pateat palmum. Let them so be set

pro P. Quincio. Ac tecum plus anno vixit in Gallia, and he made his abode with
you in Galla, more then one whole year. Idem in the oration pro Pla^^o. No^

fortunae est, the one, that is to wit, Loci, has respect and relation to the

14 Tota erras via, Thou art very foul deceived: a proverb taken of them,
which in their ^ourney go clean out of their way, Eras. in Chil*

16 Hoc nouum est aucupium, This is a new craft to get a living, or to get
money. A Metaphore taken of foulinge, or, taking of Foul. For Auceps
properlye is a fouler, and Aucupium is foulinge, and by a Metaphore, it is used
for all manner of ways, to get any thing by wyles, traynes, or, craft, and it
is deryued of the verb Aucupor, aris, to go a fouling* and to take birds,
and by translation, Aucupari laudem, is to go about to get praise and
commendation, Aucupari quaestum, to go about to get money.

16 Ego hanc primus inueni viam, I was the first that found out this way, or I
found out this way first.

17 Est genus hominum, qui esse primos se omniu^ ^erum volunt, There is one
sort of men, which would have prtheminence above all others, or which d^syre to
be highest of al, and to be had most in honor, or would be the ringleaders, or
that would rule all the roste.

or use my self to make them to laugh at me.

19 His vlt^o arrideo, To such (whatsoever they say* or d^) I show a merry

19 Eorum ingenia admiror* I make a great maruaylyng at their high wits.

20 Quicquid dicu^^ laudo, What soever they say* I praise, commend, or allow it.

20 Id ^u^sum ^i negant, laudo id quoque, that if they deny the ^^^fe fame
again, that also I commend and hold withal.

22 Is quaestus nunc est mul^^ vberrimus, By so doing, as the world goes now,
a man may get a maruaylous good living* for, that is now a days, ^ mayuaylous
ready way to get money, Or, now a days that is the very chief and and
principal way, to get money enough.

24 Dum haec loquimur. While we were talking, or, coming.

28 Me salutant, ad coenam vocant, aduentum gratulantur, They bad me good even,
and had me to supper, and said that I was welcome, or, that they were glad of

30 Vbi videt me tam facile victu^ quaerere, when he saw that I got my living
so easily.

30 Ibi homo coepit me obsecrare, than the fellow began to desire, and pray me
for Gods sake. Obsecrare enim est quasi per sacra rogare.

entend to have or to make good sport with this knave, or, I will have some
pastime with this knave.

38 Hi hoc munere arbitrantur sua^ Thaidem esse, These folks think by this
gift to win the love of Thais for ever, or, to assure Thais to them.

Parmeno with all my heart, or good morrow, or good even, to you Parmeno, and
many good euens.

41 Number quidnam hic, quod nolis, vides* Do thou see any thing here, that by
thy good will thou would not see?

41 Number quid aliud? Any thing else?

42 Qui dum? How so?

42 Gnat. Tristis e^ Parm. Nihil equidem, Gnat. You are sad* Parm not a whit, I.

43 Vro hominem i. dolor cogo says Donat. I byte, or wringe, or, vex the
fellow, or, I nettle him now* For vro vris vssi vstum, is to burn, or to
parche, and it is as well of cold as of heat Lucanus, Vrebant montana niues.

All the hills, and that that grows upon the^ were parched with snow or
cold. Virg. Aut Boreae penetrabile frigus adurat, or, when the sharp, nypping,
or, pearsing cold of the North wind pearceth etc. Vrere hominem* By
translation, is to vex a man, and to make him sorry at the heart, and as we
also by translation say in English, to byte, to nyp, to wrynge, to netle, to
make woe. And the passive Vror, is sem blably used for Cruciari, to be vexed,
to be woe or, to be sorry at the heart. Plaut in Bachid. Qua^ magis id repeto,
tam magis vror, The more I remember, or consider it, the more I am sorry and
vexed, or grieved withal. Idem in Persa. Vritur cor mihi, My heart burns. Idem
in Menech. Viden tuilli occulos vrier? vt viridis exoritur color ex temporibus?
Do thou not see his eyes burn as red as fire? and how that his ^e^ples
wax or begin to be as green as grass? Virgil used vro, in the same
signification for ardeo, as though it were a verb Neuter passive* Vrit atrox
Juno. The cruel and fierce goddess Juno, was sore grieved, or burned in ire.
i. exarsit or ex^anduit.

44 Quam hoc munu^ gratum* Thaidi ar bitrare esse? How welcome shall this gift
be unto Thais trowest thou? Or how well will Thais like this gift. or, present,
think thou?

45 Omnium retum vicissitudo est, The world changes every day, It is a
proverb, by which is signified, that in this world is no thing stable,
permanent, nor durable, but like as the sea does continually flow and ebb* so
do all the things in the world daily change now up, now down, now merry now
sad, now friend, now foe, now accepted and anon out of favor, now familiar
and anon clean disacquainted, to day who but he? and to morrow shut clean
out of doors. etc.

Eras. in Chiliad.

55 Number tu hic relictus custos, nequis forte internuncius cursitet. Art thou
set here to watch and to see, that no messenger may perchance run or come
between.

coming hither.

60 Non temere est, It is not for naught.

60 Properans venit, He comes in have.

60 Nescio quid circumspectat, He looks about whatsoever the matter is.

In the third Scene of the second Act.
2 E conspectu amisi meo. I have lost it out of my sight, or, I have lost the
sight of it, or it is gone out of my sight.

3 Vbi quaeram? Where may, or should I seek him?

3 Vbi inuestigem? Where may or should I find which way she went? Vestigare,
est per vestigia quaerere seu indagare. To seek by the steps and print of the
foot, and by the trace. Plaut. in truculento. Hac vna opera circumit per
familias, puerum vestigat. She goes al under one to every man's house, and
traceth the boy. And by translation it is to make dilligent search for any
thing. Cic. lib. 3. de oratore. Ipsa tractatio and quaestio quotidie ex se
gignit aliquid, quod cum desidiosa delectatione vestiges. The very handling,
or* exercise, and the matter it self does every day of it self, bring forth
some thing, which a man may, or would seek out with quiet delectation and
pleasure. Inuestigare est per vestigia inuenire. To find out by the foot, by
the steps, or by the trace, and tread of the feet, as they that hunt and
trace the wild beasts and follow them by the foot, and by the trace find
them out, and (by a Metaphore thereof taken) it is to find out any thing by
diligent serching Plautus in Market. Non concedam, neque quiesca^ vsque, noctu
neque diu, prius, profecto, quam aut amica^ aut mortem inuestigauero. I will not
give over, nor rest in any any place, neither by night, nor by day, at the
least wise before, or, until I shall have found either my love, or else death.
Terent. in Heau^. Nihil est* tam difficile, quin quaere^do inuestigaripossit.
There is nothing so hard, but that by dilligent serching and seeking it may be
found out. Cice. in oratione pro Q. Ligario Sed quoniam diligentia amici
inuestigatum est, quod latebat confitendum est, vt opinor, but seeinge that by
the good diligence of a friend, that thing is now found out* which was hidden
and unknown, it should be confessed as I think, or suppose.

3 Quem perconter? Of whom might I ask?

3 Quam insistam viam? What way may I take, or, go?

4 Vna haec spes est, There is no hope but this.

4 Vbi vbi, est diu celari no^ potest, Whersoeuer he be, he cannot be hidden

5 O faciem pulchram, O fair and goodly face.

6 Taedet horum quotidianarum for matum, I am wearye of these, that among us
are called and taken for fair women, or I have done with those fair women,
that we have daily here among us.

7 O infortunarum senem, O unfortunate, or, unhappy old man.

8 Ludum iocumque dices fuisse illum alteru^ praevt huius rabies quae dabit,
Thou, would say that the other was but a play and sport in comparison of
those things, or, of such pranks, as this fellow will play in his rage.

Donatus does order it thus, Prae vt, scilicet illa sunt, quae huius rabies
dabit. i. faciet patrabit, monstrabit ostendet Prae sometimes is very elegantly
used, importing a certain respect and comparison to an other thing. Terence in
his comedye a little before, Ibi ego illum contempsi prae me, Then did I nothing
regard him in comparion of my self. And in this signification, Prae is
oftentimes (specially in Plautus and Terence) found compound with quam and vt,
as Hadrian has noted examples. Prae alone having an Ablative case after him
Plautus in Mostellaria. Video te nihil pendere omnes homines prae Philolache, I
see that you set by no man in comparison of Philolache.

Idem in Mil. Prae illius forma quasi sperans tuam, as who says, you set not
by your own beauty in comparison of hers, or as we should say, you think not
your self fair in comparison of her.

Ci^ Seruio Sulpitio, non tu quidem vacuus molestijs sed prae nobis beatus. In
deed you are not void of some troubles or without some care, but yet in
comparion of me, even in heaven. Prae quam Plaut. id Aulul. Sed hoc etia^
charu^ est prae qua^ vbi sumptus petu^t, But this is even a goodly, or tolye
thing in comperison of when they require cost, charges, or, expense of money.
Idem in Amphitrio. Parua^res est, voluptatu^ in vita, praequam quod molestum
est There is small pleasure in this life in comparison of the troubles and
cares that be in the same. Praevt Plaut Mil. Nihil hercle hoc quide est, praevt
alia dicam, Nay this is nothing in comparison of other things, that I will
tell, or show you. Idem in Ampho. Parum etiam praevt futurum est praedicas.
Thou say, or speak even very little, or in manner nothing in comparison of
that that shall be in deed. Idem in Menech. Modestior nunc quide^ est de verbis
praevt dudum fuit. He is now sober in his words in comparison of that he was
right now, or a little while agone.

9 Vt illum Dij Deaeque senium perdant. God and all the saints in heaven, give
that old Churl a mischief: or a vengeance light on that old Churl, I pray
God and all the saints in heaven. Vt here, and in such other like manner
speakinges, is taken for Vtinam, execra^do vel optando, in cursing or banning.
or wishing. Plaut. in Persa. Vt istum Dij Deaeque perda^t, God and all the
saints give this knave a mischief, or send him a shameful death. Idem in
Mostellaria, Vt Dij Deaeque omnes me pessimis exemplis interficia^t nisi ego
illam interfecero sitifameque atque gelu, I pray God and all the sayncts, send
me the most shameful death that may be, to the example of al others, if I do
not surely kill her up with thirst and hunger and cold. See more examples in
Hadrian, De ser. lati.

Further note that in this word Senium, is Emphasis, which is a figure either
when some thing that is hidden and not spoken, is meant, or else when it is
spoken, for a more express plain and vehement setting out, and expressing of
al thing which may be many ways, but the principal and most elegant way is,
when a Substantive is set for an Adjective, that is to say when any quality is
put for the person that has the quality, as Scelus, ungraciousness, pro
Scelesto, for one that is ungracious: and so here Senium, agednesse, or old
age, pro Seen, for him that is old. For as Donatus says Senex is referred to
the age of years. Seniu^ for the contumelious and despiteful, and co^temptuo^s
words. And therefore I English, Illu^ Seniu^ y^ old churl. Where note yt
albeit Seniu^, is the neuter gender, yet it has joined with him an Adjective
of the Masculine ge^der, and the Relative that comes after, is also put in
the Masculine gendre, for as Donatus witnesses, the gendre both of the
Adjective, and al^o of the Relative, is referred to the thing that is
understand, that is to say, Senem, or homine^ senem. So Tere^^e in the
Prologue of this second Comedy, Eas se non negat personas tra^stulisse in
Eunuchum suam ex Graeca. He says not nay, or he does not deny, but that he
took the same parts that are in the Greek Comedy, from thence into this his
Comedy entitled Eunuchus: Eunuchu^ is the Masculine gendre, and yet because
there is meant by it Comoediam, therefore the Adjective Suam is put in y^
Feminine gendre. Idem in Andria. Vbi illic* i. ille scelus est, qui me
perdidit.? Where is y^ ungracious knave, that has casie me away? Idem in Adel.
Festiuum caput, qui omnia sibi posthabenda putarit esse prae meo commodo, the
gentlest companyon, or the most honest, or, the best fellow alive, which could
find in his heart to let all other things alone, or, to set all other things
apart in respect of my commodity and pleasure, or, for my commoditye and
pleasure. By Caput is understood Aeschynus, and therefore the Relative qui,
having respect and relation to the person that is meant, and not to the
Substantive* that is expressed* is put in the Masculine Gender, and not in the
Neuter gendre, by the figure of construction called Synthesis

9 Meremoratus est, He caused me to tarrye, or* stayed me; or hindered me of
my way, i^ est, detinui^me.

10 Qui illum non flocci fecerim. That I set not so much as a straw, or a rush
by him. Floccus is any ^^le ragge of a lock of wolle, the which is
unprofitable, and the which will serve for nothing, and is pulled from the
fleece, and cast away, or some like thing of no value, price, or, estimation,
whereof the Latin men, when they will signify, or show, that they set nothing
by a man, or any other thing, use to say prouerbially Flocci non facio or else
Flocci facio indiffere^ly. For which we Englishmen in a like proverb say* I
set not the least straw or rush under my foot by it: or, I set not the least
hair on my head by tr^albett for this latter, both y^ Greeks and Latin men,
have a peculier proverb taken of the same thing. Pli. non facio, I set not ^
hair by it.

11 Quid tu es tristis? Why are you sad?

11 Quid tu es alac^is* Why are you merry?

12 Vnde is i ^nde venis? From whence come thou?

12 Nescio hercule, nec vnde eam, nec quorlum came. In good sooth I can not tell
neither from whence I come, nor whither I go^.

13 Piorsus oblitus sum mei, I have qu^^^ and clean forgotten my self.

14 Qui quae so? How so I bescech you?

14 Nunc te ostendas qui vir scies. Now show thy self what a man thou art.

15 Scis te mihi saepe pollicitum esse, Thou know thou have often promised
me, or made me promise.

16 V^l^atem faciam, (...) cognoscas m^am, I shall do, or I shall find the
means, that thou shall know end see what service I can do.

18 Fac nunc promissa appareant* Now let your promises appear, and beseene,
or see that your promises may now appear.

22 Est paulo habitior, He is somewhat fat, round or (...) good lyking.

24 Noua figura o^is, color ve^us, corpus solidum and succi plenum* Such favor
of race and visage^, as you have not much seen, true* and native color, and
not of paynting, her body ^ou^d, lusty, and nothing decayed, but full of good
blood and wholesome hum^^^s,

26 Mihi vel vi, vel clam vel precario fac tradas,

Se that thou get it me, or into my hands either perforce and by strength of
hands, or else by privy conueyance* and stealth, or, else o^ lone for a little
while, and then to be restored home again. For Precarium, carij, is that
thing which is by prayer, instaunce and petition granted to any body to use,
to occupy, or, to enjoy, so long as it shall please and content the party, that
does so lend, or grant it* and no longer.

So Alexander. Apud Qu Cur^. says. Mori praestat quam paecario impetat^r esse.

Better it is to dye then to be a captain, or ^ king at the pleasure of other
men and no longer. Ibidem. Precarium spernebat imperium.

He set nothing by that power, dominion, or, rule which should continue so long
as pleases the^ that gave or granted it, and no longer.

And under this meaning did Seneca say, hominem esse precarij spiritus. That
the life of man does continue at the pleasure of Nature, Fa^e, or destenye, ^.
Parcarum, which take it away when they will. and not when it plea^eth us. Of
this the noune Precario in the voice and termination of the Da^iue case, is
used A^uerb^ally in the same signification Pau Iuriscons^. Precario habere
videtur, qui possessione^ corporis vel iuris adeptus est, hac solummodo causa
quod adhibuit prece^ and impetrauit, quod sibi possidere aut vti liceat, veluti
si me precario rogaueris, vt per fundum meum ire vel agere liceat, vel vt in
tectum meum stillicidium, vel ^ignum in parie^em immissum habeas.

A man to have a thing precario, says Paulu^ seems to be when any body has
obtained ^ go^e^ the possession of any body, or, bodily thing or of any right
and title of any thing only, for because he made request and instaunce for the
same, and thereby has obtained, that it may be lawful for him to possess, or
to use, and occupy it. As if you should make request and instaunce unto me, and
desire me that you might for a while as long as it should please me, to have a
way, or, to go through my ground, or, to do any thing therein, or, e^s that
you might have a little gutter, or synke, to come by my house, or else to have a
^after, a^^g, or, a bea^e, set within, or, vp^on the wall of my house. Plin.
de ^iris illustribus: Se^u^us ^ullius quasi precario ^egnare caepit, sed tecte
in per^um administrauit. Seru^us Tullius began at the ^^^st to ^aygne in the
city of Rome as who should say Precario, that is, at the will and pleasure of
the people, and as long as they would permit and suffer him, and no longer:
but yet afterward he ordered and ^^ded the same Empire we^^ enough* Plin^in
ep^st. Quibus ex causis precario studeo, studeo tamen. For which causes I study
only when please them, or, as long as they will suffer me, and yet some study I
have* Cicer in the Oration* pro Aulo Cecinna, Ne id quidem satis est, nisi
docet ita se possedisse vt nec vi nec clam, nec precario possederit* But yet
that is not sufficient or, enough neither except he pla^nly show and declare,
that he had it so in hy^ possession, that he h^ld it neither by force and
strength, nor priu^ly and vnknowinge to the owner, or ellse that he had it lent
him for a season, to be restored home again when it should be required. For
that be the thrce ways, unlawfully to keep away any thing of an other man's.
And precatio, in his signification may be used aduerb^a^^y, in many diverse and
sundry manner speakinges. For precario concedere, is to lend or grant a thing
till you shall requ^re it aga^ne. Precario petere vel rogare, is to desire to
have a thing, as long as may please the owner, and then make surrender and
redeliuery of the same, when it shall be required.

26 Mea nihil refert, dum potiar modo. I care not so that I may have, obtain,
or get it.

28 Virgo cuia est? What maid is it? or what is she?

29 Qua ratione amisisti^ How, or, by what chance or mean didd^st thou lee^e
it?

30 Equidem adueniens mecu^ stomachabar, modo, as I was coming hither right now
I was angry with my self, or in a great ^ume.

30 Neque quenquam esse hominem arbitror, cui mag^s bonae faelicitates omnes
aduersae sient, And* I think there is no man alive, that has all good fortune
and chances more against him, than I have. These two words homo quisquam,
be often times elegantly thus joined together, notwithstanding that quisqua^
alone by it self, signifies, as much as homo quisqua^ Liu. ab vrbe condit.
Victoria cui nec deus, nec homo quisquam inuidear, A victory, at which neither
any of the gods, nor yet any man, has or should, or may have envy, or grudge.

33 Quid hoc est sceleris? What abominable aci^ is this? or what ungracious
deed is this?

35 Is fit mihi obu^am, He met me.

36 Incommode hercle, Ill, or to your displeasur^ truly.

38 Illum liquet mihi deiurare his mensibus sex vel septem prorsum no^ vidisse

seven months now last past, I never saw him.

40 Nisi nunc cum minime vellem, minimeque* opus fuit. But now at this time
when it was my least desire, or least in my mind, and will, and when it was
nothing needful, or least expedient.

41 Nonne hoc monstri simile est? Is not this like a very monster? or, is not
this a very strange thing? Monstruu^. i. is derived of mo^stro, as, aui,
are, to show, whereof Monstrum is any thing, that in signifying another
thing, does show it, Cicero de natura deorum: Monstra, praedictiones, and
praesentiones reru^ fu^uraru^: quid aliud declarant, nisi hominibus ea, quae
futura sunt portendi, and praedici ex quo illa ostenta monstra, portenta,
prodigia dicu^tur? These strange tokens, or. shewinge^, prophecyinges and
foreknowingees, and foreperceiuinges of things to follow and come: what other
thing do they declare, but such things as shall in ^ede follow after, to be
before signified, betokened, and showed unto men, and by reason thereof such, or
the same things be called in L^^^ne oste^ta, mo^stra, porte^ta, or prodigia,
And therefore Virgil used Monstum, for and in ^^eed of the noune verbal,
monstratio. Mo^stra deum refero, I make relation unto you of such things as
the gods have showed unto me. But because that such things, for the most part
are noted by strange sightes and chances (which not only in our english
tongue, but also in all other tongues ^or the most part are called monsters
after the latin word, Therefore Monstru^ is most commonly used and taken for
all such things as are contrary or against the common order and course of
nature, either in defaut and lacking, or els^ in exceeding, as to have two
thummes upon one hand, or to be borne the heels standing in the place of the
toes, or to be borne without a nose, with others like.

41 Continuo ad me accurrit, He comes running unto me by and by.

45 S^in quid ego te volebam? Wot you what I would with you? or, what I would

51 Mirum ni hanc dicit, quae modo Thaidi data est dono, It is marvel, but
he speaks of the Maiden, that was given unto Thais ere while, or right now.

53 Comites secuti sunt? Did there any company follow?

55 Alias res agis, Thou art, or thou go about other matters, as who should
say, thou take no heed to that that I say: And so does Terence use it, and
speak it here, as I have often times englished it before.

thee.

83 Nunquam vidi melius consilium dari. I never saw better counsel given.

84 Age, eamus intro, Come on, let us go in, or, well, go we in.

85 Quid agis? iocabar equidem, What now? or what meanest thou? or, whereabout
go thou? I spoke but in sport. Here note, that iocari and iocus be
properly in words, Ludere and Ludus in deeds. Albeit, they be in Authors
confounded, that is to say, the one used for the other, as Valla proves and
shows by examples. Lib. 4. cap. 16.

85 Quid ego egi miser? What have I done miserable fellow, or wretch that I am?

88 Istaec in me cudetur faba, The fault of this shall be laid to me, or
this myschiefe shall light on my neck. A proverb whereof read in Chil. Eras.

89 Flagitium facimus, We go about an heinous offense, or, we should
herein do a detestable act, or, it is a sinful thing that we go about to
do. Facere flagitium, is to commit to perpetrate, or to do an heinous
offense, or a great trespass. Plau. in penulo: Hae fores feceru^t magnu^
flagitium modo. Ad. Quid flagitij est? C. Crepueru^t clare. This door did a
great trespass right now. Ad. What great or heinous offense is that? C. It gave

89 An id flagitium est? Is that any great trespass or heinous offense?

95 Ne conferas culpam in me. Put not the fault or blame on me.

96 Par. Iubesne? Chaer. Iubeo, cogo, atque impero. Parm. do thou bid me?
Cher. yea mary do I bid thee, and compel thee, and also command and charge
thee.

97 Nunquam defugiam authoritate^. I will not do against your authority. That
is, I will not be afearde, to do as you bid me, nor to follow your
authority and commandment: or I will not shrink to adventure it if you say
the word: or, I will make no bones at it, if ye say y^ word. Defugere
authoritate^, is to avoid, and as who should say, to be afearde to follow and
to do that thing y^ any person has authority to command, or else may do by
authority. Cic. pro P. Sylla. Tu remp. reprehendis, qua domesticos hosts, ne
ab ipsis ipsa necaretur, neca uit. Itaque attend iam Torquate, quam ego
defugia^ authoritatem consulatus mei. Thou reprouest the commonwealth, for
that it has put to death familier enemies and rebellious, that were within the
city, least that by them, it self might have been oppressed and brought to
utter confusion and desolation. Therefore o Torquate, see now and mark well,
how greatly I am afeard to stand by that, that I did, by, or, in the auc^ority
of mine office of consulship: as who should say, I would thee to weete, I am
not ^fearde to stand by it, and that I do not now repent, or go from that,
that I did when I was consult in sleing Catiline and putting him to death. etc.
as by the place in Tullie, the judgment of a diligent reader may well see.

97. Dij vertant been. God turn it to good, or bring it to a good end.

In the third Scene.
2 Non tam ipso quidem dono laetus est quam abs te datum esse. He is not so
glad of that gift or present it self, as that it was given by you.

3 Id vero serior triumphat, Of that he is merry or glad in deed, or, for
that he triumphs or glories earnestly, or inearnest.

4 Huc prouiso, vt vbi tempus siet, eum deducam. I come forth hither to s^e,
that when time is, I may bring him thither, or awayte on him.

5 Est istuc datu^ mihi, grata, vt sint quae facio omnia. It is a gift given
me, that all things that I do, every man lyketh well.

10 Qui habet salem, qui in ^e. est. i. sapientiam and leporem. Who so has the
wisdom, and pleasant facion that you have. Donatus expounds Salem. i.
sapientiam wisdom. Where he notes, that Sal, neutraliter condimentu^
significat, masculinum pro sapientia accipitur Albeit Sal, when it is latin
for Salt, is both the masc. and also the neut. gend. in both numbers Cato in re
rust. Ex sale. Qui apud Carthaginie^ses fit. Of the salt that is made in the
parties about the cittye of Carthage. Sal in Iug. neque sale^, neque alia gulae
irritamenta, Neither salt nor any other things to provoke the app^tyte.
Columel. Carnem salibus aspersam. Flesh, or meat poudred with sa^t. Paul.
iuriscon. cotem. ferro subigenda^, necessaria, quoque hostibus venundari, vt
ferrum, and frumentum, and sales non sine capitis periculo licet. It is not
lawful under the pain of death to sell to our enemies, either a whetstone to
make any knyfe sharp, or any other necessaryes, as iron or knives, and wheat,
and salt. etc. Sal. by translation is taken pro vrbanitate, lepore, venustate,
ioco, good and pleasant facion, and merye conceytes both in words and other
wise, as here in this place of Terence, and Catul. Nulla in tam magno est
corpore mica salis, There is not one crum or drop of good fashion in all that
great royls body. For Catullus there speaks of a certain maiden that was
called Quintia, whom many esteemed and called fair, beautiful goodlye. In
deed (says Catullus) I grant that she is white of skin, tall of personage,
sclender of making, and bolt upright, but that she is Formosa, that is, fair,
or beautiful, that I deny, for there is no manner pleasantnes, nor good
fashion in her. The verses of Catullus be these.

Quintia formosa est multis, mihi candida, lo^ga, Recta est haec ego sic
singula confiteor.

Totum illud formosa nego, nam nulla vetustas

Nulla in tam magno est corpore mica salis. Salis ^. venustatis lepo^is
Pleasantness, grace and proper feature, or good fashion in her gesture
behavior, or, pleasant words. which may delight them that see her, hear her,
or be in her company. Pla in Ca. Necpote quicqua^ co^memorarique plus salis,
plusque leporis habeat hodie Necpote. s. est. i. non potest quicquam etc. It is
not possible to rehearse, or to show any thing, that has more grace,
amiablenes, or pleasant fashion at this hour, where que is taken for id est
plus salis, plusque leporis for plus salis i. plus leporis, as I have noted in
other places before. And hereof Sal, in the singular number and sales, in the
plural, be taken for merye conceits or delectable and pleasant communication,
y^ may make, or cause, the hearers to laugh, and yet is somewhat sharp poynaunt
and biting withal as witnesses Quin. li. 6. And Pli. li. 31. cap. 7. of the
natural history, where he says thus: Ergo Hercule vita humanior sine sale
nequit degere, adeoque necessarium alime^tu^ est, vt transierit intellectus ad
voluptates animi quoque Na^ ita sales appellantur, omnisque vitae lepos, and
summa hilaritas, laborumque requies no^ alio magis vocabulo constat. Than
truly the life of man, being in any reasonable good condition or state, can
not continue without the use of salt, which is so necessary and profitable an
help and sustenau^ce or sustentation to and for the life of man, that the
mind, intelligence, and understanding, has taken and made from the same a
metaphore or translation unto the pleasures and delectations of the mind. For
the said pleasures and delectacio^s of ye mind, are called in latin Sales,
and all manner pleasure of our life, and the highest mirth and pastime, that we
have (which consists in witty, merry, and pleasant communication or other
joys) and also all q^iet rest and case after the peinful labors, are by none
other latin ward in the world better or more generally, or more vsully, or
more expressly signified then by this word Sales, of which be metaphorically
derived many pretty Adagies or Proverbs, as Sal, vitae amicitia, Friendship is
the sake of man's life, that is to say the only sauce that takes away the
werishnes thereof, and makes it pleasant or delectable: with other proverbs
mo, of the which read Eras. Chil. and specially for this place of Tereuce, the
proverb, Salsitudo non inest illi.

13 Sicubi eum sacietas hominum coeperari, If he were at any time weary of the
company of men.

14 Negotij eum siquando odium coeperat. i. taedium, If at any time he were
weary of his bustnes or great labors.

15 Requiescere vbi volebat. When he was disposed to be at quiet, or to rest
after his labors

17 Me conuiua^ solu^ abducebat sibi. He took me away with him, or he would
take away me, and no man else to be his guest, and to dyne or sup with him.

18 Sic homo est. Such is his fashion, or this is the fashion of the man.

20 Inuidere omnes mihi, ac mordere clanculu^, for inuidebant and mordebant,
Every man had envy or grudge at me, and spoke very ill by me behind my back.

24 Vbi molestus mihi magis est. When he began to be some what busy with or
when he disquieted or vexed me, or would not let me be in rest.

25 Eo ne es ferox, quia habes imperium in beluas? eone for idione. etc. Art
thou therefore hasty on men because thou art a master of brute beasts?

26 Pulchre me hercle dictum and sapienter, Well spoken by my soothe, and
wisely.

29 Quid illud, quo pacto Rhodium ^etigerim i^ conuiuio, nun quid tibi dixi?
What that? ho^ I took up or ^a^nted a fellow of Rhodes as w^ sat at the table,
did I never tell it thee?

31 Nunquam, sed narra obsecro, N^auer, but (...) it I beseech you.

fellow, quod I?

38 Tuum ne obsecro ho^ dictum erat? I pray you heartely, what, was that your
saying?

39 Audiera^ saepe and fertur inprimis. I had heard it many times, and it is a
saying as common as any is.

40 Dolet dictum imprudenti adolescenti* This word or saying, grieved the
foolish young man.

41 Risu omnes qui aderant emori. All that were in compaigny, were almost dead
with laughte^ Emori. i. emorieba^tur, per antip^osin. For Donatus in many
places notes, that the infinitive mood in such speakinges is more vehement
and of more strength, and efficacy, then is the indicative.

42 Metuebant omnes iam me. Than were they all afearde of me.

^ Id vt ne fiat haec res sola est remedio. That that thing may not be, or
come too pass, this thing only is a remedy and help.

^ Phaedriam intromittamus comessatu^. Let us have in Phedria to make good
cheer with us. Comessor, aris, ssatus, ssari. depon. is properly that we say
in english, to banquet after supper, or to make ri^re suppers. Suetoni, in
Domitiano Conuiuabatur frequenter and large, sed pene raptim, certe non vltra
soli^ occasum, nec vt postea comessaretur. He took repastes and feasted both
often and also eat much at once, and yet in mane^ never but by snatches, and
of truth never longer then till the sun went down, nor never to banquet, nor
to have any r^re supper after. Plau. in rude^te. Verum si voletis plausum
fabulae huic clarum dare, comessatu^ omnes veni tote ad me ad annos sexdecim.
But and if you will clappe your hands to gether, that it sound loud in
approuinge and allowinge this Comedy, that we have played, come every one of
you home, and banquet, or make good cheer for these sixtene years. Liui. li. x.
De bell. Mace. reports that Demetriu^ after y^ he had made a certain supper
to his compaignions, said unto them, Quin comessatum ad fratrem imus? Why go
we not to my brothers to banquet: And of comessari co^eth a noune verbal
comessario, derived (as Festus Pam. witnesses) a vicis, quos graeci (...)
dicunt, yt is of little streets. For in such, men dwelled before that towns were
builded, and there one would bydde ^n other to drynking, or banqueting (...)
good neighberhod, for of y^ greek noune (...) is deryued a verb (...) to
banquet, and ^ (...) is derived comessor, in latin, prim^ longa, and with one
^^, of comessor comes ^^messario for banke^^^ng, or making good che^^ after
su^pper. Sue in Vitel Epulas trifariam* (...) per interdum quadri^aria^

meals in^o three evermore, and somtim^ into four, that is ^o weete,
breakfastes dine^^ suppers, and riere suppers, or banqueties, o^ co^ations
after supper.

52 Pamphila^ cantatum prouocemus, Let us p^^^ Pamphila to singe. For as I
think ^eren^ uses here prouocare for euocare to call forth a^ Prodir^ i. exire
to go forth, and that is hi^ mo^^ propre st^nification, and specially in this
place o^ Terence, for he said before, Intromittamus Phedria^, let us have in

Plau. in Pseu. Herus si domi est tuu^ qu^ no^ prouocas? If thy master be at

23 Tacent, satis laudant. They say nothing, and in that they praise it
sufficiently. For holding a man's pear and saying nothing, specially in a man's
adversary is a certain kind of pra^sing or granting, whereof there goes a

says nothing, seems to consent or to think as the other party said, and to
be of the same mind.

37 Qui huic assentari animum induxeris, That could find in thy heart to
flatter such a fellow as this is Valla. lib. 5. Eleg. cap. 66. shows the
difference between these three verbes, assentor; adulor and blandior.
Assentari, is to flatter any body, affyrming his sayings, and upholding his
yea and his nay, or praising him to much, or else many times otherwise then the
truth is, to the end to get some profit and advantage thereby, and it is
properly in words. And therefore this kind of flattery, called Assentation,
is not in any brute beast, but only in man. Plaut. Extemplo, quasi res cum ea
esset mihi, coepi assetari, mulier quicquid dixerat, ide^ ego dicebam. Anon,
as though I had had to do with her, I began to sooth her, and to hold her up
with yea and nay, and whatsoever she said, I said the same. Idem. Assentandum
est quicquid hic me^^ietur. whatsoever lie this follow shall make, we must
sooth or uphold it, and say as he does Terence himself in y^ second Scene of
the second Act of this same Comodye, does best of all declare the nature of
this verb Assentor, aris: where Gnato says thus: Hos confector, hisce ego
non paro me vt rideant, sed his vltio arrideo, and eorum ingenia admiror simul:
quicquid dicunt, laudo, id rursum si negant, laudo, id quoque. Negat quis,
nego, ait, aio. Postremo imperaui egomet mihi omnia assentari, is quastus nunc
est multo vberrimus, such men do I follow at the tail, or at the hard
Heels, or the Elbow (for that is consectari) and among such persous I do not
so fashion my self, that they may laugh at me, but contrartwyse, whatsoever
they sey or do, I show them a merry countenance of mine own self, and also
make a great marueyling at their high wills, Whatsoever they say, I commend it,
and if they deny the same again, that also I commend, if a man say nay, I say
nay also: if he say yea. I say yea to.

And for a conclusion to be short, I master, and rule mine own self, to
uphold his yea and his nay, and to sooth him and to say as he says in all
manner things, for that is the next way now a days to get money enough.

Adulari is to flatter an other man in hu^blinge himself, and being
seruiseable about him, and to labor by such fashions to win and get his
favor, whether it be by voice, and words, or else by gesture of the body, or
by any other way, or mean, whatsoever it be. Nonius Marcel. says thus:
Adulatio est proprie canum blandimentum quod ad homines consuetudine translatum
est, Adulation properly signifies the fauning and ^raping of Degs upon their
masters, from which property by translation it is applied only to men by use
of speakinge, and not by the proper signification of the word. Where note, that
Adulor is a verb deponent and governs a Dative case. Valor Max Diogenes
Syracusis, cum olera ei lauanti Auistippus dixisset. Si Dionysio adulari
velles, ista non esses: Im^ inquit, si tu ista esse velles, Dionysio non
adularis, Diogenes in the City of Sarragous (when that Aristippus had said
unto him, as he was washinge herbs for a Salette these words. If thou
would seek favor of Dyonisius the tyrant, and flatter him, thou
should not eat such meat as that) he answers and said again: Nay it
thou would eat such meat as this, thou should not need to flatter
Dyonysius.

Yet Cornelius Tacitus joined the same verb deponent with an accusatine
saying, Tigillinum aut quem alium adulatus est. He flattered Tigil linus or sum
other man. There is also read Adulo, as, aui, are, an active, or trans^tyue
governing an Accusative case. Ci. li. 2. Tus. quest. where he trans^ateth
certain verses out of a Tragedy of the Greek Poet Aeschilus, speaking in the
person of Prometheus of the Egle that ^ed on his liver: Tum iecore opimo far^a
and satiata affatim, clangorem fundit vastum, and sublime aduolens, pinnata
cauda nostum adulat sanguinem Then she being stuffed and satisfied, even at
full with as much as she would eat of my fat liver, gave an horrible
shrike and taking her flight high up into the air, with her forked and stiff
fethred tail houered playing and dalying at my blood. Albeyt the dictionaryes
take adulat there, for lambit or bibit, as who should say in English, she
sweeted her lips, licking and sucking up my blood. And Cic. lib. 1. off.
uses the passive of the same, Cauendum est, ne assentatoribus patefaciamus
aures neue adulari nos sinamus. We must beware that we open not our ears to
flatterers, nor suffer our selves to be won, or ouerco^med with fauninge, or
humble behauioure of others toward us. For there Cicero does manifestlye put
a difference between assentatio^ and adulation The Poet Lucrecius, used
Audulo, as, aui, as a verb neuter absolutely, that is to say, not joining any
case with him in that verse: Long alio pacto gannitu vocis adulant. And
Linacre in the place of Val. Max. above cited reads thus. Diogenes Saracusis,
cum olera ei lauaoti Aristippus dixisset. Si Dionysic adulari velles, ista non
esses: Imo inquit, si tu Dionysium non adulares, illa non esses: But I find not
the latter in any examplary yt I have hitherto seen, but the commentaries
read, Si Dionysio non adulares, that it be a verb neutre, governing a Dative,
where Oliuerus notes yt many verbes be neuters in o, and deponents in or, and
of the same signification, as populo and populor, impertio impertior, adulo and
adulor. etc.

Bandiri belongs properly to touching and ha^dling, and by improper using, it
is by a Metaphore translated and referred to other parts of the body, yea and
many times to the mind.

Exemplorum plena sunt omnia.

39 Iam ne imus? Shall we go now?

39 Hos prius introducam, and quae volo simul imperabo, I will first have in
these folks, and give in commandment such things as I would have done.

40 Postea continuo exeo, That done I will come forth by and by. For in such
manner of speakinges as this, and Iamne imus? before, and Ego hinc abeo, next
following, with others like where as the property of our English tongue is to
speak by the sign of the future tense, shall or will, the phrase of the Latin
tongue, is to speak by the present tense.

41 Ego hinc abeo, I will be gone hence.

43 Quid tibi ego multa dicam? What should I make many words with thee?

43 Domini similis est. Such master such man. Some grammarians have noted,
that Similis governing a Dative case, betokens like in favor, shape, ^eacture
of body, or in Apparel, and Similis with a Genitive after him, like of
conditions, behavior or qualities of y^ minds only, but that is no difference:
for we read in Cicero. Vt similia sunt, and oua ouorum and apes apum. Plau in
Menech. Nec aqua aquae, nec lae lacti (creed mihi) vsquam similius, quam hic
tui est tuque huius. etc.

44 Quid rides? Whereat laughest thou?

46 Praecurre, vt sint domi parata omnia, Run before, that all things may be

50 Si id non poterit, ad me adducito, It he may not do that neither, bring
him to me.

within the house.

54 Vos me sequimini, Come you after me.

6 Vbi veni, causam, vt tibi manerem repperit, When I was once come, he found
an excuse or occasion to make, me tarry there.

7 Ait rem seriam velle agere mecum, He said he would commune with me of a
sed and weightye matter.

8 Iam tum erat suspitio, dolo malo haec fieri omnia, Even very than I
mistrusted already, that all together should be done by fraud and collusion
Dolus (says Donat) a dolendo, because it makes men sorry, when they are
beguyled vel a dolendo, that is hurting or diminishing, for (...) in Greek, is
Laesio in latin hurting in English, and thereof it is taken for all manner
guyle, and decept, or trumpery. Doli vocabulo (says Nonnius Mar.) nunc tantu^m
in malis vtimur, antiqui autem etiam in bonis rebus v^ebantur, vnde adhuc
dicimus sine dolo malo, nimirum quia solebant dici and bonus., and for his
authority and example he cites this place of Terence, so that dolus is al
manner of deceit, and dolus malus is that, that we use to say in c^glish,
craft and coliusion. Read De dolo malo, in the third book of Cic. De offic.
where among other things he says thus. Nondum enim Aquilius collega and
familiaris meus partulerat de dolo malo formulas. In quibus ipsis eum: ex eo
quaereretur quid esset dolus malus, respondebat, cum esset aliud simulatum,
aliud actum. For my fellow in office and familiar friend Aquilius had not made
and established the four^e of the wryttes yet of Dolo malo, In which writtes
when it was demanded of him, what was Dolus malus, he made, answer, and
said that Dolus malus was when one thing was pretended and outwardly showed,
and an other thing done and executed in deed.

8 Ipse accumbere mecum. i. accumbebat. He sat herd by me at the table

22 Misit orare vt venirem serio, He sent one to pray me to come for a sad and
weighty matter.

would have, or else, let him not trouble, or disqu^et me.

figure Synecdoche that is to say, part of the whole, set for the whose
capitulum for hominem

27 Rus eo, I go into the country.

28 Apud no^ hic mane dum redeat ipsa, Carye here with us until she come her

29 Nihil minus, no point so.

30 Si istuc ita certum est tibi, If you be viterly determined and appointed on
that.

In the fourth Scene.
1 Heri aliquot adolescentuli coimus, Yester day three or four young men of
us met together.

2 Chaeream ei rei praefecimus, We made Cheres the ch^efe captain and doer in
that matter. Here Terence spoke of a promise that was made for to meet
together, and to make good cheer, so that in this place and meaning, it might
co^uentently be englished, we made Cherea ou^ steward and master of the feast.

3 Locus, tempus constitutum est, The place and time was appointed.

4 Praeterijt tempus, The time or hour is past.

4 Quo in loco dictum est, pa^ati nihil est, In the place that was named is

7 Visam si domi est, I will go see if he be at home.

7 Quisnam hinc a Thaide exit? Who comes forth from Thais house here?
Quisnam for quis: It is called Parelcon, that is, when a letter, or syllable is
added, which makes, or helps nothing to the sense.

8 Quid hoc hominis? i. qui hic homo est? What manner of fellow is this, or what
manner a fellow have we here?

8 Qui hic ornatus est? what manner apparayle call you this?

9 Nequeo satis mirari, neque conijcere, I can not leave maruayling, nor
perfectly contect.

10 Libet sciseitari, I have a phantaste to enquire or, I have a great desire
to ask. Sciscitor, a* it is. etc. is to as^e, to the end for to know a thing,
as the voice it self shows, for it is de^iued of seio. P^^co^tari, properly
to ask, to the end to reprove a man, and to take him in a tri^. Inte^^ogare,
is also to ask, to the end to know: Albeit, it is indifferently used for
Per^ontor, to appose a man (as we say.)

In the fifth Scene.
Number quis hic est? Is there any body here? Nemo homo est. There is no man.
Here note that Homo is elegantly sometimes joined with nemo, notwithstanding
that nemo is the same, that nullus homo, read examples in Hadr de Sermon: lat.

^ ^amoe eropere hoc mihi licet gaudium? May I now out with this my joy and
gladness?

^ Proh Jupiter. O Lord.

^ None est, interfici cum perpeti me possum, ne hoc gaudium contaminet vita
aegritudine aliqua. Now at this present time so it is, that I could be content
to die, that life might not here after diste^gne this gladness that I am in, by
any misfortune, displeasure or sorrow.

9 Ab eo gratiam hanc inibo, I will get or have that thank of him.

10 Quid est quod fic gestis? What is the matter that you leap and skippe so?
that you fet such gambauldes? Gestire (says Donat) is to notify, what the
mind thinks or des^re^h by the moving and gesture of the body. And it is
manifest, says he, that it is by translation taken of the property of brute
beasts, and referr^^ to man. And it may be referred as well to sorrow as to
gladness, or to any other affectione appetite or passion of the mind.

10 Quid sibi hic vestitus quaerit? What means this apparayle?

11 Quid est quod laetus sis? What is the matter why thou should be so glad?

living, whom I would more gladly see now at this present time then thee.

14 Narra istuc quaeso, quid siet, I pray thee tell what the matter is: siet,

the mids of a word.

14 Imo, ego to obsecro, vt audias, Nay mary, I pray you that you will hear it.

15 Nostin 'hanc, quam amat frater? Do you not know her here, yt my brother
is in love withal.

18 Elegans spector formarum, Very well skilled or seen in fair women, or, a
deinty fellow in chosing of fair women. For so does Donatus expound it.

20 Quid multa verba? s^loquar, What should I make many words?

20 Forte fortuna domi erat, As hap was he was at home, Haec fors says
Nonius Marc, ^ fors ab hac forte, is properly a chance that suddenly and
casuallye falls or happens at a time and Fortuna is the gods her self that
is the Fortune that every person has given unto him that such or such things
shall happen to him, or go from him. Actius in astianacte: Itera in quibus
partibus, namque audire volo, si est que^ exopto, and quo captus modo, fortuna
ne an forte^ reperitur, Tell and rehearse again in what parties, for I would
feign hear whether it be he that I desire to see, or not, and how he was
gotten, and whether he was found by Fortune, or else, by chance and casualty.
Idem in Andro. Multi, quibus natura praua magis quam fors aut fortuna obfuit,
Many unto whom the frowardnes of their naughty nature has done more harm the^
has either chance or Fortune. Lucil. in Saty.. Cui parilem fortuna locum,
fatumque tulit fors. Unto whom his fortune gave like place and degree, or state
of living, and chance gave desteny of death semblablye and aunswerable to the
same. Ibid. Aut forte omnino, aut fortuua vincere bello either by blind
chance, or else by fortune to get the victory in battle, Many times fors
fortuna and forte fortuna, are joined together by subo^on, as says Donat in
the third Scene of the third Act of Hecyra: and then it betokenneth bone
adventure, or sudden good chance and good Fortune. Terent. in Phor. O
Fortuna, O Fortuna, quantis commoditatibus Antipho^ hunc one^as^is d^em? Oh
Fortune, oh most good Fortune, with h^^ many commodityes, and good chances
have th^^ replenished this day to Antypho? Vbi Done Fortuna dicta est incerta
res, fors fortuna even tus fortunae bonus, Fortune is called ^ thing uncertain
Fors fortuna is a good chance, (...) end of that thing that was uncertain.
And again in the same place Fortuna and fors Fortuna be two contrary things,
for fors fortuna is the goddess whom they serve, and hauyng^ no occupation,
whereby to get their living whose temple was on the farside of Tiberis, ^^
that Fortuna is uncertain, and fors fortuna is in good chance. And thereof
Forte fortuna sometime as a noune, and sometime as an aduerbe, is that that we
say in English, in a good hour: or as good hap was,

22 Submonuit me Parmeno, Parmeno put m^ in mind by a bye word.

23 Tacitus, citius audies, Holding your peace you shall hear it the sooner.

24 Vt vestem acum eo mutem, That I should change garments with him.

25 Quid ex ea re capies commodi? What benefit shall thou get by that thing?

36 Iouem Danae misisse aiunt quondam in gremium imbrem aureum. They say that
Jupiter did on a time let fall into the lap of Danae a shoure of drops of
Gold.

39 Impendio magis animus gaudebat mihi. My heart was marvelous joyful and
glad, still more and more. Impendio, aduerbium intendedi, is as much as
impense, valde, apptime, great or very much: and it is commonly joined with the
comparatiue degree. Aul. Gel. li. 1. cap. 2. Erat ibidem nobiscum simul
adolescens, philosphiae sectator: disciplinae, vt ipse dicebat, stoicae, sed
loquacior impendio, and pro^ptior. There was in the same place together in
company with us a young man, student in philosophy, and (as he said him self)
of the sect of the Stoikes, but very talkatiue, too too full of words, and
marvelous ready thereto. And therefore it is read elega^tly joined with magis.
Cic. Atti. At ille impenpio magis odit senatu^. But he to to much hates the
Senators, or the nobles of the city. And also with Minus. Plau in Aulu. Atque
ille minus, minusque impendio curare, minusque me imperti^e honoribus. But he
set by me s^^ll less and less, by a great way, and did me less honor, and
showed me less cou^teste, when it is put without magis, it is indifferently
joined with the pos^ti^e degree, or else with the comparatiue, as Impe^dio
verbosus, Very full of words, or Impe^dio verbosior.

43 Homuncio hoc non facerem? Should I a fellow of no reputation, not do that?

43 Ego illud feci, ac lubens, I did that same and that with all my heart.

44 Dum haec mecum reputo, While I cast, (...) recounted these things in my
hand, Pu^am^ instantia, reputamus praeterita. Donat.

44 Accersitur lauatum virgo, The maiden was called to go and wash her.

46 Sto expecta^^ si quid mihi impere^t I stood (...) looked whether they would
bid me do any thing.

47 Cape flabellum, and ventulum facito, Take ^ flabell, and make a little
wind. Flabellum, a diminutiue of flabrum as labellum of labrum.

51 For As simul omnes prorunt se, They rushed out of the doors altogether in a
cluster* Abe^^ lauatum. They went to wash them.

52 Perstrepuunt, ita vt fit domini vbi absunt. They made a rubbinge in every
corner, that all the house was to little for them, as commonly it chances,
when the master or dame is out of the way.

53 Interea somnus virginem opprimit, In the mean while sleep took the
maiden, or, the maiden fell a sleep.

55 Pessulum ostio obdo, I sparred or bolted the door. Pessulus, li. i. paruus
pes a diminutiue of the nouue pes, and it is a bolt, or such like instrumente,
with which the doors be shut fast on the insyde. Apuleius. Subdita claui
pessules reduco, I put the key into the hoale, and pulled back the bolt, Plau.
in Aul. Occlude fores ambobus pessulis, iam ego hic adero Shut fas^ the door
with both the boltes, I will be here again by and by.

56 An ego occasionem mihi oste^tatam tam breuem, tam optatam, tam insperatam
amitterem? Should I have let go such opportunity and occasion being offered me
so short of time and respite, so greatly desired, so sudden and nothing looked
for?

59 Sane hercle vt dicis, In good sooth as you say.

59 Interim de symbolis quid actum est. In the mean season, what is done with
our banquet money. Symbolum. li. of the neuter gender, is the money that diverse
persons lay together, as in a common purse make good cheer withal, and such
banque^s are called collations, a collatu, that is of laying together every
one his portion.

60 Perlonge est sed tanto ocyus properemus. It is very far hence, but let us
make so much the more speed.

63 Domo exulo, I am banished from our house as who should say, I dare not go
thither, nor come there,

63 Metuo fratre^ ne intus sit. I fear my brother least he be within.

64 Metuo patrem ne rure redierit, I fear my father least he be come out of
the country again. Where note that the Accusative fratrem and patrem, be set
for the Nominatiues, by the figure Antiptosis.

65 Eamus ad me, ibi proximum vbi mntes. s. vestem Go we home to my house,
there is the niest place where you may change you.

67 Consilium volo capere vna tecum, I will take counsel with you, and see
what is best to be done.

Out of the fourth Act in the first Scene.
2 Timeo, ne quam ille hodie turbam faciat. I fear least that fellow will make
some business and trouble to day.

6 Id faciebat retinendi illius causa, He did it for to keep that other man
there.

7 Ad eam rem tempus non erat, There was no time for that.

10 Heus puer Pamphilam accerse, Hoe, thou lad go call Pamphila.

11 Minime gentium, No, in no wise in the world Minime gentium (says Festus)
dicebat veteres pro eo quod est, omnium gentium iudicio minime faciendum, the
Laten men of old time did use and take these words Minime gentiu^ as who
should say thus, a thing as all the people in the world would judge in no
manner wise to be done. So that Minime gentium (as testifyeth Valla in anno
contra Rau) is taken for Minime and gentium is a voice either emphaticos, or
else as an exple^iue added festiuitatis gratia, to these Aduerbes that follow,
Minime, Ter. in Ade. Ge^. Quapropter quoquo pacto caelato opus est. Sost^a, Ah
minime g^tium non facia^. Get. Wherefore in any wise it is expedient, that it
be kept secret. Sostrat. Tushe nay in no wise, I will not so do. Quo, Plaut, in
Rud. Non hercle quo hinc nunc gentium aufugiam, scio. By my truth I wot not
whither in the world to go now from hence. Quando, Plau in Amp. Amph. Quis te
misit furcifer? Sos qui me rogat? Amphit. Qua^do gentium Amph Who sent the
knave, Sos. Who says who? Amph. When? Long. Cic. Atti. li. 6. Non quo me
aliud iuuare posses, quippe res est in manibus tu autem abes long gentium. Not
that you could do me any help. For the matter is all ready in hand, and you
are distant a great way from me.

And also with these aduerbs. Nusquam, vndecunque, vbinam, vbiuis, vbique, vbi
with all other their compou^ds, as sicubi etc. where note that with these last
rehearsed, is read joined not only gentium, but also terrarum and locorum, and
with vbi is also joined s^metimes the voice of the genitive singular, loci. per
subunionem, Plau, in Cap. Prope modum vbi loci tuae fortunae sunt facile
intelligis, thou perceiuest very well in manner, in what case or state thou and
all that ever thou have, do stand. Idem in mer. Nam si isthuc ius est, saenecta
aetate scortari senes, vbi loci res summa nostra publica? For if this be
leefull that old folk in their old age may use the company of Harlots, then
where is our great high commune weal become? And in all these ye co^pou^ds
signify no more tha^ ye simples.

12 Vbi primum poterit se illinc subducet, sat scio As soon as he may possibly
he will privily steal away from thence, I know very well.

In the second Scene.
1 Dum rus eo, As I was going into the country.

2 Vbi quid in animo est molestiae, When there is any grief in the heart, or,
when there is any grief the heart, or when there is any grudge in the stomach.

3 Caepi mecum inter vias, aliam rem ex alia cogitare. By the way as I went I
began to cast in my mind, and to remember one thing after an other.

4 Dum haec reputo, praeterij imprudens villam. While I recounted these things
in my mind I was gone past my house in the country. Villa properlye is a
ferme house, or, a manor house, or any other house made and set without the
City to dwell in, and to have husbandry occupied, derived as Varro Li* 1* de re
rust. Cap. 2. says a vehendo of carrying: for that the husba^dman carries in
thither such fruits as come out of the ground: and semblably caryeth them out
again, when they must be sold. In Villa, most commonly are two parts, the
one that the Farmer, or hynd, or whatsoever person else, (occupying the
husbandrye, belonging unto the same) dwells in, and there makes, or, keeps
all manner instruments appertayning to husbandrye, as corn, carts, yokes for
exe^ etc. and that was called by the latin men of old time Villa rustica. The
other part is that which the Lord, or, owner reserueth and keeps for himself
to dwell in for his pleasure, and that was called Villa vrbana, because it was
in all points as goodly, and as well appointed, as becomes a house standing
within the city to be (and was more pleasauntlye builded, and more goodly
decked and better furnished with all implementes of household, and kept more
nete and clean, then for a house of the country. Varro. li. de re rust.
Fructuosior certe fundus est propter aedificia si potius ad antiquorum
diligentiam, quam ad horum luxuriam dirigas aedificatione^. Illi enim ad
fructu^ rationem faciebant, hi ad libidines indomitas. Itaque illorum villae
rusticae erant maiores, quam vrbanae, quae nunc sunt pleraeque. Of a very
certayntye a man's ground is the more fruitful and profitable for the housing
that is builded upon it, if a man order and fashion the buildinge and framing
and setting up of it after the diligent fashion of men of old time, rather then
after the prodigal excessive and over sumptuous fashion of men that are now a
days. For the men of old time made their buildinges in the country, as was
most convenient for the fruits of the ground to be received thereinto, and
now a days they build for pleasure, that is never ruled by any reason, nor
never satisfied, therefore their Villae rusticae were bigger and larger the^
many Villae vrbanae that are now a days.

5 Long iam abieram, I was already gone beyond it a great way.

5 Cum sensi, redeo rursum, when I perceived it. I came back again.

7 Vbi ve^i ad diuerticulum, constiti, when I came to the place where the way
turns in, I stood still.

8 Occepi mecum cogitare, I began to think in my mind.

8 Biduum hic manendum est. I must abide here by the space of two days.

9 Quid tum posten? What then?

10 Si non tangendi copia est, eho ne videndi quidem erit? If I may not have
leave to touch it, what shall I not be suffered to look upon it neither?

10 Si illud non licet, saltem hoc licebit, If I may not do that, yet at least
way this may I do.

14 Timida subito egreditur Pythias, Pythias being in fear comes forth
hastily.

In the third scene.
1 Vbi ego illum scelerosum, atque impium inueniam? Where may I find that
ungracious and wicked fellow?

4 Ludificatus est virginem. He beguyled the maiden.

Vestem omnem misere discidit, He al to cut her cote, that pity it was to see.

5 Ipsam capillo conscidit, He tore her by the hair.

7 Vt ego vnguibus illi in oculos inuole^, Oh how I would fly on him with my
nails, and scratch out his eyes.

8 Nescio quid absente nobis turbatum est domi. There has been some business,
or trouble, or there has been some shrewde turn done at home (whatsoever it
is) while I have been away forth. Here is (says Donat,) either Abse^te set
for a Preposition, governing an ablative case, as when it is said, coram nobis,
coram amicis, etc. or else, which I more allow, and think better said) the
figure Archaismos, that is an imitation of speakinge of the old time. For the
antiquitye used absente nobis for absente me, or rbsentibus nobis. Plaut. in
Amph. Si in action hanc absente nobis inuenit puer. If the boy found and
took her with the manner in the deed doing, while I was away, And likewise
praeesente nobis for praesentibus nobis. Plaut. in Amph. Nec nobis praesente
aliquis nisi seruus Aphricanus adest, Neither any man but the servant that
came out of Aphrique was here while I was present. Ibidem. Nec nobis praesente
quisquam aliquis ausi sunt And while I was present they durst not, not any one
of them all.

Pom. Qui apud forum paesente testibus mihi vendidit. Which sold it unto me
openly in the street before witness. Idem. Sine ergo isthue, praesente amicis
inter scoenam, let this alone now, we will speak more of it in the supper
time when our friends be present.

Varro in Marcellum ex Donato. Id praesente legatis omnibus exercitu
pronunciabat, He spoke that only in the host, all the ambassadoures being
there present,

8 Quid festinas, aut quem quaeris? Why highest thou so fast, or whom seckest
thou for?

9 Abi hinc quo dignus es cum donis tuis tam lepidis. I^ speed or il luck
take you for me with your gifts being so goodly and proper.

10 Quid is it huc est rei? What is the matter?

11 Quas turbas dedit? What trouble, or what array, has he made?

12 Virginem vitiauit, he has defloured a maide^.

13 Temulentus es? Thou art drunken.

13 Vtinam sic sint, qui mihi male volunt, would God mine evil willers were in
that case.

14 Quidnam istuc monstri fuit? What a monster was that, what monstrum is, it
is showed before.

15 Ego illum nescio qui fuerit. I know him not what he was.

16 Hoc quod fecit res ipsa indicat, this that he has done, the thing it
self does plainly show.

18 Ille-bonus vir nusquam apparet, That honest man cannot be seen.

19 Suspicor aliquid domo abeuntem abstulisse I mistrust that he stol^ and
took away some what, when he went out of the house.

19 Nequeo mirari satis, quo ille abire ignauus possit longius, nisi si domum
forte ad nos redierit, I cannot marvel enough whyther that luske could go
far, except if peradventure he be gone home again to our house.

21 Vise amabo number ibi sit, go see as ever I shall love you, or, as ever I
shall do you good turn whether he be there. Amabo, is after some an aduerbe of
exhorting, or after some other an in teriection of flattering and louinge, and
it is the same that we say in english, as ever I shall do you good turn, or
pleasure, or as ever I shall love you. Plaut. Noli amabo Amphitrio irasci
Sosiae causa mea, as ever I shall love you Amphitrio, be not angry with Sosta,
for my sake. And it is indifferently referred to one singular, or else to many.
Idem in Truc. Properate, mensam afferte amabo. H^e at once and bring the table
I pray you. Orators use in the same signification, also amabo te, and amame.
Ci. Cassio. Et amabo te, cum dabis post hac aliquid domu^ literarum, mei
memineris. And as ever I shall love you, when you shall from henceforth send
any letter home, remember me. Id. Attic. Amabo te incu^be in eam rem, and ad me
scribe. As ever I shall owe you my hearty love, stick well to that matter, and
write unto me. Eidem Amame, non libenter lidi, sed modo succenset, modo gratias
agit? As ever you may trust or love me, I saw it not gladly, but somewhyle
he is angry, and somewhyle he gives thanks. See more examples in Hadrian,
de. ser. lati. Linacre says that Amabo and amabo te, is Enallage, that is a
verb, (says he) or a whole sense for an aduerbe. For Enallage is when one
part of spech is put for an other. And amabo has not the second syllable
short* as Calepine and Thesaurus lin. la. and others would have it* setting
acutum acce^tum in prima, but long as Cat. Amabo mea dulcis Ipsiphil la
Martial: li. 8. Di^ verum mihi Marce dic amabo, Sidonius ad Faeli. Dic quod
peto Magne, dic amabo. That no man be deceived in accenting that word.

22 Tam infandum facinus ne audiui quidem, So

2^ abominable a deed I have never hard of,

23 Pol ego amatores audieram esse mulierum eo^ maximos, In deed I had herd
say that they were the greatest lovers of women that be.

25 Illum aliquo conclusissem. I would have shut him up fast in some corner.

In the fourth Scene.
1 Exi for as sceleste. Come forth thou naughty pack.

1 At etiam restitas? What, do thou stop, and draw back st^l.

2 Prodi fugitive. Come forth thou runnaway.

3 Illuc vide os vt sibi distorsit carnifex, i^scelestus? See yond how the
slouen knave makes awrye mouth?

4 Quid huc reditio est? Wherrfore art thou come hither again?

5 Si paululum cessassem, domi non offendissem. If I had tarried a little longer,
I should not have found him at home.

6 Iam ornabat fuga^, He was even about to run away.

7 Habesne hominem amabo? Have you gotten the field I pray you?

10 Hunc oculis suis nostrum nunquam quisquam vidit. Not one of us ever set his
eye on this fellow.

^^ An tu hunc credidisti esse obsecro? Did you think that it had been this
man, I pray you?

^^ Ne comparandus hic quidem ad illum est. Nay this fellow is not to be
compared with him, or, this fellow is not to be likened to him.

^^ Ille erat honesta facie and liberali. He had a goodly and a well favored
face, or he was both fair and well favored. For that signifies liberalis
sometime joined with facies, as here, or with forma. Terenr in Andr. Et quia
erat forma praeter caeteras honesta ac liberali, accedo ad pedissequas, rogo
quae sit, And because she was more goodly, and more fair, and beautiful, the^
any of the other, I came unto the maidens, that waited on her, and required
what shec was.

^5 Ita visus est dudum. So he seemed erewhile.

^6 Varia vest exornatus fuit, he was trimmed in in gay apparel. Varia, id
est, multiformi, versieolori.

^7 Nunc tibi videtur foedus, Now you think him foul and it favored, Foedum
is that that is foul, ill favored, and loathsome to look on.

^8 Tace obsecro, Hold thy peace I pray thee.

^8 Quasi vero paulum intersiet for intersit, per epenthesin, As who says,
there was but small difference between them,

^9 Ad nos deductus hodie est adolescentulus que^ tu vero videre velles, there
was brought home to our house to day, such a young man, as a man would be glad
to seee, or such a young man, as a man would be the better in his ha^ to look
on.

21 Hic est vetus, vietus, veternosus, senex, color mustelino, This is an old
rusty thief, rotten, and weak, unlusty, and all to riueled, and as tawny
colored as a wesell.

Vetus is old Plau. in Amphi. Veterem and antiquam rem, nouam ad vos proferam I
will show you an old antique thing, burnished and made new again, or I will show
you a new thing made of an old. And sometime (as witnesses Donatus in this
place of Terence) Vetus is referred to rebuking and reproving.

Terentius in prologo Andriae, Qui maleuoli veteris poetae maledictis respond
eat. How he may make answer to the raylinge of that old rusty Poet his
adversary. Idem in prologo Heautont. Tum quam maleuolus vetus poeta dictat
repent ad studium hunc se applicasse musicum. i. musarum, hoc est bonarum
literarum. And further, whereas the enuyous old naughy poet allegeth that this
man suddenly applied himself to the study of good letters. I Would in prologo
Phormi. Postqua^ poeta vetus, poetam non potest retrahere a studio etc. now y^
the nauhty rotten Poet cannot withdraw this Poet Terence from study Vietus
Donate expounds mollis, flaccidusque, and flexibils corpore, Weak and lanke
and ^^mmer of body.

Vietus says Fest. Pom. dicitur languidus, sine vi, and naturalibus priuatus
viribus. Weak faint, or wearish, droupinge without an^e strength, or lacking
natural strength. Cice. de senect. Sed tamen necesse fuit esse aliquod
extremu^, and tanquam in arborum baccis, terraeque frugibus maturirate
tempestiua, quasi vietu^ and eadu^um, quam ferendum est molliter sapienti. But
yet it could not be chosen, but their should be some term and end, and like as
in the berryes of trees, and in the corn growing on the ground, at what time
they be through ripe) as who should say, fayntnes, weakness, and failing in
strength, and to be ready to fall and to decay in strength, and being mortal
which a wise man ought to take patiently. So the vieatum is weak, limmer,
faint, and without any strength and thereof comes vimina and vimenta ofters
that is the limber twigges of willow, that the ^unneylers, or, Cowpers occupy
about their houpes, with which they bynd their tubbes, or barelles. And vier^
is to bynd tubbes, or barrels, or other vessels with such twigges. And victor
is the coper that does make and bind them. Veternosus properly is he that
has the disease which is called in Latin veternus in greek (...) of Auicen,
^ and Physicians subetum or subetium, that is a disease ingendring in the body
continual desire of sleepinge by reason of to much ^d^enes, and ease,
otherwise called sluggardye, slouthfulnes. Which disease because it is most
commonly in aged persons, therefore veternosus is match taken and used for him
that is diseased with sleep^nes or as they say) drousines, so that he has no
(...) to bestirre him, but rather to sit still as (...) with continual
slumberyng and sleeepe. for Veternus is taken for unmeasurable, (...) overmuch
sleep.

Pli. li. 8. nature. histor. speaking of bears, Primis diebus bis septenis iam
graui somno (...) premuntur, vt ne vulneribus quidem (...) queant, tune mirum
in modu^ veterno pinquescunt. The first fourteen days, Bears (...) oppressed
with so heavy sleep, that they cannot be wakened and made to arise though a
man wound them right fore, and the^ they wax wonderful fat in that long
and continual sleep Cato takes Veternosum, for one having the hydropsie,
where he says: Veternosus quam plurimu^ bibit, tam maxim si^it, He that has
(...) hydropsie, the more he drinks the more thirs^^ he is Senex (in this
place of Terence) is taken for rugosus withered and ^tueled.

22 Quae haec est fabula ^ What a tale, or saying have we here?

23 Eo me redigis, vt quid egerim egomet nescia^. Thou bring me to that
point that I cannot tell mine own self, what I have done.

25 Venistin' hodie ad nos? Came thou to our house to day?

26 At illic alterivenit annos natus sedecim. But that other came, being of the
age of sixtene years.

27 Agedum hoc mihi expedi. Come of, tell me this at ones:

28 Istam quam habes vnde habes vestem? This garment that thou have on thee,
where gottest thou it? or how came thou by it?

30 Quam dudum? How long agone, or how little while agone?

31 Quicum? with whom?

31 Noras ne eum prius? Did thou know him before?

33 Vnde igitur fratrem meu^ esse sciebas? Whereby then know thou, that he
was my brother?

34 Is dedit hanc vestem mihi, He gave me this coat.

35 Vna ambo abierunt for as, They went forth of doors both together.

36 Iam satis credis me nihil meritum? do you now believe well that I made no lie.

37 Certum est virginem vitiatam esse. Certain it is and out of paraduenture,
that the maiden is defloured or, has lost her virginity, or (...) we say in
an english proverb, she has caught a a clap.

38 Credis huic quod dicat? Do thou believe such a one as this is, what he
says?

38 Quid isti credam? What should I believe this peevish fellow? For iste most
times betokens and imports a certain contempt.

38 Res ipsa indicat, The matter it self shows plainly.

39 Concede isthuc paululum, Go a little that way, come a little near hither to
me. For isthuc here is taken for huc.

40 Dic dum hoc rursum, Tell me this yet once ^ again.

42 Jupiter magne, o seelestum atque audace^ hominem, Good Lord, oh what a
naughty, or ungracious bold fellow is that?

43 Vae mihi, etiam nunc non credis indignis no^ esse irrisus modis? Alas, do
thou not yet believe, that we have been deluded and scorned shamefully and in
ungodly mannet?

44 Mirum ni tu credis quod iste dicat, It is marvel, but you do believe that
this peevish fellow says.

45 Pessum ne hodie te exculpere verum. Shall not I be able to get out the
truth of thee, ere I go? Exculpere properlye is to grave out, or to carue, as
a man carueth an image, and per metaphoram, it is taken sometimes pro
extorquere, to extort, or to get out by vyolence, or punishment the truth, if
any thing that a man desires to know. Plaut. Quot illi blanditias, quid
promisi boni, quot admoui fabricas and quot fallacias in quaestione vix
exculpsi vt diceret? With what fair words did I handle him, what fair and
goodly promises did I make unto him, how many wily imaginations, and how many
subtiltyes, wherewith to be guyle him did I set and lay unto him in examininge
him, and yet I could uneath get out of him? to tell it for any thing I could
do unto him. Fabrica properlye is a forge, or frame of a carpenter or workman,
of Fabricor, aris, to frame, and per metaphoram, to invent, or to ymagine, and
thereof Fabricas here is taken for fallacias, and those two words signify
one thing, and the coniunctio^ copulative and coming between them is taken for
id est.

46 Non potest sine malo fateri, video, He cannot be made to confess it
without punishmente I see well.

47 Sequere me hac, come after me this way here.

47 Modo ait, modo negat. Somewhyle he says yea, and somewhyle nay.

48 I intro go thy ways in

49 Honest quo modo hinc abeam nescio. I can not tell how to get, or how to
depart hence with mine honesty.

50 Tu me hic nebulo ludificabere? Shall thou mock me here thou mock? or,
thou villayne shall thou scorn and make a laughinge stock of me here.

51 Parmenonis tam scioesse hanc techua^, quam me viuere, I do as well know that
this is the crafty ymagination of Parmeno, as I know that I am alive. Techne
is a greek word and properlye signifies any craft, and by translation it is
taken for craftye and subtle ymaginations Plautus. in Cap. Ego arumnatus,
deartuatus sum miser, scelesti hominis technis, qui me vt lubitum, est,
ductauit dolis, I unfortunate body am brought to misery and in manner pulled in
pieces through the craftines and subtlety of this naughty fellow which has led
me with his trappes and guiles even as him listed, Deartuare properly is to
cut, or to hew in pieces one part or member from an other, as traitors be
deartuati, when they be quartered,

52 Inueniam hodie parem vbi referam gratiam. I will ere I sleep tynd some
thing, whereinto requite him.

53 Quin nunc faciendum censes? What think you best to be done now?

54 Vtrum taceam an praedicem, Whether should I keep it secret, or utter it?

54 Tu pol si sapis, quod, scis nescis, Verily, if you be wise, that that you
know, you will not know.

56 Hac re and re omni turba euolues, and illi gratum feceris, By this thing
doing, thou shall both tidde, wynd, and quit thy self out of al trouble, and
also do him great pleasure.

57 Id modo dic abisse Dorum for abijsse per syncopen, Say thou nothing but
this, Dorus is gone his way.

58 Cum inde abeo, iam tum inceperat turba inter eos. When I came my ways from
thence, they had already begun to be at strife and to make business, and to
quarrel together.

59 Aufer aurum hoc, Have away this gold.

59 Ego scibo ex hoc quid sciet, I will know of this man here, what the matter
is.

In the fifth Scene.
1 Data verba mihi sunt, I am deceived.

1 Vicit vinum quod bibi, The wine that I have drunken, has ouercommed me, as
who should say, I feel my self drunken.

2 Dum accubabam, videbar mihi pulchre sobrius All the while that I sat at the
table me thought I was very sober, and in very good temper. Pulchre. i. valde,
oppido, nimis, admodum.

3 Postquam surrexi. neque pes, neque men's satis suum officium facit. Now that
I am up, neither my feet, nor my wit serves me very well.

4 Vah quanto nunc fo^mosior videre mihi quam dudum? Oh how much fayrer seem
you to me now, then you did while ere?

6 Verbum hercle hoc verum est, Certes this is a true saying.

7 An abijt iam? Is he gone already?

8 Lites sunt inter eos maximae, There is very great striefe and debate between
them, Or they be at great words together, For that signifies properly lites,
striving in words.

9 Abiens mihi innuit, When he went away he^ becked on me.

10 Nonne id sat erat? Was not that enough?

10 Nesciebam id dicere illam, I knew not that she meant that by her saying,
or by her words that she spoke

11 Intellexi minus, I understood it not.

11 Me extrusit for as, He thruste me out of the doors.

12 Miror vbi ego huic anteuerterim. I maruaill in what place I got before this
man, that I saw him not.

In the sixth Scene.
1 Credo illum iam affuturum esse, I think verily that he will be here anon,

2 Si illam digito attigerit vno, oculi illico effodientur* If he touch her
with one finger, his eyes shall be pulled out of his head immediately. Vno digito,
a proverb read in Chil. Erasmi.

3 Ego illius far possum ineptias, and magnifica verba, verba, dum sint, I
can very well bear and suffer his foolishenes and his royal high words, so
long as they be nothing but words.

4 Verum enim si ad rem conferantur, vapulabit, But in faith, if they turn to
d^edes, he shall aby, or he shall smarte. Conferantur. 1. transferantur,
conuertantur. s. verba And it is a proper and elegant manner of speaking, says
Donat: as if a man should say in latin, He began to do as he said, he may say
it properly in latin thus. Verba ad rem contulit. i. id quod verbis dixetat, te
facere aggressus est.

5 Iamdudum adsum. I am here and have been a good while. Dudum and iamdudum
betoken and be spoken of shorter time, as of one, or two, or three, or four
hours. Nuper, pridem, and iampridem, of somewhat longer time, as of six
months or years, or more or less, as the matter is. But dudum and iamdudum,
pridem and iampridem, have this difference that dudum nuper, and pridem, do
signify the a^te of the verb to be ended and past, and therefore they be most
commonly and most elegantly joined with verbes of pretertenses, as, ^ee went
away a good while since, Dudum abijt. He wrote unto me long agone of that
matter. Ea de re pridem ad me scripsit. He was in the city of late days, Fuit
nuper in vrbe. Iamdudum and iampridem, signify the act of a verb, remayninge
and continuinge still, and therefore most usually they be joined with verbes
of the present tense thus. The master is in the schole, and has been a pretty
while, Iamdudum praeceptor est in schola. He is a very great friend of mine,
and has been many a day. Iampridem est mihi amicissimus. Yet both these are
much and often times read joined with verbes of pretertences, and contrariwise,
that others with verbes of the present ^ence, as shows Laur. Vall lib. 2
eleg. cap. 34.

5 O mi Chreme, te ipsum expecta^am* O sweet Chremes, I looked for you, and no
man else.

6 Scin' tu turbam hanc propter te esse factam? Do thou know or consider,
that all this business or trouble has been for thee?

6 Scin' ad te attinere hanc omnem rem? Do thou remember, that all this
matter perteyneth to thee, or touches thee, or lies thee upon?

7 Dum tibi sororem studeo reddere, and restituere, While I go about and
labor to render, and to restore to you your sister.

8 Haec atque huiusmodi multa passus sum, I have suffered these things, and
many other like or have had this, or much other like trouble.

9 Est domi apud me, He is at home at my house.

11 Hoc tibi dono do, I give this unto you freely. Dono dare, to give freely.
For diverse verbs be construed and elegantly joined with a double Dartue, of
which one is set in manner aduerbially, and much like an aduerbe, and yet is
none. As thou hopest to have laud and praise for the same thing, which thou
layest unto me as a fault, Speras id tibi laudi fore, quod mihi vitio vertis.
Take thou no care, nor thought for the matter. Ne sit tibi curae. He has laid
his coat to pledge to me Dedit mihi vestem pignoti. He has put put money in
my hands in the way of vsurye. Dedit mihi pecuniam foenori. He has lent me
a groate. Dedit mihi mutuo dtachmam. He has lent me a gown, Dedit mihi
vestem commodato. And so here in Terence, Hanc tibi dono do* For hanc I put
hoc, because it is more in use, and more convenient to be spoken, For which
cause. I change almost every where in this book the feminine gender, into
the masculine, or neuter, as the place best admits.

Cave neprius quam hoc a me accipias amittas, Beware that you leese it not
before you receive or have it of me.

Cistellam domo effer cu^ monumentis. Bring forth the little coffer with the
tokens.

18 Number formidolosus obsecro es? Art thou fearful or false hearted, or does
thy heart fail thee man I pray thee? for (as Denate says) formidolosus is the
same that terribilis, metuendus, to be feared, and also timidus, fearful or
false hearted.

19 Egon' formidolosus? Nemo est omnium qui metuat minus. I false hearted?
there is no man alive that fears less.

20 Quem tu me hominem, existimas? i. qualem. what manner of fellow think thou
that I am.

21 Cogitato quicum res tibi est. Remember with whom thou have to do. Quicum.
i. cum quo: For some prepositions are sometime contrary to ye nature of
prepositions set after their case: as mecum, tecum, secum, nobiscum, vobiscum,
and not cum me, te, se, nobis, vobis. The matter, whereof we communed
yesterday, came nothing to pass, as I would have it, Res qua de sumus he^i
collouti, minime mihi cessit ex sententia. So ore tenus, Italiam versus, ad
orie^tem vsque quapropter. etc. And whereas quis has the ablative both quo and
qui, we may indifferently say cum qui, and quicu^, in all genders. Cic. Ser.
Sulpit. lib. 4. epis. fami. Nemo est omnium, quicum potius mihi, quam tecum
co^municandum putem. There is no man alive, with whom I think I ought rather
to commune of mine affairs then with you. And also plurally we say
indifferently cum quis bus and quibuscum, quicum, or cumqui.

21 Peregrinus est, minus potens quam tu, minus notus, amicorum hic habens
minus. He is a stranger here, and less may do then you, he is less
acquaynted, and has fewer friends in these parts.

23 Quod cauere possis stultum est admittere. It is a foolishnes to suffer that
ill to be done that a man may avoid. Admittere. i. fieri sinere says Donat,
and cauere here I take for propellere and declinare.

24 Malo ego nos prospicere, quam hunc vlcisci accepta iniuria. I have liefer,
or I had rather that we provide for the matter before, then to be revenged on
him after that we have had a shrewd turn. Prospicere here is taken for
prouidere, to foresee, and so to provide a remedy against ill that might else
chance. Cic. de sen. Multi cum remissi ac liberi sunt, futura prospiciunt.
Many when they be at quet, and at liberty, they foresee things, that shall
follow, or come after.

Idem ser. Sulp. Tanquam ex aliqua specula prospexitempestatem futuram, I
foresawe the tempest that should follow as though I had been in some high
place to see every way round. For that signifies properly specula, whether it
be a hill, or a tower, or a rock, or a stone, or a tree, or else what: being of
such heyght, that one may see far every way round about.

25 Tu abi atque ostium obsera intus. Go thou and lock the door on the insyde.

25 Ego hinc transcurro ad forum, I will run, or make a start from hence into
the street.

Now Forum is to be taken in such manner speakinges as this, it showed before in
Andria.

30 Si vim faciet, in ius ducito hominem. If he shall offer to do any thing by
force, vyolence or strengh of hand, co^mence a fair action against him, and
go to the law with him.

31 Fac animo haec praesenti dicas, see that thou speak this with a bold
spirit, as who should say, that thy wits by thine own, and that thy heart
fail thee not, when thou should speak this.

31 Attolle pallium. Take vy your cloak about you Pallium here is taken pro
chlamide.

32 Huic ipsi est opus patrono, quem ego defensorem paro. He whom I go about
to make mine advocate, or man of law, or defender of my cause, or my
spokesma^, himself has need of one to defend him Patronus is he that
defends another man being in trouble or peril.

In the senenth Scene.
1 Ha^^^in^ ego contumeliam tam insignem in me accipiam. Should I suffer such a
notable, or shameful despyte to be done unto me? hic haee insignis, and hoc
insigne, is that this is very notable, whether it be in good, or in ill, as we
say insignis virtute, and insignis flagitijs.

2 Mo^i me satius est. I were better be dead.

4 Male mulctabo ipsum. I will punish him sharply. Mulctabo. i. puniam here,
for mulctare properly is for to punish by the purse.

^ Imperatoris virtutem noueram and vim militu^. I knew the manliness, or
valpauntnesse of the Capytayne, and the strength or power of his soldiers.

^ Noueram sine sanguine hoc fieri non posse, I knew well that this could
never be done, or ended without bloodshed.

10 Solus Sannio seruat domum. No man but Sannio keeps the house.

11 Omnibus signum dabo. I will give unto all the compainy a token of knowledge
when they shall begin.

12 Illuc est sapere, That is one poyncte of wisdom.

12 Vt hosce instruxit, ipse sibi cauit loco. After that he had set the others
in array, he provided for him self to stand in a fure place, out of all
peril and danger.

13 Idem hoc Pyrrhus factitauit. The very self same thing used Pyrthus to do.

13 Viden'tu, quam hic. rem agit? Do thou see, where about this fellow
goes?

14 Nim irum consilium illud rectum est, de occlu dendis aedibus. Certes that
is right good counsel, that I gave you, to shut in your doors against him.

15 Hic nebulo magnus est, This is a great lubberly knave.

16 Ne metuas, Be not a^card.

16 Omnia prius experiri quam armis sapientem decet. It is the part of a wise
man to prove and assay all other ways, ere he fight for any thing.

20 Qui scis an que iubeam sine vi faciat. What know thou, whether he will
do that thou shall command and enjoin him peaceably, or without compu^sion?

20 Dijvostram fidem, O good lord in heaven, an interiection of maruayling

21 Quanti est sapere? What a great matter it is to have perfect wisdom?
quanti est. i. quam magna res est.

21 Nunquam accedo, quin abs te abeam doctior. i prudentior, I never come unto
you, but that I part from you wiser then I came.

22 Primum hoc mihi responde, First anuswere me to this.

26 Quid cum illo agas? What should thou do with him? or, what should one do
with such a man?

26 Cum eo clam subduxti te mihi. Thou conueyghedst thy self away, or, thou
stolest away privily out of my company, and wentest with him Subduxti for
Subduxisti, per Syocope^. And clam here is an aduerbe. For boyses of
prepositions when they govern no case, are changed always into aduerbes.
Libuit s. mihi. It was my pleasure.

27 Pamphilam huc read, nisi vi mauis ^ripi, Restore me hither Pamphila with
good will, except thou will have her taken away fr^ the perforce and by
strength of hand.

29 Quid tu tibi vis? What would thou have* or what meanest thou?

30 Nescis, cui maledicas nunc viro You wot not on what manner of man you rail
now, or thou know not unto what manner a man thou geuest or speak evil
words now.

30 Non tu hinc abis? will thou not get thee hence?

31 Si quicquam hodie hic turbae coeperis, faciam vt huius loci dieique meique
so^per memineris. It thou begin to make any trouble, or any ado here at
this time. I will give thee a cause to think on this place, and this day, and
also on me, as long as thou shall live.

33 Miseret me tui, qui hunc tantum hominem facias inimicum tibi. I have pity
on thee, that thou geuest unto him here, being so great a man, cause and
occasion to be thine enemy, or thy heavy master.

34 Diminnam ego tibi caput, nisi abis. I will break thy head, except thou get
thee hence.

34 Ain' vero canis? say thou so, in deed, thou curr^she Knave? Canis
(says Donate) is a word that men use to obtect unto such as be impudent and
shameless follows, or to any others in despite and for a great contuinely or
check, as now in this time, the Turks call us Christian men, dogs, and one
enemy in time of war, calls any soldier on the contrary part, dog, in
despite. And it is taken of the Greeks for those, whom the Latin men call
impudentes, shameless fellows, the Greeks call properly kynopas^i: Canino
aspectu homines. Men looking like Dogs.

35 Quis tu homo es? What man art thou, or, who art thou?

37 Edico tibi, ne vim facias vllam in illum. I charge thee, that thou ^ay no
violent hands on me

39 Tu me prohibeas, meum ne tangam? Shall thou let me to lay hand on that,
that is mine own?

40 Hic furti se alligat. He charge himself of felony or trespass. Alligat
se furti (says Donatus). ^. reum le efficit fraudis, Alligat. i. astringit.
laqueat, and obnoxium facit. Entang^eth and brings him self in danger of
impechement. And furtum is not only theft or robbery, but also all manner
felony, or other injury, fraud, deceit, guile, or any trespass, whatsoever it
be, that is in latyne, Omne maleficium generaliter.

41 Satis hoc tibi est. That is enough for thee.

41 Idem hoc tu ais? say thou even the ^ame to?

41 Quaere qui respondeat. Look whom thou will to answer thee, for I will
not.

42 Quid nunc agimus? what shall we do now?

42 Iam tibi aderit supplicans vltro, He will come to you anon of his own
mind, and desire you on his knees to be good unto him.

43 Noui ingenium mulierum nolunt vbi velis, vbi nolis cupient vltro. I know
the nature and guise of Women, they will not when a man Would have them, and
when he would no^ then are they desirous and feign with all their hearts, and
of their own minds,

45 Domi ^ocique fac memineris. See that thou remember to go home, and make a
good fire.

47 Iamdudum est animus in patinis, My mind is on my dinner, and has been a
good while.

47 Vos me hac sequimini. Come you after me this way.

Out of the fifth act. In the first Scene.
1 Pergin' seeleste mecum perplex^ loqui? Do thou yet still speak
ambiguously and doubtfully unto me thou naughty pack?

3 Non tu isthuc mihi dicturus aperte es quicquid est? Will thou not tell me
plainly, whatsoever it is?

5 Quid factum est? What has been done?

6 Quid tibi ego dica^? What should I tell thee?

7 Quis fuit igitur? Who was it than?

9 Quid ais venefica? What say thou poysonfull queen?

9 Certo comperi. I have certain knowledge of, Or, I am assured it is true.

11 Occidi, si quidem tu isthaec vera praedicas, I am undone at least wise if
that be true that thou say.

13 Number id lachrumat virgo? Does the maiden weep for that? or therefore?

13 Quid ais sacrilega? What say thou naughty ^^^^he?

14 Istuccine interminata sum hinc abiens tibi? Did not I charge thee upon a
great pain, when I went hence, that this should not be done?

15 Quid facerem? What should I have done? a proper and elegant loc^tion, or
manner of speking, and much in use among authors whereof who lists may read
more examples in Hadrian* de ser. lat.

15 Ita vt iussisti soli credita est. She was left with him alone according
to your commandment.

16 Ouem lupo commisisti, Thou migtest as well have committed and left a sheep
with a wolf to keep. Ouem Lupo co^mittere, is a proverb used, whenever we
will signifye any thing committed unto him for whose cause, and for fear of
whom, it had rather been expediente and requisite to have had an other keeper.

16 Dispudet sic mihi data esse verba. I am ill ashamed, that I should be in
such wise beguyled.

17 Quid hominis illic est? What fellow is that?

19 Habemus hominem ipsum. We have espied or found very him that did the deed,

21 Quid illi faciemus* What shall we do unto him. The pure Latin authors do
use elegantly this manner speakinge by the Dative case, as well by facio, as
also by fio passiuely thus, Quid illi faciemus? quid illi fiet? For that which
some foolish fellows (says he) speak thus, Quid de illo faciemus? Quid de
illo fiet. Cic. in Academ quest. Quid enim faceret huic conclusioni. What
should he do to such a conclusion as this is etc. Id in Rullum.

Quaero siqui volunt vendere non fuerint quid pecunia fie^^ I demand this
question, if there shall be none that will fell it, what shall be done with the
money? And Cato de tust. uses the same manner speaking without interrogation.
Si ante non deportauerit dominus, vino quod volet faciet. If the owner do not
carry it down before, he shall do with the Wine what he will. This
notwithstanding I have noted diverse places in Terence where he uses to speak
by the same verbes joined with the ablative case without a preposition, as much
as with the ^ati^e. Terent* in Heaut. act. 1 sc. 2. Quia enim incertum est
etiam quid se faciat, For because that in deed he is yet uncertain, or in
doubt what to do with him self. Inibi. act. 2. sc. 3. Cedo quid hic faciet
sua^s^amica? Why tell me what shall Clitipho here do with his own lover? Idem
in Andr. act. 3 scen. 5. Pamph^* Nec quidem quid me faciam scio Da. nec equidem
me Pamph. And in good ^oth* I cannot tell what I may do with my self. Da. Nor
I with my self. And again also in the same places, Quid me fiet? what shall
become of me^ I omitie, that many of the examples, that Hadrian cyteth and
alleges, may be taken as well in the Ablative as in the Dative, that no child
fear nor doubt to speak by both cases. Albeit Plaut. in Casina (at least wise
if the book be not corrupt, but have the true letter, as all examplaryes do
consent and agree speaks in the same sense by the accusative. Quid agis tu
marite? mi vir, vnde ornatu hoc aduenis? quid fecisti Scipionem? aut quid
habuisti pallium? What do you husband my good sweet husband, from whence come
you thus arrayed? What have you done with your staff or what cloak have you
had? Quid fecisti Scipionem for de Scipione? or (more elegantly to speak)
Scipioni in the Dattue, or Scipione in the Ablative. Scipio, ^nis, is latin
for a s^affe? And thereof the Fam^^ye of the Noble Scipions in Rome, had their
first Name. For that one Cornelius ^id lead about his Father being blind and
stood him in steed both of his Eyes and also of a staff, for which thing
men look up, and used to call him Scipio, and so all his Family after him were
semblably named Scipiones, of the cognomination of the said Cornelius.

32 Vide amabo, si non, cum aspicias, o^ impudens videtur. See I pray you, if
when a Body looks on him he seem not to have an impudent look, or a
shameless face.

^3 Quae eius confidentia est? How bold he is or how great impudency, or
lack of shame is in him? Confido, confidis, confisus sum, confidere, Confisum,
co^fisu, to have sure hope, trust and confidence, as now we say also in
english, and it is referred as well to the present time as to the time past,
and also to the time to come as witnesses Donate and Valla. And confido dis,
is used in bonam partem, and yet confidens and confidentia, coming of the same
verb, is observed by custom and use of speakinge, to be almost ever taken and
used in malo, and very seldom in the good part. And fidutia is in manner
evermore taken in the better part, as may appear in Valerius maximus, in the
3, book, where he makes an intitulation, De fiducia sui.

In the second scene.
1 Vterque pater and matter, quasi dedita opera domi erant, vt nullo modo
introire possem, quin viderent me. Both my father and my mother were at home,
as if it had been appointed for the nones, so that I might by no means get in
but that thy must needs have seen me.

4 Dum ante ostium sto. While I was standing before the door.

4 Notus mihi quide^ obuiam venit, One of mine acquayntaunce came and met me.

5 Ego me in pedes quantum queo, conij^io, I took me to my feet, as fast as I
might run.

7 Miserrimus fui fugita^do, ne quis me cognosceret, I was very ill troubled,
encombred, and vexed, or as we say in English prouerbially, in a whole pecke
of troubles, in running out of the way that no man might know me. And it is (as
Donatus notes) a very elegant manner of speaking, to say miser fugitando as
miser amando. Albeit he does interpret miserrimus here Iassus, fatigatus, and
lanquidus, werye, ^yred, and faint, and cognosceret is taken for agnosceret,
quam belle vero ipse viderit.

10 Quid faciam? qvid mea aute^? quid faciet mihi? What shall I do, tush what
recke I^ what will he do unto me.

11 Bone vir Door, Salve, Honest man Door, God you save.

12 Satin' id tibi placet? Do thou like it very well?

13 Credin' te impune abiturum? Do thou think to escape unpunished?

13 Vnam hanc noxiam mitte si aliam vnquam vllam abmiser^, occidito, Pardon me
this one offense or trespass, and if I shall ever do so any more, slay me*
noxiam says Do. pro noxa, tryssillabum pro dyssil^abo. Albeit Valla denies
this word noxia, to be latin, saying (as I take him) that it is nowher found
contrary to other Gra^marians. And in deed Calepinus reads here noxa^ and not
noxiam, albeit noxia is in diverse places in Plaut. Erasm* and others.

15 Nunc meam saeuitiam veritus es? Did thou fear that I would be so
sharp, or cruel on thee.

16 Hunc metui ne me criminaretur tibi, I was afearde of this man least that
be would accuse me unto you. Criminari aliquem is to accuse any man, and to
lay any thing to his charge in open court, and crimen is not only the offense
and trespass it self, but also the crimination, or accusation for the same.
Valla li. 4. eleg. ca, 58.

20 Vix me contineo, quin inuolem in capillum, I can uneath retrayn my self
from flying upon him, to pull him by the hair.

21 Etiam vltro derisum aduenit, Besides all the other things, he comes for
the nones to laugh us to scorn?

22 Abi hinc insane, Get the hence mad fellow.

22 Quid ita vero abeam? Why should I get me hence I pray you*

23 Credin'isti quicquam fur^ifero? Do you give any credence to this
gallowclapper?

25 Missa haec faciamus, Let us pass all this.

25 Non te dignum Chaerea fecisti, Chere^ you have done otherwise then becommed
you.

26 Si ego dignus hac contumelia sum maxim, at tu indignus qui faceres tamen,
Although I be never so well worthy to be thus spitefully served yet you were no
meet man to do it.

28 Quid nunc consilij capiam nescio, I can not tell what counsel, or way now
to take.

29 Conturbasti mihi rations omnes, Thou have troubled all my reckeninges and
accomptes, or have troubled and disappoynted all that ever I reckened upon.
Conturbare rations, is the same that we say in english to bring one out of
his reckening, that is to say, to bring him out of his purpose, and to
disapoynt it.

33 Dehine spero aeternam inter nos gratiam fore. From henceforth I trust there
shall be perfect atonement and love between us for ever, or that we shall be
friends and lovers for ever.

34 Ex huiusmodi re quapiam. Of or by some semblable thing as this.

35 Saepe ex malo principio magna familiaritas conflata est. i. contracta,
comparata, conciliata. Often times of a lewd beginning has grown great
familiarity and friendship.

36 Quid si hoc aliquis voluit deus? what if this were the will of God, or, of
some good sayncts, or what if it was Gods will, that this should so be?

Equidem in eam partem accipio, and volo. Truly that way do I take it, and
would right gladly that it might so be.

38 Vnum hoc scito. Know and be sure of this one thing.

38 Scito contumeliae non me fecisse caussa, sed amoris. You shall wee^e or
understand, that I did it not for any despite or villainy toward you, but for
love.

40 Ignosco tibi. I forgive or pardon thee.

41 Non adeo inhumano ingenio sum. I am not of so ungentle a nature or fashion.

44 Tibi ab isto hera cauendum intelligo. I well perceive dame, that you had
need beware of this fellow.

45 Nihil tibi quid quam credo. I trust or believe thee near a whit.

46 Ego me tuae commendo, and committo fidei. I commit and put me wholly in
your honesty, goodness, or grace.

47 Ego te oro, in hac re mihi adiutrix sis. I beseech you to be my helper in
this matter.

Adiutrix is a Noune verbal of the feminine gendre, and therefore referred to
the feminine Sex, and Adiutor, to the Masculine, and referred to the man.

48 Te mihi patronum cupio. I would feign have you to defend, and to help me.

49 Emoriar, si non hanc vxorem du^^^^. I pray God I dye, if I do not mary her.

50 Volet* certo scio. He will be glad I know very well.

52 Iam frater hic aderit virginis. The brother of the maid will be here by
and by.

56 Domi operiamur potius quam hic ante ostiu^. Let us tarry for him within the
house rather then here before the door.

58 Hunc tu in aedeis cogitas recipere posthac? Do you ^^nde to let this
fellow ever come within your house again after this?

59 Creed hoc meae fidei. Believe this on my warrantise, as who should say,
trust me in this, for I speak, meaning good says without simulation, or
dissimulation, that ye may trust unto, and as ye shall be sure to find on
warrantise, for so it is taken here.

60 Dabit hie aliquam pugnam denuo This fellow will cause some debate or fray
again.

61 Parum perspexisse eius videre audaciam: You seem not to have well marked
nor considered the boldness of him.

64 Neque seruandum tibi quidquam dare ausim, neque te seruare. I dare neither
commit any thing to thee to keep, nor yet to take ye charge to see well to
thee. For ^erua^^ here is put for diligenter obseruare.

66 Obsecro, abeamus intro. I pray you let us go in.

67 Nolo me in via cu^ hac vest videat. I would not that he should see me in
the streate with this garment.

69 I prae, sequar. Go before, and I will come after. Or, I will follow.

70 ^u isthic mane vt Chremem introducas. Tarry you there, to bring Chremes into
the house.

In the third Scene.
1 Quid venire in mentem nunc possit mihi, qui referam illi gratiam? What might
I now devise where with to requite him? qui pro quo.

3 Move te ocius. Bestyrre the apace.

4 Mo^eo. I stir.

4 Video, sed nihil promoues. I see thee move and stir, but thou make no
way, or no haste. Video. ^* te mouere fed etc.

7 Been ^arras. Ye say well.

7 Illi faueo virgini. I favor, or love that maid well, or* I bear good
mind and favor to that maiden.

8 Iamdudu^ hera vos expectat domi My dame looks for you at home, ^ has d^n a
good while.

9 Parmenonem incedere vidio, vide vt ociosus sit. I see Parmeno come ^etting
like a lord, but see how id^e he is, as one out of all care and thought vt. i.
quomodo, vel qualiter* Incedo, di^ in^essi, dear, incessum, incessu, is
ambulare to walk, that is to go. But properly incedere differs from
Ambulare. For incedere properly to go with a stately pace, as who should say,
to show a great gravity or majesty in going as Princes do when they show
themselves in their estate, Senec. Tenero ac^molli passu suspendimus gradum nec
ambulamus sed incedimus We straight and prolong our going, with a nyce, or
tender and soft, delicate, or gingerly pace, and do not go as others do, but
^ett, or go like great estates. Of Incedo comes a verbal incessus, u^, ui,
which is used for any manner goinge, but most properly it is the pace that great
princes and noble men use, when they show their Estate or majesty. Vi^. Et vera
incessu pa^uit dea. And she showed her self by her pace to be a goddess. V^.
li. 5. c. 79. Ociosus. i. securus takes no thought nor care for nothing.

10 Si dijs placet, In ye name of God, or on Gods half. It is a prove the
never used in latin speking, but ironice, and in indignation. Read examples in
Hadrian de sermo lat. There is an other proverb. Si deus voluerit, if it shall
please God, used in serious matters of any thing to come, the end of which
depends or hangs in the favor of God. And it is taken out of the epistle
of saynct James, and recited in chil. Eras.

11 Spero me habere, qui hunc meo excrucie^ modo. I think I have found a way
to vex him, and to anger every vain in his heart, even as I will my self.
Habere. i. inuenisse, or scire, meo modo. i. vt volo.

13 Hunc perterrebo sacrilegum. I will make this wicked fellow thoroughly afeard.
Sacrilegum. i. impium, nefarium, scelerosum. Albeit, sacrilegus, properly is he
y^ steals hallowed things* and sacrilegium stealing of hallowed things.
Valla. li. 6. eleg. cap. 40.

In the fourth Scene.
1 Reuiso quidna^ hic rerum gerat, I com again to see what he is doing here.

2 Astu rem tractauit. He has handled y^ matter wisely. Astu i. astute, and is
here amaduerbe, but sometime it is the ablative of the Noune astu^ ^us, ^ui.
For it follows in the same comody An in astu venit

^ Dij vestram fidem, O good lord, it stands always in the place of an
interiection of meruayling, and not of calling on, admi^antis non in^ocantis.

6 Confeci sine molestia, si^e sumptu, si^e dispendio. I have brought it to an
end without any troubles or business, without any charge or expenses, and
without any loss or damage.

^ Id mihi puto palmarium. i. palma dignum, For that thing I think my self
worthy to be crowned. Palma, mae in latin is a tree, that was wont to be
given to such as had won any vitory.

For because that is always green, and (as Piutarchus says) of that
property, and Nature, that there can no weight nor burden oppress it, but
that it will arise under it, and stand up as it should do. Read Chili. Eras.
in the proverb Palmam far. Mihi is here da^iuu^ festiuitatis. i.
iucunditatis gratia adiunctus, of which Read in libello* de octo partium
constructione.

11 Cum cognorit, perpetuo oderit. After that he knows it, he will hate it
ever as long as he lives.

12 Foeminis, dum foris sunt, nihil videtur mundius, nec magis compositum
quidquam nec magis elegans, when Women are abroad out of their own houses,
nothing in the World seems to be more clean than they be^* nor nothing
more demure* nor more proper or feate.

14 Cum coenant, liguriunt When they eat, they feed* nicely or de^^tily, and
not but of the best. For ligurire, is formed (as says Denate) of the Grecke
word (...) which is in english sweet. Ligurite sometimes is auide and
helluose, that is greedely and ^au^ningly or gluttonously to devour very much.

15 Harum videre ingluuiem, sordes, inop^am, quam inhonestae solae sint domi,
atque ^ui^ae cibi, quo pacto ex ^iure hesterno panem atrum ^ore^^, nosse omnia
haec salus est adolescentulis. But to see the ravening or munching, the
sluttishenesse, and the penury of them, and how vncleauely and greedy on their
meat they be when they are alone by themselves at home in their own houses,
and how they will sla^re and sosse up brown Bread with gruell of the leaving
of ye other days before, al these things to know is the preservation of
Youth, to beware of them. Hesternus, na, number, is not always taken for the day
before this day, but is much used for pridianus, na, number, that is for ye day
before any other day. Cic. Videre videor alios intrantes, alios exeuntes,
quosdam ex vino vacillantes* quosdam hesterna e potatione o^citantes. Me
thinks I see some goinge in, some going forth, some reeling by reason of to
much drinking of wine, and some yeaning and gaping of the revel that they kept
the day before. And semblably cras and castinus is abused and spoken of the day
after any other day.

Virg. in Georg.

Si vero ad solemn rapidum, lunasque sequentes Ordine respicies, nunquam re
crastina fallet Hora, nec insidijs noctis capiere serenae.

19 Ego ^e pro istis dictis and factis vlciscar, vt ne impune in nos illuseris.
I will revenge or requite thee for those thy sayings and doings, that thou
shall not laughe us to scorn, and escape free thy self.

In the fifth Scene.
1 Proh facinus foedum. Oh, a shameful and abominable deed.

1 O infoelitem adolescentulum. O unfortunate young man.

2 O seelestum Parmenonem. O ungracious fellow Parmeno.

^ Quae futura esse exempla dicunt in eum indigna? How sore and how grievously
say they that he shall be punished, to the ensample of all others? Exempla
aedere, or, exempla facere in aliquem, is to punish any body openly to the
example of others. And exempla edi, or, exempla fieri in aliquem, is to be
punished openly, to the example of others: as if one be set upon the pillory*
or if a child for stealing or for any other heinous enormity be scourged naked
(...) (...) school, to the terror of his fellows, edu^tur, or, ^iunt in eum
exempla. So here in Terence anon after these words, Quae futura esse exempla
dicunt in eum indigna, Parmen^ says unto P^^hias, In quem exempla fient? Who
is that, that shall be punished to the ensample of all others?

4 O Jupiter, quae illic turba est? O Jupiter what great trouble, or what ado
is there?

7 Perdidisti istum adolescentulum. Thou hes^^ utterly undone, and cast away
this young man.

8 Studes dare verba nobis, Thou go about o^ thou art earnestly bent; or
thou art even set t^ deceive us.

10 Sci^ eum hinc ciuem esse, Thou know the he is of this city here.

10 Scisfratrem eius adprime nobilem. s. esse. Thou know that his Brother is
a (...) great gentleman.

^2 Ille vbi resciuit factum. He when he knew what was done.

^3 Colligauit eum, miseris modis, Hec bound him fast hand and foot, that
pity it was to see

^4 Atque equide^ orante* vt ne id faceret, Thaide. Yea, and that when Thais
desired and prayed him that he would not so do.

^5 Nunc minatur facturum se id, quod ego nunque vidi fieri, neque velim. s.
videre fie^i. Now he means and threatens to do such a thing unto him as I
never saw done to this day, nor would not see by my good will.

^6 Qua audacia tantum facinus audet? How dares he be so bold to do such a
pertious act.

^^ Ne hoc nesciatis, That you may not say, that you knew not so much asore, or
that you say not that you were ignorant of this

^0 Dico vobis nostrum, esse illum heril^m filium. I tell you he is our masters
son.

^1 Ne quam in illum Thais vim fieri sinat, Let not Thais suffer any vyolent
hands to be said on him.

^2 Cur non egomet intro eo? Why go not I in my self?

^2 Vide quid agas, ne illi prosis and tu pereas, Beware what thou do, and
that thou do not him pleasure and cast away thine own self.

^3 Putant quicquid est, ex te esse ortum. They think all that ever has been
done, to come first of thee.

24 Quid igitur faciam miser? quidue incipiam? What shall I then do unfortunate
man, or what shall first begin?

25 Video rure redeuntem senem, I have espied the old man coming out of the
country.

26 Dicam huic an non? Shall I tell him the matter or not?

26 Dicam herele etsi mihi magnum malum scio paratum, In faith I will tell him,
and yet I know that I shall surely have a great harm, or shrewd turn thereby.

27 Necesse est huic dicere vt subueniat, It is necessary to show this man of
the matter, to the end that he may do some help in it.

28 Tu istinarrato remomnem ordine, Show you all the matter to this man in
order.

In the Sixth Scene.
1 Ex meo propi^quo, rure hoc capi^o co^modi, neque agri neque vrbis odium me
vnquam percipit vbi satias coepit fieri, commuto locum.

Of my ground that I have without the city this commodity and pleasure I
have, that I am never through weary, neither of being in the country, nor of
the city. For when I begin to be weary of the one, or of the other, I change
places Odium. i. fastidium, vel tedium.

5 Satias. i. satietas, hoc est taedium ac fastidium. Quem praestolare hic ante
ostium? whom do thou tarry for here before the door?

6 Saluum te aduenire gaudeo, I am glad that you are come home in good health.

7 Perij lingua haeret metu. Alas that ever I was borne, my tongue is tied, nor
cannot speak for scare.

8 Quid est quod trepidas? What is the matter that thou art so feared^*

9 Here primum te arbitrari id quod res est, velim. Master first and foremost I
would have you think as the matter in deed is.

10 Quicquid huius factum est, culpa no^ factum est mea. What soever has been
done here, it was not done by my fault.

11 Recte sane interrogasti. You did well to ask.

11 Oportuit rem praenarrasse me, I ought to have showed you the matter first.

14 Quanti emi^? How bought he it, or how much paid he for it?

14 Viginti minis, He bought it for twenty pou^ds.

15 Here ne me spectes, Master look not on me, or sir, eye me not so.

17 Aliud ex alio malum, One mischief is in an others neck.

18 Me impulsore haec non facit, He does not such things as these by my
instigation, counsel, or setting on. Impulsore. i. authore consultore.

19 Omit de te dicere, speak no more of thy self.

20 Istuc quicquid est primum expedi first tell me this matter quickly what
soeue it is.

24 Audaciam meretricum specta. Se the boldness of hariots and strumpets.

24 Nunquid est aliud mali damniue quod non dexeris? Is there any other
mischiese or misfortune besides this, that thou have not yet told nor spoken of.

27 Non dubium est quin magnum mihi ex hac re sit malum. There is no doubt, but
that I shall have some displeasure by this thing.

In the seventh Scene.
1 Nunquam aedepol quid quam iam di^ quam magi^ vellem euenire, mihi euenit. In
good sooth there never happened unto me a great whyl^ any thing, that I would
more gladlye should happen

2 Intro ad nos venit, He came into our house.

3 Mihi ridiculo fuit, I laughed well at him.

3 Quid timeret sciebam, I knew what he feared

7 Defessus iam sum te ridendo. I am even weary with laughing at thee.

8 Nunquam aedepol stultitiorem hominem vidi, nec videbo, By my truth I never
saw a more foolish fellow, nor never shall.

9 Non possum satis narrare quos ludos praebueris intus. I cannot well express,
what sport and laughing, we have had at thee within.

11 Illicone credere ea, quae dixi, oportuit te? Must thou needs have believed
that, that I said by and by even at the first?

12 An paenitebat flagitij? Did thou take remorse or repentance of thy great
offense? flagitium is properly ^celus ^lagris dignum an heinous offense, worthy
to have sharp correction and punishment. Valla lib. 4 eleg. cap. 57.

14 Quid illi credis animi tum fuisse; vbi vestem vidit illam esse eum indutum
pater? where was his heart trowest thou, when his father saw him in that
apparel? we may say induor vesie or vestem, for induo is one of the verbs
that govern a double accusative after them, and of all such verbes their
passiues require the later accusative of both, As, I teach the Gammer. Ego
doceo te grammaticam. By the passive, thou art taught Grammar. Tu doceris
grammaticam.

17 Itane lepidu^ tibi visum est nos irridere? Did thou think it such a
pretty sport to mock us?

18 Si quidem is it huc impune habueris, If thou escape quite for this same.

18 Reddam hercle. s. vices, I will pay thee again, or, I will serve thee as
well, or, I will requite thee, or, I will be even with thee in farth.

21 Vterque in te exempla aedent, Both they will punish thee, to the example
of all other, Or, that all others shall take example by thee.

22 Nullus sum, I am undone as who should say, I were as good be dead, and
out of this world.

22 Hic pro illo munere tibi honos est habitus, This honesty, and this
promotion have you gotten by that benefit or pleasure doing. Egomet meo indicio
miser, quasi sorex hodie perij, I am cast away and betrayed this day by mine
own words, like as the rattes by their loud squeaking betray them selves,
showing where they be. Suo ipsius indicio perijt sorex, The ratte betrayed her
self with her own noise, and so was it taken, as a prouerbiall speaking of
any, that are betrayed by their own words. And as Donate thinks, the use of
the metaphore was taken of this, that the property of the rattes is to make a
louder squeaking then do the Myce. See Chil. Eras.

In the eight Scene.
1 Qua spe, aut quo consilio huc imus? In hope of what, or in what intent come
we hither?

1 Quid coeptas Thraso? what inte^d you, or what begin you to do Thraso?

2 Thaidi me dedam, et facia^ quod iubeat, I will yield my self unto That's,
and will do what she shall command me.

3 Qui minus, quam Hercules seruiuit Omphale? Why not, as well as Hercules did
service unto Omphale? Omphale, was a maiden and Queen of the country of Lidia,
whom Hercules did love, and to win her favor did at her commandment sley a
great Serpent about the floude of Sagarie, and then after served ye same
Omphale, as her woman servant, and as if he had been her bond maiden: In so
much as she compelled him to pick wolle, and to spinne and card, whereas her
self used to shoot, and to bear a Mace in her hand, to wear upon her, the
hea^ of a Lion (as if she had been a dalieunt knight and refused to go in
apparel, meet and convenient for her sex.

3 Exemplum placet, I like that Example or comparison well.

4 Vtinam tibi co^mitigari videam sandalio caput, Would God I might see thy
pate tamed and made sober with a slipper: alluding to the fable of Omphale
aforegoinge by whom Hercules was after semblable sort abused.

5 Quid hoe est mali? What misfortune is here be tallen?

6 H^^^ ego nunquam videram, This man had I never seen before.

6 Quidnam properans prosilit? Wherefore comes he forth so fast, skippinge
and leapinge.

In the nynth Scene.
1 Ecquis me viuit hodie fortunatior? Is there any man lyuinge this day more
fortunate or more happy than I am? This particle ec. has a very great grace in
asking a Question, when it is compound with Quis, que, quod vel quid. Cic.
Atti. Ecquis vnquam tam ex amplo statu, tam in bona caussa, tantis facul^at^bus
ingenij, consilij, gratiae, tantis presidijs bonorum omnium, condicit? Was
there ever any man suppressed or undone, being of so high degree having so
good and rightful a cause, having so high a gift and indument of wit,
polli^y, and grace, to have the favor of men, and having so great assistance
and aid of a^ good and honest men? And sometime it is used infinitely with
semblable and no less grace or elegancy. Cic. Atti. Quod quaeris, ecqua spes
pacification is si^ quantum ex Pompeij multo and accurato sermo ne perspexi, ne
voluntas quide^ est, as touching that you desire to know, whether there be any
hope of atonement and peace to be made between Caesar and Pompeius, as far
as I have well perceived, by much and very curious or precise communication
with Pompeius, there is no such mind, ne will neither.

2 Nemo hercle quisquam, In faith no man in the world. Of nemo elegantly
joined with quisquam, it is noted in Hadriane, de sermon. latt.

2 In me plane dij. potestatem suam omnem ^stendere. In me the Gods have
plainly showed all their whole power, and how much they are able to do.

4 O mearum voluptatum omnium inuentor, inceptor, perfector. O thou that have
been the deviser and finder out, the beginner, and also the finisher of all my
pleasures.

5 Scis in quibus sim gaudijs? Do thou know in what great joys I am?

6 Scis Pamphilam meam inuentam ciuem? Do thou know that my best beloved
Pamphila is found to be free borne of this City?

6 Scis Pamphilam meam sponsam mihi. Do thou know, that my beloved Pa^phila
is promised and made sure to me, to mary with me?

7 Audin' tu illum? Do thou hear him?

8 Meo fratri gaudeo amorem esse omnem in tra^quillo. I am right glad and
joyous that my brothers love is quiet, and out of trouble.

9 In clientelam and fidem nobis dedit se He is become our client, and has put
him self wholly in our hands.

11 Hoc aliud est, quod gaudeamus. This is an other thing, of which we may be
glad, quod, id est, propter quod, eclipsis praepositionis.

11 Miles pellitur for as. The soldier is clean expulsed, or put out of
doors, or banished the house.

12 Frater vbi vbi est, fac. quam primum haec audiat. Help that my Brother may
hear of all this at once, wheresoever he be Vbi vbi. i. vbicunque. For all
voices that are relatiues may sometimes be interrogatiues, as when they ask a
question, and sometimes they be neither relatiues nor interrogatiues, but are
put and taken infinitely, and then if they be doubled, that is to say,
compounded with themselves they stgnifle as much as if they were compo^ded with
this particle, cunque as, quisquis. i. quicunque, qualisqualis. i.
qualiscunque, quoquo. i. quocun que, quantusquantus. i. quantuscunque, vbivbi.
i. vbicunque, and so of all others, Quamprimum. i. valde cito, primo quoque
tempore, as soon as may be. For quam, in comparison signifies valde, and
therefore is joined with the superlatiue degree. And note, that there is a
great difference between quamprimum, and cumprimum for cumprimum, vtprimum, vbi
primum, simul primum, simulac and simulatque, are of one signification, in
english, as soon as: and quamprimum, by and by, as in example. As soon as my
brother shall be come again, do me to weete, or advertise me by and by,
either by word of mouth, or else by letters.

Cum primum, or, vt primum. etc. Frater reuersus erit, vel nu^cio, vel per
literas facito me certiorem.

13 Nu^quid dubitas, quin ego perpetuo perierim? Do thou any thing doubt, or
do thou not think verily, that I am utterly undone for ever?

14 Sine dubio opinor. Without doubt I suppose so.

14 Quid commemorem primum? What should I speak of first.

14 Quem laudem maxim? Whom may I most commend or praise?

15 Dedit mihi consilium, vt facerem, He gave counsel to do it.

18 O Jupiter, serua obsecro haec nobis bona, Oh Jupiter keep and continue us
in this good fortune, felicity; or prosperity, I beseech thee.

20 Incredibilia modo narrauit, He told wonders while ere, or things
incredible, or things that no man may almost believe.

20 Vbi est frater? Where is my brother?

20 Praesto adest. He is even here already.

21 Satis credo. I believe well, or I think well.

21 Nihil est Thaide dignius quod ametur. There is nothing more worthy to be
beloved than is Thais.

22 Nostrae est omni fautor familiae. He favors or loves all our house well.

23 Quanto minus spei est, tan to magis amo, The less hope there is, the more
am I in love.

24 Perfice hoc precibus, precio, vt haeream in part alqua apud Tha^de^, Bring
this to pass with prayer, or with money, that I may be an hanger on in one
part or other, with Tha^s.

26 Difficile est, It is hard.

26 Si quid collibuit, noui te. If thou be well disposed to a thing, I know
thee well eno^ghe what thou can do.

26 Hoc si effeceris, quoduis donum, and praemium a me optato, id optatum
feres, If thou may bring this to pass, wyshe or desire of me, what so ever
gift or reward thou will, and thou shall have thy desire. Donum est, quod
gratis datur, praemium quod pro meritis confertur.

28 Postulo, vt mihi tua domus, te present, te absente pateat semper. I
require that your house may be open for me at all times, whether thou be in the
way, or out of the way.

30 Do fidem ita futurum. I promise thee faithfully, that it shall so be.

30 Quem hic ego audio? Who is that, that I hear speak here?

31 Tu fortasse, quae facta hic sunt, nescis. Thou do not know peradventure
what things have been done, or have happened here.

32 Cur in his te conspicor regionibus? Why do I see thee in these parts, or
in these quarters?

33 Edico tibi. I tell thee openly. Edico, edicis, edixi, edicere, edictu^, is
properly to proclaim, and pertains only to princes, officers, and rulers,
and thereof hoc edictum edicti, edicto, is the commandment given or
proclaimed by any prince, ruler, or officer. But here edico, is taken for
clare dico, and clare proloquor To speak or pronounce out aloude without any
fear or dissimulation. For e. and ex. in composition have much that
signification, as eruo, is to get or to mine a thing out of the earth, or any
other place, where it is hard to come by. Egero is to cast out, efferro, is to
bring out, expello, is to thrust out, Eloquor is to speak out aloude, and so
edico here is to speak out aloude. And in the same signification did Terence
use edico before in the fifth Scene of this fifth act, in this some comody, in
the person of Parmeno, saying thus unto Pythias. Dico, edico vobis, nostrum
esse illum herilem filium. I tell you, yea, and I tell you plainly and boldly,
that he is my masters son. As who should say, I am not afearde to tell it
you, but would that you should well know it, and warn you that you do him
no harm.

34 Si in platea hac te offen dero post vnquam, nihil est quod dicas mihi,
alium quaerebam, ite^ hac habui, peristi. If it shall be my chance to find thee
in this streate at any time after this day, it shall nothing avail thee to say
unto me, I sought for another man, or my journey lay this way, for thou art
but a dead man.

35 Eia haud sic decet. What soft, that is not seeming, or, it should not be
for your honesty so to do. Eia is an aduerbe of correcting.

35 Non cognosco vestrum tam superbum.s. ingenium vel genus, vel animum, vel
morem, vel institutum. I am not acquaynted with this proud and disdaynefull
fashion of you, or, I can no skill of this your etc. Albeit Donate takes these
words. Vestrum tam superbum to be put absolutely, that is substantiuely, as
Vestrum tam superbum.i. vestram tantam superbiam. Donate brings in for his
authority, a like manner of speaking out of Andria in the sixth Scene of the
fourth act. Pol. Crito antiquu^ obtines. Of which it is there sufficiently
noted.

37 Prius audite paucis, quod cum dixero, si placuerit facitote. First hear in
2. or 3. words, and when I shall have said, if it shall like you, do it.

38 Tu concede paululum isthuc Thraso. Thraso go you and stand a little
further that way.

39 Ego vos credere hoc mihi vehementer velim, I would y^ you in any wise
believe me in this.

41 Si vobis prodest, vos non facere inscitia est. If it be for your profit,
it is a foolishnes for you, not to do it.

47 Magis oportunus, nec magis ex vsu tuo nemo est. There is no man more meet
for it, nor no man more to your commodity. Oportunus.i. Idoneus, meet for the
purpose. Here note that three negations do no more to the Sense, nor have no
more signification nor strength, then two, as Nunquam mihi nec obfuisti, nec
profuisti. Thou never did me neither harm ne good. Cic. in tusc. quaesti.
Nescierunt nec vbi, nec qualia essent, They knew not neither where nor what
things they were. Ibid. Nihil nec disputare, nec scribere praetermisi. I
omitted nothing, neither to dispute and reason nor to write. Note also that two
or three negations do sometimes deny with more vehemence. Pl. li. 18. cap. 4.
Oculorum vitia fieri negant, nec lippire eos qui cum pedes lauant, aqua inde
ter oculos tangant. It is a saying that they shall never have Diseases in
their eyes, nor shall not be bleare eyed, which when they wash their feet,
touch their eyes thryse with the same water. Examples be innumerable, and
Budaeus has noted the same largely and copiously in his Annotations upon the
Pandects of the Civil law.

48 Et habet quod det, and dat nemo largius. He both has enough to geeue and
does geeue, no man more liberally.

49 Fatuus est, insulsus, tardus. He is a natural fool without any wisdom
or good fashion, nor has any quickness or lustiness or ac^^^^ty or spirit
in him. Fatuus (says Donate) inepta loquens, speaking foolish words For
fatuus (says he) is said and deryued a fando, of speaking. And thereof fauni,
that is to say the rusticall Gods of the woods, which are called in greek
(...), were called in la^^n fatui. i. (as Serutus upon Uirgil, and Donate in
this place expounds it) multum fantes, hoc est multum loquentes, a fando and
vaticinando. So that after Donate, farui be they, that are foolish in their
words and sayings. Insulsi, are foolish in the heart, mind, and
intelligence, and after him they err and be deceived, that think that fatuus
is animo and cord, and insulsus, in verbis and dictis. But Lau. Val. li. 4.
eleg. c. 13. says in this wise. He is called in latin stultus. y^ lacks the
experience of things, and knowledge of the world, and has no foresight in
things to come, so y^ many being no unwise me^ otherwise, yet may at so^time
happily do stulte, y^ is foolishly* or more properly to say unadvisedly. Fatuus
is he y^ is a very fool, and has no wisdom at all, and it is by translation
taken of the sauerynges of meats, for when meats be all wearyshe and
unsavory, they be called in latin fatui cibi. And semblably, a man that has
no wisdom is called in latin fataus. Martial. lib. 12.

Vt sapiant fatuae fabrorum prandia betae*

O quam saepe Pete^ vina piperque coquus?

Oh, how often will the Cook ask and require wine and peper for to make the
wearish Beetes (that smythes, and carpenters dyne withal) to be somewhat
sauery? And this seems to be a better reason for this vocable fatuus, then
the other, which certain writers do approve and allow, that is to say, that
they are called in latin fatui, which being taken with a certain ^urys or
madness (such as Fatua the wife of king Faunus was much taken withal) do
prophecy things to come, like as she the said Fatua did. Stolidus, is be that
is folishe, and draws much nighe unto the nature and perceiving, or
understanding of sheep or other foolish brute beasts. Hactenus Valla.
Insulsus, is he that has no wisdom, nor wit, nor no grace, nor good
fashion, neither in words, nor gesture, nor otherwise in his behavior. What
sal and sales signify, it is largely showed and declared in the third Scene
of the second act of this same comody. Of sal comes salsitudo, or salsedo:
of salsitudo, or salsedo, is formed salsus, a, um, a thing that is salt, and
by translation, wittye, sharp, pleasant, and also biting in words and
otherwise. Contrary unto Salsus is insalsus, a, um, without any wittiness, or
pleasant fashion, and consequently very foolish and such as no man may have
any pleasure in.

49 Stertit noctesque and dies. He lies routing and suorting all day and all
night.

50 Facile pellas vbi velis. You may easily thrust him out of doors when you
list.

51 Hoc ego vel primum puto. This do I think even prineipall and chief of
all. Vel. i. etiam.

52 Accipit hominem nemo melius prorsus, neque prolixus. He entertayneth a
man, no man in the World better, nor more sumptuously, Melius, id est, latius.
More daintily. For it is referred to the provision and deintynesse of cates.
And Prolixius. i. largius copiosius, more aboundauntly and plenteously, for it
is referred to the abundaunce and plenty of all such things as are provided.

54 Vos oro, vt me in gregem vestrum recipiatis. I desire and pray you to
receive me into your flock, as who should say, that I may be admitted into
your company, as one of you.

See Chil. Eras. in the Proverb. De grege illo est.

55 Satis diu hoc iam saxum voluo, I have labored about this long enough now,
if that be good. It is a prouerbial speaking, alluding unto the fable of
Sisyphus, which (as the Poets feign) was son unto Eolus, and a great thief
in I^^hmo, he used when any strangers arrived there, to slay them with stones,
and to tumble them down into the water from the tops of ye rocks, at last he
was slain by one Theseus, and when he came to Hell, this punishment was given
unto him, that he should bear up a great stone unto the top of an hill, and as
often as it rolled down, to fetch it up again, but he could never cause it to
lie, but y^ it rolled down to the hills foot again immediately, after that
he had brought it to ye top, and so his labor is infinite, and of this fable,
such as have great, and the same endless pains without any fruit or profit,
are prouerbially said in latin. Saxum voluere, to tumble, or to roll the
stone. Read Eras. in Chil.

59 Isti te ignorabant. These men did not know thee.

59 Postquam eis mores ostendi tuos, and collaudaui secundum facta, and
virtutes tuas, impetraui. As soon as I had informed them of your co^dicions,
and had praised you, according to your acts and virtues, or good qualities, I
obtained.

61 Gratiam habeo maximam. I thank you with all my heart. Habere gratiam, is
properly in the heart, when we bear well in mind and remember such benefits
as we have had or received, and have good mind and will to do semblable
benefits again, in recompense of them. read Lau. Val. li. 5. eleg. cap. 41.

62 Nunquam fui vsquam quin me omnes amarent plurimum. I was never yet in any
place, but that every body loved me very well.

63 Dixin^ ego vobis in hoc esse atticam eloquentiam? Did not I tell you, that
you should find in this man the most pure and high eloquence that is? Attica,
cae, or At, tes, is a region or country in Grecia, situate and lying between
Achaia, and Macedonia, in which country or region stood the City of Athens,
where was spoken the most pure and clean, and most eloquent Greek, like as in
London is spoken the best and most pure and true English, and in Paris the
best French. etc. And by reason thereof Attica eloquentia, is used for the most
pure, true and polite eloquence, and that eloquence, which the best and most
cunning orators used: which best and chief Oratoures for the same cause were
called in latin Attici, as who should say, most Eloquent, as coming most nygh
unto the pure eloquence of the Attiques. Albeit, here in this place it is
spoken ironice, much like as if Gnato should have said by Thraso, in English:
did not I tell you, that this gentilman rolleth in his Rhethorique, as Apes do
in tails? For he said a little before, that Thraso was fatuus, insulsus, and
tardus.

64 Nihil praetermissum. s. est, There has nothing been omitted or let pass.

64 Ite hac omnes vos. Go you all this way here.

Finis Eunuchi.
EX HEAVTONTIMORVMENO. In the Prologue.
1 NECVI sit vestrum mirum. Maruayle none of you.

2 Id primum dicam, deinde, quod veni eloquar. I will first tell that, and
afterward I will show and declare the cause of my hither coming: quod, id
est, propter quod, or cuius causa, cuius gratia.

3 Ni partem maximam existimarem scire vestru^, id dicerem. I would tell it if
I thought that the most part of you knew it not well enough already.

10 Nunc quamobrem has parts didicerim, paucis dabo. Now will I show you in
two or three words, for what cause I have learned to play this part.

16 Rumores distulerunt maleuoli. I ^willers, or maligners have spread abroad
naughty tales. Differo, differs, distuli, dilatum, has many significations, to
differ, to prolonge, or to delay. Luca: Nocuit differ paratis, it has done
harm unto many folks, after that they have been ready to make longer delay.
Sometime to endure as Plin. in epist. did put differ fitim, to endure
thyrste, as who should say, to forbear to drink, though one were thirs^y,
sometimes differ is to trouble a man, and with some sudden fear to bring
him to his wits end, that he know not what first, or best to do. Plaut. in
Pseu. iam ego te differam dictis meis impudice. I will rattle, or shake thee up
ere I go, that thou shall not wot what to do. shameless fellow that thou art.
Idem in Cistel.

Miser exanimor, feror, differor, distrahor, diripior, it a nullam mentem animi
habeo. I miserable body am almost dead. I go like a man, I wot not whither, I
am in such grief, that me thinks I am pulled in pieces, I am haled in sonder,
and am torn in pieces, I have so lost all the reason and wit that was in my
head So Terence before in Andria, Orationem sperat inuenisse se, qua differat
te, pro in tu face vt apud te sies He hops that he has now found a tale
against thee, wherewith to bring thee at thy wits end, therefore see thou that
thy wits be thine own. And in this signification differor is much used among
the Latin authors, as differor amore vel cupiditate, I am in extreme pains
for love and desire Differor dolo^ibus, I am in such extreme pains, that I
think my self to be torn in pieces, and may no longer endure for pain.

Differor laetitia* I am ravished with ioyfulnesse. Somtymes differo is to sow
or ^o spread abroad in diverse places, as, differ alicui famam* is to spread
abroad a man's name in diverse places. And Differ rumorem de aliquo is to sow
or bring up and to sprede abroad in diverse places a brute, or a noise, or tale
of, or by any body, as in this place of Terence, some times differ is to be
unlike, or to be differinge from an other thing. Rumor, o^is, or Fama mae, is
a fame, a brute, or a noise* brought up of any new thing, the author, or
bri^ger up thereof being unknown, and whether the same bruit or fame be good or
ill. What rumor and fama signify, and of the use of the^, see in Laur. Valla.
lib. 4. eleg. cap. 10.

18 Factum hic esse id non negat, and se deinde facturum autumat. He here says
not the contrary, but that it was so done, and he thinks to do the same
again hereafter,

20 Habet bonorum exemplum, quo exemplo sibi licere facere, quod illi fecerint
putat, He has to lay for him the example of good and honest persons, by
which example he thinks and reckneth, that he may laufully do the same,
that they have done before him, Exemplum is the thing that we follow or
eschew, and examplar is the thing in which Exemplum is contained as here in
this place of Terence, Exemplum is in bonis, and ipsi boni be Examplar, or,
exemplaria. And semblably the eloquence of Cicero is Exemplum for us to
follow, and Cicero him self is Exemplar, in which Exemplum of eloquence is
contained and semblably of all other things, as Lau. Vel. has copiously and
cunningly annoted. li, 6. eleg. cap. 33.

26 Omnes vos oratos volo, I would desire you all.

30 Ne ille pro se dictum existimet. Think he not that to be spoken in his
favor.

31 Fecit seruo currenti in via, He did it unto the serunt as he ran by the
street.

32 Cur insano seruiat? Why should he do service unto a mad man.

34 Finem maledictis facit, He leaves railing.

35 Ad este aequo animo. Stand still quetly and patiently.

35 Datem potestatem mihi. Give me license

40 Clamore ^ummo, and labor maximo, With very high, or ^onde crying out, or
hallowinge, ^ with very great labor.

41 Causam hanc iustam esse animam inducite Persuade your selves, and think in
your minds, that this cause or matter is good, just, and rightful.

42 Vt aliqua pars laboris minuatur mihi, that some part of my labor may be cut
of, or that I may have some what the less labor and pain.

44 Ad me cu^^itur. Every body comes running to me.

46 Experimini in vtamque partem ingeni^ quid possit meum* Assay and prove ye
what my wit is able to do in, or for both parts.

48 Nunquam auare pretium statuti art meae. I never set too high a price on my
crafts: or I was never covetous setting price on my craft.

49 Eum esse quaestum in animum induxi maximum quam maxim inseruire vestris
commodis, I have always been content to think and to reckon my most winning
gaynes, and profit^ to be, to do al diligent service that I can ^or your
profit.

51 Exemplum statui^e in me, vt adolescentuli vobis placere studeant. Show an
example upon me, that other young men may be desyrons and may labor to be in
favor with you, or to get your favor.

Out of the first act in the first scene.
1 Inter nos nuper admodum notitia est. It is a very little while agone, since we
have been acquainted together.

2 Agrum in proximo hic mercatus es, you have bough^ a plotte of ground, here
near beside me.

3 Nec rei amplius quidqua^ fuit. s. inter nos. And there has been none other
thing at all between us.

4 Vel virtus tua me vicinitas, quod ego in propinqua part amicitiae puto,
facit, vt te audacter moneam, and familiariter, Both your virtue, goodness, or
honesty, and also that we are neighbors, and dwell nigh together (which
thing I reckon as one of the chief parts and greattest causes of entire
amitye and friendship) causes me to speak unto you, and show you my mind
boldly and familiarly like a friend. Monere, or admonere is to tell a man of
his fault with a certain correction, rebukinge, or chyding.

7 Mihi videre praeter ae tatem tuam facere and ptaeterquam res te adhortatur
tua: Me thinks you you do otherwise than is convenient for your age and
otherwise than is requisite for a man of your substance.

10 Annos sexaginta natus est, aut plus eo, vt conijcio. You are three score
years old, or above as I suppose of amplius elegantly and indifferently joined
with the nominative, accusative, or ablative, see in Hadrian de sermon. latino.

11 Agrum in his regionibus meliorem neque praetii maioris, nemo habet, No man
in all these parts has a better plot of ground, nor better land or more worth.

15 Nunquam tam mane egredior, neque tam vesperi domum reuertor, quin te in
fundo co^spicer fodere, aut arare, aut aliquid facere, I never go ^orth so
early in the morning, nor come home again so late in the evening, but that I
see thee abroad in thy ground, either digging, or plowing, or else some other
work doing.

18 Nullum remittis tempus, neque te respicis, you are no time unoccupied, nor
pass any thing on your self, or set any store by your self.

19 Haec non voluptati tibi esse satis certo scio, That these things are no
pleasure unto you I am well assured.

20 At enim dices? But peradventure you will say unto me. Enim here is no
conjunction causall, but an expletyue,

20 Me quantum hic operis fiat poenitet, Me th^keth all the work that is done
here to little. Me poenitet, i. mihi parum videtur. For poenitere is to be
sorry, to repent, or to forthink, and because they that are sorry thet their
matters or business goes not well forward, think all that is done to lille.
Therefore poenitere is sometimes elegantly taken for parum videri, to seem
little. Verg, in bucol. egl. li. 2. Nee te poeniteat calamo triuiss^ labellum,
and think it not a small thing to have learned to play on the pipe or the
recorder Cicero in praefatione libri primi officiorum Quamobrem disces tu
quide^ a principe huius aetatis Philosophorum: and disces quamdiu voles: tam
diu aute^ velle debebis, quoad te quantum proficias non poenitebit Wherefore
thou shall learn and be scholar unto Cra tippus the best and chief of all
Philosophers that are at this day, as long as thou shall be willing thy self,
and so long thou ought to be willing as thou shall not think thy self to
do little good, and to leese thy time, but to profit. So Terence before in
Eunucho act. 5 scen. 7. An poenitebat flagiti^, te authore, quod fecisset ado
lescens, ni miserum insuper etiam patri indicares? Did thou not think that
great offense, which the young man had done by thy counsel, and setting
on to be enough, but that thou must moreover also be the first y^ should
betray and appeache the poor soul unto his father?

21 Quod in opere faciundo operae consumis tuae si sumas in seruis exercendis,
plus agas. If you would bestow that labor in exercising your seruaunes, and
setting them to work, and seeing them occupied, which you spend in working or
laboring your own body, you should do more good, or you should have more
good done or you should have more profit by it, or you would more prevail.

23 Tantum ne est ab re tua otij tibi aliena, vt cures, eaque quae nihil ad te
attine^t? Have thou so much leisure and void time from thine own business
that thou may meddle in other men's matters, in such things as appertain
nothing unto thee, nor nothing touch nor concern thee?

25 Homo sum humani a me nihil alienum puto, I am a man as other men be, and
think every thing that appertains to any man, to appartayne also to me, or
to concern, or touch me too.

28 Tibi opus vt est facto, face pro fac, Do thou as is expedient for thee to
do.

29 An cuiqua^ est vsus homini se vt cruciet? Is it expedient for any man to
punish his own body, and to put himself to ^o much pain, and torment.

32 Ne lachruma, weep not, Ne. when it is an aduerbe of forbydding, may be
indifferentlye joined with a verb of the subiunctiue mode, or else of the
imparatiue. But, non, may never be joined with the imparatiue and with all
other modes it may, as Linacre has noted.

32 Istuc quicquid est, fac vt sciam, Let me know the matter what so ever it be.

33 Ne retice, Hyde it not, or keep it not in, Donatus has noted that
reticere, is to keep in. and not to utter such things as we are sorye and
take thought for Obticere, is to keep in such things as we are ashamed of.
Terentius in Eunucho. Virgo conscissa vest lachrumans, obticet* The maiden
having her gown all to cut weepeth, and will speak never a word, Tacere is to
keep secret, things of counsel, as before in Eunucho.

Potin' est hic tacere? Can this fellow conceal any secrets? or keep any
counsel?

33 Ne verere, be not afraid.

34 Te aut consolando, aut consilio, vt re iuuero, I will surely help you,
either by giving you words of comfortr, or else with geuinge you some good
counsel, or else in very deed.

35 Hac quidem causa qua dixi tibi. I^^ faith even for the same cause that I
have told you.

36 Istos rastros interea depone, ne labora. Lay down thy rake in the mean
season, and labor or work not.

37 Quam rem agis? What do you? or what entende your or what go you about?

38 Sine me vacuum tempus ne quoddem mihi laboris, let me alone that I may not
suffer my self to let any time pass void of labor. It be said vacuum
laboris for vacuum labor, or vacuum a labor.

^^ Non aequum facis, You do not well or honestly as you should do.

40 Sic meritus est meum, So have I deserved, or such is my desert.

41 Filiu^ vnum adolesce^tulum habeo, I have but one son in the world and he
is a young strypling.

43 Nunc habeam necne, incertum est. s. mihi. I am in doubt whether I have one
now or not.

43 Quid ita isthuc? s. dicis? or incertum tibi est? Why say thou that.

44 Est e Cotintho hic aduena anus paupercula. There is here a poor old woman
a stranger that came out of Corinth hither.

45 Eius filiam illa amare coepit perdite. Her daughter he began to love so
vnthriftelye, that he had almost cast away, and undone himself.

46 Prope iam, vt pro vxore haberet. So that he used her in manner as his will,
that is openly without being ashamed.

46 Haec clam me omnia. s. fecit. All this he did unknown to me.

47 Vbi rem resciui. After that I had knowledge of the matter. Rescio, rescis,
resciui, rescitum, and a verb frequentatiue of the same. Rescisco, resciscis.
resciui, resciscere, rescitum, After Aulus gellius, is to have some priuye
knowledge (and we say) an inkling of any thing done priuelye, or otherwise
dissembled and kept from our knowledge. But Valla checketh and reproves the
said Aulus Gellius, for that saying, and shows that Rescisco is a plain
verb and is properly to have knowledge of a thing after that it is done, of
which thing thou were unknowing when it was done, specially if it appertain to
thee or to any other of thine.

50 Tibi ne haec licere speras facere, me viuo? do^^ thou think that thou
shall be suffered to do such things as this, while I am alive?

53 Erras si id credis and me ignoras Clinia. Clinis thou art deceived, if thou
so think and know me not.

54 Ego te meum esse dici ta^tisper volo, du^ quod te dignum est facies. I will
thou be cauled mine so long as thou shall do as becomes thee and no longer.
For that is the use of tantisper joined with dum taken for quam diu, as shows
Val. lib ^. eleg. cap. 48.

55 Si quod te (...) ^um est, non facis, ego quod me in te ^it fac^^o^^^g number
inuenero, If thou do^ not as becomes thee to do, I shall find the means to
do by thee, as shall become me.

57 Nulla adeo re isthuc fir nisi ex nimio otio Sure this comes of none other
thing but of to much ease and ydlenes. Adeo. i. certe. profecto

58 Ego istuc aetatis non amori operam dabam. I when I was of ye age that thou
art did not bestow nor set my mind on wanton love: the latin authors use with
great grace and much elegancy. Id temporis, per id tempus, id aetatis, hoc
aetatis, isthuc etatis, quid aetatis, absolutely whereof read in Hadrian de
sermon. lat.

59 In Asiam hinc abi^ propter pauperiem, I was ^ayne to goeout of these parts
into the country of Asia for poverty.

61 Adolescentulus saepe eade^ and grauiter audie^do victus est, the young man
with often and sore hearing one thing was even done, or was greatly dismayed.

63 Putauit me aetate plus scire. He thought that I knew more, by reason that I
was older, or he thought that I could better skill in things, or was better
seen in experience of the world, because that I had mo years.

64 Putauit me beueuolentia plus prouidere que^ se ipsum sibi. He thought y^ I
would provide for him, or foresee what was most expedient for his profit*
better than he could for him self, for the entire and hearty love that I bare
him.

65 In Asiam ad regem militatu^ abijt. He is gone hence into the country of
Asia unto y^ king there to be a soldier, and to go on warfare.

66 Clam me profectus, menses tres abest, he went away and took his journey
unknowing to me, and has been away now a whole quarter of a year. In words
betokening space of time, the use of the accusative signifies continuance of
time without intermission, or ceasing, secundu^ Seruium. Albeit we may use also
the ablative.

67 Ambo accusand^s, estis. ye are both to blame.

67 Illud incoeptum animi est pudentis signum* That beginning is a sign or
token of a shame^ast heart, or of an honest heart.

67 Vbi comperi ex ijs, qui ei fuere conscij. Wha^ I knew of it by them that
were privy to it, and of his counsel.

70 Domum reuertor moestus. Home I come again all sad.

70 Domum reuertor animo fere perturbato, atque incet to prae aegritudine, I
come Home agan in manner out of my mind, or distraught and uncertain what to
do for thought. Cie. in tuse. quest: shows that aegritudo, properly is in the
mind, and aegrotacio in the body, and that animus est aeger corpus aegrotum.
A^heyt, those words are much confounded, that is to say, the one used for the
other, as well in the said Ciceto and in Quintilian, Terence, and others.

72 Accurrunt serui, soccos detrahunt, My servants came running to me, and
pulled of my pinsons* or stertuppes. Soccus, Socci, Socco, was a kind of
shoes, and it is fourmed of so^tus, socci, a bag, and had the name thereof,
because that when it was fastened upon the foot, it bagged and lay full of
pleates. And they were used in wearing both of men and women, but most among
the nobles and rich falkes,

73 Video alios festinare, lectos sternere, caenam apparare, I see some others
make have to lay the table, and to make rea^ for supper. Lectus lecti is a bed,
Festus pompeius deryueth lectom ab alliciendo, that when the body is weary it
desires rest, and some deryue lectu^ of the greek word lectron, albeit lectus
(vt inquit Varro) dictus est, quod lectis herbis and frondibus strame^ta
facerent. Lectus is so called (says Varro) because that in old time they used
to gather grass and leaves, or boughs, and so to straw them on the ground,
and then to lie down on them. And because they v^ed much to cate in the same
place (for then they had not found out the use of meat tables) therefore lectus
was also taken for mensa, and is much used in that signification in Plaut.
Terence, and all Poets, and other writers, that be of any antiquity. Horat.
Saepe tribus lectis, videas coenare quaternos. A man shall ^te often three tables
at once, and at every table 4 persons at supper, or eating meat.

74 Pro se quisque sedulo faciebat, quo illam mihi lenirent miseriam. They were
every body for his part, as busye as they could be, to case me of the care
that I was in.

^^ Vbi video haec caepi cogitare, when I saw all this, I began to cast and
think in my mind.

^^ Tot mea solius soliciti sunt causa, vt me vnum expleant? Are so many
persons disea^ed and troubled for my cause and sake only to satiffye the
pleasure of me alone? Of mea solius causa, with others like read Lauren. Val.
li. 2. eleg. cap. 1. about the middle where he does copiouslye, and cunningly
treat thereof. Vnum, 1. solum.

^^ Sumptus domi tantos ego solus facia^? Should I alone or being but one man
spend so much money, or be at so great charges in my house?

^^ Gnatum vnicum pariter vti his decuit aut etia^ amplius. It was mee^e that
my only Son should have had as much part of these things as I, or rather
more.

^^ Illa aetas magis ad haec vtanda idonea est, That age is more meet to occupy
those thing When there comes in any latin clause a geround of a transitiue*
that governs an accusative case after him, the gerunde may very elegantly be
changed into a noune participell of the voice of the future in dus, and made
to agree with the substantive in gendre, number ^ like case as the geru^d was
before it was changed. An example of the ablative case. Cic. in. praefa. li.
i. offic. Orationem latinam efficies profecto legendis nostris pleniorem. For
legendo nostra. Thy latin tongue thou shall vndoutee. ly make more full and
more copious by reading my works and such books as I have writ, An example
of the occusatiue. Idem li. i off. Meminerimus autem and aduersus infimos
iusticia^* esse seruandam, for seruandum esse iusticiam, And we must remember
to keep Justice, that is, to deal tustly and truly also with the poorest and
lowest persons that be. An example of the genetiue case. Ibid. Vt nec medici,
nec imperatores nec oratores, quamuis artis praecepta perceperint, quicquam
magna laud dignu^ sieve vsu exercitatione, consequi possunt officij
couseruandi: praecepta traduntur illa quidem, vt faciamus ipsi for praecepta
conferuandi officium. As nether physicians nor Captatnes in war, nor
pratours, though they have substanciall well learned all the rules of their
faculty, yet may not possibly attain to do any thing worthy great praise and
commendetio^, without much exercise and practicing* right so here be written
and given unto us preseptes of our office and duty, how to behave our selves
in our living toward al persons, but that is to y^ intent, that we must put
them in ure, and practice the same our selves, I said a verb transityue that
governs an accusaitue case, For such mutation or change may not be done in
any verbes governing any other case, and not an accusative. For we may not say
Placendi praeceptoris studium, but Praeceptori nor in Maledi cendo re, but
tibi, nor in abstinendis voluptatibus, but in abstineudo a voluptatibus, except
when abstineo is taken and made a transiti^e, nor ad abundanda bona, but ad
abundandum bonis. Therefore when we say ad haec vtenda, Children shall note that
the Latin men of old time used these verbes, vtor, fungor, f^uor, po^tior,
and sometimes careo governing an accusative case after them, examples be every
where ^^^umerable, apud Plaut. Tetentium, Cicerone^ iu^e consultos, and alios.

81 Eum ego eieci hinc miserum iniusticia mea, I have expulsed and driven him
from hense pore soul, by mine unreasonable fashion, or dealing which says in
an other place of this same seen thus Propter meas iniurias.

82 Malo quidem me dignum qnouis deputem, si id faciam. I might well think my
self worthy of any misaduenture in the world, if I should do such a thing.

83 Vsque dum ille vitam illam intollit pro colit* agit, degit. As long as he
lives such a life as that is, or as long as he lives after that sor^ or rate.

86 Illi de me supplicium dabo I will suffer him to punish me, I will suffer
puni^^, meant for his sake. Dare poenas, dare supplicium: Luere poenas, luere
supplicium, pendere paenas and pendere supplicium is to suffer punishment, or
to be punished. And they be construed with a ^^ominatiue of the party that
suffers the punishment, and with a dative case of the person that does
punish.

88 Nil relinquo in aedibus, nec vas, nec vestimentum I le^t nothing in the
house, neither vessel, or garment.

89 Corrasi omnia, I have scraped up, and sold altogether. Corrasi. i.
compila^i, vendidi. Donate.

92 Inscripsi aedes mercede, I gave up my house and wrote upon the doors, that
the house was to let, or to be sold. So Plau. in T^inummo Quia rure dum sum ego
vnos sex dies, me absente atque insciente, inconfultu meo, aedes venalet hasce
inscripsit literis. Because that while I have been in the country, but one
poor six days, he has written upon the door that this my house was to
sell, I being from home absent or out of the way, and knowing nothing thereof,
and without any counsel esking of me. Meo inconsultu. i. minime me consulens.

94 Agrum hunc mercatus sum. I have bought this plot of ground. The difference
between ager, fundus, villa, and praedium, Read in Valla. li. 6. eleg. cap.
41.

94 Hic me exerceo, Here am I occupied, or here do I exercise my self.

97 Non fas est vlla me voluptate frui, I may not take any manner pleasure.

99 Ingenio te esse in liberos leni puto, I reckon you to be of a gentle nature
and tender on your children.

100 Puto illum obsequente^ si quis recte aut commode tractet, I reckon him
tractable, or easy enough to be ruled, if a man did handle him well, or after a
good sort.

102 Neque tu illu^ satis noueras, nec te ille, Neither thou knew him very
well, nor he thee: or neither thou were very well acquainted with his fashion,
nor he with thine.

103 Nunquam ostendisti, quanti illum penderes, You never showed how much ye
set by him.

104 Nec ille tibi est credere ausus, And he durst not trust thee, nor he durst
not make the privy to things.

106 Ita res est, So goes the matter, or, so it is.

107 Illum saluum ad futurum efle confido propediem, I trust verily that he will
right shortly be here in good health.

109 Vtina^ dij ita faxint, God g^runt it may so be,

109 Si commodum est, hodie apud me sis volo, If you may conveniently, I would
desire you to make merry at my house to day.

111 Siccine est sententia? Think you so? or, is that your mind and opinion
in deed.

114 Quaeso tandem aliquantulum tibi parce, I pray you favor or spare your
self some what et trast after so great labor.

115 Been vale. Fare ye well, or God be with you.

115 Lachtymas excussit mihi, He has caused me to weep.

116 Miseret me eius I have pity on him.

117 Monere oportet me hune, ad coenam vt veniat, I must put him in
remembrance to come to supper.

118 ^bo vt visam, si domi est, I will go to see, it he be at home It is
showed before that, Viso, facesso, capesso, lacesso, with other like verbs in
so, be not desideratiues, as Priscian would have them, and that they signify
and betoken the moving and act of the body and not the affecte nor destre of
the mind: yet sometimes they be used for their primitiues, as here visam, is
put for his primitive Videam. And so it is to be taken, as often as it is
joined with any of these words, Venio, eo, is, iui, gratia, causa, studium, or
any other like voice.

119 Nihil opus fuit monitore, iamdudum domi praesto apud me aiunt, He had no
need of any man to put him in remembrance. For they say that be is at home
at my house all ready, and has vene a good while.

120 Egomet conuiuas moror, I my self cause my guests to tarry. Moror te (as
^estif^eth Donatus and also Valla) in orators is most taken for retineo te, or
in mora teneo, I cause thee to tarry Qui^^^liau. Quid me adhuc pater detines?
quid moraris abeuntem? Father where fore do ye hold and keep me back
still ^ Why do ye cause me to tarry that would be gone?

121 Quid crepuerunt fores? Why creeketh the door, or, what creaking makes
the door?

122 A me quisoa^ eg^editur? Who comes forth of my house? For the
preposttio^, a, toyned with the ablative of persons, betookeneth from the same
persons house, as, A iudice venio, I come from the Judges house, and so apud,
as Apud nos est, He is at our house, but this is most used in Poets.

122 Huc concessero, I will stand as^de here Co^cedo, dis concessi, concessum,
Sometime^ signifies to go, or to depart out of one place into an other, or to
stand aside, where to be secret.

In the second Scene.
1 Nihil adhuc est, quod vereare, There is no thing yet why thou should be
afearde.

2 Illum simul cum nuncio tibi hic affuturum hodie scio, I know well that he
will be here with you anon together with the messenger y^ went for him. Simul
cum nuncio, as who should say, as soon and with as great expedicion, as the
messenger that was sent for him.

3 Solicitudinem istam falsam, quae te excruciat, omittas, Let go that false
care and thought that vexes and freiteth thy heart.

4 Quicum loquitur filius? With whom talks my son?

5 Oportune aduenis, You come very well.

6 Hunc Menedemum nostin' nostrum vicinum.

Do ye know Men edemus here being our neighbor?

9 Mihi magna cum eo iam inde vsque a pueritia semper fuit familiaritas; I have
been very familiarly acquainted with him evermore, even from my childhoode.

10 Voluptatem magnam nuntias, Thou show tidinges that be very pleasant.

11 Quam vellem Menedemum inuitauum, vt nobiscum esset hodie. How glad would I
be that Menedemus had been desired to be in co^painy with us, or at my house to
day.

13 Cave faxis, non est opus pater, Beware do it not, it is not so expedient
father. We may say. Cave faxis, or cave ne faxis, Cave cad as, or cave ne
cadas: Fac scribas, or, Fac vt scribas. Cura fiat, or, Cura vt fiat, And it is
Eclipsis coniunctionis.

14 Incertum est etiam, quid se faciat, He can not yet tell what to do with
him self. Of such manner speakings as this, Quid se faciat, with others like,
it is noted before, Inceitu^ est. s. illi.

14 Modo venit, He came but now.

15 Time^ omnia, He fears all things.

15 Misere amat, He is very deep in love, or, he loves desperately.

16 Propter eam haec turba, atque abitio euenit.

For her sake has chanced all this business, or brabling, and going out of
the country.

17 Seruolum ad eum in vrbe^ misit, H^e has sent a servant into the city unto
him. Seruolum pro seruulum, per antithesin, Which is when one letter is put for
an other.

8 Quem minus miseru^ esse, credere est? Whom should a man think to be in a
better case, or less desperate?

19 Quid reliqui est, quin habeat, quae quidem in homine dicuntur bona,
parents patria, amicos, genus, cognatos, diuitias? What fails or wants,
but that he has al things at leastwise that in man are called and reckened
good things, that is to say, Father and mother, his country, friends, and
honest stock and degree of birth that he comes of kinsfolks, and richesse.

21 Haec perinde sunt, vt illius animus qui ea possidet, All these things be
such, as is the mind of him that has them in possession. Of the elega^t
joining of perinde, with ac, atque, vt quam quasi, acsi, atque, si. etc. Read
Hadr. de ser. lati.

22 Qui vti scit, ei bona sunt: illi qui no^ vtitur recte mala, To him that
knows how to use them they be good, and to him that can not use them as they
should do, they be ill.

23 Ille fuit senex importunus semper, That old fool was evermore
unreasonable.

23 Nihil magis vereor, quam ne quid in illu^ iratus plus satis faxit, I fear
nothing so much as this, least that he being moved, and bearing him
displeasure, will do some thing unto him worse than he should do.

25 Reprima^ me. i. tacebo I will hold my peace.

25 In metu esse illi est vtile, It is expedient for him to be kept in awe.

26 Quid tu tecum? i. loqueris? What say thou to thy self there?

26 Vtvt erat, mansum tamen oportuir, How so ever it was, yet he ought to
have tarried at home and not to have gone away. The voice of the particle of the
preter Tense is much taken and used per enallege partium, sieve per (...) for
the infinitive mode of the active voice. Secundum Donatum, or, of the passtue
voice. Secu^dum Priscianum. Salust. Prius* quam incipias consulto, and vbi
consulueris, mature opus est facto, before that a man begin any thing, he must
first take good aduisement and deliberation and when he has so consulted and
taken aduisement, he ought to do it with all celerity, speed, and expedition
where Priscian interprets consulto and facto i consuli and fieri. Terent in
Hecira. In arcem transcurso opus est. It were expedient to run and to make a
step to the castle. Transcurso* Donate expounds pro transcurrere But in such
speakinges as these, Volo datum, factum oportuit, mansum oportuit. etc. Is to
be understood (says Linacre) the infinitive mode, esse: So that it be the
preter tense of the infinitive mode passive. For by them is understood not
only the action, or, doing of a thing, but also the perfection and end of a
thing, already brought to pas and to a final end or effect. etc.

27 Fortasse aliquanto iniquior fuit, Perchase he was somewhat hard, strait, or
unreasonable.

28 Quem ferret si parentem non ferret suum? Whom should he have suffered or
forborne, if he should not have forborne his own father.

29 Hunceine erat aequum ex illius more, an illum ex huius viuere? Was it meet
that this man should live, as the other would heue him, or else the other to
live, as pleased this man?

30 Quod illum in simulat duru^, id non est? Where as he accuses him, or layth
to his charge, that he is hard or strait, that is not so. In simulare, is
properly to lay to ones charge a crime that is not true, but a forged matter.

30 Parentum iniuriae vniusmodi sunt ferme. The strattnesse or hardness of
Fathers toward their children, is of one sort, or after one rate, for the
must part.

33 Ea sunt ad virtutem omnia, All things be to the furtherau^ce of virtue,
as if he had said, to bring their children to goodness.

34 Vbi animus semel se cupiditate deuixit mala, necesse est consilia consequi
consimilia, When the mind has once enta^gled and captiued it self with an il
desire or naughty appetite, it cannot be chosen, but that semblable counsels
and purposes must needs ensue forthwith.

35 Hoc scitum est periculum ex alijs sacere, tibi quod ex vsu siet, It is a
noble and goodly sentence or saying, every man to prove by others, what may be
most expedient, and profitable for himself, Scitum. s. dictum. i. praeclarum
and doctrina plenum, quae confert ad vitam cum de coro inque officio dege^dam:
Periculu^ pro periealu^, per syncope^, Siet pro sit, per epe^thesin.

37 Ibo hinc intro, vt videa^ nobis quid caenae siet. I will go hence in, that
I may see what supper we have toward.

38 Vide, ne quo hinc abeas longius. See that thou go not far out of the way.

Out of the second act, in the first Scene.
1 Quam iniqui sunt patres in omnes adolescentes iudices, How unequal judges
be fathers against all youngmen.

2 Aequum esse consent, nos iam a pueris illico nasci senes, They think it
reason, that we even of little babes, should by and by become sage old men.

4 Ex sua libidine nos moderantur quae nunc est, non quae olim fuit, They rule
measure and order by their own wilful appetite that they have now, and not
that they had many years agone, that is, when themselves were young men as we
be now. Libido, libidinis, is sometime taken in bona^ partem, as Donate notes.
Sal. in Cat. Eagisque in decoris armis and militatibus equis, quam in scortis
and conuiuijs libidinem habebant. And they had pleasure and appetyte in goodly
harness and great horses for war, more than in harlots, and in feasting,
banketting, or reuelling.

5 Mihi si vnquam filius erit, nae ille facili me vtetur patre, If ever I shall
have a son in faith he shall have a very gentill father of me.

6 Et cognoscendi, and ignoscendi dabitur peccati locus, He shall have no time
to know his fault, and to have it pardoned or forgeuen. Ignosco is sometimes a
verb active and tra^sitiue, and governs an accusative, and a dariue, as,
Forgive me this one fault, Ignoscas mihi hoc vnu^ dilictum. Of such verbes it
is noted before Locus. i* tempus, spacium, sufficient time and space.

7 Mihi per alium often dit suam sententiam, He declares me his own mind
and opinion under the name and color of an other person.

8 Adbibit plus paulo, He has drunken a little to much, or as we use to say (in
jesting) he has taken a pot of maius.

8 Sua narrat facinora* He tells of the prankes that he has played in his
days.

9 Periculum facito, Prove.

10 Nae ille haud scit, quam mihi nunc surdo narret fabulam, In faith, full
little woteth he how deaf I am, or how ill I can hear now in this side, on
which he makes all this clattering unto me* Surdo narrare fabulam, to tell a
tale to a deaf body, is a proverb to be said of them that labor in vain.
And it is the same that we use to speak prouerbially. When we hear a thing
that likes us not, saying thus. I can not hear on that side: which may be
said properly in latin, Surdo narras fabulam, or Surdo canis. Virg. Non
canimus surdis, respondent omnia siluae.

11 Magis nunc me amicae dicta stimula^t, da mihi, atque affer nihil. Now at
this time, the sayings of my best beloue go nere to my stom^^k, give me this,
and bring me that, etc.

12 Quid respo^deam nihil habeo, I have nothing in the world, what to make
answer.

Quid pro quod, as quid magnum, for aliquod magnum, or aliquid magni, and
albeit it appear contrary to the nature of quid taken and used most commonly
for substa^tiue, and governing a genitive case after him, yet it is an elegant
manner of speakinge, and much used in probate authors, as well joined with
Ad^ecti^es put substantiuely, as also with substantives, and a greeing with the
same in case, gender, and number, as if it were an adjective. Cato de liberis
educandis. Si quid his datum sit esculentum. If any thing be given them to
eat, or that is man's meat. Ci. li. 2. epi. fam. Grave est homini pudenti
petere aliquid magnum ab eo, de quo se been meritum putet, ne id quod petat,
exigere magis, quam rogare, and in mercedis potius quam benefieij loco numerare
videatur, It is great pain or grief to a man that has any shame in him, to
desire any great thing of him, unto whom he thinks himself to have done
pleasure before, least that he may seem that thing, which he desires rather
to exact and to require as due, than to desire, and rather to recke^ or account
the same in place of a due reward or wages before deserved, then in place of a
benefit. And so in other examples innumerable which for breuity I omit.

12 Neque me quisquam est miserior, Nor there is any man living more miserable,
or in worse case then I am.

13 Suarum rerum satagit He has enough to do of his own, or he has a busy
piece of work of his own to do. Sat ago, saragis, sategi, satactum. Is to
have business or matters enough to do. And it is sometimes construed with a
genitive, as here, and sometimes it is put absolutely without any case joined
with it. And sometimes it signifies diligentem esse, seu festinare. To be
diligent, or to make busy speed and haste.

15 Mea amica est potens, procax, magnifica, su^ptuosa, nobilis. My best beloue
or paramour is a woman of good hability, ever craving, ladylike, a chargeable,
or costly piece, and a gentlewoman, Procax procacis. i. petax, ever asking and
craving, fourmed of proco, procas, which is poscere, to desire, and thereof
woers are called in latin proci, as who should say, poscentes vxorem atque
ambientes. Destring and demanding, or asking the wife that they woe.

16 Mihi religio est dicere. I dare not say it, or I have a conscience to
speak it. Religio. i. metus. Fear and as (we say) scrupulosity of conscience,
per metaphoram, for religio, properly is the true serving and worshipping of
God, and of holy things. Ex Cicero.

17 Hoc ego mali non pridem inueni, neque etie dum scit pater, It is not long
that I have perceived this displeasure or incommodity, nor my father does not
yet know it. Inueni. i. intellexi, sensi.

In the second Scene*
1 Si mihi secundae res essent. If I were wealthy or in prosperity, or if my
fortune were good.

2 Vereor ne me absente mulier corrupta sit, I fear least that the woman has
been perverted or made naught, while I have been away.

3 Concurrunt multae opiniones, quae mihi anim^ exaugeant. There come many
opinions together, that cause my mind much the more to think. Exaugere, is to
increase a thing, and to make it much more than it was, and thereof Exaugera
animum, is to increase the opinion of y^ mind, and to cause the mind much the
more to bow, and to incline to that opinion that it was in before. Per
metaphoram.

4 Sub imperio cuius est? Under whose rule or ordering is he?

5 Illi nihil praeter praecium dulee est, He thinks nothing sweet but money,
or there is nothing sweet unto him, or in his opinion, but money.

5 Hei misero mihi. Alas that ever I was borne. The interiections, heu, and
proh, gonerne a nominative case, as heu pietas, heu priscas fides, proh Jupiter
and an accufatiue, as heu me miserum. Proh deum atque hominum fidem, Hei
governs evermore a dative.

6 Etiam caves, ne videat forte te a patre aliquis exiens? Will thou beware yet
again least perchance some body coming forth from thy father espy thee?

7 Nescio quid mihi animus praesagit mali, I can not tell how my mind gretueth
me, that all is not well, or that I shall have some ill chance, or I can not
tell how my heart grudgeth against some ill to come. Praesagio, sagis
praesagiui, is to perceive a thing that is toward, before it come, of prae,
quod est ante, before, and sagire, hoc est acute sentire. To be quick of
perceiving, and smelling, and thereof dogs are called Sagaces, quick of
smelling or senting.

8 Pergin' isthuc prius dijudicare, quam scis quid very fiet? Do thou yet
still judge the matter, before thou know what the truth is.

9 Si nihil mali esset, iam hic adesset. If all had been well, he would have
been here ere now.

10 Non cogitas hinc longius abesse? Do thou not consider, that is a great
way hence.

10 Nosti mores mulierum, dum moliuntur, dum comuntur, annus est, Thou know
the guise of women, while they set forward* and while they attire, pike, and
trim themselves, it is a whole year. Molior, moliris* molitus sum. Is to force
a body, and streyne him self to do any thing. Como, mis, compsi, comptum; est
ornare. To make gay, or to attire, or to deck the bush: for in the trimming of
the hair consists a great part of the beauty of man or women.

12 Respira, Take a good heart.

12 Eccum Dromonem cum Syro vna adsunt tibi Lo yond Dromo and Syrus, they are
both here together. Tibi est datiuus festiuitatis graria adiunctus. Laur.
Valla has observed, that ecce and en signifle one thing, and be construed
indifferently with a nominative case, or with an accu satiue. Albeit he
protests, that he has not read (at least wise in any orator) yea and few
times in any Poet* ecce governing an accusative Eccum, eccam, eccos, eccas,
ellum, ellum, ellos, ellas, the same Ualla expounds not by pronounes,
contrary to Priscian and others, saying, Eccum* i. ecce eum, or ecce hunc, nor
ellum. i. ecce. illum, nor eccam. i. ecce eam, eccos. i. ecce. eos. ellam. ^.
ecce illam, ellos. i. ecce illos* but by aduerbes thus, eccum. i. ecce hie* s.
eu^, etc. ellum. i. ecce illic eum. etc. And eccam. i. ecce hic. s. eam. etc
eccos. i. ecce hic. s. eos. etc. ella^ i. ecce illic. s. eam etc. ellos. i. ecc
illic. s. eos. etc. And therefore they be joined with an accusative of the thing
that we will demonstrate a sewe. Terent in Eun. Eccum Parmenonem, eccum me. i.
ecce hic Parmenonem, ecce hic me. And here Eccum Dromonem i* ecce hic Dromone,
etc. So ellum, Parmenonem i. ecce illic Parmenonem, vel potius ecce illic
Parmeno secu^dum Vallam.

In the third Scene.
1 Ain' tu? Say thou so in deed?

1 Sic est. It is even so.

2 Interea dum sermones cedimus, illi sunt relicti While we have kept and
prolonged communication, they be lest a great way behind. Cedimus sermones i.
miscemus, ex Nonio.

4 Minime mirum, adeo impediti s^nt, ancillatum gregem ducunt secum. It is no
marvel that they have been so long in coming they be so restered, for they
bring a whole flock of may* den servants with them. Minime mirum* ^. est
illos tam tarde aduenisse.

5 Men' rogas? Do thou ask of me?

6 Non oportuit relictos, portant quid rerum, It was not well done to leave
the^ behind, for they bear some thing of charge about them.

6 Portant aurum, vestem, and vesperascit, and no^ nouerunt viam, They have
about them both gold, and apparel, and dark night comes fast on, and they
know not the way.

8 Factum a nobis stulte est, It was foolishly, or unwisely done of us.

8 Abidum illis obuiam propere, Go and meet them apace, Abidum pro abi,
parel^on est, as quisnam pro quis.

9 Vae misero mihi, quanta de spe decidi? Woe is me unfortunate Body that I
am, out of how great hope am I fallen or brought?

10 Quae res te solicit at? what thig troubles your mind? Solicitare here
betokereth inquietate, cura^ inijcere, to disquiet and to make pensife. So in
Andr. Cur ego mea^ senectute^ huius solicito ame^tia? why do I disquiet and
vex mine oldage for his folly? Plau. in Aulu. Quia isthuc facinus quod tuum
solicitat animum, id ego feci and fateor. For this deed that troubles and
vexes thy mind I did my self, and I confess it. Sometime Solicitare, to show
as well hope as fear. Plin. li. i. epist. Nulla spe, nullo timore* solicitos
nullius rumoribus inquietor. I am not mo^ued neither with any hope, nor with
any fear, nor I am not disquieted with the rumors or new tales of any man.
Tere^t. in Andria, Mis. Orare iussit, si se ames, hera, iam vt ad se venias.
Videre ait te cupere, Pamp. Vah perij, hoc malum integrascit. Siccine me atque
illam opera tua nu^c miseros solicitarier? Mis. My dame bid me pray you (if ye
love her) to come to her by and by, for she says that she would very feign
see you.

Pamph. Alas woe is me, this mischief is every day renewed worse and worse:
is it well done, that both I and she unhappy Bodies be thus brought in hope
and fear every day, by the means of thee? Sometime it is to provoke, or to
lie instantly upon, and to entice one to any thing. Curtius li. 2. Verum
enimuero cum modo milite^ meos litteris ad proditione, modo amicos ad perniciem
pecunia solici^et ad internecionem mihi persequendus est. But yet for as much
as he does egg and entice somewhyle my Soldiers by Letters to betraye me,
and somewhyle my friends with money and rewards to slay me. I must needs
pursue him to the death. And Solicito, is to be written with one single ^,
except in Poets, which double the same, l, Per epenthesin, metri causa. For
it is formed a solo, For what other thing is Solicitare then Solo citare, id
est Loco mouere? To move or stir a thing out of the ground that it stood
on. and out of his place. For that Solum does signify Locum, who doubts,
since that the etymology of the Latin word Exules, dicantur patriae suae solo
pulfi? And thereof Solicitare is to turn up ye ground in Ti^^ing or Ploughing.

Tibul. Et teneram ferro sollicitauit humum. And because that solum is said
also of the sea: Therefore solici^ere is some time taken for nauigare.

Claud. Et rudibus remis solicitauit aquas. For solum is every thing that
bears up and stays any thing as yt water is solum to the ships, and to the
fishes. Virg. Subtrahiturque solum. Et Ovid. Omne solum forti patria est, and
piscibus aequor. Et volucri vacuo quicquid in orb pa^et In which verse ^uid
calls the air solum to the birds and the sky is solum, to the stars.
Quid. Astra tenent sceleste solum. etc.

10 Rogitas quid siet? Do thou ask what it is, or what is the matter?

12 Nunc demum intelligo? I perceive it now at last, and so I did not before.
Demum and denique idem significant quod tandam. i. post longam moram: After
long tarying as in example.

When thou have well and perfectlye learned all things, then at last and not
before thou may teach others. Cum omnia perdidiceris, tum demum, or denique,
or tandem, docere alios potes, Secondarilye demum is taken for omnino vel
solum, specially when it is joined with these pronounes, hic, ille, iste, is,
or with these verbes ita, or sic, so that demum contains and imports a
certain excep^^o^ of an other thing, thus Ea demum est gloriosa laudatio, quae
a laudatis vitis proficiscitur, That praise and none else is to a man honor and
good name which comes and rises of honest men and praise worthy. Ita demum me
abs te amari sentia^ si huic homini mea causa co^modauetis, I will by this
means and none other, perceive and think, that you love me heartily well, if
you do pleasure unto this man for my sake.

Tum demum te amicum putabo, quum beneuolentiam erga me tuam re expertus fuero
I will then and never before think thee my friend, when I have in deed had a
proof of thy good will and hearty love toward me etc.?

13 Dij boni quid turbae est? Good Lord what a rabble, or train, or company is
there of them: and sometime it may be englished thus. Good Lord what array, or
trouble or business, or a do is there?

13 Acdes nostrae eos vix capient scio. Out house will scarsely hold them all, I
know well* or our house will uneath be able to receive them all, I am very sure.

14 Quid comedent* quid ebibent.? i. quantu^. How much will they eat and
drink? or what meat and drink will they spend?

14 Eccos quos volebam. Lo here them that I would have. How eccos is to be
expounded it is showed a little before.

15 O Jupiter vbinam est fides? O Jupiter where is honesty, or sure, and
faithful keeping of promises become? * For fides (as says Cicero lib. ^, offi.)
est dictorum conuentorumque constantia and veritas, ex quo credamas, quia fiat
quod dictu^ est appellata^ Fidem. Fides is the substa^tiall keeping, and the
true and sure agreing of a man's sayings and couenauntes, and the performance
of the same. And therefore let us believe and think verily this to be the very
true etimologie, that is to say, the very true reason, diffin^t^on and
interpretation of the word fides quia fiat quod dictum est, that such things
be done indeed that are promised in word, and when the deeds are aunswerable
and agreing unto the words, and sayings or promises.

16 Tu interea loci collocuple ^astire, Thou have enriched thy self in the
mean season, or thou have gotten great goods in the mean time.

17 Me in his deseruisti malis. Thou have forsaken me in this adversity or
distress.

18 Proptet quam in summa infam^a sum, and meo patri minus obsequens. For whose
cause I am in very great insamy, obicqu^e or scaunder, and ^m not ruled by my
father as I should be, or do not follow my fathers mind as I ought to do,
or less obedient to my father theu I should be.

22 Nemo est miserior me. There is no man more miserable or in worse case then
I.

22 Hic de verbis nostris errat, quae hic sumus ^ocuti, This man is deceived by
reason of our words that we have spoken here,

23 Aliter amorem tuum atque est accipis, You take your love otherwise then it
is, we say elegantly aliter, atque alter, ac or aliter quam, and aliter nisi,
when a negation goes before. Se examples in Hadrian.

24 Animus erga te idem est, ac fuit. My mind toward you, is the same that
it has been.

25 Quantum exipsa re coniecturam facimus. As far as we could coniect by, or
of the thing it self.

26 Nihil rerum omnium est, quod malim quam me hoc falso suspicarier. There is
nothing in the world that I would be more glad of, than that I did suspect,
surmise, and mistrust things falsely and untruly.

28 Anus, quae est dicta matter esse ei ante hac, non fuit, The old woman that
hitherto has been called his mother, was not his mother.

30 Ea obijt mortem. She is dead.

30 Hoc ipse in itinere alteri dum natrat, forte audiui, This did I hear by
chance as himself told it to an other body by the way.

32 Mane, hoc quod coepi primum enarrem, post isthuc veniam. Abide a while let
me first of all tell forth this that I have begone, and then I will come to thee
afterward.

34 Vbi ventum ad aedeis est Dromo pultat fores, When we came to the house,
Dromo knocked at the door. Pulto pultas is the same that Pulso pulsas, to
knock, to heat, or to rap, and it is formed of the Supine pnltum, which
supine the old writers did use but now it is out of use.

35 A^us quaedam prodit. Forth comes a certain old woman.

35 Haec vbi aperuit ostium, continuo hic se coniecit in tro ego consequor, As
soon as she had opened the door, he there whippe me^ in by and by, and I
after, hard at the tail of him.

37 Foribus obdit pessulum, He bolted the door.

38 Hinc sciri potuit, aut nusquam alibi quo studio vitam suam te absente
exegerit. By this way, or else by no way at all it might be known how buystly,
or in what occupation he has passed and led his life while you have been
absent from home. Studio. i. labor opere. Exigere aetatem or tempus and agere
aetatem, Is to pass and to spend out the years or time* exigere is for as
abigere to drive out of doors. Plaut. Exegit omnes for as. He drove every body
out of doors.

40 De improuiso est interuentum mulieri. We came upon the Woman suddenly or
unware.

41 Ea res dedit existimandi copia^ quotidianae vitae cousuetudinem, By that
thing we might eastly judge the daily conversation of his living*

42 Quotidianae vitae consuetudo cuiusque ingeniuium, vt sit, declarat maxume,
The daily conversation of living, does very easily and best of all things,
show what the disposition of every body is. Maxim. i. facillime, optime, and
there is the figure antithesis, that is, when one letter is put for an other.
As Scribundis prologis, for scribendis, animum aduortite. For aduertite, so
here maxume for maxim.

44 Terentem telam studiose ipsam offendimus. We found her at the loome
weauing full busilye. Offendo, dis, offendi, offensum, is sometimes the same
that reperio, to find by* chance. Of which verbes read Laurentius Valla.
lib. 5 Eleg. cap* 2

44 Offendimus eam medioctiter vestitam, vest lugubri, We found her meanly or
coursely apparelled in a mourning gown*

50 Obsecro ne me in laetitiam frustra conijcias I pray thee do not cast me
into great gladness in vain.

54 Si haec sunt vera, it a vti credo, quis te est fortunatior? If these things
be true as I think verily they be, what man is more fortunate, or who has
better fortune then thou?

57 Magnum hoc signum est eum esse extra noxa^, This is a great sign that he
is nothing culpable or faulty. Noxa secundum festum. Pompeium and Vallam, idem
est quod culpa and there of comes noxa dedere, in the civil law. i. poenae
dare, seu tradere ob noxam. i. culpam to deliver to be punished for so me
fault, offense, or trespass done, as if a man's servant or bondsman had done
any trespass against any person the party playntife took an action against
the master of such servant or bondsman and such manner actions are called in
the civil law, noxales actiones, That if the master of such servant or
bondmam (as aforesaid) would not mayntaine him in the said trespass or
offense done, he would and lawfully might yield his said servant or bondsman to
suffer bodily punishment, according to the order of the law yea and though it
were to death, and that was called noxa dedere extra noxam esse, idem est quod
extra culpam esse, hoc est noxa, aut culpa vacare not to be in fault, but to be
guilties or blameles. Noxa is samtimes taken for da^nu^ hurt or harm, Ovid.
lib. 15. Meth. Speaking of the waters of a certain lake in the country of
Arcadia, which was called Lacus phineus.

Nocte nocent potae sine noxa luce bibuntur. If one drink of them in the
Night, they will hurt him, but in the day time a man may drink of them without
any harm at all. Suet. in lul. Caesar cap. 81. Spurinamque irridens and vt
falsu^ argue^s, quod sine vlla sua noxa idus Martiae adessent, quanquam is
venisse quidem eas diceret, sed non praeterijsse. And mocking or scorning
Spurina, and reprouinge him as foul deceived in y^ the Ides of the month of
March were come without any his harm notwithstanding that the said Spurina
still said and affyrmed, y^ the said Ides of March in deed were now come, but
that they were not yet past, or begun. For Spurin a being a Soothsayer, had
warned Caesar before to beware of the Ides of March, for he should be slain as
that day, and so he was.

59 Disciplina est, eisde^ munerarier ancillas primu^ ad dominas qui affectant
via^, This is a schole or this is the fashion, manner order, or trayn that must
be used, that is what soever person desires to have his way made unto the
mistresses must first reward or bride the maiden servant with semblable things
as he would give unto the dames themselves.

Disciplina plinae, is that any disciple or scholar takes of his master, as
any fashion or sort of living, or of doing any manners, or other doctrine. And
thereof it is called a Schole, as in example. Christ did forbid that we should
put a way vyolence by vyolence, and bid us to do good for ill, but now we have
learned another Schole. Christus vim vi repellere prohibuit and bona pro malis
reddere praecepit at nu^c alia est disciplina, So Disciplina militaris is the
fashion that youg soldiers are before exercised in, and trained, after to be
made perfect good men of ware, Disciplina gladiatoria, is the precepts and way
of trayning men in the weapons and the Schools that masters of fence keep.
Disciplina scholastica is the doctrine that scholars be trained in by their
Masters, and thereof among the Philosophers, the diverse sects are called
disciplinae, as disciplina Stoitorum is the sect of y^ Stocks, Discipla
Peripateticorum is the sect of the Peripatetiques and so of others, which had
every of them a sundry fashion, or train from an other.

So Disciplina meretricia, is the Schole and doctrine that the light Huswyues
and strumpets have among them, and teach it to their disciples. Nam ea quoque
si dijs placet, artis iam nomen ob^iuuit. Munetor, raris, has here the nature
and signification of a verb de, ponent, Plaut and Macrobius used Munero, ras,
neutrali significatione, For there be certain verbes, which be neuters in o,
and deponentes in or, under one signification, as assentio, assensi, and
assentior, tiris, assensus sum, to assent, or to grant, Impartio, impartiui,
and impertior, ^ris impertitus sum, to give part.

Comperio, and comperior co^peri (for the preterperfect, compertus sum, the
Latin men have not said in the active signification (to have sure knowledge,
Iurgo gas, and iurgor garis, to ch^^e, Fabrico, cas, in poets and Fabricor,
caris, in orators to imagine, Populo, las, and populor to destroy A dulo, as,
and adulor, aris, to flatter, Lux urio, as, and Luxurior, aris, to be frank,
or to be ryotous Lacrimo, and Lachrimor to weep with others mo, which Nonius
Marcellus reckeneth up.

61 Perge obsecro te, Go forth in your tale, I beseech you.

61 Cave ne falsam gratiam studeas inire, Beware that thou desire not to pycke
or to have a thank of me undeserved, or beware that thou go^ not about to make
me thank thee for nothing

62 Quid ai^, vbi me nominas? What would he say when thou did name me?

63 Dicimus redijsse re and rogare, vti veniret ad to We toulde him that you
were come home again, and that your desired him to come unto you.

64 Mulier lachrymis opplet os totum sibi, The woman all to washed all her face
with blubring and weeping.

67 Prae gaudio, ita me dij ament, vbi sim nescio timui As God help me, I
cannot tell where I am for toy, I was so afraid before.

68 At ego nihil sciebam. But I knew that then was no cause why at all.

70 Adducimus tuum Bachidem, We bring here with us your sovereign lady Bacchis.

72 O hominis impudentem audaciam. O that shameless boldness that is in the
fellow.

73 Non sit sine periculo facinus magnu^ and memorabile. A great act and worthy
memory, is never done without peril. Hic and haec memorabilis, and hoc
memorabile, a thing worthy to be had in memory. Plaut. in cap. At erit mihi
hoc factum mortuo memorabile. But this act shall be had in memory, when I am
dead and rotten. Col. in prae. Cum tot alios Romani generis lutuear memorabiles
duces, When I behold so many noble captaynts and worthy memory of the blood of
the Romans. Cic. de amicitia. Cum accepissemus a patribus maxim memorabile^
C. Laelij and P. Scipionis familiaritatem. When he had heard of our fathers and
ancestors the familiarity of C. Lelius and P. Scipio of most worthy memory.
etc. Read in Chil. Erasm. the proverb. Difficilia quae pulchra. Unto the which
this sentence or clause of Terence is aluded.

74 Hoc vide in mea vita tu tibi laudem is quaesitum seelus. See I pray you,
thou ghost about to get unto thy self a praise, glory, or honor by the hasarde
and danger of my life thou naughty fellow. Is quaesitum, id est, quaeris. Hoc
vide, is a manner of Latin speaking much used in Tere^ce, and Plaut.
signifying the same that we say in english in indignation or anger. See I pray
you, as before in Eunucho. Illud vide* os vt sibi distorsit carnifex. Se I pray
you how the villayne makes a wrye mouth. Idem in Adelph.

Illuc vide, vt in ipso atticulo oppressit. See I pray you, how he has come
vpyon me, and taken me sodeynely even at the very point of mischief. etc.

75 Si paululum modo quid te fugerit perierim. If thou be ouerseene in any
thing be it never so little, I am utterly undone, or I may give my life for an
half penny, Of Paululum quid, or paululum aliquid propaululu^ aliquod, with
other like it is largely showed.

76 Si sinas dicam, If you would let me alone, I would tell you.

77 Quas, malum. ambages mihi narrare occipit What the devil goinge about the
bush begins he to use in telling his tale? Malu^ is sometime an
interiection, or after Donat* an Aduerbe of anger and indignation, and is
sweetly brought in (says Donate.)

Cic. lib. 2, off. Preclare in epistola quada^ Alexandrum filium Philippus
accusat quod largitione beneuole^tiam Macidonum confectur. Quae te malu^ inquit
ratio ipsam spe^ induxit, vt eos ti bisideles putares fore, quos pecunia
corrupisses? Phillippus king of the Macedonians did very nobly rebuke and
blame his son Alexander, in a certain Epistle that he wrote unto him, where
he said thus, what (the Devil) occasion or consideration has brought thee
into this hope that thou should think that they would be, and continue
faithful unto thee whom thou have corrupt with money?

78 Ad rem redi, Return to the purpose or pith of the matter.

79 Euimuero reticere nequeo, Truly I can not but speak.

79 Multis modis iniuris Clitipho est, neque ferri potis est, Clitipho is
unreasonable many ways, nor any man may suffer, or abide his unreasonable
fashion.

80 Audiendum hercle est, tace. In faith you must needs here, or you may not
choose but hear, hold your peace.

81 Vix potiri tuum esse in potiu^do periclum non vis* you would feign have
your desire and pleasure, but you will abide none adventure in laboring for to
obtain it. We say potior, poteris, vel potiris, potitus ^um, And in latin
speaking it governs the Genitive plural of this noune res, when it is set
alone, and notioyned with an adjective, and then it signifies to bear a rule,
and to have in our dominion. or to govern the Empire, as Augusto rerum potito
totus quieuit orbis. When Augustus had or ruled the Empire, all the world was at
rest and peace. And in that signification, that is to say. betokening to
surmount, or to have in our dominion, and under our subjection, Potior is read
and joined also with ctrtayne other Genitiues besides rerum* plaut. in cap. Nam
postquam meus rex est potitus hostiu^. After that the king my master had
surmounted his ennemies, and gotten the ouerhand of them. Idem in Epidico,
Atque hostium est potita, And she has subdued or conquered her ennemies.
Salust.

Cui fatum foret vrbis potiri, Whose destenye it was to win, or to obtain
the Cittye, and to be Lord of it. But of all other casual words, yea, and
also of the said noune res being joined with any other adjective, then such as
may appertayn to the signification above noted, Potior governs an ablative
case, and then it is to obtain or get any thing by laboring, as Potitus sum
victoria, I have gotten the victory etc. Potior is also read, governing an
acculatiue as in old time it was used. Plaut. in Asinar. Fortiter malum qui
patitur, idem post potitur bonum. He that suffers and manfully endures the
sour, shall afterward have the sweet, or, he that does stoutely abide the
pain for any thing, shall afterward have the pleasure of the same. Terent in
Adel, Ille alter sine labor patria potitur co^moda, That my other brother
Mitto without any his pain and labor, has all pleasures, and commodities
belonginge to a father or that a father should have, Ibidem. Miseriam omnem
ego capio hic potitur gaudia. I abide all the care sorrow, and misery, and he
has all the joy and pleasure. Cic. in Phi. Itaque si receptis illis possumus
esse liberi, vincamus odium, pacemque potiamur. Therefore if we may be free, and
out of all subjection when we have received those things then let us overcome
hatred or enmitye, an^ let us have peace. Potior is fourmed of potis and
therefore (says Valla) they be both very lik^ in signification, For we say in
latin.

Sum compos mentis, compos animi, compos rationis, compos sanitatis, when I
have the things here rehearsed, Also we say in latin

Sum compos voti, compos victoriae, compos optati. When I have by my labor and
industry gotten or obtained the said things. Imp^ in signification is clean
contrary unto compos

82 Haud stulto sapis, You are no small fool.

84 Aut haec cum illis sunt habenda, aut illa cu^ his amittenda. Either thou
must be (...) to have these things together with the other or else to leave and
let go the other things t^gether with these.

85 Harum duarum conditionum nunc vtrum m^ uis vide, Now see whether of these
condition thou would rather or leauer have.

86 Co^silium quod coepi rectum esse and ^utum (...) I know that the
counsel, or deuyse that have begone to take, is good, and nothing dangerous.

88 Quod illi es pollicitus eadem haec inuenia^ via, That that thou have
promised unto him will find out and get by this self same way or mean.

89 Quod vt efficerem, orando surdas iam aures reddieris mihi, Which thing
that I would bring to pass for thee thou had already long before made
mine ears dull and deaf, with much desyryng and prayng.

90 Quid aliud tibi vis? what would you else have? or what would you more have,

90 Experiu^do scies, By assaying, or proving thou shall know, experiundo pro
experiendo per a^^ithesin.

91 Age, age, cedo istuc tuum consilium, quid id est, Go to, come one tell us
that thy devise, what is it?

94 Longum est si tibi narrem, quamobrem id faciam. It would be a long tale to
tell if I should show you wherefore I should do it.

96 Nihil satis firmi video, quamobrem accipere hunc mihi expediat metu^, I see
no substantial cause to trust to, why I should take such a fear or why it
should be expedient for me to be thus afeard. Quamobrem is elegantly used in
such manner speakinges as this. And in the same plate might also have been set
with like eleg^cy of latin speaking, cur, quare, quapropter, or qua causa
according to the use and manner of speakinge of Tullie and others the latin
men of old time where as now most men use commonly to say, nihil propter quod
and nulla causa propter quam* etc. read examples apud Hadrianum.

97 Mane, habeo aliud si is^hue metuis, quod (...) con^iteamini sine periclo
esse, Abide I (...) ymagined, or found out an other thing if (...) be afearde
of this, which you both will clearly grant to be void of all peril, or to be
without al danger. Periclo pro periculo per syncop^

98 Huius modi obsecro aliquid reperi. Find (...) or imagine some such thing, I
pray thee ha^^^ly, for Gods sake.

99 Ibo obuiam illis, dica^ vt reuertantur domum, I will go meet them, and
bid them return^ home again.

100 Ademptum tibi iam faxo amnem metum. I will find the means to ryd thee ou^
of all fear^ by and by.

100 In aurem vtramuis otiose dormias, Neue^ break any sleep for the matter
hardly. Dorm^re in vtramuis aurem, in vtrumuis oculum I^ a proverb signifying
to be quiet, and nothing^ troubled in the mind, For such as be in sorrow care
or pain, can not sleep soundly, for the often recordation of their evils. See
Erasm* i^ Chiliad.

101 Quid ago nunc? What is it best for me to do now.

101 Dic modo verum, Tell me truth, or say truth now, modo properly signifies
a time very little past. But sometimes it signifies time present or instant.
Sed raro inqui^ dona^us in He^ cyra* Plau. in Sticho. Deos salutabo modo*
postea ad ^e continuo transeo. I will now say my devotions to the Gods, and
than I will come over to thee immediately except modo be here also taken for
solum. Terent. in Adelph. act 3. s^e. 1. Modo dolores metu occipiunt primulum,
O good sweet nourse, the pains of trauayling of my daughter do now first
begin a little, and here immediately following.

103 Datur modo, fruare dum licet, nam nescias, eius sit potestas posthac, an
nu^quam tibi, Now thou may have it, use it while thou may, for thou can
not tell, whether it shall ever hereafter come any more to thy hands again or
never.

106 Verum hercle isthuc est, In deed truth it is that you say.

107 Adsum, dic quid est, Here I am, ^el me what is the matter.

108 Iam ho^ quoque negabis tibi placere, Thou will say anon, yt thou likest
not this neither.

108 Me, and meam famam permitto tibi, I commit both me and my name, fame or
honesty, wholly unto you, or, I put my self and my good name and fame wholly in
your hands.

110 Ne quid accusandus sis? vide. See that thou be not blame worthy.
Accusandus, is here a nou^e. For participles be four manner of ways changed
into the nature of nounes. First when they be compou^ded with such words as
their verbes be not: as innocens, indoctus, insipiens, for we do not say
innoceo, indoceo, nor insipio. Secondarily, when they govern after the^ and
other case, than ye verb that they come of: as, aeris abundans, amans vini,
fugitans litium, pecuniae cupiens. For when they be participles they govern
the cases of their verbes. Thirdly, when they form of them all the degrees of
comparison: as amans, ama^tior, amantissimus, doctus, doctior, doctissimus.
Fourthly, wha^ they betoken no time, as amandus. i. amari dignu^, Worthy to be
loved, accusandus. i. accusa^i dignus. Worthy to be shent or blamed.

111 Ridiculum est isthuc me admonere, quasi isthic minor mei res agatur, quam
tua, It is a mad thing that thou will warn or tell me of this, as though the
matter did not appertain to me, as much as to thee, or did not touch me as
nighly as thee. Read the proverb.

Tu^^es agitur, in Chiliadibus. Eras.

113 Hic si quid nobis forte aduersi euenerit, tibi erunt pa^ata verba, huic
homini verbera, If any thing shall happily chance unto us in this matter other
wise* then well, thou shall percase here of it, but it is I, that shall abie
for it, or if we shall have any ill chance in this matter, thou shall nothing
but be chydden for it, and have words, but it is this body of mine that
shall ab^de or have the strokes.

115 Neutiquam res hac neglectui est mihi. I do not pass light on this matter,
or I do not entende to be negligent, or to sleep in this matter.

117 In eum iam res redijt locum, vt facere sit necesse. The matter is now come
to that po^^te that I may not chose but do it.

118 Merito t^ amo, My love is well bestowed on you.

119 Perdocta est probe, She can her lesson well enough, or she is taught her
lesson in the bests wise I warrant you.

120 Hoc d^miror, qui tam facile potueris persuadere illi, This I marvel
greatly at, how thou could so soon persuade, or bring him in mind.

122 In tempore ad eum veni, quod rerum omnium est primum, I came unto him in
season, which thing is the chief and principal of all things. Read the
proverb, Nosce tempus, in Chiliad Erasm.

124 Art tractabat virum, id est, hominem, He^ handled the fellow craftily or
sub^^ly

126 Vt esset apud te ob hoc quam gratissimus, That he might be in very good
favor with thee for the same.

127 Sed hens tu, vide sis ne quid imprudens tuus, But sirrah, see that you
play no wild touch^ ere you be ware, or forgetting your self. Vide sis, the
particle sis, is as much as si vis, and is put for it often times, as sodes for
si audes, or sultis for si vultis. And it is much used for an aduerbe of
exhorting, or else other whiles for a voice expletiue, so that it is parelcon.
And it is also vox enclitica, that is to say, it causes the word before going,
to be accured. Plau. in Amph. Iam sequere sis, herum qui ludificas dictis
delirantibus. Come after me at ones, thou which mockest me, being thy master
with thy fa^^^sh sayings. It is used sometime also in orators. Cic. pr sexto
Roscio. Age nu^c refer anim u^ ^is ad verioate^. Well go to now, return thy
mind to the very plain truth of the matter. Imprudens. i. incogitans, unware,
unadvised, for fault of remembrance and co^stderation. Ruas. i. immodeste
agas, gerasue quasi temerarius.

128 Patrem nouisti. ad has res quam sit perspicax, Thou know thy father
how quick of sight he is in such things, and how sone he ca^ espy them.

129 Ego te noui, quam esse soleas impotens, I know thee how wild and
without stay thou art wont to be, and unable to rule thy self. Impotens is he
that cannot master, rule, refrain, stay, or measure the affections, passions,
or desires of the mind, but passes reason, and keeps no measure or mean.
whether it be in anger, joy, sorrow, pleasure, or else what. Ter. in An. Adeo
impotenti esse animo, vt praeter ciuiu^ morem atque legem and sui voluntatem
patris, tamen hanc habere studeat cum summo probro? Should he be so ^arre out
of reason, beeyond himself, or so outrageous, that he should labor and go
about to have her to his wife, against the usage and custom of all honest men
in the city, and against the law, and contrary to the mind or will of his
own father?

130 Inuersa verba, euersas ceruices ^uas gemitus screatus, russeis, risus,
abstine, Thy stumbling or tripping in thy wordea, speaking one thing for an
other, thy streiching or putting forth of thy neck thy sighing, spitting,
coughing, and laughing, or gig^ing or will spering, forbear thm. Inuerto, it is,
verti, inuersum, is to turn ye contrary side outward, as of a furre, or of a
cay* or any other thing, and thereof inuertere verba* est praepostere aliquid
efferre. To pronounce words and to bring them out, so that we speak one
thing for an other* as they use to do whose tongues commonly speak that
thing, upon which their mind runs most.

132 Laudabis me, Thou shall con me good thank.

133 Quam cito nos consecutae sunt mulie^cs. How soon the women have
overtaken us.

135 Nihilo magis, Nere a deal the rather.

137 Abeas si sapis, Get thee hence if thou wise be.

138 O hominem faelicem, O happy man that ever he^ was borne.

In the fourth Scene.
1 Edepol te laudo, and fortunatu^ iudico, cum studuisti* isti formae mores vt
consimiles forent. Truly I commend thee, and think thee fortunate or happy,
that thou have so endeavored thy self, that thy Conditions and behauioure
might be according, or aunswerable unto thy beauty.

3 Minime miror, si te sibi quisque expetit. I marvel nothing at all, that
every man desires greatly to have you.

4 Mibi, quale ingenium haberes, in dicio fuit oration, Your communication well
notified unto me, of what disposition you were.

5 Cum mecum in animo vitam tuam considero, When I consider thy manner of
^ining in my mind.

7 Et vos esse istiusmodi, and nos non esse, haud mirabile est, That you be
such as you are, an we not, it is no marvel at all.

11 Nobis prospectum est We be provided for.

11 Deserti viuimus, we live as folks al forsaken.

14 Hoc beneficio vtrique ab vtrisque vero deuincimini, vt nunquam vlla amori
vestro incidere possit calamitas, By ye good help of this thing you be in such
wise bound either to other, that no mishap may at any time chance in your love
or friendship, as who should say, that there can no misfortune befall, able to
break and to undo the love that is between you. Lau. Val. Very well she weth,
that Cicero or Quintilian, never used to say neuter neutri, nor properly
vterque vtrique, but vterque alteri, as Ci. in praefatione officioru^. Eodemque
modo de Aristotele and Isocrate iudico, quoru^ vterque suo studio delectatus,
contempsit alterum. And the self same wise I judge of Aristotle and ^socrates,
of whom either delighting and taking singular pleasure and felicity in his own
study (that is to for Aristotle in Philosophile, and Isocrates in Rhetoric)
despised the other. Quintil.

Cum vterque alteri obijciat, palam est vtrunque feeisse. Since that either of
them lays it to others charge, it is manifest and open, that both the one and
the other of them did it. Yet nevertheless Terence in Phormione says, Quia
vterque vtrique est cordi. Because that both like either other very well. And
also in the tenth Book of the Commentaries of the Iestes of Caesar (which
book it is doubled, whether Hercius, or Oppius, did write) Interim dissensione
orta inter Achille^ and Arsionen, cum vterque vtrique insidiaretur, and summam
imperij ipse obtinere veilet. etc. In the mean season dissension, strife, and
debate, arising between Achilles and Arsione, when either of them laid wait
to destroy other, and desired to get and have the chief rule of the whole
Empire him self* etc.

16 Nescio alios, me scio sem per fecisse sedulo, vt ex illius commodo meum
compararem commodum, I know not other men, but my self I know, that I have
right diligently endeavored and applied my self to get and to esteem my
commodity by his commodity, or in such wise that it might always stand
together with his commodity.

19 Omnes mihi labores fuere, quos coepi, leaves, All the labors yt I took, me
thought but light.

22 Vt patrem tuum vidi esse habitum diu, etiam duras dabit. As far as I have
seen thy father, or, as I have scene thy Father disposed this long while, he
will yet deal hardly, or roughly with thee. Duras. s. parts before in Eunu*
Duras fratris parts praedicas. My brother is in hard case by thy saying.
Duras alicui parts dare, Is to handle a body hardly, and it is a proper manner
of latin speaking of like sense, as we half prouerbially say in English, to
give one the worse end of the staff.

23 Quisnam hic est, qui intuetur nos? What fellow^ is this same here, that
beholds us, or looks on us?

24 Amab^, quid tibi est? I pray you, what ayleth you? Est i. accidit.

24 Quid stupes? Why art thou astonyed?

25 Video ne Cliniam, an non? Have I espied or do I see Clinia or not?

25 Quem vider? Whom see thou? or whom have thou espied?

26 Salve anime mi, vt vales? God save you mine own sweet heart, how fare you?

27 Saluum te venisse gaudeo, I am right glad and joyous that you be come home
safe and in good heath.

27 Teneo ne te maxim animo exoptate meo. Oh whom my heart does most desire,
have I, or do I hold you in mine arms? (as who should say) I am sure that I
touch you, and that you be here?

29 Ite intro nam vos iamdudum expectat senex, Go ye in, for the old man
looks for you, or tarieth for you, and has done a good while. Of dudum,
pridem, nuper, iamdudum, and iampridem, and the use of them in latin speaking,
it is showed before.

Out of the third act, in the first Scene.
1 Lucescit, It dayeth, or it is almost broad day.

1 Cesso pulsare ostium, I am slack in knocking at the door.

3 Adoleseentem hoc nolle intelligo, I perceyu^ that the youngma^ would not
have this done, or I perceive that this is against, or contrary to the young
man's mind.

4 Cum videam miserum hunc tam excruciarier eius abitu, For as much as I see
this poor soul to be in such great sorrow and heaviness, or pain, because of
the going away of them.

5 Celem tam insperatum gaudium? Should I keep privy or hyde from him this joy
so greatly unlooked for ^ Celem. s. eum, for celo, is one of the^ that
governs a double accusative case, albeit, we may say in latin, Celauit me
hanc rem, or Celauit me de hac re, or Celauit hanc rem, yea and Terentius in
Phormione, joined a dative case with celo, saying. Si hoc celetur patri in metu
sum. If this be kept, or hidden to my father, I am in fear. And Aemilius
Probus joined caelo with the same case, saying, Id Alcibiadi caelari diutius
no^ potuit, That thing might no longer ve hidden to Alcibiades.

7 hand faciam, I will not do it, or, I will not so do.

7 Quam potero adiutabo senem, I will help the old man as much as I shall be
able. Quam pro quantum.

8 Video filium meum amico, atque aequali suo inseruire, and socium esse in
negotijs. I see that my son does gladly take pain for his friend and
companion, and takes such part as he does in all his matters or business.

They be called in latin aequales, which be of one age and time, and specially
which have been brought up together, as companions and play felows* Inseruio,
is, seruiui, inseruitu^, to do pleasure or service for a man volu^tarily or
gladly.

10 Nos senes est aequum senibus obsequi, It is meet for us old folks to do
pleasure each for other, or reason would, that we old men help one an
other. Obsequi. i. inseruire.

11 Ego profecto egrerie ad miseriam natus sum, Truly I am notably borne to
Misery, wretchedness, misfortue, or adversity.

12 Illud falsum est, quod vulgo audio dici, diem adimere aegritudinem
hominibus, That is a false or untrue saying, which I hear commonly spoken
among men, that long continuance or process of time takes away care and
thought from men's hearts.

14 Nam mihi quidem quotidie augescit magis aegritudo, For unto me at least
wise my* sorrow, care, or grief, waxes every day more and more, Augesco, is
not to begin to wax or to grow more, but still to be every day more and
more. For verbes in sco, do not signify beginning, nor should not be called
inchoatiues) as Priscianus and other Grammaria^s would have them called) but
rather continuatiues, as the which betoken encreaseme^t: as, aegresco not to
begin to be sick, but to be sicker and sicke^r. Verg. li. 12. Aeneid, Haud
quanquam dictis violentia Turni flectitur, exuperat magis, aegrescijtque
medendo. The indignation or fiercenes of Turnus might in no wise be bowed,
mitigated, assuaged, or pacified with any the words or counsel of Latinus,
but arose, swelled, and still waxed worse and worse, and the more Physic of
good counsel that Latinus bestowed on him to pacify his said indignation or
fiercenes, the more and more the same still waxed. Inualesco, to wax or to grow
stronger and stronger. Quin. Tenuit consuetudo, que quotidie inualescit, a
custom has been taken up and received, which waxes stronger and stronger
every day. Lacta. Si nostra inualueri^t, vt quotidie inualescu^t. etc. If our
part get ye better, as every day it waxes stronger and stronger. Co^ualesco
also to wax stronger and stronger in health. Cic. Quanto plura illa miscebat,
tanto hic magis indies conualescebat. The more medicines or drinks y^ other
mingled. the more and more healthful were y^ other Crudesco, to wax or to be
rawer and rawer. Vir. Sin in processu caepit crudescere morbus, etc. But if in
the process of time, y^ the disease begin to be rawer and rawer, etc. Sordesco
is to wax more and more filthy. Concenesco to wax older, and not to begin to
be old, and so of Macesco acesco, nigresco, albesco, tabesco, With other verbes
in sco, yet here it is to be noted, that many in sco, have the signification
of their primatiues, and be used for them: as conticesco for co^ticeo,
adhaeresco for adhaereo, delitesco for deliteo, concupisco for concupio,
obdormisco for obdormio. With others mo, as shows Lau. Val. li. eleg. 22.

15 Quanto diutius abest, tanto magis desiderosi: eum. The longer it is since he
has been away so much more am I desirous to see him.

17 Ipsum for as egre^^^ video, adibo, alloquar, I see him self come forth, I
will go unto him and speak to him.

18 Nuncium oporto tibi, cuius maxim te (...) participem cupis, I bring you
that tidinges which you are most destrous to hear of. N^^ cius, cij* cio, in
the masculine gendre, signifies both the bringer of any message or tidinges, ^
also the message or tidinges that is brought. Plaut. in S^icho. Praecucurri, vt
nunciarem nu^cium exoptabilem: I came runninge before (...) show tydinges,
which you desire to ^eare (...) ^e it, some Grammarians say, that nuncium* cij,
cio, in the neuter gender, signifies the message or tidinges that is brought,
which vocable Laur. Valla says, that he never read (...) found in no probate
author. And somti^^^ it is read nuncius, a um* having the nature and place of
an abiectiue, as nu^cia verba. etc. There is also read haec nuncia, nunciae in
ye feminine gender, for her that brings tidinges.

20 Nunquid nam de gnato meo audisti? Have you heard any tydinges of my son?

21 Vbina^ est quae so? Where is he I beseech yo^^

21 Est apud medomi He is at home at my house

23 Duc me ad illum obsecro* Bring me unto him I pray thee for Gods sake.

24 Non vult te scire se redi^^e* He would not have you know, that he is come
again.

24 Tuum conspectum fugi^a^ propter peccatum, He absenteth or keeps himself
out of your ^ight for the fault that he has done.

Timet, ne tua duri^^a illa antiqua etiam adaucta sit, He ^eareth least the
same your old or wont hardness be now increased or waxed more and worse then
ever it was.

Non tu ei dixisti, vt essem? Did not thou tell him how he was minded? Vt
essem. i. quo modo effectus essem, vel quo animo essem, Of what mind I was.

Pessime isthuc in te, atque in illum consulis* In this thing thou do very
ill, both for thy self and for him. Or therein thou take a very ^ll way,
both for thine own part and also for his, Consulis. i. statuis, dec^^^^^: and
it is an eligant manner of speaking.

Te leni and victo animo esse ostendis, Thou show thy self to be gentle or
tender hearted, and sone ouercomed.

Satis iam satis pater d^r^s fui, I have been a hard, straight, or heavy Father
unto my son long* and long enough now, There is understood D^^*

Vehementis in vtramque partem es nimis, Thou art to vehement, to affectionate,
or to hot, both in one part and in the other.

In eandem fraudem, ex hac re atque ex illa incides. Thou shall fall into one
and the same ^ra^* both by this thing and by that, or both by the one thing
and by the other. Of the signification of this noune fra^s it is showed before.

Pa^lulo tum ^ra^ contentus eique erant gratia omnia^, He could then have been
contented with very little, and every thing was thankefully accepted or
welcome unto him*

37 Pe^^erruisti hinc. ^ illum. Thou have br^^^ him away hence for fear.

38 Coepit victum vulgo quaerere* He began to get his living abroad or here
and there.

39 Nunc cum sine magno detrimento non potest haberi, quiduis dare cupis, Now
that it cannot be gotten or had without great loss and damage thou would
fame or with all thy heart give thou carest not how much.

40 Vt scias quam ea instructa pulchre ad pern^^^^ ^^et, for sit. That thou
may know how good^^ she is appointed to undo, or to cast away any man, or
to bring any man to naught.

42 Ancillas secum adduxit plus december. She has brought with her at her tail ten
maidens and mo^

43 Sa^rapes si siet amator, nunquam sufferre e^^ sumptum q^^a^ A great Lord,
if he were (...) lover, might never be able to bear or to su^^^^*ne the
sumptuous charges of her. Hic and haec Satrapes, huius Satrapae, is a vocable
which the latin men have taken of the Greeks, and the Greeks out of the
Pe^^^ans, and it signifies a ruler, a captain, or a lieuetenau^t of any
province, as the captain of Caleis, or the Captain of the I^^e of Wight, or
the Lieu^^enau^^ of Irelande, may be called in Latin Satrap^^ or Sa^^^apa. For
Satrapein in Greek is Prouincia.

46 Et vnam coenam, atque eius com^^^bus de^^ quod si iterum mihi sit danda,
actum fiet, for ^it I have given but only one supper to him and to his train
or company, that if I should make one supper more, I might be utterly undone by
it, or it were enough utterly, to undo me. Actu^ est, is a prouerbiall
speaking, signif^ing desperation of a thing, as being utterly past cure and
remedy. Terent* in Andr. Actum est, si quidem haec vera praedicar. The matter
is utterly past cure and remedy, at least wise if it be true that she here
says* Read in Chiliad. Erasm.

48 Vt alia omittam, To let pass al other things or though I speak not of
other things. For Vt is here taken for qua^^is, or licet, Cic. in Oratore. Vt
quaeres omnia, quo modo Graeci ineptum appellant, non reperies. Though a man
seek throughout all words, yet he shall not find any that the Greeks have
counterua^^^ng this latin word Ineptus. i. in idoneus, unfit, unapt, or
vn^^ete to anything. Ide^ pro lego agraria. Vt circumspiciamus omnia, quae
populo grata, atque iucunda sunt, nil tam populare, quam pacem, qua^
concordia^, quam ocium reper^^mus: Though we consider al things that be
acceptable and pleasant unto the people, we shall find nothing so much to the
wealth or to the pay of the same as peace, as concord, or vn^^ye, and as
living in ease and quiet.

48 Pitissando modo mihi quid vini absumpsit? What or how much Wine has she
spent me, by nothing but sipping and tasting?

51 Releui dolia omnia, I have set abroch all the vessels in my house.

52 Omnes sollicitos habui. I had al my ^^^ny o^ household as busy as they
could be to serve. Sollicitos. i. varij officijs and ministeri^s distractos, vt
qui hinc and inde administrandum destinabantur, and assignabantur.

53 Quid te futurum censes, qnem assidue exede^t? What shall become of thee? or
what case shall thou be in (think thou) whom they shall continually eat out
of house and home.

54 Ita me dij amabunt, vt tuarum misertum est fortunarum, God love and help
me, as I have pity and compassion upon thy fortune or goods and sustance. For
that signifies Fortunae, narum. In the plural number, for the most part, and
that signification is most agreeable unto this place. Albeit, it is taken in
the other signification in Andria, where Simo says, Omnes omnia bona dicere
and laudare fortunas meas, qui filium haberem tali ingenio praeditum.

55 Faciat quod libet. Let him do what him lusts.

56 Sumat, consumat, perdat, decretum est pati, dum illum modo habeam mecu^,
Let him take, let him spend, or waste, let him destroy and cast away what he
well, I have determined with my self to abide and endure it, so that I may have
him at home in my house and company, Dum illum modo, for dum modo illum* etc.
by the figure y^ is called tinesis, or his diacope, which is when a word
either simple or compound, is divided, and one or two other words set
between, as Plin. Haec vt res cum que se habeat for vtcunque haec res, se
habeat. How soever this matter stands.

57 Si certum est tibi sic facere. If thou utterly appointed or determined so

Omnes. s. nos, where note one of the figures of gra^matical instruction, that
is called in Latin euocatio, which is as oftentimes as the third person is
immediately reduced unto the first person, or else to the second, as Ego pauper
laboro, cum tu dives ludas, I being poor do labor, whereas thou being rich
do play, Where note that in euocation be four things required.

First, Persona euocans, which is evermore the first or the second person,
secondarily persona euocato which is always the third peso^, thirdly that the
said third person be joined unto the first person or second as aforesaid,
immediately that is to say, no manner comunctio^ coming between. And fourthly
that the verb be of the first person or of the second, according evermore Cum
persona euocante, as in the example above alleged, evidently it appears. And
euocation is of two sorts, either explicita, as when both persona euocans and
also persona euocata, be expressly set out, or else implicita that is where
persona euocans is under stood, and not expressed, Virgil. Coram quem metitis,
adsum Troius Aeneas, I Aeneas of Troy, whom ye seek, am here in presence.

Oui. Penelope co^iux se^per Ulysses ero, Penelope will ever during my life, be
the wife of Ulysses only. In which both examples ego being persona eucans, is
not expressed but understood. Though Priscian think this oration of
Appolonius scribo, to be in congrue. Note further that in euocation, persona
euocans, and persona euocata.

Albeit, they be evermore of one case, yet sometimes they be of diverse
numbers, as when persona euocata lacks the singular member: as Ego tu
deliciae isthuc venia^. I thy golpolle, or* I thy delight and pleasure will
come hither where thou art: or else when persona euocata, is a noune collectiue,
that is to say, when it signifies plurality, or a multitude in the singular
number. Plin. in praefo. not. histo, Magna pars studiorum amoenitates
quaerimus. A great part of us seek delectable and pleasant studies. Also
when persona euocata is a noune distributive, Ovid. In magnis laesi rebus vter.
que sumus. We both offended, il served or violated in no small things* Terent
in Adelphis.

Curemus aequam Vterque partem, Let us care egally either for his own part:
where Nos vterque sumus, and nos vterque curemus be euocation.

75 Quodcunque inciderit in mentem, volet, Whatsoever shall fall in his mind,
or in his brain, he will desire needs to have it.

75 Neque id putauit prauumne an rectum sit ^ petet Nor he will not regard
this, whether it be ill or else good and honest y^ he shall desire.

77 Tu rem perire non poteris pati. Thou will never be able to abide to see thy

82 Somnum hercle hac nocte oculis no^ vidi meis, dum id quaero, tibi qui
filium restituerem. In faith I slept not one wink this night studying and
devising how I might get* bring home and restore thy son to thee again.
Qui id est, quomodo. Joan. Calphurnius notes here a proper difference between
redditur and restituitur, saying: Redditur quis cupientibus, vt domino, seruus,
restituitur cupiens, vt patriae ciuis? et redditur and restituitur cupiens
cupientibus, vt patri filius. And in these words. Oculis non vidi, is a
figure of speaking called pleonasmus, which is when an oration has any
superfluity of words more than needs, as Ver. Vocemque his auribus hausi, I
heard a voice with these ears. Id and sic ore locutus est. And thus she spoke
with her mouth. For we do not hear but with our ears, nor speak but with our
mouths, nor see but with our eyes.

agreed between our selves.

92 Paululum negotij mihi obstat, I have a little business that lets me.

neighbors, are at a little variaunce or controuersye about their lands. De
finibus. id est, de Limittibus of the bounds or marks where the grounds do
part and be divided the one man's land from the others.

94 Me coepere arbitrum, They have made me vmpier and judge between them,
coepere. i. facere. elegere arbiter (says Donatus) dabatur ijs qui de finibus
regendis ambigerent. Dicitur enim arbiter, iudex quod totius rei habeat
arbitrium and facultatem, an vmpier or stickler.

94 Ibo ac dicam operam me hodie non posse i^s dare. I will go and show them
that I cannot attend on them this day.

96 Continuo hic adero, I will be here again by and by.

95 Ita quaeso, So I pray you heartily.

96 Dij vostram fidem. O the faith of the Gods: Vostram for vestram per
antithesin. It is a manner of speaking used in Poets for an interie ctio^ of
maruayling, as Proh Deu^ atque hominum fidem, Proh sum Jupiter, with others
like.

97 Itane comparatam esse hominum natural omnium aliena melius vt videant and
iudicent quam sua? Is not thus true that it is naturally given unto all men, to
se further and better to judge in other men's matters the^ in there own? or* Is
this so that the nature of every man has this propertye that they can see,
or mark, and also judge other men's matters better then their own? Itane s.
verum est secundum Laur. Valla. And of such manner speakings by the Infinitive
mood absolutely put, it is in diverse places annoted before.

99 Eo fit, Thereby it happens or chances, or thereof it comes

99 In re nostrae gaudio sumus praepediti nimio, aut aegritudine. In the matter
of our own we be let, that is to say, blinded, that we cannot see or judge
by reason either of to much ioyfulnesse, or else of sorrow, woefulnes, and
disquiet of the mind. Praepediti. s. quo minus videro, and recta iudicare
valeamus*

101 Hic mihi quanto nunc rectius sapit, quam egomet mihi? How much wiser is he
now in this case for my behalf and profit, then I am for mine own.

102 Dissolui me ocyus operam tibi vt darem* I have dispatched my self

In the second Scene.
1 Hac illac circum cursa, Run about this way and that way.

1 Inueniendum est argentem, I must find out, or get a sum of money.

2 Intendend a in senem fallacia* s* est. I must find some wyle to deceive the
old man*

It is a metaphore taken often he stretching of the senewes, or of stringes in a
bow or lute, or other instrument. For Inte^do, dis inte^di, intentu^ is to
stretch, or to re^ch, as a man does stretch the string of a bow, or of a Lute.
And therefore by translation it is said in latin intendere vocem, to strain
the voice, that is, to speak as loud as a man may reach, and intentio vocis,
is to strain the voice. Intendere animum aut ingenium, or intendere neruos
animi vel ingenij* is to strain the mind or wit, that is to give very exact
advertisement of the raynd^, or of the wit, and to prove the same to the
uttermost. So intende^da in sene^ fallacia, is as much as if he should have
said in English* I must strain a sinew or stretch a vayn, to beguile the
oldman. Of Intendo read in Laur. val. lib. 6. eleg cap. 4.

3 Nu^ me fefellit hosce id struere? was I deceived when I said that these
fellows went about such a thing* Here is also a metaphore taken of builders.
For struo, struis struxi, structu^, is to build or to make a frame: and thereof
by translation struere ignem, is to make a fire, struere fallaciam, to imagine
a wile. Struere milite^ apud Titum Liuium, to set soldiers in array, for
iustruere etc.

4 Est ille tardiusculus, He is somewhat slow.

5 Hule nostro tradidia est prouintia the matter is committed unto this fellow
of mine, or to my man here to do. The Romans of old time called in latin
prouinciam any out region of far country that they had subdued unto their
dominion, empire, and jurisdiction, and held y^ same their jurisdiction by a
liuetenant, sent thither to govern and rule it. And because that those persons
which were admitted and sent by the Romans thither as officers, and with
commission, and with great charge, therefore the very office it self of ruling
in any proui^ce was also called in Latin prouincia, and thereof by a Metaphore
all the burden, labor or business of doing in any manner office, or thing to
be done is called in Latin speaking prouincia, as here. And also in
Phormione. O Geta pro uinciam dura^, O Geta thou have taken in hand, or take
upon thee a great, or hard matter to do. etc.

6 perij, Numnam haec audiuit? Alas that ever I was borne has he heard all this?

7 Quid tu isthi^, s* agis? What make thou there? or what do thou there?
Note here the difference between these three pronounes, hic, iste, and ille
with their aduerbes deryued of the^, hic haec, hoc, hic, hinc, hanc, hanc,
horsum, With all other deriuatiues and compounds of the same, as hiccine. etc.
in Latin speaking be preferred unto the first person that is to say* unto the
speaker, iste, ista. istud, istic, istinc, istuc, isto, istorsum istac, etc.
Be referred unto the second person, that is to the party that the speaker
speaks unto. Ille, la, lud, illic, illinc, illac, illuc, illorsum illo, Be
referred unto thee third person, that is neither unto the speaker, nor unto
him that he speaks unto, but to the third from them both, as I writing from
London to my friend being in Oxeforde, that we might meet for to ride
together unto York, may write thus unto him. Iampride^ istuc profectus essem,
nisi me hic occupationes me detinerent. Tu igitur mature istinc te mouere atque
huc primo quoque tempore aduolare quo possimus vua illo, quo decreuimus
proficisci, I had a great while since commen thither (that is to Oxford where
thou art) but that certain busyness that I have, keep and withhold me, here
in London. Therefore hye thou, and spedely bestir thee to come away from
thence, that is from Oxeford aforesaid, and in all have possible to come hither
to London, to the end that we may both together take our journey thither as we
appointed, that is to York.

7 Equidem te demiror tam mane, s. surrexisse, aut foris in publico conspici
qui heri tantum biberis, I marvel greatly that thou art up, or that thou
come abroad so earlye to day, which drankest so much or so deeply yesterday.

9 Visa est, quod dici solet, aquilae senectus, Me thought I saw an old Aegle
(as the proverb says) A quilae senectus, the old age of an Aegle is a Latin
proverb used to be spoken of old men, or others that live more by drink
then by meat, Plin. li. 10. na. hist. cap. 3. of the nature of Egles shows
that Egles dye, or perish neither for age, nor by reason of any sickness, but
for hunger and lack of meat. For the upper part of their bills or nebbes
grows so much and so far over the nether part, that the aduncitye or
crokednes thereof may not be opened, nor may not gap^ to receive sustena^ce of
meat so that when they be old, they live only by drink, and by suckynge the
blood of such prays as they have killed, and not by catyng. And semblably
aged folks for the most part^ drink more then they eat.

10 Mulier commoda and face^a haec est This woman is a gentle companion, or a
good fellow, and a pleasant, or merry one.

12* Mulier forma luculenta, A very fair or beautiful woman, Luculentia, i.

13 Mulier forma sane bona, A woman a^^uredly right well favored.

14 Ille hanc deperit He is very far in love with her, or, he is nighe mad
for the love of her. For that is properly Deperire in Latin.

15 Habet patrem quendam auidum, miserum* a^que aridum, He has to his father
a certain fellow greedy of money, a wretched fellow in his house, and a very
pinch penye, as dry as a kixe.

16* Atque (...) is non diuitijs abu^det, gnatus eius profugi^ inopia. His

at all, nor were worth a penny.

19 Homo pistrino dignus, A fellow worthy of extreme punishment.

20 Tibi timui male, I was curstly or shrewdlye afeard on thy behalf. Caueo
with Accusative ^s to avoid and eschew, as Caueo te, I eschew thee or thy
company, Caueo tibi with a dative, Idem quod prospicio, I am ware and provide
that thou have no harm.

21 Passus est id fieri. He suffers that to be done.

25 Garris, i. inepte loqueris, Nugas loqueris, thou ^anglest, thou pratest,
thou speak folishly.

25 Haec facta ab illo opportebant, Thus ought he to have done. Uerbes
Impersonalles, as Decet, delectat, portet, iuuat, with others like be sometimes
changed into personalles especially in Poets.

26 Eho quae so laudas qui heroes fallunt? Ah sir, or what I pray the heartily
do thou allow and commend such as deceive their masters? Eho sometimes is an
interiection of maruaylinge* sometimes of calling unto a body, as Ehodum ad

Wherefore they err and do amiss, that take and use the said aduerbes for

Be construed with an accusative and a genitive: as Paeniter me dicti, I
forethinke or repent my saying- Taedet me vitae, I am weary of my life. Piget me
laboris, I am ^oth or unlusty to labor: In the stead of the genitive they may
have joined with them an infinitive mode: as Paenitet me dixisse. Taedet me
viuere, piget me laborare. Piget me, here in this place of Terence, is taken
for Dolet mihi vel molestu^ est* Of the signification of piget, read more
largely in Adelphis act. 3. seen 4. in the vulgar, Fratris me quidem pudet
pigetque,

15 Ne ineptus, ne proteruus videar. That I seem not foolish, nor saucy, or

22 Hic prius se indicarit, quam ego argentum effero, This fellow will surely
betray his own counsel before that I get any money at al. Indicarit pro
indicauerit, per syncopen. And it is as Donatus expounds, the future of the
subiunctiue, set for the future of the indicative. After some Grammarians it is
Modus promissinus. The mode or manner of promising, that a thing shall be,
Pomponiua calls it Futurum exactum, which the Greeks expound by the
participle of y^ preter perfect tense, joined with the future tense of the
verb substan^^ue, esoma:. And the Latyne men in verbes deponentes, as Ero
locurus. And Linacre in his first book De emendata structura, or, De octo
partibus. Makes mention, that Gro^inus, which undoubtedly, was a man of most
exquisite, exact, and pre^yse, both of knowledge and judgment, as well in
Gramma^cat things, as also in all other kinds and sorts of learning divided
the times of verbes in this wise, that he put in the verb three tenses, that
is to weete, the present tense, the pretertense, and the future tense* And
every of these he put to be of two sorts, that is to weete, the one imperfect
and the other perfect. The present tense imperfect* as Scribo, I write, or I am
in writing, so that the action of writing is not yet accomplished nor finished
The present tense perfect, as Scripfi, I have written, or I have done writing,
so that the said action of writing is finished and done. And in like wise the
preter tense imperfect, as Scribebam, I did write, or I was in writing, the
action or doing thereof not yet past. The pretertense perfice, as Scripseram, I
had written, or I had done, or ended wrytinge. Also the Future tense imperfect,
as Scribam, I will, or shall write the action of writing not yet begun. The
future tense perfect, as Scripsero, I shall have written, or I shall have done
writing the action of writing already begun and entered, but yet not ended.

23 Vin* tu homini stulto mihi auscultare? Wylt thou be ruled by the counsel of
me a foolish fellow? Vin', pro vis ne.

23 Iube hunc abire hiuc aliquo, Bid or commau^d this fellow here to go or to
get him from hence some whither

24 Quo ego hinc abeam? Whither should I go from hence? Abeam id est abire
debea^. for it is the potentiall mode, which may always be expounded by possum
or debeo, or some like verb But of the potentiall mode, and of the use of the
same in all tenses read example in Lina cre, in his first book, De emendata
structura, sieve de octo partibus,

24 Abi quo lubet, Go whither thou lusts.

25 Abi deambulatum, Go thy way to walk, deambulatum, The first supine which
is used always in the active signification, and is englished like the
Infinityue Mode of the Active voice. And whenever the English of the
Infinitive of the active voice, comes after any verb or other word,
betokenning going or moving to a place, it shall be put in the first supyne

27 Tu tibi istas posthac comprimito manus. Hold in, keep down, or tame thou
those hands of thine from henceforth. Comprimitio is y^ imperative mode, and
the present tense. For Linacre in the first book. De emen^struct. Uerye well
pours that the imperative mode has no future tense. First for that the
Greeks has no future tense in this mode. seco^darily, for the voices of the
Imparatiue mode endinge in to, tote, and tor, may be joined with aduerbes of
the future time. Thirdly, for that the same vosces in to, tote, tor, been
founded joined with other voices of the same imperative mode, which all
Grammarians confess and say to be of the present time, as Propertius. Aut si
es dura, nega, sin es non dura, venito. Verg. Tytere dum redeo breuis est via,

2 Tanta laetitia oborta est. s. mihi. So great joy and gladness is chanced,
or come unto me

3 Dedo patri me nu^c, vt frugalior sim quam vult* I yield my self now unto my
father, or I put my self now in my fathers hands to be more honest man, and
of better rule then he would have me to be. Frugalior is the comparatiue, and
Frugalissimus, the superlatiue of Frugi, and not frugalis, which is no pure,
good nor, usual la^^ word as may be taken of Quintilian. li. i. instit orat.
But in the styde or place of Frugalis, the Latin authors use Frugi, of all
genders, and vndeclyned, and Frugi properly signifies him that is temperate
and measurable in his diete, or manner of living of his body and sometimes in
apparayle and other semblable things, as in plain contrary signification
luxuriosus, is used apud Senecam, who says Luxurioso frugalitas poena est.
Unto a riotous person sober living or good rule is a great pain. And apud
quinti. who has a declaration de duobu^ filiis, frugi, luxuriosoque of two
sons the one sober and of good rule in living, and the other riotious and of
ill rule. Frugalitas in greek is called sophrosini, and frugi homines be
called in greek chrisimoi that is vtiles, sobrij, and necessarij. Profitable,
sobre, and necessary. Cicero. li. 3. Tus. quaest. Of the signification of these
two words frugalitas, and frugi says thus: Sed quia nec qui propter metum
presidiu^ relinque, quod est ignauiae, nec qui propter auaritiam clam depositum
non reddit, quod est iniustitiae: nec qui propter temeritatem male re^ gessit,
quod est stultitiae frugi appellari solet, eas tres virtutes, fortitudinem
iustitiam, and prudentiam, frugalitas co^plexa est ergo frugi hominem bonum, et
virtute praeditu^ intelligimus, Cuius co^trarium est neque, cuius significatio
vna est, quod sit libidinis intemperans, altera, quod ad nihil bonus sit, sed
plane malus. But for because that neither he, which for fear forsakes his
garrison, which to do is a point of dastardness or cowardnesse, nor he that
for avarice or courtous desire and love of goods, money or any other thing,
being ^riuelye and without any witness present, put and laid in his custody
to keep, does not restore, but withhold, when it is required and asked again,
which is untrue and unrighteous dealing, neither he that for temerity or
wilful rashenesse and lack of discretion, has had evil luck and
misadue^ture or misfortune in his matters or affairs (specially in battle)
which is a token and the property of foolishness, because that no such person
is commonly or usually called in latin frugi. Therefore this latin word
frugalitas, in signification conteyneth and betokens as much as all these
three virtues: that is to weete, hardynesse, righteousness, or true and
upright dealing, and also prudence or much knowledge and experience of things.
So it follows, that when we say in latin Frugi homo we understand thereby a
good and honest man, and endued with manhood and virtue. And the contrary of
the same latin word frugi, is nequa^, the which word nequam has two
significations, in the one signification it i^ a man that is leacherouse, and
of misseliuing of his body. In the other signification Nequam is he that is
good for nothing, but even a very naughty unthrift. Columelli eiusdem
agilitatis, homo frugi, melius quam nequam faciet. If there be two me^ of
semblable and equal^ agility or wildynesse and be sturting of themselves, an
honest fellow shall do any thing that he is set unto, better then shall an
unthrifty fellow or a naughty pack.

^ Ita me dij ament, vt ego nu^c non tam meapte causa laetor, quam huius. God
so love or help me, As I am glad and rejoice now, not so greatly for mine
own cause, as for his here.

9 Eum ego scio esse quouis honor dignum. I know that he is worthy to be
had in all honor and price.

means thou take away again all hope of marriage.

37 Tu fortasse quid me fiat paruipendis, dum illi consulas, Thou percase do

Menedemi vicem miseret me, I have pity on the ill chance of Menedemus. We say
in ye singular number vicem, and vice, and no more: in the plural number it
has al cases. Some gra^. marians derive and form vices of the word vi, which
in old time was much taken and yet is Pro pugnis, for fighting: as when we
said in latin. Vim mihi intulit, He laid violent hands on me, and fought with
me, Vim sibi intulit, He kilde himself. In the same signification is vices
used in Plautus, where he says: Vices eius memorat, and cicatrices denudat.
He tells of the battles that he has foughten, and discovers or shows
open the scarres or printe of the wounds that he had. Sometimes vices is taken
Pro paenis, and incommodis, for punishment and mischaunces, displeasures, or
adversity Hora. li. i. carm. Vicesque superbae te manea^t ipsum. Sometimes Pro
periculo, for danger and ieopardy. Ver. Nec tela, nec vllas vitauisse vices
Danau^. Sometimes Pro loco, for the plate or steed Horat. V^ar vice cotis,
acutum reddere quae ferrum valet excors ipsa secandi I will be in steed of a
Whetstone, which has power to make knives sharp, and yet it self has no such
property, that it can cut, Laur. valla in annotac. contra. Ra. Touches the
difference between Dolere alicuius casum, and Dolere vicem.

2 Miseret me, tantum deuenisse ad eum mali, It pittieth me, y^ so great a
misfortune has chanced unto him.

3 Ita magno desiderio fuit ei filius. He has lo^ged so greatly for his soon.
Desidero, ras, raui* is to long for, and thereof comes desiderium.

4 Hosce aliquot dies non sentiet. For these few days he shall not feel it.

6 Verum vbi videbit ta^tos sibi sumptus domi cotidianos fieri, nec fieri
modu^, optabi^. rursum, vt abeat ab se filius, But when he shall perceive that
he shall be daily at so great charges, and therein like to be no measure nor
end, he will wish that his sone were gone from him again Antonius Nebr. In
that his book, which he entitled Lexicon iuris ciuilis, shows and proves
that Cotidie and cotidianus should be written with c. and not with q. Ab in
appositio^ is read, not only set before words beginning with vowels, but also
with words beginning with almost al co^sonants: apud Platum. Terentium,
Liuium, and others plainly appears.

8 Sirum optime eccum. Lo here is Syrus meruaylous well, or as well as can be.

12 Dictum ac factum reddidi. I dispatched it with a word, or in the turning
of an hand (as who should say) I did no rather move the matter nor speak of
it, but it was done by and by, Albeit. Eras. in chil. Interprets and
expounds this proverb to signify all manner diligence and labor necessary
to the doing or bringinge to pass of any thing. For he says that dictum ac
factum is a prouerbiall speaking, by which is signified, that we have not
omitted or let pass any thing belonging to the furtherance or perfourmaunce of
any matter or business. And his example he brings in this place of Terence
which in y^ scene may be englished thus: I have done as much as is possible, or
as may be do^e in y^ matter. Donatus says, Dictu^ ac factu^ to be a prouerbial
speaki^g, betokni^g celeriti and speed in doing or dispatching of a thing.
Terent. in An. act. 2. sc. Haec sola est mulier, Dictum a^ factum, inuenerit
aliquis causam, quamobrem eijciat oppid^, This Glicery is alone woman. Some
will not fail, hut at once with ye turning of an hand, to find some quarrel or
other to drive hi^ out of the town. And in the first scene of the fifth act, in
the same comody. Dictum factum huc abi^t Clitipho, and by and by comes
thither Clitipho.

13 Bona ne fide? s. fecisti. Did thou it faithfully* substantially,
trustely, or earnestly?

13 Non possum pati, quin caput tibi demulcean I cannot forbear, but I must
needs stroke thy head. The self same thing may besayd also by facere thus.
Non possum facere quin caput tibi demulceam, And without either of both thus.
Non possum quin caput* demulcea^. Faciam boni tibi aliquid pro ista ac lubens.
I will do thee some good turn for this that thou have done, and that with all
my heart.

aduerbes of confirming and auouching.

places of Titus Liuius, and namely inthe concions of Cato and Lucius Valerius.

should feign, show a countenance, or make as though thou would give it

therewith. Aequi bonique facere, aequi boni que consulere, aequi consulere, and

2 Vel haec deambulatio quam non laboriosa, m^ ad languorem dedit. Even the
same little walking being nothing paynefull, or being a things of no labor, yet
has made me all weary an^ faint. Vel, in this place, is not a conjunction

mihi semper agebat gratias. Even the King him self did ever give me thanks.

4 Nec quicquam magis nu^c metuo, quam ne denuo miser aliquo extrudat hinc. And

by translation it is taken for any gi^^ of nature or otherwise: as prudence
justice, and fortitude, with other virtues be called Dote animi: beauty,
strength stature, be Dotes corporis: dotes ingenij etc. Of talentu^ it is
shewe^ before. Note that here is set haec for hae plurally, and the neuter
gender for the feminine* For next before went alterae december minae. S^ Tere^ce

Out of the fifte act in the first Scene.
1 Ego me non tam astutum, neque ita perspicacem esse scio, I know my self not
to be so crafty or wily, ne so quick in perceiving or espying of things.

Hic adiutor men's, and monitor, and praemonstrator, hoc mihi praestat. This
mine helper and counsayler, and leader, or pointer of the way is above me or
better then I in this poinet,

Praemonstrator, toris, is he that goes before a man to guide him, and to
show him the way, and as who should say to lead him by the hand. In me quiduis
harum rerum co^uenit, quae sunt dicta in stultum, caudex, stipes, asinus*
plu^beus, All those things may well be said unto me, that be commonly said
against a fool as to be called a block or a stumpe, a stock, an ass, an
heavy head, as who should say, I may well be called a block, a stock, an
ass, a du^head, with all other such names, as be given to foolish and dull
fellows, in despite or in derision. Caudex, is the foot and lowest part of
the stock of a treenext unto the roots: Sripes, stipiris, is a logge, that is
set fast in the ground. Plu^bum, by, is Latin for lead: whereof plumbus. bea,
beum, a thing made of the mettell of lead, and by translation a man, or any
other thing of the property and condition of lead, that is to wit, heavy,
blunt, and dull, whereof is taken a latin proverb.: Plumbeo iugulare gladio,
to cut ones throat with a fworde of lead, that is to say, to go about and to
labor to overcome and convince a man with a vain light, and slender reason or
argument. The prourbe Cicero* does use.

5 In illum nil potest. s. dici. Nothing can be say^ against him.

5 Exuperat eius stultitia haec omnia, The folishnes of him passes all this.

^ Desine deos gratulando obtundere. Leave o^ forbear to dull the Gods with
gieuing tha^ke^ to them for thy good chance or fortune. Gratulor, laris, has
two significations, the one i^ to make joy and to say or to testify in words
that thou art glad of the good fortune or happy chance, either of any other
man, or else o^ thine own self. And in this signification Gratulor will have
after him a d^tiue case of the party, for whose cause such ioying or
testification of gladness is made, whether it be thy sel^ or else any other body,
as Gratulor tibi, quo^ tam gratiosus sis apud principem. I am gla^ that you be
in such high favor with your^ prince. Gratulor mihi, cui hoc saeculo tam
literato nasci contigerit, I am glad on mine own^ behalf, that it was my
chance to be borne (...) this time, when letters so well flourished. Where
note, that Gratulor besides the said datiu^ case, may have after him also, of
the thing tha^ you allege, wherefore you say that you be^ glad, an accusative
without a preposition, or a^ accusative with the preposition ob, or else a^
ablative with the preposition de: as, I am gla^ that you have that office:
Gratulor tibi istum magistratum, or Gratulor tibi ob istum magistratum, or else
Gratulor tibi de isto magistratu^* So Gratulor tibi nouum istum honorem, o^ ob
nouum istum honorem, or de nouo isto honor. I am glad on your behalf, of this
your new promotion: Albeit that Poets sometimes leave out the dative case,
especially when it is a pronounce: ^uid. in epist Gratulor Occhalian^^itulis
accedere nostris, where the dative is understood, which may be tibi, mihi, or
nobis, ego me nunc denique natum Gratulor: Where is understood mihi.
Sometimes also in Orators, the dative is not expressed, but omitted and
understood. Quin. in pasccadauer. Gratulemur iam, quod nulla ciuitas fame
laboret: Where is understood nobis.

And by reason of such omission of the dative case, some Grammarians have
thought Gratulari idem esse quod gaudere. To joy to rejoice or to be glad,
alleging for their authority, the examples about written: but Lau. Valli. 5.
ele. cap. 42. does not allow them, well considering, that gratulatio^ may be,
where not only no joy or gladness is, but also entter and hearty sorrow, as a
man may say or testify, that he is glad of the promotion of an other man,
(which is in latin Gratulari alicui noua^ dignitatem) and yet in his heart be
right sorry for the same. Gratulor, is ^lso taken sometime for gratias agere, to
give thanks, but that is in manner never, but the Gods immortal. So that in
this signification it is the same that supplicare, to pray and to do our
devotions to the Gods. Tit. Li. Triumphantes in capitoliu^ ascendent. Ioui
optimo Maxim, caeterisque dij^ gratulatum. Such persons as triumphed in old
time in that city of Rome, used to ascend or go up into the Capitol castle
or tower of that city, to gieue devout thanks, unto the most good* and most
mighty Jupiter, and unto the other Gods. So that Gratulari deo and superi^, is
to give devout thanks unto God, and to his saynctes, for any benefit,
felicitye, or happy chance received. And so is gratulando, taken here in this
place of Terence, and there is understood eis nempe dijs.

7 Desine obtundere, nisi illos ex tuo ingenio iudicas, vt nihil credas
intelligere, nisi idem dictu^ est centies. Leave dulling them, except thou
esteem and judge them of thine own property, that is, that thou thynkest
them to perceive or understand nothing, but if the same have been spoken*
repeted, or rehearsed an hundred times.

13 Quid risisti? Wherefore did thou laughe?

13 Serui venere in mentem Syri calliditates, I remembered, or I thought upon
the subtle or wily devises of my servant Syrus.

14 Itane? Yea in deed?

14 Vultus quoque hominum singit seelus. The ungracious harlot can fashion or
transpose also the countenaunces and looks of men. Scelus for scelestus per
emphasin, aut potius auxe^in, as I showed before. I. Riuius in his castigations
upon Terent notes these words in this place, and expounds the same in such
wise, yt he takes the sense and meaning of them to be this, Vultus quoque
hominu^ fingit scelus, the vngrations fellow can also transpose or fashion the
cou^tenances of men (that is) can make or cause men to look and to have such
cou^tenances as him lists, meaning by Syrus, that he had in such wise taught
and enstructed Clinia, that he could fashion his look and countenance at his
pleasure, and counterfeite any fashion of countenance that he would himself.
And in this sense. it best agrees with the words next following, which been
these. Gratus quod se adsimulat laetum, id dicis? That my son makes a
countenance as he were glad, speak you of that? And fingere vultum, in the
self same sense uses Caesar. si. 1. bell. Gal. where he says thus. Hi neque
vultum fingere, neque interdum lachrymas tenere poterant. These men could
nether feign or make a good countenance, nor yet sometimes hold or forbear
weping (as who should say) they could not hide nor disse^ble their fear, but
that there appeared in their faces and countena^ces evident notes and tokens,
that in their minds and hearts they wersore troubled and vexed and afeard of
punishment. And of the same comes a prouerbial speaking. Fortunam sibi
quisque fingit, Every man makes (as who should say) as causer of his own
fortune, be it good or bad, as who should say, they that be good or virtuous
or learned, or have any honest craft or occupation, shall have good fortune,
and shall be sustained thereby and live well, and contrariwyse, they y^ be idle
fellows, nor have any learning, nor occupation, but be flagitious and full
of mischyefe, shall not live well, but in misery, whereof they may always
thank them selves as causers of their own fortune.

16 Idem isthuc mihi venit in mente^. I remembered or thought upon, even that
self same thing.

17 Magis, si magis noris, putes ita rem esse, Thou would much more think
it to be so, if thou did better know the matter.

17 Ain'tu, Say thou so?

17 Hoc prius scire expeto, This I desire to know first.

23 Mira narras, thou tellest a marvelous tale. Mira, the accusative plural,
neuter gender, put substantiuely.

28 Quid est, quod amplius simuletur? What is there that is feigned more then
this?

29 Est mihi retro vltimis in aedibus co^claue quoddam I have a certain
parlour behind or in the back side in the furmost part of all my house.

30 Lectus vestimentis stratus est, There be clothes laid upon the bed.

31 Quid postquam hoc est factum? What, when was that done? what was next?

32 Hue abijt Clitipho, Bacchis consecuta est illico, Thither goes Clitipho,
and after goes Bacchis at the hard heels of him. Confequi is to follow, as we
use to say in english cheek by cheek, or at the hard heels. etc.

33 Vbi abiere intro, operuere ostium, As soon as they were gotten in, they
closed or shut to the door.

34 Clinia haec fieri videbat? Did Clinia see all this done?

34 Quid ni? mecum vna simul? What else, even together with me? Quid ni s^
viderit vna simul. It is the figure Pleonasmus, of which is showed before.

39 December dieru^ vix mihi est familia, My householde may scarsely endure or
hold ten days longer (as who should say) I shall not be able to continue
housholdyng or keepinge of an house ten days longer.

37 Ille operam amico dat suo, He attends upon his friend.

38 An dubium.i. tibi? Have thou any doubt of that.

39 Quenquam animo tam comi esse aut leni putas? Think thou any man to be of
so familiar or so gentle an heart? Hic haec comis and hoc come is he that is
gentle and familiar and nothing statelyke, or high minded or strange. Hic haec
lenis and hoc lene, is he that is not rough or sharp nor sone moved to anger:
but is gentle and sone contented or pleased, and is full of sufferance.

41 Quo verba facilius dentur mihi, That I may the sooner be deceived.

42 Merito mihi nuuc ego succenseo, I am angry with my self now, not without a
cause.

43 Quot res dedere, vbi possim praesentisce^e, nsi essem lapis, How many
things have they done, whereby I might have perceived it if I had not been a
very stone.

45 An ne illud multum ferent, Shall they escape with it unpunished?

46 Non tu te cohibes? Will thou not refray^^ or keep thy self in?

46 Non tu te respicis? Do thou nothing rega^^ thy self?

47 Non ego tibi exempli satis sum. Am not I e^ample good enough for thee?

47 Praei^acundia non sum apud me, I am out^ my wit for anger.

48 Tene isthuc loqui? s. decet, conuenit, vel opo^^et, Such a word to come out
of thy mouth, b^comes it thee to speak this?

49 Non id flagitium est te alijs consilium dar^ foris sapere tibi non posse
auxiliarier? Is (...) this a very naughty thing, that thou can g^^ counsel
unto others, and to be wise in oth^^ men's matters, and not to be able to
help, (...) ease thine own self?

52 Fac te esse patrem sentiat, So do that he man perceive and feel thee to be
his father.

52 Fac vt audeat tibi credere omnia, So do th^^ he may commit and show unto
thee all thing Credere alicui in this signification is to commit unto any
man all secrets, and to keep n^ hyde nothing from him.

54 Fac nequam aliam quaerat copiam, So do th^^ he may not seek for any other
help.

54 Fac ^e ^e deserat, So do that he may not for sake thee.

55 Imo abeat potius multo quouis gentium (...) hic per flagitium ad innopiam
redigat patrem. Nay mary let him go from hence to the world end, much rather
then he should here thron^^ his mischief and ungracious fashion of living
undo his father, and bring him to pouertye, and need, or beggary: of this word
Gentium, how it is added unto diverse aduerbes. it is largely declared before.

57 Si illi pergam suppeditare sumptus, mihi illaec vere ad rastros res rediet.
If I should give him as much money as he would spend, that would surely bring
me to the take and the ^pade* as who should say, it would undo me and make me a
very beggar in decde, and it is elegantlye said in latin. Res mihi ad rastros
redit, I must be feign to take a rake and a spade in my hand (as who should
say) to dig and to delue for my living. Suppeditare illi sumptibus. May
other wise be said in Latin Suppeditare illi sumptus: and this latter is more
used.

59 Quot incommoditates in hac re accipies nisi caves? How many incommodityes
or displeasures shall thou have in this thing except thou beware or take heed?
albeit Iho Riuius in his castigations reads, Quot incommoda tib^ in hac re
capies. etc.

60 Difficilem ostendis te esse, ignosces tum post. Thou show thy self
hard, sore, or heavy toward him yet thou will forgeeue or pardon him at
last. Post, i. post a and it is here an Aduerbe and not a preposition for it
governs no case, whereof also it is annoted before.

61 Nes^ is quam doleam, Thou know not how sorry I am.

6^ Quid obticuisti? Why do not thou speak? Of the propre signification of
Obticio: it (...) showed before.

65 Ita dico, So I say,

65 Ne quid vereare, Be not affrayde or fear, nothing

66 Nil dos nos moue^, We care nothing for any money to her marriage.

67 Duo Talenta pro te nostra*ego esse decreuisatis. I have determined or
judged that one hundredth pounds is enoughe for one of my substance.

68 Ita* dictu opus est, si me vi^ saluum esse and ^em, and filium, Thou must
needs so say, if thou will have my life saved, and my goods and my son. Here
is the figure of constructio^ called Zeugma which is when a verb or an
adjective is reduced and referred into diverse nominative c^^^s or substantives,
that is to weete, unto the nominative or substanstiue that is next unto it
expressly and unto a^ the other by understanding or re^etinge: Ego and tu
viuis, I and thou live where viuis is reduced and ref^rred unto two^ nominative
case, that is to weete ego, and ^u* And with the next that is ^^, It accords
in number and person expressly, and with the further that is ego, by
understanding, Ego. s. viuo and tu viuis, So caeli mouendi, sunt and terra.
Where mouendi and sunt* according with the next, that is coeli expresselye that
is to say, the verb in number and person, and the ade^^ctiue in case,
gender, and number. And with the further terra, they ^oth according not, but
by understanding thus, Coeli mouendi sunt, and ter ra. s. mouenda est. So ^ir.
Hic illius arma, hic currus fuit, where the sense and oration is thus to be
made perfect. Hic illius arma* s* fueru^t. Hic currus fuit. etc. Again, Ego. s.
vxor mea est docta. The perfect speaking is this, Ego sum doc tus and vxor mea
est docta, or else, Ego sum doctus, and vxor. s. est docta. Yet this
notwithstanding if there be any comparison, the verb or the adjective may
accord with the further. As in example we say not. Ego melius quam t^ scribis,
but Ego melius quam to scribo, I write better the^ thou Likewise if there be
any stmilitude, the veth or adjective shall accord with the further nominative
or substantive: as Ego sicus tu sentio, and not Ego sicut tu sentis, I think
as thou do, or I am of the mind that thou art, And in the Psalm Ego ^icu^
foenu^ arui, and not ego sicut foenum aruit, also by the conjunction nisi, thus
Talem filiu^ nulla nisi tu pareret, and not pareres, but by understanding. And
here note, that zeugma, may be three manner ways. First in person, as Ego and
tu viuis: Secondarily in gender, as Rex and regina est irata: Thirdly in
number, as Ci^, Nihil te hic munitissimus habendi sena^us locus, nihil borum
ora, vultusque mouerunt? Has this most strong place, that the parliament is
kept in, and the faces or countenau^ces or looks of these men, being present
and beholding thee, moved thee nothing at all? Note further, that there be
three kinds of zeugma, One called in greek prorozeugma, y^ is, when the verb
or the adjective is set in the begi^nig^ as Dormio ego and tu. An other is
called Meso* zeugma, which is when the verb or the adjective is set in the
midst: as Ego dormio and tu. The third is called Hipozeugma* and that is
where the verb is put in the end: as Ego and (...) dormis. But when a verb or
adjective is reduced unto diverse nominative cases or substantives and agrees
with them both, the Grammarians call it Zeugma locutionis of speaking non
constructionis, and not of construction. (...) in the example of Cicero before,
Nihil horum o*ra vultusque moueru^t, again Ioannes est eruditus and Petrus.
zeugma requires four things: First diverse substantives, as Rex and regina^
Secondarily a conjunction as, and. Thirdly ^ verb or an adjective, as irata
est. Fourthly y^ the same verb or adjective do agree expressly with the next
nominative or substa^tiue, as Rex and regina est irata. where note that the
conjunction may be either a contunctiue, a dis^unc^^^ or e^s an expletiue, it
may be also an aduerbe i^ steed of a co^^unction as Cubas vbi ego, Thou lie
where I do. Coenas quando nos, Thou suppest wha^ we do. Haec fere de zeugma^e.
Ge^ rardus Lystrius. Id mirari te simulato, and illum ^ogato simul quamobre^ id
facia^. Make as though thou did marvel thereat, and together there withal
demand of him, wherefore I do it.

71 Ego vero, quam obrem id facias nescio, And i^ deed to, I know not
wherefore thou do^^ it.

^^ Ego id facio, vt eius animum qui nunc luxuria and lasciuia diffluit,
retu^dam, I do it that I may clean dash his heart or mind* which now runs at
rouers in riot and wanto^nes. Diffluere properly is to runke abroad in diverse
places as water does, and by translation it is to be ^iotous and wild,
running* at large, nothing regarding himself Semblably retundere properly is
to make dull, or blu^t as in a knife, when the point or edge of it is turned.
And the same by translation is to abate, to bring down, and (as we use much to
say now) to dash, to bla^ke and to appaule* Luxuria, ^iae, and luxus, xus. xui
is taken for riot, and not for lechery. Libido. dinis, is latin for lechery,
and lasciuia pertayneth to the same. For lasci^us properly is he that is
lecherous both in liui^g and also in words Ex Lau. Val.

73 Redigam eum, vt quo se vortat, nesciat, I will bring him to that point,
that he shall not wot whether to turn him. A child may marneyle why Terence
says not nesciet, rather the^ nesciat, seeing that our manner of speaking in
English so sounds, as though it should be the future tence of the
indicative mode. But it is to be noted, that this particle vt, is never joined
with verbes of the indicative mood. For Vt nesciet in this manner speaking, is
the same that barbarous. ru^e, and vn^carned persons say thus quod nesciet. But
ye latin phrase is otherwise. Therefore in this manner speaking with others like
it is necessary to put the present tence of y^ subiunctiue mode in stead of the
future of the indicative mode. And this is also noted in the little Book, De
corrupti sermonis emendatione. And this example of Terence is ther^ brought in*
Quo (...) vertat* id est* Quo ^e vertere debeat, I^ is the potentiall mode.

74 Mitte me, Let me go, or let me alone.

74 Sine me, in hac ^e gerere mihi morem. Suffe^ me in this thing to follow
mine own appetit, or to have mine own mind and pleasure

75 Ita ne vi^? Will thou so? Or, is that the wind?

76 Vxorem accersat, Let him send for hy^ wife.

76 Dictis confutabitur, He shall be convinced o^ blanked with words or
reasons. Confutot^s, is to avoid a man in such wife, that he can nothing more
allege nor say for himself.

77 Eum si viuo, adeo exornatum dabo, adeo d^pexu^, vt dum viuat, meminerit
semper mei. I^ I live, I will so beray him, and so deck or t^^^ him yt as long
as he lives he shall ever remember me, or think on me. Depexus, xa, xu^,
comes of depecto, which is diligenter pecto, t^ kemb dili^e^tly* ^uid l. 3.
fast. Interea liber d^ pexos crinibus in dos Vicit* and Eoo dives ad o^ be
venit* Per metaphoram, vel potius ironia^ It is taken and used in the ill part.
So that d^pexus* which is properly well kembed, and h^uing a bush well decked*
is taken for the co^tr^ry that is ill arayde and ill handled.

79 Sibi me pro ridiculo, ac delectamen to putat, He reputeth me as his
laughing stock, and as one to make him sport and pastime,

80 No^ and cret haec facere viduae mulieri, quae in me fecit, He durst not
have done unto a widow or alone woman, that he has done against me. Vidua,
du^, Is a lone woman and a Wydow, whose husband is deceased: and because women
(especially such as have no husband to help and defend them from injuries and
wrongs) for the most part be nothing set by, but had in contempt, and reputed
as abiects and vile persons, which no man cares for, nor fears to delude and
mock, therefore he uses here that comparison and example.

In the second Scene.
2 Omnem de me eiecit animum, He has cast his mind away from me.

3 Quodnam ob facinus? For what act, deed, or trespass?

3 Quid ego tantum sceleris admisi miser? What so great and heinous trespass
have I perpetrate or done unhappy body that I am?

4 Vulgo id faciunt, They do it commonly (as who should say) every body uses
to do this thing that I have done.

4 Scio tibi esse hoc grauius multo, ac du^ius, I know that this thing is to
thee much more grievous and hard.

5 Ego haud minus aegre, patior, I take the matter even as grievously.

5 Nescio, nee rationem capio. I know it not, nor I perceive nor understand not
the reason of it.

6 Tibi been ex animo volo, I would thee well with all my heart.

7 Hic patrem astare aiebas? Stood my father here say thou.

7 Quid me incusas? Why blamest thou me? or why layest thou fault or blame in
me.

8 Quicquid ego huius feci tibi prospexi, and stultitiae tuae, Whatsoever I
have done in this matter, I did it to help thee and thy folishnes prospicere,
is to look or to see unto, and to provide or shift for.

9 Te vidi animo esse omisso* I saw or marked thee to be of a reichlesse mind,
Omisso i. neglige^ti. So in Adelphus. At enim metuas ne ab re sint omissiores
paulo* Mary but percase thou will: fear and cast perilles, that they should be
negligent about their own profit, and about geuinge money to sustain them
or to live by,

9 Vidi te suauia in presentia quae essent prima habere, neque consulere in
longitudinem, I saw or marked thee to set most by those things, which be
sweet pleasant and delectable for the while, and not to provide for any space
or long time to come.

11 Caepi rationem, vt neque egeres, neque haec posses perdere. I began to take
such a way y^ neither thou might be brought to poverty, need* or penury,
nor yet might leese this that tho^ have*

13 Eis commisi and credidi, I have committed and put all the matter to them.

14 Ibi tuae stultitiae semper erit praesidiu^. There shall be always a refuge
and place ^f succor for thy foolishnes.

17 Disperij, scelestus qua^tas turbas conseiui insciens? I am undone
ungracious fellow that I am, how great troublous business have I procured
unwitting?

18 Emori cupio. I would feign die, or I would I were out of the world, or I
would gladly be out of my life.

18 Prius quaeso, disce quid sit viuere, vbi scies, si displicebit vita, tu^
is it hoc vtitor, I pray the first learn, what it is to live in deed, and after
that thou shall know it, than if good life shall miss like thee, use this
fashion that thou do now. Viuere, is here taken for secundum virtute^
viuere* To live after yt rule of virtue. And Vita here is taken for actus and
mores, as who should say the life active, moral, and virtuous. So in Phormio.
Que^ ego in vita vidi optimu^ Whom I have seen maruailous good honest, and
virtuous of living.

20 Quae ista est prauitas, quaeue amo^tia? what naughty fashyon is this, or
what madness.

21 Quod peccaui ego, id obest huic. That that I have offended hurts him here.

22 Ne te admisce, meddle not thou in the matter. Ne an aduerbe of forbidding
may be joined with verbes of the imparatiue mode, or of the subiunctiue mode
indifferently. Non in the same signification is joined with verbes of the
subiunctiue mode only, and not of the imparatiue mode.

22 Nemo te accusat, No man accuses, blames, or appeacheth thee, or no man
complayneth on thee.

22 Nec tu aram tibi neque precatorem pataris Neither take sainctuary for the
matter, ne yet provide, get or make any spokesma^, perticioner or intercessor
for thee. Pararis for paraueris per syncopen, and it is the future tence of the
subiunctiue mode set for the imparatiue mode.

23 Nihil succe^c^otibi, I am nothing angry with thee.

25 Rogasse vellem, vnde mihi peterem cibum, I would I had asked of him where I
should require my meat and drink.

26 Nos abalienauit. He has geeuen us over, or he has cast us of, or he
has forbidden us his house.

29 Irride^ in re tanta neque, me quicquam consilio adiuuas? Do thou mock or
jest in so great a matter, nor helpest me nothing at all with thy counsel?

33 Ego dicam quod mihi in mentem, tu dijudica I will say that is in my mind,
and then judge thou. In mentem, s. venit. or else in mentem. s. est for in mente
est per antip^osin. Albeit, in the margin of Bast^^s inprinting it is noted,
a^ found read in some examplaries, not in men te est.

35 Inuenta est causa, qua te expellere^t, there was a quarrel found, whereby
they might drive or thrust thee out.

37 Est verisimile. It is like so.

37 An tu ob hoc peccatum esse illum iratum, putas? Do thou suppose or
think, that he is angry for this offense?

38 Non arbitror, I think not.

38 Nunc aliud specta, Now mark an other thing, or yet more over consider an
other thing. For I think nunc here to be taken for I am which very often and
many times is taken for Praeterea insuper, ad haec, Furthermore besides all
this. ^c.

38 Matres omnes filius in peccato adiutrices sole^t esse, All mothers use or
been wont to help their sons, when they have done any fault.

39 Matres filijs auxilio in paterna iniuria solent esse, Mothers are wont to
help their children when their Fathers do them wrong or be unreasonable.

40 Id non fit. That is not done.

41 Suspicionem istam ex illis quaere. Demand of them and inquire the cause of
this suspicion.

41 Rem profer palam. Utter the matter plainly.

42 Si non est verum, ad misericordiam ambos adduces cito, If it be not true,
thou shall anon move and bring them both to pity and compassion.

43 Recte suades. Thou geeuest me good counsel.

43 Sat recte hoc mihi in me^tem venit, this came very well unto my mind or
remembrance.

49 Eum precatorem mihi paro. Him will I get to be spokesman, peticioner, or
intercessour for me.

49 Seni nostro fidei nihil habeo. I trust our old man never a deal, or I
have no trust or affyaunce at all in the old man my master.

The third Scene.
1 Profecto, nisi caves tu homo, aliquid conficies mali, undoubtedly, except
thou beeware thou fellow, thou shall work or bring up some mischief.

2 Miror quomodo tam ineptum quidquam potu erit tibi venire in mentem, I
marvel how any so foolyshe a thing could come into thy mind.

3 Pergin' mulier esse? Wylt thou be a woman still? as who should say, Wylt
thou never leave thy woman's conditions?

4 Vllam ne ego rem vnquam volui, quin tu in ea re mihi aduersator fueris? Was
I ever minded or willinge to have done any thing but that thou have res^sted
and been against me therein? Terence in the Text, speaking in that person of
Chremes unto Sostrata, being a woman, says, Aduersatix.

5 Si rogitem iam, quid est quod pecce^ aut qua^obrem hoc faciam, nescias. If I
would now ask of thee, what it is wherein I do amiss or wherefore I do this
same, thou could not tell.

6 In qua re nunc ^am confidenter restas stulre? In what thing do thou now
withstand me, or strive and strug^e against me so boldly or malape^tly
foolish fellow?

9 Iniquis es, qui me tacere de re tanta postules. Thou art unjust, or
unreasonable, that do require, or that would have me to hold my peace,
and say nothing, in to great a matter.

9 Nihilo minus ego hoc faciam tamen. Yet never the less I will do this same.

10 Non vides quantum mali ex ea re excites, do thou not see how much
mischief thou raysest thereby.

11 Subditum se suspicatur, He mistrusteth him self that he was some
chaungeling, Subditum *^* subditiu^ vel suppositum. Subpositus, ta, tum, a
chaungeling, or a child that was changed in the cradle, and lated there for
the very true child Iuuenalis. Transeo suppositos. I pass over and speak
nothing of chaungelinges, or such as were changed in their cradles, as we
say in english. Of the same signification is Subtitius, and here in this place
subditus,

12 Istuc in imicis siet, Such chance come to our enemies.

13 Ego confitear meum non esse filium qui sit meus? Should I confess or say,
that he is not my son, which in deed is mine?

14 Quid metuis, What fear thou? or whereof art thou afearde?

17 Conuinces facile ex te natum, nam tui fimilis est probe, Thou shall sont or
easly prove him to be of thine own body borne, for he is very like unto thee
of conditions. Diverse grammarians have noted, that fimilis wha^ it governs a
dative case, betokens like in favor, ^ when it governs a genitive, it
betokens like of manners and conditions. Which observation here in this and
other places, for the more part is true, but yet not every where.

18 Illi nihil vitij est relictum, quin id itidem sit tibi, He has no fault or
vice left, but that thou have even the same also.

19 Talem nulla nisi tu pararet filium, No woman alive could have brought
forth such a son, but thou. Here is the figure zeugma, of which it is
diligently noted a little before, and this same clause of Terence there recited.

The fourth Scene.
1 Si vnquevllum fuit tempus, cum ego voluptati tibi fuerim, obsecro eius vt
memineris, If ever there was any time, that you had any delighte or pleasure in
me, I bese^ch you for Gods sake call it to mind and remembrance.

3 Inopis te miserescat mei. Have thou pity and compassion upon me, being a
poor fellow and without any manner of help. For that signifies properly inops.

4 Peto parents meos, vt commonstres mihi, I desire you that you will show
unto me my parents, or my Father and Mother.

5 Ne isthuc animum inducas tuum never think that

6 Hoccine quaesisti obsecro? Have thou asked such a question of me I pray
thee?

8 Cave posthac si me amas, vnquam isthuc verbum ex te audiam. Beware if thou
love me, that I never here that word of thy mouth again.

9 Cave mores posthac in te esse istos sentia^ Beware that I never see or
perceive to be in thee gain from henceforth such manners or behavior, as thou
have used.

10 Si scire vis, ego dicam. If thou be willing or desirous to know, I will
tell thee.

11 Nostrum te esse credito. Think thy self to be our own sone^. So it is
taken here in this place of Terence, but it may be englished in another sense,
thus: Think thy self to be our own (as who should say) our friend and in
our good favor.

12 Non sunt haec parentis dicta, These be not meet words of a Father to his
Son.

12 Non si ex capite sis meo natus, itidem vt aiu^t, Mineruam esse ex Jove* ea
causa magis patiet flagitijs tuis me infamem fieri. Although thou were borne
out of my very head, eue^ so as they say y^ Minerua was borne out of the head
and brain of Jupiter, yet I will not any thing the rather for that cause
suffer my self to be in infamy and obloque of men, or to incur and run in
slander of men, by reason of thy abominable vices or naughty fashions
Flagitijs is ablatiuae causae* Miuerua is the Goddess of arts, sciences, and
wars, and it is metaphorically taken sometimes for nature, for wit, or for
any art or science. Which things because they be high gifts, and only given
by God, the poets feign that Minerua was the daughter of Jupiter, and
delivered, or borne out of his own head or brain. Whereof Lucianus the Greek
poet has a very pretty dialogue, in dialogis deo rum superum.

15 Dij istaec prohibeant, The Gods forbid or defend those things.

15 Ego quod potero enitar sedulo, I will do my^u^y labor as much as I
shall be able to do,

16 Quaeris id quod habes parents, quod abest non quaeris patri quo modo
obsequare, and vt serves, quod labor inuenerir, Thou seek that, that thou
have, that is to say, parents, or father and mother, but that, that thou have
not, but lackest, thou seek not* that is to say, how thou may please thy
father, and how thou may keep that he has gotten with his labor,
Inuenerit. i. parauerit.

19 Pudet dicere hoc praesente, I am ashamed to speak it in the presence of
this man.

19 At te illud nullo modo facere puduit. But thou were never a whit at al
ashamed to do that.

20 Eheu, quam ego nunc totus displiceo mihi, Alas how angry I am with my
self, or how sorry I am, Displiceo mihi in latin speaking is some times used
in a much like se^ce, as we use to say in English, I am ^alfe naught, as thus,
I was weary of trauayling, or, after my journey, and was half naught and more.
De via fessus era^, mihique totus displicebam.

21 Qua^ pudet. s. me* How greatly ashamed I am.

The fifth Scene.
1 Enimuero nimis grauiter cruciat adolescentulum, nimisque inhumane, Truly he
vexes the poor young man to sore, and to unkindly or ungently.

2 Exeo vt pacem conciliem. s. inter eos, I come forth to make peace or
attoneme^t between the^.

3 Cur non accersi iubes filiam. s. mea^? Why do thou not bid or command my
daughter to be sent for?

4 Mi vir te obsecro ne facias Sweet husband I pray you for Gods sake do not
so.

5 Pater obsecro mihi ignoscas, Father, I beseech you for Gods sake, forgive or
pardon me.

5 Da veniam. s. mihi, Forgive or pardon me.

6 Sine te exore^* Let me entreat you. Exorate est orando impetrare, To
obta^ne with praying.

6 Scien^ non faciam, I will not do it wittingly.

7 Id nos non sinemus, I will not suffer it. No^ for ego, is much used
modestiae causa, but vos for ^u, may not be used, ne honoris quidem gratia.

7 Si me viuum vis pater, ignoscc. s. mihi, Father if you love my life, forgive
or pardon me.

8 Ne ta^ offirma te. Be not so stiff, or be not so cursed hearted, for that
is offirmare animum, all bett, it is used sometimes in the good part.

10 Ea lege hoc faciam, I will do the thing upon this condition.

11 Omnia faciam, impera, I will do all things that you shall think good,
command me, Omnia faciam. s. quae tu censes equum esse vt faciam, for that
went next before.

11 Ad me recipio, I undertake it.

14 Haec dum incipias grauitia sunt, dumque ignores, vbi cognoris, facilia. Al
these things be hard, till a man has begun or is entered in them, and as
long as he knows them not, but after that he is ones acquainted with them
they be light.

17 Rufam ne illam virginem, caesiam, sparso ore, aduneo naso, ducam? Shall I
marry that red headed, grayeyed, platerfaced, and haukenosed wench, Caesius, a,
u^, and glaucus, ca, cu^, Is blew or gray, as the sky, is when it has little
specks of gray Clouds in a fair day, as it were a plumket color. Of the
names of colors read Aul. Ge. l. 2. noct. attic. Ca. 26. Sparso ore. ^. largo,
lato amplo, Large, broad, and (as we use to say in scorn, or derision)
platerfaced. Adunco naso. i. incuruo, croking, or bowing inward, like as the
bill of an Egle, or of an Hawk, and such we call in scorn or derision
haukenoses.

19 Eia vt elegans ea, Etgh what a Mynion it is.

20 Quando quidem ducenda est, egomet habeo propemodum qua^ volo, Seus y^ I
must needs mary one, I my self have in manner found her that I will have.

21 Nunc laudo te gnate, Now I con thee thank son.

22 Perplacet. s. mihi. I am very well contented, or it pleased me very well.

22 Hoc nunc restat. This now remains.

23 Syro ignoscas volo, quae mea causa fecit, I would have you to pardon Syrus
of those things that he has done for my cause, or for my sake. Syro
ignoscas. s* ea quae. etc.

Finis Heauton.
Ex Adelphis, in the Prologue,
^ LEnoni eripuit meretricem, He took perforce* an har^ot, from a baude or from
