A LARGE EXAMINATION TAKEN at Lambeth, according to his Majesty's direction,
point by point, of M. George Blakwell, made Archpriest of England, by Pope
Clement 8. Upon occasion of a certain answer of his, without the priuitie of
the State, to a Letter lately sent unto him from Cardinal Bellarmine, blaming
him for taking the oath of Allegiance. Together with the Cardinals Letter, and
M. Blakwels said answer unto it. Also M. Blakwels Letter to the Romish
Catholics in England, as well Ecclesiastical, as Lay.

Imprinted at London by Robert Barker, Printer to the Kings most Excellent
Majesty. 1607.

A COPY OF THE ACT, OF M. BLAKwell his verifying, and acknowledging of this his
Examination, etc.
Before his Majesty's Commissioners for causes Ecclesiastical at Lambeth the
first of February 1607. iuxta, etc.
THis day Sir Thomas Crompton knight, his Majesty's Advocate did in the
presence of M. George Blakwell, exhibit into the Court four several
writings. The first was the original letter it self (as M. Blakwell
confessed) sent unto him from Cardinal Bellarmine, dated at Rome the xxviij.
day of September 1607. It was endorsed in this sort: Admodum Reuerendo Domino,
D. Georgio Blacuello Archipresbytero Angliae: and subscribed thus, Reuerendae
admodum D. V. frater and seruus in Christo, Robertus Cardinalis Bellarminus:
beginning with these words, Venerabilis in Christo Domine frater. Anni sunt
fere quadraginta, quod inuicem non viderimus, etc: and ending with these words:
Vale, viriliter age, and confortetur cor tuum. The second was an answer of M.
Blakwels to the said letter of the Cardinal, written all of it with his own
hand, and is the true copy (he says) of that which he did send to the
Cardinal, the marginal quotations only excepted, which (he confesses) he
has since added. This letter bears date the xiij. of November 1607. and
beginning thus: Doleo plurimum quod Illustrissima -- Amplitudo vestra de me
propter Catholicam fidem incarcerato, etc. does thus end, Nisi quod beatus
Petrus aut soluerit aut ligauerit.

These two Letters did give occasion of the other two writings exhibited: the
first whereof was, an Examination of M. Blakwel taken at several times by the
Lord Archbishop of Canterbury, as touching the particular points of his
answer to the Cardinal, and other necessary consequents thereupon depending:
It contained 114. pages, which were every one of them subscribed unto by M.
Blakwell (as he confessed) with his own hand: it began in this manner, He
says, that because he perceives, that diverse exceptions are taken against his
late Letter, etc: and ended with these words; and therein he had his desire.
The fourth paper exhibited was a true copy (as M. Blakwell acknowledged) of a
letter of his, directed to all the Catholics in England, as well
Ecclesiastical as Lay, dated from the Clinke the xx. of January 1607. It was
thus endorsed, To my reverend Assistants with the rest of my dear brethren
both of the Clergy and Laity: and thus subscribed, Georgius Blakwellus
Archipresbyter Angliae, and Protonotarius Apostolicus. The beginning of it was
as follows: Very reverend and my dearest beloved brethren both Priests and
people Catholic: your servant in bands George Blakwell, etc: and this was
the end of it, And confirm you in every good work and word.

And touching the contents both of his said Examination and letter exhibited
into the Court (as is aforesaid,) the same being showed unto him page by page,
subscribed with his own hand (as is above mentioned) he did auow them to be
true: and that whatsoever is either in his said Letter, or in his answers,
throughout the course of his whole Examination, to the questions and matters
propounded unto him, is agreeable to his conscience, so far forth as by his
reading and learning he is able to judge. And this he protested before God, he
had done simply and faithfully, without any reseruations or euasions, by any
shifting or equivocation either verbal, or mental; answering in every thing
according (as he thought) to the intent and meaning of his Examiner, as if he
had been sworn; agreeably to the rule of S. Bernard in the like case:
Quacunque art verborum quis iuret, Deus qui conscientiae testis est, accipit,
sicut ille cui hoc iuratur, intelligit: and to that of S. Hierome, Tantus in te
sit very amor, vt quicquid dixeris, iuratum putes.

And all the premises he acknowledged openly in Court, and subscribed unto
them, the day and year above written.

CARDINAL BELlarmines Letter to the Archpriest.
Admodum Reuerendo Domino Georgio Blacuello Archipresbytero Anglorum. Robertus
S. R. E. Cardinalis Bellarminus. S. D.
VEnerabilis in Christo Domine frater. Anni sunt fere quadraginta, quod inuicem
non viderimus: sed ego tamen veteris nostrae consuetudinis nunquam oblitus sum,
teque in vinea Domini strenue laborantem, quando aliter non potui, orationibus
Deo commendare non destiti; me quoque in tua memoria toto hoc tempore vixisse,
and in tuis orationibus ad Altar Domini locum aliquem habuisse non dubito. Ita
igitur ad hoc vsque tempus non verbis, aut literis, sed opere and veritate, vt
Sanctus Ioannes loquitur, alter in alterius dilectione permansimus. Sed hoc
silentium rumpere coegit nuncius, qui diebus istis de tuis vinculis, and
carcere ad nos venit. Qui quidem nuncius, etsi tristis videri poterat ob
iacturam pastoralis tuae sollicitudinis, quam Ecclesia ista fecit: tamen laetus
quoque videbatur, quoniam ad Martyrij gloriam, quo dono Dei nullum est
foelicius, propinquabas, vt qui tot annis gregem tuum verbo, and doctrina
pauisses, nunc exemplo patientiae gloriosius pasceres. Verum hanc laetitiam non
mediocriter interturbauit, ac fere corrupit tristis alius nuncius, qui de
co^stantia tua in recusando illicito iuramento ab aduersarijs tentata, forte
etiam labefacta, and prostrata successit. Neque enim, frater charissime,
iuramentum illud ideo licitum esse potuit, quod aliquo modo temperatum, and
modificatum offerebatur. Scis enim eiusmodi modificationes nihil esse aliud,
quam Satanae dolos, and versutias, vt fides Catholica de primatu sedis
Apostolicae vel aperte, vel occulte petatur, pro qua fide tot inclyti Martyrs
in ista ipsa Anglia ad sanguinem vsque pugnarunt. Certe enim quibuscunq verbis
iuramentum ab aduersarijs fidei concipiatur in Regno isto eo tendit, vt
auctoritas capitis Ecclesiae a Successore Sancti Petri ad successorem Henrici
octaui in Anglia transferatur. Quod enim obtenditur de periculo vitae Regis, si
summus Pontifex eam in Anglia potestatem habeat, quam in alijs omnibus
Christianis Regnis habet; inane prorsus esse, omnes qui sunt aliqua prudentia
praediti facile vident. Neque enim auditum est vnquam ab initio nascentis
Ecclesiae, vsque ad haec nostra tempora, quod vllus Pontifex Maximus Principem
vllum, quamuis haereticum, quamuis ethnicum, quamuis persecutorem caedi
mandauerit, aut caedem forte ab aliquo patratam probauerit. Et cur quoeso vnus
Rex Angliae timet, quod ex tot Christianis Principibus nullus timet, nullus
timuit? Sed, vt dixi, vani isti praetextus decipulae sunt, and stratagemata
Satanae. Qualia non pauca in Historijs veterum temporum inueniuntur, quae
facile refer possem, si non epistolam, sed librum integrum scribendum
suscepissem: vnum tantum, exempli gratia, ad memoriam tibi reuocabo. Scribit
Sanctus Gregorius Nazianzenus in prima oratione in Iulianum Imperatorem, illum,
vt simplicibus Christianis imponeret, in imaginibus Imperatorijs, quas Romani
civilly quodam genere honoris pro more adorabant, imagines deorum falsorum
admiscuisse, vt nemo posset Imperatoris imaginem adorare, quin simul deorum
simulachris cultum adhiberet. Hinc nimirum fiebat, vt plurimi deciperentur, and
si qui forte fraudem subodorati, Imperatoris imaginem venerari recusarent, ij
grauissime punirentur, vt qui Caesarem in sua imagine contempsissent. Tale
aliquid in Iur amento vobis oblato mihi videre videor, quod ea fraud
compositum est, vt nemo possit proditionem in Regem detestari, ciuilemque
subiectionem profiteri, quin primatum Sedis Apostolicae perfide abnegare
cogatur. Sed Christi serui, ac praesertim primarij Domini Sacerdotes, vbi
periculum Fidei subesse possit, tantum abesse debent a susceptione illiciti
iuramenti, vt ab omni etiam suspicione simulationis praestiti iuramenti cauere
debeant, ne fidelibus populis vllum praeuaricationis exemplum reliquisse
videantur. Quod egregie praestitit insignis ille Eleazarus, qui neque porcinas
carnes comedere, neque simulare comedisse voluit, quamuis grauissima tormenta
sibi cerneret imminere, ne, vt ipse ait in secundo libro Maccabaeorum, multi
iuuenum per eam simulationem ad legis preuaricationem animarentur. Neque minus
fortiter magnus Basilius, and exemplo ad res nostras magis accommodato, cum
Valente Imperatore se gessit. Nam, vt in historia scribit Theodoretus, cum
Praefectus Imperatoris haeretici hortaretur Sanctum Basilium, vt non vellet
propter paruam dogmatum subtilitatem, Imperatori resistere; respondit vir ille
sanctissimus and prudentissimus, non esse ferendum, vt de Diuinis dogmatibus,
vel vna syllaba corrumpatur, sed potius pro eorum defensione omne genus
supplicij amplectendum. Equidem arbitror non deesse apud vos, qui dogmatum
subtilitatem esse dicant, quae in Iuramento Catholicis hominibus proposito
continentur, and non esse propter rem tam paruam Regis Imperio reluctandum. Sed
non deerunt etiam viri sancti, ac magno Basilio similes, qui palam affirmabunt,
non esse de Diuinis dogmatibus, vel minimam aliquam syllabam corrumpendam,
etiamsi tormenta and mors ipsa toleranda proponatur. Inter hos vnum, vel potius
horum Principem atque antesignanum te esse par est. Et quamuis vel inopinata
comprehensio, vel acerbitas persequutionis, vel senectutis imbecillitas, vel
quid aliud in causa fuerit, vt constantia titubauerit; confidimus tamen de
Domini pietate, and de diuturna tua virtute, fore, vt qui Sancti Petri and
Sancti Marcellini casum aliqua ex part imitatus videris, eorundem fortitudinem
in reparandis viribus and veritate asserenda foeliciter imiteris. Nam si rem
totam diligenter apud te cogitare volueris, videbis profecto non esse rem
paruam, quae ob Iuramentum istud in discrimen adducitur, sed vnum ex praecipuis
fidei nostrae capitibus, ac religionis Catholicae fundamentis. Audi enim quid
Apostolus vester magnus Gregorius in Epistola quadragesima secunda libri
vndecimi scribat; Apostolicae Sedis reuerentia nullius praesumptione turbetur:
tunc enim membrorum status integer perseuerat, si caput fidei nulla pulsetur
iniuria. Itaque S. Gregorio test, cum de primatu sedis Apostolicae vel
turbando, vel minuendo, vel tollendo satagitur, de ipso capite fidei amputando,
ac de totius corporis, omniumque membrorum statu dissipando satagitur. Quod
ipsum Sanctus Leo confirmat in sermon tertio de assumptione sua ad
Pontificatum, cum ait; Specialis cura Petri a Domino suscipitur, and pro fide
Petri proprie supplicatur, tanquam aliorum status certior sit futurus, si men's
Principis victa non fuerit. Ex quo idem ipse in Epistola ad Episcopos
Viennensis prouinciae affirmare non dubitat, necesse esse, exortem illum
mysterij esse Diuini, qui ausus fuerit a Petri soliditate recedere. Qui rursum
ait; Quisquis huic Sedi principatum existimat denegandum, illius quidem nullo
modo potest minuere dignitatem, sed inflatus spiritu superbiae suae semetipsum
in inferna demergit. Atque haec quidem and alia eiusdem generis multa tibi
notissima esse certo scio, qui praeter caeteros libros, Visibile^ Monarchiam
Sanderi tui, scriptoris diligentissimi, and de Ecclesia Anglicana optime
meriti, saepe legisti: quique ignorare non potes, sanctissimos viros, eosdemque
doctissimos, Ioannem Roffensem, and Thomam Morum pro hoc vno grauissimo dogmate
duces ad Martyrium plurimis alijs, cum ingenti Anglicae nationis gloria, nostra
memoria fuisse. Sed ad memoriam tibi reuocare volui, vt colligas te, and
magnitudinem rei considerans, non tuo iudicio nimium fidas, neque plus sapias
quam oportet sapere; and si forte lapsus tuus non ex inconsideratione, sed ex
infirmitate humana, ex metu carceris, and suppliciorum profectus est: non
anteponas libertatem temporalem libertati gloriae filiorum Dei, neque ob
momentaneam, and leuem tribulationem fugiendam, amittere velis aeternum gloriae
pondus, quod ipsa tribulatio operatur in te. Bonum certamen diu certasti,
cursum ferme consummasti, fidem tot annis seruasti, noli igiter tantorum
laborum pramia tam facile perdere, noli corona iustitiae, quae tibi iamdudum
paratur, te ipse priuare, noli tot fratrum and filiorum tuorum vultus
confundere. In te sunt hoc tempore coniecti oculi totius Ecclesiae, quin etiam
spectaculum factus es mundo, Angelis and hominibus: noli in extremo actu ita te
gerere, vt and tuis luctum, and gaudium hostibus relinquas. Sed contra potius,
quod omnino speramus, and pro quo ad Deum nostrum assidue preces fundimus,
vexillum fidei gloriose erigas, and quam contristaueras, laetamfacias
Ecclesiam, nec iam solum veniam merearis a Domino, sed coronam. Vale, viriliter
age, and confortetur cor tuum. Romae die 28. Septembris. 1607.

Reuerendae admodum D. V. frater and seruus in Christo, Robertus Cardinalis
Bellarminus.

The same in English.
To the very Reverend, M. George Blakwell Archpriest of the English: Robert of
the holy Church of Rome, Cardinal Bellarmine, sends greeting.
Reverend Sir, and Brother in Christ, It is almost forty years since we did
see one the other: But yet I have never been unmindful of our ancient
acquaintance, neither have I ceased, seeing I could do you no other good, to
commend you, laboring most painefully in the Lords vineyard, in my prayers to
God: and I doubt not, but that I have lived all this while in your memory, and
have had some place in your prayers at the Lords Altar. So therefore even unto
this time we have abidden, as S. John speaks, in the mutual love one of the
other, not in word or letter, but in deed, and truth. But a late message
which was brought unto us within a few days, of your bonds and imprisonment,
has enforced me to break off this silence; which message, although it seemed
heavy in regard of the loss of your pastoral function which you have
exercised in that Church, yet withal it seemed joyous, because you drew near
unto the glory of Martyrdom, then the which thing there is no gift of God more
happy; that you, who have fed your Flock so many years with the word and
doctrine, should now feed it more gloriously, by the example of your patience.
But another heavy tidings did not a little disquiet and almost take away this
joy, which immediately followed, of the adversaries assault, and peradventure of
the slip and fall of your Constancy in refusing an unlawful Oath. Neither
truly (most dear brother) could that oath therefore be lawful, because it
was offered in sort tempered and modified: for you know that those kind of
modifications are nothing else, but sleights and subtilties of Satan, that the
Catholic faith touching the Primacie of the Sea Apostolic, might either
secretly or openly be shot at, for the which faith so many worthy Martyrs even
in that very England it self, have resisted unto blood. For most certain it
is, that in whatsoever words the Oath is conceived by the adversaries of the
faith in that Kingdom, it tends to this end, that the Authority of the head
of the Church in England, may be transferred from the successor of S. Peter,
to the Successor of K. Henry the eight, For that which is pretended of the
danger of the Kings life, if the supreme Bishop should have the same power in
England, which he has in all other Christian Kingdoms: it is altogether idle,
as all that have any understanding, may easily perceive. For it was never heard
of from the Churches infancy until this day, that ever any Pope did command,
that any Prince, though an Heretic, though an Ethnike, though a Persecuter,
should be murdered, or did approve of the fact, when it was done by any other.
And why, I pray you, does only the King of England fear that, which none of
all the other Princes in Christendom either does fear, or ever did fear?

But, as I said, these vain pretexts are but the Trappes and Stratagemes of
Satan: of which kind, I could produce not a few out of ancient Stories, if I
went about to write a book, and not an Epistle. One only for example sake, I
will call to your memory. S. Gregory Nazianzene in his first Oration against
Julian the Emperor, reports, that he, the more easily to beguile the simple
Christians, did insert the Images of the false gods into the pictures of the
Emperor, which the Romans did use to bow down unto with a civil kind of
reverence; so that no man could do reverence to the Emperors picture, but
withal he must adore the Images of the false gods. Whereupon it came to pass,
that many were deceived: and if there were any that found out the Emperors
craft, and refused to worship his picture, those were most grievously punished,
as men that had contemned the Emperor in his Image. Some such like thing, me
thinks, I see in the Oath that is offered to you, which is so craftily
composed, that no man can detest Treason against the King, and make profession
of his Civil subjection, but he must be constrained, perfidiously to deny the
Primacy of the Apostolic See. But the servants of Christ, and especially the
chief Priests of the Lord ought to be so far from taking an unlawful Oath,
where they may indamage their Faith, that they ought to beware that they give
not the least suspicion of dissimulation that they have taken it. Which thing
that worthy Eleazar did most notably perform, who would neither eat Swines
flesh, nor so much as feign to have eaten it, although he saw the great
torments that did hang over his head, lest, as himself speaks in the second
book of the Maccabees, many young men might be brought through that Simulation,
to preuaricate with the Law. Neither did Basil the great by his example, which
is more fit for our purpose, carry himself less worthily toward Valens the
Emperor. For, as Theodoret writes in his History, when the Deputy of that
heretical Emperor did persuade Saint Basil, that he should not resist the
Emperor for a little Subtlety of a few points of Doctrine; that most holy and
prudent man made answer, That it was not to be endured, that the least
syllable of Gods word should be corrupted, but rather all kind of torment was
to be embraced, for the maintenance of the Truth thereof. Now I suppose, that
there want not amongst you, who say that they are but Subtilties of Opinions,
that are contained in the Oath that is offered to the Catholics, and that you
are not to strive against the Kings Authority for such a little matter. But
there are not wanting also amongst you holy men, like unto Basil the Great,
which will openly auow, that the very least syllable of Gods Divine Truth is
not to be corrupted, though many Torments were to be endured, and death it
self set before you. Amongst whom it is meet, that you should be one, or
rather the Standerd-bearer, and General to the rest. And whatsoever has been
the cause, that your Constancy has quailed, whether it be the suddennes of
your apprehension, or the bitterness of your persecution, or the imbecillitie
of your old age: yet we trust in the goodness of God, and in your own long
continued virtue, that it will come to pass, that as you seem in some part to
have imitated the fall of Peter and Marcellinus, so you shall happily imitate
their valor in recovering your strength, and maintaining the truth. For if
you will diligently weigh the whole matter with your self, truly you shall see
it is no small matter that is called in question by this Oath, but one of the
principal heads of our faith, and foundations of Catholic Religion. For
hear what your Apostle S. Gregory the Great has written, in his 42. Epistle
of his 11. book. Let not the Reverence due to the Apostolic See, be
troubled by any man's presumption: for then the state of the members does
remain entire, when the head of the faith is not bruisedby any injury.
Therefore, by S. Gregory's testimony, when they are busy about disturbing or
diminishing, or taking away of the Primacie of the Apostolic See, then are
they busy about cutting off the very head of the faith, and dissoluing of the
state of the whole body, and of all the members. Which self same thing S. Leo
does confirm in his third Sermon of his Assumption to the Pope-dome, when he
says, Our Lord had a special care of Peter, and prayed properly for Peter's
faith, as though the state of others were more stable, when their Princes mind
was not to be overcome. Whereupon himself in his Epistle to the Bishops of
Vienna, does not doubt to affirm, that he is not partaker of the divine
Mystery, that dare depart from the soliditie of Peter. Who also says, that
he who thinks the Primacie is to be denied to that See, he can in no sort
lessen the Authority of it, but by being puffed up with the spirit of pride,
does cast himself headlong into hell. These and many other of this kind, I am
very sure are most familiar to you: who besides many other books, have
diligently read over the Visible Monarchy of your own Saunders, a most
diligent writer, and one who has worthily deserved of the Church of England.
Neither can you be ignorant, that those most holy and learned men, John B. of
Rochester, and Thomas More within our memory, for this one most weighty head
of doctrine, led the way to Martyrdom to many others, to the exceeding glory
of the English Nation. But I would put you in remembrance, that you should take
heart, and considering the weightinesse of the cause, not to trust too much to
your own judgment, neither be wise above that is meet to be wise. And if
peradventure your fall have proceeded not upon want of consideration, but
through humane infirmity, and for fear of punishment, and imprisonment; yet
do not prefer a temporal liberty before the liberty of the glory of the
Sons of God, neither for escaping a light and momentarie tribulation, loose
an eternal weight of glory, which tribulation it self does work in you. You
have fought a good fight a long time, you have wel-neere finished your course.
So many years you have kept the faith: do not therefore loose the reward of
such labors: do not deprive your self of that Crown of righteousness which
so long agone is prepared for you. Do not make the faces of so many your both
brethren and children ashamed. Upon you at this time are fixed the eyes of all
the Church: yea also, you are made a spectacle to the world, to Angels, to men:
Do not so carry your self in this your last Act, that you leave nothing but
laments to your friends, and joy to your enemies, but rather the contrary:
which we assuredly hope, and for which we continually power forth prayers to
God. Display gloriously the banner of Faith, and make to rejoice the Church,
which you have made heavy. So shall you not only merit pardon at Gods hands,
but a Crown. Farewell, quite you like a man, and let your heart be
strengthened. From Rome the 28. day of September, 1607.

Your very Reverend Masterships brother; and servant in Christ, Robert
Cardinal Bellarmine. Endorsed.

M. BLAKWELS answer to Card. Bellarmines Letter.
Reuerendissime in Christo Pater, and Illustrissime Cardinalis Bellarmine.
DOleo plurimum, quod Illustrissima Amplitudo vestra de me propter Catholicam
fidem incarcerato, tam duram conceperit, and mihi terribile^ opinionem.
Hactenus per Dei gratiam ne in minimo quidem articulo fluctuasse me memini, qui
certo and definite ad sublimem maiestatem, and summam authoritatem Sedis
Apostolicae pertineret. Quod ad iuramentum spectat, fateor me illud suscepisse,
sed in eo sensu, qui in Catholicorum scriptis probatus apparet, and nulla labe
temeritatis aspersus. Sensus enim meus ter repetitus, and acceptus a
Magistratu, and iam etiam public typis propagatus, hic est: Summum Pontificem
non habere imperialem, and ciuilem potestatem ad libitum, and ex suo appetitu,
deponendi nostrum Regem. Talem potestatem Catholici Theologi nunquam tribuerunt
Sanctissimo Diui Petri successori, vt Illustrissimus bonae memoriae Cardinalis
Alanus, and alij non contemnendi Card. Alanus in Respons ad Iustatiam
Anglicanam. Sixtus Senens. in Bibliotheca Sancta S. R. cont. Tho. Bell. R. P.

scriptores in monumentis suis ad posteritatis memoriam notauerunt. Neque est
cur quisquam vel minimam suspicionem habeat, illum sensum admissum esse a
Magistratu, deformandae causa, aut imminuendae, aut spoliandae dignitatis
Apostolicae. Certe tales ex suspicione nati conceptus sunt plerunque
fallacissimi magistri, and faciunt timorem, vbi nullus est timor.

Sed vt pergam, quam institui, tenere viam: Illud etiam ad defensionem meam

in finem spiritualem, ideo ad ipsum nequaquam spectare, omnibus modis rerum

Cum ergo ad hunc modum arcta and astricta sit Pontificis authoritas in
temporalibus, cur nos in tam grauem reprehensionem incurreremus, qui dicimus
summum Pontificem non habere potestatem deponendi nostrum Regem, quia inde
perturbatio Ecclesiae, and euersio Catholicorum nostrorum in bonis and
possessionibus, and detrimenta plurimarum animarum prouenirent? Audiat

Papa, vt Papa, ordinary temporales Principes deponere, etiam iusta de causa,
eo modo quo deponit Episcopos, id est, tanquam ordinarius iudex, tamen potest
mutare regna, and vni auferre, and alteri confer, tanquam summus princeps
spiritualis, si id necessarium sit ad animarum salutem. Quae verba plane
firmant nostram admissionem Iuramenti. Nam verba iuramenti sunt: Papam non
habere authoritatem deponendi Rege^, aut disponendi de regnis and dominijs
Maiestatis suae: Et communis intellectus apud Magistratum ad nullum alium
conceptum propendet, quam ad hunc, videlicet, Papam vt Papa est. Nam non potest
pertingere ad illum conceptum, videlicet, tanquam Summum principem spiritualem.
Et cum proponitur iuramentum suscipiendum, illius sensus, cognitus a
Magistratu, restringitur ad ordinariam potestatem. Nam qui proponunt
iuramentum, illi remotissimi sunt a cogitatione extraordinariae aut indirectae
potestatis in Paparesidentis.

Neque etiam si Amplitudinis vestrae mitissima dispositio vel minima ex part
conciperet ruinas familiarum Catholicarum, quas inferret recusatio iuramenti,
certe non dissentiret a nobis, qui ex luctuosissimis spectaculis videmus, inde
profecturam esse, non modo iacturam animarum, sed etiam totius status Catholici
apud nos lamentabilem extirpationem. Cum ergo persentiscimus authoritatem summi
Pontificis, quoad depositionem noshi Regis non esse in ordine ad spiritualia
promouenda sed euertenda; cur exagitaremur, tanquam desertores fidei, and
negatores Apostolici Primatus, qui nihil aliud tenemus, quam quod vbique

Constat huius quaestionis resolutio, vt (salua semper Ecclesiae Catholicae
definitione) constituamus Remanum Pontificem, nec actu, nec habitu
vninersiorbis, nec in ipsos quidem Christianos temporalem Iurisdictionem
habere, nisi quatenus ea necessaria sit ad spiritualis iurisdictionis, and
potestatis vtiliorem, and faciliorem vsum.

Possum longius innauigare in hoc doctorum torrente, liberrime profluenti ad
defensionem nostram de Iuramento. Qui enim aequo oculo pericula nostra
intueretur, facile aduerteret, potestatem summi Pontificis in depositione
nostri Regis, iam contineri non posse intra fines ordinis ad spiritualia
subleuanda; sed excurrere ad supprimenda omnia, quae hactenus in spiritualibus
been posita fuerunt. Hinc patet in quam lamentabilem conditionem detrudunt me
illae paulo grauiores, and acerbiores animaduersiones: Quod ex Sathanae, dolis
consentirem, vt fides Catholica de primatu Sedis Apostolicae vel aperte vel
obscure petatur: Quod Iuramentum in Regno isto eo tendit, vt authorit scapitis
Ecclesiae a successore Sancti Petri ad successorem Henrici 8. in Anglia
transferatur: Quod hic periculum fidei subesse possit: Quod vide or Sancti
Petri and S. Marcellini casum aliqua ex part imitatus: Quod non sitres parua,
quae obiuramentum istud in discrimen adducitur, sed vnum expraecipuis fidei
nostrae capitibus, and religionis Catholicae sundamentis: and quod debeam
audire, quid Sanctu, Gregorius magnus affirmat, and quid Sanctus Leo confirmat,
and attendere quid Sanderus pronuntiauit; and quod pro hoc vno grauissimo
dogmate Joan. Roffensis and Tho. Morus duces ad Martyrium alijs extiterunt: and
quod non plus sapiam, quam oportet sapere: and quod forte lapsus fuerim non ex

Atque hac in re valde notatum fuit a me, quod Caietanus contra Parisienses
deposuerat, viz: Caietan. tom. 1. tract. 1. Apol. part. 2. cap. 13.
quia aliud est determinare do fide formaliter, and aliud de eo quod est fidei
materialiter. Nam primum importat determinare, quid credendum, vel non
credendu^ est; secundum autem, determinare de quaestionibus, quae in rebus
creditis accidunt: and constat cum determinatur quaestio aliqua secundo modo,
non determinari dicitur de fide, sed de tali, vel tali materia. Ideo cum
dicitur, quod Papa non potest errare in iudicio fidei, non accipio dictum esse,
nisi de iudicio fidei formaliter, quando scilicet determinatur quid credendum,
vel non credendum. Haec ille: ex quibus ego, subijciens me exquisuissimo
iudicio vestro colligo: Si de finiretur tanquam res fidei formaliter, scilicet
Papa habet potestatem deponendi Reges, indirecte, hoc est, in ordine ad
spiritualia; quod certe ex ea definitione in thesi, omnes tenerentur firmiter
illud credere. Sed si quaestio proponeretur in hypothesi: An Papa habeat
potestatem deponendi nostrum Regem, rebus in eo statu, quo nunc sunt,
permanentibus apud nos: sane videtur mihi (saluo acutiore iudicio) quod huius
quaestionis determinatio esset de eo, quod est fidei materialiter, quia esset
determinatio de quaestione, quae in rebus creditis accidit, and proinde non
diceretur determinatio de fide, sed de tali materia. Determinatio autem de re
fidei formaliter, nos ad credendum obstrictos tenet. Iam ego proiectus ad
synceritatem aequissimi Iudicij vestri, peto summopere ab Amplitudine vestra,
vt decernat vtrum aliqua in re, quae sit fidei formaliter, ego vacillauerim,
aut a cursu, in quo signata sunt doctissimorum Theologorum iudicia, deflexerim.

vel minimu^ signum extet, quod adiunctam aliquam deformitatem praeferat contra
fidem, aut quod aliquam syllabam imminuat in aliqua re fidei: aut quod aliquid
detrimenti adferat prohibitioni Diuinae: vel quod de rebus definitis circa
primatum summi Pontificis aliquantulum derogaret. Sane procul abest a nobis, vt
depasci veterem possessionem Apostolicae Sedis ab aliquo acuto homine aliquando
sineremus. Peto igitur bumillime ab Amplitudine vestra, vt haec tam grauia
contra me, praetexta ex filis parum aequioris coloris, discindantur, and
conuersa in fumum, euanescant. Senex sum, and in carcerem coniectus, propter
fidem Catholicam: and non noui me hactenus in vlla alia curricula deuenisse,
quam in illa, in quibus impressa sunt doctissimorum Catholicorum manifestissima

vociferationes aduersum me innocentem, and Apostolicae Cathedrae studiosissimum

Sed quo progredior? Certe paulo effusior videri possim in repetitione harum

The same in English.
Most reverend father in Christ, and most Illustrious Cardinal Bellarmine.
I Am much grieved, that your Illustrious Amplitude has conceived of me, being
imprisoned for the Catholic faith, so hard, and unto me so terrible an
opinion. Hitherto, through Gods grace, I have not wauered (that I remember) in
the least point, which certainly and definitely may appertain to the sublime
Majesty, and supreme authority of the Sea Apostolic. As touching the Oath,
I confess I have taken it, but in that sense, which is found approved in the
writings of Catholics, and is no way tainted with any spot of temeritie. For
the sense I relied on, being thrice repeated, and by the Magistrate accepted,
and since also published in print, is this: that the supreme Bishop has not an
Imperial and Civil power to depose our King, at his own pleasure and
appetite. Such a power the Catholic divines did never ascribe unto the most
holy Successor of S. Peter, as the most Illustrious of worthy memory
Cardinal Alane, and other commendable authors have Card. Alanus in respon. ad
Iustitiam Anglicanam. Sixtus Senens. in bihliotheca Sancta. S. R. cont. Tho.
Bell. R. P. cont. Morton, page 69.
to the memory of posterity recorded in their writings. Neither is there
cause why any man should have so much as the least suspicion, that the sense
aforesaid was admitted by the Magistrate, to the intent to deface, or impair,
or despoile the dignity Apostolic. Surely such apprehensions bred out of
jealousy, are for the most part deceitful Masters, and beget fear, where
there is no fear.

But to pursue my intended course: that also which is delivered by the most
Illustrious Cardinal Caietane in his answer to the Parisiens, Caietan. tom 1.
tract. 1. Apologiae part 2. cap. 13.
does concur unto my defense: that either of these points may truly be
determined concerning the Pope; both that he has a supreme power in matters
temporal, and that he has not a supreme power in matters temporal; because
they are both of them true in a right understanding. The affirmative is true,
in order to things spiritual; the negative is true directly, or as things
temporal are considered in themselves. So as there can no error grow by
either of the two decisions. Thus says he. And this opinion likewise the best
Catholic writers have inserted into their books: viz. that the Pope,
forasmuch as he is but of a finite and Alphons. Mendoza in relectione de Regno
and Dominio Christi. number. 15. Petrus de Arragon quaest. 67. art. 1.
bounded capacity, and is many times ignorant of the order and proportion of
temporal things, how they may make unto a spiritual end, is not therefore in
an absolute manner to have dominion over temporals, but only after a limited
and prescribed rule, as he is able, according to the measure of humane
intelligence, to discern how temporals may be available to things spiritual.
The same opinion do I find delivered by another sound Catholic author, in
these words: That the Popes power in Temporals is limited: and that he Joan.
Pedrezzanus in respons. ad Veneros.
may not dispose of them, but to a certain proportion, that is, so far as is
necessary for a spiritual end.

Seeing therefore the Popes power in temporals is in this sort tied and
restrained; why should we incur so heavy a reproof, for affirming that the
Pope has not power to depose our King: in as much as the perturbation of the
Church, and the overthrow of the Catholics with us, in their goods and
possessions, and the indamaging of many souls, were thereby like to ensue? Let
your Amplitude hear, not me, but the defender of your own assertion, against
the Venetians, whose words are these: The power of the highest Joan.
Pedrezzanus in Respons. ad Venetos.
Bishop is limited, that it may not dispose of temporals beyond the necessity
of a supernatural end. To these also may be adjoined your most excellent
Amplitudes own opinion: In regard of the persons, the Pope cannot, as he is
Pope, Joan. 5. de Romans Pontif. cap. 6.
by his. ordinary power, (though there be just cause) depose temporal
princes, in that manner as he deposes Bishops, that is, as their ordinary
Judge: but he may, as the supreme spiritual prince, alter kingdoms, take them
from one and give them to another, if need so require, for the saving of
souls. Which words do plainly strengthen our admittance of the Oath. For
the words of the oath are, that the Pope has not authority to depose the
King, or to dispose any of his Majesty's kingdoms, or dominions. And the
common understanding does with the Magistrate incline to no other conceit,
then to this: The Pope, as he is Pope: for it cannot reach unto that
construction; as he is the chief spiritual prince. And when the oath is
propounded to be taken, the sense thereof, apprehended by the Magistrate, is
restrained to an ordinary power. For they who exhibit the oath, are as far
as may be from any thought of an extraordinary or indirect power, residing in
the Pope.

Besides, if your Amplitudes most mild disposition could but in the least part
conceive the ruins of Catholic families, which the refusal of this oath
would bring upon us; assuredly you would not dissent from us, who by most
woeful examples do find, that from thence were like to proceed, not only
the loss and hazard of souls, but the lamentable extirpation of the whole
Catholic state amongst us. Since therefore we do sensibly find, that the
authority of the supreme Bishop, touching the deposition of our King, cannot
tend to the promoting of Spiritual matters, but to the overthrow of them: why
should we be thus shaken up, as having revolted from the Faith, and denied the
Primacie Apostolic, who maintain nothing, but what is generally concluded on
amongst Divines?

Suarez says: In sum, all these temporals Suarez. disput. 16. de Excommun.
mayor. sect. 1. Salmeron tom. 4. 416.
do fall but indirectly under the power spiritual, that is, in order unto a
spiritual end. And Salmeron: Peter's power is given only to edification, which
in other words is usually said: The key not erring. And speaking of the Popes
power, he says: If it tend to destruction, it is not ability Idem ibidem.
page 420.
or power, but impotencie and defect: we can do that which we can justly do.
Martinue Nauar. Relect. cap. Nouit. de Iudic. notab. 3. page 106.
Aspilcueta treating of Ecclesiastical power, has these words: It shall
therefore extend it self so far unto things temporal, as the order of
things supernatural does require, and no further. With these let Couarruuias
be ranged: Couar. tom. 2. page 506. number. 7.
The resolution of this question is plain, that we conclude, (the definition
of the Catholic Church ever reserved) that the Bishop of Rome has not either
actually, or habitually, a temporal jurisdiction, over the whole world, no not
over Christians themselves, further then may be necessary for the more
commodious, and easy use of the spiritual jurisdiction and power.

I might longer flote in this current of learned men, which does plenteously
flow out to my defense, concerning the Oath. For who so shall with an
indifferent eye behold the dangers we are in, would easily find, that the
power of the supreme Bishop, in the deposition of our King, cannot (as the case
stands) tall within the compass of any order, to releive things spiritual,
but breaks forth to the suppressing of all which has been hitherto well
settled in the same. Whence it may appear into how miserable a condition those
ouer-heauie and sharp animaduersions do cast me: that through the subtilties
of Satan I did consent, that the Primacie of the Sea Apostolic should be
either openly or covertly shot at: that the oath does in this Realm tend to
that end, that the authority of the head of the Church, might be transferred
in England from the Successor of S. Peter, unto the Successor of Henry 8:
that the faith may hereby be endangered: that I seem to have in some part
resembled the fall of S. Peter and S. Marcelline: that it is not a small matter
which by this oath is brought in danger, but one of the principal heads of
our faith, and foundations of Catholic religion: that I am to hear what S.
Gregory the great does affirm, and what S. Leo does confirm: and to attend
what Sanders has delivered: and that for this one most weighty point of
doctrine, John Bishop of Rochester, and Sir Tho. Moore were leaders unto others
to Martyrdom: that I be not wiser, then I ought to be: and that my slip did
peradventure proceed, not from any want of consideration, but from humane
frailty.

These things have I read with attention; bewailing my case, that such a heap
of censorious animaduersions is by you compacted against me, who cannot
comprehend or conceive, how any the least detriment may redound unto the
Primacie of the supreme Bishop, by that sense which I, with the acceptance of
the Magistrate, did propose before the taking of mine Oath. But if the words
seem not outwardly to yield so pleasing a sound; yet ought not the sense or
understanding to serve the words, but the words the understanding, as is
apparent out of the fiath book of Gregory's Decretals, de verborum
significatione.

Neither can I imagine, how by receiving that Oath, there can grow any danger
unto the faith: the same implying nothing, which may shadow out so much as a
resemblance, or show of any thing, which is formally a point of faith. For, as
Couarruuias, Martinus Couar. part 2. page 504. Nauar. vt ibidem not atur a
Couar. and vt patet in cap. Nouit. de iud. notab. Binsfeld. de iniuria and
damna dato. cap. 7. page 353. Alan. in respons. ad Just. Angl. fol. 326. b.
ab Aspilcueta, and Binsfieldius do affirm, there is no certainty as yet
defined by the Church, touching the Popes authority in things temporal. And
Cardinal Allen of famous memory says in this cause: It is a mere matter of
divinity, and of very near coherence with Christian religion, which although
it be not peradventure definitely resolved for our side: yet that it may and
uses to be by Theological arguments disputed on both parts, our adversaries,
if they know anything, cannot be ignorant. Thus says he. But perhaps
Innocentius 3. and Bonifacius 8. will be brought to press us with: but they
(as Bannes says) speak of power and Bannes in praeamb. de Dominio Christi.
page 92. de iure and iustitia.
dominion in order to things spiritual, when it shall be needful to use the
same; as may evidently appear unto him that will peruse the laws themselves:
and this is an indirect power, which does not reach unto our King: for the
affairs of England are now placed and settled in that state, as that all order
for the promoting of our spiritual affairs by the deposition of our King, is
quite extinguished: and therefore there would be care had, lest you procure
unto us a harder condition, then yet we are in. And to say truth,
notwithstanding Boniface his definition, the King of France (as is evident by
the ensuing declaration of Clement) did not lose any part of his Clemens de
priuileg. cap. Mcruit.
dignity, or ancient right: which Clement might not have done, if Boniface
his definition had proceeded from the chair, as a matter of faith formally.

And in this behalf I did heedfully observe, that which Caietane delivered
against the Caietan. tom 1. tract. 1. Apolog. part 2. cap. 13.
Parisiens viz: That it was one thing to determine de fide, formaliter, and
another to determine de eo quod est fidei, materialiter. For the former does
import, the determining of what is to be believed, or not to be believed: but
the latter, the deciding of questions which happen in things believed: and it
is clear, that when any question is determined, after the second manner, it is
not said to be a determination touching faith, but concerning such or such a
matter. When therefore it is said, that the Pope cannot err in a judgment of
faith; I do not take it to be spoken, but of a judgment of faith formally,
that is, when he determines, what is to be believed, or not to be believed.
Thus says he.

Out of which words I (submitting my self unto your most exquisite judgment)
do collect, that if it were defined, as a point of faith formally, that the
Pope has power to depose kings indirectly, that is, in order to things
spiritual; undoubtedly all men were by such a definition in thesi, in the
general position, bound firmly to believe it. But if the question were
propounded in hypothesi, that is, in the particular supposition, whether the
Pope has power to depose our king, matters continuing with us in the state
they now are in; surely me thinks (saving the judgment of sharper wits) that
the determination of this question were of a matter which is of faith
materially, it being the decision of a doubt, which happens in things
believed, and were not therefore to be called a determination concerning faith,
but touching such or such a matter: but it is a decision touching a point of
faith formally, which blinds us to believe it. Now therefore I, being humbly
prostrate at the sincerity of your most upright judgment, do earnestly
beseech your Amplitude, to judge whether I have staggered in any matter, which
is a point of faith formally, or have swarued from that course, wherein the
judgments of the most learned Divines are traced.

By what color then am I drawn into the society of S. Peter's, and S.
Marcellines fall? or why should Sanders be mentioned unto Sanderus de claue
David. cap. 9.
me, since I have followed his judgment in his book, de Claue David, where he
says, The sword of the Church was given to edification, and not to
destruction: to bestow life, not to bring death: to defend the flock, not to
annoy the sheep: to repel the woolfe, not to devour the lamb? And if I may
proceed in my defense; I see not by what reason, those words recited either
out of Gregory Nazianzene, or Basil the great, or Leo and Gregory the great, or
that laudable fact of Eleazarus, or the martyrdomes of Sir Tho. More, and John
Bishop of Rochester made famous by many men's writings, can be wrested against
me: seeing in my oath there is not the least sign, which may carry with it any
inconvenience against the faith, or impair any syllable in any point of faith,
or any whit empeach the divine prohibition, or may never so little derogate
from any matter which is defined, concerning the Primacie of the highest
Bishop. Surely it is far from me to suffer the ancient possessions of the Sea
Apostolic, to be at any time encroched upon by the wit or subtlety of any
man.

I do therefore very humbly entreat your Amplitude, that these so grievous
imputations against me, wrought with threedes of an vnsuting color, may be cut
asunder, and vanish into smoke. I am aged, and in durance for the Catholic
faith: and do not know, that I have hither to trod in any other paths, then
in those, wherein are imprinted the plainest footsteps of the most learned
Catholics. Bury therefore in silence (I beseech you) all those loud clamors,
sounding every where against me, that am innocent, and an earnest vpholder of
the chair Apostolic. Witness thereof my present imprisonment: witness my
often preachings: witness the perils I have undergone, for the dignity of the Sea Apostolic, in my sore-passed course of 32. years: witness the
administration of my Arch-priesthood, environed with the daily hazards of my
life.

But whither do I go? doubtless I may seem somewhat too lavish in ripping
up these matters before your Amplitude, who (as I trust) will now reduce your
seuerer censure of me and of my fact, to a better temper of equity and
commiseration. But I will conclude, and for the close will use that saying of
Leo: The privilege of Peter stands firm, where sentence is given, according
unto his equity. Neither is there too much severity, or remissenes, where
nothing is bound or loosed, but what S. Peter has either loosed or bound.

Our Lord Jesus preserve your Amplitude, to the greater enlargement of the
Catholic faith, and to our comfort. From London out of prison 13. Nouemb.

THE EXAMINATION OF Mr. George Blakwell, Taken at several times, according to
his Majesty's direction, upon occasion of his answer to Card. BELLARMINE.
He says,

1 THat because he perceives, that diverse exceptions are taken against his
late letter written to Cardinal Bellarmine; he is willing to set down his
judgment more fully, concerning the duty which all Subjects do owe to their
Sovereign Lords, under whom they were borne; and consequently all Catholics
Englishmen, unto his Majesty KING JAMES.

2 First he says, upon certain demands propounded unto him, That he
acknowledges all the precepts in the New Testament, as touching obedience to
Emperors, Kings, and Civil Magistrates, to be perpetual, and may not be
changed or qualified by any authority whatsoever, either Ecclesiastical or
Civil: and that what Subject soever, as well Ecclesiastical, as Lay does
violate any of them, upon any occasion, o^ at any time, or by virtue of any
dispensation, or o^ any intent, to profit thereby the Catholic cause and
advance Religion, or for any other cause whatsoever, he does therein sin
mortally: (...) ever being unlawful to do evil, that good might come of it.

3 That he utterly condemns all those who shall presume to affirm, that
either Christ or his Apostles did temporize in the said precepts as meaning
that Subjects were no longer bound to obey the Emperor, Kings, and souereign
Princes, being wicked, Apostatas, or heretics then until they were able by
force of Arms to suppress them: that impious conceit in those days being
far in his judgment from the godly Bishops and Christians then living.

4 That whereas in the Apostles times, and so afterward for the space of about
300. years the Emperors were not only Pagans themselue (except it were one of
them) and refused to embrace the Gospel, but likewise endeavored by all the
means they could, of cruelty, and mo^^ bloody persecution, to suppress the
propagation of it; forasmuch as the godly Bishops, Fathers, and Christians in
those days, having learned their duties of obedience from Christ and his
Apostles, neither taught nor put in practice any course of disobedience, nor
bare arms against them, though (as Tertullian says) they had sufficient
Tertull in Apolog. cap. 37.
force so to have done: he this Examinate does greatly approve such their
dutiful obedience; affirming, that in his judgment they had sinned mortally,
if they had done otherwise.

5 That even in the case of Julian (who, having first embraced the Gospel,
became afterward an Apostata) the godly Bishops, Fathers, and Christians in
those times, although some writ bitterly against him, yet they did not excite
his Subjects to bear arms against him, nor did themselves enter into any
rebellion: either of which courses, if they had attempted, this Examinate
thinks (as before) that they had greatly offended God, and broken the
precepts of Christ and his Apostles: adding, that therein he joined with S.
Augustine, where he speaks of the duty Augustine in Psalm. 124.
which Christians performed to Julian, though he were an Apostata: Iulianus
extitit infidelis Imperator. Nonne extitit Apostata, iniquus, Idololatra?
Milites Christiani seruiebant Imperatori infideli. Vbi veniebatur ad causam
Christi, non agnoscebant nisi illum, qui in coelo erat. Quando volebat, vt
Idola colerent, vt thurificarent; praeponebant illi Deum: quando autem dicebat,
Producite aciem, ite contra illam gentem, statim obtemperabant. Distinguebant
Dominum aetertum a domino temporali: and tamen subditi erant, propter Dominum
aeternum, etiam domino temporali. That is, Julian was an unbelieving Emperor.
Was he not an Apostata, an oppressor, and an Idolater? Christian Soldiers
served an unbelieving Emperor: when it came to the cause of CHRIST, they did
acknowledge none but him, that was in Heaven. When he would have them to
worship Images; and to sacrifice, they preferred God before him: but when he
said, Bring forth an Army, go against such a Nation, they forthwith obeyed.
They distinguished the eternal Lord from the temporal, and yet were subject
unto the temporal lord, for the Eternal.

6 This Examinate having thus declared his judgment in the premises; it was
demanded of him, whether he had seen the Popes last Breue, dated at Rome, 10.
Calend. September. 1607. beginning, Renunciatum est etc. and what, upon the sight
thereof, his judgment now was, as touching the lawfulness of the oath of
Allegiance before by him taken. Whereupon he says, that he has only seen
a Copy of the said last Breue: that he has very carefully perused, and
weighed every sentence and clause in it, and that nevertheless he remains
steadfastly in his former opinion and judgment, viz. That it is lawful for all
Catholics in England to take the said oath of Allegiance, published the last
Session but one of this present Parliament, and that he constantly is fetled,
as touching every part and member of the said oath, formerly by him taken, that
they are true: and that this he does acknowledge, without any equivocation, or
mental evasion, or secret reservation whatsoever, to all intents and purposes,
as if he should here again have repeated the said oath at large.

7 This Examinate being here required, forasmuch as in his justification of the
said oath, and of his taking of it, since his sight of the last Breue, he does
rely upon his former opinion and judgment; which notwithstanding in the
Letter written to Cardinal Bellarmine, he does strangely qualify (contrary
to the expectation had of him here for his plain dealing and sincerity:)
that therefore he should deliver the grounds and reasons of his said judgment,
why he first advised the Romish Catholics to take that oath, with an assurance
given by virtue of his authority, that it was lawful for them so to do: for
answer hereunto he says, that the effect of the reasons sent by him to Rome
(as he said in his Examination now published in Print, and a brief abstract
whereof he delivered to certain of the Lords of his Majesty's most honorable
priuse Counsel) was grounded upon the points following.

8 It is well known (says he) to all that be learned, and will be granted
without any contradiction, that the Pope may not proceed with Princes,
otherwise then is behoouefull for the Church. Forasmuch then as he may be
oftentimes ignorant (as Alphonsus Mendoza faith) whether Alphons. Mendoza.
the order and proportion of temporal things do indeed tend directly and
truly in finem spiritualem, to a spiritual end, and for the good of the
Catholic Church; and that he cannot otherwise discern of such circumstances,
but secundum humanum intelligentiaemodu^, according to the measure of humane
intelligence: and besides, for that he may err in hijs iudicijs quae ad
particularia facta pertinent, in those judgments which concern particular
facts, (as Couarruuias affirms) and the rather because the Pope (as this
Examinate fears) Couarruu. tom. 1. page 184.
though he has all things at commandment, does yet stand in these days in
need of one thing, observed heretofore by a grave Bishop, viz. of a faithful
Counselor always at hand to tell him the truth: for it may be doubted, lest
Rodericus Episcopus Zamorae in speclo humanae vitae. lib. 2. cap. 3.
now it happen, as it did in the said Bishops days, that from the highest to
the lowest, every one is given to soothe him up: they tell him smooth tales,
but many do deceive him: in these respects therefore this Examinate is of
opinion, that the Popes proceedings may oftentimes be justly misliked, and
refused.

9. And to this purpose, this Examinate further Summa Syluest. in verbo
obedientia number. 5.
says, that he is fully of Syluesters mind and judgment, where he truly
says, and resolutely affirms, that if the Pope should command any thing that
does sapere peccatum, savor of sin, were it but a venial sin, (the Pope
supposing his commandment to be just) he were not to be obeyed therein, when
those that are so commanded by him, do know his commandment to be unjust:
that if by obeying the Pope it may be vehemently presumed, that great trouble
will ensue to the state of the Church, or that some other evil or future
scandal may thereby arise: the Pope in that case is not to be obeyed, although
his commandment be enjoined to be observed sub poena excommunicationis latae
sententiae: under pain of excommunication ipso facto. And again, that if the
Pope should command a thing under pain of Excommunication, ex cuius
executione praesumitur scandalum animarum vel corporum futurum in ciuitate; non
est ei obediendum: by the execution whereof it is presumed that some detriment
will ensue in that city, unto the souls, or bodies of men: he is not therein
to be obeyed;

10. Out of which the premises (being well considered) this Examinate says,
that the State of ENGLAND weighed, as now it is, if the Pope upon any
instigation should excommunicate his Majesty, depose him from his Crown,
release his Subjects from their obedience, and command them under pain of
Excommunication to bear arms against him, etc. although he the said Pope were
persuaded, that such his proceedings and commandments were just: yet forasmuch
as the Catholics here in England of any understanding, might easily perceive
and discern, that such an Excommunication should sapere peccatum, or might
vehemently be suspected, that it would procure a great perturbation of the
state of the Church, or produce some other evil, or future scandal; and that
the execution of it would bring with it (by presumption) a great detriment or
scandal to the souls or bodies of Catholics: they were not bound in those
cases, to regard the said Excommunication, or any thing therein contained, at
the least, to put the same in execution: it being a general and a true rule,
that Peter's power was given him only, ad aedificationem, to edification: quod
alijs verbes solet dici, claue non errante: which in other words is usually
said, the key not erring, as Salmeron has well observed: for as he further
says, if it be used in destructionem, Salmer. tom. 4. page 416. and 420.
to destruction, non est potestas, aut potentia, sed impotentia, and defectus:
hoc possumus, quod iure possumus: It is not ability or power, but impotencie
and defect: we can do that, which we can justly do: as this Examinate has
written in his Letter to the Cardinal.

11 And with relation to the Popes humane intelligence, Syluester his
positions, with the other circumstances and cautions mentioned, this Examinate
says, that he writ to Cardinal Bellarmine in this sort, viz. that the Pope
has no power to depose his Majesty, quia inde perturbatio Ecclesiae, and ever
sio Catholicorum nostrorum in bonis and possessionibus, and detrimenta
plurimarum animarum prouenirent: because the perturbation of the Church, and
the overthrow of the Catholics with us, in their goods and possessions, and
the damage of very many souls would thereby ensue, And again, Si Amplitudinis
vestrae mitissima dispositio vel minima ex part conciperet ruinas familiarum
Catholicarum, quas inferret recusatio iuramenti; certe non dissentiret a nobis,
qui ex luctuosissimis spectaculis videmus, inde profecturam esse non modo
iacturam animarum, sed etiam totius status Catholici apud nos lamentabilem
extirpationem. That is, If your Amplitudes most mild disposition did but in
the least part conceive the ruins of Catholic families, which the refusal of
that oath would bring upon us, surely you would not dissent from us, who by
most woeful spectacles do find, that from thenee were like to proceed, not
only the hazard and loss of many souls, but the most lamentable extirpation
of the whole Cathoplicke state amongst us. And presently after, Deositie
Regisnostri non esset, in ordine ad spiritualia promouenda, sed euertenda: That
is, the deposition of our King would not tend to the order of promoting matters
spiritual, but of overthrowing them. Moreover, Qui aequo oculo pericula nostra
intueretur, facile aduerteret, potestatem summi Pontificis, in depositione
Regis nostri, iam contineri non posse intra fines ordinis ad spiritualia
subleuanda, sed excurrere ad supprimenda omnia, quae hactenus in spiritualibus
been posita fuerunt. That is, Who so should with an indifferent eye behold the
dangers we are in, would easily perceive, that the Popes power in deposing our
King, cannot as the case stands, be contained within the bounds of any order
for the advancing of spiritual matters, but does rather break forth to the
suppressing of all, which has been hitherto well settled in things spiritual.

12. Now upon these said grounds and some others, (needless then to have been
sent to Rome) he this Examinate says, that he doubts not, but that all
Catholics in England might and may still take the said oath of Allegiance,
there being no one clause in it, which, by the doctrine and exceptions here
above mentioned, may not well and truly be justified. Besides, this Examinate
says, he did then chiefly stand upon the grounds mentioned, because they were
most perspicuous and apparent, even to the simplest sort of Catholics, and
were likely to find some good acceptance at Rome, the same being in every
branch of them agreeable to the doctrine, in this behalf there allowed and
maintained.

13 Of the insufficiency of this answer, it was told him, he should
afterward hear more. In the mean time it being demanded of this Examinate,
why he himself, at the time that he took the said oath, did seem to rely
upon his Majesty's speeches, delivered in Parliament 19. of May 1603: whereas
he had before taught the Romish Catholics, and sent his reasons to Rome to
that end, to prove it to be lawful for them to take that oath, without any
such reference to his Majesty's speeches: he answering says, 1. that before
he ever resolved any Catholic of the lawfulness of that oath, he had heard
of his Majesty's said speeches, though he did not allege and specify them to
any, before he came himself to take that oath. 2. that at his own taking of
the oath, he did in part rely upon them, and so professed, because he
supposed, that thereby he should stay some men's over hasty, and precipitate
conceits of his taking that oath, and suspend their opinions of his meaning
therein, foreseeing what great opposition was like to be made against him (as
he touched in his sixth Examination already in print) for yielding thereunto,
especially after the diuulging of the Popes first Breue, and some other
letters, aduising all Catholics to the contrary. 3. that being in prison, he
thought it his best course (if he could) both to satisfy the State, and to
content the Catholics; which made him to take hold of any fit occasion, that
might avail him to that end, doing nothing therein against the truth, though
he concealed by that means some part of it, which now he perceives will be
drawn from him, to some men's dislike he fears, but (as he hops) to Gods
glory, the discharge of his conscience, and the good of all grave and moderate
Catholics.

14. Here, upon occasion, because this Examinate found, that it was ascribed
unto him, as a fault, in that he being a prisoner should write to a man of
Cardinal Bellarmines rank, without notice first given thereof to the State:
he was very earnest, before any more questions were demanded of him, that he
might have license to deliver his mind in that behalf. Which being yielded
unto, he says: that being charged by the Cardinal to have in a sort denied
the Popes Supremacy, in that he took the oath of Allegiance: and having
certain places urged against him to that purpose out of Leo and Saint
Gregory: forasmuch as he this Examinate perceives thereby, that the said
Cardinal did not distinguish betwixt the oath of the Kings Supremacy (so
termed) made 1. Eliz. and the oath of Allegeanee set out 3. of his Majesty;
the first being ordained for the abolishing altogether of the authority in
causes Ecclesiastical, out of this Realm, and the second, without any
relation at all to the former, only seeking to prevent certain inferences
therein mentioned, which were supposed might ensue, by virtue of an
Excommunication, and did tend to the great hazard, and endangering of his
Majesty's person (as it is supposed) and to the misleading and overthrow of
many of his Subjects: he this Examinate thought himself bound in conscience
to write an answer to the said Cardinal, as well for the clearing of himself
in that point (he being ready, if he had twenty lives, to yield them all in
defense of the Popes supremacy in causes Ecclesiastical) as also for the
satisfaction of so great a person, for whose hard opinion of him he would be
right sorry. And therefore touching his fact herein, if it be thought amiss
of, he humbly craves pardon.

15. Now as concerning the insufficiency of this Examinates answer, touching
his reasons sent to Rome, for the lawfulness of taking the oath of Allegiance,
consisting of the Popes humane intelligence subject to error, Syluesters
resolutions, how no such course, as is pretended in the oath of Allegiance
could be undertaken against his Majesty by the Pope, (the present state of
England considered) because the same should tend, not to edification but to
destruction: it was told this Examinate, that all these points so well by him
enlarged, did come far short of the meaning of the said oath: because it is
very uncertain, what the Romish Catholics in England would do, if the Pope
should de facto proceed with his Majesty, as some of his predecessors did
with the late Queen of worthy memory; which uncertainty the State may not
endure. For although the wiser, and more provident sort of Romish Catholics
might in that case for a time draw back: yet what the seduced multitude were
like enough to do, if they were able; that is to be foreseen and provided
for. Besides, it may well be doubted, what the said tempotizers would do, if a
fit opportunity ferued them. Moreover, of what force this conceit was to
restrain the late most horrible Traitors, Catesby, Garnet, and the rest, from
their most barbarous and savage designements, it is apparent. It is the truth
without color, that must either direct men's consciences, or else it is but
daubing with untempered mortar: nothing but mischief is to be expected from
them. Howbeit suppose the best of this devise and evasion. If the Pope well
assisted, did account and determine any extremity to be undertaken against his
Majesty, to be in ordine ad spiritualia, it is more then probable, that his
word and judgment would be rather accepted of by the greater number, then
that private men's exceptions and limitations would at such a time be able to
prevail, or be of any moment. For the preventing of all which kind of
mischiefs, it is most apparent, that amongst other respects for the
preservation of his Majesty and the State, the said oath (upon the said most
barbarous occasion, that ever was given to any King, either heathen or
Christian) was ordained.

16 And therefore this Examinat being here required, that for the better
contentment of the State in whose hands he is, and for the truth sake,
wherewith God is honored, he should open his mind simply and plainly, why in
writing to the Cardinal, he tells him, that he took the oath in this sense:
Summum Pontificem non habere Imperialem and Ciuilem potestatem ad libitum, and
ex suo appetitu deponendi Regem nostrum: That the Pope has not an Imperial
and Civil power, to depose our King, when he pleases, and at his own
appetite: suggesting, that the said oath had no other meaning: and that this
sense was thrice insisted upon (before he this Examinat took the said oath)
and allowed of by the Magistrate: whereas the words of the oath (which he this
Examinat took, for ought that appeared to the contrary, without any
equivocation, or mental evasion whatsoever) are clear and manifest, viz. That
the Pope neither of himself, nor by any authority of the Church or See of
Rome, has any power or authority to depose the King. The oath says, that the
Pope has no power by any authority of the Church or See of Rome, viz: neither
Imperial, Civil, nor Ecclesiastical, whereas this Examinat tells the
Cardinal, that he only swear against his Imperial, and Civil power, whereby
he might not so proceed with his Majesty.

17. With these particular exceptions, this Examinate being somewhat troubled,
desired again, that before he came to the answering of them, he might a little
(as by the way) bewail himself, and his present estate: which he did in
manner as follows, saying:

That it was no little grief unto him to be apprehended, and cast into prison;
that thereupon he hoped his former troubles and oppositions against him would
have ceased: that notwithstanding, as matters are prosecuted, and his
proceedings interpreted, he receives nothing but discomfort from each side:
that his friends might have been content, to have expounded his oath in the
best part, and the rather, because they perceived he found thereby, that he
had given some reasonable contentme^t to the State, for the ease of his
imprisonment (being an old man, and troubled with many bodily infirmities) and
for the avoiding of some further extremities: that Cardinal Bellarmine might
well have forborne his Letter unto him. as also his sharp censures of him, as
if by taking the said oath he had fallen with Peter, in denying his Master,
and with Marcellinus, who offered a false sacrifice, and that thereby he this
Examinate had brought in question one of the chief heads of faith, and
foundations of Catholic religion: that he the said Cardinal might easily
have foreseen, that albeit there had been no copies of his Letter taken,
before it came to him this Examinate, yet that such a vigilant eye is had over
him in prison, as that it is almost impossible for him to have kept it
undiscovered, especially there being such bruites of it cast abroad, as there
were, even by those that should have concealed it: that likewise the said
Cardinal might not only well have thought, that if it happened his Letter to
be diuulged, more hurt then good was likely thereof to ensue, except he thought
it fit to bring him (this Examinate) into greater hatred, then he was before
(which could not avail the common cause) and to provoke his Majesty to some
greater extremities, then of his most mild and temperate disposition he is
inclined unto; but likewise that it was his this Examinates part in all duty
to answer his Letter, which would be also (as it has now fallen out) as
impossible (his case considered) for him this Examinate to perform with any
secrecy, as it was, that his the said Cardinals Letter should come vndiscryed
unto this Examinate: that as he greatly suspecteth, the Cardinals said Letter
was cunningly opened, before it came to his this Examinates hands; so he is
persuaded, that his answer unto it will be used in the like sort, before it
come to the Cardinal: and the rather he so thinks, for that he finds
already the copy of it by skill and practice, to be as soon published abroad
here in England, as this Examinate could dispatch it for Rome; which does
greatly perplexe him, and what may be the issue of it, he knows not, but
fears (as he says) the worst at al hands: that notwithstanding, come what
shall come, his hopes being past (which were never great) his liberty
restrained, (never to be recovered) the grave expecting him (which he most
desires) no joys, nor comforts but in his blessed Savior, he is resolved
with patience to expect and undergo it: that these and many other such courses
held with him, do oftentimes exceedingly grieve and trouble him, in that men
abroad and at liberty, have no more care of poor men, imprisoned for those
causes, which they would seem most earnestly to affect: and that thus having
eased a little his heart, and referring himself, and his cause to God, he will
now address himself to answer all the parts of the objection above
mentioned, syncerely and truly from the bottom of his heart, as becomes a
true Catholic priest, and as he is persuaded in his conscience, without any
equivocation, or evasion, and without regard or fear of any men's persons, or
of any inconvenience, or further danger, that might thereby ensue unto him, or
of any slanderous imputations, which he does easily foresee will be heaped upon
him, of purpose to discredit both him, and that which he finds he must
needs acknowledge, except he should wilfully deny the truth, or show
himself obstinate and perverse against lawful authority, which his present
estate, and conscience will not permit.

18 And therefore now as touching his this Examinats signification unto
Cardinal Bellarmine, that the effect of his oath was: Summum Pontificem non
habere Imperialem and ciuilem potestatem ad libitum, and ex suo appetitu
deponendi Regem nostrum: That the Pope has not an Imperial and civil power
to depose our King, when he pleases, and at his own appetite: he will (as he
says) answer the same, not in gross, but by degrees, saying first; That
amongst diverse prerogatives attributed to the Pope in temporalibus in
temporalties, this is one, which cannot be well denied by any, viz. that the
Pope is truly lord of all the temporalties belonging to the Bishopric of
Rome. Within the compass whereof there are some who have included England and
Ireland, and one especially, whose memory this Examinate does greatly honor:
but yet he must needs acknowledge his oversight in that point. Thus he
writes: Without the approbation of the Sea Apostolic, none can be lawful
King or Queen Admonit. to the Nobility by Card. Allen 1588. page 8.
of England, by reason of the ancient accord, made between Alexander the
third, the year 1171. and Henry the second, then King, when he was absolved
for the death of Saint Thomas of Canterbury: that no man might lawfully take
that Crown, nor be accounted as King, till he were confirmed by the
Sovereign Pastor of our souls, which for the time should be: this accord
afterward being renewed about the year 1210, by king John, who confirmed the
same by oath to Pandulphus the Popes Legate, at the special request and
procurement of the Lords and Commons, as a thing most necessary, for
preservation of the Realm from unjust usurpation of Tyrants, and avoiding
other inconveniences, which they had proved, and might easily fall again, by
the disorder of some wicked king. Unto this report, as it seems, and to some
other idle conceits a Polonian of late having relation, and making mention of
the purpose aforesaid, of king Henry the second, and of king John, he writes
(this Examinate says) in this sort, speaking of the Parliament, and of the
oath of Allegiance: Illud impie legislatores per iusiurandum extorquent a
Stanisla. Cristanouie Examen Cathol. fol. 34.
Catholicis, vt negent posse a Pontifice Regem deponi, and de ipsius Regnis and
ditionibus disponi. Si enim honorarie and pie tributarium regnum Pontifici,
quare disponere, quare refractarium, and inobedientem Principem deponere
nequit? That is, The lawmakers do impiously by an oath extort this from the
Catholics, to deny that the King may be deposed by the Pope, and his
kingdoms and countries by him disposed of. For if by an honorable and pious
grant, the kingdom have become tributarie to the Pope: why may he not dispose
of it? why may he not depose the Prince, being refractarie and disobedient?

19 Concerning the which aforesaid assertions, touching both the said kings,
this Examinate affirms, they are untrue. Henry the second never made any such
accord with Alexander the 3. as is above mentioned, for ought this Examinate
could ever read in any Chronicle of credit. He swear to Pope Alexander, that
he (for his own part) would not depart from him, or his successors, To.
Houeden Annal fol. 303
quamdiu ipsum sicut Regem Catholicum habuerint: so long as they should
entreat him as a Catholic king. And touching king John, inasmuch as his fact
that way is of some more probability, but of as little truth, and that from
the said reports of them both, Stanislaus Cristanouic does infer, that the
Pope may depose his Majesty, being but a tributarie King unto him; he this
Examinate, by taking his oath, that the Pope had no Imperial, or Civil power
over the king, to depose him, did thereby discharge his conscience, for the
justifying of a truth against the said false reports; that of king John being
as untrue as the former. Which this Examinate says he does the more boldly
affirm, because he has one of no small account, (in that he died for the
Popes supremacy) to take his part therein: besides some other rules of
regalitie in that behalf. Thus Sir Thomas More writes against the author of
the Beggars Supplication, in king Henry the 8. time: If he (the author of that
supplication) Sir Tho. More supplic of souls page 296.
say, as indeed some writers say, that king John made England and Ireland
tributarie to the Pope and the Sea Apostolic, by the grant of a thousand
marks: we dare surely say again, that it is untrue, and that all Rome
neither can show such a grant, nor never could: and if they could, it were
nothing worth: For never could any king of England give away the Realm to the
Pope, or make the land tributarie, though he would. And this to be agreeable
to this Examinates own judgment, he does acknowledge (as he says) with all
his heart; hoping that the same shall no way prejudice his constant resolution,
as touching the Popes supremacy, nor offend any that loves the Crown and
State of England.

20 And as concerning his relying upon his Majesty's words, in the sense,
approved by the Magistrate, when he this Examinate took the oath of
Allegiance, and insinuating to Cardinal Bellarmine, that the sum of it was
accordingly: Summum Pontificem non habere Imperialem and ciuilem potestatem ad
libitum, and ex suo appetitu deponendi Regem nostrum: that the Pope has not an
Imperial and civil power to depose our King, when he pleases, and at his
own appetite: he hops likewise to give therein some reasonable contentment.
For which purpose he says, it is to be observed, that there is an opinion long
since broached by the Canonists, which has begun of later times to be more
stiffely, and with greater heat prosecuted and maintained, then heretofore,
concerning the Popes authority in causes temporal: the authors whereof do
with great confidence affirm, that the Pope is as directly Lord of the whole
world in temporalibus, in temporalties, as he is the head of the universal
Church in spiritualibus, in matters spiritual: and that he has directly as
sovereign an authority, in respect of such his worldly dominion, over all
Emperors, Kings, and Princes, to dispose of them and their kingdoms, when
occasion shall require; as he has, in regard of his spiritual supremacy,
over all Bishops and Clergy men, to advance and deprive them, when he
thinks it convenient, and that they deserve it. The chief patrons of this
opinion are noted by Cardinal Bellarmine to be these, Augustinus Triumphus,
Aluarus (...)
Pelagius, Hostiensis, Panormitane, and Syluester: to whom this Examinate does
add, Henricus Gandauensis, Redericus Sancius, Alexander Alensis, Celsus
Mancinus, Tho. Bozius, Franciscus Bozius, Isidorus Mosconius, Card Baronius,
Laelius Zecchus, and Alexander Carerius, who names diverse others as principal
defenders of that opinion; and (...)
is himself so violent therein, as he does in effect anathematize all, that
do oppose themselves against it, not sparing Cardinal Bellarmine himself:
against whom, forasmuch as his drift is principally, throughout his whole
book, he was much to blame (this Examinate thinks) to entitle it to be
written aduersus impios politicos, and nostritemporis haereticos, against the
wicked politickes and heretics of our time. With this Carerius, (...)
such as are on that side do resolutely concur: insomuch as they doubt not
(this Examinat consesseth) to renew again the long disliked, and impugned
assertions of the old Canonists, and to publish them now unto the world more
eagerly, then heretofore (as above he has touched) for sound and Catholic
doctrine; they saying:

21 That David did foretell, that the Priesthood of (...) Anno 57. page 432.
Christ, should be according to the order of Melchisedech: That when Christ,
being a King and a Priest, received all judgment of the Father, that is, most
full judicial power: he joining the same with his priesthood, did institute
in the Church a Regal priesthood, Bar. Ibidem page 433.
translating in suos, (that is, to S. Peter and his successors) all the power
he had of his father: That Franc Bezius de temporal Ecclesiae Monarchia, in
praesat. ad Clemen. S.
except there should be one supreme Monarch in the Church in all things, the
unity of the Church could not be preserved: for seeing the Church, by divine
institution, does consist of a Kingdom, and a Priesthood; is it were
otherwise, there should be in the same absolutely one Monarch of the Kingdom,
and another of the Priesthood: That if, for the avoiding of the dissensions
about sacred causes, one supreme head is appointed; why not in the same manner
of the Kingdom, that there should be one and the same head both of the
Kingdom and Priesthood, lest in like sort there should be dissension betwixt
them? that therefore it is the rather to be held, that Peter does supply
Christ's place, not only in the Priesthood, but in the Kingdom, that he might
be a King and likewise a Priest, according to the order of Melchisedech, who
was both a King and a Priest.

22 That if Christ be King of kings, and Lord of Tho. Bozius de iure status
praefat. ad Aldehrard.
lords; in like sort the Church must be Queen and Lady; and if he be the Lord
of all temporalities, she likewise must be the Lady: That all temporal regal
power does reside first in the soul of Christ, and then in the Idem ibidem.
Church his spouse, the Queen of the world, and from her is derived to others,
(faithful or infidels) as out of a fountain: That the Church, the spouse of
Christ and Idem lib. 1. cap. 6 sol. 36.
Queen of the world, may as often as the order of the whole does require, etc.
transfer the proper rights of one unto another, as a secular Prince may cast
down private men's houses, for the beautifying of the City, or impose tribute,
for the weal public; that he may thus justly do, although he has not erred,
from whom such rights are transferred unto another: so the Pope gave the
Spaniards the Indians: That the Pontifical and Isidor. Moscon. de may.

Regal power, and all other powers are most plentiful in the Pope, and do
reside in the Pontifical dignity: that all Dominions whatsoever do depend
upon the Church, and upon the Pope, as the head of the Church: and that in the
Pope, authority is considered, in Emperors, Idem page 670.
and Kings power, and thence it is, that power does depend upon authority.

was Lord over all inferiors, not only as God, but likewise as man, having
even then dominion in the earth; and that therefore, as the dominion of the
world was in Christ both divine and humane, so it must be confessed, that it
was in the Pope, his Vicar: That as God in a secondarie manner, may be called a
temporal ruler and Idem page 112.
Monarch of the world, although in himself, he is not principally worldly, or
temporal: so the Pope may be called a temporal Lord, and Monarch, although

administration of his kingdom, and S. Peter did execute that his power against

the Lord over all the world in temporalties, and that therefore the Pope is so
likewise, in that he is his Vicar: That the supreme power of judging all, and
the top of Idem page 126.
dignities, and the height of both powers are found in Christ's vicar.

24 That there is one principality, and one supreme Rodericus Sancius apud
Carer. pa. 132.
Prince over all the world, who is Christ's vicar, according to that of Daniel,
chap. 8. He has given him power, and honor and rule, and all people and
tongues shall serve him: and that in him therefore is the fountain and spring
of all principality, and from him all other powers do flow: That the Bishop
of Idem ibidem page 131. 132.
Rome in place of Christ is set as a Prince over the whole world in
spiritualties and temporalties, and that it is naturally, morally, and by the
law of God to be held with a right faith, that the principality of the Bishop
of Rome is the true, and only immediate principality of the whole world, not
only as touching things spiritual, but likewise temporal; and that the
Imperial principality is depending upon it, as being mediate, ministerial,
and isntrumental, ministering and serving it; and that it is ordained and
instituted by it; and at the commandment of the Papal principality is
mooueable, reuocable, corrigible, and punishable.

25 That as the divine and humane dominion were Carerius de potest. Romans Pont.
page 150.

earth, so he cannot deny, but that he is Lord over all things, because the
earth is the Lords and the fullness thereof, whereby all things, heavenly,
earthly, and infernal are subject unto Christ the Lord: and thence it is, that
he did commit unto the Pope (who does supply his place upon earth) the right
of the heavenly and terrene Empire. That the Pope by the Law of God has Iael.

power and temporal dominion over the whole world: that the same is proved by
the words of Luc. 22. Behold, here are two swords, which signify the power
temporal and spiritual: and because Christ, whose vicar the Pope is, has
both powers, according to the words, Matthew. vlt. All power is given unto me in
heaven and in earth; That thence it may be deduced, that the Pope is absolutely
the Lord of all the Christian world; and Kings and Christian princes are to
acknowledge, that they hold of him their Empires and kingdoms, and all that
are faithful ought to be subject unto him: And that as often as such princes do
any great hurt in the Church, the Pope may deprive them of their kingdoms, and
transfer their right to others.

26 It is here to be observed, of what great reputation in Rome and Italy the
authors are, whose opinions this Examinate does dislike. For to omit Baronius
the late Cardinal, Francis Bozius his book was approved in Rome very
authentically to be printed; as containing nothing in it adverse to the
Catholic faith: and with the like approbation, the book of Thomas Bozius was
printed in Rome: and so was that of Celsus Mancinus. Mosconius his book was
printed at Venice, before the stirs betwixt them and the Pope: and the
tractate of Laelius Zecchus was printed at Brixia. Carerius a Doctor of Padua,
had his book approved at Padua, though it was afterward printed at Colein.
Whereupon it was thought meet, by the Examiner, (for whom it was thought as
lawful, to object what he thought fit, as sor Master Blakwell to frame his
own answers, according to his own mind) to offer unto his further
consideration sundry other speeches of his said authors, and some others of the
like authority, the same being as pertinent to his purpose, as the former by
himself alleged; where they say, as follows:

27 That the supreme Jurisdiction temporal Franc. Bozius de temporali
Ecclesiae Monarchia. lib. 1. cap. 3. fol. 52. Idem lib. 1. cap. 7. fol. 98.
throughout all the world, does belong to S. Peter's successors: so as one and
the same is the Hierarch and Monarch in all things: That Christ left the Church
to be governed by the best form of government: but the best form of
government is the absolute Monarchy, even in all temporal things; therefore
Christ left his Church so to be governed: That the keys of heaven Idem lib. 2.
cap. 14. Idem lib. 3. cap. 1 fol. 394.
were given to Peter; therefore of all the earth: That the right of dominion,
and prelation of infidels may justly, by the sentence and ordination of the
Church, be taken away; because Infidels, by reason of their infidelity, do
deserve to lose their power over the faithful: That the Church has received
that power over Idem ibidem cap. 14 fol. 530.
nations, which Christ according to his humane nature received of the Father:
but Christ received absolutely of the Father all power in temporalibus;
therefore the Church likewise received it by participation of his fullness:
That the supreme power coactiue in all Idem ibidem cap. 16. fol. 537.

revealed and expressed in the Scriptures: That kings anointed with holy oil

things, temporal laws may be made by the Church, and kingdoms taken away for
just causes.

Church, and of her chief Bishops: That warlike and military compulsiue power
is given to the Church over kings and princes: That if it be found sometimes,
that certain Emperors have given some temporalties to the highest Bishops, as
Constantine gave unto Syluester, this is not to be understood, that they gave
any thing which was their own, but restored that which was vntustly, and
tyrannically taken from the said Bishops: That Christ committed to Saint Peter
(the carrier of the keys of eternal life) the right both of the Idem lib. 4.

that he is without doubt an heretic, that takes away the rights of the
terrene and celestial Empire, committed by Christ to the Church of Rome, and
says it is lawful so to do; and for that he shall be an heretic in such
his assertions.

of kings, and lord of lords: That the Pope is consecrated, as the great
Priest, and crowned as a king, because he has both powers: That the Pope does
use his power after two sorts, either absolutely or ordinarily; absolutely,
when he derogateth from laws, in abolishing them; ordinarily, when he uses
laws. Whence this rule is given, that the Pope uses the Counsel of his
Cardinals, when he will live by his laws: But if he will use the plenitude
of his power, then he disposes of matters, without the Counsel of his
Cardinals, since his power is of God, and not of the College of Cardinals: That
not only all faithful people, but likewise Infidels, Idem page 96
and every natural creature is subject to the commandment of the Pope; he is
to be worshipped of all men: and for this cause he receives of all the
faithful adorations, prostrations, and kissings of his feet: That Idem page

30 That by the law of God and nature, the Priesthood does ouer-top the

them both, depend upon the Priesthood, both by the law of God and of nature:
That Antoninus apud Carer. page 130.
they which say, the Pope has dominion over all the world in spiritualties,
but not in temporalties, are like the Counselors of the king of Syria, who

that, through terror of discipline, which the Priest cannot effect by power of

32 That in the highest Bishop, both the powers and ^^ls. Mancinus lib. 3. cap.

Jurisdictions are, spiritual and temporal, and that as he is the most
eminent person of all men in spiritual power, so is he in temporal: so that
it may lawfully be affirmed of Christ's Vicar, by a certain similitude, that
Plato in Timaeus said of God: asking in Timaeus, what was God: he answers, he
is not a man, nor heaven, nor good, but something better: if one ask whether
the highest Bishop be a Duke, a king, an Emperor, or a Prince, he shall answer

and all creatures, and therefore the Pope his vicar, has so.

33 With the offering of these speeches to this Examinates consideration, he was
much offended, saying, that now he perceives, it is more sought to bring him
into hatred, then to make proof of his true Allegiance: because these things
are only produced in scorn of his Hol. (as he conceiueth) in defense of whose
Supremacy in spiritual causes, he is ready to yield his life: and therefore
answered plainly, that he thought himself very hardly dealt with in this
point. But reply being made, that his said offense taken, and coffeehouse
thereupon uttered seemed very strange, how it was come to pass with him, that
those things which are published to the world by so many, and with so great an
approbation in Rome, to no other end, but that all the world should take notice
of them, so much disquiet and trouble him, by the very repetition of them.

34 Whereunto this Examinate says, that the repeating of the said speeches
does not so much move him, as the drift whereat they aim. For if that which
is sufficient might give contentment, (these speeches, produced out of the
authors by him cited, agreeing in effect, with that which he himself had
alleged out of them) he did before declare his opinion of them; when he
termed them, the long-since disliked and impugned assertions of the Canonists:
and more (he says) by the offering of them to his consideration, cannot well
be required of him, it being no way apperteining any more unto him, to censure
the flatterers of the Pope, then of Kings and Princes, who to please them, do
oftentimes no doubt say more then is true. Whereupon he adds, that whatsoever
he did cite out of the said authors, he did it with much grief, and would not
so far have enlarged himself therein, had he not conceived, that his
Majesty had an especial respect unto this opinion of the Popes direct
authority in temporalibus, so highly advanced above all kings and Emperors,
when he used in Parliament these words in effect: viz. that by the doctrine
of the Popes supremacy he (the said Pope) does not only claim to be
spiritual head of all Christians, but also to have an Imperial Civil power
over all Kings and Emperors, dethroning and decrowning princes with his foot,
as pleases him, and dispensing and disposing of all kingdoms and Empires at
his appetite: and that another point, which they (meaning the Catholics)
observe in continual practice, is the assassinates and murders of kings,
thinking it no sin, but rather a matter of salvation, to do all actions of
rebellion and hostility against their natural Sovereign Lord, if he be once
cursed, his subjects discharged of their fidelity, and his kingdom given a
pray to their three crowned Monarch. Through the which his Majesty's speech,
this Examinate did verily think, that the oath of Allegiance was ordained, to
meet with such mischiefs, as the Parliament supposed (according to his
Majesty's said words) to be dangerous consequences of this forenamed opinion:
which he this Examinate signified, when he took that oath, and mentioned (as
is aforesaid) in his letter to the Cardinal. Wherein he sees not (as he
says) what just offense can be taken, in that he told the Cardinal, how he
had sworn, that the Bishop of Rome had no Imperial and Civil power, to depose
at his pleasure the kings Majesty. For as he then swear, so he does now
constantly affirm, that he holds the opinion before spoken of, concerning
the Popes direct Dominion, and supreme authority over all the world in
temperalibus, to be untrue, notwithstanding the peremptory resolution, and
vehemence showed by the authors of it, affirming (but falsely) that it is the
more common opinion of Divines, to be held by the law of God cum recta fide,
with a right faith.

35 But here it being objected, that although the said oath was framed to meet
with the opinion before by him mentioned; yet that this his restraining of it
thereunto, does not attain to that, which he knew was intended by it. For in
his said letter to the Cardinal he does cite sundry authors, which speak of
another kind of authority, ascribed to the Pope, and tending by a nice
distinction to this effect: that in ordine ad spiritualia, in order to things
spiritual, and indirectly all kings and princes, with their kingdoms and
countries, are subordinate, and subject unto him; insomuch as if he see cause,
and that kings and princes will not be advised by him, in matters of the Church
apperteining to their salvation, he may not only Excommunicate them, but
proceeding by degrees, depose them, absolve their subjects from their oaths of
Allegiance, and rightfully command them (if need be) to bear arms against
them: which is as lewd and traitorous an opinion, as the former, and does tend
to the same end with it, though under diverse pretenses. So as if he took the
oath, but with relation only to the first opinion, leaving himself free as
touching the second, it was all one, as if he had not taken it at all: and
therefore being pressed to clear this point, he answers, as hereafter
follows.

36 First, he does acknowledge the objection to be very pertinent, and rightly
collected out of his letter, confessing this second opinion, not to come
behind the first, either for the earnestness of those, that defend it, or for
their learning and sufficiency, being such indeed, as do in credit far
ouersway the estimation of their opposites. Cardinal Bellarmine himself has
labored much in it, and these authors following do join with him in that
point, Henricus, Johannes Driedo, Johannes de Turre cremata, Albertus Pighius,
Thomas Waldensis, Petrus de Palude, Cardinal Caietane, Franciscus Victoria,
Dominicus Soto, Nicolaus Sanderus: to which number this Examinate says, he
could add diverse others, as Martinus Aspilcueta, Couarruuias, etc. Of which
opinion Cardinal Bellarmine says, that it is communis sententia Catholicorum
Theologorum: the common opinion of Catholic Divines: albeit Alexander
Carerius, and Rodericke Sancius do affirm as much for the other. In this
number, this Examinate confesses, that he did range himself in his late
letter to the said Cardinal, as inclining rather to his side, then to the
other: being notwithstanding bound to neither of them, upon any danger of
declining from the Catholic faith. So as if now he use his liberty therein
as touching his Majesty, he has (as he supposes) Cardinal Bellarmine
himself for his author therein.

37 For where there is this clause in the oath of Allegiance, I do further
swear, that I do from my heart detest and abjure, as impious and heretical,
this damnable doctrine and position; that Princes which be excommunicated or
deprived by the Pope, may be deposed, or murdered by their Subjects, or any
other whatsoever: Cardinal Bellarmine says, that it was never heard of ab
intio nascentis Ecclesiae vsque ad haec nostra tempora, vt vllus Pontifex
Maximus Principem vllum quamuis haereticum, quamuis Ethnicum, quamuis
persecutorem caedi mandauerit: from the first birth of the Church, unto these
our times, that any Pope ever commanded any prince, though an heretic, though
an Ethnicke, though a persecuter, to be slain: And that therefore the fear
which is pretended of the Kings life (if the Bishop of Rome had the same
authority in England, which he has in other Christian kingdoms) is vain,
and that all pretenses tending that way, are but stratagemata Satanae, the
deceits of Satan. The which affirmations of the Cardinals being true, the same
for ought this Examinate sees, do justify the said part of the oath by him
taken, even the very same, which of all other parts in it, is most misliked by
many Catholics in England. For it must needs be granted generally, that were
it not in respect of the Popes excommunication of Kings and princes, his
deposing of them from their Crowns, and his absoluing of their subjects from
their Allegiance, it could never be lawful for any of them to rise up against
their lawful kings and Sovereigns under whom they were borne. And it is all
one (in this Examinats judgment) for the Pope to command a king to be
murdered, as to do, and command that, whereby the same is by others of
duty to be effected. And then it follows out of the Cardinals words, that
it can never be lawful by the Popes authority, either direct or indirect, for
any subject (upon any pretense whatsoever, or under the countenance of any
authority, to excommunicate, and depose Kings, or absolve their Subjects from
their Allegiance) to lay violent hands upon his Sovereign, which is in effect
that part of the oath above mentioned, whereunto this Examinate did swear.

38 Furthermore, because it was again told this Examinate, that this his last
answer to part of the said oath, stood after a sort but upon an inference of
the Cardinals meaning, and was no way sufficient to satisfy the aforesaid
objection; he this Examinate renewed his former desire of proceeding by such
degrees, as he himself thought most fit, for the discharge of his duty both
to God and his Majesty: and thereupon says; that he believes in his
conscience, that the Pope is S. Peter's successor, and the head of the
Catholic Church: and that although material and worldly keys may open and
shut, upon favor and friendship; yet the keys of the kingdom of heaven do
respect no men's persons, be they poor or rich, noble or ignoble, high or low,
kings or subjects: so as in his judgment none may be exempted from the Popes
Excommunication, when there is just cause (upon due consideration of all
circumstances) to inflict it: adding thereunto, that he holds it to be the
duty of all Christian kings and princes, to submit themselves in causes of
religion to the Bishop of Rome, as unto their chief Bishop and Pastor of their
souls. Which profession thus made, this Examinate desired, that one point in
his former Examination published in print, might here be received, as part of
his answer to the objection above specified. Sect. 16.

39 For there this Examinat (as he truly says) M Blakwels Exam. page 18, 19.
Being urged to explicate himself, touching the sense he relied upon, out of
his Majesty's words, when he took the oath of Allegiance, in that it was said,
he might so understand them, as not withstanding his oath, that duty which
was expected, was no way satisfied: because his Majesty's meaning was evident,
that he did account it to proceed from appetite and rashness in any of the
Bishops of Rome whosoever, who presuming to Excommunicate any King, should by
the same either absolve his Subjects from their obedience, or excite them to
bear Arms against him, or authorize them to lay violent hands upon his
person, or to stir up any sedition or tumult within his Kingdom, or to assist
any that should make such attempts either against the King, or the State of the
Kingdom: he this Examinate answers now, as he answered then for the further
opening of his meaning, saying, his judgment is, that no lawful
Excommunication (termed either Excommunicatio mayor, the greater
Excommunication, or Ecclesiastical curse of Anathematization) can produce such
effects, or ought to enforce the same; and that he agrees therein with many
sound Catholic writers (as he thinks) and particularly with these following:
and so drawing out his pocket-notes (as often, upon sundry occasions he did) he
caused their words to be set down for the better declaration of his duty.
Excommunicatio non nisi excommunicatum facere potest, eaque fulminatur in
Principes, non vt tyranni fiant, neque vt suis ditionibus remoueantur, neque vt
subiectis laxentur habene, vel jurata fide liberentur: That is, An
Excommunication can but make a man Excommunicate: and it is thundered against
Princes, not to the end, that they should thereby become tyrants, or be
removed from their Dominions, or that the ruins should be loosed unto
Subjects or they be freed from the oath of their fidelity. Ludou, Richeome in
Apologet. pa 175. And again Soto Medina in primam secundae page 513. q 96.
art. 4.
says, as Medina does allege him; Quod Excommunicatio non est priuatio
alicuius boni proprij, quod transgressor legis prius posseder at: sed est
priuatio bonorum communium, quae ab Ecclesia crat percepturus, vt communionis
spiritualis, and receptionis Sacramentorum: That is, Excommunication is not the
privation of any proper or peculiar good, whereof the transgressor of the law
was formerly possessed: but of those common benefits, which he should have
reaped from the Church, as of the spiritual Communion, and receiving of the
Sacraments. And S. Thomas says: Tho. Aquin. secunda secuudae. q. 11. art. 3.
Aliud est Excommunicatio, and aliud Eradicatio: Excommunication is one thing,
and Eradication another: which is set down in the Canon Law of an Epistle of
Pope Vrbane, where it is said: Liquido apparet, aliud esse excommunicationem,
aliud eradicationem. Qui enim excommunicatur (vt Apostolus Decret. 2. part
cause. 24. q. 3. cap. 37.
ait) ad hoc excommunicatur, vt spiritus eius salnus fiat in die Domini.
Disciplina enim est Excommunicatio, and non eradicatio. That is; It does
plainly appear, that Excommunication is one thing, and Eradication another.
For he which is Excommunicated, is (as the Apostle says) to this end
Excommunicated, that his soul may be saved in the day of the Lord. For
Excommunication is a correction, and not an extirpation. So as this Examinate
here says, that for as much as he has before acknowledged, that the Kingdom
of England, is no part of the Popes possessions, nor any more subject unto him,
then other Christian Kingdoms are: that the Pope has no Imperial or Civil
authority to depose his Majesty: and that the Popes Excommunication (which is
the chief censure of his spiritual authority) can bring forth no such
effects, as are supposed in the said oath of Allegiance, viz. neither
deposition, eradication, absolution of Subjects from their obedience, nor any
sufficient warant either to rebel, or to lay violent hands upon any King: he
this Examinat is persuaded, that little more can be required at his hands, in
answer of the said maine objection, touching the sense of that oath, according
to the effect of his Majesty's speeches, insinuated (as is above said) by him
this Examinate unto the Cardinal.

40 Before the further pressing of the insufficiency of all that hitherto he
has said for the clearing of the said objection, Sect. 35. for as much as in
his last speeches, touching Excommunication, he said that Excommunication
could bring forth no such fruits as he there recited: it was demanded of him,
how that his assertion could agree with these points of Popish doctrine,
published by a classical author of the Romish sect; where he labors to
prove by sundry reasons, that Henry. 3. being king of France stood diverse
years excommunicated, before he was murdered, as having committed many
offenses, which were subject ipso iure to diverse Excommunications, as namely
that of the Bull Coenae Dominicae: some of which faults he sets down to be
these following: showing the said king to have been excommunicated ipso facto,
for De Iusta abdic, Hen. 3. l. 2. cap. 35.
every one of them: for example, 1. quod haereticis fauebat. 2. quod
8imoniacus. 3. quod cum haereticis (Regina Angliae and Nauarro) foedus inierat.
4. quod bona Ecclesiae, Pontifice inconsulto, occupauerat, etc. 1. for that he
was a favorer of heretics. 2. for that he was a Simonist. 3. for that he had
entered into league with heretics, (the Queen of England, and the Nauarrian.)
4. for that without the Popes priuitie he had seized the possessions of the
Church. Whereupon after many other discourses and allegations of Scriptures,
fathers, histories, and what not, he falls upon this conclusion, that the
said king was lawfully murdered, before any Excommunication of him was
published, saying, Non percipit formulam publicus Ibid. lib. 4. c. 2.
dolor: Common grief is not capable of form. And that albeit in occulto
crimine in a hidden crime no man ought to be condemned indicta causa, or
before he be cited and called: yet in public and notorious crimes, such as by
no tergiuersation can be hid, Euidens notitia facti s^ntentiae Idem ibidem.
locum tenet: Evident notice of the fact is in place of a Sentence. All which
particulars do cross this Examinates former opinion, how excommunication had
no power to deprive any King from his kingdom, and could much less give
authority to murder him.

41 Whereunto this Examinate answers, that what private men write, ought
neither to be imputed to the doctrine of the Catholic Church, nor to any
other man's prejudice, who is of another judgment: and yet he says, that these
points propounded out of the said author are so far out of joint and so
intolerable, as he holds them in his judgment to be most false, and
dangerous, not only to all protestant Kings and princes, but in like manner to
those that are Catholics. For (says he) if all of them may be so dealt with
by their subjects, who stand excommunicated ipsoiure, by many excommunications,
but especially by the Bull Coenae Doviinicae, he knows no king living, who
may be secure, either of his kingdom, or of his life

42 It being here again objected unto this Examinate, that because it is
apparent, that all Kings and Princes who have rejected the Popes supremacy,
though otherwise they embrace the Gospel, are generally accounted by all Romish
Catholics to be heretics: he this Examinate must, in the duty of his
Allegiance, necessarily answer, concerning the positions following, whether he
does allow them, or disallow them; the same being the effects of the Popes
Excommunications, even ante Sententiam latam, before Sentence denounced, which
are likewise contrary to his former judgment

43 The Canon Laws (says no mean man) Card. Allen against the execution of
Justice. pa. 87.
being authentical in the lawful tribunals of the Christian world do make
all heretics (not only after they be namely and particularly denounced, but
by the Law it self ipso facto, as soon as they be heretics, or de iure,
excommunicated for the same) to be deprived of their Dominions. And another of
little less credit then the former, writes thus: Hinc inferatur, Philop. page

Hereupon the whole School of Divines and Canonists does infer, and it is
certain, and of faith: that any Christian Prince whatsoever, if he shall
manifestly deflect from the Catholic Religion, and endeavor to withdraw
others from the same, does presently fall from all power and dignity, by the
very force of humane and divine law; and that also before any Sentence of the
Supreme Pastor and Judge against him denounced: and that his subject:
whatsoever are free from all obligation of that oath, which they had performed
for their allegiance unto him, as to their lawful Prince: and that they may
and ought (if they have forces) to eiect such a man as an Apostata, an
heretic, and a backslider from the Lord Christ, and an enemy to the Common
wealth, out of all dominion over Christians, lest he infect others, or by his
example, or commandments auert others from the faith. And this certain,
definite, and undoubted opinion of the best learned men, is wholly agreeable and
consonant to the Apostolical doctrine. And to this purpose diverse others of
the same humor might be alleged.

44 Whereupon this Examinate at the last (though he was hardly drawn unto it,
in respect of the persons, whose words were cited, much honored and
reverenced by him) did give this answer, saying in effect, as he did
concerning the authors whose assertions were propounded unto him in the next
precedent objection, viz. That these men had their particular opinions, as he
has his; but confesses that these their assertions last mentioned are far
from his judgment, utterly denying them to be the inferences of the school
of all Divines, and Ecclesiastical Lawyeers, or that they are either de fide
of faith, or certain, or defined, or the undoubted opinions of the most
learned men, agreeable to the doctrine of the Apostles. Besides, whatsoever
this Examinate has formerly said touching his reasons sent to Rome, or out of
Syluester, or touching the present estate of this Kingdom, or his former
judgment, that an Excommunication cannot warrant any such kind of proceedings
of subjects against their Princes (be they Heretics or Apostates, or
whatsoever they be) does iustle directly with these assertions: and therefore
he says, that he does utterly reject them, accounting them great stains and
blemishes unto Excommunication, if they be made the effects thereof.

45 Here it falling out aptly to come to the point indeed (mentioned Sect. 35.)
the same was pressed. For whereas it is clear by this Examinates confession,
that they of the Romish church have not only amongst them Excommunication of
Princes, but likewise (as he has before showed out of certain their
authentical writers) an Eradication and utter extirpation, which must (as it
appears) be effected not by Excommunication, but by virtue of the Popes
authority, either as he is directly Dominus Temporalium, that is, the chief
Temporal Lord under Christ over all the world, or indirectly, in ordine ad
spiritualia, in order to things spiritual: forasmuch as both of them do tend
to one end, and are equally pernicious and traiterous to all Regal
Principality and authority; it being little to the purpose to detract from
Excommunication, that it has no power to depose kings, or to absolve their
subjects from their Allegiance, if there be left in the Pope another kind of
power, after that by his Excommunication he has cast kings to the devil (in
his own idle conceit) then to eradicate them likewise and throw them out of
their kingdoms, and to authorize and incite their subjects to all secret
conspiracies, treasons, rebellions and trecheries against their Sovereigns:
this Examinate was here again urged upon his allegiance to his Majesty, and
as there was any truth to be expected at his hands, to set down his
judgment, touching this point of the Popes pretended Sovereign power in
Temporalibus, in ordine ad spiritualia, in order to things spiritual, as he
has done before, concerning the other pretense of his direct authority.

46 With this point this Examinate (as it seemed) being much perplexed said,
that now indeed the matter was followed to the quick: and therefore desired
that it might be sufficient for him to acknowledge, that in his judgment the
Pope has authority to Excommunicate (when there is cause) the greatest King
in the world, profesing Christianity; but (says he) for his other power, in
ordine ad spiritualia, in order to things spiritual, it cannot touch his
Majesty.

47 Hereupon, for that this Examinate had often before desired, that he might
speak of things by degrees and not in gross, it was thought fit to proceed
herein with him accordingly. And therefore he was first put in mind, what he
had before said in the beginning of this his Examination, concerning his
judgment of the obedience due to princes by the precepts of Christ and his
Apostles, Sect. 2: of the continuance of the said precepts: of his dislike,
that any should imagine, either Christ or his Apostles in their said precepts
to have temporized, as willing Christians, then living under persecuting
Emperors, to obey no longer, but until they were able by force to suppress
them, Sect. 3 (and so as above more at large it does appear:) and being
thereupon demanded, whether he continued still in the same judgment, without
any equivocation or evasion whatsoever; he thereunto answering resolutely, that
he did; and that in so affirming, he delivered his conscience clearly as in
the sight of God: he was required, for the better assurance to be given
thereof, to signify his judgment sincerely and truly, what he thinks of
the assertions following, which do thwart directly his judgment, so settled as
he has professed, touching the first 300. years after Christ.

48 Nos illa non mouent, quod Martyrs dicuntur De abdic. Hen. 3. lib. 1. cap.
3.
mortem tolerasse, and vt Tyrannos Ecclesiae infestos deponerent, minime
sategisse. Quia vt laudabile est, cum resistere nequeas, ita vbi possis
resistere religionis ac patriae bosti, nolle, nefarium and perniciosum est.
That is, Those things move us not, that Martyrs are said to have endured
death, and not endeavored any ways to depose Tyrants, being enemies to the
Church. For, as not to resist the enemy of your religion and country, when
you are not able, is commendable: so when you are able, not to do it, is
wicked, and pernicious.

The holy Bishops might most lawfully have excommunicated Allen defense against
the Just. of England. cap. 5. page 107.
the Arrian Emperors, and have warranted their Catholic subjects to have
defended themselves by arms against them; but they did not so, by reason of
greater forces of the persecutors.

Moreover, there is no question, but the Emperors Idem ibidem.
Constantius, Valens, Julian, and others, might have been, by the Bishops
excommunicated, deposed, and all their people released from their obedience; if
the Church, or Catholics had had competent forces to have resisted.

And to the purpose last mentioned: Quod si Christiani olim non deposuerunt
Neronem, and Diocletianum, Bellar. de Romans Pontif. lib. 5. cap. 7.
and Iulianu^ Apostatam, atque Valentem Arrianum, and similes, id fuit, quia
deerant vires te^porales Christianis. Nam alioqui jure poterant id facere. That
is, If the Christians of ancient times did not depose Nero, and Diocletian, and
Julian the Apostata, and Valens the Arrian, and such like, it was, because
temporal forces were then wanting to the Christians; for otherwise they might
lawfully have done it.

49 To these Assertions (being thus pressed upon him) after sundry
tergiuersations, in respect of the dignity of the persons, whose words were
before mentioned, and of the discredit and danger he should cast himself into,
by intermedling with their opinions; yet in regard of his duty to God, to his
Majesty, and to the truth, (so far as he is able to discern it) at the
last he answers: that howsoever the said assertions may be political, yet
surely in his judgment they are not Theological: that he wondreth how it
comes to pass, that these and the like sayings are so frequent of late days
in many writers, considering that neither in the books of godly martyrs,
during the first 300. years after Christ, nor in the writings of the most
principal ancient fathers, for many years after, there is so much as a
syllable (to this Examinates remembrance) that tends that way.

50 Besides, he says, that if these conceits should grow to be in credit, the
reputation of the Apostles must needs decrease, as having been in their times
but Temporizers; which M. Blackwood, a sound Catholic, does collect out of
certain words of Buchanans, tending in effect to the same purpose with the
former assertions: where showing, that the Christians in Tertullians time
(notwithstanding they had sufficient forces) did not think it lawful to bear
arms against their Emperors (as above this Examinate has said) he the said M.
Blackwood writes in this sort: Blackuodei Apolog. pro Regibus. page 259.
Paulus vtendum foro praecepit? Larurtam hypocrisn, sub persona religionis,
latere voluit? Potestatibus obedientiam edixit, quia resisti non posset?
Christianos viribus auctos, ad armacessantes, ad arma concitat, Imperiumque
franget? That is, Did Paul command men to temporize? Was it his meaning, that
masked hypocrisy should lurk under the semblance of religion? Did he iniayne
them obedience to higher powers, because they could not resist? Did he excite
Christians, being once increased in strength to take arms, and overthrow the
Empire? And a little after, he shows out of Clemens, Peter's disciple,
speaking of the great tumult that Caiphas made in Jerusalem, that the
Christians, etsi numero plures, virtute potiores, propter Numinis obedientiam,
occidi maluisse quam occidere: though more in number, and mightier in power,
yet for their obedience to God, they chose rather to be killed then to kill:
and thereupon does describe the duty of subjects, and the armor of
Christians, which are prayers and tears.

51 Moreover, this Examinate doubts not (as he says) but that the Bishops of
Rome in Tertullians time, and afterward, were as godly and zealous Popes, as
any have lived since; that they very well knew, what authority did belong unto
them: and that if the aforesaid assertions had been good Divinity then,
considering the numbers, force and ability of Christians in those days, the
said Popes out of question would have left some monument of their zeal, in the
execution of their authority and of the Christians readiness (having force) to
resist their Emperors; whereas none such indeed are to be found For these and
many other such reasons, as might be brought for this purpose, this Examinate
says, that he does wholly disallow the said assertions, propounded unto him as
tentations to try him: and that therefore he does rest in the judgment before
by him set down, without all kind of euasions and equivocations whatsoever,
professing, that if he could set down his mind more plainly herein, he would
have been very willing thereunto.

52 Again this Examinate being required, that because he had formerly inuolued
himself into sundry difficulties, to the distaste of his Majesty and the
State, by some his intricate, and uncertain answers heretofore made, he
should to the point now propounded unto him, answer directly, and upon his
learning, credit, and reputation: he says, that indeed he does not remember
that ever any Pope until Gregory the seventh, did add to Excommunication any
clause of their authority to depose Emperors, or kings, or to absolve their
subjects from their allegiance, or to command them under pain of
Excommunication to bear arms against them; and D. Thomas handling this point,
does only rely Tho Aquin. 2^. 2^ quaest. 12. art. 2.
therein upon Gregory the seventh. Also he confesses, that when Gregory so
dealt with the Emperor, there was great dislike and repining at it, as it may
appear by Otho Frisingensis and Sigebertus; Otho Frising. lib. 6 cap. 35.
whom he would not have named (he says) because Baronius has laid a touch
upon them of Schism (as rather enclining to the Emperors, then to the Popes,
when there was dissension betwixt Idem de gestu Frid. lib. 1. cap. 1. Sigebert.
in Anno 1088.
them) had it not been, that Vincentius in his Historiale had testified as
much: where having spoken of the abuse of the keys, he says, (with relation
to Gregory, and his next Successor but one, Vrbanus,) Vt pace omnium bonorum
dixerim, haec Vincent. in spec. Histor. lib. 15 cap. 84.
sola nouitas (ne dicam haeresis) necdum e mundo emerserat, vt Sacerdotes eius,
qui dicit Regi, Apostata, and qui regnare facit hypocritam, propter peccata
populi, doceant populum, quod malis Regibus nullam debeant subiectionem; and
licet ei sacramentum fidelitatis fecerant, nullam tamen debeant fidelitatem,
nec periuri dicantur, qui contra Regem senserint, imo, qui Regi paruerit pro
Excommunicato habeatur, qui contra Regem fecerit, a noxa iniustitiae periurij
absoluatur. That is, That I may speak it with the favor of all good men; this
mere novelty (that I say not Heresy,) was not as yet sprung up in the world,
that his Priests, who says unto the king, Apostata, and who makes the
Hypocrite to reign for the sins of the people, should teach subjects, that
they owe no subjection unto wicked kings; that albeit they have taken an oath
of fidelity unto such a one, yet they are not bound in allegiance unto him; and
that such as shall take part against their king, may not be said to be
perjured: nay, that they who perform obedience unto him, are to be held as
excommunicated: and such as rebel against him, are to be acquitted from all
guilt of the crime of perjury. Which report and testimony made by so worthy a
Bishop above 350. years since, this Examinate says, he may not impugn or
dislike, though Vincentius receives it from Sigebert; this Examinate no way
approouing the discrediting of ancient Catholic writers, under pretense of
their favor toward this Emperor or that Emperor; because it gives occasion
to some, to empeach many other worthy men's writings in like sort, upon color
of their partiality toward the Bishop of Rome. Besides, it is apparent, that
some of the best and most sincere Catholics were much troubled with that fact
of Gregory, there being then many, who plainly denied, that the Apostolical
See had authority to depose (as he did) Henry the Emperor, and to absolve his
subjects from their oath of fidelity unto him: in so much as the Bishop of
Metz writ Gregory 7. Epist. 21. lib. 8. apud Seuerinum de Concilijs.
unto Gregory, desiring him (being in great favor with him) to assist and
arm him with his reasons of such his proceedings with the Emperor, that he
might be the better able thereby to withstand those, that spoke against them.

53 Furthermore this Examinate (the premises considered) being again moved,
for the full clearing of his sincerity, to deliver his mind concerning the
point, which he said touched the quick, Sect 45. viz. of the Popes so great an
authority in temporalibus, in temporalties, as that he may, by any distinction
whatsoever, deal with Emperors or kings, as is aforesaid: he desiring Sect.
35. and 45.
to see one of Cardinal Bellarmines books de Romano Pontifice, did deliver
out of him, his this Examinates judgment, saying that he was verily persuaded,
as follows, viz.

That the Pope is not Lord of those possessions which Bell. de Romans Pontif.
lib. 5. cap. 2.
Infidels hold: that Infidel Princes, are the true and supreme princes of
their own Kingdoms: that dominion is not founded in grace, or in faith: that
S. Paul does bid us to obey Ethnic Princes, for conscience sake: that we
were not bound to obey such Princes, if they were not true Princes: that
Princes are not the Popes vicars: that the Pope would willingly, if he could,
give the Kingdoms of Infidels unto faithful Princes: that it is a ridiculous
conceit, to imagine, that God has given to the Pope a right over all the
kingdoms of the world, and not to have given him at any time a faculty of
using such a right: that Alexander 6. did not divide the late new found world
unto the kings of Spain and Portugal, to that end that they should have gone
thither, to have subdued the Infidel kings of that new World, or to have taken
to themselves their kingdoms; but only that they should have procured
preachers of Christian faith, to have been sent thither, and to have protected
and defended both those preachers, and the Christians converted by them; and
that withal he the said Alexander might prevent, the contentions and wars
of other Christian princes, who would have used traffic in those new regions.

54 That the Pope is not lord of the whole Christian Bell. ibidem cap. 3.
world: that if he were the lord of the whole Christian world iure diuino, the
same would appear in the Scriptures, or by some Apostolical tradition: that
in the Scriptures there is nothing, but that the keys of the kingdom of
heaven are given to the Pope, without any mention of the keys of the kingdom
of the world: that none does pretend any Apostolical tradition to that
purpose: that Christ neither did, nor does take kingdoms from those, to whom
they do appertain: that Christ came not to destroy those things that were
well settled, but to make them more perfect: that when the king becomes a
Christian, he does not lose his earthly kingdom, which by law he had before,
but obtains thereby a new interest to the kingdom of heaven; otherwise the
benefit of Christ should be hurtful to kings, and grace should destroy
nature: that it is no true assertion, to say that the Pope has both powers,
but comitteth the execution of one of them unto others: that what authority
soever the Emperors have, they have it from Christ: that if the Pope, as being
the supreme King and Emperor, might take from kings the execution of their
regal authority, he were greater then Christ: that although Innocentius
does compare the Pope to the Sun, and the Emperor to the Moon, yet it is
to be observed, that the Sun and the Moon are not one Star; that as the
Sun does not make the Moon, but God; so the Popedom and the Empire are not
one, nor do depend the one upon the other: that although the Pope alone, has
full authority in the temporalties belonging to the Patrimony of the Church,
yet in other Regions he has not so.

55 That the Pope iure diuino, by the divine Law Idem ibidem cap. 4.
has no temporal dominion directly of any one place: that Christ as he was
man, whiles he lived upon the earth, did not, nor would receive any temporal
dominion: that the Pope is Christ's vicar, and does represent him unto us, as
he lived here amongst men: that therefore, as he is Christ's vicar and the
highest Bishop, he has no temporal dominion: that it proceeds from a false
principle to say, that the Pope, who is Christ's vicar, is both a temporal king
and a Priest: that Christ was always the son of God, the king and Lord of
all creatures, as God the Father is; but this kingdom is eternal and divine,
and does not take away the Dominions of men, nor agrees to the Pope: that
Christ as man, is the spiritual king of all men, and has a most ample
spiritual power over all, as well faithful as Infidels: that this spiritual
kingdom of Christ, after the day of Judgment, shall be sensible and manifest;
and that the glory of this kingdom was begun in Christ our head, quando a
mortuis resurrexit, when he arose from the dead: that this Spiritual kingdom
is not a temporal Kingdom, such as kings enjoy, nor can be communicated to
the Pope, because this spiritual kingdom, presupposes the resurrection: that
Christ as man, might if he would, or had thought it expedient, have taken to
himself a Regal authority, but he would not; and therefore did neither
receive, nor had either the execution or authority or power of any temporal
Dominion, or kingdom: that all kingdoms are gotten, either by succession, or
by election, or by the sword, or by gift; but Christ had no temporal kingdom
by any of these means: that Christ did never execute any Regal authority in
the world: that Christ came to minister, not to be ministered unto, to be
judged, not to judge: that he should have received such a Regal authority in
vain, having never any use of it: it being a vain power, quae nunquam
redigitur in actum, which is never brought into act: that Christ did not cast
out of the Temple the buyers and sellers of Oxen and Sheep, by any Pontifical
or Regal power, sed more Prophetarum, zelo quodam diuino: but after the manner
of the Prophets by a certain divine zeal: that kingly authority was not
necessary for Christ, nor profitable, but plainly superfluous and
unprofitable: that the end of Christ's coming into the world, was the
redemption of mankind, to which end, spiritual power was only necessary, and
not temporal that that power merely temporal was unprofitable for Christ, is
apparent, because he was to persuade men to contempt of glory, delicacies,
riches, and of all temporal things, wherewith kings of this world do most
abound: that all the places almost of Scriptures, which speak of the kingdom
of Christ, must needs be understood of his spiritual and eternal kingdom,
but temporal kingdoms are not eternal: that Christ was not a temporal king
of the Jews, but a spiritual king of the Church: that although the Pope is
said to have that office, which Christ himself enjoyed, when he was among men;
yet those offices cannot be ascribed to the Pope, which Christ had, as God, or
as he is now an immortal and glorious man, but only those (and yet not all
of them) which he held as a mortal man: that Christ, because he was God and
man, habuit quandam potestate^, quam dicunt excellentiae; had a certain power
of excellency (as they call it) whereby he governed both faithful and
Infidels, whereas he committed his sheep only, that is, the faithful, to
the Pope: that Christ, as he was man, had power to institute Sacraments, and
work miracles by his own authority; which power the Pope has not: that
Christ could absolve men from their sins without Sacraments, which the Pope
cannot do: that Christ does communicate that power to the Pope, which might
be communicated puro homini, to a mere man; which was necessary for the
government of the faithful, so as without impediment, they might obtain the
kingdom of heaven.

56 That these places and authorities: Data est Idem ibidem cap. 5.
mihi omnis potestas in coelo and in terra, Matthew. 8. All power is given unto
me in heaven and earth. Christus beato Petro vitae aeternae clauigero, terreni
simul, and coelestis Imperij iura commisit: Christ committed to S. Peter the
key-carier of eternal life, the Nicol. Pap. epist. ad Michael.
rights, both of the terrene and celestial Empire: Ecce duo gladij, Luc. 22.
Behold here are two swords, do no way prejudice the former doctrine: that the
Popes power to decide temporal suits and questions, Can. cause. 11. quaest. 1.
Quicunque litem, was granted unto him by Theodosius, ex pietate, non ex debito,
of devotion not of duty: that Christ, for the preservation of humility,
ordained, that the Pope should have need of the Emperors defense in
temporalibus, Idem ibidem cap. 10.
and that the Emperor also should need the Popes direction in spiritualibus,
and that therefore he left the Empire to Tiberius, and bestowed the Popedom
upon Peter.

57 That as touching the temporal principalities Idem ibidem cap. 9.
(which they have indeed) the same were given to the Bishops of Rome, and other
Bishops, by godly men, such as Constantine, Charles the great, and Lewis his
son, were: that although it were peradventure absolutely better, that the
Bishops of Rome should only intermeddle with spiritual matters, and kings
with temporal; yet through the malice of time, experience teaches it to be
both profitable and necessary, that as in the old Testament, the high Priests
were long sine Imperio temporali, without a temporal government, and yet in
those last times religion could not have consisted and been defended, except
the high Priests had bin likewise kings, as in the time of the Maccabees; even
so it has come to pass with the Church, that she, who in the beginning did
need no temporal principality, does now seem to have need thereof
necessarily.

58 All the premises being in this manner alleged out of Bellarmine, in effect
word for word, by this Examinate, it was told him, that except he could be
content, to open and enlarge himself further then after this sort, forasmuch
as Bellarmine (notwithstanding all that this Examinate has repeated out of
him, for the expressing of his own judgment) does afterward clearly
attribute such an indirect power to the Pope ordine adspiritualia, in order to
things spiritual, as does give him authority, when he thinks fit, to deal
with Emperors and Kings, as if all the world were at his commandment
(directly or indirectly it forces not) for the eradicating of them, deposing
of them, absoluing their subjects from their obedience, and plotting against
them by his firebrands and Assassins, as times and places may serve his turn
(as it has been touched Sect. 35. and 45:) he this Examinate should leave
the matter worse then when he began, and show most manifestly, that when he
took the oath of Allegiance, he did dally and dissemble above measure,
otherwise then became any dutiful subject living, in a case so nearly
concerning his Majesty, and the State of the Kingdom.

59 Unto this point this Examinate for his answer says, that he makes no
doubt, but that he has sufficiently so opened his mind, and enlarged
himself, as that there can be no question of his sincericie toward his
Majesty; in that he has twice, Sect. 4. and 47. showed his judgment,
touching the practice of the primitive Church, for the first three hundred
years after Christ; likewise his utter dislike of sundry assertions propounded
unto him, Sect. 49; some whereof maintain, contrary to Tertullians relation
(how Christians stood then affected) that in those days, arms might lawfully
have been borne against the Emperors, if the professors of the Name of Christ
had been able: and some, as touching sundry other unsound and vncatholike
matters in them contained, concerning the loss of Kingdoms, etc. upon
excommunications, Sect. 39; and also his opinion of the time, when the deposing
of Kings and absoluing their subjects from their allegiance were first made
adjuncts to excommunication for ought he has read, Sect. 52. But yet he is
contented, as he says, a little further to enlarge himself, according to the
motion propounded, and to that end affirms, that he does concur in
judgment with these authors following; and so out of his pocket-notes set
down their words in this manner:

60 Apostoli nihil vi gerebant, tantum vtebantur gladio spiritus: neminem
agebant in exilium; nullius inuadebant facultates Haec omnie Erasmus non minus
diserte, quam vere: That is, The Apostles did nothing by force, they only used
the sword of the spirit; they drove no man into exile; they entered upon no
man's possessions. All this, says Erasmus, no less elegantly, then truly,
Costerus in fidei demonstrat. page 96.

Si aliqui Reges cum populo se tradiderunt Romany Pontificibus, vt traditur de
Anglis, nihil ad nos. Non tamen opinor, quod Angli vllo modo permitterent,
Pontificem destituere suum Regem, and alium constituere: nunquam enim aliquem
Romanorum Pontificum hoc facere permiserunt: That is, If any Kings with their
people have subjected themselves to the Bishops of Rome, as it is reported of
the English, (but untruly, as this Examinate has before showed) that touches
not us. And yet I do not think, that the English would by any means permit
the Pope to depose their King, and constitute another: for they never suffered
any of the Bishops of Rome, so to do. Johan. Mayor in 4. Sentent. distinct.
24. quaest. 3.

De ratione potestatis laicae est, poenam ciuilem posse infligere, vt sunt
mors, exilium, bonorum priuatio, etc. sed nullam talem poenam, ex institutione
diuina, infligere potest Ecclesiastica potestas: imo nec incarcerare, vt
plaerisque doctoribus placet, sed ad solam poenam spiritualem extenditur,
vtpote excommunicationem. Reliquae autem poenae quibus vtitur, ex iure pure
positiuo sunt: That is, It is of the nature of lay power, to be able to
inflict civil punishments as are death, exile, loss of goods, etc. but the
Ecclesiastical power cannot by the divine ordinance, impose any such
punishment: nay not imprison, as the most Doctors do hold; but is extended to
spiritual punishment alone, as Excommunication. The other punishments which it
uses, are merely out of positive Law. Iacobus. Almain. de Dominio naturali
and civilly, in vltima editione Gersonis. page 696.

61. Here this Examinat being told, that although he has to some good purpose
repeated, what he had formerly said, and a little more enlarged himself then
before; in that he has acknowledged, that what the Pope can do, more then
Excommunicate, he has it ex iure pure positiuo, merely by positive Law: yet
considering, that he made no scruple, to show his dislike of the opinion,
touching the Popes pretended authority in temporalibus directly, in the 20.
Sect: but seemed loath to deliver his judgment, concerning the other opinion
of the Popes authority in Temporalibus in ordine ad Spiritualia, indirectly in
order to things spiritual; it was further urged against him, that if he be
indeed of Bellarmines mind in the points by him cited out of his book, it
seems to be impossible, that he this Examinat, being a grave and learned man,
should think, that that which Bellarmine has said (upon very weak and simple
grounds God knows) for proof of the Popes indirect authority in ordine ad
Spiritualia, is of sufficient force, and moment, to overthrow all that he has
written before, in his second, third, fourth, and fifth Chapters of his said
book (one of them being countenanced, for offending too much, with the word
direct, his arguments being in effect simple and absolute:) because it is most
apparent to every man, that will not wilfully hoodwinke himself, that he the
said Bellarmine has given the Pope such a blow, and deadly wound, by many his
so sound and substantial arguments against his pretended direct authority, as
all the courses, how indirect soever, that can be devised by the finest wits,
will never be able to salve and cure it. And therefore this Examinate was
required very strictly, herein to express himself more clearly.

62 Whereupon this Examinate says, that he must indeed needs confess and
acknowledge, that he has wished, with all his heart, that either Cardinal
Bellarmine had not intermedled with that question of the Popes authority in
temporalibus indirectly, or else that he had been able (if it have any truth
in it) to have handled it more pithily, and thoroughly: that the weakness of his
arguments for that point compared with the positions set down by this Examinat
out of his said book (as is aforesaid) has been an especial cause (as he
thinks) why many of later times do so earnestly labor to refell them; as
foreseeing, that if the Popes authority in temporalibus, to depose Kings, etc.
should stand upon this point, viz. that he had it but indirectly, the same
would be subject to great hazard, considering the oppositions in these days to
the Church of Rome: and that therefore, insomuch as the thing it self (viz.
whether the Pope has any authority at all to eradicate and depose Emperors
and Kings for any cause) which is aimed at on both sides, as well by them who
affirm, that he has such an authority directly, as by those, who say he
has it not directly, but indirectly, is notwithstanding left as yet
undetermined by the Church: he this Examinate desires, that he may not be
further urged to interpose his opinion, otherwise then he has done already, in
matters of so great moment and difficulty.

63 This only (as appertaining hereunto) he says, that he is much grieved to
see the Popes Supreme authority in causes Ecclesiastical, so much entangled
with these pretenses of another supreme authority in temporalibus; to be held
directly and immediately of Christ, or indirectly, per accidens, and by a
certain consequence: as if otherwise Christ should not have sufficiently
provided for the necessity of the Church, nor furnished the Pope with ability
to discharge his duty; considering that without these devises, so much
insisted upon, though with very great uncertainty (to the great in dangering
of the Popes universal charge over all Churches in Spiritualibus) Saint Peter
and his successors did sufficiently provide for the necessity of the Church,
when the Emperors and civil Magistrates were utter enemies unto it, and sought
by all the means that possibly they could devise, to have quite abolished and
extinguished the name and memory of all Christianity.

64 This Examinate being here again demanded, how he can make it appear,
that the point above by him specified, is not as yet determined by the Church:
says, That he is now from his books; but takes the same to be so evident,
as he feared not, in his letter to Cardinal Bellarmine, to say, that this
proposition, scil. Papa habet potestatem deponendi Reges indirecte: The Pope
has power indirectly to depose kings, was not yet defined, tanquam res fidei
formaliter, as a matter of faith formally: and well remembers that Couaruuias
in the second part of his book of the last edition at Lions, page 504. does
set down the names of diverse worthy persons, that concur with him (this
Examinate) herein. Besides he says, that this does further appear by
Cardinal Allen: where he affirms, that this proposition or any other
equivalent unto it, viz. That Card. Allen against Defense of English Justice
cap. 4. page 72.
the Pope has power to excommunicate, or deprive a Prince in case of heresy,
or Apostasy, and consequently to absolve his subjects from their oath and
obedience to him, is a mere matter of Divinity, if not defined (says he) for
us, yet at the Alan^s ad persecutor. Angios. sol. 326.
least disputable in school: or as it is in the Latin copy, Est quidem plane
Theologica, and cum religione Christiana arctissime cohaerens, de qua si for
san non definite pro part nostra pronunciatum sit, posse tamen and solere
Theologicis argumentis in vtramque partem disputari, ipsi quidem aduersarij,
qui quicquam sciunt, ignorare non possunt.

65 Here it being objected, that seeing (as it seems) it is not yet
determined by the Church of Rome, either that the Pope is Dominus temporalium,
directly, or only, in ordine ad spiritualia, indirectly, or that he has any
such authority at all, whereabouts the authors of the two first opinions do so
hotly contend: and for that also he (this Examinate) has professed before,
that he Sect. 36.
was not bound to either of the said opinions, upon any danger of declining
from the Catholic Church, but would use now his liberty, albeit in his letter
to Cardinal Bellarmine he inclined to his side: and that therefore it seemed
strange, why he is so loath to express his mind apparently, and without any
circumstances, what his sincere judgment is, (without respect of any men's
persons) as touching the Cardinals assertion for the Popes authority in
temporalibus, in ordine ad spiritualia, in order to things spiritual;
considering what dangerous consequences thereupon may ensue to his Majesty and
the State here: in respect whereof this Examinate, being eftsoons urged, upon
his duty toward God, and his Allegiance to his Majesty, to deliver his
judgment, touching this point, truly and sincerely: answers, that because
he is still so pressed in his Majesty's name, and in his name also, who faith,
Ego sum Veritas, I am the Truth, to deal herein plainly and sincerely, and
finding that otherwise, he shall not be able, to give such satisfaction, as
he thinks in his conscience he is bound to do, he answers to the
premises, in manner as follows; viz.

66 That it is true, that none of the said three points objected, are as yet
determined: that he must of necessity acknowledge it to be subject to some
reasonable exceptions, why, before it be concluded, whether the Pope has at
all any authority to eradicate and depose Kings and Princes, etc. there is so
earnest disputation of the manner, how he received it from Christ, whether
directly or indirectly: that touching his former inclination to Cardinal
Bellarmines opinion, forasmuch as the same is more generally received, he held
it his duty not to dissent from him in appearance, it being the property of
turbulent spirits, to quarrel at things conveniently settled for the good of
the Church; and against the common rule, Malum been positum, non esse mouendum,
things subject to some exceptions, are not always to be ruffled in, especially
when they may tend to the prejudice of Christian tranquillity; and that he
would still have concealed his own judgment to himself touching these points,
had he not been so greatly urged (as in diverse parts of this his Examination
it may appear) to declare it.

67 That (as it were by the way, but very pertinent to this Examinates cause)
forasmuch as by the premises it is not only evident, that the points
contained in the Oath of Allegiance, are left as yet to be disputed on in
vtramque partem, (as Cardinal Allen affirms) but is also as plain and
manifest, that when Cardinal Bellarmine writ to this Examinate, that one of
the chief heads of faith and foundations of Catholic Religion was brought
into danger by this Examinates taking of the said Oath: he, the said Cardinal
was utterly misinformed, as supposing the same to be against the Popes
Supremacy in causes Ecclesiastical; whereunto that Oath, (as before he has
said) had no manner of relation: for otherwise it is apparent, that his taking
of that Oath, can no way endanger any head or foundation either of faith, or of
Christian Religion; there being no such heads, or foundations yet agreed upon
or laid in that behalf.

68 That therefore as he has acknowledged his liberty (without danger of
declining from the Catholic Church) to express his judgment, as well of
this opinion so much urged against him concerning the Popes authority in
temporalibus indirecte, as he has done before of the other, viz. that the Pope
(as he thinks) is not Dominus temporalium, direct; so this Examinate will
now at the last use that his liberty at this time, because he does find it
to be as lawful for him to refuse the one as the other: and does thereupon
accordingly profess with all truth and sincerity, that (as he thinks)
neither of the said opinions is true: that what he this Examinate has before
set down at large out of Cardinal Bellarmine, he thinks in his conscience
is sound and Catholic, and cannot be impeached either by the Canonists, and
those their assistants, that lately have taken their parts so eagerly, for the
Popes direct power, or by the other side, who to the same end for his dealing
with Emperors, Kings, and Princes, as is aforesaid, do attribute the same
unto him, though indirectly: and that he is the bolder in this sort to declare
his mind concerning the said two opposite opinions, because it is not yet
defined (as he has said) by the Church, whether Christ has left to the Pope
any such authority at all, to eradicate and depose Emperors and Kings, as they
contend for preposterously, in laboring (before it be resolved whether he
has any such authority, or not) to persuade men in what manner the same was
given unto him, directly says the one side, indirectly says the other.

69 That he verily supposes, that Cardinal Bellarmine, being so worthy and
eminent a man for judgment and learning, has not been so peremptory in the
handling of the two said points, whether the Pope has the said surmised
authority directly or indirectly: but that he has left unto himself some
sufficient warrant and liberty, to vary (if there be occasion) in the said
third point, viz. whether Christ gave to S. Peter any such authority at all,
or no. For whereas he (the said Cardinal) does plainly affirm, that Papa,
vt Papa, ordinary Temporales Principes deponere Bellar. lib. 5. de Romans Pont.
cap. 6.
etiam iusta de causa non potest: tamen potest regna mutare, and vni auferre,
and alteri confer tanquam summus Princeps spiritualis, si idnecessarium sit
ad animarum salutem: That is, The Pope cannot, as he is Pope, (though there be
just cause) by his ordinary power depose civil Princes, yet as he is the
supreme spiritual Prince he may translate Kingdoms, and take them from one,
and confer them upon another, if need so require, for the saving of souls:
he says in effect nothing else, though covertly, but that the Pope has no
power at all to depose Kings. For S. Peter neither did, nor could transfer
any authority unto his Successor, but ordinary: for which cause it is
commonly held, that the rest of the Apostles could not derive the plenitude of
their power to their successors, as S. Peter did, because the same in them was
not ordinary, as in S Peter, but extraordinary: Extraordinaria enim potestas
non transit in successorem. For an extraordinary power does not descend unto
the successors. And at this point this Examinate says he did aim (as far
as he durst presume) in his letter to the Cardinal, where having cited his
words abouesaid; Non potest, Papa, vt Papa, etc. he writ after this sort:
Verba iuramenti sunt, Papam non habere authoritatem deponendi Regem, and
disponendi de regnis and dominijs Maiestatis suae: Et communis intellectus apud
Magistratum ad nullum alium conceptum propendet, quam ad hunc, viz. Papam, vt
Papa est. Nam non potest pertingere ad illum conceptum, viz. tanquam summum
Principem spiritualem. Et cum proponitur iuramentum suscipiendum, illius
sensus, cognitus a Magistratu, restringitur ad ordinariam potestatem. Nam qui
proponunt iuramentum, illi remotissimi sunt a cogitatione extra ordinariae aut
indirectae potestatis in Papa residentis. That is, The words of the oath are,
that the Pope has not authority to depose the King, and to dispose of his
kingdoms and Dominions: And the common understanding thereof does with the
Magistrate incline to no other conceit, but to this; viz. the Pope, as he is
Pope: For it cannot reach unto that construction, viz: as he is the supreme
spiritual Prince. And when the oath is exhibited to be taken, the sense
thereof, apprehended by the Magistrate, is restrained unto an ordinary power.
For they that minister the oath, are as far as may be from the thought of
any extraordinary, or indirect power, residing in the Pope. Besides, it is
apparent that the Pope is not otherwise the highest spiritual Prince but as he
is Pope, so as what he cannot do as Pope, he cannot do as the chief spiritual
Prince. And out of question Carerius has gotten an advantage Carer. depot.
Romans Pont. lib. 2. cap. 8.
of the Cardinal by reason of his said former assertion: where he the said
Carerius labors to prove, that Christi vicarius proprie dicitur, Papa,
Christ's vicar is properly called, the Pope: and does press it hardly to this
effect; that either the Pope is not Christ's vicar, or else that he does judge
inferiores Potestates, vt Papa, as he is Pope.

70 That the contents of the 39. 66. 68. and 69. Sections of this his
Examination, being well weighed and considered, together with diverse other
points by him set down in the said Examination: his answer (this Examinat
says again) to the Cardinals letter, touching the clause most excepted
against, does reach as far, as by the oath of Allegiance was intended. For
whereas (says this Examinate) if the Pope should have any authority to depose
and eradicate Kings, he has it not by virtue of his power to Excommunicate,
but must have it of necessity, either as he is supposed to be Dominus in
temporalibus direct, the Lord of temporalties directly, or Dominus in
temporalibus indirecte, the Lord of temporalties indirectly: and that Cardinal
Bellarmine is peremptory, that the Pope cannot depose kings by any ordinary
jurisdiction, that he has, as he is Pope; and Carerius, with all his vpholders
on the other side, are as confident and resolute, that if the Pope has not
ordinary authority, as he is Pope, to depose kings, he has no such
authority at all: for as much as what he this Examinate has before affirmed,
how in his opinion (as he says) the Pope has no authority to depose Kings,
either as he is Dominus in temporalibus directly, or indirectly: the same is
nothing else then what he deposed unto, when he swear, that in his conscience,
the Pope neither of himself, nor by any authority of the Church or See of
Rome, or by any other means with any other, has any power or authority to
depose the King, etc. And because also, that whether he should have had
authority to depose Kings or not, he must have had it by some imperial or
civil authority, either as he is Dominus in Temporalibus directly or
indirectly: considering that to be Dominus in temporalibus in any of the said
two respects, is to have an imperial and civil authority: he this Examinate
says, that these points well weighed, it is plain, that when he writ to the
Cardinal: Summum Pontificem non habere imperialem and ciuilem potestatem
deponendi Regem nostrum: that the Pope has not an imperial or civil power to
depose our King: he told the Cardinal in effect as much, as if he had said
unto him, that the Pope has no authority at all to depose his Majesty.

71 That for the further clearing of his (this Examinates) relying upon his
Majesty's speeches in Parliament, when he took the oath of Allegiance, and
his mentioning of it likewise to the Cardinal; he this Examinate says, that
except it be thought a fault, to answer truly to a matter propounded, when he
speaks not all the truth, that does thereunto appertain, (which were a
strange conceit; the order neither of Schools, nor of any judicial Courts in
the world, binding any man to proceed further in his answer to any question or
interrogatorie, then the same does lead him:) he this Examinate sees not
(he says) what can be subject to any just reprehension, in his answer to the
Cardinals letter, the substance thereof being grounded upon this conceit, that
he this Examinate, in taking the oath of Allegiance, had sworn against the
Popes supremacy in causes Ecclesiastical.

72 For answer unto which erroneous conceit, he this Examinate says, that
when he writ, that he took the oath in this sense, viz. That the Pope had no
imperial and civil authority to depose his Majesty, the same is true,
whether it be attributed to the Pope, either directly or indirectly: also when
he writ, That the Pope had no imperial and civil authority to depose the
King at his pleasure, and upon his appetite; the same also is as cuident,
though the Pope had as great authority, as they pretend he has, who say he
is Dominus in Temporalibus directly: that where he this Examinate, having
cited diverse authors to this effect, that the Pope has authority indirectly
in ordine ad spiritualia, did thereupon infer, that the Pope could not depose
his Majesty, because if he should so do, he should use that his authority,
non ad spiritualia promouenda, sed euertenda: not to the furtherance of
spiritual matters, but to the overthrow of them; and thereupon did add, that he
held nothing else therein, quam quod vbig Theologi in suas conclusiones
compegerunt, then what was generally concluded amongst Divines: he said (as he
thinks) therein also truly, for that the common opinion is, that the Pope
has no authority, ad destructionem, to destruction. So that albeit he might
(as he says) have answered to every point of the Cardinals letter more
thoroughly, yet that which he writ, being sufficient to answer it: he thought
it his best course to write, as he did.

73 It being here again objected, that notwithstanding he this Examinate has
very well declared his judgment, to any man's contentment, who is ignorant of
the new deceitful shifts of equivocation: yet because Cardinal Bellarmine
holds, that albeit the Pope cannot depose a king by his ordinary authority
directly, as he is Pope: he may nevertheless mutare Regna and vni Bell. de
Romans Pont. lib 5. cap. 6.
auferre atque alteri confer, tanquam summus Princeps spiritualis, alter
Kingdoms, and take them from one, and give them to another, as he is the
highest spiritual Prince, as having authority in temporalibus, in ordine ad
spiritualia: forasmuch as yet it may well be doubted, whether he this
Examinate, when he says, that the Pope has no Imperial or Civil authority,
nor any power in temporalibus either directly or indirectly to depose and
eradicate kings, to absolve their subjects of their allegiance, or to authorize
them to bear arms against them, has not this, or some such like cuasion,
viz. that it may truly be affirmed, that the Pope has no such authority, to
be termed properly either Imperial, or Civil, because whether he has it in
temporalibus directly, or indirectly, yet the authority in it self, being
employed for the deposition of Kings etc. is to be named, according to the
end, wherefore it is so used; which being for the good of the Church, (that is
spiritual) the said authority is not to be called a Temporal, but a
Spiritual authority; whereby all which he this Examinate has hitherto said
may be eluded, and made frustrate by this, or some such shift, viz: The Pope
has no Imperial, and Civil authority to depose the king, that is, he cannot
depose him by his Civil authority, as it is Civil, but as it is Spiritual:
and again to the same effect, the Pope has no authority in temporalibus,
either directly or indirectly, to depose kings; verum est, the authority which
the Pope has in Temporalibus, to depose kings, is to be termed Ecclesiastical
and not Temporal, as it is truly called, when Kings and Princes do use it to
an end which is Civil: he this Examinate was urged to expedite this
difficulty with some reasonable plainness and perspicuity.

74 Whereupon this Examinate being grieved (as he professed) that nothing would
be accepted in satisfaction of his duty (as he fears,) said, that assuredly
there should be no defect in his sincerity, howsoever the same might be
wrested: and therefore to the said objection briefly answers, That although
he does acknowledge that there are some, who say, that when Boct. Epon.
Heroie. and Ecclesiastic. quaest. page 185.
the Pope does inflict Temporal punishments, for the better preservation of
his Spiritual authority, nulla dicetur vti Jurisdiction temporali, sed mere
spirituali, cum totum hoc ad animarum salutem, coelesteque regnum referatur: he
shall not therein be said to use temporal Jurisdiction, but merely Spiritual,
since this whole action has respect to the salvation of souls, and to the
kingdom of heaven: yet because the most that write after this sort, do
qualify their speeches therein, with a quasi, or dici potest, or magis, or
aliquo modo; it is apparent that their meaning is not, that such a temporal
authority used to a spiritual end, is in very deed, and in truth a mere
spiritual authority.

75 Besides, he this Examinat further adds, that to his understanding, the
deposing of Kings, and the exciting of their subjects, to bear arms against
him; will hardly be raunged amongst spiritual actions. In sum therefore this
Examinate says, that in his judgment, the Popes spiritual authority ought
not to be extended, beyond the power of the keys of the kingdom of heaven,
and of the censures of the Church, properly so called: and that the Pope has
no authority at all in temporalibus either directly or indirectly to depose
Kings, etc. by what name or title soever the said power, when he puts it in
practice in ordine ad spiritualia in order to things spiritual (as he the said
Pope supposes) may be termed, whether spiritual or temporal; or whether the
end he aims at, by such his proceedings with any King or Prince, be
spiritual or supernatural, that is, be pretended to be undertaken for the
good of the Church, and promoting of Christianity: the same in this Examinats
judgment (as he says) being neither Apostolical, nor agreeable to the
practice of the most worthy Bishops of Rome in the Primitive Church, and for a
long time after, nor available in truth to the Catholic Church, but rather
hurtful, and great hindrances thereunto.

76 And here this Examinate further says, that the premises considered, viz:
upon what uncertainties the maintenance of the Popes authority, not to
excommunicate, but to depose Princes, does consist: he confesses that he
cannot choose but acknowledge, that he much wondreth, and in that cogitation is
also exceedingly grieved, that ever Gregory the seventh, or any Pope since did
in their Excommunications of certain Emperors, Kings and Princes, take upon
them in the same, to denounce them deposed from their kingdoms, to release
their Subjects of the oaths of their Allegiance, and to authorize them no
longer to obey their Sovereigns, under pain of Excommunication: as also that
many men, as well Emperors, Kings, Princes, and their subjects have thereby
received great detriment, especially subjects, who have spent their lives, as
supposing the cause was just, which they undertook, this in the mean while
being indeed their case, that as what they did therein, was in truth wicked,
and rebellious, so when either that, which they took in hand had not good
success, or when afterward the Pope and such Princes grew to an agreement,
they were ever for the most part reputed (according to their deserts) for
Rebels and Traitors, under pretense of some thing or other, that was amiss in
their proceedings: and that therefore he hops, that in time all Catholics
will hereafter by other men's harms learn to beware, and not be drawn to any
disobedience against their Sovereigns under any pretense whatsoever.

77 The authors of the late most wicked, and barbarous treason, commonly
termed the Gunpowder treason, had (as this Examinate verily thinks) some
intendment to have advanced thereby the Catholic cause: for that his Majesty
did still persist in the same course, which was held by the late Queen his
predecessor, or by what other inducements, this Examinate knows not. Howbeit,
as this was their just reward here, that they were condemned, and executed for
traitors; so do they worthily reap amongst all discreet Catholics and wise
men abroad in other Countries, nothing but shame and infamy to the memory of
their own names and posterity: which this Examinate wishes from the bottom
of his heart, may ever be the success of all manner of persons whatsoever,
that shall imagine, or seek to contriue any hurt to his Majesty, the Prince,
or any other of his Highness posterity, or to the present state of this
kingdom, under any color or pretense of conscience, religion, favor toward
the Bishops of Rome, or any thing else whatsoever. Only this Examinat here
adds, that as he does very well approve, that Catesby with his fellows
should be chronicled for traitors by any or wheresoever: so he disliketh,
that the said Cristanouic also, who is above named, should endeavor after a
sort to qualify their offense, by casting an untrue and shameful scandal
upon this whole nation: where after a long discourse to prove, that English
men have from time to time conspited against their kings, not for religion, but
in respect of their own rebellious nature: he concludes thus, with relation
to the said Gunpowder traitors: Causam tenes, lector, coniurationum
Anglicanarum, quarum furorem falso religioni Stanista. Cristanouic. exam. Cath.
fol. 18.
Catholicae legislatores tribuunt: that is, Thus (Reader) you have the true
cause of the English conspiracies; the fury whereof, their Lawmakers do
falsely impute to the Catholic religion. And again, Non ergo Catholicum sed
Anglicanum ingenium, Reges Ibidem.
Angliae non sinit securos esse: that is, It is not therefore the Catholic,
but the English humor, which will not suffer the Kings of England to live
secure. For (as this Examinate says) what this fellow affirms of English
men, may be as well justified of any nation in Christendom, if such a rash
judgment might be grounded upon such like arguments as he has used: But here
this Examinate remembering his drift, wishes in his heart, that it might be
never forgotten by any Catholics, or other English men whosoever, what
guerdon, commendation, and infamous renown they may justly expect, that for
any cause whatsoever (as is aforesaid) shall attempt any thing against their
Sovereign.

78 Thus far this Examinate having opened his judgment, upon such occasions
as were ministered unto him: he used sundry speeches, how much it troubled him,
that either his Majesty, or the State should doubt of his sincerity, and
Allegiance, and therefore for a conclusion, and as it were to add his seal,
to all that before he has said, he further affirms, viz:

That he does truly and sincerely, from the bottom of his heart acknowledge,
profess, testify and declare in his conscience before God and the world, that
King James his Sovereign lord, is iure diuino, and by the positive laws of
this realm, lawful and rightful King of this realm, and of all other his
Majesty's Dominions, and Countries, both de facto, and de iure: and that it was
not lawful, either for his Majesty's Subjects, to have withstood him by force,
from being their king, nor ever can be lawful for them, now that he is their
king, to rise up against him, or seek by any ways or means to hurt him,
either in his health, or in his regal estate; although he denies the Popes
supremacy in causes Ecclesiastical, and seeks (as he may) to suppress all
those, that dissent from him in those points of Religion, which he imbraceth:
and though likewise they (his said subjects) being either Catholics or
Protestants, had sufficient numbers, forces, and ability so to do, without any
scandal to the Catholic cause, and without any danger to themselves either in
their goods or lives.

79 That the Pope iure diuino, by the law of God, neither of himself, nor by
any authority of the Church, or See of Rome, or by any other means with any
other has any power or authority, either directly or indirectly, in ordine ad
spiritualia, (whether the said authority be termed spiritual or temporal, or
mixed, or howsoever it is, or may be termed) to depose the King, or to dispose
any of his Majesty's kingdoms or dominions, or to authorize any foreign
Prince to invade or annoy him, or his countries: or to discharge any of his
subjects of their Allegiance and obedience to his Majesty; or to give license
or leave to any of them to bear arms, raise tumult, or to offer any violence
or hurt to his Majesty's Roial person, State, or government, or to any of his
Majesty's subjects within his Majesty's dominions.

80 That he does also affirm from his heart, that notwithstanding any
declaration, or Sentence of Excommunication, or deprivation made or granted,
or to be made or granted by the Pope or his successors, or by any authority
derived, or pretended to be derived from him or his See, against the said King,
his heirs, or successors, or any absolution of the said subjects from their
obedience: he will bear faith and true allegiance to his Majesty, his
Heirs and Successors, and him and them will defend to the uttermost of his
power against all conspiracies and attempts whatsoever, which shall be made
against his, or their persons, their crown and dignity, by reason or color
of any such sentence or declaration, or otherwise, by reason or color of any
authority or power, ascribed to the Pope in temporalibus, directly or
indirectly, in ordine ad spiritualia, whether the said authority be termed
spiritual or temporal, or mixed, or howsoever it is, or may be termed, and
will do his best endeavor to disclose and make known unto his Majesty, his
Heirs and Successors, all treasons and traitorous conspiracies, which he
shall know or hear of, to be against him, or any of them.

81 That furthermore he does auow it from his heart, that he does abhor,
detest and abjure, as impious and heretical this damnable doctrine and
position: that Princes which be excommunicated by the Pope, or are deprived by
him of their kingdoms, by this pretended authority in Temporalibus, either
directly or indirectly, in ordine ad spiritualia, (whether the said authority
be termed spiritual or temporal, or mixed, or howsoever it is or may be
termed) may be deposed or murdered by their subjects, or any other whatsoever,
notwithstanding any commandment, direction or advise, directly or indirectly
given to the contrary, by any manner of person whosoever, and notwithstanding
any exposition, or declaration of the Popes interpretatiue will, that if any in
zeal, by reason either of the said Excommunication, or deprivation, or of them
both, will either adventure to take up arms against such a King, or to lay
violent hands upon his person, the Pope is bound by his office to approve it,
because the same did tend to the execution of his Sentence, and to the
promoting of the end, he aimed at.

82 That he also does believe, and is in his conscience resolved, that
neither the Pope, nor any person whatsoever, has power to absolve him of this
oath, or of any part thereof, whereby he might truly think himself
discharged in any one point of his Allegiance before by him professed: and that
therefore he does renounce all Pardons and Dispensations in that behalf.

83 And that lastly he does plainly and sincerely acknowledge, as in the
presence of God, and upon his Allegiance to his Majesty, that what he this
Examinate has delivered, and is here set down in this his Examination, the
same does contain his true judgment, so far as his learning reaches,
without any equivocation, or mental cuasion, or secret reservation whatsoever:
and is to be understood, according to the express words, as they are set
down, and according to the plain and commonsense and understanding of the
same.

84 But here again it being objected, that albeit he this Examinate has very
well discharged his duty, as well in his expressing his judgment, in the
points above propounded unto him (that of the Popes Supremacy in causes
Ecclesiastical, and some other touches of certain things, not appertaining to
the oath of Allegiance excepted:) yet forasmuch as the same does depend upon
this uncertainty, whether the Pope will define it, to be a matter of faith,
and accordingly then to be acknowledged by Popish Catholics, that he may
depose Kings, and deal with their subjects, as is aforesaid; and that thereby
his Majesty, and all other Christian Kings and Princes (as their occasions
fall out) shall still rest unassured of the loyalty of their subjects, and of
their own safeties: it was necessary, that he this Examinate should also
clear this point: for answer whereunto he says as follows.

85 That he did not imagine any such matter would have been propounded unto
him because it is well known to all that be learned, that no man can judge
before hand de futuris contingentibus, of future contingents, and therefore he
desired that he might be forborne.

86 But hereunto this reply being made, that although there can be no certain
judgment de futur is contingentibus, soil: contingant vel non contingant:
whether they shall happen or not happen; yet of a certain and determinate
thing propounded, what might be thought of it, if it should happen, there may
before hand a direct and sure judgment be given: For example: it is futurum
contingens, whether ever any King, and Parliament in ENGLAND will make a
Statute to restore to the Pope his Supremacy here, as fully as ever he had it:
and yet it is not to be doubted, but that he this Examinat, if he were now
asked, whether in his judgment, such a Statute were lawful and just, or not,
and might accordingly be put in execution: he would out of question answer
before hand affirmatively: and even so it being told this Examinate, that he
might do in the case propounded; after some deliberation, thus he answered,
viz:

87 That (as he writ unto the Cardinal) although it should be determined to
be a point fidei formaliter, of faith formally, that the Pope might deal with
Princes, as is aforesaid, and were accordingly so to be received in thesi in
the general position: yet this question propounded in hypothesi, by way of
particular supposition an Papa habeat potestatem deponendi Regem nostrum, rebus
in co statu, quo nunc sunt, permanentibus apud nos, whether the Pope have power
to depose our King, matters continuing with us in the state, wherein now they
are: he this Examinat says now, as he writ then, that the determination of
this question, touching his Majesty should only be of that, which is fidei
materialiter, of faith materially: quia esset determinatio de quaestione, quae
in rebus creditis accidit, and proinde non diceretur determinatio de fide, sed
de tali materia: because it should be the decision of a question which happens
about things believed, and therefore is not to be said to be a determination
touching Faith, but concerning such or such a matter: wherein, because (as he
has before observed out of Syluester, and Couarruuias) the Pope may be
deceived; he this Examinat says, that in his judgment, let them define at
Rome, what they list in this matter; yet if the same should be offered to be
practiced against his Majesty, it ought not to be entertained, received, or
obeyed by any of his Majesty's subjects, the same tending not to edification,
but to destruction.

88 Against this answer such exceptions being taken, as are before set down:
after some further enforcing of them with many circumstances, and repetitions
of sundry points, by him before acknowledged: he was at the last content
further to enlarge himself in manner hereafter ensuing: affirming: viz:

That in his judgment, the Pope will never determine it to be a matter of
faith, for Catholics to believe, that he has authority to depose
Emperors, or Kings, to absolve their subjects from their Allegiance, and to
authorize them, either to disobey them, or to bear arms against them: because
hitherto, when it might have been better done, and with less scandal, and
inconvenience, it has not been so defined; notwithstanding that the Popes
themselves in their own persons, and the city of Rome it self have been in
greater danger and peril, then they now are: and this Examinatis fully
resolved, that the present Pope, and the Cardinals his assistants are as grave,
wise, and provident now, to foresee what evil, and inconvenience might grow to
the Church by such a resolution, as ever any of their predecessors were in
times past.

89 That he is fully persuaded, that as it does tend to the expressing of the
supereminent excellency of the justice of God, to say, that he cannot do any
thing, that is unjust; and of the great honor and dignity of Kings and
Princes, to affirm of them, that Reges non possunt esse serui: Sovereigns
cannot be vassals: so it does no way derogate from the high dignity and
calling of the Bishop of Rome, but rather does greatly advance it, to say,
that because he cannot err, there are therefore many things which he cannot
do, For example, even in the point questioned, as the Pope cannot determine it
to be lawful, under any pretense whatsoever, for a man to commit adultery with
his neighbors wife: no more can he determine it to be lawful under any
pretense whatsoever, for any of his Majesty's subjects to bear arms against
him; both of them being against the moral law of God, which the Gospel does
in no one point prejudice. Nor as he cannot by any determination or resolution,
upon any pretense whatsoever, make a son to be no son, during the life of
his father: no more can he make the borne subject of any king, not to be his
subject, so long as the king lives.

90 That he is also altogether of this opinion, that whereas the defining of
the Popes said undetermined authority to depose kings etc. standing upon this
issue, that either he has indeed no such authority at all, or else, that he
has it, as being dominus temporalium direct, the lord of temporal things
directly, or as dominus temporalium, in ordine ad spiritualia indirecte, the
lord of temporal things, in an order unto spiritual things indirectly;
forasmuch as such a determination must of necessity include the condemnation of
the opinion either of Cardinal Bellarmine, and of that strong side that takes
his part (which may breed some further trouble,) or of Cardinal Baronius, and
those that join with him, being many and increasing daily more and more, with
great confidency, that they have the truth, (which no doubt will be found
inconvenient, considering that their positions do much more tend to the honor
of the Church of Rome, then those that are maintained, as peremptorily by the
other side:) he this Examinate is of this opinion (as he says) that there will
never be any such determination, as has been objected, or at least, that it
will not be for many years yet to come, whilst there is so strong
opposition, concerning the manner, how and in what sort Christ gave Saint Peter
that authority (if he gave it him at all) viz: whether directly, or indirectly,
immediately, or by a certain consequence: except it may be held to be
sufficient (leaving both the sides mentioned contending amongst themselves)
without any certain grounds, firm reasons, impregnable testimonies either of
Scriptures or Ancient Fathers, first agreed upon by the Church and concluded,
so to define, as is imagined: which this Examinate is fully assured, the Pope
and Cardinals, being men of such excellency and wisdom, will never attempt.

91 That although it may peradventure be confidently given out (as it has
been untruly by many already) that the Pope to have authority to depose kings
etc. is defined at Rome, to be held as a point of faith; thereby still to keep
on foot the ancient opinion since Gregory the seuenths time of the Popes
authority in that behalf, for the good of Christian kings and Princes, that
they might be the rather induced to continue in some awe and fear, if they did
not their duties belonging to Christianity: yet he this Examinate thinks
it very necessary, that no Catholic should give any faith to that report,
except he may see the same authentically so confirmed and evident, as the Canon
laws in a case of such importance do require: which this Examinate is fully
persuaded, they shall never see: or that if any such thing should happen to
fall out, this Examinate is verily persuaded, it will not be a general
resolution, touching the Popes authority to depose kings etc: but only to the
point in question now amongst Catholics here in England, that it is not
lawful to take the said oath of Allegiance, and then this Examinate further
says, that the same will be built upon this false ground, that the oath of
Allegiance does include the oath against the Popes supremacy in causes
Ecclesiastical, as he foreseeth already by the Cardinals letter unto him, and
by the said Cristanouic, who having set down the said oath at large, writes
thus: Quod iuramentum? De Primatu Regis in spiritualibus: And what oath? Of the
kings Supremacy in causes spiritual, and that therefore if any such resolution
come authentically, as is aforesaid, the same (as all Catholics are to judge
of the Popes sincerity) being procured by surreption, and false suggestions ad
destructionem, to destruction, no Catholic is bound to be ouer-ruled by it,
but the same notwithstanding, every Catholic may safely and lawfully take the
said oath of Allegiance, if according to the Statute in that behalf made, he
be required so to do.

92 That also whatsoever may fall out at Rome, either touching the said oath of
Allegiance, or the Popes authority in temporalibus, without any mention of it
therein, whether he has it directly or indirectly, the same will not be more
amply set out and declared, then it was before by Boniface Bonifac. de mayor.
and obedientia. vnam sanctam.
the 8. where he writes in this sort: In hac eiusdem potestate duos esse
gladios, spiritualem viz: and temporalem, Euangelicis dictis instruimur. Nam
dicentibus Apostolis: Ecce duo gladij hic; (in Ecclesia scil: cum Apostoli
loquerentur) non respondit Dominus, nimis est, sed satis. Certe qui in
potestate Petri temporalem gladium esse negat, male verbum attendit Domini
proferentis: Convert gladium tuum in vaginam. Vterque ergo est in potestate
Ecclesiae, spiritualis scil and materialis: That is, We are warranted by the
words of the Gospel, that in his power were two swords; the one spiritual, the
other temporal. For when the Apostles said, Behold, here are two swords,
(meaning in the Church, since the Apostles spoke it) Christ replied not, it is
too much, but it is enough. Assuredly, whosoever denies, that the temporal
sword is in S. Peter's power, he does not well mark the speech of Christ,
saying, Put up thy sword into the sheath: Therefore both swords are in the
power of the Church, as well the temporal as the spiritual. And a little
after: Veritate testante, spiritualis potestas terrena instituere habet, and
iudicare. That is, Truth it self testifying, that the spiritual power is to
order and to judge earthly affairs; according to the prophet Ieremies words:
Ego constituite hodie super gentes, and regna, and caetera, quae sequuntur. I
have set thee this day over nations and kingdoms, etc: All which particulars
notwithstanding, for the setting out of that Constitution, purposely made
against the king of France; Clemens the fifth shortly after made another
constitution to the empeachment of the former; wherein he writes thus: Nos
Regi and regno per definitionem and declarationem bonae memoriae Bonifacij
Papae 8 praedecessoris nostri, quae incipit, Vnam Sanctam, nullum volumus, vel
intendimus praeiudicium generari: nec quod per illam Rex regnum, and regnicolae
praelibati, amplius Ecclesiae sint subiecti Romanae, quam antea existebant, Sed
omnia intelligantur in eodem esse statu, quo erant ante definitionem prafatam:
That is, We will not, neither is it our purpose, that any prejudice come unto
the King or the kingdom by that definitive sentence and declaration of Pope
Boniface the 8. of worthy memory, our predeccssour, beginning thus, Vnam
Sanctam; nor that by force thereof, the King, the kingdom, and people
aforesaid should be subject to the Church of Rome, more then formerly they
were: But that all things be understood, to be in the very some state, as they
were before the aforesaid definitive sentence was given.

93 Moreover also this Examinate says to the same purpose next before spoken
of, that besides the said Clement, diverse other men of meaner calling, have
been bold to refell some of the arguments, whereupon the said Constitution was
built, as Cardinal Bellarmine, that of the two swords: and diverse more, though
this Examinate cannot now set down their words: only he says, he is well
assured, that Huge Cardinalis does make a better exposition (to this
Examinates understanding) of the said place of Jeremy, then Boniface did. So
as if it happen, that the present Pope do make any resolution against the said
oath of Allegiance, besides the exceptions taken before unto it by this
Examinate, he further adds how it may well come to pass, that the next Pope
will alter it: and that in the mean time, it may be as lawful, for grave and
learned Catholics, to take exceptions unto it, as it has been for any
other, to empeach the said Constitution of Boniface, or any part thereof. But
this Examinate does well hope, that the present Pope in his great wisdom
will prevent this course, and approve the grave judgment of Petrus de Alliaco
Cardinal of Cambray, who in his Treatise of the Reformation of the Church of
Rome, offered to the Council of Constance, begun Anno 1414. does write in
this sort: In hoc non debet Pet. de Alliaco de reform. Roma. ecclesiae.
Papa, aut eius Curia, etc. Herein (as touching the Reformation of the body of
the whole Church, and of the particular Church of Rome) the Pope or his
Consistory, ought not to reject the deliberation of a general Council,
because, as the gloss 19. distinct. super cap. Anastasius says, the Pope is
bound to require a Council of Bishops, when any point of faith is to be
handled: quod non solum intelligo, etc. which I do not only understand, of
the Articles of faith, but of difficult matters, that touch the universal
state of the faithful Church: which Archidiaconus 15. did. c. Sicut. notes,
where approouing the said gloss, he adds: qood nimis periculosum esset fidem
nostram committere arbitrio vnius hominis: that it were too dangerous a matter
to commit our faith to the arbitrament of one man: and that therefore the Pope
in new and hard cases was accustomed to have recourse to the deliberation of a
Council. That it is a matter of great difficulty and importance, and such, as
does very greatly concern the whole Church, whether the Pope will hold it fit
to determine either generally, that he has no authority inspiritualibus, or
particularly, that it is not lawful for Catholics in England to take the
said oath of Allegiance; this Examinate is out of doubt; and is therefore so
far of the said Cardinals mind, that neither of the said points are to be
discussed and concluded, without some great and mature deliberation.

94 This Examinate being here demanded, whether he had seen a Book lately
come forth, entitled, A Treatise tending to mitigation toward Catholic
Subjects in England, and amongst diverse things in it, whether he had
considered of certain words used by the Earl of Salisburie, as they are set
down in the Preface of the said Treatise, and of the Author of that Book his
answer unto them: he confesses in every particular, that he has. The Earls
words are there cited thus; that he has been a long time sorry, that some
clear P. R. his treatise tending to mitigation. Praefat. page 20
explication of the Papal authority has not been made, by some public and
definitive sentence Orthodoxall, etc. that not only those Princes, which do
acknowledge this authority (meaning the Popes) might be secured from fears
and ielousies of continual Treasons, and bloody assassinates against their
persons: but those Kings also, which do not approve the same, and yet would
feign reserve a charitable opinion of their Subjects, might know how far to
repose themselves in their fidelity, in civil obedience, howsoever they seem
divided from them, in point of conscience.

95 These words having been in this sort laid before this Examinate, after he
had well marked both them, and the answer unto them: he was with some
difficulty at the last induced to deliver his judgment, as touching the said
answer, saying: that he liked very well of the first and third part thereof,
as touching the Popes authority, so far forth as it concerns his power and
charge, to look to all Christ's sheep, without exception of great or small,
people or Potentates, not only for their instruction and direction in
spiritualibus, but likewise, (if need require) for their spiritual
castigation, by the censures of the Church, interdiction and Excommunication,
not to be decreed or published without just cause, grave and urgent motives,
and due form also of proceeding, by admonition, prevention, intercession, and
other like preambles, prescribed by Ecclesiastical Canons to be observed.

96 But as touching the second part of his answer, this Examinate doubts,
how it may either satisfy the said Earl, or any other, that is of sound
judgment. For whereas the said author faith, that although there be a
question betwixt the Canonists, and the Catholic divines, whether the Pope
have such an authority in temporalibus, directly or indirectly, as by them is
disputed of, and by this author is briefly touched: yet both parts do fully
agree, that there is such an authority left by Christ in his Church, for
remedy of urgent causes: for that otherwise he should not have sufficiently
provided for the necessity thereof: he this Examinate does see, and
acknowledge the truth and importance of the just exceptions that are already
and may hereafter peradventure be taken to that answer.

97 For where the Earl of Salisburie wished some clear explication of the
Popes authority by some public and definitive sentence: the said authors
answer is insufficient, when he says, that both parts, viz: the one
defending the Popes authority directly, and the other indirectly, were fully
agreed for the said authority, etc. but only differed about the manner, how
and in what sort it was given unto him by Christ: which words might seem to
import as much as the Earl desired, whereas in deed the authority which this
author says, both parts are agreed upon, is not yet determined. For Cardinal
Bellarmine and his Bellar. de Romans Pont. lib. 5. cap. 4.
side are fully resolved, that the Pope has no such authority directly, and
that consequently he must either have it indirectly, in ordine ad spiritualia,
or not at all: and e contra the authors, who oppose themselves to that
opinion, are as confident, that he has no authority in temporalibus, except
he have it directly: so as how can it be said they are Carer. de authorit.
Romans Pont. lib. 2. cap. 5. and 8.
agreed, when both sides are so peremptory, that he has no such authority at
all, except he have it, says the one side, directly, says the other side,
indirectly? And for his further answer hereunto, he refers himself to that
which before he has set down in the 63, 68, 69, 76, 88, 90, and 91 Sections.

98 As it was observed in the 42. Section: that all princes for denying the
Popes supremacy, though otherwise they profess the Gospel, are termed
heretics by the Romish Catholics: so although they live never so orderly
according to their laws, without inflicting any other punishments upon
offenders, then are agreed upon by the Commonwealth, they are accounted
tyrants, if for the repressing of Popish errors, they do at some times give
way to the execution of such Laws, as are made against them. And none are more
violent herein, then such as were borne and bred up amongst us in England, as
Stapleton, and William Raynolds, (if they were the authors of the two books,
entitled De iusta abdicatione Henric. 3. and, De iusta Reipuh. Christianae in
Reges impios, and haereticos authoritate:) who affirm, that all power at this
day, which is auerse from religion, De iusta abdic. page 11. Rossaeus page 106.
(meaning the Romish religion) is tyranny, and that they are tyrants, that do
use their kingly power, to the imposing upon their Subjects of that faith,
which they term heretical: and for example of such tyrants, one of them
alleges K. Henry the 8. Edward the 6. and Queen Elizabeth. The consequences
of which assertions are, as Idem page 157.
well in their opinions, as in the opinion of many other, that are of that
sect, that every such tyrant may be deprived of his kingdom, and (if need be)
murdered by his Subjects, yea by every private man, if he have fit
opportunity, after that he is declared by the Commonwealth, as some say, to
be a tyrant, or by the Pope, as others affirm. Whereby all kings and princes,
that mislike the Popes tyranny, and sundry his corruptions, are by him and
his priests infinitely dishonored, and no one way more, then by inciting their
subjects to rebellion, under pretense of religion, which ought to be the surest
band of duty and obedience. In consideration whereof, it being told this
Examinate, that it was all one to his Majesty, whether (by the Popes doctrine)
he were to be deposed from his Crown, under either of these false pretenses,
that he is an heretic, or that he is a tyrant, and that thereby his Subjects
are no longer to obey him, but may bear arms against him, and offer violence
unto his sacred person, as well in the one case as in the other: and that
therefore it stood him in hand, seeing he professes himself to be a true
subject, to deliver himself from these traitorous conceits: he the said
Examinate answered as follows, saying:

99 That in his judgment, if it be true (as this Examinat believes it is)
that the Pope has no authority by any Sentence whatsoever, to depose a King
for heresy (as before he has at large declared) nor to absolve his subjects
from their Allegiance: it is also as true a fortiori, that he has no
authority by any Sentence or judgment whatsoever, so to determine any king to
be a tyrant, as that thereby his right to his kingdom, should in any sort be
empeached, or his subjects set at liberty to rebel against him, or to offer
any hurt unto his person.

100 That he knows, what diverse have written as touching tyrants, wherewith
he says, it is impertinent for him now to intermeddle: affirming
notwithstanding, that (in his judgment) no king, who in the course of his
government does observe the laws, established in his kingdom, and does not
otherwise afflict his subjects, either by violence, rapine, cruelty,
impositions, exactions, or by any other unlawful means, but (as he is bound)
gives way to the execution of his laws, and only uses the ancient
prerogative of his Crown, can in any true construction be rightly judged a
tyrant, though some of his said laws, do tend to the punishment of
Catholics, and to the maintenance of the religion, which he professes:
diverse Emperors being in their times notable governors, and promoters of
their Empire, to the great good of their subjects in temporal causes, though
otherwise they were great enemies to Christianity.

101 That no King, who comes to his Crown by succession, as being the right
heir thereof, may lawfully, under any pretense of tyranny, be deposed, or
resisted by his subjects, either jointly assembled together, or otherwise by
any secret machinations or treacheries of many, few, or of any one: and that
as touching this point, either of judging a king to be a tyrant, or dealing
with him thereupon, as is before mentioned, he is altogether of Master
Blackwood his opinion: who writing against sundry traitorous positions of
Buchanans, tending to the effect before objected, does prove very sufficiently
these points that ensue, viz:

102 That no subjects can arrogate to themselves Blackuodaei Apolog pro
Regibus. page 56.
any part of Regal authority without committing of treason, except the same
be delegated unto them by the King: and that then also, they are to use the
same authority, no otherwise then in such sort, and so long, as the King does
willingly permit them: That our Kings here in this land are no way obliged Page
106.
to the people for their kingdom, but have all their power and Empire from
God, and are only bound to give an account to him of the discharge of their
office and duty, their kingdoms belonging to them iure haereditario, by
right of inheritance, so as no sooner Page 178.
is one King dead, but the next heir is actually king: no ceremony or
Coronation, or other circumstances adding more to his right, then he had
before: That the Oath itself which they take at their Coronation, being made
to God, and not to the people, does not Page 221.
any way empeach the interest they have iure sanguinis, Page 224.
by their birth.

103 That, forasmuch as the kings subjects, his Page 211. etc.
Clergy, Nobles, and Commons cannot assemble together in Parliament, without
the kings Writ, under pain of treason by the old laws, nor when they are
come together, determine any matter, or make any Laws without the Kings Royal
assent, nor continue any longer together after the King does dismiss them: it
is apparent, that they have no authority either to judge the king a tyrant, or
to remove him: and that much less any private persons, his natural borne
subjects, have authority to rise up against him, whatsoever may be pretended,
under any color, cause, or gloss whatsoever: That amongst the three orders,
which deposed the Page 213.
late Queen of Scotland, there were scarce any, but three thecues, three
traitors to their country, and three murderers, with their abettors:
resembling the three-formed monster, with the lions head, breathing out fire,
the belly of a goat, and the tail of a dragon.

104 Whereunto this Examinate addethout of the said M. Blackwood, that which
he himself has set down before in effect in the beginning of his
Examination, and may well serve for a Theological conclusion of this point:
Quotquot instituto Christi vixerunt, etc. As many as since Christ's Page 241.
time have lived according to his institution, did never decline the
government of Tyrants, and much less did resist them by force: they followed
therein their Prince (Christ himself) who although he could have withstood
the injuries of the people, of the high Priest, and of Pilate the lieutenant,
with many legions of Angels: yet he yielded himself to death, that he might
thereby confirm that which he had taught in his life time, viz that an injury
is to be borne gently and mildely, and not by force to be repelled. And again,
Page 242.
Paulus simulatque etc. As soon as Paul became a Christian soldier, his
seditious and bloody spirit being changed into the desire of peace and
quietness, he honored Agrippa, Foelix, and Lysias the Roman Proconsuls, in
respect of their offices, vt doctrinam suam exemplo vitae sanciret, that he
might ratify his doctrine, by his example of life. To this purpose this
Examinate says he could allege much more, in his desire to show the freedom
of his judgment from such men's imaginations, as are named in this objection:
but the remembering only of Catharinus upon the 13. to the Romans, together
with the premises, may (as he hops) give sufficient contentment.

105 Whereas this Examinate speaking of the Popes authority in temporalibus,
indirectly, Sect. 63. did add these other equivalent phrases to the word
indirectly, viz per accidens, and by a certain consequence, but refused to
insert there the word casualiter, and upon some other occasions did let fall
from him, that the Pope had no inherent authority in temporalibus, either
directly, or indirectly in ordine adspiritualia, or per accidens, or by any
consequence, but that which he had, he had it casually: forasmuch as this word
casually may so be understood, as that it may quite dash and overthrow all
that formerly has been said by this Examinate for the clearing of his
Allegiance to his Majesty, he was straightly urged, to open this mystery
sincerely and truly. Thieves have no ordinary power to spoil houses, that are
well guarded, or rob men by the highway side, who are strongly accompanied, but
they have oftentimes casually power to do both; as when they find either
houses weakly provided for, or men in their iourneys not sufficiently
furnished. And it was told this Examinate, that he might have the like causion
in behalf of the Pope, that then he has authority to depose kings, and deal
with them, as in the Oath of Allegiance is provided for to be prevented, when
he may have power so to do casually, that is, when he may either by his own
forces, or by the forces of any other, or by any practices of his agents,
secretly, or by any hap, or casualty, when kings least suspect it, or are
altogether unprovided to resist it, that then he may work or procure their
utter ruin and destruction. Which were to make the Pope the scholar of
Machiauel, taking upon him at some times to play the lion, and at other times
to become a fox, always practicing mischieuously against those Kings that
offend him, as casually he might be able to effect his designements, by praying
upon them or devouring them.

106 Whereunto this Examinate answering says, God forbid, God forbid, that
ever he should have such an imagination against his Majesty, or that ever he
should have intended, by the word casualiter, to have sought for such an
evasion, as above is pretended: and besides hops, that the Pope will never
give occasion for any of his Majesty's subjects, to resemble him either to a
lion, or to a fox; which this Examinate says, upon the occasion given, he
could not omit to observe. But being here pressed to come to the point, as
touching this word casualiter; after some long debatement of sundry particulars
thereunto appertaining, which will appear by his answers, he says as
follows:

107 That he must indeed confess, the word casualiter to be diversely used by
sundry writers; and that some do take it in that sense, which might justly
beget the former objection and collections. They which hold, that the Pope is
the Lord of all temporalties throughout the world directly, do affirm: that
such his authority and jurisdiction is as really and actually inhering in his
person, being Christ's Vicar, as is his supremacy in causes Ecclesiastical:
but yet the practice of it, they hold is but casual, out of S. Peter's
patrimony. And on the other side, as they which maintain, that the Pope has
no authority in temporalibus directly, but indirectly, in ordine
adspiritualia, amongst other phrases, which they have to express their minds,
besides indirectly, per accidens, and by a certain consequence, they likewise
say, that he has it incidently, secundum quid, secundario, per consecutionem,
and accessorie: so when they speak of the practice of that authority out of
the bounds of S. Peter's patrimony, they do also use the word casualiter. For
the better manifestation of which particulars, this Examinate says, he does
acknowledge that Celsus Mancinus, agreeing with the rest who plead for the
Popes inherent authority, does write thereof in this sort:

108 The Popes Jurisdiction (says Mancinus) may be taken either for that,
which he has potestate aut Cells. Mancinus de iuribus principatuum. page 94.
actu, potentially or actually, and actually in two sorts, either ordinarily or
casually. If the authority, and Jurisdiction of the Pope, be taken for that
which he has potestate potentially, it extends it self over all the world:
but if his actual Jurisdiction be taken, not ordinarily, but casually,
forasmuch as it only has use in the Christian world, it is said to be as
great as the whole Christian world, and ordinarily as great as is S. Peter's
Patrimony. Again, speaking of this Idem ibidem page 89.
great and regal authority so inherent in the Pope, he says, it did lie hid
in the first Bishops of Rome in the Primitive Church until the vineyard of the
Lord had taken deep root, and that the spouse of Christ, which at the first
had no papps, became to be of mature age, and that all that while, for the
space of 350. years, the said power did lie in Martyrdom, and blood, until
afterward the foundations were laid, and the walls were built up, and that
then the same began to show it self in blessed Syluester and his Successors.
But withal he adds, that the use and exercise of the Popes said actual and
casual authority and jurisdiction is not great in the Pope: That if we
consider the Idem ibidem. page 89.
Popes care of spiritual things, he is so occupied in them, being heavenly
matters, as he can scarcely intend to those things, that be terrestrial:
That in Kings and Emperors the use of temporal power is more frequent;
because the matters that they deal in, are not heavenly, but terrene. Mary
(says he) their swords notwithstanding, Idem ibidem. page 98.
and all their temporal power are at the Popes commandment, in that he is
the Lord of the whole Christian world, to whose jurisdiction, all other
jurisdictions are subject, and referred, as to the first fountain, from whence
they flow. And in another place likewise he says, that the preservation both
of particular and universal justice belonging to the Popes Idem ibidem. page
105. and 106.
office; for as much as he cannot be attentive to such terrene affairs, lest
applying himself to these small matters, he might leave celestial things
undone: he deals in such sort with Emperors, Kings and Princes for his own
assistance, as Iethro taught Moses, who following Iethroes counsel did appoint
Judges, to deal in temporal causes, that he might more freely apply himself
to those that were spiritual; he (the said Pope) having notwithstanding in
himself power and authority to correct the errors of such Emperors, Idem
ibidem. page 98.
Kings and Princes, and to judge of their excesses, as there should be cause.
For (says Mancinus further) though Princes are free within their proper
territories, Idem ibidem. page 120.
and may freely use their power and authority: yet they have their bounds and
limits, which they must not pass, and there is a mean in the use of it, which
they are bound to observe: but if they exceed their measure, and pass their
line, then it is the part of Christ's vicar, in whom is the top of both
authorities, to take knowledge of their proceedings, and to remedy them: and
that in matters of greater difficulty and weight, Appeals do therefore lie
from all Kings to the Pope; as when men's rights are overthrown, they are to
fly to the supreme Judge, whose office is to judge such causes.

109 So as (this Examinate says) having thus delivered truly the effect and
substance of Mancinus judgment, touching this point set down by him (the said
Mancinus) at large, and with great variety, according to their opinions who
concur with him, concerning the Popes inherent authority, and jurisdiction
over all the world directly, in causes temporal: it does appear, what his and
their conceit is of the casual practice of that great authority. And he
confesses it to be this in effect: viz: that Emperors and Kings holding their
authority as from the Pope, they are to him as Moses his Judges and rulers were
unto him: and that therefore, when it happens, or falls out casualiter,
that the Pope holds it fit to depose any King from his Crown and kingdom;
to absolve his subjects from their Allegiance, to authorize them to bear arms
against their King so deposed, to command them under pain of Excommunication
so to do, in that being deposed he is no more their King: or otherwise when
he holds it convenient to correct and punish any other Kings for dealing
unjustly with their subjects, upon complaint made unto him, as unto the chief
Judge, if they persist in so doing, he may so deal and proceed with them,
even as Moses might have done, upon any complaint brought unto him in some such
like cases, against any of his Judges and rulers deputed under him: And
furthermore, that if a King so deposed by the Pope, will needs keep his
Kingdom still, if his subjects (notwithstanding the Popes commandment to the
contrary) will not be induced to bear arms against him, nor to withdraw their
obedience from him, but will still honor, obey, and serve him; or if other
Kings will so far contemn the Popes authority, when upon Appeals made unto
him, they do persist in oppressing their subjects, so as the Pope is driven
upon their contempts, to take the like course with them: then in those and the
like cases, says Mancinus and others, the Pope being the highest Mancinus
ibidem page 232.
Bishop, and Christ's vicar, and glistering with regal dignity, may without
all doubt (if he will) move arms, proclaim war, and excite men himself to
battle; and it is also generally by these men held, that the Emperor, and
all other Christian Kings and Princes, are at the Popes commandment, and beck
to draw their swords, and to use all their forces for the putting in execution
of his said Sentences, to the suppressing of the said obstinate Kings, and the
transferring of their kingdoms unto some others.

110 Here this Examinate being asked, what difference there was betwixt these
men's opinions, who hold that the Pope may thus proceed with Kings and princes,
by virtue of his authority in all temporal causes directly, but casualiter;
that is, in such cases as are above expressed, when casually they happen: and
the other side, who although they deny, that the Pope has any such authority
directly; yet they affirm (as it has been often above mentioned) that he has
power to depose kings and to transfer kingdoms in ordine ad spiritualia,
indirectly, per accidens, by a certain consequence, incidently, secundum quid,
secundario, per consecutionem, accessorily, and casualiter: that is, when such
occasions are offered: he this Examinate answoreth, that he must needs
confess, there is no difference at all betwixt them, in respect of their
judgment, touching the lawfulness of the Popes authority, to proceed
casualiter, as is aforesaid, with such obstinate princes, but only this, that
the one part supposes this authority to be inherent in the Pope, as he is
Christ's vicar, which the other denies, but says notwithstanding, that he has
it, though not inherent in him, yet indirectly, and by a consequence; because
all kings and princes when they are baptized, do promise and undertake
inclusiue, that they will for ever maintain the Church, be obedient to the
Pope, and at his commandment, for the suppressing of all such persons
whosoever, as shall oppose themselves against the Catholic faith. Insomuch
that Cardinal Bellarmine, Bell. de Romans Pon. lib. 5. cap. 6.
even in the same Chap. where he remembers the Popes dealing in temporal
causes incidenter and casualiter, incidently and casually, although he
acknowledges, that the Pope, as he is Pope, cannot ordinarily depose princes,
even for a just cause; yet he says, that the Pope may change kingdoms, and
take them from one and give them to another, not as he is princeps Ecclesia
politicus, but as he is summus princeps spiritualis, when they hinder
religion, and taking that course, which brings detriment to men's souls, will
not otherwise be reclaimed.

111 Upon this declaration made by this Examinate upon such apparent grounds
and collections, as he could not deny, it was demanded of him, what his
judgment was, as touching the contents of it. Whereunto he answers, that he
has elsewhere sufficiently opened his mind in that behalf, where he has often
said, that in his judgment the Pope iure diuino, has no authority inherent in
him, or not inherent directly or indirectly, whether it be termed spiritual or
temporal, or a mixed authority, or howsoever it is, or may be called, to
depose kings either for heresy or Apostasy, or for any other cause
whatsoever, or to release their subjects from their obedience, or to authorize
them to bear arms against them, or to excommunicate the subjects of any such
kings that refuse to enter into any such disobedient, rebellious, and
traitorous courses, but continue their faithful and loyal subjects,
notwithstanding, he should tell them never so confidently, that such their
former kings, being by him deposed, were no longer their kings, or any other
allurements or persuasions whatsoever to the contrary. Whereunto this Examinate
now adds, that in his judgment, it is a vain conceit and repugnant to the
Scripture, for any to affirm, that the Pope has any power, authority, or
jurisdiction, either potentially or actually, ordinary or casual, to deal
with kings or princes, or with their subjects, as is above mentioned, or to
hold and maintain, that kings and sovereign princes have their regal
authority from the Pope, or that they are to him, as the rulers and Judges
amongst the Israelites were to Moses, or that he has any authority at all,
as he is Christ's vicar, and S. Peter's successor, to deal with kings and
princes for any cause, or at any time, further then concerns the health of
their souls, and the maintenance of the Catholic faith, by admonitions,
persuasions, and good counsel: and (if those will not serve) then by the
spiritual censures of the Church, and by S. Peter's keys only; and not so
neither, but when it is apparent, that such spiritual censures may in deed
and truly turn to edification, and not to destruction, and that they may be
used without hurt or danger of Catholics either in their bodies, goods, or
lives. All further proceedings of the Pope with kings and sovereign princes,
as the chief pastor of their souls, this Examinate says, he does utterly
dislike, and prays from the bottom of his heart, that hereafter they may
never be practiced.

112 But here this Examinate being put in mind of his own words above
specified, where he acknowledged the Pope to have casualiter some authority in
temporalibus, without the limits of S. Peter's patrimony, though the same were
not inherent in him; and thereupon required to declare his meaning therein, he
says that he neither had nor has any other meaning then this: that when any
questions or controversies arise amongst Kings, Princes, and such other great
persons, as they cannot amongst themselves compound, but yet are contented to
refer the decision or compounding of them unto the Pope, (unto whom they are
all subject in Spiritual matters) he (the said Pope) may lawfully, in this
Examinates judgment, upon this occasion, and so casualiter intermedle and
deal in the said questions and controversies, and order them, for the
establishing of unity, friendship, and concord betwixt the said parties,
although the particulars so questioned, or controuerted, be merely and
altogether of temporal conusance. And also this Examinate further says, that
the Pope may so deal (as he thinks) when any King, Prince, or other great
person will be content, for the strengthening of his own purposes in some
especial matter, to desire the Popes approbation of it. For example, the King
of France having left his former wife, and married another, had by her a
Decretal. lib. 4. cap. 13 qui filij sunt legitimi.
son and a daughter: and being, as it seemed, in doubt, that his son after
him might in that respect, receive some prejudice in his Title to succeed him:
he (the said King) entreated the Pope, for the legitimation of his issue,
whereunto he yielded: the deciding of any man's right or interest to a
Kingdom, no ways properly belonging to the Pope, but casually, as here it
happened, when the King was contented to refer it unto him, and might have done
it himself, but that he thought when the Pope joined with him, that which they
did together would be of greater force.

113 This will appear more plainly by Innocentius his own words in an other
suite of the same nature made unto him; where a Gentleman of Montpeliar, having
likewise put away his wife, and married another, by whom he had children,
Ibidem and in glossa.
was encouraged, by the example of the King of France, to labor to the Pope,
of the legitimating of his children in like sort, quatenus eis natalium
obiectio, ceu exceptio non noceret, quo minas sibi succederent: that the
exception against their birth might not hurt them, but that they should be his
heirs. But Innocentius denying his suite, amongst some other reasons, why he
so did, used these: that the King of France had no superior in his Kingdom
in Temporal causes, but this Gentleman was a Subject: that the King of France
might without any man's hurt, refer the said matter to the Pope, which this
Gentleman could not do in his cause: that the King did need the consent of no
man, for the approouing of that which the Pope had done on his behalf; whereas
if he the said Innotentius should legitimate this Gentleman's children, it would
not avail him, without the assent of the King, or Lord his superior: that the
King had power in that point to submit himself to the Popes jurisdiction,
which this Gentleman had not: and that the King might (in some men's opinions)
of himself have legitimated his said son and daughter, without any
assistance from the Pope. So as this Gentleman's cause was far unlike the
Kings. Hereof Innocentius himself did write to the said Gentleman in this
sort: Insuper cum Rex superiorem in temporalibus minime Ibidem. Per
venerabilem. and citatur a Bellar. de Romans Pontif. lib. 5. cap. 3.
recognoscat, sine iuris alterius loesione, in eo se iurisdictioni nostrae
subijcere potuit, in quo videretur aliquibus, quodper seipsum (non tanquam
pater cum filijs, sed tanquam Princeps cum subditis) potuit dispensare: tuautem
nosceris alijs subiacere, vnde sine-ipsorum forsan iniuria, nisi praestarent
nobis assensum, in hoc subdere te non posses: That is, Moreover inasmuch as the
king does acknowledge no superious in temporal causes, he might lawfully in
that matter, without any man's prejudice, submit himself to our jurisdiction,
wherein (as some hold) he might by his own authority, (not as a father with
his children, but as a prince with his subjects) have himself dispensed but
you are known to be subject unto others, and therefore without some injury
peradventure unto them, except they should yield their assent, you cannot in
this case submit your self unto us: And this is that casual authority, (this
Examinate says) which he attributes to the Pope, out of S. Peter's patrimony,
in other Princes kingdoms, for his dealing in those causes that are temporal,
and do not otherwise belong unto him, to intermedle with, as he is Christ's
Vicar, but as they are compromitted and referred unto him.

114 It was here again required of this Examinate, that he should a little
further open his mind in this point, whether in his judgment, the subjects of
any Christian king may lawfully refer any temporal causes, especially such
as either concern the commonwealth, or their king, unto the Popes
determination, without the kings consent; because it is held by many (as it
has been formerly touched in part out of Mancinus) that they may; when
otherwise they can receive no such ordinary course of Justice, as they think
they ought, or when they account it most expedient for the Commonwealth. To
which purpose sundry examples are alleged, and amongst them this particularly,
of the proceeding once in France, with their king. Hildericus king of France
reigning (as it was thought) unprofitably, and Pepinus in his government under
him, greatly contenting the Realm, the chief of the Nobility, in their
desire to remove him, and advance Pepinus unto his place, being not ignorant,
that if they could procure the Pope (who was then in these Western parts of
great reputation) to concur therein with them, it would greatly surther their
designement, and the better content, both the people, and the Clergy; did send
an Embassage 1^. Mayor. disi. 24. quaest. 2. (...).
to Pope Zachary, then Bishop of Rome, desiring to know of him, an ille deberet
regnare, qui otio torpebat, an ille, qui aestum dieiportabat; whether he ought
to reign, who was altogether idle, or he that did endure the heat of the day.
To whom the Pope answered: quod posterior regnare deberet, that the later ought
to reign. Whereupon the Nobility deposed Hilderick, and created Pepinus their
king.

115 Now forasmuch as this example is commonly used for an argument, that the
Pope may thus deal casually, in temporalibus: and that thereupon it is
ordinarily concluded, that the Pope by such a casualty may depose kings, and
set up others in their rooms: if he this Examinate should mean, that such a
reference, or compromitting of a cause to the Pope, by one side; without the
assent of the other, (as it is not likely, that Hildericus was ever willing to
commit to the Pope his title to the kingdom, whether he should remain king, or
one of his subjects should get it from him) were a lawful occasion offered,
for the Pope to deal casually in temporalibus, as an Arbitrator: that which
he has before said of his meaning, how the Pope might deal in such like
causes casualiter, does cross that which formerly he has delivered, or
rather indeed is flatly repugnant unto it. And therefore he this Examinate was
urged to explicate this difficulty.

116 Whereunto for answer, he says, That in his opinion, this was a
needelesse doubt, in that his words before were plain, when he delivered the
answer of Innocentius to the Gentleman of Montpeliar; he this Examinate
having never heard of such a kind of compromitting a cause to any, by one part,
without the consent of the other: and that therefore he holds it, as
unlawful for the Pope, in such a kind of reference, as above is specified,
without the Kings consent, to take any temporal cause into his hands, to be
ordered by him, as it was for him to have made legitimate the children of the
said gentleman (as is before mentioned) which Innocentius acknowledged he might
not do. And as touching the example alleged, for the deposing of Hildericus,
this Examinate further says, that he concurreth in judgment with Johannes de
Parisijs, Io. Mayor, Iacobus Almain, and Adam Blackwood, with diverse others,
Blackwood apol page 201. and 202.
who writing of that fact, say, that it was not lawful: that the Pope did
yield to an injury, and was not ignorant, the example to be pernicious, so to
let slack the raines to the people for the changing of Scepters, and to
prefer a stranger, with the injury of their own lawful king: that this fact
(being singular) ought to obtain no force of a law: that we are to live by
laws, and not by examples: that we ought not so much to regard what is done,
as what ought to be done.

117 That the Nobility of France sent to the Pope, because the University of
Paris did not then Ioh. Mayor in lib. 4. sent. did. 24. apud Gersonem.
flourish; insinuating that if it had, they had gone no further, but relied
upon their judgment: that where it is said, that Zachary did depose
Hildericke, it is thus to be understood, viz: that he was aliqua causa motiua,
a certain moving cause, why the Noblemen of France deposed him; that from such
particulars, quae ex devotion ad Ecclesiam, and non debito juris fiunt, which
are done of devotion to the Church, and not by any right of law, nothing is to
be drawn in consequence, as neither from many other examples, where Emperors
did choose the Bishops of Rome; and likewise, that some Bishops of Rome had
been deposed by Emperors, and (as the Ecclesiastical history recites,) many
Bishops did refer their complaints to Constantine, ex quibus nullum potest
sumi argumentum, from which examples no argument can be drawn.

118 That the Canon Alius, did. 15. q. 6. which Iacobus Almain de potest.
Eccles. and laica. quaest. 2. cap. 8. Magna glossa Canon. Alius did. 15. q. 6.
says that Pope Zachary deposed the king of France, and placed Pepin the
father of Charles in his room, is thus to be understood: Zacharias deposuit
Regem, id est, deponentibus consensit: Zachary deposed the king, that is, gave
his consent to them that deposed him: that then there was no University at
Paris, the same being afterward erected in the days of Charles the great:
and that thereupon there being few learned men in France, they had recourse to
the Pope, and sic deposuit, id est, consensit vti possent deponere, and sic non
deposuit authoritatiue, that so he deposed Hildericke, that is, he gave his
consent, that the Nobility of France might depose him, and that the Pope did
not depose him by any authority.

119 That the Pope did never depose the king of Ioh. de Parisiis de potest.
regia and Papali. cap. 13.
France, except that which Zachary did, in the deposition of Hildericus, may
be expounded deposuit, id est, deponentibus consensit, sicut exponit glossa:
Zachary deposed the King, that is, he gave his consent to those that did
depose him, as the gloss does expound it: that from such singular facts of
devotion to the Church or to the person, or of favor, or for some other cause,
and not in right of law, arguments may not be made: that whereas it is read in
histories that Boniface obtained of Phocas the Emperor, that the Church of
Rome should be the head of all Churches, because the Church of Constantinople
did write herself so; it might be collected by such a like argument, that it
appertained to the Emperor to transfer the primacie of one Church to
another: as likewise, whereas Isidore says, that Constantine the Emperor did
decree that the Sea of Rome should hold the principality over the four chief
Sees, Antioch, Alexandria, Constantinople, and Jerusalem: God forbid, that
thereupon we should say, that the Church of Rome has her Primacy over
Churches, and the disposition of them, from Emperors. So as, this Examinate
says, that which was done, as touching the deposition of Hildericke the king
of France, does no way alter his opinion before showed touching the Popes
authority in temporalibus casualiter; when they are lawfully referred unto
him, as in the Sect. 113. he has specified.

120 Here this Examinate was put in mind of certain words of his, in the
said 113. Section; where saying that the Pope, as he is Christ's vicar, could
not otherwise deal in temporalibus casualiter, then as here he has said: he
seems to insinuate, that in some other respect he might deal in temporal
causes with Kings, for the deposing of them, and proceeding with their
subjects, as has been before diverse times mentioned. And the rather it so
seems, in that he having before cited out of Mancinus, how the Pope has
authority to proclaim war, and so become a man at arms, did let that point
pass him without answer unto it.

121 For satisfaction whereof, this Examinate says, that in his judgment, it
is as lawful for the Pope to make war within his own Territories, which he
holds as a Temporal Prince, when he is driven thereunto, through the
disobedience of his subjects, or in their defense against other Princes, as it
is for any King or civil State so to do, upon such or the like occasions: and
that Iacobus Gretzerus says well (if this Examinate does rightly understand
him) to this purpose, and to the justification of all in effect, which this
Examinate has set down, throughout the whole course of this his Examination,
touching his denial of the Popes authority (either directly, as he is Pope,
or indirectly in ordine ad spiritualia, as he is Summus Princeps spiritualis,
the Supreme spiritual Prince) to depose Kings, and release their subjects from
the oaths of their allegiance, etc. where he writes in this sort: Cogit
Pontifex Romanus poenis externis spiritualibus, vt Excommunicatione: Gretzerus
defens. controuers. Bellar. colum. 1404.
item poenis externis temporalibus, and corporalibus, qua and ipse est Princeps
politicus, and qua Principum politicorum opem implorare potest, vt haereticorum
petulantiam and licentiam poenis temporalibus compescant: that is, That the
Bishop of Rome has authority to compel men by outward spiritual
punishments, as by Excommunication, and also by outward temporal and corporal
punishments, as he is himself a civil Prince, and as he may implore the
assistance of other civil Princes, that they may repress by temporal
punishments the wantonness and liberty of heretics.

122 And this Examinate also further says, that for ought he can Judge,
whereas some exceptions were taken to the Popes sending of certain small
forces into Ireland, about the year 1580. to assist the Earl of Desmond:
Cardinal Allen in answer of them does politically justify that his fact,
where he writes in this manner: The chief Bishops of Christ's Church, our
supreme Pastors in earth, by Gods providence, and by the graunts of Card.
Allens answer to the English Justice. page 144.
our first most Christian Emperors and Kings, and by the humble and zealous
devotion of the faithful Princes and people afterward, have their temporal
states, dominions, and patrimonies, whereby they most justly hold and possess
the same, and are thereby lawful Princes temporal, and may most rightfully by
their Sovereignty make wars, in their own and other men's just quarrel, as
occasion shall urge them there unto.

123 By reason of diverse particulars delivered by this Examinate in this his
answer to the last doubt propounded unto him, it was first demanded of him,
whether in his judgment the Pope has authority to command any king, being
held for a Catholic, to take arms against any his neighbor kings, deemed by
him for heretics, for the suppressing of them by temporal coertions, when
the Pope shall judge it fit: because it might seem very strange for any man to
conceive, that Christ ever gave to S. Peter any jurisdiction, authority, or
power, in favor of religion, to set kings together by the ears. It might have
some probability, that if a king, who disalloweth of the Popes supremacy, and
of many other corrupt points of popish doctrine, should send his forces into
any other temporal princes dominions, to make wars, of purpose to abolish
the Popes authority, and plant there the reformed religion by him professed;
then in this case, the Pope might solicit some other kings adjoining, to
oppose them selves and make wars against him. But to imagine, that when a
King proceeds no further, then to order matters in his own kingdom, by the advice of the States thereof both Ecclesiastical and Temporal, as it shall be
judged by him and them most expedient: any Bishop or Spiritual person
whosoever may take upon him to proclaim or excite war, and thrust other
kings to assail him by force in his own kingdom and country: every such
conceit wants authority in the new Testament, and has no example for many
years in the purest and best times of the Church, and besides it is repugnant
to that which this Examinate has before delivered. For kingdoms being neither
founded upon faith nor grace, how can they be shaken, under pretense that
either of them is impugned? Christianity may well be thought to bind a king,
who reckons himself subject to the Bishop of Rome in spiritual causes, in
them to submit him self unto him: but to command him to make war, and
thereby hazard peradventure his own kingdom, or spend the blood either of his
own Subjects, or of the subjects of any other Christian King, when the Pope
thinks good; is a very bloody and an unchristian opinion.

124 Unto this question and the parts thereof, this Examinate says, that he
believes, that all Christian Kings and Princes are bound to do, what they can
for the maintenance of the Catholic faith, (whether the Pope does require
them so to do, or not) against any that do endeavor to suppress it. But he
holds that such their duty binds them no further, then so to maintain
religion within their own kingdoms, if need be, and not to make war in that
respect against any, who do contain themselves and their proceedings
aforesaid, within their own bounds, and do not seek by force to suppress,
in any other Countries, that are adjacent unto them, the Religion there
established, otherwise then in his own. But withal he adds, that he holds
it to be the duty of all such Catholic kings, to do what they can with any
King auerse from the Pope, for the winning of him unto his Holiness by
persuasion, and by every other good means: but in no wise by the sword, or by
soliciting his Subjects to rebellion, or to make a part of his own Kingdom
against him, or otherwise to endanger his Person, Crown, or State. Besides,
for as much as (this Examinate says) he believes, that the Pope has no
inherent authority in himself in temporalibus, out of S. Peter's patrimony,
and that the regal authority is not derived from the Pope, or held immediately
of him; he does not find, how the Pope, as he is either a Spiritual, or a
civil Prince, has authority to command the sword of any Kings otherwise then
by entreatie, and in the cases by him this Examinate above specified; or that
they are bound by force of their Baptism, to obey him, if so he do command
them.

125 Secondly, were it granted to this Examinate, that the Pope, as a Civil
Prince, might lawfully have sent his forces into Ireland as is aforesaid, and
denounce war when he thinks it expedient, against any King, as Cardinal
Allen has written: yet it is fit, that this Examinate should open himself in
his duty to his Majesty, whether in his judgment, when the Pope will needs
take upon him to play the temporal Prince, and become a warrior, he holds
it to be at such times more lawful, and agreeable to the Scriptures, either
for the Pope, or for any of his instruments, to persuade the Subjects of any
King, with whom he contendeth, that because he is a Protestant (as that
general name is grown in use) and denies the Popes supremacy, and embraces
the Religion reformed, and purged of sundry gross errors, and points of
superstition, and is thereupon either by name, or in general terms by virtue
of some other Bulls, Excommunicated, or because he seeks to alter the ancient
Religion, which formerly they, or their forefathers did profess, therefore it
is lawful for them, nay, that they are bound in conscience to renounce their
obedience unto him, and to assist the Popes forces: then it is lawful for the
Emperor, or some other Kings (whose predecessors had made the Pope a Civil
prince, by bestowing upon him so large possessions) when they have resolved of
a warlike course against him, to persuade his Subjects, and authorize them, to
join with them, and to bear arms against him, upon these or any other such
like suggestions, viz: that the Pope abused his place, and behaved himself
otherwise, then of ancient times his predecessors had done: that it was never
the meaning either of their former renowned Emperors, or of any other Kings,
or of the most famous Romans, and Italians their Noble progenitors (who once
governed the chiefest part of the world) that thereby he should take courage,
and boldness to encounter (as he did) with them their successors, or to
tyrannize, as his custom was, over them his pretended Subjects, and over their
sometimes so glorious a City: and that therefore, if they would join their
forces with theirs, they would restore them unto their ancient honors and
liberty.

126 To this question this Examinate says, that it is a point of State, how
and when Princes may make wars, but he is sure, that they ought not so to
do, except the cause be just. Again he confesses, that as some hold, the
Pope may depose no secular Prince, though he abuse his authority in perniciem
Christianitatis and fidei, to the destruction Jacob. Almain de potest.
Ecclesiastica and Laica. Quaest. 1. cap. 9.
of Christianity or of the faith: but may only declare him worthy to be
deposed, and therefore forbid his subjects under pain of Excommunication, to
perform any duty unto him, whereby in effect he loses his kingdom, when no
man does regard him: so they do think, that in the same sort, if the Pope do
abuse his authority, Idem ibidem. Quaest 2. cap. 8.
in detrimentum Reipublicae, to the detriment of the Common wealth, the
Emperor may depose him, under pain of confiscation of all his temporal
goods, which he holds of the Emperor, and of the king as a vassal: and
that by virtue of such a Sentence given by the Emperor, they to whom it
appertains, shall in the end be compelled, to remove him from his authority
of the high Bishopric. But of these and such like points, this Examinate
says he will not take upon him to judge: only he acknowledges that so far,
as his reading and learning stretches, he does in his conscience verily
believe, touching the said question to him propounded, as here ensues.

127 That neither the Pope has any authority to depose the Emperor, nor the
Emperor to depose the Pope: they may deal one with another, for reforming of
abuses, but they ought not to proceed to such extremities: that as he has
before oftentimes said, that the Pope has no authority at all by any ways or
means whatsoever, given unto him Iure diuino, to depose any Protestant king,
or Sovereign Prince, nor to absolve his subjects from their Allegiance, nor to
authorize them, or command them, to bear arms against him: so neither may he
lawfully, when he comes or sends, as a Civil Prince, his forces and men of
war, to assail any such king in his own Country (though he take that
course in defense of Religion) seek to persuade the subjects of such a King,
to rebel against him, by joining their forces with the Popes; or if he or any
of his instruments so do, suggesting, that otherwise they shall incur the
Popes curse, yet they the said subjects ought not to regard it, but remain
still as firmly bound, to obey their King, and take part with him, as if the
Pope had never conceived any displeasure against him.

128 That therefore he must needs confess, the positions following to be very
unsound, and repugnant unto the Scriptures, and the ancient Catholic
doctrine, which is always to be preferred, before men's new devises, be they
for their learning and places, never so eminent in the Church.

129 It is godly and honorable to fight in such order Card. Allen. a True
defense. page 103.

temporal Sovereign.

131 Furthermore this Examinate says, that he cannot choose, but confess from
his heart, that he does dislike and disallow all the Arguments, Card. Allens

into Ireland during the late rebellion of the Earl of Tyrone, either from
Salamanca, or from any place else, tending to the same purpose with the former:
for example.

132 That the late Queen being deposed, and her D. John D'Aquila his
Proclamation.
Subjects absolved from the oath of their fidelity, by the highest Bishop,
unto whom he that reigns in the highest, the King of kings had given all
power, to pluck up, destroy, plant, and edify, ita vt ipsos Reges temporales,
si ad spirituale aedificium expedierit, vsque ad depositionem a Regno puniat,
so as he may punish temporal kings, if it be available to spiritual
edification, be it to the deposition from their kingdoms: the Irish were bound
by the commandments of God, and the obedience which they did owe to the
highest Bishop, to toyne with Don John D'Aquila, sent thithey from the King of
Spain by the Popes entreaty.

133 That for as much as the Bishop of Rome had Ibidem.
now procured forces to be sent unto them (the Irish) for the defense of their
faith, they should all upon notice of the said Don John's proclamation, with all
their power come unto him: and that he would prosecute to death as heretics
and hateful enemies to the Church all those, who contemning his counsel,
should continue their obedience unto the English.

134 That it was lawful for the Bishop of Rome, Determinat. Salaman^. 1602.
by force of arms to punish those, who do oppugn the Catholtcke faith: that
the war undertaken by Tyrone, authoritate summi Pontificis, by the Popes
authority, against the late Queen, that oppugned the Catholic faith, was
just: and that all the Catholics were bound to join with him, with a great
merit and hope of the greatest eternal retribution: that they deserved as much
thereby, as if they bare arms against the Turk: that all those Catholics
did sin mortally, that did follow the tents of the English against Tyrone:
that they could never obtain everlasting salvation, nor be absolved from
their sins by any Priest, except they did first repent, and forsake the
English: that the same judgment likewise was to be given of them, who in that
war did favor the English with arms, and provision, paid their ancient
tributes, or did contribute any thing unto them: and that they, who followed
Tyrone, were no rebels, nor denied any obedience, that was due, nor did usurp
unjustly the lands of the Queen, but did rather by a most just war, free
their Country from a wicked Tyrant, and defend the Catholic faith, as it
became Christians and Catholics.

135 With the consideration of these things, this Examinate says, his very
heart is wounded, finding such strength of wit, and pretenses of religion so
intolerably abused to the effusio^ of blood, and for private respects, such as
in his conscience, God does not allow, nor the doctrine of the Catholic
Church (agreed upon) does approve. And he is the more moved herewith, (he
auoweth) partly because so many worthy English writers have of later years,
run into this violent course, laboring to uphold it with all their strength
and ability of learning: and partly for that he fears (except it may please
God, to move the Popes heart, for the staying of it) what issue it will have in
the end Sanguis petit sanguinem: blood will have blood. The Church did increase
by the sufferings of Martyrs: but it may perhaps decrease, by seeking of blood.
That hitherto was never accounted the seed of the Church. And touching the
reasons from Spain, carry what color they shall, yet never was it heard of
before (for ought this Examinate has read) that the subjects of any King might
not assist their Sovereign in his wars without the Popes allowance. And
besides, it is not likely, that the king of Spain will in his princely
judgment approve, that as D. John D'aquila says, the Pope may depose any king
from his Crown, if it be expedient for the Church. If the Irish had not
engaged themselves too far in the rebellion then on foot, before this
Spanish General his Proclamation, they could never out of doubt have been much
moved with it. It was the conquering of the Kingdom for his Master, that he
aimed at; or otherwise, their faith for him might have lien in the dust. Kings
have their own ends in such cases, and not the Popes. Neither was the
determination of Salamanca of any greater weight. The authors of it sought to
promote their Sovereigns affairs, as if they had been better Statesmen, then
Divines. For it will hardly appear either in the Scriptures, or in any ancient
Father or Council, that subjects did ever merit heaven, by bearing of arms
against their Sovereigns.

136 Here this Examinate was further put in mind of the charge, which is
imposed upon the Romish priests, now (as it seems) under his government, how
they are to proceed for the advancement of the Catholic faith. Thus hereof
diverse have written, being men of great estimation.

137 The zeal and duty of Gods Priests is notably Card. Allen Admon. page
32. and 33.
commended unto us in the cause of Athalia, etc. whom Ichoiada the high Priest,
calling unto him forces both of the Priests and people, caused to be slain:
lo this is the Zeal and authority of Priests, for the maintenance of
righteousness and religion.

138 Priests and Prophets have been principal workers Idem ibidem page 34.
and Gods ministers in the deprivation of princes: wherein the Prophet Elie was
so notorious, that to his honor it is thus said of him in holy writ: He cast
down kings and destroyed them: and of Elizeus in the same place, thus: He
never feared prince, nor could of no man be overcome. And thus it was in the
old Testament.

139 That in the new Testament the Priests have Idem ibidem page 34. and 35.
much more sovereign authority, and the prince, far streighter charge to
obey, love, and cherish the Church: that now every kingdom that does not
serve her, shall perish: and that now Prelates have authority to forbid us the
company of heretics, idolaters, blasphemers, and not so much as to salute
them, much more not to obey them.

140 That when by the impiety of the prince, the Stapleton alias Rossaeus de
iusta Reipub. Christianae authoritate, etc. page 638.
state of religion, and of the Church is brought into danger: then it is the
duty of godly men, and Monks, peragrare civitates etc. to go from city to
city, and from province to province, to admonish, exhort, and solicit all
Christian men to that manly constancy and fortitude, which does not only
consist in words, but in deeds, and to preach, that all oaths and covenants
made unto kings against the Catholic faith, are of no force, nor ought to be
observed by a Christian man.

141 That Priests ought to be the first, that must Will. Raynolds de iusta
abdicatione, Henr. 3. page 57. and 58.
leave the oppressor of religion, and become therein an example unto others:
that so Iehoiada the Priest, arming the Levites in the Temple against Athalia,
gave unto the Centurions, lances, shields, and the targets of king David; and
placing without the Temple the people with daggers, commanded her to be
slain: that Elie the Prophet did kill 450. false prophets, whether the king
and Queen would or not: that Azarias the priest with 80. priests valiant men
did resist Oziah then king, the usurper of the sacred ministry; and first
thrust him out of the Temple, being made a leper, and then out of his kingdom:
that the Maccabees, men of the priestly stock, valiantly fighting against
tyrants for the law of God, have long since given a worthy and a notable
example unto priests and Christian preachers, of exciting men to war and
arms against tyrants to religion, whether domestical or foreign.

142 And in another place, the said Stapleton: Stapleton alias Rossaeus lib.
citato page 579.
Are Bishops (says he) bound to instruct such as are committed to their
charge, that they should refrain from the conversation of an heretical king;
that they ought not to assist him, either in war, or peace; that all men,
being ignorant, yea, idiots ought to learn to reason after this sort, Such a
man is an heretic, and therefore he has no power over us that be
Catholics: and are not noble men likewise bound, to instruct their servants
that they ought to resist such an heretic, now no king, as he who has no
right to his kingdom, but a tyrant, or a thief iniustly usurping dominion
over them? Does the holy Ghost teach us, that the hate of an heretic is to
be offered unto God for a great sacrifice, and that we are to avoid him as a
canker; and yet shall it be held unlawful to resist that canker, which
endeavors to corrupt us, and to repel his force from us with our swords, who
are commanded to cut off our own flesh, if it be infected with such a canker?

143 Upon the hearing of these particulars: Alas, Alas (quoth this Examinate)
what mean you to increase my sorrow? I have said enough before to show you,
how much I do detest these kind of positions, as being infected, if not with
a canker, yet with many untruths. The examples in them are strangely wrested,
and do not prove that which is intended by them. God himself, and not Samuel
did appoint, that David should succeed king Saul: but it was far from both
their intentions, that Saul should be deposed: and so he continued king, as
long as he lived. Iehoiada the high Priest took part with the kings son, the
heir apparent to the Crown, wherein he dealt as a dutiful subject, and as
all Priests and subjects ought to deal in the like case. And what kings did
the Prophet Elie cast down and destroy? He said unto Achab, as a Prophet
inspired Lyra super 48. Ecclesiastici.
with knowledge, of things to come, that in the place where dogs licked up the
blood of Naboth, they should lick up his blood also. And in like sort unto
Ochozia; because thou have sent messengers to ask counsel of Beelzebub, the
god of Acharon, therefore thou shall not descend from the bed, whereupon thou
lie, but shall die. Thus Lyra does expound those words: and Hugo Cardinalis
also to the same effect, Cardinalis in eundem locum.
saying: Thou did cast down kings (i) deijciendos praedixisti: thou did
foretell they should be cast down; Adperniciem (i) propter perniciem suam:
for their wickedness: Et fregisti facile potentiam ipsorum, and thou did
easily break their power, that is, confringendam praedixisti, thou did
foretell their power should be broken. And in like sort, both of them do
expound the words, touching Elizeus, how being a Prophet, he was not afraid of
Iehoshaphat, the king of Judah, to do the message of God unto him, nor of the
messengers of the king of Assyria, that came to apprehend him. The prophets
that were slain, were convicted miraculously from heaven, to be false
prophets: and thereupon through Elias motion, which was agreeable to the law of
God, the people with the Kings consent (for otherwise it is more then probable
he might have withstood it) did kill them. Whereas therefore it is said that
Elias slew them: Lyra says, that he did it per populum sibi in hoc
assistentem, by the people therein assisting him; adding therewith, forte
occidit aliquos manu propria, peradventure he slew some of them with his own
hands. But that is but a guess: and peradventure he did not. And touching
Azarias, Genebrard. Chronol. de Azaria.
being about the 27. year of his reign stricken with leprosy, he lived apart
out of Jerusalem, according to the law. But yet he continued king 25. years
after, the text it self making mention of the 38. 39. 50. and 52. years,
wherein he is said to reign as king of Judah, though by reason of his disease
Ioathan his son governed his palace, and the whole land under him: the years
of whose reign afterward began not to be reckoned, till his father was dead;
and then being (as Theodoret observes) haeres regni, the heir of the
Theodoret. in lib. 4. Reg.
kingdom, he did succeed his father, and reigned 16. years. And concerning
the Maccabees, they were in their times great princes, and fought valiantly
both for God and their country, against certain neighbor kings, especially
of Egypt and Assyria, who did mightily trouble and afflict the whole land of
Canaan, as all true hearted English men were to do, if any king or prince upon
any pretense whatsoever, should attempt by force to subdue his Majesty, and
his dominions, thereby to bring them into servitude and slavery.

144 Also for the new Testament (this Examinate says) though the Priesthood
cannot be too much magnified (as the humors of men are now adays)
nevertheless it has no such bloody courses annexed unto it, as the said
authors (otherwise very worthy persons in their times) do pretend. Christ
indeed, and so also his Apostles went from place to place, from city to city,
and from country to country, preaching and planting the true Catholic
faith, which contains the doctrine of obedience to Kings and Sovereign
Magistrates. And where there was one Christian then, if there had been a
thousand, and so proportionably for every one; neither Christ, nor any of his
Apostles would have moved them to any arms, or disobedience against the civil
Magistrates, although they were at that time very great persecutors, and
impugners of the Gospel. The like may also be said for the ages succeeding:
when such going from place to place, and preaching, as doctor Stapleton
speaks of, would of a certeintie have been utterly condemned. And how glad
(says he this Examinate) should I have been, if these kinds of positions,
now urged upon me, had been left to Buchananus and such of his followers, as
have run that race? And therefore he humbly desired, that he might be no
further troubled with these vncatholicke and bloody novelties, the same being
most repugnant to the duty and office of a true Catholic priest: and the
rather, because his intermedling so much with them (though he could not well
choose, except he should have spoken against his conscience) does tend more
(he fears) to his particular discredit, then (as many men do now stand
affected) to any such religious use or edification, as this Examinate wishes,
that all his words and works might ever effect, and attain unto.

145 Here it being held convenient to demand of him this Examinate, whether he
thought, that upon the occasion offered unto him, and charge laid upon him in
his Majesty's name, to deliver his conscience and judgment, as well in these
last points propounded unto him, as likewise in all the premises of this his
Examination, he should by the discharging of his duty therein, grow to any
discredit either with priests, or Lay Catholics: and not rather, that if all
he had delivered should happen to be published, it would procure him more
favor, and greater reputation with them: he answers, that of the last point
(the increase of his credit) he has small hope, and that he has already
felt some experience of the former, in that there being but a suspicion
already cast abroad, that he continues in the justification of the
lawfulness to take the oath of Allegiance, the very conceit of it, before they
be acquainted with that which he has said in this his Examination, does much
offend many, as he has been informed, and as in his private estate he does
very sensibly feel. Neither can he (as he says) expect from them any thing
else, but coffeehouse, and grudging against him, whiles the Popes Briefes
procured by surreption and false suggestions (as he thinks in his
conscience) do prevail so much with them, or until it shall please God to
abate the heat of some spirits, and replenish all their hearts with true
knowledge in these matters, and with greater humility and patience, then now
he says he can well boast of.

146 Lastly, forasmuch as it is most evident to his Majesty, and the State,
viz: how the Catholics in England do now stand affected: how they do
generally dislike the oath of Allegiance: how of late few of the Laity (in
respect of the multitude) will yield to take it: how since the Popes Breues
came over, the priests, all of them almost do impugn it, and dissuade all
Catholics from taking of it; and how they labor and travail hither and
thither, preaching and teaching, that the Pope has authority to depose his
Majesty, to absolve his subjects from their oaths of Allegiance, to authorize
them thereupon to bear arms against him, and to machinate all the mischief
they can against his State and Person: that although his Majesty be not
excommunicated by name, yet (by their doctrine) he stands excommunicate in
general terms by sundry Bulls, in that he allows not of the Popes
Supremacy, etc. and that therefore, if opportunity serve, they may set on
foot any wicked designement against him: And furthermore, how when they
profess obedience upon any occasion, it is but dissembled, and does bind them
no longer, but until they shallbe able, by reason of their numbers and
strength, to encounter his Majesty, without any great danger to themselves:
How there are many youths daily sent over beyond the seas to become Priests,
and being Priests, are every year sent back hither, of purpose to increase the
number and strength of the said Catholics: And how all such Priests, by
virtue of their office, are bound to draw as many as they can, from their
Allegiance to the King, and upon every fit occasion to stir up his subjects
to mutiny and rebellion, as is above mentioned: Forasmuch (it was said) as
these points and many other such like are very evident and manifest: it was
earnestly demanded of this Examinate, he being a man of years; mature
judgment, and good discretion, as he was reputed by the Pope himself (it
seems) and many others, when he was made Archpriest of England, and an
Apostolical protonotarie, what course in his wisdom and conscience, he
thinks fit his Majesty, and the State should hold, being resolved in
religion as they are, to withstand those evils, which of necessity in time
must ensue, except either by punishments they be out of hand prevented, or that
the Pope do himself reclaim both Priests and Catholics from such
inordinate, tumultuous, and traitorous courses, giving them liberty, so as
they retain still their opinions of his pretended Supremacy in spiritual
causes, to take the oath of Allegiance, that thereby they may secure his
Majesty and the State, of their obedience, duty, and fidelity both toward
him, in all causes and matters temporal, and toward their native Country.

147 Unto all which particulars, this Examinate answers, that this is a
matter far above his reach: that he knows his Majesty to be a King endowed
with many singular virtues, amongst the which his mercy and clemency are very
eminent: that his Majesty and the State are exceeding provident to prevent all
dangers: that the number of Priests is nothing, if it be compared to the
number of Ministers, which are, and so will continue here in England; that
there is no likelihood, that so few Priests in respect of the said Ministers
should ever be able to draw so many to the Pope, as they have power and means
to withhold men from him: that he hops, if ever the Pope may be truly
informed of the State of England, he will enforce all Catholics, to hold a
dutiful temper toward their Prince: that it may be, that in short time the
heat of all disordered inventions will be quenched: that although men of
youth and vigor delighting in novelties, are likely enough to continue a while
heady; yet he has some hope, that the grauer sort will have recourse to the
ancient practice of the sincerest Catholics: that generally all the
Catholics in England, howsoever they are scrupulous in conscience, and may be
a little mislead, have sincere and true hearts, unto his Majesty, and their
Country: that he doubts not, but these devises, and phrases of deposing of
Kings, and exciting of Subjects to Rebellion, will grow both verbally and
really out of use, and be forgotten: that this Examinate, as long as he
continues Archpriest, will for his part, do the uttermost of his power what
he can, to move all Catholics to continue their obedience, and duty
toward his Majesty, and not to give ear to any thing that may tend to the
contrary: that doing what he is able, there can no more be well expected from
him: that he has in the whole course of this his long examination, delivered
his conscience and judgment sincerely and truly, without any causion of what
nature or kind soever: so as he will never hereafter doubt, but that his
Majesty and the State will ever repute him (as indeed he is, and so will
always continue) a most loyal, faithful, and duetifull subject. And hereunto
he adds, that the remembrance, and due consideration of all the premises
has wrought so with him, as he has even of conscience and compassion over
some men otherwise affected, then they ought to be (in his judgment) directed
his letter unto all the Catholics of England both Ecclesiastical and Lay, to
the end, they may better bethink themselves touching these points, and
conform all their cogitations and actions to such duty and obedience toward
his Majesty, as by the word of God they are bound: and as all the ancient
Christians did, and all good Catholics still remain obliged to do.
Whereupon he desired for Gods sake, that thus his Examination might end, and
therein he had his desire.

Georgius Blakwellus Archipr. Anglorum, and Protonotarius Apostolicus.

MASTER BLAKWELS Letter to the Romish Catholics in England.
VEry Reverend and my dearest beloved brethren, both Priests and people
Catholic: four servant in bands George Blakwell, lately your fellow laborer
in Christ's Vineyard, and your faithful pastor and Archpriest, do remember
you always in my prayers, that Almighty God, through our Lord Jesus Christ may
grant unto you peace, patience, humility, and true obedience, not only to
those, who have the especial charge of your souls: but likewise to Civil
Magistrates (according to his holy ordinance) King James, our lawful
Sovereign, and such as be in authority under him, unto whom the protection of
your bodies, goods, and lives is committed, that you may lead a quiet and
peaceable life in all godliness and honesty.

You are not ignorant of the oppositions, and parts-taking, concerning the Oath
of Allegiance to his Majesty, whether with a safe conscience it may be taken
or not; nor how I have been blamed by diverse, and especially by Cardinal
Bellarmine, a worthy and eminent man in the Church, for my judgment, and
former proceedings in that behalf: neither also, what the Popes holiness has
signified unto you in his two Briefes, touching that matter. Which may
peradventure make you to wonder, and grow jealous of my sincerity in the
Catholic faith, when you shall find me, notwithstanding all that hitherto I
have either heard or seen, still to continue in my former opinion, and to
acquaint you with it, accounting it my duty both before God and the world so
to do.

I know what is convenient, and profitable for the Church, and what authority
the Bishops of Rome have put in practice, with good success and approbation,
against sundry Emperors, Kings, and Princes, for many years: and wish that
the same had ever bin so mildly, and temperately used, as that it might never
have been impugned, nor called in question by any. But now that this point is
so thoroughly searched into, not only by our adversaries, but by our selves
likewise, and I being pressed, as I have bin, to deliver my judgment sincerely
and truly, as in the sight of God, and accordingly to take the said oath: and
since newly again more earnestly urged then before: how could I choose but
acknowledge what I thought, so far as my learning reaches, except I should
have sinned against mine own conscience, and incurred thereby the wrath of
God, who needs by no untruths to have his Church and the honor of it
vpheld, and maintained by any.

It is one thing, what may be yielded unto, and put in practice de facto, and
by positive laws; and another, what may truly be challenged iure diuino:
which second branch is that, which is now amongst our own brethren so
controuerted, and diversely defended, as I fear greater prejudice will grow
thereby to Catholic religion, then is iudiciously, as yet foreseen, or
provided for, to be prevented. For it can never be justified (say what men
list) that the doctrine of the Church does by any true exposition, or
deduction any way diminish or empeach the Sovereignty, and honor of Emperors,
kings and princes, but does indeed confirm and establish them: the contrary
conceit whereof was falsely imputed to the Christians in the glorious ages of
the Church, which did succeed the Apostles, and ought still to be as much
impugned and detested now, as it was then.

That which Cardinal Bellarmine has written to this purpose, is sound and
Catholic, and will never by any quirke be avoided. Christ (says he) did not,
nor does take kingdoms Bell. de Romans Pont. lib. 5. cap. 3.
from them, to whom they did belong. For Christ came not to destroy those
things which were well settled, but to establish them. And therefore when a King
becomes a Christian, he does not lose his earthly kingdom, which by right
he held, but purchases a new interest to an everlasting kingdom. Otherwise
the benefits received by Christ should be hurtful to Kings, and grace should
destroy nature. And again, Princes infidels are the true and supreme Princes
of their Idem ibidem. cap. 2.
kingdoms: for dominion is not founded either in grace, or in faith: so as the
Pope has no authority to meddle with them. As long then as kings be
Ethnickes, they are sure of their interest in their kingdoms, and of the
obedience of their subjects; the very law of Nature does ratify both: and can
you conceive, that as soon as they are become Christians, their case is
altered, in the assurance of their temporal estates? Must it be pretended,
that the benefit received by Christ, does no way prejudice the interest that
Kings have in their kingdoms: but when they have submitted themselves to the
doctrine of the Gospel, in hope of the kingdom of heaven, and to have their
states bettered, and their subjects settled, as touching their obedience,
according to the precepts of Christ and his Apostles, agreeably unto the moral
Law of God: must then upon any occasion, grace destroy nature, or dominion be
shaken, which is not founded in faith? Think you, that it was ever the intent
either of Constantine the great, or of any other Kings or Princes, to receive
the Gospel, or to join their Regal authority with the Ecclesiastical,
thereby to strengthen Bishops in the execution of their offices, with any
purpose, that the power Ecclesiastical should swallow up, depresse, or ouertop
their temporal Sovereignty?

Assuredly (my dear brethren) such cogitations as these are scandalous to
Christianity, and ought to make no impression in your souls, otherwise then
to eschew them. Baptism does work no such alteration in kings or any other:
it tends to the destruction of the kingdom of Satan, but does no way
empaire or subject unto any their temporal estates, otherwise then as they
shall be moved in charity, and honor, where they have received spiritual
blessings, there to bestow their benefits and favors temporal. The
conjunction of the Church with temporal kingdoms to make one Christian body,
does make no other transmutations, nor confound their governments and
functions; they do still remain distinct as they did before; so as neither
can any Emperor, King, or civil Magistrate, take upon him the administration
of the keys of the kingdom of heaven, nor the execution of any other parts of
priestly duties; nor any Priest, Bishop, or the Pope himself challenge, in
right of the Church, and as they are Bishops, any interest or power in the
temporal sword, to manage the same, as they think fit, either themselves, or
by others at their direction: it being a power given only by God unto Kings
and Princes, to take vengeance on them that do evil, and to be yielded unto,
not because of wrath only, but also for conscience sake.

Neither may the words of God to the Prophet Jeremy, where he says, I have
set thee Ierem. cap. 1.
over nations, and over kingdoms, to pluck up, and to throw out, and to
destroy, and throw down, to build, and to plant, be truly enforced to give
authority to his Holiness, for the transferring of kingdoms from one to
another, or to depose kings, for any cause whatsoever, or to absolve their
subjects from their allegiance, or to authorize them to bear arms against
their Sovereigns, or to root out, and destroy any kingdom, king, or prince,
under pretense of building, or planting some other. This was far differing
from the meaning of the holy Ghost: which in my judgment is more truly and
syncerely expounded by that worthy Cardinal, Hugo Barcbionensis, about 368.
years since, (whether you will take the meaning of it literally or mystically)
where he writes in this sort: I have placed thee over nations Hugo. Card. in
Iere. cap. 1.
and Kingdoms, vt euellas, (i) Iudaeos esse euellendos de terra sua, enuncies:
that thou may declare, that the Jews are to be carried by force out of their
country, and destruas (i) ciuitatem Jerusalem destruendam, and terram eorum,
prophets: that thou may foretell, the destruction of Jerusalem, and of
their country: and disperdas (i) eos disperdendos a principibus Chaldaeoru^,
praedices: that thou may preach unto them their dispersion by the princes of
the Chaldaeans; and dissipes (i) dissipandum esse praedices regnum Iudaeorum
per captiuitatem, that thou may foretell the destruction of the kingdom of
the Jews, through their captivity. And lest the Jews might have despaired,
therefore he does not only foretell their captivity, but likewise their
deliverance thence; adding and aedifices, (i) ciuitatem reae dificandam
nuncies: that thou may assure them, their city shall again be reedified;
and plants (i) Iudaeos adhuc plantandos esse in Iudae and, praedices: that
thou may foretell the Jews, that they shall be again planted in their
own land. Hitherto the Cardinal, for the literal sense of Gods words unto
Jeremy: and then thus of them mystically: That thou may pull up
unprofitable berbes, that is, evil cogitations, by contrition; and destroy
hurtful delights, with pure confession, and dissolve sins ill grown
together, by competent satisfaction: and break asunder the bands of evil
custom, by good conversation: and build upon a sure rock, by cumulation of
merits; and may plant the tree of life in thy self, and in others virtutum
radicatione, by the ingrafting of virtues.

Out of question the Prophet Jeremy, who best understood the meaning of God,
when he spoke unto him, did not otherwise overthrow kings or kingdoms, or
scatter, or destroy, or plant, or build up any kings, people, or nations in his
time, then as this worthy Cardinal has literally expounded the said words:
neither may they be further extended either literally or mystically, as of
later times they have been extended, for such their proceedings with kings and
princes, as in the Oath of Allegiance, are sought to be prevented.

Not long since Cardinal Bellarmine did write a letter unto me, in dislike of
my yielding to take the said Oath, and persuading of others therein to follow
mine example: where unto after my answer was made, such plots were laid by
them, who have their watches over me, as the Cardinals letter it self, and the
copy of my answer unto it were known and had from me; and I was thereupon
brought into a long and very strict Examination: wherein I being drawn from
point to point, and pressed upon my duty both to God, and to his Majesty, to
discharge my conscience, according to my knowledge: I have dealt as becomes a
true Priest, a duetiful subject to his Majesty, a faithful servant of God,
and an obedient child to the Popes Holiness and of the Catholic Church; and
do very humbly pray you (my loving brethren of all sorts) and withal
straightly charge you by the mercies of God, and in the bowels of Jesus Christ,
as being your Archpriest, and thereby having yet authority (for ought I know)
over you, thus to write unto you; that if ever my said Examination do come to
your sight (as I am verily persuaded it will) you do not dislike or impugn
it, but wholly conform your selves, and your conuersations, by your due
obedience to his Majesty, agreeably unto it.

The younger sort of Catholics (I know) such as are subject to passion and
strength of sundry humors, and in whom there is more feruencie, courage, and
forwardness, then true discretion, judgment, and experience, will when they
see it, mutter, and peradventure exclaim against me. But I am better persuaded
of you, who are more judicious, and of the grave and wiser sort; that no
suggestions against me, or wrested constructions of any thing by me delivered
either herein, or in my said Examination, may breed in you any offense: being
men better grounded, and settled in the truth, touching your obedience to his
Majesty, then that hereafter you will ever give ear to any of these, or such
like other intiseable persuasions of men's alluring reasons; as that you are no
longer to obey his Majesty, as dutiful Subjects are commanded by the
Apostles, but until you shall be able without danger either of loss of
goods, or of your lives, by reason of your numbers, or of some direction from
the Pope; to bear arms against him, or to machinate, or put in practice any
attempt, whatsoever, either to the hurt or dishonor of his Majesty's person,
or the empeachment of his kingdom and Royal authority. These conceires
likewise I do assure you from my soul, are in themselves very detestable,
repugnant to the Scriptures, and ought by all true, and sound Catholics to be
for ever abandoned.

Be not dismayed therefore I befeech you, with any letters or Briefes, which
do after a sort insinuate, that the taking of the Oath of Allegiance is either
repugnant to any point of Faith, as yet concluded upon by the Church, or unto
the Popes Supremacy, being bounded as it ought, within the limits and reach of
the keys of the kingdom of heaven. Those keys do no way extend themselves
iure diuino, unto kingdoms terrene, to open or shut, or to toss or turmoile
any of them: they have no wards in them, either so to turn or ouerturne them,
nor to open unto you any lawful entrances into such disobedient and undutiful
courses.

That the Pope is the head of the Catholic Church, therein I am resolute; as
also that Emperors, Kings, and all other Princes, that profess Christianity,
are subject in some cases unto his spiritual censures properly so termed, as
interdiction, and Excommunication: but to eradicate them, or to depose them, by
any authority he can challenge iure diuino in temporalibus, either directly or
indirectly, in ordine ad spiritualia, that is utterly against my judgment: and
yet (I hope) I continue still, as good a Catholic, as any that holds the
contrary, notwithstanding that Cardinal Bellarmine seems to affirm in his
Letter to me, that no man can concur with me in opinion herein, and so yield
to take the Oath of Allegiance (which only excludes the Popes authority in
temporalibus, as well that which is ascribed unto him directly, as indirectly)
but that he must needs perfidiously deny the primacie of the Sea Apostolic.

At which his words, were they not grounded (I think) upon some
misinformation, I should greatly marvel, considering that thereby he does
insinuate, the Popes supremacy (which ought to be maintained without any
hesitation) to depend a great part of it upon a wonderful uncertainty: For no
man knows better then himself, that it has not been hitherto determined by
the Church, or iudicially by his Holiness, tanquam ex Cathedra, whether the
Pope has any authority at all in temporalibus, further then in those things,
that do appertain to S. Peter's patrimony, and other temporalties given to
the Sea of Rome. And besides, if it shall fall out hereafter, that the Pope
shall be found to have any such authority, it must have been given him by
Christ either indirectly, as he the said Cardinal with many others his
partakers do resolutely affirm, or directly, as the opposite part against him
do take upon them, with as great confidence, to maintain, (each of them
peremptorily denying the others assertion:) and because likewise until the
point be ouerruled against one of the said parts (which will not be done in
haste for many respects) it cannot possibly be determined, whether the Pope
has any such authority, as either of them hold, or not: it had been fit in
my judgment for Cardinal Bellarmine, not to have entangled the Popes
supremacy, which is clear and manifest, with these vncertaineties and
perplexities, for to have blamed me either for avoiding them my self, or
admonishing of others to take heed, lest they might be entrapped or snared with
them.

But his Amplitude writ unto me, and censured me as it pleased him: which I
could the more easily have borne, as my duty required, had he not thereby
published to as many as shall see his Letter (the Copy whereof is, as I am
informed, spread far and near) that by taking of the said oath of Allegiance
one of the chief heads of our faith, and foundations of Catholic religion in
discrimen adducitur, is brought into question and endangered: there being
indeed no such head or foundation hitherto agreed upon or concluded. So as
there is no cause (for ought I know, or can judge) why I should not still
persevere in the approbation of the lawfulness of the said oath, and continue
my former admonitions unto you, for the submitting of your selves unto it, when
it shall be exacted of you, lest otherwise you wilfully cast your selves into
those miseries, which are likely to fall upon you, not as so many arguments of
happiness, and that blessedness which is promised to those that suffer for the
truths sake, but of those judgments, which are inflicted upon men, by Kings
and superior governors, for their evil behavior and disobedience.

Deceive not therefore your selves (brethren) such sufferings are not the way
to Martyrdom, nor approved of God: never might treachery or rebellion, or the
bearing of arms by subjects against their Sovereigns, or their secret
designements against them, or the execution of the same to the endangering or
hurt of their royal persons, be graced, or honored with that most glorious
title, by whomsoever they were either authorized, undertaken or practiced. Take
heed (I do most humbly beseech you) of this kind of leaven: be your lump of
dough otherwise never so pure, sweet, and sincere, this mixture will make it
sour, and corrupt it. Stand fast in the Catholic faith, and in the true
profession thereof, as hitherto you have done.

Be not led away with various and strange doctrines of deposing of Kings, of
absoluing their subjects from their Allegiance, of authorizing them to rebel,
to bear arms against them, to plot and lay snares secretly how to entrap
them, or to offer hurt or violence to their persons. These things (I thank
God) my heart does abhor, and my spirit within me does loath and detest
them: The voice that bade Peter, Kill and eat, never meant that he should
deal so with Princes, cast them out of their seats, and bestow their
kingdoms upon others, or procure them to be killed, that Christians and
Catholic religion might flourish and be comforted. Meats and drinks may
establish our strength; but such proceedings with kings ought to be no food
for our souls. James and John, because they would have had the Samaritanes to
have been destroyed with fire from heaven, for that they would not receive
their master Christ, were sharply rebuked and told by him, that they knew not
of what spirit they were. S. Peter drew his sword, and smote off Malchus ear,
in as just a cause to the eyes of humane wisdom, as was possible; but Christ
disliked that his fact, and gave it for a general rule or caveat (in my
judgment) to all Catholic priests and people, saying: that all that strike
with the sword, shall perish with the sword. These and such like things (my
dear brethren) are written out of question to our correption and Catholic
information.

Beware therefore of them in whose mouths and actions sanguis nihil est, blood
is nothing: Ecclus. 8. 19.
tread not in the steps of ruin, stumble not against rocks, commit not your
selves to such laborious ways. If your own children (who are fathers) or your
own fathers (who are children) should persuade you to any of these courses,
do not follow their counsel, for it is not of God: let Buchananus and his
fellows, and whosoever else do follow them, run alone in these rebellious
and wicked races. But inquire you, according to the Prophets direction, and
your own Catholic profession, of the old paths, quae sit via bone, which
is the good way, and walk in it. Certainly, be you well assured, these ways
whereof I will put you in mind, were the old ways, I beseech you embrace
them; that it may not be said of you, that is said of others in another case:
Laudatis semper antiquitatem, Tertul. Apologet. cap. 6.
and noue de die viuitis: you always commend antiquity (and therein you do
well) but many of you are too much subject to novelties: which I greatly
mislike. Does your coin carry the image of K. James? then render to K. James
the things that are K. James his, and unto God the things that are Gods. Let
every soul be subject to higher powers, for there is no power, but of God.
Therefore he that resists the power, resists the ordinance of God. And
they that resist, purchase to themselves damnation. Therefore be subject of
necessity, not only for wrath, but also for conscience sake. Render to all
men their due; tribute, to whom tribute, to whom custom, custom, to whom
fear, fear, to whom honor, honor.

I desire first of all things (says the Apostle) that obsecrations, prayers,
postulations, and thanksgiving be made for all men; for kings, that we may
lead a quiet and peaceable life in all piety and chastity: for this is good
and acceptable before our Savior God. Be subject to every humane creature for
God, whether it be to king, as excelling: or to rulers as sent by him, to the
revenge of male factours, but to the praise of the good: for so is the will of
God, that doing well, you may make the ignorance of unwise men, to be dumb, as
free and not as having the freedom, for a cloak of malice, but as the
servants of God. Honor all men. Love fraternity. Fear God. Honor the King.

In these Catholic and Apostolical ways (my loving brethren) the best and
most ancient of all our forefathers did carefully walk and delight: professing
that they were the same to the Emperors, that they were to their Tertul.
Apologet. cap. 36.
neighbors: and that they were forbidden equally to wish evil, to do evil,
to speak evil, or to think evil of any man: that whatsoever was not lawful
for them to do against the Emperor, the same they might not do against any:
that what they might do against no man, they might peradventure the less do
against the Emperor, qui per Deum tantus est, who is by Gods ordinance so
great a person. That a Christian Tertul. ad Scapulam cap. 2.
was no man's enemy, much less the Emperors, whom of necessity he must love,
reverence, and honor, and wish long health unto, as knowing him to be
appointed of God: That they so worshipped the Emperor, as they lawfully might
and was expedient for him, as a man the second from God, and less then God
only: That they did invoke the eternal God for the health of their Tertul:
Apolog: cap. 30.
Emperors, as knowing who gave them their Empire: and that they (the said
Emperors) are only under the power of God, a quo sunt secundi, post quem,
primi, from whom (in temporal affairs) they are the second, and after whom,
the first: That they did admire in their Emperors the judgment of God, who
placed Ibidem cap. 22.
them over nations: that they knew that to be in them, which God would, and
that therefore they desired that to be preserved which was according to his
ordinance: That they prayed for their Emperors, for their Ministers and
powers, for the estate of the world, and for the quiet of all things.

Now (dear Catholics) forasmuch as that which the Emperors were to the
ancient Christians, the same is King JAMES unto us; under whom our states
being far more tolerable, then theirs were under many of them; let us not be
otherwise affected toward his Majesty, then they were to their said
Emperors. The will of God is one and the same for ever: that which was nor
lawful then, is still unlawful: what was the duty of Christians at that
time, does now continue in as full strength to bind us, as it did them. It is
therefore our bounden duties to yield that to our dread Sovereign Lord King
James within his kingdoms, which they did to their Emperors within the
compass of their Empire, and daily to pray for his Majesty, as they prayed
for their Emperors, that Almighty Tertul. Apol. cap 30.
God would grant unto him viram prolixam, a long life, (which we must not
therefore seek to shorten) imperium secuium, a secure reign, (which we may
not therefore in any sort disturb) domum tutam, safety in his Court, (which
we may nor therefore by any practices empeach) exercitus fortes, valiant
soldiers, (whose allegiance therefore we may not endeavor to auert) senatum
fidelem, a faithful Council, (which we may not therefore labor to corrupt)
populum probum, dutiful subjects, (whom we may not therefore persuade to
bear arms against him) orbem quietum, a quiet kingdom, (which we may not
therefore seek to molest, or extort from him) and all those blessings, and
comforts, that his heart can desire, which we may not therefore seek to hinder
or impair. If these then be the ancient paths of our forefathers, let us
pursue them: if this be the good way, cease not to walk in it. Think
diligently upon him, Heb. 12. 3.
which sustained of sinners such contradiction against himself, that you be
not wearied fainting in your minds. All discipline for the present certes
seems not to be of joy, but of sorrow: Ibidem. 11.
but afterward it will render to you (dear Catholics) that are exercised by
it, most peaceable fruit of justice, and the God of all comfort will in his due
time fill your souls with all true consolation, either in this world, or at
the least in the world to come.

And agreeably to this sound counsel and wholesome doctrine is that of S.
Augustine, where answering such a like question, as peradventure some more
impatient amongst you then the rest, might here make, (in that I may not with a
safe conscience put you in hope of any relief from your distresses, by any
attempts to be made against his Majesty, or the State; but that whatsoever
does happen unto you, you must continue in fear, true obedience and fidelity
unto his highness, and to your natural country; arming your selves only with
patience and prayer:) Nunquid sic August. enarrat. in Psalm. 24.
erit semper? shall we always be in this case? he the said holy Father says;
Non sic erit; it shall not be so for ever, veniet tempus, quando vnus
agnoscatur Deus, the time shall come, when one God shall be acknowledged. But
it may be asked, when? and that he answers likewise: Quando vnus Christus in
claritate sua apparens etc. when our only Savior Christ, appearing in his
brightness, shall congregate before him all nations, and divide them, as a
Pastor divides his goats from his sheep, and place his sheep upon his right
hand, and his goats upon his left: And in the mean while strengthen your
hearts with this assured hope, that continuing in the faith of our Lord Jesus
Christ, and in the holy obedience of his Church, the King then shall say to you
that shall be at his right hand, Come you blessed of my Father, possess you
the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.

And in the mean while let us posiesse our souls in patience, seeking through
grace, by our service to please God with fear and reverence: go we altogether
to our Savior without the camp carrying his reproach, and our Lord Jesus Christ
himself, and God and our Father which has loved us, and has given eternal
consolation, and good hope in grace, exhort your hearts, and confirm you in
every good work and word.
