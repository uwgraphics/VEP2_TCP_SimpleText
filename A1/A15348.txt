Alas poor Scholar, whither will thou go: OR Strange altrations which at
this time be; There Is many did think they never should see.
To the tune of, Halloo my Fancy, etc.


IN a melancholy studdy
None but my self,
Me thought my muse grew muddy,
After seven years reading
And costly breeding,
I felt, but could find no pelf:
Into learned rags
I Have rent my Plush and Satin,
And now am fit to beg
in Hebrew, Greek and Lattin,
Iu^^^^d of Aristotle,
would I had got a Patten:
Alas poor Scholar whither will thou go?
Cambridge now I must leave thee
And follow Fate,
College hopes do deceive me,
I often expected
To have been elected,
But desert is reprobate:
Masters of Colleges
have no common graces,
And they that have Fellowships
have but common places,
And those that Scholars are,
they must have hansome faces:
Alas poor Scholar whither will thou go?


I have bowed, I have bended,
And all in hope,
Due day to be befrended,
I have Preached, I have Printed
What ere I hinted,
To please our English Pope;
I worshipped toward the East,
but the Sun does now forsake me,
I find that I am falling,
the Northern winds do shake me,
Would I had been upright,
for bowing now will break me:
Alas poor Scholar, whither will thou go?
At great preferment I aimed
Witness my silk,
But now my hopes are maimed,
I looked lately,
To live most stately,
And have a Dairy of Bell-ropes milk:
But now alas,
my self I must not flatter,
Bygamy of Steeples
is a laughing matter,
Each man must have but one,
and Curates will grow fatter.
Alas poor Scholar, whither will thou go?
The second part,
to the same Tune.


INto some Country Uillage
Now I must go,
Where neither Tith nor Tillage*
The greedy Patron
And parched Matron,
Swear to the Church they owe:
Yet if I can preach and pray too on a sudden,
And confute the Pope
at adventure without studdying,
Then ten pounds a year
besides a sunday pudding.
Alas poor Scholar whither will thou go?
All the Arts I have Skill in,
Divine and Humane,
Yet all is not worth a shilling,
When the women hear me,
They do but ieare me,
And say I am profane:
Once I remember,
I Preached with a Weaver,
I quoated Austine,
He quoated Dodd and Cliver,
I nothing got,
he got a Cloak and Bever.
Alas poor Scholar whither will thou go?
Ships, Ships, Ships I discover,
Crossing the Maine,
Shall I in and go over
Turn Jew or Atheist,
Turk or Papist,
To Geneva or Amsterdam:
Bishoppricks are void
in Scotland, shall I thither,
Or follow Windebanke
and Finch to see if either
Do want a Priest to shrive them,
O no it is blustering weather.
Alas poor Scholar whither will thou go?
Ho, ho, ho, I have hit it,
Peace goodman fool,
Thou have a frame will fit it,
Draw thy Indenture,
Be bound at adventure,
An Apprentice to a Free-schoole;
There thou may command
By William Lillies Charter,
There thou may whipp, stripp
and hang and draw and quarter,
And commit to the red Rod,
both Will. and Tom. and Arthur.
I, I, it is thither, thither will I go.
FINIS.
