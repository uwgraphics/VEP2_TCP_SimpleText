The seven sorrows that women have when their husbands be dead. Compyled by
Robert Copland.



The excuse of the Author.
TO all archewyues I do pray instantly
And to all wydowes of the second degree
Me to excuse, that ignorantly
your words to wryth I have taken on me
For suerly it is of no malignitite
But only to comfort young wives that have
young loving husbands in their felicite
How after their death they may them have.
Prologue of Robert Copland.
Copland. WHy should I muse such tryfles for to write
Or wanton toys, but for the appetyte
Of wandryng brains, that seek for things new
And do not reche if they be falls or true.

Quidam. With what news? or here ye any tidinges
Of the pope, of the Emperor, or of kings
Of martyn Luther, or of the great Turk
Of this and that, and how the world does work.

Copland. So that the tongue must ever wagge and clatter
And waste their wyndes, to meddle of each matter
Thus ben we prynters called on so fast
That maruayle it is, how that our wits can last.

Quidam. With have ye the taking of the French king
Or what conceptes have ye of laughyng
Have ye the balade called maugh murre
Or b^ny wenche, or else go from my durre
Col to me, or hey down dery dery
Or a my heart, or I pray you be merry.

Copland. Thus if our heads forged were of brass
yet should we wexe as dulle as any ass
And alof baggage naught worth in substance
But books of virtue have none vtteraunce
As thus, sir I have a very proper book
Of moral wisdom please ye their on to look
Of else a book of comen consolation.

Quidam. Tusshe a straw man, what should I do therewith
Have thou a book of the wydowe Edith
That has begyled so many with her words
Or else such a geest that is full of bourdes
Let me se, I will yet waste a penny
Upon such things and if thou have any.

Copland. How say ye by these, will ye bestow a grote

Quidam. ye sir somuche? nay, that I shorowe my cote
A penny I trow is enough on books
It is not so soon gotten, as this world lokes
By saint Mary I cannot tell the brother
Money ever goes for one thing or for other
God help my fryende, this world is hard and kene
They that have it will not let it be seen
But let that pass unto another time
Have ye not seen a pretty geest in time
Of the seven sorrows that these women have
when that their husbands been brought to grave.

Copland. No I says, I did never here there of.

Quidam. By God and it is a very propre scoff
If it were prynted, it will be well soulde
I have heard it or now, full madly told.

Copland. It may well be, but I wene I should gyt
Displeasure of women if that I prynt it
And that were I loath, for I have always
Defended them, and will to my last day.

Quidam. Ah ha, than I seye be well at ease
When ye are afraid women to displease.

Copland. What need me get anger, if I may have thank
In faith I can not se, but as mad a pranke
as soon will a man do as a woman
why should they be rayled and gested on than
And to say soth it is but a fond apetyte
To geste on women, or against them to write.

Quidam. That is truth, if they be good and honest
But this is but a merry bourdyng Ieest
without reproufe, dishonesty or shame
That in no wise can appayre their good name.

Copland. That is good, but have ye any copy
That a man might enprynt it thereby
And when I se it, than I will you tell.
If that the matter be ordered ill or well.

Quidam. I have no book, but yet I can you show
The matter by heart, and that by words few
Take your pen, and write as I do say
But yet of one thing, hertely I you pray
Amend the englysh somewhat if ye can.
And spel it true, for I shall tell the man
By my soul ye prynters make such english
So ill spelled, so ill poynted, and so peuyshe
That scantly one cane read lines tow
But to find sentence, he has ynought to do
For in good faith, if I should say truth
In your craft to suffer, it is great ruthe
Such pochers to meddle, and can not skyl
Of that they do, but does al mar and spyl
I ensure you, your wardeins ben thereof to blame
It hyndreth your gain and hurts your name
How be it, it is al one to me
Whether ye thryue, or else nenuer thee.

Copland Well brother. I can it not a mende
I will no man there of dyscommende
I care no greatly, so that I now and than
May get a penny as well as I can
How be it, in our craft I know that there be
Connyng good work men, and that is to se
In latin and englysh, which they have wrought
Whose names appears, where they be sought
But to our purpose, now turn we again
And let me begin to write a line or twain.

Quidam. With al my heart, but first I pray you say
Unto all women that I them hertely pray
To have me excused of this homely deed
And what I say, of themself take no head.

The first sorrow.
The first sorrow that these women have
Is or their husbands be laid in grave
And that is duble in this manner wise
This man full sick in deadly pains lyse
Many a day, nygh to the hour of death
His eyene dymineth, and very short is his breath
The flew me ratleth in his breast and throat
His powlces beten, his tongue is roughe and hot
Phisicions forsake him every chone
When that they se his money almost gone
Than this pore woman that so hreatly toyled
Wrappyge, and warminge with many a hand defoyled
Does him behold, and sees he will dye
The holy candell she lyghteth him by
And so he lies consumyng to his end
This wife then that busely does him tend
Seeing him lie to long in that case
With drops and marks in every place
Consyderyng her good, that is greatly spente
And the candell well nygh wasten and brent
She looks on the candell with a doleful ghost
Alas seyth she, thou art gone almost
How shall I for go thy company
When thou art gone, I ensure perfytely
To my lives need I will have no mo
For thy sake, I have the loved so
Alas good woman full w^ art thou
But what wylt thou do with him now
Bury him, alas thou art there to full loath
But though that she be never so wroth
It must be done, and so this good woman
Ordreth all things so well as she can
For his buryenge, and other service
So comes the pres^es and other likewise
As the mourners, and executours
Torche berers, kynsfolke and neighbors
Than is the corpse laid on the bear
Or in a coffyn as the guyse is here
Than this pore widow clothed all in black
Of sorrow be sure she does nothing lack
From her chamber she comes a down
Than for great fere to fall in aswowne
Upon her she bears some confeccion
As powder of peper, or a red onyon
And when she comes three ye corpse does lie
Her hands she wryngeth pyteously
Out out alas, what shall I do forth on
Would god I were by thy grave anon
This sorrow is long, what shall me now betyde
I beseech Jesus thy soul in heaven may bide.
The second sorrow.
THe second sorrow that these wives do make
Is when.iiii. men the corpse on the^ do take
Toward the church, and the prestes do sing
This woeful wydow al way following
With bedes in hand, in mourning hood
God knows if syghes do her any good
Now thinks she, here have I much to do
And happily this wydowe has a short sho
That streyneth her toes, and does hurt her foot
Than thinks she, I be shrew the heart rote
Of the horeson sowter, it greueth me so
And to the chrche we have far to go
Or else she is laced in her new black gown
That for straytnes she is like to swone
Or else it may fortune so that she
Has in her some lose infyrmyte
Or else the wind does waste the wax to sore
And she knows well that she must pay therefore
But when they nyghe unto the church be
who soroweth now: for so the none but she
I can suppose, being so nere the place
where he must rest, this is a heavy case
Who sygheth now, alas this pore woman
For I am sure that she would be as than
As far home ward, but she does take in worth
This heavy chance, and woefully goes forth
And to herself al pryuely does say
what remedy all is well on the way
well a way, than said the executour
That ledeth her, why make ye this dolor
I you ensure that ye do God displease
So for to fare, but it were more ease
For the soul, to say some good oreyson
Nothing can help your lamentacyon
Alas sir she says, ye say of certaynete
But yet my heart can not so serve me
And therewithal she does weep so fast
That her heart tikleth as it would brast
O kind womane I blame the not at all
Thou would him have in christen buryall
The third sorrow.
FOrth now than goes this woeful creature
To the third sorrow. I may you well ensure
In to the church and sytteth in a pewe
Full often than changes all her hew
For very fayntnes, or is to hard enbraced
Would God says she that I were unlaced
Or else may chance with child that she go
Of.x. wekes time, or happily of mo
Or else some qualme may in her stomach rise
As women have in many diverse wise
But for all that this wydowe sytteth still
Puttyng her self all in gods will
Hearing devoutly the deuyne song
A Jesus mercy this service is long
And she is very sick and would be thence
In faith I had lever that.xl. pence
She were away, so I might her excuse
But not so, she will her self sadly use
Men shall not say yt she would feign be ride
Her sorrows shall be womanly hyde
And in her prayers, her self occupy
Ne were it so that the beggars cry
On her so fast and let her for to pray
with some good man have these folk away
I never saw such folk, and so lewd
withstand at the door knaves al be shrewde
ye troble this woman, and it is no need
Come to morrow and ye may happily speed
Thus is this woman troublously arayde
Till that the last dyryge is said
And with the corpse walks to the pytte
But than in deed hard is to forgette
Alas says she, all this business
Now were me lever for to die than life
Now will I all my goods away give
The mantyll and ryng, now will I take
A las alas, now must I leave my make
Fare well my Joy, thou act gone for ever
Ah my pore heart in sonder will sheuer
Ah falls death, why haste thou him so slain
And leueth me here in this most woeful pain
Thus nethelesse, this man is laid allow
And than ye priest earth upon him does throw
She seeing that looks full heuely
Upon the clerk, and woefully does cry
A good sweet man, please it the trinite
That I were laid vpryght under thee
When this is done though it be to her pain
As woe full as she went, she must go home again
The fourth sorrow.
Now woeful women Jesus be thy speed
Hard is to know what life thou will led
All this night, when I to me mind call
With no more rest than a stone in a wall
Now will thou consider thy great cost
And how thou have a good husband lofte
I mean thy bedfelowe, for he is gone
Thus is a new pain for to lie a lone
Now muse thou must, where thou wast wo^t to plai
yet for all this as soon as any day
Thou must a rys and ouerse thy house
With come here, go there, as busy as a mous
Bring this fetch that, care this thens
walk hither, run thither, be not long thens
Go for him, fetch her and desire them
To go with me to the mass of Requiem
Lo thus these women can not be out of care
But what than yet will they nothing spare
To be quyte of this charges, and what than?
God have mercy on his soul good man
I am well a paid that I have brought to pass
Thus far forth, now let us go to mass
Beshorow me, if I would take such pain
On condition to have him again
When for this, for that, one thing and other
Fie on it Fie, I swear by godds mother
ye will not believe what is the exspens
For this.xl. shyllynges and for that.xl. penens
Here a noble, and there well nyghe a pound
There goes a grote, and there a shyllyng round
The prestes and clerks, for the knyll and pyt
And other things, that I am weary of it
Here is great sorrow but what remedy
Go we to church I pray you heartily
I think this sorrow will ever last
Maid lay meat to fire for our break fast
Against we come home, well well mayitresse
ye shall se me do al my business
To mass now is the widow on her way
Devoutly for her husband to pray
There does she sit, god wat how sore mourning
Till that the time come of the offering
Than for her husband can not fro her mind
The most fairest penny that she can find
She takes and in to the quere
Sayng softly that all the prestes may here
Lokyng on the penny with woeful eye
Full loath am I to depart fro the
I can not blame her if she were loathe to part
With that she loves well with all her heart
Thus with her love, sorrow, and kyndnesse
The wydowe bydeth the residewe of the mass.
The fyfth sorrow.
THe fyfth sorrow is very dolorous
As he is buried and the wife in house
Alone is left, and al her neighbors gone
Still museth she than making great moan
Sayng, woe is me this time for to se
Now must I both husband, and wife be
yet what of that I may take such sorrow
Parauenture to dye or to morrow
Nay let it be, for I will take no thought
Sorrow will right soon bring me to naught
Now sith he be gone, well what remedy
Other be wyddwes as well as I
Than sytteth she sadly down on the benche
What Ione I say, and called her wenche
Come hither Ione to me is your house dressed:
I pray god give all christen souls good rest
And with her knyfe between her fyngers two
She dalieth, waggyng it to and fro
With dydle dydle dydle, tyrle tyrle tyrle
The brain rennyth and there of no terle
As in such a case, and than will require
O sorrow great, more hot than the fire
Now is this woman in great fantasy
And no maruayle, yet has she no couse whi
For happily he was unto her unkind
But for all that as clean out of her mind
Of womanhed, and eke of here kyndnes
She does forget his waywerde folyshnes
And dote perform the tenor of his will
And is in purpose his mind to fulfill
Remembrynge greatly how the pore soul is
In great peril, if he have left ought amysse
And than a gain her own self for to chere
Her maid she calls as I did say ere
Com hither I one and god on my arande
God and desire my gossyp Coplande
My gosseyp Miles, and my gssip Susan
My gossip Stodarde, and my neybour An
The good wife Rychardson, and the good wife Gayes
And to Peter's vyfe, and pray them straight ways
To do so much as to come speak with me
And when thou have done look that thou hie the
And take a pot and go to saint Iohans head
For a quart of Muscadel and new bread
^ couple of bounes or maunchettes new bake
For I promise thee, my heart does ache
Anon maystresse says she as a good damsel
And douth her message right fair and well
And when the gossyppes assembled be
What chere good gossyp, than says she and she
Be ye of good chere, and thank god of all
This world ye se, does turn like as a ball
Now up, and now down, now to and now fro
Now mirth than Joy, now care and than woe
A good man, god have mercy on thy soul
By my troth when I did her the bell tole
My heart erned and I shall tell you why
Ah good man thou speak full meryly
This day seven night and now thou art full low
Now by my faith in all this street I trow
Is not his fellow in every degree
By my soul if ye will believe me
I trow he will never out of my mind
Surly gossyp he was ever kind
A Jesus how he would you prays
His mind was so occupied always
On this world, in his mirth and his game
I hard him never no man defame
Ah gossyp, gossyp says this wydow than
Though I say it he was an honest man
He left me so to drive the wat a way
That I am bound for him daily to pray
For by this syluere and wine in this cup
And therewith she made a soppe
Saying of gossyppes my heart is so sore
That I care not which end does go a fore
And therewyth puts it in to her mouth
And swear by him that dyed in the southe
There was never sorrow, woe nor smerte
That ever did go more nerer my heart
Alack good woman, take it not so heuyly
Says her gossyppes, lest that ye dye
Now he is gone, there is no better reed
Thus this wydowe they comfort every day
The best they can, to drive her care a way
The syxte sorrow.
Now has this wydow, thanked be Jesus
Performed the buriyng, as to her is due
Sadly and wisely me need not to tell
She has behaved her there in so well
That I dare swear if it chance her again
She can it do with less cost and pain
But for all that she is to him so kind
Thao she will not forget his months mind
Nor his annuuersary at the years end
She does so well that each does here commend
She renneth not hourly fro house to house
But keeps home as duly as a mous
Erly she ryseth and lies down late
And labors sore to keep her estate
Walkyng sadly in town and street
Without acquayntaunce of them that she mete
And sometime hereth how folk does der prays
Unus Se ye yonder wydowe that goes that ways
I ensuer you she is a sad woman
By my troth if I were a sengleman
If I had forty pound and forty there by
I could find in my heart to make her lady.

Alyus. ye but I pray you is she of any substance
That would make a man any fortheraunce.

Unus ye by sant Mary I hold her well at ease
I tell you if that ye could her please
Or have her good will than were it cock
For better it were to have her in her smock
Than some other that has more good
It is a great treasure to have womanhood.

Alius. That is truth, but I shall tell you one thing
Many that been so smothe in their going
Been also shrewed as is the deuell of hell
And never cease, but ever fight and yell
Ever unquiet, and always chyde and brall
And that freteth a man both heart and gall
And many times instead of flesh or fyshe
A deed man's head is served in a dyshe
And he there with is made so very mate
That house and profit he does in manner hate
For I have herd a hundred times and mo
That wives and smoke cause men there house to for go

Unus He that is afraid to tread on the grass
Through meadows I counsel him not to pass
He must adventure that shuche a thing will have
Often he for goes, that fereth for to crave
Thus been these wowers ever in great doubt
That sumtyme do bring there matter so a bout
That they went to have God by the cote
And have the dyuel fast a bout the throat
As I have herd say I wot not what it means
The matter goes not as some folk weneth
But what of that, we must forth on proceed
To our wydowe, Jesus be our speed
She lives so well and so honestly
That all her knowledge woweth her company
Fro the tavern, daunces, and common players
And wanton may games, she kepeht her always
Pleasant pylgrymages, wylsdon and Crome
She seeks not, but tarieth still at home
So chances it, that on a festfulday
When that folk wandered ^o pastyme and play
This woman at home has a delight to be
Saufe to the door no farther walks she
And on thresholde fortuneth to sit
Than some neighbor happens to se it
And to her comes to pastyme and to talk
For she no lust has, a broad as than to walk
with good even fair wydowe, how do ye to day
well I thank you as a lone woman may
That has great charges, and but small counsel
well neighbor says he, al thing shall be well
Thanked be God ye be out of det
God have his soul that has you so well set
ye need not to sequester under the bishop
And that is seen by our warehous and shop
And I am sure there is much owyng you
Mary says she I can not show you how
For he occupied much more without
Than within, and that causes me dout
How to get inward that other men have
And I am ashamed on them for to crave
For all my sorrow, pain, and thought
Is for to gather, that to him was aught
For he was fre, and lent it here and there
To them that would browe every where
How be it, yet for his own soul sake
Here and there somewhat I will ay take
As they may pay, for I will none trouble
For I ensure you, though that it were double
I set not by it, but I will have all right
As nyghe as I can of every wight
For what by tail, by writing and by score
I am right sure there is ought me more
Than I will say, and that they would maruayle
One can not live with scoryng on the tail
Noywys neybour, and that you know full well
As well as I, me need not there offo^ to tell
For it is a new thing for to take in hand
To order all things right as it should stand
For one that is but little wount there to
No remedy but it must needs be do
But how be it I shall tell you what
If I could well rule and guide all that
Without the door as I cane that with in
I would not care therefore scantly a pyn
But or it be long, neighbor I trust
It shall be ordered par^ly as I lust
ye, ye, neighbor says he I dare trust your wit
That well enough ye will puruey for it
And what I can do ye shall find me ready
When that ye need, both late and erly
And fare you well I take my leave as now
Neighbor she says, I pray god thank you.

The.vii. sorrow.
UOis last sorrow, if any sorrow be
Is so the wydow of her chairte
Now must perform her husbands intent
Touching his will, his mind and tesstament
And so she does, as nygh as she can
So that no where there is any man
That can demand of right and duty
But she them pleases well and honestly
So that her name is so well spredde
That many delyteth her for to wedde
Wouers com with many a proud offer
Some with love, and other some with proffre
Some come gayly, and all in pleasure
Some come poorly with countenance demure
Some launcheth money largely fro their powches
Some shows tynges, Ieweles, and rich owches
Some sends her a tokne or a Capon
Some sends her wine, other sends venyson
And all for to kendle, and set her heart on fire
To cause her to bow, and follow there desire
But this wydow as steadfast as a wall
As she well can, thanketh them greatly all
Excusing her as she can do full well
For certain causes more that I can tell
How be it perchance that she would feign
But she casts in her mind again
if I should wedde and hold me unto one
That might fortune all this chere were gone
Me think I led a metely mety life
Which I should not if that I whre a wife
To bed I go and rise when I will
All that I do is reason and skyll
I command other but noue commands me
And eke I stand at mine own liberte
How be it I do note in consynence
Whether to wedde or live in continence
For I am young, and may the world increase
And unto me it is full hard to cease
The wanton delight, that young women have
And ferther more my good name for to save
For the resort that here do com daily
I take such thought, and so much care yt I
Wot not well in what estate to abide
For if a young man should me betide
That were to sharp, or has no worldli shifte
Than might I say a dew fare well my thryfte
And if I should him in any wise contray
Than might perchance that we two should vart
In the deuyls name, peke thee out at the door
And so me beat, saying old wyddred hoar
Or lay to pledge such as I have, or sell
yet had I lever never with none to mell
if he be old and a waywarde wight
He is ill to please, either day or night
Ever hummyng at this thing and that
And always chydyng, and wotes not for what
And if he fall ones in ialowsy
The devil than troubles his fantasy
Thus I ne wot by god and by my soul
How that I may now me self control
He that I had, me thought was very ill
But if god pleased I would I had him still
So than this wydow he self to comfort
Unto a friend of hers does resort
With her neighbors, and going be the way
They chance to walk over an old raw say
Which is to broke, and the pauement ^ore
Than takes she vpher clothes a fore
For fylyng, rememberyng her husbands intent
Thai ever amended that broken pauement
Saying our lord Jesus grant him his grace
That was wont to lay stones in this place
But if that I may live an other year
They shall be laid as well as ever they were
Ah true wydowe, so true, loving and kind
Thy husbands deeds be not fro thy mind
Now all true wydowes as ye do entende
In all our sorrows Christ you comfort send.
Finis. deo laus et honor.
Lenuoy of.R. Copland
^O little quayre, god give the well to sail
To that good sheppe, ycleped Bertelet
For through it thou may the more prevail
Against the rocks, that blyndly ben yset
Up on the land thy substance for to fret
And from all nacyous, if that it be thy lot
Lest thou be hurt, meddle not with a Scot.
And to thy readers, as custom is to say
Do thy deuoyr, but to wydowes chefely
Desyringe them to take it as in play
For that to do, was mine intent truly
Desyryng them to accept my fantasy
And to amend thine english where is need
For to pastime mine intent was in deed.
