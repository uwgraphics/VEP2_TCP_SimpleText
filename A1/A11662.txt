ACT ANENT THE out coming of Horses, as well conform to their rents as
Volunteers.
AT EDINBVRGH, the last day of June 1640. years: These of the Committee
appointed by the Estates of Parliament, taking to consideration how the
instructions for putting out of Horses may be best effectuate, conform to the
General order: Has appointed and ordained, that every man, as well to Burgh
as Landwart, shall send out a sufficient and able Horse and man armed, with
Jack, and Lance, or with Pistols, Carobine; and that according to two thousand
marks of rent, conform to the valuations, which shall be the rule of the
Mustars. And siklike, It is appointed, That every Heritour and Tennent shall
put out their best and most fitting Horse for that use: Neither shall any man
whatsoever, be suffered to keep any good and able fit Horses for the Troup at
home, but must either send him out as one of their proportion for their rent;
Or otherwise come presently out upon them themselves, or some other friend, as
Volunteers, or otherwise sell them at a reasonable rate for the use of the
Country. And because Barrons, and Gentlemen of good sort, are the greatest
and most powerful part of the Kingdom, by whose valor the Kingdom has ever
been defended: We do most earnestly require and expect, that every Barron
and Gentleman of good sort, shall come to the Army in their own persons, or
at least send their ablest son, brother, or friend. And that all Noblemen,
Gentlemen, and others, may be the better encouraged to come out as Volunteers
in so good a Cause, for maintenance of Religion, and preservation of the
Liberties of this ancient and never conquered Kingdom, which we are all
sworn to maintain. It is earnestly desired, That all brave Caveliers will
take the business to heart, and consider that now or never is the time to
gain Honor, and Eternal reputation, and to save or loss their Country.
Like as, It is hereby declared, That who shall so come out as Volunteers
(havng put out their proportions in good and able Horses as said is) Shall have
liberty to serve upon their own best Horses themselves as Volunteers, and
shall have corn to their Horses out of the common Magazine, and good quarters
for themselves; And shall not be put to toilesome watching, or any other
troublesome duty: So that it is hereby declared, that no good Horses shall
be suffered to stay at home upon any kind of pretext whatsoever; With
certification that these who shall fail in any of the premises, shall not
only b^e censured, as the Committee of Estates shall appoint, but will also be
repute and holden as Loytterers, or averse from the good Cause.
