AN EXPERIMENTAL DISCOVERY OF SPANISH PRACTICES

OR THE COUNCIL OF A well-wishing Soldier, for the good of his Prince and
State.

WHEREIN IS MANIFESTED FROM KNOWN experience, both the Cruelty, and Policy of
the Spaniard, to effect his own ends.

CHIEFLY Swelling with multiplicity of glorious titles, as one of the greatest
Monarchs of the earth, that being admired of all, his greatness might amaze
all, and so by degrees seeking covertly to tyrannize over all, When as in deed
and truth, the greatest part of his pretended Greatness is but a windy crack
of an ambitious mind.

The Publisher to the Reader.
GEntle Reader, although in respect of the Authors absence, the copy now
presented be not so complete throughout as it should; yet because (as we say in
the proverb) Delays are dangerous, specially in matters of moment, and hoping
it is not materially defective in any thing, from the perfectest Copy or
Authors mind, I have presumed to publish it as it is, wishing no less good
success, then the Author himself intended; and so desiring my upright meaning
may be accepted in good part by the Courteous Reader, I bid thee Farewell.

A DISCOVRSE TENDERED TO HIS MAJESTY King of Great Britain etc. touching some
Spanish practices to serve their own ends.
THE motive of this Discourse, most renounned Sovereign, which at this time I
intend to handle, for that it has relation to two ends to periods, to wit,
peace and war, the one much to be preferred before the other, as well by
divine, as human Arguments; yet for that the time agreeing with the necessity,
we are in regard of the fear of the Spanish greatness hereafter, which
undoubtedly he will attain unto by the innumerable masses of his Indian
treasures which are the nerves and sinnewes of all martial intendments, by
which fair opportunityes offered unto the greatness of his desire, for the
enlargment of his state, glory and renown, and that there may be no object
that may impidiment the let thereof, but only a determination in himself not
to offend his neighbors, I shall hardly beleeu that he will so much differ
from his Progenitors, I mean Eerdinand, Charles and Phillip, who rased not the
fame of the Spanish Monarchy, by just, noble and laudible wars, but by
cruel, bloody and treacherous invasions, especially against Princes of their
own blood; who under pretense of relieuing or giving them aid against the
oppression of others, have made these passages of immovable assurance, for the
obtaining of the lands, Crowns and lives of their nearest Allies, which gives
me no cause of hope of his good dealing toward your Highness, and the State,
who are neither allied unto him by blood, as these former Princes were, nor
tied unto him by the offices of Confederacy, whereby for former good turns
received, he might let you live in peace: but contrarily, we being only the
stop of the Spanish fury of this part of the world; and a Nation who have not
only given him infinite disgraces, as well by open battle, as sundry
invasions and incursions, made upon his frontier Towns and Territories, to the
irrecouerable dishonor of the Spanish people, and unmasking his former forces
to all men; which indeed are but a mere show, and frighting them only;
knowing their Greatness depends with filling the world with an imagination of
their Mightiness, For the Spaniard may well be compared to a drum, or empty
vessel, that being beaten upon, makes a great and terrible noise; but come
nearer them, break them and look into them, and there is nothing within can
hurt you. Or rather like the Ass, that wrapped himself in the Lions skin, and
marched a far off, to strike terror into the hearts of the beasts; but when
the Fox drew near, he not only perceived his long ears, but likewise
discovered him and made him a jest to all the beasts of the Forest. So that I
infer (most gracious Sovereign) that unless he now prevail with you, and
by that means gain a peace to make himself more strong for a fitter time to
hunt you and your neighbors; his forces at this time, in respect of you and
your Confederates, are so weak and resistable, as it may well appear unto
your Highness, that his Monarchy is rather maintained by Opinion then Might;
as it has ever stood since the loss of the low Countries (if it had been
with judgment exquisitely looked into) rather by giving out greater rumors of
power, and by secrecy, then by the greatness of their own forces. So as to
make this shadow a Substance, whereby not only his Indies should be sure, but
all the world tremble at his greatness. What oath is it that he whhld keep?
What condition that he would not break? Or, what opporunitie that he would let
slip for the accomplishment thereof, if thereby he might assure himselef of the
I Will? And therefore, though I commend peace before war; yet if the Country
cannot obtain a good peace without war, I think it consequently follows,
that it is necessary for you to make a war with your enemy, whilst you have
the advantage in your hands, whereby you may lay a sure foundation of a sure
peace for your Self, Posterity and State for after ages; rather then to
dream of a peace which shall no longer hold, then he is able by breaking to
revenge. For doubtless in the preservation of Kingdoms, it is no injury to
do that to your enemy, which he would do unto you, if he could. And
therefore those Princes, States or people whosoever, that shall build so
firmly upon the condition of peace to be kept by the enemy, the breach
whereof may turn to his or their great danger or destruction; that Prince,
State or people, in my opinion have either little the judgment of themselves,
or are ill advised of the Council: Security of their own estates, or too
much fidelity to others, have not only been the destruction of many families,
but likewise of great and potent Kingdoms, Provinces and Towns. And therefore
to this day, there could never be found so great lasetie to private men or
public States, as mistrust; as appears by Dimosthenes in his second to the
Athenians against Phillip of Macedon. There are (quoth he) devised many
strengths and defenses for the maintenance of Cities and Towns, as Trenches,
Walls, Ramparts, Dikes, Bulwarks, and such like, the which are made by men's
hands, with great cost and charge: but nature (faith he) has given to all wise
men a a common defense and safeguard; the which as it is profitable to all men
particularly, so it is a most wholesome and sure hold and fortress, to all
Countries and Cities, against all manner of tyranny, and what fortes to
mistrust, that which if it be well and surely kept, it will preserve and keep
you all. And therefore to prevent danger in a convenient season, and to provide
in time against the worst, is a thing most wholesome, necessary, and worthy of
greatest commendations. For as foresight makes men wary, so confident suspicion
helps judgment, and brings to light many hidden practices: and those that
do not fear the complots of their enemies, nor regard of forces preparations
against them, are doubtless near some disastrous fortune, or extreme, ruin
of their estates and fortunes.

How preiuditiall their treaties of peace have ever been to such Princes or
States with whom they have contended, is most evident, as well to us, as other
Nations, as appears by their Armado in 88, who came with fire and sword to cut
the throats of the people of this land: (had not God prevented their
treacherous resolutions.) At the self same time they had entertained us with a
maine show of a desire of peace, and our Commissioners being with them for the
same purpose. As also when Ferdinand of Aragon the last, and Phillip Archduke
of Austria were in treaty of marriage of Madam Stawij of France, with Charles
the fifth, and after was concluded, sworn and confirmed at Blois, the King of
France being Lewis the twelfth; his Lieftenants mistrusting nothing in respect
of the premises, the Spaniards set upon them, defeating two French Armies, the
one at Calabria, under the conduct of the Lord D Aubigney; the other at
Cernigola, led by the Duke of Nemuers; by which treacherous overthrow of these
two noble Captains, by don Consolis de Cordus, called the great Captain
Commander of the Spaniards in these parts: they arested from the French, most
of the pieces in Italy, which they keep until this day. And therefore
howsoever other men be opinionated of the Spanish faith and fidelity with your
Majesty and State, yet for my part, I will think of them, and their promises,
as a Noble man of Athens thought of a certain Orator. Your words (quoth he)
my friends are like the Cypress, which although great and high, bear no
fruit. And truly, as they are Spaniards I cannot well blame them; for they
well know, that the Crown of Spain is at stake, and all the Indies, and his
other Signiories, and therefore will not fail to put in practice all tricks
that may win the game, though it be by foul play. For if he have not peace
with England at this time, it is not unknown unto him that the foundation of
his Monarchy will be shaken in pieces. And we cannot but see this, and yet will
take no advantage thereof, whereby we may secure our selves both for present
and future times; we may be compared to the Athenians, of whom I have spoken
before, who by Titus Livius report were men, who knew what to do, but would
not do it: which is a fault so ominous to all states, that it not only
presents it self against; but likewise follows disasters and ruin to the
Commonwealth that refuses. For opportunity does not attend upon Captains and
Councillors pleasures, but shows it self on a sudden; and if not
embraced, passes away without returning; And therefore the advantages that one
State, that are enemies has of another, happen so seldom to the Globes, as
Saturn finisheth his course but in 30 years. But our enemy is free, and I
speak it to his honor, from this base and earthly resolution; for it is
reported of them, by this special virtue, they have raised their state to so
high a pitch: which is, that no people can readier find the occasion, or
sooner take, or resolve it, when it is offered. And doubtless, to say the
truth, I am much more fearful of the Spanish proceedings, for that he goes
by precedent: which is an excellent kind of discipline, as well in Martial as
civil actions; especially when the action is grounded upon a sure foundation.
And as all Kings and Captains which desire to attain to great things, do
imitate some one Prince, or General that has preceded them: so doubtless
have the Kings of Spain for these many years, imitated in all their actions
(as near as the time and States with whom they have contended would give them
leave) that noble, valiant and politic Captain Phillip of Macedon, who indeed
laid the foundation of his sons Monarchy, and this was his Maxim, That where
force could not preuail, he always used bribes and money to corrupt the
principal of the inhabitants: Insomuch that at a certain time at the assault
of a City, which to a Captain of his seemed impregnable, and therefore
thought to divert his purpose in the besieging thereof. Thou art a fool (quoth
he) for I will have this great City, notwithstanding the walls and ramparts,
if the Gates be so big that an Ass laden with gold can but enter. And
questionless, if your Majesty would but search into the Spaniards
proceedings, since he had the Indies, you should acquaint your self with many
such presidents of their part, to be a warning to you to look at this time
advisedly to your own safety, lest you fall into the like misfortunes. And
although I could allege many which (for brevities sake) I omit, yet I will
recite one (left it should be thought I knew none) which is, viz. When
Ferdinand of Aragon saw, by the sword he could not get the country of Rowsilton
and Perpignan, out of the hands of Charles the French King, which as they say
had been engaged to Lewis the 11, he fell to practice with them of Religion;
wherefore he corrupted with a great sum of money one Oliver Maillandor, as
some say, John de Madron a Franciscan Friar, Confessor to the Lady Brawnen the
Kings sister, who under the root of Religion, cloaking his hypocrysie and
coveteousnesse, persuaded this simple Lady, that unless restitution was made
of those Territories to the King of Spain, his government could not prosper,
nor please God; she being moved in conscience with this Friars persuasions,
brake this matter to Lewis of Amboise Bishop of S. Albie, the Kings
Schoolmaster, who together with her, so terrified the Kings conscience, that
he not only made restitution of the said Territories, by the said Bishop, but
likewise freely released to the King of Spain, the said Ferdinand, all the
money that Lewis his father had paid for them: Marry with condition, that the
said King and his Successors should ever love and honor the King of Frace,
that he should make no wars against it, nor aid with money, victuals nor
counsel, any enemies thereof, nor permit them to have passage through their
Dominions. And thus were the countries restored to the Frenchmens grief. But
the French King misreckoned himself in the Spanish fidelity, for having
occasion to war in Italy shortly after, he had no sooner past the Mountains,
but the King of Spain forgot all his kindness, and began to practice a league
with his enemies. So as I infer (mighty Prince) that either by show of
Religion, or subtle and sophistical Arguments; or in desire you have to trust
some about you, on whose shoulders ever (in regard of your opinion of their
wisdoms and fidelities) you cast your self, and your care of your estate, in
all, or either of these, you are like, without the more grace of God, to
receive disadvantage in this your peacemaking (and yet perhaps no fault in
them.) For it seems to me wonderful, that the truth of things being one; yet
may falsehood be so apparelled with the habits of likelihood and truth, as
(changing countenance) it is often retained in stead thereof. And for as much
as upon this Treaty now in hand, not only depends your own happiness, the
happiness of your noble Issue, States, Kingdoms, Subjects, or whatsoever else
is deer unto you; but likewise the happiness or unhappiness of all the
Princes of Europe. So (most gracious Lord) in respect of these great and mighty
dependances, as well in regard of your own particular, as general good of the
Christian Commonwealth, which so long has groaned under the fear of the
Spanish greatness, digest and distinguish every particular; and in a point, in
your own person, without trusting of any man with a matter of great
importance: which although it will be very intricate by the diversity of so
many things as will offer themselves to be considered, yet (renoumed
Sovereign) it will be very profitable to your Highness, and most acceptable
and pleasing to the people, when they shall hear and see the great care the
King has of them and their safety: For as Commines says, he thinks it the
greatest plague that God can lay upon a Realm to give them such a Prince as
shall in great things give his Authority unto others, which most especially in
such a case as this he ought to reserve unto himself. Although I confess
Princes ought to have Ministers in all things, especially in great matters, but
not to conclude any thing without the Princes assent; nor with him neither, but
by the relation of many circumstances, in regard of that affinity which truth
and falsehood have in many matters of great moment. And yet I protest out of my
own opinion, I am no way jealous of any of the Council; for as for them I
hold them to be all most noble and worthy personages, and fit to manage great
Kingdoms, as part of the Indies, and other Seigniories: which are as fit for
you to take, as the King of Spain to keep; which by your just command and
valor of the English and Scottish Nations shall be gained unto you and your
posterity; without which, whatsoever your Self thinks, or other men say,
neither you, nor your posterity can ever be safe, upon probable and reasonable
grounds, if the Spaniards intend to disquiet you, as I will now my self prove;
and as these following projects made by the Castilian themselves, may appear,
by the necessity they are in to be Masters of the I Will, viz. That a mighty King,
determining to preserve his own, has no better means then by conquering that
of another man's; always holding this as a Maxim, That whosoever preserves
getting nothing, neither by keeping his own, can subdue the will of perverse
men, that they may not be able to make him a disturbance. These reasons ought
more to prevail with your Majesty (quoth he) then with any other Prince,
since you hold your great State much dispersed, and the greatest part of your
power consists in things moveable and uncertain, which are the Indian Fleet;
which neither Garrisons, Fortresses, nor any good proceedings can hardly
assure; although your Majesty had great forces and power: as at this present
we may well perceive by this Pirat Drake, who with nothing is able to molest
the whole world, notwithstanding the provisions which are made on your
Majesty's behalf for the preventing thereof. Wherefore (says he) let your
Majesty entertain an enterprise against England; which both is, and may be
the principal disturber of your Indian Fleet and Commerce. Neither let your
Majesty suppose there can be a better or safer way, for the quiet of States, or
the advancement of your certain Greatness, then by removing this Mountain of
Disquiet to your most high and Kingly purposes, and conquering of this I Will. As
also Don Phillip the second, of Castile, having a great and earnest desire to
make himself Master of this I Will of the world, and peceiving two obstacles to
curb his proceedings in that kind; to wit, the wars of the Netherlands, and
the Jealousy of this State of ours has ever had of his Greatness; and being
desirous to have the fountain of this happiness to spring from one of those
two heads determining to build this resolution, which with most ease, most
honor, most safety, and most advantage, might be carried to his after
designs. Upon consideration whereof, and mature deliberation, reasons were
alleged pro and contra, amongst which, in my judgment, some are most
prevailent reasons, and such doubts as the Spanish King from the mouth of him
who made Reason his ground, and Experience his schoolmaster for what he said,
and are following. It is my determination in this present Discourse (said he)
to show, as your renoumed Seigniorie commands me, by way of Real foundation,
that it is much more expedient for that purpose of your Catholic Majesty to
move your war against England then the Netherlands, declaring thus much
notwithstanding real foundation in this point, I mean not common principles of
nature, or of science, neither of Mathematical demonstrations of this present
subject, is not capable, but rather reasons probably grounded upon truth. There
are many, who but observing the first view of your Catholic Majesty's
interest to Flanders and England affirm, that though this Island by just
pretention pertains to your Majesty, yet you are so much the more bound to
recover those countries of the Netherlands rather then conquer England; by how
much by all policy, the preservation of things already possessed, must go
before things never enjoyed. But though this be a great position in public
affairs, yet we entreating of matters of State (I) will not judge it of that
weight as that it may weigh down the balance; which galling the one side more
then the other, might impair the whole sum and safety of things. We must
consider what ought; but further how it is possible, more profitable, more
easy, more expedient to be done. For oftentimes Princes are so pricked to
war by the stimulation of honor, or of their desire to some enterprise, as
that the bridle of many other circumstances, which would requisitely be
considered, cannot draw them back. For an example of this, we may set before
our eyes the Venetian Common wealth, who thinking of nothing else but their
duty to be revenged on the Duke of Millain; preferred immoderate ambition
before all other respects; and so, too late, remembered, that the office of
prudence, is to moderate passions, and spleen in important resolutions:
especially when they draw after them a tail or train of great inconveniences.
The consideration thereof; that we are more bound to preserve the things we
possess, then conquer new, is not sufficient to conclude that your Majesty
ought to take in hand the enterprise of Flanders rather then England; neither
in that so importunate affiaires should we seek occasion so light, But to the
end it may appear evidently, that in every respect your Majesty is bound to
the enterprise of England, I will before any thing establish a foundation to
that whole edifice of my opinion, viz. That in subduing of England, you
overcome at the same time the Netherlands also; but having overcome the
Netherlands, England is not presentiy subdued; neither does per-adventure the
hope increase that you shall after conquer it. But I affirm moreover, that to
conquer England is not an action more difficult, or less certain, then if it
were the Netherlands: For if England do consequently draw after it the
Netherlands; and if it be more easy and more secure, who doubts, but he that
should pervert this course would be a right destroyer of Opportunity; and so
become the forger of his own disgrace. But I will prove with prevailent
Reasons, that one and the other member of my foundation, which is, that the
victory of England, is more profitable then that of the Netherlands, and more
easy to obtain. As for the proof of my first foundation, I betake my self
to these principal heads. The first is: If the Netherlands had not maintained
war so many years, but by the aid and succor of England; that which has
still supplied fuel to the flames and fire of the rebellion: For if England
would but fail them it is clear, they could not stand out; no more then a
living body can be preserved without nourishment and it is more securely
extinguished by taking away the maintenance and nourishment thereof, then by
striving to quench it by his contrary: For having no nourishment at all, the
violent heat is used against it self, and so by it self consumed: but we
determining to overcome it by the contrary, it may fall out, that instead of
extinguishing it, the force of it may be much increased, if the contrary be
subdued by the same: And therefore the Florentines then, and not before,
quenched the fire of the Pison rebellion, when they took away the fuel and
nourishment from it, which came from strangers, by cutting off Princes their
Collegates, and the gaining their City in one action; which otherwise all
their own force, and their Confederates would not have been sufficient to
obtain. The other is; for if England with her succors which she sends, not
only maintains the Netherlands secure, with the bare hope of her shadow: for
they count themselves in banishment, as it were, while they see before their
eyes the Spanish forces; and so would still do, if they did not know the
English will always be ready to buckle with any one, that with a mighty Fleet
should pass by these parts. In this respect the Athenians thought themselves
sure from Phillips force, while the Town of Ohinton stood out; and so on the
contrary, when the Ohintons were overcome, then saw they no impediments that
could keep the enemy from them. Even so, if England should fall into the hands
of your Majesty, the whole foundation of the Rebels obstinacy were shaken,
the fortress and back being removed, by favor of which they have daily
nourished the spirits of pride and insolency: so as the soul and spirit
yields England, being taken away; we may perceive that the conquest of the
Netherlands is easily brought forth by the victory, as her lawful daughter;
and that the end follows not as the daughter, or as the other being her
mother, but even as inseparably, as the shadow the body, or nourishment the
life. As also this reason which I will now recite, is infallibly grounded upon
the direct rule of Art Millitarie: which is, that you ought never to employ
your self in the assault of any place, if their remain still at your back a
mighty means of some disturbance: Wherefore it is no sound deliberation to
fasten first on the enterprise of the Netherlands; when you leave one
ill-affected on your back, which peradventure may suddenly assail and break
through in the midst of the Catholic Army, in the heart of the wars with the
Netherlands. Charles the 5, his attempt in Province had unhappy success, for
no other cause but that he contemned the advice of the Marquis Masto: which
was, that first, before anything, he should expugne the fortress. But that
resolution being not taken by Charles, was no less pernicious to the
Imperialists then to the Author of that Council, Antonio de Leva. Another
reason is, attempting the war upon the Netherlands, you come to buckle with
brave experienced Soldiers, and men brought up in war; as on the contrary,
the English want Art and Discipline Millitarie. I may give the same comparison,
that may be made between Idleness and Experience; armed and unarmed; and how
advantageous it is to fight with unskilful Soldiers: Amongst many other; the
example of Meltiades, in the field of Manathon, shows evidently; who with
less then ten thousand brave Soldiers, put to flight the force of unhappy
Xerxes, who had more then six hundred thousand with him. An other is, that the
Netherlands must be conquered by handfulls, and have full, or whole Arms
employed in beleagering this or that Fort; otherwise per-adventure of no great
importance; but as it may be a stop to his course of victory, that goes about
to seiz upon the Country. Whereas contrarily England has no strong Towers or
Fortresses, as well within as without: there is no doubt of that enterprise,
and is as much more easy then this; as it is a less matter to overcome them
that do not resist, then those that do fight upon warlike advantages. There
is no better example to be produced to your Highness, then of the self same
Country of the Netherlands; in which, notwithstanding that your Majesty has
placed such strong Garrisons, yet in every step such prevailent accidents do
occur, that oftentimes the Assaylants are overcome, by the often oppositions
that these Fortresses use toward them: Even as on the contrary, the Kingdom
of Portugal, there being no convenient Fortresses to give impediment to the
forces of the Soldiers, were suffered to enter into the very heart of the
land; they being not able to make any manner of defenses to defend the same.
Another reason is, for that the Fortresses are as prejudicial to the
Assaylants, after they have obtained them, as they were before, by reason the
Conqueror is forced to distribute his Army into many members, by which they
are greatly weakened. So that, by this that has been spoken, it may appear,
that it is much more convenient; nay, as it seems, much more easy for your
Highness to push at England then the Netherlands; and therefore I will discourse
of that Enterprise; not in comparison of the other, as heretofore I have done,
but in respect of it self; manifesting certain principles, which do better
declare and make manifest the opportunity and facility thereof. In my opinion
therefore it is a thing not to be doubted, if medicine is then truly so called
wholesome, when it has reference, not only to the offended part or member,
but further to cut off the root of the evil. And therefore if your Majesty
shall enter into the conquest of the Netherlands, you but peradventure cure the
wounds of that rebellion, but you shall not evacuate the causes of the
beginnings of these ill humors, which have daily sent nourishment to the
disease: considering England is the place which has given sustenance to the
rebellious States. And though these Provinces were yours for this present,
disposition; yet what can that be, in a body subject to continual suggestion
of matter, which in it own nature presents in the stomach some portion of
offensive humor: Your Majesty must therefore necessarily assault England; to
the end you may afterward either securely digest, or evacuate these
concourses: But to discourse more at large of the facility of the enterprise; I
deny not truly but that England is a very mighty Kingdom; and the greatest
Island that ever we find any mention made of by the Ancients, seeing it
contains Scotland within the same, running 2000 miles in a circuit, although
our modern Writers make a computation of 200 less. By Nature it has been
favored with a security of a wall, or with a rampart: but yet notwithstanding
it is most true, that the reputation that that Island holds in warlike
actions, is rather grounded on that it was in time past, then that which it
has at this present: and therefore as it often happens, the mind grown
great, with the bundles of imaginations wherewith it is maintained, though the
foundation whereon it depends be changed, and diminished: Yet for all that,
is the estimation of England great in our minds, because we all behold it
with the self same eye of consideration, as we are wont to do at all other
times; when as in ancient, for succession of more then 300 years, it possessed
Normandy, Britain, Gutenne and Gascoigne, and made Scotland tributary, and
for a long time enjoyed the most part of the Kingdom of France, upon which
Henry the 6, was publicly crowned at Paris. But those that have diligently
observed her now when she is deprived of so great forces and aid, will judge
that she is greater through the reputation of her ancient fame, then for the
quality of her persent power and force: and that she is now no more England,
so grievous and terrible to the greatest Princes of Europe; and since that with
so unhappy a resolution she fell into obscurity, she has been driven of
necessity to submit her self to those fearful things, which alteration of
Religion and faith draw after them. A most mighty and prevailent means to the
ruin and declination of States: For if Religion be the only base of all the
peoples obedience and loyalty, who doubts, but that being removed, all rule
of life goes to the ground; and together all laws, both Divine and Humane
have dispensation. In which parties, or rather habites, of this most pernicious
beast, are most miserable, how much the mutations have been sudden and
violent; as above all other, these of England have been, which from the height
of Religion threw it self headlong into the depth of Infidelity; from whence
rising again into the Catholic light from whence it came; and a fresh to fall
ruinously into the darkness of heresy: which is so prejudicial unto States,
as there is no greater pestilencie; or that more weakens the sollidity of their
forces. England therefore in these outrageous storms must needs have suffered
ship, wrack, of which we may plainly see the effects, if we do but observe
she has lost the foundation, whereupon no less her reputation, then security
was grounded: that is, she has lost the power and authority which sometimes
she had in sea-affaires; for in times past this Island maintained a great
number of Ships, and kept a continual Fleet of Arms, whereupon it came to
pass; that minding to try the strength of her own forces, the preparation was
admirable; amongst others we may see that when Henry the sixth of England,
went against Charles the sixth of France, with near eight hundred great Ships,
which made a bridge over the Ocean: but the quantity of that Island is so
diverse, and changed, that since the days of Henry seventh and eighth, it has
not been able to maintain one hundred ordinary Ships; which it was wont to
wey, and have in readiness for the security of the State: and further, this
Island has been put to such pinches, that they have not only been constrained
to diminish, but to sell outright a great part of their Shipping, which both
was, and is, their only security from foreign danger: so much more urgent
in Princes is fear of present poverty, then the respect of their future
safety. So that now, coming to resolve on the point of facility, that your
Majesty shall now find in that Enterprise against this Island, I will offer to
your Highness two principal heads; the one of the Defendant, the other of the
Assaylant, whereby I will show, that the assailed is as unable to defend, as
the Defendant is to assail. As for the Defendant (which is the Kingdom of
England) it may certainly be averred, that it cannot stand out in defensive
war against the forces of your Majesty, if you will but invade it with the
provisions, which is easy for you to compass, and such as the Enterprise, and
importance of the action requires, the which I will clearly show for diverse
respect. The first is; because, as I have said, the I Will of England is poor;
and therefore is her debility such, as if she should go about to manage a
defensive was against so mighty and potent, as your Catholic Majesty, she
might as well go about to sustain heaven on her shoulders, being neither
Alcides nor Atlas. The second is, for the consideration of the necessity which
possesses there the State of England; has no more in readiness such number
of ships as were sometimes maintained for the protection and security of
their Kingdom. The third is, that the Kingdom of England, by carelessness
neglected, or by poverty omitted, to have always in readiness; prepared, or
practiced Men, Arms, or provision, as all other Princes have, to the end they
may be a present remedy to all sudden Insurrections, which grows either at
home or abroad. The fourth is, because the desire of Innovation is proper to
the Kingdom, whose minds do always aspire after change; and whosoever does
not observe former histories, will judge that her seditious conspiracies, and
every other effect of a disturbed and moving mind, have had their proper nest;
being stirred up with considerations, which being accompanied with the ordinary
disposition of the people to be always attempting of new things, may easily of
a sudden, if it were assaulted, put the Realm into confusion; especially
when the Army of so mighty an enemy as your Majesty, shall present it self,
whereby rebels may liberally discover their hearts without being chastised. So
as this people being any way ill-affected, which meeting with their manner of
disposition, may peradventure easily give occasion, if your Majesty had no
party in England, which you shall never fail off to some unlooked for action,
if your Catholic Armies did but show themselves. It being so ordinary a matter
with that people, when they are masked with some great passion, either of hatred
or disdain toward them that govern, that they will be ever ready to tak al
courses in hand that may be hurtful to him: Even so that Tantanus discontented
with government of Cajus Iberius, brought in before his face the Carthagenians.
First, the English in respect of their ancient greatness, have bin more
accustomed to molest others, then to be molested themselves; and when they
shall see themselves overwhelmed, as it were with an innumeratio^ of brave
Soldiers and Captains, they will grow wonderfully astonished: even as that
change of fortunes countenanc is a terible spectacle to those to whom this
sight is unusual: for by that means Greece which was sometimes Empress of
the whole East, fell suddenly into other men's hands; who of an Assaylant,
became assailed. And lastly, though nature get thus much in behalf of them,
that England be well furnished with Arms, men, victuals, and ships, and
whatsoever else is necessary for the wars; yet (say I) all this is nothing,
when the quality and condition is wanting, which gives form and essence to all
enterprises; which is money: which the Kingdom of England, no less through the
scarcity of Revenues, as by the charge of ordinary expenses is brought unto;
which they shall never be able to recover, by their trades and Commerce, if the
use of the sea be taken from them: and therefore will never be able to supply
expense of a defensive Army Royal, when it has scarcely enough to supply
their own necessaries, especially against so great and magnificent a Prince as
your most Catholic Majesty, who embraces within the circuits of your
Dominions, the whole Diameter of the earthly Globe, and possesses more land at
this day, then all the Monarchs and Republiques of the world have: A most
opulent Prince in Arms, Men, Money, Soldiers, Captains, Ships, Victuals, and
all other provision of war: and a Prince, who like a Moderator, or
Arbitrator, seems to hold in his hands, the bridle of Empire, both of the sea
and land. And whereas it may be objected that the Galleys which do you no
service in that expidition, being vessels of great consequence in battles by
sea: your enterprise of Portugal, and of the Island, if it did not quite remove
it; yet did it much abate the superstitious credulity of ours* that those
Vessels are not good at any time to pass the Ocean withal; as if there were
no fair weather in that sea in the Summer; or that fair weather were abortiue
in shipping: there is no doubt but that Galleys may securely pass, and hazard
themselves in that Sea in the Summer, for three months: And those that will
object the contrary, by the overthrow of the sea there, let them be contented to
observe well, that the same Anchor met not with no inward, but outward
occasion, in the sea of that overthrow: For Caesar ignorantly could not
discern the time of the Moon which was then in the full, and being mistaken by
reason of her too much humidity, does use to disturb, not only the Ocean, but
all the coasts, and the dominion she holds of the salt waters. And therefore
in respect of the great honesty and equity accompanying the cause; with it so
honorable and godly life, as the planting the Christian faith and religion, no
obstacle can be sufficient to stay the force of divine power, serving under the
standerd of Christ; and therefore most weak, and but a shadow shall all humane
help be which shall oppose it self against the will of the great Arbitrator.
But such as are the pretentions of your Majesty over this Kingdom, and such
the obligations wherein you stand bound for the recovery of your own, the title
of a Grandfather and Predecessors of famous memory; as there is no enterprise
so peculiar and proper for you to undertake as this: for that you go not only
to possess your self of the right which you have to this Kingdom, but
likewise to make your self the most famous King that ever was in the memory of
all the Princes of the world; adding by this means unto the Crown of Spain,
a Kingdom so illustrous, so mighty, and so famous.

By the relation of the Spanish project, against this State of England, most
Illustrious Prince, may well appear unto your Highness, that the Spaniard
himself well knows, that there is no way for the expectation of his further
Greatness; no great possession of the high Monarchy, which he himself
alleges that he already enjoys, but the conquering of this I Will, and adding
it to the Crown of Spain; and therefore, if he had any other means to attain
to this, by him so violently longed for, then by a peace: why should not your
Majesty think, that the peace he means to make with you at this time, is
for that purpose, and for no other intent? and therefore, my good Lord, I
cannot, as one standing upon the firm land, gaze upon the shipwreck of my
Country, being so doubtfully tossed, and floting in the dangerous sea of
dissension, betwixt peace and war, with one that will make a peace with you,
for no other end and purpose, but that he may be the better able to make
war hereafter against you. But to cast out the last anchor hold of my self,
which is boldness and frcenesse of speech to you (my most renoumed Sovereign)
to prevent if I can these extreme and certain dangers, wherein both your
Self, your States, and glory of the English and Scottish names, are likely to
be plunged, when the Spaniards ability shall be such, as there shall be no
let, but his good nature, to insult over you: which howsoever your Highness,
or others, think contrary, will in four or five years, if he enjoy his
Indies be brought to pass. Surely, my gracious Sovereign, I am of opinion
against Phillip of Spain, in the behalf of my Country, as that noble
Commonwealths man Demosthenes, against Philip of Macedon in behalf of the
Athenians; which no doubt has much affinity with our case at this time. For
Phillip seeing whilst he had war with Athens (at which he principally aimed)
he could never overcome the other Provinces of Thebeans, Lacedaemonians,
Thessalians, Ihocians, Ointans, and the rest, and till they were overcome he
could never get Athens, began to take another course: which was, to bribe with
money and gifts, Councillors or Orators of that State to be of his side; and by
that means to be secure from the forces of that Republique or Commonwealth,
till he had, by one and one, overcome the rest. But good Demosthenes perceived
him by and by, and warned the Thebeans of that Treason; but these traitors of
Philips faction being grown great in the City, by means of the bounty they
had daily received for rewards of their treason; as also the Athenians were
then, as we are now, not willing to hear of any wars or change to be brought
against them; which always these Traitors join with the multitude, in
assuring them that Phillip of Macedon meant them no harm, was the only cause
that all the other Provinces aforenamed were overcome; but also the noble and
stately City by him and Antepator his successor. And therefore since that like
examples, whilst the world does last, will bring forth like effects, I will be
of Demosthenes mind; if since we cannot shun the wars with Spain, either
at this time, or hereafter, when he has made himself more strong; either by
the conquest of his neighbors, or other wise: that you should begin with him
whilst you have the advantage of him; and then you shall by proof find how
profitable it will be unto you; when you must needs do a thing, to do it with
a courage and cheerfulness, and forasmuch as there is no man of another mind,
but that we shall have the King of Spain, by so much more our mighty enemy,
the greater Princes suffer him to be. Oh why be we so backward, or why linger
you oh noble King, the great Commander of the brave spirits of the English and
Scottish Nation, to do that in reason and necessity you ought? Our fathers,
when they were Masters but of one part of the I Will, were never wont to fear any
thing in matters of war, but if the sky should fall upon them, sailed over
many a Sea to make their weapons glister in the bowels of other Kingdoms;
being by the honesty of their actions, and nobleness of their courage assured.
And shall your Majesty, by whose blessed arrival to this part of your
Ancestors, and having brought home once again in your ship of Union, our
brethren and kinsmen, no less valiant then our selves, being desended from the
blood of our Ancestors, and turned from us by the iniquity of time, and
dissentions of some mutinous persons of either part; which we must not account
proceeded by consent of both people; neither measure the intents of great
nations according to the notable wickedness of some particulars? Shall you I
say, who has renewed again the ancient same of this I Will (by which, for Valor,
for Men, for Munitions, for Engines, for War, no Prince under heaven can
lightly compare) be doubtful to undertake a war to which you are so
necessarily incited; as well for the glory of God, the advancement of Christian
Religion in all parts; as also your particular safety, which can never be
certain to You, nor us your posterity, but by the abatement of the Spanish
greatness, by means whereof many murders, massacres, and rebellions have been
made in Europe. No no (my renoumed Sovereign) be it far from your magnanimous
mind, to harbor a thought so unworthy that virtue, that shines so apparent in
all men's eyes; but rather since the nature of the Countries, the inclination of
the Subjects, and the valors of the people, do seek to overcome the violence
of the enemies; let them be seconed by the Kingly command, under which word,
there is no question of victory. Your Predecessors of famous memory,
undertook these wars upon discreet, and premeditated considerations; not
only chewed for many years together, but likewise digested by the experience
of time, Conclusions of the Spaniards part of diverse things against this State,
and probability of many more dangers like to ensue, both against the people and
country: And therefore (most renoumed Sovereign) if the addition you add in
your own Greatness and Person, to this your right inheritance of England, be
not sufficient to alter the consideration of your former policies, in my mind;
you ought to be well advised, before you stray from the paths of your
Predecessors, who built their only safety upon the preservation of the
Netherlands, and abatement of the Spaniards Greatness, as by diverse excellent
reasons, whereupon they undertook openly these wars, may appear. But perhaps
it may be said, that the person of the Prince does alter the pretense of the
enemy I hope I shall need to say little on that point, to so highly wise,
learned and juditious a Lord, as your Highness; especially when it is apparent
to your Majesty, that the Spaniards build their certain Greatness upon no one
thing so much, as the ruin and destruction of this land, as by their foregoing
projects appears. But moreover, if they could not love the Princes of their
blood, race, and kindred; as the King of Naples, Cicily and Navarre, whom they
not only deposed from their Kingdoms, but likewise some of them from their
lives, under no pretense of reason or justice, but only thirsting after blood
and Seigniories, I shall infinitely mistrust his regard of the safety of your
noble and fotunate Issue. And if your Majesty will go by precedent (which is
most fit to most actions that do minister themselves to men) and but examine
how the Monarchy of Spain has but raised himself to his Greatness, you shall
no doubt perceive (by comparing time past, with that which is like to follow)
the irrecoverable dangers you are like to fall into, by making peace with them,
that for advantage will hold it Religion to break with you. And for that, from
Ferdinand of Aragons time they have begun to render themselves so fearful to
their neighbors, which as it were yesterday, your Highness may acquaint your
self with their unjustactions, which are fresh in memory to their
unchristianlike wounds, given to many Christian Princes, still bleeding;
whereby you may the better discern and distinguish them. For as Ferdinand
himself, which was the root from whence their Princes sprang, there was no
King in his time more unjust, more cruel, or more bloody, thirsting after
blood, and breach of faith with all Princes, with whom he had to do; although
they were his Cousen-germaines, his brother in law, his Sisters and Niece; and
indeed laid his foundation of the Spanish Monarchy upon such base and
treacherous foundations: For Charles the fifth, how he behaved himself in his
time amongst the Princes of Christendom, I cannot more aptly refer your
Majesty to a brief relation thereof, then by an Oration made by a worthy
Gentleman, who had particularly acquainted himself with the accidents of that
time, which he wrote, and dedicated to the two young Earls of Embden long
since. For Phillip the second, what blood has he caused to be shed both in
England, Portugal, France, the Netherlands and Ireland, is it not known to all
Christian Princes? Besides, the often seeking of the innocent blood, of that
most noble, and thrice renoumed Predecessor of famous memory Elizabeth, Queen
of this land, which if, so it were, there were no other witness of his Goatish
and Moorish inclination (as there are thousands) were it not enough to enroule
and memorize him in the rank of unworthie and tyrannous Potentates? For
Phillip the third, although he be young, yet is he a Spaniard: and whatsoever
the wisest of the world have ever thought of the nature and qualltie of a
Spaniard, is apparent: For Francis Guicciardine (a man so sufficient, as the
very reckoning of his very worth and perfections would require a story) says
of them The Spanish Nation are covetous and deceitful, and where they be at
liberty, exceeding outrageous, tyrannous, and very proud and insolent. And
Andrew.. a famous Senator of Venice, says of them; That they are unfaithful,
ravenous, and the most unsatiable of all Nations: For where is it (says he)
of all the parts of the world, where these infamous Harpies set their feet,
which is not defiled with the footsteps of most abominable vices; and yet the
shot of their Pistols do so dazell the eyes of many in this land, that they
are not ashamed to defend them to be the most noble, most faithful, and most
honorable Nation in the world. Another writes of them; That they are loathsome
Swine, theevish Owls, and bragging Peacocks: For (says he) whosoever would
behold the lively protrature of them, without troubling himself with the
overturning of Martial or Terence, let him but behold the grim speech of a
stately Spaniard. By whom, most mighty Prince, I may well say, and according
to truth, that the world of America was not so much unknown to the former
ages, as their monstrous outrageous, and new devised cruelties, which these
divelish and tyrannous Spaniards have unhumanely practiced amongst the simple
and innocent people, as appears by Don Bartholmew de la Casas Bishop of...
and other of their own Historiographers. And although my self, being a
stranger, which have some time served against them, both in the Indies and else
where, could say much of their cruelties, by relation of such their slaves as I
have taken, yet for that my eyes have not seen them, I will forbear in modesty
to charge them; only I will relate, from the mouth of a true reporter, a
worthy Gentleman of this Land, Sir Francis Drake, one truth; that by that, your
Majesty might be induced to believe the rest. He once talking with me of the
Indies, told me, That he being in the South Sea, after he had taken his prize,
he had thought to have ventured to have come home by the Northward, and stood
his course to the I Will of Canes, being 12. degrees of the North latitude, and
from thence to Aqua Palce, upon the maine, being 16 degrees, at one of the
Poort towns of the City of Mixico; where going a shore, he found an old
Negro, tied in a chain of 20 yards long, which had been condemned by the
justice of the place; for that sometimes being oppressed with too much labor,
the poor old man would run into the woods, and absent himself from his
Majesty's work; his sentence was, that he should be whipped, with whips, til
he was all raw and bloody; and afterward being tied in a chain to be eaten
with flies; which poor soul he released from that miserable death, and took
him away with him: And therefore oh Turk, oh Scithians, and Tartarians,
rejoice ye now all, since now, there is to be found at this day a Nation in
Christendom, which by the unhappy and cursed behavior, do increase the
hatred that men have borne to the barbarous and ungracious cruelties. And
therefore, most renowned Sovereign, I should be sorry, in regard of the
premises, that you should commit so great a fault in the government of the
great and mighty Kingdoms, which is not sufferable to a private Captain over
a few soldiers, to say, I do not think it: so when he has by his own
temerity, or fool-hardinesse, committed an action for want of due respect, to
the subjects, undertaken that has made him disastrous, and unfortunate in his
honor, and the times of his people, (which desire rather to give them received
Laws... For the desire of honor to advance States, and enlarge Kingdoms, is
naturally grafted in the hearts of all Princes of noble spirits; and there was
never any King, of a worthy and high courage, but desired to leave to
his-posterity the memory of some noble and worthy action (as the Armerican
world) by doing whereof, you shall not only procure safety to your self, and
those that shall succeed you in your Royal Seat, but general happiness to
so many millions of people, which at this day sit in darkness and the shadow
of death; and is a thing so far from discommendation or reproach* as you
shall be so qualified in all succeeding ages, with the most happy, most
gracious, and most fortunate Princes of the world. But yet I do not deny, but
Princes may have such grounds and reasons to trust some private men, or
foreign Princes, as being deceived by them, and they should say, I never
would have thought it, yet are not worthy of reprehention: as for example; That
Prince ought not to be blamed, that has put in a Fortress some one Captain;
or place, in a Country some one Prince, either of which have received goods or
honors from him, and yet in the end is betrayed by them, and hereupon the
knowledge thereof should say, I would never have thought it, that such a man
should have betrayed me, that Prince is not to be blamed; as it happened to
Lewis Morre Duke of Millaine, who having committed the Castle of the City to
one Damerdine Covet, whom he had so absolutely raised, and made obliged to him
by infinite graces and benefits; yet notwithstanding was by the said Covet
betrayed to his perpetual dishonor and infamy. This Duke was no way to be
blamed. As also your Majesty ought not to be reproved, who providing for every
mischief, is assailed by some strange accidents, that was not possible for
your Majesty, in judgment or council to foresee, or prevent: as being not
possible with reason to foresee a thing, which of it self is a thing without
reason. As for example, was that most grievous accident of the powder, and
other munition, prepared to be sent to diverse places before the Castle gate of
the said City, which took fire, and was burnt by lightning from heaven when
the weather was fair and clear, whereby afterward ensued to the State so
many losses and discommodities: upon this occasion, if the Captain of the
Castle should have said, I had never thought that this weather would have
brought so great and unfortunate a chance to me, he had deserved no reproof
at all. But if before your Majesty's eyes, it be apparent, that a manifest
known enemy to the State, who as Demosthenes said, hates the very Religion of
Athens, who has not only long thirsted after the Seigniorie of your Kingdom,
in his secret designs, but likewise by open force of fire and sword has
assailed them; If you will trust such an one, and after upon his breaking say,
You would not have believed that the King of Spain would have dealt so with
you: Doubtless (renoumed Sovereign) the world will not fail to tax you with
such carelessnesse and improvidence, as I hope shall never have any affinity
with your most Excellent Majesty, or any other of your Royal Offspring that
shall sway the Scepter of this noble I Will. And therefore (my gracious Lord) in
my judgment, you ought to do in this, so great a matter of State, as
concluding a peace with so dangerous enemies as the Spanish Nation, as good and
wise Carpenters seem to do in substantial buildings; which is, to make a
sure foundation, lest by aspiring mind or breach of the enemy you be
overthrown. And whereas he says in the foregoing project, that he has right
and good title to the Crown of England, by virtue of his Grandfather and
Predecessors (which I know to be otherwise) yet contrarily can I prove your
Majesty, by the virtue of your Grandfather of famous memory Henry the 7, to
be as rightful Heir to all the firm land of the Indies, as the King of
Spain is to the Islands of Cuba, Iannura and Hispaniola, with the rest of the
Islands of Lucaites Grante, and Antile: and for that it is not inconvenient
fully to take notice, and understand how these Kings intitles themselves and
their Successors to the right and Signiories of the Indies, I have thought good
to set down my opinion, how many ways they do, or may take their claim: And
first by discovery; secondly, by the Popes gift; thirdly, by consent of the
people; fourthly, by conquest and consent. So as if neither of these be able to
prove or give a good and sufficient title (or at least such a one as may bar
you and other Princes that will, to inhabit in those parts) I know no reason
why your Majesty should not do as he has done; that is, to possess as much
as you can of those Heathen Countries; especially where the Spaniard is not
feared, nor has no command: whereby you might not only propagate the
Christian faith amongst those Pagans and infidels, as you are bound to do, as
much as you can; but a golden world to the Crown of England: whereby you be
more enabled, as well to undertake a foreign war against the enemy of the
Christian name; as also to make your State the more strong by the Indian
treasures, against such of your neighbors as shall envy your Highness. And
therefore to come to this Title: If he claim his interest by possession and
first Discovery (which doubtless must be the strongest title that he can
challenge) then your Majesty has as much title for all the firm land of the
Indies, as he has for these Islands before named. As for proof of this, the
Captains of Henry the 7, being Sebastian Cabot, and his companions, discovered
the Island of the Indies, on the north part of the Indies, from 60 degrees,
coasting the north latitude; the very year before Christian Columbus
discovered the high land of Dania, on the south part of the Indies; which was
the first day that ever the Spaniards saw the maine, and took possession of
that new Discovery in the behalf of Henry the 7, and his successors their
Lord and Master. So as if first Discovery and Possession be his Title, your
Majesty preceding him in that said Title, must necessarily precede him in the
right thereof. If he claim it by the gift of Pope Alexander the sixth, then it
must be argued whether the said Pope had power to give it, yea, or no; if not,
then the gift is void in it self: if yea, he must prove it either by Divine
or Humane Argument; for Humane he cannot, for that no way belonged to him, or
any other Christian Prince or Potentate, at that time; nor were so much as ever
heard of, before that present Discovery of Columbus, upon which the gift was
made in the year of grace 1492. All things never known to him, or his
Ancestors, can no way of right belong to him or them; so as not belonging to
him, directly or by circumstance, he had no right to give or dispose thereof,
either in present or future; and thus for Humane. For Divine Arguments; if he
say he gave them as Christ's Vicar, whereby he may dispose of Kings or Kingdoms,
he must prove that authority by the word of God, or else we are not bound to
believe him, or think his gift of any value. As for example, if he be but
Christ's servant here on earth, he must challenge to himself no more
prerogative then his Master took on him whilst he was on earth; for if he
do, it is a great token of pride and arrogancy. And our Savior being but
requested to make a lawful division of a certain inheritance betwixt one and
his brother, refused to do it; saying, Who made me a Judge over you? as also
he confessed openly to Pilate, That his Kingdom is not of this world. Why then
does the Pope, who acknowledges himself to be no better then his servant,
take upon him the giving of so many Kingdoms of this world. But the Pope, say
they, gave Ireland to Henry the 2, and his successors: and indeed they did so
in word; but when had he it? when he had fast footing in it, and when Dernitius
the King of Lemster had made the King of England his Heir. But for all that
donation, had not the Kings of this land, but the sharpness of the sword more
prevailed, then by this gift, the Popes donatio^ had stood in little stead;
neither did the rest of the Irish Kings admit or allow of the Popes Donation;
for if they had, they would never have rebelled so often against this Crown.
But to conclude this point; though we confess, that the Popes have done this
or that, yet it is no good argument, in my opinion, to say that they did it,
and therefore it was lawful, unless they could show they did it rightfully.
But the Popes gift of the West Indies, may well be compared to the Sermon of
Judge Molineux his Chaplin in Queen Mary's days, who would make it appear, by
a linely text out of the Scripture to his Parishioners, what a lying knave the
devil was: and for his Text, he took the place where the devil took Christ
and carried him up to the mountain, from whenc he showed him all the Kingdoms
of the world; and told him, if he would fall down and worship him, he would
give them all unto him. My Masters (quoth he) by this you may well perceive
what a liar he is; for he had no more right to have given him these Kingdoms
(if he would have fallen down and worshipped him,) then my self, that am now in
the Pulpit. If I should say to you all now; Sirs, if you will all fall down
and worship me, before I go out of the Church, I will give every man his
Copie-hold for ever; which if I should do, I should give you your livings in
words: But my Masters (quoth he) that sit there below to whom they belong,
would take them from you again: and therefore (says he) if he had given all
these Kingdoms to Christ, the Kings of the earth, to whom by right they did
pertain, would never have suffered him to have enjoyed them. And so for that,
-- For the earth is the Lords, and all that dwell therein, he founded and
prepared it, as in the Psalmist: and so consequently, neither the Popes, nor
the diuils, do dispose to whom they please. The copy of which foolish
donation of the Popes, truly translated out of the original, has been
delivered to your Majesty long since, and (I hope) perused before this time.
To prove that he has no general consent of all the people and Nations of the
Indies, appears most evidently, by this reason; for that no Spaniard farther
inhabiteth northward then Florida, where they have but two little Forts or
Villages, the one called S. Austine, the other S. Helena: All the rest of that
hugh tract, whose infiniteness is such, (as no mortal tongue can express,
nor eye has seen,) do not so much as think there is another world but that
they themselves inhabit, except some few of them which dwell upon the edges of
the shore, that sometimes see both us, the French, the Dutch, and the Spaniard,
when we come a fishing, but are not able to distinguish of us, but think us
all one people: then how can we imagine, that these people have freely given
themselves to the Spanish obedience, and acknowledge him for their Lord and
King, when they never so much as heard that there was such a man or Nation.
Again, from Capi culli formia, all the land that tunneth-and makes the
strange of Anian, and the Netherlands thereof, whose bounds and limits are
never discovered; the Spanyard has not so much as once seated himself to make
himself known, whereby there might be any likelihood that they had
acknowledged him for their Sovereign. And for us to believe that the Spaniard
is Lord of such, whom he has never seen nor known, nor they him, were a
manifest sign of a strong faith in us. And there were no way for any man to
make me believe Miracles sooner, then by making me believe this: for after the
belief of this, I should never doubt of any miracle, though he should tell me
a thousand in a day: So that if this title come not by consent of all in
general, he neither ought to write himself Lord of the whole Indies, nor
debar other Christians from conquering or trading in those parts where the
Spanyard has neither residence nor Seigniory, nor command. If he challenge
right by conquest and consent then must he claim no more, then he has by
conquest and consent obtained. As for example, all that part of the West
Indies, which at this day is scatteringly inhabited by the Spaniards and
Portugals, is almost contained in two Tropicks, excepting the two small
Villages of Saint Augustine and Helena in Florida, the Province of new Biscay
Northwards, and five Villages or Towns near the River of Plate, called Sancto
Sprinto, Saint Anna, the City of Ascension, Saint Fee and Fuvirnan, lies
half way betwixt the mouth of the river of Plate, and the Mine of Polossie;
and in the South Sea beyond the Tropic, in the Kingdom of Chelix, the Towns
or Villages of Coquenbo Persco, Saint Iago la impe villae del Lago. And
therefore, if the Spaniards have nothing to do, any further; either on the
Northward or to the Southward; what reason has he to forbid any Nation to
conquer or dwell there? But if he should admit you, I think it not convenient
that your Majesty should be so satisfied, for so should you do your self,
and other Christian Princes, great wrong: for his Towns and Castles are so
divided, and such masses of land and Kingdom betwixt them, which he has no
right, nor dare to enter as being duly considered by your Majesty, he ought
not to claim no more, then he ought to claim the Kingdom of France, because
his Fort of Graueling is of oneside, and South Arabia on the other, France
being in the midst between them; or to claim France, because his Frontiers in
Italy bound it on the one side, and Spain on the other: or to claim the Island
of the Venetians and the Turks in Levant; for that Cicilia and Sardinia, and a
few others belong to him, that stands in that Sea: Or claim all the Islands or
Shoares in Barbaric, for that he has a Castle or two in the Straits, and
another in Libia. These Countries they never lay claim to, because they are in
the eye of the Christian world; which would make us rise up in Arms against
them for their foolish arrogance, if they should pretend it: But in the
unknown parts, which have been familiar unto us; whose light by the iniquity
of the time, and troublesome wars in these parts, have to us been hidden;
although to the Ancient well known, where they began their foolerie. Betwixt
the Castle of Argiue in Libia, and the Island of Macoa in the river of Canton,
in the Kingdom of China, the foolish Portugals say all is theirs, when many a
hundred Kings (as absolute and powerful in regard of people, as any King in
these parts) dwells betwixt, and admit the Portugals by way of petition or
bribes, to dwell in some place by the Sea side, and trafique with them; neither
dare they lay claim to any Kingdom, but only to such Fortresses, Factories
and Villages, on the Sea side, as perforce and favor of the Island they are
admitted to dwell in, as most excellently appears by answer of Charles the
fifth, made unto the Ambassadors of Portugal, anno 1522, when they came to
require and beseech him, that his subjects the Spaniards, might not trade nor
commerce, as thon they did, in the conquest or navigation of the Portugals; who
after a most peremptory and noble answer of his part, told them he knew no
reason, neither would he suffer them, that his subjects should be prohibited
freely, to pass into any country where the hope of gain offers it self; and
that if the Portugals in the cause of their Trade, should do any violence to
any of his people, either in their persons or goods, he would be revenged
nearer home, meaning upon the Kingdom of Portugal. With which answer, at that
time, the Lucitans were forced to depart. Which answer, if it should please
your Majesty to return upon the Castilians themselves, at this time, I know
no reason how it can any way be bettered, having so good a president, as their
own King against the Portugals, upon the same subject. But for the Portugals,
where all their strength is seated, I mean upon the coast of Malubor, where
they have more Forts and Castles then in all India besides; the Kings do so
pen and lock them up in their Garrisons and Forts, as they can have nothing
the Country yields, but by their friendship procured by yearly bribe; As for
example, to the King of Cathaie, they pay an yearly tribute of 256000 Reis; to
the King of Pimenta -- Reis; to the mother of the King of Pimenta yearly 36000
Reis; to the King of Pargnan yearly 72000; to the King of Manfata yearly 72000
Reis; to Carto Babua, the proper name of a man of account upon the coast, an
yearly tribute of 42000 Reis; to the Teratates, which are brethren and Kings,
an yearly tribute of 72000 Reis. All which sums or tribute, are imposed upon
the King, and Custom of goods, brought from these parts. As for their credit
and reputation amongst these Heathens, it is so small, either for fear they
have of them, or love they bear to them, that, when we, and the Hollanders
pay no Custom for goods bought and sold there, they make the Portugals pay 30
per hundred, we going free before their faces, and they paying before ours.

By this, your Majesty may well perceive, what base account the Princes in
those parts make of them there; and yet these vainglorious woodcocks, will be
very angry with us, if we will not believe, when they say, that all the East
Indies is theirs, and they have conquered it. In self manner (most renowned
Sovereign) stand the Kings of the West Indies with the Spaniards, both in the
South sea, upon the Kingdom of Cheley, Reta, Peru, and others; as at this time
is apparent by the Kings of Cheley, who has within this few years beaten down
the Spaniard and won from them the Town of Imperial, wherein was wont to be
placed and maintained one of the greatest Garrisons of the South Sea; and not
only razed it to the ground, but likewise killed and driven the Castilians quite
from them. Even so, upon the East and North part of the Indies, both upon the
Coast of Brazil, with all the firm land upon the Indies from Parabia* to
Cartagene, the gulf of Vraba, the gulf of Mixico, and all along the Coast
of Bahana, even to their Forts in Florida, they are in continual wars with
the Kings and peoples of those lands. And surely under your Highness pardon, I
am confident of this opinion, that it has been a maine policy of the Kings of
Spain, for these many years, to keep us in continual wars one with another
in these parts; or if not, to encourage us himself; whereby being forced to
look to our home defenses, we might not have means to discover these his
invasions abroad, whereby he puts a mask before all the Princes eyes of
Europe. And therefore since he is now laid open, and by no Nation so much as
by your Majesty's subjects of this land; I hope, for the prevention of future
mischief against this State, as for other honorable respects, and prevailent
Reasons, in challenging of that which is your own; or at least as much yours
as his; you will not be unmindfull; which doubtless will not tend only to
the enlightening of many souls, which to this day have sat in the shadow of
death, but likewise lay a ground (as before said) for the safety and
preservation of your States, Glory, Person and Posterity, in despite of the
Spanish treacheries in the time to come, which otherwise by no means, by the
wit of mortal man can be prevented, as upon my life, by circumstances I will
make apparent.

But least this field of reasoning, whereinto I have walked, be too tedious
unto your Highness, I will briefly end; referring my self to Argument with
any one, against this mischievous and poisonous peace with Spain, which I do
see, cannot but prove very fatal to your Majesty and Commonwealth. And
though I be not called, yet considering I am your subject, I cannot forbear,
in respect of my great and loyal affection to your Majesty, the Prince, with
the rest of the noble Issue, and my native Country, I cannot but presume to
speak of such things, which I think now fit to be considered; especially at
this time: even as Mercarie Gataner, Chancellor of Spain, did against the
peace that was concluded betwixt Francis the first, and Charles the Emperor
his Master; for he seeing that the Emperor was disposed to make peace with the
said King, and to set him at liberty, and that the Viceroy of Naples, and all
other the Lords of the Council tended to the same; and although he knew, as I
do now, that his council would not be accepted, yet failed he not to speak
what he thought, but likewise refused, being great Lord Chancellor of Spain,
to sign the Articles, which he defended with most excellent reasons, which
reasons are well delivered, and with much gravity of speech by Quiccardine in
the oration of the said Grataner. But this event made it known, that the
council of Gataner was most noble, most just, and grounded as well upon the
high wisdom, as great zeal to the love and good of his Country. For as soon
as the King was at liberty, all the Spaniards wonderful hopes that they
expected to this peace, and all the French Kings great promises to them
vanished into smoke, according to the opinion of that worthy Gentleman. And I
know no reason (most noble Sovereign) that I being your subject, as he was
the King of Spaines, and loving you and my Country, as much as ever he did
his; and having a subject of the same quality, to fear, as he did them;
although I may well say, as much more danger to us by the Spaniards, if our
peace be not built upon a sure foundation, then it could any way be unto them
by the French. But to speak my opinion, make what Articles you will, and let
them be gilded over with the fairest show, either they, or those of their
Faction (if you have any about you) can devise; unless these four be granted
on their part to you, you can never make any sure peace with them; or at least
such a peace, as if he have the mind to break, he will have the advantage of
you. And Phillip Comines says, That for the many conclusions that he has
seen in his time in the affairs of State, that it were inexcusable folly for
a Prince, if he were able for to prevent it, to put himself under the power
of another. 1 That your subjects may have free access to the Indies, either to
traffic or plant, where the Spaniards have neither conquest, Seigniorie, nor
tribute. 2. That he do pull down all inquisition wheresoever your people
shall resort in all his Dominions, and that the Customs be reduced to an
ancient order. 3. That he shall never come with a main Army of Ships into these
Seas, under color of chasticing the Hollanders. 4. That it shall be as lawful
for your subjects to serve the States in wars against them, as it shall be to
serve them against the States; these things accorded, your peace may be safe,
otherwise not.

A short view taken of Great Britain, and Spain.
HIs Majesty now is of more power then any his Predecessors; First, because
our addition of Dominion Ireland, is reduced to a more absolute state of
obedience, and increase of reuinue then heretofore. The footing we had in
France, was rather a greatness of trouble to us, then of strength; it was
always in division; it held us always in continual flux of treasure and
blood, we never attempted in the Front, but that attempted us in the Rear;
which did both distract our Armies, and aggravate our charge: It is a Territory
so separate from us by nature, as we could not advantage upon it, either for
offenses or relief, without the access of difficulty and charge that a State
must undergo, when it runs the necessity of such an undertaking by sea,
where the war was bent upon a great Continent, a populous Nation, a
plentiful Country, and entire in its self, and that can be succored without
passing the Seas: In these things we found such disadvantage, as have been the
undoing of our Expeditions in steed of departure of this broken Dominion we had
in France, his Majesty has brought another whole Kingdom to England,
undevided from us in fear; from whence we have these benefits. The back door
that was open in the assistance of our enemies, both to offend us, and divert
our attemps from them, is now open to us, and his Majesty has the key of it,
it saves us the money and the men that we were forced to employ in a second
Army for the withstanding the invasion on that side: and not saues it us only,
but renders it, to bestow in undertakings of profit, which we were wont to
spend upon defenses. We have another valiant Nation to assist us, whose service
in Low Country wars has often, and always, given this testimony of their
affection and faithfulness, even in Queen Elizabeth's time; that in every
National quarrel between us and others (which has often happened, and very
remarkable betwixt us and the French) they have voluntarily and bravely sided
with us, making the danger common both to themselves and us; which was drawn
out but particularly against the English. The joining of Scotland has made us
an entire Island, which by nature is the best fortification, and the most
capable of all advantages of strength, that by Art can be added unto nature;
whereby we may at one and the same time be able both to undertake any action
abroad, and defend our selves at home, without either much danger, or great
cost. Secondly, by reason his Majesty has the neighborhood of the powerful
nation by sea, that now is in the world, at his devotion: a people by nature
more worthy of credit with us then any other: the use of whose neighborhood
our own histories will commend unto us, if we enquire of the ages past, even
then when they wanted that power and knowledge in their industry, which they
now have, as well in matters of peace as war, the memories of those times
will tell us, that we seldom undertook any great thing without them; insomuch
as our loss of France, may probably be in part imputed to the breach we
suffered in their friendship and though they were then of the same Religion
with England, as likewise now they are, yet the present condition that we do
both of us stand in, for point of Religion, does place us in an estate of
better assurance with them, then the conditions of those times did; for then
considering no main National separation, in the Church Religion was, but a
common bond unto them, and inclined them to particular side, where now it has
the motive in it to make defense with, against an opposite Church, in such a
Nation, as has drawn both of us into one and the same cause in quarrel, as
well of policy, as of Religion: And lastly, this Army is the best Millitary
School of the world, from whence our Land-services may be sufficiently
appointed, at least with Officers.

Now for the hearts of our people, and the wealth of our Kingdom (though it
may be some of his Majesty's ill affected subjects could be willing we should
distrust our own strength, when we receive these two points into our
consideration) yet for the first; the occasion; whereof they have derived from
our difference in Religion, I may say the wrath of God has been evident
against them, in the confusion of their plots (One thinks) it should be a
horror to them, for to think of attempting any farther that way; for those of
them that have made a covenant with blood, we stand not either in fear or
need of their numbers, but we may both spare and suppress them: And far be
it from me to think, that many men of those that hold no communion in the
Church with us, should give other Nations the cause to say, that in England are
the false men, that take up Gods weapons against him, and their own weapons
against themselves, in favor of a foreign Ambition, that makes the pretense
of Religion but a port hole to lay his Artillery out at, or his scaling ladder
to assault by. Now the second point touching the wealth of the Kingdom, if I
should call the Council of Spain it self to give judgment in the cause, I
should need no better sentence to condemn their opinions, who think the King
of Great Britain poor; their Master knows it well enough, he shall find it
otherwise, whenever he shall undertake to attempt us, or we them.

Now for Spain, his Majesty there, though accounted the greatest Monarch of
Christendom; yet his estate being enquired thoroughly, his root will be found
a great deal too narrow; for the top of his Dominions are so far in distance
asunder, as they cannot give relief time enough one to another upon an alarm;
which is the reason he is more powerful to assault then defend, and therefore
are compelled to have continual garrisons of that charge he is unable to
maintain: he has more to do with shipping then any other Prince, and yet
has few men at his devotion, but by extreme charge, and those of worst sorts;
his poverty has therefore appeared in the mutiny of his Low Country Army,
for want of pay, which was great cause of his ill success there; and I cannot
see how his estate can be much better now then it was. For though it be true,
that his charge is somewhat less; yet it is likewise true, that his Subsidies
in Spain be also diminished, as well in respect of his insupportablenesse; as
of indispositio^ of his Revenues out of the Indies deayed: And indeed but for
his Indies, he were the poorest Prince in Christendom. Now it serves the
better for the finding his weakness or strength, to enquire whether he be able
to stand upon the terms of defiance, and yet hold his Indies, I think not:
for his Majesty of Great Britain, joining with the States of the United
Provinces, is of power to (...) Armadoes, the one to block up Spain, the
other the Indies; the least success that may be hoped for out of this
enterprise, the cutting off his return would beggar him: the fear of this
project was the thing that stopped his Greatness to the United Provinces, when
he departed with his pretense of Soveraigntie to them: and that fear is an
Ague he is not yet cured of. This is a right design, and a great one, such a
one, as I with we had the treasure, and valiant blood of our Ancestors to
bestow upon; for the expense whereof we have nothing to show now, but two poor
Islands Iarsey and Garnsey. And to say the truth in that case; if all the Islands
or Lands that belong unto the Crown of England, were offered to his Majesty, I
should not give my advice to receive them, much less to conquer them. Now for
the disposition of the Low Country men, I assure my self there cannot be a
thing more desired, then they to join with his Majesty in any undertaking,
especially in this: for they are sorry they understood the King of Spaines
weakness so little in Queen Elizabeth's time, when her Majesty so much
affected their joining with her, and that now they know it, his Majesty being
greater in power, will yet suffer such an enemy to all Christian Princes,
chiefly to those of his Majesty's Religion, to creep into his bosom: For all
the greatness he has, he holds by the courtesy of his Majesty, (and to that
end Courts it;) he knows he were undone else. To conclude, I will refer some
of the Reasons, that persuade to the undertaking of his design; the policy of
Spain has trodden more bloody steps then any State of Christendom; look into
his Treaties, and his Negotiations of his Ministers abroad, you shall find as
much falsehood in them, as blood in the other: He never paid debt so truly, as
those he imposed in corrupting of the Ministers of other Princes: He holds
league with none, but to have nearer access to do him harm; a Match in
kindred shall not hinder it when he apprehends his advantage: He disturbes all
Christendom with his Alarums and Armadoes yearly; and yet does less hurt to
Insidels end Pirates then any, unless it be to get wherewithal to arm
himself the better against other Christian Princes; and he has an ambition to
the whole Empire of Christendom. These are motives wherein all Christian
Princes are interessed, so as with reason they cannot oppose the design, nor
will (I think the most of them) he has brought himself into such an hatred
with them. Let us, between his Majesty and the United Provinces, consider how
the particular causes of both Nations do importunate us both to the
undertaking thereof. Who has been so thirsty of our blood as Spain? And who
has spilled so much as he? Who has been so long our enemy? And who has
corrupted so many of our Nation as Spain? And that all with the help of gold,
which by reason of the neglect of this Design he does still enjoy, tempting
our weak ones, and our false ones withal. Would you find a Traitor on a
sudden? Balaams Ass will tell you where, at the Spanish Ambassadors door?
And when? when they come from Mass, and otherwise. When to? when they Match
with us. For his malice is so great, he cannot hide; nor will God (I hope)
suffer it. Yet let us examine in reason: now if we be so charitable as to
forget what is past, whether we may promise our selves assurance of his amity
for the time to come or not? Because peace with a true neighbor is a condition
to be embraced, nothing more certain then the contrary. We cannotpromise it his
ambition to the Empire, so long as he holds the Indies, shall never die. The
United Provinces is an Object, which though he has an eye to, yet he likes
not. What other thing soever we communicate with him in, we shall never be
assured of him (such is the nature of the Religion,) so long as we differ in
matter of faith, he knows very well the peril he stands in, if he be
attempted by his Majesty and the United Provinces. Consider what suggestions
these are to keep him thinking upon; and imagine then, what his own part will
prompt him to do when he sees a time for it. He then to the end hurts, that
he may not be prevented by the Enterprise. Now of the fitness and honor of
it, to be in that undertaking of his Majesty, who is the greatest Ilander in
Christendom, and therefore a Navy most proper to him: He is a Defender of the
Faith, as well in understanding, learning and godliness, as in title;
therefore in the planting of the true Church, their is a sacred work, that
even by office, as it were, belongs unto him: He is of a great liberal mind,
the Indies will afford him means to exercise it. These Considerations, and
the great multitude of his subjects, do seem to invite him: and in every
part, consideraby in the Design, we may find something to persuade us, that
it seems to be a kind of offer, both in Religion, Policy and Nature, preferred
unto his Majesty; as the Prince for maintaining of it.

FINIS.
