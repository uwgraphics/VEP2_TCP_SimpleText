INQVIT POETA.
AS the perfect prudent Philosophour
Dois put in writ as scie^tiue Doctor
In goldin style, and verse Poetical,
Sayand, all me^ into this life mortal
Is dressed but leis to leif in diverse kind
For ane ressoundois not gyde every mind.
And that throw heavenly Constellatiounis
Of the Planetis aspectis and complexiounis,
That in the heuin sa hie ar situat,
And fra other ar wonder altetat.
Quhilkis ar their four: incompt first Phlegmatike:
The secund is Sanguineane siclike:
The third clepit is Colerike suithlie:
The feird and last, is callit Melancholy,
Quhilkis of nature ar wonder different,
(...) under ane Regiment.
PHLEGMATICVS.
^or Flewme^s fat, slaw, richt slipperie and sweir*
(...) and drasie, to spit can not forbeir.
(...) ^ane is fat and fair with measure,
(...) and quhyte, and lufe and with pleasure,
(...) in blyithnes ay singand,
(...) ^genes, and with delight lauchand.
CHOLERICVS.
(...) ^^erik is crabit of nature:
(...) nobill of valor.
(...) ^matike: for it is hardy and fre,
Subtell and wise, stoutter and moir manly:
Bot small of face, of body Lecherous,
Quik of Ingyne, of Lordschip covetous.
MELANCHOLICVS.
The last and worst is callit Melancoly:
Sour, sorrowful, Inuious, cauld and dry:
Drowpand, dreidfull, gredie and untrue:
Heuie heidit, and feindill in game or glue*
Their four causis diverse variatiounis
In man's corpse, be sindrie Inclinatiounis
Of the Planeitis ring and under the heuin.
The quhilks ar in leill number their seuin.
Saturnus, Iuppiter, Mars, and the Sone,
Venus, Mercury, and last is the Moon.
Than nixt their seuin, syne is their the xij. Signs,
Quhilks in the heuin sa hie abone us regnes,
The first of them is callit Aquarius,
The Fische, the Ram, the Feird is callit Taurus:
Syne Gemini, the Crab, and the Lion:
The Virgin, Libra, and the Scorpion,
The elleuint to Name hecht Sagittarius:
The twelft and last, is callit Capricornus.
To their Planeitis complexiounis, and tha^
The Elementis greit strenth with them it.
Quhilks ar their four, Eird, Fire, Watter a^
And to four beistis often times we
The Air hes of the Aip comparion
For it is blyith, licht, merry, and wa^
As the Lion, the Fire is furious,
Wod, and cruel, rampand, and rig^^
The Watter is comparit to the ow^
Soft, blait, and blunt, of curag^
The eird it is comparit to the swyne,
Heuie, and sad, to sleip dois often Inclyne.
And of their four foirnamit Elementis,
Mannis complexioun takis may part Regimentis.
For he that hes of the Air the nature,
Is often muifand, licht, merry, with pleasure,
Wantoun and blyith, and ever geuin to sport,
And after drink desirous of comfort:
Iocund with Joy, and Iolyous to Iaip,
With mockis and mowis of nature as the Aip.
And he that hes the nature of the fire,
Is ever hait, in crabitnes, and Ire:
Bauld and birnand in rancour and malice,
And after drink cruel and kene he is:
To tuile geuin, to slauchter and occisioun,
And sa he is comparit to the Lyoun.
And he that hes of Watter the natoure,
Quhilk of the self is bot ane liquoure,
Is daft, and doyld, drasie with small effect,
Of evil or good he takis lytill rek:
And after drink, can nouther do nor say.
(...) Scheip compair him weill we may.
(...) ^at hes the nature of the eird,
(...) ^weir, lurkand, and not weill leird,
(...) ^iperie, with Nois and Mouth unclean
(...) ^pit, evil nurtourit between:
(...) ^cht bot sleip quhen he is fow:
(...) ^ompair him to the Sow.
(...) ^ounis, their Planetis and their Signs,
(...) ^tis, that sa abone us regnes,
(...) ^amang them self conmixt,
(...) have his complexioun firm fixed
On ane of them alluterlie, but ma.
Into them self they ar deuydit sa:
Bot of them all he is participant.
Howbeit that ane be ay predominant,
And of the laif in may part hes maistrie,
Quhairby the Corpse is gydit commounlie.
Thairfoir I say be my consideratioun,
Ilk man can not be of ane Inclinatioun:
Considdering the diverse difference,
Difficulteis, and daily resistance,
That first I schew of the four Complexiounis,
How they ar geuin to diverse affectiounis.
Syne of Planetis, and the diversity.
Of their nature and mutabilitie.
That fra other oftymes ar sa distant
Amang them self, and ever repugnant,
As the time geuis, and ever mair flowand,
Be proper course, and in their Spheir rolland.
Syne the xij. Signs, and of their conuersatioun,
How they ar wapt to diverse variatioun,
And puttis the Corpse often in ane mouand stair^^ (...)
Unstable ay of maneris alterait.
Forsum part ar fraward, and meik agane
Sumpart mansweit, sumpart betuix the (...)
Sumpart ar cauld, and sum agane ar ha^ (...)
Sumpart ar dry, and sum ar mitigait^
Sumpart ar dull, sum ar of quick In^
Sum like Sparhalkis, and sum ar sw^
Sum like Lyounis, and sum ar blai^.
Sum cursed, cankerit, and ay instur^
Sa sindrie men be greit diversity
Of complexiounis, and greit Ext^^^
Of conditiounis, and diverse alteratiounis,
Ar ofttymes geuin to sindrie Inclinatiounis.
As I have red of Kingis and Empreouris,
Duiks, Merques, Knichts, and Conquerouris.
For Romulus that foundit Romes Cietie,
Grauers in stane ever may lusit he.
Pompilius Numa his Successor,
He lufit Preistis, and held them in honor.
Paull Emylius may lufit Marynaris.
Octauius Augustus fairs playaris.
Cayus Caesar Goldsmythis lufit he.
Syne Scipio Capitanes, and Cheualrie.
Claudius Wryteris, Sylla Armoraris.
Syne Marius lufit Image good grauaris.
Vespasiane good Painteris lufit weill.
Titus his Sone on Menstrallis set his seill.
Domiciane his brother lufit ay
Corsbow makeris, and fulis for to play.
He brocht all Fulis that he could get to Rome:
Of auld wise men that Cietie he maid to me.
And sa Ilk man was geuin to diverse thocht.
That ane lufit, ane other held at nocht.
^owbeit their had all Rome in governing,
(...) ^ane had diverse thocht and gyding.
(...) ^nsaif be diverse complexioun,

(...) Ingyne hes geuin to saill the sea:

(...) ^karis, and sum ar geuin to Hunting:
(...) ^rhnes, and sum ar geuin to singing:
Sum michtie men, and geuin to Merchandice*
Sum Ockeraris, and geuin to Avarice:
Sum sempill men of their leill laubour leuis:
Sum ar agane verray stark commoun theuis.
Sum ar drunkardis, and sum ar geuin to dice:
Sum to vertew, and sum ar geuin to vice:
Sum ar sa proud, and sa ar put to hicht,
In lufe and favor of their fair Lady bricht.
Sum ar Wretches, and sum ar Worthy men:
Sum cankerit knaifis, that them self can not ken,
Sum to honor ever mair hie pretendis:
Sum leifis in mirth, and thankis GOD him sendis
Sum leifis in pride, and Prodigality:
Sum ar richt pure, and leuis in poverty.
Sum part ar geuin to put the Realm in cummer:
Sum richt sair feird to put ouir the deir Symmer:
Sum ar abasit to feid their barnis and Wyfis:
Sum hes Inuy that swa his Nichtbour thryfis:
Sum settis their pith, their puissance, and curage,
To hald their Realm and land out of thirlage.
Sum geuin to plant, and big in Policy:

Sum to falset geuis his felicity.
Sum geuin to good, and sum ar geuin

Sa be moving of the Planeitis and Sign
Diverse folkis ar geuin to diverse thingis
And I persaue weill be the poetis saw:
^lk conditioun to ilk man dois nocht draw*
Throw variance of signs celestial,
And other times, be Cause accidental.
For I my self be good experience,
Daily practik, and recent evidence,
Considderis weill, and dois perfytlie se,
Be my Ingyne, and Waik Capacite.
Their is money for sum craft are not abill,
it to other ar richt aggreabill.
Money ar put to diverse occupatioun,
That is contrair thait kind, and Inclinatioun,
And often causis complexioun for to vary.
And than they say it is false destenie:
And wyitis Fortoun of their misgouernance,
Quhilk their a win self dois throw their Ignorance*
For quha is borne underneath Saturnus,
That man can not be blyith nor Ryatus:
Lot fad and sour, in sturt, and in Malice,
And ay to do his fellow ane disprise.
(...) put this man to Sang Scule, or playing,
(...), sport, Dalians, or Dansing,
(...) incontrair his Complexioun,
(...) to fecht with ane Falcoun.
(...) borne underneath Iuppiter,

(...), full of humanity.
(...) not be his awin complexioun,
(...), nor have greit corruptioun,
Nor displesour, malice, nor cruelty,
Bot aye in Joy and merynes wald be.
Underneath Mars the God Army potent,
Quhat man is borne, can nocht be often pacient,
Bot aye angry, and ever battle boun:
Ferce as the fire, and fell as the lyoun,
This man to be geuin to dalians,
Is als contrair, as ane kow to gardans.
And sa forth euin of the seuin planetis all,
Ilk man takis his proper part partial:
Except he be in him self the moir wise,
Knawing he be geuin unto sic ane vice:
He may temper, and dant him self be skill,
And nocht to gif complexioun all the Will.
And sa oftimes be dantit refrenatioun,
A man may weill alter his Inclinatioun.
Bot woe allace empty purse dois greit skaith.
Alteris curage and the complexioun both.
it abone this we se daily expres,
Mannis maneris changis throw Idilnes:
For Idilnes is Mother Radycall,
Of all vicis, and font original.
Thocht the corpsly in ociositie,
it than the thocht can never idill be.
Bot ay mouand on veitew, or on vice,
Of guide, or evil findand sum new dew
And the may part to peruersitie geui^
Quhilk throw maistrie of Idilnes is di^
And siclyk als throw wickit compan^
Mannis maneris may oftymes chan^^
And for that cause, sic cumpanie to (...)
This wark and cuir I tuik upon my sell*
Quhen that I saw part of Nichtboutis about,
Rekles ryding in bed erandis thairout:
I covet nocht with them than for to be,
Sa I allane was left but company,
Think and better on this to muif my thocht,
Nor ride with them quhair their erand no docht.
Perauenture sum of them or they come hame,
For schrewit turnis (nocht causles) gat sum blame*
Had I lykit with them I micht have riddin,
Bot complexioun that quyte hes me forbiddin.
Sa I Infer a man may make his fortoun,
His destenie, his chance, and his conditioun:
Howbeit that he be geuin all unto vice,
He may refrane him self, and he be wise,
Throw dreid of god, throw wisdom, and laubour,
He may abstene fra all sic displesour.
Thairfoir to this laubour I gaif Ingyne,
And to cause me fra Idilnes declyne,
And me preserve fra wickit company:
(...) ane pen, and drew this Comedy.
(...) force outher to evil or good*
(...) compellit, that I couth nocht bot dude.
(...) on sic ane thing be far
(...) ^gyne, nor to Imagine war.
(...) all man is geuin thairto,
(...) do this, than war to do.
(...) that the same reidis, or^heitis,
(...) an, quhome to sic thing effeiris*
(...) ^ract heirefter follow and,
(...) of Venus the Galland,
(...) ^etis of it to be Reidar,
(...) found, that they be Correct*
And help to mend haltand verse and coullour,
And me excuse of this my small laubour.
For Gentilmen will tak it as they find:
For Rural folk sum terms will leif behind.
And I suppone, the ofter that e it reid,
e sall the better tak both the sense, and leid.
For anis reiding often time it garris Authouris
Incur reprufe be wrang Interpretouris.
And not of them, that sic Warkis can traduce,
Bot of them that of sic things hes na use,
Nor can compass sic thing, nor understand,
it to reprufe, they pertly tak on hand.
And neidfull is sic Wrytingis to correct,
Quhair good Reidaris findis any fault suspect.
Howbeit I know it neid Correctioun,
Thairfoir I pray that e will me pardoun:
For seir Doctouris, and wonder cunning Clerkis,
As Correctouris reprouit vtheris Warkis.
For Socrates was reprouit be Plato:
And Plato be Aristotell also.
Auerrois quhilk was ane greit Doctor,
Repreuit sait Aristotell and sour.
The greit Sulpice repreuit Scipio:
Varro Lelie: and Horace Ennio.
Thomas repreuit the Doctor Marinus
And Seneca be Aulus Gellius
Repreuit was: and money Doctourism
As did Doctor Laurentius de Valla.
Astratocles repreuit be Strabo:
And Hermagor repreuit be Cicero:
And Chesaco repreuit be Galene:
And Sanct Jerome repreuit Origene
Ruffine reprouit Jerome of his sawis:
Donate Ruffine reprouit of his Lawis:
And sen in them, and in their Warkis hes been
Sic correctioun, and greit reprufe between,
I may weill thole, and also standis content,
That this small Wark stand to the mercyment
Of Gentilmen, and bide at their subiectioun,
As they best think thairto to put correctioun.
Auctor alloquitur Librum.
NOW pas thy way is, thou barrant buik new breuit,
With beggit terms, and barbar tongue mischeuit:
And cast thy hude and hat outouir thy face:
At Ilk gentill upon thy kneis ask grace.
Excuse thy self of thy greit Ignorance,
And in their will put all thy ordinance.
For Gentilmen can richt weill thee considder.
For commoun folk will call the lawit and lidder.
Thy self present to Nobill men and good,
And fle the sect of Rural folk and rude.
That thou art Wrang, gif any will allege,
(...) ^ow thy self, and thairon thy heid pledge.
(...) sayis that thou art by Scripture,

Finit Prologus.
Heir beginnis ane Treatise callit the Court of VENUS, deuydit in four Buikis.
Newly compylit be IOHNE ROLLAND in Dalkeith. THE FIRST BVIK.
QVHEN Eolus out ouir their rokkis rang,
Be donk and daill, both Herb and tree he dang:
With passand pith, fra Polearthrang, tike come down,
Thringand with thrist out throw their woddis
And ceissit swyith the small foulis of their sa^g^
Causit them throw cauld make lamentatioun:
Quhilk cauld become be nature of sessoun:
For than Pisces with potent power sprang,
unto his Spheir, and tuik dominatioun.
(...) and Nonis war than all gone areir
(...) Freik quhilk we call Feuereir.
(...) ^arie was of his Trone exclude,
(...) ^d blawm, and haldin hait at weir:
(...) micht, and rolling in his Spheir,
(...) power of the Fische in the fiude,
(...) ^doun gart Aquarie be denude,
(...) ^s had the rewle now taken on steir
(...) course, that time as King he stude.
As I believe be richt calculatioun
Of Planet, Sign, or of the Moon motioun:
The wedder than is sumpart Pungitiue,
Quhen Pisces takis in his Spheir possessioun.
And Aquarie is put unto desertioun,
Be Fische in fiude swowming so exertiue,
Quhilk be greit pith and power possessiue,
That tydement crauis be his operatioun.
Quhat day this be e Auditouris discriue?
This samin day (gif I remember richt)
Is consuetude to all kin Foul of flicht,
Quha is vakand to cheis them tha^ ane maik.
Siclike it is to King Keyser, and Knicht:
Gif they sa be, cheis them ane bird sa bricht.
To pas the time, and ather solace make.
Bot I alone of sic curage did laik.
Pansing far mair how sone wald cum the nicht
Me to repois in my couche rest to tak.
Nevertheless it to rejoice my spreit,
Howbeit the day was sumpart set with weit:
I walkit forth on be ane valay side,
With Hat on heid, and Mittanis that was (...)
Maid to my ha^dis, and heich schone on m^
Under ane bus I sat me down to bide,
Me to preserve fra tempest of that tide.
And may part was my prayers to con^
Knokit on breist, and Conmundum I^
With orisounis, quhilkis are not ne^
Into this buik, at this time to declair:
I randerit ouir to GOD Omnipotent
In the mean time, into ane Gairth preclair
I saw compeir with fax and fassoun fair:
Two oung ou^gkeirs, perfect at all pointme^t:
In rich array, and honest ornament,
But company, bot them self solitair:
Nothing know and that I was their present.
I Iowkit than but dout quhen I them saw,
Behind the Bus (LORD) bot I liggic law.
Buir me richt coy, and this my cause, and quhy
To se gif they wald any nar me draw,
Or gif they had sum secreitis I micht know.
Or gif their was ma in their company.
I ^^w assure ane lang time did I ly.
That I was their forsooth they did misknaw
Howbeit I was to them ane secreit spy.
Their waillit weid, and stature to descriue,
I can not gif perfect affirmative.
Sa gay it was, sa galland for to se,
^wariant to sicht and transitiue.
^^quhile agane ferene and substantive,
^ite of fassoun maid, and sa properly,
(...) as I can after my Fantasy,
(...) ^ow schaw be my Intellectiue,

(...) not put of their eiris distinctioun:
(...) both fair, fat, pleasant of persoun:
(...) outh, as had been threttie eir.
(...) ^ike men be even proportioun,
(...) and stout, and both of ane fassoun.
Bot that the ane maid not sa merry cheir.
As his fellow, at that time was his feir.
Bot ins^un part sadder of conditioun,
Quhais countenance to me sa did appeir.
The glaidest man was gayest for to se.
With Scarlet cap, quhairin was Ostage three,
Behoung with gold, and all of color blede.
With trim Tergartis weill wrocht and properly
Circumferat with stonis subtallie.
In sign he was ane lufer traist and true.
His Spain cloik was of the Holme hew:
Betakinnit outh and Curiosity,
In Venus Bowr to eik both game and glue.
His Hugtoun was of Cra^mesie velvet.
With precious Perle, and gold was souer set,
With Saphyris blew, and Ryall Rubeis reid.
The silkin cordis was all about them plet
With Emerandis sa michtelte ouirfret,
Quhairon to luke, was rut^ of all remeid.
Howbeit ane man had been in point of deid:
Better comfort I traist he culd not get.
Of all malice to saif him fra the feid.
His dowblet was of goldin buird richt
All set about with the cleir Cristalline.
And in the dreist ane Charbukill sa e^
Quhilk did resplend as the stern M^
Cleir Apollo, Esperus, or Lucine, (...)
Befoir the day quhen they do first a (...)
With other stanis quhilk was done (...)
As birnand gold ouir all his body S^hi^^,
Both Turkas, Iasp, Emeraud, and Sapheir.
With Iacinth fine, and Topazion sa fair.
Or Adamant or Dyamant but compair:
With Rubie spackis ane greit number to se.
The Orient perle both precious and preclair,
Was vmdeset his body ouir all quhair.
Bot ane precellit the laif^fer in degree,
Quhais cleir refler blindit my sicht to se.
Because he was sa rank, and true luifar,
Weir it on breist, in sign of cheualrie.
His hois they war of the reid Skarlet maid,
With biurd of gold bordorit, and barrit braid
Begaryit all with sindrie silkis hew,
Of nedill wark richt richly all resplaid.
Of biggest bind as he thocht best to haid,
Or ladyis hand with nedill culd it sew.
All thortour drawin with taffateis of blew.
(...) veluot schon^ quhair with ye gait he traid,
^klit with gold and of the fassoun new.
(...) noble seem was on his sark of Rence,
(...) ^etent to any King or Prince:
(...) ^rk with all form of pietour,
(...) Hynd fast rinnaud for defense,
(...) rache with all expedience.
(...) sine fallow and on the stour,
(...) ^er Deir or Doggis was victour.
(...) was set with greit expense,
(...) gold quhilk was of greit valor
With girdill of gold, nane gayar on the grund,
With fassis fine nane fairer mycht be found.
Ane dicht dager, rycht plesand and perfect,
Tabletis of gold bayth quadrate als and round,
With Saphiris set so suttellie and sound,
Rattilland Cheneis about his hals so quhite,
Quhairon to luke, me thocht was greit delight.
With bag and belt, quhairin was money pund
Be apperance with Iowellis Infinite.
In the richt hand he bair ane pleasant flour,
Repleit all with Aromatike odor:
With Cinamome mixed, and mellifluat.
Quhilk was the sign he come of Venus Bour.
In the Car hand he bair of greit valor
Ane goldin Ball, the quhilk himself oblait
To Venus Queen, quhair his heart Radicait
Was on all time quhilk was his chief treasour
This was he cled in waill Morigerate.
The secund als was cled richt curious.
Bot not be far sa gay and glorious,
As was his feir, nor half so delectabill:
With hylair vult, and fassoun richt fam^
With Scarlet Cap appeirand bounte
His dowblet was of color variabill^
Sum time ailow, and other quhylis^
His coit and hois, of silk and claith (...)
His cloik was blak, and borderit wit^
Ane sword was belt about his (...)
With veluot cled: the Plumet gold (...)
With purse and belt, like to ane man of age.
Cheneis of gold persaif that culd I nane.
He was most like to be ane Phisitiane,
Be countenance, and clething wonder sage,
That in the self heart lakit, and curage:
And in the Net of wanhoip had been taken,
Quhilk causit him want both wealth, and wassallage.
In the richt hand ane bus of Rue he bair,
In sign he was betaucht all with despair,
In the car hand he bair ane bludie Heart,
Thirlit outthrow, richt scharplie, sad and sair.
With ane fell flane, quhilk was both braid and squair
Richt swa it did his awin body inwart
Quhilk was the cause of all his sour and smart,
Furthschew he was sum time ane just lufar:
Bot at that time, I traist he was conuart.
Thus was he cled, and with letteris of grew
In fine Scriptour, I saw it writtin new
^on his breist, his Name hecht Disperance.
^^lent about and their richt weill I knew
(...) his feir, als weill as hand culd sew:
(...) ^ame embrowd ye quhilk hecht Espera^ce

(...) ^lang time into that garth so grene,

(...) ^ungkeir moir wantounlie did trance

Sayand, Myneoun, quhairfoir do e sustene
Sic displesure in heart be countenance?
I ow befeik in sum part tak pastance,
And ow rejoice for our Lady, or Queen.
Quhat that scho be to do her sic plesance.
He answerit than, said good Schir, let alane
As for my self, Queen, nor lufe have I nane:
Bot as ese, a man heir solitair:
Fra me allone sic pastance is ouirgane.
To verteous work all clean I have me taken,
And refusis sic sport I ow declair:
For Fantasy it is, and nothing mair.
Quhairfoir brother for ow I make greit mane.
Gifand our hoip, quhair nocht is bot despart.
Despair (said he) thou art far deuiat
For to conform thy lufe to sic estait:
Gif thou sic hes (as weill may be perthance)
Or gif thy lust be ellis so saciat:
The to support sum other man creat,
That thy Lady will haid into pastance.
And gif thou pleis, I sall for thy plesance

Thairfoir thou sall tak lufe for n^
It is the rute of comfort I declair.
Quhairfoir brother, I the require of (...)
Erale thy Spreit, and make the mou^
Denude the of that darkness solitair
For I hald lufe ane A perse allane
And for her saik sum sang vencreane

Guerdoun (said he) of the I covet nocht:
For that nor sic to this place I not socht,
Bot pas the time, and tak sum hailsum air.
In sic behalf, als far as I have wrocht,

In future time, my purpois is na mair
Sic to persew, gif e pleis to repair
In lufes service, thairof nathing I rocht.
To our purpois in good time and not spair.
For I no way sic thing in heid dois tak.
That Law but leis in me lang time did lak:
And purposis it never to persew.
Thairfoir good Schir, gif e pleis for to make
For our Lady, or for our lufis saik,

In verteous werk scko beaud depriuate.
He said agane, quhill I may bruik my live,
Her from my heart I will never deprive.
Thy counsall is of na good discretioun,
Me to persuade with wrang enarratiue
Lufe to abstene, it is sa exaltiue.

And for to get sum Aduocat expert:

Or in sum part thairin make resistance,
Sone he him hyit without mair residence
Unto the seuin digne Doctouris in all (...)

Sone he furthschew his matter haill and all
Unto they seuin Rectouris Rethoricall:
How that Venus was set in his contrair.
And Esperance with him in feid did fall:
And how he was summound to Tribunal

And how that he promittit to cum their
Befoir her Judge Deput temporal,
Wnder all pane micht fallow or danger.
And quhen he had schawin his narratioun,
He Implorit with all delectatioun,

How he sold chaip without Tribulatioun,
Manifest schame, or mair Blasphematioun,
Not turnand him, nor his to prejudice.

Howbeit that we thairto nathing pertene,

Diverse gentillis will make to her homage,
And serve her with all courage fra the splen^
Quhen scho and they togidder may conuene
At her awin sport, scho dar lay counterplage.
Quhairfoir we think, that e haif preuit fulage
For to offend that Souerane, and most schene,
So eminent ane Lady of lineage.
Bot nottheles our counsall e sall haif
In closit writ, the quhilk e sall resaif.
And in good haist e sall pas on beliue

Quhair that they sit into their clean conclaue.
Deliver them this pretty small missiue:
In siclik Actis they ar frequentatiue,
And mair facill our matter will consaif,
Fra time that they heir our enarratiue.
Thus they conclude all seuin with ane consent
Deliuerit him the bill Incontinent
Renuncit them of their cure and counsall.
He tuke good nicht and on his wayis went.
Till he come to they Resis Redolent,
Ruit of regard, and fontane Musical,

Quhair all science hes daily Entreitment:

Quhair their Ladyis was in their chalmer clois

Their was Prudence: and their was Pulchritude
Their was of blis both the waill, and chois:
Their was the sop of science I suppois:

Their was worschip with wealth and valitude
Their was the Court ane man for to reiois:
Their was meiknes weil mixed with ma^suetude
Their was Grammar, and their was Rethorik
For Questionis their was Dialectik:
In argumentis full of subtilitie.
Pro and contra in terms of Logik:
In all this world to search their was nane sic.
For to decerne licht fra obscurity.
Their was Phisik: their was Astronomy,
Their was the mirth, and Mother of Musik:
Their was nurtour, their was Nobility.
For to conclude of this quhat wald e mair?
The seuin science compleitlie they war their,
With all kyn sort of mirth that micht be found
Their manerit Man's sa perfyit and preciair,
Enuirond all about with hailsum air.
Mair plesand place stude never on the grou^^
With all delitis sa greitlie did abound,
Of all palice it was the luminair,
That ever it was maid on Mappamond.
For to descriue their honest Ornament,
Their rich array, and their habillement:
My feeble wit standis in ecstasy,
So been, so big, and so Auripotent,
So ground michtie it was, and precellent:
It dullis far my small capacity.
Thairfoir I most at this time let it be.
Bot e sall wit their was na thing absent
Of gold, nor silk, that ganit sic cumpanie.
In their Chalmer they war all singand nine,
And als playand on Harp, and Cymbalyne.
Bot for to heir that sound Melodious,

Angellis of Heuin, it was sa amorous:
So small, so clean, so sweit, so curious,
So replenissed with the cleir Chrystalline:
Sa weill digest, benign, and bewteous.
Quhen Desperance their nine did heir, and se
Percust he was into perplexity:
Quhidder gif he sold enter their, or no.
GOD gif it war my fortoun than, said he,

Als sone as they the small missiue did reid.
Without mair baid they wald not superseid.
And said, good Schir, is our name Despera^ce?
This present writ sa manifestis our deid,
That e have seruit greit magrie to our meid,
For presumptioun, and eik vltrequedance
To Venus done be our greit arrogance.
Quhairfoir we can na farthermair proceid
In our support, bot stand unto our chance.
To Intermell we will not with sic thing:
For we Intend on other machyning,

As in Psaltrie, in Luit, and Harp playing,

In congrew veirse, and to keip accidence
In sic effairis we have experience,
Bot be no way in Venus disprysing:

They ar richt like to turn their fais to tene.

And so they reid the small missiue anon.
And syne begouth the sentence to expone.
Ane said of them quhilk was may Ancient.
Brether, this case concernis us Ilkone.
Fra that they knew that he was Venus fone
All their atanis they grew in matilent:
Sayand, quad knaif thou was ouir negligent
Of Queen Venus sic langage to propone:
Thou seruis weill on Rakkis to be rent.
Ane other syne quhilk was ane crabbit squire
Kest down his browis quhair he sat in his chyre
On Desperante, sayand, falls Renigate,
Quhat causit the be sa peirt for to delyre

Or in that case quha the authorizate?

And bet thy banis both body, bowk, and lyre:

Quhen Desperance their wordis outrageous
Hard said to him, he was sa dolorous,
All for frayitnes he fell in ecstasy:
Quhill the laif of they Chiftaines Cheualrous
Raisit him agane, schawing them ge^^arious
Sayand, he should not their thoill villainy.
It was na laud, nor it Humanity,
On sic ane wicht to schaw them villainous,
Nor to molest sic ane with cruelty.

To Venus done be his detractioun,
We will him schaw sum thingis terribill

That he nor nane of his conditioun,
Of Venus speik sic wordis horribill.
Sa they him rasit on ground quhair he lay still
Sayand, cursed knaif thou sall haif afflictioun
As thou did serve, rise, and resaif thy bill.
So up he raise into ane stakkerand stait,
As he had been fra wit exanimat.
Askand yame grace, trimbla^d for feir did quaik
Sum said he seruit for to be cruciat,
That he micht be exempill scelerat
Till all vtheris, that siclik crimes wald make
Sum said, he seruit for to hing on ane Aik.

Or rostit quik, and all for Venus saik.

And likit we to do to the our det,

In all good haist thou hence the fra this et,
And seik anon to the ten Sibillais.

Throw wilderness, quhair he na luging saw:
Throw mos and mire and money hie Montane
Till he come to mont Caucasus of snaw.
Quhilk Montane is most heich in Scithia:
Into the eist tendand fra India,
Unto the north, and all excandidate
With snawis fell (as Albertus dois say)
Upon that hill na nicht is seen bot day,
Except four houris the sone is obscurate.
Their Desperance on force all fatigate:

The mont with snaw was all sa condensat.
And swa he baid throw hap and destenie
Upon that hill both hiddeous was and hie,

And to haif had their sum tranquillity,
After trawell his mind to mollify.

Till Morpheus that carll subtell and sle,
All his five wittis fra him hes reft anon.
Their sleipit he within ane littill stound

For none defalt to Incur sic vnrufe,

And me denuid of this cursed cummerance.
And govern me to sum good souenance:
For my wanrest I wald thou saw remeid.

Quhilk scho presentit to Judge Imperial,
That time callit the Empriour Tarquine:
For quhilk scho askit twelf scoir of Phillippis sine.
He thocht the price was ouir substanciall
He lewch, and wald not to her will Incline.
Incontinent in presence of the King.
Three of the buikis in the fyir scho did sung.
At him agane als mekill scho did Inquyre,
Gif he wald gif for the ser the same thing.
And he said nay: sine other three did scho bring
Of the same buikis: combust them in the fire
Her greit constance than the King did adu^^re.
The last three buikis: he tuik in his kepin^
And gaif the sow ne that scho did first de^
Quhilk binkis in Rome was keipit richt straitli^
Be fiftene men best of the haill cietie,
Ordanit thairto be all the haill counsall,
In time of weir or of mortality:
Quhen their appeirit any adversity,
Greit tribulance, or famine accidentaill.
Their buikis was red sic times in special,
For of all dowttis they wald them certify,
Quhidder they wald haif troubill, or preuaill.
Than Desperance deliuerit his missine
Unto their ten, so sweit and scientiue.
Kneling full law, as weill him culd effeir.
Sine to counsall they passit all beliue.
Considderit weill the sentence was pensive:
All in ane voce they said to him oungkeir:
Vit nor visdome in ow dois not appeir.
And for sentence we gif diffinitiue:
Do for our self, support e get nane heir.
For quhy e haif ane greit falt perpetrat,
With corrupt thocht, and mind Inimoderat,
To Queen Venus, and her Ladyis so schene,
As in this bill it is Intitulat.
And fra her Court we are not depriuat.
Quhairfoir on force e man fra us abstene.
^^^id, Ladyis most secreit and serene:
(...) ^ourtesie e wald me wis sum gait,
(...) hair e believe I may kindness obtene.
^ay said good schir surely we know richt few
^r part will tak to help ow or reskew
(...) case into Venus contrair.
Bot wald e to the three fatales persew,
Quhair yat they duel and e their Ma^siou^ knew
Perauenture they wald ow leis of cair,
And pair ow sum part of our greit despair,
He said Ladyis, God ow foreild, adieu:
Bruik I my life, in faith I salbe their,
This he them left, and forder can proceid:
Richt stomakat in heart ay haiffand dreid:
Be money way both ewill and anterous:
With beidis in hand crosand, and sayand creid:
Daglit in weit richt claggit was his weid,
In storms fell and wedder contagious,
In frost and snaw, and blastis busteous.
Quhill at the last, he restit in ane meid,
Quhair odor was abundant precious:
And was ourgrowin with all kin kind of flour
Richt michtie spice it was of greit valor.
He sat ane quhyll with ane sad countinance,
Ourset he was with trawell and law vour.
Bot of phoebus the pleasant resplendour
Refreschit him fra part of displesance.
Quhill at the last he blent about of chance.
And sa on case he saw ane proper tour:
Quhair their three sisteris did sit in daliaure.
He approchit in haist on to that hald:
All for to se the fassoun and behald
That proper place sa weill edificate:
Wallit dowble about for the wedder and ca^
Their was na force of man micht gar it f^
With subtle wark it was sa roborat.
Properly alswa with kirnalis weill quadrat.
For feir of life dar I not be so bald
To enterheir (quod he) I am to blait.
Than enterit he, and forward come bedene.
Till he come quhair their sisteris sat, so schene
In ane conclaus all maid of Crystal cleir:
Inclusit they war vneith they micht be seen.
The glass blindit sa far his corporal ene,
To luikon them few men micht perseueir.
Bot it he saw within that circuleir.
How their three did all the world circumuene,
With their sle craft, and quent cunning perqueir
Twyn and the threid with sic continuance,
Hung fra the heuin down fra the greit balance,
Smaller than silk, almaist micht not be kend
Quhairon the world did hing be apperance.
Part preissand up with sa greit arrogance,
Unto the heicht ever they did pretend.
Bot quhen sic folk abone their stair tean^ee^^
Their sisteris three but any resistance.
Did cut the threid, and gart them sone descend.
Vtheris agane was sa humbill in thocht,
To clim the threid but leif they craifit nocht.
Me^ksie their folkis ascend in their degree.
Vtheris agane quhilk to the heicht was brocht
^as sa elate, and their mind ay in flocht,
^uld not their stait hald with stabilite.
^his tender threid full of debilite,
Sic orgw^^^ (...) suffer it not docht:
Sa it did brek, and they to end can fle.
Sancta Marie than faid Desperance.
Into this world quhat is my fatal chance?
Qu^^odir gif I dar auter on one thre^d.
I se this world wappit with variance.
And I am not ane wicht of Ignorance:
To hald good grappis had I not ^^kill neid?
Clym Iouir hie (that I do GOD forbeid)
I brek my neck and their tak me mischance.
To clym one Cord faith I will superseid.
So their anon he fell into despair.
Betaucht with sturt, and durst not enfer their,
All siupifate, wist not quhat to have done.
And for faintnes he was sa sad and fair:
Befoir his Ene he saw his exemplair:
To sit sicker, or ellis to fall richt sone.
it ane small spark held up his heart above.
I have (quod he) put by sa greit danger:
Anis fall I fall, or ellis pas to one trone.
Chan he but baid into their sicht did go.
His small missiue belyue he gaif him fro,
Unto their three, kneillnig down to the eird:
Quhilk for to Name the first is callit Clothe*
Lachesis uirt: and syne after their two,
Atropos third: their three sa weill ar leird.
To Ilk man geuis in world his fatal wen
Quhidder it be to weill wappit or woe.
None leuand spairis, nor for nane ar effeirt
They red his bill, and consauit the sense.
And thocht richt weill that he had done offense.
Bad clym the threid, stand to his destenie.
Gif he was clean, their schaw his Innocence.
To clym past he with all benevolence.
Skant was he up, quhen at the eird was he:
He laikit Spreitis him self to fortifis.
(Quod they) this is ane matter of conscience,
To wirk this wicht any adversity.
This threid to clym he dow be na kin wise:
Sa full he is repleit of Cowardice.
Bot we will gif to him his weird fatal.
Atropos said, he sall thole ane Assyse,
And of Venus he wald get greit disprise.
Lachesis said, thou salbe her Vassal:
And befoir her thou sall stand in bactall.
Then quod Clotho, he sall bruik Benefice
Of Venus Court, and nathing sall him aill.
This they conclude all three with ane consent
Bot he thairof had na experiment.
For throw the fall he was in Frenzy.
it up he raise richt heuie and dolent.
His bill they gif to him Incontinent.
Bad him pas hyne, and seik other supple:
For his default help their nane get wald he.
(...) they had geuin ane sentence competent,
(...) ane twice, for feid or favor micht be.
(...) ^od he Ladies, sen e have schawin me sa:
(...) ow tell quhat gait sall I now ga.
They bad him pas with all velocite.
To the Gratis quhilks are not far heirfra
The first of them is namit Aglia:
The secund he^hrto Name Euphtosina:
Pasithia the third callit trewlie:
With their mother her Name Euonia.
Perchance of them thou will get sum supply.
He tuik good nicht ar their weird sisteris than:
Richt sad in heart, and Venus ay did ban,
For pure despite and greit melancholy:
Than come he to ane reuer richt richly ran:
In ane small bair the ferr^e oui^ he wan.
Bot I knew not gif he payit fraucht or fie.
Bot as I ges superexspendit was he.
Thairfoir surely but gyid of any man,
He come quhair that their graces sat all three.
In ane palice weill wrocht with all Ingine:
With quhat kin wark I can not weill diffine.
Of glitterand gold they fat all in ane chyir.
Circundat all with the cleir Christalline:
And vthers stanis quhilks precious war and fine
Ilk ane in hand ane Reill quhilk did not tyir,
To reill their hankis so small of reid gold wyir
Fra Phoebus raise to the hour vespertine*
Ay gadderand grace all man for to Inspyir.
Their Reillis all war maid of Euir ban
Weill souer set with diverse crystal stane.
On the first reill was kernit Cla^^ude:
And on the nixt was keruit for certane,
With letter is fine Blithnes ay to remane:
On the third reill of life the Longitude,
I saw keruit gif I weill vnderstuid,
Their three giftis their graces gaif in plane,
Quha their service soucht weill with mansuetude.
Of their cleithing or Ornament to tell,
Ane thousand times my wit it dois excel:
Sa wonder rich it was and curious.
Heirfoir thairwith I will not Intermell.
Ilkane most lik they war to ane Angel,
Be apperance als bricht as fair Phoebus:
Of fassoun fair, facound, and fauorous.
Quod Desperance, faith I feill be my sell,
Heir sall I get sum guerdoun gracious.
Inward he come law kneland on his kne:
His small missiue deliuerit to them three:
Lamentand sair with ane hewie regrait,
Askand at them for luif and cherite,
They wald him make sum aid, help, or supple:
Or his so^row in sum part suffocat:
Of good counsall he was richt desolate,
Sa sair he was vexed with aduersite:
He was bot deid without they maid debait.
Their Ladeis hard his sair lamentatioun:
They red the bill, and saw the narratioun.
^icht discontent they war in till ane part,
that he had put sa greit blasphematioun.
(...) Queen Venus be corrupt relatioun.
(...) said forsooth they culd be na kin art
Amang them all, her Court cast or convert,
Be no Ingine nor Imaginatioun:
Bot tak his chance, and than blak was his heart.
With austeir voce he cryit loud and hie,
O Ladeis sweit of me puir haif piety:
Ane drop of grace, sen graces is our Name,
e waid wouchsaif of our benignity,
For to distill, and lat fall heir on me.
Sen I ow three sa far hes socht fra hame,

Bot me support in this necessity:
Or ellis for ay mirth clenlie I quitelame.
They hard his playnt it was so pieteous,
And richt laith was for to displeis Venus.
They said good schir, tak this for na excuse,
Because we se ow dressed sa dolorous:
Our guide counsall it e sall haif of us,
Sa with visdome quietly e it use.
Their is ane Nymph, we traist e sall her ruse,
Quhilk hecht Vesta, both wys and verteous,
We wait scho will our matter not refuse.
For quhy Venus, and scho is not at ane.
All Venus Court scho haldis at disdane.
Scho and venus can never weill agree,
Howbeit they be contemporan^ane.
Venus her warkis vsis venereane:
And Vestais warkis ar of virginity,
Fulfillit with faith, and eik facunditie.
Greit diuisioun ar often betuix them twan^
And as we traist, sendill at unite.
Quod he Ladeis, on kneis a thousand sis
I thank ow all of our counsall sa wis.

And plesit ow sum gyid me to deuis,
That be the way I may eschew dispris,
Till I cum to that merciefull Maistres.
Sone call they Hoip, their seruand as I ges,
Send her with him at that time in service,
Quhill he come to Dame Vesta the Gods.
Sa hoip and he allone com forth the way.
Quod he, sister of ane thing I ow pray:
Quhat is our office with one Ladeis gent:
Ane messinger said scho, into verray
Their erandis gais, both nicht and als be day
Quhom to that they their giftis will present,

And gifis confort to all men ar in fray,
As they command be their aduisement.
My awin sister sumtime I send the till,
Arthemesia, quhen thou lay on the hill
Of Caucasus, drerie and woe begone.
Quhen thou culd not do thing, bot yair lay still
And knew not quhidder for to ga^g richt or will
Quhen thou sleipit upon the Merbill stone.

And thankis ow of our greit gentilnes
That e me schew, quhen I was in distres:
Beseikand ow e wald me it supple:
Sen e on me befoir kyde sic kindness.
Now help to put my heart fra heuines:
That I Incur not the ferocitie
Of Venus Court, nor of her cumpanie.
(Quod scho) heir lyis with Vesta all expres
Thy weill. and woe: as scho will, sa will be.
Bot I sall do all that I can or may,
To put thy matter to ane sicker way,
Be word and deid as thou sall se and heir.
Bot I believe that this Lady Vesta:
Scho will the help, and gyid thy matter sa,
Thou sall not neid of thy actioun to feir.
And of the Reill Euphrosine dois beir,
Ane threid of gold to the I sall forga,
Quhairon is keruit blithnes, and good cheir.
He said, Lady, of quhat conditioun
Is Dame Vesta, or quhat fruitioun,
I pray ow schaw, and our good will sa be?
Scho said Vesta is full of discretioun,
Haldand Venus ever in abusioun:
And als is callit Gods of Chaistitie.
In quhais Tempill ar ser virginis surelis,
Ever keipand ane fyir fra extinctioun:
In sign of pure and clean virginity.
And gif this fyir happinis to de in case:
The Archebischop of her Tempill and pla
Dois punis them richt aufteirlie and sai^
Or gif any happinnis ane rakles race.
As be corrupt: to that falt is na grace.
Bot eirdit quik, to the laif examplair.
Thairfoir Venus scho hes ay in contrair.
And be this way within ane litill space,
I traist thou sall eschaip of all danger.
In till her Court (quod he) is their na ma.
Bot sex Ladeis how is scho seruit swa?
Scho said, few ma couettis her company.
For Ladeis had rather be Vestais fa,
Nor crab Venus, or it her Court forga:
For wantones, and wealth of Venerie,
In Venus Court their is ay thousandis three,
Aganis ane that dwellis with Vesta:
Sic hap they haif with her to multiply.
(Quod he) Madame I pray ow to me tell
Of the Ladeis that with Vesta dois dwell:
Quhat is the Names or we forder proceid?
Scho said the first Lady of her counsall:
Is Purity of all vertew the well.
The nixt Measure: the third is callit Dreid:
Abstinence fourt (gif I can richt them reid)
Chaistitie fyft dois till Venus rebel:
Deuotioun saxt, ane honest Nymph at neid.
He thankit her as weill him could effeir,
(...) talking and of her merry cheir:
(...) that they come to the plesand Palice,
(...) Dame Vesta sat in her Circuleir.
(...) plesa^d Man's as he thocht had na pei^
Bot gif it had been eirdlie Paradise.
With stark draw brig weil forcit with fortalice,
That wit nor strenth of na man sold cum neir,
Them to perswaid with violence, or vice.
Bot the sweit smell, and the suaue odor
Was seminate about that blisfull tour,
Sa weill sawrit, and viuificatiue,
Micht have ransonit ane King, or Empriour.
The palice als it kest sic resplendour,
With strenthis stark, and turettis defensive.
Quhen they did to that Royal port arrive:
On the walheid was gretest Garaitour,
Dame Chaistitie, in armis most active.
Cry and on hie, ga far about the wall:
Or in all haist, e say how they ow call.
Desperance said, I am ane uncouth Knicht,
Cum fra far landis, and erandis hes special
To Dame Vesta, and her court virginal:
Wald haif Ingres at ow Nimphs, and I micht
For I am put to wanrest and wuricht.
Wald god e knew my greit lawbouris penal.
Go hine (quod scho) thou cu^is not heir yis nicht

Quhilk our maistres and plesit sold resau^
Quhom fra (said scho) fra seuin seges wisest
And fra the nine Muisis most suaue:
The Noblis nine, richt grievous men an^
The ten Sibillis: and the fatallis professed:
The graces three on ground most gudliest
(Quod scho) I trow thou be sum ka^kerit knaif
Cum fra Venus, with fraud us to molest.
Thairfoir pas hine, thou gettis not heir Ingres
I ken the weill ga do thy business
Remane thou lang dowtles thou sall repent.
Allace said he to Hoip now speik Maistres,
Unto one Nymph that we may haif entres:
Cause her to be in speiche mair pacient.
Schaw her that e our self is heir present.
GOD forbid that her Queen war sa reuthles,
As scho, than all war tint that by did went.
Than Lady Hoip did cry on Chaistitie:
Said sister deir oppin our port to me.
(Quod Chaistitie) quha is that that now cryis*
It is I hoip, cum fra the graces three:
And I have brocht ane in my cumpanie.
And to Vesta his tra^d may part lyis
Than Chaistitie or scho wald mair aduyis.
Ports and draw briggs, that lockit was richt sle
Scho did vnlok, and eik them couth appryis.
Than for to se, and to behald that mance,
In mappamond the maik is not perchance.
^tak on me that Preter Ihoms queir
(...) not so rich vnibeset with plesante,
(...) all that place with ^^rnist gold did glance.

(...) ^ubie speekis and diamour most deir.
(...) ^urelie dressed with sic daliance:
(...) this world I transt it had no peir.
And so beliue in com that Lady gent.
(Quod Chaistitie) sister in weranient
I did not know, this was e at our port.
And sense is, ourself is heir present,
That e he welcum forsooth is my intent,
And ow intreit into all biggest sort,
With all plesouris guide service, and confort.
Bot weill e know, their is na men frequent
To enter heir, their plege is sudand mort:
Than Lady Hoip said to dame Chaistities
This man I tak in on my honesty:
For Dame Vesta will wichesafe he be heir.
And als I haif euin fra the graces three,
Ane fre Conduct to suffice him and me.
That be the way na strangeris sold us steir.
Thairfoir sister of this man tak na feir
Pas in scho said as e will fa salbe,
For weill I wait e com not us to deir.
Than to behald they Nimphis of Nurtour
As they war set sa weill into ordour,
Sa weil beseue and als sa virgin lik
Their Iuminat Iampis of great valor
Keipand them ap into perfect ardour:
Or ellis (...) in number trumphatik
Their Ornamen it was Ecclesiastik,
Of gold and silk it had sic resplendour^
That to my sicht it was almaist mistik^
Sine Lady ^oip scho past in wit^
Till that scho come to Dame Vestai^*
Did their present with all credence her squire,
He kneiling law with greit benevolence:
Randering Vesta honor and reverence
With the missiue that saoft did him myir.
Quha send this bill at him scho did Inquire
The seuin seges (he said) of sapience
Did dyt that bill, sen e to speir desyir.
Sone scho it red, and consauit the text.
I traist (quod scho) that Venus hes the vexed:
For be this writ the same I do persaif.
He said (Madame) richt sair scho hes me flext:
And to her Court siclik I am annexed
Wnder all pane. and refuge nane I haif,
Without our grace with su^ salve wald me saif.
Scho tuik him up: and thryis scho him amplext
Sayand, quhat help I can thou sall not craif.
For ay the mair that thou anger Venus,
And all her Court sa wantoun and vicious:
Suithlie to me thou art mair acceptabill:
The mair welcum Iocund and eik Joyous.
Thy Actis pensit the far mair precious,
And to my Court the mair agreabill.
Quhat is the cause scho haldis the execrabill?
Madame (said he) few actis Injurious
I perpetrate, forsooth this is na fabill.
Scho dois allege Madame, and not causles,
Wordis of Iuiure I said in reklesnes:
that scho and all her Court was richt horine,
Venuid of good, repleit with bitterness:
Bandownit with baill, and full of brukilnes,
With diverse faltis and wordis Intoritiue,
Quhilk to Venus was all tald on beliue:
In ma^alent at me scho did Incres.
Heir now Madame to ow I do me Schriue.
And I haif been for to fang sum defense,
First at the seuin seages of Sapience,
For to haif had their counsall and doctrine:
Quhilk wrai^ that bill all seuin with pair prudence:
And bad me pak with all expedience,
Quhill that I come unto the Musis nine.
Their gat I not, bot bad me sone pas hine,
Unto the nine Nobillis of excellence.
Quhair I gat not be* ansueir detestine.
They bad me pas without in residence,
Unto the ten Sibillais of science.
Fair wordis their I gat of small effect.
Sone than me bad into all haist me hence.
To the three Fatallis of experience.
And their I come: and na evil did suspeck.
They bad me clim of that I tuik na rek.
And so beliue throw my awin necligence:
I clam ane threid, almaist had brokin my nek.
And sa I gat nocht of their Fatallis three:
Bot bad me pas, stand to my destenie.
And s^ik succor into sink other place:
They wald not tak on them audacitie,
For to I^tur Venus ferocitie
They bad me pas to pe three Nimphis of grace
Swyith their I come, and schew yame all ye case
They said forsooth they culd me not supple.
And so with them I taryit bot schort space.
And now Madame, to ow most gracious
Gay on the ground: and I most dolorous
Wicht in this world, I becum on my kne:
Faint, fatigat with, travel troubillous:
Ourset with snaw, and blastis busteous,
With sorrow slane, bot gif our grace supple.
(Quod scho) be blyith, and I sall warrant the
All thy Actioun in presence of Venus
I sall debait, and tak it upon me.
Gif he was blyith, it neidis not to speir.
Ane thousand s^^s intill his best maneir,
He tha^kis, that Nymph, and all her Court bedene.
Than said Dame hoip with a full merry cheir:
Adieu guide Schir pleis e now to byid heir.
He sayis Lady, quhill I may life sustene,
My piri^ se^uice ^e sall (...) obtene,
With cordial luif as it can best effeir.
Sa tuik good nicht with curage fra the spleen
And sa Dame hoip is departit Anon,
And to the three graces agane is gone.
Than said Vesta unto her Nimphis all,
Sen that this squire is happinnit Venus fone:
And heir he seikis supple with drerie move:
Befoir him we will stand in strange battle,
And him defend fra carris Criminal.
that Venus hes agane him to propone
Or Rhamnusia in her sait Tribunal.
This Vestal Court quhilk ay was traist and tre^^
Said in ane voce, this Knicht we will reskew,
With all power and prepotent puissance:
Howbeit we be in number ferlie few.
In Just quarrel we sex ar ^win anew:

With hand we may not make her resistance:
Bot with our tongue we sall her sa argew:

This they concluid all sex with ane consent,
Of their answer Dame Vesta was content.
And so beliue kest them to keip the day:
Their proud palphrais was grathit Inco^tine^t,
In glansand geir and best abillement:
At ilk bridill ane proper Alakay,

For gif sa fall in faith I hald the fey.
Pray fast to GOD sum succor to the send.
Now wit thy self, thou Nald Venus obep.
Incontinent they callit the criminal,
With ane twme scheith set him on the Pannall

And all her Court pertlie thou did contend.

He said, Lady, sen Justice Clerk e ar

With patience sen I am solitar:
That I may these to me ane forspeikar,
Or ma in neid to be ruin Aduocat
For I in law am not weill litterat.
It was grantit: Vesta stuid at the bar
He callit her scho come in her estait,
With her sex Ladeis gangand at her bak,
Quhite as the snaw that ever lay in slak.
Quod Desperance Madame plesit our grace.

And quhat e do heir in I stand (...):

Quod Fre^mitnes* that Clerk was to Justice
Of this dittay grant e ocht, or denyis?
Vesta answerit with maneris richt constant
That the cleneman thoill heir no prejudice,
Reid it agane, we may thairwith adu^is:
For I thairof as it am Ignorant.
And gif it be by ressoun ocht distant
To find the richt lac it pas to assyis,
Howbeit of them sum part be fluctuant,
And for to be on the assyis vnabill,
To the ane part they ar our fauorabill:
To the ni^t part agane our odious.
Quhairfoir I think part of them refatabill
Of the assyis and other is acceptabill
Into than steid, quhilkis armair Famous,
And of conscience ar far mair scrupulous,
For to eschew fra all doutis dampnabill:
And sa the richt salbe Illuminous.
Quod Rhamnusia quhilk was Judge deputate

Sa e ran preif upon them falt or feid,
Or any raus ressonabill of pleid.
The other part gif they fortificat
In our contra^ie, be counsel, help, or reid.

Bot their is part mair wantoun and vicious
Than vtheris ar, quhilk I desire to set
Of the assyis for causis cautelous
That I can preif on them notorious,
Sa e Madame with ressoun do our det.
Quod Rhamnusia, tha^ Name them forth but let
Be their any by ordour orguellous,
We sall them change, and vtheris for them get.
Than. Vesta said, Madame but any mair,
Think e it speidfall Venus Mother be their*
To quhat effect traist e, or to quhat fine?
Considerand Venus is in my contrair.
And (...) that staw her Fatheris hair
For Venus saik, and dwellis with her senfine.
And Queen Phillis, quhilk sufferit mekill pine
For Venus saik, with greit sorrow and cair:
As for their three faithlie I will decline.
^dea als scho causit ane strange Knicht

And herie him of all his gold and geir:
Sine with the same stall away in the nicht.
Unto the schip togidder tuik their flicht,
Left kin and kith, and followit ane stranger:
And slew her awin brother that was sa deir,
Because scho saw her Father cum in sicht:
All this scho did for Venus saik but weir.
Als Dalida pertlie scho tuik on hand,
For Venus saik betray her awin husband,
Quhilk Samson was, and put hi^^ to his fais,

Tuik her awin sone of spowsage in the band,
For Venus saik (as the history sayis),
Deianira for Venus saik kest wayis
Her lufe distroy, cause ane other did stand
Mair in her lufe, than Hercules all his dayis.
The nymph Progne the heid scho did of smite
Fra her awin sone, in her husbandis dispite:
Beraus scho had ane other Paramour.
The May Thisbe wald tine her self sa nyte,
Cause Pyramus away and deid was quite:
For Venus saik scho curit na displesour*
Heirfoir Madame, sen their Nimphis of honou^^
Topleis Venus kest all their appetite:
I presuppone that they her it favor.
And weill I wait, that it is not liklie,
That ane of them on the assyis should be,
In my contrair, for I them hald partial
For all their dayis they luifit never me,
Bot ever kest their may Felicity,
To pleis Venus, as Lady may special.
And sen they all set ay their mind alhaill
To pleis Venus in my greit contrary,
I can not think that they can be equal.
For quhy al thing they did for Venus queen
It was all done in my contrary clean:
To that effect, to do me sturt and pine.
Thairfoir I think yat they sold not haif been
Put on assyis Justice to circumuene,
In any cause or Actioun of mine,
Or me to cause my Just quarrel to tine.
As to Justice to ow Madame I mean,
Put them of fyis, for I set them all nine.
Than Venus said in mind half stomochat*
Of the assyis nane salbe alterat.
As for the Roll, gif they pleis, reid agane*
Than said Vesta to Venus, weill I wait
e aucht not be both Judge, and Aduocat.
For and sa be, it is wrang e do plane.
Than said Venus with mind almaist Insane*
It salbe sa, as I haif Imperat.
Than said Vesta, Justice can not remane.
For gif sa be that richt e us deny,
Heir I protest befoir all standis by,
That it sall turn us to na prejudice,
Nor to tak hurt in this Court throw inuy,
Be our hatrent and greit melancholy:
(...) was vmquhile to vtheris done disprise.

With his awin doggis quhair e him haistelie

Because that he on case hapinnit ^enn neir

Quhairfoir we wa^d that e obt^^ (...).

Quhair by that we Iurin^heit na distres
And gif e preis this (...) man ^o oppres,
Our cause we sall to Cupid king translar,
For of all wrang he will us weill redres.
Than Venus was cummeri^ in cairis kene,
With mind dement vneis scho micht sustene
The words scharp quhilk scho thocht a^ to hicht
Sayand, schaip e (...) Cupid King complene?
To him my Court in na sort dois pertene,
Nor ^ane thairof to Cupid sall haifsicht.
Thairfoir it sall pas both our mane and micht
Be any way fra my Court to abstene.
Than Vesta said, Madame, I ask bot richt.
The Rollis relect quhais tennour e sall heir.
Desperance Knicht thou art Indytit heir
For flauchter of ane knicht hecht Esperance.
Secundlie, for language richt austeir
Thou did rehers to Esperance thy feir
Of Venus Queen into greit arrogance
Sayand, scho is the rute of all mischance:
Grounder of evil, and na vertew her neir.
And sa at schort set her at deffyance.
This and siclike in thy greit Tyranny
Oftsyis thou said, quhilk thou can not deny.
Defend thy cause, and make answeir beliue.
Weill (quod Vesta) to the first answeir I:
That point is false as is seen oppinlie.
As to slauchter, the man is it on live:
And never had, nor hes ane wound nociue.
This dittay is geinit in sinisterlie.
And in the self that point is suspensiue.
To the nirt point of that dittay think me,
All that he said it was of verity,
That sall I preif be perfyit argument:
Pleis e the same athir to heir or se.
I sall ow schaw be guide Authority
Baithin the new, and in the auld Testament,
Seir examples in the self evident.
And sum of them I sall now specify,
Quhilk to ressoun salbe correspondent.
^han said Venus with vult verecund,
Say quhat e will and keip ow within bound
Not pretendand to argune throw our will:
Bot to ressoun that our Sermon resound,
Or ellis the lak to our self sall redound.
Faith said Vesta I grant richt weill thairtist,
And say I ocht by ressoun or by skill:
I stand content with ow to be confound,
Sa that the same conditioun e fulfill.
As to that point quhair he blasphemit Venus
It is not half sa evil nor odious:
As e it hald: and this my cause and quhy,
Howbeit scho be sumtime richt glorious:
Into her self scho is richt venomous
Richt cummersum and full of Tyranny.
As in exampill schorthe schaw sall I.
Now quod Venus blaw forth our boist busteous,
Say quhat e pleis richt small I set it by.
Quod Vesta in the threttiefift Cheptour
Of Genesis Ruben Incurrit furour
Of his father, and eik the malisoun,
Beeaus he was sic ane Formeantour,
That with Bala his fatheris paramour
He lay, quhilk was to greit abusioun
And als to GOD ane greit contemptioun.
Quhairfoir Jacob said at his latter hour,
That Ruben was greit cause of his passioun.
Ruben primogenitus meus and principiun doloris mei. GENES. XLIX.
Than said Venus now e contrair our ^ell
Jacob e say quhilk callit was Israel,
Ane Patriach was, and ane haly man:
He had Bala in Paramour e tell,
How durst he with siclik ane matter mell.
Gif lufe was sa abhominabill than.
Schaw me the suith of this now gif e can?
Scho said his wife was deid callit Rachel,
Lyas sister and douchter to Laban.
Thocht sa had been his wife had been on live,
The law licent, with power possessiue,
At that time for to haif ane Concubine
And that for cause diverse consideratiue.
(Quod Venus) quha maid yat cause suspensiue?
Quha had power sit Actis to decline?
Than said Vesta, that did Scriptour divine
Of the Euangell, and the law positive,
It did suspend, and haldis as detestiue.
Siclik we reid into the xj. Cheptour,
In the third buik of Kings be Scriptour.
How Salamon, throw lufe Inordinat,
Howbeit he was of greit wisdom the flour,
Above all kingis that ever buir Sceptour
With lust of luifit he was laqueat,
Gart himfra GOD all deuotioun translait:
To falls Ydollis, sa throw lufis favor,
Lang tufie fra GOD he was degenerat.
(Quod Venus) gif he was sa wise ane King
As e haif said or in ane Realm culd ring
To reule ane Realm I ges that suith to be,
to purpois I meruell of ane thing:
Gif luif be not bot lust and lamenting.
Quhair was all than his wisdom tell latse.
Had it been sin, or schame I say for me:
Sa wise ane man had not throw misgiding
Anis crabit GOD, nor fallin in sic folly..
is (said Vesta) of lufe the rampand rage,
The ardent lust, and the kendilland curage,
The natural course, and eik the savage blude,
Will cause ane man dekay into dotage,
Unto the time that the lust be assuage:
And takis no thocht to ressoun, nor to good.
Richt swa it was of Solomon to conclude:
He conuertit forth of that foull thirlage,
And fra that time leuit ay in sanctitude.
In the sextene Cheptour wereid richt swa
Of Iudicum, Sampson and Dalida
His Paramouris quhome he gaif sic credence,
That he her schew quhairin his strenthis lay.
And thairfoir all his hair scho tuik him fra:
Quhairthrow all micht he mist to make defense.
Quhen scho that saw be good experience,
Scho him betrayit unto his mortal fa.
And this he gat throw lufis Insolence.
King David als quhilk spak greit Prophe^^
Throw lufis lust fell in Adultery,
With Vryis wife, his awin Knicht spetian
Sine writtingis send to Ioab quietly,
Greit Lufetenent of all his Seneori^,
Biddand him put Dry to the battle,
In sic ane place: that he should not preuaill:
Bot to be slane in brount of the army.
And sa he was be chance and weird fatal.
Sa David heir committit sinnis twane.
First Adultery, sine Homicide agane.
And all this come throw luif Inordinat,
The xj. Cheptour of Regum will not lane,
In the nixt buik, for their it standis plane.
We haif siclike exempill reuelat,
Of Just Joseph, quha was Incarcerat,
Be the false mind of his Lordis wife but lane,
Disirand him her bed to violat,
Quhilk he denyit, sayand Madame e know
All that my Lord hes now haif I not aw
Under my cure, saifand our awin persoun.
How may I than sic charge lat on me faw?
Considderand it is aganis the Law
And to my Lord ane greit vilipensioun.
I nill consent to do sic abusioun.
Incontinent als sone as scho that saw,
Scho her bethocht on ane forthocht felloun.
On the nixt day the same scho did desire.
He said, I nill aganis my Lord conspyre:
And special in contrair his honor.
For and I did I seruit to my hyre
For to be brint into ane cruel fire,
In witnessing of ane untrue Tratour.
Scho seand this, scho cryit with greit clamor,
This Tratour theif is cum into greit Ire,
Me to defoull allone within my bour.
And sa at schort, in handis sone taken was he,
And presonit sair with Irne bandis till ane tree.
Bot in schort time he was quit of that cair.
Quha pleisis mair of this story to se,
Luik Genesis the nine and threttie:
I am begilit and they find it not their.
Faith (quod Venus) he seruit it weill and mair,
That in sic neid wald not her anis supple:
Scho wairit her luif evil on him I declair.
I think the lufe that cu^mis on will motive,
It is far mair till allow be sic five,
As is good luif of Paramour allone,
But any band or strenene attractiue:
Bot with good will, and mind most exaltiue.
Quhair folk ar bound to luif thank gif I none.
To luif at lenth quhill ane of them be gone.
It is mair thank to haif lufe effectiue,
As Chawceris wife luifit Freir Ihone Bakone
(Quod Vesta) quhat causis yame fra lufe decli^e
Bot schame and lak with poverty and pine,
And to the deid as Chawcer dois Indice.
And evil daily spokin of them sensine.
Na (said Venus) I speik not to that fine:
Tuichand their sturt, their sorrow nor yair site
Bot gif they two togidder had mair delight
Into their time, nor they be law divine
At Kirk dur war coniunit and unite.
For they the quhilk at Kirk durtakis (...)
Ar their compellit both to burd and bed,
Fra that time forth, quhill deid them two depart.
Riches, seiknes, never to gar them sched.
And swa by luif the Law garris them be led.
Thus wayis man oftimes is maid Cowart:
He dar not to ane other set his heart.
For her at hame he is sa sair adred,
Howbeit ane other haif his heart Inwart.
That is na luif (quod Vesta) for this quhy:
It dois Inbring mair evil nor it puttis by.
Call e it luif, or call e it delight?
Gif siclik lufe cummis of our Lamenrie.
our luif and lust heir planelie I deny
For it is all bot sunkin into site.
And of that lufe diverse doctouris dois write
Seir exampillis, sayand to us schortlie:
The end thairof is dolor and despite.
Of this we reid, how Herod Antipas
His broderis wife he had Herodias:
And committit Adultery with Incest.
Because Sanct Iohne abhorrit sa greit trespass,
And it repreuit, King Herod crabbit was:
Him for to slay greit subtell wayis he kest.
Till on ane day he maid ane solemn Feist:
In the menetime in come ane pretty Las,
Dansand, and cled in manner guidliest.
^^r sport, and play, and dansing pleisit ye King
He bad her ask thairfoir quhat kind of thing
Scho wald desire, he sold it not deny,
Howbeit it war that ane half of his ring.
To her mother scho past but tarying,
To haif counsall, the quhilk scho gat in hy.
Scho said nothing at our grace couait I.
Bot Iohnis heid intill ane disch to bring:
Quhilk was grantit, and done richt suddanelie.
Of this slauchter he was cause efficient,
With the other two sinnis precedent.
This Sanct Mark sayis into his sert Cheptour
And all this come throw foull lust of luferent.
Quhairfoir he deit with misery dolent,
And was deiect with schame fra all honor,
Be the persute of the greit Empriour,
And was denude of his Kingdom and rent,
As Scolastick story schawis in Scriptour.
In the threttene Chaptour of Daniell,
Of this foull lust quhat is their for to tell?
Of two Elderis, and als of Susanna:
Cause scho denyit to fulfill their counsel
In Adultery, they fand ane way subtell.
Her to accuse befoir ane Judge they ga
Sayand they saw ane oung man and na ma
With her allone in ane aird Intermell:
To beir witness to the same, Heir we two.
And sa at schort, scho was condampnit to d^
Throw the falset of their two Preistis feid.
Sa on the morn the day come of Judgment.
Their scho allone wilsum of ane gudereid,
Throw Goddis grace stert wp into the steid
Quhilk never spak ane oung adolescent:
Sayand, I am of this deid Innocent.
Quhairthrew this woman in haist gat remeid.
And the same two to deid was schamelie schent.
Than Venus said, they seruit it and far mair.
Ane clean woman for to put in sic cair.
That lufe they had come all of falsitie:
It was na luif it was bot feneit fair.
For in sic luif is another reull nor squair,
Bot blindit lufe corrupt with cruelty,
Mirt with malice, repleit with subteltie:
And in that case pervert into despair.
Than said Vesta, Madame now we agree.
Na said Venus, to that I nill consent:
I will not it gif ouir my argument.
For all that I haif outher hard or seen:
Howbeit e haif schawin forth ane small legent.
I do not know gif it be evident.
For sic storyis I cuir them not ane prene.
And I deny that ever sic hes been.
Bot quhen e pleis sic castis e can Invent,
Me to defraude with gyle, and circumuene.
Than said Vesta, quhair that e say that I
Can find sic castis to ow sa haistelie,
Of my Ingine but any evidence.
As to that point, I say to ow schortlie,
that opinioun e tak sinisterlie,
It to defend e sall haif na defense
For I haif said na thing in audience,
Bot I haif schawin quhair it sta^dis thaptourli^
Aganis the quhilk e haif na resistance.
e know we reid in the divine Scriptour
Of Iudicum in the tuentie Cheptour:
Of ane woman for haistie stupratioun:
Four scoir thousandis of men that buir armor,
Threttene thousand ane hundredth in a stour,
And als three scoir, war slane but saluatioun.
And all this fell be foull fornicatioun
Of our falls luif e hald of sic valor:
And is nocht bot anguische and dampnatioun.
We reid siclike of Dauidis Sone Ammon:
Was slane be his brother Absalon:
For the Incest committit with Thamar.
Howbeit scho was ane Aperse allone,
And deir sister unto them both as one.
That greit vengeance scho culd not quench no^ pair,
Bot schamit her self for than and ever mair.
Tettio Regum this story dois propone,
In the threttene Cheptour it standis their.
Of genesis in the four and threttie
Cheptour we reid greit furiositie
Of slauchter maid be Leui and Simeon,
Because Sichem the prince of that country,
Had reft Dina their sister fair and fre:
And her stuprat, quhairfoir the greit vltioun
First come on him and his pepill Ilkone,
His kin and freindis, and Father but mercy
was put at schort till exterminioun.
Als it is red in storyis ancient,
Thocht it be not in ald nor new Testament.
How that Vergill that worthy wise doctor,
In latin tongue was ane most faculent,
Nane mair pregnant, facund, nor eminent,
To writ, or dyit, he was of Clerkis flour:
Throw our desait, and Inflammit ardour,
He was deiect be daft delyrament:
Become our slaif to his greit dishonor.
Quhair e him hang ouir our wallis in a crei^^
Howbeit after he was reuengit weill.
(As the story at mair lenth dois beir).
Ovid siclike on kneis e gart him kneill,
Gang on his handis, with ane bridill of steill
In till his teith, with other riding geir,
In lichtlines as e thocht best effeir.
And e abone to ryid begouth to reill,
With bute, and spur, sword, buklar, as bachleir.
Of our falls luif this is ay the commend:
Reid Gower ouir, and Bocchas to the end.
All Chronikles that any man of reidis,
e sall not find a taill ane other mend.
Bot to the werst it will ay condescend:
With evil intent our luif burgeonis and breidi^:
And ever mair sa forth it ay proceidis.
Quhat sayis Chawceral Christin men man ke^s
our evil mind their, and eik our cruel dridis.
In general and schortlie to conclude*
In all our luif it hard I never good*
In all Scriptour that ever man of wrait:
The poysonit vice thairof and turpitude
was the may cause in cumming of Noes flude:
Quhen all the world was neir depopulate.
How money men hes it effeminate.
Of all honor it kes diverse denude:
And als money of life exterminate.
Quhat* Kingis, Quenis, Dukis, and Empriours
Lordis, Ladeis, Barronis of greit honouris,
Hes been deiect throw luifis governance?
Of all the writ reid the Interpretouris
And of the world reid the Cosmographouris:
our last reward is vennemous vengeance,
Poysonit with prude, Heresy, and mischance.
We haif real exemplis of Nichtbouris,
That throw luifis lust deweyis in variance.
Of sic storyis I can ow schaw anew,
Quhilk e not hard, nor never it e knew.
Quhair all our luif is bot mixed with mischance,
In the Testamentis both the ald and the new
Aganis quhome e can haif na reskew,
In our debait, bot wilful arrogance,
Fragill and falls full of vltrequedance.
Quhairfoir I wald that e na mair persew
This gentill man, to Name hecht Desperance.
Than Venus said Madame Vesta sen e
Hes said at lenth, I pray ow now let me:
Quhair that e say, seir storyis e haif seen,
In the Testamentis both ald and new surely:
I gif credence, I traist it may weill be
it sum their is that e haif foret clean,
Or ellis I traist e never them saw with ene,
The quhilk to ow I sall part specify:
Than lat Iugis gif sentence us between.
Quhair e Infer all Inconuenientis,
Malice, desait, with diverse detrimentis,
Cu^mis of luif (as e haif said befoir)
Allegeand both the ald and new Testamentis
Historyis, Scriptouris, and vtheris lang legentis,
At our plesour traistand to get the gloir.
I reid of ane did us far mair decoir.
Our life wplift throw fervor and luifrentis,
Our ransoun pay, and us to grace restoir.
Of genesis in the aucht and threttie
Chaptour is red, that Judas quhilk surely
Was Iacobis sone, and of the Trybis twell,
With Thamar lay in his Iocunditie:
Howbeit scho was to him in affinity,
In doubill sort, as the Chaptour dois tell:
Into their play her womb begouth to swell
And buir two sonnis, Zaram and Phares fre,
As Mathow sayis in his first Euangell.
Phares Esrom, and Esrom Aram bure.
And sine Aram Aminadab for sure:
Aminadab siclike he gat Naasson:
Naasson Salmon ane Nobill Prince and pure*
it he Maryit Raab the commoun hure:
(As Iherome dois in the Bybill propone)
Howbeit diverse agane him dois argone.
Salmon and Raab into their lives cuir,
They gat Boos na ma bot him allone.
Than said Vesta, Madame their I persaif,
Into ane part as my mind dois consaif:
Salmon come of the Tribe of Israel:
Ane Nobill Prince, ane sage man, and ane graif
Ane commoun huir that he to wife should haif,
It is not lik to be true as e tell,
That ane prince wald with sic ane Intermell.
I traist Madame, e reid wrang, or e raif.
Than said Venus, reid Mathowis first Eua^gell.
Howbeit scho was sumtime richt Inconstant,
Beeft scho was in vertewis abundant,
Remeidit all throw guide prayer and deid.
Quhen Iosue was in Throne Triumphant,
He send his spyis elect and elegant,
To Ierico, to spy the land of breid:
Quhen their was nane durst them resaif for feid
Scho herbryit them and was participant
With Israel into their wrgent neid.
This and siclike causit this Nobill Prince
Haif her to wife, and do her reverence.
This e sall find Secundo Iosue,
As I haif said scho buir of excellence
Boos the first, a man of greit prudence:
Quhilk gat the nixt Boos of verity:
This gat the third, sa their was Boos three:
This Boos gat on Ruth Obed with mence,
Quhilk gat Isai that cleipit is Iesse.
This Iesse begat David that was King,
Chosin be GOD above Israel to ring.
Ane greit Propheit sine Solomon gat he,
On ane Lady richt bewteous, and bening.
Gentill, courts, curious, and conding,
Mansweit, suaue, to Name hecht Bersabe:
Quhilk was ye spous of vmquhile Knicht Vrie
As e proponit befoir in our saying,
All this luif come of sensuality.
It is weill knawin that Bersabea lay
With King David, as the Scriptour dois say,
Langtime befoir or her husband was slane,
Throw dern favor, and luif betuix them two
Now I begin agane quhair I best may,
That e consaif the storeis in certane.
First I rehersit Thamar and Raab plane,
And Bersabe the quhilk e can not nay,
War all of sport Ladeis venereane.
And swa thairfor to count ow line be line,
was JESUS borne Goddis verray sone divine:
Quhilk ransonit us with his precious heart blude.
And sa to bring my argument to fine,
I can not find in luif na time to tine,
Boc mixed with mirth, mercy, and manswetude,
Plenist with sport, and sueit suauitude,
Repleit with playis but poverty or pine,
Vell of worschip, the port of pulchritude.
^se of all storeis that e haif tald,
And allegiance with argumentis sa bald,
Aganis luif in malice and hatrent,
Come not sic evil it be ane thousand fald:
Nor never will, nor in na times wald,
As I haif schawin the good come of Lufrent,
Thairfoir as now I end my argument,
Sa that e will the victory wpeild,
And cry mercy sa far as is miswent.
That I deny Madame, than said Vesta.
As to the first, quhair that e planelie say:
First that Thamar, Raab, and Barsabe,
War licht Ladeis all geuin to sport and play,
As e allege, I say ow schortlie nay.
They war richt wise, and full of gravity,
And ar Namit in the genologie
Of Christ for good unto this present day,
For their vertew and greit humility.
Than Venus said, of Christ is genologie,
Was their na ma good women bot they three*
Or schaw the cause, quhy they ar in Scriptour
Mair thau^he laif, it is not lik to be,
Sa money Kingis of Eminent degree,
Sa gay Captanis of wealth and of valor.
Quhair was Mary of all women the flour?
I think scho sold be put in memory,
Gif their three gat for good life sic honor.
As I haif said befoir, it I say plane,
They three was of the Court venereane.
^e me cause sic wordis to disclois
The fourt I can find it withoutin lane:
The Lady Ruth wald haif been yair richt fane,
Quhen that scho eid into bed with Boos,
As Noemi bad for to cum to purpois,
Was all their good, na na e speik in vane,
e brek the text, and as e pleis dois glois.
Thus I conclude, thairfoir e Auditouris
Heir circumstant attend, and assessouris,
Quhidder that I or Vesta Lady fre
Hes schawin storyis autentik be Scriptouris,
Mair for to prais, or reput of valouris.
Perfitlie pance with all maturitie,
Sa that our voce concord in unity,
That pane may be in put to Forfaltouris:
The Party spthit, as Law will lat it be.
Tha^ spak an Nimphe, to name hecht Chaistitie
Ane of the sex in Vestais company.
Madame Venus, now I wald (with license
Of my Maistres) to speik two wordis or three.
Quhair that e say Thamar, and Barsabe,
Raab, and Ruth, war geuin to Insolence.
I say they war women of greit prudence,
Geuin to vertew, and profound gravity.
Groundit in grace with all Magnificence.
For quhy we reid after Lira, and Iohne mair,
And in the glois als Interlinear.
In the first heid, quhair they wrait in Mathe,
The Evangelist, settis him not to declair
Of the three Kingis quhilkis richt vicious war,
Of quhome Christ come be Just genelogie.
And for their vice evil life and cruelty,
Amang good folk he wald them not compair,
Bot ar seclude, abject as unworthy.
And gif evil men for vices ar seclude
Out of this band, sa gracious and good:
I think rather evil women to deprive,
Bot I suppone their women ar Include.
For their good life, vertew and sanctitude,
For to fulfill the number suspensiue,
And for to be the rute restoratiue.
For the three Kingis quhilk war befoir denude
Out of this clan and lineage successiue.
Heirfoir I say, Thamar and Bersabe,
Raab, and Ruth in the genelogie
Of Christ ar put for prayer and good deidis.
Na said Venus agane to Chaistitie,
I sall ow schaw alhaill the verity
Of that matter quhat Sanct Hierome reidis:
Because mercy of Christ ever proceidis,
Christ wald suffer of sinner is borne to be,
For to augment their meritis and their meidis
Howbeit I know of all sin Christ was quit
And Mary als I know that richt perfect.
Bot it they come of folkis frivolous,
That we micht know his cheritie Ignite,
Ardent, and hait, our sin to abolite:
Did nocht disdane to tak than kind of us.
An as the Rois dois spring of thornie bus.
Sa did Mary her virginity,
Sprang of the spray, and sum of them vicious.
Sicut lilium inter spinas, sic amica mea inter filias. CANTI. I.
In the vile schell is found the Perle of price.
Of the rude rute springis the flour delice:
In the gray clay is found the gold sa cleir:
Richt swa did Christ our flour and Fortalice,
Sprang of the rute quhilk part was geuin to vice.
Sa to purpois quhair of I spak lang eir:
Raab, and Ruth, Bersabe, and Thamar,
War licht Ladeis, thocht e it make sa nice,
And of my Court, and hes been money eir.
Thus (quod Venus) I end my conclusioun,
The remanent I put to discretioun
Of Theologis, or ellis profound Doctouris:
And quhair I faill into the writ Cannoun,
Be wrang reheirs, transgres, or collusioun.
Or by the boundis of the divine Scriptouris,
Antlk storyis, or honest Oratouris:
Heir I promit to stand at correctioun,
Quhen the Assyse will make Interpretouris.
And I siclike (quod Vesta am content
That my matter pas to the Judgment
Of the Assyse: with this ane liberty,
Richt perfitlie that they wald pance and prent,
Considder weill, and in their heid take tent,
Remord their mindis quhidder gif Chestitie
Be not mair clean, mair glorious, and hie
Triumphant stait, mair digne and eminent*
Than Venus warkis with all her dignity?
And this the cause diverse virginis and clean
Fra Venus warkis because they did abstene,
Outhair bodyis they sufferit mekill wa:
As in Scriptouris perfitlie may be seen.
Sum Heritonris, sum Countes and sum Queen:
As is Katherin, Margaret, and Barbara,
Dorothe, Lucie, and money diverse ma,
For Chaistitie greit sorrow did sustene,
Throw quhais vertew to heuin they did all ga.
They chois on them crar the dreidfull deid,
Than for to tine their precious madinheid,
Know and thairfoir ane reward special.
Siclike agane the rute of our remeid,
Our Saluatour to fell the feyndis feid.
Was he not borne of the bour virginal.
Chosin be consent of GOD celestial.
Quhair throw we all was quite of Plutois pleid,
Be sweit Incence of virginity royal.
And had not been that sweit virginite
Was mair condign in the thousand degree,
Tha^ Venus warks with corrupt mind and thocht
No way Christ had dedeneit borne to be
In the Chalmer of chosin Chaistitie,
And Venus warks had been with vertew wrocht
Cause they war not condign and nathing docht,
In sicht of GOD, he tuik Humanity
Of virgin womb, and of Venus tuik nocht.
Their beand weill considderit, and forsene,
I traist my cause but pley I sall obtene.
For weill I wait, their pointis ar releuant.
Quhairfoir Ladeis amiabill and amene
On the Assise, haif this befoir our ene,
Perfitlie pance their pointis last pregnant.
That e not be now callit Ignorant,
Or any sall our science circumuene,
Sayand e ar to much participant.
And samy cause I put to our conscience,
As weill auisit Assise with sapience:
Traistand ow all repleit with equity,
Fulfillit with faith, and eik profound prudence:
Groundit in good, rutit in reverence,
Lawreat Ladeis, flour of feminitie:
Protestand heir for our greit clemency
Deill with the richt, and do me no offense,
Be corrupt mind, nor partiality.
I wait e all in science sa dois schine,
In profound wit, and eminent Ingine,
That all obscure problem or questioun
e can discus, declair, and determine,
Enucleat, as Regentis most divine:
Sa prudentlie e can gif solutioun.
For quhy I know e all tuik potatioun
Of licour sweit at the font Caballine,
Quhair all vertew dois flurische with fusioun.
Heirfoir Ladeis humbly I Imploir,
Haif weill in mind I haif rehersit befoir,
Mixed with prudence, and our perfect prowes,
e not deiect the dignity, nor gloir,
Spule, nor reif* diminute, nor defloir,
Into na sort this deifeit Gods,
Virginity, for our awin gentilnes.
Lusty Ladeis, I neid now speik no moir,
Do as e think speidfull in this process.
And so Venus to the same did consent.
Anon but baid the Assyse forth is went,
Richt stupefact, cause the matter was hie,
On other syid be storyis ancient.
And specially of the last small legent
Vesta did schaw be good Authority,
And done in deid be verray verity.
Sa but tarry they all with ane consent
Chancellar on syse they chose the May Tis^e.
For thocht her mind was to Venus alhaill
it vncompleit in deidis actual
It was but dowt (as her story dois schaw).
That was the cause they cheisit her but faill.
Chancellar on syse, that scho should stand equaill
On both ye sydis, cause sum part scho did know)
Sa the Assise beliue was set on raw,
And socht all Actis in caisis criminal,
Kest buikis like beis in all process of Law.
The Fourt Buik.
FIRST down they kest Moses Pentateuchon,
with his storyis, and Paralipomenon,
Judith, Hester, Ruth, Regum in dite.
The Epistillis of Paul, the sayingis of Solomon
With Lirais glois upon the writ Cannon
The Machabeis with storyis Infinite:
The new Testament profound and eik perfect:
Peter, and James, the Apocalips of Iohne:
And all Propheitis in Prophecy did write.
In civil Law they kest down Bartholus,
Alexander de Imola, and Baldus:
The Coddis, Decreis, Decretales, and Jason:
The Institutis, Digestis, and Angelus,
The Inforciat, and Panormitanus,
With other diverse difficill to expone,
Quhilk wrait in Law both Civil and Cannon
Quhais warkis was sa done compendious.
In that behalf they ar Maisteris allone.
In argument togidder all they go
In questionis both in Contra and Pro:
Allegeand writ be greit authority,
Of Homeir, Gower, and als of Cicero:
Appellatiounis fra Plautus to Plato.
Quhilk in the syis maid greit diversity.
Sum was Infect with parcialitie,
Quhais allegiance was oftimes to and fro,
Thocht the Chancellar greit laubours their diddre.
And so after diverse disputatioun,
Greit argumentis, and preexcogitatioun
Of both the Lawis forth socht fra end to end.
The Assise fand be good consideratioun,
Vestais estait, and her conuersatioun.
In money gre did Dame Venus transcend,
Be ver^eous prerogatives weill kend.
Quhairfoir they gaif Vesta dominatioun
Abane Venus all their with greit commend.
Sayand, howbeit all folkis heir on line,
Hes not fra GOD the greit prerogative
Of abstinence and clean virginite,
For and sa war na seid war successiue,
The world wart^^^e of all kin folkis beliue:
And after us war na posterity.
Bot GOD allone ordanit not sa to be:
He ordanit sum be of kuid genitive,
And fill the world after their quality.
it than we find Vesta in her estait,
Richt verteous, worthy, Inuiolait.
Precious, perfect, ve^ran constant, and clean,
Richt glorious with strenth weill roborait,
Contrair the flesche daily at the debait,
With all her force perfitlie dois refrane,
Fra temptatioun thairof als dois abstene.
For that ilk point scho is deificait:
Howbeit ilk ant the same may not sustene.
Bot nottheles the Assyse fand agane
That Desperance had faillit far in plane
Contrair Venus into sa far as he
Did lichtlie her with wordis void and kane:
Richt dispiteous language of greit disdane.
Thinkand richt weill they wald not that ouirse,
But punischement with all austeritie:
That nane sold preis to play the counterpane,
Quhat ever he war of hie or law degree.
Thocht Dame Vesta scho be ane greit Gods
All repleit with vertew and worthienes,
As it effeiris weill to her faculty.
They wald not thoill Venus haif lichtlines,
Nor repudie, rebuik, nor it distres
Be na kin wicht, and ouir all specialie
Of Desperance, considderand that he
Was her vassal, and held her as Maistres
Vinquhile afoir, and had thairfoir his fee.
Howbeit sum time for none expeditioun
Of his erandis, quhair he had affectioun,
And micht not cum sa sone to his Intent,
Nor put his billis to ferme executioun,
Incontinent with sair forthocht felloun
Agane Venus he grew in matilent,
Be orgweill mind, and thocht Impacient,
Melancholy, and wilful contemptioun,
Helichtlyit her as Inobedient.
And turnit sa far intill her clean contrair,
That he but dowt was drint into despair,
Be greit wanhope quhilk causit him fall in pleid
Agane Venus, and all her Ladeis fair:
Quhill now at lait, he is cawcht in the snair
Of scharp Justice, and in perrell of deid,
Bot gif in haist that their be found remeid.
For wit Venus how he standis in danger,
Without mercy but baid of will his heid.
Thairfoir gif this matter pas to rigor,
It will be said we all hes tint the flour
Of womanheid and we be merciles.
They will it lay contrair Venus honor,
And scho or we be the cause of Murder,
The greit defame and schame we get expres.
For it is said that wemennis tenderness
In heart can not thoill men haif displesour:
And specially their deith for to purches.
Heirfoir let us amang us all devise
Considerand the man in perrell lyis:
Quhat is the best to saif Venus honor.
We will send down the Chancellar of the syis
To Rhamnusia, quhair scho sittis, and blandyis
For grace in time gif we may fang favor,
And put not all of to the latter hour.
That the man get be us na preiudyis,
Nor in na part for to haif displesour.
With humbill heart and hauingis dolorous,
Lawlie langage, and fassounis fauorous,
In sober wise this we may say her till,
With greit requeist and mind richt desirous,
Sa prayand her for to be pieteous:
Sayand but dout that he is cum in will,
And in all sort the samin sall fulfill.
Beseikand her for to be gracious
And take the best, and set on side all evil.
And swa his life to be saif and his good.
And ask mercy for the greit Mansuetude
In women been, as scho expedient
Thinkis to dispone, efterwart scho may dude.
Quhidder scho will of his life him denude:
Or saif his life gif scho will stand content.
Into ane bill this man be to her sent.
Sa in ane voice heirupon we conclude.
The bill was maid: with it Thisbe is went.
On humill wayis and maneris womanly,
Richt Chancellarlike kneilland upon her kne,
To Rhamnusia the missiue represent
Fra the Assise with curage courteslie
Sayand Madame sen Judge heir now e be,
Unto our grace to schaw ow their intent:
To that effect this bill hes to ow sent,
To wit our will, cause the matter is hie:
Prayand to send to them our auisement.
With all honor the bill scho did resaif.
As Nobill Nymph, and Lady most suane:
Red it to end secreitlie her allone,
Quhais text scho did considder and consaue:
With mature mind and countenance richt grave
Richt perfitlie of all they did propone.
Thinkand richt weill they covet na vltioun:
Their mind erair was the mannis life to haif.
^or him to tine be exterminioun.
Venus beheld the bill geuin be Thisbe,
To Rhamnusia, and reidand quietly:
Scho said Madame, ane thing I ow requeir
Of that ilk bill quhat may the tennour be,
Gif it be any prejudice to me,
I ow protest, the Text that I may heir.
Glaidlie Madame said scho as should effeir,
Swa in all pointis that e thairon agree.
I stand content (quod Venus) with glaid cheir.
Traistand richt weill be perfect knawleging,
e will not thoill, nor bid me do na thing,
That my honor may faid in any sort,
Or displesour any to me Inbring.
Na than (said scho) I war na way conding
Of ow to bruik office I say at schort.
Bot all is for our plesour and confort.
Than said Venus reid forth but tarying,
I am content sa e keip our report.
The Court was Coy, commandit was silence,
Under all pane they should gif audience.
Rhamnusia the bill scho gaif in deid
To Fremmitnes, Justice Clerk in presence
Of all the Court, had her reid the sentence
To Dame Venus, for scho dowtles but dreid
Was weill appayit sa Fremmitnes did proceid
In the missiue with all her diligence
Of the true Text, this way began to reid.
Missiua Rhamnusiae missa ab Assisa.
SEN we for fault of personis mair prudent
Be ow elect Madame ar present heir,
In greit laubouris, and uncouth argument,
As Assisouris the matter to make cleir.
Bot it is sa contrarious and austeir,
To the rigor and we it put dowtles,
Women for ay salbe callit merciles.
De Desperance (as GOD forbid he do)
The lak, and schame, and all defamatioun,
To Dame Venus but dowt it will cum to:
And cause Ladeis to get blasphematioun:
And be haldin of the les reputatioun:
Both odious, and snell as ane serpent.
Quhairfoir as now we schaw ow our intent.
We find Vesta in the far hier estait
Than Dame Venus, be money suir questioun.
In that behalf Venus may not debait
In any sort be na comparisoun.
Bot sa far as Venus gat detractioun
Be Desperance, sayand of her all evil,
As to that point, we put him into will
Of ow Madame, as Judge, and to Venus.
Hang, heid, and draw, do with him as e pleis,
Beseikand her and ow to be gracious,
And fra malice our mind with mercy meis.
This we desire for to deuoyid diseis
In time cumming, and ever he do siclike,
He salbe brint euin as ane heretic.
and gif Venus be obstinate in this case:
^^^^an solist scho be gracious also,
^^^^saif his life, of her mercy and grace,
And find ane friend quhair that scho had ane fo*
And win ane wicht to weill that was in woe,
And deliver the drery of distres:
That women sall not be callit merciles.
For weill we wait, or Venus wist him de
In her defalt, sa that he cum in will:
For all the faltis and the greit velanie
That ever he said, throw wilfulnes by skill:
Scho lever gif ten thousand crounis him till,
To saif his life, we know sa her kindness,
That scho on force can not be merciles.
For our honor Madame this we requeir,
With our answer as e expedient
Thinkis for to gif and Lady Venus heir.
Als prayand her for to be pacient,
As we believe the criminal dois repent
Beseikand heir our gracious excellence,
Quhair that we faill, that e wald find defense.
FINIS MISSIVAE.
VENUS heirand this pieteous petitioun
Send fra the syse on sa good ane fassoun,
Ane richt greit thing her mind it mitigait.
Scho said Madame, I sweir ow be my Crown
I am mair blyith than geuin me ten Muleoun
Of fine reid gold in hand weill numerait.
For I lang eir was sa hie stomochait
At Desperance, for his greit rebellioun:
That in this world his deith I may couait.
And sen my sisteris on the sise hes said,
That Desperance is cum in will, and mai^
To make ane mendis as Ierpedient
Thinkis to be taken: thairof I am richt glaid.
For weill I wait his stomach is stormestaid,
Because he is put in ane Merciment
Of all the Court with the Assise consent.
Bot I war laith my honor war degraid
For their requeist, howbeit I be pacient.
And quhen I heir of the Assise sentence.
That Desperance is cum in Repentence:
And put in will, and schawin befoir the Judge,
Promineit be the sutouris Eloquence:
Than is dew time with matetis to dispense,
And faltis ouir se quhilkis he committit huge.
And gif I pleis him to repel or luge,
Is not all that put in benevolence
Of me, gif I will take him in refuge
First call the syse, and heir their diffinitioun:
All that they make put it to executioun.
And quhat I say it sall stand firm and stabill,
But obstakill, ganecall or reuocatioun,
Impediment, or appellatiounr
Incontinent past Tisbe forth but fabill:
Schew the Assife with fassoun fauorabill:
How that Venus tuik good consideratioun
Of their writtingis, and thocht them acceptabill.
And sa schortlie come the Assise anon.
All that they did the Chancellar did propone,
^^est to the Judge, and sine to the sutour:
^^^shais text beliue quhen that scho luikit on,
In fremmit ternies scho did it sone erpone.
That Desperance was found ane Forfaltour,
Ane rank Redell, and als ant Trespassour
Aganis Venus, and been ane selloun fone
Till all her Court, and e^^^ ane greit Tratour
it not the les because he did repent,
And in all sort was cum obedient:
The Assise thinkis they couate not his deid.
To that effect Ilkane with ane consent,
They haif hini put in Venus merciment:
Quhat scho best pleis, to do him favor or feid:
To quarter him, to hang him, or to held:
They know and weill that Venus as pacient,
In this behalf scho will get him remeid.
To the nixt point that the Assise hes done:
They find Vesta mair Triumphant in throne,
In greit degreis, not is Lady Venus.
Quhairfoir they will that Vesta be abone
In all estait: for Venus be natone
May be her peir throw warkis verteous.
Not for to say, Venus is velanous:
Bot that her warkis may na les be undone
Nor of befoir, bot Vesta is mair Famous.
Than Vesta hard scho was put to honor
Abone Venus, be Interloquntour
Of the Assise forth geuin be their sentence.
Scho did protest that her Court nor her Bour
In time cumming should haif na displesour
Into na sort, nor Inconvenience,
Vilipensioun, lichtlines, nor offense
Of Venus Court prejudice nor rigor:
And thairupon tuik notis and Instrumentis.
Considerand (quod scho) as all men seis,
I am preferrit richt far in greit degreis,
And all my Court above Venus estait:
Howbeit this man for falt of greit suppleis,
Be rank Inuy, as is liklie now dois.
it I desire my Court be separait
Fra ow, and ouris, and be exonerait:
That this Court turn me to na preiudeis,
Bot to haif place our self ay to debait.
That it may be to all men richt weill knawin,
That I am Nymph, and Queen ay of my awin:
And als preferrit richt far abone Venus:
Requyrand ow e Scribe* sic may be schawin,
Quhen all this brybe and boist is quite ouir blawin
In adventure gif sic castis cautelous
Be raisit agane throw Ingyne odious,
The prothogoll heirof I wald haif drawin
In writ, for cost to be my Vidimus.
The Judge thotht it than richt expedient,
That scho said their all was convenient,
And her desire consonant to ressoun.
Both the Assise and Judge with ane consent.
They bad that scho should haif her Instrument,
And all her sawis they ratifeit but chessoun,
and did affirm the same in that sessoun.
^hairat Venus was verray discontent,
That Vesta gat sa sone her peticioun.
Than Venus woxsa wraith at Desperance,
Throw Vestais sawis, and her allegiance.
Incontinent unto the Judge scho said.
Madame, it is not it far fra remembrance,
This man should be put to the ordinance
Of me, and in my will the syse him maid:
And fra my will he may na way ewaid.
And throw my will he man stand to his chance.
The Judge grantit, and than Venus was glaid.
Incontinent Dame Venus loud did cry
On the Schiref that standis at hand heir by.
Do our office as effeiris to our stait,
Bind e his handis, let that be done in hy.
The Schiref said that can I not deny,
Sen sa he is convict and maid chakmeit.
Swyith said Venus, se that e handill him hait.
And than fra hand in the Court raise the skey
That Desperance was deid without debait.
But baid (quod scho) gar cast him in presoun,
Still to remane without any ransoun,
Quhill forther mair, quheneuer I best pleis.
My privilege put to executioun.
For his greit wraith, and rampand rebellioun,
Aganis my Court was nathing wald him meie
Now sall he sit with hunger and diseis.
Quha will, quha Nill in till ane deip dungeon
Quhair he sall haif greit called with latill eis.
And sa in hat^^ but baid his handis was (...)
To that effect to ly in to the ground
Of presoun deip ever unto the deid.
Than Esperance was strikkin with sic stound
Of puir piety, maid in his heart sic wound,
Seand his feir fall in sic felloun feid.
Thocht in him self, allace is na remeid:
Sall Desperance sa schortlie be confound,
Thocht he and I throw play fell in bawch pleid?
Lamentatio Esperantiae.
WA worth the time that ever I him saw:
Wa worth ye hour yat first I did him know
Wa worth the tide that ever we two met:
Wa worth the day that ever it did daw,
To se my friend into sic thrist and thraw,
And for my saik in sorrow all ouir set.
Allace allace is na remeid to get,
Wa worth the tongue that ever persewit sic Law,
To se his handis into ane cord thus plet.
I was to hait sa sone for to complane:
I was unwise that his falt culd not lane:
I was unkind throw heit of sawage blude:
I was to sone onir strikin with disdane:
I was to pert to put my friend to pane.
Allace, allace, now mingis my mane and mude.
I was but hap, I was of grace denude:

Now will they hald my deidis detestabill:
Now may I bruik with greit barret and baill,

Allace, allace, hard is my destenie.
Now call they me ane Tratour tressonabill.
Of my brother cause I had na piety.

Now may they say, lo quhair one Tratour gais
Pointand their hand with money skorne and knak
Quhair ever I gang to my greit schame and lak.

Sa of my freindis I fang me felloun fais.
Allace, allace, to be brint at ane staik
To saif his life, I wald not euir two strayis.
Quhat causit me sic thing to take on hand?
Quhat causit me my brother to ganestand?
Quhat causit me to deith him to persew?
Quhat causit me sic faltis I to him fand?
Not bot wodues, and wanting of the wand.
That men callis wit: and thairfoir now I rue.
Allace, allace, I was not traist nor true.
I had lever now be deid nor lewand:
All game and gle fra me ever adieu.
Unto the beist I may compairit be,
After her birth in furiositie,
And greit wodnes scho it denoris their.
Agane quhen scho is in stabilitie,
Scho wantis her birth and lukis about to se.
And findis it deid: than scho dois rout and rair:
Quhan na remeid is than scho makis cair.
Allace, allace, this may be said be me,
Undid my feir, allace for euermair.
Finis Lamentationis.
SA all the syse was verray discontent.
That Venus was sa scharp, and Impatient.
At Desperance, quhilk was put in her will:
Ilkane thinkand they did richt sair repent,
That they him put sa far in merciment.
Considerand ouir sair scho was him till.
it than they fand ane wit mouit of skill,
Quhilk was that they wald Venus make content
Be sum new burd, and her plesour fulfill.
Thisbe quhilk was on the Assise Chancellar,
To Esperance in quiet scho said their.
Into all haist sone on thy kneis sit down
Befoir Venus, as Lady most preclair:
Humbly prayand, for her grace singular,
For to grant grace and life to thy Muneoun,
Thocht thou and he fell in ane strange opinioun
Thou traistit not should fallow sic dangear,
Or dout of deith, or perpetual presoun.
And sa sall he be saif, or ellis nocht.
And as scho said swyith Esperance hes wrocht,
But mair delay fell down upon his kne
Befoir Venus, with all deuoir he docht.
Sayand Madame, for him that us all bocht.
My petitioun that e wald grant to me.
For our grei^ renth, and sweit benignity:
e wald grant grace, for grace I to ow socht,
Make Desperance quite of Captivity.
As e ar flour of all Feminite,
Grant him his life, and make him anis fre.
And I promit under all hiest pane
That may Incur or be laid upon me.
That he sall not eschew away, nor fle.
Bot quhen e pleis to enter him agane.
Prayand our grace that I wirk not in vane.
Than said Venus, as thou will sa salbe.
Scho grantit grace, than Esperance was fane.
it said Venus, I say this with restrictioun:
I grant him grace, bot under the conditioun,
In time to cum that he brew na mair baill.
Under all pane of the greitest punitioun
That may be had, with haistie executioun:
And na process of Law sall him awaill.
For remembrance of this memorial
That I haif said, I will he find cautioun.
(Quod Esperance) that sall I be but faill.
Than Venus gart ane Nobill Nimphe but mair
Callit Confort, both pleasant and preclair,
Fair offassoun, benign with all beauty,
Dissolve his ha^dis quhilks richt fast bundin was
And maid him quite of all his greit dangeir.
Quhair he befoir was fast scho maid him fre:
Sayand good schir, now blyith and merry be:
Quhair e befoir was sicker in the snair,
I sall ow put to our awin liberty.
Gif he was blyith, it neidis not now to speir.
Than said Venus, it e sall gar him sweir,
That he keip all promisis that is said.
Schir said Confort, e man lay our hand heir
Upon this buik, and with ane aith austeir,
e man make fast that salbe to ow laid.
Lady Venus e sall never degraid,
In word, nor deid, nor never do her deir.
To sweir the same (quod he) I am richt glaid.
For and e do (quod Confort) but debait
Agane Venus raise any rank riat
In time to cum, it will cause sturt fra hand
Anis in her girne and e be laqueat
Or in any point be dissimulat,
I ow assure our pardoun will not stand,
Bot haistie deith, tinsall of life and land.
Be war thairfoir that e haif na desait
(Quod he Madame) faith I sall keip my band*
And sa beliue but mair process or baid,
Confort causit his greit aith to be maid,
Upon all pointis rehersit of befoir.
Than the Assise and all the Court was glaid.
Sine Esperance anon to Venus said,
Madame I wald ane thing at ow Imploir,
That our worschip sall augment and decoir.
Micht I our grace be any sort perswaid,
I wald this man in our service restoir,
Sa our grace thocht his service acceptabill:
I sall vphald his service Inceissabill
Unto our grace, with all his micht and mane.
All faltis bygane of quhilkis he was culpabill
He did or said be crimes criminabill,
Be quite foret, ouirsene, and all forlane,
Never to say, nor do ow falt agane,
Bot ever in our service agreabill
To leif and de with ow ay to remane.
Than Venus said with facound face and fassoun
Sa that I wist it war his awin affectioun,
And thairof had ane sicker assurance,
I wald not euir to grant to our peticioun:
And als him gif ane general remissioun.
It is but dowt Madame, said Esperance.
Than (quod Venus) unto my observance
I him restoir but any collusioun,
And puttis him haill agane in ordinance.
Than Venus at Dame Vesta did Inqueir.
Madame, how ar e pleisit of this cheir.
Than said Vesta, I can no man compel
With me remane, owther day or eir
In my service to byid or perseueir:
Bot as they pleis, and likis best them sell.
Bot quha likis weill with me remane and dwell
Can not be turnit be fair wordis nor austeir,
Nor in na sort with ow will Intermell.
That gentill man vnfetchit he come to me,
Murnand richt sair that dolor was to se:
Of all confort he was richt desolait.
Quhan I him saw, I had reuth and piety
That he was put unto sic poverty.
At his requeist I purposit for debait.
Bot now sen he is gane ane other gait.
I am content, sa he contentit he:
For in na sort his company I couait.
Sa at all time I bruik my priuilage.
That it be not redact unto thirlage,
Bot fre and frank fra all kin kind of wicht.
And e Venus with our Court of curage,
I ow discharge that e haif na bondage
Of me, nor mine be our falls subtell slicht.
And I siclik agane to ow dois plicht,
In time to cum ather do na owtrage.
They war content, and Vesta tuik good nicht.
Than Rhamnusia sone scho gart cry on hie:
I will this Court as now continewit be,
To the same force, form, effect as effeiris,
As of befoir, bruikand all liberty.
And sa they raise Ilkane in their degree.
And Venus taill two Ladeis up it beiris.
Vtheris agane the gait befoir her steiris:
And swa they pas with greit solemnity
To Venus hall, both Ladeis and Bacheleiris.
Than Venus gart ane sort of Ladeis ing
Sone Desperance unto her Chalmer bring:
And him vncled of all his awin vesture.
Incontinent ane other fresche cleithing
He was withcled: and he agane randring
To Venus thankis above all creature:
Sayand Madame, quhill my life may Endure,
I salbe ay faithful but feneing
Unto our grace but dout I ow assure.
Weill (said Venus) thou dois me now plesour,
Howbeit befoir thou was ane forfaltour,
And to thy Name was callit Desperance.
In presence heir within my hall and Bour
I the resaif into my greit favor,
And makis the feir to my Knicht Esperance,
Thy greit honor, and worschip to auance.
Of thy auld Name I the deprive this hour:
To thy Drourie, and callis the Daliance.
And of my Knichtis I make the ane expres,
That keipis my Bour heir now befoir witness.
Scho callit her Knichtis befoir her euerilkane:
Quhais Names was (gif I can weill them ges)
outh, wantones, Vassalage, and Blyithnes,
Pastance, Plesance, Mirth, Merines ouir ane,
Curage, Kindness, and Rippet, in was taken,
Favor, Nurtour, Glaidnes, and Gentilnes,
Audacitie ane Nobill Knicht allane.
Compeirit sone Sensuality their.
Quhilk to Venus was chief Cubiculair
Humanity, Solace, and Hardines:
Sine Manlines, with Nobilnes, maid repair:
Sine sweitnes come quhilk was her Thesaurar*
Sine Cheualrie come in with vaileantnes:
And Esperance come in with him Prowes:
Sine in come Lust, greit Lord and Secretair^
And at his bak come Sport with Tenderness.
Quhen Venus had her Knichtis all in presence:
To them scho said in oppin audience:
Heir is ane squyre the quhilk Daliance hecht,
That to my Court sum time hes maid offense:
Bot for sic thing with him I clean dispense.
And in favor heir I resaif him richt,
And him restoris be the hand to the hicht
That he had ay of my Court, with credence*
In sign heirof Daliance I dub the Knicht.
Swa in her armis tha^ scho him thristit thryis
And swa did all the Ladeis of the Assyis:
And syne the Knichtis as they expedient
Thocht for the time, as the use is and gyis.
Than they began to dance at all deuyis,
That the greit noyis flew to the firmament.
Than tuik they in Iurnayis of Tornament,
And speir rinning, with money Interpryis:
Bot buklar play was their sport most frequent.
Bot quha had seen the Iournayis of rinning,
Greit Tornamentis, and money speiris brekking.
Sad straikkis, and sair, without any ransoun.
The other part agane recountering,
With greit defense, and wonder ferce riding:
It had been fecht callit anericht felloun.
Quha wan the field, or greitest Campioun,
(...) was Victour, I nacht decerne that thing:
Bot as me thocht Ladeis was ay dung down.
(...) bald battle, and brekking of harnes,
The bricht breist plaittis with birnest brukilnes,
The braid buklaris but baid was laid on breid,
The bluntit blaidis with manly besines,
The scheddit scheilds, deip woundis but sairnes,
The peirt persing of foirgeir into deid,
The faisit speiris, and never wound did bleid,
The forwrocht wichtis in verray werines,
To schaw as now, war prolixt to proceid.
Bot to haif seen as semit be apperance.
The rank Inuy, and the foull defiance,
The greit malice, and eik the fremmit feir,
The sour persute, and syne the resistance,
The rigorous raise with greit vultrequedance,
e wald haif traist it had been ringand weir:
Bot never ane their did ane other deir,
Loving to GOD all endit with plesance:
Ilk man that ran he buir hame his awin speir.
Sine quhen the field discomfist was and done,
The Trumpettis blew with sic kin noyis and tone
The rumor raise with ane fell reird and cry,
And bad Ilkane that they should pas but hone,
In all good haist, and make him for the none,
And to their dine should dres them haistelie:
Sone war they set with mirth and melody.
Lady Venus was first set in her Throne:
Sine all her Nimphis in their degree her by.
Nixt in ordour was set ilk Nobill Knicht,
As the Marschell it speidfull thocht and richt.
Bot in the field that day quha preuit best
With manlines and manifest their micht,
Venus gart sit in ane place of mair hicht,
At her Tabill, and ay her self neirest:
Ilk delicat but dowt was to them dressed.
For scho yame thocht good play fuilis day and nicht
To take pastime quhen vtheris eid to rest.
Swa still they sat the coursis come bedene
In Silver werk that was both bricht and schene.
The strange meittis mixed with the spices hait,
The confectioun sa costly and sa clean,
At this present befoir that lusty Queen,
The deir dancers with diverse delicait,
Sa plesandlie to her was preparait,
In all my dayis sic never I saw with ene,
Them to rehers it excedis my consait.
And sine the drink it was sa delicious,
With smell and savor, sa sweit and amorous:
All michtie wine I traist but dowt was their.
Bot quhair I lay sa lang under the bus,
Swyith up I raise in Name of deir JESUS.
Me thocht I wald fane had part of their fair.
Forward I fuir, richt faint I ow declair,
In hoip to haif at them honest almous,
Because I was sa auld ane man and hair.
Swa in I come amang that company,
Quhair they sat at their heavenly Majesty.
I ask almous for luif of JESUS deir.
Their stude I lang, never ane blent to me.
^last ane said, quhat may one fell freik be*
With the quhite berd and scarlat ene dois bleir?
Ane other said, ald carll quhat dois thou heir?
Quhat can thou do for our utility.
To rin ane rink, or it to brek ane speir?
Ane other said, I know weill be his face,
He is not ane man to rin in our Barrace,
For laik of pith he is sa puir and peild.
Than said the fourt, heir he will get na grace:
It war mair meit seik to sum other place,
Quhair he war abill to get sum better beild.
Ane speirit my Name: I said they call me Eild.
Swyith pak (quod scho) or our bak beir a bace:
Out of this hall: e are not for this field.
All the Ladeis was verray discontent:
And grew at me wonder Impatient.
And schew Venus that I was in the hall.
Befoir her I was brocht Incontinent:
In my contrair scho grew in matilent.
Sayand, auld Carll, the foull evil the befall.
How durst thou be sa malapert with all
In my palice thy self for to present?
Swyith out of sicht, gar sling him ouir the wall.
I said Madame and, it pleisit our grace,
Thocht now the day and hour be cum on case,
Into our hall e hald me odious:
The time hes been, I wald haif run ane race,
And brast ane speir in mid of the Barrace,
As nichthouris did, and was als Cheualrous
In any deid is, or Actis anterous:
I was als frak quhen I had time and space,
As any is this day within this house.
Bot the greit deidis that I tuik often on hand
Into our Court, quhen I dwelt in this land:
The rank riding, and the greit turnament
Causis me now, that I may skantlie stand,
Bot I haif been sa lang at our command,
Now for to ride I laik abuilement:
My riding geir is all to gane and spent.
it had I geir I should be our seruand.
e know Madame, good will should be payment.
Ga way said scho, ane fell freik thou hes been
That weill I know be thy beld heid and ene:
With yi good will thou hes done yat thou may
Bot thy good will without good deid between,
Is not comptit in my Court worth a prene.
Trowis thou good will be payment? I say nay
I luif ow weill: sa did I isterday.
Preif it than in deid with curage fra the spleen.
Good will but deid is not bot barnis play.
Quod he Madame, I seen the day and hour.
e wald haif thollit me to byid in our Bour.
(Quod scho) yat is past, good niche now feldifa^
Fairon fond fuill, thou gerris heir na favor:
Thou art na Page for to do us plesour.
And sa schorthe I was schot ouir the stair.
The ettis was cloisit hard on my heillis their.
^hus they me treit with tene within that Toure
^ll their Feist, nor meit gat I na mair.
At Vestris Court their quite I tin^^ good nicht,
Quhair I sum tune was wont to be ane Knicht.
I kissed the ettis their never to cum agane.
Hame wart I drew with all my ma^^ and micht,
With ^^af in hand ca^s past was the day licht,
I fand ane sire quhair of I was richt fane:
With Iuk and pen to writ I maid me bane.
As e haif hard now reid b^^^ir ow richt.
Of their Ladeis and Court venereane.
Beseikand ow heirof that reidaris be,
With hartlie lufe and all humility,
Because I was both fundeit, faint, and called,
And culd not bring away all perfitlie,
Throw du^^ Ingine, and none ability:
Or by ressoun quhair any thuig is called,
Throw halda^d v^rs quhair cullom dois not hald
With all requerst excuse that e wald me:
And for penance my pen I heir vpald.
(...) our all both Ladeis ald and ing,
Gif I haif said or form^ any thing*
Of my awin heid into our contrairie,
To gr^^nt mercy, and gif penance conding:
First fra Venus, and sine fra Cupide king,
Quhair all luifaris should seill Heretour is be.
Now last of all praying CHRIST on our king

At our last end, Amen for cheritie.
Soli Deo Gloria.
