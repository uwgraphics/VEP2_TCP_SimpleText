Cuckolds Haven: OR,
The married man's misery, who must abide
The penalty of being Hornify'd:
He unto his Neighbors does make his case known,
And tells them all plainly, The case is their own.
To the tune of, The Spanish Gypsy.


COme Neighbors follow me,
that Cuckollized be,
That all the Town my see
out slavish misery:
Let every man who keeps a Bride
take heed he be not hornify'd.
Though narrowly I do watch,
and use Lock, Bolt, and Latch,
My wife will me o'rematch,
my forehead I may scratch:
For though I wait both time and tide,
I oftentimes am hornify'd.
For now the time's so grown,
men cannot keep their own,
But every slave unknown
will reap what we have sown:
Yea, though we keep them by our side,
we now and then are hornify'd.
They have so many ways,
by nights or else by days,
That though our wealth decays,
yet they our horns will raise:
And many of them take a pride
to keep their Husbands hornify'd.
O what a case is this,
O what a grief it is,
My wife has learned to kiss,
and thinks it is not amiss:
She oftentimes does me deride,
and tells me I am hornify'd.
What ever I do say,
she will have her own way,
She scorneth to obey;
She Will take time while she may:
And if I beat her back and side,
In spite I shall be hornify'd.
May you would little think,
how they will friendly link,
And how they will sit and drink,
till they begin to wink:
And then if Vulcan will but ride,
Some Cuckold shall be hornify'd.
A woman that will be drunk,
will easily play the Punck;
For when her wits are sunk,
all keys will fit her Trunk:
Then by experience often is tried,
poor men that way are hornify'd.
Thus honest men must bear,
and it is in vain to fear,
For we are never the near
our hearts with grief to tear:
For while we mourn it is their pride,
the more to keep us hornify'd.
And be we great or small,
we must be at their call;
How e're the Cards do fall,
we men must suffer all:
Do what we can we must abide
the pain of being hornify'd.
The second Part, To the same Tune.
IF they once bid us go.
we dare not twice say no,
Although too well we know
It Is to out grief and woe:
Nay we are glad their faults to hide,
though often we are hornify'd.
If I my wife provoke,
with words in anger spoke,
She swears she will make all smoke,
and I must be her Cloak:
Her besenesse and my wrongs I hide,
and patiently am hornify'd.
When these good Gossips meet,
In Alley, Lane, or Street,
Poor men we do not see it,
with Wine and Sugar sweet,
They arm themselves, and then beside
their husbands must be hornify'd.
Not your Italian Locks,
which seems a Paradox,
Can keep these Hens from Cocks,
till they are paid with a P --
So long as they can go or ride,
They Will have their husbands hornify'd.
The more you have intent,
the business to prevent,
The more her mind is bent
your will to circumuent:
Such secret means they can provide
to get their husbands hornify'd.
For if we them do blame,
or tell them of their shame;
Although the men we name,
with whom they did the same:
They Will swear who ever spoke it ly'd,
Thus still poor men are hornify'd.
All you that single be,
avoid this slavery,
Much danger is you see
in women's company:
For he who to a Wife is tied,
May look still to be hornify'd.
Yet must I needs confess,
(though many do transgress)
A number, numberless,
which virtue do possess,
And to their Husbands are a guide:
by such no man is hornify'd.
They who are of that race,
this Ditie in any case
Is not to their disgrace,
they are not for this place:
To such this only is applied,
by whom good men are homily'd.
FINIS.
