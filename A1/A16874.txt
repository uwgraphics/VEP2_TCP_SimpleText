FINIS.
THese dialogues may suffice for this Book. The rest which remain, I have
omitted to translate, as not so fit: and refer you to Corderius, being more
pure Latin, and meater for children.

To the loving Reader.
GOod Reader, whereas I have been and am daily much called upon for performance
of my promise in publishing the translations mentioned in my Grammarschoole,
and this specially amongst others, as being through long custom accounted by
many very fit for the entrance of young scholars, to learn to speak and talk
in Latin, I have thought it equal to condescend unto their requests. And
herein I have labored to refer all the ouer-harsh Grammatical, translations
and phrases into the margent by an Asterisk, lest the children should learn
barbarism in our own tongue, (whereof they have perpetual and principal use)
whilst they seek to get the Latin; and to the end to teach them to utter the
Latin in our own phrase of speech. Also for so much as there are sundry
speeches unmeet to season the childrens minds, whereof some are Popish,
others profane and filthy, those I have for the most part omitted, or else
translated them in the best and most modest sense: On the one side having bin
afraid to leave any part of my promise unperformed, which should be thought
profitable; and more fearful on the other, to corrupt their tender minds or
manners, whilst I seek to do good to all. Upon this ground and occasion I
have omitted some few Dialogues, in the end of all, which are of this nature in
many things, viz. unsavory, Popish, or both; and refer both the reacher and
learner to Corderius Dialogues, which is of another strain, and far more
mere. For the use of it, I refer thee to that which I have ^duised in the
prefaces to the reader before Corderius, Sententiae, Cato, and my other
translations, and rest

Thine, still laboring for the common good^ I. Brinsley.
