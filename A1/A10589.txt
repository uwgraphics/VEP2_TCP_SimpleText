TO THE WORTHY AND HOPEFVLL GENTLEMAN, MASTER WILLIAM BOOTHE, Esquire: Son
and Heir to Sir GEORGE BOOTHE, Knight.
SJr, this Discourse was brought to me in Latin by some of my good friends,
who for that they could not pearce through the harsh and uncouth style into the
meaning of the Author, they prayed me to make the same more transparent by a
version thereof into English: which J have here done in a more explicate
manner, and have adventured to recommend the same to your patronage, as a
pledge of that affection, wherewith J do much respect you. Only J beseech you,
vt facias quod iam facis, that is, that you would advance that foundation of
learning and virtue, which you have already laid: and that you would endeavor
to couple together that rare society of Estate and worthiness, which so seldom
concur in one person: emulating the riches of your fortune, with the riches
of your mind: by which mean you shall return a noble retribution to that
house, from which by your Match you have received so much honor. And if you
shall please to accept this poor Piece in good part, you shall bind my care
hereafter to present you with an argument, both worthier for the strain, and
better suting with your quality. Jn the mean time I shall ever study to do
you service, and in your thoughts to deserve the estimation

Of your very loving Kinsman ROB. BOOTHE.

A DISCOVRSE FVLL OF DELIGHT, CONTAINING THE RELATION OF THE things which in
most parts of Europe have passed worthy the remembrance, since March last.
1614. to this present.
WWhen after the lamentable overthrow and death of Bathorie, Gabriel Bethline
had bin appointed Prince of Transyluania by the Turks, the Country was divided
into diverse factions: some, especially these who were next of blood to
Bathorie, being desirous to revenge his death, of whom many perished about
Medisa, being thrown headlong from the tower, many followed the Emperors
parts, taking Husta, and other places in his name, but the greatest part stuck
to Bethline, and submitted themselves to his obedience. The Turk understanding
the state of the country, writ his letters to the Nobility and Council of
Transyluania, to this effect; that they could not be ignorant, that from the
time that Transyluania lived under the government of his ancestors, and
himself, that the country continued in great peace aed quietness under their
protection: for that they had sundry times both desired and obtained aid from
his Court against their enemies, especially that Botteskay, when the
Transyluanians were but the other day molested by the Germans, being assisted
with his forces, overthrew the power of the Germans, and shaked their yoke
from their necks. After his death, when they saw that Bathora his successor
carried things according to his pleasure, and fell from his obedience, that
Bethline with the general consent of the Nobility, complained in that behalf
of him at his Court, and that he easily obtained means to oppress him, and
to free the Province from his tyranny. After whose overthrow and death, the
wished sunshine of peace and liberty began to appear, after that the clouds
of troubles had by his mean been dispersed. And now since the said Bethline
has addressed himself to his Court, and submitted himself to his order, that
he has judged him worthy to succeed Bathorius, and to obtain this
Principality; and therefore that he has commanded, that all the Nobles of the
country should submit themselves unto him, and obey his commandments, since
by this means they are like to enjoy their wished peace and rest. Furthermore,
that ye same Bethline has by letters advertised him of certain attempts of
the Germans, and in that regard knowing assuredly, that this Province is
settled under his protection, that he had forthwith given order to the
Commanders of Themsuard, and Agrium, and others, as also to the Prince of
Walachia, that they should have forces in readiness, and should be very
watchful at all times to repel all injuries that should be offered; yea that
he did advise the Nobles themselves, that they should at all times yield all
ready obedience to Bethline, so as they swerve not in the least point from his
commandment. And that he sent these letters to this end, that they should take
notice of his pleasure, and that they should give no assistance, to any
attempts of the Germans in this Province, whether they be secret or open, but
withstand them to their power, until the aides of Themesuard and Agrium did
come, and that in all things they should follow Bethline, esteeming him as
their true and lawful Prince, and continue constantly in his obedience, lest
they provoke his displeasure against them, and procure their own great misery.
Therefore that they should agree together, and be true to their Prince, nor
suffer any strangers to shuffle in amongst them, but that they should advise
with Bethline in all matters of importance, and entreat his pleasure for
assurance, taking heed that they do not rashly incline to one side or other.
Therefore in as much as they have continued in obedience to him, that they
ought not to doubt of his most mighty patronage, who meant always to provide
that they might live quietly and peaceably under the wings of his clemency.
But if they should fall from their allegiance, and shall not be obedient to
these his admonitions, that the end will be, that they shall be forced to melt
by his grievous displeasure, as the wax does by the fire, and so be consumed,
for that he will never endure that any should at his pleasure waste and spoil
Transyluania, a Province so nearely bordering upon his kingdom.

After the publication of these letters, he gave order, that certain pikes
should be sticked in the ground, before the gates of sundry the principal
Noble men and officers clean through Transyluania, in token that they should
die, that fell from Bethline his obedience, to the party of the Germans,
having placed in ambush certain companies, about Lippa and Geneum, which places
held still for the Emperor, by whom some of the Garrison soldiers, that
sallied out to try a fortune, were surprised, and slain every man. For which
cause, some of them being sent by their commander, came to Vienna to sue for
succor.

About the same time, a Turkish Ambassador came to Lints, with letters from the
great Turk to the Emperor; to this effect, that whereas he had concluded a
Peace with the Emperor for twenty years, that he had for his part been very
careful that nothing should be done against it; and that he had given strict
charge to his officers, whom he had placed upon the frontiers of his
territories, that they should give no offense to the Emperors subjects, and
that it was just and necessary that the Emperor should do the like, if he
wished that the Peace might continue without violation: but that now he
understood that the Emperor was raising forces especially against
Transyluania, which was a Province always subject to his Ancestors and him,
has received their Princes designed out of his Court, and being maintained
under his protection from all enemies has lived in peace in manner as other
Provinces have done that be subject to him. That where he understood that
Battory did command in that Province with tyranny, he sent an army lately to
depresse him, and to free his subjects from his cruelty: and now more, that
Battory being defeated, he had designed Gabriel Bethline a Prince of great
wisdom and valor, to govern the Country: and have ordered that he should
undertake the same with assurance of his help and assistance: but while he by
all means endeavored to do his commandment, that sundry ways this Peace
has been broken on the Emperors part, by the taking of the skonces of Husta
and Viuaria, and the towns of Nagipania and Tosnacum. Therefore that he
desires the Emperor, that as himself is careful by all means to conserve
the Peace, so if he be so affected for his part, that he would give order to
make restitution of the said places to the Prince of Transyluania, or at the
least, that he would please by this messenger to let him understand his
disposition: who by these letters of his may conceive how he stands affected to
the keeping of the said Peace. That the Peace was not at the first desired by
him; but the Emperor was the cause of making the same, which he does worthily
ascribe to his own most just victories: that now he has signified to the
Emperor what befitted his greatness to have done, and does desire yt he would
forbear these attempts, and make restitution of the places which he has
seized upon: for by so doing, the Peace is like to continue firm But if the
Emperor be otherways disposed, it shall hereby manifestly appear to the
world, whether of them has broken promise, and violated the Peace, and that
God will bring to pass, that which he has decreed. To conclude, that he
desires the Emperor that he do not long detain his messenger with him, but
with his letters give him a speedy dispatch, lest this long absence of his
should breed jealousy in him, that he stand not so carefully affected to the
conservation of the Peace.

This Messenger being honorably entertained, was dismissed with expedition,
with letters wrapped in cloth of gold, to this purpose, that the Emperor
having with the advice of the Electors, and Princes, and other Estates of the
Empire resolved touching the business, was ready to return an answer by
another Messenger, who was already advanced on his way to the Turks Court.
Therefore that the Turk should expect but a while, and in the mean time, he
should tempt nothing against the Peace.

Before this time, there had passed diverse leagues and confederacies, between
the States of the United Provinces, and certain of the Hanse towns. Which
example the town of Magdeburge being willing to follow, had determined to
enter into a league with them. The which the Elector of Saxony misliking, writ
his letters to the Town, that he understood from diverse places, that they
determined to enter into a league with foreign states, especially with the
states of the Low Countries: and although he conclude nothing of that
business, neither do much busy himself to understand the reasons which
moved them to do this, yet this he took notice thereof for this cause, because
he knew not whether they entered into this matter with the priuitie and
allowance of the Emperor, for if it were otherwise, they might easily
conceive how ill the Emperor would take it. And yet, that he by no means could
allow this Confederacy so needless and every way unnecessary, but seeing he
bare no less good will to this Commonweal, then his Ancestors had done, and
would be careful by all means, to keep and defend all harm from the same,
that he thought it necessary with all speed to dissuade them from this
league, from which nothing could arise, but exceeding displeasure in the mind
of the Archbishop of Magdeburge, and many other inconveniences beside. For if
they had this purpose in contracting this league, to undertake any hostility
against the Archbishop and his Diocese, by reason of the difference lately
grown between them, that they may easily think, that both himself and
other Princes and Electors, will not be wanting to assist him, as one that is
nearly linked to them in alliance. Seeing therefore he knows very well, that
the Electors and Princes will very shortly take pains to compound this
difference, that he hopes they will so carry themselves, that the Princes
shall have no cause to complain of them, and that the Archbishop will prove
himself such a one as desires not to press them with any new burden, but
will condescend that these dissentions and quarrels shall be determined
according to law and equity.

Besides these letters sent to the State of Magdeburge, he wrote other letters
to the same purpose unto the Emperor, that he understood not long since from
Christianus Gulielmus Archbishop of Magdeburge, Primate of Germany, the
Marquis of Brandenburge, and others, that the citizens of Magdeburge decreed to
make a league with the united States of the Belgicke Provinces, and that the
foresaid Archbishop has signified, that the same if it should come to pass,
would both be displeasing to him, and would prove heavy and dangerous to his
Diocese, and withal by their joint letters to the Emperor, entreated that
he would stop this intended league, and admonish the Senate and Citizens to
yield obedience and respect to his pleasure. That this message was very
displeasing to him, and that they could not see, what reason the Magdeburgers
had, without the Emperors knowledge to affect this league, and to give
occasion to the Archbishop suspiciously to gather matter of fear and
jealousy. Seeing therefore he holds this request of the Archbishop very just
and reasonable, and that in these places it is not fit to give occasion to draw
on new dangers and troubles, but rather maturely to meet with them, especially
in this dangerous and hard estate wherein Germany stands, that by all means
he does humbly beseech the Emperor, that he considering the equity of the
Archbishops request, would interpose his authority to dehort the Magdeburgers
from their purpose, and graciously to draw them to yield obedience to their
Archbishop. The Emperor having received these letters, dissuaded the
Magdeburgers from this intended confederacy: by which mean, the Citizens also
of Brunswicke, who had joined with them in this negotiation, returned out of
the low Countries without any proceeding at all.

In the month of February was published an Edict by the Illustrious John
Sigismund, Marquis and Elector of Brandenburge, by way of reformation to be
executed in the Churches of Brandenburge, directed to the Ecclesiastical
Governors of the whole Electorate of Brandenburge, of both sides the Odera,
whereby they are commanded to forbear railing and and contentious behavior;
especially in their Sermons. That godly and faithful Magistrates, have in all
times and places, thought it a part of their duty, to use al means to stop
unnecessary contentions and disputations, who in diverse places do in their
public Sermons bitterly inueigh against other Churches, as well within as
without the Empire, whereof they were never appointed judges, seeing their
manner of disputations, are undertaken against Christian charity, and avail
more to hinder then to promote the edification of ye Church, that the most
renouned Princes and Dukes of Brunswike, and Luneburg, who lived the year
1562. Augustus, the Elector of Saxony, who lived the year 1566. Christianus
the first Elector of Saxony, and John Frederike of Ligsnits; the year 1601. who
did the same in the name of the Churches of the lower Saxony, left notable
examples hereof, and worthy all imitation, that we need not mention higher
examples of antiquity. The transaction passed with other Electors and Princes,
of whom many yet do embrace the doctrine of Luther, does persuade and command,
that a course should be taken, that by a godly moderation used in preaching,
offenses and troubles of consciences may be avoided. Therefore that all men may
easily judge how displeasingly he has taken it, and how much he has been
affected, that hitherto of long time he has heard, that not of all, but of
many in his Electorate, and indeed such, who being moved with ambition rather
then zeal of Piety, are likely persons either to do least, if they were
brought to a just trial in argument, or to fall to the Popish party, if they
could make but six pence more, should fill al Churches and Pulpits with their
imprecations, criminations, calumnies, cursings and such like outcries, seeking
rather glory with men then with God: little regarding whether they speak true
or false: and whether it were convenient or inconvenient to so holy a place, so
as they might gall, and bite other Christians, satisfy their humors, spend
their choler, and move laughter to our common enemies, the Jesuits, and other
Papists, and give them occasion to slander us, by this means heaping up the
displeasure of God against them and their Auditorie in the day of judgment.
That the holy Scripture does teach us far otherwise: for it does not warrant,
that they who agree with us in the ground of Religion, and steadfastly resolve
to be saved by the only grace and mercy of God, for and through the merit of our
only Savior Jesus Christ, all other means quite excluded, who also labor
with us in the vineyard of Christ, and therefore do suffer innumerable
persecutions from the common enemies of true Religion, the Pope and his
Ministers; nay more, who with great cheerfulness and plenty do even spend
their blood for this Confession, should be excluded out of the Church of
Christ. Neither would the holy Scripture, that that which is doubtful, should
be argued by accusations and slanders, which is proper to Satan, or by
conjectures and false allegations, but by the infallible word of God. Therefore
that he does ordain and severely charge, that all Pastors and Ministers of
Churches, do in the Churches purely and sincerely teach and propound to their
Auditors the word of God, out of the Prophelike and Apostolic writings, the
four Symbols received in the Church: the Augustane confession reformed, and
the Apology thereof, without all deprauation, and omitting all
interpretations, and phrases, and new forms brought in by idle and ambitious
Divines, that they endeavor to gain souls to Christ, and direct all their
labors to advance the glory of God, and the salvation of men: and on the other
side, that they wholly abstain from criminations, and reprehensions of other
Churches, which neither are subject to them, nor convicted of error by any
lawful and ordinary course: not branding them with any name of Heretic, for
that he being urged in his conscience can no longer wink at these things, but
has determined when he shall know that any, whosoever he be, does offend
against this commandment, (which cannot be hid from him long,) that first he
will summon him to appear at his Court, there first by speech to check his
folly, and if he can do good with admonitions, either to remove him from his
place, or chastise him with some punishment: and courses besides shall be
taken for obstinate fellows, who upon summons do not appear at our Court,
whereby they may easily be brought to obedience. But if there be any who being
carried with an intemperate zeal, suppose by this means that a curb is laid
upon their consciences, that he will not be against it, but that they may
give over their Ministry, and with leave depart out of his Electoratship, and
go to those places where they may be suffered to rage; and to wound
Christians, to curse and execrate, expecting at the last from God a just
reward of their intemperate fury.

Lastly, that he doubts not, but that as this Edict has been published by him,
by the prescript of the word of God, to keep the Peace, tranquillity and
concord in the Churches of those countries, which by God are committed to him,
in these last and dangerous times, wherein the Antichrist of Rome seems more
then ever before to thirst after Christian blood, all and every one, in regard
of the commandment of God, whereby subjects are by the Apostle commanded to
be obedient to their Magistrates, that they will conform themselves to
obedience, and take care not to provoke his displeasure against them, lest they
be forced to try to their loss and grief, that they bear not the sword in
vain: the heads of the Articles, according to which this reformation was to be
practiced in the Churches, were said to be these.

That images should be banished out of the Churches: the Altars that were made
in time of Popery, to be demolished, and long tables of wood to be set in
their places, covered with a black carpet, and a white cloth upon it, when
the Supper is to be administered: That the statues, images and crosses, drawing
their beginning from Popery, are to be removed out of the Churches. That their
holy Palles are no more to be used. Candles not to be lighted. Auricular
Confession to be laid aside. Prayers in the Pulpit to be delivered not
submissely, but with a loud voice. That in time of danger, especially in the
time of Plague, the Supper of the Lord is not to be given to the sick. The
Decalogue and Catechism to be better reformed. That the blessed Trinity is to
be represented by no images, either graven or painted; the words of the holy
Supper to be understood and expounded, in the true and right sense: with some
other Articles as it was reported.

Some years past, and before the Peace made with the confederate States of
Holland, a Seafaring man of Holland, had been taken by the Masters of the
Spanish Inquisition, and had been condemned to the fire for a Psalm book
only which was found in his custody, but by some strange device he escaped
that danger; but afterward returning into the same place again, as being
secure from fear, by reason of the League, he was again taken by the
Inquisitors: and notwithstanding the intercession of the States to the
Archduke, who writ to the King in the prisoners behalf, he was condemned and
burnt alive.

His kinsfolks have made many complaints to the States for this cruelty, and
to revenge the same, have entreated earnestly, that they may have leave to
sail into the West Indies.

About the beginning of April was an honorable meeting of the Electors and
Princes at Naumburge in Thuring, the Elector of Saxony with his brother
Augustus, the Elector Brandenburge, and many other Princes, to conclude and
advise of the hereditarie league between the noble families of Saxony,
Brandenburge, and Hassia, of the precedencie of the houses of Vinaria and
Alkenburge, and of the doubtful and controuersed business touching Gulicke and
Iuliers.

In the mean time, ielousies and unkindness every day increasing between the
Princes of Brandenburge and Newburge, many of the Electors and Princes labored
to bring them to accord. But the States of Cleueland assembling together,
agreed to incline to neither side of the foresaid Princes, nor to allow any
contribution to them, until they were assured of their true successor and
Master, and at once sending their letters to the Archduke Albert, to the
Elector of Collen, and to the Estates of the united Provinces of Belgium,
requested them that they would have no hand in this business, but that they
would leave it to be determined between the Princes themselves: to whom the
Elector of Collen answered, that for the great desire he had of peace, he
would be very unwilling that any war should arise, especially in the Empire,
and Countries neighboring upon him; and yet if the Prince of Newburge should
have any wrong done him in his right pretense, that by no means he might
forsake him, and sending to Dusseldorpe Reckius his Ambassador, exhorted the
Princes who were seized of some places, to lessen their train. And although
they fell to the number of twenty five attendants, yet the Brandenburgian
presently changing his purpose, after that the Newburgians, laying aside their
arms which they carried closely; that is, Pistols, and other weapons, which
might be tied under their cloakes; and walking only with their swords by
their sides, answered, that he also would willingly condescend to all reason
and equity, especially in the determining of the question of succession
between them: and forthwith departing to Gocha, within the Principality of
Cleue, he sent his Ambassadors to the Estates of the united Provinces, who by
all means exhorted both the Princes to avoid trouble, and to conserve peace.

But when the Estates understood that the King of Spain had commanded his
soldiers to be in a readiness, they also gave order to have Wagons provided,
that if necessity required they might carry their soldiers thither, where the
Spanish forces should bend. Which provision gave the Archduke occasion to write
to them, to this effect. That he lately was advertised by the Estates and
Counselors of the Dukedom of Cleue, of differences growing between the
Illustrious Princes, George William of Brandenburge, and Wolfangus William of
Newburge, and of the dangers which thereby hang over the whole Country, with a
request also from them, that to his power he would for the conservation of the
common peace, meet with these difficulties. Therefore that he being moved with
the request of them of Cleue, and also for that it imported him very much, that
his neighbors should live in peace, had by his letters advised the Princes,
that as lovers of peace they would entertain love and concord, and with all
diligence avoid troubles, adding withal a protestation, that he in regard of
the peace and right he has to maintain over those places, that he of
necessity must be an enemy to him, who is the first author to move any stir.
And although he doubt not but that they are of the same mind with him, and
will not suffer that any door should be open to so great dangers and troubles,
yet that he was willing to desire them, that if they thought good, themselves
would bestow some pains to conserve the public peace, which will very soon be
violated and disturbed in these parts, if these Princes should fall together by
the ears.

There was offered to the Emperor about the beginning of April, the
declaration of Wolfangus William Prince of Newburge, his submission in the
Mulheme business. But the Elector of Brandenburge would in no sort submit the
business to be desided by the Emperors Council of Court, but endeavored by
all means that it might be remitted to the Imperial Chamber; in which
behalf he wrote to the Emperor to this effect. In that he had not to this
time returned an answer to the Emperors letters, touching a new hearing of
the business of Iuliers, that he did it not of purpose, nor of any intent to
delay the matter, but for weighty considerations which hindered him. But that
indeed there are many reasons which hinder that he may not condescend to yield
to this treaty of the business: for that it is evident by the relation of the
Count Hoelsoller, sent from Erford to the Emperor the last year, how
deceitfully he was dealt withal, who having nothing but honey upon their
tongue, did by all means study to besmeare his face. And since this happened
by the foresaid Earl, who professes himself a kinsman of his house, and is
by oath obliged to him, for his hereditarie Office of the Chamber, which he
holds of him, that he may easily imagine how far he is to trust others in
this cause, who are not in that place of relation to him. And surely that his
fear and jealousy is not a little increased by that same dangerous and most
pernicious decree in the business of Mulheme, which a few days ago John
Ludouike of Vlmes, bearing the Chancellors person in the Emperors Court,
procured to be intimated to him, although in the whole year nothing was done
to his knowledge in that cause in the Court, not so much as by way of ordinary
talk. Whereby it may easily appear what affection the Emperors officers
carry toward him. Although therefore he has good reason to look to
himself, being admonished by these former steps, nor to commit any thing that
may concern him to such kind of men* notwithstanding passing by all these
things, to show his care to yield to the Emperor his due respect, that he
submits his cause to this treaty, with this condition, if first he may
understand, whether and how these other competitors do submit themselves.
Secondly, if it proceed not further then is fit to proceed in a friendly
hearing, and that he may be at no prejudice, if they cannot agree, or any
decree be made that is hurtful to him: but that all things be left in the
same state they were before the treaty, until this business be determined in
a lawful manner. Furthermore, since he has taken the possession of the
Principality of Iuliers in a manner lawful, and by all law to be allowed,
(considering what the Archduke Leopald, and the Bishop of Passauium have done)
and that the Emperor himself has passed his promise, which he has reason to
believe, to maintain every one in his possession, nor to remove him from it,
but by a lawful decision of the business going before, that it is a needless
thing to trouble the treaty with the point of the possession, which is only to
be directed to the point of challenge for the right: otherwise if they do, that
he will admit no treaty at all, seeing also unless he be admitted in the
participation of the Fee: yet without prejudice to others, he may easily
perceive that for the point of the challenge he should be neglected, that he
does beseech the Emperor that he would also confer upon him this Fee, as
has been done to others, and so make him equal to the rest; and that he
hopes, that the Emperor will choose into this business Arbitrators honest and
swayed with no prejudice, nor enclining to either side, but indifferent and
equally affected to them both. Lastly, since he is not ignorant, that certain
have gone about to persuade the late Emperor, that he has some interest as
Lord Paramount over these countries, and that this dirictum Dominium, so
called, and the prerogative of the Emperor annexed to it, may not be called
into question: that he desires of the Emperor, that he may understand what
he may expect from him in this point, and that with convenient speed. Therefore
when he has received answer to all these things, and that the certain time,
when this hearing shall begin, be set down by the Emperor, that he will
take care that no want be found in him. Other matters he would have referred
to this future hearing, but that he beseeches the Emperor not to be
offended with him, but that he would preserve his right to him, no less then
to others. That he could have received this answer, and his exception to the
time that this Treaty begins, but to save time and expense, and that the
Emperor may see the sincerity of his mind, which he brings to the handling of
this business: that he was willing aforehand to open his mind to the Emperor,
before any entrance into the matter, to whom he professes himself most ready
to do all service.

About the end of April was taken a Pirates ship, which carried in her above
60. brass pieces, and was very rich beside, which lay in wait upon the coast
of Ireland, for four Holland ships, which a little after came out of Ginnie
very richly laden with gold and spice: she was carried to Amsterdam.

There came at the same time into Holland, Ambassadors from Muscouia, whom the
Estates caused to be brought with a great train from Leiden to the Hage, the
11. of May, being admitted into the Council house, they declared in a long
speech, that their great Duke, did by all means desire the friendship of the
Estates, and desired them that they would furnish him with money and shipping
against his enemies: being there willed to exhibit in writing this their
request, they did so. But when it did not appear, what profit might return to
the States out of Muscouie, they fearing lest they might offend the King of
Poland, after deliberation, made them this answer conceived in writing,
whereby they might assure the great Duke of Musco of their friendly minds, and
great good will toward him, and so dismissed them with royal intertainement,
and great gifts. Count Maurice presenting to them a gallant show of a battle,
according to the true manner of Military discipline, which they beheld with
great admiration.

Suigelius the Master of the horse, having assaied Dusseldorpe, Cleue, and
other places, when all his secret practices would not prevail, at the last was
received into Gulick by the Governor Pythamius, with whom he had secretly
plotted the same before, bringing into the town diverse companies of the
Estates soldiers. For when Pythamius did see that the Castle of Gulicke was in
great danger, by reason of the unkindness, which every day grew more and more
among the posseding Princes and their friends, the Brandenburgian and
Newburgian garrisons, being ready to fall to blows, he thought it the fittest
way to draw in these companies of the Estates. The Captains of the garrison
soldiers, as well Brandenburgians as Newburgians, being ignorant of any
practice, forth with took arms: but being persuaded by the said Governor, and
Suigelius, Hancrote, Bonnus, and other Commanders of those forces, that it was
for the good of both the Princes, the Bandenburgians were pacified: but the
Newburgians giving no credit to them, made sharp resistance, till after some
blows, and slaughter of diverse, they came to agreement, and were contented.
Which done, Hancrote and Bonnus having commission for that business from Grave
Maurice, continued in the Castle with their forces, and have since strengthened
the fame with 7. companies of horse and foot, drawn out of the United
Provinces, making besides great provision of victual and other necessaries to
keep the place.

Which when the Prince of Newburge understood, he arrested certain Officers
and Councellers of the Prince of Brandenburg, remaining at that time at
Dusseldorpe: and dispatching Messengers to diverse places, exhorted the Officers
of Cities and Governors of Castles, that, as mindful of the oath they had
taken, they would keep diligent watch in their towns, and use all
circumspection against such manner of trains and practices. But for the
defense of the City, he thought good to let in the soldiers; which when the
Burgers did earnestly withstand, he invited all the chief Senators to a
banquet, in which time certain Musqueteirs, slipping out at the Posterne gate,
made themselves masters of the town watch, and let in the Country soldiers,
who the next day were bestowed at the Gates, their number increasing every day,
and bulwarks and forts raised against the gates. In the mean time, the
soldiers of the Estates assaulted the Monastery of Scheiuenhem, and they of
Brandenburge the Monastery of Siburge, but both in vain. But when the Archduke
heard of the news of the surprising of the Castle of Gulicke: forthwith he
mustered his soldiers, and made preparation for this journey; the United
Estates also doing the like, which bred such a fear among the Country people
of Iuliers, that they took al their goods, and carried them to Vtright, Leids,
Collen and other places.

There was mention made in our former books of the affairs of Aken, and for
them we are now come to the Commination of the proscription. Therefore the
Elector of Heidelberge writing his letters to the King of France, desired him
that he would in time interpose his authority: who without delay dispatched
his letters to the Elector of Collen, to dehort him from the execution of the
sentence: that the decree of the Emperor against the city of Aken, to strike it
with the thunderbolt of Proscription, for those things which there fell out in
the time of the vacancy, in the name of his kinsman the Palatine Administrator,
and under the title of his Vicariat in the Empire, was very displeasing to him;
therefore waighing the danger, which by the execution of this sentence seems
to threaten the Peace of Germany, which it concerns nearly, that this city
should be preserved, that he as a Christian Prince, whose part it is, by all
means to maintain the public Peace among the Confederate Princes of the
kingdom, that he could not forbear to put him in mind of the mischievous and
dangerous issue; which peradventure this execution may have, therefore that he
desires, that he would please to take notice from Praeaustie his Ambassador,
residing in Flanders, of those things, which he has given him in charge,
especially on the behalf of his kinsman the Palatine Elector.

These letters were sent to the Kings Ambassador Mounsier de Preux, with other
letters besides to him to this purpose. That he has sent to him the copies of
those letters, which he had received from the Elector Palatine, in the matter
of the Aken-busines, which passed during the vacancie, and when the Vicariate
of the Empire fell to him, that by them understanding what he challenges to
belong to him, touching the execution of the Proscription decreed against this
city, and committed to the Archduke Albert, and Elector of Collen, and of the
right, which the Palatine Elector in this cause pretends to belong to him, he
may observe and discern how much the Palatine does promise to himself for the
conservation of the peace in Germany by the interseding of his authority with
these Commissioners. Seeing therefore there hangs no small danger over whole
Germany by this execution, especially if the Princes joining together, shall
earnestly oppose themselves against it, that he has sent him letters, written
to the Elector of Collen, and charge him to deliver them to him, and that he
would propound to his consideration the weight of the whole business, as also
the declaration of the right which he has, in hindering this endeavor of his
against the Palatine Elector, and the dangerous accidents tending to the
mischief not only of the city of Aken, but also of the whole Empire,
together with the demimution of the authority and honor of the Emperor: and
that he write back withal speed to advertise him how far he has
prevailed with him.

In the former books, we spoke of the broiles which were raised in France,
with a commemoration of the grieuances exhibited to the Queen by certain
principal personages, and the answer to the same. And seeing it concerned the
Commonwealth very much, that the seeds of troubles should be choked in the
very bud, and the sparkles of fire quenched in the very kindling, before they
be able to take flame, Jews the most Christian King, when he understood that
a meeting was appointed by the Princes at Soissons, the 7. of April,
incontinently sent certain of his Counselors thither, who should give remedy
to their grieuances, and friendly compose all differences, furnished with
letters of credence to this effect; that as before he had sent them to Soisson,
that they might treat with the Prince of Condie, and others there assembled, so
at this time especially He, the Queen Mother, and the rest of the Counselors
and Princes consenting, does will, and give them full power, that look what
conditions they shall think honest and indifferent, for the mature composing
of their troubles, they should accept, and assure in his name, that they shall
be faithfully observed in Court, and that they do all things, which he
himself would do, if he were there present. And if so be that this Treaty
shall require any more special commission, that he does promise in the faith
and word of a King, that whatsoever shall in this business be done,
transacted, concluded, decreed, and promised, that he will hold it, ratum and
gratum: that is, it should be as strong, and as well pleasing to him, as if he
had done it himself, and that he will by special edicts give commandment,
that it be executed, and this power shall every one have, although they shall
be hindered either through sickness, or any business, that they could not be
there. This Treaty failed not of his wished profit: for they agreed upon
certain articles of Peace, which were afterward ratified at San-Manehold, to
wit, that upon the summons of a general Parliament, all the States of the
kingdom should assemble at Seen, the 25. of August: and there it should be
lawful for the deputies of the three Orders, to propound those things, which
in their conscience they shall find to be profitable for the good of the
Commonweal, and ease of the subjects, that so the King upon advice with his
kinsfolk and other Princes, may in convenient manner, publish wholesome
constitutions, renew ancient decrees, and annull and abrogate Orders made to
the destruction of the subject. That the marriages undertaken with the
Spaniard, should remain in their full force, seeing the Queen Mother has by
her letters, given sufficient reason for them to the Prince of Condie, that the
bulwarks of the Castle of Messeron, should be thrown down, and that the
request of the Duke of Niuerne should be satisfied, touching a certain sum
of money, which he demands of the King, for building of a house in liew of
that, which he had at Massera, which was thrown down, when the castle was
builded. That the Castle of Blauet, which in the time of these troubles was
seized, and began to be fortified, should be razed to the ground, and the
place to be left in the same state as it was before the troubles, the Captain
and guard removed out of it; which Order must be conceived generally to extend
to the rest of the castles and forts, which were every where raised in the
Province, during the troubles. That for avoiding and discharging the charges
and inconveniences, which the subjects endured by the soldiers, as well French
as strangers, which were hitherto levied, and diuerfly scattered in the
kingdom, in the name of the King and Prince of Condie, from the Kalends of
January, al soldiers on both sides should be dismissed, and the strangers
should within twelve days from the ratification of these Articles be conveyed
out of the kingdom by Commissioners deputed by the King and Prince, and the
French soldiers should within the said time, withdraw themselves to their own
houses, under the pain appointed for vagabonds and rogues. That the Prince of
Condie by the Kings permission, shall keep the town and castle of Amboyse,
with 100. garrison soldiers for his security, until the time of the general
Parliament. That the Duke of Vendosme, if he return to his house, and rest
contented with these Articles, should be restored to his place, and enjoy his
former honor as before, all manner of inhibitions being taken away and
abolished by the public Edicts, that they may prejudice nor hurt him any more.
That he received money of the chief of the Province to maintain his army,
the King should allow. Likewise for one whole year complete, the King should
maintain the forces appointed for Machen, and Bell Isle, if the Captain of
Retse shall require the same. That the damage, which was done to Monsieur de
Camore at Hennebon, where he is Commander, should be recompensed, and he
restored to his former office and dignity. That all companies of soldiers
brought into the cities and towns of this Kingdom, during this commotion from
the Kalends of January until this time, should be dissolved, except 100.
soldiers at Massire, and 200. at Soisson, under the command of the Duke de
Maine, which are to continue until the Parliament be finished, seeing that
other Cities and Towns should be restored to their former estate. That the
King by his letters sent to all the Parliament, should signify and make known
that he is sufficiently persuaded, that the Prince of Condee and other officers
of the kingdom, of what estate and condition soever, who followed them in this
commotion, attempted nothing of any evil purpose, neither did fall from their
obedience due to the King, adding a necessary both excuse, and assurance, that
they need not be called into question for them, but that they should be again
restored to their former Dignities and Offices, and enjoy the profits of them
as before: And that letters should be dispatched to the confederate Princes and
Estates, and that they should truly understand with all speed by certain fit
Messengers for that purpose, what the King does assuredly know touching the
innocence and loyal affection of the Prince of Condee and other officers. That
the King shall pay to the Prince of Condee for the charges of him and other
officers during these troubles, the sum of four hundred and fifty thousand
pounds to be divided by him among the Princes and other Officers. These
matters thus being ordered, and allowed and confirmed by the King, the Prince
of Condee, and other Princes and Officers of the kingdom disclaimed and
renounced all confederacies undertaken either within the kingdom, or without,
and promised never to enter into any league any more. On the other side, the
King granted to the Duke of Niuerne his letters Patents, to him and his eldest
son of the government of Champaine.

These businesses in this manner being passed, and all agreement signed and
sealed by the King himself, the Queen Mother being President, and also by the
Prince of Condee, and Ventadurius, the Duke of Bullion, and other Princes, the
Prince of Condie wrote his letters to the Queen Mother, wherein he professed
that both in regard of her great good will before time declared unto him, and
also for the great favor she had done him in this present treaty, that he
acknowledged himself so much obliged to her, that he could not forbear to
give her great thanks for this royal affection of hers toward him: but he
did beseech her that she would weigh courteously and equally with her self by
what freenes of mind he was impelled to undertake these businesses, who if he
might have lived without the malice of adversaries that lay in wait to
surprise his honor and estate, had never proceeded so far, neither had any
stir been made in the kingdom. But now all matters being stilled and quieted
by the grace of God, and the wisdom of the Queen, that he did earnestly
beseech her that she would so order and govern all things hereafter, that no
occasion may be offered to the renewing of the like Commotions; for that he
for his part would always be most ready in his place to perform all manner of
service to the King his master.

While these things passed in France, there appeared at Prage, and through all
Bohemia a Sun Circle called Paralia, and two Suns seemed to appear in
heaven. At Nemeth in Hungary, a fountain near to the walls of the City
brake forth with great force into streams of blood, almost by the space of an
hour. At Butoarium a woman brought forth a monster, resembling a Seafish. And
another woman in a village not above a mile from Prage, brought forth a child
with one body, but fearfully shaped, with four hands, and four feet, which
lived until the next day. A little before in Carinthia it rained a kind of red
grain, whereof there was baked good bread, which was brought over by certain
Merchants from Villacum. And even at this time was seen in the air a red
Cross, not without great wonder and terror to the beholders.

Almost about the same time, being the fifteenth of May, Wolfangus William
neglecting the Augustane Confession, fell to the Pope, and embraced the Roman
Religion, and at a Mass, which was celebrated in the parish Church of
Dusseldorpe, with great solemnity and all manner of music, he with his wife
received the Sacrament after the Popish manner. Afterward a Sermon was made by
the Deane of the Church, out of the third Chapter of John, wherein also the
reasons were delivered, for which the Prince had withdrawn himself into the
bosom of the Romane-Catholicke Church. After a few days a Nuncio came from
the Pope, accompanied with certain Capuchine Monks, to Dusseldorpe, to
confer plenarie absolution and benediction upon the Prince, and to exhort him
to constancy.

This revolt and change of Wolfangus bred great sorrow and grief in the mind
of Philip Ludouicke Prince of Newburge the father, and since that which was
done could not be undone, being sollicitors in the behalf of his subjects,
exhorted them to fall to prayer for the conseruing of the sincere and wholesome
doctrine of the Gospel, and to that end published an Edict to be observed by
all the Pastors of the Churches to this effect. For as much as he has ordained
and commanded all the Pastors and Ministers which is in the Principality of
Newburge, that they carefully providing against this present necessity, and the
eminent fearful change of Religion, that not only they themselves do meet
in the Churches every Monday at twelve of the clock, to power forth prayers to
God with their hearers, but also that they be careful that the same be done by
the Ministers and Preachers under their Jurisdiction, that he does straightly
command and enjoin them all that they give good example to their hearers, and
that they the time and place aforesaid, and together with their Auditors, men,
women, and children, and their whole families, they do beseech the Lord to
turn away the danger, which now is at hand, and that in the solemnizing of
public prayers, they do premise a general admoninion in this manner.

Besides the calamities and manifold punishments, wherewith the Lord has
chastised these Countries for their manifold transgressions, that now it is
greatly to be feared, lest they be deprived of the greatest treasure which
they have in this world; that is, the purity of the word of God, and that the
famine which the Prophet speaks of do fall upon these Countries. That they
all had deserved this punishment through their unthankfulness, security, and
contempt of the word of God, yet is to be hoped, that if turning to God with
their whole hearts, they shall repeat and implore the goodness of God, and
do present their supplications to him against the dismission of the sincere
Preachers of the word of God* and the change of religion, which will in time
prove hurtful to them and their posterity: it may come to pass, that God for
the merit and intercession of his son, and for the glory of his most holy
name, may repent him of his purpose, and may leave his blessing amongst them,
that they may yet longer enjoy the great Supper of his, to which they have been
invited. Therefore to this end that God is to be inuocated with ardent prayers,
and true groves, in this manner. O eternal God, etc.

But when this unexpected change of Prince Wolfangus Guilielmus, bred diverse
thoughts in the minds not only of the Courtiers and Counselors, but also of
the commons of those countries, who professed the Augustane and reformed
religion: the Prince to pacify them and to hold them within the compass of
their obedience, published an Edict, wherein he declared, that he had no
intention to make any disturbance among his subjects in the point of religion:
that he did not only hear by relation, but observed it himself: that many of
his Officers, Counselors and other Ministers, as also of his subjects dwelling
in cities and villages, are much troubled and perplexed in regard of his
Christian conversion, and public confession, and this his transition to the
ancient Roman Church, as if by reason of the evident and known difference of
religions, he meant not to maintain them in the exercise of the religion, but
in the point of religion would make innovation, and force them to embrace the
confession of a contrary religion. Therefore that no occasion may be taken of
alteration, and of change of allegiance and duty due unto him, especially in
these touchy and dangerous times. And for as much he never intended any such
thing, that he thought good by these letters to testify, that he has
resolved not only to depart from the covenants and mutual obligations passed,
but also with all his power to withstand them, who shall depart from the same,
and to direct all his actions to the glory of God, the safety of his country,
and to the preservation of justice, which is equally to be administered to all,
without any respect of religion. And that he hops well, that all and every of
his Counselors, Officers, Commanders and subjects, will constantly continue in
their due obedience. For they who shall do the contrary, and fall away from
their duty and alleagance, shall no longer enjoy their commodities and
privileges, which either they received of their ancestors, or have obtained by
covenant and mutual obligation. These letters being published the 14. of June,
when it was given out that the Prince of Brandenburge went about to bring in
the reformed religion, he also by his Proclamation professed, that every man
shall enjoy his religion, and that none under his government shall suffer any
trouble for his conscience sake.

Now for the extinguishing of the unkindness grown between the Princes of
Brandenburge and Newburg, and to compose all controversy in a friendly manner,
there was a meeting appointed the 10. of June, at Wesel, whether the Elector of
Collen and the united Estates sent their Ambassadors. Who when they persuaded
the Newburgians, that they should within three days dismiss their soldiers
at Dusseldorpe, both the garrison soldiers and the mustered also, and that they
should forbear to fortify the town. The Newburgians wondering at this their
Order, answered, that if Gulick were restored into her former estate, that they
would be ready to do what lay in them: but rather then they would yield
consent to the division of the country, they would first try all manner of
extremity. Therefore when neither part would yield from their right, that
meeting was frustrated.

The Newburgians returning home, when the Prince understood the demands of the
united Estates, to show himself inclinable for his part, conceived in writing
certain Articles, by which he supposed a composition might be made, and
caused it to be presented to the Estates: That the whole treaty at Wesel
consisted in this, that the United Estates did hold, that the army mustered by
the Duke of Newburge should be dismissed: on the contrary, in the behalf of
the Prince, it was declared not only for what reasons that army was levied,
but also how necessary it was, that the army should be withdrawn from Gulick,
and that town to be reduced to his former estate. Therefore when as the
Estates themselves have by their letters declared, that they gave warrant to
their Commissioners, to compose by way of provision at the least al
controversies between the Princes, and to provide, that as well their subjects
as neighbors, should be preserved from al danger and trouble. Notwithstanding
that ielousies and distrust have not a little grown by this, that against his
priuitie and consent, and otherwise then he had deserved of them, he was
dispossessed of the Castle of Gulicke, and his garrison soldiers put out of
it, which possession and detention has been hitherto continued, under a
pretense of a common benefit to both the Princes: whereby it is no hard matter
to conceive, what suspicions are like to arise thereby in the Empire,
especially with the Emperor himself, who is chief Lord of the Fee, and other
Electors and Princes, pretending any title to those countries, that he should
be so disturbed, in a possession purchased with such danger, charge and
travel, and the sequestration before time so much misliked by the Estates of
the low Countries, and with many reasons oppugned against the Archduke
Leopalde, should there so easily be allowed. Seeing therefore there is danger,
lest those that love not the Prince should draw this innovation into suspicion,
and make that construction, that it should be thought, that more respect was
given to the Estates of the United Provinces, then to the Emperor himself,
(whom the Prince does acknowledge the chief Magistrate, and Lord of the Fee)
but also would offend the Emperor, and provoke him to enter into a new
Process against the posseding Princes, and so would draw into danger a
possession hitherto, procured with great travel and charge, to the great
prejudice of the Prince, the which notwithstanding the Prince is loath to
conceive of the Estates united, since by many letters they have abundantly
declared their good affection toward him, therefore that the Prince doubts
not, but that the Commissioners deputed by the Electors and Estates united, to
compound this business, considering these reasons, will do their best endeavor,
that restitution maybe made of the castle of Gulick, and of all the
appurtenances thereto. For first of all, that the Prince of Newburg will not
refuse, (if the Prince of Brandenburge will do the same) at the first before
any restitution made, to bind himself by his hand and seal, and to promise in
the word of a Prince, that he will attempt nothing against the Prince of
Brandenburg either now or hereafter, but in all points will keep the
conditions agreed upon, and will be a faithful and equal keeper of the castle
of Gulicke, as also of the castles, towns, skonces, and cities of these
countries, without any man's prejudice, for the behoof and use of him who shall
be the lawful successor and possessor, that he will deliver them to no third
person, whosoever he be, that he will not usurp no more power over them,
then the Prince of Brandenburge, but will govern and moderate all matters as
before in an indifferent course of friendship, even until the controversy be
finally decided. But to take away the difficulty which may happen, about the
placing of an indifferent Governor in the castle, that the Prince of Newburge
shall be well contented, that by the full consent of the Princes, or of the
Estates of the country, a certain number of the Noble men of the country, fit
for such a business should be deputed, and from that time after, that the
Governors, Commanders, Lieutenants, and other officers, be chosen by lot,
such as may yield to each Prince their due obedience, and may afterward submit
themselves to him, to whom the succession shall be adjudged: in the mean time
that they do their service to both the Princes, and to the whole country, and
be maintained by them: taking diligent heed, that no foreign soldiers come in
amongst them, or that their forces be increased without the priuitie of the
Princes, a a law certain also to be made, which should be observed in
admitting either of the posseding Electors and Princes. Therefore whatsoever
either of the foresaid Princes shall reciprocally promise one to the other,
that the Deputies of the Princes Electors, and of the United Provinces, should
not only subscribe and confirm with their seals, but should promise to
procure, that the same shall be allowed and received of the subjects of their
Principality, the letters of ratification and allowance, being sent to each
party mutually, within the next month after the transaction and agreement
concluded. Furthermore, that the Emperors consent also, as the Lord
Pararamount is to be entreated, and the Kings of France and Britanny to be
requested, not only by the Archbishop of Collen, and the estates of the united
Provinces, but also of both the Princes, besides the neighbor Electors and
Princes, that they would hold this transaction firm and stable, and would
defend each part, and maintain against all unjust force. That the Counselors
of each part be admonished, that they rest upon this transaction, and attempt
nothing against it. Besides a Parliament to be summoned, and that both the
Princes should earnestly endeavor that the Estates of the Country be bound, to
the co^seruing of this transactio^ in every respect, and to impugn and
withstand by all means that party that shall violate the same. When as
therefore by this means not only the united Estates, but also all others may
be assured that the Castle of Gulicke, (in the recovery whereof as they, so
also the Kings of France and Brittany, the united Electors and Princes, yea
even the posseding Princes themselves have been at great charge,) shall never
come into the possession of any third person, and the Prince of Newburge openly
testify, that during this treaty his meaning is to use the soldiers lying at
Dusseldorpe only for the security of himself and of the place, and so soon
as the transaction is finished will dismiss them, and enter into accord with
the Prince of Brandenburge, that in himself he may receive some place for
these most equal conditions, that he would beseech and admonish the deputies,
that thus sundry grieuances and complaints taken away, there may be a
reconciliation of the parties procured, a course may with all speed be taken
for the speedy determination of the controversy, and that in the mean time
all things may be administered with an indifferent hand, according to the
tenor of the former covenants. But if the Commissioners either all or some of
them, have not warrant to condescend to these most equal conditions, but shall
think it necessary that this treaty should be adiourned for two or three
weeks, until they may consult with their principals (by whom they are sent)
and know their minds, and that afterward the same shall again be renewed,
peradventure also with the assistance of both the Kings, (who are not to be
left out in this business) that the Prince will not be against it, so as they
undertake that no matter of hostility shall be attempted on either side. And
that he does hope that the Commissioners will use that care in the debating of
the business, that they may with the more facility arrive to their intended
end, that is, to the restitution of their ancient confidence, and the
conservation of peace and tranquillity.

The King of Spain when he understood what was done touching the Castle of
Gulicke, moved the Archduke Albert to assist the Prince of Newburge, and to
that end gave order for the leuying of forces, and for money, which he sent
into the Low Countries. Therefore Albert calling back the Captains and other
Officers, whom he had before sent away, and declared the Marquis Spinola,
General of the army, to execute upon the Cities of Aken and Mulheme the
sentence of proscription, which the Emperor had made against them, who levied
diverse Companies of horse and foot, and provisions of al kinds for the war,
which was carried to the Maze. On the other side, the Estates of Holland laded
three ships with artillery, and drew to Schenke Skonce great forces, that is,
70. Companies of foot, and 18. troops of horse, besides 1500. Wagons for
carriage of their provisions.

In the mean time the Prince of Newburge took diverse places in the Dition of
Bercke, as Machem, Mandaue, Ellersfield, and Burgh, which he also fortified
with men and munition, and bearing himself as lawful successor, intending
alone to interre the body of the dead Prince, without the priuity of the Prince
of Brandenburge, who had withdrawn al his forces and stuff from Dusseldorpe
to Cleue: but he was deterred from that purpose by the persuasion of the
Estates united.

Some few years a go, there was set forth a book at Collen, with this title:
Franciscus Suares of Granada, of the society of Jesus, Doctor of Divinity, his
defense of the Catholic and Apostolic faith, against the errors of the
English sect. This book being examined in the Parliament of Paris, and found
to contain in many places diverse propositions and doctrines, contrary to
lawful Kings appointed by God, and to their regal power and authority, and
against the peace and tranquillity of their kingdoms, it was upon mature
deliberation decreed and sentenced, that those doctrines and positions so
scandalous, seditious, and invented and published to the subversion of
kingdoms and countries, and to arm their subjects against their Sovereign
Kings and Princes, yea and also detected to be manifestly full of lies and
blasphemies, even in those places where the examples of Clodo^eus and Philip
Pulcher are alleged, are therefore worthy to be burnt by the common hangman
in the outward Court of the Castle. This done, it was by proclamation
forbidden, that no Printer should print that Book, or being printed should
bring it into the kingdom, read it, write out, or keep it, much less that any
should read it in schools, or give up the propositions contained in it to be
disputed. And a Decree further was made, that the Decree of Theological
faculty, made by virtue of a Parliament order, published in the year 1610. of
renewing the censure of doctrines made, anno 1408. in the Council of Constance,
and also in the years 1578. and 1595. together with this late decree of
Parliament, should publicly read every year the fourth of June, in the
Colleges of the Theological faculty, and also of the Priests and students of
Claremount College, and of the begging Orders, and that at the suit of the
Kings Attorney General a diligent process should be made against the^, who had
written any thing against this Prohibition. Furthermore it was decreed, that
the Fathers of the society of Jesus, Ignatius Armundus, Rector of Paris,
Cotton, Frontone, and Sirmund should forthwith appear in Parliament, and there
that they should receive rebuke and taxation, in that against their own
promise and decree made by their General, anno 1610. the foresaid book was
printed, and was brought into the City of Paris, to annihilate the authority of
the King, to the dishonouring of his person, and to the disturbance of the
peace of the whole kingdom, adding this charge to them besides, that they
should confer with their General about the renewing of this Decree, and
publishing the same with all speed, and within the space of six months next
ensuing, should publish and declare openly that thy have obeyed and satisfied
this commandment of the Parliament, and have by their letters provided, that
no such books hereafter shall be written by any of this society, and
published abroad. Besides the Jesuits were enjoined, that in their sermons
they should dissuade and deter the people from the liking of such kind of
propositions, and hereafter should teach and preach the contrary, if they did
otherwise, they should be pronounced and declared by the Parliament guilty of
high Treason. All these things were done and published the 27. of June, in the
Palace of the Parliament, in the presence of Ignasius Armundus, Carolus Tourus
who appeared for Cotton, Frontonius Duke, and James Sirmundus, fathers, who
were specially required to be present at this business.

In the former book we spoke of Sigefride Collonitius, how by an arrest made
on him he was stayed at Neostade, who not long after was by night carried to
Vienna, and laid in the prison, wherein we mentioned that Guntherode had been
kept before time. Coming to Vienna, by chance he spied a certain Ambassador
of Dresda, whom he entreated to procure him the favor of the Elector of
Saxony, who afterward did entreat in his behalf to the Emperor in this
manner. That Rodulph the late Emperor did many times use his service to
excellent purposes against the Turks, who therefore held him in great account,
as indeed he was for his virtue a wonder to all men, and a terror to his
enemies. Therefore that he besought the Emperor, that in regard of his virtue
and worth, and the fame of his name, he would deal graciously with him, and
restore him to his liberty, especially since now he has made his innocence
manifest to the world. By which act, he shall not only bind the love of
Collonitius and all worthy soldiers to himself, but shall take away from
others all occasion of sinister conceit, that this which he suffers is for his
religion and conscience. In like manner the Count of Thuron entreated the
Emperor in his behalf, alleging that it was not only permitted, but also
commanded by God that one should sue for another; and therefore that he
trusting to the Emperors singular grace and clemency could not forbear, but
at the earnest request of Collonitius, to interpose his prayer and entreaty in
his behalf. For he had been in former times his fellow-souldier, in the war
against the Turks, wherein he carried himself faithfully and resolutely, and
by his famous exploits in that service, and valiant deeds has purchased a
name, that in those parts will never be forgotten. Now if upon any weakness
or oversight he has committed any fault, he does beseech his Majesty, that
in regard of the faithful services, which he has done to the house of
Austria, he would please to pardon it, as proceeding not of malice, and that
out of his grace and goodness, he would discharge him of the arrest, and
suffer him to answer freely for himself.

To this time the Turks with their incursions and depopulations into the
countries adjoining, did the Christians much mischief. And having driven a
great multitude of cattle, were at last encountered in the way by the
Heyduccians, in number about 800. who in a skirmish put the Turks to flight,
half a mile from Agria, and recovered the booty out of their hands. The
Bashaw of Agria understanding this defeat, drawing forth 1000. of his
garrison soldiers, renewed the fight, but was so received by the said
Heyduccians, that he was beaten, having lost 200. soldiers, and his horse
slain under him, that he had much a do to escape.

The Heyduccians encouraged with this success, marched further, and on the
sudden assaulting a castle upon Solnocke, took it, and carried away great
store of goods and cattle. Others skowring the country toward Buda, by
chance light upon a Lady going to be married from Strigonium to Buda, whom they
chased, and brought away a great deal of wealth, which they took from the
company. Not long after having battered the castles of Balastera, Micoluta and
Fellaco, they overthrew 500. Turks and more, and sacked and spoiled all those
places about, and when the Turks asked, why they so unjustly brake the Peace,
they answered, that they gave the occasion, by the depopulations and excursions
which they ^de, but they for their parts were good fellows, that nei^^er cared
for the Roman, nor the Turkish Emperor.

Some few years passed, there arose certain contentions between the Citizens
and Senate of Frankford, about the publication of privileges, which had been
decreed and promised them by the Emperor: for the appeasing and reconciling of
which differences, were deputed Commissioners by the Emperor, John
Schuichardus, Elector of Mentz, and Jews, the Lantgraue of Hassia: who, after
long and painful examination of the business, brought the matter to that
pass, that they accorded upon certain articles, of which we will only
mention the chiefest.

First, that the Senate should faithfully deliver, and open all the privileges
of the city, 7. persons being selected for the executing of the business, an
oath being first taken of them, in whole custody the Records are kept, that
nothing shall be carried out of the Office, and next of the persons selected,
or deputed, for the reuiew of the privileges, that if they find any which may
be prejudicial to the city, they shall conceal them: and other, if they
shall seem profitable for the citizens, that they shall faithfully reveal and
discover them to the Commons.

Many other articles were agreed upon, which rather concerned private
commodity, then the public administration of the common weal. But the
differences between the citizens and the Senate were composed, and that the
Peace and friendship might the better be preserved between them hereafter, and
that both obedience and respect might be yielded to the Senate, and the
Citizens without impeach enjoy their liberties and privileges, there was
decreed solemnly a public release and obiteration of all those things, which
during these troubles have been done or said vrgently between them: that none
of those things should be prejudicial to any. Furthermore, that they should
forbear all secret conuenticles and factions, and especially that none, either
Senator or Citizen should undertake or attempt any thing against this
transaction: the which since, the Emperor at the earnest request of the
foresaid Commissioners, the Senate and the Citizens has ratified, and confirmed
by his special rescript.

The Companies of Smolensco, who returned home (...) of the war of Mosco, did
with great importunity challenge their pay, and made great vprores in Polonia
and the Countries thereabout, killing of the Country men, with no less
cruelty and fury then if they had been in the enemies Country, spoiling and
burning all where they came. Therefore the Elector of Brandenburge, to remove
such a mischief from the borders of his Country, put his subjects into arms,
and sent to the Bishop of Halles many wagons laden with provisions for war.
The Elector of Saxony following his example, mustered up his soldiers also,
and taking great quantities of arms out of his storehouses of Dresda, and
Witemberge and his other armories, caused them to be carried to diverse Castles
and Towns.

When the rumor was spread of the Governor of Millaine, the Dukes of Mantua,
Sauoy, and Lorraine, and others, that they had a mighty army in readiness,
the united Electors and Princes, were from diverse places admonished, that they
should take circumspect heed of a sudden irruption; in the mean time the
Moscouites making a sudden incursion into Lithuania, infested and annoyed all
the Country about with burning and spoiling. The Tartars in like manner
wasting and making havoc in the confines of Polonia.

The 12. of August died the illustrious Prince, Philip Ludouicke the old Duke
of Newburge, who by his last Testament made the Duke of Wittemberge, and the
Marquess of Durlace his Executors.

At this time the Provincial Diet was held at Lints, wherein all the
hereditarie Provinces of the Emperor, the Bohemians, Austriacks, Styrians,
Carinthians, Carniolanes, Silesians, Lusatians, Morauians and Hungarians were
assembled. It was propounded in that assembly, that of the Turks part the
peace was broken, by reason of many excursions, and direptions of men and
cattle, and other hostile attempts of that kind, and that so much more
certainly, that besides Valachia and Moldauia, he has made challenge to
Transyluania as his proper inheritance, and has fortified it with Garrison
soldiers, under the government of Gabriel Bethline, has assembled the States
of the Country, and has denounced by his letters to the Emperor, that he
should forbear to intermeddle in the Country. There was mention made of
Gabriel Bethline, that he has made him Governor, and the Turks Vassal, that
this Province might be united to the Turks Empire; since then it brings more
hurt then profit to the Christian world, it seems no part of wisdom to
abandon the Country to the Turks, especially considering the benefit which it
brings to the Turk, and the mischief it brings to the Christians, seeing
it is so opportune for each party to make war against the other. That it is
no expecting the ratification of the peace, seeing the Sultan will by no means
suffer that the Province should swear to them both. Furthermore, it was in the
Parliament demanded, since things hold no longer current, but the Sultan lays
claim to the Province, nor will suffer that hereafter the Germans should give
laws to the Transyluanians, what should be answered to the Turk touching all
these things: and since the Turkish Ambassador has come without any
commission against the express conditions of peace, and the Sultan has no will
to ratify the sixth Article of the transaction, if his Ambassador is to be
admitted, and his letters to be received by the Emperor, to whom only it is
fit they should be delivered. The last question was this, whether a new
transaction be to be made with the Sultan, since he refused to ratify the
former, and whether the Sultan stand to his promises or not (as he has done
about Moldauia, Valachia, and Transyluania) if he should invade Hungary before
this Parliament be finished, what is to be done, should the Emperor descend
to a mean of pasification, which by him has not hitherto been violated?

In the mean time came the Turks Ambassador to Lints, by sea. Therefore
those Delegates which were there present, in the behalf of the hereditarie
Provinces and kingdoms, without delay delivered to the Emperor their answers
to all the propounded articles of the present consultation: whose opinion was,
that it behooved the Hungars to devise a mean how this transaction made with
the Sultan might be kept on foot, and yet without prejudice to the Emperors
authority, and in regard of the future and imminent necessity, that necessary
means might be provided for the defense of the Country. The Transyluanians
by all means laboring, and deprecating, that no army may set foot within
their Province.

During this Parliament the Mandate Declaratorie of the proscription in the
business of Aken, was published in Frankford the 23. of August, by the
Subdelegates of the Emperor, to this effect. That after his happy access to
the Empire, he used all special diligence immediately, that in all places
justice might be restored to her brightness; and by this as by a mean the
peace and concord of all estates and members of the Empire might be conserved.
Therefore after that he understood in the very entrance to the Empire, of the
troubles and confusions which fell out from the year 1611. in his and the
imperial city of Aken, as well in civil as Ecclesiastical matters, that he
took especial care and notice of this business, and understood all which was
at large opened by both the sides, as well in the behalf of the old Catholic
Senate, as of them who now are in place of authority, first at Vienna, and next
at Ratisbone: moreover that he might understand the whole truth, sent from his
Court to this City honorable Commissioners the next year 1613. that by this
means he might be the surer not to swerve from justice in the future
decision of the business: and how he has with mature deliberation examined,
whatsoever has been written to him in this case by the Electors, Princes, and
the Estates Imperial, of both Religions, and has omitted no means which
might in any sort make for the true knowledge of this business. And that it is
evident by all the Acts and Records made in the course of justice, that when in
the year 1582. the first stir began in this City, whereby the Senate was
removed from his authority, and a great change made as well in Ecclesiastical
as in civil matters, his brother Rodulphus Caesar, out of his fatherly
affection to this City, thought it to belong to his duty, maturely to provide
by what means this fire might be put out: for even for this cause that he
appointed the next neighboring Princes to this City, and Estates of the
Empire, as the Bishop of Liege, the Duke of Iuliers and Cleue, Philip Buron of
Vimeberge, and Philip Earl of Nassaw, the Commissioners, who were very
careful and diligent to compose this business, but could not prevail with
these troublesome spirits, who neglecting the whole authority of the Emperor,
and the Commissioners, took up arms in all fury, seized themselves on the
public armorie, and on the Senate; that the Emperor when he understood this,
yet proceeded not to extremity of law, as yet, but even used all gentleness,
and gave a second Commission to the Electors John of Triers, and Augustus of
Saxony; but for all that, could prevail no more then before, further then that
their Subdelegates, who setting a part the danger of these troubles, adventured
themselves into the city, after much loss of time and pains, they left a
plea of Recesse there, which each part might use to the final determination of
the cause, in the Diet to be kept at Augusta, anno 1582. That they did not
only accept of this Recesse, but also delivered their complaints to Rodulphus
Caesar, and spent many years in pursuing the business before him, until at
last anno 1593. being summoned to hear the definitive sentence they appeared,
for there in the presence of the Emperor, and with his allowance, the sentence
was published against the defendants in this manner: That those things which
had been done in the city, in a furious and unlawful manner, should be
accounted as void, and that all things ought to be restored into the same
state, wherein they were before the innovation. But whereas the other side
which quailed in the judgment, did not as yet satisfy the excecutorie decree
of the Emperor, it fell so out, that in the year 1598. that is, the fifty
after the condemnation, and publication of the definitive sentence, the
sentence of proscriptio^ was pronounced against them, for this insolent and
stubborn contumacie of theirs. By this course, being at the last brought to
submission, and when upon their oaths they promised that they would in every
point obey the Emperors commandment, they were again by the Emperor received
into favor. But afterward in the 13. year after, when not only against the
executory sentence published, and the declaration of the proscription made, but
also against the sworn submission of the condemned persons, who
notwithstanding for the most part were not native citizens, but strangers, and
forreiners coming from other places. That the Emperor Rodulphus took that
behavior of theirs in very il part, as a thing exceeding contrary and
prejudicial to his authority and dignity, in regard of the sentence passed,
and the matter judged already, and forthwith to justify and make good his
authority published against this tumultuous and sedicious company, a very
severe penal decree, with this meaning, that they should give over these
attempts, and at the last obey the sentence pronounced ann. 1523. by which
mean they should discharge their own promises. And although he be gone to
heaven, yet there is no doubt, but if he had lived longer, he would never have
endured this injury done to his imperial authority and dignity, especially
seeing he had in his life appointed Ernest Archbishop of Collen, and Albert
the Archduke his brother his Commissioners, for the pacifying that tumult, and
executing his decree, with most absolute power to execute the same. But for as
much as he being dead, in the time of the vacancie, and during the tumult, a
plea of Recesse has been made and published in the city, the 19. of May, anno
1612. by the Delegates of the Illustrious Prince Palatine, John Administrator
of the Palatine Electorate, and Vicar of the Empire, which does directly cross
this former executorie decree, and the promises confirmed by oath, and tends
not only to the mischief and hinderance of them, who now had won the right,
which they sued for, but also to the empairing of the authority of his brother
deceased, and of other succeeding Emperors, that a business already now
judged and sentenced, and submissions confirmed by oath, should without any
judicial course, be so easily blown away, that he after diligent examination
of all circumstances, and deliberation used touching the whole business,
cannot otherwise judge and pronounce, but that the sentence of the Emperor
published the 27, August anno 1593. and the submissions and promises which
ensued the same, should abide in full force, and that the commandment of the
Emperor, published last of October. an. 1611. ought in all points to be
satisfied, without any consideration to be had of the foresaid recesse or
inparlance. Therefore that he has appointed the most Excellent Ferdinand
Archbish. of Collen, and Albert the Archduke his brother his Commissioners, in
no other manner then before was done by the Emperor Rodulph his brother
deceased, and has given them power, that either themselves, or they by their
substitutes, should signify this his Mandate Declaratorie, to all the
inhabitants of the imperial town and royal seat Aken, and according to the
full power, wherewith they are furnished, should by all means compel the
parties condemned to due submission and obedience, until they do restore all
things to the same state, wherein they stood, before the 6. of July, anno 1611.
Therefore that he does earnestly charge and command, al and several the
citizens, inhabitants, and subjects of the foresaid city, whosoever have under
any pretense attempted any thing against matters judged, executions, obedience,
and the commandment of the Emperor, published, ann. 1611. that forthwith they
forbear all these innouations and stirs, under what color or title soever,
that they restore all things into the same place wherein they were, after the
submission made anno 1598. until the 5. of July, anno 1611. that they do in
deed and truth, testify their submission before the Commissioners or their
Substitutes: that they obey and do all things which the Commissioners in his
name command them, and attempt nothing against them, so as they will avoid his
certain displeasure, and the punishments, included in the former executions,
and in the last Mandate of the Emperor, the taxation of the charges, and the
special punishment and censure against them who have professed themselves the
ringleaders and authors of those troubles, being reserved to his peculier
order; as also on the other side, he promises that he will administer justice
to all, hearing all complaints, which any shall make against the old and
lawful magistrate, after the submission made. This Mandate Declaratory, dated
the 20. of Feb. at Budouitium, when it came to Albertus the Archd. hands, the
execution thereof was by him committed to the Marquis Spinola, who incontinently
mustring up 30000. horse and foot about the Thine, departed to Maesstriht,
with 400. wagons, and 80. pieces of great ordinance, and from thence marched
to Aken, bearing on his Tent the Eagle, the ensign of the Empire. When he was
come before the town 21. August, and with great speed had pitched his camp,
and placed his ordinance, the next day he sent his messengers into the city,
to acquaint the Senate and Townsmen with his commission, and the Emperors
commandment, who presently assembling the Companies, entered into deliberation,
how to give speedy remedy to these mischiefs, that the city might be spared.
Therefore after diverse consultations, the conclusion was, that the Clergy with
the Popes Nuncio, with other principal Burgers, should go to Spinola, and
humbly entreat of him favor in the behalf of the town and the inhabitants.
Which when they had done, after a very little conference, the city was yielded
to the Emperors pleasure. The town being given up, the soldiers of the
Prince of Brandenburge were dismissed out of the town, with their arms and
colors displaid, the 24. of August, and twelve ensigns of horse and foot
brought into the town: upon whose entry, the gates were shut, that none might
pass any way. After this, the new Senate of the Protestants being dismissed,
the other Popish Senate, which had been discharged, was restored to his former
place, and from that 28. day, was had the first meeting in the Senate to begin
public consultations: and certain soldiers, by whose help, one of the
Consuls had escaped over the walls out of the town, and some others, who were
reckoned the chief authors of these troubles, were committed to prison.

The 15. of September last, were two great Armadaes in a readiness, the one of
the Turks, to the number of 65. Galleys, which lay at Nauarine in Morea, which
was the old Peloponesus in Greece: another of the Christians, who have 85.
Galleys well appointed at Messina in Sicilie, who had then taken two of the
Turks Galleys spies. It is suspected the Turk intends this preparation for
Calabria, the country is likewise prepared to bid him welcome.

The matter thus ordered at Aken, Spinola with his army marched toward Duren,
whom the townes-men met in the way, and delivered him the keys, as to the
Emperors Lieutenant. In this time the Prince of Newburge levied his forces,
which consisted of 800. horse, and 5000. foot, and the Count of Ridberge was
employed to levy more soldiers. On the other side the Prince of Brandenburge
gave order to his Captains and Officers to levy three Companies of foot, and
1000. horse. Also the Palatine Elector used great diligence in leuying of
forces, which he drew to Bilifield to the appointed place upon the marches of
his Country, commanding his subjects that they should be ready if occasion of
service should require.

Spinola after that he had left soldiers in Duren, marched to Mulheme, which
he took, and leaving 500. men to throw down and to raze the trenches and
bulwarks of that place, departed and took in Berchem, Castre, Greuenbruke,
and other small towns, and put soldiers to keep them. Afterward going to
Rhinbirke, he made a bridge of boats over the Rhine, that he might pass his
army for Wesell, Rese, and Emmericke. This unexpected journey of Spinola, and
success especially at a time when there was now begun a friendly treaty, the
Ambassadors of the Kings of Britanie and France being present, and interceding
for peace, gave occasion to the Estates of the united Provinces to suspect ill
dealing: which caused them with all celerity and speed to gather their forces
and to hasten into the field.

The Emperors Mandate being published at Franckfort, as we have related
before, that none should be so hardy as to hinder the ancient Senate, but that
they may enjoy their former place, when the time of submission was now at hand,
the Substitutes of the Elector of Mentz, and Prince of Darmestadte, came into
the City the 11. and 12. of August, and showing their letters of warrant,
carefully advised the Citizens to obedience. The Citizens a little before this
time had sent certain messengers to Lints, who exhibiting complaints against
the old Senate to Caesar, should entreat that this abrogation of their
authority might be ratified by the Emperor. But because they were not as yet
returned, a writing was delivered to the Substitutes, and a request made by the
Citizens that the execution of this Mandate might be respited but until the
return of those Citizens, adding this protestation, that if it so fell out
that the Emperor continued in the same mind still, that they would not be
against it, but in all points would obey his pleasure. In the mean time some
of the old Senators had taken their place again, and now the time appointed in
the Mandate for submission was at hand. Therefore they sent for the servants of
sundry tradesmen, the 22. of August, opened unto them the meaning of the
Mandate, and to avoid the danger and mischief that might be fall them thereby,
advised them by all means, that they would not stick to their masters and
Lords, but depart some whither out of the City for a time. Then there went a
rumor abroad, yt they who were noted to be disobedient, should shortly see
their names fastened to the gallows. This report whether it proceeded from the
Substitutes, which they have constantly denied, but the other affirmed, or
whether it was devised by some other, which is more probable, certainly it was
the cause of a great uproar in the City. For the common people transported with
rage and fury, did in flocks run up and down the town, and began to
encourage and provoke one another to commit some notable outrage, until toward
evening, the whole force of their madness being converted into the Jews
street, they spoiled and ransacked the same. The Jews at the first withstood
them, and with barrecadoes of all manner of stuff defended their houses, being
assisted by some of the Citizens themselves. But the numbers of the raging
multitude increasing more and more, and the rascals and loose people flocking
out of all quarters and corners of the town, and mixing themselves with the
servants and prentises gathered such a head, that they were past resistance,
the Consuls themselves and other good Citizens being unable to prevail against
their fury, either by force or by persuasion, for the rage the more increased,
the more it fell out that any were wounded in the tumult. For one was wounded
in the arm, another in the ear, another in the eye: some being wounded to
death fell to the ground. The next day the Citizens armed themselves, and came
up with a competent number of horse and foot into the street, and taking the
goods from those loose fellows, whom they could light on in the streets,
caused them to be laid up for the owners. So there was an end made of this
robbing and mutiny. The Jews moved with the fear of this uproar, to the
number of 1500. forsook the City, resolving to dwell somewhere else.

Marquess Spinola in the mean time coming to Rhinberke, resolved to besiege
Wesell, accompanied with 12000. horse and foot. The Vesalians understanding
this determination of Spinola, presently dispatched messengers to Rhinberke, to
gratulate his coming, and to present him with certain cartlodes of wine, and
to desire of him the cause of his coming, that they might give him
satisfaction; who answered them, that they must restore the City into the same
condition and state of government wherein it stood in the time of Charles the
fifth, and receive his Garrison into the town. When this answer was delivered
to the Citizens assembled in the Parish Church, they bound themselves instantly
by mutual oaths, that they would fight to the last gasp for their Country,
and die and live together in the quarrel. But Spinola the 23. of August
approaching with all his Camp nearer to the town, sent certain Companies
aforehand to make an assault upon the walls: which the townes-men issuing out
of the town received in such manner, that they slew very many of them,
especially with the great Ordinance, which played from the town: but Spinola
marching near with the the rest of the army, they retired into the town: But
he caused 18. Murall engines to be set against one place of the wall, threw
down one of the gates of the town, which with the fall oppressed diverse, and
stroke such a terror into the minds of the Citizens, that the women in all
places came with their children running to the walls, and with weeping and
wringing of hands entreated Spinola to spare them. A treaty hereupon appointed,
an agreement was made, that one thousand soldiers should be received into the
City, and should be billeted by the Magistrate upon diverse houses, who
notwithstanding living under military Discipline, should be no burden to the
townes-men, nor receive either meat or money of them. 2. That Gulicke being
once restored to the former estate, by the Estates of the United Provinces, the
City should be again discharged of these Companies of soldiers. 3. That no
change should be made either in civil matters, or Ecclesiastical, and those
which concern religion. 4. That the City should retain all her privileges
without impeachment. 5. That by this occasion no prejudice should be offered to
the Prince of Brandenburge. 6. That his Officers and Ministers with all their
arms and provisions might remain in the City so long as please them. 7. That
the City should keep still their Ordinances and all Provision for war in their
possession. 8. That the Garrison soldiers of the City should depart with all
their arms. 9. That it should be free for any Citizen to depart out of the
City, whenever he would.

These conditions being subscribed by Spinola, and after to be confirmed by the
Prince of Newburge, the City was delivered into Spinola his hands.

While these matters passed in this manner, Grave Maurice, Count of Nassau,
drew out his forces to the number of eighteen thousand horse and foot,
appointing his rendeuous at Schencke Sconce, and taking to him William Henry
Frederick, and John Ernest, Count Chastilion also, and Sir Horace Vere, and
many other brave Commanders, marching with his whole army by water and land,
he came before Emericke, and suddenly surprised the town, and put a guard in
it. Next he marched to Rese. Now the townes-men a little before had sent their
Consul to Spinola, promising him that they would receive a guard from him. But
when his Excellency had pitched his Camp, and summoned the town to yield
themselves, they refused, and discharged their Ordinance against the Spaniards,
which Spinola sent with their consent, professing that they would be neutrall,
and would receive no guard from one side or other. The Spaniards being thus
sent away and deluded, his Excellency commanded that the Artillary, and all
provision should be made ready to batter the town which he intended to do
very strongly: but the Burgers when they saw there was no remedy, yielded the
town, and received a guard from his Excellency: who from thence marching
further, took in Gocha, Calcar, Gunep, and other towns situate in those
quarters.

In the mean time Spinola neglecting the conditions of the treaty made with
them of Wesell, increased his guard against his promise and faith given: for he
brought in three thousand soldiers to the great hurt of the City, and so
terrified the Burgers, as he had done before at Duisburge, that not one
Preacher durst dare to preach in public, in so much as their Churches seemed
to be desolate. But further making a bridge of boats over the Rhine, between
Wesell and Buricke, part of his army he sent to take Sante, part he employed
to raise a bulwark upon the Rhine anenst Wesel, by that means to keep both
the passage of the River, and the City it self in his power. There had been
carried from the siege of Gulicke into the town of Wesell, 22. pieces of great
Ordinance, with exceeding store of powder and shot. All which he permitted to
be taken away, and to be restored to the Prince of Brandenburge.

But his Excellency marching on still, drew so near to Spinola, that he joined
Tents with Spinolaes Tents, in so much as the P^rdues and Sentinels might not
only talk, but also eat and drink together. And when he desired to see the
letters of his commission, that he might know in whose name he entered into this
expedition, Spinola desired his Excellency that he would in like sort satisfy
him, who caused so many Trumpeters to sound the trumpet, as he had noble
personages in his Camp.

But to the declaration of the Estates of the united Provinces, that they would
deliver the Castle of Gulicke by way of sequestration to the two Ambassadors of
the Kings of Britanny and France, the Elector of Cullen answered: That he knew
not the minds of both the Princes, whether they will assent to this motion or
no: and that he knew as little whether these Ambassadors have sufficient
warrant from the Kings their Masters to do the same: that as he conceived, it
was a business rather of private honor, then the good of the Country which
was stood upon. That it cannot be denied, but that he loses nothing of his
honor, who restores that which is not his own; therefore it should be fit
for the common good, that on both sides restitution should be made of all
places, and all questions which have risen from hence, should be clearly
taken away. After he exhorted his Excellency, that he would please to spare
neither time nor pains to compose these differences, but that he would be
willing to stay arms, that the matter may be drawn to a treaty. That he also
has dealt earnestly with Spinola, that would stay here, but that he would not
hearken to the motion, unless he were assured that the Estates, and the
Marquess of Brandenburge would also sit still, and attend the issue of a
treaty. Therefore that the matter might with more conueniency be brought to a
treaty, that he would wish his Excellency and the Estates to be effectually
dealt withal.

We spoke somewhat before of the preparations of the Governor of Millaine, and
other Princes of Italy to arms. Now about the beginning of September, the
armies of the Governor of Millain, and of the Duke of Sauoy, which are
reported to exceed the number of 40000. have met in the field, and fought a
very bloody battle. Albeit they of Berne and Geneua, and others, suspecting
that some treachery lies hidden under this pretense of quarrel, are upon their
guard, and provide circumspectly against the worst: being also advised
diligently by the Protestant Princes and Estates, that they suffer not
themselves to be abused by any false pretenses. Therefore certain Imperial
Cities, as Strawsburge, Norimberge Collen, Worms* Ratisbone, Bibracke,
Memming, Vinshem, Rotenburge, Veissenburge, Offenburge, Noerdling, Hailbrun,
Essing, Reutling, Suinfurt, Colmar, Halle in Sueueland, and others, have with
great speed sent their Ambassadors, for a meeting to be held the 6. of September.
in this cause of Vlme, by reason of these tumultuous businesses, and rumors of
wars, the illustrious Princes of W^ttemberge and Anhalte joining with them in
this business.

FINIS.
