Cum Priuilegio Regiae Majestatis.



To the right Honorable and most virtuous Lady, the Lady Anne Countess of
Warwick.
RIght H. the heavens, th earth and al things in them do sing with David both
mercy and judgment, they teach us that God does whatsoever pleases him, being
able to punish them which forget his mercies, and ready to bless those that
fear his judgments: for in the heavens we may read, that he which made them
glorious, is himself of exceeding glory; that he which enritcheth them so
mightily for the comfort of man, is unto man of exceeding mercy. In the shaking
of the earth we may read, that the Ruler of the earth is mighty: and in the
fruits of the earth we do enjoy the fruits of his bounty: all which matters are
therefore published, that in his Majesty he may be feared, and in his mercy
loved. But because we are blind, and cannot see to read the works of God to
our instruction: we have the word of God also from whence, if we be not deaf,
we may hear the same doctrine to our edification: for it tells us, how in
loving sin judgment is to be feared, in avoiding judgment repentance is
required: in true repentance mercy is assured, in embracing mercy Eternal
happiness will be granted. But because the whole Book of God to idle
scholars may seem too tedious, we have the Psalms of David more compendiously
teaching doctrine fit for us: for if we would see the danger of sin, they will
show it: if we would know how to turn from sin, they will teach it: if we
would praise God for his mercy received, they can direct us: if we would pray
to be delivered from misery, they will be good guides unto us: yea in every
good action we shall find in the Psalms sufficient instruction for us. And
that our meditations in the Psalms may not want their delight, we have that
excellent gift of God, the Art of Music to accompany them: that our eyes
beholding the words of David, our fingers handling the Instruments of Music,
our ears delighting in the sweetness of the melody, and the heart observing
the harmony of them: all these do join in an heavenly Consort, and God may
be glorified and our selves refreshed therewith. But I leave this Argument to
David himself, who in consideration of the premises exhorts us to make
melody with heart and harp, with trumpet and loud Cymball; as if he had said
that no way is sufficient to further men on earth in their praising the Lord of
Heaven. I only am to yield a reason of this my present doing: My honorable
good Lady, as zeal to Gods glory has caused me to publish this work, so
duty to your H. has moved me to present it to your Ladyship: whose love of
piety and care of Religion have been always such, that your own happiness
is sealed up to you in your possessing them: whose favors to me in the days
of your H. husband, sometimes my good Lord and Master, have been so great,
that I may not forget them: and having no way to show a thankful mind, but
by presenting this simple work unto your H. I humbly crave pardon for my
boldness in offering it, and favor from your Ladyship in accepting it, leaving
these my simple labors under your H. protection, and commending your H. to the
protection of the Almighty God.

Your Honors humbly devoted in all duty Richard Allison.

John Dowland Batcheler of Music in commendation of Richard Allison, and this
most excellent work.
IF Musicks Art be Sacred and Divine,
And holy Psalms a subject more Divine:
If the great Prophet did the words compile,
And our rare Artist did these smooth notes file,
Then I pronounce in reason and in love,
That both combinde, this most Divine must prove,
And this dear friend I recommend to thee
Of thine own worth a proved verity:
Whose high desert does rather urge me still,
To show my weakness, then to want good will.
William Leighton Esquire. in praise of the Author.
Go silly Muse, and do my love present
to Musickes praise the Author of this work:
Plead his desert thar is so excellent,
in whose sweet notes so secret skill does lurk:
Let all that loves this Sience so Divine,
afford him grace that haps this work to see:
Whose ears may judge what Concord can combine
by Musicks art, consists in notes but three,
Conioinde in parts with true Concent of art,
as may appear by every Close contriude,
How concords three contains every part
within this Book, from whence notes are deriude:
Admire his skill: let God have laud and praise,
whose holy words these sweet Consorts do raise.
Let this grave Music give your ears content,
Since Musickes art is drawn from this Concent. ^
John Welton in praise of the Author.
Divine Apollo God of heavenly Muses
The Garden walks for his repast frequenting,
In Allies-son bright shining there he uses,
Often to attend the gracious Nymphs presenting
Psalms of all sorts, with instruments and voices,
Of sundry aires and sundry are their choyses.
In those fair walks they use the exercises
Of Psalms and Hymns and spiritual songs deuining*
Perfuming air with their sweet sacrifices
From earth to heaven by sacred mean inclining.
Long may they haunt those paths with sacred blissing*
To charm the noise of venomous vipers hissing.
