accomplished.

Made by Robert Pricket, a Soldier: and dedicated to all the Lords of his
Majesty's most honorable privy Council.

Multis pateo, non multiloquis.



Imprinted at London by George Eld, and are to be sold by John Hodgets. 1606.

To the Right Honorable, the Lords and others of his Majesty's most Honorable
privy Council. Robert Pricket wishes all increase of Honor in this world,
and in the world to come life everlasting.
MY honored Lords, it is a true saying, that Conscientia est mill testes,
which sentence makes me confident, because I know the vprightnes of my heart to
God, and faithful and obedient loyalty unto my King, and love to you the
honorable Peers and Princes of the State, together with my honest zeal unto
my countries benefit, is, in the presence of heavens Majesty testified by a
thousand witnesses, and therefore in the justice of my hopes resolve, I have
adventured, unto your honors to dedicate this little book, and in the
clearenes of my consciencs, I cannot but expect a kind acceptance at your
Lordships hands.

The last untimely fruit, which by a public print I rashly published* gave
just occasion to procure your dislike: and my amiss there in, was greater,
then at first I could conceive, for it is an evil not to be borne with, when
the greatest (much more, when so mean a subject as my self) shall dare to
call in qrestion, things formerly determined, by the justice of the Law,
judgment of the honored Peers, and prudent wisdom of a kingdoms most
honorable Councellers: and too high does their presumption clime (especially
in a cause of so great consequence*) whose words would seem as if they did
desire, so to extenuate an offense, as that in respect of the offender, opinion
should be taught, either to tax the Law with cruelty, or the State with
inhumanity: he therefore whose actions shall but bear a show, as if they were
directed unto some such purpose, justly deserves to be punnished. And yet may
it please your Honors; I must needs confess, my punnishment was compounded
of an absolute Lenity, without (in the least sort) being mixed with any
appearance of Severity: (...) as I am in this respect, bound unto you all (my
Lords) so principally my thanks must humbly run, unto the Right Honorable the
Earl of Salisbury, by whose love and bounty, my cause was favorably
censured, my liberty procured, and my wants relieved. Concerning the
worthiness of whose ever honorable disposition, I would largely speak, but
that I know; true honored virtue, whose ever constant wisdom, and approved
Judgment, labors to perform each virtuous and well commended office, so as
it cannot, but by a certain kind of supreme excellence, worthily deserve
worlds praise, yet will it not endure to hear it self praised.

As just cause there is, so now I do rejoice to see, that Mars and Mercury,
are in Conjunction joined, the powerful Venus, Lady of that house, and mighty
Jupiter, with kind Apect, Predominate: Majesty, Honor, Wisdom, love, and
wisdoms government, have wrought a happy work, unto them all, be still
continued and increast, the glory of each best esteemed happiness. And that
Imperial greatest union maker, whose prudent judgment, labors in peace for
to unite, great Brittons Monarchy, in him, and in his Royal line, shall most
Princely and potent Monarchs be establish^^^^^d, by (...) Empires and
Kingdoms, shall be unto their Christ vnite^^^^^ Conquest and Triumph, shall
for ever wait upon the Regal Scepter of their awful government, Oh let the
love of all good Subjects, unto them remain as constant, as they are
constantly of heaven beloved.

In this little work which I have called, Times Anotomie, (the first part
whereof was finished by me almost two years since) I do with a religious anger
chid^^^^^, the violont, and presumptious rage of vnrul'd abuses, because I
grieve to see the gross impieties which our time commits; bree^^^^^ely
therefore, I have Anotomis'd those evils which do ass^^^^^ct the world, And in
the prosses of my books discorse, my reprehentions, may paraduenture be
accounted round, and sharp. But Co^^^^^siue uses not to be applied unto the
slesh that is sound, and where it has no power to to^^^^^ch, it procures no
smar^^^^^, and therefore cannot be offensive unto you my Lords, whose
judgment, wisdom, virtue, and Justice, always bou^^^^^ded ^^^^^n the most
honorable life of v^^^^^stained uprightness, lab^^^^^reth by all means
p^^^^^ssible to purge our land from those iniquities, against which my poor
and vnresp^^^^^cted words complain. But when they shall from your perfection
pass, unto the general, much disord^^^^^red multitude, where imperfection
swelles with misdemeaners sur^^^^^eting* if the^^^^^ it be there chance to
light upon an ill compounded outside closed up vlser, whose unseen
hollownesse in it self contains, (...) payson of some gross corruptions
Coare, there let them sink and work, and purge, and by the roots pluck up
that which puts do^^^^^ne the race of man; from heavens eternal most glorious
and vncompared felicity.

Some lit^^^^^le part of my most pi^^^^^h-lesse work is drawn from
obseruation^^^^^ Philosophical, the rightly termed Agar. servant to Saray,
a^^^^^d hand-made to divinity; for signs of times and seasons, (...) the
stars created, and son and moon were made times governors: all which do by
a special influence unto time, presage times future accedents, and do
prescribe right well opproued, and most worthily commended documents, so far
forth as the al pourful Mai^^^^^sty of the Creator, be not tied to the (...)
included in the Creature, and what in this case I hau^^^^^ briefly specified, I
hope my pen has used such moderation, a^^^^^ that no word in this unworthy
work shall be offensive to your honored wisdoms.

Against the Sea, and seat of Blasphemy, I do (in this my writing) most desire
with greatest force to bear ^^^^^y self because from Rome, that cursed
Babylon, proceeds each ^^^^^ellborne dangerous mischief, by which our King and
State is, ((...) always has been) menaced: I have therefore directly
pointed, a^^^^^ the approved neerenesse of proud Romes destruction, farther
showing, that both Gog, and Magog, shall be (...) extinct, and utterly cast
out, by the wrathful fury of a merciless confusion, and have briefly given
an Index unto the manner how, this mighty work shall be accomplished,
grounding the truth of my description, upon observations grounded on holy Writ,
that most Sacred and Divine authority. And though that in a plain and modern
verse, I have describde the weighty Accedents of Time: yet if your Honors will
vouchsafe to read, I hope you shall find me much to differ, from an idle
Poet^^^^^ usual course* for without having respect to a vain variety of
words, or painted circumstance, I have only applied my endeavors, unto the
effectual life, and material Substance, of that which I desire to describe.

Though time receives disturbance, by some, neither valiant, wise, nor honest,
but in their hearts, no less then State disturbing Catalines, for Libellers
are merely such, whose thoughts be in themselves rebellions, and actions tend
unto rebellion, but in despite of them, and treasons treachery, God will
bring his purposes to pass, by the isntrumental means of Humane government,
and Britton shall (as now it is) by a prudent wisdom, judgment, and
providence, be for ever uprightly governed.

Thus may it please your Honors, I have once more adventured, by my unworthy
(and yet well meaning) Pen, not to present this book alone, but therewith to
dedicate my poor and unrespected self unto your Lordships: and though my
labors do never chance to meet with the approbation of this sentence, (...),
yet I hope my now endeavors shall not make me say, Solabar^^^^^atis, contraria
Fata rependens, for my labor does but desire to live, to the end my lives
imploiments may wholly be devoted to my countries benefis. But, unto that all
powerful providence, which holds the hearts of Kings within his hand, do I
commit my hopes, and you my Lords to heavens eternal happiness

Your Honors, in all humble duti^^^^^, Robert Pri^^^^^ket.

To the Reader.
THough custom, does in a sort compel my Pen, by this Epistle, generally to
direct my labors to the vulgar multitude; yet I neither do desire, nor expect,
a favorable censure of every one that reads: for my affection bou^ded in a
compas^^^^^e more particular, does only desire to content, and please, the
Grave, wise, religious, and well affected Readers, for the rest, let them in
opposition stand, for my part neither loved, nor feared; yet in my charity, I
wish amendment unto all, least all be marde for want of mending.

Such as my self, either Soldiers, or generally the poorer sort, whose
poverty unto the earth is crushed, with the massy burden of their woes
calamity, to whom is given no hand to help them up; but hate, contempt, and
scorn, to keep them down, whilst Envy, Pride, and Malice, merciless,
strange Monsters-like, with he^^^^^ds of Brass, hands of Lead, feet of Iron,
and hearts of Flint, with violence, and insulting steps, do tread upon the
adverse fortune of a poor man's misery, unto those poor ones, though in this
worlds respect, accounted absolutely comfortless, yet may my lines to them,
the comfort of the sweetest consolation bring, if with a Christian patience,
they do endure their wants, and in the sight of their impiety, confess that
God is just, and justly punishes, and then, if in the inward feeling of
griefs true compunction, and sorrows sound Anxietie for sin. Their souls
humility, and repentant hearts, do from these things beneath, with joy,
direct faiths eyes above to look, they shall behold the glory of that throne,
where shines the ever radiant golden beams of heavens eternal glorious
malestie, where at the right hand of God the father, sits redemptions only
strength, and worlds alone salvation, Jesus Christ, who has prepared a kingdom
for his Saints, from whence the greatest power can never pluck the poorest
soul, that on his grace depends and in the meditation of this felicity and
vncompared never ending happiness, let them rejoice who in this world do want
each worldly cause of joy.

Those Idle vain misgouernd dissolutes, the spots and stains of our corrupted
time, proud plumed gallants whose actions Atheismeticall, do seem as if they
scornde both heaven and hell, for them I wish they did but know themselves, or
could perceive the fearful horror of their own estate; for certain the
world shall pass from them, or they from it, and they not here on earth their
sins repenting, the world to come shall be to them most terrible. When they
in vain shall wish earths mountains on their heads to fall, thereby to hide
them, from the wrath of God, those therefore that make a gain of sin, and
letts adultry and fornication out, to fear those that by whoredom reap an
anuall rent, and do resolve by them, to live upon whom they have spent their
means of living, such as do with most delight suck up the filthyest dregs
of worst Impiety, and glut themselves with rank damnation, whose proud
presumptuous sin does as it were, even in a desperate vilde despite,
proudly bear it self against the powerful greatness of their makers majesty
and with their savage rude, and godles^^^^^e blasphemy, do rend^^^^^ and tear
in sunder the glory of saluations name, those of that number which usually do
use for affirmation of their vildest filthynesse to swear, God confound them.
Gods curse light on their hearts, God damme them body and soul perpetually,
and if it were not so, when for because it was so all that they wish on their
own heads shall fall, and in the presence of heavens Justice, their names
being regestred in hells black book, they one day, must receive that sentence
which shall throw their souls and bodies into that sulpher lake, where for
ever, in endless burning flames amongst the devils, they must and shall endure
the al co^suming fury and fires indignation of Gods eternal judgment, Oh may
we therefore here on earth, our selves so judge as that in the world to come,
we be not unto hell adiugded.

You little least and almost unseen number in respect of worlds great
multitude, who in your hearts do purpose to perform, those actions that unto
righteousness belong; know I cannot give offense to you by plainly setting forth
the true Anotamy, of our times abuse, do you as those of heanen beloved,
increase in love, and heavenly charity: for those whom God does justify, their
affections are also sanctied, unto the obedience of his will. Make therefore
your election sure, by sufficient testimony in your selves, on earth, by holy
works, let your faith be dignified that in heaven by faith alone, you may be
justified, bild not the sollace of your faiths content, upon the fruitless
flourish, of unfruitful leaves; nor let a self concealed pride, or wilful
arrogance, disturb the peace of Syon, and glory of our church, but, as becomes
the members of Jesus Christ our head, join in the fellowship of saints and
walk together in the paths of sanctity, still praising God whose mercy has
preserved great Briton^^^^^ monarke, with the princely state and glory of his
monarchye.

Concerning Rome, if any Papist chance to read, and find himself agrieued at
my words, let him, or them, even as they will, or can be satisfied, for were
the Pope a temporal Prince, and so accounted and no more, I would use him with
some reverent respect; although I know him, (as indeed he is) my countries
enemy. But as he is the now revealed Antichrist, and si^^^^^tes upon the seat,
and Sea, of blasphemy; I will not use any show of re^^^^^erence to his
misnamed holiness, whose vildest predecessor Boniface, the 3. at first did
build the strength of every Popes supremacy upon the blood of Christians, and
spoil of Christiandome, since when, neither by laws humane, nor yet divine,
but rather by deuilish plottes, most treacheries and inhumane policies the
Pope, and court of Cardinals have (...) maintained the most (...),
tyrannical, vsurpant, bloody, and aspiring pride of Romes blasphemous
government, which shortly will break forth into (...) public rage, and then
confusions shame, with condign^^^^^ punishment, armde in wraths fury, will
unto the fearful downefull of her utmost ruin^^^^^, ^^^^^wiftly follow her,
when she, and all her followers shall mourn, because the laws of hell they
followed.

About the approbation of Romes most monstrous greatness, I cannot with my Pen
make answer, unto the sophisme of their wrangling Sophister, Romes great (...)
les, and like him a Christian, famo^^^^^s Bellermine; but if on Romes behalf,
in a Soldiers place, a Champion would skip forth, and play the Challenger, him
I thank God I durst be bold to answer, and on his head, and heart for to
(...), that Rome maintains, an Antichristian regencie, and that the Pope is
this worlds deceiving Antichrist, and the self same whore that in the
Revelation of S. John is specified, and in this trueths defense, if called by a
lawful means, the resolved readiness of my lives resolution, shall with most
comfortable joy both live and die.

Mors Christi causa, vita perennis erit: Not to wrong the Roman charity, but
to give the devil his due, if on the Popes behalf I stood with no less
confidence, then I against him do, undoubtedly, I think that then I should
not need for to deplore, nor yet complain, the wants of me and mine, nor to
endure an unrespected misery: but God forbid that any hope of gain, should
make me join with them that are the soes to Christ, nor do I now enforce my
manner of writing, by reason of the times advantage, for by a book entitled A
Soldiers Resolution, dedicated to the King, and unto his Royal self
delivered, I made bold to tell his Majesty, even at his first coming into
England, what fruits his Highness should expect to reap from Roman
Catholics, and now my words are by their actions verified.

As touching Papists generally, I those to heaven commit, that unto heaven
belong, and for the treasons to our King, and kingdoms, done by Romes
adherence, and Popish pack, Catholicall, be all they accused, that may justly
be condemned and for those that have been actors in this last and greatest
treason, let justice unto their destruction follow them, and least good
subjects should still too much affect, those that will remain infected with
the Roman Leprosy, I but request the well affected sort indifferently to
judge. What may not they do, unto whom all things may be made lawful to be
done, and what credit is there to be given to them, unto whom is granted so
learge a liberty? and what use they have always made thereof, the world may
witness, and our experience have often been in a dangerous hassar'd, to be most
dearly bought, those then that by substantial proof, cannot otherwise be
accounted, then corrupted and infected members, always corrupting, infecting,
and most dangerously working in our public weal, why may not every good
subject, justly desire to be discharged of them, for unless, the material
cause whence evil proceeds be clearly taken hence, the effects of evil can
never cease, and when some times an evils presumption, be not so at first laid
hold upon, as that thereby the passage of each suspected course, may with an
inviolable strength be stayed: A little sufferance (in such cause) may most
unhappily too soon, produce the damned vildenesse of some vil le action done,
whereby a just lamenting, shall have too just a cause to run before a just
revenging; but the consideration hereof, I refer unto the Majesty, honor,
and wisdom of that place, where at this time, there should not now have been,
either place, wisdom, honor, or Majesty, if Romes designs, could with a
hell-borne black destructions hand, have rac'd them out.

To conclude, sees the sins of the People: do (...) bring the wrat^^^^^ of
GOD upon that land, in which they dwell, it behooves all of us, with fear and
trembling, v^^^^^to our God ^^^^^ue, and with faiths repentance in the (...) of
Jesus Christ to pray heavens majesty, that as in mercy he has preserved us
from that vninersall blow, which would in blood have drowned our monarchy, that
so in th^^^^^ love and favor of his still continued grace, he would vouchsafe
far from us to remove, those other judgments which if we still procure his
wrath do stand prepared for our punishment, and to this peticion (of more
weight (...) then is considered) let every honest reader say amen.

Thus wishing that my labors may unto the best procure contentment, I leave
the r^^^^^st, even as they will to (...) contented, and do only vow my self
a friend to thos^^^^^ that unto God, my King, and Country, are approved
friends, to such, the abondant zeal, of a poor man's love, slowes forth, to
you, the well affected, himself he humbly gives.

That will in life, and death, be only yours* Robert (...).

TIMES ANOTOMIE.
EVen in the time, when joy and sorrow met,
When present woe, did present joy beget.
When eyes, and hearts, did make an equal choice,
To weep, to mourn, to triumph, and rejoice:
When heaven took hence, and yet unto us sent
Most cause of grief, and cause of most content:
Then in that strange, worst, best, and happiest time,
A Soldier sung, Loves song, in vnsmooth'd ^^^^^ime.
Yet by his words, it might be plainly seen,
He praised the virtues of a maiden Queen.
Whose Majesty in glory now excelling,
Leaves glories fame on earth, to keep her dwelling;
A poor man's love, her grace would well requi^^^^^e,
But now poor men, in vain Loves songs indite.
The Muse by whom, her virtues most are praised,
Shall least thereby, from woe to weal be raised.
When matchless worth, is wrapped in leaves of lead,
The living, they forget the worthiest dead.
No virtue can, it self continuance give,
It is the pen, that makes all virtues live,
And pens I know, will mount her praise so high,
That in this world, her fame shall never die.
My lines alas, from worth do differ far,
I do confess, they most unworthy are:
And yet my love as well desired to sing,
The praises of the worlds admi^^^^^'d King:
A Soldiers wish, I am sure, wished all things well,
His wish, his want, did in strange sort compel.
Yet he resolved; A Resolution framed,
For which (against him) Gods foes have chiefly aimed.
A traytrous speech, which might not be conceald*
He Is, hated most, by whom it was reueald.
Hate, Scorn, Despite, wrong done to honest (...)
Then out of rule are such disordered fractions.
Though men not gain, when well to do they (...)
It Is hard when men for doing well shall loose.
But poor to be, if thence proceeds the cause,
Ha^^^^^d world, when poor, must feed proud (...) (...)
Hence does proceed sad woes, abundant sorrow,
Not knowing whence, it might contentment borrow*
To the poor man's King, a poor man's plain^^^^^ shall (...)
And thus complain, unto his Majesty.
The poor man's breast, in seas of sorrow ^^^^^ost,
For shipwreck looks, hopes anke^^^^^s all are lost.
Oh where is mercy, does the poor man ask,
On earth to find, it were a wondrous task.
The word alone, is easy to be found,
But as a word, it has no more then sound.
Contempt, and scorn, extortion, Enuies rage,
They flourish b^^^^^st, in this remorceles age.
The poor may say, feeling oppressions wrong,
That few or none, will sing King David's song.
This rotten world, does painted garments wear,
Leaves without s^^^^^uit, prosessions name does bear.
Blessed charity, divine religio^^^^^s grace,
Now stearu'd to death, has but a pictures place*
Celestial Love, the goulden chain of piety.
Is turned to lust, and clothed in sins variety.
Friendships best show, deceit and fraud does (...),
Dissembling friends, are wrapped in flatteries smoke.
Plain dealyng men, that honest plainness use,
Them to uphold, does every hand refuse.
Clam Claw^^^^^ack he, with Peter Pi^^^^^k* (...) (...),
To reap reward, even from the worthiest hands.
Fair words feeds fools, best wise men are mi^^^^^led,
Even by that baire, wherewith most fools are fed.
Well, will they speak, whose thoughts (...) (...) evil,
In words a Saint, in (...), a (...) (...).
Who does desire worlds wise (...) to (...),
Must learn by art, with cunning to (...),
He that is not, beyond all compass hollo^^^^^,
His wit is gross, and his invention shallow.
Good policy, has lost commended use,
Bad politics, boast, in that words abuse.
A faithles wit, is wisdom which excelles,
They are best wise, that most are (...).
Wisdom it self, it self does much disgrace,
When as it strives, a shadow to embrace.
As if that men should here for ever live,
So they themselves unto the world do give.
Poor men that in this world, do want worlds wealth,
Are sure to want, love, friends, meat, drink, clothes. health
This proves lives, each for himself cries all,
Great (...) thereby, from heaven to hell do fall.
The poor man thus, this world his tour^^^^^e does serve,
Steal, and be hanged, or mourning, sigh and starve.
Wet eyes, sad hearts, poor men oppressed and grieved,
May live, or die, vnpittied, vnreleeued.
Great wealth that (...), evil gotten riches fast,
Will not his bread, upon the water cast*
Sadly poor men, may mourn their wretched thrall,
Whilst rich men add, more bitterness to gal.
Proudly, rich pomp (with proudnesse) pride adorneth,
Proud wealth, the poor ma^s poorenes, proudly scorneth
Poor, poorly sits, his poverty deploring,
Wealth (as his God) sits heaps of dirt adoring.
What old Churles gets, by extortious usury,
Young fools do spend, in pride and luxury.
Vain, Vainest, Vainness, Vanity does nourish,
In silk and gold, vain ones do vainly flourish.
Experience tells, Prides painted prodigality,
Has cut the throat, of wonted hospitality.
The poor man's want, no painted Pecock feels,
Poor souls must not come ne^^^^^e Prides wagon wheel^^^^^.
Silks must be worn, what price so ere they cost,
Three suites perhaps, ere once the book be crossed.
Proud female fel^^^^^s, are like the Ostridge plumed,
And Soldiers now, by chamber wars consumed,
Such in their caps must gallant feathers wear,
Who in their hearts do such like lightness bear:
Nature; no Art, beautifies the blood
As fair, as sweet, both artificial good.
Musk, Ciuit, and Imbrothery, high prized vain,
Has charity, with Prides corruption slain.
Pride has so much a decent form forsook,
As now proud heads through gridi^^^^^on ribs must look.
So much is loved the tricks of French attire,
As many are more Frencht then they desire.
Pripe puppet-like in Female folly flings,
with a good gowns charge, in one vain pair of wings.
worlds pomp, worlds wrack, worlds woe, worlds misery
Pride, not content to go, gets wings to fly.
Court, Prides devise, our gentry imitates,
The City follows, each, each ruinates.
The yoemans name, proud minds will not allow,
All Gentles, Knights, Ladies or Beggars now.
Pride bears that wealth, upon presumptions back,
That makes the poor, so much releife to lack.
Italian tricks have raised the ancient rent,
In idle Pomp must be most bounty spent.
Gay Clothes, Rich Plate, fine Houses, Jewels, Rings,
To public weal, pale deaths consumption brings.
Pride, to defend base proud ambitions fort,
A Cotage makes to seem a princely Court.
Now to maintain the pomp of th^^^^^iftles sending,
Each subtle brain must be in Law contending.
A hurtful swarm of hungry trencher-flies,
To fat themselves, can wrangling tricks devise.
With foggy sweat, the Lazy lubbers toil,
Desir's to feed upon his countries spoil.
Oh were they Tith'd, and all the Nie^^^^^ths cast by,
Each tenth would serve to labor honestly.
Their wits can make such wondrous heaps their own,
As molehills are to mighty mountains grown.
Wealths current in a threefold stream does run,
Two floods are past, the third not yet begun,
The Clergy first, the Law^^^^^er next getts much,
The end of time will make the Soldier rich.
Goods by deceit, cunning, fraud and wrong,
Together scrapt, will not continue long.
The mother Church, locked up a goulden store,
To feed it self, and to relieve the poor.
That bounty which did unto all sorts give,
Fatts but a few, the most must poorly live.
Wealth which it self did to good use dispose,
Now serves to paint an idle velvet hose.
The stock grown poor, which should maintain good preachers,
Makes Cobblers now to seem sufficient teachers.
All sorts can prate and talk of things divine,
In few or none a righteous life does shine.
Brave plumed gallants, made gay with silken suites,
On Gods pure word, amongst their cups disputes.
A tavern, dice, wine, sugar, and a wench,
Much love to them, does good devotion quench.
The Papa^^^^^ sea, does think good works do merit,
The Protestant his ^^^^^aith must heaven inherit.
For to evil use, one does good works devise,
The other does good works, to use despise.
Time past, did to the world, this truth reveal,
A blind devotion, hindered faithful zeal.
Time present does, this truth for certain show,
Least good we do, when most we seem to know.
The Heathen men did so themselves incline,
That Stoycks seemed (then we) far more divine.
Amongst them was, the law of mine and thine,
With better faith, though in a faithless time.
They served their Gods, with a religious care,
And did their laws obey, with trembling fea^^^^^e.
The God of Gods, to us in truth declared,
We live, as though, nor heaven, nor hell we feared.
Jerusalem, men seem as if they sought,
But going wrong, they are to Babell brought,
Some fools do think, to find the way by chance,
And thither run, as in a Mor^^^^^ice dance.
Some at a play, have wisely more discerned,
Then ever they, at any Sermon learned.
Who from the Stage, would fetch heavens admonitions
Let Woodcocks be, unto those fools Physicians.
By-ways to seek, and tread in paths uneven,
Such trauailers nere find the way to heaven.
No shadow can, substanciall hope beguild,
If on Gods word, faith does arightly build.
In building new, men use such curious cost,
As that the most, have best foundation lost.
Some think such power, in them remains still,
As Gods commandments, break and keep they will;
But if there did, such strength in us remain,
God then should use, saluations means in vain.
What Adam lost, all humane race did lose,
And what he kept, that for our part we chose.
Will, to do good, that force in Adam died,
Since when, that grace was to his seed denied.
So in our selves, sin every action stains,
That to do good, in us no power remains.
From Heaven, where God does in his glory dwell,
By Adams fall, he and his children fell,
And when to rise, no means at all they knew,
The promisd seed, did Death, and hell subdue.
We are restor^^^^^d by our Redeemers hand,
Not of our selves, but by his grace we stand.
Then let the souls, of righteous men express,
That in their Christ, does live their righteousness.
I sigh to hear some vilde ones, vildly say,
That unto life or death, foredoomd are they,
A soul d^^^^^ownde up, in hellish desperation,
Says he believes in Gods predestination.
Or heaven, or hell, or well, or evil to do,
He has or does, what he is ordaind unto.
Taught by the devil, falsely affirm he can,
Without Gods will, there is nothing done by man.
Our knowledge has, brought forth infectio^^^^^s fruit,
When hell* borne ^^^^^mpes, dares thus like devils (...)*
Ears stopped, and hearts, with burning Irons seared,
As ^^^^^uell are for Gods fierce wrath prepared*
Who thinks of sin that God the author is,
Shall be exempt from Gods eternal bliss.
The strength of Gods vncomprehended state,
Is that whereby we are predestina^^^^^e.
Yet does he suffer, what he does not will,
Wherein his Power is undivided still.
The evil we do, he wills not to be done,
For in our selves that cause is first begun:
God by his Grace, does so man's soul attend,
As that we know what it is for to offend.
If evil we do, and shall his gr^^^^^ce reject.
The fault is ours, for done by our neglect.
Heavens justice then, most justly does dispense,
Presumptuous sin, is a most damned offense.
Do well, and then in Christ thy deeds are known,
Do ^^^^^uill, and sin, is in thy self thine own.
Be not deceived, good works thy faith must prove;
For God in Christ does all good actions love.
Christ dyed for me, so each believer says,
As Infidels are men of fruitless faith.
Profession fi^^^^^, it does too much dissemble,
Not using that which most Christ does resemble.
Where are the hands which should poor creatures cherish
Christ saues not those that lets his members perish?
Do good to them that of faiths household be,
No, the world delights their greatest wants to see.
On earth alas, to whom should poor men fly,
In vain their words tells forth their misery.
Honor which should the poor man's cause defend,
Helps not that hope which does thereon depend
Compassion so in all estates is vanished,
As by decree, it were from all sorts banished.
Religions name, is but dessemblers mockery,
And seeming saints, are maskt in hells hypocrisy.
Oh in this age, such is the worlds condition,
As this word poor, does spoil the poor petition.
Poor man, poor hope, poor to thy plaint not put,
Poor against it self, it self, al doors does shut.
The poor man's heart, with grief to death is stung,
In vain he speaks that wants a goulden tongue.
Silent be he whose come his cause declares,
A feeling sense, which understanding hears.
An honest name, divine religion two,
Is bought and sold, all this can money do.
Who to good fame by gou den steps can mount,
Him does this world, for worthiest man account.
Let virtue in a poor man clearly shine,
A gilded gull is counted more divine.
A satin suite, be daubed with silver lace,
Beyond desert, does vildest clou^^^^^ship grace.
Immodest talk, and shameless ribaldry,
With monstrous oaths is court like blasphemy.
In money now there is such wondrous might,
As that a clown will strive to be a knight.
Bright Honers wreath vain idle fools will crave it,
That want wherewith to keep it when they have it.
No doubt but now a gallant velvet company,
Three times a week may banquit with Duck Hum^^^^^ery.
In blood our gallants once called to use wor^^^^^ (...),
With running they will swe^^^^^t most fearfully.
They Will do no less unto the filled once led,
Then Romes brave youths for their great Pompay did.
Proud (...) looks, in scorn of all disgraces,
Will turn their backs, to save their amorous faces.
A face stark naught, in fear of present harms,
Muffels it self, with cross wreth'd recreant arms.
when once Sir money Knight, hears the fier'd mouthed guns,
He startes, and shakes, and swears, and hence he runs.
Disgrace not deares, to touch the worthy merit,
Of any valiant well resolved spirit.
What is it the worst may not for money buy,
Honor, much Love; and seeming honesty.
Rich let him be, and who ca^^^^^ hurt him then,
Knaves wrapped in wealth, are counted honest men.
Honest, if poor, he this reward must have,
Hang him ba^^^^^e roage, proud beggar, impious knave.
No place nor o^^^^^fice can the poor man buy,
Wealth near so vilde, can mount it self on high.
Such is the ^^^^^orce, of this corrupted time,
Down trampled poor, helps wealth aloft to clime.
Wealth does so much, from natures law digress,
As that it feeds upon the poor man's flesh.
Seven lea^^^^^e beasts had, of seven fat oxen, power,
But now seven ^^^^^at, do seauenty lean devour.
Rich men do make, poor trad^^^^^s-men faint and sweat,
Who in their wants, their clothes, and tools, must eat*
The science, which made Englands weal to flourish,
And of the poor did many thousands non^^^^^ish.
Must now enrich, a foreign strangers store,
And leave us heaps of vnreleeued poor.
From England if, raw clothes might not be sent,
It would redress poor p^^^^^oples languishment.
And pay far more, in task, and subsidy,
Then now is raised, to Brittons Majesty.
In common wealth, a man may thousands see,
That common wealths-men do disdain to be.
Self scraping gain, the children are of sloth,
In public weal, they are like mothes in cloth.
Monopoli^^^^^ans are they whose policy,
Commits a vilde, yet unchecked felony.
Let poor men thus of this or that complain,
Rich men will hold the course whereby they gain.
Who finds fault with things that are amiss,
If he be poor, he must affliction kis^^^^^e.
The poor man says that Justice wants a hand,
It beats, the bad, not helps the good to stand.
That Sovereign Mistres should the evil reject,
But not refuse, her children to protect.
Oppression swims amidst ex^^^^^ortions streams,
And does not know, what restitution means.
Rich men do wrong, no; it is right though it be wrong,
At lest he makes it so, whose (...) is strong.
A poor man struck, his cry hates ^^^^^age does threaten,
For crying then he must again be beaten.
Poor men accus^^^^^d, though no offense be proved,
Hate is th^^^^^ir meede, they are of none beloved.
Do evil, and then, Justice will seize on thee,
Do well, and then, thou shall contempned be.
From good desert, (...) reward is stealing,
Trust, wan ing truth, does use perfidious dealing.
Like (...) fish, let poor men swim or fly,
They have no means; to shun their misery.
A poor man whilst his grief, woes passion weepeth,
Dispai^^^^^e, the door of his affliction keeps.
A mind whose thoughts, no force no^^^^^ danger fears,
Is forced to weep, his wife and childrens tears.
Vain sighs, vain tears, when want proclaims (...) woe,
The poor man knows not unto whom to go.
Poor man, poor wife poor children all rejected,
Apes, Parrets, Dogs, and Monkeys more respected,
The poor man's words plainly and truly tells,
He cannot find, the place where Mercy dwells,
And yet he seeks, and has a long time sought,
His labou^^^^^ has his woes enlargement wrought.
For whilst he waits on time, best time observing,
Himself and his by want of food are steruing.
Those hands cannot, their Countries weal preserve,
Which in their Count^^^^^y must endure to sterue*
Hard world when love to do^^^^^ a thing most just,
Shall cause the poor that wrong endure they must.
Justice, love, (...), and faith, all these are raced,
When things well done, must be with force disgraced,
When Law commands an action to be done,
Why should that act into vilde scandal run,
If so the law and makers thereof must,
In cause of evil be justly blamed first.
To King and State, a Soldiers honest love,
Has causde his heart, sad woes extremes to prove,
A Sou^^^^^diers h^^^^^nd, half starved, and wanting might,
Shall for them both want force and power to fight.
No peace on earth, though seeming most secure,
Can well resolve, how long it shall endure.
When wars sta^^^^^u'd force, threatens a kingdoms land,
B^^^^^st safety then lives in the Soldiers hand.
In peace me thinks, those men should not be ste^^^^^ued,
By whom the strength of peace, is best preserved.
I^^^^^ to respect time present barbarous be,
The time to come, should wisdoms eyes foresee.
All those great nations which themselves dispe^^^^^se,
Upon the bosom of worlds universe.
For rash attempts are not so much condemned,
As is that I Will, in which our selves are hemined,
P^^^^^oud wit, that is with self conceitment swollen,
Makes fast the door, when first the steed is stolen.
An after-wit, is counted Englands guise,
A forehand looks judicial wisdoms eyes,
For gain, men will their lives and country sell,
A general spoil, makes some to prosper well.
Our Corn that goes unto corruptions friend,
May feed a strength against our selves to bend.
We not respect although both heaven and ear^^^^^h,
Do in their course foretell a threatened dearth*
As Dragons we our selves desire to bite,
Our hands, our selves do most unkindly smite.
Wars weapons we unto those countries send,
Whose use at last will most our selves offend.
We have no fear, our land no danger knows,
Until it feels the force of dangers blows.
Britain has foes, who in their thoughts do strive,
How best they may our countries harm contriue.
But this I think, our ^^^^^ame shall thus be spread,
We may be beat, but never conquered.
I would to God our land may so provide,
As we at first might kill presumptions pride.
Peace smiles on us, but view heavens motion well,
Combustious times does Sun and Moon foretell.
This years Eclipse, a fatal period makes,
And God thereby all earths foundation shaketn.
The Planets in their ^^^^^spects differ far,
From former time by course irregular.
The Crab, and Goat, whose Circles do divide,
The sweating Summer, from frostie Winters tide.
Keep still the times, of ancient nomination,
But want the force, of wonted operation,
Ver, Eastus, Autumn^^^^^, Hymen, all grown strange,
Seem as they would, their seasons each exchange.
Celestial fyers, that round this world impale,
And should from hence, corruptions dregs exhale.
Leaves them beneath, that noisome pestilence,
On earth, might fetch, material cause from thence.
When from the grave, corruptions slime does soake,
Mantling the earth, in clouds of stiucking smoke.
Devouring creatures in that fogge shall breed,
Earths breast shall then, her children scarcely feed.
Corruption gross, thick, fat sad, slimie, slow,
Shall by the Sun, to a combustion grow.
Those dreggs congeald, by steps to hugeness creepes,
By Ayery Orbs, a wandering motion keeps.
Turning about, from place to place, their sent,
Spreading themselves, on earths vast continent.
Taking the shapes, from whence they first did grow,
In Ayerie forms like men and beasts they show.
When so they do themselves, with wonder spreed,
It tells* they still expect on Death to feed.
Amidst some plain, so are those Mea^^^^^ures spread,
As were an army there imbattelled.
And when they thus, on heaps together cluster,
They fummon men, unto a general muster.
But human eyes amazde, cannot dispense
With reasons force, of Natures influence.
Inuolued heaps, grown once unmeasured great,
They strive to rise; against the Clouds to beat.
Exhaled once, in rotten showers do fall,
Infectious drops, such as men Mill-dewes call.
And then at last, in Middle- Region fed,
They are with force from thence exturbated.
And having climbde the upper Regions hem,
To blazing fiery Commets turned then.
For so our God by mighty wonder makes,
Prodigious fires, threatening Kingdoms states.
Then shall the vilde ones of this world despair,
When they behold, such flames amidst the air.
A while beneath, those exhalations stays,
Which shortly will, foretell some dangerous days.
But not to build on human foolery,
I thus much ground on scriptures Prophecy.
EVen in the days when the seventh Angel should,
Begin to blow his Trumpet, then God would
His Ministry accomplished should be,
As to his Prophets before reueald had he.
The Angeli has, long time his Trumpet blown,
Which to the world, worlds latter end has shown.
Before which time the worlds Deceivers must,
By wraths fierce hand, be all in sunder burst.
And first falls he, with stroke of Iron rod,
Who in Gods Church, does sit as he were God.
With suttell craft, when he suspects his fall,
By secret force, himself defend he shall.
When as against him, a long feared power does grow,
Such as before, the world could never show.
Then desperate mad, his anger and his fear,
Against that power, a secret wrath shall bear.
To hell his hope, does for assistance fly,
And then corrupt earths Princes secretly.
An host of tigers shall them selves combine,
With savage hogs to spoil the (...) vine.
And think from grapes to draw a bleding flood,
When in one night, shall rain a shower of blood.
A winter gre^^^^^ne their summers hope does make,
They think their force shall cause ^^^^^oues Island shake.
That down they might heavens goulden Palace take,
A strenth shall rise from hells infernal lake.
The Leopard, the Wolf, the Fox, all these,
Shall unawares; upon the Lion sease-
The Lion rows d his foes shall soon be torn,
With him shall join the princely Unicorn.
And push the best with his all clensing horn,
And make him wish he never had bin borne.
Hells dogs shall think oa^^^^^e mountain tops to clime,
But break their necks before their wished for time.
They are mustering now of Satan's regiment,
Their plot is laid hope feeds their vild intent.
When time shall be into combustion thrown,
And falsehoods nurse to hostile actions grown.
Wars thunder then, when it sha^^^^^l shake the world,
People shall be into amasement whorld.
A sca^^^^^let horce shall stomble and fall down,
And after him a triple hallowed crown.
The beast whose legs of claye, and Irone, wrought,
Must be unto a fearful ruin brought*
Because Gods t^^^^^uth for to defile he sought,
He and his sea shall wast and come to noug^^^^^t.
(...) seat does shake and reele I see him ^^^^^alling,
The wounded monster, on the earth lies scravvling.
He gapes for breath, strangled himself he choakes,
About his ears, his painted Palace smoakes.
Down tumble must, that triple crowned whore,
Once fal^^^^^e, her fall not any shall deplore.
But those that would her spotted garments wear,
Whose foreheads do, the mark of Dagon bear.
The Champions all, which would the best maintain,
Shall at his feet, by conquering swords be slain.
Gog overthrown, Mag^^^^^g shall think to come,
With fire and sword, through glorious Christendom,
From E^^^^^phrates, and Tygris, then shall ^^^^^ise,
A strength, that will, our tyrants tyrannise.
Arabians Gul^^^^^e, to Percias Gulf shall flow,
From whence, a high reard softly flood shall grow.
Whose Sea like waves, from thence to Fes shall roll,
Down tumbling all, that would their force control.
R^^^^^uenge, and death, to war^^^^^es alarums leads.
The Eagles last continued monstrous heads.
The mountain VVol^^^^^es from Christian bounds called hence,
Christians then, by force shall drive them thence.
And Christendom, whilst God her peace does shield,
Shall strive aright, in her Gods house to build.
That she may teach, the nations thus to say,
Her Christ is God, we will his laws obey.
Our Bishops then, the truth shall ratify,
In order chief, not in authority,
And that Religion shall stand most beloved,
Whose rule is best by Scriptures truth approved,
And for a Judge, a Church find out we can,
That knew the truth, before the Pope began.
Then shall the Church be built on Peter's faith,
And that believe, which holy Scripture says.
Then shall Gods Church her strength and glory see,
When Christ alone, her corner stone shall be.
Above Gods word, shall then be raisde no head,
By Christ their Sheapheard, shall his flock be lead.
Such Union shall the Northren Prince contriue,
As Christians shall no more with Christians strive.
Then Christendom, shall all her power bestow,
By force to work the Pagans overthrow.
All Christian Princes, will themselves protect,
As shall the Northren Prince their course direct.
And now me thinks, I see a glorious sight,
A Christian Army, shining wondrous bright,
Marching in wars (...) fit for fight,
In the defense of their Redeemers ^^^^^ight.
The Northren Emperor, does the red cross bear,
To who^^^^^e command, the army craves to swea^^^^^e.
With (...) blood, their warlike weapons stains,
(...) fields, and fair Hungarian plains.
Whilst (...), Ismael, and the cursed seed,
Do strive to make each others breast to bleed.
Working that work, for which they were compou^ded,
That each by other, may be with war consounded.
The t^^^^^mperour of the North, that Prince of fame,
Brings Christendom into her wonted frame.
And all that did unto that Empire bend,
At last shall back, unto that state descend.
Empires, and Kingdoms, shall at once recoile,
And bend their strength, to work their spoilers spoil.
Those locked up Devils, in wildest Mountains bred,
Whom Christian hands, from thence deliueted;
To whom at first, the Sarazens gave pay,
By whom at last, themselves destroyed were they;
By all that strength, which has their wrong endured,
Shall be at last their rac'd out name procured.
Sara, and Ketura, shall a conquest win,
Of whom there is a mighty power unseen.
And then once more, in pomp of Empire swells,
Those that are calde Religious (...).
Before they do the sacred truth retain,
Among them is (...) and Elias slame.
From forth the North, a Lions voice shall rore,
And make them then, the murdered dead deplore.
The doctrine which they taught, once calde to mind,
Shall Heathens teach, the way heavens path to find.
Old Magog then new built, his name shall loose,
And for his God, the God of Gods shall choose.
The Northren Empire, shall to him disclose,
That Truth, against which he did himself oppose.
The Persians shall the Christians kindly greet,
When both their Armies, shall with conquest meet.
Mount Harmons dew, that sweetly then distills,
From off the tops of fair Arabian hills:
Shall fall on them, of Abraham's line the race,
Though yet unseen, by faith the seeds of grace.
Then hungry Dogs, no more a stray shall wander,
Iudeas race, shall find the Bridegromes chamber.
Time takes in hand, to work this wonder great,
A Northren blast, must cool the Sothern heat.
For of the Princes that shall work this thing,
The worthiest power, from forth the North shall spring,
A Potent Prince, a strong and powerful King,
His famous deeds, through all the world shall ring.
It is established, and his Throne shall stand,
Whose force shall take a wondrous work in hand.
In his blessed Li^^^^^e triumphant glory goes,
With glorious Race of conquering Emperors.
This is the wind; and Lion of the wood,
From whom a most Imperial strength shall bud.
And to the Eagle, in wrathes fires fury speak,
And al his wings, and Feathers, pe^^^^^cemeale break.
The Heathens he, at judgments bar shall set,
And make them know the power against which they fre^^^^^.
He shall the land from Paganism deliver,
And wash heavens flock, in faith's saluations river.
He shall the earth, with heavenly grace refresh,
And unto her, heavens laws with truth express.
The foes whereof he shall with force destroy,
And turn earths bondage into freedoms joy.
Set free her hope, shall wait on that salvation,
whose mercies judgment, laid her first foundation.
This Royal line, the whole continuance, sums,
Of all the years until great Shil^^^^^ comes.
God shortly will the business undertake,
For which he does the Northen Empier make.
Upon his head, stands an Imperial Crown,
Whose Monarchy shall throw Romes Empire down.
Fools though they brag, their cloud of earths elus^^^^^on,
Both must, and shall, come to a rac't confusion.
And that ear long, time does a course begin,
Whereby consumed shall be, worlds sink of sin.
This happen shall, and when these signs appear,
Know then the day of judgment draws near.
Be I excusd, and not condempn'd of men,
No deuill-borne Merline, does direct my pen.
Unto an end time does each creature drive,
From holy writ do I these words derive.
This rotten age, pointing at worlds decay,
But well observed, does wondrous things bewray.
Both heaven, and earth, mankind so loades with sin,
They pray heavens God, he would their rest begin.
And set them in that state wherein they stood,
When God made all, and said all things were good.
Of time to come, what means my pen to write?
Whom present time, holds in such base despite.
In spite of time, and times unkind ^^^^^espising,
My time shall be, my countries good devising.
The times abuse, let time to come, amend
For trifles, let not time with, truth contend.
A union, and a uniform conclude,
Oh let no shadows, this happiest time delude.
Unto the Church, a glorious time is sent,
Things now decreed, must be worlds president.
Let then this time, foresee with judgments sight,
By sacred law, to rule all actions right.
Time must suppress all such untimely fruit,
As does it self in Scisme and Faction suite.
Condemn not those, either of Scisme, or Faction,
Whose lives are given to every godly action.
Let goodmen use wise wisdoms sound advise,
Least causeless fear, makes them unwisely nice,
Who so their wills, before their wit prefer,
By wilfulnes, may most unwisely err.
Indifferent things, not hindering good devotion,
Wise men for them, should raise no vain commotion.
No true Church can her glory dignifie,
Whose power Commands against written verity.
We may observe, what ere the wrangler says,
Rules that are held within the list of faith.
True faith in which saluations strength is found,
It must it self, upon the scriptures ground.
Things done which do not hinder faiths belief?
Why should they seem to work Religious grief?
Me thinks we do unto religion wrong,
By seeming week, when faith should make us strong.
Foxes, dumb dogs, let no man them prefer,
Nor such as those, that too contentio^^^^^s are.
Let not divines like physic doctors be,
The more the worse, and most lack honesty.
Nor let our hope upon this motion rest,
To keep the worst and cast away the best.
Those tri^^^^^les which do now dissturbe our peace,
Could men be wise, they of themselves would cease.
The consort of a lawful ministr^^^^^e,
Must be on earth heavens sweetest harmony.
Oh let them then, that do Gods vineyard keep,
Watch, preach, and pray, and not like sluggards sleep.
Paul shau'd his head, and did thereby intend,
His course might not his brethren weak offend.
Join in on tru^^^^^h, with blessed unity,
Great Britains ^^^^^ame adorn and beautify.
Fear not, but know, for it is Albions dome,
Her kings shall never yield their Crown to Rome.
Then let heavens flock, with patient souls abide,
Although like gold, they must be seven times tri'de.
When God does mean to scourge a land for sin,
At his own house the blow must first begin.
Who so will be, the glorious Bridegromes Bride,
Must in afflictions flames be purified.
The path to glory, is no pleasant way,
Take up thy cross, and seek eternal joy.
Whilst Preachers preach, of Christ his sacred deity,
Where are the deeds of Mercy, Love, and Piety?
Where are the fruits, Religion should bring forth?
When Saint-like show, ungodly actions does.
Ou^^^^^ seeming zeal does this report preserre,
We scornful, proud, and merely faithless are.
A seeming friend, will friendships name delude,
And stain himself with hels ingratitude.
One by his friend, both raisde to wealth and credit,
His thanks shall be, to cut his throat that did it.
Let but a muck-heape, possess great heaps of gould,
And Honor then, shall be by him contrould.
Each witless peasant, by his wealth made proud,
Thinks he talks well, and if he speaks but loud.
A servile mind, his hopes at lowest ebb,
Worships, as God, the golden Calse in Hereb.
Though by the poor, the rich are honored*
Yet by the rich, the poor may starve unfed.
Our lamenesse must, with skillful Art be dressed,
So out of joint are all our actions wrested.
Great Britain know, a time will come to thee,
In which thy sin, shall sharply punished be.
Therefore repent, least judgments follow fast,
First plague, then dearth, and use of swords at last.
Be reconcilde, though God will not abhor thee*
Yet he prepares an angry judgment for thee.
Thy pride, and proud contempt of Gods pure word,
Makes Heaven against thee, to draw a wr^^^^^thfull sword.
Thy whordoms lust, and drunkards blasphemy,
Extortion, bribes, and hateful vsinie,
Lies, fraud, deceit, and poores oppression,
Slownesse to good, from God thy swift digression,
Will bring on thee a wrath to plague thee so,
As thou shall groan, with se^^^^^se of feeling woe.
With seeming Saints, the time not temporize,
A broken heart to God is sacrifice.
Wraths (...) ^^^^^eares, shall whip thee for thy sin,
Unless thou do for to repent begin.
Such judgments do, against thee themselves assemble,
As were they seen, would make hels Ruffins tremble,
Heavens gracious God, be pleased for thine elect,
Fair Albions good, with safety to protect,
Direct us so, that we to thee may turn,
That then against us thy wrath may cease to burn.
The swarms sent from the Antechristian beast,
Confound them Lord, let them in no place rest.
And those by whom, our harm is yet concealed,
In thy good time, be all their plottes revealed.
Great Britain, do thou not despair, but mourn.
In sorrow, let repentant robes be worn,
That when thou sightst for thy Redeemers name,
Thy deeds in war, may dignifie thy fame.
From foreign coasts, the thing which most thee harms,
Is Englands Armor, wanting English arms.
And Englishmen from use of war exempt,
Are often proved cowards in the first attempt,
A Soldiers name, though now it be refused,
A time will come, when Soldiers must be used.
Not every one that bears a Soldiers name,
If rightly tried, will be approved the same.
It is not he, that drinks sick healths, and swears,
That in a Tavern, proudly swagger dares,
Nor he that does, a misled Mistress keep,
And vows for her, his sword in blood to steep.
Nor he that fears, neither God nor devil,
Whose daily actions, are the worst of evil.
He is no Soldier, that wants virtues stay,
Who loves to make a desperate drunken ^^^^^ray.
That is no valor, nor resolution right,
That vainly will for worthless trifles fight.
But they do best, a Soldiers name approve,
Who wisely do their reputation love.
Be he a Soldier, worthy praise to win,
Who fears his God, and hates the deeds of sin.
He whose body and stomach can digest,
Heat, cold, hunger, thirst, much pains, and little rest.
He that can well imbattell soon his men,
And knows in clouds o^^^^^ smoke to skirmish then.
He that leads on, and with discretion leads,
And least dismaide, when most in blood he treads.
He that when thousands, do with thousands fight,
By word, or sign, can give directions right.
He that so can, both charge and make retraite,
As Honor still upon his steps shall weight.
That Fortitude, joined with sound judgments sense,
Is wrought of more, then natures quintessence.
Those Soldiers are of greatest excellence,
Whose lives and deaths, have honors recompense.
A poor man, if a Soldier rightly tried,
King Harry would have placed him by his side.
Those spirits which are fit for war esteemed,
Amongst the best, be they the worthiest deemed.
Be they embraced with loves respective arm,
Whose hands know how to shield our peace from (...)
I do not wish; but doubt wars rattling drum,
Ere long to arms will summon Christendom.
The Red-crosse though it may some times retire,
At last his same shall to the heavens aspire.
Great Britain so, is by Gods hand instal'd,
As it shall be the land of conquest called.
But now to ease a poor man's grieved mind,
In things above, my sight shall comfort find.
I know the time, when I poor wretch rejected,
Shall as the best, be no whit less respected.
When Kings, and Queens of greatest excellence,
Twixt them, and me, shall be no difference.
And there dwells Mercy, Oh there a Savior lives,
That to the poor, saluations comfort gives.
Not many Kings, nor Queens, nor Nobles shall,
Triumph before heavens throne maiesticall.
But those that in this world their heaven do make,
Shall in that world, before Gods judgment shake.
The beauty which on earth no praise does lack,
Maskt up in shame, hels sulphur smoke, makes black.
The snow white hand, moist, soft, foul sins desire.
Shall burn in lake of hels eternal fire.
where devils, men's souls, with fiery darts strikes through,
And in their jaws, like dogs, they them shall worow,
Where God does so his angers judgment frame,
As that his wrath shall blow, hels endless flame.
Ever, Ever, oh fearful word, for ever,
Where plagues increase, but shall be ended never.
Where torment brings torments, with fresh supply.
Where dying souls do live, but never dye.
And there is the place, where earths proud dignity,
Shall plunge it self in endless misery.
But happy those, whose souls by grace made pure,
Exempt from wrath, shall no such plagues endure.
And most of them poor souls, scornd and disgraced.
Are those that shall with God and Christ be placed.
When most on earth, the poor despisde do stand,
It does presage Christ's coming near at hand.
Dejected, base, and outcast poverty,
Rejoice, triumph, in Mercies clemency.
You are heavens flock, a Shepherd does you keep,
Who of his number will not loose a sheep.
Thus has my sigh, an honest passion breathed,
And of my woes, a weeping garland wreathed.
My sighs, my tears, my woes, my griefs lament,
My plaints, my groans, all fruits of discontent*
Do not themselves, upon one substance feed,
A general doubt, makes heart and soul to bleed.
A general cuill, a land to vildenesse bent,
Must needs expect some fearful punishment.
Of present time, the things desired here,
Time proves my words, and makes the truth appear.
Of time to come, I humbly do auowe,
Experience shall my words for truth allow.
Search but the Story of that writ divine,
And understand the change of every time.
Five hundred, fifty two years coumpted was,
A period whole, which ever brought to pass,
Strange alterations, both in Church and State,
Kings, Kingdoms then, did strive to ruinate.
Temples were rac'te, Religion clean despisde,
Tyrants by force of sword, new laws deuisde.
And now the time does on such period stand,
As if it meant to take like course in hand.
Do but observe, each Celestial sphere,
And see what signs do in their course appear.
Compare the time, with antedated times,
And understand the Heavens true speaking signs.
Then will you not these lines of mine deride,
Nor smother them, with smoke of scornful pride.
A Soldiers writing, like his fighting is,
His course no^^^^^ knows, how dangers rocks to miss.
Those Pens do most, their hopes in pieces batter,
That cannot best with oyled smoothness flatter.
A Soldiers name, strive not for to disgrace,
Poor should not be accounted (...) base.
And that I may not from the truth digress,
My humble lines, shall thus my state express.
The Soldier which does scorn the lie to take,
Should scorn as much himself the lie to make.
The open fields, to me is made my bed,
A bancke of earth, a pillow for my head.
In shadie groves, and sollitary places,
My steps do make their sorrows mournful traces.
Imprisonment, woes woeful habitation,
Has forced my Muse, to secret contemplation.
In winter nights, when I a Soldier was,
Alone my Muse, should private motions toss.
When in the war, I wars attire did bear,
My books to me, most kind companions were.
And some sad hours, on skie-born^^^^^ books I read,
Amongst the flarres, an humble path I tread.
And see the great, and strange Con^^^^^unctions there,
Of angry, Saturn, Mars, and Jupiter.
Since fi^^^^^st the Planets disclosde their variation,
Saturn near had more Lord-like domination.
What it foretells, my wea^^^^^y Muse sorgets,
In Dragons tail, when strange Conjunction sets.
His name stands rouled in perditions book,
Whose tail from heaven, of stars the third part struck.
Under the Dragons tail, is fixed fast,
A strength that shall, him and his tail down cast.
Mankind, the stars that Heaven should (...),
Shall be vpreard, with glorious dignity.
Though observation rightly may collect,
The judgment of some retrograde aspect:
Yet Christ, our King and kingdoms has possessed,
With that wherein ourselves, and world, is blessed.
Though L^^^^^os house has such reflection glided,
As tells there is, some wondrous thing provided.
I leave to write, and will conceit the rest,
Our land shall still by Gods great love be blessed.
A constant faith, true resolution proves,
Fears not what under the first moouer mooues.
And in this thought I see with humble eye,
The mighty work of Prima ^^^^^obili.
And know the world, in fiery flames shall burn,
Before he does, to his first point return.
For Heaven and earth, by fire once purgd, then sure,
They shall remain, as they at first were pure.
When God the world, to judgment summon will,
That first great mouer, keeps his motion still*
Whose slow pace round, does roundly comprehend,
Those lesser Orbs, that under him do wend.
In order each, his fixed journey takes,
And in their turns, celestial music makes.
And then I think of that most happy time,
When I shall hear their dulsiue heavenly chime.
Above them all, faiths eyes through Bethelem,
Be holds the glory, of new Jerusalem.
Where sits upon a Throane maiesticall,
The mighty maker of this wondrous all.
When thither once my joyful thoughts are sent,
I am amazde with wonders rauishment.
Nor tongues, nor Pens, nor Angels can express,
The glory of that glorious happiness.
From thence to Luna, not any Orb to miss,
I cannot find, where Purgatory is.
So that I think, it sure remains yet,
Within their bellies that devised it.
And those that would attain to heavens great joy,
Must leave bye-pathes, and find in Christ their way.
But for the Stars, I creatures them account,
Above them all, their makers power must mount.
And by their influence, more I will not learn,
Then Rules divine, shall teach me to discearne.
And in that course, men sometimes are befriended,
Of those pure fires, by whom they are attended.
God ever yet, by signs and visions told,
So as worlds change, worlds worldlings might behold.
But cloddes of clay, because they will not grieve,
This course they take, to hear, but not believe,
To guess, to speak, to judge, great states to touch,
For me poor soul, it is a strength too much.
Who so does tell what things themselves do show,
May doubt his words will too presumptuous grow.
FVll twenty times, nights Bride her self has chaung'd,
Since from my former work, my muse estraung'd.
Her grieved thoughts, my own estate to view,
Still being fed, with wormwood, gall, and rue.
And now though wrapped in foldes of mournful care,
I am rowsde up, some part with them to bear.
Which do rejoice, as theirs, so is my joy,
That God is pleased hells actions to destroy.
And now my muse in more then wonder wrapped,
Will speak of what, since first she writ has hapt.
Two nights before the night of Englands wrack,
Such greifes themselves upon my breast did pack;
That from woes Cowch I rose alone to walk,
And with myself, of my sad fa^^^^^e to talk.
For when days light upon my face should shine,
I knew those wants, would ^^^^^ip both me and mine.
No sooner up, and forth my chamber stepped,
But straight my thoughts into amasement lept.
For round about, I saw so clear a light,
As that I thought, it rather day then night*
And well I knew that Luna then did please,
To show her self to the Antipedes.
And when aloft I did survey the sky,
There was no stars that any man could spy.
To search the cause resolved of my intent,
I walked abroad to view the Element.
A tossing wind, whorl'd round the earth below,
as from earths womb, some tombling noise did grow.
Said I, such noise as this, is said of some,
For to foretell an Earthquake nere to come:
And looking up, a general seeing flame,
With burning streams, bemantled all heavens frame.
That from one part did not arise lights beams,
But heaven was Clothed, with universal streams.
Amids the Air, I might sometimes epsy,
The flashing flames unto a roundnes fly.
And then dispierce themselves immediately,
The world ore spreeding with a burning Cannopie.
When thus I saw sent from the fiery spheate,
Such burning streams and flashing flames so clear.
Said I, this truth does on these signs depend,
Doubtless the world is near unto her end*
And then I thought, that such despisde as I,
With joy should have, an end of misery.
Thus having viewed till eyes all dazzled were,
My reeling steps, my dussie brains did bear.
To sorrows cell, the Cave of former Care,
Unto my self I did my woes declare.
From Sol, to Mars, with usual attribute,
Four times Aurora in her Crimson sure.
Had bid god morrow to her friends beneath,
Whilst all this time, my grief (woes sighs) did breath*
And then my mind, griefs danger to eschew,
For solace went Gorguntus walls to view.
Abroad, my steps, had me no sooner brought,
But straight my ears had such a rumor caught,
As made me start, and in a maze to wonder,
How hell deuisde, to rend the world in sounder.
A treason no, A devil borne fiery rage,
A work nere thought of in precedent age.
A Savage wrath, whose like nere staynd a story,
Should have destroyed the heaven of Britons glory.
Its true in war, that soldiers not refuse,
Against their foes, the like devise to use.
But in a kingdom, by subjects to their King,
The world till now, nere heard so vilde a thing.
The name of England, with datelesse infamy,
Had stood engraven to worlds posterity.
Breeder of Devils so sit for villainy,
As at one blow, could sack a monarchy.
The whore, whose laws, allows such deeds of horror,
Let heaven, and earth, and all the world abhor her.
The Project of these traiterous homycites,
A book at large to every mind recites.
And though I would, I dare not speak no more,
Of Treason plotts, then has been spoke before.
But now I see, the night that I admyred,
Foretold the flame, that should the world have fiered.
And yet the general of heavens fiety warte,
Included more then on particular.
Oh if that God for Englands sin had pleased,
That horred act, on king and state had seazd.
Great Britons breast had now been drowned in blood,
Rac'd, sacked, and spoiled, bereft of every good.
Theft, murder, Rape, and every act of hell,
Had built their house on Englands face to dwell.
The spoil of man, of humane race the shame,
Would have rac'd out all humane virtues name.
Vilde dissolutes, profane, and insolent,
Like Tirants would have wronged the innocent.
A Goathian Army, amongst ourselves maintained,
Would the^, with blood, our towns and streets have stained.
Our laws of God, our laws of man should then,
have been of force, to govern faithles men.
The rich man's wealth, should not his own have b^^^^^ene*
But made a spoil unto the hands of sin.
Fair London then, her glorious pomp and state,
The vildest hands, would vildely ruinate.
Young maids, and wives, of feature excellent,
Had been abusde by brutish rauishment.
Beauty most rare, if it continued chaste,
Had then unto luxurious arms been cast.
The courtly nymphs, fair, wise, and trimly gay,
That could not but with silks and veluets play.
Whose maskt up che^^^^^kes, from wind and sun are fled,
All fresh to keep their artificial red.
There beauties shield (white breasts) scarce paper proof,
Must then have tumbled with some ruder stuff.
With corresponde^ce, rude arms besmeer'd with grease
Should have embraced a painted sluttishnesse,
And they perhaps, resolved in misery,
Would smi^^^^^e, at that their least calamity.
But minds refined, of purest substance framed,
Such as on earth, may be heavens Angels named.
Whose beauties no adulterate deeds have staind,
But spotless, they have truly chaste remainde.
That Angel number, with hels rage ore spread,
That Heavens impression vildely ravished.
Oh what a terror should their hearts have felt,
When vilde ones would, with them have vildely dealt.
Evil to suppress, when Justice sturd had been,
Then blood and murder, had mainteind hels sin.
The strength which makes the magistrate most strong,
And gives him warrant to suppress each wrong.
The name which does unto the laws give force,
Had hence been snatched, if hell had held his course.
In vain should then the officers have said,
In the Kings name we charge, lets be obeyed.
In the Queens name then if justice out should cry,
Hells howndes had said, she with the king should die.
Prince Henryes name, if justice should have tried,
Sweet Prince he should, with King and Queen have died.
If to the Duke of Torke, our hopes had fled,
Doubtless hells hands, would him have murdered.
Should justice then unto the Princess fly,
She had been seidze by traitors tyranny.
The honored Council, might help the just to save,
For King, Queen, Prince, and them, was made one grave.
Then to the Lords, and Bishops of the land,
They with the rest had dyed by treasons hand.
Should in the Judges then our hope have ioyed?
They with the rest, had been at once destroyed.
From knights and burgesses, if safeties hope distilld,
They with the rest a sulpher flame had kilde.
With bibles then, should faithful preachers press,
And breath forth, judgments against sins wickedness.
And say, Behold, heavens indignation fear,
This book of God, does Gods fierce wrath declare.
The rage which should, from Romish flames have fumed,
Would quickly have them and their books consumed.
Oh then of whom should justice help require,
All these Consumed by flame of rutheles fire.
No age makes record, of so foul a sin,
Since god did first to frame this world begin.
Doomes day to England, now bin threatened has,
Ore which heavens God has shak^^^^^e his hand of wrath.
Oh may our deeds his mercy so Commend,
As still his grace, may Britons I Will defend.
But now behold, the fruits of Romish faith,
And know for truth, what Popish doctrine says.
Of binding, and of loosing, Popes have got,
A strength, which knittes of every evil the knot.
And makes damnation seem salvation sure,
If so thereby Rome may her gain procure,
What most she craves, is every course to take,
How best she may her self. worlds Monarch make.
The Pope that says himself, worlds God to be,
Speaks truth, for so's the devil as well as he.
But Pope from Peter does derive his race,
And says, to him belongs the keys of grace.
And he Christ's vicar, of all Gods church the head,
Must be supreme, all Kings his frown must dread.
With any oath, he can at large dispense,
And at his pleasure, pardon each offense.
Above Gods word, he does himself auow,
And his construction, must the world allow.
True Christians, they only his doctrine likes,
And all the rest are damned Heretics.
Against this, the Lion of the Tribe of Judah cries,
And tells the Pope, that like a devil he lies.
But still the Pope will keep heavens golden gate,
And does from thence, Kings excomunicate.
No King on earth, must have his name inrold.
Unless that first on him his Crown he hold.
And all the world, that on his sea not dwells,
Are Ethnicks, Pagans, faithless Insidels.
Those that not grow upon his stock entire,
Are branches wild, fit for destructions fire.
Such has he power, to any death to put,
And from life's tree, those saplesse twigs to cut.
Without the Church, as Jews and Turks they be,
That will not yield to his supremacy.
And Popish Romans, they are taught to know,
It lawful is to work their overthrow.
That will not yield obedience to the Pope,
In whose behalf is given so large a scope,
That Traitors do for heavenly merit hope,
Though thence the devil does pluck them in a Rope.
If for Romes sake, they kill their lawful King,
Bald iades for them, shall trotting trentalls sing.
And they, because so vilde a deed^^^^^ they did,
For Saints at Rome shall be canonized.
The Pope such power unto himself does take,
As he, a devil, a Saint, can quickly make.
Here briefly see, the power of Rome set down,
Above the world, himself, himself does crown,
Above Gods word, and sacred Laws divine,
The monsters proud, ambitious steps do clime.
And from his seat of blasphemy has flowne,
The fire that should have King and Realms up blown.
Villains that would the world in sunder riue,
Say for Religions sake, they did contriue
That damned plot; oh hellish insolence!
When devils will make Religion evils desence.
The actors in a work more then Tyrannical,
They did themselves, their countries purgers call.
In all they did, merely their countries love,
Did them unto the vildest actions move.
They would not leave her, but like Champions stand,
Till they from bondage, had freed their native land.
They but resolved to be most merciless,
To free the Catholics from their long distress*
From desperate times disease, evils strength to loose,
They were enforced a desperate salve to choose.
The worst of evil, was b^^^^^st in their esteem,
From worse then evil, their country to redeem.
The Pope might them, for faithful Christians take,
When what they did, was for religions sake.
Their plot found out, the very place to sack,
Where all the laws were made, that wrought their wrack.
And this conceit in them, a hope prefers,
They should be thought, Gods justice ministers.
These Realms with Rome, in union to unite,
Was all the cause, for which their hopes did fight.
For Romes avail, and for the Church her good,
King and Kingdoms, they would have drowned in blood*
For these good deeds, whatsoever did befall,
Saints at the least, the Pope would make them all.
Now see their work, and cause, for which th^^^^^y wrought
And judge how well, Rome has her children ^^^^^aught.
Their evil to do, they were so confident,
As to performe't, they took the Sacrament.
Christ's Royal body, substanciall flesh and blood,
They say, they eat and drank, and thereby stood;
Bound to perform the evil which they intended,
Oh then, how far should be their faith commended*
Here does my Muse want words, my thoughts to speak,
And does into a strange admirement break.
Oh God, how durst these me^^^^^ Sathanicall,
Imbru'de in blood, with hearts Tyrannical.
Made black with treason, against Gods anointed King,
Themselves before heavens Jesus Christ to bring.
And though from bread, they can him not (...),
Yet in the sign he is representative.
And bread not changed, yet holy scripture says,
By it we feed, on Jesus Chris^^^^^ by faith.
Not to dispute, but say as they accoumpt,
Into what height, do their presumption mount.
When as a wretch, before his God shall stand,
And think he holds his Maker in his hand.
And yet with soul all stained, as black as hell,
Even at that instant, does in damnation dwell.
And records God, and in him all the Trinity,
To be the witness of his hell-borne villainy.
And swears by them, with desperate hand to act,
The vildenesse, of the very vildest fact.
And thus resolved, his Savior up he eats,
So armed in proof, a King and State he threats.
Oh fearful thing, the seal of man's salvation,
Seals up to them, assured condemnation.
Yet they so blind, in faithless hopes do trust,
And think thereby, their vildest actions just.
Here see the strong delusion that should mock,
The race, cast from the number of Christ's flock*
Here see the cup of worlds abominations,
And know the whore, that breaths forth execrations
Against heavens throne, the Lamb, and all his Saints,
And yet she so, her damned vildenesse paints;
As that she seems of holiness the seat,
But God for her, has laid up judgments great.
She, and her pack, that had our fall compounded,
Shall be ere long, by Gods fierce wrath confounded.
And they that did for us one flame desire,
God has for them, prepared an endless fire.
NOw would my Muse desire to express,
In vildest evil, false traitors readiness.
Catesbie, so soon as he did Winter move,
Consent straight joined, the worst of evil to prove.
There needed no persuasion to be used,
Hels motion was at first, not once refusde.
What course so ere, hell could to him propound,
His lives adventure, he thereon would ground.
So all the rest, with selfsame swismesse ran,
To work an evil, the like nere wrought by man.
Their labor then, their care, and diligence;
Their watchful heed, their bounty, and expense,
Their desperate and resolved confidence:
Till death, to fight against heaven, in hels defense:
Approues what power, the devil does bear in those,
That serve his will, and to his Aul^^^^^ers goes.
In England now, what course the Pope does take,
His Champions proud, so fit for hell to make,
Let me set forth; that every one may spy,
The cunning work of Romes ar^^^^^h villainy.
For Romes avail, are built beyond the Seas,
(As Christian deeds) some stately Colleges.
And they are given in charity, to bring
Up those, that will Romes Masses learn to sing:
Children there taught, the rules of Popery,
Are learnd to know proud Romes supremacy.
Their teachers largely, do to them express,
How much th^^^^^y owe, to Romes Scald holiness.
And that their lives, lost in th^^^^^ Popes behoof,
Confirms the truth of their religions proof.
If for Romes good, to shameful death they come,
It crowns them with, a glo^^^^^ious martyrdom.
Who yeeldes not to Romes laws are only those,
Which they must know on earth to be Gods foes.
Their parents, if they shall Romes Pope displease,
It Is lawful for them, on their lives to seize.
To any Prince they are no subject held,
That dares deny, unto Romes sea to yield.
For Rome, If subjects their lawful sovereign kill,
Romes laws affirm, that they Gods laws fulfill.
Unto the Church a benefit to bring,
Each evil is made a sanctimonious thing.
When thus they are instructed, then I hope,
They may become, fit servants for the Pope.
Then taking oath in vildest evils to trade,
They are indeed substanciall villains made.
And thus those schools, the Popes best charity,
Are made the nurse of treasons treachery.
Thither often goes our Englands Papal youths,
To read the volumes of the Popes untruths.
To study there, do idle wits devise,
Where legions are, of vprearde mountain lies.
Logician like, who best can lies mayntaine,
Can best uphold Romes blood red scarlet train.
There in those schools, Rome does those scholars che^^^^^ish,
By whom he hopes to make gods kingdom perish.
From forth those lakes, as from a stigian gulf,
To England comes each hell-borne Roman woolfe.
Of our own people, do those schools beg^^^^^tt,
A viperous swarm, for vildest treasons fit.
Semina^^^^^yes, the children of perdition,
Thence bring to us Romes Popish superstition.
With him he brings authority to bear,
All shapes, and forms, and may each fashion wear.
Sometimes like clownes, sometimes like ruffins br^^^^^ue,
Sometimes like courtiers sometimes like lawyers gra^^^^^e,
Like Farmors, Citizens, or like a serving man,
Like glassemen, tinkers, or like foot posts, can
Those Rascals run, our kingdom round about,
And not be found when justice seeks them out.
They may be droncke, or swear, or of the Pope speak (...),
Forswear themselves, or lie, or what they will.
No evil in them, can join sins name unto it,
If for the Church, and Popes avail they do it.
The self same power that to deccaue has he,
He gives to them that once deccaued be.
With hells Commission, given a devil to preach,
So does the Pope his Saints and Children teach.
From Rome then let this truth be understood,
The Pope knows how, to make all mischiefs good.
These hell seed sowers, when they come to see
Such, as to whom, they may unmasked be.
With words dissolved in graceles zeal to tears,
He then to them, with humble speech declares.
He does no more then their salvation crave:
He comes, their souls from Hell, and Devil, to s^^^^^ue,
Alas says he, your preachers do you wrong,
Not of the Church, you not to heaven belong.
The^^^^^ with a cross, and body humbly bent,
My Lord the Pope his holiness has sent*
By me, from forth Saint Peter's blessed store,
Heavens heavenly kingdom, home unto your door.
Oh do you then, with joy your hearts address,
For to receive, heavens proffered happiness.
To heaven, mark well, for it is truth I say,
You cannot go, unless I teach the way.
And if you will no longer be beguiled,
To holy Rome you must be reconciled.
Thus they at first, do set destructions trap,
And throw themselves into devotions lapp.
They ^^^^^old their words, in seeming holy zeal,
And from the hearers, thus their hearts they steal.
And when as their persuasions thus have wrought,
As to Romes sea, by th^^^^^m some souls are brought.
Then to the Pope, once reconcilde and sworn,
From hence to Rome, their hallowed names are borne.
And afterward, its taught them by degrees,
To understand the strength of Romes decrees.
And so forth on, until they come to this,
To know like them, their prince no Christian is.
And some thing done, from sin their land to free,
As murdering him, should meritorious be.
And as they sinde a spirit fit to hear,
So will they use their doctrines to declare.
And give to them, wha^^^^^ thei^^^^^ denotion brings,
Beads, pictures, Saints, and pretty hallowed things.
Popes do maintain their Antichristian Scisme,
With relics, rags, and A pish Munckanisme.
The simple thus, by them dece^^^^^ued are,
The wise are caught, even by the self same snare.
Thus in the da^^^^^cke of hells eternal shade*
Amongst our selves, are English traitors made.
This is the seed that (...) sow,
And this the (...), that from their labors grove.
And that these evils unseen may safely flourish,
our Papists do them and thei^^^^^ actions nourishe.
But that which thre^^^^^ts great Brit^^^^^ns monarchy,
and best uphold Romes hateful dignity.
Is that among us, there rules secretly,
A sea, and state, of Popish presbetrie.
In England here Rome has an Archpriest placed,
The Pope has him as with a Council graced.
Some certain Papists only knows his walk.
And they alone, of Romes diseignes must talk^^^^^.
All Jesuits, of Romes Privy Council be,
For best they know the grounds of treachery.
At Rome for them, Princelike their Agents are,
Who does their causes to the Pope prefer.
Rome hither, they thither, usually,
As cause requires, do send in embassy.
Before our safety, can soundly be inioyed,
This Priest and Council needs must be destroyed.
For by their means the Pope does play the devil,
And plagues us here with every kind of (...).
All they desire, is our Co^^^^^fusions shame,
And o^^^^^er us, the Pope supreme to name.
Arch-Papist, does for this the best he ca^^^^^,
Church-papist, he becomes his journey man;
All work together, the Pope aloft to raise,
And still their working, works our dangero^^^^^s days.
Of some perhaps that thing is now cond^^^^^mned,
which done, would the^, much more have bin co^mende^^^^^
All did not know, by some the treason coynd,
Once done, God knows, how many would have (...)
To sound effect, could Rome her hopes compose,
Romes foreign friends, would soon bec^^^^^me our (...)
For he, on whom is laid their faiths foundation,
Can quickly give a gene^^^^^all dispensation.
What Rome not gets by force or policy,
By promise, vows, oaths, threats, or (...).
By charms, in chantments, witchcraft, sorcerie,
For that he fights ape^^^^^te, or secretly.
With murder, treason, blood, and treachery,
The Pope makes these his great artillarie.
Thus he vpholds his sea of blasphemy,
And when he does, to hostile actions fly,
Then that which most is shame to Majesty:
His kings must serve him in his villainy,
There Is not an evil, that hell determine shall,
But Popes will use, to seru^^^^^ their turns withal.
Their actions waied, then let the truth speak thus,
Pity to them, is cruelty to us.
Are these the fruits, that Romish Saints forth bring?
Is it for this, so often th^^^^^y masses sing?
Is this the zeal of their veligio^^^^^s heat?
So often for this, do they their prayers repeat?
Is it for this, their God in mind to bear?
That on their breasts, a Crueifixe they wear?
Is it for this, that whip themselves they use?
For this do they, their clothes to wear refuse?
Do they for this, to Saints and Angels pray.
Use shrift, and ponance, and fast so often must they?
Is this their love, alms, patience, and humility?
Is this their peace, and churches sweet tranquillity*
Are these the children, that Roman faith begets?
With help of Popes, Friars, Nuns and Jesuits?
Are they for this, with holy water bles^^^^^?
Do their perfection in these effects consist?
Now suit since they, such deeds as these prefer,
The Pope's a whore, her children bastards are.
All their deuotion^^^^^, brings such works about,
Oh God keep me from being so devout.
I hope the Papists, no excuse can make,
This treason was for their religion sake.
And all the treasons, in late Eliza^^^^^s reign,
Were done by those, that did Romes Sea (...)*
So many then, as are thereof ashamed,
Leave Rome, serve God, and be no further blamed.
But let obedience, to your Sovereign prove,
Your saithfull soundness, and repentant love.
And though ere long the cunning of Romes dr^^^^^ft,
Will coin some cause, themselves from shame to (...)
Yet those of you, that will not shameless be,
Come to our Church, and from Romes doctri^^^^^e flee.
And you that are the simplest sort of them,
That may be thought, plain honest meaning men*
Your ignorance, no sound devotion teaches,
Trust not the lies, that Popish doctrine preaches.
Some now I hope heavens grace to them imparted,
Will be from Rome, by Romes foul deeds converted*
Oh may that honor, whose heart sins action loathed,
Hence forth no more, be in Romes darkness clothed*
Mount Eagles like, love heavens all lightning sun,
And from the clouds of Popish darkness run.
So many years the truth has clearly shinde,
As none but those that will, can still be blind.
Who so his eyes, against the light will shut,
Must needs himself in mistie darkness put.
Be such Religion, of the world disdained,
As is with treason, blood, and murder stained.
Papists still blind, let not our I Will contain them,
Send them to R^^^^^me, for all but Rome disdaines them.
From of Romes shore, my Muse her self does wend,
And would her course unto Great Briton bend.
My native land, oh let to her my zeal,
The evidence of loves affection seal.
Who is it that sees the wrong unto us done,
But will from Rome and Romes adherents run.
God in thy love, preserve those Princely states,
Who all as one, Romes Sea, and doctrine hates,
And those among us, that of profession vant,
My little ruft, most peevish puritant.
Whose Brownisme, must our quiet state offend,
That witless strives for trifles to contend.
Whose in good sooth, indeed, and verily,
Nere knew the ground, of faiths sincerity.
Whose folly, in a wide maskt net does dance,
Whose zeal is but a painted ignorance.
Whose wildenesse runs the fields and woods unto,
Where preaching Cobblers, learnes them what to do.
Nise, curious wits, vain, idle, wise, like dawes,
Iumpe over blocks, and stumble most at strawes.
When now they see, how God his Church has loved,
Let them thereby, to join with us be moved.
And strive no more to prove their foolerie,
Against both learning and authority.
Such will alone, for Christ his flock be known,
And will allow no Church, besides their own.
Twixt them and those, thrown into like suspense,
There should be made, some greater difference.
Those that have borne the burden of the day,
And never ceast, to watch, to preach, to pray.
Whose love and zeal, has so heavens precepts taught,
As they to heaven, have greatest number brought.
To King and State, whose hearts are constant, sound,
Whose doctrine does on faiths salvation ground.
Let not the Church, give to it self a wound,
By loosing those that are most faithful found.
All those grave Preachers, wise and fit to teach,
For trifles, let them not refuse to preach.
But use their tallant, Gods number to increase,
Great is the sin, if now they hold their peace.
He does not evil, that to his power withstands it,
But who forbids not sin, and may, command it.
The threats of law, sway not affection so,
As those good deeds which righteous rulers do,
When no man may, tell kings they do amiss,
Then in obedience their corruption is.
But God has sent to us a virtuous King,
Let virtues love, true loves obeisance bring.
Oh let our love be to that grace not mist,
In which our selves, and all the world is blist.
The glory of that royal issues line,
Like to the sun, their famous deeds shall shine.
For Britons weal, let all good people try.
To crown her fame with perpetuity.
God so the ground of her foundation lay,
As that no strength may work her weals decay.
Her glories, trophies, let no such earthquake shake,
Whose force would her, the land of Ruin make.
But let the glory of her King and state,
Consume those foes that would her ruinate.
Traitors that would, in blood our land have drowned,
God them destroy, and all their plottes confound.
Those hearts that would, domestic wars procure.
Be they first made, of deaths destruction sure.
No home bred broiles, may they our peace disturb,
Such minds, oh let the strength of justice (...).
Me thinks there should be some thing understood,
When heaven is clothed in clouds of fire and blood.
Before and since the heavens did never cast,
More signs then were about this treason last.
Could heathen men judge future evils to hap,
When thunder did the Oaks in pieces rap.
And if the sun should but some sign bewraie,
Might no man dare against such prediction say.
And now shall heaven both fire and blood presage,
And we not think they chide this sinful age.
Eclipses strange both (...) Moon and Sun,
When strangely they, on heaps together come.
Shall reason so, and wisdoms strength be broken,
That by such signs, there shall be nothing spoken.
Shall God often shake, as in his furies wrath,
The solled roundle of this maslie earth.
And yet we still remain secure in sin,
Oh no, letts all for to repent begine.
The better that our safetyes strength may grow,
Let Joshua, Acan, and his wedge hence throw.
Our peace at home, be that established sure,
No force abroad, can Britons wrack procure.
In civil wars, when soldiers arms are worn,
Unjust, tryumphe, the just are force't to mourn.
No soldiers sword, could make Romes Empire stand,
When Rome, Rome self, brus'd with rebellions hand.
Let Britons, which do God and Christ pro^^^^^esse,
Their faiths true soundnes, by their deeds express.
So shall heavens God, our King and land defend,
And from his Loins a Royal issue send.
That on his throne, shall sit triumphantly,
Til Christ does come in glorious dignity.
This grace God grant, and thus shall cease my pen,
But still my heart, till death shall say Amen.
FINIS.
A Song of rejoicing for our late deliverance.
GReat Brittons I Will, worlds wonder, heavens delight,
Religions strength, faiths seat, professions stay:
Confirmd, mayntaynd, vpheld, in hels despite,
That (...) in thee salvation flourish may.
Thy King suruiues, and on Mount Sion stands,
Protected safe, from force of traitors hands.
Thy Queen, thy Prince, thy Peers, and Princely state,
Thy Lords, thy Bishopps, Knights, and Burgesses:
God has preserved from Romes intestine hate,
A sudden slame, should have consumed, all these.
Romes traitors n^^^^^w, so to the world are known,
As treasons Min^^^^^, has Rome, and them up blown.
Falsehood, ^^^^^ells child, in hell dark Paths does tread,
To hide it self, from truths disc^^^^^rning eye*
But traitors, God will to destruction lead,
They cannot live, from judgments stroke to fly.
Treason is like, the Baziliske his eyes,
First seeing, kills, first being seen, it dies.
In s^^^^^ight of Rom^^^^^s proud Antichristian force,
Celestial ioy^^^^^, with heavenly comfort (...)
Their souls in whom, once touched with sins remorce.
By ^^^^^aith in Christ, a gracious dew distills.
Rome is exilde, and this is Albions glory,
King James maintains, the scriptures sacred story,
When Gods true Church, does in her glory shine,
Why should some minds, their wisdom so preserre:
As if they were, then scripture more divine,
By self conceit, to seed contentions jar.
Sun, Moon, and Stars, those lights too little be,
To give them light, that will themselves not see.
A union, and a uniform, Conclude,
For trifles, let not time with truth contend:
No shadows can, substantial faith delude.
Indifferent things, should not the wise offend.
By joining all, in blessed unity,
With datelesse fame, Crown Brittons monarchy.
FINIS.
