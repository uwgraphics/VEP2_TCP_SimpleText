A Commendation of the adue^terus viage of the wurthy Captain. M. Thomas
Stutely Esquyer and others, toward the Land called Terra florida.
IF Fortunes force procure,
The valiant noble heart:
In trauail, pain and dangers great,
In wars to have his part.
If loss of goods ensue,
Through valiant enterprise:
Or for slaknes, or the foresight,
Of diligent advise.
Yet of his wurthy praise,
I can not speak tomiche:
Who ventreth both his goods and life,
His Country to enriche.
The worldly wise do muse,
And also do invay:
At noble hearts when that their welths,
Do fall unto decay.
As now of late I knew,
And saw the evidence:
Of one whose part it was to show,
The like experience.
A noble heart in deed,
And wurthy great renown:
Whose fortune was not to remain,
In City nor in Town.
A yung Eneas bold,
With heart and courage stout:
Whose enterprise was only pight,
Strange things to bring about.
And though that all men seemd,
His doings to deride:
Yet this his fact he would not leave,
Nor throw it so a side.
But still he does procure,
With boldned heart and mind:
That thing which erst he had assayd,
By trauail now to find.
Into a land unknown,
To win him wurthy fame:
As exequies and memory,
Of his most noble name.
Which if it fall his lot,
With fortunes helping hand:
He may well make a law hing stock,
Of them which him withstand.
Same term it Stolida,
And Sordida it name:
And to be plain they do it mock,
As at a foolish game.
If reasons sense be cause,
Of this forespoken talk:
Or feigned folly be the ground,
Why men's tungs thus do walk.
Then might it seem to me,
The Frenches labor lost:
Their careful pain and trauail eke,
That they therein have tossed.
The cronicles also,
Which only seem as true:
And writ by them that of that place,
Before did take the view.
The spaniards eke do show,
And verify the same:
To be described as a thing,
Deserving such a name.
The Portingales do say,
The crownacles be just:
And all that trauaild have that cost:
The same confess it must.
If that in times before,
Through talks men have refraind:
Which for the love of trauail sore,
Their hearts have long been paind.
Columbus as I re^d,
The space of many years:
Was counted as unwise also,
As in writers appeeres.
His ernest suit denied,
Yet in the final end:
His wurds and deeds did seem at length,
On reason to depend.
The like assay in hand,
He did at last procure:
Whose life and lucky viages,
Good fortune did assure.
At thend in sauety home,
At lenght he did retourn:
And quenched all their mocking hearts
Which erst did seem to burn.
For fire of force must needs,
Declare his burning heat:
Though for a time i^ smothering smoke
It seems it self to beat.
So talk of tungs may not,
By smothering through be tame:
But bursting out at length will turn,
Into a firye flame.
And then the malice gone,
The fire falls down:
And quenched quite as by this man,
Which was of great renown.
Now Stuetley hoice thy sail,
Thy wisshed land to find:
And never do regard vain talk,
For wurds they are but wind.
And in reproof of all.
I will not once refrain:
With prayer for to wish that thou,
May safely come again.
And that sum fruit at length,
By trauail thou may find:
With riches for to satisfy,
Thy manly modest mind.
Finis.
quod Robert Seall.
