A New Sect of Friars called Capichini.


These new freshecome Friars being sprung up of late,
do now within Andwarpe keep their abidinge:
Seducinge much people to their damned estate,
by their new false found doctrine the Gospel deridinge.
Saying and affirminge, which is no new false tidinge,
that all such as do the Popes doctrine despise:
As damned souls to hell must be ridinge.
For they do condemn them with their new found lie,
These be the children of the world counted wise:
whose wisdom is folly to God and his elect.
But let Satan work all that he can devise,
God it is alone which the Gospel does protect.
