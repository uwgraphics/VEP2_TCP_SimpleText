A compendious introduccion / prologe or preface un to the pistle off Paul to
the Romans.

By William Tindall.

To the Romans.
FOr as much as this pistle is the principal and most excellent part off the
new testament / and most pure evangelion / that is to say glad tydinges and
that we call gospel / and also a light and a way in un to the whole scripture
/ I think it mete / that every christen man not only know it by root and
with out the book / but also exercice him sylfe therein evermore continually /
as with the daily bredde of the soul. Noman verily can reed it to often or
study it to well for the moar it is studied the easier it is / the moare it is
cheued the pleasander it is / and the moare grundely it is sherched the
precioser things ar found in it / so great treasure of spiritual things
lies hyd therein.

I will theirfore bestow my labor and diligence / through this little
preface or prologe / to prepare a way i^ their un to / so ferforth as God
shall geve me grace / that it may be the better understand of every man / for
it has been hitherto evyll darkened with glooses and wonderful dreams off
sophisters / that noman cowde spy out the entente and meaning off it / which
nevertheless of it sylfe / is a bryghte light / and sufficient to geve light
un to all the scripture.

First we must mark diligently the manner off speaking of the Apostel / and
above all thing know what Paul means by these words / the Law / Sin /
Grace / Faith / Ryghtewesnes Flesh / Sprite / and soche like / or else read
thou it never so often / thou shall but loose thy labor. This word Law may
not be understand here after the commune manner / and to use Paul's term /
after the manner of men or after ma^s ways / that thou would say the law
here in this place were nothing butt learning which teaches what ought to be
done and what ought not to be done / as it goes with man's law / where the
law is fulfilled with outewarde works only / though the heart be never so
far off. But god judges after the ground of the heart / ye and the
thoughts and the secret movi^ges of the mind / therefore his law requires
the ground off the heart and love from the botome there of / and is not content
with the outeward work only / but rebukes those works most off all which
spring not of love from the ground and low botome of the heart / though they
appear outward never so honest and good / as Christ in the gospel rebukes
the Phareses above all wodyr thatt were open sinners / and calls them
Yprocites / that is to say Simulars / and painted Sepulchers / which Phareses
yet lyved no men so pure / as perteynyng to the outewarde deeds and works off
the law / ye and Paul in the third chapter of his Pistell un to the
Philippians confesses of him sylfe / thatt as twytchynge the law he was soche
a wone as noman cowde complain on / and not withstondynge was yet a murderar
of the Christen / persecuted them / and tormented them / so soore / that he
compelled them to blaspheme Christ / and was all to gedyr mercylesse / as many
which now feign outward good works are.

For this cause the cxv. psalm calls all me^ liars / because that noman
keeps the law from the ground off the heart / nether can keep it. For all
men ar naturally enclyned un to evyll / and hate the law / we find in our
silves unlust and tediousnes to do good / but lust and delectacio^ to do
evil. Now where no fre lust is to do good / there the botome of the heart
fulfylleth not the law / and there no doubt is also sin and wrath deserved
before god / though their be never so many out ward good works / or never so
glorious an outewarde show and appera^ce off honestely vynge.

For this cause concludes sencte Paul in the secunde Chapter that the jews
all ar sinners and transgressors of the law / though they make me^ beleve /
through ypocrisi off outward works / how that they fulfill the law / and
says that he only which does the law is ryghtewes before God / meaning
thereby that noman with outewarde works fulfylleth the law. Thou (says he to
the Jew) teach a man sulde not break wedelocke / and yet breakest
wedelocke thy sylfe. Wherein thou iudgest another man / therein condemnest thou
thy sylfe / for thou thy sylfe doestevyn the very same things which thou
iudgest. As though he would say / thou lyvest outewardly well in the works
off the law / and iudgest them that lyve not so / thou teach wother me^ /
and see a moote in a another man's eye / but art not ware of the beam that is
in thyn own eye. For though thou keep the law outewardly with works / for
fear of rebuke / shame / and punyshement / other for love off reward /
vantage / and vain glory / yet do thou all with out lust and love to the
law ward / and had levyr a great deal wodyr wise do / if thou
feareddest not the law / ye inwardly in thine heart / thou would thatt their
were no law / no nor yett God / the auctor and vangear of the law / yff it
were possible / so paynefull it is unto the to have thine apperytes refrayned
and to be kept down.

Wherefore then it is a plain conclusion / that thou from the ground and
botome of thine her te art an ennimye to the law. Whatt prevayleth it now /
that thou teach another man not to steal / when thou thine own sylfe art
a these in thine heart / and outwardly would feign steal yff thou durst?
though that the outward deeds abide not allwaye be hynde with socheypocrites
and dissimulars / but break forth among / evyn as an evyll stabbe or a pocke
can not all ways be keep in with violence off medicine. Thou teach another
man / but teach not thy sylfe / ye thou wotest not what thou teach / for
thou vndersto^dest not the law a right / how that it can not be fulfilled and
satisfied / but with in ward love and affeccio^ / so greatly it can not be
fulfilled with outeward deeds and works only. More ovyr the law increases
sin / as he says in the fyfte chapter / because that man is an enymy to the
law / for as much as it requires so many things clean contrary to his
nature / where off he is not able to fulfill one point or title / as the law
requires it. And therefore ar we moare provokede / and have greatter lust to
break it.

For which causes sake he says in the seve^th Chapter / that the law is
spiritual / as though he would say / yff the law were flesshely and but man's
doctrine / it might be fulfilled / satisfied / and stilled with outward deeds.
Butt now is the law gostely / and noman fulfylleth it / except that all that
he does spring off love from the botome of the heart. Soche a new heart and
lusty courage un to the law ward / can thou nevyr cumby of thine own
strenght and enforcemente / but by the operacion and workynge of the sprite.
For the sprite off God only makes a man spiritual and like unto the law / so
thatt now henceforth he does nothi^ge of fear or for lucre or vantages sake
or of vain glory / but of a fre heart and off inward lust. The law is
spiritual and wylbe both loved and fulfilled of a spiritual heart / and
therefore of necessite requires is the sprete that makes a man's heart fre /
and geveth him lust and courage un to the law ward. Where soche a sprite is
not there remains sin grudgynge / and hatered age^ft the law / which law
nevertheless is good / ryghtewes and holy.

Accoynte thy silfe therefore with the manner of speaking of the Apostell / and
let this now steke fast in thine heart / that yt is not both one / to do to
deeds and works of the law / and to fulfill the law. The work off the law
is / whatsoevyr a man does or can do off his own frewill / off his own
propyr strength / and enforsynge. Not with stondynge though there be nevyr so
great workynge / yet as long as their remains in the heart unlust /
tediousnes / grudgynge / gryffe / pain / lothsumnes and compulcion to the law
ward / so long ar all the works unprofitable / lost / ye and damnable in the
sight of God. This means Paul in the threde chapter / where he says / by
the deeds of the law shall no flesh be justified in the syghte off God. Here
by perceavest thou / that thoose sophisters ar but disceavers / which teach
that a man may and must prepare him sylfe to grace and to the favor of God /
with good works. How can they prepare themsylves un to the favor off God /
and to that which is good / which themsilves can do no good / no ca^ not once
thike a good thought or consent to do good / the devyll possessinge their
hertes / minds / and thoughts captyve at his pleasure? Can thoose works
please God / thynkest thou / which are done with gryfe / pain / and tediousnes
/ with an evyl will / with a contrary and grudgynge mind? O holy sancte
Prosperus / how myghtely / with the scripture of Paul confoundedest thou this
heresy / about (I trow) a twelve hundred years agoo or there upon.

To fulfill the law is / to do the works there of / and whatsumever the law
commands myth love / lust / and inward affeccion and delectacion / and to
lyve godly and well / freely / willingly / and with out compulcion of the law
/ eve^ as though there were no law at all. Soche lust and frelyberte to love
the law / comes only by the workynge off the sprite in the heart / as he
says in the fystte chapter.

Now is the sprite no nodyr wise geven / then by faith only in that we beleve
the promyses of God / with out waverynge / how that God is true / and will
fulfill all his good promises to usward for the blood of Christ's sake / as yt
is plain in the first chapter / I am not asshamed (says Paul) of Christ's
glad tidings / for it is the power of God / un to salvacion to as many as
beleve / for attonce and to gedder even as we beleve the gladtydinges preached
to us / the holy ghost enters in to our hertes and loses the bonds of the
Devil / which before possessed our hertes in captivite and held them / that
we could have no lust to the will of god in the law. And as the sprite comes
by faith only / even so says comes by hearing the word or glad tydinges of
God / when Christ is preached / how that he is Gods son and man also / deed
and risen again for our sakes / as he says in the thread / fourth / and
tenthe chapters. All our iustifyinge then comes of faith / and faith and the
sprite come of God and not of us.

Hereof comes it / that faith only iustifyeth / makes ryghtewes / and
fulfylleth the law / for it brings the sprete through Christ's deservyngs /
the sprite brings lust / loses the heart / makes him fre / sets him at
lyberte / and geveth him strength to work the deeds of the law with love /
even as the law requires / then at the last out off the same faith so
workynge in the herth / spring all good works by there own acorde. That
means he in the threde chapter / for after he has cast away the works off
the law / so that he sounds as though he would break and disanulle the law
through faith / he answers to that might be laid a genst / saying / we
destroy not the law through faith / but maynetene / further or stableshe the
law through faith / that is to say / we fulfill the law through faith.

Sin in the scripture is not called that outewarde work only committed by
the body / but all the whole busynes and whatsumever accompanies / moves or
stereth un to the out ward deed / and that whence the works spring / as
vnhelefe / prones and redynes un to the deed in the ground of the heart / with
all the powers / affeccions and appetytes where with we can but sin / so that
we say / that a man then synneth / when heys carried away hedelonge in to
sin / all togedyr as much as heys / of that poison inclinacion and corrupt
nature where in he was concevyd and borne. For there is no outward sin
committed / except a man be carried a way all togedyr / with life / soul /
heart / body / lust and mind there unto. The scripture looks singularly un
to the heart / and un to the rote and original fountain of all sin / which
is unbelief in the botome of the heart. For as faith only iustifyeth and
brings the sprite and lust un to the vttewarde good works. Even so unbelief
only damneth and keeps out the sprite / provokes the flesh / and stereth
up lust unto the evyll vtteward works as it fortuned to Adam and Eve in
paradise / Genesis iij.

For this cause Christ calls sin unbelief and that notably in the xvj.
chapter of Ihon / the sprete (says he) shall rebuke the world of sin because
they beleve not in me. Wherefore then before all good works as good fruits /
there must needs be faith in the herth whence they spring and before all bad
deeds / as bad fruits / there must neades be unbelief in the heart / as the rote
fountain / pyth / and strength off all sin / which unbelief is called the
heed of the serpent and of the old dragon / which the womans seed Christ must
tread underfoot / as it was promised un to Adam.

Grace and gift have this difference / Grace propyrly is Gods favor /
benivole^ce or kind mind / which of his own silfe / with out deservyng of us
/ he bears to us / where by he was moved and enclyned to geve Christ un to
us / with all his mother gifts of grace. Gift is the wholly ghost and his
workynge / whom he pours in to the hertes off them / on whom he has mercy
and whom he favereth. Though the gifts and the sprite encreace in us daily /
and have not yet there full perfeccion / ye and though there remain in us yet
evyll lusts and sin / which fight a ge^st the sprite / as he says here in
the vij. chapter / and in the fyfte to the Galathians / and as it was spoke
before Genesis iij. of the debate between the woman's seed / and the seed off
the serpent: yet nevertheless / Gods favor is so grette and so strong over
us for Christ's safe / that we are counted for full whole and perfect before
God. For Gods favor to us ward devydeth not hyrsilfe / encreasynge a little
and a little / as do the gifts / but receaveth us whole and altogedder in
full love for Christ's sake our intercessor and mediator / and because thatt
the gifts off the sprite and battle between the sprite and evyll lusts ar
begone in us all ready.

Off this now vnderstondest thou the vij. chapter where Paul accuses him
sylfe as a sinner and yet in the viij. says there is no damnacio^ to them
that are in Christ / and that be cause of the sprite / and because the gifts
of the sprite are begone in us. Sinners we are be cause the flesh is not
full killed and mortifyed. Nevertheless in as much as we beleve in Christ /
and have the erneste and beginning off the sprite / God is so lovynge and
favoureable unto us / that he will not look on soche sin / nether will count
it as sin / but will deal with us according / to our belefe in Christ /
and according to his promises which he has sworn to us / until the sin be
full slain and mortified by death.

Faith is not man's opinion and dream / as some imagion and feign when they
hear the story of the Gospel / butt when they se that there follow no good
works ner mendement off lyvynge / though they hear / ye and can babyll many
things of faith / then they faule from the right way and say / faith only
justifies not / aman must have good works also / if he will be rightewes and
safe. The cause is when they hear the Gospel or glade tydinges / they feign
of there own strength certain ymaginacio^s and thoughts in their hertes
saying: I have herd the Gospel / I remember the story / lo I beleve and that
they count right faith / which nevertheless as it is but man's ymaginacio^
and faynynge / even so profyteth it not nether follow there any good works or
mendement of livinge.

But right faith is a thing wroughte by the holy ghost i^ us / which
changes us / turns us in to a new nature / and begeateth us a new in God
/ and makes us the sons of God / as thou redest in the first off Ihon / and
kylleth the old Adam / and makes us all togedyr new in the heart / mind /
will / lust / and in all our affeccions and powers of the soul / and brings
the holy ghost with her. Faith is a lyvely thing / mighty in workinge /
valiaunte and strong / evyr doing / evyrfrutefull / so that it is impossible
/ that he which is endued there with / should not work all ways good works
with out ceasing hears not whether good works ar to be done or not / but
has done them allredy / yer mention be made off them / and is all way doing
/ for soche is his nature now / quick faith in his heart and lyvely movinge
of the sprite dryve him and stere him their unto. Whosoever does not good
works / is an vnbelevynge person and faythlesse / and looks round a boute
him gropynge aftir faith and good works / and woteth not what faith or good
works mean / though he babyll never so many things off faith and good works.

Faith is then a lyvely and a steadfast trustei the favor off God / where
with we commit oureselves all togedyr un to God / and that trust is so
surely grounded and steketh so fast in our hertes / that a man would not once
doubt of it / though he should dye a thousand times therefore And soche trust
wrought by the holy gooste through faith / makes a man glad / lusty /
cherefull / and true herted un to God / and un to all creatures. By the means
whereof / willyngly and with out compulcion he is glad and ready to do good to
everyman / to do servyce to everyman / to sofre all things / that God may be
loved and praised / which has geven him soche grace / so that it is impossible
to separat good works from faith / even as it is impossible to separat heete /
and burninge from fire. Therefore take heed to thy silfe / and beware of thine
own fantasies and ymaginacions / which to judge of faith and good works will
seem wise / when in dead they are sterke blind and of all things most
folyshe. Pray God that he will wit safe to work faith i^ thine heart / or
else shall thou remain ever more faythelesse / feign thou / ymagin thou /
enforce thou / wrastill with thy silfe / and do what thou will or can.

Rightewesnes is even soche faith / and is called Gods rightewesnes / or
rightewesnes that is off valor before God. For it is Gods gift / and it
alters a man and changes him in to a new spiritual nature / and makes him
fre and liberal to pay every man his duty. For through farth in a man purged
off his sins / and obteyneth lust un to the law off God / where by he
geveth God his honor and pays him that he owes him / and unto men he does
serves willingly where with soever he can / and pays every man his duty.
Soche rightewesnes can nature / frewill / and our own strength never bring
to pass / for as noman can geve him silfe faith / so can he not take away
unbelief / how the^ can he take away any sin at all? Wherefore is all false
/ ypocrisy and sin / whatsoever is done with outte faith or in unbeleve / as
it is evydent in the xiiij. un to the Romans / though hit appear never so
glorious or beautiful outwardes.

Flesh and spirit may thou not here vndstond / as though flesh were
only that which perteyneth un to vnchastyte / and the spirit that which
inwardly perteyneth to the heart / but Paul calls flesh here / as Christ
does Ihon. iij. all that is borne off flesh / that is to wete / the whole man
/ with life / soul / body / wit / will reason / and whatsoever he is both
with in and with out / because that these all / and all that is in man study
aftir the world and the flesh. Call flesh therefore whatsoever (as long
as we are with out the sprite of God) we think or spke of God / of faith / of
good works and off spiritual matters, Call flesh also all works which are
done with out grace and with out the workyng of the sprite / how soever good
/ holy / and spiritual they seem to be / as thou may prove by the v. chapter
un to the galathia^s / where Paul numbreth worshepynge of ydols / witchecrafte
/ envy and hate among the deeds of the flessh and by the viij. un to the
romans / where he says / that the law be the reason of the flesh is weak
/ which is not understand off vnchastite only / but of all sins / and most
specially / of unbelefe / which is a vice most spiritual / and ground off all
sins.

And as thou call him / which is not renewed with the sprite and borne
again in Christ flesh and all his deeds / even the very mocions of his heart
and mind / his learning doctrine and contemplacion off hie rhynges / his
preaching teaching and study in the scripture / byldynge of churches /
foundinge of abbeyes / gevynge of alms / mass / matence / and whatsoever he
does / though it seem spiritual and aftyr the laws of god. So contrary wise
call him spiritual which is renewed in Christ / and all his deades which
spring of faith / seem they nevyr so gross / as the washing of the disciples
fete done by christ and Peter's fysshynge aftyr the resurreccion / ye and all
the deeds of matrimony ar pure spiritual / if they proceed of faith / and
whatsoever is done within the laws of God / though it be wroughte by the body
/ as the very wypynge off shwes and soche like / howsoever gross they appear
outewarde. With out soche vnderstondyg of these words / can thou never
understand this pistyl off Paull / nether any wother place in the holy
scripture. Take heed therefore / for whosoever understands these words
wodwyse / the same vndstondeth not Paul / whatsoever he be. Now will we
prepare our sylves unto the pistell.

For as much as yt becomes the preacher of Christ's glade tydinges / first
through opining of the law / to rebuke all things / and to prove all things
sin / that proceed not off the sprite and off faith in Christ / and to prove
all men sinners and chylderen off wrath by enherytance / and how that to sin
is there nature / and that by nature they can no nodyr wise do than to sin /
and therewyth to abate the pride of man and to bring him un to the knowledge of
him sylfe / and of his myserie and wretchedness / that he might desire help.
Evyn so does sancte Paul and begins in the first chapter to rebuke un
belefe and gross sins which all men se / as the ydolatrie and as the gross
sins of the hethen were / and as the sins now ar of all them which lyve in
ignorance / with out faith / and with out the favor of God / and says. The
wrath of God of heven appears through the Gospel upon all men / for their
ungodly and unholy lyvynge. For though it be known and daily understand by the
creatures / that their is but one God / yet is nature of her sylfe / with out
the sprite and grace / so corrupt and so poisoned / that men nether can thank
him / nether worshepe him / nether geve him his due honor / but blind them
silves and faule with out ceasynge in to worse case / even until they come un
to worshepinge of images and workinge of shame full sins which are
abominable and agenst nature / and moreover sofre the same unrebuked in wother
/ havinge delectacion and pleasure therein.

In the secunde chapter he proceadeth farther / and rebukes all thoose wholly
people also which without lust and love to the law live well outwardly in
the face of the world / and co^dem wother gladly / as the nature off all
yprocrites is / to think them selves pure in respect of open sinners / and
yet hate the law inwardly and ar full of coveteousnes and envy and of all
uncleanness mathe, xxiij. These ar they which despice the goodness of God / and
according to the hardenes of their hertes / heepe togeder for them sylves the
wrath of God. Furthermore sancte Paul / as a true expounder of the law /
sofreth noman to be with out sin / but declares that all they are under
sin which of frewyll and off nature will live well / and sofreth them not to
be better then the open sinners / ye he calls them hard herted and soche as
can not repent.

In the threde chapter he myngleth both to geder / both the Jews and the
gentyles / and says that the one is as the other / both sinners / and no
difference between them / save in this only / that the Jews had the word off
God committed un to them. And though many of them beleved not thereon / yet is
gods truth and promise there by nether hustener minushed. Ande he takes in his
way and alegeth the saying of the.l. psalm that god might abide true in his
words and overcome when he is judged. After that he returns to his purpose
again / and proves by the scripture / that all men with out difference or
excepcion are sinners / ande that by the works off the law noman is justified
/ butt that the law was geven to vttur ande to declare sin only. Then he
begins and shows the right way un to ryghtewesnes / by what means men
must be made ryghtewes and safe / and says. They are all sinners and with out
praise before god / and must with out there own deservynge be made ryghtewes
through faith in Christ / which has deserved soche ryghtewesnes for us / and
is become unto us gods mercistole / for the remission of sinnens that are paste
/ thereby provinge / that Christ's rightewesnes / which comes on us through
faith / helps us only / which rightewesnes (says he) is now declared
through the gospel / and was testified of before by the law and the
prophets. Furthermore (says he) the law is help and furdered through faith
/ though that the works there of with all their boste ar brought to naught.

In the.iiij chapter (after that now by the iij. first chapters / the sins
are opened / and the way of faith un to ryghtewesnes laid) he begins to
answer un to certain obiectio^s and cavillacions. And first puts forth
those blind reasons / which commuly they that wylbe justified by their own
works ar wont to make / when they hear that faith only with out works
justifies / sayi^ge / shall me^ do no good works / ye and if faith only
justifies / what needs a man to study for to do good works? He puts
forth therefore Abraham for an ensample / saying / what ded Abraham with his
works? was all in vain? were his works to no profett? And so concludes that
Abraham with out and before all works was justified and made ryghtewes / In
so mooche that before the work of circumcision he was praised off the
scripture and called / ryghteous by his faith only / genesis. xv. So that he
ded not the work off circumcision for to be help there by un to ryghtewesnes
/ which yet God commanded him to do / and was a good work off obedience. So
in like wise no dowte no other works help any thing ar all un to ryghtwesnes
and un to a man's iustifiynge / but as Abraham's circuncision was an outeward
sign whereby he declared his ryghtewesnes which he had by faith / and his
obedience and redines un to the will of god / even so ar all wother good works
outeward signs and outeward fruits off faith and off the sprite / which
justify a man not / but that a man is justified allredy before God inwardly in
the heart / through faith and through the sprite purchesed by christ's blood.

Herewyth now stablissheth sancte Paul his doctrine off faith before rehearsed
in the thread chapter / and brings also testimony off David in the.xiij.
psalm / which calls ama^ blessed / not off works / but in that his sin is
not rekened and in that faith is imputed for ryghtwesnes / though he abide not
afterward with out good works / when he is once justified. For we are
justified and receve the sprite for to do good works / nether were it
wotherwyse possible to do good works / except we had first the sprite.

For how is it possible to do any thing well in the syghte off God / whyll we
are yet in captivike and bondage under the devyll / and the devyll possesses
is alltogeder and holds our hertes / so that we can not once consent un to
the will off God. No man therefore can prevent the sprite in doing good / the
sprite must first come and wake him out off his sleep with the thunder off the
law and fear him / and show him his miserable estate and wretchedness / and
make him abhor and hate him sylfe and to desire help / and then conforte him
agyne with the pleasant rain off the Gospel / that is to say / with the
sweet promyses of God in Christ / and stere up faith in him to beleve the
promises / the^ when he beleveth the promyses / as god was merciful to promise
/ soys he true to fulfill them and will geve him the sprite and streyngth both
to love the will of Gog and to work theraster. So se we that god only (which
acordynge to the scripture works all in all things) works a man's
iustifiynge salvacio^ and health / ye and pours faith to beleve / lust to
love gods will and strength to fulfill the same in to us / even as water is
poured ito a vesell and that of his good will and purpose and not of our
deservinges and merits / Gods mercy in promysyng and truth in fulfyllyng his
promyses save us and not we our selves / and theirfore is all laud praise and
glory to be geven un to God for his mercy and truth and not un to us for our
merits and deservinges. Aftyr that he stretches his ensample out agenst all
wother good works off the law / and concludes that the Jews can not be
Abraham's heirs because of blood and kynred only / and much less by the
works of the law / but must e^heret Abraham's faith / if they wylbe the right
heyrs of Abraham / for as much as Abraham before the law / both of Moses and
also of circumcision / was through faith made rightewes and called the father
of all them that beleve / and not of them that work. Moreover the law causes
wrath / in as much as no man can fulfill it with love and lust / and aslo^g as
soch grudgi^ge / hate / and i^dignacio^ age^ste the law remains i^ the heart
and is not taken away by the sprite that comes by faith / so long no doubt
the works of the law declare evydently that the wrath of God is upon us and
not his favor / wherefore does faith only receve the grace promised un to
Abraham. And these ensamples were not written for Abraha^s sake only (says he)
but for ours also / to whom / if we beleve / faith shall be rekened likewise for
rygthewesnes / as he says in the end of the chapter.

In the.v. chapter he commends the fruits and works of faith as ar peace /
reioysynge in the conscience / inward love to god and man moreover boldness /
trust / confidence / and a strong and a lusty mind and a steadfast hope in
tribulacio^ and soferynge. For all soche follow / where the right faith is /
for the abounda^te graces sake and gystes off the sprite / which God has geven
us in Christ / in that he sofred him to dye for us yet his enymyes. Now have
we the^ that faith only before all works iustyfieth / and that it follows not
yet therefore that a man should do no good works / but that the right shapen
works abide not behynd / but accompanye faith evyn as bryghtenes does the
sun / and ar called of. S. Paul the fruits of the sprite. Where the sprite
is / there is all way somere and there are all ways good fruits / that is to
say good works. This is Paul's ordyr / that good worhes spring off the sprite
/ the sprite comes by faith / and faith comes by hearing the word of God /
when the Gladtydynges and promyses which God has made unto us in Christ are
preached truly and receavyd in the ground off the heart with our waveryng or
dowrynge / after that the law has passed apo^ us and has damned our
consciences. Where the word of god is preached purely and received i^ the heart
/ thereys faith / the sprite of God / and there are also good works off
necessite / whenever occasion is gevyn. Where gods word is not purely
preached / but men's dreams / tradi^cions / ymaginasion / invencions /
ceremonies and supersticio^ there is no faith and consequently no sprite that
comes off God / and where Gods sprite is not / there can be no good wortes /
evyn as where an appeltre is not / there can grow no appell / but there is
unbelief / the devels sprite / and evil works. Off this gods sprite / and
his fruits / have our holy ypocrites not once known / nether yet tasted home
sweet they are / though they feign many good works off there own ymaginacio^
to be instified with all / in which is not one croine off true faith / or
spiritual love / or of inward joy peace and quietness of conscience / for as
much as they have not the word of God for the^ / that soche works please God /
but they are even the roten fruits of a roten tree.

After that he breaks forth / and runs at large / and shows whence both
sin and ryghtewesnes / death and life come. And he compares Adam and Chrisre
together / thus wise reasoninge and disputynge / that Christ must neades come
as a second Adam / to make us heirs of his rightewesnes / through a new
spiritual birth / with out our deservi^ges / Evyn as the first Ada^ made us
heirs of sin / through the bodily generation / with out our deservynge.
Whereby it is evidently known and proved to the vttemoste / that no man can
bring him silfe out of sin un to rightewesnes / no more the^ he could have
with sto^de that he was borne bodily And that is proved here with / for as
much as the very law of God / which of right should have help / if any
thing could have holp / not only came and browghte no help with her / but
also increased sin / because that the evyll and poisoned nature is offended
and utterly displesed with the law / and the more she is forbed by the law /
the more is she provoked and set a fire to fulfill and satisfy her lusts. By
the law then we se clearly that we must neades have Christ to justify us
with his grace and to help nature.

In the vi. he sets forth the chief and pricipall work of faith / the
batayl of the sprit agenst the flesh / how the sprite labors and
enforces to kill the remnaunte of sin and lust which / remain in the
flesh / after our iustifi^ge. And this chapter teaches us / thatt we are
not so fre from sin through faith / that we should henceforth goo up and
down idle / carlesse / and sure of our selves / as though there were now no
more sin in us. Yes there is sin remaining in us / but it is not rekened /
be cause of feyth and of the sprite / which fight agenste it. Wherefore we
have ynowe to do all our lyves long / to tame our bodies / and to compel
the members to obey the sprite / and not the appetites / that thereby we might
be life unto christ's deeth and resurrection / and might fulfill our baptim /
which signifies the mortifyinge of sins and the new life of grace. For this
battle cease not in us until the last breath / and until that sin be
utterly slain by the deeth of the body.

This thing (I mean to tame the body and so forth) we are able to do (says
he) seeing we are under grace and not under the law / which thing he him
srife erpoundeth. For to be with out the law / is not so to be understand /
that a man shall have no law and that every man may do what him lusts / but
to be under the law is / to deal with the works off the law / ande to work
with out the sprit and grace / for so long no dowte sin rayneth in us
through the law / that is to say / the law declares that we are under sin
/ and that sin has power and dominion over us / saying we ca^ not fulfill
the law / namely within in the heart / for as much as noman of nature
favereth the law / consents there unto / and delyteth therein / which same
is exceadynge great sin / that we can not consent to the law / which law
is nothing else save the will of god. And not to be under the law is / to
have a fre heart renewed with the sprite / so that thou haste lust inwardly of
thine own acorde to do that which the law commands / with our compulcion
/ ye though there were no law. For grace / that is to say / Gods favor
brings us the sprite / and makes us love the law / soys there now no moare
sin / nether is the law now any moare agenste us / but at one with us and
we with it.

This is the right fredome and liberte from sin and from the law / where of
he writes un to the end off this chapter / that yt is a fredome to do good
only with list / and to lyve well with out compulcion of the law. Wherefore
this fredome is a spiritual fredom / which destroys not the law but
ministers that which the law requires / and where with the law is fulfilled
/ that is to understand / lust and love / where with the laweys stylled / and
accuses us no moare compels us no moare / nether has ought to crave off
us any moare. Evyn as though thou were in debt to a another man / and were not
able to pay / two manner ways mighteste thou beloosed. One way / if he would
require nothing off the and break thine obligacion. An oath way / if some
wother good man would pay for the / and geve the as much as thou might
satisfy thine obligacion with all. Of this wise has Christ made us fre from
the law / therefore is this no wild flesshely liberte / that should do
naught / but that does all things / and is fre from the cravinge and debt
of the law.

In the.vii. he confirms the same with a similitude of the state of
marrimony. As when the husbond dies / the wife is at her liberte / and the one
loosed and departed from the wother / not that the woman should not have power
to marie unto a another man / but rather now first of all is she fre and has
power to marie unto a another man which she could not do before / till she was
loosed from her first husbo^d. Eve^ so are our co^sefe^ces bound and in
danger to the law under old Ada^ / as long as he lyveth in us / for the
law declares thatt our hertes are bound / and that we cannot disconsent
from him / but when he is mortified and filled by the sprite / then is the
conscience fre and at liberte / not so that the conscience shall now naught
do / but now first of all clevyth un to a another / that is to wette Christ /
and brings forth the fruits of life. So now to be under the laweys not to be
able to fulfill the law / but to be detter to it / and not able to pay that
which the law requires. And to be loose from the laweys / to fullfyll it /
and to pay that which the law demands / so that yt can now henceforth are
the naught.

Consequently Paul declares more largely the nature of sin and off the law
/ how that through the law sin reviveth / moves her silfe / and gadereth
strength. For the old man and corrupt nature / the moare he is forbedden and
kept under off the law / is the moare offended and displeased threwyth / for
as much as he cannot pay that which is required of the law. For sin is his
nature and of him sylfe he can not but sin. Therefore is the law deeth to
him / tormente and marterdome. Not that the law is evyll / but because that
the evyll nature can not so fre that which is good / can not abide that the
law should require of him any good thing. Like as a sick man can not so fre
that a man should desire of him to run / to leppe / and to do wother deeds
off an whole man.

For which cause sancte Paul concludes / that where the law is understand
and perceaved of the best wise / there it does no moare but utter sin / and
bring us unto the knowledge off our sylves / and there by kylle us and make us
bond un to eternal damnacion and detters of the everlastynge wrath of god /
even as he well fealeth and understands whose conscience is truly twitched of
the law. In soch danger were we yer the law came / but we knew not what
sin meante / nether yet knew we the wrath of God a pon sinners / till the
law had uttered it. So see thou that a man must have some wother thing / ye
and a gretter and a moare mighty thing the^ the law / to make him ryghtewes
and safe. They that understood not the law on this wise / are blind / and goo
to work presumptuously / supposing to satisfy the law with works. For they
know not that the law requires a fre / a myllynge / a lusty and a lovynge
heart. Therefore they se not moses ryghti the face / the wayle hangs between
/ and hydeth his face / so that they can not behold the glory of his
countenance / how that the law is spiritual / and requires the heart. I
may off mine own strength refrain thatt I do mine enymye no hurt / but to
love him with all mine heart / and to put a way wrath clean out of my mind
can I not of mine own strength. I may refuse money off mine own strength /
but to put a way love un to riches out of mine heart can I not do off mine
own strength. To abstain from advltery as concerning the vttewarde deed can
I do of mine own strength / but not to desire in mine heart is as impossible
un to me as is to chose whether I will hongyr or thrist / and yet so the law
requires. Wherefore of a man's own strength is the law never fullfilled / we
must have there un to Gods favor and his sprite / purchesed by Christ's
blood.

Nevertheless when I say a man may do many things vttewardly clean agenst
his heart / we must understand that a man is but dreven off dyvers appetites and
the greattest appetite overcommeth the less and caryeth the man away
violently with her.

As when I desire vengeance and fear also the i^co^venience that is like to
follow / if fear be greatter I absteyn / if the appetite that desires ve^ge
aunce be greter / I ca^ not but prosecute the deed as we se by experience in
many murtherars and theves / which though they be brought i^ to never so great
perel of deeth / yet after they have esscaped do even the same again. And
commune women prosecute there lusts because fear and shame are a way / when
wother which have the same appetites in their hertes abstain at the leest way
vttewardly or work secretly being overcome of fear and of shame / and so
likewise is it of all wother appetites.

Further moare he declares / how the sprite and the flesh fight together
in one man / and makes an ensample of him sylfe / that we might lern to know
that wercke a right / I mean to kill sin in our sylves. He calls both
the sprite and also the flesh a law / because that like as the nature of
gods law is to dryve / to compel / and to crave / evyn so the flesh
dryveth / compels / craveth and rages agenst the sprite / and will have her
lusts satisfied. On the wother side dryveth the sprite / cries and fyghteth
agenst the flesh / and will have his lust satisfied. And this strife dureth
in us / a long as we leve / in some moare and in some less / as the sprite or
te flesh is stonger / and the very man his own sylfe is both the sprite and
the flesh / which fygreth with his own sylfe / until sin be utterly slain
and he alltogedyr spiritual.

In the viij. chapter he comfort soch fyhters / that they dispere not
because of soch flesh / other think that they are less in favor with god.
And he shows how that the sin remayninge in us hurts not / for there is
no danger to the^ that are i^ christ which walk not after the flesh / but
fighte^ against it. and he expounds more largely what the nature of the
flesh and off the sprite is / and how the sprite comes by Christ / which
sprite makes us sprituall / tameth / subdueth / and mortifieth the flesh /
and certifyeth us that we are never the less the sons of god and also beloved
/ though that sinner age never so much in us / so long as we follow the
sprite / and fight agenste sin / to kill and mortify it. And be cause the
chastising of the flesh / the cross and soferinge are nothing pleasant / he
comfort us in our passions and affliccions / by the assistens of the sprite
which makes intercession to God for us mightily with groninges that pass ma^s
vtteraunce / man's speech can not comprehend them / and the creatures morn
also with us of great desire that they have / that we were loosed from sin
and corrupcion off the flesh. So se we that these three chapters / the vj. vij
viij. do no other thing so much as they do dryve us un to the right work
of faith / which is to kill the old man and mortify the flesh.

In the.ix. x. and.xj chapters he treats of Gods predestinacio^ / whence it
springs all to geder / whether we shall beleve or not beleve / be loosed from
sin or not be loosed. By which predestinacio^ our instifiynge and salvacio^
are clean taken out off our haildes / and put in the hands off god only /
which thing is most necessary of all. For we are so weke and so uncertain /
that yff it stood in us / there would of a truth no man be saved / the devell
no dowte would deceave us. But now is god sure / that his predestinacio^ can
not deceave him / nether can any man withstond or let him / and there fore
have we hope and trust agenste sin.

But here must a mark be set un to those vnquiett / busy and hye climyng
sprites how far they shall goo / which first of all bring hither there hye
reasons and pregnant wits / and begin first from an hye to sherdse the
botomlesse secrets of Gods predestinacio^ / whether they be predestinat or
not. These must neades other cast themsilves down hedelonge in to desperacion
or else co^mitt them selves to fre chance careless But follow thou the ordyr
of this pistill / and no sell thy silfe with christ / and learn to understood
what the law and the Gospel mean / and the office of both two / that thou
may in the one know thy silfe and how thatt thou have of the silfe no
strength but to sin / and in the other the grace of christ / and then se
thou fight agenst sin and the flesh / as the vij. first chapters teach
the. Aftyr that when thou art come to the viij. chapter / and art under the
cross and soferinge of tribulacion / the necessite of predestinacio^ will wax
sweet and thou shall well feel how preciouse a thing it is. For except thou
have borne the cross of adversite and temptacion / and have felt thy silfe
brought un to the very bryme of desperacion / ye and un to heel gates / thou
can never meadle with the sentance of predestinacion / with out thine own
harm / and with out secrett wrath and grudgying inwardly against God / for
other wise it shall not be possible for the to thike that God is rightewes and
just. Therefore must Adam be well mortified and the flesshely wit brought
utterly to naught / yer that thou may away with this thing / and drink so
strong wine. Take heed therefore un to thy silfe / that thou drink not wine /
wile thou art yet but a sucklinge. For every lerni^ge has her time mesasure
and age / and in Christ is there a certain childhod / in which a man must be
content with milk for a reason / until he war strong / and grow up / unto
a perfect man i^ christ / and be able to eat of moare strong meat.

In the xij. he gevyth exhortacions. For this manner observes Paul i^ all his
pistles / first he teaches Christ and the faith / the^ exhorts he to goog
works / and un to continual mortifying of the flesh. So here teaches he
good works i^ dead / and the true servynge of God / and makes all men
prestes / to offer up / not money and bestes / as the manner was i^ the ryme
of the law butt there own bodies with killinge and mortifying the lusts of
the flesh. Aftyr that he describes the outewarde conversacion off Christen
men / how they ought to behave them silves in spiritual things / how to
teach / preach and rule in the congregation off Christ / to serve one
another / to sofre all things pacienly and to commit wreke and vengeance to
God / in conclusion how a Christen man ought to behave him silfe unto all men
/ to friend / fooe or what soever he be. These are the right works of a
Christen man which spring out of faith. For faith keeps not holydaye /
nether sofreth any man to be idle / whersoever she dwells.

In the xij. he reaches to honor the wordely and te^perall sword. For
though that man's law and ordinance make not a man good before God / nether
justify him in the heart / yet are they ordained for the furderaunce off the
communewelth / to maynetene peace / to puneshe the evyll / and to defend the
good. Therefore ought the good to honor the temperall sword and to have it
in reveraunce / though as concerning themselves they neade it not / butt would
absteyne from evyll of there own acord / ye and do good with our man's law /
but by the law of the sprite which governs the heart and grdeth it un to all
that is the will of god. Finaly he comprehends and knetteth up all in love.
Love off her own nature bestows all thatt she has and even her own self
on thatt which is loved. Thou neadeste not to bid a kind mother to be lovynge
un to her only son / much less spiritual love / which has eyes geven her
off god / neadeth man's law to teach her to do her duty. And as in the
beginning he did putt forth Christ as the cause and auctor off our
rightewesnes and salvacion / even so here sets he him forth as an e^sample
to counterfayte / that as he has done to us / even so should we do one to
another.

In the xiiij. chapter he teaches to deal soberly with the consciences of the
weke in the faith / which yet understood not the liberte of christ perfectly
enough and to faver the^ of christian love / and not to use the liberte of the
faith unto hinderaunce / butt un to the furderaunce and edifiynge off the
weak. For where soche consyderacion is not / there follows debate and
despising of the gospel. It is better threfore to forbear the weak a while /
until they wax strong / then that the learning of the gospel should come
allogedre under foot. And soche work is a singular work of love / ye and
where love is perfect there must neades be soche a respect unto the weak / a
thing that Christ commanded and charged to be had above all things.

In the xv. he sets forth christ again to be counterfeted / that we also by
his ensample should sofre wother that are yet weak / as them that are frail /
open sinners / unlearned / vnexperte / and of lothesome manners / and not to
cast them away forthwith / but to sofre them till they wax better and exhort
them in the mean time. For so dealte Christ in the gospel and now deals
with us daily / soferynge our vnperfetnes / wekenes / conversacion and manners
not yet fassioned after the doctrine of the Gospel / butt smell of the flesh
/ ye and sometime breakeforth into the outeward deeds.

After that to conclude with all he wissheth the^ encreace of faith peace and
of joy of conscience / prayseth them and commits them to God and magnifieth
his office and administracion in the Gospel / and sobirly and with great
discrecion desires succur and aid of them for the poor sanctes at jerusalem
/ and it is all pure lore that he speaks or deals with all. So find we in
this pistell plenteously unto the vttenioste / whatsoever a Christen man or
woman ought to know / that is to wete / what the law / the Gospel / sin /
grace / faith rightewesnes / christ / God / good works / love / hope / and the
cross are / and even where in the pythe of all thatt pertayneth to the
Christen faith stondeth / and how a Christian man ought to behave him silfe
unto every man be he perfet or a sinner / good or bad / strong or weke / friend
or fooe / and in conclusion how to behave our selves both toward god and
toward oureselves also. And all things are profoundely grounded in the
scriptures and declared with ensamples of him silfe / of the fathers and off
the prophets / that a man can here desire no moare. Wherefore it apereth
evidently that paul's mind was to comprehend brevely in this pistle all the
whole learning of Christ's Gospel / and to prepare an introduccion un to all
the old testament. For with out doubt whosoever has this pistle perfectly
this heart / the same has the light and the effect of the old testamemte
with him. Wherefore let every man with out excepcion exercice him self
therein diligently and record yt night and day continually / until he be
full acoynted therewith.

The last chapter is a chapter of recommendacion / wherein he yet myngleth a
good monicion / that we should be ware of the tradicions and doctrine of men /
which begyle the simple with sophestry and lerninge that is not after the
gospel / and draw them from Christ / and noosell them in weke and feeble and
(as paull calls them in the pistle to the galathians) in bedgerly ceremonies
/ for the intent that they would lyve in fat pastures / and be in auctorite /
and be taken as Christ / ye and above christ / and sytt in the temple of God
/ that is to wit in the consciences off men / where god only / his word /
and his christ ought to sytte. Compare therefore all manner doctrine of men
un to the scripture / and se whether they agree or not. And commit thy self
whole and all togedre unto Christ / and so shall he with his holy sprite and
with all his fulness dwell in thy soul Amen.

Here follows a treates (to fill up the leefe with all) of the pater noster /
very necessary and profitable / wherein (yff thou mark) thou shall perceave
what prayer is and all that belongs to prayar. The sinner prays the
peticions off the pater noster / and God answers by the law / as though he
would putt him from his desire. The sinner knowlegeth that he is worthy to be
put back / nevertheless faith cleveth fast to gods promises / and compels
him / for his truethes sake / to hear her peticion. Mark this well and take
it for a sure conclusion / when god commands us i^ the law to do any
thing / he commands not therefore / that we are able to do yt / but to
bring us un to the knowledge of our selves / that we might se what we are and
in what miserable state we are in / and to know our lack / that thereby we
should torn to god and to knowledge our wretchedness un to him / and to desire
him that of his mercy he would make us that he bids us be / and to geve us
strength and power to do that which the law requires of us. Noote this also
/ that prayar is nothing else save a morninge of the sprite / a desire / and a
longyng for that which she lacks / as the sick morneth and soroweth in his
heart longing after health. And un to prayar is requered the law and also the
gospel / that is to say the promyses of God. The office off the law is only
to utter sin and to declare in what miserable damnacion and captivite we are
in. Is it not a miserable / yea fearful and an horrible damnacion and
captivite that we are in / when our very hertes are so fast bound and locked
under the power off the devil / that we can not once as much as consent un to
the will of allmyghty God / our father / creator / and maker? ye and yet se
not this so great / so sharp / so cruel / and terrible vengeance of God upon
us / until the law come. The law then brings a man un to the knowledge of
him self / and compels him to morn / to complain / to sorrow / to
confess and knowledge his sin and misery / and to seek help. The gospel
entyseth draws and shows from whence to fetch help / and coupleth us to
God through faith. Faith is the ancre of all health and keeps us fast un to
the promyses of God which are the sure haven or port of all quietness of the
conscience. Nothing / nether the law nether works nether yet any other thing
ca^ quiette a man's conscience save only faith and trust in the promyses of God.
Faith sofreth no wind no storm no tempest of adversite or temptacio^ / no
threatenynges of the law / no crasty sotylte off the devyll to seperatt us
from the love of God in Christ Jesus / that is to say / to make us beleve that
god loves us not in Christ and for Christ's sake. Prayar is the effect and
work off faith / and the sprite through faith prays continually with
mornings passing all utterance of speech / confessinge and knowleginge her
grevous bondage / her lack and wekenes / and desyringe help and succre. Now
seiste thou that their is not so great distaunce between heven and earth / as
between prayar and momblynge a pair of matenses or nu^bryng pater nosters and
honourynge God with the lyppes / I pass over with silence / how with out all
fruit / ye with how tereble ignorance the lay and unlearned people say the
pater noster and also the creed in the latyne tongue. Moreover they never pray
which feel not the workynge of the law in their hertes / and have their
consciences shaken and broysed and as it were beaten to powder with the
thunderbolte their of. Consider and behold thy sylfe their fore in the law
diligently as in a glass / and then come and confess thy sin / thy lack and
poverte unto god with out all manner faynynge and ypocrisy / morninge and
complaining over thine horrible damnacion / bondage and captivite and with a
strong faith pray god to have mercy on the for Christ's sake / to fulfill his
promyses / to geve the his sprite / to loose the / to strength the / to
fullfyll all his Godely will in the / to pour the riches and treasure off his
spiritual gystes in to the / and to make the soche a wone as his heart has
pleasure and delectacion in. And above all things desire him to increase thy
faith / and pray after the manner and ensample of this treates here following.

The Sinner O our father which art in heve^ / what a great space is between
the and us? How therefore shall we thy children here on earth / baneshed and
exiled from the in this vale of misery and wretchedness / come home to the into
our natural country?


God The child honors his his father / and the servau^t his master. If I be
your father where is mine honor. If I be your lord where is my fear.
Malachias. j. For my name through you and by your means is blasphemen rayld
upon and evyll spoken of Esaias, lij.


The Sinner. Alas O father that is truth / we knowledge our sin and
treaspace / nevertheless yet be thou a merciful father / and deal not with
us acordi^g to our deservynges / nether judge us by the rigorousnes off thy
law / but geve us grace that we may so lyve / that thy holy name may be
hallowed and sanctified in us. And keep our hertes / that we nether do
nerspeake / no / that we not once think or purpose any thing / but that which
is to thine honor and praise / and above all things make thy name and
honor to be sought of us and not our own name and vain glory. And off thy
mighty power bring to pass in us / that we may love and fear the as a son
his father.


God Sow can mine honor and name be hallowed among you / when your hertes
and thoughts are all ways inclined to evyll / and ye in bondage and captivite
under sin / moare over saying that noman can sing my laud and praise in a
strange countrepsal. cxxxvj.


The Sinner. O father that is truth / we feel our me^bres ye and also the
very hertes of us prone and ready to sine and that the world / the flesh /
and the devyll rule in us / and expel the due honor of thine holy name.
Wherefore we beseech the most mercy full father / for the love that thou have
unto thy son christ / help us out of this miserable bondage / and latt thy
kingdom come / to dryve out the sin / to loose the bonds off satan / to
tame the flesh / to make us ryghteous and parfecte / and to cleve unto the /
that thou only may reign in us / and that we may be thy kingdom and
possession / and the obey with all our power and strength / both with in and
with out.


God Whom I help them I destroy. And whom I make lyvinge / safe / rich and
good / them I kill co^de^ne and cast the^ away / make them bedgers and bring
them to naught. But so to be cured off meye will not sofre psalm.lxxvij. How
then shall I heal you / ye and what can I do moare? Iesaias. v.


The Sinner. That is to us great sorrow and greffe / that we can nether
understand nor sofre thy wholesome hand / Wherefore help dear father / open
our eyes / and work patience in us / that we may understand thy wholesome
hand / and also patiently sofre thy Godly will to be fulfilled in us.
Furthermore though thy most wholesome cure be never so paynfull unto us / yet
goo forewarde therewyth / punesh / beat / cut / burn / destroy / bring to
naught / damn / cast down un to hell / and do whatsoever thou will / that
thy will only may be fulfilled and not ours. Forbydde dear father and in no
wise sofre us to follow our own good thoughts and ymaginacions / nether to
prosecute our own will / meaning and purpose. For thy will and ours are
clean contrary one to the other / thine only good / though it other wise appear
unto our blind reason / and ours evyll / though our bli^dnes se it not.


God I am well served and dalte with all / that me^ love me with their lyppes
and their hertes are far from me / and when I take them in hand to make them
better and to amend them / then run they backward / and in the mids of
there curing / while their health is a workinge / they wythdrawe them selves
from me / as thou readeste psalm.lxxvij. conversi sunt in die belli. they are
turned back in the day of battle / that is to say / they which began well
and committed them selves un to me / that I should take the^ i^ hand and cure
the^ ar go^ne back from me i^ time of te^ptacion and kylli^g of the flesh /
and ar returned to sin and un to dishonouri^g of me again.


The sinner O father it is true / no man can be strong in his own strength /
in the second chapter of the first off the kings. Ye and who is able to sofre
and abide before thine hand / yff thou the silfe strength and comfort us
not. Wherefore most merciful father thake us un to thy cure / fulfill thy
will in us / that we may be thy kingdom and enheritaunce / un to thy land and
praysyng. Also dear father strength and comfort us in soche business with thy
holy word / geve us our daily breed / grave and printe thy dear son Jesus
in our hertes / that we strengthed through him may cherefully and gladly
sofre and endure the destroyinge and killynge of our will / and the
fulfyllinge off thy will. Ye and sheed out thy grace upon all christente and
send learned prestes and preachers / to reach us thy son Jesus purely / and
to feade us with the word off thy holy Gospel / and not with the dreegges and
chafe of fabelles and men's doctrine.


God Hit is not good to cast pearls before swyne / nether to geve holy
things and the childrens breed unto the dogs and bounds. Ye sin
continually with out ceasynge / and though I let my word be preached a monge
you never so much / yet ye follow not / nether obey / but despice it.


The sinner O father have mercy on us / and deny us not that breed of love /
it greveth us sore / even at the very heart rotes of us / that we can not
satisfye thy word and follow it / we desire the therefore to have patience with
us thy pour and wretched cheldren / and to forgeve us our treaspace and gylt
/ and judge us not after thy law / for noma^ is rightewes in thy presence.
Look on thy promyses / we forgeve our treaspasers and that with all our
hertes / and un to soche haste thou promised forgevenes / not that we through
soch forgevenes are worthy of thy forgevenes / but that at thou art true / and
of thy grace and mercy haste promised forgevens unto all them that forgeve
their neghbours / in this thy promise therefore is all our hope and trust.


God I forgeve you often and loose you often / and ye never abide steadfast.
Children of little faith are ye. Ye can not watch and endure with me a lityll
while / but attonce faulle again in to temptacion / Matthew xxvj.


The sinner Weak ar we o father and feeble / and the temptacion great and many
fold / in the flesh and in the world. Keep us father with thy mighty power /
and let us not faule in to temptacion and sin again / butt geve us grace
thatt we may abide stondynge / and fight manfully unto the end / for with
out thy grace we can do nothing.


God I am ryghteous and right is my judgment and therefore sin may not be
vnpunesshed / ye and ye must sofre evyll and affliccion / and as wytchinge
that ye have temptacion theirby / that is your sins fault only / which
compels me their un to / to kill it and to heal you / For sin can with no
another medicine be drawn out of you / but through adversite and soferynge off
evyll.


The sinner For as much then as adversite tribulacion affliccion and evyll
which fight against sin geve us temptacion / delyver us out of them /
finishe thy cure and make us through whole / that we loosed from sin and
evyll may be un to the a kingdom / to land / to praise and to sanctify the /
amen. And saying thou haste taught us thus to pray / and have promised also
to hear us / we hope and are sure that thou will graciously and mercifully
grant us our peticions / for thy veritees sake / and to the honoring off
thy truth / Amen.

Finally some man will say happly / what and yff I can not beleve that my
prayer is heard. I answer. Then do as the father of the possessed did in
the.ix. of mark / when Christ said unto him / yff thou couldeste beleve / all
things are possible unto him that beleveth. The father answered I beleve lord
/ help mine unbelief / that is to say / heal mine unbelief and geve me
perfect belefe and strength the weakness off my faith and increase it.
