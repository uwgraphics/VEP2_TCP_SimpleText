The Kings speech in Parliament the 7. day of June. 1628.
THe answer I have already given you, was made with good deliberation, and
approved by the judgment of many Wisemen, that I could not have imagined,
but that it should have given you full satisfaction: But to avoid all ambiguous
interpretations, and to show you, that there is no doubleness in My meaning, I
am willing to please You in words, as well, as in substance, read Your
Petition, and You shall have an answer, that I am sure will please you.

The Petition being read, the King confirmed it with these words following.
SOIT DROIRT FACT COME ILZ DESIRONT.

Let right be done as they desire. This I am sure is full, yet no more then I
granted in My answer, for the meaning of that, was to confirm all your
Liberties, knowing, (according to your own protestations,) that you neither
mean, nor can hurt my Prerogative: And I assure you, my Maxim is; that the
Peoples liberty strengthens the Kings Prerogative; and that the Kings
Prerogative, is to defend the Peoples liberty.

You see how ready I have showed my self, to satisfy your demands; so that I
have done my part, wherefore, if this Parliament have not a happy conclusion,
the sin is yours, I am free from it.

God save the King.
