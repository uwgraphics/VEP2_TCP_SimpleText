SIR WALTER RAVVLEIGHS GHOST, OR Englands Forewarner.

Discovering a secret Consultation, newly holden in the Court of Spain.

Together, with his tormenting of Count de Gondomar; and his strange
affrightment, Confession and public recantation: laying open many treacheries
intended for the subversion of England.

PSALM. 14. VER. 7. Destruction and vnhapinesse is in their weyes: and the way
of peace have they not known, there is no fear of God before their eyes.

VTRICHT, Printed by John Schellem. 1626.

SIR WALTER RAWLEIGHS GHOST.
ALthough the liberty of these times (wherein your Currants, Gazettas,
Pasquils, and the like, swarm too too abundantly) has made all News (how
serious or substantial soever) liable to the jealous imputation of falsehood,
yet this relation I assure you (although in some circumstances it may lean too
near the flourish of invention, yet for the pith or marrowe thereof, it is as
justly allied and knit to truth, as the light is to the day, or night to
darkness.

To hold thee then (Gentle Reader) in no further suspense, be pleased to
understand, that some few days after the solemnity of the Purification of
the blessed Virgin (according to the Roman and Spanish computation) It pleased
the Majesty of Spain, Philip the fourth, to retire himself to his delicate
house of pleasure, called Casa del Campo, situated near unto the town of
Madrid or Madrill, where his standing Court for the most part continually
remains: And the nearest in attendance unto him (next to the Cound de
Oliuares) was the Cound de Gondomar, the Archenemie to the flourishing Estate of
our England, and the Fox whose stench has not cured the Palsy, but rather
impoisoned and brought into an Apoplexy many Noble and some times well
deserving English hearts. Neither was the King for his pleasure retired to this
house of Pleasure, but rather through the necessity of some special affairs,
the greatest whereof seemed to be gathered from the last attempt of the English
upon the Fort and Castle of Punetall and the town of Cadiz or Cales, wherein
though the loss was not so great or material as might either make the
Assailant or Assailed offer Roses, or Nettles upon the Altar of Fortune; yet
the affront seemed to strike a more deep impression in the hearts of the
Spaniards, then could be well taken away with scorn (which is the ensign of
their pride) or with the hope of future advantage (which only gives life unto
their Envy and Malice.

And therefore now at this time and in this place, after many consultations held
with the Earl of Gondomar, whom the whole world Baptized the Butteslaue or
Incendiarie of Christendom, the Intelligencer, Ambassador and Jesuitical
Archbishop Leadger (as his practices in our Nation has well witnessed)
touching some notable revenge to be had against the State of Great Britain,
being the only Jewel on which Spain had long since fixed her heart, to make
her universal Monarchy every way full and perfect, he is by command from the
King (in the person of the Cound Oliuares) to make his appeara^ce before the
Popes Nuntio, the Duke of Lerma, the Duke of Cea, the Duke of Infantasgo and
the Constable of Castila, who had a special Commission signed for that
purpose, and to deliver unto them all those secret advantages, which he had
either by the experience of time, the continual labor of his brain, the
corruption of his bribes, the threatenings and insinuatio^s of his Popish
Priests, the petulent flatteries of his Papisticall English Mistrisses dyuing
into their husbands Counsels, or by any other direct or indirect means, won
unto him self a knowledge or instruction for the alteration or subuerssion of
that brave and flourishing British Monarchy. And in this charge the C. de
Oliuares according to the state and magnificence of the Spanish reseruatio^s,
began to make a great flourish of many demure and austere circumstances unto the
E. of Gondomar, concerning the greatness of his ingageme^t, the high Trust
reposed in his singular knowledge, and the infinite expectations the King and
the whole State had fixed upon the wisdom of his proceeding; adding thereunto
sundry admonishments or Caueats to call into his remembrance, touching many
alterations in the State of Great Britain, some defenciue, some offenciue
since his last abode or comercement in the same; And amongst the rest as a
thing of most especial note, the Cound began to repeat many relations which
Gondomar himself had delivered unto him touching the general, warlikenesse of
the British Nation, affirming that he had heard him say, that he had seen the
very children and boys in the street, make their sport and play a school of
war, and by imitation from elder knowledges to express in child play, the
very excellency and perfection of Martial discipline, which had summoned in
him both matter of passion and admiration, that he had often cried out, What
will the English do, every child will be an Hercules and kill a Serpent in
his cradle: This, Oliuares told him was but a small shadow or little prick to
express a much greater substance now in use: for since the death of King
James, of everliving and famous memory, the Englishmen, who for the space of
twenty two years before, had but as it were dallyed and played with Arms,
rather seeking to affect it for nouelty then necessity, were now in one years
deliberate and material exercise, become so singular and exquisite, that the
Netherlands blushed to see themselves ouergone in a moment, and that to be made
familiar in an instant at which they had labored to obtain to in diverse ages.

Besides Oliuares assured him that he had received infallible intelligence out
of the Archduches Countries, that a hundred and odd of the best experie^ced
soldiers or firemen (being all English) were sent from the States of the
United provinces, into Great Britain, to educate and instruct in Martial
discipline every several Country and Province, in so much that the whole Island
was nothing now but a Nurcery of excellent and exquisite Soldiers.

To this Gondomar replied that he had from certain Jesuits in England,
received the like intelligence, and with this addition, that those excellent
elected men in the Low Countries found their equal Schoole-followes, nay many
Tutors and experienced Masters when they came into England, so that indeed
their necessity did but convert to superfluity and a little loss, to some
that were of much better deserving.

Yet said Gondomar further, for mine own part though this make much for our
terror and amazement; and that we must with Curtius leap wilfully into a
Gulphe of certain ruin ere we can hope of revenge or triumph, yet does this
new Military course little move my blood; for though I must confess the
Nether-lands to be the only unparalleled School of war in the whole world,
yet the only thing it teaches is Form and Fire, Intrenchment and
Besiegement; but for the use of the Sword, push of the Pike, bringing of
Grosses body to body and hand to hand, the exercise of every private
strength, and the fortune of Battles; Things which the English must of
necessity be exposed unto, Hoc raro aut nunquam; And therefore (my Lord) I
tell you, I more quake when I see an old Irish Commander drilling an English
Company, who never beheld an enemy but he felt his Sword and knew his Target,
then when I see infinits of golden fellows, teaching men only dance to the
tune of Posture, or framing Chimeras in their brains, whether the Pike and the
Bow, or the Pike and Dragoone, or Pike and long Pistol be of greater
importance: But of these things we shall have a larger time to discourse and
think upon, it suffices me that I know my Royal Masters pleasure and your
honorable instructions; all which I will study, to satisfy only diverse
things are (through other employment, laid as it were aside from my memory, not
utterly forgotten, therefore I beseech I may have the respite of some few
hours to reckon with my former knowledge, `and so yield up the whole sum of
my duty and service.

To this Oliuares seemed exceeding willing, and so the Earl to make choice of
his best time, they departed one from the other, Oliuares returning to satisfy
the King, and Gondomar taking his Litter, went back to Madrill, where what
contention grew betwixt him and his old acquainted mischieues, how every minute
he produced new and unnatural Cocks-egges, brooded them from the heat of his
malice, hatche them with the deuilishnes of his Policy, and brought forth
Serpents able to poison all Europe, is a Discourse monstrous and almost
inexpressable; I will therefore omit this mutiny of his troubled thoughts and
only pitch upon this one accident, no less strange then memorable; wherein as
in a Mirror every eye may behold the weakness of a guilty thought, and how
easily frailty is surprised and overcome, when it encounters with these two
maine enemies of our blood, Fear and Amazement.

It so fell out, that the Morning before the Noone on which Gondomar was to
appear before the designed Commissioners, partly to refresh his perturbed
spirits with the pure Air, and to recollect unto himself all those thoughts
and circumstances which might make a glorious passage for the huge and
monstrous body of mischief where withal he was that day in labor; he caused
his attendants to bring him in his Litter to the Prada, near unto the City
of Madrill, being a place of recreation and pleasure for the Nobility and
Gallantrie of Spain, not much unlike to our new More field walks, near to
the City of London, only that this is more private and reserved; for as ours
is common to all men of all sorts, so is this Prada only but for the King, the
Grandies of Spain, the Nobility and some Gentlemen of the uppermost or best
quality.

After Gondomar had in this place of recreation taken a turn or two in his
Litter, whether he found his ruminations disturbed with the uneasy pace of
his Mules, or that he had not elbow room enough in his Litter, to give action
and grace to many of those damnable thoughts which in that hour gave him
singular contentment, for the Spaniard is not of our dull English quality, to
let his words pass from him as neglected strangers or thoughts out of the
compass of his dearest familiarity, but rather as dear children or choicest
friends, to lend them admiration with his eyes and hands, to adorn them with
expectation in the shrugge of his shoulders, and with a thousand other minicke
gestures, to make a speech that is as triuiall and unseasoned as folly it
self, to appear as serious as if it were a Delphan Oracle: upon some one or
other of these Spanish disgusts, this Fox (our Earl) vnkennels himself and
makes his servants take him from his Litter, then placing his chair (the true
sworn brother, or at least the nearest kinsman that might be to a
closse-stoole) under the shadow of certain trees, in a walk more reserved
then the rest, he commanded his attendants to withdraw themselves; and he had
reason so to do for two principal respects: the first, least his anticke
postures, mumps, moes and Munkey-like wrye faces might draw laughter or scorn
from his vassals, or lastly least the violence of his study and meditations
might make some words fall from him, which he thought too precious for another
man's bosom.

Being obeyed in all his commandments, and seated thus alone by himself,
only guarded by his two choice friends Malice and Mischief, he had not called
up many evil thoughts to appear before him, when on a sudden (according to
the weakness of his apprehension) there shined round about him a most
glorious and extraordinary light; which might be taken rather for fire or
flaming, then shine or glittering: and this appeared so suddenly, spread it
self so largely and increased so violently, that terror, fear and amazement
at one instant raised upon the heart of the Earl, and with their cold
qualities did so stupifie, dull and contracte all his spirits, that as if he
had seen Medusas head, the poor Don was become altogether a piece of ice or
marble; he had no spirit to remember there were spirits, his crossings and
blessings, his holy water and his Agnus Dei, his Monks charms, and his
Jesuits coniurations were all now turned to quaking and trembling, to staring
and stark madness, to gaping and groaning, to want of words through strife for
words, and indeed to what not that might show the singularnesse of a perplexed
astonishment? his nightcap throws his hat in the dust, and his hair makes
his cap fly into the air like a feather; he does reverence but sees no Saint,
would feign utter either salutatio^s or curses, but knows not by what name to
call his controller: In the end starting and standing upright, seeming to see
what he would not see, or to find out that with curiosity, which he had
rather loose with the best care of his spirits; stradling like a Colosses, as
if he neither respected present perils, nor feared those which were further
off, he looked as if he would look through the pure air, and though it have
truly no color, yet was his search so diligent that he appeared to find out
a constant complexion; yet all was but his new fear, which neither the manner
of his life (which had ever been desperate, subtle, and reserved) the
condition of the times (at that time and in that place free from perplexities
and incumberance) the state of his affairs (rather rising then declining) nor
his present negotiations strong enough to have encountered with any Goliahs
amazement, was able now to keep constant any one joint about him: I have read
that the Duke of Burgundy had like to have dyed at the sight of the nine
Worthies, which a Magician had discovered but: our Don Gondomar is like now to
dye at the sight of nothing but air and his own imagination; for he had every
symptom of death about him, as a body trembling, a stomach swelling, forehead
turned yellow, eyes dead or sinking, a mouth gaping, and what not that could say
our Don is now upon the pitch of departing. They say that great Princes should
never see the portraiture of fear but upon their enemies backs; sure I am
Gondomar now saw both fear and cowardice upon his own heart. But why should
I drive you off with more circumstance? the nakedness of the truth is, that as
he gazed thus fearfully about, there appeared or seemed to appear before him
the Ghost of Sir Walter Rawleigh Knight, a Noble famous Englishman and a
renowned Soldier: at this apparition the Earl fell down flat to the earth
upon his face (for backward he durst not, least he might give an offense to
his Surgion) and yet the posture in which this Noble Gentleman appeared, how
ever fearful to the guilte of Gondomars conscience, yet it was amiable and
lovely to any pure and honest composition, for he was armed at all pieces, and
those pieces of silver, which is the ensign of innocence and harmlesnesse: In
his right hand he brandished his sword, which was an instrument that had been
ever fatal to Spanish practices, and had not the edge been taken off by this
Foxes subtilities, I persuade my self (by this time) it had near made a new
conquest of the West Indies; in his left hand be seemed to carry a cup of gold
filled with blood, which blood he sprinkled, some upon Gondomar and some upon the
ground, uttering in an hollow and unpleasant voice, these or the like words
following.

Cresce Cruor, Sanguis satietur sanguine Cresce, quod Spero Sitio, ah Sitio,
Sitio.

Gondomars attendants who had all this while (a far off) beheld their Lords
actions, seeing him now falling down in this trance, came with all possible
speed running unto him, but ere they could offer an hand to his assistance,
they might hear him utter words of that strange nature and quality, that
their fears bridled their charities, and they were rather willing to let him
lie still, bending their atte^tions to his words, then by a too officious
disturbance to break off any part of that discourse which might either make
for the bettering of the knowledge of the State, or otherwise be applied to
future service, at which these unnatural and abortiue accidents ever point,
and therefore fixing their eyes and their ears constantly upon him (as he lay
groueling on the earth) they might hear these, or like words much like unto
these, proceed from his perplexed and amazed spirit.

Blessed soul (Noble Sir Walter Rawleigh) what have I to do with thy
goodness, or wherefore have thou left the peacefulnesse of thy rest, to
torment and call me to account ere the prefixed and full day of my trial be
comed, and that I must stand face to face with thee and a world of others
before the greatest Tribunal, I can confess mine iniquities, and that I have
been to the King my master, as Borgia Caesar was to Pope Alexander the sixth,
an instrument willing to take upon me any or all manner of sins how odious or
vild soever, so I might but make Spain look fresh, and that those imputations
(which otherwise might have drowned her) might be but put into the Catalogue of
my services, though defame and curses were heaped upon me, in much greater
quantities then Ossa, Pelion or Pindus. I do confess I have been the very
Nose of the Spanish State, through which has been voyded all the excrements
both of the head and the whole body: I have been a channel or a Common-shoare
to the Church of Rome, and what either Pope, Priest, Knave or Jesuit could
invent, I have not left to put in practice: I knew the odiousness of
conspiracies, and how hateful they are both to God and man, yet had I never
the power to leave conspiring: I knew both that the Law of God and the law of
Honor, tied Princes to detest conspiracies, and had many times read over that
notable History of Lewis the eleventh, and could my self repeat the noble
and famous praises which all Europe gave him for aduertising his Arch-enemie
the Duke of Burgundy of an attempt against his person: but what has this
wrought in me? certes nothing but more flame and more fuel, so long as my
thoughts were busied with the study and remembrance of an universal Monarchy.

I confess I have many times said (how ever I have believed) that those great
ones which seek to make away their enemies otherwise then by Justice or the
event of war, shows mind base and coward, and that their souls are empty
of true courage, fearing that which they should scorn: I confess I have
admired the goodness of Faritious who delivered into Pirrhus hand the slave
that should have poisoned him: I have made Tiberius Caesar a demy-god, for
answering a King of the Celtes which made him an offer to poison Arminius, That
Rome did not use to be revenged of her enemies secretly and by deceit, but
openly and by arms; but have I pursued this honorable tracte: have any of my
ghostly fathers the Jesuits, or my masters the Inquisitors given examples for
these restrictions? no, their lessons are of a clean contrary nature; they
say Flaminius was an honest man when he made Prusias the King of Bithinia
violate all the laws of hospitality and virtue, in the murder of Haniball,
but the whole Senate condemd the action for most odious, accusd Flaminius of
cruelty and coueteousnesse, of vain glory and of ostentation: and
questionless had they had any touch or feeling of Divinity or Christianity
they could not have found any other rank for him, then that next unto Judas:
these fair paths I have known, but these I have forsaken: and as Flaminius
was the cause of Hanibals death out of an ambitious emulation, that he might in
the Histories of succeeding times be made notorious and eminent for so soul an
action. So I must confess I that have the whole course of my life labourd
continually in the deep mine of policy; have not spared any blood (how
excellent soever) so I might be remembered in our after Annals, for one of the
chief master workmen which went to the building up of the King my masters
Universal Monarchy: And in this I must confess, most blessed soul, that thy
death, thy untimely (and to the Kingdom of Great Britane) much too early death
(which with all violence and with all the coniurations, persuasions and
examples that could tie and bind together the hearts and bodies of Princes I
did both plot, pursue, effect and consumate) was one of the greatest masters
pieces in which I ever triumphed; I have made my self fat with thy downfall:
and the blood which issued from thy wound, was Nectar and Ambrosia to my soul;
for from thy ending I knew rightwell must proceed Spaines beginning: for never
could the Spanish King say as the French King did, Iesuis Roy seul, I am King
alone of the Indies as long as Rawleigh lived, whose knowledge and experience
was able to divert, convert and turn topsie turuie all his conquests, all his
proceedings. I say the tottering ground whereon my King title to the Indies
stood, that it was nothing but violence and force, tyranie and usurpation, and
that if a stranger or more gentle army should enter, how easy it was to set us
besides the cushion; this I knew thou know, and what not besides which
belongs to so great an attempt and triumph? I must confess I have called up
into my mind the honor, the antiquity and greatness of thy great Family,
how rich thou were in blood and friends, the whole West of the English Nation
depending on thine alliance: The manner of thine education, which was not part
but wholly Gentleman, wholly Soldier, the edowments of thy virtues, which was
Learning and Wisdom; the advancement of those endowments, which was to be the
greatest, the best, the most renowned Princess that ever breathed in Europe;
and in the greatest time of the greatest actions, the busiest time of the most
troubled Estates, the wisest time for the discussion of the most difficult
affairs, and the only time that did produce the excellency and perfection of
wisdom, War and Government, so that nothing could be hid from thy
knowledge, neither would thou suffer any thing to be concealed from thine
experience, for thou had ever a mind actiuely disposed; and howsoever thy
fortune was accompanied with all manner of felicities, things able in
themselves to have drawn thy mind from all other objects, and to have settled
thee upon this Theorie, and solitariness is the most excellentest condition
belonging unto mankind, in as much as in it he only finds the true
tranquillity of the mind, for nothing is wanting in that quiet habitation;
Manna falls there, the Ravens bring bread from heaven; if the waters be bitter,
there is wood to sweeten them: If the combat of Amalec and Edom be there, the
triumphs of Moses and Joshua are likewise there, for what cannot a life retired
either suffer or care in its contemplation; yet all this thou did neglect,
and both contradict and disprove: thou knew this life unfit for thy
greatness, and thou were not borne for thy self but thy Country, thou
knew the Sea, wherein every great soul should wander: had not haven but the
grave, and that as they lived so they ought ever to dye in action. Hence it
came, that even in the very flourish and glory of all thy great estate, thou
betookest thy self to the Seas, and what thou have before by thy purse and
infinite great charge in the actions of other men won and annexed to the
Diadem of thy great Mistress, now thou do in thine own person take a vewe.
and sutuay of the same, applying knowledge to report, and making thine own
experience a controller to other men's relations: I dare not (for the honor of
my Nation) unfold the woeful perplexity in which Spain stood during this
tedious voyage, how she quaked to think of the general view which thou had
taken without impeachement of all the West Indies; but most of all when she
was advertised of thy long and laborious passage upon the river Or anaque, the
distinguishments which thou had made betwixt it and the river of Amazons; and
the intelligences which thou had gotten for thine ascent to the great City
of Manoa and Kingdom of Guyana; defignes which if they had been pursued
according to thy willingness and knowledge, we had not at this day acknowledged
one foot of earth for ours in all the West Indies: O the miserable estate of
Spain if these things had proceeded! she had then, which now threatens all,
begd of all; and the Pistolets of gold and pieces of plate wherewith it now
corrupts and conquers Nations, had then been turned to Leather or Iron, or some
other Spanish stuff more base and contemptible: Was it not now high time to
conspire against thee, to dig mine vnder-mine, to enter into familiarity
with malcontents, to seduce some, to bribe others, to flatter all; to preach a
thousand most damnable false doctrines, for the subversion of Princes and the
destruction of their faithful servants: was it not time for us to make
Religion a cloak for our villainy, and vnder-the Lambs Furre to cover the
Wolves policies? believe me (blessed shadow) had we either made conscience of
sin, or scruples for the maintenance of Honor, we had not subsisted as we do,
but had sadly Lain like those which now lie captiued below us, can Spain ever
forget thine attempt upon her own confines and in her most securest places,
call up Cadiz to witness, she will show you some of her ashes; call the Kings
great Armada to account, which was led by his twelve (supposed invincible
Apostles) and the most of them must rise from the bottom of the seas, some
must desimbogue from your our own harbors: Let Pharaoh in Portugal speak,
and she will confess that her Church will yet hardly cover her Idols. When I
look upon the Islands of the Azores, me thinks I see Fiall burning in the
flames which you cast upon her, whilst all the rest bring in the tributs of
their best wealths, to save themselves from perishing. Lastly but not least,
for from it I raisd the groundworke of thy fatal destruction; I cannot but
recount thine action upon the Town of St Thoma standing upon the river of
Oronoque, how fit it lay as a bayte to draw thee into mischief, and how
bravely it gave me occasion never to desist till I saw thy ruin; alas, was
that despised Town to be prised with thy life, with thine experience, with
thine ability to direct, or with the least part of thine actions? no, it was
not only my malice made it inestimable, and my continual solicitations, mine
imprecations, my vows, mine exclamations upon Justice, mine instances on the
actions of pious and religious Kings, and the darings of too bold and ambitious
Subjects, was so importune and violent, that but the great forfeiture of thy
blood, my fury could find no satisfaction: hence you fell, and that fall was
to me more then a double Banquet; for now me thought I saw all things secure
about me: Now said I to my self, who shall shake any one stone in our
building? who shall give us affright by sea, or show us the terrors of the
land? what shall hinder us now to bring home our gold in Caruiles, and our
merchandise in Hoys and Flyboats? all is ours, the Ocean is ours, and the
Indies are ours: this could we never boast before, yet this was my work, and
in this I triumphed.

At these words the Ghost appeared to show anger, and menacying him with
frowns and the shaking of his sword, the poor Don lifting up his arms under
his cloak, showed his red badge of the Order of Colotrauta; but finding the
cross utterly void of virtue to divert that charm, he began to cry out
again in this manner.

Do not mistake me (blessed Soul) in that I have said I triumphed, for I will
now with grief and repentance buy from thy mercy my absolution. It is true
that then I triumphed, for what is he that takes in hand any labor or work of
high consequence, but when he has finished it to perfection, he sits down
and rejoices? So I that saw (not a far off but near at hand) the infinite
hindrances, rubs and impediments, which thy knowledge, thy valor, thy command
and experience, might bring to any work undertaken by my King, for the
advancement or bringing forward of his universal Monarchy: and when I pondred
with my self, that no Nation under heaven was so able in power, so apt in the
nature and disposition of the people, nor so plentiful in all accomodations,
both for sea and land, as this Island of Great Britain, to oppose or beat
back any or all of our undertakings, When I saw France bufie both at home and
abroad, the Lowe-Countries careful to keep their own, not curious to
increase their own; when I saw Germany afflicted with civil anger, Denmark
troubled to take trouble from his dearest kinsman: the Polender watching of the
Turk, and the Turk through former losses, fearful to give any new attempt
upon Christendom, and that in all these we had a maine and particular
interest: when I saw every way smooth for us to pass, and that nothing could
keep the Garland from our heads; or the Goal from our purchase but only the
anger or discontent of this fortunate British Island; blame me not then if I
fell to practices unlawful, to flateries deceitful, to briberie most
hurtefull, and to other enchantments most shameful, by which Imight either
win mine own ends, or make my work prosperous in the opinion of my
Sovereign. I confess I have many times abused the Majesty of Great Britain
with curious falsehoods, I have protested against my knowledge, and uttered
vows and promises which I knew could never be reconciled: I have made delays,
sharp spurs to hasten on mine own purposes, and have brought the swiftest
designs to so slow a pace, that they have been lost like shadows, and
neither known nor regarded: I looked into your Commonwealth, and saw that two
and twenty years ease had made her grow idle; I saw the East Indies eat up
and devour your Mariners and Seamen, and time and old age consume and take
away your land Captains; and of all, none more material then your self:
Blame me not then if I made thine end my beginning, thy fall the fullness of my
perfection, and thy destruction the last work or masterpiece of all my
wisdom and policy. This is the freedom of my confession, and but from this
sin absolve me, and I will dye thy penitent in sackecloath and ashes.

At these words the apparition seemed (in the fearful imagination of the
poor Don) to be more then exceeding angry, and looked upon him with such
terror and amazement, that Gondomar fell (with the affright) into a trance or
deadly sound, whilst the Ghost seemed to utter unto him these or these like
words following.

Harken to my detection, and though I know thou can steal and kill, swear
and lie, weep and wound, and indeed do any thing that is contrary to Truth
and Justice; yet in this accusation, shame and thine own putrified conscience
shall be witnesses so powerful and undaunted, that thou shall not be able to
refell any one allegation or smallest particle.

To begin then with mine own end, though I know the day of my death was the
greatest Festival that ever thy fortune did solemnize, though it brought to
Spain a year of Iubile, to thy reputation Absolans pillars, and to every
Papisticall Minister in the world, the praise of his Artes-master; yet poor
despised mortal, know, it was not you, but a more divine and inserutable
finger which pointed out my destiny to this manner of end and destruction,
neither is it fit for the humility of ignorant man to open his eyes, as daring
to presume to gaze on the radiant beams of that sovereign power, which
disposes of second causes as he pleases: neither do I afflict thee as my
particular executioner, but as my Countries general enemy: It suffices me
that the great God who is Judge of life and death, has disposed of my life,
and after this early manner, that in it he might expres the effects of his
Justice; therefore trouble not thy self with my death which was thy comfort,
but be vexed at thine own life, which is nothing but a continual pilgrimage
to Ambition, and an undermining Moale to dig down the Church of God, and to
bring the Gospel of our blessed Savior into eternal captivity. Have not
thou been an untired packe-horse, traveling night and day without a bait,
and laden like ad Ass, till thy knees have bowed under the burden of strange
and unnatural designs, by which to advance thy Master to the universal
Monarchy of all Europe: This thy fear has made thee confess, but this thy
flattery and falsehood will deny, should not the efficacy of truth make it
most apparent and pregnant: Therefore to enter into the first streams from
whence Spain has gathered the great Ocean of its Sovereignty, there is no
fountain more remarkable then the Battle of Alcazar in Barbary, where the too
forward Don Sebastian King of Portugal (whether slain or not slain) engaging
himself too unfortunately, gave occasion to Philip the second of Spain, to
enter and usurp upon his kinsmans Kingdoms, to expel Don Antonio from his
right and inheritance, and as it is strongly supposed, to cause the true King
himself to dye in the Galleys; hence he became King of all the Spaines and
Portugal, pulled to himself the Soueraignetie both of the Islands of the
Canaries and of the Azores, the one securing his way forth, the other securing
his way home from the West Indies, and so made the conquest thereof more safe
and vndoubded: he took also by the same interest many strong holds and
marchantable places in the East Indies, so that sitting now alone in Spain
without a competitor, and having treasure from the West Indies wherewith to pay
Soldiers, and merchandise from the East Indies wherewith to enrich his own
subjects, what could he, or what did he contemplate upon but the augmentation
of his Monarchy: Hence it came that his waare grew violent upon the
Low Countries and under the Governments of the Duke of Alua, and Don John Duke
of Austria, the tyrannies so insufferable, that all manner of freedoms were
converted to slaueries, and the blood of the Nobility made only food for the
slaughterhouse, yea such as were remote and stood farther off from his
cruelty, depending upon their own rights and under the covert of their own
guards, were not yet safe from Spaines conspiracies, and that witnesses the
death and murder of the famous Prince of Orange, the imprisonment and death of
his eldest son, and a world of infamous practices against the life of Count
Maurice, the last Prince deceased, and against the safety of Count Henrike the
Prince now suruiuing: what incrochments were daily made upon these distressed
Provinces, all the Princes of Europe blush to behold, and had not Elizabeth my
dread Lady and Mistress of famous and blessed memory, taken them to her Royal
protection, they had long since been swallowed up in the gulphe of his
tyranny; and none of them now living had known the name of free Princes: and
as this work was begun by Philip the second, so it was continued by Philip the
third, and is now at this hour as earnestly pursued by Philip the fourth and
his sister the Archduchesse, and rather with gaining then loosing; so that
should England but turn its face a little away from their succor, there would
be a great breach made in the hope of their subsisting.

But you will answer, that if Spain had fixed down its resolution upon an
universal Monarchy, they had never then harkned to a peace with the
Nether-Lands: to this thine own conscience is ten thousand witnesses, that the
peace which it entertained was nothing else but a politic delay to bring
other and impersit ends and designs, to a more fit and solid purpose, for
effecting of his general conquest: for what did this Truce, but divert the
eyes of the Nether-lands (which at that time were growing to be infinite great
masters of shipping) from taking a suruay of his Indies, and brought a
security to the transportation of his plate and treasure, and made him settle
and reinforce his Garrisons which then were grown weak and ouertoyled,
besides a world of other advantages, which too plainly discovered themselves
as soon as the war was new commenced.

As he had thus gotten his feet into the Nether-lands, had not Spain in the
same manner, and with as much usurpation, thrust his whole body into Italy? let
Naples speak, let Sicill, let the Islands of Sardinia and Corfica, the Dukedom
of Millan, the reuolte of the Valtoline and a world of other places, some
possessed, some lying under the pretense of strange Titles, but come to give up
their account, and it will be more then manifest, that no Signorie in all:
Italy but stood upon his guard, and howerly expected when the Spanish storm
should fall upon them; how many quarrels has been piled against the State of
Venice, some by the Pope, some by the King of Spain? how many doubts have
been thrown upon Tuscanie? what protestations have flowne to Genoa, and what
threatenings against Geneua? and all to put Italy into conbustion, whilst the
Popes holiness, and his Catholic Majesty, like Saturnes sons, sat full
gordgd with expectation to divide heaven and earth between them.

O was it not a brave politic trick of Spain, (neither was thine advice
absent from the mischief) when the difference fell between Henry the Great of
France and the Duke of Sauoye, about the Marquisate of Saluses; the King then
your master under pretense of aiding the Duke his brother in Law, sent diverse
Regiments of Spaniards which were quartered some in Garbonieres, some in
Montemellion, Sauillan, Pignoroll and diverse other places about Sauoye and
Piemont, but when the Truce was concluded, could the Duke upon any entreaty,
potent or message make these Spaniards to quit his Country? no, by no means,
for they were so far from leaving their foot-hold, having received dtuers
commandments to keep it, both from the Count de Fuentes (at that time Viceroy
of Millan) from thee by private letters, and from the King your Master by
sundry Commissions; that the chiefes of those Troops, peremptorily answered
the Duke, that they would hold their gettings, in despite of all oppositions,
and were indeed full as good as their words for a long time, till at last the
Duke (enforced thereunto) raised up a strong Army, and in a few days put them
all to the sword, I would here repeat the Spanish attempt against the Castle
of Nice, being the very key or opener of an entrance into the very bowels of
Italy; I could speak of the dangerous quarrel raisd between the Duke of
Sauoye and the Duke of Mantoa, for the Marquisate of Montferrat, and how fatal
it was likely to have been to the whole state of Italy, wherein Fuentes and
thy self, showed all the art of practice that might be, which, should become
the master worke-man; but these things are so pregnant and apparent that they
need little discussion.

Let me now awaken thy memory with some stirrings up or practices against the
Kingdom of France, no less but more pernicious then any of the former; who
was the head or chief sovereign (after the the death of Henry the third King
of France and Poland) of that most unchristian like combination, entitled the
Holy, but truly unholy League, was it not Philip of Spain one of your most
Catholic Masters, who made the great and valiant Guise his sword and servant,
the old Queen mother his intelligencer and admirer, the Cardinals his
Ministers and seducers, and the Pope himself a Prodigal child, to bestow and
give away whatsoever he required? was not all this Philip of Spain your
Catholic Master? How long did he keep Henry the fourth surnamed the Great,
from his lawful Throne and inheritance? what Cities did he possess? even
the greatest that France could number: what Countries under his command? all
that were rich or fruitful: and what Nobility had he drawn from their
obedience? those that were more powerful and best beloved; in so much, that
had not my most excellent Mistress Elizabeth, of blessed and famous Memory, like
a strong Rock against the rage of a furious sea, taken the quarrel into her
hand, and by her Royal protection, first under the conduct of the Lord
Willoughby, after under the conduct of the Earl of Essex, staid and supported
that reeling Estate, France it is feared, at this hour had only spoken the
Spanish language: but God in his great mercy had otherwise disposed of these
practices, and though with some difficulties, brought the Crown of France to
its true owner; a Prince so absolutely excellent in every perfection of true
honor and magnimitie, that his parallel has not been found in all the
History of France, and although he had in his very youth and almost
childhood prevailed in diverse Battles, as that at Montconter, and at
Rene-le-duke; and although he had been assailed in the days of Henry the
third, and in the space of four years, by ten Royal Armies successively one
after another, and sent one to refresh the other, and under the conduct of
great and most glorious Captains, against all which he prevailed, as witnessed
his victory at the Battle of Coutras and other places, though he had given
succor to Henry the third, and delivered him from his great danger at Tours,
bringing to his obedience Gargeau, Gien, La Charity, Fluuiers, Estampes,
Deurdan and diverse other places: though he had been generally fortunate in
all his great actions, yet after the death of Henry the third, this deuillish
combination, or Spanish knot of the League is more ominous, fatal and
troublesome unto him, then all his former undertakings; and he found that
although he might have come to the Crown of France by succession, which was
the easiest way, yet God to try his courage, to exercise the force of his
mind, and to make a foolish shadow or Ignis Fatuus of Spaines Ambition,
presented the most painful and difficult unto him, which was that of
Conquest: He was forced to raise on foot (by the help of our E^glish Nation)
three Royal Armies, which he dispersed in three Provinces; the first, into
Normandy, where he was assisted by the Earl of Essex, the second into
Champaigne, and the third into Picardie, where he was seconded by the Lord
Willoughbie, who brought him triumphantly into the suburbs of Paris, and by the
blowing up of a Port, offered to deliver the whole City to his subjection;
the Earl of Essex did as much at Roan, but the King desired to win France,
not to destroy France, yet ere the Earl departed, he chafed rebellion out of
the most part of Normandy: the King gave his enemis (the Spanish faction)
battle upon the plain of Yury and won it, by which he regained in less then
two months fifteen or sixteen great Towns, brought Paris to infinite
extreamitie, made the Spaniards wish themselves on the other side of the
Pereneans: and indeed such a general amazement to all the unhappy Leaguers,
that all stood aghast, as uncertain which way to turn them.

This when your great Master beheld, and saw that all his hopes were dying in
an instant, like a cunning Coniurer he seeks to draw fire and lightning from
heaven, to consume what his Armies durst not approach or disualewe, whence it
came, that he rouses up Gregory the 13. then Pope, who indeed was the Oracle,
or rather the creature of Philip your master, and makes him of a common Father
between the head of a rebellious and usurping party, casting forth his
fulminations with such violence and injustice, that the Bulls were taken and
burnt both at Tours and at Chalons; neither sent he out these Bulls by his
ungodly and bloody Ministers the Jesuits, or such like desperate and obscure
mal-contents, but with an Army of a thousand cassacks of watchet velvet,
imbrodred with gold, and Ciphers of Keys joined unto swords (whose errand was,
to demand the execution of these Bulls) now seeing the difficulty wherein
affairs stood, upon the view of one hundred horse of the French Kings white
Cornet, dare not for all the Pope or the King of Spaines hopes or commandments
abandon the very shadow of the walls of Verdun, but like so many Foxes lay
lurking in their kennels of security, knowing they had to deal with me^, whose
swords were so well steeld, that they feared not the lead of Rome, only like
so many Furies of hell they seek to break all treaties of peace, and made it
an action treasonable and most impious, to talk of an unity between the
Sovereign and the subject.

But for all this, great Henry lost no time, for first, he passed into
Normandy, secured his friends there, thence he went into Picardie, besieged
Noyon and took it, even in the view of the Spanish Army, who although they
were three to one, yet durst not to hazard the Battle: which advantage the King
wisely taking, and turning head upon his enemies, albeit he was advised to the
contrary by his chiefest servants, yet his courage bound him rather to follow
the path of danger with honor, then that of safety with shame, saying as
Pompey said, That in striking his foot against the earth he would raise up
Legions: so the Armies met together at Aumale, where though upon the first
approach the King was hurt with a shot, yet he had strongth enough to cry
Charge, Charge, and breaking through his enemies, he put the Duke of Parma and
all his Spaniards to a shameful retraite; as this, so he beat his enemies at
Bellencombe, he stripes them at Bure, and made them to quit Tuetot with much
shame and loss.

Thus this Royal Kings quarrel being just, and maintained by a good sword,
the pride of Spain found that if the war contained longer, her Catholic
greatness, could have more wood to heat her Oven, then corn to send to the
Mill.

It Is purposelesse to speak of the ruin of Quibeuf, the recovery of Espernay,
or that brave assault, where eight Horses put three hundred to route; let it
suffice me in one word to conclude, that in despite of all the engines which
the Pope or the King of Spain could use, Henry of France became triumphant,
and your Masters universal Monarchy was turned topsie turuie: nay, the League
the Typhon of sedition from whence sprung so many Serpents and Vipers of
disloyalty, was smothered under the AEtna of her own presumption and pride.

But did either Spain or Rome here stay their malice? fie no, but rather
Anteus like, they rose up with double vigor, and what public war could not
effect, private practice and conspiracy must bring to pass, for ere the Great
Henry was well warmed in his Throne, Hell and the Spanish gold stird up a
wretch, who undertook to kill him; the Tiger staid his hand at the shining of
a glass, and after his apprehension, confessed that he saw so much piety and
zeal shining in the eyes of this Prince, that he felt horror in himself to
offend the Sovereign dignity ordained of God among Angels and Men. Hence it
came that all France beheld and took notice of Spaines Ambition, and that
indeed all their labor was but to reduce that flourishing Nation to a private
Province, which the Parliament of Paris (after it had vomited the phlegm of
temporizing) taking to heart, made forth a Decree for the dispersing and
banishing of all the Spanish Regiments: and now five great Dukes, formerly
bewitched with Catholic incantations, fall at the foot of this great King,
and confess how they were beguyled.

The first, was the Duke of Lorraine, which obtained a general Peace for his
Estate, through the mediation of Ferdinand the Archduke of Tuscanie; the second
was the Duke of Mayenne, who abtained pardon through the wisdom of his
carryage, having still a watchful eye, that no general ruin might happen to
the Kingdom; The third, was the Duke of Guise, the loss of whose father and
uncle, made his interest the greatest in this quarrel, yet had he the honor
to receive the Kings first embraces; The fourth was the Duke of Ioyeuse, who as
soon as he had kissed the Kings hand, forsook the troubles of the world,
betook himself to a solitary life; and the last was the Duke Mercure, who
brought to the King, not himself alone, but with him the reduction of the
goodlyest Province in all France: To conclude Philip of Spain your Master,
seeing upon what false wheels his engines ran, was content to entreat for
peace of this great Cheiftaine.

But did here conspiracies and Spanish plots end? no, nothing so: for to come
nearer to your own touch, and to repeat matters of thine own prosecution,
Is it not an History most remarkable, and to Spain most infamous, of that
desperate vilaine borne at Negre-pelisse, who going into Spain upon some
discontents conceived against this great Henry of France, and as it was
strongly supposed, having taken some directions from you, but full and
material instructions from the Devils post horses your masters the Jesuits,
did with all violence prostitute himself to murder this most Christian King;
but the matter being so important, and carried through so many several hands,
had lost so much strength of secrecy, that an inckling thereof came to the
ears of de Barrant, then ordinary Ambassador in Spain for the King of
France, who instantly out of duty, and the hatred which every true Christian
ought to bear against these odious and most Atheistical practices, complained
to the Popes Nuntio, hoping of redress, both against the vilaine himself,
your self and the Jesuits, who are both vilaines and your self; but the
matter was fully blancht, and your impious ear (that had listened to this
abominable sin) was excused, and the whole offense of subornation was laid
upon a creature of yours; but one of the King of Spaines Esquiers, named by the
place of his birth Valdomoro, who upon examination (having his lesson fore
taught him, confessed all the passages to the Duke of Lerma, and that not only
this slave, but diverse others had tendered themselves to the like service, yet
this with the greatest violence, assuring him that he knew the means how to
kill the King; which proposition, upon some conference with a Jesuit (who
never take distaste at such a practice) he had accepted of, but yet with that
caution and delay that nothing proceeded therein, neither was likely to
proceed, and so all things were shut up without any further discovery, only
that de Barraut advertised the King his Master thereof: but was this honorable
or pious in Spain? no, the praise had been more perfect, and the merit more
plain and evident for the Spaniards, if they had punished the Traitor, made
thy self Valdomoro, and the Jesuit examples, not to listen or give ear to
such odious conspiracies, and by a careful advertisement to the King, made
others dread the entering into so odious a business, for it is true in all the
laws of hospitality, that this slave ought not to have come out of Spain
vnchastised, for all Kings are brothers, and all Kingdoms interessed in these
attemps. But the designs of Spain looked now an other way, and the Traitor had
leave to escape, who returning afterward into France, was by de Verdun first
President of Languedoc, apprehended at Toulouse and there executed, and his
companion condemnd to the Galleys. O how far was this action short, of that
Royal and Princely act of the famous late Queen Elizabeth! who having
received intelligence of some Spanish mischieues pretended against this great
King, forthwith gave him intelligence, that a strange Gentleman, who was one of
his followers, had no good meaning toward his person, and related unto him
every circumsta^ce as she had received it; but such was the bounty of this
great King, that allbe reason would that he should have bin apprehended, yet
the King never discovered unto him a frown, but he still remained in the Court
well entertained, was mounted out of the Kings stable, and honored with many
of his trusty commandments, till in the end torturd with his own conscience,
he stole away from the Court, and durst no longer abuse so Royal a bounty;
that this was a Favorite of Spain your self cannot deny, that he fled from
France into Spain, your one Cabanet is a witness, and that you did preserve
him for the like exploits in others places: the mark on his face, the color
of his beard, and his clothes cut after the Walloone fashion were too apparent
testimonies.

I might here recounte this great Kings death by Rauiliac, from whose blood,
neither thy self nor Spain can wash themselves, though all the Rivers in the
world were exhausted and thrust into one entyer Bath, and so spent upon your
particular cleansings; but these truths are so fresh in memory, they need
neither repeating, nor amplification.

I could to these add a world of others, as the attempts upon the life and
safety of the late Queen Elizabeth of famous memory, and the making of all
those inhumane creatures Pentioners of Spain, who had either by rebellion or
other treasonable practice, attempted any thing for her untimely and sad
destruction.

Was our late dread Sovereign, King James of blessed and happy memory, that
Solomon of his time, a Prince so indulgent and careful for every good thing
that might happen to Spain, a man so tender and vigilant for her reputation,
that he ever placed it in the next rank to his own honor? was he I say?
was this good King free from the bloody practices of Spain? no, to the
eternal infamy of ungrateful and bloody Spain; I may ever proclaim it that
he was more deeply plunged and his like, more bitterly besieged and assaulted,
then any whatsoever before rehearsed: and to this I call up the plot of all
plots, that Devil of many legions of Devils, the Gun-pouder conspiracy, that
which should have destroyed all, not a single Prince or a single man, but many
Princes, many men's whole generations; here was cruel Spain and here indeed
(had not God prevented) was a strong foundation for an universal Monarchy;
and that Spain may not in this, plead not guilty: let her discover to the
world what occurrents they were which drew Thomas ^inter into her confines,
what negotiation was that which he held with de Laxis, whence came his
instructions and letters commendatorie into ^he Archduchesse Country? where
did Guy Faucks ^eceiue his breeding? who gave information of ^is knowledge in
myning? and who preferred and aduancst him to this piece of most damnable
service? questionless let truth answer to any of these positions, and the
speech it must utter, will be Spanish language; who in all this Nation was so
intimate with you as the Archpriest Garnet? or who like him found at your hands
equal protection? he confessed and absolved the Traitors, and thou did absolve
and confess him, and thereby did get unto thy self from thine own Tribe,
the nicke-name of Archbishop Ambassador.

Thus I have brought Spaines attemps for an universal Monarchy, from
Portugal to the Netherlands, thence through Italy, so into France; England,
was looked upon by the way, in the year 1588. but she was not so drowfie as
others: there is now but Germany betwixt him and the end of his Ambition, but
is that free and untouched? woe to speak it, that of all is the worst and most
horred: O the lamentable estate, of those once most happy Princes! how has
the house of Austria drowned them in blood? and by the work of civil
dissension, made them in their furies to devour one another. Is there any
thing in this age more lamentable or remarquable, then the loss of the
Palatinate? or is there any thing in which thy villainy can so much triumph as
in that politic defeature? why, the lies which thou did utter to abuse the
Majesty of England, and to breed delays till thy Masters designs were
effected, were so curious and so cunning, so apt to catch, and so strong in
the holding, that the Devil (who was formerly the author of lies) has now
from thee taken new presidents for lying. I would here speak of thy
Archduchesses dissimulation, but she is a great Lady, and their errors at the
worst are weak virtues.

Therefore to thee that have lent both fuel and flame to all the mischiefs of
Europe, and that art now big in labor with new troubles and vexations, arise
and collect thy spirits, become once hon^st and religious, let thy services
depend upon good and necessary affairs, and not upon malicious and bloody
practices: for behold, I thy Tormentor will never be absent from thine elbow,
and whatsoever thou shall contriue or plot for the hurt of Great Britain, I
with the help of the holy Angels will return upon thine own bosom and the
bosom of thy Country, for the good of heaven and earth, who is the Protector
of the Innocent; has made Royal King CHARLES and his Throne precious in his
sight, therefore if thou desire to live and see good days, touch not his
anointed and do his Prophets no hurt.

At these words, the glorious aparition (wauing his sword about) vanished out
of his sight, and the poor Don as if awakened from a deadly or mortal sleep
rose up, looking about with such ghastly amazedness as affrighted all that
beheld him. In the end espying his own servants, with tears in his eyes,
terror in his heart, and a general trembling over all his body, he went into
his Litter, and returned home, where how he refresht himself, how he appeared
before the designed Commissioners, and how he answered the expectation both of
them and the King his Master, shall be declared upon the next return of the
woman Post which passes betwixt the English and the Spanish Iesutis.

FINIS.
